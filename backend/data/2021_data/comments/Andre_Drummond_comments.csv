"I think it's crazy to consider not getting a top 25 player, or two top 50 guys back for Kyrie, especially when you can get a decent defense by just filling out the roster. Getting Javale and Ariza or someone like that would make a good difference. Andre Drummond would help a lot. Just casually giving away one of the game's great players just feels like such a miss, especially when they're at their absolute peak ."
Nets need a center. Waiting for that Andre Drummond buyout
"Ehh yes and no. Weve definitely won games this year just because no one else could bang with drummond (pistons game, Knicks game and 2nd nets game) I think at his best there is very few centers who can rebound with him or handle him down low. Hes in a weird spot right now because the cavs have such a young team that we are trying to develop so it's an odd mix of trying to put Drummond and love into this young teams offense because theres only so many touches to go around . Where Andre gets in trouble is when we let him handle the ball for long stretches. I think that's a bickerstaff issue though and not a drummond issue. Make no mistake, coming from someone who has watched every cavs game, he is a definite upgrade over DeAndre Jordan and I think if he played with durant harden and Irving he would accept his role and be the inside presence you guys are missing. Hes also a way better defender than people  realize (top ten in steals). I dont see how he wouldnt make the nets better. They have such a glaring hole that he can help mend"
"I honestly don't see a buyout happening either, but it's been reported by 2 sources now (Zach harper and Kevin o'connor).   Now the only way I see this happening is andre requests a buyout and leaves a ton of money on the table. His agent is also kevin love. Management likes to be on good sides with agents now. As we know, we are in the player empowerment era of the league. Players usually get what they want.   And also this would give more minutes to allen. He's due for a new contract and this move will help evaluate him better without drummond there.  Again I don't see it happening but being a nets fan. I hope it will lol."
"This is crazy. Luka is averaging 27/9/9 carrying his team. Ayton is what, the third or fourth best on his team depending how high on bridges you are. Swap those 2 and see what happens. Mavs become one of the bottom 3 teams in the league and the Suns would be much better. It blows me away anyone thinks Ayton should’ve been drafted first. Y’all really think when there’s a minute left  and ayton has to make a play on AD or Embiid he’s gonna go from “afraid with the ball” to killer when he’s shown a passivity for shooting and nothing more than 10 ft range. Basically, I’m saying is Luka is a future MVP and multi-time champion and Deandre is a younger, cooler Andre Drummond."
"What would the package be?  James Johnson, WCS/Dwight Powell and a pick for Andre Drummond? I have no clue, just spitballin here"
The difference between Jarrett Allen and Drummond is literally night and day. holy shit i don't ever want andre to start
"Do we actually look like a basketball team today, or is it the Andre Drummond show again? Just turned on the game."
"To be fair there are ""empty stats"" but people just give that label to any player putting up good numbers on a bad team. It should just be reserved for players with low efficiency, high volume stats like Dennis Smith jr who averaged 15/4/5 on a woeful 47%TS or Andre Drummond who is averaging 18/15/3 on 50%TS which for a guy who should just be catching lobs/dunking is awful. Those are truly empty stats because neither player is actually making a meaningful contribution to winning."
Andre Drummond - Karl Anthony Towns
"Tells you a lot more about how valuable it is to accrue 15ppg and 15 rpg in today's game than it does about andre drummond.  All that said, the Hornies should try to snap drummond up for nothing.  Give him biyombo's minutes--thats gotta have a nice impact right?"
"DBPM is especially bad (box-score only).  On/off-based advanced defensive metrics are much lower on him.  [Pure RAPM has him 410th in the league](http://nbashotcharts.com/rapm?id=1509949181)   [RPM has him 367th](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/page/10/sort/DRPM)   RAPTOR has him 199th    The one RAPM-based thing that really likes him on defense is [EPM](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm), but it also really likes Andre Drummond (also hated by pure RAPM), so I'm guessing that EPM is leaning pretty hard on the box numbers while the RAPM sample is small."

"Andre is still our starting C and they’re playing Allen w/ backup minutes, 15-20 per game. Allen is the future; most of us are convinced they’re letting Drummond put up stats before the deadline so he can get traded."
Sexton had no legs and someone made the inexplicable decision to allow Andre Drummond on the court
The day Andre Drummond is no longer on the Cavs will be the happiest day of my life as a fan since June 19th 2016. I can't stand watching this bum stat pad anymore.
"Andre Drummond makes my blood boil man. Great looking stats, awful everywhere that matters. Watching him trying to hero ball there was pathetic"
"Yeah when it comes to double doubles, Wilt holds all the records. I remember earlier this season Andre Drummond posted his 44th (I could be wrong) 20 point 20 rebound double double but yet isn’t even 1/4th of the way to Wilt."
That's Andre Drummond.
"Wait wait, did you say you'd rather force Nance to shoot instead of *Drummond*?  You want Nance, a guy who shot 35% from three last year and is currently shooting 38% and has an average shot distance of 14.3 feet, to shoot.  A guy with a 57.3% TS%.  You'd rather have your defense make him shoot, rather than let renowned sharpshooter Andre Drummond, who is a career 13.6% shooter from three and currently has an average shot distance of 3.6 feet and a TS% of 49.7%, take a shot.  My man, what is wrong with you?  EVERYONE on our team should be shooting more often than Drummond.  You also mentioned Windler and Cedi, which is weird because if they're open they absolutely *should* be taking the shot every time.  Windler is an excellent shooter!  Cedi's okay!  Both are FAR better than Drummond!"

"Andre Drummond is in buyout rumors, and I can't think of many players who'd be a better fit for us than him"
Easily Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond will shoot a perplexed look to the ref no matter the situation.
"Something people forget about Andre Drummond...  Kyle Lowry was not always Kyle Lowry. Kawhi was not always Kawhi. Hell, LeBron and Jason Kidd were not the shooters they later became when they were early in their career. It takes time to develop.   How do we know he’s even THAT bad of a shooter? Granted, his shooting is poor right now, but we’ve seen him take so few shots that we can’t say for sure that he’s really any worse than a guy like Giannis."
"Why would they re-sign him? He's going to want a max deal or something close to a max deal and there are teams out there stupid enough to do that. So now the Cavs are going to hamstring themselves by loading up the same situation they have now except with a more untradeable contract? Who is going to want to give up valuable assets for Andre Drummond on a long-term, overpriced deal?      If they can get picks or a bad contract that can fit their team, more power to them. But anything outside of an NBA2k trade finder, I don't see it. There's a reason Detroit gave him up for nothing."

Those are terrible comparisons. Andre Drummond is nowhere near that level and has an expiring contract. His only value to the Cavs in terms of their ability to compete in the future is as trade bait.
Yea plus when Andre Drummond gets bought out and ends up a Net  🙄
"lol this is just proof that the stats will live forever, there will probably be some ""damn andre drummond was so underrated"" posts in 20 yrs"
"It's not so much he's washed, he's a good player and still athletic, he just doesn't play winning basketball (see also demar derozan, andre drummond)."
at this point just give me andre drummond
Andre Drummond will be one of the most overrated of all time. The King of empty stats.
"In 2k I had always found it unrealistic that players could miss that many easy layups, and then I watched Andre Drummond"
Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond
Who wants to send $29 million in salary for Andre Drummond?
"Defensive Rebounding on a team that should have been a contender in those Lob City Clippers.  I seriously wonder if that's why 2k has Andre Drummond win DPOY a bunch because they overrate rebounding as a defensive metric.  And he had a few years of pretty great block totals, but he'd more often than not put himself out of position chasing blocks and give up an easy basket."
Recently it's been Andre Drummond.
https://cavaliersnation.com/2021/01/27/its-matter-time-until-andre-drummond-secures-buyout-joins-brooklyn-nets/
"Makes sense for the Cavs if they’re trying to save money.   Makes sense for Drummond. He’s already starting to share hella minutes with JA and JA often closing out games. Drummonds contract is huge at $29millie and championship caliber teams that could use him don’t have the space to trade for him.  With JA eating up more and more of Drummonds minutes the less of a chance he has at showcasing his skills for another contract in the offseason. If he gives up a few million he can start for the Nets, have a good playoff showing, maybe win a chip and be a highly coveted free agent.  As of now if Drummond stays on the Cavs I don’t see him getting a big long term contract. The Cavs aren’t gonna sign him to anything big now with JA and he really hasn’t shown anything other than empty stats.  If Andre wants to play and have the best chance of getting another good contract the buyout makes the most sense."
"Please make it happen. I need to see Andre Drummond shooting 15 times a game on a team with KD, Harden, and Irving. Plus Embiid is his father."
I'm surprised Andre Drummond hasn't accomplish this feat. /s
Andre Drummond has been doing something similar for a while now...
This sounds a little risky but go for a defensive PF/ Center and have Towns move to PF. You will have to take somebody that’s going to be going at the deadline and outbid the Nets. So I’m totally biased but Andre Drummond would give a huge boost (when motivated to play defense which JB somehow pulled off on the Cavs).  Notice how the Cavs had the worst defensive players last year for guards but this year with good schemes and Effort from the players we are grit and grinding our way to the play offs. So a defensive minded coach would help too.
What do you got for Andre Drummond?

You mean like a rotation? Andre Drummond is definitely a starting caliber player.
Cavs really got Jarrett Allen for a late first and Andre Drummond for a second. Cavs front office is playing chess while some of these guys are playing checkers.
Is anyone else surprised by how mobile Andre Drummond is for a big guy?
Andre Drummond has the worst body language in the league
**WE NEED ANDRE DRUMMOND FOR MALIK MONK AND ZELLER**
Andre Drummond literally wrecks the cavs offense
"Andre Drummond is playing like he’s scared for his job.  Forcing shots, calling for passes, not passing"
"Would shaq be Andre Drummond? Plenty of rebounds but useless at floor spacing,"
"if i truly believed stats = value, then i would've said andre drummond deserves a supermax"
Andre Drummond being only 27 years old was my biggest takeaway from this post. Thought for sure this dude was around 30.
Andre drummond
Andre Drummond
"4/18 is always a bad shooting game. But shooting != scoring, necessarily.   If Harden also hit 20/20 FTs then he had an efficient scoring game, which is what his TS% will reflect. Likewise, if DeAndre Jordan makes 5/5 dunks then he had an efficient scoring night even though he can't shoot a lick.   FTAs are naturally more efficient than FGAs, with a few exceptions (Andre Drummond, etc). So if you're trying to measure scoring efficiency, of course FTs need to be factored in. A point from a FT is still a point scored."
"Clint Capela, Jarrett Allen, Andre Drummond, Nikola Vucevic  How would you rank those players"
Embiid draws extra fouls from big men all the time through talk. Andre Drummond notably has blown up on him. Also Embiid seems to keep momentum flowing when he’s jawing
Andre Drummond is so awful it’s amazing how he sees time on the floor
"Andre Drummond, too! And Corny Thompson, both from Middletown. John Pinone, who coaches boys hoops (or did he retire?) at Cromwell. And RIP ""Soup"" Campbell, who never made it to the NBA, but was a superstar at Providence.  Edit: I guess Drummond was born in NY."
"That's really fucking bad. You can't have a guard shooting like Andre Drummond  Like his shooting would be okay if he could drive and finish but when fouling costs for so little, it's gonna hurt your chances"
imagine being tackled by andre drummond lmao he’s huge
Andre Drummond has tree trunk legs
"If the Nets can beat Andre Drummond and Cedi Osman, who else in the East has a chance of stopping them? The answer is no one."
why is clevelands offense entirely andre drummond post ups.
Yea the issue is where someone was born vs. where they grew up. Andre Drummond was born in NY but grew up in CT and calls the state home. But he wouldn't be included for CT.
"I looked up KZ Okpala the other day and Wikipedia had this:  &gt; In 2021, Maxwell Stone rated him as the 97th Greatest Basketball Player of All time, directly behind Andre Drummond in his all time rankings."

Because the Knicks are average and the Cavs are terrible. It’s not complicated. The Cavs best player is Andre Drummond. Idk why you wanna argue in circles but the Cavs fucking suck and nothing you say can change that.
Sources tell me that the Cavs are signing Len to play PG.      Cavs starting lineup:  PG: Alex Len  SG: Kevin Love  SF: Jarrett Allen  PF: Javale Mcgee  C: Andre Drummond
You want Andre Drummond?
"A trade I'd be a big fan of is:  **Cavs trade:** Andre Drummond.   **Hornets trade:** Miles Bridges, Malik Monk, Cody Zeller.   Monk is out of favour there, Bridges has lost his starting job to Hayward, and Zeller expires at the end of this season just like Drummond.   Cavs get another wing in Bridges and the chance to take a swing on Monk."
"Alex Len isn't good.  For real, if the Raptors are still trying to contend this year, I'd like to see the Raptors acquire Nikola Vucevic.  Not sure how though, since I imagine FVV and OG are untouchable.  The alternative could be Andre Drummond, but he doesn't fit the Raptors style-of-play at all."
"The Wizards are in DC and probably preoccupied with that mess, right? So not aware of recent developments?  We have a SLIGHTLY used and VERY talented Kevin Porter Jr along with a 20 and 20 player in Andre Drummond to sweeten the deal"
"Yep, now he gets to fight with Andre Drummond and JaVale McGee for minutes in Cleveland. Much better."
What’s the price of Jarrett Allen or Andre Drummond?
okay yeah youre right andre drummond isos are way better
"&gt; Pistons: plays him after trading Drummond and balls out  I've been wrong about a lot of Pistons things in my life (thought we got too little for Stackhouse, thought Chauncey would just be Super Atkins, thought Darko was the final piece) but I'm proud to say I was all about Christian Wood from the moment I saw him in the 2019 preseason.   Granted, at first it was mostly just because I loved that he dunked like he was angry at the rim but over time, he really seemed to have a positive effect on the action whenever he was out there. I swear the Pistons were better with him on the floor than Andre even before he started eating up playing time post-Andre.   I'm pretty bummed Detroit couldn't hang onto him. Glad Jerami's doing well at least though."
"I mean he's right.     Ben Simmons (much like Andre Drummond &amp; a few other guys) basically have to get paid that much because they're elite at a few things on the court, you just don't want it to be your team that does it."
"If Andre Drummond ends up on a contender / championship team towards the end of his career, people will look back with more respect for the numbers he put up."
Myles Turner &amp; Andre Drummond snubs
Andre Drummond
Wonder if they could get Andre Drummond since he’s on an expiring and I assume Jarrett Allen is their center of the future?
""" try to use some semblance of logic. ""  Ignores half my argument and tells me to use some logic... it would be logical to not nit pick individual pieces and frame them to sound like something i didn't say.  ""So the idea that you've watched him play so he's not underrated is flat out idiotic""  Perfect example of you putting words in my mouth. Because i say i've seen him play and know how good he is you assume that's my whole argument. Great logic  ""media never talks about him"" not anymore after 2 first round exits lol, he was talked about in the 2018-2019 season but maybe you weren't watching basketball then.  Is Andre Drummond talked about anymore? Rarely. Is that because he's ""underrated"". No it's because he was the best player on his team until Blake showed up and we realized he's not that good.  Was Kemba the best player on Charlotte, yes... But ever since he got to Boston, he doesn't look like that player anymore? Weird... i think not.  &amp;#x200B;  ""Vuc is underrated because the casual fan wouldn't even know who he is, because no one talks about him. That's why he's underrated.""  If this is just about casual fans (lol) then sure but i really don't care who the casuals think is the most underrated player..."
"Andre Drummond for example, I'm having a tough time finding a team that would want him AND has the disposable contracts to send Cleveland's way. I could see them waiving him, and him signing with the Nets."
Where is Andre Drummond
"Assists &gt;&gt;&gt; Rebounds  I take the best floor general over Andre Drummond for sure. So many players can't really create their own shot against the best defenses, they absolutely need their teammates."
Andre Drummond
"I can’t remember if it was him or Andre Drummond, but iirc one player used VR to simulate a game setting to improve their free throws"
"Chris Paul denies player option, signs with BKN on vet min. BKN signs Drummond to vet min, Dinwiddies returns from injury. Imagine that   James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Joe Harris  Kevin Durant  Andre Drummond  Bench mob:  CP3  Dinwiddie  Bruce Brown  Blake Griffin  Claxton     the dankest timeline"
Nah u right it’d be so much better to have Boogie and Andre fucking Drummond demanding post touches and clogging up the paint for LeBron and AD on dogshit efficiency
"Huh, Blake Griffin isn’t Andre Drummond... big yikes when it comes to our centre’s."
Damn imagine being told you’re the backup choice for Andre Drummond
"Andre Drummond getting that cavs buyout, jus saying"
"Seems more like DJ was pouting not being THE center on the Nets with Jarrett Allen still there. Seems dumb but players have huge egos and can let this type of thing bother them, like Andre Drummond now with Jarrett Allen. For BG it's not his attitude or effort it's his physical limitations now."
"Andre Drummond, I’d miss like 5 shots consecutively and Hoover all of the OREB. Making the most of my single possession"
"Andre Drummond does not have the mentality to play for a contender. He always will try and do too much and hurt the team, rather than just sticking to his strengths"
"I totally get that the KD move was outrageous, and even I as a Warriors fan was kind of bummed when it happened. But say what you will about it, at least the core of the Warriors was drafted and developed in house.  This Laker team is so fucking lame on paper. Like I'm cool with LeBron exercising his right as the most important player in the league to dictate where he wants to go seemingly every few seasons...but to basically just stack the team is so whack. It's like some bully on the schoolyard in grade school, picking teams:  Last year's 6th man Harrell is disgruntled? GIMME.  Former DPOY and last year's champion Marc Gasol is available? MINE.  Former MIP candidate Dennis Schroeder is available? FUCK YOU, I WANT HIM TOO.  Perennial rebound leader Andre Drummond is free? DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT, HE'S MINE.  Just so square and boring."
Ehh I don’t think Dan Gilbert is concerned about saving a couple million. It all comes down to if Andre Drummond values rings or money more. He’ll lose his bird rights if they buy him out.
"The Golden State Warriors reportedly have interest in a trade for Victor Oladipo, according to Kevin O'Connor of The Ringer.  O'Connor noted this shows the team's plans to add another ball-handler in the mold of Andre Iguodala or Shaun Livingston, who each played key roles during the team's three NBA titles.  Oladipo has appeared in 15 games with the Houston Rockets since coming over in a January trade from the Indiana Pacers, averaging 19.9 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.7 assists with his new team.  The 28-year-old is set to become a free agent in the offseason.  Several big names have already changed teams this season, including James Harden heading to the Brooklyn Nets as part of a blockbuster four-team deal and Derrick Rose returning to the New York Knicks from the Detroit Pistons.   The Pistons are keeping Blake Griffin on the bench for the time being as they continue to explore trade opportunities for the six-time All-Star. The Cleveland Cavaliers are also holding Andre Drummond out of games in hopes of dealing him.   Teams will try to pursue other impact players such as Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine ahead of the March 25 deadline, while a young playmaker like Lonzo Ball or veteran role players like JJ Redick, George Hill and P.J. Tucker could all be on the move to help contenders.  For more NBA coverage, check out B/R's surprise landing spots for the league's top trade targets.

"Andre Drummond was top 8 in DPOY last year. You can get top 20 by someone voting you in as the 3rd option because they are insane.  Outside of the top 3/5, the voting is meaningless."
"I think there’s more to it than that. There really was a lull in talent at the position after Shaq. This became especially apparent in the early ‘10s. Tyson Chandler, Andrew Bynum, Deandre Jordan, Andre Drummond, Joakim Noah, were all on All-NBA teams despite being fringe all-stars at best.   The early 2000s was before the 3-Point revolution and yet centers were not winning. I’d go so far to say, outside of Shaq, there wasn’t that much of talent at the 5 in the early 2000s either"
Next year we should do an anti 3pt contest gimme Ben Simmons Giannis Rudy gobert Andre Drummond and Dwight Howard
"&gt; Per Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com, the Dallas Mavericks feel Love would fix the problems they have had with three-point shooting and defensive rebounding:  &gt;”A source with knowledge of the Mavericks' thinking suggested Kevin Love as a much better fit [than Andre Drummond] given the team's 3-point woes and desire to surround MVP candidate Luka Doncic with shooters. Love would also help boost Dallas' problematic defensive rebounding metrics. Still, the Mavericks have two appealing expiring contracts—Tim Hardaway Jr. ($18 million) and James Johnson ($16 million)—that would help facilitate a deal.""  I apologize for the shitty headline, but I didn’t want to editorialize the link - I tried googling other sources, but only found even shittier headlines.  A “strong” fit =\= a better fit than Drummond"
"So ""you can't win playing that style"" or "" It works today because it's more of a pick-and-roll league, so he gets away with a lot of things now"" which one is it ?  Btw the simple fact that he thinks the Celtics should trade for Andre Drummond just shows that he doesn't watch games anymore"
"&gt; ""If you know you can't pay him, you have to do a sign-and-trade and get a legitimate big. I think they should've went after Dwight Howard much harder, and you could've probably traded for Andre Drummond and added him to the group.""  How to torpedo your own argument 101"
"&gt; I think they should've went after Dwight Howard much harder, and you could've probably traded for Andre Drummond and added him to the group.""  Going to add ""Antoine Walker not being our GM"" to the list of things I'm thankful for."
"Two time All Star center Andre Drummond hugged them and said ""y'all look so different""."
I think that's why Andre Drummond got a vote for DPOY last year - dude thought he was voting for Drummond Green.
"Sure just skip by all the reasons I gave of why he *is* similar to Gasol and straight to the slow white Euro of which I said nothing. Again - like Gasol, Jokic is smart positionally and in terms of knowing what the opponent likes to do / opponent tendencies (something Andre Drummond is AWFUL at, and a part of why he gets lots of steals), he's good in the post, a good defensive rebounder, and very good at hedging or blitzing screens and then recovering to his man. This is part of why Denver has historically guarded Dame extremely well, for instance. Another reason he gets lots of steals is that is actually how he's best at protecting the paint and rim area. Instead of going for blocks he has a tendency to try to swipe at the gather and dribble while the ball is lower, and at passes in that area. He's a good defender, full stop - solidly above average on the whole. Remains underrated on that end despite the Nuggets defense consistently rating out better with him on the floor than off, and him rating out as a net positive in most defensive metrics, if only a small one in some of those (in a league where MANY players rate out negative, mind you)."
Lmao because they’re both slow white European centers? Jokic has good hands but he can’t protect the rim which is the most important thing for centers on defense. Gobert has won DPOYS by being good at just protecting the rim. Andre Drummond is always near the top in center steals and he’s not a good defender either.
"Im feeling hella generous, Andre Drummond for that bum straight up. Maybe someday down the line, you’ll do me a solid"
You could use a guy like Andre Drummond 😎
This sword cuts both ways    Andre Drummond
I forget his name cuz I blocked him on Twitter but the guy that voted for Andre Drummond dpoy
Andre Drummond
Rodman was actually the best rebounder in history statistically (rebounding %) until Andre Drummond came to the NBA.  Drummond has taken the mantle of best statistical rebounder now.
"As someone who watched Andre Drummond—a man with zero offensive skill set and a tendency to sleepwalk—average 18 points and 15 rebounds for an entire season, I'm relatively certain David Robinson would run completely buck wild.  Robinson averaged 30 &amp; 12 in the era of Hakeem, Shaq, Patrick, Zo, and Dikembe. One can only imagine what he'd do in a league where lanes are emptier and he has more freedom to utilize his unique strengths (speed &amp; athleticism at seven-foot-one)."
"Interestingly, the dunk contest has a history of catching a lot of players before their true ascent into super stardom, so it creates this perpetual cycle where it feels like there’s no stars entering each year only to look back in hindsight and realize there’s names everywhere.   Just in the last 10 years or so, all-star caliber contestants have included Dwight Howard, Zach LaVine, Victor Oladipo, Donovan Mitchell, Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Giannis Antetokounmpo, John Wall, Mason Plumlee, Damian Lillard, Paul George, Serge Ibaka, and Blake Griffin."
Almost all advance defensive stats are flawed andre Drummond led the league in 17-18 and 18-19
Andre Drummond and Chris Paul
Is Sabonis watching Andre Drummond film recently? That was embarrassing.
Andre Drummond. The bleacher report article told me it's a great idea
Can I interest you in Andre Drummond? ...Please?
Beats by andre drummond?
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d’anglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don’t think there’s ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
"Someone said that if u take away bill Russel’s accolades, Andre Drummond is the Better player"
"Cleveland, we have enough of your Andre Drummond pamphlets and don't need to hear the gospel of his scoring and rebounding prowess."
So you're saying you don't want to trade him for Andre Drummond?
"&gt;Point me to ine franchised where KP wouldnt be questioned.  questioned is totally fine and natural, I'd be worried if we didn't.   It's the delusional takes and outright hate that is ridiculous. Posts called ""Let's bully Porziņģis into playing better"" or posts saying we should trade Brunson and him for Andre Drummond, or equating him to a woman as some form of insult are just stupid.   It's no longer having rational basketball conversation and rather  has devolved into, I hate Kristaps Porziņģis because he's been not what we expected.   There was just recently a poll asking why do you hate Kristaps Porziņģis?  There was also a post of Luka's game winner and it was highlighting how Porziņģis' reaction wasn't good enough and how he is a locker room cancer because of that...   He's being scrutinized to the nth degree. Dude is averaging 21 &amp; 8, last year he averaged 20 &amp; 10 and played in 76% of the games. He came back early from his surgery and offensively has had his best season. His defense has struggled but he had no training camp and is working his way back to form.   Giving up on a player after 1.25 seasons is just ridiculous. It's not even like he's been bad, just not playing at his best level."
"Mavs fans are fucking toxic. It's gotten to the point whre Porziņģis and Rick Carlisle and now Josh Richardson (formerly Tim Hardaway Jr.) get hate and are diminished in their value/impact as a means of propping Luka up.   Luka is incredible. Very likely he goes down as the Mavs GOAT if he stays here long enough. He for sure has the skillset. But you don't need to blame everyone else to make him look better. That sub has just basically become a Luka hivemind and then a ""no we shouldn't fire Rick Carlisle, or trade Kristaps Porziņģis and a first round pick for Andre Drummond"" minority.   The amount of hate Kristaps gets on there is unreal. He's our 3rd player to average 20+ ppg since Michael Finley in 2002, but you'd think he was Erick Dampier the way folks complain about him. He's barely removed from knee surgery and is still averaging 21 &amp; 8 on 47/36/84. Jaren Jackson Jr. had the same surgery 2 months before him and still isn't even back on the court.   It's just super reactionary over there."
"Hey, I have a site where I make In-Depth NBA Player Profiles. Here are my two freshly posted player profiles from this week:  Dennis Schroder: [https://basketballbeacon.com/dennis-schroder-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/dennis-schroder-player-profile-stats/)  Andre Drummond: [https://basketballbeacon.com/andre-drummond-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/andre-drummond-player-profile-stats/)  If you like them, feel free to get on my mailing list - [https://basketballbeacon.ck.page](https://basketballbeacon.ck.page/)  Thanks."
"While I agree with your point about Tyson, is it really fair to say Powell's contract was undeserved? At the time of the extension he was leading the league with a 134.6 offensive rating, top ten for win shares, and averaged nearly 15 points and 8 rebounds after the All-Star break. He is the opposite of say, Andre Drummond, who tries to do too much - Powell stuck with what he was good at and did it well, consistently, while showing signs of improving his midrange game. He was good for a couple great alley-oops per game and was in that upper tier of mobility for guys his size. 3y/$33m really doesn't seem like an overpay for a team with championship aspirations.   That injury hit him at a terrible time and robbed him of what was shaping up to be the best years of his career."
"Congrats you’re on a hot streak, Cavs and Kings both had hot stretches too. Bad teams win games some times, doesn’t discount what happened the entire rest of the season. But if we want to use that criteria then I guess Andre Drummond was the second best player on a team that was “winning games” earlier this season."
Andre Drummond that guy was hitting full court shots every year
"I've posted this in other threads but my fantasy woes continue....  Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, Malik Beasley, Deandre Hunter, Mitchell Robinson along with random absences like Bertans, Herro, and Hayward."
PG: JaVale McGee  SG: Kevin Love  SF: Larry Nance Jr  PF: Jarrett Allen  C: Andre Drummond
"Jahlil Okafor, Andre Drummond, Enes Kanter, Greg Monroe, Steven Adams, Allen Iverson"
"Again, that’s fair. I wouldn’t recommend or expect anyone to take my basketball takes too seriously. But as a pretty “hardcore” basketball fan, I’d like the discourse around player quality to be better than it is currently. I’m not arrogant enough to claim to know how to accomplish that, but I like what Ben Falk (I believe it was him) said about analyzing players: eye test + context + stats.   And my point in replying here has to do with the third component of course - stats. Points, rebounds, and assists are outdated. What do those stats try to tell us - how good a player is at scoring, rebounding, and playmaking. But we have better stats these days to analyze all three skills. And by including rebounding, it’s implied that that skill is just as important as the other two. You just have to look at Andre Drummond to see that that’s absurd. And the “casual analysis” almost completely ignores defense."
Can I  interest you in a slightly used Andre Drummond?
Jarrett Allen is what Andre Drummond was supposed to be
The efficient Andre Drummond
This is what Andre Drummond thinks he can do when he takes the ball up the court
"Andre Drummond if you don’t actually watch games/just see stats.  I also think Kyrie Irving is slightly overrated, not nearly as much as I used to think, but still just enough to where I think many people rate him a bit too high"
"Commissioner decides the replacement, but Silver doesn't go with the PR pick, he's selected Kyle Korver, Andre Drummond, and Goran Dragic in the past you can't sit with a straight face and tell me it's what the fans want to see."
"If you’re one of the best big man dunkers in the league... deandre Jordan, capela, Andre Drummond... people don’t care when you can’t shoot 3s... well Steve Novak was 100% one of the best 3 point shooters the entire time he played in the league. So he gets a pass on being one dimensional"
I don’t think Andre Drummond would like playing 0 minutes in the all star game
You know who else is out tonight? Andre Drummond
"This is some ""Andre Drummond School of Running the Offense"" type bullshit."
Trading KP when his value is at its nadir is too stupid to believe it would actually happen  People got their ADs mixed up if they think Andre Drummond is gonna come in and fix those defensive issues
"Andre Drummond, the defensive savant"
"When I think of defensive minded, I don’t think of Andre Drummond"
Andre Drummond agrees
"That’s what I was trying to tell him, but he won’t understand. Efficiency is what determines empty stats. Andre Drummond is great example of empty stats"
Well if you just want to go by rebound rate the best rebounder ever is Andre Drummond. Rodman benefited massively from never finishing or being an offensive option at all.
"Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, Deandre Hunter, Mitchell Robinson, Tyler Herro, Gordon Hayward... ALL on my fantasy team."
You can also rebound by committee much more easily than you can get stops in the clutch. 4 ok rebounders and the best on ball defender will do much better than 4 ok defenders and a great rebounder. See exhibit a: any team Andre Drummond has ever played for.
“Name one current NBA player named Andre Drummond”
Andre Drummond is my MVP
5 years after he retires theres gonna be /r/nba posts like “TIL there was a player named Andre Drummond who was top 10 in rebounds” and then a comment saying he’d be the best center in the league if he played now
Casuals do not know who Andre Drummond is
"That's the same reasoning that resulted in guys like Dwight Howard and Andre Drummond thinking they need more post touches because they were shooting such a high percentage, when those 'shots' were wide open dunks half the time. When in reality their PPP on post touches is well below league average efficiency. Looking at overall shooting percentage isn't logical, it's about individual expected result based on the context of the possession."
Josh Smith and Andre Drummond
Are you thinking of Andre Drummond? He had a game where he was 13/36 one year. People think Giannis is bad..but Drummond was under 40% from the line every year the first 5 years in the league.
"There’s gonna be riots in the streets of Toronto when they find out Chris Boucher is older than Andre Drummond, Pascal is older than Wiggins and Julius Randle. There’s gonna be real carnage when they find out Malachi flynn is the same age as Jayson Tatum"
Why the hell does Jayson Tatum isolate so much? He's abysmal at it. He posts Andre Drummond tier efficiency on those possessions.
Andre Drummond gets his fair share of criticism in this sub but casuals outside of here think that he is one of the better centers in the league
Andre Drummond
Would you take a lightly used andre drummond Instead
"Drummond isnt on anywhere close to the same level as AD  Also its a volatile situation between the League and Dan Gilbert with the latter a constant threat to the entire operation. They push him to hard, he will go to press with evidence of everything from fixing games, to the CP3-Lakers situation, and of course the LeBron James saga. The NBA will become the WWE overnight. Andre Drummond isn’t worth that"
Nobody is showing up to the arena or turning on their TV to specifically see Andre Drummond play
"Considering we absolutely need more at center, and the only other option on the market St this point is Andre Drummond, I'd much rather have cheap, old boogie than expensive, crappy Drummond."
Nothing because Andre Drummond is not a ratings draw
Maybe Toronto if they can't get Andre Drummond?  I kinda feel bad for Cousins though. He couldn't stick with a team that can afford to take a risk on him. Not sure where his career goes from here.
"I will bring this up anytime the topic arises.  * Brandon Knight is 6'2"", 182 lbs. * DeAndre Jordan is 6'11"", 265 lbs. * Pau Gasol is 7', 250 lbs.  * Feb. 3, 2013 - Brandon Knight, with his team down three points about half way through the fourth quarter, goes up against Pau Gasol on a fast break. [Knight throws down on Gasol.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow9aUPd2srQ) Nobody says a word about it. * Mar. 10, 2013 - Clippers are the better team. Andre Drummond is still out injured. It's the second quarter, the Clippers are up by 19, Chris Paul (possibly the best passer in the league at the time) throws a lob. Charlie Villanueva is in so the defense is trash, and [Brandon Knight gets dunked on.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTkN2q6sUUk) It's considered the best dunk in years and people are still talking about it.  I will never give Brandon Knight shit for playing defense."
"You must've lost an avatar bet because no Raptor fan would actually want this pile of trash on our team lol. He can't shoot or defend, it'd be like we got Andre Drummond without the rebounding."
Wouldn't it be worth it to see if Andre Drummond is going to get bought out? I can't foresee anyone trading for that massive contract.
"Yeah, dodging the top tier opponents like the Cavs,  Pacers, Pistons, and Grizz. Those are the cream of the crop teams with big men that Embiid is terrified of. Isaiah Stewart and Andre Drummond are just too scary!"
Andre Drummond sends his regards
"Andre Drummond, Hassan Whiteside, Enes Kanter"
"I just grabbed one from each team, so some teams end up getting Andre Drummond as their rep and some teams don't get Harden or Anthony Davis shown."
Andre Drummond
James Johnson on Andre Drummond vibes.
"To be clear, that was still a rebound on 25% of all shots attempted THAT (average of 220 FGA per game in 1960), not just misses.  He nearly out rebounded the entire Celtics team 55-59.  In the 2021 NBA (178 FGA per game) that would be like Andre Drummond pulling down 44 rebounds in a game"
Not really related but back in the day when you can send photos to any user over Instagram I sent Andre Drummond dick pics the night before he played the Celtics. This was for multiple games and he would open my message every single time.
"These stats get it then, the non advanced stats can go bang Andre Drummond in an ally somewhere"
Andre Drummond fans be like
Watching the games does not = gut feeling. There are many aspects of basketball that do not translate well into stats  If you went off stats alone Hassan Whiteside and Andre Drummond would be better than Dray
&gt; I'd pick serious rim protector and rebounder that's more reliable than DeAndre Jordan. (ahem... Andre Drummond)  So...not Andre Drummond then?
Correction: Butler switches onto Andre Drummond are usually a recipe for a good shot.
"Fair, it's all pretty irrelevant in today's game anyways; Giannis is a power forward technically so I really don't put a ton of stock into positions anymore lol  And on that note I'd like to start the Andre Drummond for Point Guard GoFundMe, I'll be taking donations and all proceeds will assist in building houses; I'll be donating money, and Andre will be donating bricks."
"Wth you’re going to take Kobe over seeing a frontcourt of AD and KAJ?! What’s the bigger improvement, Kobe over KCP or KAREEM ABDUL JABBAR over Andre Drummond?"

"Definitely Adams for winning basketball  But some of the Drummond hate goes a little far.  Even with Steven being good at  offensive rebounding, I think Andre is still definitely better at it"
That was only because Andre Drummond kept goaltending the FTs.

Andre Drummond got that *DRUM*mond  If you know what I mean

"At this moment, the Andre Drummond experience owns"
Wdym Andre Drummond is playing
"Just as Lakers fans expected going into this season, they will be depending on Ben McLemore and Andre Drummond"
Yeah with Marc Gasol and now Andre Drummond as back ups? Lakers are huge and we will have a rebounding problem with our secondary.   I honestly think the suns can match up well and beat any team in the west. Lakers are hard to match up for everyone else; especially us.
"Love it, although it would be better to have the default be Per36. Gives a much different top 4, which makes sense with “hustle” being an attribute of sparkplug bench guys. Love Dipo and Sabonis but there’s no way they hustle more than TJ.  Per36:   1. Thaddeus Young   2. Andre Drummond   3. Draymond Green   4. TJ McConnell"

&gt; Why try making the playoffs when Andre Drummond is an important player on your team &gt;  You hear this LA?
Andre Drummond 😂
Andre Drummond is still good enough to make serious contributions to top teams
Yeah he should have just shot himself in the hand instead and started playing basketball lefty in egypt. Why try making the playoffs when Andre Drummond is an important player on your team
These 2 are better than Andre Drummond.  Lakers recruited the wrong players in the buyout market. Nobody is beating Brooklyn this year.   Crazy thing is they will have Spencer Dinwiddle next year.🤦🏾‍♂️
"Apparently if you do that, but are Andre Drummond, according to this sub you are not worth rostering."
Don’t disrespect 2016 all-star Andre Drummond.
"&gt; we’re not a superteam  ""not a superteam"" yet have two superstars and a bunch of former all-stars like Marc Gasol, Andre Drummond just like the Nets. Oh wait Gasol is washed? Just like LMA and Blake Griffin lol."
Andre Drummond lite
Who is even the Lakers best player? Andre Drummond?
There's not a single team in the league giving Andre Drummond even half of a max contract.
"Wow. Fantastic small move from a competent front office. It's refreshing to see us Knicks not doing something up-the-wall crazy. Nothing is ridiculous and we're not reaching for stars to fix everything. Mitch Rob went out of the season with injury, and instead of signing someone like Boogie Cousins or trading for Andre Drummond, we just get a small name to plug some holes temporarily, and see how well they play."
andre drummond is not a superstar nephew hours are early today
"His handle looks amazing for his size wow. Looks like Andre Drummond if his shit worked ngl. He definitely was not doing that routinely before the bubble, I think Memphis may flourish as they give him bigger roles that’s not just him spotting up"
Gotta be Andre Drummond
100% Andre Drummond
Think I saw a post about Andre Drummond here a few weeks ago that was pretty bad
"Lebron on Andre Drummond: ""In the locker room he’s like, 'These are the easiest baskets I’ve gotten in my whole career.'"""
"Man, Lakers fans are delusional and get wrapped up in their own fandom. Schroder on FVV's level? And this from half a season of watching Schroder. This like Jeanie Buss welcoming Andre Drummond like he Abdul-Jabbar. Lakers really on some clown level ish. All them years talking bad about LeBron but the jersey colour changes the opinion quick. Laker fans fickle as F***."
&gt;our two superstars Wesley Matthews and Andre Drummond  &gt;not a joke  What?
Flippers fans celebrating like we weren't missing our two superstars Wesley Matthews and Andre Drummond 🤣🤣
andre drummond is a lob threat?
Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond in shambles
"No, because Andre Drummond and Whiteside would be getting paid much more if you just looked at stats. Kobe would be a better defender in today’s league with his ability to guard the 1 - 3 and the added spacing would help his his playmaking. Not that hard.  I said I doubted he average over 35 minutes per game, not that he couldn’t like last comment said as most stars don’t. Lol  Next comment after that one I said he wouldn’t be averaging 40 minutes per game. Never argued that he couldn’t average 35. After that comment I said he could average over 35, but 40 like I said."
Are we gonna pretend Randle wasn't getting talked about like Andre Drummond before this year?
This is year one of a tank. They had a ton of bad contracts and bad draft picks thanks to Stan Van Gundy. He mortgaged they’re whole future and money to build a team around Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond.  This is a complete year down.
He's plenty useful clogging up the key on defense.  He's plenty useful as a wide body setting screen.  He's plenty useful rebounding on both ends of the floor.  He's plenty useful catching lobs from LeBron (or whoever).  Post isos for Andre Drummond would literally make your team worse.  You're way off.
Has Gasol watched Andre Drummond play before?
"Did you watch our games this year? Sexton is our go-to scorer and he's way better at it than Drummond. Garland's better too. Nance and Love both are as well when there healthy. Sexton and Garland and Nance are all very strong facilitators as well. I mean, just the fact that you said that makes it clear you haven't watched any of our games this year, which means you haven't watched any of Drummond's games this year, which completely invalidates literally everything you said. He is solid at getting steals for a big, but he's not even the best stealing big on our team (that would be Nance). And steals per game and blocks per game are not measures of good defenders; Hassan Whiteside and Steph Curry have led the league in blocks and steals per game, respectively, and neither of them can guard a fence post. He didn't even run the pick and roll for us that much, so I have no idea where you're getting all of this from. Most of our shooting comes from Sexton slashing. I never said anything about Marc Gasol. I think he's not a stating level center in the league anymore. But I can tell you, having watched Tristan Thompson and Andre Drummond each many, many times, that Tristan is a better player. You'll see once Drummond plays with the Lakers, since I assume you'll watch those games. He tricks people who only look at his box score. He's worth the contract the Lakers are paying him, but not much more."

"This is just so wrong...Lol the difference between Gordon and Drummond being the same different between MPJ and AD lol... Also, Jokic can't be on the same tier of LBJ. LBJ is the reigning finals MVP on a team that won the championship. Was the MVP leader before injury etc.   Gordon isn't all that and a bag of chips he's the 4th guy on a top team in the west. Andre being the 3rd/4th guy will be looking just as good if not better once everyone returns. Also, what even is your list? You are not comparing players based on talent on their team nor based on position so... You can't just cherry pick who you compare, either compare players on the same level or position."
"I feel like you are over simplifying something that is super complicated.    Better to not try to compare individual players.  The obvious place to start is AD+Bron versus Jokic+Murray, start with the stars.  Edge Lakers there for sure, but not by much, especially with the Lakers being banged up.  But when you start adding the rest of the pieces I think it swings Nuggets, MPJ+Gordon+Barton versus KCP+Dennis+Andre is very very Nuggets favored.    Is the gap between AD+Bron (assuming 100%) and Jokic+Murray bigger than the gap between MPJ+Gordon+Barton over KCP+Schroder+Drummond?  Pretty hard argument to make, imo.  And again, that is assuming the Lakers get back to 100%.    That is just straight up starters of course.  From what we have seen from the two teams benches the total package has to skew Lakers, the Nuggets second unit has been a gaping wound all year long(one that we hope will be sutured by JaVale and getting Morris back)."
"Idk Lakers Have... Dennis, KCP, Bron, AD, Andre Drummond.   Bron &gt; Jokic  AD &gt;&gt; Murry   Andre &lt; MPJ   Dennis &gt;= Aaron Gordon  KCP &lt; Barton   So the best players on the lakers are better than the best on the nuggets while the other 3 players are all pretty close with slight edges to nuggets players."
"People don’t understand this. Look at a player like Ryan Hollins. 7 foot athletic freak. Long jumper in college. If he played in the 60s like just plopped in, suddenly he’s that dominant player because no one can stop his athleticism. Watch clips of Andre Drummond in a pickup game and he literally looks like the best player to walk the earth."
Isn’t the obvious answer Andre Drummond?

"That if u take away Bill Russels accolades, Andre Drummond is the better player"
"Coaches and other players also think Kobe has a case over Lebron. Which is absolute nonsense.   Almost no one is combing through old take with painstaking detail and judging the full scope of subtle defensive mistakes or impact. Players will swear by Jrue Holiday being the a top 3 defender in the league when that’s clearly not the case.   DPOY voting is clearly nonsense and narrative based, for gods sake Andre Drummond received votes for DPOY.   Ben Taylor is the only guy publicly out there who has made use of the best available advanced metrics that go beyond DWS or individual DRTG, as well as looked at that much footage.   You can disagree with his opinion but he’s put forward the most well formed assessment out there specifically on this."
"This the same dude who went all in on making noise about Andre Drummond sitting out, while bringing up random points that made no sense for his argument, and not knowing that Drummond and the Cavs came to an agreement about sitting out.   Draymond is just a talker who sounds like he's saying something smart because he's so confident, but when you disect his words you realise that he doesnt make sense."
Andre Drummond looks wack af
"Ah a fan of the team who got Lebron and AD because of their city’s location and 27 year old Andre Drummond for 700k is against changing the rules, how shocking."
Thats the sad part. Do we go for a playoff push? Shld have made some trades maybe andre drummond then. Do we tank? Then trade beal and westbrook instead of wasting their years. And also tank properly so we can get a top 4 pick not just top15. God we suck.
They should have signed defensive juggernaut Andre Drummond
Nobody made Detroit trade for Blake Griffin - a trade everybody at the time thought was a terrible idea. Nobody made Detroit give Andre Drummond a shitload of money when the flaws in his game were obvious. Nobody made Cleveland *trade* for Andre Drummond when he was obviously in I Don't Give A Shit Mode for the foreseeable future.  The problem isn't that Detroit and Cleveland are small markets. The problem is that they have shitty front offices whose only solution to literally every problem they create is to whine about how better teams are better than them.
It's weird that Andre Drummond news is newsworthy now.
"I get what you’re saying, but there are some discussions that are just too obvious to have. We really going to argue who’s better between Giannis and Andre Drummond?  Zion is scoring more than Tatum on 10% higher TS, it’s too far apart."
Andre Drummond and JJ Redick
The Lakers got andre mother fuckin’ Drummond why is anyone pressed by this?
https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2869802-report-andre-drummond-traded-to-cavs-from-pistons-for-brandon-knight-more.amp.html
"Backup PG =&gt; Brunson  Consistency =&gt; Too vague so I don't know what you mean by that  Rebounding =&gt; Who should we trade for? Andre Drummond, Hassan Whiteside, Clint Capela , Enes Kanter , Dwight Howard, Tristan Thompson?  I suppose we should offer their current team all our first round picks and give them a max contract post trade.  I think you are searching too hard for holes. Mavs don't need to be perfect to become champions. A little better team than right now and with some winners luck, they can get it done."
They literally had a pregame show about Andre Drummond and his first game as a Lakers.  The media is a joke it's all about big market. Nobody said a word about Drummond when he was in Cleveland and Detroit. Now all of a sudden he's the missing piece for the Lakers.🤦🏾‍♂️
"I mean rookies are very rarely considered even average players in comparison to the whole NBA. Especially not Anthony Edwards. I don't see the surprise that Wolves are bad when they made him the first option for a big part of the season.   Edwards has the lowest true shooting percentage in the league among guys with such high usage; lower even the infamous chuckers like Russell Westbrook or Andre Drummond. The fun fact is that he doesn't even stand out that much in a team with Rubio, Okogi, McDaniels, Nowell or McLaughlin.  They're a bad team, although they are closer to average when they have Karl-Anthony Towns fit. Either way they will be among worst defences, but with KAT they are closer to average offensively.   Yeah they're tanking, I guess it was not the plan when they'd got Rubio or D'Angelo, but these guys didn't change nothing and it turned out like always."
"&gt; most of the reason he fell to 16 was that teams knew he would struggle to play due to anxiety tho. he would have gone top 5 easily  This is just revisionist history.  In a draft with Anthony Davis, MKG (lol), Bradley Beal, Andre Drummond, and Harrison Barnes -- all of whom were one and done elite prospects -- as well as Dion Waiters and Damian Lillard, no one was going to pick 21 year-old Royce White in the top 5.  And Thomas Robinson, the actual Player of the Year in White's conference, was also picked ahead of him.  He was a fringe top 10 pick with no baggage."
Andre drummond will average however many points he gets tonight for the entire season and he eats doodoo
You are Andre Drummond &amp; Marc Gasol is the guy she tells you not to worry about
Andre Drummond tonight:  4 points 🤑  2/6 🎯  1 rebound 💪  2 assists 🧠  3 turnovers 😈  4 fouls 📈  -8 🔥  Lakers got their guy.
"Andre Drummond only got 9 toes rn, ill take The Dream pls"
Brb gotta update that Andre Drummond wikifeet page
Can't believe the media has hyped up Andre Drummond of all players.😂🤣  This dude isn't a game changer. He looks like another guy. He will help rebounding and as a lob threat. Other than that why the hell is the media overreacting to this signing?
The Andre Drummond experience. Just needs more touches. A LOT more.
He played with Andre Drummond.
"I tried to tell fools the only use Andre Drummond got is grabbing rebounds. If you're banking on his offensive game, you're going to have trouble winning a lot of games."
This is how he looks literally 100% of the fuckin time.  See for yourself: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=andre+drummond+smart+highlights
What’s the over under on games Andre Drummond will start for the Lakers  ?
"Andre Drummond's first game and we set a season high for 3s made in a quarter.  Coincidence? Yeah, but I will still give all credit to Drummond."
Schroder only made that because Andre Drummond was the passer
I play like a 5’10 Andre Drummond without the rebounding
I know media companies are tying to save money and maybe no one cares about previews ... but came here looking for some info on Andre Drummond but I guess the automation couldn’t recognize that storyline. Just empty stats about Lebrun and AD.
"You can't play like shit, then complain your way out of town to a situation you want.  That's just not how sports work.  AD and Jrue got to where they wanted because they are all stars.    Ok, he misses his family, completely understandable.  So does over half the league because of the Covid rules.    It's not the teams fault no northeast teams were jumping in for a $13m below average player.  If the Pistons could have traded Blake Griffin, they would have.  If the Cavs could have traded Andre Drummond, they would have"
"Amazing that Griff’s protege, Koby Altman, did right by Andre Drummond by giving him his buy-out, but somehow, Griff doesn’t “get it??”  Will be interesting to see if JJ actually plays with the Mavs..."
"&gt; Why isn't this reflected in the advanced stats?   It is, which is why he is lower in RAPTOR.  &gt; You know that Randle doesn't just isolate and score or stand next to the rim or something? If that's what it was, then why wouldn't everyone do it? He is playing as a point-forward, where he initiates a lot of offence and makes plays for others   That the biggest part of his value? It's exactly what he brings to the table that Zion doesn't. Zion can't do that despite dominating the ball.   &gt; Defensive catch-all metrics are really poor at judging individual defensive impact, do you actually think that Randle is a top 40 defensive player in the NBA this year? That same metric also has Christian Wood as the 6th best defender in the league, Andre Drummond 16th, all ahead of players Adebayo and Giannis at 50th, and Simmons 53rd   Wait so when you bring up advanced metrics to highlight Zions value that is all good, but the metrics lie when they highlight Randles value. That's pretty convenient.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; This is just silly. There are players in the NBA who's entire job is to catch lobs or do a specific thing on defence. You think Zion, who is a playmaking freak athlete, with elite body control, and finishing who is capable of attacking in a variety of situations over or around a variety of defences is the most one dimensional player in the league   Basically all of the players can play defense, or rebound extremely well, or stretch the floor. Zion can do none of those things.   &gt; He also does so much less efficiently, I also don't believe he is such a better distributor. Zion initiates offence from the other baseline and creates off the dribble from beyond the arc more frequently and I believe with more ability than Randle   You are literally contradicting yourself here. Like you said Randle runs the offense, Zion absolutely doesn't, Zion receives the ball and then attacks, that is basically all he does. Which is why Randle has almost twice as many assists as Zion.   &gt; But it seems like the Knicks don't actually win many games because of the offence that he primarily runs   They win more games than the Pelicans so by that logic is worse.      &gt; This is also why 538 thinks that the Pelicans will actually win 1 more game than the Knicks by the end of the season. But yeah, Randle is a winner while Zion isn't because one of them has a handful more wins than the other   Hypotheticals, hypotheticals, hypotheticals.      Randle isn't the winner because the Knicks won a handful more games. He is the winner because he is the more complete player who has taken a much worse team to a better record, while playing better in every area besides scoring. Pelicans is stock full of talent. Their entire starting lineup is full of young stars or capable NBA players like Adams, and yet they lose. The second best player on the knicks is an inefficient sophomore guard, the third best player is who? Some rookie? Reggie Bullock?"
"&gt;Zion doesn't ALSO do anything. He scores 3 more points, that is it. He is worse at every other thing than Randle.  Why isn't this reflected in the advanced stats?  &gt;To score. He plays like a 1984 big man, he can't shoot. He literally attempts 0,1 attempts from outside 9 feet, which is only a viable strategy because they have a ton of talented offensive players, who can pick up the slack and stretch the floor, Randle isn't so lucky.  You know that Randle doesn't just isolate and score or stand next to the rim or something? If that's what it was, then why wouldn't everyone do it? He is playing as a point-forward, where he initiates a lot of offence and makes plays for others  The Pelicans are 23rd in the league in 3pr, they aren't shooting them at a high rate. The offensive talent around him is better than Randle's, but is it 18 spots better on offence better?   Zion also plays with a traditional big, but like you said manages to score the vast majority of his baskets at the rim. It's not like he catches them all there, Zion attacks downhill and he attacks in transition in a way that other teams aren't really able to stop  &gt;Randle is the highest defensively ranked Knick  No one actually thinks that Randle is the best defensive Knick  &gt;is ranked as the 40 best defensive player in the NBA according to RAPTOR  Defensive catch-all metrics are really poor at judging individual defensive impact, do you actually think that Randle is a top 40 defensive player in the NBA this year? That same metric also has Christian Wood as the 6th best defender in the league, Andre Drummond 16th, all ahead of players Adebayo and Giannis at 50th, and Simmons 53rd  &gt;And if offense was somehow all that mattered that would be a good argument  You just said that Zion doesn't play winning basketball, but Randle doesn't. Is your argument now that the reason Randle plays winning basketball but Zion doesn't because of their defence? So Zion plays winning basketball on offence, but then because of his defence his basketball is no longer winning?  &gt;He is the most one dimensional player in the league.   This is just silly. There are players in the NBA who's entire job is to catch lobs or do a specific thing on defence. You think Zion, who is a playmaking freak athlete, with elite body control, and finishing who is capable of attacking in a variety of situations over or around a variety of defences is the most one dimensional player in the league  &gt;Randle is a better defender, rebounder, distributor and scores 3 fewer points while playing with worse offensive talent and winning more games  He also does so much less efficiently, I also don't believe he is such a better distributor. Zion initiates offence from the other baseline and creates off the dribble from beyond the arc more frequently and I believe with more ability than Randle  Nevertheless, if Randle is so much better in all of these areas, why doesn't it show up in the advanced stats?  As you said   &gt;Randle Is the primary offensive player on a team that actually wins games  But it seems like the Knicks don't actually win many games because of the offence that he primarily runs  -  There's also the fact that the Knicks probably aren't any better than the Pelicans?  The Knicks are currently 1 game over .500, the Pelicans are 4 games under. But the Knicks for the season actually have a negative point differential while the Pelicans have a positive one. This is while the Pelicans play a much tougher schedule than the Knicks which is reflected in Bball references SRS which takes into account schedule and gives the Pel's a 1.1 and the Knicks a -0.3.  This is also why 538 thinks that the Pelicans will actually win 1 more game than the Knicks by the end of the season. But yeah, Randle is a winner while Zion isn't because one of them has a handful more wins than the other"
Andre Drummond/Greg Monroe/Josh Smith big 3 was something else though. I thought at the time that Monroe will be a good player for a long time.
Every time I read the comments on a Andre Drummond post I swear it’s the same joke every time
"I hate that someone can get in the Hall of Fame for being a moderately good player who just happened to grow up in a huge country.   Yao was injured all the time. He never made All NBA First Team. He never won an NBA championship. He even won less Chinese Basketball Association titles than Stephon Marbury. But because nationalistic pride brings money to the NBA, he got in. And I won’t even go into the whole part where that nationalistic pride and money made the NBA a complicit partner with an authoritarian regime that put Muslims in internment camps.   It would be like seeing Andre Drummond get in the Hall Of Fame if he just happened to come from a big country."
AD just signed with the lakers and people putting him in top5 already smh let Andre Drummond play first
Andre Drummond has not done well historically against Bam. What are you talking about…
"If I've learned anything this and last season, it's that players that are motivated, and moved to a good squad will typically play a lot more effectively - e.g. Blake, Andre Drummond, PJ Tucker"
"Here’s another player: Andre Drummond  Raptor: 19th  EPM: 28th  LEBRON: 15th  Since your a Lakers fan, I think we can conclude that Drummond is in fact not one of the top defensive centers in the league, in fact far from it, despite how much the Lakers would want him to be."
PG: Lebron   SG: MJ  SF: KD  PF: Tim Duncan  C: Andre Drummond
"You’re all good, just realllllly don’t want that energy anywhere out there in the universe. I don’t even wanna imagine Walton creating plays centered around Andre Drummond for like 45 minutes a game.  I’m actually not from Sacramento—I’m from even further Northern California—BUT in general NorCal has a lot of embrace for the old gold mining/pioneer days. So while I don’t know how Sacramentans view old town, in my experience a lot of those festivals and preserved pieces of old California history aren’t generally seen as too gimmicky by many locals. I’ve been to old town and thought it was cool, personally."
"I was going to joke about Andre Drummond being on your high school team but then I realized that you said ""monster in the paint."""

"Stick Andre Drummond in the lineup &amp; keep Bron &amp; AD out &amp; y’all gonna be asking yourselves: “Do Bron and AD need to come back before the playoffs?????” Yes, Andre Drummond is LIKE THAT."
"Ok so, we had the ""LMAOOOOO IDIOTS THOUGHT ANDRE DRUMMOND WAS A NET NEGATIVE TO THE LAKERS! WHAT A DUMB NARRATIVE!"" narrative and hivemind come out for a few days when AD balled out.  Then, recently, the ""LMAOOOOOOOOO IDIOTS THOUGHT ANDRE DRUMMOND WAS A NET POSITIVE TO THE LAKERS! HE'S SO BAD! MARC GASOL IS GOATED, PLAY HIM INSTEAD PLEASE!"" narrative and hivemind come out and lasted awhile.   Now, will we have the ""LMAOOOOOO IDIOTS THOUGHT ANDRE DRUMMOND WAS A NET NEGATIVE!

I suspect with the potential of the Play In, if the Lakers match up with the Suns, Drummond might ball out against a weaker opposition so the 3rd narrative will continue. If they match up against the Jazz, the 2nd narrative might come back."
I’m going to guess we have Andre Drummond to thank for that?
"Andre drummond with the +9, 20 pts, and 10 rb...totally expected lol. What did I miss?"
"you sure about that? Lakers got a big 3 three themselves of CaruGOAT, THT and Andre Drummond"
He needs to improve his finishing not through contact lmao. Dude is andre drummond without hops at the rim
And I suppose signing Andre Drummond was a better idea? LMAOOO
"mods took down my andre drummond post since ""no source"" i literally went to lakers schedule and counted the record since signing andre drummond"
"I think you tell the league what name you want to go by and they usually agree. (I imagine if Andre Drummond wanted to be become Shitface McReboundPussy Adam Silver would slap him). But guys like Juan Toscano-Anderson can choose to just have Toscano on the back, or in baseball Giancarlo Stanton went by Mike (middle name) for a few years before switching to his first name, or BJ Upton who went by that nickname for a longtime before switching to his real name Melvin. Then guys like Buster Posey who goes by his nickname, his real name is Gerald.   Don’t know why three baseball examples came to me but it’s the same difference."

"You making jokes now lol? People have been waiting for Wiggins to pan out for what like 7-8 years now? How many big production playoff games as he had in his career? Im seriously interested because I havent watched much minny basketball.   Draymond absolutely cant shoot  and that makes him a liability. He is basically a poor man's Dennis Rodman, but even Dennis Rodman was a winner who was never a quitter. Draymond is going to need to learn how to shoot otherwise good teams are going to treat him like he's Andre Drummond, no joke. Every team thats clinched for the playoffs have at least 2-3 superstars and a solid squad after that. The GSW as of today ....  are the definition of a 1 MAN TEAM. But hey as cavs fan will tell you, there is always next year!"
"Bro Andre Drummond looked like a fucking 7ft point guard in high school, that doesn't mean shit for his ability to be a competent pg in the nba"
"Fine because we have LeBron James and Anthony Davis. The only things I’m worried about are chemistry, health and Andre Drummond missing a million wide open shots at the rim"
All my homies love Andre Drummond tonight
My biggest fear for the playoffs is that Andre Drummond sees big minutes
Same but Andre Drummond
tonight i've learned that the way to get along with lakers fans is to insult andre drummond
"Andre Drummond, he was an all-star and I almost forgot it"
Have you seen Andre Drummond
Put Andre drummond in the 60s and he will average 30 rebounds a game
Definitly Andre Drummond he would average a quadruple double in 19 minutes of play.
Andre Drummond let's goooooo    Lmao
“You miss 100% of the shots you never take.. unless you’re Andre Drummond. They’ll always miss”.
Andre Drummond needs to learn that you can use the backboard to put your layup in
So he wouldn’t be that good if he were to play with Andre Drummond?
That’s honestly kinda true. KD has quietly been ridiculous this year and we see first take talk about Andre Drummond. Tatum dropped 60 in the third largest comeback ever and nothing. It’s honestly stupid.
"What you probably mean is that basketball is the easiest to pick up that a complete novice can become pro in a few years of training, but you can't do that with other sports.  And the reason for that is that Height + Athleticism is 90% of the game. Even Kwame Brown and Andre Drummond can have relatively long careers despite them being so awfully skilled. You can't get away being unskilled in World football, you definitely need technique."
Yeah like even Andre Drummond is weirdly good at half court heaves but in game is a different story for most guys
"Yeah shows how far you can get in the NBA as long as you have good BBIQ, play within the system and hustle hard.  It's insane that there are 7 footers with crazy athleticism who don't grasp that. Kevon Looney is legitimately a better player than Andre Drummond, I wish I was joking."
Poor guy was murdered by the Andre Drummond wannabe
"Who is better though, andre Drummond or chris paul? Pretty close"
Same with the last 8 years of Andre Drummond and Chris Paul if you combine them
"We had a decade span where we had 3 all-time terrible FT shooters having large roles in their teams in Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan, and Andre Drummond. All 3 of them were kinda competing for those terrible FT records. I'm pretty sure they've changed the rules so its harder for them to rack up FTs like that, and I don't think we're gonna have any players be as consistently terrible at FTs as them in the future. Pretty safe record tbh."
the challenge :andre drummond
"I think folks are beginning to see the light with Andre Drummond but generally speaking, yes, he's been an overrated rebounder for much of his career, particularly over the past few years.  For one, rebounding totals are inflated for certain players these days in comparison to previous generations. The paint is emptier than it's ever been and the few bigs still hanging around inside can generally have their pick of defensive boards with little competition. For better or worse, you're not really running into Patrick Ewing-Charles Oakley-Charles Smith front lines these days where all three are chilling in the paint bodying dudes up all night and divvying up rebounds along the way.  Drummond's also not a big ball pursuit type of guy. The defensive boards he cleared in Detroit were generally in the vicinity of the paint and often uncontested (as alluded above). If he didn't grab them, Marcus Morris or Aron Baynes or Christian Wood seemingly would have just as well in many cases.   Drummond's inflated offensive boards situation is well documented by now. He *does* miss a lot of gimmies that he then tips back in (at which point he'll sometimes miss again). However, I also think this is where he's been the biggest asset. There was a time when the Pistons had a semblance of an offense (healthy Reggie Jackson era) and they hummed best when Detroit could push tempo knowing Andre would be running the floor to convert a back-breaking tip-in off a teammate's miss in transition. *That's* why he was named an all-star in 2016; he was mostly staying in his lane and filling in his team's gaps.   By and large though, having lived through the Dennis Rodman Pistons era and the Ben Wallace Pistons era, Drummond's true rebounding instincts and skills cannot hold a candle to either of those two."
How has Andre Drummond been doing?
At the end of the day if rebounding is your only feature that stands out you're probably not that great of a center.  Clint Capela is what Andre Drummond should be.
Some of you act like Drummond hasn't been an all-star before.  Like we know what *good* Andre Drummond looks like already.
Andre Drummond lol
"There are teams that would improve by adding Andre Drummond, they just aren't in the NBA."
Andre Drummond
His ceiling is Bismack Biyombo. His floor is Andre Drummond.
This is where Andre Drummond will be playing next year
"Andre ""The Cooler"" Drummond.... no wonder his ""nickname"" is an arctic animal lol"
"I’ve never seen an nba player walk as much as Andre Drummond does during the game. Like not traveling, but literally walking around the court. His screens might as well not even be there either, it’s like he’s going out if his way to avoid any contact at all."
Andre Drummond is healthy
*quietly packages Andre Drummond into a USPS box. Shipped retail ground. No tracking number. No return to sender. No return address. Please don’t return him.
You have a point. Andre Drummond would be a great player if he was Hakeem.
"Andre Drummond isn't really worth remembering, too be fair. That Davis guy tho. Whew. He should be the real AD."
"""*I'm just here to get a ring.*"" - Andre Drummond"
"One of the best r/nba posts of the season was the Drummond video showing how sh!t he is around the rim and his turnovers. There were 856329 posts telling Lakers &amp; NBA-in-general fans that Andre was a net negative player, despite their hope for a rebounding/rim runner big."
Andre “Kwame Hands” Drummond
andre drummond...wow...
That Andre Drummond miss layup is just making me sick
Andre Drummond top 5 most hated player in the league rn lol
Makes sense Andre Drummond isn't that good a player and they have had a lot of injuries to their actually good players.
We are not repeating if we play Andre Drummond any more than garbage time minutes.
Andre Drummond is a bonafide scrub
"Whenever he's playing, it looks like the Los Angeles Lakers featuring Andre Drummond. Dude does whatever he wants and doesn't have the greatest IQ. He's a big bodied meathead trying to force the action instead of going with the flow."
Andre Drummond never met a ball he couldn't drop
"Eh tbf, Andre Drummond is not that big of a name.  Giannis Antetokounmpo, now that's a big name."
"Fuck Andre Drummond. All he does is steal minutes from Gasol.   PS, not biased at all"
you sure Andre Drummond was the reason for these lost?
The last time they made the playoffs was because of Blake. You act like the dude wasn’t crippled with injuries and playing with Andre fucking Drummond as his second best player. Get real
"The two examples you listed—the '95 Rockets and the '69 Celtics—had both won just the year before, so the Lakers aren't really making history if they're in the same boat.  And besides, the Lakers' biggest obstacle isn't history, it's health. Health... and Andre Drummond. They were a top team, some would say the favorites, before the injuries."
soo many people mad cuz andre drummond is winning in life and their not Hahah
"Andre Drummond is easily a top 15 center in the league , stop the disrespect over 16 games no less . So ungrateful , stop being a hater and wake up...players go into slumps  ."
Was Kyle Korver playing like an all-star in 2015? Definitely not. Was he a positive impact player? Certainly. Andre Drummond is a liability and negative value player in 2021.
"""I used to think basketball was a beautiful game, but now... I am not so sure""- Marc Gasol announcing his retirement after being forced to sit through 30 games of Andre Drummond this year"
"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Andre Drummond. The touch around the rim is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the shots will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Drummond's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Brian Scalabrine's playstyle, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these shots, to realise that they're not just amazing - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Drummond truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Drummond's existential catchphrase ""I fucking suck at basketball,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Scalabrine's epic The White Mamba. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Rob Pelinka's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂  And yes, by the way, I DO have a Andre Drummond tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎"
Go find the thread where “almost everyone” was saying Andre fucking Drummond was going to carry the team. I’ll wait.
"I said this last time, but remember when Blake griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge and Andre Drummond all got bought out and signed with big teams and everyone acted like they were top 10 players? I got so much shit on this sub for saying that non of those guys will have a big impact, and look at them now lol."
"&gt;In the first quarter, Rhodes reluctantly sent her in after a timeout. She inbounded the ball to teammate Bobby Rascoe, who immediately called a timeout, and she returned to the bench to a standing ovation  Still better production than Andre Drummond."
Infinitely better than Andre Drummond. Lakers made a  big mistake
I’m an Andre Drummond Stan and simply wasn’t a fan of the Lakeshow^TM until my big penguin lover arrived
That's 2018 all-star andre drummond stop the disrespect
Who needs Dwight Howard when you can have legendary Andre Drummond
"Depends, does the coach of that team play Andre Drummond ?"
"The Jazz are going to annihilate the Lakers. Have you seen the Lakers lately?  AD looks horrible, Lebron is hurt, Kuzma is shooting 0 for 100, and Andre Drummond is in their starting 5."
Andre Drummond gonna be the goat laker killer this year.   Even if in the playoffs.
"  &gt;Honestly he’s worse than Andre Drummond.   Better than Drummond  &gt;First of all he has 0 offense.   Neither does Drummond  &gt;All he can do is jump up and dunk.   Drummond can’t even do that.  &gt;On the defensive end, he can’t stay focused and ball watches all the time. He can block some shots but that’s about it.   Same for Drummond  &gt;What’s worse is he is a terrible rebounder which is a big part of defense. He just seems to never have any idea which way the ball is gonna bounce off the rim so he is always out of position for rebounds.  Same for Drummond."
"Bruh, let me tell you about a man named Andre Drummond"
this is because  *sips tea*  andre drummond is bad
Spot up 3 point shooter Andre Drummond incoming!
"This kid is special.  If I was the TWolves,  I'd try and get an Andre Drummond type defensive/rebounding minded center, move KAT to the pf and with Ant, this team will easily be a 4-5 seed."
I’m starting to think Andre Drummond isn’t very good
Andre Drummond is balls  Next up: OP is a nephew
He won’t need to guard Andre Drummond lol
The Lakers record with Andre Drummond as a starter: 5-11.  He stinks and is legitimately going to sink this team.
Andre Drummond T_T
"Listen man, I don’t know what to tell you if you think there’s people on this sub giving Ben the work in a jump shot contest on a regular ass court. I don’t think y’all understand the difference between the two. I don’t know if I’m Being trolled or people here are that delusional. Andre Drummond has maybe the worst handle and shot in the league and misses from one foot away. Look at his high school clips against top Comp, he had insane handle and was hitting jump shots and running point.    I feel like I’m taking crazy pills. No one here could touch Ben Simmons in a jump shot competition. Get a grip."
Ben Simmons = Andre Drummond  Both have become exposed
Sorry you're paying 40 million dollars for Andre Drummond+5. Hopefully you can get some better talent around Mitchell.
Is Ben Simmons just Andre Drummond with better ball handling?
An Andre Drummond statline will never tell you anything about how the actual game went.
For some reason in 2k last time I check he’s still an 80 or a high 70 lmao. The likes of Andre Drummond is an 83 the same rating as kyle lowry lmao
Suns add Andre Drummond to run point.
"What happened in NOLA? The way I see it, it's more team construction and a very young roster than bad coaching. There's an Andy Hoops video talking about the Pelican's disappointing season.  And Detroit? I mean c'mon, were they really gonna win with a terrible Andre Drummond as a franchise piece. His game never changed, his motor is in and out especially after the Allen trade on my Cavs."
"You think SVG holds his players accountable? This is the same guy that let Andre Drummond chuck up threes every game.   I just don’t understand how people can see how awful the Pistons have been the last 8 years or so with 0 player development, see that SVG &amp; Drummond were the main reasons for that, and still think SVG is a good coach. His tactics are at least 10 years old, he gets no respect from his players, he cannot develop players for shit, and his systems are pathetic. I called his firing at the start of the season and I’m flabbergasted people *still* defend him. He’s a class A clown.   Also - Zion was great this season, but he could be better. He improved in his scoring but regressed in shooting and defence - He’s taken more threes at Duke than he has in his NBA career. He can, and will be, utilized better next season under a better coach (any coach in the league is better than Stan Van Dummy)"
To be fair Kevin Love was an all star like how Andre Drummond was an all star
"Giannis has acquired the Andre Drummond disease of being a big, yet trying to play like you're a guard and failing completely at it and not even playing the role you're supposed to play."
Andre Drummond.   All those rebounds made a lot of people think he was some should be all-star trapped on a shitty Pistons team.
Andre Drummond
"I mean, I'm intentionally exaggerating, but acquiring Andre Drummond is not getting shooters. More could have been done to make smarter moves imo."
"andre drummond, i think he is quite the exquisite player and can really help a team win  kek"
"I'd be careful trying to load up on shooters for an Olympics. The ball is different, the 3 pt line is a little different, shooters can be a bit ubreliable in international competition. Best way to dominate is to just have a tall beefy dude inside like Andre Drummond because most countries can't match up with the rebounding and inside presence he provides. Unlike the NBA, most international teams won't be able to run someone like him off the floor, all he'd have to do is be taller than everyone in the paint and rebound. We've seen guys like Deandre Jordan dominate in the Olympics in years past for this very reason"
Yet for 70% of games even someone like Andre Drummond or Deandre Jordan is more than enough to dominate inside
Looking like Andre Drummond out there
"They play stupid and are full of shrinking violets when it matters.  No ball movement on offense.  They should be slinging that ball side to side quickly, which will exploit the Nets defense.  Instead, Giannis gets the ball, backs up and makes a running start to the basket and puts up an awkward shot that is only marginally better than something Andre Drummond would do.  And other times guys like Jrue and Forbes get tight under the collar, or Middleton clanks one off the rim from 3, or Brooke Lopez gets sloppy.  This team needs some big changes, try to get Dame or something."
"Basing it purely off stats is extremely simplistic. Andre Drummond is the greatest player of this generation in that case! ""Wilt schooled him with worse team mates"" - Elgin Baylor and Jerry West are legends. Yet he only won 1 ring whilst Russell was in the league. Russell remains the GOAT defender, and the 60s Celtics revolutionised the way teams play offence with the fast break and outlet pass.  He probably wouldn't have 11 rings if there were more than 8 teams, but that just means that each team has considerably more talent.   Imagine the NBA today with 8 teams, how good the starting 5 and bench would be for each team. The 60s was stacked with HOF centers, so the argument that he played against weak teams simply isn't true."
"Made the Conf Finals vs the injured Pistons led by one legged Blake and Andre Drummond, and then the dysfunctional Celtics with Kyrie purposely sabotaging them. Then lost to the first contender he met. Choked a 2-0 lead  Last year beat the Magic down 6 of their best players, then lost to the Heat in the 2nd. Got stomped in every game.  AD lost to the Warriors."
Andre Drummond is up there
Maybe he meant Andre Drummond.
"empty stats is a real thing, which andre drummond kindly demonstrated for us this year. but there’s a difference between empty stats and juat being on a shit team."
Lookin like Andre Drummond
"He got 21 rebounds because the Hawks shot terribly all game and barely anyone tries for offensive rebounds anymore. He had some nice ones boxing out Capella, but it's not like he was Andre Drummond out there."
"Rudy ""Andre Drummond"" Gobert out there stacking 5 rebounds on 1 possession"
"I really hate it when people bring up some scrub big man right now and tell me he would be great in the 90s because he has some post moves. Like the 10 years where the majority of the best players were Cs or PFs? Who could play offense and defense? Andre Drummond wouldn't dominate, Jahlil Okafor would be absolute trash. I understand the game is really different but the truth is we just haven't had big man talent quite like Hakeen, Ewing, Robinson, Duncan, Shaq, Mourning, Malone, Webber, Barkley (if he counts as big) just to name a few off the top of my head. They could possibly be like Jerami Grant types where they score 20 and the team is absolute ass but other than that they wouldn't be good either. I'm glad Jokic, Embiid, and Gobert and making big men more relevant again. They all play differently too which is fun to watch and talk about"
Andre Drummond doesn't actually put up good stats. He's the least efficient interior player in the league and is incredibly turnover prone.
Andre Drummond and Hassan Whiteside beg to differ
Andre Drummond
Anywhere from Jahlil okafor to Andre Drummond

There was a season in Detroit where Reggie Jackson/Andre Drummond PnR’s were pretty lethal. I am being serious
Deandre Jordan and Andre Drummond making all-nba in 2016 just shows you the state of the center position at that time
Is Steph Curry a better shooter than Andre Drummond? Is SGA a better defender than Trae Young?
All credit goes to Andre Drummond
I thought Andre Drummond was going to be Shaq 2.0
👀 at Andre Drummond and Dennis Schroeder
You forgout about dre....Andre Drummond.
I mean he’s a Detroit fan and had to watch Andre Drummond. He knows what a center with bad hands is lmao
"I imitated you because you were trolling. I'll agree to stop imitating you if you agree to stop acting like a child by saying things like  \&gt; hurr durr  \&gt; butthurt  \&gt; Lol, you’ll cringe in a few years remembering this.  \&gt;When you refuse to acknowledge the truth of this you admit I have won.  How is Wilt and Russell a strawman? You're argument boils down to stats and accolades are undeniable. So, here's some stats.  Wilt averaged 50&gt;&gt;&gt;38  Russell won 11 titles &gt;&gt;&gt;6  Andre Drummond has one of the highest defensive rebound percentages of all time but he is objectively a bad defender because he doesnt have the right instincts to be in the right position. Stats dont tell the whole story. By your line of thinking, that's a strawman.  If you refuse to acknowledge that stats and accolades need context then you admit I have won"
I think there is a stigma against it. It’s crazy Andre Drummond shot sub 42% for his first 5 seasons and never gave it a shot. For years Rick Barry was trying to teach it to poor free throw shooters because he didn’t want to see it die.
Agreed. Andre Drummond at Center has been entertaining
Wtf. Did he just compare RUDY GOBERT (who is building a case to be one of the most impactful defenders OF ALL TIME) to Andre Drummond on stats alone (knowing that stats are inherently bad for recording actual defensive value)?
"First thing first, when you get past KD, Kyrie and Harden, you realize the Nets, OVERALL, are not a great team. I think I’ve watched all of their playoffs games except like one or two and I’m noticing a lot of holes in their game and I’m just like it’s the other team not seeing this???   Which leads me to my next point?? What the FUCK are the Bucks doing??? Bud is a fraud. Giannis is a fraud. I refuse to believe no one on that team isn’t thinking “they have no interior defense, let’s beat them in the paint”   Fucking Andre Drummond of all people looked like Wilt against the Nets.   This is infuriating to watch. It’s like the Bucks are playing scared. They’re playing like “omg it’s the KD, Kyrie and Harden Nets; we literally can’t beat them”   Hopefully the Sixers beat the Hawks because at least Embiid and Doc will be smart enough to exploit the Nets weaknesses."
"The fuck? Even by that Gobert is miles better than him for DPOY.  Andre Drummond is fucking terrible defensively, he makes every team worse when he’s on the floor"
Giannis is just a more athletic Andre Drummond. Both think theyre more skilled than they really are and play outside of their skill set
"Logan's All-NBA Second Team ballot from last year:  * Leonard, Kawhi  * Ingram, Brandon (only 2nd team vote) * Drummond, Andre  (only vote)  * Westbrook Russell (one of 9 2nd team votes) * Young, Trae (only second team vote)  He had Booker and Beal on his Third Team, leaving Lillard and CP3 entirely off his ballot. He also gave LaVine his only vote, leaving off Tatum and Butler."
"Andre Drummond exists, giving the definition of empty stats"
"Andre Drummond is a 2x all star, you wouldn't consider him an all star level player, would you? I don't base my ratings off of accolades without context"
"Andre Drummond and Jeff Teague have made all star games, I don't base a players worth on those accolades. Team success were a significant reason why he was ever selected for the All star/all nba teams (same with Trae Young this year)"
"I don't think Dame was an obvious pick at all at the time. I don't know who was watching Weber State games to have been really hype on him. Like, I remember him getting a bit of buzz, but this was a pretty weak draft class, and there were plenty of weak players picked ahead of him. AD was the clear #1, but then you have the next tier of Kidd-Gilchrist, Beal, Dion Waiters, and Thomas Robinson picked ahead of him. I remember being much more aware of Harrison Barnes, Andre Drummond, and Austin Rivers ahead of the draft. Those were the can't miss, 5 star high school players with the Hoops Mixtapes Youtube videos that me and my friends were passing around."
Kenneth Faried couldn't defend to save his life and he has the touch of Andre Drummond. The game left him behind.
"Andre Drummond, Boban, and any big man with a strong post up game but who can’t shoot or defend on the wing."
He was already dead before Andre Drummond was admittedly diminished?
Along with Andre Drummond

That’ll be Shanghai Sharks backup C Andre “I’ll leak your nudes too” Drummond
"He does deserve his fair share of the blame along with our atrocious shooting.  I think you identified the one useful way he can be employed if we keep him, which is to scoop up offensive rebounds/draw defenders in when Vogel moves to a shooter-focused lineup.  He's not going to settle for just that role though  I also disagree that he's quick for his size, he's often getting smoked, slow to react, doesn't rotate, and blows coverage losing his man.  So his one big asset is clogging the lane to force defenders into the paint, which most bigs can do so its hardly a reason to keep him. His rim protection is mediocre, and he was often getting out jumped for defensive rebounds by smaller offensive players.    His stats look good for rebounds because he gets a not small amount of his own rebounds since he has trouble finishing at the rim.  He's just slow all around (running, reacting, realizing the play), soft, has bad hands, often can't shoot or finish, blows coverage, gets lost in the pick n' roll, bodied by guys half his size, mediocre shot blocker, turns the ball over too much, poor passer with low basketball IQ  I watched every single Lakers game this year, and gave him the benefit of the doubt for many games initially defending him to others here saying give him a chance. There's a reason he saw no playtime whatsoever in Game 6.  Here's a write-up about him from 4 years ago, some of which he improved up on to his credit, but by and large you could just replace this with his Lakers clips and it would still be relevant  https://www.detroitbadboys.com/2017/7/19/15949492/detroit-pistons-andre-drummond-post-up-offense-burn-it-with-fire"
I'm referring to empty-calorie stats guys or players that were brainwashed into becoming franchise players when they had no business being that in the first place.  Like Andre Drummond on the Pistons.
"Gasol still had some juice in his game even if it was clear he was not very quick and struggled to defend certain players. You could somewhat understand him being benched. However, Trezz...... man did nothing wrong all season and was a very valuable player.  All of this drama for Andre Drummond who is one of the worst centers I have ever seen. And that's the big issue here. Robert Sacre had more coordination than him."
Andre Drummond
"this works in his post-prime but you don't win DPOY 3 times without a motor  Andre Drummond is a big one- he should be one of the best centers in the league today, but he very obviously is not one."
"Please stop saying Wilt was a great passer. He was maligned for being a poor passer and a black hole on offense. He got mad about that reputation so he took advantage of the fact that the ball was in his hands 90% of the time to lead the league in assists one time... with only 8.6... in a season where the pace was utter insanity. No direct pace statistics but compared to the fastest year for pace on record: 1967-68 saw 10 more FGA, 10 more FTA, 20 more rebounds, 1 more PF.... the number of possessions per game that year was likely on the range of 120-125.  And don't give me the ""behind the back"" stuff. A highlight does not a skill make. I've seen Andre Drummond dribble Chris Paul into the dirt, it doesn't make Andre Drummond a skilled ball handler or coordinated in any meaningful-in-the-NBA way."
Andre Drummond
"So showing up is all we expect of players now? We don't think players making $35+ million a year should play hard? It's depressing how many people in these comments think it's okay for players to do the bare minimum and don't think they should have to give their best. It's honestly weird because your same attitude doesn't seem to apply to other players who get called out all the time for being overpaid and/or not giving enough effort. Pistons fans always shit on Andre Drummond for not giving enough effort, but when Blake Griffin does it he's praised. In the real world you'd get fired for just showing up, sandbagging it, and giving the bare minimum effort, but I this sub apparently it brings you endless praise."
"Russell Westbrook deserves 3rd team all nba this year, Porzingis is a lot better than how he is treated in this sub, and Andre Drummond is a good center and the idea that he clogs the paint is vastly overstated. You do not need a floor spacing center either.  Edit: Also there is not a single person in this sub that is able to evaluate coaching effectively."
"Agree 100%. I think of Porzingis as kind of the same as Andre Drummond where his stat line is fine, but if you watch any game he’s in you can tell he’s a detriment. Prozingis and Wood’s statline are about the same(21 points, 2 ast, 9 rebs, 1 blk) and honestly I think you might be able to pull off that trade to a rebuilding team.  I think Wood would be a much better pair for Luka, he’d be better in the pick and roll, and I don’t think has the all star complex that Porzingis does."
Respect to him for being the number 1 pick but not trying to do more than he's capable of right now (he could've easily gone the andre drummond route) and getting really good at all the little things that the suns need and that lead to winning
Did we just forget how terrible he was against the Celtics lol  Even so he’s really one of the few ones to truly make an impact on this level. 99% of buyout players end up like Andre Drummond did
"Another pistons ran here to chime in that I, and I think most of us, have nothing but love for Blake.  He grinded and poured his heart out every time he stepped on the court for the better part of his stint here. His body really couldn’t keep up with the load of being a primary option on the team and with us being so bad, I don’t blame him if that passion and hustle waned during his last year. I’m happy he’s able to contribute on a great team, but it was for the best that he moved on. It’s all love to BG!  Andre Drummond on the other hand... lmao"
"Nah. Buyouts so rarely turn out well. Look at the most hyped buyout guy, Andre Drummond, who got a dnp for a short handed laker that desperately needed production from anyone not named lebron.   Blake is the exception."
"i remember thinking that we won the buyout market when we got Andre ""2020 rebound leader"" Drummond over washed Blake... i was wrong"
"I actually thought it would take some number of picks, I just didn’t really want to say how many or which rounds or years.  My gut tells me 2022 1st and 2024 pick swap is probably enough to get it done.  KP just played an abysmal series, but he isn’t Andre Drummond lmao.  He’s not someone you just shamelessly dump.  The guy still has plenty of value.  Plumlee for KP and a Pick would get vetoed by the league lmao.  KP is still probably the 30th best guy in the NBA.  He put up 33rd best PER and was top 15 in win shares.  Jerami Grant was 99th with no winshares.  Plumlee was top 50 PER and somehow 20th in win shares.  It’s a good trade and I’d do it if I were the GM of either team."
Andre Drummond?
"LeCCP is collectivizing the NBA under LA. When asked what would happen to Kyle Kuzma, Dennis Schroeder, and Andre Drummond, LeMao replied “Ever heard of Siberia?”"
Same reason we traded for Andre Drummond and were rumoured to want to resign him.
"Andre Drummond will be a perennial all star and Reggie Jackson will make multiple all star teams.  Dre’s ass and Reggie proceeded to get injured each season after his first (very good) full season as a piston.  The Dre one really hurts cause I talked this man up like crazy. Said he’d be better than all your favorite centers. He’s cheeks y’all.  The Reggie one hurts cause from when he got traded here to his first full season the guy was putting up really good numbers and was like top 3 clutch players or something like that along with being the only PG in the East top 5 in every category. Then boom he got injured, came back too early and wasn’t that previous Reggie ever again."
"This happens even with players that put up good stats in one category but are awful in a team offense since they struggle to contribute without the ball in their hands. See Buddy Hield or Andre Drummond, two offensively limited and defensively terrible players that got overpaid by bad franchises."
"Imagine if KP spent a summer working out with a guy like Andre Drummond or Dwight Howard. Nothing but rebounding and shoulder presses. Dude could come out the other end being a double-double machine, cleaning the glass better than windex on both sides of the floor."
&gt;      Andre Drummond      Montrezl Harrell      Kyle Kuzma      Julius Randle      Mitchell Robinson      Duncan Robinson  We got a fucking squad now boys
"I can't agree with this more.   I'll use Detroit as an example since that's one of the two teams I follow closest.   Between 2008 and 2015, we literally had seven different coaches.   That's an average of one per year.  That was the end of the 'contending' phase and the first five year of the rebuild.  Since the rebuild began, we had a lot of solid young talent come in and brought in some free agents. We had Chris Middleton, and Greg Monroe, and Andre Drummond and Josh Smith. Brandon Jennings. Tobias Harris. Morris. Caldwell-Pope. Reggie Jackson. Kennard.  Ilyasova.    I'm certainly not making a case that any combination of those guys was going to be winning a championship.  But when young guys like Middleton, Harris, Drummond, and Monroe come in, and show some real potential, but then they get jerked around form one coach to another. One coach has Monroe run plays (effectively) out of the post, the next give Jennings the ball without (big mistake), it just established this turnstile of losing.  Young guys just trying to get there to get a pay day. No cohesion.   That's why I appreciate that teams like the Sixers, even though they got rid of Brett Brown, took the time to bring a player development guy in and just gave him 5 or 6 years without question."
Laughs in Andre Drummond
"This sounds like too much but blow up the whole roster except a few players, like absolutely flip it because we seen what happened with LeBron in cleveland, they cant do slow moves with players that score less points than Air Bud cough\* KP cough\*   1. I think Lonzo actually would be a good fit here  2. trade KP  3. Derrick Rose would be a great 6th man and mentor to Luka 4. Andre Drummond if he leaves the Lakers and get him cheap, otherwise he is not worth it 5. Any center, please."
if andre drummond can improve his free throw shooting anyone can....seriously it's a freaking free throw. theres no excuse to be as bad as ben is at them.
Andre Drummond too
If ur talking about Randle he isn't an empty stats player lol he just had a bad series after shooting 40% from 3 in the regular season it happens  A true empty stats player is Andre Drummond
"Andre Drummond will get 41 rebounds in game 7 vs the suns, whenever that is"
"That's not how rotations work, when superstar minutes get freed up it's not just guys at the same position that get those minutes  And sure but the Lakers are starting Wesley Matthews and Andre Drummond"
they already had andre drummond
"It's really a great take on Moses, you're just a homer and you took Andre Drummond comparison out of context."
"I’m a lifelong NBA fan at 34 years old. The lack of intensity and reps during meaningful minutes is whats behind a lot of this. Guys not wanting to play under than normal minutes and instead sitting **is ridiculous**  Just an example, but Andre Drummond sat out for an entire month of regular season basketball just so he could end up on the Lakers bench."
"Ryan Saunders or Jim Boylen, I can’t remember too much about some of the others on this thread but Jim Boylen for combining atrocious coaching with the worst team culture I remember and Saunders for the most tragic and sad losses I ever remember . Check the loss to Orlando when cole Anthony hit the game winner for example. Or there was a Detroit comeback last season where Andre Drummond hit a goal ahead fadeaway turnaround 3 to win the game. Dude just attracted sadness on the court like a magnet"
Andre Drummond posts up like he's Embiid.      [He's Andre Drummond.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zNSr0O6Tpk&amp;ab_channel=Umut)
Andre Drummond. Dude lasted like 3 more games than I thought he would
Andre Drummond
"I think he's more than a min player on the right team. The dreaded ""empty stats"" thing at least partially applies to him, but not to the extent of Andre Drummond who is an actual negative on the court a lot of the time.   Whiteside should be a 10-15 min guy like Dwight was for Philly and LA the last two seasons rather than being forced into bigger roles. I would not mind him as a backup here, considering we just sat through Bismack Biyombo starting for a chunk of the season. If good Whiteside shows up then he's an asset and you can give him 20 minutes, if bad Whiteside shows up, you bench him after 2 minutes, play small with PJ at the 5 and maybe try him again for a few min in the 2nd half."
Lol you’re crazy. Dennis played well and actually helped carry the team at certain times. Andre Drummond is just terrible.
I. Andre Drummond 2. Kyle Kuzma 3. Ben simmons
"The fact that KD is such a good dribbler and shooter is especially impressive given his size.  I'm not sure where your cognitive dissodance is. There are certain things that different body types are better suited for.  It definitely sounds like you're a big hater given you said ""Giannis isn't unskilled""  Getting to the basket and succeeding down low is a skill. Being big and athletic doesn't inherently  make you good at the rim, just ask Andre Drummond.   So saying smaller guys are more skilled then their bigger counterparts, solely under the basis that they're small or that they dribble well ignores the reality of the game.  You can either get buckets, or you can't."
You seem like someone who was hype to get Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond
The Kings and Andre Drummond.
"Well yeah I mean the team was pretty bad and was trotting Andre Drummond out there.  That will change this season with actual young talent on the roster and adding Cade, our ticket sales have already seen a surge and will continue to see that. We sold out the palace like 5 years in a row, in Auburn Hills, when the Goin to Work Pistons were balling. Attendance will not be a problem when the team is exciting like this."
Andre Drummond incoming
"In addition to making the playoffs and 50+ wins out West, Dirk made ASGs int he West going up against a ton of great bigs/forwards. Competition was so good that Dirk missed All Star Games while averaging: 22/9/2 ('01), 17/7/3 ('13), 18/7/2 ('16)  Aside from the first season, none of those seasons pop out as all time great seasons, but they were still solid numbers, in the West he didn't come close to the ASG, but in the East I'm sure he makes the ASG 2 or maybe even all 3 times with those numbers. Dirk was making all star games and all NBA teams while going up against prime Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett.   For reference the years he missed the ASG while putting up those numbers, Eastern conference bigs who got in were averaging:   * 2001: Dirk averaged 22/9/2    * Anthony Mason averaged 16/10/3    * Glenn Robinson averaged 22/7/3    * Lattrell Sprewell averaged 18/5/4    * Allan Houston averaged 19/4/2    * Antonio Davis averaged 14/10/1 * 2013: Dirk averaged 17/7/3    * Luol Deng averaged 17/6/3    * Brook Lopez averaged 19/7/2    * Kevin Garnett averaged 15/8/2    * Chris Bosh averaged 17/7/2 * 2016: Dirk averaged 18/7/2    * Paul Millsap averaged 17/9/3    * Al Horford averaged 15/7/3    * Pau Gasol averaged 17/11/4    * Andre Drummond averaged 15/14/1"
Kevin Love doesn't even run up the floor on defense.  He just kind of strolls up and arrives in the middle of the play.  You don't even notice you're playing 5-on-4 though because he's a turnstile when he does get there.  Sometimes he doesn't even bother walking up the floor at all.  I've seen plenty of plays where Love just stands on the other side of the court and waits for the ball to move back.  You don't notice it because the camera shifts away.  The Cavs were having a really nice season early in the year -- we were 10-11 after 21 games including the two wins over the Nets -- but the poor behavior from our max players sapped our momentum.  First it was our having to bench Andre Drummond because he just refused to play real basketball.  And then Kevin Love came back and stunk up the court.
Jrue “Andre Drummond” Holiday at it again with these layups
"Laker fans overhype everyone lol , they act like  other teams should give them all nba talent for kuzma, they were so hyped for Andre Drummond and look how that worked out  Lol…"
Andre Drummond: “I’m in danger”.
Andre Fucking Drummond
"Eric Bledsoe, CJ McCollum, Aaron Gordon, Marvin Bagley, Andre Drummond"
"To me, empty stats is shit like Andre Drummond's rebound numbers being so high because he is so bad at scoring he keeps getting his own misses. Another example would be some player that gets like 20ppg avg but 10 of that is in garbage time when his team has already lost. I wouldn't call Sexton or MPJ that just yet. But Hassan Whiteside and Andre Drummond definitely do a lot of that."
"That heartbreak is draining year after year but trust me, after having to watch Charlie Villanueva, Rodney Stuckey, Andre Drummond, Kyle Singler, etc. over the years, I’d much rather be in the heartbreak position hahah."
Pg John wall or Kemba ( they just at that point in their career) So Cj or buddy hield or joe Harris  Sf jerami grant or Otto porter jr ( young) Pf aaron Gordon or Julius randle  C andre Drummond or Kantwr super obvious
Russ-Easily the best player on this list but his efficiency and IQ really get exposed in the playoffs  Sexton-Closer to Lou Williams than a true star worth a max  Sabonis-By the advanced metrics one of the most horrific defenders in the NBA. People try and tell me that the Pacers should trade Turner and start Sabonis at center like it’s that easy  And ofc the goats of empty stats Andre Drummond and Hassan Whiteside  Replace Drummond with Kanter for your challenge
"Seriously. The “killer mentality” is the most overrated aspect of NBA stars.  Just because Jordan has a psychopath “I’ll burn down your house to win this game” kind of attitude, doesn’t mean you need to be an egomaniac to be the best.   You know who else has that attitude? Andre Drummond, lmao. And it definitely makes him worse."
"The Cavs are schizophrenic on their big men, they want Mobley but traded for Jarrett Allen, and this season had Kevin Love, Jarrett Allen and Andre Drummond on the team. Team's big positions are volatile."
"Yep, I have lived through a bought-in Andre Drummond and he was a fucking monster whose game translates very well to international play.  Could Pop get him to buy-in?  I have no idea."
"Andre Drummond slander is unwarranted, man was all-nba third team and led the league in defensive win shares two years in a row."
Andre Drummond and Kyle Kuzma coming in hot. Plus they don't need a return ticket
Robin Lopez  Edit: Andre Drummond and Montrezl Harrell
"That’s a stupid idea, would u like a free throw contest between Andre Drummond and Ben Simmons?"
"All-hated team should also have: Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, Rudy Gobert, Grayson Allen, Ben Simmons, Andre Drummond, Jae Crowder, Kyle Kuzma  All-loved team should have: Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Derrick Rose, Alex Caruso, Jarrett Allen, Boban Marjanovic"
"I'm fine with Allen, too, honestly. My original comment was just pointing out that I think a more traditional C is more needed on this team than another G. My mind went to Brook, but Allen would be a good pick, too.  And I don't know if he's *good*, per se. I mean, even when you account for the fact that he's boxing out his man and likes to tip to other guys, he's still not Andre Drummond or anything like that. Just pointing out that I think he's better than ""5 rebounds/game"" would indicate. But he's serviceable to good at so many different things that I think he'd be valuable to this team."
Andre Drummond might be a good FIBA guy tbh. Pop just has to limit the high post ups to 0 lmao
"I've been saying this. Andre Drummond would actually feast, especially since he can goal tend"
Andre Drummond 15$ million should be a sign you need to change your formula. No team is paying him more than 5$ million.
"Hollinger uses a stat called BOND$ to predict the value of a player in the upcoming season, based on a range of factors.      1. Kawhi Leonard (PO): $51,792,994      2.

Andre Drummond sucks. Just a fact.
"I actually think Andre Drummond was lucky to have landed in this era, at least for the bulk of his career to this point.   The paint may be emptier than it's ever been and lots of teams are going relatively small, clearing the way for a large man rooted to the basket to clean up the glass as he pleases (thus swelling rebounding statistics).  Moreover, the prevalence of an open paint combined with the emergence of the Tyson Chandler-esque pick &amp; roll rim runner have allowed Drummond to average over 17 points per game at his best, despite having little to no offensive scoring skill and ability.   Drummond was a two-time all-star in the current era; I think becoming Benoit Benjamin would be a decided downgrade."
Wtf has happened to Jrue holidays layup package? I don’t remember this man every being Andre Drummond around the rim
Andre Drummond has the lowest BBIQ on the court no matter what era he plays
Andre Drummond definitely has the tiniest kitten nustle gently upon his shoulder hair
All Oblivious Team   Pat Bev SG Kelly Oubre PF Andre Drummond  6th man-Dennis Schroeder?   Help me fill out the roster lol
Andre Drummond?
"Cj McCollum was an all star, Andre Drummond was an all star"
Kevin Love looks like Andre Drummond with good credit
They need a center that can just pack the paint and defend and catch oops when the time comes. As weird as it sounds I think a guy like Andre Drummond would be good here. Or even lesser known guys like Daniel Gafford and Stewart from the pistons would be helpful if they can just pack the paint for 40 mins and just use their length to turn away shots
I think Javale McGee or Andre Drummond would probably be more valuable than Love
They needed to build a better roster.   Get the best complimentary players (eg Robert Covington comes to mind) vs all stars to impersonate those guys. And definitely bring in size like a Brook Lopez and Andre Drummond to play big. Having Bam and KD as your biggest on the roster won’t work well.  Any thoughts on better roster construction?
"Kyle Kuzma,Eric Bledsoe,CJ Elleby,Keljin Blevins,Jahlil Okafor,Mason Plumlee,Austin Rivers,Marvin Bagley,Jeff Green,Udonis Haslem,Kevin Love,Andre Drummond,Lebron James,Joe Harris and Deandre Jordan."
"The only people i've ever seen him ""piss off"" was Andre Drummond (who isn't on the team anymore) and Kevin Love (who hopefully won't be on the team anymore soon).  You've been slandering Sexton across this thread and it's all bullshit reasons. If the cavs draft/trade around team fit, they'll be failures forever."
"That's usually what our biggest advantage is. Lot of teams have talented guards or wings but we just have more big athletic bodies that can grab rebounds, easy putbacks. Shooting doesn't always translate to intl ball but size translates anywhere.   I know it sounds crazy but I really think Andre Drummond would have been great for this style of play."
"Dennis Schroeder + the rights to his ""That's tuff 🔥💯"", Andre Drummond, Montrezl Harrell, Kyle Kuzma and a 2063 second round pick"
"Love brings Olympic experience.   Harrison Barnes, Draymond Green, Andre Drummond, Mason Plumlee, etc...  That’s the quality you would get in Kevin Loves spot. Draymond is the only player better than Love on that list currently, but even in 2016, Love was a better player than Draymond."
"I like Bagley. He needs to stop trying to be a Andre Drummond and focus on making the small plays. Ayton is about to get a max extension for averaging 14/10 along with 1 block a game. But it’s his other impact and potential that makes it worth it and no one will complain about it.  If Bagley realizes there is more to basketball than putting the ball in the rim, he can be a solid player. Also he gotta stay healthy."
I feel like a lot of NBA players have that same mindset.  Andre Drummond seems to have that same mind set. Jabari Parker too. Even better players don't think they need to improve like Ben Simmons and Andrew Wiggins.
Fraud/fake AD= Andre Drummond
So a shorter Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond
"&gt;How else could Andre Drummond ever get a DPOY vote?   A guy who thinks defensive rebounding is not only a vital component of defense, but the *only* component of defense."
How else could Andre Drummond ever get a DPOY vote? Unless maybe the guy thought he was voting for Drummond Green.
"Naw man, this has actually basketball analysis rather than trying to shill his Drummond coins or Andre tokens."
"It's because he's not a team player and often brings up people's embarrassing moments.  A pretty toxic combination for a Detroit team trying to build culture post-Andre ""don't touch my rebounds"" Drummond."
"Was. Andre Drummond, I believe, would be the body-hair of the league."
Andre Drummond taking enough shots to score 15 points hurts the offence way more than it helps it
Andre Drummond says tell yo coach
"Recent History shows the 9th pick as a real mixed bag, for what's its worth, all these players are still playing today (Vonleh might not last past this season). Only 3 of them were basically back ups from the start.  2010: Gordon Hayward (Utah, signed an extension) 15.6/4.5/3.5, made an all star game; 685 games played  2011: Kemba Walker (Charlotte, signed an extension) 19.9/3.8/5.4, multiple all star games, an all nba team; 704 games played  2012: Andre Drummond (Pistons, signed an extension) 14.5/13.7/1.4, all star, all nba, rebounding leader; 645 games played  2013: Trey Burke - starter, then quickly role player  2014: Noah Vonleh - role player, now third stringer  2015: Frank Kaminsky - role player  2016: Jakob Poetl - role player, current starter (usually)  2017: Dennis Smith Jr - starter, now role player  2018: Kevin Knox - role player  2019: Rui Hachimura - starter  2020: Deni Advija - role player"
Draymond green looks like andre drummond compared to the rest of the players
Shout out to that one beat writer for the Nets who voted Andre Drummond for DPOY last year because he had 4 blocks against them.
"If somebody wants to buy an Andre Drummond NFT that’s on them lol, I don’t hate Andre for it."
yo was shocked to hear this so i looked it up but he was with jennette mccurdy (sam from icarly)  https://jocksandstilettojill.com/professional-athletes/actress-jennette-mccurdy-admits-she-was-never-interested-in-pistons-andre-drummond/
Andre Drummond is empty stats poster boy. His stats are at the expense of the rest of the team.
"People called me crazy when I invested all of my retirement savings in Drummond tokens, but this alone is going to push their return through the roof. Andre to the moon 🚀🚀🚀"
I wonder what the conversion rate is from Andre coins to Drummond tokens.
Yes they are  Andre Drummond and Hassan Whiteside  Jeremi Grant isn’t empty stats tho
"Yeah... but he stated he is trolling people to back his Andre coin which has a market cap of 0.15 Lebronto coins, but is the standard currency when dealing with Drummond back non tangible assets."
that's 4x rebounding leader andre drummond you're talking about
"I think he wants to *spur* drama to promote his Andre coins, which can be used to purchase Drummond tokens, which in turn can be used as collateral in Drummond back non-tangible assets on the Andre backed market."
Andre Drummond.
Remember when Andre Drummond and Greg Monroe were the future of the Detroit Pistons?
"Haha true, it was more in reference to Andre Drummond being called “Big penguin” earlier this season which would definitely make CP the little penguin"
Idk when star talent was down and rn is the most star power of all time but the centers were really lacking from like 2012-2016 like guys like deandre jordan were making all nba 1st team and andre drummond was undoubtedly a top 5 center
Looks at Andre Drummond   We don't need guys that don't fit
"Giannis ""Andre Drummond"" Antetokounmpo"
He's been playing with Tristan Thompson and Andre Drummond who were basically only good for getting boards. Kevin Love didn't need to get rebounds with them in
"Topshot will be awesome in 20-30 years.  But even then, nobody will ever want to have an Andre Drummond moment."
You’d understand if Andre fucking Drummond was the face of your franchise for 7 years and proceeds to give less effort than my girlfriend does during sex
I mean nobody can say Andre Drummond didnt get enough playing time with the Lakers with a straight face
Fuck Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond is The Goat
"He got it because prior to the organization self-sabotaging when they elected to sit Andre Drummond, they were competitive.  Well, competitive for the Cavs.  They were 10-18 when they sat Drummond.  They finished 22-50, or 12-32 once he stopped playing.  They were a .500 team after the first month before they started tanking by losing 10 in a row (which they started sitting Drummond halfway through.  Bickerstaff is a competent coach who doesn't cause drama, and with Dan Gilbert's future as the owner uncertain in the aftermath of a pretty severe stroke, the team was probably looking to build some long-term continuity."
"Kuzma finds a role hustling on the boards and contesting at the rim, gets double doubles, we win. Then Lakers bring up Andre Drummond and his whole rebounding shtick just goes away"
"Kuzma's hustle is nice but not after he negates all his hard work with bone headed plays.  Kuzma is a sieve on defense makes Andre Drummond look like a future DPOY candidate.  Kuzma is not just on defensive assignments he is thoroughly embarrassed. MPJ cooked him multiple possessions in a row in the year of the title run.  Plus dont get it twisted, Drummond is out for his next big deal and will be putting effort.  I just dont see who the Lakers can sign besides Drummond to back up AD.   Here are the Lakers most realistic options for free agents. Gasol/Trez was a terrible replacement for Dwight/McGee. They need a quality back up C to eat up minutes for AD.  Here are the top free agents for the Lakers: Nerlens Noel, Cody Zeller, Kanter, Whiteside  **Zeller** - 27 years old - 9 pts /7 rebounds/ 2 assists on the Hornets in 20 minutes  **Noel** - 27 years old - 5 pts/6 rebounds/2 blocks on the Knicks in 25 minutes   **Whiteside** - 32 years old - 8 pts/6 rebounds/1 block on the Kings in 15 minutes  **Drummond** - 27 years old - 12 pts/7 rebounds/ 1 block on the Lakers in 25 minutes  Besides Noel (and maybe Whiteside although he only was asked to play 15 minutes a game on the Kings) who else can the Lakers go after?  Only way the Lakers arent bringing Drummond back is if he asks for some ungodly amount of money."
"He sacrificed his game and his numbers for the better of the team even when he didn't do anything wrong. Leading our team in scoring and winning us games his rookie year as the first option because of BI and Zo's lack of agreesion.    Next year we get LeBron, he's then reverted to 3rd in the food chain, but LeBron goes down and Kuzma steps up until BI takes over late in the season.   His third year we traded all other young guys and were thrusted into championship contention. He changed his role again to become a complimentary pics to two super stars. He developed some good defensive tendencies and learned how to impact the game in other ways than scoring.   This past year he was more of the energy guy than anything. He was buried deep in the offensive rotation, but was exceding in his energy role. He had a few games with 3 blocks and a stretch of double doubles. All that seemed to go away when the Lakers picked up Andre Drummond.   The Lakers expected him to jump back into that scoring role as LeBron and AD went down, but like he said ""it's hard to be consistent in an inconsistent role"". He's good for a few big games a year, but to have him comeback and be the top scorer on the team when he doesn't even get plays ran for him is tough."
"I'll admit I forgot about Gasol, although teams are fine with him shooting 3s as he's very reluctant to shoot them. That was the case with Rondo, but he hit a bunch of timely ones in the bubble last year. Caruso though, nobody respects him, he might be at a good % this year, but volume is actually more important than your %. Somebody like Jae Crowder is more respected than a lot of shooters that are better than percentage wise than he is, simply because he always takes them. In that respect, I'll give Kuz some props for upping his volume and 3P% this year.   &gt; There’s really no justification dude. We know the Lakers were a good offensive team in the regular season before AD got injured, we know they were doing well offensively in the playoffs before AD went out, they were, by the stats you pointed to yourself, similarly talented offensively as last year’s team, which was a good offensive team even in non-bubble conditions.  I never said they weren't *good* offensively, I said they weren't good enough to win a title and I stand by that. Just because it happened once, doesn't mean it'll happen again, the Lakers were one of the worst 3-point shooting teams in a long time to win the title.    That's not to say that the Lakers can't win a title again, they absolutely can, but they need more offensive firepower, even more than 3-point shooting, they need another creator, somebody who can run offense while LeBron sits. The big reason the Lakers won the title last year is they won the non-LeBron minutes because their offense managed to survive in large part due to Rondo. AD is a really good offensive player when he gets to play with a point guard, and a pretty mediocre one when he doesn't.   Do you really think if they run back this current team, they'd win the championship? Because I don't. I was much more afraid of the Lakers in 2020 than this year. I know you don't think there's much of a difference between the 2 teams, but there is. For one thing, the 2020 iteration had proven playoff vets like Rondo and Danny Green and to a lesser extent Dwight Howard, who for all his warts, knows how to play defense, even if he can be a clown. This 2021 team had Dennis Schroder, who is on his way into becoming the next Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell, the definition of an 82 game player as opposed to a 16 game player, always gets benched in the playoffs due to bad PnR defense, and Andre Drummond, who thinks he's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar reincarnated apparently."
Lmao no he’s not  What is with the Andre Drummond delusion? I heard someone the other day call him one the best rebounders of all time like half of them aren’t just collecting his own bricked layups
"He has literally spent his career on bad teams and for them he has merely been an Andre Drummond.  The ""on a good team"" numbers Shannon cited are just Drummond's real stats while playing for bad teams... Yet he's trying to favorably compare him to the MVP and runner-up."
You literally brought up 3s when talking about Andre Drummond. You can’t sit at this table
"“Andre Drummond is overrated”  “No, he’s a multiple time all star”  Not the argument you think it is lol. You have fans of 3 separate teams that employed him telling everyone he sucks ass. We’ve known this much for years, but some people just refuse to listen.  He’s god damn terrible. He’s made all-star teams because people (like you) are box score watchers who lose their shit at the thought of a double double."
Happens way too often. Had someone once say Andre Drummond was an elite finisher which he has never been at any point  in his career.
So... Andre Drummond average game?
“Andre Drummond is one of the worst players in the league”   “I’m not sure you understand what ignorant means”  This has to be parody
"Lmao I’m not sure you understand what the word ignorant means  Obviously compared to average people Andre Drummond is the goat but I’m not comparing him to average people. I’m comparing him to other players in the league, and he’s arguably one of the worst players in the league.  If that’s ignorant then okay, I guess we’re all ignorant then cause I’m pretty sure you can agree Caruso isn’t the best player in the league. Is he? If you don’t believe so then you’re ignorant  See how stupid that sounds"
James Johnson over Andre Drummond. Then the 'cocked that joint back and banged on him' quote
"Gobert is still protecting the rim, what? Ingles/Bogdanovic should rotate off of their man to closeout the open corner, while Clarkson recovers and Gobert is still under the basket.   &gt;Clippers shoot 80% at the rim and probably get FT's too  I mean, Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann went straight at Gobert at still bitched on him.   &gt;Clarkson should learn to stay in front of Reggie fucking Jackson  You're acting like Reggie Jackson wasn't one of the hottest players in the playoffs this season. Gobert isn't at fault, but if he's not versatile enough to closeout and recover on his own, he's not the best defensive player in the NBA. And he can't even punish the Clippers 5 out rotation on offense unless he's being spoon fed easy lobs that Andre Drummond could catch lol"
Andre Drummond cause he has shoulder hair
"Even the most biased eyes are better than metrics that consider Hassan Whiteside, Andre Drummond and Russell Westbrook to be elite defenders"
Marc Gasol and Andre Drummond for completely different reasons.
"Andre Drummond is a no go when Steve Kerr comes to the Bay cause instead of passing it back out to Steph, Drummond will just miss the putback 5 times"
Andre Drummond.
I seen Andre Drummond knock down 10 in a row nothing they just really good at basketball
Basically Andre Drummond as long as no one beats him to his rebound.
andre drummond could beat that if he kept missing a putback for 10 minutes straight
If Andre “5 rebounds in 4 seconds” Drummond couldn’t do it no one can.
boggles my fucking mind. how are you trying to 'save money' on an equipment manager who has been there for decades ... are they going to switch to unpaid interns?  meanwhile you're paying Andre Drummond (I know he's on a min but still) ... just awful
To be fair anyone tht watched the Pistons and Cavs Andre Drummond would tell you he had a stupid high usage rate
"Andre Drummond is efficient.  There, if anybody needs to point to a moron and say somebody's said it, I am now your moron."
U consider Andre Drummond ball dominant?
aka kind of like seeing the stat sheets for Andre Drummond and thinking he's really good but when you actually watch him play....
"Good for him!  I honestly didn't get to watch him this season, but I saw him show up in the box scores, and her per36 stats and percentage is impressive.   I'm guess that most of his shots are within a meter of the basket, but even so, it looks like he's the kind of guy who knows his role.   And he averaged more offensive boards than he does missed field goals, so that means he's essentially scoring on more than 100% of the shot opportunities he's given (which is to say that his offensive boards wipe away all of his missed FGs and then some).   But he better be careful, because in three or four years, he could be getting the Andre Drummond treatment from this sub. ;-)"
I hate this union didn't work out. Marc is every bit as gracious as his brother is. How we disposed of him in favor of Andre Drummond because Pelinka was frightened of Drummond signing for the Nets backfired. Marc gave his all for the team and that's all you can ask for. I wish him the best.
I think the conversation was more “are we the only people seeing how bad Andre Drummond is playing? Their must be a reason he is starting because it is not his skill.
Ed Davis is basically if Andre Drummond came off the bench most his career and was about 50 lbs lighter.
Counter point: Andre drummond
"Exactly. We didn't even get to play Isaiah Joe last season and he could use the minutes, there's no playing time to be had outside injuries. Don't even get me started on how Paul Reed has to sit to watch andre Drummond"
How do you play make if you have Andre Drummond as a teammates
"Patrick McCaw, Matt Thomas, Kostas Antetokounmpo, Alen Smailagić, and Andre Drummond"
"I went ahead and highlighted all of the fouls for you so there's no trying to delude yourself out of this just being ""physical play."" By all means if the NBA wants to change the way that games are normally called to make something like this legal then go for it, I think that would be great if the game were made more physical. But that's not how it was being called that game and it isn't how the game is called in general.   This extends far beyond LeBron and Jokic so you can miss me with trying to pin this on ""you just don't like LeBron."" This play was a full course meal of fouls, there isn't any denying it. This is just one play in the context of a greater issue that is referees being wildly inconsistent with how they call games, whether it's game to game, or quarter to quarter, or player to player, or it's just some random offshoot play that they go to sleep on.  This game in particular was being called pretty tight the whole night. Less physical plays than this were being called fouls all night, and this was the one play out of the entire game besides a couple weird ass TT/Plumlee rebounding scraps in the first half, to have the whistle that far back from the play. That's the issue.   If the refs in private said, ""This was a really young player who was moving his way to an all-NBA level player for the first time up against the best player in the league, we wanted to be hands off with that and just enjoy that basketball moment and let them have that physicality in that play"", then by all means I am fine with that. I really am. But we don't know if that was the process behind that moment, and for anyone to come out and say that Jokic wasn't fouled all over this play is just dishonest and disingenuous, and for what?  It doesn't matter if this was Andre Drummond and Kevon Looney, the issue remains the same."
"Ish Smith, Jimmer Fredette, Lance Stephenson, Mo Bamba, Aron Baynes.  The perfect storm of Lance going off for 25 in a half, Jimmer making every open 3 and having a somewhat favorable matchup on defense, Baynes and Bamba catching every lob and getting every put back and Ish getting you 12-16 could beat a team that overlooks them but should lose every other game they're in by quite a margin.  Bench could feature: IT, Brandon Jennings, Andre Drummond, Jeremy Lamb, Bismack Biyombo."
Trying to put non-summer league level players here:  Eric Bledsoe  Cole Anthony  Kevin Knox  Ben Simmons  Marvin Bagley  Andre Drummond  They might accidentally win more than one game. Mostly guys who are good players but really do not mind losing as long as they get theirs. They'll probably beat a really good team like the Bucks for that one win. LOL
Can he redeem them for that Andre Drummond NFT?
"you’re taking 45 games in a bubble year  plus Murray is 2 years older. he was at 18.6 on 45/34/88 at Sexton’s age when he was being set-up by the best passer in the NBA    and 3ppg is a big difference. like i said, Brandon Ingram didn’t do that. Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, and Khris Middleton didn’t do that    Murray had a true outlier year in terms of shooting last year. 45 games of shooting hot is not enough to refute 4 years of league average shooting. last year was the first time Sexton was below league average   and he should have more assists than Sexton😂 he’s passing to Jeremy Grant, Michael Porter Jr, and the MVP  Sexton is passing to Andre Drummond, Jarrett Allen, Darius Garland, and Larry Nance.   and you’re talking about peak, but Murray is 2 years older. watch that Nets game from this year for players at their peak. Sexton’s entire career is coming up big in big time moments"
"Just get a team with five centers/big guys that can't dribble or pass and you complete this challenge. Udonis Haslem, Cristiano Felicio, DeAndre Jordan, DJ Wilson and my guy Andre Drummond can definitely go 1-81."
PG: Marcelo Huertas SG: Andre Robertson SF: Kyle Kuzma  PF: Boogie  C: Drummond
"i’ll take the huge sample size. or i can watch the Nets game where YB took over. or when he went 3 on 5 in college    look: Murray plays with the best passing big man to ever live. his team is arguably the deepest in the league.   Sexton plays with JR Smith, Jordan Clarkson, and Andre Drummond and he still makes more shots than Murray on more attempts.    he’s one of the 5 fastest players in the league and he just upped his free throws to 6 a game at 22 years old.   Murray isn’t even close to that level of consistency.   especially on a team with no other all-stars, a guy like Sexton would be a better fit than Murray. although I would put Morant over both personally"
"Andre Drummond(C), Kevin Love(PF), Ben Simmons(SF), Rajon Rondo(PG), Austin Rivers(SG)  This actually looks like a good team on paper."
ben has more win shares that jason tatum.  he is not some crazy bum or an empty state andre drummond type guy.  he just completely wilted when the lights were the brightest.
"Andre Drummond, Marc Gasol, Ivica Zubac, Isiah Thomas, Udonis Haslem"
C: Andre Drummond  F: Okafor  F: MKG  G: ntlikina   G: Dennis Smith  No shooting. No shot creation. Defense will be bad
Yeah and Andre Drummond is also an All-NBA player
"Your lineup made me think of something:  Andre Miller, Andre Roberson, Andre Iguodala, [Andre Brown](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/brownan01.html), Andre Drummond.  All current day. Feel like there's a chance to get it."
And then another glue guy that plays incredibly hard but doesnt even want to score... a guy like Andre Drummond comes to mind
"Jeremy Lin, JR Smith, Nick Young, Jeff Green, Andre Drummond and a bench of whoever I can find  It will be called the team of heat checks surely we will get one game where all those guys turn into prime Michael Jordan and we win in a 200 point blowout.   If we get another blazing hot game just feed tge ball to Drummond in the post and led him take care of it"
* ben simmons * seth curry * tobias harris * danny green * andre drummond  They would beat the Sacramento Kings when they'd play them in Philly.
"Lebron, current tony Allen, andre Roberson, Andre Drummond, prime Kendrick perkins"
"Charlie Villanueva, Ben Gordon, Rodney Stuckey, Andre Drummond = Pistons hurrah what a decade"
Andre Drummond
You can't win with logic here. You're the bad man for coming at a franchise for pacifying their weak azz stars. (Yeah KAT is as good as Andre Drummond fluff stats on poor teams). I would've traded Kat to the Knicks for both of the firsts this year and they keep Jonathan Kuminga (hope I spell it right) plus them picks u got a deep young team. But now they got two former all stars mentoring Anthony Edwards on how to fall off.
The author thinks the raptors should have signed Andre Drummond.   Yeah no
"Don't worry they have Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunnn, the Andre Drummond of gaurds!"
I feel like the Lakers/Nets matchup is slightly overhyped.   Fucking ANDRE DRUMMOND of all people looked like Wilt Chamberlain against the Nets. And that was without AD and LeBron.   And the Nets don’t seem too interested to improve their interior defense.
Is it required to be an asshole when you become a 76'ers fan? Jesus christ. You're acting like dumping Horford is was rocket science when in reality teams dump bad contracts all the time. And again you got Curry because the Mavs FO is dumb not because Morey is a genius.   If Andre Drummond is going to start for 20 games a season be prepared to have a hole at the 5 on offense and defense. All he does is rebound and most of those are off his own misses.   Why offer Danny double of what he would've made on another team? Doesn't seem to smart to me. Korkmaz shoots 37% from 3 and literally doesn't do anything else.
"Rebounding wasn't the problem  In Charlotte he was bad at everything else. He tried to be a post up big and massively failed at it. Didn't put in effort in defense, didn't screen shooters, traveled at least once per game if not more, probably set some record for most goaltends, etc  You know everything Andre Drummond gets flack about? He's basically a carbon copy of what Dwight Howard was for us."
Weird way to spell Andre Drummond
lol im just trying to imagine deandre jordan and andre drummond on the court at the same time
"For the fun of it, I tried to make the worst reasonable super team under that definition, 2016: Carmelo Anthony, DeAndre Jordan, and Andre Drummond"
"&gt;Harden Rockets years have to be recognized as a failure and regardless of win %, it means nothing when you can't make the finals?  As opposed to the very successful Andre Drummond Pistons of the same era"
"&gt;Andre Drummond  Going to have to respectfully disagree on that one, though it's a common refrain.   If anything, I always thought Andre was super fortunate to be playing in today's NBA, where the paint is emptier than it's ever been and where teams play spread small ball, allowing him some of the most unobstructed rebounding lanes in post-merger history.   Moreover, in the age of the spread pick-and-roll, that dude's been able to average over 16 points per game despite having one of the worst offensive skills sets I've ever seen out of an all-star center... ever. Guy just gets to feast one point blank alley-oops and tip-ins (often from on the aforementioned pick-and-roll).   Andre Drummond in the 1990's or prior is in trouble. Suddenly he's not just warding off Myles Turner for his rebounds, he's dealing with Antonio Davis &amp; Dale Davis, not to mention a rebound-hungry Otis Thorpe and Jerome Williams on his own side, all crammed into the paint at once, vying for that rock.   And without the prevalence of the spread pick-and-roll, I'm not really sure how that dude's scoring in the 90's or prior because no team in their right mind would give that dude more than a couple of post touches per game. And instead of running into a Rudy Gobert or Joel Embiid a few times a year, it's not hard to imagine Andre getting very lost among the shuffle of Shaq, David, Hakeem, Patrick, Rik, Rony, Vlade, and Dikembe."
Andre Drummond doesn’t play for the Lakers anymore.
"Every era is the wrong era for Andre Drummond, no era is gonna cure him having no touch around the rim or him trying to do way too much"
Other candidates:  -	Cliff Robinson -	Reggie Miller -	Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf -	Boban -	Andre Drummond
"You know what? I usually have a bias when it comes to Ohioans. I've said some pretty rotten stuff. But between this, and what's become a mutual disdain for Andre Drummond by Detroit/Cleveland fans, I can honestly say you're pretty fucking okay, guy. Hope we get some good games from both of our teams."
"That's a terrible assessment of Kuzma.   How do you brush everything off as he wants to be the star when he changed the way he played for the better of the team? His early years he wasn't much of a defender, but he was one of our best wing defenders when we played the Clips. He carved up a very nice role rebounding until the Lakers picked up Andre Drummond.   Let's see how well Kuz scores in a different team considering he was good before LeBron got here and good after Bron pulled his groin."
Ben Simmons?  Rudy Gobert?  Zach Lavine?  Blake Griffin(in DETROIT?) D'Angelo Russel? ANDRE DRUMMOND? John Wall?  Demarcus Cousins?  De'Andre Jordan?  Melo?  Isiah Thomas? Kevin Love? Demar Derozan? Lamarcus Aldridge?
"i watched the entire thing at 6x speed. it's not THAT bad of a list  how is andre drummond #165? how is he above al horford, bradley beal, jrue holiday, john wall, KAT, brad daugherty? kevin love over yao ming? billups over reggie miller? moncrief over miller?"
I hear the same about Andre Drummond... will be seeing first hand this year UNFORTUNATELY 😔
I was told that it's currently a tie between Andre Drummond and Ben Simmons.
"Even in elimination, we saw Reggie's stock and reputation jump through the roof this year, even as I watched him do a lot of the things he was actually already doing in Detroit five years ago to little fanfare.   Had the Clippers won, with Reggie playing the way he was, I have little doubt many would look at his career through a completely different lens in hindsight. It doesn't feel like a stretch for the same people who trashed him since OKC to suddenly flip the script and play the card of, ""Nooooo man, he was *always* good. He was balling out in Detroit and made Andre Drummond look competent. It's just that injuries took him out and the Pistons sucked. They failed Reggie.""   (I happen to think there's some truth to that line of thinking but I'd get hammered for it prior to Reggie's run this year.)  Those 2004 Pistons were widely lionized after the fact though. Just kind of a weird circumstance. Usually it's the guys who've been all-stars for years who finally reach the top. This time around, it was mostly guys who'd never been all-stars (or rarely) who struck gold then reaped the rewards for years down the line."
Yeah Andre Drummond was all nba one year too. Voter screw up sometimes
Here comes Andre Drummond!
People on Reddit would treat Wes Unseld like Andre Drummond.
Well the mongols beg to differ. Grab a rebound meant for Andre Drummond
"Wilt &gt; every center ever  He was 7'1"", 300 pounds, could leap somewhere between 36 and 48 inches, bench 500 pounds, and starred in division 1 track and freaking field.  He's stronger than Shaq, faster than Kareem, and better at free throws than Andre Drummond."
Yet somehow Andre Drummond keeps getting contracts.
Andre Drummond would block your shot so hard it would make the earth flat
"Andre Drummond.  Blow right by him, wait for him to leave his feet, easy bucket"
You think Dlo is the PG version of Andre Drummond?
As a Pistons fan who's had to watch countless Andre Drummond and Greg Monroe games yeah.  On the other end I've also watched many 15pts on 15 shots but by far the best player on the floor games by Billups
"I remember watching Andre Drummond get 30/24 a few years ago against the Jazz. And as you can expect, I had zero idea his stats were that good til the end of the game. Until you watch Pistons Drummond, you can’t truly comprehend how a player can have such a great stat line and still have minimal impact on the game."
"I always thought Andre Drummond had a Ben Wallace type of offensive skill set but played like he thought he was Hakeem. Andre has some of the worst hands and offensive arsenals I've ever seen but if you caught him sticking to only doing the simple things (dunking lobs thrown by Reggie in the spread pick-and-roll, tipping misses), he was liable to have a monstrous 20-20 night despite literally not doing a couple basic things beyond a rudimentary level.   (The Andre struggle, of course, was *always* the fact that he wanted to be more than that. Isolate on the wing, demand post touches, crossover into defender's chests for contested 13-foot floaters, spot-up for three, stand around and mope when you don't get that foul call, etc.)  Subsequently, it's not too difficult for me to imagine prime Ben Wallace in that rim-running role instead. In fact, it makes me salivate a little. If I could just excise all the garbage Andre brought along with him and swap it out for someone who never stopped working, lived for spoon-fed dunk opportunities, and was amazingly relentless all over the court, well, by golly, that's Ben Wallace and it'd be amazing.    Another way I look at it - 6-foot-8 Pistons rookie Isaiah Stewart came in and averaged 7.8 points per game in 21 minutes a night with very little in the way of a get-buckets mentality. He's not a Ben clone because I've seen Stewart showcase a bit of a soft touch here or there, but he's limited enough offensively that I think it's worth noting that big dudes can come into the league and put points on the board these days if they know their roles and stick to them."
"As someone who was subjected to Andre Drummond for eight years, I think Ben Wallace would have a chance at higher efficiency in today's game than he did back then.   With the increased relevance of the spread pick-and-roll, I could see Ben Wallace eschewing his little post touch or two that Larry Brown used to give him every game in favor of just making a couple pick-and-roll rim-runs. There's a number of big men out there in today's game who are averaging a hyper-efficient 10 points per game or more despite limited offensive skills simply because they know their role (dunk lobs, tip misses). And contrary to Drummond, Ben wouldn't have been out there trying to isolate on the perimeter, shoot threes, or insist upon multiple floaters per game.   Ben's scoring production peaked at 9.5 and 9.7 points per game but it occurred in a Larry Brown era that'd begrudgingly give him a few more looks in the post to make him feel involved; that led to a drop in efficiency. I'd say his surrounding seasons (2003 under Carlisle and 2006 under Saunders) would be easier to translate, when he averaged around 7 or 8 points on over 50 percent shooting, sticking more closely to what he could actually do. His role those years would translate well to today's game and I could see it result in another bucket or two a night on account of the prevalence of the aforementioned spread pick-and-roll.   And splitting hairs, but Ben averaged over 13 points per game for his career at Virginia Union. Obviously not a force of nature but worth noting regardless in the face of the suggestion that he could only muster 6."
"Brandon Jennings, Josh Smith, Andre Drummond, Greg Monroe….."
"&gt;Chuck wasn’t as athletic as Zion  Understatement of the year.  &gt;a far better post scorer and rebounder so he still would be great  He'd be a 6'6 Andre Drummond. As for his post scoring, good luck getting those shots off."
Andre Drummond. I really thought he'd be what Embiid became.
Andre Drummond
I’d toss Andre Drummond out there as a UConn fan. Busted in college and never showed enough in the pros but his physicals were always insane
"They should've kept Ricky Rubio instead of going with the PG version of Andre Drummond. They'll be out the playoffs unless ANT takes a huge leap, but him and KAT also have to stay healthy. Probably an 8-9th seed at best"
"Well... I'm going to throw a curve ball out here.   Guys like Fox and KAT may be underrated, much in the way that Devin Booker has been underrated given that the Suns sucked for so long.   The thing is, most fans still think these guys are great players.  I think that, to find a player who is truly underrated, you have to go for a guy that people absolutely shit on .  So I'm going with a coin toss between Andre Drummond and Dennis Schroder.   People are absolutely shitting on those two, and the are actually solid players.   People are bemoaning Schroders poor play in this year's post season, but they ignore that, while recovering from COVID, he dropped three 20+ point games to go with those single-digit and zero-point point performances.   He isn't a bad defender. He's a solid play maker. A solid shooter when in a regular system. And he can score and create shots.   Drummond, well... he's not the defender you'd hope a center would be; however, he's one of the league's best rebounders, and for those who say ""He just grabs his own misses,"" well... if that were true, then that means that his efficiency is somewhere over 90% on field goals (he has shot an average of 11.4 FGs per game and has missed an average of and average of 5.3 while grabbing 4.7 offensive boards.   That means that he only misses 0.6 shots a game (by that logic). Of 11 shots?  That means he's scoring over 94% of the time that he's given a shot.   And there is no denying his defensive rebounding skills.   &amp;#x200B;  So if we are talking truly underrated players, I'd have to go with those two."
Andre Drummond would suddenly become the most valuable player in the league
Lance Stephenson and Andre Drummond in Philly would be scary
"I heard a national media person say that Andre Drummond is better than Dwight. Even at Dwight's age, I don't think that's true"
"You’re insanely wrong, in 2015-2016, Andre Drummond took a whopping 5 post ups a game and scored 0.73 ppp, which is extremely terrible. He played 81 games that season as well so it’s a very good sample size. He scored 0.73 ppp on 4 attempts pg the next season"
"It takes very elite post skills for a center to actually be able to generate enough ppp for teams to want to run part of their offense through them. Rudy gobert isn’t going to come back after the summer with embiid/jokic like touch, so there’s no point. The big man post up is “dead” unless we’re talking about an actual star player with amazing talent. If gobert actually took a summer to try to improve his post game he’d just come back looking like Andre Drummond"
"Andre Drummond up until about a year ago, not in NBA history but he definitely comes to mind as being very overrated recently"
Outside of the legacy guys like old Kobe and Dirk it's still Drummond  I would take 5 minutes of Yao Ming over a full season of Andre Drummond
All my diamonds pissed on ayy Andre Drummond
Imagine thinking that NBA Superstar Andre Drummond chose that for a baby mama.  The IG model who appears later in the video is the mom.
The Andre Drummond of guards
That's what my point is though if I give Andre Drummond all the credit in the world and assume that he shoot significantly better in practice then I can still find people who are going to shoot better than that. Heck for example Jeremy Lin shot 85% give or take from the line during games so he would probably be better during practice as well.  I'm not saying Andre Drummond is bad at free throws I'm saying just based on the number of people who are on Reddit you're going to find it least one person who can shoot 90% in practice
andre drummond is statistically on track to have a better career than mutumbo and mourning
"i mean, if andre drummond was asleep inside, do we all think this kid would've died?  that the man and the woman that are in the video would've just stared at a toddler in the pool and said ""whelp, andre's not arround, guess we're just gonna let this kid drown""?  the woman was literally moving to get the kid and probably would've gotten there a few seconds after drummond did."
Andre Drummond stole that rebound from the guy closer to the pool. Bad teammate he’s just stat padding
And just like that I am an Andre Drummond truther
Andre Drummond
Ben Simmons. Ben Simmons is always the answer. Regardless of fanbase. Always Ben Simmons. Jk.   Probably DeAndre Jordan will catch some heat considering he sucked so hard for the Nets last season. Basically Andre Drummond 2.0
"&gt; They didn't just lose Murray. They lost Barton as well. That's your two top guards. The only decent guards they had left were Morris, campazzo, and rivers. And then Morris got hurt too. The on off splits for jokic in the playoffs were insane. He was their offense entirely, if you say that he had a better team around him then steph when their run ended (or even when the playoffs began), you simply don't realize the impact of what he was doing to get his team to that point.  Right, their teams were about equal *in the playoffs*, I'm addressing the fact that Curry's team wasn't healthy for the entire season, so using making the playoffs, like the guy I first responded to was, as a way to vault him over Curry is a terrible example.   &gt; Also, about the suns series Jokic isn't going to be guarding two of the best guards in the league 20 feet from the basket and recover to cover ayton by himself.   No one said he was responsible for guarding them on the perimeter, the fact of the matter is he can't even remotely cover them when they drive because his interior defense was non-existent leading to a 64% scoring under 9 feet.   &gt; Did you know jokic was 5th in defensive win shares last year? By no stretch of the imagination is he a bad defender.  Not only are defensive advanced stats practically useless, as admitted by their own creators, but using one single stat to label a player a good defender makes no sense. By this logic Russell Westbrook and Andre Drummond, who are also awful defenders, are also good defenders.   &gt; Steph lost in the play in game this year. Those two, really  As if Jokic is dragging that GSW team anywhere near the playoffs this year either  &gt; Did you miss that in all three of the years Jokic has been in the playoffs, he's made it past the first round?  Ya lol playing against cans, AD lost twice in the first round to GSW. 6th rank Portland, 7th rank SA, and 6th rank Utah aren't anywhere close to GSW in the years that AD lost so I'm not sure why this comparison is even being made.   &gt; The nuggets have been in the top half of defensive metrics for the last 3 years. The offense is incindeary, but the defense is really solid to very very good. Part of that js jokic being in the right spot and having good teammates to help.  Yet in the playoffs, their interior defense has been heavily exploited and one of the main reasons for their playoff losses. The Lakers and the Suns shot 72% and 66% at the rim vs the Nuggets in the past two playoff series'.   &gt; Saying ""the last time they were healthy"" is a huge caveat. AD hasn't played a full season ever. He had 3 months to rest before the bubble. Bron is 36. He's not going to be playing full seasons anymore either. If those are the stars you need to depend on, you are praying for a lot of good luck. And then we come back to Kawhi. He tore his ACL. That's a huge injury.  I've already said assuming health before I even made the argument and said Jokic would be top 5 without that assumption. I also never even put AD in the top 5 conversation. But even with what you wrote, load managing means nothing. Both Kawhi and Bron have accomplished far more than Jokic has ever accomplished in the playoffs in recent seasons when available."
Andre Drummond
"Ohhh you mean his personal workout videos? I thought you meant in game highlights. I mean, Ben Simmons and Andre Drummond are draining threes in those videos. There’s a reason they (along with KP) don’t do that stuff in game."
"I love Richard Hamilton but it's 1000 percent Joe Dumars.   That's the danger of BasketballReferencing (though it's a nice place to start if one wasn't around to watch certain players).   Dumars was an anchor and in addition to his offensive prowess, he was long known as one of the premier perimeter defenders in the NBA (cited by Michael Jordan among the toughest he'd ever faced).  Hamilton deserves all sorts of credit; he even deserves more love for competing with Kobe Bryant in the 2004 Finals (this matchup is often attributed only to Tayshaun Prince). However, in the scheme of things, it's Joe all day and all night.  P.S. I hate comparing Pistons to Pistons because I love them all. Except Josh Smith. And Andre Drummond. And Bill Curley."
"Here's what you get:  The Showtime NFT will include;       1. Co-designing a pair of basketball sneakers with Andre Drummond that he will wear in-game next season       2. Tickets for two to that game       3. Flight and hotel accommodations (for two) for that evening       4. Take home the game worn co-designed sneakers that Andre Drummond will autograph after the game and hand deliver to the purchaser of this NFT      5. Digital high resolution copy of The Showtime NFT      The funny part is the NTF is all aligned around Lakers colors/Hollywood sign in the background.  Oops."
"Andre ""Butterfinger"" Drummond probably"
I asked for trade offers around the league for Ben Simmons in the NBA 2K22 franchise mode. Here were the three best offers:     * **Ben Simmons for Khris Middleton**    Don't know what the Bucks are thinking. They just won a championship and now they are trading one of their key pieces. Simmons and Antetokounmpo is some awful spacing.   * **Ben Simmons and Danny Green for Brandon Ingram and Garrett Temple**    Don't know what the Pelicans are thinking. This might be the last straw for Zion. Zion and Simmons is some awful spacing.     * **Ben Simmons and Andre Drummond for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Ty Jerome**    This is totally unrealistic. Presti isn't getting any picks.
"I've just been informed Andre Drummond is also headed to Sac, and Haliburton is now a Sixer"
Andre Drummond as  tank commander can if you want a 40 point blow out loss. Run everything thru Drummond he will miss shot offensive rebound miss shot offensive rebound miss shot offensive rebound x12
Andre Drummond once shot 36 free throws in a game and ended with 17 points   https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201601200HOU.html
How about an Andre Drummond joke?
"Andre Drummond-type big.   Fantasy stud like Drummond, but essentially empty stats IRL"
"So does Andre Drummond and Embiid, yet that still happened"
"No don’t worry, Bum Simmons, DLO (guard Andre Drummond), Canthony “I’d rather do football” Edwards, and Softie KAT won’t make a single point, much less win a game"
"Andre Drummond, obviously."
"If I was Embiid I would be done with the franchise too, all Morey has done this offseason is squander the value of the 2nd best player on the team and signed Andre Drummond as a backup center. Plus Doc Rivers is still the head coach despite another incredible playoff collapse. Honestly Joel should just be done with the floundering franchise and demand a trade to south beach."
Who said I typed that with a straight face? Andre Drummond was an all star. They don’t always get those things right.
When andre drummond was with the pistons he’d come play pick up basketball at our local joe dumars (rec center) it was pretty awesome as a 15 year old.
"According to LEBRON, Andre Drummond is ranked above Giannis, Simmons, and Paul George for defensive impact."
"Do not watch Andre Drummond! But definitely watch KD, he just plays perfect basketball"
"It's easy to be a draft savant when you have hindsight on your side.  I am looking at the drafts now in fact. Look at the top 5's:  2013: Bennett, Oladipo, Otto Porter Jr, Cody Zeller, Alex Len   2014: Wiggins, Jabari, Embiid, Gordon, Dante Exum   2 out of 10 players ended up being great. If anything it makes the Cavs look better for trading while the guys still had high value.  The guys still available when they drafted Waiters were Thomas Robinson, Lillard, Harrison Barnes, Terrence Ross, Andre Drummond, Austin Rivers, Meyers Leonard, Jeremy Lamb, Kendall Marshall, John Henson, etc. So in all these scenarios there's one really great player that they missed (and 4-5 other teams passed on as well). If they took Giannis #1 in 2013 the GM would've been fired on the spot.   The Bennett pick is bad and one of the worst of all-time. But even that the likely alternative would've still been considered one of the biggest busts ever (unless they took Oladipo). I remember the hype leading up to the draft Alex Len was the most common projected #1. The other picks range from average to pretty good. They took TT over Jan Vesely, Biyombo, Knight, etc. Kyrie over Derrick Williams."
"Not to mention that when Embiid sits out games, Andre Drummond will be starting in his place."
"&gt; All legends for a reason  Ah yes, the 11th best player of all time, Neil Johnston.  I also always knew Anthony Davis was the 3rd greatest player in NBA history.  Andre Drummond over John Stockton? Who wouldn't think that?"
andre drummond &gt; kareem  my opinion
Playing with Andre Drummond lol
Andre Drummond and last years Lakers.
Andre Drummond must clearly be a better defender.
What’s surprising to me about this is that Andre Drummond has more blocks than LeBron
He saw Andre Drummond working and lost it
https://www.sbnation.com/2018/2/25/17051044/andre-drummond-dribble-highlights-video-pistons-kemba-walker
He saw Andre Drummond working on his handle and lost it
"Andre Drummond averages &gt;17 rebounds, 13.2 of them offensive rebounds"
"“I miss what you miss in 10 years, in 1 day”   -Andre “Chris Brown” Drummond"
They were talking about andre drummond
[Here’s an article about this if you’re interested](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/21332122/nba-andre-drummond-dramatic-free-throw-improvement-driven-back-basics-approach)
"Dwight's the only guy within 2500 of the ORB record and if Andre Drummond is going to be a backup from here on out, he's not getting anywhere near it (he has just over 3000 for his career and would be the one that could come closest to it)."
Andre Drummond averaging 15+ rebounding and the defensive wall for the team. He should play in starting 5 for atleast 25min on court to show his full potential
"Yeah like I know the Andre Drummond hate is now kinda circlejerk around here nowadays (rightfully so), but cmon that was a solid stat line and no one was upset about that back then. That was when he was having like 20 boards semi consistently, not bad for a third team."
"25 15 no impact, Andre Drummond."
&gt;I don’t understand why people have a problem with the 2nd best player in the league joining the team he lost to. The team that should’ve repeated if it weren’t for bullshit suspensions and injuries  And in another thread &gt;Andre Drummond is a good player   Lmao
"Andre Drummond had better numbers across the board in both his all star seasons, including defensively."
You literally just signed at his prime all star andre drummond for the minimum. Thats honestly absurd
"cant think of one, maybe andre drummond?"
Being benched for Andre Drummond is far from perfectly and probably not the way he thought his career would end in the NBA.
"There’s players who are more effective than comparably athletic counterparts. Like Trae Young, Jokic, or even Luka. Then there’s players who underperform based on their build and athleticism. Like Andre Drummond.   Then there’s Giannis, who is a top 3 basketball athlete of all time and performs about how you’d expect a guy with that much physical gifts to perform. He’s not particularly skilled, but he’s not unskilled either. He physically overmatches his opponent and dominates. He’s not crafty or an elite shooter or something, but he’s the best player in the league despite his lack of an elite skill set. There’s no reason to take it personal, nobody is saying anything negative about him."
"He can hang out with his friend, Andre Drummond"
"&gt; Like Harden is at the strip club A LOT, but what do people think he does when he isn’t there?   Depends on their agenda. The people that just hate his guts will say he doesn't practice, which is obviously BS.  &gt; You can easily tell when someone isn’t putting in the work, they’re either out of the league or they just stagnate and eventually end up out the league anyway.  Andre Drummond"
"With recent buyouts like Andre Drummond, Blake Griffin and now this, I wonder if teams will start to be more weary about offering those sorts of deals in the first place."
You probably think Andre Drummond is good too
Did you google “Andre Drummond is a jerk”
"I'm not gonna lie, I've never been anywhere close to an NBA level player but I'd still be a little bitter about my spot being given to Andre Drummond."
I'm sure you can. But you can also find guys on rosters who are worse like Andre Drummond. There is value in knowing your role and playing within it.
&gt;Andre Drummond Admits He Intentionally Elbows Teammates in the Face for Taking His Rebounds  https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oxmxb4/andre_drummond_admits_he_intentionally_elbows/
I’m out of the loop. Why do people dislike Andre Drummond ?
yea it sucks for guys like that who are incredibly skilled at the game but just can’t stay on the floor in this era. We watched Roy Hibbert/Al Jefferson/Joakim Noah/Andre Drummond/Greg Monroe go from stars at the end of the low post days to cast out/almost cast out of the league entirely.
Can't wait for Andre Drummond to tweet out 3 laughing emojis when this list goes up.
&gt; for some reason nobody stops them from trying to post up and doing all the shit  In an interview last season JB Bickerstaff said he was encouraging Drummond to bring the ball up and initiate the offense more. I thought for sure we were going to get the Colangelos sicced on us for such obvious tanking. Hopefully some day we can publicly thank Andre for getting us Mobley.
So like Andre Drummond
So is Tobias Harris and Andre Drummond.
"Why is he still pretending he’s 28. He’s old, and it seems he doesn’t have the athleticism he once did. Even if he did, leagues different now; you can’t afford defensive liabilities on the perimeter at the 5 anymore unless they’re transcendental talents elsewhere (Gobert with interior D, Jokic with offense).  Btw, this is why I pray for all the people of Philadelphia. They have Andre Drummond, the nightmare. He’s their bench center. I hope they are prepared for the 10 game stretch where he starts due to injury, and all the minutes he sets his woddling webbed feet upon the court. The sheer lack of skill in his finishing, shooting, passing, defending, or personality ensures his fate there, and thus yet another year in the 76ers championship window would be squandered"
Andre Drummond is that guy. Minimal effort and calls foul every time he gets the ball.
Grandpa Mark Gasol is slightly superior to Big Penguin Andre Drummond
"Things to take away:  \- Collin Sexton had a few nice drive &amp; dishes, look for him to improve his playmaking abilities this season. He's always been a tank but he looks even... tankier in this video? Not sure if it's just the tank top maybe Cavs fans can chip in.   \- Scottie Barnes' 1v1 defense is insane considering he was able to shut down THJ &amp; Mitchell on two isolation plays. Obviously the NBA is going to be much faster, but this is a good sign for Scottie/Raptors fans.   \- Andre Drummond is absolute garbage lmao"
It’s 100 years to early to be benching Marc Gasol in favor of Andre “Daniel Jones” Drummond
Andre Drummond
Hassan Whiteside and Andre Drummond
"Russell Westbrook because I can't believe that someone with his athletic gifts can be so dumb with his shot selection.      Ben Simmons because I can't believe that someone with his athletic gifts can be so Inconsistent with when he chooses to be assertive, since when he chooses to be he's dominant.      Andre Drummond and Hassan Whiteside because I can't believe how someone with his size and strength can be so brain dead defensively and so dumb with their shot selection on offence."
"Andre Drummond. The dude is goofy as fuck, but maybe if he focused a bit on improving some new aspects of his game, he could be playable. Especially in Detroit it just seemed like he was just happy to be there but never elevated himself. The dude is has the tools to be far more dominant."
Went through the comments and couldn’t believe I didn’t see Andre Drummond. Dude had crazy potential and talent but cannot for the life of him get motivated enough. Even on the court… Pretty much sure Embiid ruined his psyche too.
"I was thinking Andre Drummond, but it works for Simmons too."
Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond on the Pistons is the epitome of empty stats.
"Chris Paul, Andre Drummond, Draymond Green, Isiah Thomas, Jeremy Lin."
Overall it’s a different game as time goes on. I don’t know if this is proof he would average 40… who’s know he could just be a Andre Drummond in today’s game and Andre could have average 50 back then but we wouldn’t ever be able to prove that
The Andre Drummond Experience has taught me that you are probably right.
"I think as usual with these questions, the Lakers would be one of the favorites. Lakers would have  PG Gary Payton  SG Mitch Richmond  SF Dennis Rodman (he came into the league as a SF, won his first DPOY with the Pistons as a SF and that was arguably his best overall season in his career)  PF Karl Malone  C Maurice Lucas (or Spencer Haywood who’s a HOFer or Tyson Chandler or Andre Drummond just for laughs)  That’s 5 HOFers and there are plenty of guys you can put off the bench who were solid like a Haywood/Chandler, Caron Butler, Danny Green   Adrian Dantley played 1.5 years, otherwise he would be on there too."
"People really thought Andre Drummond was the missing piece  I know AD was hurt and Bron might not have been 100% either, but Drummond just sucks lol"
"&gt; Like Andre Drummond, he is good value at a vet min as a backup big.   Nets fans heavily disagree"
Is he worse than Andre Drummond?
We’re watching Andre Drummond become one right now.
Andre drummond genuinely has the worst bball iq in a nba player i have ever watched. The moment his athleticism dips he is gonna b gone from the league. He genuinely is bad at everything except rebounding. Ive never seen a worse offensive center. On defense hes a lazy motherfucker with no iq. When it comes to basketball he has a fucking brick for brains. Everytime he got on the court I knew he was either gonna put up a terrible shot or turn the ball over at least once trying something he cant even do in practice. Id rather have DJ cuz at least he doesnt think hes fucking hakeem olajuwan. Drummond is a lazy mf who thinks hes better than is while DJ is jus a lazy mf.
Andre Drummond tier?
"Like Andre Drummond, he is good value at a vet min as a backup big.   But if he demands to be a starter like Drummond, best to let him go."
Where would gs get stops?  Hack a Shaq.  Then they’d hit a three at the other end.  No way to quantify “face up game”?  Does Andre Drummond have a face-up game?  Did Patrick Ewing?   You can’t objectively tell?   LOL
The sequel to Andre Drummond!
Can't be worse than Andre Drummond.
I’m praying this doesn’t turn into another Andre Drummond situation for us again
"If Andre Drummond can be what Andre Drummond was in 2019 while being an all star, then Ben Simmons can be what Ben Simmons is."
Players in the 80s would have developed a 3 point shot cause Ben Simmons and Andre Drummond clearly have miraculously developed the same skill.  They also would have developed a cross over.   Just trust me.
"Andre Drummond has multiple All Star selections, has been named to an All NBA team, has led the league in rebounding several times and was a top 10 pick"
The Andre Drummond strategy
Oh you mean 11 minutes and 34 seconds of Andre Drummond crashing offensive rebounds
"I don't know that best of his ability is the right phrase. His problem on the court is that his productivity doesn't match his ability. He's not anywhere near as bad as Andre Drummond, but he has the same problem of being very talented and capable but he plays stupidly below his ability. The difference between the two is that at least Simmons' effort and production match his ability on one end of the court."
Awesome. Now do 11 minutes and 34 seconds of Andre Drummond hook shots.
"See, I don't even think there's solid proof he wouldn't be Tristan Thompson today. Where's that video of Mitchell Robinson or Andre Drummond maybe playing against guys in pickup and he legitimately looks better than prime Lebron. You become SO much better against worse players and SO much worse against good players.   It's literally impossible to tell. I'm not saying that would be true, I'm just saying it's literally impossible to know because all of these NBA players can really fucking hoop and the only reason they look bad is because they're against other NBA players."
"REPORT: the Cavaliers have traded Kevin Pangos, Colin Sexton, and Darius Garland for Ben Simmons and Andre Drummond"
Or even this [Andre Drummond Pickup Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG3YFUG2DQA)
"Yes, but the point is that there was a point in time where Andre Drummond was an All-Star candidate, while scalabrine never came close"
"lmao what? he usually shot 45% from the field, 36% from three, and 87% from the line. those are all respectable numbers when a ton of them are threes off isolation, and his free throws as well. His EFG% as well as his TS% are both great.   Educate myself on averages and usage rates? Good players get the ball. Whats your point lol?  He doesnt have chips because he kept losing to super teams. He underperformed at times but he never really had enough help.  Detroit is trash, you guys are literally the black hole of the NBA, andre drummond ran your franchise for a decade. The rockets won in 94 in 95, im not sure why you're still pounding your chest over a title from 2004"
Brian Cardinal was The Janitor. Andre Drummond is The Butler.
He's the Andre Drummond of guards
"Ontario income tax is similar to California.   I mean, it would have to be SUBSTANTIALLY more than the max to get people to travel halfway around the world to play. Leonard gave up two huge contracts to get back to Cali. And I suspect his feelings on the matter are more in line with other players. So, unless you want to pay like Andre Drummond a super duper max (which would be crazy), I don't think you will attract superstars that way."
andre drummond could be a damn rhodes scholar off the court for all I care but that mother fucker is the dumbest basketball player of all time
You ever seen Andre Drummond play?
"It would've been quite the thing to see him on any other team, especially one without an all time facilitator like Paul. DJ could've maybe ended up being Andre Drummond or worse without Paul."
"Last year they gave up, the front office shut it down fast. There is currently a good mix of experience on this team. Rubio and Garland running point gives us outstanding ball movement and unselfish basketball, something impossible with Andre Drummond or Sexton running PG."
Or Andre Drummond
"Also in the 20216-17 season:  Andre Drummond, Hassan Whiteside and DeAndre Jordan were starters who led the league in rebounds and were near the top in blocks.  Isaiah Thomas was the league's 3rd leading scorer.  John Wall led the league in steals and was 3rd in assists (edging out Ricky Rubio for his spot).  Kyle Korver, Allen Crabbe, Joe Ingles and Otto Porter were top 4 in 3pt accuracy.  DeMarcus Cousins set the high water mark for personal fouls.  Westbrook is the 4th oldest guy out of all the players I mentioned here."
"Nah, that's Andre Drummond."
Whiteside was never even close to actually being an all star level player in terms of positive impact.  He is the classic case of huge stats but actually kind of sucks if you watch him play much like Andre Drummond. Its no surprise guys like them never put up those numbers on actual good teams
He was never as good as Rudy tbh  He was like halfway between Rudy and Andre Drummond
"if they let Andre Drummond start, they're not going to ask Russell Westbrook to come off the bench that's absurd"
Man bringing Dwight back was one of the best decisions in the offseason. I shudder to think how bad we'd be if Andre Drummond was still our center.
Andre Drummond would like a word
I would support Andre Drummond if he chose not to get vaccinated
Andre Drummond out here being a problemmm.   For his own team.
How good would Andre Drummond be in the 90s? Serious question

Andre Drummond and Brook Lopez
"A few things:  First, it's hard to know whether Detroit wins their championships without Rodman, but I feel quite comfortable saying Chicago wins with a more traditional All Star type power forward because they did exactly that with Horace Grant. Obviously Rodman replacing Grant wasn't the only difference there. Rodman as a third star may have played a large part in lifting the team to their 72-10 heights, but I don't think he was the difference between a 3peat and zero titles. We're talking about a deep squad with MJ/Pippen/Kukoc here, the GOAT and a top 5-10 player of his era surrounded by great role players.  Furthermore, if the hypothesis is that Rodman's rebounding was his big impact skill, it doesn't really apply to Rodman while Detroit was making the Finals. During their 3 year run, Rodman never even averaged 10 rpg. He didn't have game breaking rebounding numbers really until the 91-92 season when Detroit was a first round out, their run effectively over. That squad was, again, extremely deep and I just don't believe Rodman with his good but not game breaking numbers was the difference between a near 3peat (had IT remained healthy) and no titles at all.  And again, at the peak of his video game rebounding numbers, Rodman was helping San Antonio implode in the playoffs. A first round out in 94, and the embarrassing 95 upset to the 6th seed Rockets. It's popular to pin that on Robinson, or attribute it to Hakeem putting in one of the all time playoff performances, but if Rodman is supposedly this all time impact guy, the Spurs should have had more than enough to at least push that series to 7 games.  I want to take a second to bring up another all time rebounder with an otherwise limited skillset: Andre Drummond. Here is a guy who hasn't \*quite\* rivaled Rodman's numbers, but has come pretty close. His peak of 16 rpg with 5 orpg is not far off Rodman's numbers, but it is very easy to see that Drummond really \*negatively\* impacts winning. Even as a role player in LA last season where you'd expect this central theme of The Case to be applied, it was clear that Drummond was not having any sort of positive impact. And LA eventually lost in the first round.  As for the whole ""in the modern game he'd have the team psychiatrist..."" thing, that's maybe true. But maybe not. It's pretty speculative, and in my view it sort of reduces Rodman's personality to something that can be ""fixed"". That's also ignoring the fact that guys still have issues in the locker room, and still quit on their teams sometimes. We've seen this with guys like Josh Jackson, Kevin Porter, and even with the Ben Simmons situation. Rodman's issues were incredibly deep rooted.  I think Rodman is extremely interesting as a player. He had a very unique impact. But I also think it's easy to misjudge impact simply because he is so unique and interesting. The fact is that Rodman really only ever played on great teams with pantheon level star players. It's tempting to give him a lot of credit for that, but to me that's almost akin to crediting Robert Horry for his 7 championships when really he just played with Hakeem, Shaq, and Tim Duncan."
Since Andre Drummond did [this](https://imgur.com/a/56ppP9K) the Lakers hadn't won a game
Trillionaire’s Andre Drummond but yes
"He did have one Andre Drummond  trait, missing easy ones and getting it back even people then noticed the statpadding and that's where the comparision stops, he was a brilliant player otherwise"
Thats cause there's not much about his game worth talking about. Rich man's Andre Drummond.
Bruh stfu. Yall talk about Russ as if hes Andre Drummond or some shit
Andre Drummond Sixth man LOOOOOOOOOL.
The opposite would be Andre Drummond in the post
Andre Drummond is statistically one of the greatest rebounders of all time. There’s so much more to the game than shooting efficiency.
Having Andre Drummond and Carmelo for the minimum is absolutely a good deal
Considering LeBron wanted Andre Drummond and Carmelo Anthony on his team I'm not sure LeBron knows what's best for LeBron
I got blasted on here when Drummond signed with the 76ers and my point is simple. He (Andre) is way better than that clown of a man Howard. Have fun because he is literally the dumbest basketball player I’ve ever watched. Also he is 38 year old man with purple hair.  TFK.  Technical foul king!
"a few weeks ago my answer would have been Andre Drummond lol. like just looking at him on/off the court made me angry, I audibly gagged when I got the Woj notification that he signed w the Sixers"

"I think the complaint is not so much as the lack of a foul call but rather the lack of a goaltending call against Deandre Ayton.  On a similar trajectory shot, Andre Drummond gets called for goaltending ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syOWS5yUYpM ) even though he caught the ball at almost the exact same spot Deandre Ayton caught it.  Personally, it doesn't matter to me if it's technically goal tending or not; I would just like the refs to be consistent in their calls."
Lakers are now 0-11 since Andre Drummond did the thing

"Superteams were still fun to watch without completely decimating the balance of the league during the Heatles era. It was when KD joined the Warriors that superteams reached a whole nother level. Sure watching the rest of the league gather up some kind of star talent was entertaining (Duke Pelicans) and somewhat helped to forget the guaranteed champs down in Golden State.   But then the Boogie Cousins *really* took superteams out of control. A player who could very well be the leading All-Star on his teams took an astronomical paycut just to get a free ring. Why? Because Golden State was the first place in Nba history where all you had to do was stay healthy and follow Kerr’s plan to win a ring.   The Brooklyn Nets are similar. Harden leaves the Rockets cuz he’s no longer happy there. And he doesn’t leave to go be the leader on another team. No, he is ok with downgrading from the No. 1 option to the No. 3 option. Why? Cuz the Nets are a favorite to win the ring. Then what happens next? Not one, but *two* Boogie Cousins emerge: Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldrige. 2 guys who could very well still play at All-star level force their way out to join the Nets. Again, because it’s the easiest and most guaranteed way to win a ring.   What makes it worse is that the fans looked to LA to stop the bullshit brewing in Brooklyn, so the Lakers started doing the same. Getting Andre Drummond, another player that may have been a fringe All-star in Cleveland, just to compete with the Nets.   This offseason just made it worse. Now, not only are washed or old All-star level players joining these teams, even high quality role players and *young* guys are taking paycuts to join them.   The rate in which these 2 teams are signing talent is just baffling. Hopefully the NBA, like what they did with foul baiting, will stop this crap cuz it’s just getting laughable."
"Ok, so he’s going to play in a different era with those rules, but those rules apply to everyone. He’s still faster, stronger, jumps higher, and technically better at almost every skill in the game. We can clown on Drummond for what he is in this era, but the skill gap is huge. There are guys playing at your local YMCA that would have made the league in the 60’s, and you wanna say that Andre Drummond isn’t going to dominate?"
"You’re acting like Jrue holiday and Khris Middleton are role players and aren’t stars. Your point basically proves moreys point. And yes we don’t need another super star but we need another star pg who can distribute and shit create. What role players do we need? We are stacked on role players. We have a very solid bench. Korkmaz, Isaiah Joe, Andre Drummond, Niang, Thybulle. Thybulle and Drummond provide good defense. Drummond provides good rebounding. They are all solid at defending. Korkmaz brings the shot creation and ball distribution, Joe and Niang are very good catch and shoot players. And then in our starting lineup we have three very solid role players, Curry, Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey. So which role players do you propose that make us into a title contender huh? 1-2 solid role players and we are just pushing out players like Joe and Maxey who are developing very nicely. The fact is we need another 20+ ppg player who can be relied upon on the perimeter in the fourth"
Double double with points and rebounds? Literally Andre Drummond.
"Who is to say Philly isn’t the desperate team with Embiid missing games all the time? With Ben they had someone who could pick up the slack and now they are relying on Andre Drummond.  Who are these teams that could get desperate? Twolves? Most they could trade is D’angelo Russel plus picks. They aren’t trading Ant.  Kings? They finally have a solid rotation and removing a piece from The trio of Fox, Haliburton, and Mitchell is a step backwards. Those guys are all cost controlled and actually like playing for Sacramento. Salaries matter for a small market team.   Indiana? Sure but all they can offer is Brogdon plus picks/Duarte or Levert??   Toronto? Masai ain’t about to be scammed by Morey. Masai already flexed on Morey by turning down Philly’s lowball offers for Lowry."
Tell Morey that so he’ll move on from Ben. He’s refusing to trade Ben for less than a superstar return.   We’ll see who’s actually sweating when Embiid cashes in his 20 vacation days and they don’t have Ben to pick up the slack. Unless you think Andre Drummond is the secret weapon to winning games with Embiid out of the lineup.   Embiid’s already a GTD for Friday’s game (game 2 of the regular season)
"Kevon ""Andre Drummond on the boards""  Looney"
"This sub would fucking hate prime Dwight Howard's guts if he was in his ""prime"" right now. He was like if Andre Drummond and Hassan Whiteside had a manchild together."
"Not trying to take away from AD, but before Jokic/KAT and Embiid got in the league the centre position was pretty rough. Andre Drummond made an ALL-NBA team during that era. Al Jefferson. DeAndre Jordan made 3 All-NBA teams sharing 2 of them with AD. The guard position has been incredibly stacked. Steph, Harden, Russ, CP3, Kyrie. It's a pretty unfair metric to compare Dame and AD."
"Andre drummond (so far, season is way young)"
"Andre Drummond. He's only played one game, but he's the most competent backup big Embiid has ever played with."
"It's totally posturing.  Simmons has the ultimate trump card.  He can just play like crap.  Or, more likely, just mediocre.  Make Andre Drummond-like bonehead plays on defense.  Shoot poorly often like Playoff Celtic Kyrie."
"Couldn't really think of all-time, but for right now, maybe:   Devonte' Graham  Gary Harris  Josh Jackson  Marvin Bagley III  Andre Drummond"
"The 76ers literally just signed noted all star Andre Drummond, pal"

This sounds like the opening to a new Andre Drummond fantasy novel.
"Andre ""Protoypical Point Center"" Drummond."
"God bless Andre Drummond, 6 points and 17 rebounds"
POINT CENTER ANDRE DRUMMOND IS BACK ON THE MENU FOLKS
Some shades of the Pistons Josh Smith-Greg Monroe-Andre Drummond
"Andre Drummond, and Dwight for what it’s worth, I think would both be exceptional adds for most of the contenders. Big physical bodies that can rebound and play defense will always have a use."
Andre “Dwight Howard” Drummond
Andre Drummond is the same guy who leaves a container of apple juice with half of a sip left  and than puts it back in the frig.
"Lmao Andre Drummond syndrome, youre not wrong"
"Nah the Raptors have Andre Drummond syndrome, we've been missing so many shots that we're inflating our rebound count. We got 16 offensive rebounds."
Welcome to the Andre Drummond Experience.
Andre Drummond said **I AM THE BEN SIMMONS NOW**
How is Andre Drummond in the NBA
"The modern day Josh Smith, Greg Monroe, Andre Drummond"
Vogel is the best defensive player on the team. This man had Andre Drummond and Schroder playing defense.
Andre Drummond.
I mean the dude also signed off on Andre Drummond lmfao
"That’s fine, Russ actively hurts  a team with his high usage and low efficiency game. His ts is 6 percent under league average. He’s a turnover machine. His defense is trash. He’s the guard version of  Andre Drummond"
So was Andre Drummond and he was booty
These the same guys that brought in Andre Drummond
"Giannis ""Andre Drummond "" Antetokounmpo"
"Well if he can board he’s basically Andre Drummond, so he’ll have that going for him"
Lookin like Andre Drummond in a tank top?
De Andre Drummond
"Funny enough, I was already doing an analysis on something related and I modeled some of the worst snubs of the last decade or so. Note, these are statistical snubs on fairly simple metrics (so no RAPTOR/EPM/DPM/LEBRON or older ones like PIPM/RAPM), so if a player missed a bunch of the early season, slumped early, or missed getting on because they just weren't recognized by either the fans or the coaches, that's not included.  * Jimmy Butler, 2021 (missed a chunk of games) * KAT, 2017 * Rudy Gobert, 2019 (mentioned by /u/NitroXYZ) * Bradley Beal, 2020 * Trae Young, 2021 (multiple mentions) * Damian Lillard, 2016 * Chris Paul, 2018 * Al Jefferson, 2014 (/u/jknuts1377) * Josh Smith, 2012 * Nikola Jokic, 2018 * Damian Lillard, 2017 (/u/AMos050) * DeAndre Jordan, 2015 * Clint Capela, 2019 * Blake Griffin, 2017 * Andre Drummond, 2019 * Stephen Curry, 2013 (/u/dmavs11 and /u/KareemWasTheGreatest)   Methodology is similar to dribbleanalytics' here https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bcdpls/oc_using_machine_learning_to_predict_the_2019_mvp/. One of the variables that isn't refined for this particular analysis is team winning percentage. End of season winning percentage was used (because it was already available for a different analysis) rather than record at the all-star break."
Andre Drummond 1% of the time
"Good to hear! I’m glad you were able to take a deep breath! So let’s talk about exaggerations. I did some research and couldn’t find a thing about Wilt having a 55” vert. I did find a few things claiming a 48” vert and a few  articles breaking that down to say he realistically had around a 35-40”. Should I link that? Although if you type in Wilt Chamberlain 55 vert it’s one of the first things that comes up. Also I couldn’t find anything verified that he benched 500lbs, but that really doesn’t mean too much. I’m sure Andre Drummond benched more than Rudy Gobert, that doesn’t really translate to the court. And if anything the whole averaging 50pts a year hurts your argument. It really shows the level of talent in the league, and when he finally went up against some decent competition (Bill Russell) his stats fell off dramatically. I can link that too if you want."
Andre Drummond trembling in fear
"he's playing the same way he always does, literally, his shot chat is what it always is, but now that they're not winning he's Andre Drummond, lmao okay"
"Lmao, he's having an Andre Drummond esque season. He's padding his numbers really well but, hasn't contributed to wins. Not to mention, he can't shoot outside the bubble."
"Andre ""No Touch Around The Rim"" Drummond"
"He put up good numbers but his impact was similar to Andre Drummond... great rebounder but often times a liability on offense because he would bust plays to post up (a shot that's extremely inefficient for him) and try to play point center (turnovers for days). Also his defensive effort usually wasn't there. That's why he bounced around so much, and why he was dumped for negative value a year after averaging 17/12 or whatever he did here."
"This is probably just as unbreakable as his MPG record. Just a quick look at a couple of current guys, Andre Drummond and DeAndre Jordan are probably the two worst notable shooters and they’re at ~1700 and ~1900 respectively. Giannis is the worst among high volume shooters and he’s at ~1200.  Nobody is ever touching this, you have to be supremely good at basketball while being exceptionally shit at FTs at the same time to a degree that’s difficult to believe."
wtf I love Andre drummond!!!
Andre Drummond looks like he has thanksgiving dinner every night
And Andre Drummond
If fox holmes hield Barnes Mitchell Halliburton can’t beat Charles bassey and Andre Drummond I don’t know if it’s the coaching
That’s pistons legend Andre Drummond to you
5 days ago they lost to a team whos best player was Andre Drummond
"&gt;he's an offensive black hole  Come on dude. I also wish he were better or more willing to take threes off the catch, but Andre Drummond is an offensive black hole. Tobias is a guy who's getting paid for more than he can provide."
RJ Barett with his right hand and Andre Drummond
"Before this post I would have guessed Andre Drummond but looking it up he's not even at 10,000, so I doubt it, kinda like how I doubt we get another 300 Win pitcher in baseball, the game has just changed so much"
I think thats called the Andre Drummond special
It's cause Andre Drummond is 28.
You see our game vs Kings this week?     Fox looked like shit and disinterested.  Hali didn’t score a point.  Buddy got swallowed up by Thybulle and blown by on D by Korkmaz.    Andre fucking Drummond dominated crunch time on the boards.      I don’t even want Fox.  Redundant with Maxey.  Fox defensive effort was embarrassing and it looks like he has quit.    They suck as a group.  Ben is better than anyone they got.   Having watched Ben for 4 years i don’t think it’s all that close.
Low point has to be getting closed out as Andre Drummond went full Rodman this week as Fox was completely checked out.
"&gt;  lacks self awareness  this has been the entire issue since the end of his Orlando days. From 2012 to 2019, he simply didn't understand that he wasn't Hakeem and sucked at posting up. He didn't accept that the best way for him to play was as a ""Tyson Chandler"" as Kobe wanted him to be. He didn't figure that out until his 2nd go round with the Lakers, after wearing out his welcome with every other team he had ever played for. By that time, the reputation damage was done.  That doesn't even touch the general apathy towards defense that he developed at some point during his post prime. Everything we say about Andre Drummond right now, applied pretty well to Dwight in Atlanta and Charlotte, where he put up great numbers, but still their teams had to pay just to offload him.  He's still a top 75 player no questions asked though, purely based on his Orlando days."
Drummond on limited minutes has been okay. He's a great rebounder and as long as he doesn't try to do too much he's fine as an Embiid backup. Starter Andre though...... ugh

Damn. Honest question what happened to Andre Drummond?
Andre Drummond
Goddamn Andre Drummond plays so soft. Idk how sixers fans put up with that.
Andre Drummond has been utterly horrendous tonight. Looks like he doesn’t give a fuck
He’s Andre Drummond
It's kind of funny how Andre Drummond looks like a completely clumsy oaf in front of other top athletes while still being more coordinated and athletic than 99.99 percent of the human population.
Andre Drummond called he said it's time for BOARD MEETING
"No that’s just you desperately trying to be right about something.  Caruso is objectively a much better shooter than THT lol. That’s all there is to it. I could say valancunis was more of a shooter last year than Andre Drummond. It’s true, it doesn’t make him a shooter.  It means he’s better at providing shooting than the player he’s being compared to.."
"Kanter has always been a big numbers, little impact player. He’s basically Andre Drummond but worse at everything besides scoring."
ANDRE DRUMMOND
"Moses, Rodman, and wilt. An under the radar great rebounder is Andre Drummond"
"i have a feeling buyout players will not favor LAL as a destination much this year... well, even last year they only got andre drummond."
The 22+ RPG average becomes far less impressive when you take pace into account. I’m fairly sure Andre Drummond by himself has multiple seasons higher than Russell/Wilt’s best in terms of rebounds per-100 possessions.
"Oh totally, but it's still impressive.  Also I just realized Andre Drummond has a higher career RPG average than Rodman, which is funny."
"At the final home game in The Palace and saw Andre Drummond score his 5000th career point, that was pretty amazing to see. I know Pistons fans hate Drummond but I'll always have a soft spot for him."
Andre Drummond lol
"lol this isn't like a Blake Griffin or Andre Drummond situation with $30 million a year  he's going to make $47 million on next years player option, unless a team is willing to pay him..maybe 40-45$ million he won't take a buyout"

Andre Drummond became a Sixer tonight
"Andre ""Not a Winning Player"" Drummond with the highest +/- of the game +19."
"There’s a lot you could say about Andre Drummond as a player but you can not say that motherfucker doesn’t get rebounds, man goddamn"
Andre Drummond on a minimum contract is just unfair. He should get a nice contract after this season. He's ballin. Great pick up by Morey.
Hall of Fame is not decided by Fantasy otherwise Andre Drummond and Hassan Whiteside would be all-time greats what kinda logic did you just use
Andre Drummond MVP
"Anthony Davis is top 3 in the league in Points in the Paint, is averaging 24/10.5/2 blocks on 57% TS and also a career high in Mid-Range shooting 45% from 16-3p line. He is 7th in the league in points, 6th in the league in rebounds, 3rd in Offensive Rebounds, 3rd in the league in Blocks, 1st in the league in 2 Point Field Goals but if you read r/NBA you will think he is just Andre Drummond"
Our franchise player for the last 15 years was Andre Drummond   It’s gonna take some getting used to lol bear w us
The first players I think of are Hassan Whiteside &amp; Andre Drummond.
Andre Drummond
"Andre Drummond is  an All NBA player, him and those 3 damn that's a 6peat"
"Only 39 behind Andre Drummond!   Jokes aside, he’s a monster"
"Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Hassan Whiteside, Steven Adams, Tristan Thompson, and Clint Capela for the 3 pt contest"
Andre Drummond is available for PJ.
There are very few legit empty stats players and most of the time they're role players. Andre Drummond is one of the rare empty stats guys who post actually impressive numbers
Because said guy can shoot them very well and they don’t like that if it was someone like Andre Drummond they would be all over it
Apparently he couldn’t even abuse Andre Drummond so idrk
"Just a reminder that during the Warrior's 73 win season, they lost to the Pistons. Who were starting Andre Drummond, Greg Monroe, and Brandon Jennings."
"I saw a thread comparing Andre Drummonds game to Dennis Rodman's and I thought that for the younger audience that didn't get a chance to see him play, this video did a wonderful job showcasing how unbelievable a player he was.  This motherfucker was only 6'6 - 6'7 and had 11 offensive rebounds in game 2 and 6 of the NBA finals(against a freakishly athletic Shawn Kemp in his prime), set several NBA single season rebounding numbers(as well as rebounding percentage in an era where the NBA was played at a slower pace), was a 2x defensive player of the year, could guard everyone on the court(and unlike Draymond Green, and Rodman dealt with larger monsters in the 90's and even held Shaq scoreless in the 2nd half + OT in one of there meetings), and despite his image in the media,  worked as hard or harder than anyone else on the court.  Rodman due to his anxiety and need to keep up his bad boy image, notoriously would spend hours alone by himself late into the evening/following morning after his team had left the gym working out and studying film to not only master defense schemes, but to learn where the offensive rebounds were likely to land based on who was shooting.    This man was a monster on a off the court, but for all you young guys that didn't get a chance to see his game, please don't compare him to Andre Drummond."
Andre Drummond layup  https://youtu.be/x1WB2290BfI
"I guess you’re right. ROTY Michael Carter Williams was super fun to watch his rookie year, so was athletic point guard Emanuel Mudiay, so was herky jerky triple double threat Elfrid Payton, so was low post savant Jahlil Okafor, so were Josh Richardson and Justise Winslow.. so was Stanley “the next Kawhi” Johnson  Rookie Andre Drummond was Uber athletic, boxing out people, grabbing rebounds, flashing handles and defensive plays here and there.. fun stuff"
anyone claiming they tuned into pistons games to watch Andre drummond is either a pistons fan or full of shit
"fun fact the highest drafted player on the sixers active roster is andre drummond at 9th overall  even more fun fact, outside of drummond, austin rivers was drafted higher than anyone on their team.  and drummond only barely beats him, rivers went 10th overall"
Andre Drummond should never start again. Charles Bassey stepped up for the Sixers off the bench. Seth Curry regained his rhythm. No one not named Jokic wanted to show up for the Nuggets tonight. Some of the Nuggets turnovers were brutal to watch. Nuggets need Jamal back. There was no Zeke Nnaji and that saddens me.
*Andre Drummond has entered the chat*
"The Harrell situation was just a perfect storm of everything going wrong. The Lakers literally didn't have a point guard for more than half the season due to injuries and COVID and poor roster construction, so all of Harrell's offense was pretty much ISO with poor spacing and put-backs, no pick and roll. The team envisioned recreating his synergy with Lou Will using Schroder, but Schroder just didn't fit the bill (hence why Harrell talked so much shit to him when they played this year). Vogel likes rim protectors, so Harrell didn't fit his defensive scheme. He basically played the exact same position as AD on our team, so he that squeezed him as well. Then the Andre Drummond situation happened. It was just the worst possible fit for him."
"Elite rebounder.  Honestly, not much difference between Andre Drummond, who has been actively sought by high-level teams trying to win a championship.  I’d rather have Kanter’s stiff hips than the terrible decisions Drummond makes."
I would have agreed with you but just look at the strides Deandre Jordan and Andre Drummond made in just a couple off seasons. These were career 35% free throw shooters
Just to get this straight - you think posting Defensive Box stats is evidence that Curry was a better defender than Kobe?  I really can't even begin to tell you how awful that is of a metric and of a tool in an argument.    Andre Drummond and Boogie Cousins led DBPM a few years ago so I guess they were the better defenders?
"Bam ""Andre Drummond"" Adebayo"
"That is true (about rebounding percentage, I don't know how ""Wilt had much better numbers"" is related to it... seems to contradict it).  But first of all, Rodman is not the 1st in history in the career rebounding percentage. That would be Andre Drummond."
"Andre Drummond, regular season Rondo"
Andre Drummond
"Being good at rebounding and nothing else is essentially useless. Look at Andre Drummond, who’s the best rebounder in the league, but is generally regarded as a useless player."
Andre Drummond has left the chat
"Prime Blake dragged a horrendous Pistons team to the playoffs. His supporting cast was Andre Drummond, Reggie Jackson, Luke Kennard, Wayne Ellington.   Throw prime Draymond on that 2019 Pistons roster and it’s a lottery team"
"It’s like when people get drunk and order random shit on Amazon, he’s gonna get wine drunk and trade half the team.  *Wakes up*  *Reads Headline*  “Lakers pull off 10-team trade to acquire Jeff Green, Blake Griffin, (the other) Brooks, James Johnson, Tyler Herro, and Andre Drummond (again). Enough to convince DWade to come out of retirement and join the Lakers.”  “Who the fu-… Did I…?”"
"I mean, I'm not at all in the ""Cade is a bust camp"" whatsoever and don't have a horse in this race, but are we really taking comfort in statlines that end with Andre Drummond comps as evidence of not being a bust?"
"Go back to Cleveland, trade all the young talent and picks for vets that get it like Jaymichael Green, Iguodala, Andre Drummond, jj reddick, Rajon Rondo, and the prize free agent/trade piece Derozan.          Edit: Fire the head ball coach and get Byron Scott as HC."
"To be fair, the way he tends to articulate it is pretty good for conveying the information, especially to audiences that may not be complete statistics nerds, so it makes sense to put things in a similar style.   When looking at overall impact to a game, I like to look at a combination of rate/efficiency stats, plus things like on/off numbers because then you get an idea of the players overall impact on how the team plays. Picking individual metrics rarely show the overall impact. For instance: Steph Curry's gravity and offball movement shows up a ton in terms of on/off numbers (and on/off efficiency) which would be very hard to represent via any kind of traditional counting stat. ORB% is a dangerous one because guys like andre drummond also are awesome at ORB% and absolutely trash on offense because a lot of their rebounds come from their own misses under the basket. Particularly interesting in the case of the Magic, because they were one of the worst offensive rebounding teams in the entire league during peak dwight.   While these kinds of stats are sometimes hard to separate team impact from individual impact (esp if a team always plays certain lineup combos so on/off data is conflated), the good thing in Jokics case is that none of it really matters. Regardless of methodology Jokics last year and a half or whatever is just staggering. Counting stats, on/off, efficiency, team based metrics, rate metrics, one number compounds, playoff vs regular season splits, etc all show him doing all-time level shit.   When looking at a combo of various metrics, my view is that Dwights peak years was that he was an extremely impactful player, but Lebron was a large margin ahead of him, and others like chris paul, KD, and Dwade were similar-to-more impactful each year. Jokic is a lot more like the lebron outlier than Dwight. Thats no disrespect to dwight, hes first ballot HoF and one of the best defensive players of all time. He just never did what Jokic has done over the last 2ish years."
Defense =/= rebounding.  Andre Drummond exemplifies this statement 🤷🏻‍♂️
PER basically rewards volume chuckers &amp; stat-sheet stuffers.   Its basically why the likes of Andre Drummond are so highly rated by PER despite the fact its obvious to most people he doesn't actually contribute that much to winning (at least until this season on the 76ers)
"isn't that bad means it's still relatively bad though.  To your point about being over the cap anyway, if the Sixers had somehow maxed Andre Drummond instead of signing him to a vet minimum, that would be a terrible deal, regardless of the fact that they're over the cap either way."
sure. the last time i remember a carry being called was on andre drummond lmao.
"Did you see how many put backs he blew? He makes those, we're winning. I'm not blaming the loss on him. But this is the Andre Drummond I feared."
"Looney isn't a plus athlete but he's not that bad either. He's listed at 6'9"" but he looks and plays a lot bigger out there. Just kinda how he's built with high set shoulders and a shorter neck. Wingspan/reach/etc he's similar in size to Andre Drummond, minus the bulk.   Wiseman is one of the most athletic bigs I have ever seen. Hope he pans out, early returns don't look to promising but there's a lot of time. I do think it's the right idea to encourage development as a stretch 5, but using him as a high energy, rim running,, basket protecting, bench big with the 2nd unit while he irons out the jumper is probably the best role this season"
How does he compare to Andre Drummond last year?
I mean. He’s better but that really doesn’t mean his defense is that good. Andre Drummond is better than Haslem. So what
Hed be Andre Drummond
"Nah man, clearly one single clip is enough to justify giving someone DPOY. That's why defensive legend Andre Drummond deserves DPOY consideration on an annual basis."
"If you don’t like that, you don’t like Andre Drummond basketball"
"I think that was actually a defensive lapse by Precious (and great movement by Curry).  OG got shook on the first crossover, but our scheme is usually to aggressively contest/run shooters off 3 point line and into help, which OG did after recovering.  But for some reason Precious ran out to Drummond at the 3 point line and it's Andre Drummond."

Andre Drummond. Not too far away from averaging 20-20.
Not if Andre Drummond has anything to say about it.
The question really is how many assets should Miami trade for Andre Drummond and Kevin Love.
Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond is a goddamn workhorse. Hardly missed any games in his 9 year career
"Based on the early returns from this season, it doesn't appear that was a blip. In the [Milwaukee Bucks](teamlink://347)' win over the [Dallas Mavericks](teamlink://338) on Friday night, Giannis went 1-of-10 from the line, which was lnot only the worst free throw night of his career, but one of the worst ever.   Only three other players in NBA history had ever shot less than 10 percent from the line in a game with a minimum of 10 attempts: Shaquille O'Neal, Andre Drummond and Al Horford. As a result, Giannis is now shooting a career-low 57.5 percent from the foul line this season, and he and the Bucks appear to have a major issue on their hands.   Holy shit"
If Andre Drummond played in 1960 would everyone today say he’d be a top 5 player because he’d be able to develop a jump shot in the modern NBA
Andre drummond
"nets need to trade deandre jordan, cash considerations, and some TPEs for andre drummond"
Andre Drummond
"That ""average team"" is only average because who they have to play. I jordans bulls were in the east they woulda been a 73 win team to. Andre Drummond was an all star in 2018 lmao. I would rather have to play the blazers then playing the bulls to."
"People really need to cherish KAT/Embiid/Jokic for entering the league bc the C position was in so much poverty, that we had to give All NBA to Deandre Jordan and Andre Drummond"
nets should trade for hassan whiteside or andre drummond if they want a chance vs the lakers
"Yeah I never understood this, at least for the guys who weren't fighting for their next contract. Maybe it's an image thing, like they don't wanna do an Andre Drummond and throw that sum bitch 12 rows deep"
Cavs got away with robbery. They also got Andre Drummond for free last year. I guess teams feel bad for them so they give them free shit.
You could get Kevin Love or Andre Drummond with that.
"Andre Drummond is not getting bought out, dude is playing way to get to bought out. Cleveland can trade him if they don’t want his contract because some team would at least trade a pick or two for Drummond."
Andre Drummond playing point center. Yeah definitely makes sense for him as a player.
I can't believe you would say that about certified point-center Andre Drummond!
Andre Drummond is gonna end up on the Nets. Book it

Andre Drummond requesting a buyout to play for the nets you heard it here first
Andre Drummond
"I don’t need some nerd stat to know the truth.   I’ve watched 90% of the Pistons games since like 1993. I’ve seen everything with Drummond. From my television, in person and on every single stat sheet.   Most Detroit fans rip him to shreds. I don’t. I like him.   He fills up a stat sheet unlike most we’ve ever seen at his position, but so much of it’s empty. He gets destroyed by most elite centers, or even pretty good ones, not just Joel Embiid.   He’s looked great so far this year. I’m happy for him. I really feel like he’s putting the work in.   Defensive Win Shares? That Pistons team wasn’t winning shit. I watched loss after loss. I watched Drummond get his numbers and often have little impact on the defensive end, which explains some of the lack of winning.   He has not been a Top 15 defensive player at any point in his career, prior to this season. He’s just not. He gets counting stats, but that doesn’t mean he’s elite defensively.   Again, I don’t want to rip on Andre. I like him and I actually think he got a bad rap and was unfairly casted in Detroit, however, don’t be ridiculous.   I’m proudly holding up my 2043 2nd round pick we received back for him in a trade. Clearly, lots of value around the league."
Robin Lopez is a better defensive center than Andre Drummond.   Why the hell would Washington trade 5 guys and a Top 10 draft pick for Andre Drummond? Wtf
"pretty much. this applies to a few players to varying degrees. i think some casual fans would be under the impression a guy like westbrook is a top five player when healthy but shot selection kills his value imo. on the end of the spectrum, no one knows who the fuck derrick White is as a casual but he's genuinely literally our best player when healthy.   andre drummond has some monster box scores, he must be great, but you miss all the things he doesn't do right that way. bu then again, KCP was 20 spots ahead of demar derozan on the ESPN list so who the fuck knows what consensus actually is on anyone. lol"
Andre Drummond is one of the greatest rebounders of all time. I don't think he'll ever make another all-star game. The duality of Drummond
I keep saying it. Andre Drummond can singlehandedly get a team to the 10th seed
fucking cavs legend andre drummond to u
Your team has won championships with MVPs and your favorite player is Andre Drummond?

People in 10-15 years gonna be like 'Is Andre Drummond a top 3 Center of all time' and then cite his stats
Lost to Andre Drummond and the Canton Charge. it’s a miracle we broke 90 in this game too. s/o Dotson for playing like trash in the first 3 quarters only to blow us up in the 4th lol  Bullock and Payton are so fucking bad. Payton getting subbed out quick for Quick (haha) in the 4th was the best thing to happen all game. stop playing him fucking mins. IQ is head and shoulders better.   this team may never win again with the current rotations. what’s frustrating is that the most glaring holes are SO easy to fix.
Would you like to hear about our lord and savoir Andre Drummond?
The Andre Drummond Experience is wild.
Knicks are losing to fucking andre drummond and his band of merry scrubs.
"Andre Drummond is a great rebounder. However, I also think the context of his rebounding is important.   My favorite Drummond rebounding moments over the hundreds of Pistons games I watched during his tenure: When the Pistons were making a late run and he’d follow up a miss at just the right time, inciting 7,000 fans in unison.   The most common Drummond rebounds: Uncontested in a mostly empty paint while teams played four-out, one-in and didn’t crash the glass. That, and those times where he’d tip his own point blank misses over and over.   Just as we look at guys like Wilt and account for the wild style of play of the time, it’s worth considering we’re in a super pace era as we speak with arguably less traditional bigs around the paint than ever, leading to plentiful pickings for a guy like Drummond. I bet Drummond’s still cleaning the glass in the 90’s but I’m guessing teams running Ewing, Oakley, and Mason out there on the front line would be seriously diluting his totals."
Yo one slightly used Andre Drummond coming up
Andre Drummond has played good defense this year
Can I offer you an Andre Drummond in this trying time?
jesus christ please stop  Andre Drummond is one of the worst players in the NBA.  He should be a meme like Kelly Oubre or Wiggins.
Andre Drummond trade?
"Yep, steals and rebounds are all it takes. That's why Andre Drummond is the 7x reigning DPOY."
"Andre Drummond is a perennial 15/15 rebounding beast that has a terrible TS% because he has an inflated usage rate from being the Tank Captain. Under the right system, with the right, mature, experienced coach, he would be back to all-star caliber form.  If your reasoning for him being terrible is anything more than, 'he can't shoot free throws', 'his true shooting percentage is shit!' You're just a statsheet viewer and not a game watcher."
I am the BIGGEST kemba critic and you are out of your mind if you think the Celtics should trade him for Andre Drummond. Kemba for like Jarret Allen would be more considerable for the Celtics but for DRUMMOND?  He’s a negative asset.
"I never said straight up; I'm sure you could get some of the Cavs' young talent in exchange as well; plus he's attempting 15 fga.... in what world should Andre fucking Drummond be shooting 15 FGA per game? In the right system, with a coach like Stevens, it would be better."
"Deandre is just not that guy anymore, nothing about his play recently has shown him to be what the Nets need him to be, and that's a big issue cause KD can not bang with AD, let alone Trez and Gasol. He needs to beef up to do that, and doing that will make running D'antoni offense hard, plus... is there time to do that? will he find that to be a good idea? KD is not a center it's a big deal for him to play in the paint with the freakishly heavy and athletic guys, and he's gonna need to do it for this team to win.   Nets need a PJ Tucker type, or if they're crazy and don't mind spending, Andre Drummond... someone with enough size to keep AD from gobbling up every second chance opportunity off the inevitable KCP missed 3. They don't have anyone competent right now and I think we'll continue to see them as a bad defensive team in the meantime."
"AD, Lebron, Giannis, Luka, Kawhi, Dame, Steph, Harden, Butler, Tatum, Westbrook, Jokic, Embiid, KD, Jimmy Butler, Chris Paul,  Paul George, Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Andre Drummond."
I’m looking at the top guys that are going to get dealt is....  1. Kyle Lowry  2. DeMar DeRozan  3. Andre Drummond  4. John Collins  5. Victor Oladipo
Andre Drummond. The Return.
Can you imagine being Jarrett Allen if the Cavaliers weren’t trading Andre Drummond? You’d have been banished to fucking Cleveland after playing in New York and doomed to watch him brick post ups while you’re wasting your potential and future earnings on the bench
Andre Drummond about to be the Nets killer wherever he goes.
"These defensive box score stats realllly love steals and rebounds, especially DPBM.  Andre Drummond is the current leader in defensive rating. Luka is 7th, and I don't think it's updated for his 4 block 2 steal game today."
I think they will trade Harris for andre drummond
Andre Drummond is the only stupid one.  They should release him.  Getting Jarrett Allen for what they paid was the biggest steal of the trade.
"Cutting Maker hurts. We had a lineup in our last game of Andre Drummond, Javale McGee, Thon Maker, Larry Nance Jr. and some guard (sorry, I don't know who's on my team at this point). They could have kept Thon for one game and given us Drummond, McGee, Maker, Jarrett Allen and Nance at PG."
"We got Drummond last year for cheap and now we'll probably trade him to some center needy team. Javale was brought in for one year to play backup after TT left, he might also get traded. Love is definitely a PF and Larry Nance is his backup, although now starting because of Love's injury, playing really well too. In any ideal situation Dean Wade and Bolden wouldn't get minutes but Love is hurt and Andre just missed a game. Jarrett was brought in to be our C if the future as he is 22 and we will likely be without both of our Cs next year."
"Scott Brooks: How about high lobs, 2 post ups a game, and putback jams?   Andre Drummond: Got it! Shoot threes, push the ball up the court, and iso Embiid.  In all seriousness, I agree he'd be good on the Wizards, especially with TBryant going down. :( We all know what Drummond can do, but he just does more than what he's consistently good at."
I remember Reports saying Kyrie didn’t want the Nets to Trade for Harden..who would you want to see them trade Kyrie for if it were to happen?? Maybe Andre Drummond? Blake Griffin? I don’t see them getting another superstar for Kyrie
"Why?  And for who?    You do know about salary matching, right?  With the combined cap numbers for Drummond and Love, pretty much the only players they could trade in return would be.... Damian Lillard and like another $5 million player....... or both CJ McCollum and Nurkic AND an additional ~$20 million worth of players.  Seems super likely, to get the services of Kevin Love and Andre Drummond.  /s  There is absolutely no one who is going to take both Drummond and Love off your hands at the same time.  That's a fantasy."
No I will not trade Jaylen Brown for James Harden.  No I will not consider Andre Drummond.  I get it. You guys are content with fighting for 4th in the East.
and you think Andre fucking Drummond of all ppl is going to move the needle for our team ?  Gtfoh nephew
Andre Drummond sucks at everything basketball involves besides rebounding
Andre drummond trade incoming
You'll get Andre Drummond and you'll hate it
"They’ll try to move Drummond for literally any asset but if they can’t, no skin, they traded a second rounder for him essentially and then they’ll move Javale to at least recoup that 2nd. Javale is easier to move atm because of his contract and it’s obvious he can still contribute. I wouldn’t be surprised to see both of them moved this season but I think Andre is harder to move atm because of the size of his contract."
"Larry Nance Jr, Kevin Love, Javale Mcgee, Jarrett Allen, Andre Drummond.    TALL BALL IS HERE MOTHERFUCKERS"
"That leaves the Cavs with Jarrett Allen, Javale McGee, Andre Drummond, Kevin Love, Thon Maker and Larry Nance.  Seems like a logjam."
"I never said Gobert can’t defend the perimeter. That was true maybe 3 years ago and he’s improved a lot since then. But Giannis is still significantly better on the perimeter and overall in a vacuum. But the point is that when Gobert gets switched onto a guard you don’t have to be worried he’ll get absolutely roasted like before.    The difference with Giannis is he can and will semi-regularly be put on guys like LeBron, Kawhi, PG etc. Gobert is never doing that and is largely incapable of all that. He also isn’t as good of an isolation defender as Giannis either. Giannis also carries a SIGNIFCANTLY heavier burden on the offensive side of the ball whereas Gobert gets lobs and putbacks so the fact that their even close and comparable says a lot for Giannis as well.  Also i’m not sure why your citing Raptor this early in the season since apparently Andre Drummond is a top 5 defender in the league according to them. Look at last year. Gobert is #1 but it’s a whole lot closer between him an Giannis"

Andre Drummond
"Yep. 3 first overall picks, former rebounding leader Andre Drummond on contract szn, and Caris Levert —front running trade piece for superstar James Harden.   Clearly the best group of guys."
Andre Drummond trying to secure that 2nd bag.
"Yea, there also aren't good defensive box scores people can use like they can for offense. On offense you can generally tell how good a game a player had by the TS%, points, assists, etc. If you look at stats like defensive rebounds, blocks, and steals, Andre Drummond looks like one of the best defenders in the league, but he's just mediocre. Since a lot of people rely on box scores, it paints a bad picture of how good a player is defensively."
Not to mention it's one of the most appropriate ones to abbreviate given how long it is and the unique abbreviation. Big difference compared to calling Andre Drummond AD or Raul Neto RN
I just don’t see how anyone could possibly think Andre Drummond is better than him

Idk Enes Kanter averaging a double double off the bench and Portland is right in the thick of it all so he my pick for 6MOTY   MIP I gotta say Christian Wood if he keep it up bc I’ve seen that kid make shots so far that i never expected n he putting up good numbers but I do believe Julius Randle is another contender if he too continues his stellar play as of late  MVP is tough but im leaning towards JOKIC . . . he got most triple doubles already and clearly best passing big man in the game...idk i just love big honey so much and he seem to be playing elite ball so i think he got a shot...  DPOY Andre Drummond perhaps? and I hope Myles Turner makes all defense team
It's also what happens when you're Andre Drummond and average nearly 4 turnovers
Andre Drummond is a floor raiser. Stop denying it.
Andre “Wilt Chamberlain” Drummond
"I’ve been wondering this about Aldridge, and from a stoned/ potentially forgetting something pov, he never stands out, like was never that “issue” that we had to deal with (lol sorry lakers perspective). Like Portland and San Antonio have had THOSE dudes. I just never really think of Aldridge in that way. Once again high, but thinking more Andre Drummond comp instead rn..."
Wood isn’t improved per say he’s playing the same way he did once the pistons dumped Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond in his mind
damn Andre Drummond is younger than I thought...
"&gt; Not sure why anyone thought Andre Drummond post-ups were a good idea.  I blame Stan Van Gundy for this. From the outside, it looks like SVG tried to make him be a classic post big, when that's not his strength at all"
Obsession is a tough thing to manage for those who feed off it.  I’d be dissapointed if the Chiefs won the Super Bowl again. Guess I hate them because I wish for parity.  I’d be dissapointed if Derrick Henry gets mvp. Guess I hate Derrick Henry.  I’d be dissapointed if Giannis wins DPOY given the performances so far. Guess I hate Giannis and not that I know Andre Drummond is balling.  What insecurities people with Lebron James flairs hold.

Can i interest you in one Andre Drummond?
Andre Drummond or Blake Griffin  Edit: This is assuming they're bought out and can be acquired for cheap
Might i interest you in one Andre Drummond? He comes equipped with a shiny Kevin Love.
I have a YouTube channel that I was fucking around with for a bit but wanna start making serious videos. My first attempt was the Andre Drummond video that was on the front page a few days ago.   [Here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmyANBfRcjHJBssGmjADY8w) it is.
This dude just called Andre Drummond a rim protector
"I'd pick serious rim protector and rebounder that's more reliable than DeAndre Jordan. (ahem... Andre Drummond)  Joe Harris is great, and is thriving over in Brooklyn with those guys. But all three of them can shoot. Joe Harris is just another shooter. They need some interior defense."
Andre drummond got votes last year for an all defense team i believe. Theres always a couple clown ass media members that have zero idea whats going on
"Westbrook, Andre Drummond bad, Curry, Jokic good.  Thanks for the awards"
"James Wiseman plays nothing like Andre Drummond in what i’ve seen, doesn’t Wiseman have a jumpshot?"
"I mean there was a time when Hassan Whiteside, DeAndre Jordan, and Andre Drummond were considered ""elite"" centers. Today's big men are definitely thriving compared to that."
"Same, as Celtics fans we just have to come to grips with the fact that we're wasting the Jays' prime years and we might as well ship one or both of them off for a guy like Andre Drummond and fully embrace the tank. Reload and try again in 2025."
Andre Drummond because he knows he's worth more.
"smh, washed.  andre drummond for curry who says no?"
I highly doubt that Andre Drummond is the answer to any of the Heat’s problems
Andre Drummond sucks.
andre drummond is good at filling holes
Andre Drummond
"No one will agree with you since this sub hates Andre Drummond more than Hitler, but hard to argue after watching the Heat make Oubre, Bazemore, and Wiggins look like Wilt Chamberlain in OT tonight."
Who has actually watched an Andre Drummond game and came away thinking we need Andre Drummond?
&gt;interior defense  Do you know who Andre Drummond is?
"This is reserved for Andre Drummond posters, but I'll allow it this time. This shit was downright NASTY"
"Some folks have the wherewithal to thrive in the post, many do not. Some would take to it like a fish in water. For others, it'd be like trying to turn Andre Drummond into a prolific 3-point shooter."
idk why but I feel like David Robinson would be better at being good at things than Andre Drummond. lol
"He literally didn't mention players leaving in free agency at all in the clip I watched. He was talking about how players get dragged for requesting trades. He said harden was castrated for what he did. I don't agree with that at all. I think Harden got off pretty light for how egregious his actions were (Dray completely ignored how Harden ignored COVID guidelines and didn't show up for camp) . By the way I'm a rockets fan and huge James Harden fan, but that doesn't mean I'm cool with that. I'm happy he's doing well in NY.   As a fan you are allowed to not like it when a player leaves or wants to leave. Dray thinks that somehow organizations and owners don't get criticism for what they do. I'll shit on Tillman Fertitta any day of the week, fuck that guy, and I think that sentiment is common among fans. Who TF you know likes James Dolan? What happened to Donald Sterling? Do you think a Cleveland fan likes Lebron or Dan Gilbert? Who won that PR battle? Jeanie Bus?      Also the whole premise is that he is HORRIFIED that Andre Drummond has to sit out a few games? What is so terrible about that? A team doesn't want to risk and injury before a trade, and he knows that he's on the trading block. That seems like a win-win. Dray simultaneously complained about players not knowing about a trade until it's a done deal, and then also about how Andre Drummond got a huge advanced warning of being traded and has to sit. What's up with that? Is he really worried that players are required to stay in shape? Like that's a problem because he missed 20 or 30 minutes of play time?     I think that there have been plenty of problems for players in the past, and I usually side with labor. Dray is being really dumb right now. I really don't understand how he has these impassioned morals in between kicking other players in the dick, especially when his take is so garbage."
"&gt; Cleveland Cavaliers center Andre Drummond did not practice with the team on Wednesday afternoon -- a previously unscheduled session that was labeled “spirited” and “competitive,” considered one of the best, most productive ones since training camp.  Yeah, this is the shit Draymond was talking about. No need to exaggerated this bullshit in any way. Theyre just tryna create drama. Labelled by who? Who?"
"I think draymond has a wack point. I’m all for player empowerment but ultimately these players and owners only care about one thing which is making sure basketball related revenue goes up and the salary cap keeps increasing. How is Andre Drummond being mistreated by getting traded? He’s not their center of the future and they don’t want to let him potentially get hurt. Makes sense to me. If players want less obligations to the media, to their fans, to their organizations, then they can negotiate that into the CBA. But the ultimate result would be less revenue. What happened to all these players being activists and caring about social issues? Why the fuck should anyone care if Andre Drummond is sad he got benched? He’s probably getting traded to a contender anyway"
"yeah but Andre realistically had no say in the matter, which is what i think the dude above you is saying.  Saying they came to an agreement isn't really saying anything and doesn't really say anything about whether Drummond is okay with it or not. They just have a mutual understanding of the situation, in the same way as when your boss tells you to do something, you just do it whether you like it or not. You understand the situation, the situation being you listen or you dont have a job anymore"
"Draymond spoke for a little over 2 minutes and not once did he ask for a rule change. What he’s asking for is that front offices across the league get their shit together. Danny Green went on JJ Redick’s podcast and praised the Lakers for how  they handled his trade this past offseason, and Quinn Cook had similar remarks about being waved by them. You misconstrued Draymond’s very first sentence, where he talks about seeing Andre Drummond begin his pre-game warmup then return from the locker room in street clothes because he had only just then been informed that he was being held out.   I think Draymond stumbled a bit when he brought up Harden because the heat Harden took was less about his trade request and more about the fact that the organization bent over backwards to put a winning team around him, shuffling in one all star after another and constructing the roster specifically around his offensive talents, all for him to say “we’re not good enough” when the reality is that he’s been underachieving. But even then, the fallout from his trade request was something Houston’s FO anticipated. The GM was quoted as having said “We’re prepared for things to get uncomfortable” and that’s what happened.   Draymond overall point is that there’s a right way to do these things, and when an organization fumbles away a player’s prime years-or even when they don’t and they just wanna trade that player for whatever reason there’s a way to go about it. When Harrison Barnes was traded mid game LeBron spoke up about it that very night on Twitter. There was no reason the team’s broadcasting crew should know before the player. Maybe you call that player before he leaves for the game and tell him he’s being held out because you’re close on a trade? Maybe you tell DeMarcus Cousins before he leaves town for AS Weekend and that you’re working towards trading him and hope to have something done by the weekend? There’s a right way to do this sort of thing and that’s what separates first class organizations from the rest of the pack. That’s what Draymond was talking about."
"He’s way bigger than Mitchell, probably a bit taller, and heavier than Wade.   He’s so strong all ready. He was moving Andre Drummond of all people around with ease."
Any time the possibility of Andre Drummond not getting traded and opting into his player option came up last year r/DetroitPistons was the saltiest mine on earth.
"Draymond should try being an NFL player. The NBA is the most player friendly league on the planet, and basketball stars can, and have, forced and coordinated trades if they weren't happy or wanted to team up. The team is gonna do what's best for the team, and the player is gonna do what's best for the player. Fans and media are going to take a side, and it may not be yours.   Drummond is sitting so he doesn't get injured, Harden got flack for saying that Houston didn't do enough when they brought in whoever he wanted or thought they needed and then HE didn't show up when it mattered, if you're a professional athlete you'd better damn well stay in shape if you want a job because if Andre Drummond ate himself to 350 and couldn't run the court he damn sure wouldn't have one, and the rest are whiny bullshit trying to nitpick so it makes the others sound better.  I want Draymond to be pit under NFL guidelines for players health and media relations, because he'd have been shit down and buried in fines as soon as he started talking."
"Sure, that's not a controversial statement. But in the context of this conversation you're implying its better that we focus on the wellbeing of drunk ass Tom Gores over Blake Griffin or Dan Gilbert over Andre Drummond.  The league isn't going anywhere, the only owner who ever sold his team who didn't want to or wasn't forced to by their finances was Donald Sterling and a dispute over players demanding a trade isn't bankrupting MLSE.  There's no reason to be on the ownership's side nearly ever."
"Andre Drummond is not Lebron, but he sure as hell gets paid close to him."

I'm sure they'd rather play jarett allen than andre drummond.
"You are exactly right. Is Andre Drummond still getting paid? Yeah, that’s what I thought. Lmao Draymond thinks having to sit on the bench and “act professional” is embarrassing for the player. So on brand for Dray to be extremely vocal and dead wrong. The guy has always had more decibels than brain cells."
"Andre Drummond once threw lunch meat and eggs at me. He missed, so this video makes sense."
Defensive win shares is not a useful stat. Andre Drummond is good proof of this
"Except Draymond is wrong and is making a skewed argument due to bias.  The players are employees being paid millions of dollars by their respective teams. The teams have a right to trade, sit, or play any player on their roster. In return, the players have to follow along while receiving a ludicrously large paycheck.  A team sitting Andre Drummond due to attempting to trade him is acceptable; they pay Andre’s salary and can utilize the utility he provides in any way they see fit. On the other hand, Harden was being paid millions of dollars and signed a contract—if his team wants him to play, he should play and be professional.  If Harden returned his salary to Houston, maybe I’d agree with his point."
"True, and it's how corporate masters keep workers in a subservient mentality. Some journalists and other people will do their dirty work by calling Draymond, Andre Drummond, James Harden, Kyrie ""entitled"" or mock them for taking a child's game seriously. For example, Stephen A. Smith a few weeks ago ranted that Kyrie should retire if he doesn't want to play (do what the corporation demands) every night. But this happens to highly skilled, gifted workers like them or regular, average, mediocre (but still nice people) like us. Like, how dare you not do what the corporation demands! It's how they keep power and they will send the Stephen A's of the world out there to make fans angry and direct their rage at the players not the failing yet financially thriving organizations."
"The thing about stats is....it can be empty depending on whether the offense is tailored around you and your skills or not.  The Knicks are simply choosing to embrace their gameplan around Beyblade, especially since he had made some improvements as a shooter and passer as his volume has increased.   It's like Orlando Magic choosing to play around Dwight pre 2010. Or Cleveland choosing to make Andre Drummond their featured star."
"I agree with you — Draymond acts like the NBA is a charity. The team pays Andre Drummond millions of dollars; if his value comes from being traded, then there is nothing wrong with holding Andre back from playing while still paying him millions of dollars.  If James Harden were paying the Rockets millions if dollars to play for them, I’d agree with Draymond’s point."
Hahahah too bad Andre Drummond fucking sucks ass
"Andre Drummond made $400,000 lmao  please shut up Draymond"
"I get Draymond’s point, I really do, but this stuff seems incredibly tone deaf to me. Not only are they professional ball players who get paid literally tens of millions in a country where just $100 more a week would keep millions of people out of poverty, but the NBA is one of, if not the most, player-centred league on the planet.   Guaranteed cash, buy-outs, trade demands, massive sponsorship deals and fame because of the smaller teams, little/no risk of CTE, moving to wherever the fuck you feel like in FA and having 30 teams wine and dine you if you’re a star, getting paid the max despite being an above average player because bottom feeders/contender aspirants are desperate to fill talent gaps. NBA players have it made. If you get traded you’re not getting sent to bumfuck nowhere, you’re getting traded from one major city to another.   If you wanna talk about labour rights for pro sports players, maybe talk about the end-of-the-bench NFL guys who are getting paid jack shit in non-guaranteed cash to get dementia when they’re in their 50s and will be put out on the streets never to touch the league again if they get a freak injury. If you wanna talk about labour rights in the NBA, maybe start with the coaching staff/FO below the head coach and POBO or maybe talk about the people who staff the arenas. Maybe talk about the two-way/min contract undrafted guys. Don’t talk about the stars.  It’s not like being traded or even sat as a star is the worst thing in the world. You enjoy the best medical care and fitness programs money can buy. So many of the highest paid professions ‘normal people’ can aspire to involve a ton of moving and unpredictability. As a doctor in training, I have no idea where the fuck my next training post is gonna be once my yearly contract is up and if I’m going to actually be forced to go get a job in an understaffed and underfunded rural hospital just to continue my specialty training. Andre Drummond made more sitting there last night than your average neurosurgeon earns in a year."
Andre Drummond is the second coming of Prime Shaqtin Javale McGee
"For real. I know I’m a homer on the Drummond part, but he’s given less effort basically since Allen arrived even though he kept starting (TBF I can understand why a little). Idk how what Dray is saying (which in the macro point is pretty true double standards wise) relates to at least Drummond when there’s a mutual agreement is just odd. Also feels weird since the end result is pro-player in keeping them healthy until they end up on a chance for a title as compared to sticking with a team that is basically doing a bad job at completely tanking right now. Pretty sure Andre and Blake don’t wanna get injured and not have a chance to compete for a title when that’s what’s being offered, but maybe I’m wrong. And it doesn’t feel like (at least from Cleveland’s side) that they’re being disrespectful to him."
"yeah uh Andre Drummond isn't Kawhi, or Serge, or Marc, or even Boucher really"
Sports teams have always done this with their players though in all major sports. Players have always been seen as chess pieces on a board it's not star players requesting trades causing execs to sit Andre Drummond while they look to trade him or trade a player and not inform him--teams have always done this.
"How is Andre Drummond being poorly treated? He is not being denied pay, he is not being forced to work against his will, and he is not being subjected to activities that will harm his or his family’s well being. Has anyone even asked if Drummond wants to play or is Draymond and everyone else just assuming the dude is dying to be on the court for a rebuilding team that he clearly doesn’t want to be on?"
"Andre Drummond made $350,000 to sit on the bench in street clothes tonight. There is absolutely ZERO REASON to feel sorry for him."
Draymond is right. But I don’t think Andre Drummond is gonna be too upset about getting traded from Cleveland lol.
"Nah, they're still paying him extremely well while trade talks are under way. There is no comparison between the two. Andre Drummond is currently asked to sit on the bench for hundreds of thousands of dollars per game. I don't have that big of a problem of what Harden did but Harden was putting in below minimum effort while still being paid a shit ton of money."
"Literally Dray’s point. The top 10-20 guys are part of the “player’s league” but guys like Boogie Cousins, Harrison Barnes, and Andre Drummond can get raw dogged by their teams because it’s allowed to happen."
"Flash backs to the Josh Smith, Andre Drummond, and Greg Monroe lineups."
In a blowout loss. The Andre Drummond of the West.
"On basektball reference, is there a way to see a players career stats against a certain team? Because i feel like julius randle and andre drummond turn into lebron and shaq whenever they play against the hawks"

Andre drummond uses the 2k21 user timing shot meter in the rec irl
"I just watched 6 minutes of Andre Drummond ""highlights"". Well done OP."
Who in their right mind would trade the 3 peat king for Andre Drummond
Don't tell me they traded Andre Drummond for a sigh of relief and a used In-N-Out gift card.
"""I'll ... be ... goooone ... in a day or ... twoooooooo""  This should have been Andre Drummond."
Calm down children.  Andre Drummond on the trade talk to Raptor right now.
"It's sad to see this thread being upvoted. A bunch of 14 year olds is what r/nba is full of.   Even if he is as bad as OP says, he dedicated his life to a sport and provides for his family and woke up a lot of times to practice and hard work himself to make to the NBA and has stayed there for a while now even if he is an under-achiever. A lot of guys can't even stay in the league.   This thread and the work OP put in to make his ""OC"" destroying someone's life work and career, it's sad and says more about this sub and OP than Andre Drummond himself.   PS: I'm not a fan of Drummond by any means. Just someone who played basketball at a high level and went Pro until my body wore down (plantar fasciitis and a bunch of other injuries) and it's depressing to see how fast life can come at you and how much haters you can have coming from people that don't even know you and the sacrifices you made and still do."
I had a Cavs fan friend get into a legitimate argument with me that Andre Drummond is better than Deandre Ayton. Drummond fucking sucks and looking at raw stats proves absolutely nothing.
Imagine the nightmare of having to deal with drummond and blakes deal this season. Stefanski and Pistons did well letting Andre go when they did. That space allowed for someone like Troy Weaver to take the gm position and to sign Jerami Grant
Andre Drummond + Darius Garland to Celtics for Kemba Walker + Tacko Fall + Celtics 2021 2nd rnd pick + 2022 2nd rnd pick
"Don’t the Lakers need to pick up a player after a buyout? (Blake Griffin or Andre Drummond, perhaps)? They have no salary to trade away, and few draft picks to trade. How do they trade for a quality player? Any quality player?"
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/cavaliersnation.com/2020/05/19/andre-drummond-says-he-used-punch-former-teammate-who-kept-coming-take-his-rebounds/amp/  That’s all there is in regards to what I referenced. Not Sekou, but a guard, and probably Reggie Jackson."
"... someone actually recorded this video and posted it? This is cringey as fuck.   Andre Drummond is a real person. I can't comprehend being that upset about a specific aspect of an athlete's game. Chill. No one died. Andre missed the basket. Hopefully he'll get it next time.  ""Andre Drummond may be the worst f\*\*\*in offensive player in the league."" Like the dude is an NBA caliber player who averaged 16 rpg, enough said. He doesn't deserve to be insulted like that as a man. Athlete worship run amuck."
"Andre Drummond trick y'all man, just running around doin nothing."
AD puts fans in seats and sells jerseys. Andre Drummond doesn't.
"Lmao you think that Andre Drummond is better than the rotation of TT, Theis, and Timelord?  Oh honey"
"Starters:  Jimmer  Rodney Mfin Stuckey  Kyle Singler  Anthony Bennett  Andre Drummond   Bench: DSJ or Frankie N, you choose.  MCW  Hollis Thompson  Omer Asik OR Donatas Motiejunas (hes underrated but he doesnt work for today's game.)  Alexis Ajinca or Anzejsc Pasceniks (cant spell his name for my life)  Add on Lebron's dad, Dahntay whatshisname and James Jones as bench warmers."
"The Raptors haven't really been a team to play through their bigs in the last couple years, so a benefit is that he would probably not get any possessions to do dumb shit. Also, if he pouts about it and doesn't play defense, Nurse will just bench his ass. The theoretical idea of Andre Drummond that just sets screens, rebounds, catches lobs, and plays defense would fill a need for the team, but I'm not really drinking the koolaid."
"Dwight was working hard because the Magic were legit title contenders during his prime. If he resigned with the Magic and they inevitably regressed to the mean, then Dwight would have gladly got fat eating candy and McDonalds and turned into Andre Drummond — a stat padding sloppy mess in the paint. We would have had 2016-2019 Dwight back in 2012/13."
The Trade Machine does not understand the unique reverse talent that is Andre Drummond.
"Here's a better way to compare it.        Andre Drummond takes 6.6 more FGA per game than Rudy Gobert to score an extra 3.5 PPG. That's extremely inefficient and if he decided to play Gobert's style of rim running, screening and catching lobs he'd be way better.  Instead he insists on getting these garbage post touches, tries to dribble into his drives and attempts 40% of his shots from outside 0-3 feet."
We need Andre Drummond in a Miami Heat uniform like yesterday please!!
Lol I think Andre Drummond was an all star.  Why you slandering his name like that ?
"If andre drummond takes 2 less shots per game than embiid i dont think he thinks of himself as a role player. Thats speaks how bad he is, a role player should never take as many shots as an mvp candidate."
"RemindMe! 2 years ""Andre Drummond sucks"""
Whichever team trades for Andre Drummond will not be winning the title lol.  Drummond will never be a winning player with his mentality
There's two things that r/nba posters agree on: Russell Westbrook and Andre Drummond are trash. Two things.
There's two kinds of people in this world: those who have had Andre Drummond play for their team and those who haven't.
That's reigning DPOY 1st place vote-getter and All-NBA defensive team 2 vote getter Andre Drummond to you
"I’d rather have a Tom Collins than Drummond, it doesn’t even have to be made well. Please someone just take Andre"
there's no fucking way you guys are actually implying baynes is a better player than Andre Drummond lol
&gt; Andre Drummond averaging 17/16 on 53%  ironic lol
My favorite Andre Drummond moment came earlier this year when he chewed out one of his guards for rebounding the ball instead of letting him have it.
"Okay, I'm perfectly aware that Andre Drummond isn't gonna make the Nets the best rebounding team in the league overnight, but my question is this: Wouldn't he at least help? I mean, what else is a bad rebounding team supposed to do? Give up?  And I disagree that rebounding is part of defense. When you get a rebound, yes you are preventing a shot opportunity from the opponent but you are also giving your own team an opportunity on offense. Therefore, since the effects of rebounding are not exclusive to defense, defense and rebounding are separate entities"
"I own 2 NBA jerseys as a Pistons fan.  One is Andre Drummond, the other is Blake Griffin."
"As a Sixers fan, I don't want the Celtics or Raptors to improve at the center position, but I also don't want to see either team waste assets on Andre Drummond...."
"This will sound laughable, but I swear there was this moment in time around 2015 and 2016 where Stan Van Gundy's system was kind of humming in Detroit. It was the ""Form a Wall"" era, and Brandon Jennings, D.J. Augustin, and Reggie Jackson all had their own moments where they looked like point gods.   In the 15 games prior to blowing out his Achilles, Brandon Jennings was averaging 20 and 7 (including a 24-point, 21-assist performance). Then D.J. Augustin slipped into the lineup and averaged 20 and 8 until he was dealt for Reggie Jackson. Then Jackson came out and played like a borderline all-star in 2016.   During that time, you'd catch a lot of moments where you could see what Drummond could be, when he was just dining on alley-oop setups from Jennings, Augustin, and Jackson (aka, the DeAndre Jordan approach). Then again, he was still making bonehead mistakes, still playing outside himself, and as a capper, he was shooting 35 percent from the line.  His Pistons career largely consisted of easing him along, getting him reps as a means of developing and broadening his game, then finally you had Drummond deciding he was going to be whatever he wanted to be (aka 3-point shooting, playmaking Andre). He's a DeAndre who wants to be more than DeAndre."
Single handedly winning 41 games with Andre Drummond averaging 17/16 on 53% and being an all-star.
I’m starting to think maybe the guy speaking in the video doesn’t like Andre Drummond.
ANDRE DRUMMOND FANTASY OWNERS ^lie ^down ^gently...
"I’ll take one Andre Drummond, please"
KJ McDaniels fouled Andre Drummond 5 times in 9 seconds.  Not sure when he actually fouled out tho.  [video](https://youtu.be/crXq8RBCs3U)
Cody Zeller is not better than Nerlens Noel LMAO I cannot believe you actually think that  Have fun overpaying for Andre Drummond or Daniel Theis or some shit
Andre Drummond
"On the offensive end, some of it is humility. Nobody can really be Rudy on the defensive end because they don’t have his combination of length, acceleration and IQ. But there’s nothing stopping Andre Drummond from setting a million screens and rolling to the basket. It’s actually pretty phenomenal that Rudy spends so much effort setting screens on a 205 million contract. For a guy at his level is rare to see the willingness to do all the little things typically asked of role players. There’s really no reason AD shouldn’t have as many dunks out of the screen and roll as Rudy but Davis just doesn’t set near as many screens. That could be a coaching issue though."
"That and some rebounding! Andre Drummond would be a perfect fit, but I know it's a long shot that he'll get bought out at all, let alone sign with us."
Andre Drummond
i heard this andre drummond guy is good at rebounding. Maybe the nets should get him lol.
"Andre Drummond, even with the height advantage, is only a 50 TS% player this year. Trez is 6th in the league at 66 TS%. There is a *huge* difference between Trez's effectiveness on offense and Andre fucking Drummond."
That's Andre Drummond
Damn Jones. WORTH EVERY PENNY! Might not even need Andre Drummond
Zeke  Joe Dumars   Grant Hill  Dennis Rodman  Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond
"Pistons fans are fucking stupid when it comes to Blake. We were garbage for 10 years, trying to build around Reggie Jackson and Andre Drummond and then traded for Blake and they act like he broke the franchise.  If anybody’s mad that he starts dunking with that prime real estate that big 3 will give him I won’t be surprised."
"He's a decent rim protector when in position and a good rebounder.  Other than that :  \- he can't move  \- can't come out the paint  \- can't guard the post  \- is a mediocre screener  \- can't pass to save his life  \- never plays with effort  \- has lost a lot of athletism  &amp;#x200B;  He might be the worst ""good stats not good player"" in the league I've ever seen, and that""s coming from someone who's had to watch a looooot of Andre Drummond and Greg Monroe in my life"
"&gt;Celtics trade for: Chris Boucher   &gt;   &gt;Raptors get: Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, 2 FRP in 2022 and 2024  What the fuck? 2 lottery picks + 2 FRP'S?  Boucher is great, but for that price tag? Hell no.  &gt;DEAL 2:   &gt;   &gt;Celtics trade for: Lonzo Ball and Wily Hernangomez   &gt;   &gt;Pelicans get: Marcus Smart and Payton Pritchard  Lonzo Ball has been shooting lights out, but he's not a better defender than Smart (heart and soul of our team too,) and why the fuck are we losing all of our guard depth? I'd rather keep Smart + PP over Lonzo Ball.  Ball is gonna get paid + RFA. We could lose him.   DEAL 3:  &gt;Celtics trade for: PJ Tucker   &gt;   &gt;Rockets get: Tristan Thompson and 2022 2nd Rd. Pick   &gt;   &gt;Use Exception to SIGN **Andre Drummond** \[offer him guaranteed big role\] and cut Theis/Wily  You're fucking high."
"Hello the Brooklyn Nets, please do not acquire Andre Drummond. Thank you."
"Clearly you didn’t watch the game. Draymond played incredible defense just like he does every single game. He didn’t have any blocks, but he had several contests at the rim that forced difficult misses. Additionally, he was extremely active on the perimeter, switching onto guards and getting steals. If you think Andre Drummond can replicate Draymond’s defensive and even offensive impact, you are out of your mind."
"No blocks for this scrub, so called defensive leader, Draymond Green. Give me Andre Drummond all day!"
"I don't think it's fair to expect anyone to have a career like KD has had. It's very rare.  I think Oden would have a similar career to Dwight Howard, with maybe a little more longevity. He was a physical big man who would have been nasty on a potentially scary Blazers team. But the league evolved away from his type of play and he wouldn't have had the longevity. At this point, he would probably be like an older Andre Drummond."
I mean would andre Drummond not dominate that era? How many guys matched him physically?
"I once saw a take that said if u took away the accolades of bill Russell, Andre Drummond is the better player"
Andre Drummond
"Effing Andre Drummond, apparently"
Probably andre drummond
I would trade zach Lavine for andre drummond
Andre Drummond is one of the best rebounders ever and he hasn't belonged in the NBA for years now. Rebounding is the most useless stat in the modern NBA.
My starting 5 would be: PG: Luka ($1 billion) SG: Hardaway Jr. ($20m) F: Gallinari ($20m) F: Josh Hart ($20m) C: Andre Drummond ($30m)  I like this unlimited cap space idea I’m definitely winning a chip with that lineup
"Sweet, now on my fantasy team the only guys I have hurt/not playing are: Embiid, Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, Malik Beasley, DeAndre Hunter, Mitchell Robinson and David Bertans."
Andre “do a 180” Drummond
"I just searched ""Andre Drummond"" on Google and the top story is ""Can Nets outbid Lakers for Andre Drummond?""  I mean...come the fuck on. If the Nets get Drummond we might as well just wrap this shit up right now."
Buddy hield is older than Andre Drummond  Always surprises me
"On the margins, healthy this team can go at anyone. An athletic big &amp; a reliable shooter would be nice, but its not the end of the world if we end up with Damian Jones &amp; Kyle Korver instead of Andre Drummond &amp; Otto Porter."
Have u ever watch Andre Drummond ?
"How cute. Hassan Whiteside and Andre Drummond ring any bells?  Don't try to be a bigger moron than you are my dude, it's over 😂"
"Nets with a Literal Big 3 of Andre Drummond, Blake Griffin, and PJ Tucker. Maybe even DeMarcus Cousins.     On top of the original Big 3 of Durant, Harden and Kyrie. And that's doing the glue guy Joe Harris dirty."
Kevin Durant   James Harden   Kyrie Irving   Blake Griffin   PJ Tucker   LaMarcus Aldridge   Andre Drummond   DeMarcus Cousins   DeAndre Jordan   Joe Harris   Jeff Green   Landry Shamet   Bruce Brown   Iman Shumpert   Nicolas Claxton   Tyler Johnson
PG: Jrue Holiday/Kyle Lowry   SG: FVV/Duncan Robinson/Derrick White   SF: Joe Harris/Kyle Kuzma   PF:  Kevin Love/Blake Griffin   C: DeAndre Jordan/Andre Drummond/JaVale McGree  Is this the worst possible team you could assemble out of that finalists?     Edit. I am not sure about Point Guards
bruh andre drummond and mcgee got invited
"You can see in comments to others I don't think the Cavs are at fault.  Drummond has sucked this year (despite stats) and they have better players.  It's also true that he believes he is good, valuable, loves basketball, misses being an important player and probably isn't feeling so great right now.  At no point have I said ""EVERYONE SAVE ALL YOUR FEELS FOR POOR ANDRE!!"".  All i've pointed out is that it's complicated and he probably feels really shitty and on a human level and I appreciate his bad feelings.  Hopefully he uses them as motivation to improve.        I think it's shitty to not consider Drummond is having a rough time simply because he's got a lot of money.  That's shallow and precisely what players complain about when discussing fan reactions.  You can be rich, happy, uncomfortable, disappointed, underperforming at work, confused and worried about the future all at the same time.  Being rich doesn't cancel all negative emotions."
"That's because Andre Drummond isn't even in the same universe of players as AD. It's not just about benching a healthy player (no one's going to bat an eye if a team benches a healthy Mike Muscala), the caliber of the player obviously has to be considered. Cavs are probably better off not playing Drummond, but the Pels benching an all-NBA player in AD would be akin to blatant tanking. That being said, the AD situation was mostly him being an unprofessional child."
Andre Drummond
That's because AD is a star player who fans pay to see.  So benching him while he's healthy is bad for the fan experience.  Nobody is tuning in to a Cavs game to see Andre Drummond play.  It's a pretty different scenario because of that.
"So, does this mean the Mavs **won't** be dumping KP for Andre Drummond and a 2nd round pick before the deadline?"
Yeah but our subreddit thinks he should be traded for Andre Drummond and pocket lint so?
"Wait, who are you talking about? The guy we would be lucky to trade andre Drummond for?"
"Yes, please take Andre Drummond"
"DJ has been wildly bad for us most of the season. He’s recently been better, but Andre is a better fit. Also Drummond would not be here to “stop” embiid”. He’d come to help us with rebounding, as that is a issue with us. He also jumps and attempts to play defense.   Deandre isn’t jumping for anything except lobs these days"
Finally someone who gets it. Here soon you’ll catch me on the sidelines live on TNT analyzing the true value of Andre Drummond to a championship roster. I’ll never forget my r/nba roots tho 😤
Andre Drummond no longer considered washed
"This trade doesn't work, Mavs dont have enough cap space to swallow 3 albatross contracts (Love $31m, Drummond $29m &amp; Oladipo $21m)  They only gave up $29.5m in KP, $19m in THJ &amp; $11m in Powell. Bey &amp; Terry are on miniscule rookie deals  Also if Mavericks actually want to win, Andre Drummond is really not the guy they want to have."
Andre Drummond? Otto porter?
Some of these voters are no better than the average stat obsessed nephew  Even last year Nets beat writer Greg Logan voted Andre Drummond for DPOY
Andre Drummond is one of the greatest rebounders of all time and he barely belongs in the league

Andre Drummond runs california
Great team when they are fully healthy and Andre Drummond will be a great addition to an already great team.
Why is Jokic missing and tipping like he's Andre Drummond out there
I’d be willing to bet Andre Drummond will look really good on the Lakers.
Andre Drummond needs to watch this.
"Cavs would be mega dumb to first give a depleted Kevin Love a max in 2018, then to trade for max contract Andre Drummond as a lottery team, then finally to buy both of them out."
"Andre ""can guard 1-5"" Drummond and LaMarcus ""defensive IQ"" Aldridge for first team all Defense."
"I respect Dame for his approach to his career  I also respect others for their approach to their careers, excluding Latrell Spreewell, as i have no issue with a person doing what is in their own best interest personally or from a career standpoint  For every Dame, there is a Lue Wiliams, Lamar Odom, Blake Griffin, Norman Powell, Isaiah Thomas, Andrew Wiggins, D'Angelo Russell, even Andre Drummond was bench to avoid hurting his value, and so on.   Loyalty is great but for most guys it's definitely a one-way street. Once Dame's game slows down the real question will be if he ends up the trading block for his replacement.   If a player wants to put themselves in the best position to achieve a dream they've been chasing since they were kids, I'm all for it."
Andre Drummond? Remains to be seen. But his salary is 29 mill this year and the lakers got him for pennies. By all accounts a player of this magnitude should be able to be with a team that is maxed out on cap. But here we are.   Enes kanter helped a Portland team to reach the conf finals.
"Why do bad free throw shooters always take so long at the line? I remember hearing similar criticisms for Dwight Howard, Andre Drummond, Russ, and even LeBron"
Lakers were desperate just to get Andre Drummond or even Dieng on the buyout market. There is no way they’d let go of Gasol unless somehow they could get a better replacement. Don’t know why Gasol would want out either if the whole point of him leaving Toronto was to win a ring.
"Previous tweet:  &gt;[B/R reports the #Hornets primarily targeted Myles Turner, Andre Drummond, Montrezl Harrell, and Richaun Holmes before the trade deadline.](https://twitter.com/SwarmnSting/status/1376933083899826183?s=20)"
Probably doesn’t want to be benched behind Andre Drummond  There’s only so many minutes at the 5 to be had between Drummond and Harrell
Yikes Andre Drummond won't be the least self aware player on the Lakers apparently
lol why is this an issue now. And BG and Griffin doesn’t compare to a prime Andre Drummond
I find it hilarious how the nets add a 35 y/o LMA and a way past his prime BG and act like it’s unfair but seem to be completely quiet when Lebron and the lakers add   Anthony Davis  Marc Gasol  Dennis Schroeder  Montrezl Harrell  Andre Drummond
Are you implying Andre Drummond isn't one of the most valuable pieces in the NBA right now?
Are you Andre Drummond?
"He was really fun to watch in lob city ngl but after that his game went downhill. He might be ""washed"" but would still be a key player in BKN's playoff run. Andre Drummond is in way better condition imo but nobody talks about building a super team if it's lebron's team."
"He’s saying he sees a lot victims that he could embarrass on Twitter (smelling blood in the water) and he’s gonna definitely going to show up and enjoy roasting people like everyone thought he would when they acquired LMA and Blake (here to fulfill the prophecy)  What’s fascinating is how 2 players that average roughly 4-5 boards, 12-13 points, signed for the bare minimum pay, and will come off the bench are causing more of a ruckus than Andre Drummond who avgs 17.5 pts and 13.5 boards signing to the Lakers. Btw, he’ll be starting"
"Like i said there is a big difference between being worth 30 million and being worth the minimum, it's like you can't read. No person capable of averaging 14 rebounds a game in an NBA game should make the minimum, it completely stupid. Andre Drummond the two time all star an all nba player is currently making about half what Stanley Johnson is at 27, and you don't fucking know who Stanley Johnson is.   And yes unlike you biased ass i'm capable of recognizing when something is bad for the league. Having the championship affected by guys signing in march while essentially not counting against the cap, because someone else is paying their salary is a horrible fucking look."
"Yes, for sure, Andre Drummond, LaMarcus Aldridge, Blake Griffin, Jeff Teague, all equally good. You definitely get it."
"As someone whose lived through the Rodman, Wallace, and Drummond eras of rebounding in Detroit, I'd post Andre pretty definitively behind those other two on that front, whether the stats support it or not.   Watching Andre board often feels like watching a giant alone in an empty sea, clearing the uncontested defensive glass all night, then re-tipping his own point-blank misses at the other end. It makes me wonder what his numbers would look like in an era where eight or nine players aren't all chilling along the perimeter every possession (i.e. any modern era but this one); or an era where four bigs were grinding along the blocks rather than a single stretch 5. He doesn't seem to have the pursuit, hustle, and grit of those other two - the will to go snatch a board rather than snag one nearby.  At times it was maddening to watch, because you learned that even if he played an awful game, someone was going to look at his box score full of 15 defensive rebounds against a team not crashing the glass and would conclude that he was a game-changing contributor that night."
"I still can’t believe the Pistons at one point had a Josh Smith, Andre Drummond and Greg Monroe front court"
"Haha this part reminded me, does anyone else remember that incredible post ""every player in the NBA is either a poor man's or a rich man's andre drummond"", with an entire paragraph inside trying to explain his point  Top tier shitpost from a few years back"
"Have you ever seen Andre Drummond play or do you just jerk off to box scores? Terrible team player, selfish af, inefficient, bad defender. He could be useful as an offensive rebound machine if hes willing to realize he is a 5th-6th option but thats not likely. In reality he will take touches from his actually great teammates and the clippers or nuggets will end up in the finals."
nobody is overrating andre drummond.  everyone knows that he can get some good rebounds and occasionally be in the way when someone tries to get close to the hoop.  that's basically it
"I think Drummond has a very good chance of working out in Los Angeles but he was often a net negative in Cleveland and Detroit because he couldn't stop shooting himself in the foot. He was at his best when he just stuck to rebounding, dunking lobs, and caring enough to rotate on defense on a consistent basis. But he couldn't stick to doing just that for long. The extra stuff always crept back in.   Instead, he spent a lot of time nullifying his good play with 3-point attempts, iso-crossovers, floaters, silly fouls, forced passes, and poor free throw shooting. There were a number of times where the Pistons were better off with a worse rebounder out there who at least knew his own limits.   But again, one would have to believe that if anyone could get Andre to cut out that garbage, it'd be LeBron. I have a difficult time imagining the Lakers seeing Andre pull for three on a regular basis and just letting it go. I mean, Andre's teammates in Cleveland weren't pumped about it either, but LeBron seems like he actually has the gravitas to do something about it."
"Andre Drummond will do anything to get rebounds, even miss his own putbacks if he has to."
You think Andre Drummond planned all this? lol
"Andre Drummond was never, ever a No. 1 option in Detroit. He just constantly played outside of himself. He was a DeAndre Jordan type who never knew he was a DeAndre Jordan type.   That said, I don't think LeBron and Anthony will put up with Andre trying to pull that garbage in L.A. He'll either get it right or he's going to sit."
"While I get that people are annoyed because the buyout market was super impactful this season.... but in reality? How often is it that the buyout market has players that even as good as a washed up Blake Griffin, LMA, and Andre Brick20shotsattheRim Drummond.   Most years the best player you're going to get on the buyout market is Joakim Noah who hasn't played in a year and a half."
You really think no one would sign Andre Drummond to more than a 5 mill deal? You’re nuts
Ah yes because the Lakers were the only ones who were willing to take Andre Drummond for $700k...
Nuggets/Lakers is going to bring us the battle we've all been waiting for: Javale McGee vs. Andre Drummond
"I mean they aren't *at that level* but find me an NBA player on a 1yr/1m contract that you'd rather have than Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge or Andre Drummond."
blake and LMA aren't going to matter come playoff time people are acting dumb about this..they are both defensive liabilities....the nets would gladly prefer andre drummond over both those pieces
"Andre Drummond, ladies and gentlemen"
Let’s do it. The Cavs should get the first overall pick for free because they lost noted allstar and double double machine Andre Drummond.
"I think he means Andre Drummond, lol."
"and completely healthy, 27yo Andre Drummond?"
I’ve watched most of Andre Drummond’s NBA games.  You guys are wrong. Healthy Lebron/AD/Drummond is going to coast through the Western Conference.
"If he embraces his role like Dwight did last year, then he could be a high level role player which help would the Lakers in the playoffs  If he still acts like he's still in a Cleveland, then he'll be Andre Drummond which won't help the Lakers that much and could potentially hurt the team"
"The only reason buyouts are a thing is because teams overpay certain players who then fall out of favor. Andre Drummond would be on the Cavs still if his salary was commensurate with the production he brought to the team. Front offices shouldn’t hand out dumb contracts. Additionally, I thought everyone was all about player empowerment now, and that many NBA fans follow players more than teams. Given that attitude shouldn’t we be encouraging more buyouts rather than less?"
"I'm not saying I have any answers but they need to tighten up who can get bought out. Sure, Andre Drummond is vastly overpaid but he's a 27 year old averaging 17.5 PPG and 13.5 RPG. Why the fuck can a contender add him for absolutely nothing?"
Andre Drummond
andre drummond is singlehandedly a more important signing for the lakers than blake+LMA
"Here’s another, a bought out player cannot play for another team that season. Players CAN agree to take a paycut to move. We just saw the single most egregious “buy-out season” in NBA history with teams not even entertaining the idea of trading for all-star caliber players like Blake and Andre Drummond in hopes of getting them for free. Make no mistake, this is what the league wants so it can consolidate talent onto teams in its most marketable cities (New York, LA, Miami, San Fran) to maximize profits. Silver needs to go but I fear the league is too far gone"
Andre Drummond is absolutely not one of the worst players in the league lmao he was just overpaid.
Just because it's big names and the bar for them to contribute well is super low. The Superteam chatter really was at the Harden trade and these signings are just annoying to hear because it makes it sound like the Nets have infinite roster spots to sign talented veterans and no other team got as big of a name before Andre Drummond
Yeah but who on Earth was going to trade for Andre Drummond at $30million? It’s Cleveland’s fault for saddling themselves with that awful contract and now we’re supposed to feel bad for them that it backfired?
Can't believe a team could add an incredibly useful player like Andre Drummond for nothing. He definitely hasn't been one of the worst players in the league for a few years now or anything. Small market teams would've been lining up to pay someone like Andre Drummond.
We got another AD. Andre Drummond baby! Now we need the other AD to play lol.
Blake griffin and andre drummond really about to go play in the nba finals
"Andre Drummond made the all star in 2008.  And here you go, buddy.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/417758-los-angeles-lakers-still-super-team-to-beat"
Andre Drummond
"Superteam has always meant a superteam and 2 other all stars. You're attempting to change the definition because you're a LeBron hater, clown.   6MOTY is a borderline meaningless award for volume scorers off the bench. Jamal Crawford won the shit over Iguodala when he wasn't half the player. Schroder and Harrell aren't borderline all stars or anything, they're flawed volume scorers who aren't elite contributors to a championship team. The fact that you consider Andre Drummond an all star level player tells me you don't have a single clue what you're talking about."
"&gt;Ballers, I put numbers on the board      ""-Pusha T""  - Andre Drummond."
"Once upon a time I watched Andre Drummond shoot 36 times from the charity stripe.   In general any game with lots of turnovers, bricked shots, fouls and free throws. I hate watching a game stop every 15 seconds for FTs. It's a similar feeling to frame rate drop while gaming."
At least this post isn't about Andre Drummond
Buddy Hield being older than Andre Drummond will always be weird to me
Have you ever watched Andre Drummond play???? He’s the epitome of empty stats that don’t lead to winning
"But their missing Andre Drummond, aka Big Daddy, aka the hairy shoulder g.o.a.t"
Andre Drummond
"How are the Lakers in any way a superteam. Because they got Mr. 50% on layups as a center and turns the ball over more than Harden, Andre Drummond?"
Just like that Andre Drummond has gained a lot of new fans
"On paper, the nets are significantly better. Three guys that if they were on their own team playing how they are would be on the MVP list somewhere, and they are all in their prime. The difference (between lakers if they faced) could potentially be a 36 year old LBJ coming off an injury. If nets lose, its one of, if not the greatest disappointment season of all time. Thats why people arent up in arms about andre freakin drummond lo."
"This is literally just statistical analysis. I don’t know why my flair matters to this. I’ve been off of the Drummond train this whole season even joking in the Drummond signing thread that I “guess I don’t need to delete those old comments.”   For the record, Ainge got a 60% true shooting wing scorer who’s switchable on defense. You guys got Andre Drummond, one of the worse centers in the league.  Please, if you want to reply to me use a statistically backed argument rather than just calling out my flair and saying I’m bullshitting."
Andre Drummond is atrocious on offense and average on defense.
You guys sound exactly like last year. Just replace Andre Drummond. Don’t need to shoot 3’s at the best clip when we got clamps and can get to the rim any time 🤫
Dude is a black hole on offense.  Nobody is scared of Andre Drummond especially on this team that can’t hit a jump shot to save their lives.
"I don't think even Andre Drummond is delusional enough to think he's getting post-ups and shit on a team with Lebron and AD. Assuming he manages to actually catch Lebron's passes, he should be a good rim running big for them, certainly an upgrade over nothing."
only casuals think andre drummond or lamarcus aldridge are even good lol. drummond is the definition of empty stats
"R/NBA: Andre drummond is trash and one of the most overrated players in the league.  Also R/NBA: The lakers signed drummond? I hate the state of the nba, this season is ruined"
"&gt;They are still a significant upgrade that they got for no cap space hit.  No, they aren’t. LMA and Blake are unplayable in any high level playoff series.   The Lakers won the championship and added Trez, &gt;Because they actually spent cap space on it rather than getting it for free off the buyout market. Trezz and Schro alone are getting a combined 25m. How much are LMA and Blake getting from the Nets?  Lol is that really the argument you’re gonna make to justify what the Lakers did? Cmon man you’re better than that (I think)  Drummond was a buy out guy, and he’s better than either LMA or Blake...easily.   &gt;If those guys are washed, Gasol is next level washed. He can barely run the floor.  I’m not sure what your point is, they’re all washed. That’s why crying about it is hilarious.    &gt;Also, I think the Drummond deal is bullshit too. You shouldn't be able to add a player who is getting paid big by another team for pennies on the dollar without any cap hit 70% of the way through the season.  Blame the teams that bought them out, not the teams that signed them. Actually good players that aren’t semi washed up usually *never* get bought out by a team. Blake got bought out because he’s trash, LMA got bought out because he’s trash, Drummond got bought out because he’s trash. All 3 of these guys will not be playable in any high level playoff series. Pretending like this isn’t true is just sad.   &gt;So the only way someone could be opposed to the buyout market shenanigans is if they are a biased Lakers fan? Okay dude.  Yes, only someone who’s biased or has mental deficiencies actually thinks Blake or LMA will have an impact on the Nets.   Notice how the world was burning down yesterday when the Nets got 36 year old LMA. But, when the Lakers signed prime Andre Drummond nobody cares."
If signing Andre Drummond is the right way to win a championship then I will admit I seriously need to readjust my thinking after the season’s end.
woulda been hilarious if it was;  [Stein] The Nets announce that they have signed free agent centre Andre Drummond
"In comparison to other buyouts with his contract and just his contract in general, it is barely anything.  Andre Drummond's contract this year was for $28,751,775. Over a 72-game season, that is $399,330 per game. Given that there are 28 games remaining after the trade for the Cavaliers, they agreed to pay him for 26 of those remaining 28 games, or 92.9% of his salary. In the long-term of things, they paid him $10,382,580 to walk away while he gave back $794,534.  The other example coming up is Blake Griffin. Now Blake is a slightly different case as he had 2-years left, but he had Detroit on the books for over $62mm between this season and next. This year's contract of $32,455,565 for the 72 game-season clocks in at 450,771 per game. The agreement that BG came to was to give back $13.3mm back to the Pistons to get out of his contract -- this is the total given back between the $16,227,756 still owed this year and the $29,764,126 owed next year; or 28.9% of the $45,990,882 still owed overall. He's essentially giving back a quarter of the next two seasons as compared to Drummond giving back 1/14th of this season.  Honestly, I think the NBA is going to be hard-pressed to find a solution for this. The NBPA will clearly be trying to keep it as-is to protect the players, but the Drummond buyout of sacrificing $0 to leave a rebuilding team with nothing but a veteran-minimum contract amount back to join a stacked contender for next-to-nothing is not a good look for the NBA or Small Market Teams."
"&gt; He chose 50 because of his dunk contest scores, and the fact that he didn't win. He has a documentary called ""Mr. 50""  I don't know why but this gives me the same vibes as when Andre Drummond made a series about his rap career that basically just showed no one going to his shows"
You seriously think Andre Drummond is gonna have mvp level impact 😐
lmao all of sudden r/nba rates Andre Drummond
Andre drummond is not the same man. Dude is not that good no more
"And that’s a fuck no it’s Andre Drummond , he is not a star"
Waiting for the Andre Drummond death threats to start
You haven’t lived until you have seen prime time Cavs game with point guard Andre Drummond taking the ball up and trying to iso his way to a mid range hook or a disaster looking three. Then when he went to the bench Point McGee was ready to take his place.   It was a wild time
We are talking about Andre Drummond here. Get a grip.
"“only two teams contending”   ahh yes, i remember the hugely competitive 80s, when the Lakers and Celtics combined for 13 finals appearances in the decade.  or the 90s, when the Bulls won 6 titles  or the 00s, then the Lakers and Spurs combined to make it out of the West,  9 of the 10 years.  the league has never been “balanced”. it’s always been extremely top heavy.  a year ago the expected Finals was a Clippers vs Milwaukee matchup, but now Andre Drummond who this sub shits on consistently and acts like barely belongs in the NBA is flipping the scales that much?"
Over Andre Drummond? 😂
*Andre Drummond signs*  “ NUMBER 18 HERE WE COME”
Bruh it's Andre Drummond they signed not James Harden.
"the reaction to andre drummond signing, who this sub acts like is a fringe nba player is worse than the lma signing yesterday. wild"
"If you're sayin Dennis Schroder or Andre Drummond fulfill the definition of a super team, you're kind of scratching the bottom of the barrel. Those two have combined for one All Star, and that was a reserve pick when John Wall got injured."
"That’s the Andre Drummond experience for you, but everyone sees 17/13 and thinks he’s a great player"
"AD is AD, Andre Drummond is just Andre Drummond"
"Why do people think this is an Ainge leak?  It's a story that details Drummond's FA process and his mindset. That's clearly a story from Drummond's camp...  &gt; The Los Angeles Lakers have agreed to sign two-time All-Star center Andre Drummond for the rest of the season once he clears waivers, a league source has confirmed to the The Athletic. ESPN first reported the agreement on Sunday.  &gt; Drummond spent Friday and Saturday meeting with the Lakers, Celtics, Knicks, Clippers and Hornets and was strongly considering the Celtics before ultimately deciding to join the Lakers Saturday evening, sources tell The Athletic.   Which is more likely:  * Danny Ainge scrambled to get in contact with the Athletic to brag and let them know how close he got so his team could feature in their Andre Drummond report that also included information from other teams  * The Athletic reached out to Drummond's camp/agent and asked about his decision and in the process, they said they picked LA but Boston was the other team in consideration  Just because a report includes the Celtics in it, doesn't mean the report has come from the Celtics. I swear, 90% of the ""lol Danny Ainge leaks"" are just people not knowing how to read news reports.  I swear people would read this report from Chris Paul's 2017 FA decision and assume it was another Danny Ainge leak to show how 'close' he got:  &gt;**Kelly Iko:** San Antonio, Houston, and Boston were Chris Paul’s biggest choices heading into free agency, before ultimately choosing the #Rockets.  Then you realise Kelly was literally just quoting Chris Paul in the mini-documentary he did about his FA decision.   ***  Also, did Pat Riley leak that LMA chose Brooklyn over Miami because Brooklyn had a higher chance of making the finals?"
Andre Drummond is nowhere near an all star anymore lol you must be slow if you really believe that. Nets have 2 top 5 players plus Kyrie Irving. Foh
...................Andre Drummond.....................Two times...........  And you have 2 of the top 5 players in the league so....💀
Are we talking about the same Andre Drummond
"Very much? Bro if on that team of all the people Andre fucking Drummond gets isos drawn up for him Lakers ain’t lookin to win. He should fill Howard’s role. Energy guy off the bench, rebounding and fouling hard."
"Sure, but at least we use W/L's for starting pitchers. Of all the times to bring it up for a basketball player, it's for Andre Drummond? Lol"
Wes Unseld probably. Sub 50% shooting on 13 points and 18 rebounds is Andre Drummond numbers.  Also 2015 Curry from a sheer box score perspective only put up 24 and 8. Rose also put up 25 and 8 on subpar efficiency box score wise. Both are MVP worthy but box score wise they don't like it.
"Yeah I do. Almost anyone with real knowledge of the situation, like Shaq and Steve Kerr will tell you that the reason low post offense has disappeared is because big men don't practice it. Andre Drummond is a great example. We get reports about him working on his three pointer. That's idiotic. He can't even shoot free throws. But, instead of working on boring things like footwork and jumphooks, he practices the flashy skill."
"&gt; Andre Drummond is considered a historic level rebounder even though there are like 5 seasons in his career his teams have rebounded better when he's not on the court.  Using BB-Ref's on/off stats, Drummond's teams have had a better TRB% with him on the court than when he's off the court every season except 2017."

Andre Drummond is a dirty player.
Did Andre Drummond get traded to the Mavs at half?
I’d pay to see an Andre Drummond / Jeannette mccurdy sex tape
Drummond is clearly better than Andre
imagine face guarding Andre Drummond on the perimeter
Imagine expecting to have to guard Andre Drummond all night and you have to guard Anthony Davis instead
The league really gave Kyle Kuzma and Andre Drummond a prime Anthony Davis.
"&gt;passes a much different eye test than Kyrie did  And that's a very valid point and kind of what I was trying to show.    Defensive stats in general are very goofy. Brad Stevens: *""When I get an e-mail that has defensive metrics in it, I delete it.""*   Advanced stats like DRTG really don't show much of anything besides the team is good.   Raw stats like steals/blocks/rebounds don't show enough of the picture to actually declare a player is even good defensively.  * Steph Curry has led the league in steals  * Hassan Whiteside had led the league in blocks  * Andre Drummond has led the league in rebounds  I'm not saying Matisse is bad (he's obviously a very good defender), but DPOY is such a high bar to clear. Jrue Holiday, Marcus Smart and Chris Paul have never even cracked top 5 in votes. As an undersized defender with limited team-wide impact, Matisse has no real chance at DPOY.  Plus DPOY is a term we see thrown about by Philly fans.   * Embiid is a DPOY candidate (although he actually is) * Covington was a DPOY candidate * Simmons is a DPOY candidate * Thybulle will be a DPOY candidate  You can't just label everyone a DPOY candidate."
Without LeBron and AD on the court. Nobody is shifting attention from those 2 to double Andre fucking Drummond lmao
"I know but while there's athletic and skilled players like Blake Griffin, how does terrible post scorer Andre Drummond become a lottery pick?"
That looks like it might be longer than the Andre Drummond shot from full court.
"He was good offensively in the bubble, but he was legitimately horrible defensively in it. Still wasn't close to how he was before  Idk but he's hurt his leg and broken his wrist this season. He's never had good touch, but he's like an unathletic Andre Drummond around the rim this year."
I agree. However nowadays his playstyle no longer works in the NBA. I mean the Cavs can't even get anything for Andre Drummond.  Maybe if he was developed as a Jokic-style big man? Junemar himself said after facing Jokic in FIBA that he needs to play that way.
"ah yes, the top players blake griffin and andre drummond"
"GSW players communicated with KD all season about how much they needed him:  &gt;""Here's the thing that's interesting about Golden State -- their players have been recruiting Kevin Durant all year. And it goes back to early in the season when the Thunder were struggling. And I don't know if Golden State saw them as a peer; I don't know that they saw them as a threat ...  &gt;Kevin Durant, just like he was hearing from guys in Boston, Washington, different places -- he was hearing from guys on the Warriors about, 'Hey, you can come help take the pressure off of Steph Curry. We need you.' This is when they were running off win after win after win.  Andre Drummond later said publicly that they wanted KD so *they didn't have to play against him*."
"I was going to say AD too but I guess he counts as a PF for the sake of this, but if you count him as a centre then he's on the list too.  After that it's... Brook Lopez? Myles Turner? Uhhh Andre Drummond?  And then we're starting to get reaaaaally thin from here lol"
"Bron is beast. But let’s not pretend he didn’t have bosh, wade, ray allen, shaq, kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, Dwight Howard as team mates. He’s an all time great but he’s have a lot of help."
I guess Andre Drummond didn't get the memo.
"This  Like it’s some angry pistons fans, and I don’t blame em, but I’ve seen a lot more NBA fans mad at him.  Mans gave us his best individual season while carrying Andre “dumbass” Drummond and great value Bobby Shmurda to the playoffs. Got injured toward the end of the season, and still came back way to early to face the Bucks in the sweep that was inevitable.  Can’t possibly hate this man. Embraced the city, was a class act, and showed our dumbass owner what we need if we really wanna start winning."
Zubac looking like Andre Drummond out there missing those layups
"They won't be able to guard him at all. I mean, they could barely guard Andre Drummond, so imagine what the reigning back to back MVP who dominates inside is going to do"
"Uhh, yikes. It'd have to be someone really bad at free throws, but they still somehow shoot a lot of them. DeAndre Jordan and Andre Drummond come to mind, but besides that, I dunno. Even LeBron is a full 30% better than Big Ben was."
"I agree with that, but you’d at least think Embiid could handle some of those responsibilities. He’s not as agile as AD, but he’s capable.   Even Andre Drummond and Marc Gasol have shown to be competent this season at the coverage. I see Embiid as more agile than both of them. Worth at least trying. The “Drop Coverage” will get them hammered in the playoffs, I imagine..."
Andre Drummond goat jump ball center.  [Look at how easy he beats Adams](https://youtu.be/_LRRoN_x60w)
"Your A-Team got torched by Andre Drummond and Harrell. What happens when that’s Giannis and Embiid and AD, even Bam or Capela? KD and Claxton really gonna bang down low with them for a full series?"
"[I found this site that shows jump ball stats](https://www.otherbasketballstats.com/pages/jumpball/jumpball) and it's super interesting.  Out of players with 40+ attempts Andre Drummond has the best win% (.82) while Vucevic has the worst (.25).  What's also a little interesting is that the leaders for rebound% in the league are average-to-very-poor at winning jump balls:  Clint Capela - 1st in rebound %, wins .47 of jump balls  Enes Kanter - 2nd in rebound %, wins .28 of jump balls  Jonas Valančiūnas - 3rd in rebound %, wins .46 of jump balls"
&gt;K Love also did it once with the Timberwolves   &gt;   &gt;It’s a list of one. Andre Drummond.

"""What the fuck was that"" - The Andre Drummond experience"
"Ah yes, the fabled Andre Drummond 13-foot floater.   I don't miss it."
Andre drummond 3/11 from the field. I don't understand a man that large is so inefficient around the rim
That if Andre Drummond is you’re 5th best option you have problems? What about that doesn’t make sense. Dude is trash other than rebounding
Andre Drummond but good
This 19 year old just did what Andre Drummond never could to Jared Allen
"I agree on the conditioning aspect of the early 2000s basketball.  Early 90s Shaq aged to the modern game without weight gain and a 12'4 max vertical was who I was referring to.  The trend around the league, however, has been in opposition to your point.  There aren't any sub 50% high volume shooters left and the league as a whole especially over the past 2 years has seen a noticeable increase in ft%.   Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan and Brandon Ingram are all guys who were positionally terrible from the free throw line and made record breaking improvements after working with modern free throw coaching. Even Tacko Fall is finding time on the floor for non-meme minutes after being unplayably bad from the free throw line at USF.  Shaquille O'Neal did not focus as much on free throws, this is known.  He had one good free throw season in LA and basically said ""Im good."". Better coaching and general social pressure would force him to do so today and he wouldn't be one hand scooping the ball like he did with Miami."
Winner gets Andre Drummond
"In terms of names, LeBron James, although this is partly because of how often he's changed teams, although most of them were after their primes. Chronologically:  * Carlos Boozer * Ben Wallace * Shaquille O'Neal * Dwyane Wade * Chris Bosh * Ray Allen * Rashard Lewis * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Love * Shawn Marion * Isaiah Thomas * Derrick Rose * Rajon Rondo * Tyson Chandler * Anthony Davis * Dwight Howard * Marc Gasol * Andre Drummond"
They couldn't guard Andre Drummond. How are they supposed to guard the reigning back to back MVP?
He’s also referencing Andre Drummond in the quote too..
"Andre Drummond, surprisingly"
"He was a significantly better defensive player before 1995. In 1994, he’s the effect Hakeem had on the superstar interior players the Rockets faced during their run.  Barkley- TS dropped 3% compared to the regular season  Malone- TS dropped 4.5% compared to the regular season  Ewing (the most impressive one)- held to 19 points on 39% TS. He put the 4th or 5th best center in the league (a bonafide star) on lockdown. He made Ewing look worse than Andre Drummond offensively."
"Absolutely. Andre Drummond is a better fit, they should trade for him."
Andre drummond
I think there’s more Andre Drummond hate
"&gt; the Andre Drummond experience  The AD experience derives from the long-term averages, not from the occasional game where he looks like a top-10 player."

Insane. Guess skip was right. Andre will be Kareem Abdul - Drummond when Bron comes back
"Vuc, Zion, the Lopez bros, boogie cousins, trez Harrell, jo Val, richaun Holmes, Andre Drummond."
"Jalen Rose ""Andre Drummond is gonna be a major factor come playoff time for the Lakers""  YES! Will be quite the locker room problem when he's benched in a remotely close game!"
Can we please not refer to Andre Drummond as “AD” while he’s on the same team as Anthony Davis?
Tried to do too much? My Andre Drummond experience is that he didn’t try at all and would jog down the court on offense and defense.
Andre Drummond and Blake Griffin
This was just one game. Like 2 games ago he was horrible.  That's the Andre Drummond experience.  Is this sub just going to ping pong back and forth after every game?
Andre do a 360 Drummond
"Without Gobert, this was a really good opportunity for Andre Drummond.. there was really no one fighting with him for boards."
"Dude exposed himself as someone who doesn't watch Andre Drummond while criticizing people for not watching Andre Drummond, lmao"
andre drummond is good
~~Lebron got JR Smith?? Lol imagine thinking this will work~~   ~~Lebron got Dwight Howard?? Lol imagine thinking this will work~~   ~~Lebron got KCP?? Lol imagine thinking this will work~~   Lebron got Andre Drummond? Lol imagine thinking this will work
“Hell nah!!!!” -Andre Drummond after every single miss 😂
"We just added Andre Drummond, who isn’t a scrub"
yeah it’s hard to play a new role suddenly but when andre drummond picks your pass that’s sad
I was told that I would not enjoy the Andre Drummond experience
Lmao that was the perfect Andre Drummond experience.
"on the real, how are you letting andre drummond of all people score on one man slow breaks?"
"#ANDRE ""DEFENSIVE POINT GOD"" DRUMMOND"
Wtf *is* Andre Drummond?
Who doesn’t get amped up on a beautiful Saturday to see the marquee matchup between Andre Drummond and Jordan Clarkson?
"Yeah but I think it's ""easier"" for him to get rebounds no matter who the opponent is, there is no scheme to take away that, he's just gonna get the ball basicall no matter what.  It's not just for him, I think overall assists number have way correlation to wins than rebounds, worth nothing that maybe I'm biased because I'm a Pistons fan who has had to watch Andre Drummond the king of rebounding with no correlation to winning"
"Sure, but Baynes is a large dude, I think Butler is pointing out a lack of boxing out. Team Rebounding always beats out individual play(I’m looking at you Andre Drummond.)"
If you throw Andre Drummond at Joel Embiid you will lose by 1000
"They did. Kanter coming in for Nurkic was huge  Without Dame to draw doubles, Nurkic is frankly an offensive liability. He's like Andre Drummond without the athleticism as a scorer"
"Yes, I’m serious. Andre Drummond is the best rebounder in the league and (imo) one of the worst players."
^(Andre Drummond in shambles)
Damian Jones walked so Andre Drummond can turn the ball over
More realistically: D. Fox JJ Redick James Harden KD Andre Drummond
You then lost Andre Drummond and Javale. I seriously don’t think you’re making that.
Andre Drummond and DeAndre Jordan would be perennial all-NBA players
"Lol this had the potential for good discussion but Andre Drummond is as dumb as a rock.  Historically, Hakeem, Tim Duncan."
"Only down by 12 points missing the best player in the game, Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, and Markiff Morris = a Win in my book"
&gt;Big guys with high IQ  &gt;Andre Drummond  Ye wot m8?
&gt; Andre Drummond  ??????????
"If a team let Tristen Thompson do whatever he wants, he would be exactly what the perception about Andre Drummond is turned up to 100"
"Oh wow, he got double doubles! Hall of fame time joining the one and only Andre Drummond, right?"
Andre Drummond really did that
"&gt;but it's your fault that Andre Drummond is a bum defensively...  That's not the end of the court on which he has problems.  His problem is shot selection, and even then only because his fundamentals are terrible."
Alternative thought: Andre Drummond has never listened to a coach his whole career.
Andre Drummond is the debatably the best player that hit the buyout market in NBA history.   The guy is probably worth around 15 million on the free market and now his cap hit is around 1/15th of that.
"&gt; I mean, it’s just a process, man. It’s not going to happen overnight. Rome wasn’t built overnight. I think that for him, it’s a big adjustment. When you think about it, he’s kind of really never really been coached in his career. Playing in Detroit, in Cleveland, and then coming here into a championship organization, it’s tough. It’s tough.  To all of those head coaches and assistants, sorry but it's your fault that Andre Drummond is a bum defensively. If only you'd tried to coach him, maybe the real coaches in LA wouldn't have to do it."
"I'll agree that our coaches have been pretty shit but let's not act like Drummond is easy to coach. You say one wrong thing to him and he starts moping and giving up. His attitude is one of the things that kept him from being successful, maybe playing for a contender will help but Andre is mostly to blame for his lack of success."
Thank you Andre Kareem Drummond
Nobody thinks more highly of Andre Drummond than Andre Drummond
Is there a player less self aware of his shortcomings than Andre Drummond lmfao
Andre Drummond at 30 will deliberately miss 30 consecutive shots to set the rebounding record.
Andre Drummond practicing stepbacks
andre drummond is my mortal enemy
y’all remember when the lakers fans were super happy to get andre drummond? seeing how they feel about him now is just funny lmao
Andre Drummond can compare to Chris Dudley.
"I saw a tweet that said Andre Drummond is ""that dude"" and that it wouldn't matter if Bron and AD rested until the playoffs cause Drummonds numbers were so good."
Andre Drummond is a fraud. Might be a nice person irl but he’s a basketball fraud. His stats are worthless. He looks like he’d be good but he sucks. His floater is ugly. He has kwame brown hands. Can’t play d. I don’t think even lebron James can make him look good. I wish him well in a different jersey next season.
Andre Drummond about to become the new Roy Hibbert
"Yup. At the time of his signing with LA, I had multiple discussions assuring Lakers fans Drummond was never a No. 1 offensive option in Detroit.  As someone intimately familiar with how bad some fellow Pistons' fans takes can be (and my own at times), I know better than to paint all Lakers fans with a broad brush but there were a fair bit who seemed to really misunderstand what they were getting in Andre."
[That should be required viewing for anyone entering a discussion on Andre Drummond.](https://streamable.com/gaj2eb)
"I've been on the anti-Andre Drummond train for years but I still agree with your take. I still think there's a window for him to be a positive contributor with a fully healthy Lakers team.   That said, I also think there's just about as good a chance he approaches the game the same way he always has and at that point, he's hopeless."
"There's always fans on all sides of everything. There were plenty of sensible Lakers fans who seemed to have an okay grasp on what Andre was and what Andre wasn't.  However, as Pistons fans, most of us have spent the better part of the past five years trying to explain to anyone who would listen that judging Andre's on-court impact by his points and rebounds alone was ill-advised. And on account of no-one watching the Pistons (we've been irrelevant for the better part of a decade), there's been a lot of takes from all sides that were just really, really off-base. So I think Pistons fans feel a sense of vindication (and perhaps brotherhood) when others see the light.   I personally kind of enjoy talking Drummond because it's one of the few topics related to the Pistons that are actually relevant right now. But the number of times I've had to assert that Drummond was never, in fact, our No. 1 offensive option has been a bit disconcerting."
Andre Drummond had a better win % with the Cavs than with the Lakers so far. You love to see it.
"I still maintain that the Andre Drummond Experience^TM is probably quite a bit different had he played with a healthy LeBron for these past 4 weeks. The Lakers are a bad team without AD and Bron, Drummond was never going to fix that."
"Bro I saw the Andre Drummond experience streamable that somebody posted earlier this year after the whole draymond thing, where he bricked shot after shot, couldn't dribble or pass and laughed my ass off. Now here am I crying in the club cause we ended up with him"
Andre Drummond also has quick hands but that doesn’t mean he’s good at defense
Man I wasnt even high on McGee until I saw Andre Drummond as a roll man.
The MVP defaults to Andre Drummond
Russ wins 75% of his games when he has a triple double. He is just doing what he needs to do to win games and it works  This is what separates him from an actual stat padder like Andre Drummond
"MJ stans were telling me LeBron went out to grab himself another all-star. Andre Drummond is so bad, not a single team in the league would trade a second round pick for him.  Edit: Yes, I do understand there were tax implications. Real All-Stars are worth a lot more than penalties and second rounders."
"I’ve never seen someone with negative basketball IQ until I watched Drummond. I’m sure he’s a nice guy, but fuck Andre Drummond"
"Josh Smith, Greg Monroe, Andre Drummond"
"Andre Drummond is probably the most disappointing big in the league.   His size, mobility, and ability to leverage that size and strength should make him a good traditional center and he just isn't.   He's awful with the ball in his hands (no ball skills and bad touch around the rim), his shot selection is bad (steady diet of inefficient back-to-the-basket post-ups), and even though he's a big, strong, mobile guy, he's not a rim protector on the level of someone like Myles Turner, Clint Capela, or Brook Lopez."
let the blame game on lebrons teammates begin.. ladies and gentleman.. enter andre drummond!.. next week we will be covering anthony davis!!
And is now officially better than Andre Drummond
Will Purdue now is better than Andre Drummond.
Javale was a positive on the defensive end. Andre Drummond might be the most useless 7fter on that side of the ball outside of Porzingis
"Ah yes, welcome to the Andre Drummond experience. You may have been baffled by Detroit fans souring on the 7-foot rebounding monster after 7 seasons and Cleveland fans souring on him after barely a season...but you are already starting to understand why. Enjoy the ride!!  He's gotta have the worst touch around the basket out of any above-average big I've  ever seen."

Andre Drummond has negative basketball IQ to go along with being inefficient as hell lol
Andre Drummond is what his haters think Russel Westbrook is.
"Take the wall Trump was gonna build, but put it around Detroit, with big signs on the side saying ""Andre Drummond is not allowed"""
"Watch his high school tape , believe it or not he was actually a point forward on his team:   [Andre Drummond Official Mixtape Vol. 4 UCONN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXB6vc5Z_A4)  Drummond was the #1 rated prospect in his HS class for a while (until Anthony Davis had his growth spurt basically). I honestly think he grew too big and lost control of his body that he had when he was younger, he also doesn't look like he keeps himself in the best shape either."
Exciting narrative &gt; watching Andre Drummond play 8 seasons of basketball.
Lakers fans deleting their positive comments about Andre Drummond when he first arrived to the team as we speak
Andre Drummond is my new favorite player in the NBA
"""Now look at Andre Drummond"" lmao"
I can legitimately say that I hate watching Andre Drummond play basketball
I wonder if literally every human ever who had ever watched Andre Drummond could have predicted this.
God bless Andre Drummond
DAE Andre Drummond bad?  Give me upvotes
He wouldn't be Andre Drummond tho if he never dribbled
"Since when are impact stats used for All-NBA lol, I think you're overestimating the amount of actual thought/research voters put into these awards.   More importantly, it'd prevent snubs DUE to positional restrictions, like DeAndre Jordan and Andre Drummond making it in 2016, despite being nowhere near the best of the league.  It'd also help to reflect what positons were truly stacked during a specific time period, like up until recently the death of the big was a very real thing, and the teams would've properly reflected that."
Andre Drummond and Marquis Teague had two incredible ones as well.
"For sure. Raw defensive numbers always fail to truly encapsulate the value defenders have.      Using your Giannis example, the Greek Freak averages  1.2 steals and 1.3 blocks. I think Andre Drummond averages 1.4 steals and 1.5 blocks. However we all know that 101 out of 100 people would say that Giannis is a greater defender."
"nah you lost multiple key pieces and replaced them with andre drummond and dennis schroder.  marc gasol is a good piece but he's not enough to replace dwight, danny and rondo  lebron is a year older with even more wear on his knees  you should honestly remove that flair because I feel embarrassed for all the reasonable and normal laker fans on your behalf, your comments are so cringey"
Andre Drummond is basically useless against small teams
"Theis tbh.  If “empty stats” was a player, it’d be Andre Drummond"
"Theis doesn't think he is what Andre Drummond thinks Andre Drummond is, so Theis."
Clint Capela is who dumb people think Andre Drummond is
"I mean rebounding is a good skill but unlike every other major skill such as shooting or defense, you cannot just bank on rebounding to be good in the league. You need other things  This is the difference between Clint Capela and Andre Drummond"
&gt;Andre Drummond (who’s a good backup center at best at this point)  No
"Kevin Love, James Wiseman, and Andre Drummond come to mind"
"3 way tie between Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Andre Drummond"
Unless your name is Andre Drummond (who’s a good backup center at best at this point)
KD looking like Andre Drummond trying to handle the rock
"man K Love has a worse contract than what Andre ""Trojan ~~Horse~~ Piston"" Drummond had.  will he be bought out next season?"
"&gt;Save face where you can I guess.   That would be an excellent idea for you, at this point.  You've embarrassed yourself plenty.  &gt;you have a fundamental misunderstanding of math and statistics,   Says the person who also just said ""I can't do math"" and believes that effective FG% and TS% have anything at all to do with risk.  And who also said ""I'm pretty sure his eFG% is skewed because he doesn't take 3's.""  That is truly rich, and hilarious.  In the future, you'll want to avoid getting involved in discussions where you have zero grounding in the material.  The entire point of eFG% is to balance the value of twos and threes -- there is no advantage to either, from the perspective of eFG%.  That's the type of thing you'll need to learn, before trying to discuss this any further.  &gt; You straight up ignored my simple breakdown of the math   No, I didn't, I got a very good laugh out of it.  I skipped addressing it because it was unnecessary to illustrate how far beyond your depth you are.  &gt;Believe what you want, but Drummond will never be seen as an efficient player for the reasons I laid out   Here's where the rubber meets the road.  Drummond is currently the 64th most-efficient player in NBA history from the floor -- which was the original area of your concern, I will remind you.  You've run away from that original claim with some speed, but here it is again, in case you've forgotten.  ""He'll get his rebounds, especially on the offensive boards, because he's gonna miss those open layups, dunks, and gimmes."" -- /u/KalBaratheon  That's been thoroughly and completely proven wrong.  Of course he misses shots, but he misses fewer than 98 out of 100 NBA players ever -- by effective FG%.  So let's consider TS%, which wasn't the original claim, but rather a subsequent claim you were forced to hide behind, in attempt to, say you put it, save face.  Drummond has been a bad free-throw shooter, that's certainly beyond dispute.  Although he's been closer to mediocre with the Lakers, shooting at a 65% clip.  His career 47% is truly wretched, on that much we can probably agree.    So how much difference does that actually make?  Teams don't foul Drummond very much -- although they probably should given the disparity between his shooting from the floor and from the line.  For his career, he averages 2.3 FTM on only 4.8 FTA per game.  If he made just 1 more FT per game -- 69% instead of his 47% -- that single free throw would boost his career TS% from 53.8% to 57.7% and put Drummond into 66th place all-time in that category as well.  That's in the 98th percentile of all NBA players ever -- not that you have any idea what that phrase means, but maybe you can look it up, and other folks reading this might understand it.  That's it.  That's the entire difference between Andre Drummond's career to-date and being one of the more efficient scorers in NBA history.  One measly free-throw per game."
"DeAndre Jordan and Andre Drummond, name a more anemic duo"
"It’s actually crazy how true that is. Just being a laker boosts your reputation tenfold. AD ended up being a top 5 player all of a sudden and a top 2 pf all time. THT is the best young player ever, Lakers will fix montrezl and lebron will make Andre Drummond good, etc etc. Even guys like Alex Caruso get boosted just because they’re on the Lakers. The influence is undeniable"
100%  Gasol is better than playing Andre Drummond next to AD who clogs up the paint or Montrezl Harrell who is undersized and a defensive liability. The best option remains playing AD at center but Gasol is a great backup
"@wojespn: “BREAKING: Anthony Davis ruled out of today’s AMA, Andre Drummond will take his place. Frank Vogel not expected to give Marc Gasol any time to answer questions.”"
"Andre Drummond seems to have some great ankles (albeit hairy), I thought that was why we signed him"
"Remember during the buyout period when everyone was flipping shit and acting like Blake griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge and Andre Drummond were insane pickups? That was funny."
"I'm beating a dead horse into the ground here, but remember that the OKC Thunder let a dynasty away because they couldn't afford to keep Harden (not true,) ""there was only one basketball"" (KD and Harden *currently play together and are the favorites to win, at a bare minimum, the East*,) and because Westbrook ""wouldn't share the ball"" (Westbrook *averages* 8.5 assists a game for his *career*. Same # as Steve Nash. More APG averaged than Mark Jackson.)   You can get pissed because LeBron plays on a ""SuperTeam"" with 45-time champ Andre Drummond. I'll save my anger for franchises that don't even try to win and/or who place finances over winning."
"Andre Drummond is a bona fide scrub! He can't play! No disrespect whatsoever, but I'm sorry to call, tell everybody the truth, the man cannot play the game of basketball. He has small hands, he can't catch the ball, he has bad feet, he can't really move even though he's mobile, doesn't really know what he's doing, doesn't have a post move that he or he puts to memory that he can do two times in a row. He has no game whatsoever, plays no defense, doesn't have the heart, the passion or anything that comes with it"
Everyone compared him to Jr Smith but as I stated at the time JR Smiths BBIQ is closer to that of a LeBron/Jokic/Nash/Curry genius in than it is to a brain dead vegetable like Andre Drummond
"If a roll man on a PnR rolls into a close out defender of the ball handler taking a jumper its an offensive foul every time. Same concept, AD just sold it bc refs usually only notice bigs running into guards. If an offensive player wants to impede the movement of a defender on the perimeter, they gotta set themselves, whether they are 6'11"" andre drummond or 5'11"" Facu campazzo."
The fact that anyone in the Lakers organization thought that Andre Drummond was a good player just goes to show you the Lakers ONLY have a good team because of LeBron and AD.
The Andre Drummond experience. Can't say Cavs and Pistons fans didn't warn them.
Yep. It feels like only yesterday a portion of Lakers fans (emphasis on portion) were trying to tell me Drummond was a first option in Detroit all these years; that he’d thrive without having to carry all the offensive load himself.  Some folks really wanted to believe our criticisms were all just a product of being really salty about Andre leaving. We were salty because he couldn’t stop trying to do things he wasn’t good at.
I would have loved to have Allen over Drummond in Detroit. Any guy who knows his role and loves to work has a pretty big edge on Andre right from the start.
"Ngl, there’s a video I saw on this sub that was literally “Andre Drummond is not a good basketball player.” And ever since watching that, he’s right.   He forces layups/shots that aren’t even good for foul calling. It’s just thrown up shots and trying to rebound it very quickly for a tip in.   Found it: https://youtu.be/PclERcD6cJA"
"I'd take Mitchell Robinson and Nerlens Noel over Andre Drummond. Hell, maybe even Taj Gibson too. Andre Drummond is REALLY bad."
Andre drummond is the WORST high usage offensive player
Andre Drummond might end up making a push towards the top 10 by the time he retires as well.
"Unless the Lakers are desperate for rebounding, I'm surprised people believed Andre Drummond would be a better option at C than Marc Gasol if they actually have seen both play"
Andre Drummond is going to cost the Lakers a ring.
AD stands for Andre Drummond tho.
Finally we can all tell Andre Drummond how we feel.
Just weird how melo had to fight for a contract and teams are fighting over Andre Drummond in the buyout market
"&gt; Coincidentally, Andre Drummond...   You forget the part where Drummond guarded Jokic solo for almost all of his 20 minutes, which allowed the other Lakers to stay at home, and not give Jokic open players to pass to, and not surrender open shots.  Drummond was very good in this game, despite not scoring or rebounding.  One of the better games he has played for Los Angeles, actually.  Gasol did most of his damage against Javale McGee, by the way."
"Andre ""Roy Hibbert"" Drummond"
Andre Drummond ZERO rebound. Is this a glitch?
"It took them seeing Andre Drummond play for them to realize how solid Marc has been, lol."
The guard Andre Drummond?
Frank Vogel sees your stats and raises you an Andre Drummond.
Enjoy Andre Drummond and getting bounced early.
"Atleast Drummond can defend, Marc gave up a lot to Jokic. And the bench lighting it up from 3 isn't as much about Gasol as you guys seem to think, he hit 2 and brings an extra shooter but it still comes down to baskets falling. Look at Caruso turnovers when Andre was in the floor, and AD missing. Jok was 8/20 vs. Drummond in the first half. This team largely comes down to iso play from Lebron and Davis. Gasol dosnt do much for them but I like him leading the second unit, I'd said he would be useful in that role before the Lakers signed Drummond.  And when they took out Gasol in the fourth it was a good call, Jok was starting to bully him and he looked tired."
"I was worried when I saw Andre Drummond was signed, really hoping coaching staff bench him come playoffs. I wanted to be proven wrong about Drummond but so far watching him on the Lakers has been pretty horrendous, misses easy layups and simply tip ins at the rim more often than he hits them. Maybe when Bron is back and can feed for easy dunks? Dude isn't even too slow on his feet so idk how he has so much trouble finishing at the rim."
Lakers' win condition was Andre Drummond fouling out as early as possible!
"Andre Drummond, can't you read?"
Show some respect for the Lakers' centers.  Marc Gasol provides TEAM BASKETBALL and OUTSIDE SHOOTING  Montrezl Harrell provides SCORING and ENERGY  Andre Drummond
"Found the quote haha  [“I punched him in the head,” Drummond said. “He didn’t do it again. It happened more than once too. It was because of rebounds ..... I pulled him aside during a timeout and said, ‘Yo bro, you don’t see me trying to go for 50 every night, don’t try to come in for rebounds.’”](https://www.google.com/amp/s/cavaliersnation.com/2020/05/19/andre-drummond-says-he-used-punch-former-teammate-who-kept-coming-take-his-rebounds/amp/)"
Andre Drummond = Jordan Love  Marc Gasol = Aaron Rodgers
"To be fair, nobody is better at making Andre Drummond look bad than Andre Drummond."
Andre Drummond: 4 points -5  Marc Gasol: 7 points 4 rebounds +12
has anyone else on this thread noticed andre drummond being a bit shit at basketball?
I deeply regret trading for that bum Andre Drummond.
.&gt; Andre Drummond on the court again  Frank Vogel is incapable of learning.
Andre Drummond -8  Marc Gasol +6
"The trouble with Andre Drummond is that he has zero touch at the rim. Gobert is an incredible roller because he can grab pretty much anything you throw at him, among other things. Drummond has all the physical tools in the world and is an incredible rebounder but he has no feel for the game. Total waste of potential."
Imagine if Andre Drummond accepted a role playing like Clint Capela or Rudy Gobert instead of a wanna be Al Jefferson
"Andre Drummond not dunking the ball when under the basket.  Also, getting his own rebound  And lastly, LeBron's telekinesis power against the refs"
I wanna see Andre Drummond imitate Steph Curry and Damian Lillard while he is still in his prime
"Think more Tristan Thompson and Andre Drummond. This scenario is more if you had an expansion draft, and for some stupid reason the Nets let go of KD and Harden"
If we kept that 2018 team + made the correct draft choices:  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander - Donovan Mitchell - Devin Booker - Tobias Harris - Andre Drummond
"Chicago - Derrick Rose  Milwaukee - Giannis  Boston - Tatum  Warriors - Curry  Atlanta - Kevin Huerter (no clue why)  76ers - Iverson  Hornets - Kemba  Memphis - Zach Randolph  Washington - Nick Young  Lakers - Kobe  Pelicans - Anthony Davis  Wolves - KAT  Knicks - I immediately thought of Spike Lee and Mike Woodson before thinking about Melo, and am now realizing that Woodson also played for the Knicks in the 80s. So, Mike Woodson.  Toronto - Kyle Lowry  Miami - Wade  Pacers - Sabonis  Jazz - Mitchell  Denver - Melo again  Cavs - LeBron  Spurs - Timmy  Nets - Deron Williams (sorry Nets fans lol)  Portland - Dame  Phoenix - Steve Nash  Kings - Bogdan Bogdanovic (yeah that's an odd one)  Pistons - Andre Drummond  Magic - Dwight  Rockets - Harden  Mavs - Dirk  OKC - Russell Westbrook  Clippers - Blake Griffin"
We can split hairs on semantics and/or agree to disagree.  I don't believe an nba player that's an elite rebounder can be called soft. You can bring up Andre Drummond and I'll admit I've not watched that dude play much. Securing boards against bigs is hugely demanding physically. Playing big minutes through a separated shoulder demonstrates physical and mental toughness--even if one ignores the fact the dude wasn't eating food until sundown.  It's arguable that one who's been in the the league for a decade not taking steps to further the one glaring hole in one's game soft perhaps. I don't think that's the best word to describe that.  Kanter isn't even that bad of a post defender (compared to his pick &amp; roll defense). Jokic is going to make any defender look like bbq chicken. With the shooting trends in the past ten years Enes's deficiency in guarding the ball handler or screen setter has become more and more apparent.  Kanter is a bad defender because of the lack of lateral quickness &amp; not having a strong grasp of the defensive side of the court everywhere but boxing out and getting boards. Saying he's not good at defense because he's soft isn't accurate.
1. Andre Drummond leaving the bench   2. Andre Drummond taking his warm ups off  3. Andre Drummond checking into the game
This. Andre Drummond is a Fantasy Points stud. Elfred Payton...just no :-P
Andre Drummond starts sir
You should add: Andre Drummond potentially getting a real contract in the off-season
But why does Norman Powell look like a smaller version of Andre Drummond?
"Norm Powell, Andre Drummond, and Anthony Davis all wear so many extra clothes when they play"
andre drummond
I really don’t know what Lakers fans were expecting lol. As a Philly fan you probably know first hand just how terrible Andre Drummond is at pretty much everything aside from rebounding and being a gigantic human being.
1) Andre Drummond playing defense.   2) Andre Drummond missing layups.  3) Frank Vogel not subbing Andre Drummond when it’s obvious he’s playing like shit.
"Yes, Andre Drummond can do stuff like that easily: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_DTdAou1hHg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DTdAou1hHg)  He also doesn't always have the IQ to know when he shouldn't do it as an NBA center, which is the same problem Wiseman has."
"i was responding to a comment about the lakers having the best roster in general, not just compared to the clippers. in general, having andre drummond as your center does not make you have the best roster."
Andre Drummond and Austin Rivers. Solved.
"Lebron could take a shit at center court, tell it to play the 5, and it'd have more of an impact on the floor than Andre Drummond. Marc Gasol is a better scorer, passer, defender, and has better BBIQ than Andre Drummond. Marc Gasol suffering cardiac arrest is more valuable than Andre Drummond. But hey what we would do without his offensive rebound-to-turnovers?   I just wanna apologize to Cavs and Pistons fans for not taking you at your word. Heed me ye other teams, don't let the box score fool you, the man is worse than useless. We're paying this big fuck almost $800,000 to exist.  Also he can't dunk."
Andre Drummond to the warrior's for Wiggins.
"For the love of god, please don’t put this energy into the universe—this is the second goddamn time I’ve seen someone on here say the Kings are gonna give Drummond the bag this summer. I know we’ve been incompetently run but I have to believe we’re above signing Andre fucking Drummond or I’ll lose my fucking mind"
"I can't help but laugh at the switching back and forth between AD = Andre Drummond and AD = Anthony Davis, but knowing exactly who you meant just based on context."
[This one lol.](https://twitter.com/HoHighlights/status/1347378714133164032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1347378714133164032%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.audacy.com%2Fsports%2Fnba%2Fwhat-was-andre-drummond-thinking-on-this-crazy-shot-attempt) The announcers said it perfectly.   I really don’t think Drummond was all that checked out. I think that’s just who he is as a player. I don’t mean to shit on him just for the sake of it but he’s truly the definition of an empty stats player.
Clippers and Jazz were a lot better than the Celtics and Pistons...  &gt;Oh that’s right this is r/nba so rationality doesn’t exist and hot takes are the norm   It’s honestly hilarious how you’re comparing Jokic dominating against Rudy Gobert and Dwight/AD to Giannis dominating against Al Horford and Andre Drummond.
It’s incredible the Lakers defense is as good as it is starting Andre Drummond
Nah AD was hot trash. This loss is on him. You expect the superstars to carry the load not fucking Andre Drummond.
Nah AD was hot trash. This loss is on him. You expect the superstars to carry the load not fucking Andre Drummond.
"We had to wait way, way, way too long for Playoff Booker. What a joy to watch, man. He had some awesome hustle plays, including [a box-out on Andre Drummond that had me cackling.](https://twitter.com/KellanOlson/status/1396667804724518917?s=20) I hope these Suns take this series -- not that I dislike LeBron or the Lakers, but I just have so much respect for the Suns coming-out party this year. Watching home-grown players succeed against giants like the Lakers is just true sports joy."
Andre Drummond.
Do you.  I saw Elfrid Payton and Andre Drummond start in the playoffs this weekend and I'm starting to wonder if you have to be good or not.
"Suns have at least 1-2 extra gears from this offensively. Not worried.   The Lakers can do some interesting things and should just ban the existence of Andre Drummond, but really most of their stuff boils down to ""play better"". LeBron will. Will the others?"
"Am I crazy for thinking Gasol should be playing all the minutes they gave to Drummond? Andre is a losing player, straight up. Gasol would D up Ayton better imo."
See Andre Drummond

Andre Drummond
DA playing well is a combo of him playing well and Andre Drummond leaving him wide open in the lane. DA even had one play where no one was guarding him lmao
Lol I’ve seen exactly the opposite here  As a PLAYER(not a person) he’s probably the most criticized big name player on here  People call KD “snek” and stuff like that but a big portion of this sub acts like Westbrook is the point guard version of Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond
"I would rather drive my car at the highest speed it can reach directly into a freeway center divider, killing me instantly, then watch Andre Drummond dribble or make any kind of offensive ""move"" that isn't an open dunk."
"&gt;He had good defence; not spectacular, but a positive impact.   That's not even close to correct.  Watch the first three quarters again.  Davis simply watched the game on that end, save for a few minutes in the fourth.  It was one of the worst defensive efforts I have ever seen in a playoff game.  There's a reason Davis was -18 for the game, by far the worst of anyone who played.  He was a disaster on both ends in this game, and was the worst big who got off the bench.  Yes, that means he was substantially worse than even Andre Drummond today."
"Embiid doesnt flop for his calls, yeah he sometimes does it when plyers shove him like Donovan Mitchell and Andre Drummond but he doesnt really flop in the post he mostly just takes advantages of defenders reaching or having poor position"
Andre Drummond made all-nba based on rebounds
"Yeah shame on the Pistons for not developing Andre Drummond. Look at how awesome he is on the Lakers now, right?  clown"
"Andre Drummond making an All-NBA team   Jerry Stackhouse averaging 30ppg in 2001 shooting 41% from the field and making the all star team.   There's really not many true ""Empty stats"" players of players either obviously statpadding, or sacrificing wins for numbers"
Andre Drummond
If AD keeps doing this Andre Drummond impression Suns can beat the lakers tbh
Playing Andre Drummond and other dudes who continue to play bad. No accountability
"As a Piston fan, I would politely request not watching Andre Drummond play if you can avoid it"
I was listening to LA’s local sports radio before the game and one of the broadcasters on Roggin and Rodney was 100% serious saying he’d rather have Andre Drummond instead of DeAndre Ayton.
LeBron ran from the jays   But hey Andre Drummond tho
I feel physical pain whenever I see Andre Drummond with a basketball in his hands
I was happy I no longer had to watch Kent Bazemore play basketball this season but then Andre Drummond appeared
AD = Andre Drummond
Unless you mean Andre Drummond this doesn’t make any sense lol
Andre Drummond?
we force Andre Drummond to change his name to Lebron James then trade him
Don't say that even as a joke. I'd rather put 98 year old bill Russell on the court over Andre drummond out there
bruh a stupid video game i used to play on my phone aint got nothing to do with the fact that andre drummond is straight cheecks and you snd your fucking fan base tried to convince us he wasnt lmao  Now hush up and go back to your sub
andre drummond
Marc Gasol has to have a lifetime membership to one of those places that lets you throw axes at walls cause how tf does he stay composed on the bench while watching Andre Drummond do the bullshit he does on the court.
I just saw Andre Drummond at a strip club maskless u/NBA
Andre Drummond doesn’t deserve to play any more minutes for the rest of this series
 Hard to win a game when Anthony Davis is out there making his best Andre Drummond impersonation.
Andre Drummond has to play or Ayton will feast on the boards. It sucks but that is where the Lakers are.
Andre Drummond? Yea
Andre Drummond has played his role. How can you call 12 pts 9 rebounds empty stats? He’s has had a better impact on this game than most other Lakers
"This is my first time watching Andre Drummond, holy fuck hes as bad as everyone says he is"
Lakers gonna get bounced in the first round due to Andre Drummond lmao.
I hate Andre Drummond so much
Vogel seeing Andre Drummond bricking a wide open layup: is this Hakeem Olajuwon?
How come every single team Drummond plays for insists on fucking running offense through him????? They have a FUCKING GOAT on their godamn team why are you posting up ANDRE DRUMMOND!!!!
Wob: is Andre Drummond holding Frank Vogel’s family ransom?
I love you Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond shouldn't ever be allowed to play basketball. What a shit player
Suns legends Andre Drummond and Dennis Schroder
Lakers are paying AD and Lebron a combine 340 million. But for some reason they've decided to run their offense through Andre Drummond getting paid 790k.
"Who would you rather have on your team, Andre Drummond or Alex Len"
"I would rather drive my car at the highest possible speed it can reach into a freeway center divider, killing me instantly, than watch Andre Drummond dribble."
Andre Drummond is an absolute liability
Andre Drummond worst player in the league omg hahaha
Lakers really wasting LeBron's final years with Andre Drummond
Vogel is really going to leave Andre “all I can do is stand under the basket and clog the lane” Drummond out there
The world finally sees the true Andre Drummond. Thanks for that trade Clevland
Andre Drummond DO SOMETHING Challenge
Take Andre Drummond off the floor if you want to win lakers
for whatever reason Andre Drummond thinks he is a skilled big man. Dunk the fucking ball you dummy
how did andre drummond being gifted FTs he can't hit escalate into lamelo ball hate lmao lakers fans break the IQ scale
"So in that first half, we know that Andre Drummond cannot guard Ayton. Probably don't need another half of Drummond on Ayton."
Andre Drummond makes me so mad becaad3Brian Drummond has such a cool voice. This dude should not be in the nba. He's just fat and misses everything.
"Andre drummond is so bad on offense. He's like draymond, but without the basketball IQ"
i actually don’t think the lakers can play andre drummond in this series. they’ve look like ass w him on the court
Andre Drummond is fucking hilarious on both ends of the floor
Andre 'Dan Orlovsky' Drummond
Imagine not giving Marc Gasol minutes over Andre Drummond
Lol Andre Drummond man
Andre Drummond should never see the floor for the lakers
Andre Drummond is such an amazing rebounder. The list ends there.
Andre “THE TRUTH” Drummond
Andre Drummond and Marc gasol will get it done. Two all star caliber player for only ONE all star player?   It’s such a gimme for the blazers they can’t say no to that deal! /s
"&gt;This year it was back down to 54% which is quite bad but still above his own average.  League median is only 57%.  Schroder could obviously be more efficient, but managing even 54% in their ""system"" this season was not bad.  Vogel has no offensive ideas beyond ""Isolate James and watch him"", ""Isolate Davis and let him shoot fadeaways"", and pick-and-rolls.  Everything else was just freelancing, like on a playground.  So for a good chunk of the season, Schroder was out with some combination of Wesley Matthews, Markieff Morris, Andre Drummond, Alex Caruso, Kyle Kuzma, and Caldwell-Pope and they were just making up whatever.  They were completely dependent on Schroder's ability to break down a defense and make something good happen, which he often did.  Even surrounded by that largely questionable offense, Schroder averaged 5.8 assists -- which is 26th in the League, and more than all but a couple secondary ball-handlers.  The very impressive company he's in there is: Steph Curry, Domantas Sabonis, Malcolm Brogdon, and Giannis Antetokounmpo."
She also compared Andre Drummond to Kareem in an instagram post
You're just lucky we don't have Andre Drummond anymore since KAT is the only big man in the league who he consistently dominates.
"Starters: Brandon Jennings, Josh Richardson, Kyle Kuzma, Jahlil Okafor, Andre Drummond  Bench: Derrick Caracter, Anthony Randolph, Marcus Banks, Jon Brockman  Coach: Paul Silas"
"Kuzma and Schroeder need to go... Caruso hustles so I don’t mind him too much.. Marc gasol is so slow now, useless. Andre Drummond can dunk and only dunk.. they need to work this summer."
DeAndre Ayton is definitely better than Andre Drummond.
I just watched Boban absolutley own the Clippers and Rick take him out of the game only to watch the Mavs start tanking and never put him back in. That was after I watched Vogel keep playing Andre Drummond over Marc Gasol and Montrez Harrell and whenever Harrel went in watching Lakers go on runs only to pull him and watch them tank and never put him back in.   NBA coaches are making some baffling center rotation calls.

Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond?
Andre Drummond is trash.   I loved that they did that to him and his hairy ass shoulders.   My favorite part was Bookers WHAT!?? Thought so!!!
"Can't argue with you there.   I would say that it's important to remember that while he is very tall, he's not super mobile or strong, which are arguably more important to getting rebounds. Like Andre Drummond is closer to 6 10 than 7 foot and can't jump very high and doesn't have elite length, but he's a historically great rebounder because he's so burly and has such quick feet.   But yeah, it's hard to argue that 1 rebound is acceptable."
Ppl really getting tight about this and taking it too seriously 😭 imagine getting upset about a comment about ANDRE DRUMMOND 😹😹
"I too, hope Andre Drummond is a Laker for a long time"
"Do the Lakers win if they swapped Jared Dudley with Devin Booker, Andre Drummond with DeAndre Ayton, and Dennis Schroeder with Chris Paul?"
"Will be a much bigger test than Andre Drummond, possibly maybe"
"&gt;Stick Andre Drummond in the lineup &amp; keep Bron &amp; AD out &amp; y’all gonna be asking yourselves: “Do Bron and AD need to come back before the playoffs?????” Yes, Andre Drummond is LIKE THAT.  https://twitter.com/mgrads/status/1376233606029352960?s=21"
Lakers fans salivate. Sign and trade for Andre Drummond incoming lol
"Andre ""These Cats"" Drummond"
Well curry was 28 and had a 72 win team backed up by elite shooting from klay and defensive player of the year draymond green. LeBron is 36 with his 2nd best player out and was backed up by Andre Drummond (yikes) and Dennis Schroeder 😅
I still remember seeing one dude claiming he would be the “3rd star” on the Lakers and people were only hating on him because he wasn’t a “flashy” scorer. Also the people hating don’t like/care about EFFICIENT scoring lmfaooo. I also remember how many Lakers fans thought picking Steven Adams over Andre Drummond was gonna age badly
Honest question: who’s more unplayable in the playoffs Andre Drummond or Enes Kanter?
You can lead an Andre Drummond to the post but not even gravity will makes his shots fall in.
Andre Drummond still being only 27 is one of the rare things that doesn't make me feel old
okay? that doesn't make the facts wrong. gasol is a shooter especially when compared to freaking andre drummond who can't operate outside 5 feet and clogs the paint for lebron every fucking drive lol  what are you even arguing here man
"Huh???? Lmao Like many I thought Drummond was the reason they were playing so slow and the lane was clogged. Turns out it maybe wasn’t his fault, but the decision process was correct.  The 29 point margin is irrelevant bc they were trying to close the gap and make it respectable, which they did. There was never garbage time  Fact of the matter is there really isn’t a place in today’s game for Andre Drummond. A big who can’t shoot, can’t defend, and no go-to offensive moves. He’ll struggle to get a job this summer"
Yea but brook is going to look like Andre Drummond out there when the big three get him switched onto them in the perimeter. Like he will give up the lane or open threes
You can lead an Andre Drummond to the paint but you can't make him play defense
"Listen, dont take what Im about to say as being mean towards you, but I dont give a fuck what the media said. The talking media heads are literally just hot take factories hoping something they spew will stick. Anyone with two eyes and a brain should have known Marc Gasol and Andre fucking Drummond were not going to be the reason for a potential Laker repeat. The team is objectively terrible outside of LB and AD (Caruso and KCP are honestly ok role players in my book) .  Also while on the topic of the media, remember at the start of the last season when the talking heads were claiming the Lakers stood no chance against the Clippers because their roster was so awful outside of the two stars, but as soon as the Lakers won it all the narrative immediately switched to, ""of course they won, the lakers are a great team with GOATS like Kyle Kuzma on the roster"".  But I genuinely think last years lakers were better. I think Rondo and Dwight brought something to that team that Scroder and Gasol are just incapable of replicating."
ill give you one andre drummond for one cj mccollum TY
"Playing the 5 against Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, and 10-minute Marc Gasol is a pretty big ask for a PF."
I mean I know what you’re saying but Trezzle literally won Six man last year and is/was a very solid player. Andre Drummond also very solid. Neither fit with Lebron or this team.
"Shoulda just stayed on the Cavs.  LeBron plus the current Cavs core would be a pretty good team, Sexton and Garland can both create their own shot and Jarrett Allen is a better center than Andre Drummond (that's why the Cavs dropped him for JA).  You could even have dumped KLove for AD since they resigned Love after LeBron left."
[Andre Drummond imitating LeBron James as he destroys Jae Crowder is the most hilariously disrespectful thing I’ve ever seen](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/5/28/22458557/andre-drummond-imitating-lebron-james-destroying-jae-crowder-video-hilarious)
Andre DNP Drummond
Lol. Wtf? No way you could have a watched a game in the last 3 seasons and actually be arguing in favor of Andre Drummond. Not to mention a Lakers game since the buyout. Unreal.
"Starter: Le(Insert Word) James Anthony Day-to-Davis Dennis ""The Minus"" Schroeder Andre DNP Drummond Klutch Clown Player  Bench: Kyle Jenner Markuzma Morris Marc Gas-out Wesley Fatthews Nothrees Harrel Ben McNomore Jared DUDley  Goats: Carushow THT"
AD you mean Andre Drummond 😂😂😂
"I, for one, could never have predicted Andre Drummond would be complete ass for the Lakers.   It’s not like anyone bothered to watch Pistons or Cavs games these past few years right lol"
"I haven't watched games 4 and 5. But seriously what the fuck does Andre Drummond do? Was he really here thinking he could've sat on the bench and get a ring off of lebron?  Why was he a DNP when AD was clearly hurt? Shit on kuzma, Schroeder and KCP but at least they tried in this game."
Andre Drummond 0 minutes
Andre Drummond :)
"Andre Drummond is one of the most fraudulent players the league has seen. Sure his boxscore would be better, but I'd bet my left nut the final score would've been worse, pretty hard for LeBron to drive to the rim when Andres standing there counting flies ready to grab another 20 meaningless boards."
Are we seriously pretending like fucking Andre Drummond would've somehow changed a thing?
Because Andre Drummond dancing on the sideline was hilariously disrespectful
Why does Andre Drummond have 0 minutes lmao
andre drummond hasnt played a second. embarrassing as fuck
"Kind of weird hearing Lakers beat writers say things like ""Andre Drummond is part of the Lakers' future, not just a rental"" and then watching him get DNPed in playoff game."
Wondering if Andre ''Part Of Long-Term Future'' Drummond will make an appearance
"Stick Andre Drummond in the lineup &amp; keep Bron &amp; AD out &amp; y'all gonna be asking yourselves: ""Do Bron and AD need to come back before the playoffs?????"" Yes, Andre Drummond is LIKE THAT."
At least Andre Drummond will always have his career highlight of being funny on the bench.
"Poor Andre Drummond, he got paid 14 million by Cleveland to sign with LA for 800K"
poor andre drummond he signed for 800k thinking hes gonna get an EZ ring lol
"Never forget when this sub thought the buyout market was ruining the league because the Lakers and Nets got Lamarcus Aldridge (retired), Andre Drummond (washed), and Blake Griffin (washed)"
Andre Drummond not playing tonight?
lakers just need to put in their all-star andre drummond
"Good thing for you guys is that if the Lakers go past the Suns, Jokic would be cooking Andre Drummond for 15 minutes every gamr."
Turns out AD meant Andre Drummond
"A g-leaguer is currently the Lakers 3rd best player (Caruso). And Clippers fans may feel the same way about Terrance Mann. Basically, I'm saying the Lakers should find more guys like that in the g-league and 2nd round for their team. Damion Jones was better than Andre Drummond for the Lakers and the former was on a 10 day contract."
If Andre Drummond would be Shakespeare character it would be Chris Dudley
"“Bail out card” ...? Fans/media will say a lot of dumb shit that will have no impact on next years team. They could win each game 100-0 and skip will find a fault.  The more important thing to find out is what can they do to improve this roster? Dennis Schroeder seems to be a better regular season player, while rondo filled a role that was better in the post season. Tho rondo had a healthier team that shot better in the bubble. And Dennis wants a 4 year for 100 mil  Dwight Howard barely played in the later rounds, but wasn’t perceived to be an empty stat player like Andre Drummond. I don’t see them resigning him Marc gasol is shot. He makes the offense better but is a chair on defense. Maybe could be a vet for a team, but likely retires imo.  Trez was unplayable last post season and the same continues. A lot of players are picked on in playoffs, and big man seem to fit this category a lot. Bryn Forbes (guard) will likely be dnp/benched against the nets (using this as an example)  Matthews is just a guy at this point. Great defender at Portland, not special since the injury. Decent role player and didn’t need a lot to sign him.  So the question is, who can they get? Maybe sign and trade with Dennis? That would be best case scenario with him. There was talk that Beal didn’t want to move teams because of COVID 19. Beal seemed to be disappointed with the lack of awards he got while in Washington, that he would likely get in LA regardless of winning. Tho you think lebron/Beal/AD would be a title contender if healthy.   There’s rumors that Leonard would go to the heat, but that’s coming from the heat. And no one really gets quotes out of Leonard. But that would take clippers out as being a contender (tho they are down 3-2 in first round), and again make lakers better. Heat getting swept might change his mind if the rumors were true.   Paul George is another option if Leonard does go to the heat. He’s signed for multiple years, and owner might want to blow it up if this doesn’t work out. They would have to rebuild like the nets did tho, and they haven’t finished the building where the clippers will play at either. (Pretty sure on that at least?)  Is there another player they can get that will help lebron but also replace him?  Because that should/needs to be the goal."
Lakers are too busy diamond handsing andre drummond
Serious question: would you rather have Andre Drummond or ivica zubac? Drummond is definitely more talented but zubac plays his role so well
I'd rather have Andre Drummond then Krispy Porzingis at this point
Willie Cauley-Stein just a skinnier Andre Drummond with fewer clothes and even worse BBIQ
Brooks is the guard version of Andre Drummond. Gets decent stats but does not play winning basketball
Andre Drummond
1. Andre Drummond 2. The Big Penguin 3. Happy Feet  In that order
"I saw that video too, turned out to just be Andre Drummond without a shirt on"
"Anthony Davis was part of both teams. I'm talking about the supporting cast.    In the off-season, Lakers fans were treating the swap of Dwight/Javale/Rondo/Green/etc. for Montrezl/Gasol/Schroeder/Mathews/etc. as a big upgrade.  Now, with or without AD, Montrezl was deemed unplayable in the playoffs, Gasol can hardly steal any minutes from Andre ""Butterfingers"" Drummond, and Schroeder can't even score a point in the most important game of his career.  Before insulting someone's intelligence based on their comment, it would help if you had the reading comprehension to actually understand the comment."
Damn. Playing with Andre Drummond has done a number on him.
"Jason Kidd and Andre Drummond, then roll the ball out and collect your 60 wins and media accolades."
After this season is over i don't wanna see Dennis Schroder and Andre Drummond ever again. Get those bums off my team.

"No bro. You’re only looking at the stars. The Lakers have better depth, defense and rebounding than the Nets  The Lakers have 5 guys who have averaged more than 18+ a night. You guys have a 6MOY and the runner up on the same team, Andre Drummond who’s been controversial but usually a 18 and 10 guy (mostly good for rebounding and put backs) and Lebron and AD. No one saying the Lakers have more star power but in terms of overall teams, the Lakers are much more balance. Let’s not forget, before injuries the Lakers were the best in the west by far  What some folk try to do is only look at the talent and try to find a way invalidate KD and the rest of the Nets but in the same breath call out our weaknesses and say bc of those weaknesses the bucks or the Lakers will beat us"
I legit don't understand why we couldn't keep them. Its not like they cost that much and we replace them contract wise with the ghost of Pau Gasol and whatever you want to refer Andre Drummond as.
He also does this amazing thing where he gets the ball in an unfavorable position and then passes it back out without throwing up an awful shot. I think watching Andre Drummond has ruined me.
Dennis Schroeder and Andre Drummond
Jaylen hurt his wrist on a fall - doesn't really have much to do with the short offseason imo. Our FO also just messed up the offseason. They gambled that Schroder would be an upgrade when we really should have just kept Danny and Rondo and we have no shooting or athleticism. And now we have to potentially root for Andre Drummond to become a totally different basketball player? Yea I'm not feeling these moves
Ok Frank now sub Andre Drummond into the game
He's no Andre Drummond
How? Bennett was eventually traded for k love and we ultimately got a championship. I'm still trying to wrap my head around why the Pistons thought it was a good idea to have Josh Smith but wait there's more have Josh Smith play alongside Greg Monroe and Andre drummond.
Down 28?  Time to run Andre Drummond post ups to get back into it
Andre Drummond is such a bum and it’s hilarious lakers fans were pumped about him. I know he’s been in Cleveland and Detroit but watch even one of their games and you know he’s trash
ANDRE DRUMMOND THE BEST LAKER TONIGHT LMAOOOO
"Never forget when Nets fans and Lakers fans tried to convince the world that the buyout market was rigged for the other team and Andre Drummond, Blake Griffin, and DeAndre Jordan were secretly going to return to their primes for whichever team they didn't like"
"What needs to happen to retain Drummond next year:  Taken from: https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2939429-the-big-problem-with-lakers-hopes-to-retain-andre-drummond  Scenario 1  Drummond is willing to re-sign for the taxpayer mid-level exception ($5.9 million), enabling the Lakers to spend freely without a hard cap:  •	⁠Schroder re-signs at a $19 million starting salary •	⁠Harrell returns at $11.1 million •	⁠Caruso and Horton-Tucker re-sign at a combined $15 million starting salary •	⁠Three players at the minimum •	⁠Payroll: ~$168.5 million •	⁠Luxury tax: ~$94.2 million -- discounted by the NBA because of the pandemic to ~$63.1 million •	⁠Total: $231.6 million  In comparison, the team projects to pay out about $140.3 million for the current season, including luxury tax. Asking Buss to accept a $91.3 million increase is unreasonable.  Despite Drummond's (theoretical) willingness to return at a below-market price, cuts elsewhere need to be made:  •	⁠Trade Caldwell-Pope to a team with cap room or a trade exception •	⁠Trade the 2021 first-rounder (after the draft) as an incentive with Caldwell-Pope •	⁠Five players at the minimum •	⁠Payroll: ~$156.6 million •	⁠Luxury tax: ~$44.9 million -- discounted to ~$30.1 million •	⁠Total: $186.7 million  An improvement, but is a $46.4 million jump the answer? If not, the Lakers might have to pass on Schroder, Harrell or perhaps one of Caruso or Horton-Tucker. Drummond may not have any interest in returning at that price, but that doesn't change the Lakers' pressure with hefty luxury taxes.  Scenario 2  Drummond is willing to re-sign for the non-taxpayer mid-level exception ($9.5 million), locking the Lakers into a hard cap:  •	⁠Schroder re-signs at a $19 million starting salary •	⁠Trade Caldwell-Pope and Gasol to a team with cap room or a trade exception •	⁠Trade the 2021 first-rounder •	⁠Harrell leaves as a free agent •	⁠Only one of Horton-Tucker and Caruso re-sign at $6.5 million •	⁠Eight players at the minimum •	⁠Payroll: ~$142.9 million •	⁠Luxury tax: ~9.8 million -- discounted to ~$6.6 million •	⁠Total: $149.5 million  The Lakers keep both Drummond and Schroder. The total payroll (including tax) increases by a very reasonable ~$9.2 million, but Harrell, Gasol and one of Horton-Tucker/Caruso are lost.  Scenario 3  Drummond is willing to re-sign for the non-taxpayer mid-level exception ($9.5 million), locking the Lakers into a hard cap:  •	⁠Schroder leaves as a free agent •	⁠Trade Caldwell-Pope to a team with cap room or a trade exception •	⁠Trade the 2021 first-rounder •	⁠Harrell returns at $11.1 million •	⁠Caruso and Horton-Tucker re-sign at a combined $15 million starting salary •	⁠Six players at the minimum •	⁠Payroll: ~$142.9 million •	⁠Luxury tax: ~9.8 million -- discounted to ~$6.6 million •	⁠Total: $149.5 million  The Lakers keep Drummond, Harrell, Gasol, Horton-Tucker and Caruso. While Schroder, Caldwell-Pope and the pick are gone, the Lakers keep the bulk of their core while managing a reasonable budget."
"What are they supposed to say?     *""We don't see a future with Andre Drummond""*     Then Drummond plays even worse"
 You're missing the whole Finals MVP point that I made. Russell would have at least 8 of those and Wilt would have 2. We use those to give MJ credit but for Russell somehow they wouldn't count? The All-Defense stuff is also useless for comparison considering they started giving it out literally on the last year of Russell's career. So if we had All-Defensive teams and DPOYs in his prime he would have had the opportunity to collect a lot more of those. This is why historical context is so important when blindly comparing accolades.   Scoring and rebounding titles don't mean much to me in terms of legacy because they're based simply on volume. Guys like Bob McAdoo and Adrian Dantley won multiple scoring titles and they're not top 50 guys. DeAndre Jordan and Andre Drummond both have multiple rebounding titles and they're not top 100 guys. Dwight has 5 of those and I think we can both agree he wasn't as great as his numbers.
Nobody show this to Andre Drummond
"You should watch the games, and not just read the boxscores.  Andre Drummond and Marc Gasol have been guarding Ayton, not Davis."
I think Andre Drummond would like a word. Basketball IQ of an average person on the street.
"Yeah, half the NBA will surely be lining up to actually trade for the rights to overpay Andre Drummond..."
Andre Drummond max
He once talked about elbowing a teammate in the head for stealing his rebounds.  https://cavaliersnation.com/2020/05/19/andre-drummond-says-he-used-punch-former-teammate-who-kept-coming-take-his-rebounds/
Report: Andre Drummond is under contract with the Lakers and will continue to be paid by them as they are required to do so until the season ends and he becomes a free agent.  FTFY

"He has good games and bad games like any normal starter does. People still expect all star numbers out of him, but he’d be viewed as a solid center if his name wasn’t Andre Drummond."
"Theres just no excuse for the being so bad at FTs, especially as a ballhandler. If Andre Drummond can get better at FTs Ben Simmons can. His lack utter of improvement on the offensive end since he came in the league is really frustrating. Just look at how much better Embiid has gotten over the past couple years compared to stagnant ass Simmons."
"I remember seeing these same videos with, Andre Drummond and Dwight Howard lol."
Andre Drummond is a walking double double. He has had a good career in the nba. Stating that he is “bad at basketball” is extremely ignorant. Literally have already stated all of this
Andre Drummond -&gt; Andre Tambourine'nd
I always thought Ben Simmons and Andre Drummond looked similar
"That's fair, but he's a one-way role player.  I'm talking about guys like Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond."
"As someone that's had the pleasure of watching many Pistons and Cavs games, it's hard to overstate just how bad Andre Drummond is."
Am I allowed to just subtract Andre Drummond instead
I’d trade Andre Drummond for a used condom
Andre Drummond has entered and left the chat
"People really GAF about DA not getting 20/20?  Jesus, look at Andre Drummond. He's made a career of 20/20s and he's still straight garbage."
Ayton is exactly who Andre Drummond thinks Andre Drummond is lmao
"Trade em for people who won't leave you hanging. As a totally unbiased party, may I suggest one Dennis Schroder and Andre Drummond?"
He's no Andre Drummond...
"Before the Blake trade, this article came out.  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/12/1/16722538/detroit-pistons-andre-drummond  Reason number 635348 why you shouldn't go too hard on early season results."
Andre Drummond has scored 30+ points 6 times after age 36?!
Even for the minimum there are so many centers who are better than him. Damian Jones looked like a god on the Lakers shots 94% FG with them in his short stint while on a 10 day. Andre Drummond shot 53% FG on the same type of shots.
Deandre Ayton is who Andre Drummond thinks he is.
My counter point: Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond makes Dennis Schroeder look smart
"you can make that argument about every single counting stat though  scoring - took too many shots, chucked your team out the game  offensive rebounds - andre drummond ass dudes, only getting boards cuz you missed a gimme  defensive rebounds - russell westbrook getting free boards from steven adams doing all the work  steals - gambling instead of playing fundamentally sound defense  blocks - goaltending ass dudes like hassan whiteside"
yeah for the price you paid andre drummond was a sweet deal actually
"""And I still got my entree comin, young baller out Connecticut like Andre Drummond"""
"I’m so happy this dumbass made the worst possible move and picked the lakers seriously showed the world how low his IQ is. They already had Anthony Davis, Montrez Harrell, Marc Gasol, Kyle Kuzma, Markief Morris and despite not being a big man Lebron James needs to get into the paint to be effective. Andre the certified idiot thought the lakers would just drop everything and let him play over all these veterans who have developed chemistry with the team all season long. The part that makes it even more dumb is how many other contending teams were in need for a rebounding center like Drummond but he just seriously has no brain up there . You did this to yourself now go sulk in the corner and cry about it all off season long before signing a 1 year deal with the Houston rockets ya bum"
Hakeem was just Andre Drummond with a step through move
Andre iguodola is a much better center than Andre Drummond
all my homies hate Andre drummond
"No it was about the 2014 Pistons front court of Josh Smith, Greg Monroe, and Andre Drummond"
ANDRE DRUMMOND.
You either are andre Drummond or you need to relax lmao
"Can't forget about the greatest Lakers center acquired through buyout of all time, Andre Drummond."
andre drummond
"D'angelo Russell pick any year, even his make-a-wish all star season with the Nets  Andre Drummond entire career  Whiteside in portland  Jerami grant this year  Sexton this year"
Andre Drummond?
Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond 2012-2021
"well i wouldnt clutch my pearls over people assuming you meant karl malone, karl was the more famous of the two malones. And honestly I cant really say that your argument for him being top ten is valid. The man was pretty much a more elite version of andre drummond in his prime or kevin love without his range. Actually now that i think about it, imagine if at 3 separate points, andre drummond basically pulled a westbrook and won 3 mvps by being a dominant big that grabbed all the offensive rebounds on subpar teams and scored due to his domination around the basket. Is that really worth a top ten slot? if russ wins a couple more mvps would he be considered top ten?  Malone is def better than kd in that historical context, but to really start pushing the likes of shaq and kobe out of the top 10 to put moses in isnt really legitimate"
"Obligatory ""*insert player name* is just *insert age*"".  Andre Drummond is just 27! He's still got time to develop😅"
"The sad thing is that both stories are way more interesting that ""Lebron drags Andre Drummond to the finals"" or ""Yet another super team going for a chip""."
"I don't even think his stats would be that different from his peak. In a league where Andre Drummond net you 15 Reb a game, I don't think a 40/20 season from Wilt would be out of the question"
"Steph Curry shoots around 46% from 15-ish feet (same distance as a free throw). The 2nd worst free throw shooter in history (with at least 1200 attempts) is Andre Drummond, who shoots 47%. Even he shoots free throws better than Steph hits \~15 foot jumpers.  If all but the single worst free throw shooter in history shoot standing free throws better than Steph Curry shoots when he jumps, then there aren't really people who shoot better when they jump."
"Keep you head down rook, keep grinding and one day you can be as good as Andre Drummond"
And Andre Drummond is the Penguin.
Bruh if you read I said his body which is 6’11 240 lbs and even then there were athletic bigs with no where near the ball handling coordination or playmaking that he offers like Javale Mcgee Deandre Jordan Andre Drummond who are all 7ft and athletic

"""Is it tampering if it's done during the Olympics? Do you guys think any rule could be implemented to prevent already stacked teams from signing premium buyout candidates for pennies on the dollar?""  One, friends are going to talk. NBA would have to be friendship if they didn't want players talking.  Two, ""premium buyout candidates"" - as a phrase - doesn't really make a lot of sense. Players are only buyout candidates when their talent is so far removed from their past play/hype/reputation that the team would rather pay the guy to *not* play for them than to play for them.   Now, I would like to see the buyout deadline be at the same time as the trade deadline. Not to do something like stopping the Lakers from signing a guy like all-time great Andre Drummond (18 points in the Lakers final four playoff games this year,) but to stop teams from doing everything they can to avoid paying a player."
"&gt;Cousins was just as good offensively and better on defense  lmfao. How in the fuck was he just as good offensively? Efficiency not in the same universe even as Jokic's least efficient season, passing not comparable, double the turnovers. Pick any advanced stat as well, even rookie Jokic blows any Cousins season out of the water (you know, when he played with great players like Mudiay and Jameer Nelson's corpse). Dude's competition for All-NBA teams were Deandre Jordan, Andre Drummond and Marc Gasol and he has a total of two all-nba teams and you're claiming he'd be an MVP candidate. Even when he was ""the best center in the league"", half the people would've rather had Marc Gasol because he was actually useful at things other than chucking shots"
First time seeing Top 10 and Andre Drummond in the same post.
"All of that is true, but DMC was soooo much better than Andre Drummond or Whiteside"
"andre drummond, hassan whiteside are empty stat players imo"
Well that would make sense because he has gone up against Andre Drummond and zubac
"Lol he made the all star game two times in nine years ,i guess that makes Andre Drummond a max player too, your requirements are too loose   That's what I'm talking about , people don't want to think about this seriously, being on a max contract is about leverage, not whether you're a max player   The fact that there are many other players who also have a max contract but aren't at the level of Giannis or Steph proves that point"
For a single season. And injuries. You really think he has no chance of being as good as Brook Lopez or Andre Drummond?
A player named Andre Drummond is an unbelievable rebounder and under the basket guy but doesn’t fit on most teams’ offense
"Who has he played against tho? The shell of Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, and zubac"
"He struggled with injuries on and off and was (at least I remember him being) inefficient. Similar situation with Andre Drummond, you look at the stats and everyone outside of DET thinks you have an elite player except when you watch him play it looked different. He was huge on trying to takeover a game solo. Sometimes it worked, most of the time it didn't."
"Andre ""stone hands"" Drummond"
Hard pill to swallow when you trade away Brook and end up with Andre Drummond and an ancient Marc Gasol as your centers. I swear I'm suprised every time I remember Andre is in his twenties and not forty.
the andre drummond special
point guard Andre Drummond
"&gt; You had a 36-year-old lebron james average 23/7/8?  Exactly my point...  &gt;You had ""the best offseason acquisitions"" in Dennis Schroder, Marc Gasol, Andre Drummond, and Wesley Matthews?  Drummond was a mid-season acquisition.   &gt;But a GOOD coach and a GOOD leader would rally the troops to step up. Caruso, THT, Schroder, for all the praise they were getting? They were TRASH. And Lebron gave up on his team once his co-star went out.  What praise were Caruso and THT getting? LeBron “gave up” because his ankle gave up."

just like andre benched for game 5 drummond
"If I’m the Lakers, would I give Andre Drummond and a multitude of players and a pick for Joel Embiid? Hell yes I would  *Where is my check ESPN?*"
&gt; there were better options available and they took andre drummond and held onto THT  OR you misunderstood what i was trying to say
"i mean they chose to make those decisions, there were better options available and they took andre drummond and held onto THT"
It sounds vaguely like Detroit and Cleveland fans warning us about Andre Drummond and how wrong we were to believe he could be a productive player even in a limited role.
Just picture trying to build your team around Andre Drummond for 8 years
"Lakers should resign Andre Drummond.   “Didn’t he play really badly and screw over your team?!”  Yes. But I have good hopes for him next season. I’m not expecting him to be as impactful as his box scores would hope you to believe, just have him as 1: A body to put on the opposing team’s big so Davis doesn’t get fatigued, and 2, a rim runner and rebounder.  Drummond has been the focal point of his team through most of his career because of how shitty they were, so drawing up offensive plays for him wouldn’t work out. He’s a role player, and the reason why he didn’t work out with us is because he had no time to work with LeBron. Give him a full season on a good team, I think he’ll be playing his role well."
"The ""Andre Drummond school of missing multiple put-backs and eventually getting the bucket after 3-5 offensive rebounds"" :D"
Yeah the Tony Snell currently recieving DNP’s in the playoffs is a much more impactful player than Andre Drummond. Jesus this sub.
"And Tony Snell is a much more positively impactful player than Andre Drummond at this point, so that makes sense."
"A shorter yet stronger version of Giannis with a better jumpshot and rebounding ability yet lacks Giannis defensive acumen. In this league where numbers are more inflated than ever he could hover around almost Giannis numbers like 28ppg and average about the same rebounding numbers as a prime Kevin Love or Andre Drummond - 15rpg easy. He also has one of the best true shooting percentages ever for a guy not giving a damn about advanced analytics. In this era of advanced analytics, if he does give a shit - he'll probably be the NBA's most efficient scorer with Steph."
"In some years, yeah.  But in other years we acquired bad contracts for an extra draft pick or traded for ""win now"" players in Luol Deng, Spencer Hawes, Jarrett Jack, Andre Drummond, etc.  We also re-signed Love and Varejao to overpriced contracts while rebuilding lol."
"So you went from saying you could see cavs players get visibly upset at him to you read some silly report where opposing players taunt them during games by saying, ""you know he’s not going to pass you the ball""?  Let me ask you something about this incredibly well sourced article. Do you believe multiple players- on different teams mind you- have all come to cavs games and mocked cavs players because sexton dominates the ball? Like, it's so obvious that sexton dominates the ball (despite being an off ball sg playing next to a PG), that multiple teams have had players that have all picked up on that and then mocked the cavs other players? You think that's realistic? And on top of that, you think this is only true of the cavs? Teams with west brook or harden or other players who dominate the ball more... people don't mock those teams similarly?  I mean the story, if read literally, stretches all credulity. On top of that you are welcome to look at the tracking stats and it shows hes a willing passer. And that's despite his team having one of the worst shooting surrounding casts in the league. Like do you want him passing to larry nance for a 3? What about Jarrett Allen? Or Andre Drummond? Or Okoro? I mean he's surrounded with guys who cannot hit shots and you think he's a ball hog for not passing to them more?  Everything about this is fucking stupid click bait bullshit."
"For all his faults, Andre Drummond is a phenomenal rebounder from catching bricks thrown by Josh Smith as a youngster."
"I never said he should only play C, I just dislike the idea of him playing PF to Andre Drummond."
Hes like the dudes in 2k when you have every star player that's ever played out there and here is a andre Drummond being like I want 80mill and you are like bruh i can have Kevin Garnett or chris Bosh hell even Pau gasol with that money
"Dsmn you right though.  The Lakers don't have Marc gasol or andre Drummond.  Dont remember any big men on the nuggets, literally 0 centers on that team and definitley not one that could win an MVP  And zubac has played only like 60% of his teams  minutes in all but 1 game this series.  Incredible how all these teams have no people above 6 ft 8.  How did they ever make the playoffs with those rosters."
"Ah yes detroit, home of growning young elite talents such as Andre Drummond"
Taking a charge is weak and not real defense. Unless the offensive player uses his arm to push off or lowers his shoulder like a running back.   Tired of seeing people drive to the basket only to have some other defender step in front of him to get the offensive foul. It's especially weak when someone like Andre Drummond takes a charge on Trae Young.  Man up and play defense.
never forget Andre Drummond All-NBA
pistons putting blake griffin w andre drummond and reggie jackson. reggie jackson never played a healthy season w the pistons after 2016 why would svg do us bold like that and put blake next to him and andre.
"No greater NBA tradition than players turning up once they leave DET. Except for Andre Drummond, not even he could get the post-DET bump."
"See: Hassan Whiteside, Jabari Parker, Andrew Wiggins until this year, Andre Drummond etc."
Definitely Andre Drummond. He’ll legit miss two layups rebound his own shot twice and I feel like I see him do this every game. He gets most of his rebounds in the first quarter which is basically an extended shoot around in the nba. He has very little impact on wins and defensively is not much of a rim protector despite averaging over a block per game he’s not a good defender.
only like Andre Drummond &amp; Hassan
"Andre Drummond, Hassan Whiteside, Enes Kanter"
Andre Drummond
"Literally the worst argument I’ve ever heard.  The Nuggets’ starting backcourt was Facu Campazzo and Austin Rivers..   You’re forgetting Andre Drummond was Ayton’s matchup, not AD. And AD dominated btw.  No shit he’s dominating against Nic Batum and Morris (on one leg)..."
Still not enough; absolutely no reason Andre Drummond should've gotten 20 minutes a night against the Suns.
Reggie Jackson and Andre Drummond
"Calling a move that works awful is kind of controversial. Shaq literally had 3-4 moves yet was dominating for years.  Awful means not effective, he is not Andre Drummond out there playing both ugly and awful. His half court is merely ugly. His full court game though is some of the most beautiful it's very easy to the eyes if you ever see it in person (you'd know what I mean)."
He's like Andre Drummond if Drummond didn't completely suck ass
"In 2016 when my grandma coulda made 3rd team over Andre Drummond, yeah."
"Andre Drummond is not DeAndre Ayton hahaha. The only people who talked themselves into Drummomd being anything more than a rebounder were Lakers fans, and that optimism lasted about 3 games.  When the pistons gave him that fat contract I think 2/3 of the league cringed. Pistons talked themselves into ""well I guess we gotta pay him""."
Either Andre Drummond or Kyle Kuzma   /s
Top 5? Andre Drummond finna look like Shaq in China
It would be nice if he could teach Andre Drummond how to bounce a ball and not miss simple layups
He's been like one of their best defenders this year lol. LeBron and AD missed so many games due to injuries. And yet they still ended up with the best ranked defense while featuring the last remains of Marc Gasol and the prehistoric dinosaur no one is scared of in Andre Drummond.  There isn't that many 2nd rounders that can end up better than Kyle Kuzma lol.
https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/andre-drummond-doesnt-know-why-hes-called-big-penguin-a-deep-dive-into-the-nbas-most-bizarre-nickname/   :/
LeBron is gonna fold Andre Drummond up like a paper airplane and throw him back to Cleveland.
"Our biggest weakness was Andre Drummond and he is a big, so it is correct to say that a big was our biggest weakness."
Everybody knows 2k ratings are the most accurate. That’s why Andre Drummond and Ayton are similar skill levels
But what about Andre Drummond?
You’re giving me overpaying Andre Drummond vibes rn
"&gt;Be on an All-NBA team  Oh I think this has to be Andre Drummond in 2011   &gt;Be an All-Star Starter  Kobe in 2016 did a big part in making sure the Lakers got Ingram, was one of the worst players in the NBA that year went beyond just not playing.   &gt;Average at least 20 Points per Game  Mike James!  &gt;Be on an All-Defense Team  oh no"
The same with andre drummond. 🥴🥴
"Man, I think we need a big man or two so bad that I ended up watching Shaq Olympic highlights. I wish we had, oh I dunno, Andre Drummond on this team.. which big man would you bring?"
he then let howard walk and got gasol schroeder harrell and andre drummond lol. lets not act like he cant do no wrong here. He definitely knows how the cap works but it kinda feels like hes just picking up players randomly without thinking about how the team fit. Even the championship team fit was kinda iffy but fortunately it worked out mainly due to Rondo and KCP great plays in the playoff.
Trash Andre Drummond
"Bad lakers, Andre Drummond should be your offensive centerfold and team leader. Give him the $40 mill he deserves"
"Dennis Schroder, Kyle Kuzma, and Andre Drummond"
Andre Drummond and I have the exact same form when we run and that is not a compliment.
"McLemore is a shooter.  (and a mid season pickup)  Lakers made the decision to get name talent and were hard capped the season. Decided to bring back a couple of players additionally from the ring team (Kieff, Dudley)  That hard cap meant there was only enough room for 1-2 pro rated pickups later. And they had to prioritize center with Andre Drummond  It's also that many of the players were reasonable  shooters who were red hot during the ring run but became cold last year.  (Prime example : KCP. Also : Kuz, Kieff, Karuso etc. Even Schroeder was an average shooter who grew cold)  Regardless, that team wasn't doing anything with injuries.  AD mainly but also LBJ &amp; KCP"
The corpse of Marc Gasol to go with former NBA All Star Andre Drummond.  They can't lose.
"the raptors do not have a history of strong drafting. Just looking at lottery picks we have  3 in 2003: Chris Bosh. Great pick, made the raptors relevant and undoubtedly go the ball rolling for the current success they have now.  4 in 2004: Rafael Araujo. Bust. Andre Igoudala was the very next pick.  7 in 2005: Charlie Villanueva, hard to call him a bust, but he certainly was never more than an OK starter. Danny Granger was on the board and would've been better.   1 in 2006: Andrea Bargnani. Holy shit was Bargnani bad. player 7 years but but only average 15/ppg with awful rebounding and defence for a big man. LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay and Brandon Roy were right there.   17 in 2008: Not a lottery pick but we took Roy Hibbert and flipped him for Jermaine O'Neal who barely lasted a season and traded to Miami for Marion and Moon who did nothing.   9 in 2009: DeMar Derozan. ok, a good pick, no fault here and this pick basically one the NBA Final so kudos.   12 in 2010: Ed Davis. not a great pick, never really cracked 10ppg and ended up being traded for Rudy Gay. Could've picked Patrick Patterson who was a nice piece for the Raptors later on.   5 in 2011: Valanciunas was not a bad pick, he developed in a good player, but we could've taken Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, or Kemba Walker or Jimmy Butler.   8 in 2012: Terrence Ross. dude had some highlight reel plays but wasn't ever a world beater. Andre Drummond was the next pick and although taking him with Jonas wouldn't have been the right move, it is pretty obvious who the better player is.   12 in 2013: Traded for Lowry. great trade and in a terrible draft class it made sense. We could've taken Giannis, but no fault Lowry is an all-time Raptor.   HM to 2014 and 2015 and #20s Bruno Caboclo and Delon Wright, a developmental player who never developed. Could've taken Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, or Bogdanovic. Wright was picked over Bobby Portis and Montrezl Harrell.  We've blown 5 (arguably 6 or 7) of the 9 lottery picks we've had, 2 pretty spectacularly. Although the last few years have been good, historically when we draft top 5, we don't draft well."
"Jeff Teague, Iguodala, Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan and Andre Drummond. All-star lineup."
Andre Drummond?
"I want to point out what the absolute max the Lakers can pay some of these guys would be:  * Wes Matthews - $4,347,600 (using non Bird rights)  * Markieff Morris - $10 million (using early Bird rights)  * Andre Drummond - $5.9 million (using MLE)  * Ben McLemore - vet minimum  * Dennis Schroder - 5 year max starting at 30% of the cap using full Bird rights  * Alex Caruso - 5 year max starting at 25% of the cap using full Bird rights  * Talen Horton-Tucker - full MLE (Arenas limited restricted free agent using early Bird rights)  These guys won't all get the max the Lakers can pay them, of course, but this is how they can fill out the rest of their roster even if they have LeBron, AD and Westbrook."
"This offseason we've got Terry Rozier, Lonzo Ball, Damian Lillard, Ben Simmons, Kawhi Leonard, Kyle Lowry, Dennis Schroder, Tim Hardaway Jr., and Andre Drummond I'm hyped"
"Rob “let’s surround LeBron with Michael Beasley, Javale McGee, Lance Stephenson, and Rajon Rondo” Pelinka. Rob “trade Ivica Zubac for Mike Muscala” Pelinka. Rob “use full MLE on Montrezl Harrell then get Andre Drummond and promise him a starting spot” Pelinka.  I remember when Laker fans were crying about him not getting GM of the year in 2020. Please. He signed LeBron who goes wherever he wants, and traded what was probably too much for an All-NBA player who said he only would go to the Lakers and refused to play otherwise.  What’s he thinking with this move? IDK, circus music?"
Russell Westbrook Lebron James and Andre Drummond   Spacing is disgusting af
"I don't think you can beat that Detroit Pistons team with a front court of Josh Smith, Greg Monroe, and Andre Drummond."
Joe Harris and Andre Drummond in that plane too
Buddy is going to be like Andre Drummond to the Lakers where when he's on a real team in a spotlight theyll realize all these dumb things he does that annoy you and how he's the opposite of someone you would ever want to rely on in higher level playoff series. People have just gotten to the point theyve overcorrected on importance of shooting
&gt;He would not have made 3 all star teams in a row if he was closer to 50 than 25.  Andre Drummond has made 2 all-star teams
Andre Drummond and Blake Griffin were more important than Kennard a year ago. And if you’re talking about the best prospect than Sekou Doumbouya and Bruce Brown were better assets I’d say.
The Andre Drummond one actually made me laugh out loud.
"Blake Griffin, Andre Drummond"
"KCP was 20 when he was drafted, he even played 2 years in college for Georgia  What if I told you KCP is 6 months older than Andre Drummond lmao"
1. Co-designing a pair of basketball sneakers with Andre Drummond that he will wear in-game next season   2. Tickets for two to that game   3. Flight and hotel accommodations (for two) for that evening   4. Take home the game worn co-designed sneakers that Andre Drummond will autograph after the game and hand deliver to the purchaser of this NFT  5. Digital high resolution copy of The Showtime NFT
"Somewhere in LA, Andre Drummond just looked up"
andre drummond and dennis schroder
Andre drummond is actually mentally challenged if u guys didnt know. Makes perfect sense
"Yeah Kd's volume has gone up by a couple, but his % has stayed the same. He was always an elite 3 point shooter. Kobe was not.  For every Brook Lopez there are a 100 Andre Drummonds. Drummond was drafted several years after Lopez too. Your game is your game."
"I am not joking with you at all when I say this. You can go look at my post/comment history when I’ve brought it up a few times.  I have a friend that’s a normally very knowledgeable guy about the NBA albeit he likes to be a hot take artist sometimes.   He tried saying Andre Drummond was better than Rudy Gobert. I was honestly floored at such a terrible take, but he has doubled down so many times."
Andre Drummond smashed Jennette McCurdy with his fat cock
Wym OP is Andre Drummond ensuring the price goes up
"actually since it’s the andre drummond version, it requires you to make the incorrect bid 3 times, but then finally get it right on the 4th time just by randomly hitting your keyboard"
We'll over 400 now. OP confirmed to be Andre Drummond.
The bid is also for:  1. Co-designing a pair of basketball sneakers with Andre Drummond that he will wear in-game next season    2. Tickets for two to that game    3. Flight and hotel accommodations (for two) for that evening    4. Take home the game worn co-designed sneakers that Andre Drummond will autograph after the game and hand deliver to the purchaser of this NFT  How is the highest bid only 8 bucks?
Fucked around and met Andre Drummond no worse fate than that
Why did he think anyone cares about making a shoe with him? Who is he? Why did he think this was a good idea? He knows he's Andre Drummond right not LeBron or Steph
"&gt; What is the functionality of NFTs? Is it that people find them cool/collectible?  That is the first and foremost idea behind them. It's just ""something cool"" that I can own digitally and that it is verifiable that YOU are the owner of it. Almost every NFT project just started off like that, just a picture of ""something cool"" with slightly different attributes between each of them. Then all the additional features got built to the blockchain later. For TopShot, the concept of them being purchased through packs so you don't know the Moments you'll be opening or the serial number you'll get (a #1/499 fetches a lot more than say #345/499) was cool and not really done in the NFT space.  Same goes for the promotional opportunities, those were added on later. Right now there's a  promo going on with some rapper that if you collect x Moments, you'll get a chance to receive some signatures or something like that.  Some other features are ""collect all these Bucks Moments and get this rare Giannis moment, only available through these challenges."" That's something that's not really done in the physical world.  &gt;  For instance, the Andre Drummond NFT in the other post, what is the value/functionality of the actual NFT itself?  This Andre Drummond NFT is trash. It's essentially just a ticket stub saying that you got all these things. You could technically sell it afterwards, but nobody gives a shit about the receipt. His camp is just jumping on the NFT bandwagon.  &gt; Is their value driven by the potential to receive other tangible or intagible goods and in that sense are they just a less-consistent currency?  The value is initially driven by scarcity. We know for a fact that there will never be another Moment minted of Giannis dropping 50 points for the Finals game, only 99 ever made. People decide what they think the value is based on that. Any potential opportunities for other tangible/intangible stuff is just extra.  I wouldn't consider them currency. A dollar's value is the same as another dollar's value. No two moments are the same, even if they are from the same play. They all have unique attributes (serial numbers) that make them each have different intrinsic values."
Andre Drummond go train with Hakeem Olajuwon this summer please  Lebron can set you up
"I'm curious about NFTs and would like to learn more because, to be honest, I don't really understand them.  Dollars, like you mention, do not inherently hold value but have value because we collectively ascribe it to them. However, dollars do have a functionality in providing a fairly consistent unit for trading.   What is the functionality of NFTs? Is it that people find them cool/collectible? Is it more aimed at, as you said, possible promotional opportunities? What functionality does the NFT version of a video/gif offer beyond the identical non-NFT version?   For instance, the Andre Drummond NFT in the other post, what is the value/functionality of the actual NFT itself? Are you not essentially just bidding on the opportunity to design a shoe with Drummond and attend a game? What is the NFT beyond a memento?   Or in your example, is owning the NFTs not just a by-product of trying to get court side Knicks tickets? Is their value driven by the potential to receive other tangible or intagible goods and in that sense are they just a less-consistent currency?"
"A quick search for andre drummond will show posts with the same amount you listed lmao, one I saw was on a page named NBA Buzz"
"Lil Wayne name dropped him in a song in 2018, so he's got one fan out there  &gt; Goin' hard in the paint, Andre Drummond Headhuntin'"
&gt;Never showing up to hang out with Andre Drummond and going to do something cliche and touristy in ~~LA~~ Charlotte instead: Priceless
"&gt;""Why would I want to help them win a title? They’re not doing anything for me. I’m at risk. I have a lot of risk here. I got my family to feed""  Andre ""Latrell"" Drummond"
A Japanese chick I was talking at one point was a fan of Andre Drummond. Had to double check and make sure. Still have no idea why
But then you gotta watch out when the buyer comes looking for you afterwards because you tricked them into watching Andre Drummond play basketball (or at least try to). The fake mustaches and Groucho glasses you buy will cut into your $15.
"I'm not calling NFTs a currency.   What Im saying speaks more towards:  Andre Drummond: ""Hey, this thing is worth $50,000""  Everyone: ""That's a no from me dawg"""
"The correlation between people that liked Andre Drummond and people that actually watched Andre Drummond is 0. Pistons fans have been saying for years how he doesn't add anything but nobody believes them, because no one really watches the Pistons. His box score looks nice, but that is it."
Flight and hotel: $8  Game tickets: Free  Never showing up to hang out with Andre Drummond and going to do something cliche and touristy in LA instead: Priceless
"There was this basketball news page I followed on Instagram and there was this guy that would always relate whatever the post was about back to Drummond  For example if it was a highlight of someone doing a 360 Tomahawk, he would comment “The 🐐 Andre Drummond could do that in his sleep”"
"if Andre Drummond signed and mailed you actual counterfeit sneakers, they'd probably end up with *more value* than regular signed drummond sneakers, just for the hilarious and unique novelty factor ahaha"
Three weeks ago Andre Drummond announced his free agency which included a request for $20 million a year that included the opportunity to watch Drummond miss wide-open layups. Currently the highest bid is $7.57
Which one do you think he enjoyed more? The burrito or spending time with Andre Drummond?
It includes tickets but you have to watch Andre Drummond play
"Damn, Andre Drummond harassed you on Instagram?"
I shit you not I was harassed by an Andre Drummond fan on Instagram in a post about the wnba
"Sure, but it obviously matters who those people are. Being backed by the US government holds a lot more value than being backed by Andre Drummond."
&gt;	The Showtime NFT will include;   &gt;	1.	Co-designing a pair of basketball sneakers with Andre Drummond that he will wear in-game next season   &gt;	2.	Tickets for two to that game   &gt;	3.	Flight and hotel accommodations (for two) for that evening   &gt;	4.	Take home the game worn co-designed sneakers that Andre Drummond will autograph after the game and hand deliver to the purchaser of this NFT  &gt;	5.	Digital high resolution copy of The Showtime NFT   Even for just the hotel and game tickets it might be worth a bid lol.
And the tickets plus plane flight to see anybody not named Andre Drummond play basketball should be more than worth $7 as well
Turns out I’m Andre Drummond Astro turfing my own NFTs
I have never seen an Andre Drummond fan tbh.
Imagine paying money to watch Andre Drummond brick free throws
"&gt;So having a legitimate post presence who can collapse the d to kick out to wide open shooters, score some buckets around the rim  That's not Andre Drummond."
Seems like it was actually 17 points. Oh Andre Drummond
1.4 is not almost 2 lol. And Andre Drummond averaged 1.5bpg for his career. Those aren’t impressive block numbers.   Allen is a solid center. Capela is a clear tier better and Allen is seeking more money than Capela. He’s not some huge difference maker right now to warrant that pay.
"Vastly? What was the level of competition? How many teams were in the league? Andre Drummond can rebound pretty well too, but both him and russell nowhere close to lebron. and no I am not saying drummond is better than russell"
"It's not pretty simple when you dismiss net rating and ask for record while also trying to point out flaws with looking at record.  &gt; The cavs were also a somewhat winning team with Andre Drummond too I guess he was a winning player too...  Really not sure what this is supposed to mean at all. Again, not sure why you want to just ignore net rating to make these sort of statements.  [In the games Drummond played](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612739&amp;Season=2020-21,2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=203083&amp;OnlyCommonGames=true), the Cavs were 7.63 points/100 possessions better with him off the court."
Was garland in for those guys or not lot that's pretty simple and what's the record  The cavs were also a somewhat winning team with Andre Drummond too I guess he was a winning player too...
"So I didn't heed to country boundaries, which is why Montrealers like Dort, Chris Boucher &amp; Karim Mané are on the Celtics, since Montreal is closer to Boston than to Toronto as the crow flies. The only players I manually sent to teams were Andre Drummond &amp; Devin Booker, as they were crossing large bodies of water."
Roster was way worse than the year before. They were running plays for Andre fucking Drummond.
"&gt;But would he have 11 All-NBA first teams if he was competing against international guys of Jokic, Giannis, and Embiid's stature every year?  If guys like Randle, Siakam and Draymond can make 2nd team All-NBA in today's league, I'm sure Malone could make more than a few 1st teams.  Embiid made 2nd team while missing 20+ games, because of how weak big men are in this era. Heck, Andre Drummond made an All-NBA team in this era."
Andre Drummond and Myles Turner. Say what you want about Drummond but no one is out rebounding him. Turner's a top tier shot blocker.
Just be glad they're offering basketball players instead of Andre Drummond.
Led by Alex Caruso and Andre Drummond
"&gt; Who is it? Drummond? Ayton? Bam?  Just for future reference, Andre Drummond is not good at basketball.  I'm just letting you know so you don't ever say this in real life."
Andre Drummond
People have known this for a long time there's a reason he gets so much criticism he's the Andre Drummond of point guards.
USA in a bit of trouble when you start thinking Andre Drummond or Deandre Jordan would help this team out.
"Come on, we don't need more Andre Drummond and D'Angelo Russel All Stars."
"How I started really getting into NBA was following college stars into their NBA career and expanding my taste from there.   For you, along with the other suggestions, I would say to pick a player to follow. I don't know what kind of player would appeal to you but I can give some recommendations.  (I am going to preface this by saying most players I list are on the younger side so you can build  a fan relationship without the dread of impending retirement)   * Luka Doncic - Dallas Mavericks - Young guard who is lighting up the NBA. Very likeable personality and fun to watch. Not as flashy as others but still very entertaining to watch. [Luka Highlights](https://youtu.be/aJBl7RMDlVo) * Trae Young - Atlanta Hawks - Another young guard that is coming into his own. Trash talker, can be flashy on the court, absolutely awesome to watch him play and interact with the fans. [Trae Young Highlights](https://youtu.be/l4Cwaj351aM)[Trae Young v New York Knicks Fans](https://youtu.be/gXPhb1HthNk) * Zion Williamson - New Orleans Pelicans - Freak. He is just an athletic Freak my guy. If he can stay healthy, he is a dominant force and plays the game physically. [Zion Highlights](https://youtu.be/j3RPnA4pvKw) * Joel Embiid - Philadelphia 76ers - Center. Big and strong dude that plays a whole lot of Defense. Sort of troll sometimes, especially if someone calls him out. ex: Andre Drummond [Joel Highlights](https://youtu.be/hxuiQrvKETs)  The NBA is stacked with talent and the youth of the league is fantastic. If you are wanting a current great that I didnt list, you cannot go wrong with Giannis, Lebron, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, or a multitude of others.   If you want to go the opposite route and choose a team first, I would recommend choosing the closest franchise to yourself. It is a whole other experience being able to attend the home games from time to time. If that's not your jam, then I would choose one of the ""younger"" teams so you can watch them grow and compete. Ex: Memphis Grizzlies, Oklahoma City Thunder, New Orleans Pelicans.   If you do not want to cement your choice on team or player, watch the games, highlights, play the video games, get involved somehow to give yourself an interest. I would highly recommend checking out the highlights of some of the greats from the past generations and comparing them to todays game.   Whatever you decide to do, don't take the toxicity you receive from others too seriously. There is no problem with throwing your interest into a popular player or cheering for the Lakers, if that is what you like. Basketball is game and being a fan is about enjoying the product. Remember that."
They're all above average shooters that shot lower in playoffs (like most players do;  everybody's covered tighter and is more fatigued).    Trot out Westbrook and Andre Drummond and see what happens to spacing lol.
"Probably not going to be many open lanes with Andre Drummond, AD, LeBron and KCP on the court I imagine."
we know andre drummond would struggle bro
"People don't understand that about 6 years ago, the entire hopes of the franchise rested on Andre Drummond and Greg Monroe. It's so much better now."
"Andre Drummond may not be that great a shooter around the rim, but will make sure to get 4 offensive rebounds until he gets the job done. That's hustle, right there."
"Could you imagine Dennis Schroeder, Kyle Kuma and Andre Drummond on the same team they all say there super stars my god it would be a dynasty.."
"Yeah there times you see Rob and it kind of reminds like 2010 Serge Ibaka defensively. Some poss are just like the wild wild west or something, total chaos, will scram around chase off somebody from the 3 point line, switch well for 5 seconds and then just blow a rotation in the end to screw everything up. Help responsibility mistakes and awareness usually get better with time but to what degree it's always just a guess. Still will see a fair number of these Andre Drummond types who keep doing the bonehead mistakes even in yr 9 and never fully figure it out.   He has a fair number of bad habits defensively that gotta be addressed while its still early but I do think he'll end up being a good defender, and theyll be real reliant on him figuring out alot of this stuff on the fly soon the next 1-2 yrs. What scheme Udoka runs big part of it also, Stevens defense was built around rim protection being more of a team oriented concept than reliant on one guy"
Andre Drummond. Based on this sub you would think he’s the worst player in the league. I’m here to tell you he’s not. As a Thunder fan I can tell you there are far worse players than Drummond.
"I'll never forget when the Pistons ran a [Josh Smith, Greg Monroe, and Andre Drummond frontcourt](https://i.imgur.com/wHv2qRm.jpeg) for an entire season."
"We had Andre Drummond on our roster, so Bucks"
Yes they can. They literally gave away Damian Jones on a 10 day contract for Andre Drummond even though the former is the better player. they just need to pick the right guys like they did in 2020.
"Because AD and LeBron were both injured and not dominant paint scorers? Did you miss the series or something? You literally had 2 players shoot at league average in the playoffs: Gasol and LeBron. How think you that's not a problem is beyond me. AD and LeBron when healthy are your dominant paint scorers. Give them their spacing, not fucking Andre Drummond lmao  &gt;You guys shot horrible from 3 and just won a chip.  I'm not sure winning the first title with that poor of 3 pt shooting since 2004 is exactly a proof of concept. Let's not regress back to the horrible offensive days of the 00's. We were doing so well, right?"
"Yeah, as we all know he prefers guys like Dwight Howard and Andre Drummond, players notorious for their high bball IQ."
WB is also a lot more skilled at his position than Drummond. Drummond is in the NBA due to being a natural athletic freak with no touch around the rim. WB worked his ass off to get where he is. Yeah he is a knucklehead who is overpaid but don't mention Andre Drummond in the same breath as the man cmon
"You know Jeremy Lin is a redditor right? He definitely shot better than Andre Drummond so there is that one, plus if I started really digging I could probably find fifty to a hundred college basketball players from division 3 to division 1 and they'd probably shoot better from the free throw line than Andre Drummond.   You're severely underestimated the overall user base of Reddit and the number of people who are actually halfway decent at shooting free throws. Andre Drummond's problems don't magically get better in practice because they're biomechanical and fundamental issues, it's not a nervous thing for him. I would accept that argument for Ben Simmons but not for Andre Drummond"
I'm actually curious if Andre Drummond knows how to swim because he can just stand up on the bottom of the pool and I know a surprising amount of people spend time around water but still can't actually swim properly. Plus usually you know how to swim because you grew up around some form of water and I don't actually know where Andre Drummond grew up
Respect to Andre Drummond. Always a good dude. My dad instincts kicked in while watching this. Totally relatable.
"Andre Drummond is a big versatile defensive minded big, can guard 1-5, can handle the rock, find open teammates, strong dad instinct, GOAT lifeguard, good in the post, stout rim protector, and I also heard he’s working on his three point shot👀 76ers got a steal"
"Literally me, Andre Drummond"
He now unlocked his full potential. Andre Drummond 2.0 is coming.
"Okay? Andre Drummond isn't good, and even if we were to pretend he is good, scoring isn't the thing he's supposed to be good at."
"Dude what are cavs gameplan seriously? Post LeBron they are just stuck in rebuilding limbo. They drafted a couple of names like Sexton, Garland, Okoro, (and now Mobley) that are okay. but not much of a household name on a small market like Ja Morant or DeAaron Fox.   Then they signed an Andre Drummond for a bit (which is now gone). And they still have Kevin Love. Now they have a decent Jarett Allen and probably Ricky. I guess I'm just wondering what are they gonna do? Are they just waiting for these young guys to breakout? Are they being a trade assett? Or who to build around with?"
That's why Andre Drummond is more efficient than Steph.
"As a Pistons fan, this was the scenario we faced when SVG traded for Reggie Jackson. He believed he was good enough to be a franchise point guard and so did our front office. He came off as cocky (and boy does Russell Westbrook still hate his fucking guts) but bet on himself to be more. Injuries and the general dysfunction of our team (hmm maybe we should let Andre Drummond shoot threes) derailed his trajectory.  The major difference is that other than his exuberance and swagger coming off as lack of drive, he showed actual potential to be something (on a better team with better players and coaching and front office) whereas Dennis has always been just an overrated asshole by all accounts.   The cool black German skateboarding point guard seemed like a fun character idea but they've run out of plots and he needs to be written off the show."
"If the 60's was watered down and all of the achievements of the greats back then are tarnished because of that, than why do people give so much credit to Lebron for making it 8 straight finals in the east which has been comparatively the weakest conference in the history of the NBA?  Despite the pool of teams being smaller, the talent of the NBA was much more concentrated. They still played 82 games a year and since there were a smaller amount of teams, this gave coaches a bigger role in their team by being able to strategize and target specific players. In todays NBA there's 30 teams across 82 games, you're less worried about strategies to beat other teams than you are strategizing to maximize your teams output. This is why when playoffs come and you play a team, your coach makes adjustments then rather than in the regular season. In the 60-70's, every regular season game felt more like a playoff game because you would see the same teams way more than 2-4 times a year.  Regardless of all that, you can safely say that Wilt is the most athletic player in NBA history by measuring his capability through the limited amount of videos of his prime. Basically a 7'1"" faster, taller and stronger Lebron James in terms of athletic freak and believe it or not he probably had a more consistent fade away jumper than Lebron from 16 feet in. Something like that in todays league would would be considered unstoppable. You can see his greatness by the amount of records he still holds.   Then when you take that into consideration, Bill Russell was just about as athletic as Wilt was! He was just not as tall, skilled at scoring, or as strong as Wilt. He basically had a super team for most of his career tho which is why Wilt is usually higher than Bill Russell in the GOAT list but Bill's speed and jump height was phenomenal even by todays standards. A DeAndre Jordan or Andre Drummond in the 60's would be forgettable players behind Wilt and Bill Russell just because of how overwhelming more athletic they were than those two."
PG - Elfrid Payton  SG - Denzel Valentine  SF - Kelly Oubre Jr.  PF - Kyle Kuzma  C - Andre Drummond
Naw we ain’t gotta even go that far. I wanna see her guard Andre Drummond. Easy 50 piece
Danny Green + Andre Drummond
"Denzel Valentine, Andre Drummond, Elfrid Payton, Jeff Teague, Kelly Oubre, Kyle Kuzma, Mario Hezonja, Dwayne Bacon, Caleb Martin, Hassan Whiteside"
"Imo an empty stats player is basically just someone who puts up good looking stats, but makes up for it by either being super inefficient, or by being a turnstile on defense. I think Lou Williams would fit the bill if he was a starter and got more minutes. I think his role as a bench scorer allows his scoring to outweigh his issues on D.  The obvious choice for this question is Andre Drummond, but since you said no centers, I'm having a difficult time coming up with a good example off the top of my head. Guys no longer in the league who fit the description are Monta Ellis, Jamaal Crawford, etc."
Lmao.  No.  How did Andre Drummond work out for you ?
Andre Drummond is only 28 years old. I feel like he was available to the Raptors in the expansion draft.
"i agree that a lot of crypto can be considered ""scams"" but there's a lot of potenial in blockchain. just not with andre drummond nfts...."
"None of this crypto shit makes any sense, 100% of the reason people buy it is to hype it up and sell it to some sucker later. Distributed pyramid scheme. And anyone who points that out ""doesn't understand the technology"" but apparently Andre Drummond or whatever D list celebrity does?"
Hmm well no one is guarding Andre Drummond at the 3point line so he has all the space in the world to shoot if he wants to.
The centerpiece of the Andre Drummond trade 🔥
"Depends on what you are trying to determine. Some things are obvious from watching games, which are not obvious from looking at box scores. Perfect example of this is Andre Drummond. Dude's box scores in Detroit were great yet Pistons fans could tell you that the numbers were not a reflection of his impact on  the game. When the Lakers got him, I figured the Pistons fans were just salty because I had really only looked at his box scores. It didn't take watching many games for me to realize how right the Pistons fans were.   Obviously there's plenty that can't be determined from just watching your favorite team play 3 times a week or so. We are mostly just fans and don't have the expertise or time to evaluate players."
Andre Drummond wherever he goes
"fuck dude, i need this guy to get traded to the magic or some shit so he can actually play games  you can just see how comfortable he is moving like that, even the first behind the back dribble. can you imagine andre drummond trying to do that shit, he might tear his shoulder"
Tell Pistons fans that in 2021 Greg Monroe would be out of the league and Andre Drummond signed a vet min. to have a humiliating video of him and his father Troel Embiid made
Andre Drummond Vs Joel Embiid
"Defensive metrics all suck defensively, trust me I'm a Pistons fan that had to watch Andre Drummond be super high in those for years. And basically all consider Klay as average defensively btw  Curry is a limited one on one defender (better now because he's strong) but he never miss a rotation, is active and smart off the ball, rarely screws up, can switch a bit and has quick hands  Do I want him guarding an all star guard ? No because he commits stupid fouls often. But he's better than most of the ""offense first small guards"" besides CP3 and Lowry."
"You just triggered all the kids with the skilled comment, because it’s true. The WNBA doesn’t have enough roster spots or a G-League to take on high potential athletic players. Most years not even all the first round draft picks make a roster. Hell it’s not unheard of for Lottery picks to be waived their second year. You basically contribute or get cut. Also, more skilled doesn’t mean that the W player would beat a NBA player. Obviously NBA players have more size and strength. More skill means they have more tools they can utilize. Elena Delle Donne, Breanna Stewart, and Candace Parker are more skilled than Javale McGhee, DeAndre Jordan, and Andre Drummond."
Tobias Harris would be the first example of an overpaid player. Second would be giving Andre Drummond anything over 2 million
Andre Drummond
"Idk really but Jabari Parker, Andre Drummond, Ben Simmons, Tingus Pingus?"
Prime DJ was a rim running monster  I feel like Andre Drummond is so bad even prime CP3 wouldn't help him
**2015-2016 NBA Season**  |Rk|Player|Pos|FG%| |-:|:-|:-|-:| |1|DeAndre Jordan|C|.703| |2|Dwight Howard|C|.620| |3|Hassan Whiteside|C|.606| |4|Enes Kanter|C|.576| |5|Marcin Gortat|C|.567| |6|Jonas Valanciunas|C|.565| |7|Kenneth Faried|PF|.558| |8|Karl-Anthony Towns|C|.542| |9|Robin Lopez|C|.539| |10|Gorgui Dieng|C|.532| |11|Greg Monroe|C|.522| |12|Andre Drummond|C|.521| |13|Nerlens Noel|C|.521| |14|LeBron James|SF|.520| |15|Derrick Favors|PF|.515| |16|Thaddeus Young|PF|.514| |17|LaMarcus Aldridge|PF|.513| |18|Nikola Jokic|C|.512| |19|Brook Lopez|C|.511| |20|Nikola Vucevic|C|.510| |21|Jahlil Okafor|C|.508| |22|Kawhi Leonard|SF|.506| |23|Giannis Antetokounmpo|PG|.506| |24|Kevin Durant|SF|.505| |25|Al Horford|C|.505| |26|Stephen Curry|PG|.504|  So by your measure Steph was the 26th best shooter in the league during his 2015-2016 season?
That’s the point lol  Do u think that Andre Drummond is a better scorer than James Harden and Steph Curry?
Yeah according to FG% Andre Drummond is better than Steph Curry lmao
"it is a rebound that shouldnt exist though. 5 rebounds when there should be zero statistically looks the same as getting 5 rebounds which restart a possession after missed 3s, but their impact on the game is wildly different.    And a missed layup self-rebound is not an equal opportunity rebound. Much higher percentage than a 50/50 ball when youre in the kind of positions that andre drummond is in, right under the basket."
Dude got hit by with a cheap shot elbow while he had the ball and had the self control to not start a fight. I’ll still take the mma fighter over Andre Drummond any day lmao.
"you might as well have said ""I do not understand Andre Drummond to any team in the league at all."""
"Tim Thomas played like a bad/homeless man's version of Paul George. Extremely talented jump shooter, super fluid and athletic etc. but settled for way too many outside shots and was maddeningly inconsistent because of it. Had definite All-Star talent but the brain of Michael Beasley  Jamaal Magloire was the type of bruising, low-skill center that has pretty much been phased out of the game nowadays. No real offensive moves but didn't stop him from trying. Best comparison I can think of is Andre Drummond with less athleticism and lower usage. Back then grabbing double-digit rebounds was seen as an indicator of stardom, but even then plenty of people were complaining he got picked for All-Star over LeBron  Can't really speak on the others, don't remember them well enough"
"Cool I'm new here, so we hate Ben Simmons and Andre Drummond, anyone else I should know that I need to hate?"
Lakers fans thinking they got their next hall of fame center takes are hilarious right now.   Shannon sharpe calling Andre Drummond a better mid season pickup and better player than Rasheed Wallace was for the 04 Pistons is even funnier.    Cans and Pistons fans were right bout this dude
"as someone who knew malik monk in high school, i don’t see what everyone else sees. i mean if the guy hadn’t gone to LA, he’d probably be out of the league in a bit. i understand he hasn’t had much playing time in charlotte, but to me, he’s always been an andre drummond type that just makes so many mental mistakes and defense he’s a blow by/ foul trouble. i just think lakers fans freak out about everyone, just like they did drummond. not saying the guy can’t improve and have a good year in a good environment, but he’s definitely gonna have some frustrating moments throughout the season."
"""When you're losing confidence in life, just remember Andre Drummond shushed the Sixers crowd after draining two free throws while his team was down 30 points"""
"If you don't like that, you don't like Andre Drummond Basketball."
"Oh come on. There have been hundreds of dudes like him in the league throughout the years. You think guys make the league by being all nice and wholesome? He might have been a hothead and cheapshot artist, that puts him in company like Chris Paul, Andre Drummond, Bill Laimbeer, John Stockton, Dennis Rodman, Ron Artest, Mo Lucas and an endless longer list."
"Between Ben Simmons and Andre Drummond shooting free throws, Doc Rivers will go gray by the season's end."
Andre Drummond. now no one cares about the beef with embiid
Your GM signed Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond apparently can shoot free throws well in practice from the stories I’ve heard so I think it’s a mental thing for a lot of these guys
thank you for clarifying.  I was genuinely concerned that Joel Embiid and Andre Drummond would be laying out bricks at their local construction site.
"That doesn’t make him a bad ball handling big. A bad ball handling big is Andre Drummond, not a guy who regularly scores from the post on elite efficiency."
"Honestly, in short spurts, Andre Drummond has incredible handles"
"Well, it's both, honestly.  Some guys are just flat-out gifted. Andre Drummond is an example - he puts in the hours, but doesn't put in *the work*. For 99.999% of the population, if they approached the game like Dre, they'd never play basketball past high school. Whereas, for other guys, it doesn't matter how hard you work, you're not going to be great. The world is full of 6-foot guys that can shoot and work really, really hard, but just don't have the quickness or the athleticism necessary to compete at that level.   But there are also athletic 7-footers that aren't professionals, because they don't care or get in their own way, and some guys like Alan Iverson and Trae Young that overcome their own genetic limitations and work their asses off to get where they get.  But really, to be a professional, you have to win both the genetic lottery *and* be raised in an environment conducive to your improvement *and* possess the mental make-up to get there."
"&gt; Now, they think Andre Drummond is a viable answer  No we don't... He's making vet minimum to play probably 10-15 minutes a game like Dwight did last year."
"The league is stupid... the national bullshit association... when kemba Walker and Andre Drummond sign for the fucking minimum?!?! Just to go with their buddies to win a chip.. I'm done.. you see max deals or min deals.. the economics of this league are as if handled by a drug dealer .. it's pure stupid. If a team has 3 or 4 decent players ,, they get like 20 mill and that gives the team not enough Cap space to sign a ""max"" player... but then you have the teams on the beaches that guys will go to just to win and sign for nothing.. or negotiate buyouts etc.. it's a stupid league.. . It's the ultimate equivalent of you and your boys trying to run a rec league title and stacking your team. The good cities dont don't play by the same cap rules.."
The NBA seriously needs to check itself with regards to play style and player drama.. it's just pure non sense and going to be less popular moving forward. If you are a kid watching andre Drummond put up 14 and 11 and sign for a minimum deal because the league is predicated on 3 point shooting ...it's it's different game now and a much less entertaining one at that
PPS: Please only refer to me as Andre AI Dr J Drummond from this point forward
Sixers had a press conference for Andre Drummond today which confused me for this very reason. I didn't think they were allowed to make it official until the 6th?
"Joel Embiid and Andre Drummond are like Shaq and Zo, but Joel is both Shaq and Zo"
PS: Im starting at center -Andre Drummond
" &gt;An Andre Drummond sized duck is basically a dinosaur lol it would tear apart the NBA  Bro it's defense would be elite.  All time GOAT. Mj and LeBron look like jokes. Not even in the conversation.   Why? A Drummond sized duck is going to have massive ass wings as is. But Drummond size also mean it's weight will be same as his. Well those wings just got bigger. Since birds are lighter for their size. Meaning wings that size &amp; strength will generate the force of a small one man helicopter lol.   The duck has AOE defense. It will just stand in one spot and flap its wings and no shot is going in lol. No more 3pointers for the team, or jump shots. Dunks are there only real chance. Layups percentage will drop heavily. Guys like Kyrie and Curry (under the rim) never making a layup lol. Teams have 0 spacing. Doesn't matter what shooters you got so good luck getting dunk attempts. Better than goal tending without being goal tending lol.   Passing? Not really an option either. Good luck making any passes that hit on target that aren't essentially hand offs. Dribbling? Forget about it, specially with 0 spacing and defenders around and that wind lol. So handoffs are incredibly difficult as well lol.  What about shooting free throws? There is no rule against me flapping my arms while waiting for the opponent to shoot free throws. Suddenly they are making 0 free throws. If it ever comes to late game. Foul whoever you want because they aren't making any of them lol. You get the ball back 0 issue.  Honestly you can have literally scrubs playing with this Drummond sized duck and it'll be easier for them to score than the opposing team lol. They win easily. That is the GOAT.  TLDR: Duck as basketball player &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Drummond"
"Embiid has been trolling Drummond and calling him soft for years. They had a little ""feud"" where Embiid basically owned his ass.  [This article covers it pretty well](https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/sixers/nba-free-agency-sixers-andre-drummond-signing-digs-his-joel-embiid-beef)"

Andre Drummond on the way!
"Next to Andre Drummond, he is the best example of an empty stats guy."
Slightly better than Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond being a perennial DPOY winner annoyed me to no end  I checked and the mf has HOF Interceptor badge lmao
There will always be Andre Drummond.
An Andre Drummond sized duck is basically a dinosaur lol it would tear apart the NBA
Would you rather build a team around one Andre Drummond sized duck or 💯 duck sized Andre Drummonds?
60% FT Andre Drummond is here to teach Ben Simmons how to bend his knees.
Andre Drummond is aggressive and wrong. Should we build around him instead of Simmons?
"As someone who really tried to stick up for Drummond for way too long... This is perfect.   I second the motion for Andre ""The Abscess"" Drummond."
"No, you're spot on.  Andre Drummond is a loser, in the simplest sense of the term.  Pistons wasted nearly a decade on him."
From Ben Simmons passing up open dunks to Andre Drummond klutzing his way out of open dunks.
"&gt;Andre knows the pecking order  Does he really though? Everything that's ""wrong"" about him can be summed up in one word. Delusional.  He should use his amazing gift of athleticsm combined with his incredible stature to be an all time rebounder and defender. He SHOULD fit into this role nicely, but nope. He thinks he's above that. He think he has offensive game, or is above just getting stats. No team concept whatsoever. Delusional.  Releasing not one, not two, not three, but FOUR separate NFTs (Who really wants an NFT of Drummond, after all?) most notable, the one that's supposed to sit at a $50k reserve but currently a month into bidding it's not even at $700. Delusional.  Going onto a podcast and admitting you're the worst teammate ever, chase empty stats, throw dirty elbows and physically &amp; verbally assault your own teammates; while being a truly subpar individual on the court. WHILE STILL BEING IN THE LEAGUE AND ONLY 27 YEARS OF AGE. Delusional."
I guess Andre Drummond is worth 20m?
"This is the hardest part to me..  in theory Andre Drummond is a good player looking at SOME stats, but then you watch him and it’s painfully obvious he is not a winning player and probably never will be because his only high level skill he has is hoarding rebounds (which the sixers actually already do pretty well) and things fall apart.  We needed a backup who could protect the rim and space the floor for Simmons when Embiid is out and we got neither.  I would of rather taken a chance on really anybody else but we’ll see.  I had a similar opinion of Dwight Howard last year and he was actually pretty good for the most part.  I also know Andre Drummond is no Dwight Howard even 😂😂"
"Andre Drummond is a 2x All Star who just signed for the minimum. Never had a major injury, is only 27 years old."
&gt;Andre Drummond Admits He Intentionally Elbows Teammates in the Face for Taking His Rebounds  Hanz
"""Joel Embiid is out indefinitely with a broken orbital bone after being elbowed by teammate Andre Drummond in practice, league sources tell ESPN""  \-- Woj, two months or so in the future"
First game Embiid rests and Simmons starts next to Andre Drummond may make me go get the bleach.
"The first person who comes to my mind when I think of non winning player is Andre Drummond.  I can very much be wrong and he may provide value, but he’s literally the first guy that popped into my head."
"In case you're wondering how the Sixers managed to avoid this penalty with Embiid, Simmons, and Harris all on maxes, the rest of their roster is currently:  Seth Curry on a stupidly good contract, Andre Drummond on a minimum, and a bench where the oldest player is 24 year old Shake Milton"
"Hassan Whiteside: Led league in blocks, good rebounder, nice stats.  Andre Drummond: Led league in rebounding, nice stats.  Enes Kanter: Good finisher under the basket, nice stats.  Future centers wanting to be in demand and earn serious dollars need to work on being a floor spacer, dual threat in passing/defense, and learn how to get shooters wide open whether it is the p&amp;r, screens, etc., If you're just a center who can only get your own opportunities, you're basically a vet minimum player."
"I see what you're doing OP. This is like that $50,000 NFT Andre Drummond auctioned that gained traction after somebody posted it here ;)"
This video pretty much sums up andre drummond:   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lki28p/oc_andre_drummond_is_the_worst_high_usage/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
"If signing Andre Drummond to any contract at all is the only thing you've done, that's a loss."
I wish I can find this old argument I got in with some dude who said Andre Drummond was a great addition to the Lakers and was a great player overall.
The fact that Andre Drummond thinks he’s a better player than Reggie Big Government Jackson is laughable
The Nerlens Noel thing seems to put one thing into perspective: don’t give up on athletic defensive anchors with rim running capabilities. They’ll figure it out and settle into their role eventually. Might take 10 years but it’ll happen.  Edit: except for Andre Drummond who seemingly had it figured out and then regressed every season afterwards
"I'm going to guess he gave up more than Andre Drummond ... because Drummond only gave up $790,000 last season."
"As someone who has unironically defended Andre Drummond and the Olive Garden, I really feel seen by this take. As I get older and the sample size gets larger, I realize I just have bad taste."
"I will still maintain that Andre Drummond is the worst draft pick in Pistons history, in terms of the impact on the franchise's success.  We basically wasted a fuckin decade on *this* dude."
Andre “Unlimited Salad and Breadsticks” Drummond
"Or whip out a wrench. Andre got a skull like a blue ribbon pumpkin. Unless WB took a running start, I don’t think Drummond would feel much."
Fuck Andre Drummond  peepoLeave
"Andre Drummond on the Pistons was like Olive Garden.   Overpriced, sounds really good on paper, ends up being disappointing every time you get it"
"&gt;Who the fuck does Andre Drummond think he is??  I mean, if you take rebounds from Andre Drummond, there's practically nothing left"
He is better than Andre Drummond already for what it's worth as evidenced by the Suns Lakers 1st round last year.
The Andre Drummond route.
"&gt;I'm genuinely curious. Are you under the impression that shooting 29.7% from 5-9 feet and doing that at high volume is good?  He shot 40%. You’re looking at 10-14 feet. Either way the point here is that you were talking  out of your ass.   &gt;Literally the only player shooting a higher volume at a lower percentage is Andre Drummond. Most of the players shooting higher volumes are in the 40s and 50s of percentage. I mean, thanks for proving my point that Ben Simmons can't fucking shoot outside the restricted area, but, like... I did already know.  Before being a dick you should at least double check your info. Instead of just acknowledging you were wrong about him shooting in the paint you decided to triple down and pretend he shot only 30%.   His % from 5-9 is comparable to Jaylen Brown, Sabonis, Embiid to name a few."
"I'm genuinely curious. Are you under the impression that shooting 29.7% from *5-9 feet* and doing that at high volume is *good*?

"When I  saw the word ""shoots"" I for sure thought I was about to see some Andre Drummond FT type accuracy. I no longer know how to react."
"That's pretty much the Andre Drummond story at this point, isn't it?  Big numbers for the box-score watchers, not much impact at all on whether or not his team actually wins the basketball game."
Andre Drummond  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4zNSr0O6Tpk
"It's not hate in a literal sense for me (Pistons fan). His playstyle was just frequently not conducive to winning.   Every now and again, he could be a legitimate force, playing the right way and doing the right things. More frequently, however, he was a living embodiment of a lot of my least favorite teammates in organized, pick-up, and rec basketball history. He'd over-dribble even though he's an unreliable dribbler. He'd take shots he couldn't make. He attempt the weirdest floaters. He couldn't make a routine jump hook. He'd complete one slick bounce pass and decide he's now entitled to attempting wild passes ad nauseum. Hitting over 59 percent of his free throws was cause for celebration. He'd slouch his shoulders after a bad play and not get back on D. And he was frequently mentally outwitted by the opposition.   After he signed with L.A. I heard a lot of folks saying things like, ""Well he was on a bad team so what do you want?"" To that I say, when the guy who backed your franchise into signing him to a max contract plays the way Andre Drummond does, there's a reason why your team sucks. (In the interest of full disclosure, no one forced the Pistons to sign him to that deal, though it probably made sense at the time; also, the Pistons have been awful for reasons beyond Drummond, too, but he's been a part of it.)"
"It's amazing how Ben and his team completely screwed this all up.   Somebody talked about how Ben was able to pick the right fights which covered his flaws. NCAA, LSU, Jimmy Butler, etc...   Almost all the reasons why he would want to get traded has a grain of truth. People for years, claimed Embiid and Simmons' offensive game overlaps where they hold each other back. He is getting a disproportionate amount of blame for the Atlanta loss (but still deserves the majority). The team tried to trade him in the first year of a 5 year contract, but he's the asshole for asking for a trade after 1 year of a 5 year contract.   This latest revelation does have a grain of truth in in as well, in the press conference after the game on Monday Night, when Andre Drummond answered ""We lost"" when asked about his individual performance. r/Sixers celebrated him for that, ""Team First!"" How much shit would Simmons get if he was going 0-6 from 3PT and costing the team games and playoff positioning for the first two years?   All these little bits of truth doesn't hide the major truth, he really never made that commitment to contributing in the half court. He could get to the line anytime he wants. His FTA &amp; FT% are poor, he should be getting to the line at least 5 times a game (10 attempts). He should be shooting 80% from the line. Giannis shoots 10 FTA a night a bit under 70% and that's an **extra 4pts a game!!!!**"
“Prime Andre Drummond was a PROBLEM”
I don’t need to play to know what I see. But I don’t think Andre Drummond is a good center at all
"This man may play awfully, but I’m glad we’ve got him if he’s gonna bring moments like this.   Andre Drummond would never"
Is Hassan Whiteside the new Andre Drummond or is Andre Drummond the new Hassan Whiteside?
Remember Andre Drummond? Couldn’t flip him
"Me too. I'm like, why is Simmons DMing Andre Drummond?"
"When you open the dictionary in the future for “empty stats guy”, there will be a picture of Andre Drummond next to it."
This is the Andre Drummond experience
Because the panel of people selecting the team thought they were better? That doesn’t make it accurate. Again Luka Doncic and Andre Drummond got all defence votes. Shawn Marion has never got a selection despite routinely being a top 2-3 defensive wing. They’re far from an end all be all.   And yea Conley and Allen were excellent. Gasol was still more impactful than both. And Lebron had bosh battier and chalmers. All great defensive players but their team defence was much worse than Memphis
"And the same thing would occur if it happened with Gobert. The perception of a panel of judges making selective selections isn’t objective or factual. A players impact on the other hand, is.   Hell last year or the year prior, Luka Doncic and Andre Drummond got all defence votes. The opinions of those people are what you think is most important ? I’ll go with who was the biggest difference maker defensively.   Marc was not only the most impactful defender on his team, statistically he had a larger impact than Lebron (twice as large), Chandler (like literally fifteen times as large) and Noah (not a huge gap but 1-2 points better)"
i'd rather have andre drummond than ben simmons because at least andre isn't afraid if taking shots
It’s okay. He thinks Andre Drummond is the best center of all time
Yeah that was the argument to max Andre Drummond too
How many minutes does andre Drummond play a game
Remember when we thought that Andre Drummond and Greg Monroe was gonna be one of the best big men duos since Duncan and The Admiral?
"It's so interesting how long fans and teams will wait for player development. We saw this same thing in Detroit with Andre Drummond. So much potential, never developed it. Now Simmons is in the same boat. Amazing at a certain number of things, of which offense is not one."
Block and steal numbers doesn’t mean that much when you value defense or Andre Drummond would have couple DPOY awards
Andre Drummond = AD
With that team you could have Andre Drummond and it won't even matter
"&gt; You don't max players, you lose them because someone else will  An that panic leads you to give max contracts to all sorts of players, no matter their ability. ""Oh no, we have a young player with potential, let's max him out!"" And now you have handed a $130 million contract to Andre Drummond."
"With that said, I present to you one of the greatest big men to ever play the game:  Andre Drummond"
"&gt;What was the most underrated player acquisition?  &gt; Also receiving votes: Andre Drummond, Philadelphia"
Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond season MVP
You gotta love recency bias.   All NBA first team  Tyler Herro  Jordan Poole  THT  Cam Thomas  Andre Drummond
"Pre season legends THT, Andre Drummond, Tyler Herro, and Cameron Thomas"
wait Andre Drummond having a great game doesn’t result in wins? who would’ve guessed that….
I want a refund for my Andre Drummond experience!
"The fact that he got out of that big deal in Cleveland to go to the mega market with LeBron, only to still shit the bed absolutely eliminated any ounce fo legitimacy Andre Drummond had. One game isn’t gonna change many minds on him."
Andre Drummond also looked like Kareem last pre season with the Cavs. He is who he is
Classic Andre Drummond moment
Well duh. Can’t ask andre Drummond to do that much lol
"""Yeah, that one time Andre Drummond did a spin move with a loose ball, then turned it over 2 secs later and resulted in an easy dunk for me... yeah, that was when I knew the NBA was different.""   \~ Scottie Barnes"
Bruh imagine your welcome to the nba moment is against mf andre Drummond lol
The Andre Drummond experience
I want a refund on Andre Drummond
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
Andre drummond is only 28
Andre Drummond is only 7 months older than Joel Embiid
Andre Drummond is younger than Buddy Hield.
"You can always play this game with Andre Drummond, he’s younger than you think."
michael kidd gilchrist is older than buddy hield by about 2 1/2 months  andre drummond and malcom brogdon are also the same   dylan windler and sekou doumboya despite being i the same draft class are about 5 years apart
Chris Boucher is older than Andre Drummond.

Andre Drummond is only 1 year older than Giannis  And Lottery pick Chris Duarte is only 1 year younger than Mitchell
i was at that game! april 10 to be exact. Thats when I  started dating my current gf so I remember both of us just talking shit about andre drummond just to watch him end up dominating lol
Andre Drummond is on his Dwight redemption arc.
"It’s worked of course. Haven’t you heard? It was a three team deal.  Sixers get: Fred Van Vleet, Pascal Siakam, a wolves second rounder  Raptors get: Andre Drummond, a wolves second rounder  Wolves get: Ben Simmons, all of raptors FRPs"
"This is probably gonna be wildly unpopular, but I think Sabonis is a lot more Andre Drummond than Nikola Jokic.  He bogs down the offense, is a liability on defense, isn't a shooter (although he's shown some promise) and he can pass but I don't think he makes his team better as a result. The key guys (Turner, Brogdon, Levert, Warren*) all put up better numbers when Sabonis was off the court.   *(Warren the year before since he barely played last season)  Last year was a bit of a mess with Bjorken, but the Pacers as a team were significantly better with Sabonis on the bench, and while they were better with him on the court the 2 years before that, the plus-minus was a lot smaller than you'd expect for an All-Star player.  He's a very productive rebounder via counting stats, but has one of the lowest percentages of contested rebounds for a starting center despite being near the top for rebounds per game. If you watch him play, he often fights for rebounds over his own teammates. The Pacers have also been a horrible rebounding team since he's gotten big minutes, ranking near the bottom of the league consistently.  They have also given up a ton of offensive rebounds, and led the league in opponent offensive rebounds last year when Sabonis played career high in minutes per game. He has one of the lowest boxouts per 36 of any starting center because he just goes for every rebound to pad his stats.  I don't think he's a *bad* player, but I think he's pretty overrated and IMO the Pacers are better off keeping Turner and trading Sabonis to take advantage of his value being high."
Implying Andre Drummond isn't always as good as Shaq
“I am so impressed with the potential you see in me” -	Michael Scott -	Andre Drummond
@wojespn: “Breaking: 76ers center Andre Drummond reportedly ‘demanded’ to start at center over Joel Embiid as a condition of his signing. Sixers ultimately rejected that demand.”
"Well the last time Aldridge played he unfortunately had his heart issue, but also he unfortunately made Andre Drummond look like Shaq"
"It would be impossible for him to take over a playoff game in the traditional sense of the words.  He just can’t score enough points.   If I recall correctly, he had some good first round games against Miami and Brooklyn.  He’s never been good in the second round.  And he was a liability in the first round against Washington this last season.  Then Atlanta was historically awful.  I feel like he’s on pace to have the Andre Drummond career arc."
Replace Bam and Capela with prime Lebron and MJ and Andre Drummond with Klay Thompson or something.
&gt; Andre Drummond isn’t working at Enterprise with you  Correct because he has the option of making millions of dollars instead. He chose the millionaire option over the pedestrian option. So please tell me how he has no choice.
No he won’t. Fuck are you talking about. Andre Drummond isn’t working at Enterprise with you. And the family that his paychecks support aren’t about to let him do that either.
Because what the fuck is Andre Drummond going to do if he doesn’t get his checks?   You’re not getting it.
D’Angelo Russell is the Andre Drummond of guards
Andre Drummond missed more free throws in a single game than Steve Nash missed in some full seasons.
"I think hes just a contrarian at times, dude was defending andre drummond like this time last year"
I can appreciate almost any player on the floor.  But Andre Drummond just fucking baffles me. Occasionally Kelly Oubre also does but it goes in fits and spurts with him.
"Having your second best player actively sabotaging your franchise is whatever, but having to see Andre Drummond play basketball is too much  Thoughts and Prayers."
"This just confirms what we all knew already. We’re about to see A LOT of Andre Drummond, whether we want to or not."
"If Andre Drummond qualifies as good, then him ... he definitely got the hate part on lock."
The kid in Andre Drummond means he’s willing to feel the enjoyment from eating pineapple on pizza
"I mean andre drummond has gotten DPOY votes my man. He was a great defender then, but DPOY? Not imo."
I mean andre drummond has gotten DPOY votes that doesnt mean anything. Lebron was a great defender then but DPOY level? Not imo.
"After having to team up with Andre Drummond, he is getting shit on by Ben Simmons? Poor Embiid"
"can’t believe i have to side with Andre Drummond, pineapple pizza is good"
"I'm gonna get flamed for this, but Andre Drummond.  His biggest issues are in the mental game - he tries too much, thinks too highly of himself, and doesn't like taking a backseat. However, I think if he ever gets his head on straight he can be just as much a contributor as Chandler was on that Dallas team. Might need to work on his hands a bit too, but he's got too much athleticism and talent to just get washed down the toilet."
Andre Drummond will step up in his absence.
&gt; They tend to have a problem with players like that because of the inflated TS% on easy buckets  You should compare like usage players against each other.  Complaining about this is a bit like saying rebounds is a bad stat because it says Andre Drummond is better than Kevin Durant. You need to compare it in reasonable contexts.
"As someone who has watched the Lakers for the last 2 seasons, I think Dwight might be better. Drummond gets more rebounds, but his defense is super average and he provides no lob catching, shooting, or any other semblance of offensive skill. That man has the least hops and worst hands I've ever seen from someone that is supposed to be a roll man, he has no touch around the rim whatsoever yet insists on shooting at least 2 or 3 weird running hooks a game, and he doesn't consistently make defensive rotations. Literally every line of Stephen A. Smith's ""bonafide scrub"" rant also applies to Andre Drummond."
You must be talking about Andre drummond
andre drummond
"Oh shit I didn't even realize that. So if Dwight Howard (and Andre Drummond, to be fair) were never born, maybe Gasol is still on the squad and the Lakers have perfect numerical harmony."
How bad Andre Drummond is absolutely does not need to be explained to me. He’s one of the most useless basketball players I can think of. If either of them see playoff minutes the result will be about the same
Dude did not deserve Andre Drummond and all those miserable years in Detroit.. I’m really happy for Reggie Jackson.
"2011- Jonas Valančiūnas to Jan Vesely   2012- Terrence Ross to Andre Drummond  2013- N/A  2014- Bruno Caboclo to Mitch McGary  2015- Delon Wright to Justin Anderson   Pretty rough.   All three were traded for important championship pieces. Caboclo was 2 years away from being 2 years away 2 years ago, but Mitch McGary was worse"
Andre Drummond or Blake at the beginning of last season
Watching Andre Drummond's career makes me wonder how many g-leaguers and undrafted players could have made a killing in the NBA if Andre Drummond could be so successful lol
You mean Point God Andre Drummond?
Idk why but Andre Drummond really would strike a nerve in me at absolutely any time he was on the court. Is it just me?
Friendly reminder Greg Logan once voted for Andre Drummond for DPOY
Greg Monroe and Andre Drummond the ELITE twin towers
"&gt;Cavs have a lot of potential this year. If he can show up the first part of the season there are plenty of teams that'll take him.  ~Me, speaking about Andre Drummond, just about 1 year ago."
"I think it's because it's much more difficult to succeed on raw, physical attributes in the NFL. If we lived in a world where every man was 6'0"", 98% of the players in the NBA would not be there. Do you really think Ben Simmons would be playing professional basketball at 6'0""? Andre Drummond? JeVale McGee?  There are a lot of guys in the NBA who are, fundamentally speaking, not great basketball players.  While it's true you do have to some luck with genes to make the NFL, as well, being 6'5"" doesn't automatically make you an NFL QB. Being able to run a 4.4 40 doesn't automatically make you a good WR if you can't run routes or catch the ball. Whereas, you can be a 6'10""+ dude and you have a high probability of playing professional basketball if you can do some basic things."
Andre Drummond
&gt;Going through the rising stars games…   &gt;Tyreke Evans   &gt;Brandon Jennings   &gt;Bregman Roe     &gt;Andre Drummond   &gt;Andrew Wiggins   &gt;Jabari Parker  I mean it tough to say Drummond and not think of Greg Monroe too. Pistons thought they had some twin towers for a stretch.  Edit: just now realizing Bregman Roe is Greg Monroe.. did you use text-to-speech? Lol

I remember maybe in like 2k17 Andre Drummond won DPOY every fuckin year lmao
"Plus he signed Andre Drummond as a backup center without a suitable third center for when Drummond fails to perform or has to start in Joel's place, after Drummond had a poor showing with both the Lakers and the Cavs."
"Thatd only be a carreer 5% increase lol, hes bad hes not Andre Drummond  What Simmons really needs is league average confidence to just fucking shoot the ball"
He traded for George Hill and signed Andre Drummond without another suitable back up center. He's had some misses in Philly.
Andre Drummond         Nah just kidding I still don't like that guy lmao
"Yeah but we still saw a shit ton of LeMickey and ADisney, and Drummond still got shat on whenever the Lakers were brought up. You'd think Andre Dumbo would be used in those moments."
You aren't one dimensional if you are extremely efficient offensive player I don't care how much of a threat you aren't away from the basket if you have a TS of like 700 you are not one dimensional. What you are is exceptionally valuable.  One dimensional is Andre Drummond.
Best one was drummond with Andre Dumbo.
"Starting 5: Simmons, IT, Jeremy Lin, Lance Stephenson, Andre Drummond"
"As unlikely as it may seem right now, the Sixers path to success is for Zach Lavine to inform the Bulls he won't re-sign despite the moves they made, and for him and Rich Paul to see his best chance at a ring with fellow Klutch client Ben Simmons in Philadelphia.  Winning a chip or coming close with the Sixers dramatically increases the value of three Klutch Sports properties (Simmons, Lavine, Maxey).   Meanwhile, I'm not sure Demar Derozan and Lonzo Ball fit all that well around Lavine.  Is Derozan gonna bury 3pt shots after Lavine drives and kicks it?  I dont think so.  Is Lavine going to cede the #1 scoring role to Derozan and wait for kickouts?  I don't think so.  With all of them together, I still don't think they're better than Atlanta or Boston.   Besides that, the Bulls lost Thaddeus Young and Otto Portert and Lauri Markkanen, but just took Portland's FRP instead of Larry Nance Jr.  I suspect they signed Derozan to a marquee contract and Lonzo Ball to carry the weight after Lavine leaves instead of seriously thinking those guys can make the conference finals in the East.    Because he was in a contract year and had say in where he was going, the Bucks got Jrue Holiday for has-been Eric Bledsoe and picks.  Also in his contract year, the Sixers got Jimmy Butler for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.  It's a players league.  Zach Lavine and Rich Paul have the power.   **Ben Simmons, Zach Lavine, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid**  **Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Andre Drummond**"
"Shit, his career game came against Andre Drummond in Detroit. Was a bloodbath"

About those rebounds...   https://cavaliersnation.com/2020/05/19/andre-drummond-says-he-used-punch-former-teammate-who-kept-coming-take-his-rebounds/  Straight from Andre's mouth himself.    I can't even with you trying to use Giannis to prop up Drummond's defense.
Andre Drummond. Hes not called the big penguin for nothing..  Oh wait. You meant MY team!  Seriously Drummond can be a trojan horse
Andre Drummond. Considering his accomplishments. He is going to disappear
"No, he just sucks. You would’ve said the same thing about Stanley Johnson. When Andre Drummond has more drive and a more polished offensive game than you, your NBA career in shambles."
Yeah he's apparently contemplating retirement or looking to play elsewhere. He rightfully didn't appreciate getting benched for Andre Drummond.
Andre Drummond 2.0
"stop overating his stats buddy, he got cooked by min player andre drummond that saturday night game. you letting a guy with heart issues back on your team, that says a lot about that organization."
They just fixed a mistake by replacing Andre Drummond with Dwight Howard. Don't screw it up again
"He's great in transition. So what. Andre Drummond is great under the basket. There's more to the game.   If Washington can take him out of his game, how he supposed to compete with contenders.   And it doesn't matter if you are  great passer when you defender can slack off on you because you can't and won't shoot.   &amp;#x200B;  Nobody is denying what he does well: It's what he doesn't do that holds him and his team back.   He's been in the league 4 years and he isn't even better than he was as a rookie.   That's a problem. When you see ZERO development in a player on four years?   The Sixers would have done better wit Lowry running the point than Simmons. They would have been better off with Ricky Rubio.   When you're set to pay a dude nearly 40 million to run the point, you expect him to at the very least have a jump shot."
"If you ever needed proof that the worst NBA player in the league would destroy you on the court, here’s what Andre Drummond looks like in real life."
&gt; they all contributed last year.   Rondo got bought out by Memphis...  Millsap couldn't stay on the floor in the first round of the playoffs because his D was so bad.  Gasol was relegated to bench warmer to fucking Andre Drummond and is contemplating retirement.  Bro you seriously over estimate what these guys brought to the table lol
Andre Drummond is a two time All Star and has led the league in rebounding several times. He's also made an All NBA team
"Oh, an appeal to authority. KG said X, so I am right.   Got it.   I'm still waiting for you to explain how comparing a guy with NO title, NO ALL-NBA selections, and NO DPOY is some how comparable.   But you go ahead and keep using up those logical fallacies. If they make you feel better.   You still haven't addressed any of the points I made.   The Grizz didn't win anything. Not even a division title.   Allen never made an All-Star team. Not All-NBA team. No titles in Memphis. He was a defensive specialist who often came off the bench, which yes, makes him a regular rotation player but not always a starter.   There is nothing 'inaccurate' about this. Was he important to the Grizz's success in his time there, as limited as that success was? Yes.   Look... you are a Grizz fan. You take this personal, or so it seems, but it an objective person looking outside, this seems like a low bar to set for a jersey retirement.    That's just the truth. If it's a hard pill to swallow, it's because getting swept by the team who lost to the team who won the title is the closest the Grizz have come so far to accomplishing anything of merit. Their BEST season involved getting swept in the WCF. Not even winning a game.   And I get it, for a small market team, even getting that far is hard and is something special. Trust me. I'm a Detroit fan and a Toronto fan, and I've had to watch the Raptors flounder for years before we won a crap shoot and landed Leonard. And the Pistons haven't won a playoff game for almost 15 years.   But  I'm not going to say ""Well... Andre Drummond played here for X number of years, and he was part of most successful team since Billups left, so he deserves his number up in the rafters.""   &amp;#x200B;  Guys get rewarded for a high level of excellence, which at the NBA standard comes in two forms: Team excellence and individual excellence.   Tony Allen won a title in Boston and played there almost as long as he played in Memphis, and he isn't getting a jersey retired there. And he WON there.   He hasn't set himself apart individually outside of his defensive skills, which haven't even been good enough to warrant an All-Star or All-NBA selections, unlike Ben Wallace (to speak to your comparison).   So yes, being  a starter on a team that got swept out of the conference finals and never making an All-Star team or All-NBA team or even so much as averaging double figure is a low bar.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm happy for the guy. He worked hard. He saw a high level of team success in Boston. He helped set a new standard to winning in Memphis (which was jumping over a low bar if I'm being honest) and they are rewarding him. Cool. But it's still a low bar.   &amp;#x200B;  And it doesn't matter how many logical fallacies you throw at me: That is demonstrably true."
His shot isnt broken.  He just refuses to use it.  You're thinking of Andre Drummond.
Either Andre Drummond or Paul Silas

"It's the same case for Andre Drummond last year : ""I don't actually watch basketball"""
76ers Sign Two-Time All-Star Andre Drummond
"I guess that's fair.  My team is just like ""we're going to trade all our first round picks away to aquire an aging dunker to pair with Andre Drummond and that should be enough to contend for a championship"".  And I can just be like ""aight, cool, see you in five years I guess"".  And then I don't have to think about them anymore.  I guess that's better, idk."
"There are definitely some players who put up ""empty stats"" like when andre Drummond has a 20/20 from half his own misses and doesn't help his team at all. But for some reason people started saying empty stats for great players on bad teams."
"hey it's alright, they have andre drummond to repair it now"
"This man is slowly turning into Andre Drummond 2.0. This ain’t a lottery, it’s a bargain bin at Walmart."
Andre Drummond mark my words
"How badly has Andre Drummond fallen that he couldn't beat out Marc Gasol, who can hardly run or jump and ends up being the back up for Embiid for the vets minimum? Unreal."
"sure it can, but the NFT scheme is kinda disconnected to Andre Drummond's basketball appeal. You bid on the token and you ""win"" it regardless of how people rate Drummond as a player. the value of the token can never go down, that's what I'm referring to"
Andre Drummond was never that famous to begin with and is at the lowest point of his career. What a stupid mistake.
My q then is.... why would someone want to own a displayed graphic of Andre Drummond?
"This isn't an overly complicated or exact explanation. But in summary, it's a digital object that belongs to someone.  Say you've got a drawing. You can sell digital copies of your drawing online. Lots of people do that.  But, if you've got enough value as an artist, you can sell or auction your digital drawing online. Then a buyer or bidders attempt to purchase it with cryptocurrency. The buyer or winner now owns that digital drawing.  The NFT part of it in layman's terms is an identification number assigning that ownership to the buyer.    What's happening right now is people  trying to buy up ownership of digital  products. In this example, the winner of this NFT would own the displayed graphic of Andre Drummond."
pretty sure its because no one cares about andre drummond
"OK, jokes aside, for say about $900 (if it closed up the bids) you likely will get to meet a NBA player and their teammates (I doubt Lebron is going to say hi, but you know Andre is doing a meet &amp; greet). Sit in some lower-level seats. Probably fly first class. And chop it up with someone who may be passionate about a shoe that could be made for some special cause.  That's worth a thousand. I think though it's $50k value is hurting heads PLUS the name value of Andre Drummond vs an internet fan favorite like say Jeremy Lin or shit, Alex Caruso.  Where's all the folks who allegedly racked up on Gamestop stocks???"
You also get:  1. Tickets for two to that game  2. Flight and hotel accommodations (for two) for that evening  3. Take home the game worn co-designed sneakers that Andre Drummond will autograph after the game and hand deliver to the purchaser of this NFT
Wow! Designing a shoe with Andre Drummond is worth at least $870! Sign me up!
"I mean seriously, Andre Drummond - Detroit Pistons??  So, Isiah Thomas, Joe Dumars, Bill Laimbeer, Ben Wallace, Chauncey Billups, Rip Hamilton, Sheed never crossed your mine?  Good night, bro."
Short of Andre Drummond everyone should be.
"&gt; even Andre Drummond if he didn't turn out to be complete dogshit  Andre gave up a whopping $790,000 to be bought out last season, the same amount he got paid by you guys to finish the season there, so he didn't lose a penny. I wish we had just fucking waived him outright just so we could say we did."
"Yep. Nobody wanted Blake Griffin or Andre Drummond at $35 million per year. The proof is they were put on waivers after being bought out and anyone willing and able to pay that could have just grabbed them. But people were willing to get them for just the minimum. If you make it so people getting them have to pay their full salary, then nobody will want them, so they won't agree to be bought out. Which situation is better: what OKC did with Kemba or what is going on in Cleveland with Kevin Love? Cause what everyone is proposing here will just ensure that we end up with a bunch of Kevin Love situations on teams all over the league."
"&gt;the team that picks them up should pay their full due salary.   All that would do is mean that none of these players would get signed elsewhere, which means they'd never agree to being bought out. The buyout is there because both the team that's paying these guys and the player getting paid are unhappy with the situation and are looking for a solution that satisfies everyone.   If someone like Blake Griffin or Andre Drummond were only eligible to be signed by teams last year who could pay their full max salary then they would never have been bought out and would have just continued to rot on their old teams, because nobody wanted to pay those guys that money. If they were worth their contracts, then they'd be trade fodder. This is typically for overpaid vets on the last year of their deal who are languishing on a lottery team. Just making them have to stay there isn't beneficial to anyone involved."
None of these buyouts should elicit that reaction. The Blake Griffin type buyouts I get (or even Andre Drummond if he didn't turn out to be complete dogshit).
Andre Drummond was a dumbass for taking a buyout.
"You can’t spell Andre Drummond without d, o, n, d, &amp; a."
"Simmons, CJ McCollum, Danny Green, Tobias Harris, Andre Drummond is a great line up for philly, good trade.  We can make up dumb trash ass trades too."
"Raptor has Andre Drummond over giannis, just from looking at it for 5 seconds."
"Literally just in the games the Hawks played there were worse. In terms of players who were worse than expected, Julius Randle took 19 shots a game on &lt;30% from the field over the series. In terms of players who were supposed to have starting roles but were extremely bad, there was Elfrid Payton. If you're just talking about overall not-goodness, then there's the fleet of garbage time players or even just Solomon Hill. How do you actually watch games and think Andre Drummond was the worst player in the playoffs?"
"Blake Griffin is the Brooklyn Nets' starting C and spent a some of the series against the Bucks' being the second best player on the team. Andre Drummond is 28 and signing with a new team. Kevin Love is still a player most teams would want on a minimum. LaMarcus Aldridge was good, and I don't think we can treat his retirement due to heart problems as typical.  Maybe bought out player used to be a waste, but that wasn't the case last season and it wouldn't be the case with Kevin Love especially since some of his poor play so clearly comes from the level of effort."
not if the Andre he's getting his name from is Andre Drummond
Major Josh Smith/Greg Monroe/Andre Drummond vibes
"We bought out Andre Drummond to save ourselves $790,000 (the exact amount he got from the Lakers to finish out their season so he didn't lose a penny personally). I'd expect Love to give up more but not really a whole lot more. I don't think Love is even physically capable of playing for an NBA team any more, so there's no financial reason for him to give up anything at all."
Yes you can be; example….Andre Drummond. Why do we do this thing every year where we pretend the man is good

"&gt; According to VORP, Andre Drummond is one of the greatest centers of all-time….and I’m not joking.  The stat is well known to be almost useless in isolation. But I'm not here to defend VORP. Where are you seeing Drummond as an all time outlier in VORP? I am inclined to believe it, since VORP overvalues defensive rebounding and that's Drummond's ace skill, but I'm not seeing it anywhere in looking. [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/drumman01.html) seems to say his best regular season VORP was less than 4. I could be reading it wrong though, I'm on my phone."
"Yea looked up the last one and saw that, being able to protect 8 leaves very little talent. Would be hard to even find a quality starter outside of a pricey veteran teams didn't want in the first place (think Andre Drummond on his last contract although I did say quality starter so maybe not him)."
Andre Drummond is an all-star
"According to VORP, Andre Drummond is one of the greatest centers of all-time….and I’m not joking."
Andre Drummond- Big Penguin
"I was talking to my friend about who the top ten players in the league are, and after I rattled off Lebron, Curry, and Durant, he goes ""ANDRE DRUMMOND."" He basically thinks numbers are everything, so he saw those big rebounding numbers and assumed Drummond was some sort of superstar."
I can’t believe Andre Drummond signed for a minimum
"The thing is Bill Laimbeer was a four-time all-star, somehow five-times the defender Andre Drummond is (which isn't saying much), cleared the glass with great aplomb (led the league), and was among the first stretch bigs, at one time holding the NBA Finals record for threes in a single game (shout out to Jack Sikma, too).   Unfortunately for his reputation (not that he cares), he found that playing the heel was quite advantageous and he began to really lean into that reputation. He loved hanging his hat on being hated, especially after the Bad Boys thing took off in the media, and he seemed comfortable with that being his legacy, so it is what it is. But dude *could* absolutely play.   On the post on another MJ-Bill interaction yesterday, in fact (at the risk of sounding repetitive), I'd mentioned how Bill had a knack for chasedown blocks, which is just about the last skill one would imagine he had. Alas.  [He got both James Worthy and Byron Scott in the same quarter of the NBA Finals.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qANRO_mfcvY&amp;ab_channel=RyanVanDusen)  [And saved Christmas in '87.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPGuFN-Ehs8&amp;ab_channel=RyanVanDusen)  [He also emerged victorious in the greatest aerial battle of our time back in 1991.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdd8AzWK6gE&amp;ab_channel=RyanVanDusen)   He played hard all the time and he played smart a lot of the time. Unfortunately, he was smart enough to know that being a jerk and vacillating between dirty fouls and legitimate defense was often enough to drive many teams and fans completely nuts.   I still watch a lot of full Pistons games from those years these days, and I'd say for 95 percent of the game, you don't notice anything particularly egregious about the way Laimbeer's playing most nights (though surely there's things happening between the lines). But that five percent that's left is often a pretty potent mix of Laimbeer whining theatrics, a way overly aggressive foul, a ridiculous flop (people remember the hammers but not so much the flops - he'd put Harden to shame), or something straight up dirty. But it was generally a small portion of the bigger picture."
couple things      1. I only watch NCAA because NBA is all isolations 2. Marcus Smart sucks 3. Andre Drummond is good
“Andre Drummond is an all star”

Andre Drummond but just his scoring
"Embiid can shoot 3’s but I wouldn’t call him a “stretch 5” he operates inside. He’s not like a Brook Lopez who will chill in the corner to stretch the floor. The backup centers Ben has been given are Boban, Greg Monroe, Dwight Howard, and now Andre Drummond. When Embiid got hurt, Ben’s rookie year, they played ersan illyasova at the 5 and Ben played like an MVP. Yes he can’t shoot. All non prime LeBron players have flaws. Imagine they made Giannis play with any of those guys now. People would shit on the FO not Giannis."

Andre Drummond at 14.. I’m gonna throw up
"Andre Drummond (14th) - ""Drummond becomes a passable free-throw shooter and an effective low-post operator to complement his prodigious abilities as a rebounder and pick-and-roll finisher. His near-20-10 production and penchant for spectacular plays earn him All-Star and All-NBA status. His work as the leader of a basketball renaissance in Detroit, though, is what gets people whispering about Drummond for MVP."""
Thanasis handling the ball like Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond is a top 5 center in the league.  Don't @ me
"The Andre Drummond effect. Bro has no true competitive bone or desire to get better. Basketball is a means to an end for him. He wants to be just good enough to make a fuck ton of money to continue being a “young socialite”. It’s crazy because just Ben’s pure talent and size is enough for him to be one of the best defenders in the league combined with just a knack for playmaking. It’s really a shame. If he had a Joel Embiid or Giannis work ethic, there is zero reason why he couldn’t be a top 5 player."
I think Embiid is secure in his position in the team and in the league that he doesn't need to be getting into it with Ben Simmons. He'll just roast Andre Drummond some more.
"1. Anthony Davis, $32,742,000 2. Steven Adams, $29,592,695 3. Nikola Jokic, $29,542,010         3. Joel Embiid, $29,542,010         5. Kristaps Porzingis, $29,467,800         5. Karl-Anthony Towns, $29,467,800  7. Andre Drummond, $28,751,774 8. Al Horford, $27,500,000 9. Nikola Vucevic, $26,000,000 10. Rudy Gobert, $25,775,281 11. LaMarcus Aldridge, $24,000,000           Look me in the eye and tell me that maxing a center doesn't come without risk."
"THE ONLY REASON I REMEMBER THE PISTONS EVEN EXIST IS COS I SEE THEIR FLAIRS CONSTANTLY IN ANDRE DRUMMOND THREADS TELLING EVERYONE ""WE TOLD YOU"""
Andre Drummond proves I’m right LOL. He puts up big numbers but he’s a backup center at 29 now. He was putting up 18 points and 16 rebounds and Detroit got a second round pick when they traded him. That proves teams don’t care about basic stat lines.
"Andre Drummond alone proves you wrong. NBA front offices most certainly place a lot of value on counting stats, otherwise he would have been out of the league years ago let alone getting opportunities on contenders."
Andre Drummond is proof GMs and coaches don't necessarily look past counting stats either.
Let me tell you a story about Andre Drummond.
I think Andre Drummond can be a good-great player with the right coach and right players around him (by right players I mostly mean an above average starting PG).
Cp3 could make Andre Drummond look good
"Hassan Whiteside, Harrison Barnes, Otto Porter, Andre Drummond, Al Horford. Max Players at one point, the stretch isn't of the imagination it's of what a max player is. He's not a super max player, but I'd argue neither is Gobert he's certainly a max player though."
As an aside this topic kind of shows how bad Andre Drummond is at the rim lol  He gets similar looks to all these people who have like 15 PPG on 60-65% TS but his efficiency is below league average despite his shot difficulty being not that high at all
"Never forget when bleacher report released a notification that read: ""Andre Drummond (avocado) will play tonight."""

"&gt; If that's your philosophy then no player in the NBA with a contract is overpaid because someone at some point was willing to pay that player that much money to play on their team.  Yes and no. Some players are on a bad contract and the team can't get out from under it. Like John Wall or Andre Drummond before they bought him out. He was clearly overpaid because they paid him a bit less to just go away. But the Warriors aren't even considering that. They like him and they're willing to pay him. And more importantly, they traded for him at this price. And they're getting pretty much what they expected. No Warriors fan would say they expected better. His ceiling before that trade is pretty much where he is. A solid NBA player who will be a great #3 on a championship caliber team. Would they have paid him a Max deal as a free agent? Probably not. But we can't sign free agents because of our cap situation. So because of that, we have to take the contracts we can get. Remember, we chose to take D-Lo as a Max guy. We didn't need to. And we turned him into Wiggins and Kuminga. So that's baked into ""overpaying"" for Wiggins. Much like if I sold you my house for 600K and you said it's too much so I threw in my boat. You didn't pay 600k for the house. I think too many fans view these situations in isolation. And you just can't. If people really think Wiggins is overpaid, you have to name me a player that is just as good and is cheaper. And you'd also have to tell me how the Warriors get that other player and pocket the difference. Because that would show that he's overpaid. Because you can replace him for less. But the Warriors have no ability to do that. Every team has to follow the rules of the league and the rules are build around the Warriors doing what they did because they wanted Wiggins at the price it costed them. So IMHO, that is his value right now. When his deal is up, it will probably be quite a bit less. More like 22 a year or something. Because that's what he will be able to command at that time. At this time, it's 31 and the Warriors said ""OK""."
idk about betting on Andre Drummond on anything
My list  ROY Scottie Barnes  6MOY Andre Drummond  DPOY Rudy Gobert  MVP Giannis
Lack of competition. I do agree this is what Javale McGee or Andre Drummond would look like if they played in that era. 100%
"&gt; Do you think Wiggins is worth 31 mil?  Too many different ways to answer that question. None of us know the Warriors financials. He could be worth 200 million to the franchise but only paid 31 because of the salary cap. We have no idea how much revenue he specifically brings to the team. Compared to Steph Curry? No way. Steph is 10X as valuable to the franchise compared to Wiggins. But is Steph underpaid or is Wiggins overpaid? Compared to John Wall and Andre Drummond? He's underpaid. My overall philosophy is that if someone wants to pay you to do something, that is what you're worth."
"It’s because he heavily underperformed in his role. Granted, we’re talking about Andre Drummond, and his role was to be the star player. They really tried to build a team around Andre Drummond."
Saw one Twitter guy say Wilt is just Andre Drummond. Why are they so stupid.
"I'm not sure why I'd need to pick between Andre Drummond thinking he's Michael Jordan and Andre Drummond thinking he's Ben Simmons.   Knowing your role is a *huge* part of understanding how to play effective basketball. Cavaliers-era Tristan Thompson was an asset because he tried to play like Tristan Thompson, not LeBron2. Clint Capela is an asset, despite his limitations, because he *knows* those limitations.   There's a reason why we never saw Mavericks-era Tyson Chandler calling for an iso on the wing or Clippers-era DeAndre Jordan looking off Chris Paul following a defensive rebound so he could run point on the break himself. Those guys knew their roles.   Whenever Andre happened to have a game where he was able to limit himself from trying to do all the things he's terrible at, he proved he could be an asset. But more times than not, especially late in his Pistons career, dude just couldn't resist a tasty 3-point attempt or one-on-one dual culminating in an off-balance contested banking runner."
"&gt;I'd have felt a lot better about Andre if he'd have just stopped trying to do the things he couldn't do.  So you'd rather have Andre Drummond have Ben Simmons' attitude, who doesn't even try because he's so scared and calls it a day?"
"For me, I'd have felt a lot better about Andre if he'd have just stopped trying to do the things he couldn't do. There were so many less talented players I would have preferred at his position during his last few years in Detroit simply because those other dudes knew what they were and what they weren't.  Like, here's what Andre's positives and negatives *should* have looked like:   **Positives**  * Clears the defensive glass  * Active on offensive glass, can cash in a tip at crucial moment  * Very capable lob finisher  **Negatives**  * Slow on defensive rotations  * Foul prone  * No touch outside of three feet  Those negatives are a bummer, but they're still workable under the right circumstances.   However, due to his own insistence of shooting himself in the foot, here's what his drawbacks really looked like:  **Actual Negatives**  * Slow on defensive rotations  * Foul prone  * Will commit frustration fouls in the backcourt  * Will slump shoulders after missed layup and give up transition opportunity while motioning toward officials and jogging downcourt during game's most crucial moments  * Will spot up for three and look for excuses to shoot said threes  * Insists on facing up from 18 feet away, leading to iso dribbling attack that culminates in [contested 14-foot floater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclERcD6cJA&amp;ab_channel=meliflewus) in the teeth of the defense  * Will force bounce passes through multiple defenders, succeeding just often enough to feel justified in continuing to thread needle  * 60 percent shooting from free throw line considered success story  * Willing to [elbow teammates for stealing rebounds](https://cavaliersnation.com/2020/05/19/andre-drummond-says-he-used-punch-former-teammate-who-kept-coming-take-his-rebounds/)  I believe he continues to receive second chances because there's an effective modern basketball player down in there somewhere and whether we ever actually see that player is largely up to Andre himself. If he could just chip away all that excess (the notion that he's a 3-point shooter and perimeter playmaker, to name a couple), you'd be left with a simple big guy who could do some simple big man things pretty well."
"We're basically the same team as last year (minus Nance Jr. who missed a lot of the season and Andre Drummond which is a positive loss) plus Mobley, Markkanen and Rubio. If Garland and Okoro improve (which is kind of normal for 2nd and 3rd year players) and *if* we're actually done tanking, we might squeak into the play-in. It would probably require a couple of teams nominally better than us to implode, but that's not impossible."
Prime Andre Drummond
"Well I hope you're wrong lol. In all fairness who tf did the lakers have when AD and bron were out? I feel like you guys were all defense. If preseason is anything to go by, our bench offense will be lots of ball movement and dribble handoffs. We have a lot of shooting and some decent quality shot creators of the bench this year. Sure if drummond could make some advanced reads that would be nice, but he really doesn't even have to do much of that. He just looks sooo much smoother with the ball in his hands than dwight. Andre just needs to not be a turnover machine with the ball in his hands, and he needs to understand his role in the offense and not do too much."
Griffin was amazing that first year after getting traded there for sure averaging 25/8/6 or something and was extremely skilled and talented. The last year and a half there though he averaged 15/5/3 and was injured or checked out mentally  Drummond was there for like 8 years averaging like 17ppg and like 15 rebounds. I’m not saying he’s better than Blake but those years before Blake were rough and Andre was thier best player by far  They shouldn’t boo him
"I mean you can make an offense work with all kinds of flawed players but Andre Drummond isn't making a team better even with his 15 rpg. Capela is another guy who is a solid player, gets a bunch of rebounds, and doesn't make his team drastically better. If either of those guys were adept passers they would be far more valuable and far more impactful players. There's a reason Jokic won MVP last year. Rebounding, while important, is far less important than offensive flow and chemistry which is what passing bigs create."
"I feel like rebounding is almost certainly the least important unless its offensive rebounding  A lot of ""empty stats"" players(Andre Drummond) are guys who get a lot of rebounds but don't do much else"
"On the contrary, I thought he was a good pick at the time, particularly when looking who was selected immediately behind him. In order, from the ninth pick onward:  * Andre Drummond  * Austin Rivers  * Meyers Leonard  * Jeremy Lamb  * Kendall Marshall   * John Henson   * Mo Harkless  * Royce White  * Tyler Zeller  * Terrence Jones  Drummond showed lots of promise early in his career. I still remember, maybe one of his first preseason games, when he was out there being a massive presence on both sides of the floor, eating rebounds, active defensively, and [then he did this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K28SAm0RsNk&amp;ab_channel=PissStains). It felt like we'd landed a monster who'd be capable of anchoring the franchise.   And truly, when he only did the things he was build to do, he *was* an asset. If he just dunked basketballs, always made his presence felt defensively (blocking shots, affecting shots, knowing his rotations and making those rotations, throwing keen outlet passes), ran the floor, and gave 100 percent effort, the entire franchise would have been better off. He'd do that at times in the mid-2010's and we'd see some solid stretches of team basketball as a result.   But at some point, it became clear that rotating on defense wasn't really a thing he was all about, that he was never going to develop a post game—even a rudimentary jump hook that he could hit at an average clip, that he was going to want to start shooting 3-pointers and taking players off the dribble before shooting floaters through their chest. By the end, all the most toxic elements of his game completely overshadowed his positives (clearing the glass, finishing lobs).   By the end, his game was basically the basketball personification of hubris."
"Yeah, I generally feel like booing people is reserved for things players personally did that run contrary to the city or organization (sketchy comments, holding out, trade demands out of nowhere, etc.)  That said, sometimes your game does the talking. And over those last few years in Detroit, Andre Drummond's game was so stubborn, frequently lackadaisical, and generally held captive by his own misconceived notions of who he was and what he could do that I think a lot of folks were at the end of their rope with this guy by the time he left. I mean, it's not every day a player in his 20's with two all-star appearances gets swapped for a pile of rubbish then subsequently waived.   It's not his fault he got paid the way he did in Detroit. He showed promise when he was young and the team had to either pay up, lose him for nothing, or trade a 20-year-old projecting upward. However, the parts of his game he often struggled at the most—insisting on shooting 14-foot floaters, spotting for three, taking off with a live dribble then trying to thread a bounce pass through a pile of defenders, getting mentally bested by opposing centers, committing ill-timed fouls, missing so many point blank layups, slumping his shoulders and giving up a fast break the other way when made a poor decision—was pretty much a Top 10 list of ways to get on your fan base's bad side.   So, while I generally just ""nothing"" this guy (beyond being thankful the Drummond era's over), I do kind of understand others who felt booing him may be therapeutic."

"Honestly things would be looking real sweet right now if we could have avoided alienating our starting point guard at the end of last season.    Isaiah Joe shot ~60% from three on high volume over the course of four pre-season games. Kork looks like Olympic Kork. Maxey is continuing to progress as you'd expect, he played very well in SL and pre-season. Niang is going to be a *very* good addition for us, especially if we can eventually get Ben engaged and playing normally. He's the kind of stretch big we have been trying to get for years. Basically he replaced Mike Scott, but we'll actually play him because, ya know, he's still good. And Andre Drummond is the perfect backup for Embiid. He can get his in the post, play very good defense, pass a bit, and is still a monster on the boards. Also, and I didn't know how important this was, but he won't get a tech once every two games.   So yeah it all depends on how this Ben stuff works out. Maybe don't shit on players you still need."
"&gt;	SVG's stints in Detroit and New Orleans showed that he's just not as adaptable he was back with the Heat and Magic where he was more readily able to make use of the talent on those squads.  How did the Lakers make use of the tremendous talent of Andre Drummond? When SVG was coaching the Pistons, Drummond was still widely viewed as having a huge amount of potential.  But it’s clear now, in hindsight, that no coach can turn Drummond into a centerpiece. I don’t think he deserves blame for that.   It’s also important to consider that 2 of our starting point guards went down with injury under SVG. Before his injury, Reggie Jackson was performing very well."
"Josh Smith - Greg Monroe - Andre Drummond is a legitimate lineup this buffon fielded. He played three centers that can’t shoot for months……….  Sure he was good nearly 20 years ago, but he’s not good at all anymore"
This is why Hassan Whiteside is Andre Drummond Lite.      Only difference is that in a contract year for Whiteside he becomes serviceable.
Did this guy really say Cleveland’s problem was not keeping Andre Drummond and getting Jarrett Allen instead? What a clown.
"There's not really the stats to back up that he was holding the ball to much. He passed a decent amount, especially for a combo guard. The team had absolutely no shooting around him and most of our bigs last year had poor hands around the rim. I just don't know what the alternative was. Our efficient budding star should shoot less so that Larry nance and andre drummond could handle the ball more? Or okoro who was pretty horrid most of the year?"
He’s Andre Drummond type of good. He can get good stats but that probably means you’re losing
Andre Drummond is a gift to the league because he shows who in the media actually watches games and who watches box scores only.
"The way I look at it, Andre Drummond had just a shred of Ben Wallace’s defensive effort, hustle, and know-how yet still came out as a 15 &amp; 15 all-star in the modern era. It’s not hard for me to imagine Ben grabbing 15 boards a night while being a versatile defensive presence without all the unnecessary garbage Andre tried to impose upon his own team every night.  Regarding Ben’s offense, I think he’d benefit in today’s game. Back then, the Pistons liked to throw him a bone every now and again to make him happy and included in their offense. They’d generally do this by giving him a low percentage post touch (Larry Brown would often call the very first play of the game for him just to get it out of the way).  In today’s game, there wouldn’t be any real disillusions about placing Ben in post up scenarios to keep him happy. They’d just run him in a few pick-and-rolls and let him go get the ball at the rim for some bunnies. Yes, he had smallish hands, [but he was still more than capable of successful rim runs](https://youtu.be/I-t5pjxRmJk).  There’d still be shortcomings to be accounted for (free throws, shooting ability) but the modern game has a place for guys like him, and I think he could flourish."
His basketball IQ is about as low as it gets. He was constantly out of position and in the way of cutting teammates. He can’t finish at the rim and has awful touch. He’s a decent rebounder but his rebounding numbers were inflated due to him getting a lot of his own misses. He’s basically a poor mans Andre Drummond.
"Lmao i gave u the analysis u wanted then u called me a fanboy. Great counter argument. I also love the point where u completely ignored the reasoning for me mentioning Andre Drummond and keeping at surface level interpretation. The stats u provided to counter my argument were also very intriguing, so intriguing that I can’t even see them. I can tell u thought you got me when u told me to adjust to strength of schedule. U sounded so confident then. But now, after i gave u what u asked for, u got desperate and went to calling me a fanboy instead. Where did the confidence go?  So since you obviously either (1) cant read or understand what i said, (2) didnt read what i said, or (3) twist it so u have some type of argument, let me give a in-depth conclusion to the stats provided for your illiterate ass:  Lebron’s hardest games were &gt;&gt; AD’s hardest games. Lebron played 3 games against #1 and #2 seeds, AD played 1. Although AD did win, he had to put up a 42 point performance to pull it off, not sustainable for an entire season. What’s more concerning for AD’s side is that the Ws he scraped out were extremely close and could’ve easily gone either way, whereas the games he lost were (mostly) complete blowouts. He’s not gonna maintain a 3-4 win rate for an entire season if that’s they way they play. However, on the flip side, Lebron gets comfortable wins, which gives him time to rest to compete in the closer games against better teams. Lebron is more likely to surpass his 5-5 win rate than AD is to maintain is 3-4 win rate. Also noting how they play against injured teams. Lebron got a comfortable win against Portland without CJ and Nurkic. However, AD only got a 4 point win against Denver who were without Murray, Milsap and Gordon. That’s not a good sign for a team.   Now about the Andre Drummond point. The whole point of the Drummond point was thay he takes away some load of responsibility from AD. He’s another Centre in the post who can take the rebounding role away from AD, so that AD can focus more on contributing to the scoring. This way, it’s easier for AD to stay efficient without burning as much energy. However, Lebron didn’t have a backup playmaker or rebounder to take away some load of responsibility. Hence, all his responsibility on the court increases, with aspect where he can rely one someone else to carry out for him. That’s vital since despite the fact that AD can focus more on being efficient in lesser aspects of his game, he still can’t get his team to comfortable wins in games where they should. Lebron, despite taking a heavier load, is not only able to accomplish this, but will also scrape out some Ws against better teams when he can stay close, as seen here, across a 70+ game season.   Hence, i bring up the point differential. Lebron wins games in a way larger proportion than he loses. AD is the opposite, despite having an advantage over Bron as seen above.   Therefore, in a 70+ game season,  Lebron’s Lakers will have a better record than AD’s Lakers.   Conclusion: A Laker team with only AD wouldnt be a 7 seed, but at best, play-in race. A Laker team with only Lebron will be good enough for a 7-8 seed in the play-in race at worst.   If you can sarcastically call this top level stuff, I’d like to see what u can offer, if u can that is. So please, show me your brilliance."
"It would take longer to list the ones he is better than over the reverse. Shit Cody Zeller is better than him and our bench isn’t even good.   Andre Drummond, Hassan whiteside, Zubac, kanter, Zeller, Dwight Howard all better just off the top of my head and I’m sure I’m forgetting some"
The problem is he will play at a high level again once he is somewhere else. He will never be a lights out shooter but he can play point forward and dominate defensively.  His attitude is awful no doubt and I too suffered the Andre Drummond era but Simmons has mich higher potential than Drummond.  They do share a “motor” problem however.  I think he will play well but never be a “winner.”
"Ben Simmons is doing all this cuz he got his feelings hurt. Literally throwing a tantrum, and doing all this shit, cuz people rightfully called him out for playing like shit.   If Doc went Mike Singeltary and did the whole ""can't win with this guy. He's a loser"", I could understand; but Ben is the worst offensive player I've ever seen. And I'm a Pistons fan who recently went thru the Andre Drummond debacle.   Ben Simmons has lost any and all trade value. Not jus cuz of his immature attitude, but because his game is weak. What kind of point guard, in today's game, literally can't shoot beyond 6 feet from the rim. And even when he has an open layup, he's so insecure he passes it up.   If Philly fans think they're getting more than a used bag of soap, y'all trippin.."
Lmao. I love how you did the entire analysis and then concluded on the basis of a 3-4 versus a 5-5 record than one was better. Despite openly admitting that that the AD had stronger opponents. Top level fan boying man.   Particularly enjoyed the part about using Andre Drummond as reason why the won more games after every single Laker fan yelling about how horrible he is. Top level stuff man
"Lakers Records vs Teams who made the play-in and above with notable opponent players who were injured, DNP, or have yet to be acquired.   Without AD but with Lebron:  1. 109-98 L vs BKL (missing KD) 2. 96-94 L vs MIA (missing Dragic, Oladipo) 3. 127-124 L vs WAS 4. 114-89 L vs UTA 5. 102-93 W vs POR(missing McCollum, Nurkic) 6. 117-91 W vs GSW 7. 114-104 L vs PHX  8. 105-100 W vs IND 9. 128-97 W vs GSW 10. 116-105 W vs CHA  With AD but without Lebron:  1. 108-93 L vs DAL (missing Prozingis, Boban) 2. 116-107 L vs WAS 3. 93-89 W vs DEN (missing Murray, Milsap, Gordon) 4. 118-94 L vs LAC 5. 106-101 L vs POR (missing Derrick Jones Jr.) 6. 123-110 W vs PHX 7. 101-99 W vs NYK  Noteworthy: Andre Drummond was already acquired by April 24, when AD returned from injury.   Results:  Lebron 5-5. From here, 3 of Lebron’s losses came against #1 and #2 seeds. Also from the games played, the point differential was +31 in favor of the Lakers. This means that their losses were closer games than their wins, which were mostly blowouts.   AD 3-4. The Lakers may boast some better Ws in this collumn, but remember that this was with the addition of Andre Drummond, a key Centre that can take load from AD as they play the same position. The Lakers were also -33 in point differntial. This means that they barely squeaked out the 3 Ws but were blown out in the other 4, which is true.   In this small sample size, it’s clear that in a long term scenario, the Lakers with Lebron’s performance is undoubtedly way more fit to perform consistently throughout the season, winning games they’re supposed to win and staying close in games where they’re the underdogs. For the Lakers performance with AD, they may get some scrappy wins, but it’s not a reliable way to win throughout 70+ games.   The Lakers with Lebron &gt;&gt; The Lakers with AD"
"My genuine response: Who is that slow guy wearing number 6. Looks like Andre Drummond out there.    Oh, that’s Lebron"
Is it just me or do John Collins and Jordan Poole look like they could be related? Kind of like Norman Powell and Andre Drummond.
"And the 2016 Cavs beat the Andre Drummond Pistons, Paul Millsap Hawks, and the Raptors again in the east lol"
"How so? It shows he is level headed and hard working? If my 4-6th best player on my team was thinking he was anything like Luka that would disappoint me tbh, thats how you get Andre Drummond. Unless ofc I was an all-star team coach, in which case it might be true"
"Andre Drummond is why the eye test is important.  Statistics and numbers are great and we should make use of them. But they have absolutely no context and can miss out on a lot of things, too. It’s by watching games that you find out Drummond is terrible"

"Yup. Partied with Andre Drummond over a decade ago. I was visiting my uncle in New York (state not city) and went to a party with my cousin. Met this Irish/black dude who was a rapper named Kid Finneran who was doing whip-its. Andre was curious , we told him it was nitrous like the dentist uses, he asked if you could be tested for it, we said no. He said ""good because I'm probably going to the NBA."" At the time I thought he was joking lmao because I had never heard of him. But yeah we did nitrous and probably took some shots? Not a lot sticks out in my memory. But he was fucking huge, even then, and he couldn't have been much older than me, maybe 17"
"For that contract yes, that's fair. Not quite as cringe for the Suns organization itself but I'm thinking of a Andre Drummond scenario (who I know loved the Pistons) but instead he had a good contract yet complained his way out of Phoenix then didn't get nearly as good of a contract elsewhere"
I was gonna say the same thing lol. Andre Drummond is honestly not a good player
I've been around on various accounts for about the last 7 or so years. The sub always has a certain few players that they just LOVE then completely drop later. Tobias Harris and Andre Drummond were two big ones.
i bet KD talking mad shit to andre Drummond lol
If Andre Drummond knew what to do with the ball in his hands for longer than three seconds he'd probably be as good as Wilt was
Wilt was just a better Andre Drummond. You can try and prove me wrong
"&gt; Asked who is starting at point guard, Doc Rivers smiled and said “we’ll have one”.  Translation: “Do I look like I have a clue? It won’t be Andre Drummond, that’s about all I know at this point.”"
I don't understand why Andre Drummond is relevant
"Ben has Andre Drummond elbow him in the face, then gets 13 root canals in one day."
"For what it’s worth, the defensive metrics weren’t super kind to AD as a rookie defender. Idk what that means and don’t have enough memory of rookie AD to put context to it, but watching Mobley, I highly highly doubt that is the case for him.   Stop here unless you want to read my fan boy take.   I’ve seen a ton of Jarret Allen, Larry Nance jr, Javale McGee and Andre Drummond the past year. Maybe it’s bias, maybe it’s wishful thinking, or something else. The most impactful defender today might be Mobley. Allen is more steady and fundamental,  Javale is longer, Nance is stronger and has fewer lapses, and Drummond may fill up the stat sheet more, but none of them have his combo of skill, athleticism, versatility and iq and he occasionally flashes that elite elite Gobert, Draymond, Kawhi and etc level of just knowing almost exactly what’s going to happen and just beating guys to the spot."
"We’ve seen regular season Rondo, Danny Green try to dribble the ball, Avery Bradley initiate an offense, Javale McGee post ups, Kyle Kuzma, and Andre Drummond play 25 minutes a night. Russ’s turnovers are coming from him being too unselfish, so I’m not worried at all about the preseason."
"lol no, 6MOY players are normally 6”2 guards that play no defense and scores 20 off the bench      Andre Drummond is a fat 6”10 big man who does nothing but clog the lane and ruins his teams offensive flow by bricking 5 putbacks per possession"
andre drummond 6th man of the year
Andre Drummond: causing injuries in sports since Super Mario 64
"No normal person would read this tweet and think “oh Drummond injured Shake, Fuck Drummond…”   It obviously reads that Shake injured himself, and Andre was involved in the play.   Some people are so sensitive Jesus Christ. Ben has turned everyone into pansies stg."
This is fueling my Andre Drummond hate wagon
"Poole averaged 12ppg in 20mpg last season and he didnt even get any momentum for first half of the season bcs of Wanamaker. No reason to not believe he cant average 18ppg in 30+mins.  Nemanja has always been a solid stretch big just that he didnt get any playing time on the Heat. Iggy is old but his perimeter defense was still good last season with the heat. Agree with the OPJ injury issue which is why I said assuming everyone is healthy bcs if you want to take into account injury theres a high chance Porzingis will be out this season as well. Reggie Bullock is the only good addition. Isnt Bruce Brown with the Nets lol? And Moses Brown is only good if you look at the box score, hes basically Andre Drummond Jr, if you watched enough Thunder games last season you will understand, or maybe you can ask any Thunder fans"
"At the time, the general consensus was that DeAndre Ayton had an incredible body and and phenomenal athleticism, but didn't have the best feel for the game. Like Andre Drummond. There was a solid chance that he'd flame out; it was a high risk/high reward pick"
Hahahah fuck man don’t let me think of Andre Drummond demanding the ball in the post
"PER isn’t adding any contribution to player evaluations. It ironically undervalues efficiency and assists, ignores non-box defense, and overvalues scoring, rebounding and steals. PER has a fetish for offensive rebounding. It has JV 67th, Greg Monroe 77th, Enes Kanter 60th and Andre Drummond 38th all time. The margin of error is just so high. It’s worthless."
I block Book's shit all day.  As Andre Drummond in 2K.  As close to real life as you can get
Sixers legends Greg Monroe and Andre Drummond
Andre gets some serious hate (and some deservedly so) but his situation was terrible. Never forget the Greg Monroe/Drummond pairing!
Andre Drummond. Pistons wasted damn near a decade trying to win with him and never making it out of the first round.
andre drummond
Dwight 'Andre Drummond' Howard 😂
"For those who don't know, he's a 20yo 6'6 200lb forward that's so good at rebounding he's been getting most of his minutes at centre. He was competing for boards with Andre fucking Drummond, and has a really nice touch around the rim"
Lakers fans are not the only fan base that share that sentiment about Andre Drummond. You getting excited over a couple of preseason games lol.
Kinda hard to make that argument when Lakers fans will hate on solid players like Danny Green and still act like they are no bonafide scrubs despite having good seasons elsewhere.  And even now the consensus is that Andre Drummond barely even deserves a roster spot after one underwhelming season with LA
"Andre Drummond and I don't think it is close. He has left fans of three franchises scratching there heads thinking, ""what the fuck is that? I didn't know we signed up to watch that."""
"Then he whines to everyone when you don't accept.   ""Jager said he wanted blocks yet he keeps rejecting fair trades nobody trade with him""  /resends trade offer Dwight Howard and Andre Drummond for Damian Lillard"
Andre Drummond being a great rebounder. He sucks otherwise on your team
"If health/availability is a valid metric for this then Kyrie Irving is the obvious answer for me, if we're just talking from an on court ability perspective I'd go with Andre Drummond"

Andre Drummond is so dumb
Watching Andre Drummond play basketball is a painful experience.
Andre. Drummond.
"The simple counting math may not technically lie, but the problem is **what is measured** isn't always a good reflection of what happened:  - Like some players (Ben Simmons seems one) who may get assists without really doing anything other than handing it off to another player for a ""not great quality"" shot... but the 76ers have a lot of good shooters, so they may still make the shot, and Simmons gets a useless assist.  - Or players like Andre Drummond who may get a lot of rebounds, but aren't necessarily helping their team (I saw a post a few weeks ago that mentioned he even elbows teammates in the face for taking ""his"" rebounds).   And **what isn't measured** is important too:  - Blocks get measured, but causing a shot to be badly altered is just as useful.   I'm still big on analytics, but teams should measure more factors... and probably do, just privately."

The only thing a stat line like this means from Andre Drummond is a Sixers loss.
Mostly Capela.  Dude was integral to the defensive foundation and also as an outlet for Trae in the PNR.  He’s been looking worse than Andre Drummond tbh.

Bruh people be talking ab him like he's Andre Drummond lol  It do be rough being a Harden and AD stan on this sub. Atleast my next 2 favorite players Jokic and Steph are well liked
Winning is important but not rebounding is more important for Andre Drummond
My main take away from this is that Andre Drummond is still in the NBA
Well if there is one thing we can rely Andre Drummond to do its rebound
Andre Drummond collecting every rebound and losing the game is as iconic as it gets.
"8 offensive rebounds, and they couldn't have all been from his own missed shots because he made 5 out of 9 FGA? This is a new Andre Drummond we've never seen before."
find you something to love as much as andre drummond loves rebounds

"Ha, Andre Drummond with 25 rebounds."
Andre Drummond begs to differ
Most empty stats player?  Can I interest you in one Andre Drummond?
he should’ve played better to boost his trade value. He’s not getting the Andre Drummond treatment from us we’re not one of those organizations.
Now that Andre Drummond is actually real good it’s Russ now for the empty stats king
Just wait til he does dumbshit in the Playoffs like playing Paul Reed and Andre Drummond on the floor at the same time with Thybulle or something
He has the touch of Andre Drummond. He somehow only shoots about 50% within 5 feet
"Wasn't David Lee like Andre Drummond, a 20/10 machine but didn't exactly win you games?    Vs Draymond who's thr opposite, doesn't stuff the stat sheets every night but WILL win you the game with his defensive/offensive plays"
"and the sixers are probably fucked if embiid gets a substantial injury. behind him they have, what, andre drummond? there's a chance that curry, thybulle, maxey, green, can carry that team to a 5-8 spot, but i think without embiid or simmons, they'd be struggling."
"https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/12/1/16722538/detroit-pistons-andre-drummond  They went on a 7 game losing streak starting the night this was published lol. Finished the year with 33 wins, obviously missing the playoffs."
That doesn’t mean it doesn’t over-value rebounding though. When Andre Drummond and Clint Capela are finishing top 15-20 consistently in any all in one stat it’s probably time  to find a better one

"I love how Andre Drummond plays like he's 38, but is actually younger than Anthony Davis."
Andre Drummond is a poor man's DeAndre Jordan.
Was Andre Drummond being poorly utilized by his past coaches?  Something about the Philly system seems to keep him locked in and focused.
On the other hand he doesn't have to spend a big chunk of his play time getting tackled by Andre Drummond or some equally big dude.
He is the Andre Drummond of guards
Lmao they thought Andre Drummond could carry the team while Bron and AD were injured cause they saw his box score stats from Detroit
Andre Drummond becoming a guy who makes some really good passes and embracing his role for Philly is really good for them and really frustrating for opponents.
"He's a 20/10 guy on a sub 20 win team. Andre Drummond was also a 20/10 guy on a trash team. When you're a center getting 25+ usg% on a trash team, you'll get counting stats."
"You guys are hating on DJ, but I’ll take him over the Andre Drummond experience we just went through"
"yeah, i think he's working with what he can get though, so it's always going to look shit. like he got JV when he could have gotten andre drummond. seems like a win, right?"
Because he hasn’t played next to Durant and actually cares about playing team first basketball?  And recently he hasn’t been traded around like sloppy seconds to end up where is now so he can officially put the nail in the coffin of LeBron ever winning a championship again.   He’s Andre Drummond in point guard form.  Yes he has lots of triple doubles. He’s also singlehandedly devalued the triple double.
Pretty good honesty. Tyrese Maxey and Andre Drummond have both been very good. Georges Niang has suddenly been god. A little worried about Embiid’s health and the sixers letting him play through injury tho
"[Here's a video of Andre Drummond drilling corner 3s in practice.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=B45gixnxnaU)  Obviously he doesn't take them in game because shooting 3s during an NBA game while exhausted, sweaty, with crowd noise, NBA defense, etc etc is much different than in a gym, but I would be surprised if there are more than like 2 NBA players who can't shoot 50% from three in practice"
Andre Drummond. Who knew?!
Agreed. And that's why I'd trade suggs for Andre Drummond based on their current performance and our understanding of ceilings
That's also an organizational failure. Hold the guy accountable. This is looking like Ben Simmons 2.0/Detroit Andre Drummond pt 3
"When you have to watch him night in and night out on your team you start to get it. I was initially excited to take a dice roll on him for cheap and hope he could work it out in Cleveland. He had a solid start to the year for the Cavs last year albeit inefficient. But as the weeks went on the inefficiency never improved as he continued to force himself as a focal point of the offense and the defensive effort and impact became less and less. By the time he was done in Cleveland he had averaged the most field goal attempts per game while also averaging his worst shooting percentage (~48%) of his career for the stint.  I think Andre Drummond is an undeniably talented player, much more talented than an average vet minimum center. But I am also under the impression that Andre thinks he is much better than he really is. And that attitude and belief does not benefit the team nor himself as he tends not to always play towards his strengths. If Andre played within himself and his skill set he would definitely have been looking at better contract offers last summer."
yeah pretty much interchangeable with embiid.  trade that always injured loser for the great andre drummond.  hes on a vet min.  he will lead them to the promised i mean processed land.  what a lad.  certified legend. epic!

"They probably would've if they could  &gt; The Lakers promised Drummond a starting role to secure his commitment in free agency, according to two people familiar with the situation who were not authorized to discuss it publicly.  https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/6/9/22525651/lakers-rumors-andre-drummond-promised-starting-job-in-buyout-free-agency"
So you're saying that andre drummond is about to be like Hakeem as he starts the second half of his career?!
Generational talent Andre Drummond
Thx for the reminder. I'll let it slide cuz Andre Drummond just decimated you guys. Call it a wash
"Joel ""Jusuf Nurkic"" Embiid and Andre ""Big Honey Penguin"" Drummond"

They ran into a motherfucking surprise in Andre Drummond
PRIME ANDRE DRUMMOND
Andre Drummond triple double watch
Andre Drummond today (as of right now):  - 6 PTS  - 8 REB  - 3 AST  - 3 STL  - 0 TO
Sixers lose 125 - 104  Andre Drummond broke Wilts scoring record tho
"I dont think being all NBA is that big of an accomplishment during those years, there was no other big men worthy of those awards. His contemporaries around that time were Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Karl Anthony-Towns. Not exactly other future first ballot hall of famers. Getting voted to the all star game is the same thing, who cares about the center all star spot, his competition at the time was Rudy Gobert, someones whose entire future legacy will be based around covid.  Statistical leader doesnt mean anything either, Chris Kaman was a 20/10 player not to long ago, stats are easy on non-playoff teams.  Also I never said he was a bad player, only that his accomplishments rang really hollow because NO sucked, and the one time he did do something in the playoffs, it was off the back of Jrue playing at an incredible level."
"I didn't really follow Moses Brown all that much but a lot of OKC fans were suggesting he's a second coming of Andre Drummond. I'm not a fan of Josh Richardson by any means, but the contract he signed was very obviously for salary matching purposes in the future."
Andre Drummond?
"Andre Drummond must be one of the best big men in the league then. You can’t debate that, it’s just stats"
"There's a thousand Buddy Hield age threads, but the one that really trips me up is that he's older than Andre Drummond."
That killed me lol   Even if you’re not a fan of Derozan how tf is he worth less than Andre Drummond???
"This is your reminder that John Hollinger had DeMar DeRozan as the 12th most valuable free agent this year, valued less then 500k more per year then Andre Drummond and Bruce Brown, 4 mill a year less then Danny Green, and 8 million less a year then Duncan Robinson.  Thank you for your time, good night."
Andre Drummond really answers the question what would happen if you put a very tall oak tree into a NBA basketball game.
"His overall point is right. If you dropped George Mikan into today's NBA a guy like Andre Drummond would shit all over him. You can't really do a 1:1 comparison like that though because you'd have to assume Mikan would have access to modern training, coaching, etc and who knows how things would turn out."
"I don’t have to watch the games to make the one point I’ve made so far, which is that Lowrys scoring has sucked. I never said he was bad. Stop trying to turn the argument into something it’s not.   The Andre Drummond point just shows you’re just looking for an excuse to ride Lowry and bitch about people criticizing him lmao. Take a minute to actually read what you’re replying to before replying."
"Yes a elite playmaker like Lowry is incredibly important. You don’t watch the games so your opinion invalid completely, going off stats you’d think Andre Drummond is one of the best centers in the league. I thought a spurs fan after watching someone like Tim Duncan who towards the end of career wasn’t putting up godly numbers but was still extremely important to the team would understand this. I guess your 12 years old and only look at stats."
I doubt Andre Drummond is a 70% shooter from anywhere on the court
"Shooting Splits From 24+ Feet: (No 30+ one unfortunately)  1) Steph Curry: 336 FGM, 42.7% FG%  2) Buddy Hield: 281 FGM, 39.1% FG%  3) Damian Lillard: 275 FGM, 39.3% FG%  4) Duncan Robinson: 250 FGM, 40.8% FG%  5) Terry Rozier: 222 FGM, 39% FG%   &amp;#x200B;  Source: [https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shooting/?sort=24%2B%20ft.%20FGM&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;DistanceRange=8ft%20Range](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shooting/?sort=24%2B%20ft.%20FGM&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;DistanceRange=8ft%20Range)   &amp;#x200B;  The other way is me manually looking at certain players shooting splits.

Andre Drummond is plagued by trying to do too much. He would be great if he didn’t think he had to do everything. Unfortunately his career has shown us that he wants to do everything and he cannot.
"Yeah young dirk spin move to dunk was insane.    Historically, good centers coming out of college are actually so bouncy and athletic its insane how just like 4-6 years later the same centers develop in different ways to stay in the lineup.     Got off topic but people watching young orlando shaq would be blown away if theyve only seen heat shaq. And if we stay relevant to our era, the best examples are dwight howard(he had his athleticism a bit longer) and blake griffin to an extreme. But even someone like andre drummond used to be extremely athletic and not just hops, he was real quick as well."
Just a refresher course for everybody.  https://www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2017/12/1/16722538/detroit-pistons-andre-drummond
"Andre Drummond being Joel Embiid's cheerleader on the bench, what a time to be alive."
"He definitely wants to play, he’s a tough competitive guy. Kemba, Blake Griff, and Andre Drummond are recent players that have given up some money to get bought out. It helps both parties, the org saves some money on and off the books while the player loses that money but can make it up with a new team of his choice. Ultimately I think he will reduce his salary by 3-5M this and next season and he should be able to recoup that like kemba did with his new team"
"Enes Kanter, Andre Drummond too."
"Prime Deandre Jordan wouldn’t even be top 5 Centers in current league today  He would be less impactful than Embiid, Jokic, KAT, Bam, Sabonis, Gobert  I’d throw Nurkic in there too but Nurk been playing really bad.  Prime Deandre Jordan was more or less the bigger stronger Clint Capela  By far Deandre Jordan and Andre Drummond are the worst All NBA selections in recent memory.. simply due to the fact that league was lacking hard at talented centers during those years"
And Andre Drummond lol. Although I'm sure that even with 16 boards per game he'd be a neutral player at most in a playoff series.  /edit: just checked Drummond's bbref page. I knew he sucked at free throws but he's currently shooting a horrible 46%TS and has been below league average for his entire career. Wow that's really bad for a guy that pretty much only scores once he's 2 feet away from the basket.
"Plumlee is only making $8mil. So they aren't paying him more than the Wood offer. Still a silly signing.   Mason Plumlee will have made $72mil in the NBA when this 3-year contract ends. How is that possible!?!?!  (Honestly though, Plumlee's advanced stats make him look far better than I would have guessed. By WS/48, he's barely distinguishable from Andre Drummond.)"
Andre Drummond????
"Andre Drummond, deandre Jordan type of can’t shoot can rebound"
"A locked in Andre Drummond definitely is. Problem with him is his effort comes and goes. He can go out there and get you 15/15 in his sleep, but if you catch him on the wrong night, then you see he's actually getting owned on defense by fucking Bismack Biyombo."
Andre Drummond would have been a 10x all-star if he was born 15 years earlier. Other guys of that more traditional big man mould too

The Andre Drummond double double.  The most empty double double you’ll see. He basically scores the extra points and grabs the extra rebounds when the game is pretty much over.
Giannis put up his own crazy statline of 28/12/6 on great efficiency and lead his team to the best record in the NBA though.   There is a serious argument to be made for both players yet you're talking about the award like they handed it to Andre Drummond.
"Oh Siakam played next to Ibaka and Gasol.. it’s like he’s a PF and those other guys are centers.. wow such sharp observation!   Now you really got me thinking about Blake Griffin playing next to Deandre Jordan or Andre Drummond, and how losing both front court partners that provide so much really really turned Blake into a shell of himself.. but wait that is not how it is at all!  Or unless you’re saying Ibaka and Gasol are actually the Pascal whisper and that he can’t hit open shots without them?"

"As a Pistons fan, this makes me happy. His biggest issue in Detroit was the unrealistic expectations thrust upon him. We all wanted him to be a high scoring go-to starting shooting guard but that wasn't his destiny, so he struggled in trying to be something he wasn't.  Dude seemed like he could fit well within a team that already had go-to players. In a way, his status sort of reminds me of Andre Drummond. In Detroit, we paid and treated Andre like he was supposed to be Hakeem Olajuwon when he's actually more similar to a less motivated Tyson Chandler. Andre could be an asset on the right team, it just has to be in the proper role, which I'm glad to see KCP find in LA."
I died when I saw John wall below Caris levert and andre drummond...
"Andre Drummond as well, what’s your point?"
I know it’s extremely early in the season but we are 4-2 right now. Hoping to be roughly 30-42 by the end of the season and enough for a play-in spot for the playoffs. Or we say fuck it and can dump Andre Drummond somehow at the trade deadline
You guys want Andre Drummond?
Andre Drummond?
Andre Drummond
"Andre Drummond. But I really hope he can do well. I thought him, Hassan Whiteside, and Boogie would be future of the NBA bigmen. Drummond can still live up to that."
"As a UConn fan, AD meant Andre Drummond and I feel bad that I think that's the basketball AD and not Anthony Davis"
"I recognize Kris Dunn, Andre Drummond and Pau Gasol, but why did you list Lydon B Johnson??   A. He's not a basketball player.   B. He's deceased."
Andre Drummond
"Yeah man, everybody knows KD is Kris Dunn, AD is Andre Drummond, PG is Pau Gasol, and LBJ is LeBarcus Jousins."
"mutumbo is so overrated. when it comes down to it, andre drummond will have a superior career compared to mutumbo."
"Yeah, I mentioned in another comment that even trading MPJ may not have been enough for the role he wants. His game is reminiscent of Kawhi to me (though not necessarily with such a high ceiling), and it’s a skill set worth trying to capitalize on.  In terms of leaving as a free agent over not being the first option, as opposed to staying somewhere and remaining as a first option (Giannis), moving to a different franchise but being the first option on either team (Kawhi to Clippers or Durant to Nets), the most recent examples that come to my mind are James Harden to the Rockets or possibly Jimmy Butler to the Bulls (though that was a messier situation).  Usually when someone moves for a bigger role it seems like a sixth man wants to start at wing, not that someone wants to take over a franchise. But who’s going to box out Jerami Grant, Andre Drummond? Good for him if he can do it."
Can I offer you a slightly used DPOY candidate Andre Drummond?
I have seen this so many times this year as a Cavs fan watching Andre Drummond.
3 point shot made the game considerably better. You really want Andre Drummond to be a better player than Steph Curry?
Well before it was because Andre Drummond would have a 20/20 game
"Honestly havin a good time with the Cavs. Strange but they got Javale taking threes every game, SexLand is goin strong, they got point guard Andre Drummond doing 4 assists a game, i'm having fun with them"
"My friends brother was a bench player that played against Andre Drummond when they were in high school  He went up for a lay up, and Drummond fouled him  To this day he says that Drummond couldnt guard him lol"
The reasonable answer in my opinion is that tall players have an advantage at the rim.  No one asks why Clint Capella or Andre Drummond play close to the hoop.  Those two and Simmons are all 6’10”.
No one asks why Clint Capella or Andre Drummond shoot from so close to the hoop.  All three players are 6’10”.  You have an advantage at the rim so use it.
"The crazy part is he’s 6’10” - if he played a different position, no one would question why he doesn’t shoot threes.  No one sits around asking why Clint Capella or Andre Drummond don’t shoot more threes."
Andre drummond
Rebounding????? Lol. Andre Drummond averages a million reb.s.     No one cares.    No one cares about boards.
He didn’t want to stay because he was forced into a bench role behind Andre fucking Drummond on a shitty team that was going nowhere. In a contract year no less.   There isn’t a player in the league with his talent that would’ve come back to that

"Why would the Celtics ever trade any one of Tatum, Brown, Smart, or Walker for the likes of Andre Drummond? I’ve certainly had my grievances with the front office this year but they definitely aren’t that stupid."
Andre Drummond to the Knicks confirmed?
"I never expected r/nba would turn into the ""lets pile on Andre Drummond"" party this, but here we are."
as a pistons fan ive been saying this since like 2016.   anything other than a lob or dunk from Andre drummond is a wasted possession. period.  he has the worst touch around the rim that i've ever seen from ANY PLAYER ever.  he plays like if Clint capela thought he was jokic.
"Troy Brown Jr. ish smith, Robin lopez. Thomas Bryant and the 4 mill exception. Get it done. Thanks I’ll be waiting to draft Andre Drummond as a wizard on draftkings."
I watch basketball religiously. I have literally no clue if Andre Drummond is now or has ever been good because he’s only ever played on bad teams and I’ve barely seen him play. Same with Zach LaVine.
"Jared Allen and Andre Drummond owner here, not sure what to feel. :/"
"Listen, I am not here to trash Andre Drummond or tell you Pistons fans told you so. But I will say what I said over and over when he was in Detroit. He lacks effort, he pouts, he pads stats (rebounds) and thinks he Anthony Davis on offense. Its not a winning formula. The guy has value. He really is an elite offensive rebounder and keeping the ball on offense for his teammates COULD make him a positive... The problem is he refuses to play within his skill set and ends up hurting his team especially if he doesnt get what he wants. I thought maybe he just needed some veteran leadership around him but we tried that in Detroit and his effort and attitude were the same. I wanted to see him succeed in CLE but it sounds like hes pulling the same crap which is a bummer. The guy has so much in the way of talent and when he turns the motor on he is a beast. It just doesnt happen enough."
"I see Celtics fans are still working through their emotions following Tatum’s 6 points/8 rebounds/4 assists on 3-14 shooting (21%) and 0-2 from three performance against the worst defensive team in the league.   You might not know this, but neither Tristan Thompson nor Andre Drummond were on the Celtics last year."
Cleveland: hey do you have interest in Andre Drummond  Every other team:  lolwut
I have to 2 almonds and 3 peas for Andre Drummond
the world cant rebound like Andre Drummond
"Yes easily, the thing is he stinks lol but r/mavericks for the last 2 years has been filled with Andre Drummond trade threads from a few guys who are obsessed with him.   I would not mind trading him for Powell and Johnson because they both suck too, but no idea why Cleveland would do that"
"Lol. Thanks for defining that..  I don’t want to give anything up to be stuck having to sign Andre Drummond. As a 76ers fan though, I sure hope Toronto could be that stupid. Bbq chicken for Embiid."
"I don't know much about recent Aron Baynes so if he's dropped off then perhaps that'd affect my answer.   However, for years, I have preferred any number of centers over Andre Drummond so long as they knew their roles. If Baynes can't rebound as well as Drummond or dunk lobs like Andre, he could still come out as a net positive in games if he just acknowledged his shortcomings and played within himself.   Drummond is wonderful at shooting himself in the foot and negating many of his positives. In turn, he's one of the few dudes I've ever seen in basketball history who could pump out a 20 &amp; 20 and still somehow end up as a neutral influence on the outcome of a basketball game."
Siakam wasn’t bad to the point where he would be a filler in Andre Drummond trades
Filler for...Andre Drummond?
Andre Drummond is better all around (except shooting)
You knew [when he held the ball for this long and had that look in his eyes nothing good was gonna happen on this play](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2021/1/8/22220462/andre-drummond-bad-shot-turnover-standing-still-2k-cavs-vs-grizzlies)
"Yes. If you want your team to play winning basketball, then avoid Andre Drummond at all costs. He fights teammates for rebounds, has no value on offense whatsoever, and will quit on defense when things aren't going his way early. I'd be surprised if we got literally anything of value in return for him. Any team that trades for Drummond with the intention of winning games deserves to be dunked on mercilessly by r/nba"
"Alright Siakam maybe isn't playing up to his contract but to giving him for ANDRE DRUMMOND is a bridge too far. Many of the supposed big FAs for next year aren't be going anywhere (PG, Giannis), and the Raptors aren't a FA draw anyway. Hold Siakam, make the playoffs, and wait for a superstar to get discontented. Then you have a reasonably appealing asset that makes salary matching easy, a la Derozan for Kawhi."
Andre Drummond worked at the Wuhan bio lab and released Covid-19. On purpose.  He also did 9/11
Dropped Jarrett Allen and have Andre Drummond. Stand up!
He’s elbowed his own teammates on purpose before.    &gt;Don’t mess with my rebounds that is how I get paid  Andre Drummond is a clown
You’re blaming the lack of development of a young guy on Andre Drummond yelling at him once? That seems like a stretch
2-time DPOY Andre Drummond.
"That's the long and short of it. If all you do is hyper focus on PPG and RPG, yeah, he looks awesome. Turns out there's a lot more to basketball though and Andre Drummond often gives up a lot more than he provides."
"Andre Drummond fantasy owner here, disappointed"
I still have no idea why Cleveland thought spending $60 MILLION a year on Kevin love and Andre Drummond was a good idea.  What is you doing?!
"&gt; Started pouting after the Allen trade, and he's been unwatchable.  Andre Drummond pouting when things don't go his way and not playing well because of it? NEVER"
"If the Raptors give up Norman Powell for Andre Drummond that's such a damn fleece.  Just to make the salaries match you'd have to offer Powell, Baynes, McCaw and Stanley Johnson. That's still too much.  I think Lowry is going out but it'll be a 3-team trade. Lowry will go to a contender."
Andre Drummond is not a rim protector lol
Have you ever watched Andre Drummond?
You think Andre Drummond won’t help the worst defense in nba history improve???
*Andre Drummond has entered*
"The NBA average for points per possession is 1.11, which means a 56% FT shooter getting two shots is an above-average offensive outcome. A 60% FT shooter is more efficient than the best offense in the NBA.  The worst FT shooter in the league right now, out of 112 qualified players, is Rudy Gobert at 56%. Andre Drummond is the only other guy under 61%. *That's* why hack a Shaq went away, it's bad math unless you're facing an outrageously bad shooter who is also completely unstoppable in the paint. It's not a realistic concern in 2021."
Andre Drummond  A D  D A  DeAndre Jordan  Illuminati  plausible
"I would legitimately rather have Powell alone than Drummond, let alone give up second rounders for him.  We need a big, bud Andre isn’t our guy."
"No no, I think who they *really* need is Andre Drummond."
You have 15 guys who are elite at not being Andre Drummond
"&gt;I'm not a guy who just started watching basketball, I've been watching 20+ years.   I appreciate that, and your username was a hint to that effect.  I still maintain that you are wrong.  &gt;There isn't nearly the amount of ""plugs"" in the nba now. You don't see low skilled 7 footers get any meaningful play time when just 10 years ago it wasnt uncommon and even more so 20 years ago.    There are different types of skill.  Playing defense and rebounding are skills, and the necessity of those two skills 20 years ago led to those players getting minutes -- because there were skilled seven footers on many teams that needed to be stopped.  That said, is Rudy Gobert more ""skilled"" than centers of twenty years ago?  What skills does Mitchell Robinson possess that were not commonplace twenty years ago?  What about DeAndre Jordan?  Alex Len?  Steven Adams?  Hassan Whiteside?  Andre Drummond?  Jarret Allen?  Mason Plumlee?  Enes Kanter?  Ivica Zubac?  Jakob Poeltl?  Robin Lopez?  Willie Cauley-Stein?    None of those players would have been at all remarkable for their skills at any point in NBA history.  The difference is that now you have a few teams like Toronto and Boston who don't play any traditional bigs, and who can get away with that because the skill level of bigs in today's game is generally way down from its historical level -- a few players like Embiid, and Jokic, aside."
"The way the docu described it was the very basic free throw mechanics that were taught to players by coaches since the early basketball days, were made with guards in mind, and feature a full range of motion starting below the hip and ending over the head. But when you get guys that are 6'10 and 7 foot and teach them that same mechanic, it's gonna have way different results because of the extended proportions of their bodies. Add in the strength of these big players like, dwight howard, shaq, wilt, deandre jordan, andre drummond, lebron james, Hakeem, etc. Etc. Etc. And those free throw mechanics that work for smaller guys are just not gonna work for them.   There's a reason these these dudes can't hit free throws at a high clip besides nerves. I mean think of Tim Duncan, ""the big fundamentals"" but he shot 63% from the line."
"yeah anyone who criticized his time in Detroit kept getting ""it wasn't his fault it was the roster's"" ""it was because he was GM and coach"". everyone kept referring to his Orlando stint, which yeah was revolutionary at the time, but it's been 12 fucking years since then. the rest of the league has caught up with that Orlando offensive and defensive schemes.  dude was a straight trash coach in detroit whose primary offensive plays were ""Andre Drummond post up"" or ""dribble hand off long two for avery bradley or whatever SG is on the roster"".  he hasn't adapted to 2021 NBA and he was a bad hire. props on Orlando but the man is riding off a decades long reputation that isn't deserved anymore."
didn’t i go in your sub and see KP for Andre Drummond trade ideas...?
"In the end, Andre Drummond is gonna be known for dating Jennette Mccurdy and fucking it up."
"Andre Drummond is also famously just better than Zion, Lebron, and Kobe."
Andre “my weight was going the wrong way” Drummond
"For the low, low price of a second round pick. You too can pay Andre Drummond millions! Call now before the sale ends!"
Jeez for the first time watching the cavs all year I can confirm Andre Drummond is not that good at all
&gt;trading him and Brunson for Andre Drummond  I just threw up in my mouth a little
All-NBA ball hog team:   PG: Kyrie   SG: Jordan Clarkson   SF: Norman Powell  PF: Julius Randle   C: Andre Drummond
I will never understand people who want to trade for Andre Drummond.
Mavs fandom is so entitled sometimes. Porziņģis comes back from surgery and averages 20 &amp; 8  with 2 BPG on 46/32/85 shooting and he's become the scapegoat in /r/mavericks. As if those numbers are remotely bad. His defense has looked shakey but it's improving.   Folks have mentioned trading him and Brunson for Andre Drummond and one idiot straight up pitched trading him for Al Horford 1:1.
Tell that to Andre Drummond

"Prime Dwight howard would steal Andre drummonds lunch and eat it in front of him, they aren’t even in the same stratosphere   Before the back injuries he was hands down the best center in the league. there were holes in his game, but they didnt matter pre injury. He didn’t have fancy post moves, but he didn’t need them. He was bigger faster and stronger than everyone.   He led the league in blocks and rebound like 5 straight years. And these weren’t empty 20 rebounds games like Drummond where 5-6 of them were his own misses and the team lost; he would dominate the paint on both ends for a team that was a legit title contender.  Additionally he was great with the ball in his hands- the whole offense operated out of the high post. They surrounded him with shooters so you had to choose between leaving him 1v1 and leaving shooters wide open. Half the league is still copying that formula in some form"
"It was the Lakers 4-1, but that magic team was awesome that year. I followed them pretty closely because I was a big Jameer Nelson fan. People forget Jameer got hurt that year mid season and he was arguably their 2nd best player. If he doesn't get hurt.... We'll never know. But Dwight was the best center in the league for awhile but he was a flawed player and the league was very different back then and there weren't many Uber athletic bigs. Was prime Dwight that much better than Andre Drummond? Probably not. Those really good magic teams complimented him perfectly though. I think they would still be a problem today but Dwight probably wouldn't get the same amount of touches he did back then."
"Absolutely false. Jokic isn’t double teamed every possession because of his passing ability. You must not have watched the clippers series, where Jokic was routinely doubled and routinely used those opportunities to create perfect shots for his teammates with his elite passing.   Like this play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&amp;v=xia2o3ac2Zc&amp;feature=emb_logo  And this play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOHevpNNsk0   There are a ton of other examples. Jokic has proven time and time again this year and in the playoffs that when he wants to score, he can do it at an elite rate against really anyone. You have no evidence that Embiid is more of a scoring threat than Jokic lol, I mean Jokic has a higher FG% in the paint than Embiid does this year in nearly 50% more attempts per game, and obviously is a better shooter further out. He’s a bit less likely to score in the paint than Embiid, per possession, (87.1% point% vs 112.9% point %), but he’s more than 8x more likely to get an assist (8.4% ast% vs a legit awful 1% ast% in the paint). That means Embiid is less likely to get an assist on a paint touch than Andre Drummond, while Jokic has by far the highest assist rate in the paint in the league.   So you’re wrong on both counts; there’s no evidence that Embiid is inherently better at scoring than Jokic outside of his ability to draw fouls (aka flop), he passes out of the paint at a very low rate, and is really bad at it when he does. If Embiid was a competent passer than he wouldn’t get double teamed as much, and he’d create more points for his team."
Apparently none of you have witnessed an Andre Drummond offensive sequence this year
Andre Drummond bby
"I’m putting him below Andre Drummond, Nikola Vucevic, Joel Embiid, Kristaps Porzingis, Nikola Jokic, Bam Adebayo, KAT, Gobert"
Also Andre Drummond was there
"Cavs fans, I am so sorry about Drummond. Watching Andre Drummond try to be Nicola Jokic for 1 game was hell on earth. I can't even imagine what you lot go through watching that for 72 games straight. You lot are the strongest people on the earth to put up with that. On the bright side, at least Allen is pretty darn good"
"Andre Drummond is the ultimate eye test player. Looking at his stats, you'd think he was a monster. Watching him play, I understand why Detroit didn't want to keep him."
Andre Drummond will make “Clippers” as his salary next season. Ok
Its criminal john Collins isnt on this list. I'm taking him over andre Drummond all day. Other than that... yeah Drummond isnt good and I'd hate for him to be my starting center
Enes Kanter: EFG% .596  Andre Drummond: EFG% .481
"Enes Kanter: 11.2 PPG, good for 120th in the league in scoring. Andre drummond: 18.5 PPG, 43rd in the league in scoring"
"Do you think tanking teams don’t do this? Derrick Fisher got blasted for winning a bunch of games at the end of the 2015 season. Gilbert Arenas explained when he was a sophomore on the Warriors they would sub him out when he plays too good because they wouldn’t be able to pay him. Gilbert circumvented that in his Gilbert Arenas way and said if they kept doing that he was gonna shoot every time he touched the ball. Miles Plummer was signed to give Hayes a pick and roll partner and still be bad enough, combine with Blake breaking down and there you go. Can’t win when your pf is broken physically, and your center can only play basketball the way he is taught and he has the touch of Andre Drummond and fluidity of a baby gazelle. Jerami Grant playing like same age Paul George while super amazing isn’t gonna do shit. Not when you need HOF verticality badge Roy Hibbert to win games. If they had a legit center (not Andre he would try to be like Jokic and look as coordinated as Plumlee yuck. (But if he played like Deandre Jordan then but I don’t think he can mentally right now) Pistons got the Lakers because outside of LeBron there isn’t the post scoring needed when a team like the Pistons has so many solid or good wing defenders."
*andre drummond gets 24/23*  r/nba: what a fucking stat padding asshole.  *Josh hart gets 20/17*  r/nba: Bill russell 2.0
Andre Drummond
It’s Andre Drummond.
this team is a STAR center away from anything notable imo.   We need to acquire a really really good center. I just don't know how we do that. Do not say Andre Drummond.

Sounds like you need to watch more Andre Drummond.
Andre Drummond - Kyle Lowry straight up 👀
Norman Powell and a second round pick for Andre Drummond
Going from Marc Gasol to Andre Drummond would be a nice case of seeing how much individual defensive stats are useless to evaluate defensive players
Yeah I agree I think the buy out market will be leaner than in previous years but there will still be contributors that can’t be traded and end up on the open market. I’m expecting players of the Ed Davis variety more than Andre Drummond quality
Breaking news: Andre Drummond to Lakers is officially done. Both sides working on minor details at the moment before announcing deal.
"I don’t think Andre Drummond, a player nobody wanted to trade for in the first place is going to be the defensive difference for a team that has Anthony Davis...  I’m not knocking Drummond, he is great at what he does well. I’m just saying I don’t think getting Drummond improves yall to the point where “it’s a wrap”. It’s just about AD and LBJ’s health."
"Bruh, they got Andre Drummond, not Wilt Chamberlain"
Said Andre Drummond
"Huh?? The cavs actually chose not to play drummond because they wanted to play jarret allen more. The disloyalty is on the cavs, not drummond. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30905655/sources-cleveland-cavaliers-play-andre-drummond-try-trade-star-center-deadline%3fplatform=amp"
 Andre Jamal Drummond is an American professional basketball player who last played for the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association. He was selected by the Detroit Pistons in the first round of the 2012 NBA draft with the ninth overall pick
You've clearly never seen Andre Drummond play lol
"empty stats. andre drummond, blake griffin, and lamarcus aldridge are the 3 most overrated players in the nba at this point"
"I've spent almost a decade telling people Andre Drummond is not very good and is not a net positive on either side of the court. But now that he's signed with my team, Drummond is the best center in the NBA and you're just a salty Knicks fan.... for some reason...."
So do people genuinely believe Andre fuckin Drummond won’t be forced to take a back seat to Lebron and AD? No shit he’s pulling back Lmao.
"I disagree. Dennis Schroder, Gasol and Montrezl are not better than Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan and Lamarcus Aldridge. But if you add Andre drummond to the list, instead of Gasol. Then they’re probably equal."
"Literally started laughing when I saw “focal point.” That’s not a term you want to share a sentence with Andre Drummond, unless it’s preceded by “absolutely not a.”"
"It's OK, Andre Drummond will put a stop to this nonsense"
"Nets sign two washed up bums, LMA, and Blake Griffin: OMG 😳😳😳 The league is ruined bro 😡😡😡😡  Lakers win the championship then add Dennis Schroeder, Montrez Harrell, Marc Gasol, and now Andre Drummond: Cool!  Klutch media is working overtime right now"
Oh but Andre Drummond will stop them!
"Stop acting like Andre Drummond is good lol. He got traded from Detroit for scraps, and then when Cleveland tried to trade him, literally no one wanted him."
Andre Drummond makes you a superteam?😂🤣  The guy was traded for 2nd round picks last year. This year they couldn't even find a team to trade for him.  He won't even be on the court in crunch time because he can't shoot and can't hit ft's. This is basically bringing back Dwight Howard for the Lakers. They still a 2 star team.
Y'all signed one (1) Andre Drummond
"yes, ""Multiple time all-star 50% TS as a center"" andre drummond makes us a superteam"
"They're a super team now because they got Andre Drummond in his prime, who Cleveland didn't even want"
r/nba on Andre Drummond when he's not on a team: empty calorie stat stuffer who can't play defense or handle the ball or do anything worthwhile to help a team win  r/nba on Andre Drummond when he's on the Lakers: literally rhe second coming of Shaquille O'Neal
Robert Williams is better than Andre Drummond by a pretty big margin
"best player in the world in lebron, a top five and dpoy level player in AD, sixth man of the year, sixth man of the year runner-up, a top defensive team, solid role players, and now andre drummond"
Andre Drummond isnt the type to look good on a winning team.
Congrats Magic fans on your new franchise max player Andre Drummond! Dwight 2.0!
Andre Ingram &gt; Andre Drummond
The signing of Andre Drummond by the Lakers has become crucial in the current situation.
The amount of hate the internet has for Andre Drummond tells me he's gonna be real deadly in LA
&gt;	Andre Drummond   Don’t tell this to r/Lakers they think he’s some great Center.   Lmao 50% TS as a Center
Give him an Andre Drummond contract already
"Andre Drummond isn't that good. Looking at his numbers without context will not help you construct an honest view of him in your head. He has zero offensive game yet he gets tons of touches off rolls due to teammates also having zero game. He's horrible at finishing in motion so he gets a lot of ""Drummonds"" or what Pistons fans call put-backs on your own missed layups. He's worthless with his back to the basket and if you don't believe then watch some Coach Nick videos covering it. His footwork is horrible.   He is a great rebounder, though. His rebounding ability is what has allowed him to score throughout his career. Problem is he's rumored to be asking for a max. That's laughable and teams know that. He's not a star."
"Says the Lakers fan, awaiting a free Andre Drummond  This was the first time I've seen the comment, get bent"
man andre drummond must be a really damn good nba player
Calling Andre Drummond the 10th best player on that roster is ridiculously dumb so I’m not even gonna bother a discussion on him. And for the record I’m not saying he was the most talented on the Cavs just that he as a former All star believed he was arguably the most talented player.
"Andre Drummond, QB."
Andre Drummond??
Watch Andre Drummond sign with the Nets tomorrow
"Part of me wants to see that just for all the histrionic meltdowns. Enough people have overreacted to a washed-up Blake Griffin and LMA, and Andre Drummond currently outvalues both—especially for the Nets’ biggest weaknesses, lol."
"If they get Andre Drummond now, ppl gotta storm the capitol lol"
"Stan Van Gasbag trying to will a 39 win Pistons team into glory by trading away Tobias Harris and 1st round picks for washed Blake Griffin to build around flakes Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson.  As Paul Harvey used to say...""and NOW we know the REST of the story""."
"Pelinka: “God, we are in a tough spot, if only we had another AD...”  LeGM: “Another AD... that’s it! Rob, you’re a genius! (Gets on the phone) Hello, is this Andre Drummond? I’ve got a proposition for you...”"
Hopefully  Andre Drummond.
Who is better? Andre Drummond or Moses Brown?
Andre Drummond is a wonderful man. NY loves you.
"&gt; Exactly, he just needs to buy in. Yes, Drummond was really inefficient as a big but that’s because the guy played as the first option most of his career and would play iso ball.  I think Andre could definitely buy in for the Lakers, in part because he seems like a people pleaser when those people are great basketball players and icons (like LeBron and AD).   That said, for whatever it's worth, he's never been a No. 1 option. Pretty sure he's always averaged between 11-14 field goal attempts. Detroit wanted him to be a pick-and-roll finisher who was at least moderately capable of hitting a jump hook when the opportunity arouse.   A large part of the reason his reputation is in the dirt is because he always insisted playing well beyond his skillset. No one was asking him to iso off the dribble in Detroit so he could fire up a floater or push shot through a defender. And I'm still flummoxed by the summer of 2017 when he decided developing and implementing a 3-point shot was going to be the best allocation of resources (10 for his last 92).   But again, the cool thing is if the right team can scrape away the excess, you'll be left with a number of valuable skills."
Translation: Andre Drummond is going to the Nets
"Lebron has a way of bringing out the best out of every player, I’d like to see what that looks like for a motivated Andre Drummond. At his best, he is one of if not the greatest rebounders in the league."
I can’t wait till a few days later when woj tweets “Nets sign Andre Drummond”
"""Wojnarowski: Free Agent C Andre Drummond has agreed to a 1-year minimum contract with the New York Knicks."""
I’m Andre Drummond and you have convinced me
"Uh, Andre Drummond?  People are fuckin wilding if they think a healthy LeBron and AD won't beat the Nets over 7 games."
"If I may chime in, Andre Drummond has never been a number one option. I think his field goal attempts have hovered between 11 and 14 for the entirety of his prime and at no point did the Pistons treat him like a go-to No. 1 option type of guy.   Drummond's shots tend to come in a few limited forms. Pick-and-roll dunk, tip-in attempt, jump hook, floater (?!), and shooting through the chest of an opposing defender. The thing that separated someone like DeAndre Jordan from Andre Drummond was DeAndre's early realization that he wasn't capable of making jump hooks, floaters, or forced shots through defenders.   To top it all off, around 2018 Andre decided he wanted to start becoming a 3-point threat. He's 10-92 from the arc over the last three years.   If the Lakers pledge to beat Andre with a sack of nickels anytime he decides to take it upon himself to start flinging floaters, trey balls, and iso-motions moves from the wing, he's going to be an asset. I think LA's a great place for him because he's always hit me as the type of dude who's going to want to please superstars so they'll like him."
That’s Andre Drummond music!
"Because people are underrating him hard lol. If he is in the Dwight role he’s going to dominate.  And being an Eastern all-star C 3 years ago wasn’t that big of an accomplishment.  Andre Drummond is his own worst enemy when it comes to being a productive player, probably because he knows scoring point = getting paid (smart tbh). But if he wants to win, he should just focus on being the elite rebounder that he is, put more energy into defense, and being a lob threat"
"oh brother, what is Lebron going to do for Andre lol.  Andre is the best rebounder of his era and a average finisher, that is not going to change. Only difference is Drummond would have a much smaller role."
You are going to lie before the lord and say LaMarcus Aldridge is currently better than Andre Drummond? LMA got benched for Jakob Poetl bro
Any GM who gives Andre Drummond a max deal should be drawn and quartered on the spot honestly
"In the past 3 seasons the nba franchises in Los Angeles and New York have gotten Lebron, AD, Kawhi, Paul George, KD, Kyrie, Harden, Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge. And likely Andre Drummond. This isn't healthy for the league."
Yes Andre Drummond isn’t good but god damn. Some of these comments are severely underrating this man lmao.
"Andre Drummond is terrible at everything, tho. At least the other buyout guys have certain strengths."
"I just realized why it is different. It's the timing on how and when they added they're stars. In the case for the Lakers and Warriors they added their stars and washed up ones in the off season. Giving the context of confidence that they are going to rallying the whole season with this squad. But in this case for Brooklyn, they made a very dangerous team with KD and Kyrie, added an MVP mid season. And for some reason, KD looking afraid to fail even recruited Blake. And cause KD can't get enough and they want more assurance they added LMA. Now, the Nets are looking like a bunch of all stars trying to prove they can win rings too (for KD and Kyrie without steph and lebron on their side). They're looking like a team without confidence to beat the bigger teams in the playoffs so they just keep adding more. Watch them sign Andre Drummond."
"Wow, this season took some turn when I'm excited at the potential of Andre Drummond joining my favorite team."

"Drummond is. He brings way more on offense, he's also a better athlete and rebounder. Whiteside is a great shot blocker, but besides that he doesn't have any other traits that are better than Andre."
"Andre Drummond is not a complete bust, he can still get you buckets but he cannot be worth a max.  10 million is probably decent for what he gives you"
"&gt;Your argument about minutes was an argument about the intensity of the game for players today, wasn't it? Because everything you said to elaborate on that point was about the intensity of NBA play.  Quantity and intensity of minutes are two separate issues.  I did not discuss the latter at all, except to point out that the pace has slowed.  &gt; Data? No. I don't even know what data you would use to prove that.    Well then I have to suggest you not write things like ""(1) because conditioning is objectively, provably better..."" when nothing could be further from the truth.  &gt;But we know what daily life and in-season preparation looked like for players then and can easily conclude that it would lead to worse conditioning than what that looks like today...   We can assume that, but that's wildly different from it being objectively provable.  Are some players today in spectacular condition?  Yes, of course.  Are some not?  Yes, as well.  Do players lift more weights today and carry more muscle mass?  Definitely yes.  Is that better ""conditioning"" for basketball?  Maybe, maybe not.  The point being, the question ""Is the median player today in significantly better basketball condition than 50 years ago?"" does not have an easy answer, and is far from objectively provable.  &gt;We know that players didn't dedicate themselves to basketball year round because their salaries didn't allow them to.   On the other hand, they needed to stay in shape to literally feed their families.  Today even a rookie contract feels like 'set for life' money to most.  Are some players more motivated by huge paychecks?  Yes.  Are some players less motivated after the first couple checks clear?  Yes as well.  &gt; We know that certain technologies and medical practices that extend the careers of players today didn't exist. Even as recently as a few decades ago injuries that today might not even be season ending would be career ending.   That's true, but I'm didn't take issue with the medical science part.  &gt; If you don't believe that working out 10 months out of the year with the most highly trained experts in the world and a near infinite amount money to spend has led to better conditioning, I really don't know what to tell you.   You're assuming that everyone is LeBron James.  They are not.  Some are Marc Gasol and Andre Drummond."
"And the Nets with everyone but Harden just got blown out by the Andre Drummond led Lakers four days ago. They played really tonight, really poorly then. Shouldn't overreact too much in either direction."
He’s way to passive and the efficiency is bad. Andre Drummond had an easier time eating up the Nets defense than Embiid that should say something. 76ers also lack grit and physicality in their defense unlike the Lakers
"I usually hate this take but The Sixers don’t have “the dog” in them like a team like the Lakers do. They lack fight and a bully mentality, Embiid played well but it felt like Andre Drummond was eating these guys up easier. To beat a finesse team like Brooklyn you need physicality and grit"
"Marc Gasol on the Lakers, not just because adding a DPOY next to Anthony Davis would make the paint a no-fly zone like everyone else is saying but because it also means Andre Drummond is coming off the bench"
"All it takes is Andre Drummond catching the ball on offense for him to turn and try and take his man off the dribble. Trust me I’ve seen him do it literally hundreds of times. I highly doubt he will be able to completely change his mindset in a matter of a few games. I’m a lakers fan too and I would love to see it happen, I just think it could take a little time. I agree though, if anybody is going to fix Andre Drummond, it’s Lebron James."
"Andre Drummond has led the league in rebounding, guess that makes him better than Shaq"
The sudden Andre Drummond talk on sports shows is hilarious.
Andre Big Ass Penguin Drummond
"This is correct. SVG gets a lot of criticism for his time in Detroit–much of it valid–but it’s worth noting that he was basically asked to turn water into wine.   He inherited Josh Smith, an effective-but-slow-for-2004 Greg Monroe, a young center with no offensive game but massive potential due for a massive pay raise (Andre Drummond), and Brandon Jennings.  It looked like he was close to getting the team to turn a corner in 2016 but Reggie Jackson’s injuries blew up most of the forward progress. I don’t vilify SVG as much as many others do; I thought he gave it a fair shot."

"‘What you talking about, Andre?’ Drummond"
"LeBron ""Andy Bernard"" James and Andre ""Jim Halpert"" Drummond, ladies and gents."
"Russell ""Jason ""Andre Drummond "" Kidd"" Westbrook"
Doris is such a Lakers fan I can't listen to her talking about them showing hope with Andre Drummond on their team
andre drummond is honestly hilarious
"Bold statement considering this is a squad led by LeBron James, who has been forced to play an elimination game in the first round once in his entire career and has obviously never lost a first round playoff series.  This is definitely not the team from last year, Andre Drummond and Montrezl Harrell are legit horrible defenders and AD/LeBron don't look right at this moment, but at the same time i won't bet that LeBron with AD as his co-star can't win a playoff series."
"&gt;Also, want to shoutout this lovely OC by our community that seems to get more true every day I watch Drummond play:    &gt;   &gt;Andre Drummond is the WORST high usage offensive player in the league and it's not close  That does not apply to Drummond's time as a Laker.  Drummond's usage percentage has fallen from 31% with Cleveland this year, to 23% with the Lakers.  More importantly, his FG% has risen from .484 to .535, and his FT% from .597 to .660.  His turnovers have also declined by \~25%.  Using outdated statistics is rarely helpful."
"I've been waiting for someone to make this post since last night, I was trying to look up the official stats but don't have a subscription to bball reference.  He's looked absolutely terrible. Also Drummond has looked like the worst high usage player I've ever seen. I literally asked my Laker friend last night if he would rather have Andre Drummond or Hassan Whiteside since they're both known as empty stat players.  We basically agreed that Whiteside might be better at this point since he doesn't have concrete hands and will at least finish passes that are spoonfed to him. He also doesn't try and play like he's a star and take up posessions turning the ball over constantly.  Also, want to shoutout this lovely OC by our community that seems to get more true every day I watch Drummond play: [Andre Drummond is the WORST high usage offensive player in the league and it's not close](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lki28p/oc_andre_drummond_is_the_worst_high_usage/)"
I still remember the glorious frontline of Josh Smith /Andre Drummond / Greg Monroe.  Made me cringe just typing these names in quick succession.
This team can't beat the Kings without Fox and Barnes or the Raptors without FVV and Gary Trent Jr. Anthony Davis looks like he doesn't give a fuck half the time and who knows when LeBron will be back and then Andre Drummond. Consider it a blessing if they manage to win a play in game.
i enjoy watching andre drummond ISO i hope he does it more
"A grand 5 all star appearances, 3 in which he played no more than 60 games. Played his worst basketball on the biggest stage, played his best basketball for the worst team in the league. But yes Andre Drummond with slightly improved coordination and a jumper is enough to be a HOF’er in the NBA"
"'Andre Drummond gets empty stats.'  Yep, hot take champ. Lol"
Lakers gonna be without LBJ and Schroeder and a booty cheek version of AD and... Andre Drummond. They may just drop to 8 seed unless kuzma can turn into prime Garnett
&gt; Andre Drummond tricked me  FTFY
Andre Drummond tricked yall
I hope they play Andre Drummond more too

Andre Drummond?
He is basically saying - look this Andre Drummond pinky promise thats going on......that shit is killing us.  Crazy thing is the Nets lucked out of their similar promise with Aldridge retiring.
The team's gonna climb out of Andre Drummond?
The Andre Drummond Effect
"Perennial 2K All-Defense Team Legend, Andre Drummond."
[Buha] Kyle Kuzma: “Andre Drummond fucking sucks and I want him released.”
"Besides Pascal and Kyle's phenomenal performance tonight, both team's played awful. Kyle Kuzma and Andre Drummond had a pretty good game though."
And pray that Andre Drummond figures out the defensive system.
Just peak Andre Drummond managing to put up a 19/11 and being a total albatross all night
"It’s bad when fans rather the Lakers play Gasol, or to have never let McGee or dwight howard leave. If you need Andre Drummond, you’re not in a good place."
"Being a Andre Drummond fan sucks. I don't care what people say. Every year something frustrating. Just feels if he can't achieve this or that his career is a failure. It's okay to not like him but bringing him down and down and not thinking he belongs with the best is what gets me annoyed. I know it's fraction of people wo hate him, but games like this inflate their egos. I just want Andre Drummond to get that respect other greats seem to have."
"“...And I just, I don’t know what to say, man. They told me I was going to start, to contribute to championship basketball, and now they’re benching me for--for *Andre Drummond*! I just… *sniff* I dunno. Just had to vent, I guess. Hope you’re doing okay, Kyle. Wish you were here.”  *click*  Kyle Lowry turned off the recording, and looked around at his teammates’ faces. Pascal was shocked. Stanley seemed close to tears. Even Khem was clearly moved.  “I know I promised Masai I’d help the tank,” Kyle said slowly, locking eyes with each of his teammates in turn. “Y’all know how much I pride myself on being a good soldier. But this game?” He jabbed his thumb toward the court. “This game is the exception. We are gonna go out there, and we are going to kick. Their. Asses.” He closed his eyes, and took a deep breath. “For Marc,” he whispered.  “For Marc!” everyone shouted back.  Kyle smiled, a single tear rolling down his cheek."
Going to start gifting Andre Drummond to all my enemies like the Trojan Horse
andre “oh yeah i’m almost 7 feet tall” drummond
Pretty embarrassing that we're somehow allowing Andre fucking Drummond to be effective in the paint
they literally have gasol on the bench and he’s getting benched for andre drummond
So like idk maybe cut Andre Drummond? Like now does everyone realize this guy is literally useless?
The Andre Drummond Special.
"As long as Hassan Whiteside and Andre Drummond are still in the league, I can't say shit about Kanter.  He's one of the best offensive rebounders and is a bucket on the offensive end. Yeah, defensively he's not great - but Portland got to the WCF with him playing big minutes two years ago, so is he really that bad?"
"[Source:](https://twitter.com/hmfaigen/status/1388359893107691520?s=21)  “Andre Drummond said that LeBron pulled him aside during the game today to remind him to hold his screens rather than slipping out too early, and says they had a conversation about their pick and roll chemistry prior to the game.”"
Andre Drummond in the lakers sub
"Andre Drummond is the symbol why nothing is ever good. How can garbage be multi millionaire while we have people working and struggling with a 7.25 minimum wage, even 15$ in NY ain’t shit... he’s the worst big guy since Kwame and the difference is that Kwame didn’t threaten to kill a teammate over stats...Drummond should be a middle school counselor beating up on 6th graders, not an NBA player"
"my question is would andre drummond realistically be okay with that? i have a feeling he wouldn’t be too happy getting diminished minutes or possibly DNPs. especially, if he still wants to get a good contract in the offseason. (yea ik he probably won’t lol)"
"Dillion Brooks, Elfrid Payton and Andre Drummond"
"Bro u aren’t the only person that watches the pistons play, u not the only person to ever watch Andre Drummond play basketball lol.   Nobody is saying Drummond is Hakeem or anything. If he was the biggest bum in the world the lakers wouldn’t start him dumbass. I don’t give a fuck how many times you seen him play bro, I have eyes too and I don’t think Drummond is the worst center in the leauge, he’s a fine center to have for 20 minutes a night"
"I’m fine. You the one who loves to talk about Andre Drummond of all players lol. Like you came back a month later to talk about Andre Drummond, Why?"
"There was that redditor that made a superclip about Drummond fucking up easy plays and how he's one of the least efficient high volume 'post' players in the league. It was probably a lot of cherry picked clips, but it forever changed my opinion on Andre 'empty stats' Drummond"
The science says Andre Drummond is the most explosive big man in the league.   https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/behold-science-andre-drummond-explosive-big-man-league/story?id=38597055
You really referred to Andre Drummond as AD 😭
That's the Andre Drummond story.
He suffers from Andre Drummond and Marcus Smart syndrome where he thinks he’s a lot better than he is and takes terrible shots and makes low IQ plays but it’s way worse cause he’s way less skilled than those 2
"Our best player was Andre Drummond, followed by Reggie Jackson. As shown by their play on other teams, they are high end role players. Too good to tank, too bad to carry"
Someone in Facebook said he'd rather have Andre Drummond over Rudy Gobert lmao
That’s the Andre Drummond we know. Welcome back.
Andre Drummond after the Lakers get booted out of the playoffs in the first round: “Nothing we should be too worried about. It’ll take a little bit of time. But it’ll be fine.”
Andre Drummond.
Sure that can be just as responsible but you don't live in reality if you don't think Andre Drummond was a massive liability out there tonight.
"Andre Drummond is costing the Lakers games with his horrible offense and low IQ plays on defense. Rob Pelinka put himself into a bind with this one by promising him starters minutes. At some point, Vogel needs to show some balls like he did last playoffs when he benched Dwight for a whole series."
Tell that to Andre Drummond.
The last couple minutes have been an Andre Drummond Lowlight reel
All AD team  Adrian Dantley  Anthony Davis  Antonio Davis  Andre Drummond  and idk the 5th
&gt;	Missing shots isn't an offensive style lol  I would have agreed with this until I ended up watching Andre Drummond play regularly. It’s definitely his offensive style haha. Still not good though.
"Playing good basketball for a stretch isn't the same as being good. C'mon, y'all have been there before just like we have. Being good is reflected across an entire season.  I'm happy Edwards is looking good but no one's going to respect declarations like that over a 15 or 20 game stretch. We had like a 14-8 run a couple years ago. And remember this one?  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/12/1/16722538/detroit-pistons-andre-drummond"
"Basically, Andre Drummond is one of the most capable basketball players to dunk on 5 year olds"
I think it would be a throwback player like Demar Derozan or Andre Drummond
Which one would had a better name if they switch up their first name?  Do you prefer Anthony Drummond or Andre Davis?
"Defensive advanced stats aren't great as everyone here has already mentioned, but I think there are much better options than RPM.  Just out of curiosity, here are the 20 players with the highest **538 Defensive RAPTOR rating** (min. 1,000 minutes):  1. Rudy Gobert (**massive** lead for 1st) 2. Clint Capela 3. Matisse Thybulle 4.

"Advanced defensive stats (not counting impact stats) are all based on box score stuff and are unreliable. It considers good rebounders to be good defenders, hence Andre Drummond leading the league in DWS twice.  I agree that he has great hands."
Andre Drummond and Greg Monroe's vertical combined was probably 30 inches when they played together lol.
i'm relying on andre drummond to keep the lakers in 5th seed. ...shit
"Drummond is not a good player outside of his rebounding ability, but there is no denying he’s one of the best rebounders in league history. [This is all the proof you need.](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/andre-drummond-is-the-real-board-man/amp/) He’s ranked second in OREB%, and first in both DREB% and REB% since Basketball Reference has been tracking that stat. Jordan is ranked fifteenth, third, and fourth in those stats respectively.   Adams meanwhile is tenth in OREB% all time and 217th in DREB%, and 97th in REB%. He’s just simply not the rebounder that everyone seems to think he is. Looking at REB% actually makes him look worse at rebounding than his per game stats. Even if Russ was “stealing” rebounds from him, he still wouldn’t be even close to Drummond and peak DeAndre."
"Post-heavy era was definitely well suited for Shaq. That said, sometimes I think how Andre Drummond averaged 18 &amp; 15 and I shudder imagining what that’d mean for Shaq’s production today."
"You’re saying his defensive stats only look elite because of who is on his team.  Then why were Iggy, Klay, Steph, and Zaza’s defensive stats so much lower?  If they’re only good because the team’s defensive stats are good and KD isn’t as good as them, why are his stats WAY better than Iggy and Klay?  Dude, you’re just wrong.  Deal with it, move on.  You have a weird hate boner for KD.  Btw, Andre Drummond got votes for DPOY and three separate DPOY’s didn’t make first team all defense.  LeBron made all defense teams in years he didn’t play defense because LeCoast.  Jamal Crawford’s corpse won 6th man.  Iggy never won a 6th man while being the best bench player in 2015 and 2016 by a HUGE margin.  Media voting is bullshit, it’s not a good argument against KD’s defensive play in 16-17.  KD definitely should have been all defense 2016-2017."
Trade him for Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond with hands
I’d def do Andre Drummond and a first
"It rarely works like that anymore, it's a pretty outdated idea, that someone on a huge expiring contract has value to other teams. The only teams who would want that are teams with even worse long term deals who are hoping to open up cap space to make a splash in free agency, and you don't see much of that anymore. Like for instance, this season LaMarcus Aldridge had a large expiring contract, and look what happened with him: he ended up getting bought out, rather than used as salary ballast in some blockbuster trade. Same thing with Andre Drummond and Blake Griffin.   These guys who are clearly not worth the last year of their huge contracts don't end up in some trade for another star like that anymore, they just get bought out. Odds are if the Cavs just hold onto Love till 2022-23 then he'll end up being bought out rather than traded for something that helps the Cavs."

Andre Drummond 😁
Yeah it's a a requirement because it's pretty much how the revenue is split between the owners and the players. Teams have to spend a certain amount of money on their players. So that $30 million was going to be spent regardless and with them on a rebuild with players on rookie and cheap deals it doesn't really affect them much. Andre Drummond making $27 million from them (only until this season) and after that their next highest player is making $12.25 million
"Yeah, I'm sure JaVale McGee and Andre Drummond would have put up Wilt numbers in the 60s haha. Do you have any idea how dumb you sound?"
"Fair point but comparing the pistons situation to the Celtics situation isn’t really accurate. Pistons doing win now moves when their main option was Andre Drummond was stupid but the Celtics have already shown they are contenders, to take the next step they have to go for it at some point.  Boston still has a somewhat long window but stars these days are dictating where they want to go and if Boston doesn’t improve in the next few years I wouldn’t be shocked if jaylen brown decides he wants to go somewhere else in two years if the Celtics don’t advance far enough. Do the Celtics want to waste another year of brown and Tatum because that’s what they will likely do if they bring this same roster back next year. I am not saying trade jaylen brown or jayson Tatum but get some vets to surround these guys with. If they need to trade a first to get a solid vet they should go for that move"
"Luka is about a year younger than tatum.  He has not made it past the first round of the playoffs. This year they will probably not make it to the second round either. Would you say that the mavs are now “on the clock” and should start making “win now” moves?  The answer for most people is no, because those moves tend to handicap teams. A pistons fan should be very familiar with it, as the pistons essentially handicapped their future by shoving all their players and picks at the clippers in a desperate “win now” move around Andre Drummond.  I’d argue that the Celtics making “win now” moves in the past like trading the Brooklyn pick for kyrie actually hurt them in the long run."
"&gt;He got 5 points out of over 800. As said above, one dumbass journalist voted him 1st place for his inflated defensive rebounding.  First of all, you are [wrong.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2906248-cavs-andre-drummond-receives-1-first-place-vote-for-nbas-dpoy-award)  Second, that was not the only time Drummond has been voted-for for that award.  [His coach also](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/j-b-bickerstaff-andre-drummond-should-in-defensive-player-of-the-year-conversation-this-season/) thought he's a DPOY-level defender.  &gt; Watch the games instead of appealing to authority/box scores   Read my comment above.  I quite obviously watched the game, unlike OP, who is quoting misleading ""box score"" stats."
"To be fair to Andre Drummond here, Dwight Powell and the Mavs broke the Lakers trap on Luka pretty well in the second half. They kept the ball moving and Powell cut to the rim at the right times. Andre Drummond was also trapping Luka partially at times at well.  Basketball defence isn't really one on one as much as we make it out to be. I don't recall Dwight Powell Iso'ing Drummond on the block last night, if he did please link the footage."
Idk I'm also tired of Andre Drummond GOAT posts and Drummond MVP posts. /s just in case
Andre Drummond
"Current: I'm with Anthony Irwin on Andre Drummond. I've chosen not to remember the last big man with hands this bad. A 300 lb elite rebounder that can't catch, finish, or draw contact lol. Not being a vertical threat I can handle. It's the missed dunks, flailing driving lays and bobbled open rebounds that kill me."
Andre Drummond is 27
"Harrell was courted way earlier by Klutch and Bron. Andre Drummond played for Detroit and so was probably an unknown entity who just happened to become available just as LA needed a body at the 5. And Marc is a consummate professional who's body, not BBIQ or demeanor, is declining. [Dwight, on the other hand...](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/7/25/17613910/dwight-howard-hate-wizards-magic-lakers-rockets-hawks-hornets)"
"Ah yes, I forgot Marc Gasol, Montrezl Harrell and Andre Drummond are known for their sunny demeanour and likability. LOL"

Andre Drummond is goddamn awful on defense. He’s pretty bad at basketball in general. Marc gasols corpse is way better at basketball than Andre Drummond.
"Dallas is not expected to be a contender and is missing its second best marquee player (KP). With all that said, the Lakers had the lead and a chance and just crumbled. With AD on the floor for some of that even.  No doubt Vogel will need to go over his defense for the playoffs to get AD and LBJ integrated with Andre Drummond and the others .."
that's the reaction i would expect from somebody who just got their job taken by andre drummond
Andre Drummond is the starting center for the Jazz?
"Imagine having Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond and Marc gasoft only to get outplayed by Dwight fucking powell    LoL Lakers 🤡"
"Dwight Powell played like AD, and AD played like Andre Drummond..."
Thank u lakers for taking Andre Drummond. Enjoy getting bounced first round with this inefficient no defense bum.
"lol you mean Andre ""Hakeem Shaq Embiid"" Drummond (according to Lakers fans)"
DA as in Drummond Andre?
Imagine Andre Drummond as a sniper lmao. Aims for adolf hitler ends up hitting the wall behind him and kills him off the rebound
Sidenote Andre Drummond is only 27 but plays like he’s older than Bron
Andre Drummond be like
"Vogel proved he could coach at Indiana. Ty Lue so far has only proved he can coach Lebron, and even then there are tons of videos from timeouts where it looked more like Lebron was coaching Lue.  Hell, Lakers ranking in defense without Lebron and AD this year proved he can coach. He milked a top defense out of Kuzma, Harrell, Andre Drummond, and Ben Mclemore. (I know Gasol, Wes, KCP, and Caruso are good defenders regardless)"
Nets defense made Andre Drummond look like prime Wilt. Tatum should go all out this series
I hope you don’t mean Andre Drummond lol
I meant andre drummond. Kidding you know what inmean
"there’s Enes Kanter, Andre Drummond rebounds, and there’s whatever the Hell that was"
What if you bought tickets then hid in the locker room? Could you start at center in place of Andre Drummond?
Andre “Actual Center” Drummond. Now read it in Bruce Buffers voice.
First off they need an actual center which I can see them acquiring the talents of Andre Drummond
Mvp ; andre drummond  Dpoy ; trae young  Don’t @ me
every fucking Warriors went hot against Lakers  then proceed to become Andre Drummond in offense this game  Wiggins that brick....
"My vote is for Andre kwame Drummond. It’s really not that hard to deduce. Drummond is in the game, his team is losing. Drummond is out of the game, his team comes back and wins. Can’t shoot, can’t dribble, can’t defend, can’t protect the rim. Sorry Andre, you win LVP for 2021."
LOL @ Andre Drummond. Bruh pistons fans have been saying this is who he is for years.
"Age is just a fabrication. Time does not exist. Andre Drummond  exist until the end of time, Looney by his side. They are the time lords."
I'd never rooted for more Andre Drummond post ups so hard in my life :(
ANDRE DRUMMOND WAS ROBBED. I have never seen a player destroy an offense as thoroughly and completely as Drummond did to the Cavs this year.
&gt; Andre Drummond is only 27?   this is true.  &gt; I thought he must be over 30 by now  also true.
"Andre Drummond is only 27? I thought he must be over 30 by now, my mind is kinda blown."
"I have no clue how the fuck this isn't a flagrant every day of the week. Like literally, are players allowed to do ANYTHING to stop a layup now?   Can you imagine the outrage if Andre Drummond went to a shooting Steph Curry and two handed him right in the face down to the floor from mid-air? He'd have been arrested by FBI agents right then and there and brought directly to court with charges of war crimes."
I see your Kevin Love and raise you Andre Drummond.
"Considering how much Andre Drummond played I would disagree with you to a degree, but Jeff Van Gundy on the call correctly called that Caruso should be defending Steph over Schroeder to end the game. Making that move as a coach takes some guts"
Andre Drummond I guess cuz I love laughing at him
"You guys aren't getting a good free agent. You're just not. Use your cap space wisely instead of blowing your load on players like Andre Drummond or whatever washed vet you can think of. Your FO is afraid to take risks and plays it safe too much. Its why they passed on Ingram and Lonzo for DeRozan. Scared money don't make none.   Your FO is stuck in the past and hasn't adapted to the modern nba yet. Its the same with us and why we got swept by Dallas in the playoffs and then wandered the Sinai desert all those years. Not adapted to the modern NBA. We had to fire everyone and hire Pelinka and Magic. Magic himself wasn't adapted to the modern nba and we had to fire him too. Now we're good. Get a GM who knows the modern NBA. You guys are Boston Wests without Tatum and Brown, aka a FO stuck in the past who fills the team with middling useless role players."
Has anyone bemefitted more from name recognition than Andre Drummond? The dude isnt good.
"At first I read this as Drummond and I was thinking “wow, the fans really do hate Andre.”"
Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond DPOY campaign.   Him and Draymond absolutely clamped up AD
Looks like Andre Drummond is bout to ride the bench for this playoff run
"I think the suspension will have the same problem the fines have now, it won't actually be enforced.  If it's something that can be enforced in real time with the trigger being outside of the ref's hands(coach's challenge), then maybe something will be done.  There are enough cut and dry flops that the refs don't really need to sweat the borderline ones, just call the blatant ones.  They could even enforce flop calls on plays that don't get overturned.  There are plenty of times you see a 280lb center go flying because some guard maybe clipped him lightly trying to go around a screen.  The call might be a legit foul but there's no way Steph Curry is going to send Andre Drummond flying across the court because he cut it a little close fighting a screen."
Andre Drummond is proof that stats are absolutely dumb without context
I’m more concerned that we haven’t had enough games together to build the right rotations.  And that Andre Drummond will continue to start games.
"McGee and Dwight played much different roles than Drummond.   Dwight and McGee, they took easy layoffs and lobs and played post defense against true centers.   Also, their minutes got cut badly, Dwight averaged 19 MPG during the regular season and McGee 17 MPG. During the Semi's and Finals, Dwight played 8 MPG and 11 MPG respectively and played 18 and 20 in the 1st and WCF respectively, he adjusted to the minutes and the role each series.   McGee saw a flat decrease in minutes per series, and didn't play at all in the finals. WCQF 13 MPG, WCSF 7.5 and WCF 7.6. Keep in mind, these minutes come after starting every game for 68 games.  Andre Drummond is averaging 25 MPG, and he's an extremely limited scorer who is used to being able to work the post with the ball. I highly doubt he will be willing to take the minute reductions that either Dwight or McGee took as the Lakers move AD to C to match more athletic or smaller lineups."
Have you ever watched Andre “Hot potato” Drummond
He is saying it like it's Andre Drummond who made that shot. LMAO
"Steven Adams, Andre Drummond, Cody Zeller, Mason Plumlee. Those kinds of guys are overhated because they don’t fit mainstream conventions of what a basketball fan thinks makes a good center. Fact is that they come in a multitude of shapes and sizes. Not every good center is a floor spacer, efficient scorer, or switchable defender. That said, that does not make them bad players because they all have pretty great talent, it’s just not as visible as it would be with a center who fits into the modern paradigm."
"LOL, you've just had the quintessential Andre Drummond experience. Glad to see you come around. I think you were one of the many people doubting my lack of faith in Andre suddenly figuring out how to be a winning player. Are you ready to get back to me now, or do you need to see more haha?"
I like Vogel but Andre Drummond still shouldn’t have played as many minutes as he did this game.
"Also, I think Andre Drummond is on the bench like 20 ft away"
Andre Drummond is the most talked about role player ever
"The Lakers played like absolute dog shit offensively first half. But the 2nd half was night and day. They played with more intensity on defense, subbed out Andre Drummond, stopped shooting terrible long range jumpers (AD) and played inside-out, and took it to the hole drawing fouls. That was the difference in my opinion."
We played great defense tonight. I hope Andre Drummond never plays another game for the Lakers again. We made a substantive run the minute he went out and never looked back.
Always doubt Andre Drummond
Hol up  ANDRE DRUMMOND  DRE MOND  DREMOND  DRAYMOND  Illuminati confirmed
Do not post footage of Andre Drummond on a basketball court ever again.
"Time for the Lakers to show off their star acquisition, Andre Drummond this quarter. They were so excitied to get the superstar, he should play all 12 minutes."
Andre Drummond walked to the locked room mid way through the third quarter. Lakers Training Staff have been told to keep him there until his contract expires.
I hope we never see Andre Drummond back on the court ever again.
Keep that bum ass Andre Drummond out the game the moment they took him out the Lakers took over.
"lakers secret strat activated, bench andre drummond"
Whoever is currently coaching Andre Drummond turns into the only motherfucker in the world that thinks he's a good player
"Idk guys us Cavaliers fans have been saying this for essentially 2 months, Andre Drummond is genuinely the worst centre in the NBA. Shoulda listened¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
Lakers really shouldn’t be running offense through Andre Drummond
"Andre ""we tried to warn you"" Drummond"
That’s cuz Andre Drummond is out there...but that’s also AD insistence on playing the 4
Drummond moving like Andre the Giant out there
Andre Drummond is trash
"Bro AD is a bitch, get in the MF paint. And Andre Drummond doesn’t need to be touching a basketball lol"
"Like Marc Gasol, it seems Andre Drummond hasn’t played at all. Haven’t seen him do anything all night."
 For some reason Vogel thinks Andre Drummond is better
They need to start play Gasol. Andre Drummond won't do both offensively and defensively.
Lakers mostly made a mistake signing and playing Andre Drummond tbh.
Hello neutral fan here. Can someone tell me the national media’s obsession with Andre Drummond? They don’t stop praising him and keep talking about all his skills.. Meanwhile every time I’ve watched him play it’s just mistake after mistake...
I fucking love Andre Drummond. He’s so bad.
Andre Drummond is an embarassment
Have the Lakers already realized Andre Drummond is useless?
Andre Drummond gave Montrezz Harrell depresion
Andre Drummond: *literally just exists*     r/nba: “lmao fucking bum”
is andre drummond in the illuminati with lebron? like why does he play over gasol??
What the hell is this plan to play through Dennis Schroder and Andre Drummond lol
"Andre Drummond, what do you say…you *do here?*"
"The title is so click baitey  &gt; Frank Vogel confirms that Andre Drummond is starting at center tonight. He adds that LeBron ""is not full strength, but he's getting there... we would have loved a couple more weeks to get him where he wants to be.""  Its just saying that even though lebron will be playing, it would've been better if he got a few more weeks. Its not a crazy statement."
"Sure, but he did get heavy minutes from known defensive stalwarts Montrezl Harrell, Kyle Kuzma, Dennis Schroder, and Andre Drummond, so is it really that impressive?"
"It'd be kind of funny if the Lakers signed Marc Gasol, Andre Drummond and Montrezl just to play them each 3 minutes a game when AD sits"
This feels like the Andre Drummond thing to me. Allen is a nice player but he has a very limited skill set. He's NOT winning games for this team. Bad teams like the Cavs should only pay large sums to guys like De'Aaron Fox or Ja Morant type players. Guys you can build around and eventually pick up guys like Allen for less to be a part of your winning culture.
You expected better from the same franchise that gave over the hill Kevin Love 4/$120M and took on Andre Drummond at $30M?
If Andre Drummond is the one to match Wilt's record it will have all been worth it
*Monkey Paw curls*   Your wish has been granted. Andre Drummond gets 100/60/20 and wins on a half court heave
When did they get Andre Drummond on their team?
"Is it? If you only valued blocks, steals and rebounds you'd see 15.3 rebounds (1st), 2.1 steals (2nd) and 1.6 blocks per game (5th), which are all like top 5 among who ended up getting votes. Yes you'd still have to be fairly delusional and completely ignore defensive impact to think that, but its certainly less egregious than thinking Andre Drummond was the MVP."
"No one. /u/IntrinsicDawn is technically correct, Andre Drummond did get a first place vote. But for DPOY, not MVP."
Andre Drummond
"&gt; TRob over Dame, Harrison Barnes, Terrence Ross, Andre Drummond, Austin Rivers, Meyes Leonard, Jeremy Lamb      Literally any of those players would have been better. And I'm not even talking about the post-lottery picks like Draymond, Middleton. Look at the rest of the 2012 draft, there are literally a dozen players outside of the lottery that were probably better."
"Elfrid Payton, liangelo ball, Eric Bledsoe, Andre Drummond and Jeff Teague"
This guy thinks Andre Drummond/Hassan Whiteside should get large deals in FA according  to his BORG model.  I think I’ll take a pass on what he has to say  (Although thanks for your vote on Lillard for first team NBA)
"No, that *is* saying a lot. If Ben Wallace is significantly better than you on defense, that's not saying much. But if Andre Drummond is significantly better than you on defense, that says a lot."
"Ya know. If Andre Drummond is still in the league I don’t see why trobs career was so short lived. He was limited but he was never really that bad when I got to see him play. Worked the boards, was super limited on offense though"
"A stat padder is more like Andre Drummond, who seemingly does nothing but get boards for his own ego."
Andre Drummond at having chest hair
Andre Drummond rebounding
I'd rather have Andre Drummond post up with 5 seconds left on the shot clock than Thybulle getting a wide open shot from anywhere past 7 feet.   Both will give my eyes cancer to watch though.
Andre Drummond still exists.

"The issue with analyzing any player is that there's 2 very distinct ways to analyze players:  1. Through the lens of how good they are innately. 2. Through the lens of how good they are in relationship to their contract / cap space they take up.  I really like Wiggins. Through (1) he is a very good player. Through (2) he's overpaid but still a good enough fit for the Warriors that it works. People hating on Wiggins were/are primarily hating on him because of (2). He's not a max contract dude. No one (I think) is going to argue that Wiggins isn't worth a vet minimum contract. His worth is somewhere in the middle.  Blake Griffin/Andre Drummond/Kevin Love are horrible in regards to (2) with max contracts but for the most part, still a steal for a vet minimum.  IMO so much confusion of a players ""value"" or ""skill"" revolves around people talking about a player through these 2 different lenses and getting into ridiculous arguments when in reality, 1 person is arguing through lens 1 (their innate value), and the other is arguing through lens 2 (their value in relationship to their contract)."
"The Lakers have Lebron, Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, and a very talented young roster, and are the 7th seed. The West is very competitive."
"B+ :  \- We finally stopped the whole ""chase the 8th seed at all cost"" and picked a direction, we'll have a high pick  \- 2 of the 3 rookies looked great  \- the ""bets"" we made on Grant, Jackson and Plumlee all trned out better than I expected  \- despite being bad, we were competitive for most of the season, the games weren't unwatchable  \- I didn't have to watch Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson think they are Joel Embiid and Russell Westbrook while actually being Erick Dampier and Jeff Teague  \- If Hayes looked better it would've been an A"

I have a Detroit Pistons flair bro. Andre Drummond misses more layups than a middle schooler. I already watched that missed layup compilation in real time. Does he need a shorter rim?
"The Rockets did this to Andre Drummond during the second half of a game in the 15-16 season (he shot 36 free throws). If I remember correctly, they implemented the one free throw and the ball rule for off ball intentional fouls after that season."
andre drummond
PG: Patrick Beverly  SG: DeMar DeRozan  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Domantas Sabonis  C:  Derrick Favors or Andre Drummond
"I really hope this is true lmao. As a Suns fan, I would love for the Lakers to commit to Andre Drummond."
Andre Drummond is probably better than anyone on that Cavs team not named Lebron
"I'm guessing he's talking about guys like Blake Griffin or Andre Drummond who sign a huge contract because of their skillset, and then they just stop playing because they don't like their job.  They still get paid, the organization is screwed because they've invested all this money in a guy who won't try.  All they can do is trade them for a shit sandwich and then the guy starts trying again for someone else, all while the original team is still paying them."
"Hey, Andre Drummond has spunk and a full beard — that’s enough for me."
"Ayton is the top of the list FOR SURE  Booker Trae and Ja are 100% showing up in their first playoff games so they’re looking good  Tatum and Luka are already high but they’re playing insane ball so they have to be on the list   Cameron Payne  Monte Morris  Dillon Brooks  Thybulle   Everyone on the Blazers, specifically Nurkic though. Yes Jokic is feasting but honestly how can you stop him lol. It’s just impressive that they’ve managed to hold him at 5 or less assists each game (2x 1 assist, 2x 5 assists)  Everyone on the Hawks  Hate on me all you want but Paul George is DOING IT. Make all the Playoff P jokes, but he’s balling tf out  I’ve always been SUPER high on Jrue but no one can say shit about him after this series  Andre Drummond made this really weird IQ jump after the first game of the series so why not   Caruso is proving that he’s what Patrick Beverley pretends to be"
That was some Andre Drummond levels of bumbling offence
Ugh.. our neighbor had Lebron and AD (Andre Drummond)
"I personally would prefer he keeps playing him, especially if we can make it to the Finals and we play them. You need a, uh, big physical bruiser, like, uh, Andre Drummond to guard Embiid."
You think DA is butterfingers? May I introduce you to our starting center Andre Drummond
"Yeah but I don't think Gasol has enough left in the tank to give us 20-25 meaningful minutes. He can only play solid for like a 5 minute stretch. Frank is doing a good job of using Drummond the 1st half and Gasol the 2nd, specifically towards the end. Either AD returns or we'll see a lot of Morris, Kuz and LBJ at the PF with 3 guards and either of Gasol/Andre."
Need to end Vogels love affair with Andre Drummond for LA to have a chance.
"This. People keep saying ""Ayton and Phoenix's guards will FEAST on Gasol"" Like what? As if Ayton and their guards are not already feasting on noted defensive stallworth Andre Drummond? Lmao. At least Gasol doesn't clog the paint and can stretch the floor a bit. Which will help Lebron and Schroder drive to the paint as they don't have to worry as much about a big guy crashing to the paint as quickly because that is the only place Drummond stands around on offense. Gasol is also still a very good passer of the ball and that will help keep the offense flowing."
Marc Gasol and Andre Drummond play different sports
Never forget Andre Drummond leaked his Ex GFs nudes after she broke up with him
"Even worse tho, you have andre drummond"
Phoenix has such a great center in Andre Drummond. Huge contributor to this current run
Andre Drummond is so ass. I'm glad the Hornets didn't trade for him.
Hey Faker Nation Andre Drummond is a all star right?
Anyone else think Norman Powell and Andre Drummond look like brothers?
"&gt;I’m still positive in an empty gym that Simmons would shoot better than i do.  Then you have low confidence or are bad at shooting.  I'm not talking basketball skills or a game of 1 on 1, I'm purely talking stand still open shooting.  &gt;The delusional ones are those thinking they would out perform an NBA player  being an nba player doesn't automatically make every skill an nba player has better than the average person's. Do you think you could out shoot andre drummond at least? lol"
Anthony Davis? Andre Drummond?
Wtf are you talking about? Dwight was a DPOY and had a conference finalist built around him. Andre Drummond has done jack shit and is not a winning basketball player lmao
"Im still taking Dwight but this version of Andre that is embracing his role, shooting 63% with 5 offensive boards, a steal and block per game has been super nice  Will see if Drummond keeps it up then I might reconsider"
It happened this year too. At the beginning of the season Andre Drummond had 8671 points and Middleton had 8426 points
"PJ ""The Cooler Andre Drummond"" Tucker with those smooth 4 offensive rebounds."
Do we have to put someone down to prop someone else up? Ya may as well say 'Andre Drummond'. 🤣
You might as well say “fuck you Andre Drummond” in the title
CC: Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond was going to write a scathing response to this but his phone slipped out of his hands and fell in his toilet
Tbf 70% of that is that this sub hates Westbrook  When he has a bad game you could probably convince this sub that he’s no better than Andre Drummond lol
"There are examples of teams doing a solid for non-stars.  Why do you think 40 year old Udonis Haslem is still on the Heat rooster?   Ex-Laker's big, Marc Gasol, gets a cushy job as Laker's ""development coach"".  I'm expecting the something similar will happen for Kevon Looney for playing through the playoffs with a broken collarbone. Which led to permanent nerve damage.  It's funny, this year they're not even trying to be subtle. They're straight up buying out contracts and letting players go where they want.  Cavs did Andre Drummond a solid. Pistons did Blake Griffin a solid. Spurs did Lamarcus Aldridge a solid."
"What needs to happen to retain Drummond next year:  Taken from: https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2939429-the-big-problem-with-lakers-hopes-to-retain-andre-drummond  Scenario 1  Drummond is willing to re-sign for the taxpayer mid-level exception ($5.9 million), enabling the Lakers to spend freely without a hard cap:  •	⁠Schroder re-signs at a $19 million starting salary •	⁠Harrell returns at $11.1 million •	⁠Caruso and Horton-Tucker re-sign at a combined $15 million starting salary •	⁠Three players at the minimum •	⁠Payroll: ~$168.5 million •	⁠Luxury tax: ~$94.2 million -- discounted by the NBA because of the pandemic to ~$63.1 million •	⁠Total: $231.6 million  In comparison, the team projects to pay out about $140.3 million for the current season, including luxury tax. Asking Buss to accept a $91.3 million increase is unreasonable.  Despite Drummond's (theoretical) willingness to return at a below-market price, cuts elsewhere need to be made:  •	⁠Trade Caldwell-Pope to a team with cap room or a trade exception •	⁠Trade the 2021 first-rounder (after the draft) as an incentive with Caldwell-Pope •	⁠Five players at the minimum •	⁠Payroll: ~$156.6 million •	⁠Luxury tax: ~$44.9 million -- discounted to ~$30.1 million •	⁠Total: $186.7 million  An improvement, but is a $46.4 million jump the answer? If not, the Lakers might have to pass on Schroder, Harrell or perhaps one of Caruso or Horton-Tucker. Drummond may not have any interest in returning at that price, but that doesn't change the Lakers' pressure with hefty luxury taxes.  Scenario 2  Drummond is willing to re-sign for the non-taxpayer mid-level exception ($9.5 million), locking the Lakers into a hard cap:  •	⁠Schroder re-signs at a $19 million starting salary •	⁠Trade Caldwell-Pope and Gasol to a team with cap room or a trade exception •	⁠Trade the 2021 first-rounder •	⁠Harrell leaves as a free agent •	⁠Only one of Horton-Tucker and Caruso re-sign at $6.5 million •	⁠Eight players at the minimum •	⁠Payroll: ~$142.9 million •	⁠Luxury tax: ~9.8 million -- discounted to ~$6.6 million •	⁠Total: $149.5 million  The Lakers keep both Drummond and Schroder. The total payroll (including tax) increases by a very reasonable ~$9.2 million, but Harrell, Gasol and one of Horton-Tucker/Caruso are lost.  Scenario 3  Drummond is willing to re-sign for the non-taxpayer mid-level exception ($9.5 million), locking the Lakers into a hard cap:  •	⁠Schroder leaves as a free agent •	⁠Trade Caldwell-Pope to a team with cap room or a trade exception •	⁠Trade the 2021 first-rounder •	⁠Harrell returns at $11.1 million •	⁠Caruso and Horton-Tucker re-sign at a combined $15 million starting salary •	⁠Six players at the minimum •	⁠Payroll: ~$142.9 million •	⁠Luxury tax: ~9.8 million -- discounted to ~$6.6 million •	⁠Total: $149.5 million  The Lakers keep Drummond, Harrell, Gasol, Horton-Tucker and Caruso. While Schroder, Caldwell-Pope and the pick are gone, the Lakers keep the bulk of their core while managing a reasonable budget."
"If we gave Porzingis Luka’s free throw shooting this series, he would just be a max contracted Andre Drummond."
"Luka ""Andre Drummond"" Doncic"
Andre Drummond
Lakers also have the benefit of ring chasers who follow leBron. They had two former DPOYs centers in Gasol and Howard join their team. They also acquired andre drummond for cheap. And LeBron can get drummond in line.
"This is probably the one of the best replies so far.   The Ben part doesn't really answer that part. I think Ben is a generational talent and everytime I say that l get razzed. Do people really think he's bad just because he can't shoot?  Andre Drummond, l see people say he clogs the paint for Davis, but that's kinda rare. The past 3 season Anthony Davis has taken more post fades, high post fades, and 3 pointers. I think you are correct when talking about Bron who slashes more. You are 100% correct about his offense, and stopping PnR."
I'm a Lakers fan and I think Andre Drummond should've received a technical for this clip.
Andre Drummond is standing at the 3 point line while the ball is live.
"Now THIS is the game Lakers showed some teeth.   Bron drove more aggressively.  Monty didn't adjust on them finding answers for how to cover Booker so that part was a disaster.   Chris Paul :(  Game 4 Monty needs to show some more coaching chops. Two straight games he went with the game 1 gameplan hoping Chris Paul can execute this time. I get wanting to trust the hall of famer, but man that has hurt us. At least the ""not 100%"" Lakers stars can execute. Game 4 is our entire season on the line, 3-1 can't be fought unless there's a big Lakers injury and you never hope for those.  Even if you get hit in the nuts Book, please don't push someone mid-air. Playing dirty I am fine with, doing something that can actually be VERY dangerous potentially is different.  Torrey Craig is the only wing that hasn't looked trash in his minutes in this series. He's gotten the least of them.  Nothing is a bigger indictment on how the past two games have gone than the Suns making Andre Drummond playable.  Ayton has played himself into the max. If he keeps improving, he can make it look good. Mikal on the other hand gave us a big discount which is good news long term.  Despite the bad game 3, I like how good the Suns have been overall. Think they will be even better next season if Sarver allows it.  SO many times the Lakers close out is obviously good, but our guys can get the shot off but they hesitate for half a second and don't fire. Don't be scared of them. They have played like 20 minutes like they're better than you."
"Tyler Herro - He had a good playoff run whilst being young, gets a lot of hype. Scorers naturally get more hype too. People were high on him but now kinda regret it seeing as how he slowed down a bit this year.  Jayson Tatum - Compared to Jaylen, he came out first, jaylen's kinda living in his shadow. BI plays for the pels, he'd probably get a lot more hype if he was somehow still on the Lakers. Jayson also has big games and people remember those more.  Ben Simmons - Generational talent that could be much better if he somehow learned to shoot better, there's nothing wrong with people saying he's good but at the same time he could be much better if he could shoot which has impacted their playoff run  Andre Drummond - AKA Big penguin. He plays on the Lakers, obviously backlash is going to be a little more overblown. But i mean he clogs the lane when both the stars play, he's meh when he comes to stopping the PnR the Suns run. He also has like 0 offence and bricks when its not a dunk or a layup under the bucket."
He did his Andre Drummond impression
"Bruh this is why everybody hates lakers fans hahahah, 1. Andre Drummond gets historically COOKED by Jokic when they play but also 2. Of course the lakers should beat this shell of a nuggets roster, that’s not what the post is about..."
lol thats not dwight howard bro. its andre drummond
"Anthony ""Andre Drummond"" Davis"
Andre Drummond seething
ANDRE DRUMMOND LMAO
DeAndre Ayton is the player Andre Drummond *thinks* he is.
I like Andre Drummond. I like what he adds.
I was surprised Cam Johnson settled for the jumper. Drummond was about to let him walk to the basket but I guess Cam knew he could bait Andre into a foul
Andre Drummond actually doesn’t know how to play basketball lmao
Andre Drummond is younger than Dennis Schröder
Andre Drummond making decisions is a sight to behold
Watching Andre Drummond play ball should be a crime
An Andre Drummond post up is the absolute worst play in basketball
I fucking hate Andre Drummond
Andre Drummond is just Kwame Brown. Change my mind.
Seeing Andre Drummond run back was the funniest thing
Didn't know this sub has a lot of respect for the great Andre Drummond.
Andre Drummond moves like Spice Adams
If Andre Drummond is posting up you’re definitely in trouble
I love Andre Drummond now lol
Dwight Howard to Andre Drummond?
Andre Drummond
Lol keep the same attitude when he becomes Andre Drummond in the half court against a good team and his defender can help off him against any Sixer attacking the paint
Attract Andre Drummond in the post season and have their own big three
"Marc Gasol and Andre Drummond are just a better matchup currently, no diss to Trezz, but if he could play defense this wouldn’t be an issue..."
"Didn't Mo Bamba work out with KG? Andre Drummond too?   I don't get why you would work out with an (former) athletic freak in the offseason to improve your game.  These guys should go work with slow, unathletic bigs that were effective.  Go hang out with Jack Sikma!"
He’s more than “All-Star” level. He’s been a top 5 player in the league multiple times. Andre Drummond and Kyle Korvers are former all-stars.

Turning down more money and playing time to join your biggest rival lmao can’t even break the playoff line up with Marc gasol and Andre Drummond getting minutes
"3.5 at least - There's  Andre Drummond, Anthony Davis, Marc Gasol and Montrezl Harrell"
how do you go 9-20 from the FT line without Andre Drummond/Deandre Jordan/Jakob Poeltl
they are able to guard Anthony Davis and Andre Drummond with Cam Johnson and Dario Saric.  Pathetic by the lakers.
this game is being decided by andre drummond and cam paynye lulw
saric is a horrific matchup for andre drummond lol
"imagine having lebron james, literally all you need with lebron is spacing and nah you put andre drummond out there the whole game to clog the paint."
"Jordan and Lebron are close, and some things push the needle for Lebron more than others. Regardless, Andre Drummond, in any way, shape or form, cannot move that needle."
Lakers legend Andre Drummond
"Andre Drummond hitting a sky hook, in the playoffs, in a Lakers uniform, is the moment when you know that they’re locked in."
Andre ‘Kareem’ drummond
"andre ""empty stats"" drummond shutting up his haters right now with inspired 2 way play"
The rare Andre Drummond useful performance
Comparing Andre Drummond to Kareem should be a fireable offense
I owe Andre Drummond an apology
[Sources] the Lakers are starting Anthony Davis at Center tonight. Andre Drummond is being started at the Power Forward.

Andre Drummond is playing possessed what in tarnation
the enigma known as Andre Drummond
"Ok so this makes no sense because he does, he does have pants on. But doesn’t it just *feel* like Andre Drummond doesn’t have pants on when you watch him run around rn? Something about his get up just makes him somehow look more naked. That one organic leg, yknow"
Andre Drummond good
"Dario ""Andre Drummond"" Saric"
"when Andre Drummond moved to LA from Cleveland, the average IQ of both cities went up"
"Tristan Thompson, Kyle Lowry, and Andre Drummond are all you need for the answer to that question."
"Ah shit, everybody is making Drummond jokes. Quick, I gotta find a witty one. Oh here is one.  Andre Drummond."
that AD is Andre Drummond right?
idk andre drummond was all nba 3rd team in 2016
If that’s legitimately your opinion it’s a stupid one. Andre Drummond is a 2x all star. You don’t think wilt fucking chamberlain who scored 100 in a game and has numerous untouchable records and is considered one of the greatest athletes ever wouldn’t have a place in the league today?
That was the old rule. The new rule is extending the old rule to all 4 quarters. A simple google search would have told you this. Looks like your username is as accurate as always.  https://www.si.com/nba/2016/07/13/nba-rule-changes-hack-fouls-deandre-jordan-andre-drummond
"Somehow Andre Drummond is at like 50%.  Edit: oh, he's taken way more than I thought. At one point he was pretty good at them for the Pistons."
"When they had literal Blake Griffin on the roster? When they had Reggie Jackson, Tobias Harris, and Andre Drummond???  Yes. Absolutely. They just were really bad at it."
"The Cavs tried, but that IT trade turned out to be a botch. They should’ve tried to get a big star at the deadline. And if they were worried about wasting cap space with LeBron on his way out, they didn’t let that stop them from giving KLove a huge deal. It’s probably worth more to keep LeBron than to have cap space but lose him.   I can’t really tell what the Cavs are trying to do. They were in a decent spot to rebuild quickly, but they gave a max to KLove, then traded for Andre Drummond. Sometimes top picks don’t work, but I don’t know what they’d get for Sexon. More picks?"
"As a Pistons fan, I am happy for Reggie.  He was always a class guy in Detroit.  A little aloof at times, but I feel Andre Drummond had a bad influence on him with his weak mentality.  After Reggie got injured with Detroit he had trouble getting back to his best, but he seems fully healthy right now and is great in his role on the Clippers."
Andre Drummond but traditional centers aren't very good anymore
"You could give the ball to Andre Drummond, wait untill he drops it and just take it back."
Spent a few years trying to convince people we should trade for Andre Drummond because I'm an old head who gets all googly-eyed at rebound totals lol  Not only a shitty take. But prolonged as well.
He has incredible touch around the rim. It's not all athleticism. All athleticism with lack of skill and touch is Andre Drummond.
"I struggle to feel bad for the lakers lol. Andre Drummond was on the sideline acting a damn fool, like dude your Andre Drummond sit down and have some class you haven’t won shit in this league. Now Bron wants to talk about injuries but I didn’t hear him complain when they were up 2-1 and CP3 was injured"
The Andre Drummond effect
Capela is who casuals think Andre Drummond is.
"I'd say Andre Drummond, Hassan whiteside, Lou williams are some empty stat players"
he'd basically be andre drummond
"Offseason focus  What is the pecking order in free agency? Half of those on the roster are free agents  Creativity in the offseason with limited options outside of their own players  What is the final cost of this roster?  Draft assets  First: 22  Future: The Lakers owe New Orleans an unprotected first in 2022. In addition, the Pelicans have the right to swap in 2023 plus an unprotected first via Los Angeles in 2024. The Pelicans have the right to defer the 2024 first-rounder until 2025. The Lakers can trade their 2021 first-round pick after making the selection. They are also allowed to trade first-round picks in 2027 or 2028 (but not both of them).  Cash: $5.6 million (to send) | $5 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  The Lakers have four players -- LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope -- who will combine to earn $102M in 2021-22. Along with the $9.7 million player option of Montrezl Harrell and their own first-round pick, the Lakers will enter the offseason $14.5 million below the luxury tax, but with eight open roster spots to fill.  If they elect to bring back their own free agents, including Dennis Schroder, Alex Caruso and Talen Horton-Tucker, they will be in the luxury tax for a second consecutive season. The total cost of salaries and luxury tax could reach close to $275 million.  If Los Angeles balks at the price of each player, it will have only the $9.5 million midlevel exception along with the veteran minimum exception available to use. However, the Lakers would be hard capped if they use more than $5.9 million of the midlevel. The biannual exception was used last offseason on Wesley Matthews and is not available.  The hard cap restriction still applies (the Lakers are $509K below) and will get lifted on Aug. 3. The poison pill restriction for Kyle Kuzma also gets lifted on that same day. Harrell has until Aug. 1 to opt in to his contract. There is no offseason guaranteed date on the $1.8 million contract of Alfonzo McKinnie.  Team needs  Starting and backup point guard  Bench depth at every position  Extension eligible: Alfonzo McKinnie  Free-agent status  Dennis Schroder | Bird  Montrezl Harrell | Player | Non Bird  Wesley Matthews | Non Bird  Alex Caruso | Bird  Ben McLemore | Non Bird  Andre Drummond | Non Bird  Talen Horton-Tucker | Restricted | Early Bird  Markieff Morris | Early Bird  Jared Dudley | Early Bird  Devontae Cacok | Restricted | Early Bird  Kostas Antetokounmpo Restricted | Early Bird"
"Andre Drummond led the league in DBPM for two years, yet his team had a better DRTG with him on the bench.  Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8e63jl/andre_drummond_had_the_highest_defensive_box_plus/  Why do you keep pushing this one specific stat to call Wiggins trash on defense?"
"&gt;1.

Trae Young(overreaction to the playoffs)  Honorable mention: Michael Jordan, kept the Knicks best 90s squads from even making the championships, Reggie Miller, the choke, Hakeem, destroyed the Knicks in the Finals first appearance since '72-'73, David Robinson and Tim Duncan, I still have nightmares of Sprewell getting trapped under the basket in the Finals, Lebron James the unbeatable force in Miami. James Dolan because we don't need a reason to hate him."
Andre Drummond led the league in DBPM two years in a row. You want him to anchor your defense?
"For who? Cade? If so that’s a very outrageous take considering Cade is 19 joining two NBA all rookie players and a finalist for the MIP award, and Blake was 30 years old and was joining Andre fucking Drummond."
You best believe Andre Drummond died for this
Andre Drummond…. Lol
The Raptors were primarily searching for front court help at the trade deadline. Andre Drummond was a name that Toronto chased back to his Detroit days. I think Toronto’s dream outcome is coming away with Evan Mobley.
"If we get it, it will be the league trying to throw us a bone after having to deal with Andre Drummond all those years"
Andre Drummond will also gobble up the ball as he’s a massive black hole on offense. If he gets significant playing time idk if USA gets bronze lol
"Honestly, with the firepower we have, we don't need an elite defensive presence. Literally Andre Drummond or Hassan Whiteside would be perfect for this to gobble up rebounds and hunt blocks"
"Andre Drummond is a guy that basically every team in the league would take for the vet minimum, a bunch would take for the MLE, and a few might take a chance on with a bigger deal if they had the space.  He's not a replacement for *Anthony literally Davis,* no shit."
*Andre Drummond has left the chat*
"But what has happened to him is over the past 4 YEARS... he was playing like he had crazy upside to be possibly Lebron 2.0 with his passing, athleticism, lighter version of Lebron's 27/7/7 statline with 18/8/8.  He's been to many playoffs that go as deep as second round but those second round trips other than first one lost in 7 with exception of first trip losing in 5 to a young heavy teamwork Celtics.    The first second round loss that went to 7 was ended in a crazy Kawhi game winner that if it missed, they head to OT.  Yes, his FT shooting wasn't as shit as it was this year, but it's still alarming that after first playoff run, the rest till today his free throw shooting is at 42.5%, huge drop from debut playoff run at 70%.  If you're so limited skillwise scoring the ball, then why is it that after all these playoff runs, you don't work on your free throws.  Even centers fix their shitty free throw % percentage to be respectable, ask DeAndre Jordan and Andre Drummond.  You don't have to have midrange or 3 to be a good player in NBA, you can dominate in paint all you want, but except to be getting to line alot and be forced to make free throws.  This gotten him so mental that he passed up a easy dunk to Thybulled who got fouled and split the free throws. Sure this is current issue but Ben Simmons being in NBA star for so long and in deep playoffs for years now has NO FUCKING EXCUSE TO LOSE TO A FIRST TIME PLAYOFF ROOKIE THAT WENT IN REBUILD MODE LAST FEW YEARS TO NOW A ECF?!!   Hawks give them credit, but they tanked for much fewer seasons than the Sixers for the entire 2010s trying to get the Embiids and Simmons to help them compete and this is what Simmons does?  Overall Simmons is still gonna be nice but from here on out, he deserves every single slander that goes his way."
Some actually are though. Like Andre Drummond in the pistons.
"It would be a great defensive team, but we would have the offensive equivalent of the Pistons when they started Josh Smith, Greg Monroe, and Andre Drummond on the court together."
"Another example of ""he's just an empty stats guy"" being a terrible take. There's no such thing as empty stats....unless you're Andre Drummond"
Andre Drummond with Kyrie's handling and Derozans midrange
"I follow football as well. I personally don't like that people focus solely on trophies when evaluating players. For example, I was talking to some friends about Steven Gerrard, and a few of them said he's not a Prem legend because he never won the league, which is silly imo. People say similar things now about Harry Kane despite him leading the league in both goals and assists. The culture surrounding trophies is worse in football than it is with rings in the NBA imo   To add NBA media voters generally get it right imo, and it's easier to see and assess because stats make more sense in the NBA (imo). In football, stats are quite useless imo. Different roles, different positions, and no cumulative advanced stats, etc. Kante and Lampard are both central midfielders for ex, but you can't just say Lampard's better because he scores more goals. NBA awards are obviously subjective, but the arguments are all stat-based which make it logical. Not sure if I'm making sense tbh, but basically I think in the NBA, fans can see that the players deserve these opinion-based awards  Also regarding your point on basically NBA golden boots for points, rebounds, etc, that's useless imo because while if you're a striker scoring a ton of goals, you're 100% doing your job, no single box score statistic in basketball is indicative of that imo. Look at Andre Drummond and rebounding for example. Even points can be empty. I feel like I'm rambling but yeah I don't mind it."
"It's basically a summer league hosted in Los Angeles with teams comprised of amateurs, semi-pros and pros that's not affiliated with the NBA whatsoever.  If you're near LA I'd 100% say it's worth going to. I went a few years ago with some friends and even though the high tier stars like Harden and KD weren't playing I still got to see Julius Randle, Swaggy P, Baron Davis, Andre Drummond and Lou Will with fantastic seats for free. Sweet Lou actually went crazy and dropped [50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IegdYf133uQ), was super fun to watch."
I can make Andre Drummond look incredible with a highlight reel😂
"That last one is absolutely hilarious.  &gt;These Four NBA Players Want You to Know They Can Shoot Now  Daaamn, talk yo shit, who is it btw?  &gt;Lonzo Ball, Ben Simmons, Hassan Whiteside, and Andre Drummond  https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjl-I4PBErItFL5c-C7-g_lAMk4fjfyzi48k3o=s900-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj"
send Embiid to the Lakers for one lightly-used Andre Drummond via sign and trade
"No, it didn’t, because Trae was never an “empty stats” player. That term is reserved for dudes like Andre Drummond."
This is true. But he can exist in all the other facets. Free throw shooting can be improved on (DJ/Drummond/etc) even tho a jump shot will never come.  Either way at worst he’s just another Andre Roberson lmao
Dragan Bender - lol  Jahlil Okafor - lol  DeAndre Jordan - maybe a bit of a lol  Andre Drummond - oh god  DeMarcus Cousins - wasn't his fault he got fucked by his body  Andrew Wiggins - meh
"Anthony Davis- Yes  Andrew Wiggins- No, but not terrible either  DeMarcus Cousins- Body broke down  Kevin Durant- Yes  Russell Westbrook- Yes  Kyrie Irving- Yes  Blake Griffin- Body broke down  Stephen Curry- Yes  Paul George- Yes  James Harden- Yes  Giannis Antetokounmpo- Yes  Klay Thompson- Yes but injured   Karl-Anthony Towns- Yes  Andre Drummond- No  Bradley Beal- Yes  John Wall- Body broke down  Deandre Jordan- No  Jahlil Okafor- No  Dragan Bender- lol   Jaylen Brown- Yes   ———————————-  Pretty good set of predictions all things said and done.   Among the players whom they predicted wrongly, 3/5 are centers who were negatively affected by small ball(Deandre Jordan, Drummond, Okafor). Worth noting that both Jordan and Drummond made the All-Star team, All-NBA, and led the league in rebounds   Wiggins is a solid starter and 2nd star. He can still make an All-Star game eventually, but he isn’t the perennial Star they predicted   Dragan Bender was a bust"
"At this point, I’m gonna assume that ship has sailed. I’m thinking Andre Drummond but elite defense and above average passing. On offense, all he has to do is set screens and roll hard to the rim."
"Andre Drummond, al horford, Steven adams, buddy hield"
Shanghai Sharks starting lineup next year:  PG: Ben Simmons  SG: Kelly Oubre  SF: Joe Mama  PF: Kyle Kuzma  C: Andre Drummond  Book it.
*Andre Drummond has entered the chat*
Shrimp on the barbie Andre Drummond
How the f you gonna shoot worse than Andre Drummond at the free throw line and call yourself a guard man smh
Lol is Andre Drummond the top 15 player?
Andre Drummond is what empty stats is. Dude gets his numbers but it’s at the expense of the rest of the team having no spacing and no room to drive
"&gt;Ayton is top 3 in screen assists, and scored more points both in the regular season and playoffs (while having better efficiency in the playoffs) against much better defenders than Gobert has faced. Lol.   He scored 0.1 ppg on significantly worse TS% and was behind Gobert in screen assists. Under no metric has he been the better offensive player.   And who were these better defenders? Jokic who is inable to guard the p&amp;r? Andre Drummond? Please stop being a nephew and comparing DA to a DPOY and all nba C."
I know that voice from the Andre Drummond slander video lol
"Remember, Gobert is hitting 30, and will command 35-46 million a season for the next 5 years.   Bottom feeder teams aren't looking to lockup that much money, over that many years for a 30's big.  In general, bottom feeder teams would value their picks more.  &amp;#x200B;  He's going to be like Andre Drummond.  Where only a incompetent GM would give up anything for him at the end of his deal, and even then they would get burned."
What a dumb take. How do you shoot at his percentage close and not have touch around the rim? These guys need to watch Andre Drummond and have some appreciation for what stone hands look like
"They should have got Andre Drummond while they had the opportunity.  He's from nearby in Mt Vernon.  He is a must sign in the offseason.  Why didn't Jeff Green get more time to contribute?  I have a feeling if he did,  the outcome would have been different."
Andre Drummond 6th man
Giannis = Andre Drummond. Bro come on lol
It was. This came up   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25074729/joel-embiid-philadelphia-76ers-warned-flopping-andre-drummond-detroit-pistons-technical-foul-rescinded%3fplatform=amp
Andre Drummond does a good job of keeping him from getting to the rim
"Andre Drummond.   Here's what that's meant on most nights:  1. He'll clear the defensive glass, mostly unopposed on account of spread offenses and less bigs rummaging around down low.  2. He'll dunk home some point blank lobs or drop-off dunks if his guards are creating well that evening.   3. He'll tip in a couple of shots each night and often tip his own misses multiple times per game.   Those elements alone are often enough to result in a casual 15 &amp; 15 in today's NBA. That could be three lobs, one drop off, two tip-ins, and three free throws along with 11 defensive rebounds (8 uncontested) and 4 offensive rebounds (2 tips of his own point blank misses).  Many folks started and stopped at points and rebounds per game, and it made him look awesome. But here's what else you got with those numbers:  1. High rate of turnovers per game for someone who doesn't handle the ball  2. A scarily low field goal percentage for someone who shouldn't do anything beyond dunking lobs and tipping misses.   3. Three-point attempts  4. Wishy washy effort  5. Silly fouls  6. Frequently poor decisions on both ends of the floor  7. One of the worst offensive post repertoires in the history of all-star centers  So, if you look at *all* the stats, they do tell a more accurate story. But for those who only see 17 and 15 or whatever, that's what makes him an empty stats sort of guy. Those two numbers suggest dominance. The rest of the numbers suggest incompetency."
Andre Drummond then maybe Anthony Davis
" Ok, now make excuses for his shit offense next. A ""superstar"" center should have a bag on the post and offer something besides rim protection. He's Andre Drummond 1.5."
I don’t need Wikipedia to know Andre Drummond and Dennis Schroeder aren’t stars 💀💀💀💀  The things people will convince themselves to believe 😭😭😭 down atrocious. DRUMMOND? A star? You think Kuzma a star too huh? Finna get Dame for Kuzma and a first huh? Lmaooooooo
Andre Drummond would look like Shaq against them. Maybe lol.
May we also suggest one lightly used Andre Drummond?
Gobert turning into Andre Drummond lmao
ben simmons is the guard version of andre drummond
someone said Ben Simmons is the guard version of Andre Drummond lmao
"Just this season, Aldridge was also cooked by a rookie James Wiseman and Andre Drummond when he was matched up against them."
"Depends on what you perceive his true potential to be. I think he can definitely get some crazy double doubles in the future with Boston if the situation is right, but I don’t think he’s gonna be an all star or even a starting caliber center on a playoff team. He’s gonna be similar to hassan whiteside or 2020 andre drummond where he can put up monster stats every now and then but they’re empty stats."
"Alright man let’s just ignore SVG making the playoffs with Reggie Jackson and Andre Drummond as his 1-2 punch, turning Jameer Nelson into an All Star, and taking a Dwight Howard led team to the finals. His NOP tenure wasn’t great but to dismiss him like that is just disrespectful."
So he’s Andre Drummond basically

He is not that good. Yes he might be a solid big but he can be andre drummond too. I am not relly good at stats but his second year and drummonds rookie year stats are **very** similar.
The entirety of Andre Drummond on the Pistons
"I just wanna be the Browns again. I wanna make memes and laugh. I don't like being a perennial-top-five-in-the-league-but-light-years-from-actually-contending team. I want our best player to be like, an Andre Drummond type."
"Say hello to your 2022 MVP, Andre Drummond!"
the worst goes to Ben Wallace?  Edit: Or Andre Drummond in 2010s?
Ben Simmons = Andre Drummond but good at defense instead of boards?
Andre Drummond went from a sub 40% shooter to around 60%.  So the lesson is you need to be named (De)Andre to do it
"&gt;I mean Adams is better than any of those players?   I think that's highly debatable, but it's not even a question when you compare what those guys cost. Would you rather have a 1st round pick, George Hill and Nerlens Noel or Dwight Howard for $5 or $3 million, respectively, or would you rather just have Steven Adams on a 3 year deal for $65 million? That's a no-brainer.   &gt; What can you get for 10mil?   Did you not see the part above in the OP's post that said:   * ""The Pels will also look to see if they can trade either Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams or both. The two aging vets will tie up $35 million in cap space next season.""   Wasting that kind of money is *always* bad, which is why it's now being reported that the Pels are looking to dump him. Don't be surprised if it costs them more picks to do so.   &gt; Nobody is coming to the pels unless you overpay.   Wrong, the Pels could have easily traded for Gorgui Dieng or Andre Drummond, both of whom were on expiring contracts (so they wouldn't now need to be salary dumped), and both of whom were eventually bought out. The Pels probably could have got a couple second round picks or possibly even a first to take either of those guys on. That would have been far better than paying what they did for Steven Adams."
"Even if you ""overpay"" for someone like Nerlens Noel or Dwight Howard, what does that look like? $7 million per year? That's far better than giving up multiple draft picks and George Hill just to get Steven Adams for 3 years and $65 million. The Pelicans probably could have received a draft pick to take on Gorgui Dieng or Andre Drummond, considering both guys eventually got bought out.   The Steven Adams trade and extension were just utterly stupid all the way around. Sorry."
"He gave up multiple picks and George Hill to acquire Adams on an insane $30 million contract, and then he extended him another $35 million over two extra years. Meanwhile if Griff just wanted a traditional big next to Zion he could have made Nerlens Noel, Dwight Howard, Bismark Biyombo or Mason Plumlee an offer and grabbed any one of them for a fraction of the price. Or hell, he probably could have *acquired* a pick to take someone like Gorgui Dieng or Andre Drummond on, considering both were eventually bought out. Who in the hell looks at Steven Adams making $65 million over 3 seasons and thinks ""he's worth giving up quality rotation players and picks for""? That should have been a fireable offense, especially when coupled with the SVG disaster."
"I mean you don’t think we’d try? Lebron chose a losing season in LA over simply just signing to the Pelicans and playing with Jrue and Davis ahead of time. We have to stop pretending these front-offices are playing the same game. It’s the way it is. Demps made some really bad signings in Nola, but also like 10 of the top free agents aren’t answering their phones every offseason, and buyout players like Blake Griffen and Andre Drummond already have like 3 destinations picked before they’re legally allowed to even talk to teams."
Lmao he took Reggie Jackson and Andre Drummond to the playoffs what the fuck do you people expect a coach to do
"Man, if you thought that, than it must have been tough for you to be on this sub if you were here when DeAndre Jordan and Andre Drummond were making the All Star team.  Back then, there were some very vocal Pistons/Clippers fans who used to argue that making FTs required no basketball skill and the FT should be removed from the game lol."
"Idk why this dude is so scared to do shitt on offense, he is 6'10 with insane athleticism, dude should be getting 6-7 layups a game.  Even Andre Drummond seems like he had more impact these playoffs lol."
Yeah there are so many centers with great efficiency and field goal percentage  Part of the reason Andre Drummond is so clowned on is how awful a finisher and inefficient he is given the looks he gets
Those numbers don’t mean much. Andre Drummond averaged a near 20/20 for years and he was a net negative
Andre Drummond for sure texting everyone tonight that he could do that like Giannis if he was given the opportunity
"Embiid, Jokic, Giannis are top 3 for sure. Is Davis a center?  Then KAT and Gobert i guess. I wouldn't say 4 at worst but top 6 at worst.  Aayton (he proved something to me at least), Bam, Vucevic, Capela, Valanciunas, and obviously Andre Drummond round out the rest of the top players but there's big drop offs and skill disparities within that group."
Deandre Ayton out there doing his best Andre Drummond impersonation
This Ayton or Andre Drummond?
Andre Drummond shoving teammates for rebounds is empty stats. Young stars shooting efficiently and carrying bad teams is not empty stats.
You right. Andre Drummond instead!
I look forward to the andre drummond jersay burnings.
Andre Drummond
Who the fuck does Andre Drummond think he is??
What is Andre Drummond for the vet min?
Andre Drummond is the worst player in the league for the past 3 years and I’m willing to argue about it
"Even the guy you're responding to says in his previous posts that Demar is best suited as a 6th man. It's just the truth, Derozan is a trash player who is either suited for 6th man or spamming worthless stats on a bad team, and this trash kid is celebrating 30m for 3 years of that garbage and ruining their teams capspace AND spacing AND defense and having a untradeable contract XD.  Enjoy mediocrity you trash casual fan, this the type of guy who would celebrate when Andre Drummond would join his team for the max (before when everyone besides smart people and Piston fans realized he was actually empty stat garbo) only to cry later on when they realize he's trash that you wouldn't barley want for the min."
"Dude's career 65% from the floor.  Literally the second best FG% in NBA history, lmfao.  If a pass is made to Gobert, he's gonna dunk it more often than not.  You're really out here acting like he's Andre Drummond or something."
"For his career Andre Drummond averages 4.7 ORB a game (13.7 total), and his ORB% is 16.3.  He has a TS of 53.8% for his career. I don’t think it’s a very stupid assertion that his rebounding numbers (and overall value) gets inflated by him missing a lot of shots and getting the offensive rebound for them."
"Will the Thrill Bynum highlights? More, please!  Nights like this you could almost imagine that team working, but Moose and Andre could never figure it out. Monroe was a body type that was already on its way out of the league, and Drummond seemed full of potential. Nobody knew then that his hands would never develop, and he'd be a one-dimensional big signing a vet min in Cleveland at 27, in what was supposed to be his prime"

"If this is *just* on paper, and *just* based on as the rosters stand right now... Put the Bulls above the 76ers. Ben Simmons - who has been openly called shit by one of their rookies *post-draft*, who was blamed for the series lowkey by the coach, Embiid, and booed mercilessly - is still on the team. They lost Dwight Howard and gained Andre Drummond. As it stands right now, I'd go with the Bulls. Ben Simmons will score on his own team until they pull him from the game."
Andre Drummond
"Would you care if someone showed the best players in 2019-2020 by PER but included people who didn't have the minutes qualification and then said that based on that that it wouldn't be ludicrous for the all-NBA First Team to be Shamorie Ponds, Jamal Crawford, Max Strus, Jonathan Motley, and Tacko Fall?? All with 28+ PER!!!!  Hell, even just among qualified players, Hassan Whiteside and Andre Drummond made it into the top 20."
"Tayshaun Prince, Greg Monroe, Andre Drummond, Will Bynum. Things have changed"
FORGOT TO MENTION THE HORRIBLE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS OF BASKETBALL THAT WAS THE ANDRE DRUMMOND EXPERIENCE. HIGHLY TOUTED MOVE BY ROB PELINKA.
This offseason has been a L for the sixers just with the Andre Drummond deal.
Oh shit that's Andre Drummond money
The fact that Andre Drummond counts is just... lol.
Don’t forget that the 76ers added All-Star centre Andre Drummond.
This is when they were actually playing together.  16 in total.  Zydrunas Ilgauskas - 1  Mo Williams - 1  Shaquille O'Neal - 0  Antawn Jamison - 0  Ben Wallace - 0  Wally Szczerbiak - 0  Carlos Boozer - 0  Dwyane Wade - 4  Chris Bosh - 4  Juwon Howard - 0  Jerry Stackhouse - 0  Ray Allen - 0  Rashard Lewis - 0  Kyrie Irving - 2  Kevin Love - 2  Shawn Marion - 0  Kyle Korver - 0  Deron Williams - 0  Isaiah Thomas - 0  Derrick Rose - 0  Brandon Ingram - 0  Tyson Chandler - 0  Anthony Davis - 2  Dwight Howard - 0  Rajon Rondo - 0  Marc Gasol - 0  Andre Drummond - 0  Russell Westbrook - 0  Carmelo Anthony - 0
I really don’t like Andre Drummond but he’s durable as hell. Happy to have him soak up regular season minutes.

All the money you did have went to Andre fuckin Drummond
We really got a make an andre drummond support group. Teams that got fooled and talked themselves that he was a good player
Except for Andre Drummond
He's the next generations version of Andre Drummond and Hassan Whiteside  Fantasy Beast tho
undrafted Andre Drummond
TIL Andre Drummond is a box of chocolates.
Sixers are a big market and so far all we've done is sign andre fucking drummond what the hell
Lol didn’t your team just downgrade from Dwight to Andre Drummond? FOH with this nonsense
People on this sub still really think Andre Drummond is worth a roster spot on a contender. Wild stuff.
"Philly is the most toxic and abusive fanbase in the league bar none. And they are especially proud of that and constantly seeking to one up themselves. I respect it immensely.   Andre Drummond has the problem of being completely ass at anything other than grabbing his own bricked layups. Yet thinking he is the best player on the planet bar none.   If there’s one thing Philly fans love, it’s tearing down a bad player with an ego. And I’m all here for it."
"Drummond is the one dude I will say even at a minimum he's still a net negative. When people say ""if I was tall I could be good at basketball,"" I show them Andre Drummond highlights and say ""well.. you could be *okay* at basketball, I guess?"""
**FUCK**  **ANDRE**  **DRUMMOND**  peepoLeave
"&gt; Andre Drummond is a big versatile defensive minded big, can guard 1-5, can handle the rock, find open teammates, good in the post, stout rim protector, and I also heard he’s working on his three point shot 👀 76ers got a steal  Saw this all over Twitter"
Not sure how you don't understand how roles fit into this. Signing Andre Drummond to be your starting center and play major minutes? Bad.  Andre Drummond to play 10-15 off the bench (and less to no mins in the playoffs) on a minimum contract? decent.
You aren’t figuring in how toxic a sulking Andre Drummond can be
Andre Drummond already signed with Philly and Whiteside unknown as of this moment.
Dwights gonna be like 37 next season. Andre is gonna be more useful when Embiid gets rest days. Sixers got Danny and Dwight from the lakers n they had better years. Now they get Drummond and the same is gonna happen again. (Not biased at all)
At one point in my life I though young Andre Drummond was going to be like Dwight but because of his athleticism and rebounding was going to be even better.  That was also around the time when the Dwight trade was still fresh before Vuc became really good.  Point is 2014 was rough.
"Andre Drummond is a big versatile defensive minded big, can guard 1-5, can handle the rock, find open teammates, good in the post, stout rim protector, and I also heard he’s working on his three point shot👀 76ers got a steal"
I can’t wait to see a Ben Simmons/Andre Drummond pick and roll
I know the thing now is to make fun of Andre Drummond but this is a great deal for the Sixers.
Oh you have not watched enough Andre Drummond my friend.
"What if this is a move to make Joel win the MVP? Joel always dominates Drummond, so he's gonna see him at every game and he's gonna dominate every game as if he was playing against Andre."
"Ok, but you still signed Andre Drummond"
&gt; people somehow didn't notice them until he played in LA  ???  Andre Drummond has been a known bum for people who actually paid attention for like 3 years
"Schröder is a good starter and wants 20-25m a year. Thats a a player friendly contract but for sure not an overpay if the fit is right. If it wasn't for Lakers fans/media building the narrative around him nobody would make these pointless claims and drag him through the mud.   He must be the only roleplayer that had a bad (or horrible) game when he has to be the #1 guy. What do we expect from a good starter? You can't tell a guy:  ""Oh btw AD is out LBJ is playing injured and without that much motivation and besides those guys your only help is Andre Drummond and Kyle Kuzma. Now go out there and drop a nice 25 and 6 while having to create almost everything completly on your own against one of the leagues best defenses""  If that is your expectation for a solid starter than you're just delusional. Starters don't do shit like that Allstars do."
Kemba didn’t go to the olympics after 3 consecutive all star seasons and went on to be All-NBA the season after the olympics. Gilbert arenas was literally a top 10 player between 2005-2007. The other 2 speak for themselves. Maybe Andre Drummond? He was a monster between 2014-2018
Who do you think he was referring to when he said AD? Andre Drummond
People might thinking I’m crazy but a guy like Andre Drummond actually might help Team USA right now.
The USA needs Andre Drummond

Andre “Hassan Whiteside” Drummond
Stop trying to make Andre Drummond happen I beg
I don’t think it has anything to do with college. Kobe and KG were two of the more interesting personalities and cultured players in the league and neither went to college.    There’s also plenty of guys who went to college and have personalities boring as dirt. Look at Andre Drummond for example. Most NBA players who go to college didn’t “go to college”.
Javale McGee  Lance Stephenson  Rondo  Dwight Howard  Marc Gasol  Dennis Schroder  Avery Bradley  Danny Green  Jared Dudley  Montrezl Harrel  Quinn Cook  JR Smith  Dion Waiters  Tyson Chandler  Andre Drummond  Russell Westbrook  Potentially Carmelo and Iguodala  It's like a kid playing 2K

Who regards Giannis as having no skill? Are you referring to James Harden’s comments from two years ago?  Fans who honestly believe he has no skill and it’s just size/strength should be forced to go watch Andre Drummond brick bunnies for an hour.
"The truth is somewhere in the middle, but surely not close to Andre Drummond.   He has series like with Houston where his TS% is abysmal. Yet you cannot deny that he was probably the most impactful player on the court and had a +62 on off ORTG.   There are times like 2016 where his efficiency is, again, low yet advanced stats and impact metrics still say “hey this guy is a good player.” He also has recent years where his efficiency is garbage and guess what, so are his impact metrics. At his peak, you could still perfectly see his impact despite his inefficiencies in real time. Now I feel like people believe it is impossible to be effective without being efficient, which just isn’t true. I think it’s perfectly fair to say Westbrook was a great player at his peak, although not the best like the triple doubles may suggest.   However, my gripe with Westbrook criticisms when it comes to all time ranking is that his resume just gets undervalued. You rarely (if at all) see people say “yeah his accolades are good but I just don’t agree so that’s not his ranking.” The reason why we use resumes instead of sheer opinion is so there is something concrete to base a players ranking on. And I feel like people sometimes fully throw that away just for Westbrook."
"I'd say Westbrook is kind of a uniquely hard player to rank as well  He puts up maybe the most impressive box scores since Wilt, but on poor or even often terrible efficiency(example would be my last post where he averaged 30/8/10 on 45.3% TS in games 5-7 of the 2016 WCF)   According to some people he's one of the greatest and most unique players of all time and according to others he's point guard version of Andre Drummond  The truth is obviously somewhere in the middle"

shots fired at Andre Drummond
"then orgs should do a better job at talent and individual assessmentS before giving out huge contracts. the onus isn't wholly on the player. for every Ben Simmons (and I'm completely convinced he's in this category yet) and Andre Drummond you have a Dame Lilliard, Bradley Beal, KAT, and KG where is the org that's completely failing to do their part"
Yeah I'd say so - nobody ever talks about the fact that he led the leagues in rebounds per game last season.  He's what Andre Drummond fans think Andre Drummond is actually like on the floor.
Andre Drummond will win MVP ^^^of ^^^the ^^^CBA.
"   1. Anthony Davis. Pretty close, AD has been a solid top 10 player for a few years now.    2. Andrew Wiggins. One of the only ones where there's no injury excuse for why the player isn't as good as predicted.    3. DeMarcus Cousins. DeMarcus could be here if it wasnt for his injuries.    4. Kevin Durant. Pretty good Guess, they probably taught KD would have regressed a bit by now, which he hasn't, since he's almost consensus top 2 player right now.    5. Russell Westbrook. Wrong, but not that insane, I guess Russ would be in the 20-30 range.    6. Kyrie Irving. Pretty close, since he's considered about top 10 right, would be higher if he wasn't injured all the time.    7. Blake Griffin. Way off because of injuries.    8. Stephen Curry. Pretty close,    9. Paul George. Also really close, actually this might be spot on in my eyes.    10. James Harden. Pretty close.    11. Giannis Antetokounmpo. Kind of close.    12. Klay Thompson. I would say spot on if we assume Klay is as good as the last time we saw him.    13. Karl-Anthony Towns. Honestly, for me this is right where Kat belongs, except he's on Timberwolves. I know some people rank him like top25 which is insane to me.    14. Andre Drummond. Way off.    15. Bradley Beal. Really good guess.    16. John Wall. Could be correct if not for the injuries.    17. DeAndre Jordan. Way off    18. Jahlil Okafor. Way off.    19. Dragan Bender. Lol.    20. Jaylen Brown. Spot on Id say.      So to summarise,   Incorrect because of injuries - Demarcus, Blake, John Wall.   Spot on - KD, PG13, Klay, Kat, Bradley, Jaylen Brown.   Way off with no injury excuse - Wiggins, maybe Westbrook?, Drummond, Jordan, Okafor, Bender.   ​"
"Honestly, I can’t even be mad at the Andre Drummond take. Dude has one of the best bodies in the league. But no one, except the Detroit fans everyone ignored, could have predicted him having a few screws loose."
"""Andre Drummond will never win MVP."" See? Easy!"
Yes. You read Andre Drummond and “MVP” in the same sentence. Lol.
WIGGINS AT 2. ANDRE DRUMMOND IS IN THIS LIST. JAHLIL OKAFOR. **DRAGAN BENDER!!!**      This list is an EXPERIENCE
"Andre Drummond made an allstar game and led the league in rebounds when he was 22. There was a moment when he looked like he might be legit, that's why he got a 120 mil contract."
"Some interesting comments Bleacher Report added.  Andre Drummond (14th) - ""Drummond becomes a passable free-throw shooter and an effective low-post operator to complement his prodigious abilities as a rebounder and pick-and-roll finisher. His near-20-10 production and penchant for spectacular plays earn him All-Star and All-NBA status. His work as the leader of a basketball renaissance in Detroit, though, is what gets people whispering about Drummond for MVP.""  Andrew Wiggins (2nd) - ""Wiggins becomes the fifth unanimous choice for Rookie of the Year and the league's third in the last five campaigns. He follows that up by beginning an extended string of All-Star appearances while spearheading the rebirth of playoff basketball in Minnesota.""  Jahlil Okafor (18th) - ""Okafor, in turn, becomes an All-Star and a reliable 20-10 guy at center.""  Dragan Bender (19th) - ""Bender arrives stateside as a top-five pick in the 2016 NBA draft and develops, in time, into the NBA's next great European import.""  To be fair they predicted a Westbrook MVP, Giannis to develop into what he is today, and Curry to get an MVP and title."
ANDRE DRUMMOND BUT NO LEBRON LMAO
"&gt;I'm curious if any Celtics fans can tell me how he's so efficient  he doesn't force it, either. he looks to pass if the shot isn't there. he's no tristan thompson/andre drummond"
Imagine getting Gasol and the reigning 6MOTY and giving every bit of prioritization to Andre Drummond LMAO
"I remember my absolute clown moment when I was arguing during the Wizards series that Hack-a-Ben was a bad strategy. Because even as a ~60% FT shooter, that's 1.2 points per possesion on average, which is great efficiency. Then my guy has to go make me look like a dumb asshole by shooting like early career Andre Drummond."
[Are you forgetting this?](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lakers-promised-andre-drummond-a-starting-spot-to-convince-him-to-sign-per-report/amp/)  This seems like more of a Pelinka problem. If last season taught us anything it should be (a) be prepared for injuries and (b) don’t promise minutes/spots just to make a sale.

Almost all other voters(except Andre Drummond guy) think in a similar way and huge majority vote for Rudy.   ""Wtf, disrepek Ben Simmons he should have gotten 40% of the votes, and lemme tell you why you wrong Max, let me aks you something"" Nba analysts btw"
"Lol it’s been Andre Drummond the last 3 years, then Hassan Whiteside the year before that then Andre Drummond again the year before whiteside."
Ouch. So what does Andre Drummond bring to the table again?
While this [video may have been able to convince Andre Drummond to pick up his option in Cleveland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzgAjjuqZM) not sure at least we're not detroit would cut it as a defense when there's not $27 mil involved.
"Are we talking the current roster, beginning of the season, or including LeBron’s effect on recruiting?  If the former, I think Jarrett Allen and Kevin Love is one of the weaker posts in the league and while SexLand is arguably a top 5 backcourt, I still think we are out in the semis  With Andre Drummond, Javale McGee, and a somewhat healthy Love, we can make some noise. We also have Okoro and Kevin Porter Jr leading the second unit. With locked-in, pissed off, shaved head LeBron we make a proper run at the chip and with LeBron no longer on the Lakers, whoever wins the East wins the league  The third one is real tricky because the butterfly flaps her wings, LeBron stays in Cleveland committing long-term to the team following Kyrie’s exit (or maybe sooner and we avoid that fiasco altogether but we will just take it back to 2019. The Cavs trade Love and maybe a couple other players for Paul George or Kawhi Leonard and LeBron’s people start working on AD. Meanwhile Chris Paul decides he wants out of LA’s other team and joins longtime friend LeBron to either run the Cavs offense or mentor Colin Sexton. LeBron, CP, Kawhi or PG, Jordan Clarkson, and Tristan Thompson beat the walking wounded warriors and have the same draft spot as we did when we drafted Kevin Porter Jr. Lets say a trade for AD doesn’t pan out, we still end up attracting someone in the Marc Gasol, Boogie Cousins, DeAndre Jordan, Andre Drummond, Dwight Howard range. Now we enter the 2020 season with Chris Paul, Kawhi or PG, LeBron, Tristan and an unknown veteran C/PF with an absolute bench MOB of Colin Sexton, Jordan Clarkson, Kevin Porter Jr, Larry Nance Jr, Matthew Dellavedova, and Ante Zizic (who properly develops in this timeline and might actually start)"
I'm still mad we didn't keep Dwight. I have no idea what happened there. It seemed like a lock. Now we have to settle with Andre Drummond and his bad hands and poor defense.

"Did I say John Wall was the Andre Drummond of PGs or did I say is? You need to have braincells before you can lose them. Currently John Wall isn't a good and impactful player and I don't particularly care that he once was as I was talking about now. Tense matters, go to grade 1 then come back to me."
He just fucking yeets the ball to the hoop everytime. If you ask a random 6'10 guy to shoot the ball you'll just see Andre Drummond
"ima give you the benefit of the doubt and believe you arent colossally stupid and you were in fact, referring to andre drummond"
Never realized until now how similar Norman Powell and Andre Drummond look.
John Wall is the Andre Drummond of Point Guards
Ah also known as the Andre Drummond special
Not as long as Andre Drummond is in the league.
&gt; forcing you to give Andre Drummond minutes  Drummond has 6 points and 7 rebounds in &lt;8 minutes.  He isn't hurtin' 'em.
Wtf Andre Drummond is only 27?!?
"Andre Drummond Is The Points Leader Right Now, Wtf?"
If Drummond has a 30 rebound game I will make my flair Andre Drummond
"Having Anthony Davis on your team must be so frustrating; dude would be a top 5 center in the league but refuses to play the position, forcing you to give Andre Drummond minutes"
Anthony Davis  Andre Drummond just looks like a cartoon beaver. He's not that ugly.
How is Andre Drummond still getting minutes
I am begging you Frank Vogel - stop making me watch Andre Drummond play basketball
Andre Drummond in a nutshell
Andre Drummond is pure chaos. I appreciate his effort if nothing else
ANDRE DRUMMOND IS YOUNGER THAN ANTHONY DAVIS
You guys look like you aren't even trying and winning by 20+  Meanwhile we have Andre Drummond
"For what it's worth I think Giannis *should* play Center but the spacing on the Bucks is good enough with Lopez where it's not as necessary. Meanwhile the Lakers have had JaVale McGee, Dwight Howard, and Andre freakin Drummond as your centers alongside AD which are considerable downgrades in fit"
Andre Drummond is not the best option in a “meh group of centers” when they literally have ANTHONY DAVIS
PG: Andre Drummond  SG: KCP  SF: Marc Gasol  PF: AD  C: LeBron
"Fate of the Universe on the line, I want Andre Drummond."
Andre Drummond was there and threw his own shindig the following night.
