What happened to Nathan knight and okungwu?
Don't really understand how Nathan Knight isn't #1 but whatever
Nathan Knight or bust
"Not OP, but we didn't have  Bogdanovic - Starting SG  Rondo - Backup PG  Gallinari - 6th man with starter minutes  OO - Rookie big man at a very thin position for us  Dunn - 3rd String PG  If all our guys were healthy, Bruno Fernando, Skylar Mays, Nathan Knight, and Brandon Goodwin would probably be g leaguers, or at the very least like 2 of them.  Not comparable to yall, but stop acting like we're not dealing with injuries of our own. Yall got hit harder, but it can't be you're one big excuse."
"why don't the sixers have a g league?  you got beat by g leaguers brandon goodwin, nathan knight, and bruno fernando lol  nathan knight had 3 blocks but maxey's one was good too congrats  https://twitter.com/ATLHawks/status/1348767881820065793"
Shocking lack of Nathan Knight. Disappointing. Do better
"Hawks came back from down 24 and said ‚Äúwhat are we doing, were an Atlanta sports team‚Äù    Trae with the worst +|- on the team. If he‚Äôs not scoring he might as well be on the bench. Doesn‚Äôt move without the ball, gives up buckets and will never learn how to navigate a screen being set on him.      No plays being run from the looks of it. Move LP to head of PR. Hire an x/o‚Äôs savant from college, then get a motivator with a background in sports psychology to light a fire under these guys. There is no energy. Play Nathan knight and Goodwin who at least try out there"
Nathan Knight is the clear ROY averaging 34/14 per 36 on 76% TS (don‚Äôt look at total minutes played).
I know its *only* the Knicks but this is a must-win for Hawks. Our roster isn't recovering from Thanos' snap any time soon and we just lost 2 games by 5 points or less and were pretty frustrated by it.  No excuse of traveling b2b like we had with Cavs - whats left of the team is fully rested. I expect to see Nathan Knight if Bruno Fernando has another bad game.
Hey I think your keyboard autocorrected Nathan Knight to Luka Doncic just lookin out bro
"Nathan Knight sounds metal af.   Not Admiral Schofield tier, but not too far behind."
Nathan Knight is the Night King.
I'm sorry but if you don't realize that NK is Nathan Knight then you should just get off /r/nba
When is Nathan knight gonna get minutes goddamn. I‚Äôm just looking at the box score not at my tv at the moment.
I'd like to see Nathan Knight instead of Bruno rn
"2nd and 3rd string PGs out, 4th string PG questionable. Backup PF out. Backup Center out. Time to see some Nathan Knight minutes!!!!!!"
The Hawks would put Nathan Knight on him and it‚Äôs game over for Shaq
Wait till they find out about Nathan Knight then we‚Äôll finally get some respect
Nathan Knight ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time.
Ready? Buddy it‚Äôs already happening. All will know of hawks legends Nathan Knight and Bruno Fernando
"Can‚Äôt believe we beat the Nets with Nathan Knight sitting, this team is so nice  Deandre and John stepped up huge, Collins especially looking max worthy after these two games against Brooklyn.   I‚Äôm hoping we keep the ball rolling against Cleveland. Another day, another opportunity üíØ"
Nathan knight is in
imagine not having 15 rotation caliber players (16 if you count Nathan Knight)
He‚Äôs talking about Nathan Knight obviously
"r/nba after Nathan Knight dunks all over LeBron, wins 10 mvps, 15 finals mvps and 30 trophies, Did the Hawks sub make that guy up?"
Don‚Äôt you disrespect the GOAT Nathan Knight like that
This but Nathan Knight
Nathan Knight
Nathan Knight fake af lmao act all tough
Okongwu has been injured the majority of the season so hard to tell. He‚Äôs getting more minutes as the back up now with JC out and he‚Äôs looked really good the past 3 games. His offense needs a bit of work but man his Defense already looks pretty good. I think when he actually gets to have a preseason and practice he will turn into exactly as advertised. Our 2 way rookies Skylar Mays and Nathan Knight have both been good too. Nothing spectacular but they look like they belong on an NBA court. Which is a big positive for a second rounder and an undrafted guy
Nathan Knight going for fitty tonight
I wish this game was on ESPN so we got one of those bottom screen graphics like the Trae x Wiggins one vs GSW a week ago  Personally I would enjoy a Nathan Knight x Eric Bledsoe popping up at the bottom of my screen
Nathan Knight 40 piece and 3 bodies. I'm calling it.
Nathan Knight szn
"We give up so many big runs to other teams. So frustrating. On the plus side, Nathan Knight has gone from a bit of a meme among Hawks fans to someone who seems like they can really contribute."
Capela and Okongwu were out tonight and Nathan Knight stepped up with 16 and 8.
Nathan Knight should be playing over Bruno Fernando in the rotation from here on out. He‚Äôs just looked too good
Imagine playing Bruno Fernando for like 20 minutes against the Lakers (and all season) and benching Nathan Knight the whole game.
Nathan Knight is the greatest basketball player of all time
"So glad to see Nathan Knight go off. The Hawks sub loves him 'cause we usually win when he plays, but it is great to see him get real minutes and show up.  Side note: How in the fuck is Bruno Fernando that bad at basketball? -19 in 7 minutes while the Hawks won by nearly 20 points? He looks this bad basically every time that he plays"
Nathan ‚ÄúKnightmare‚Äù Knight is out here
Hawks really gonna turn me into an ATL fan if Nathan Knight keeps showing off like this
Can the hawks really be a consistent team in the east with a player that plays like Nathan knight?
Give all of Bruno Fernandos minutes to Nathan Knight. I fuckin love this dude
This was a 3 point game going into the fourth. Then the Cavs proceeded to play the worst offense I've ever seen.   Not that either team played particularly well other than the Hawks in the fourth. Highlight of the game was Nathan Knight cementing his place as the greatest stretch 5 in the league
NATHAN KNIGHT=SHAQ+DIRK+CURRY
The east runs through Nathan Knight
Nate McMillan heard y'all talkin shit.  Nathan Knight thought y'all were talkin bout him so he popped off too.
Hawks Nathan Knight looks legit
Nathan Knight says good nightüòà
nathan knight because nathan knight
Rejoice! For you have been blessed by Nathan Knight
NATHAN KNIGHT CAUGHT A BODYüî•
Damn yo I hope Nathan knight all good
Nathan Knight baybeeee
"they dont call him nathan ""human highlight reel"" knight for nothing."
Honestly my first reaction is who the hell is Nathan Knight
KD and Giannis will have to take minutes from Nathan Knight over my dead body
Nathan ‚Äú2 hands for safety‚Äù Knight
I am pretty sure Nathan Knight leads the league in posters per 36
NATHAN KNIGHT NATHAN KNIGHT NATHAN KNIGHT NATHAN KNIGHT NATHAN KNIGHT NATHAN KNIGHT NATHAN KNIGHT NATHAN KNIGHT NATHAN KNIGHT
"""This will go down as the Suns' worst loss of the year, getting rolled in Atlanta by the Hawks"" - Phoenix announcer  You know when Nathan Knight is getting Kodak moments that you're fucked"
"Nathan Knight, Hawks legend"
Time for Nathan Knight to earn his max contract.
Nathan Knight at the 3??
If Nathan Knight played point guard
"Brandon Goodwin on Harden, Skylar Mays on Kyrie, and Nathan Knight on Durant"
Here's a more accurate depth chart  PG: Trae Young/ Lou Williams/ Kris Dunn / Brandon Goodwin  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic/ Kevin Huerter  SF: Deandre Hunter/ Tony Snell/ Cam Reddish  PF: John Collins/ Danilo Gallinari/ Solomon Hill  C: Clint Capela/ Onyeka Okungwu/ Nathan Knight  Imo Tony Snell has taken the backup SF from Cam this season. But there's still some basketball left to be played and he could take it back if he returns from injury.
Also Nathan Knight was kind of dominating Bam there for a minute. Was wondering what the hell I was looking at
Our undrafted rookie Nathan Knight has had some pretty explosive dunks in the minutes he's gotten. [Here's one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_RvSD7TJZY) of my favorites.
Bro what the hell  You just forgot about Nathan Knight just like that? You definitely gotta slide him in the top 5
"Hawks gotta be up there. You're losing Trae, Clint, and JC.  LouWill, Bogi, Gallo, De'Andre Hunter, Nathan ""The Dark"" Knight, Kevin ""So Big It Might"" Huerter, Cam Reddish, Tony Snell, Okongwu all left over. Pick your poison"
Look up how much Gallo has played for us. He might have played a third of available games. Only the grizz bros have had more players miss time this year than the hawks. I'm sorry Luka doesn't get the benefit of the doubt because he has actual nba players coming off of his bench. We have had nathan knight play significant rotation minutes at multiple points this year. The only argument I am willing to concede is that ATL supporting cast is better than the mavericks but they aren't in a separate tier and if you count for missed game time Dallas even with the ceramic man known as porzingis has had the better stable supporting group.
The hawks theoretically have better depth. In actuality we‚Äôve been playing Nathan Knight and Skylar Mays for significant minutes for months.  Do you know them?
Nathan Knight hawks goat
"Nathan Knight looks like a funny dude. Not taking digs at his appearance,  he looks like a dude who can play to a crowd for laughs."
"He already has one. We got Trae Young, Lou Will, Tony Snell, Nathan Knight, and the ghost of Kris Dunn. We're loaded!"
"Between Skylar Mays, Nathan Knight, Bruno Fernando, and Kris Dunn, the Hawks have 24 chances to hack Ben Simmons."
"TIL Nathan Knight was born in a Golden Corral in Syracuse, NY"
"Yeah he also campaigned against Trae's foul drawing behind his back saying he hated it. Even if it's true it's bad obviously from a chemistry standpoint with your star player but also it impacts your ability to win games which should be your goal.   On top of that he was reportedly hard to approach by players and was unreasonably hard on Cam Reddish which might have contributed to his poor season preinjury. Reddish was actually better than Hunter last year.   Overall Pierce comes across like an egomaniac who cared about how the rest of the league viewed him rather than his own team.  Most coaches when they get fired it's like yeah they're disappointing, or maybe they don't fit the FO philosophy, or it's wrong place wrong time, so I never really have hard feelings but with Lloyd Pierce I almost want him to never have a job again. He's young so he might turn it around like a lot of other coaches do but it's just hard to shake how negative he was to a young roster, and it's not like he was ""right"" to justify such methods.  Like it's telling when Vince Carter as an announcer or legit end of bench players like Nathan Knight are talking about how the difference between McMillan and Pierce is night and day."
Nathan Knight
Nathan Knight had no idea why he was booed like Trae lmfao
nathan knight the real shake hero tonight
I swear everything nathan knight does is a highlight
"My Cavs lock his ass up this year.  It's just the last game with an actual coach, Nathan Knight feasted on my soft Allen and got free throws."
Made a Hawks fan out of me!  (Giving Nathan Knight a shot)
"Nathan Knight, you won't see him tho they are saving him for the finals"
PUT IN NATHAN KNIGHT
Not at all. He will help off his defender and is a better defender than *lemme check* Nathan knight who played most of last game and got cooked as a rookie
Man I really wanted a Nathan Knight dunk at the end üò≠
NATHAN KNIGHT IS IN THE BUILDING.
Put in Nathan Knight
I wanna see Nathan Knight just yam one over a Knick before end of the game.
Nathan knight getting an award?
Still couldn‚Äôt block Nathan Knight though
I did mine before I clicked on the thread and got exactly the same. Killed me to give up Nathan Knight and I'd miss BGoody too but can't do my boy Huerter like that.
"Closing out games: We had I think 10+ blown 4th quarter leads under LP  Better offensive scheme: McMillan started using Bogi as a ball handler and offensive playmaker more. LP had him mostly sitting in the corner as a spot up guy. Couple other adjustments as well like taking any kind of ball handling away from Gallo. Stopped giving Bruno Fernando minutes and gave them to Nathan Knight instead.  Belief in players: I didn't put a bunch of belief in this at the beginning of the season but it has become apparent that a lot of players, notably Trae and Collins, did not like LP as coach. They didn't like they way that he refused to give the players credit when they did something well. The change in coaching philosophy under McMillan lead to more even play by the team as the started gaining more confidence."
Hawks deserve a lot of credit. They fought hard and got to the conference finals. But the Bucks just wanted it more.  Shout-out to my man Nathan Knight and Marv Albert.
And Nathan Knight was the second to last active NBA player he mentioned.  Thanks Marv.
Okongwu and Nathan Knight
Nathan Knight
Having trouble finding Vegas odds on Nathan Knight for Finals MVP...
Nathan Knight has more points in conference finals than Joel Embiid and Luka Doncic combined
I‚Äôm really watching Skylar Mays and Nathan Knight highlight reels in the eastern conference finals this Hawks season is a movie
NATHAN KNIGHT HAS MORE POINTS IN CONFERENCE FINALS THAN JOEL EMBIID AND LUKA DONCIC COMBINED
Nathan says KNIGHT KNIGHT
"Reggie, we always know nathan knight is the GOAT. he doesn't need these minutes to show out."
Nathan Knight the GOAT
i needed a nathan knight playoff dunk
I need to see a Nathan knight poster
NATHAN KNIGHT
Nathan Knight is going to Yam it all over somebody
"As I said I think Russell and Magic are separated from those a bit and closer to Wilt.  And I could see above him, but that is me, but not above the other 3.  Also Pistol Pete and Nathan Knight, since you seem like a basketball patrician."
"Gotta feel for Nathan Knight and Justin Jackson, whoever they are. Only players on their teams to not score tonight."
Nathan Knight better be okay he's a real champ.
Nathan knight on the hawks I believe
Nathan Knight
Nathan knight on the Hawks
"Nathan Knight for Atlanta. He got the block but was way too wild on the effort and got his legs taken out by his teammate, making him land on his back."
Y'all Nathan Knight is just warming up he's going to put up 60 in the last 7 minutes.
Nathan Knight fixin to lead the 40-point 4th quarter comeback
Oh shit Nathan Knight hours
"Sure we can, Nathan ‚Äúthe dark‚Äù Knight!"
Nathan Knight
Is Cam even active? I see Nathan Knight on the depth chart lol
He‚Äôs still out IIRC. We‚Äôve got Nathan Knight on the depth chart rn‚Ä¶ *Nathan Knight*
"Nah man, Nathan Knight is a center."
I love that Nathan Knight is the second big you listed  The absolute goat
"Hawks could be in trouble‚Ä¶what if JC, Nathan Knight, Gallo and Okongwu all get injured and we need Bruno?   He needs to think about how this impacted the team."
nathan knight
Nathan Knight legacy game next
They're saving their trump card: Nathan Knight.  Best player ever from one of the historically worst bball schools. Go Tribe.
Nathan Knight MIP
Well that was fucking fun wasnt it? Jaylen Nowell hit some crazy ass shots. The pace and space team ball was amazing to watch. And the defence in this and the Chicago game were absolutely stellar. Very very impressed.  If I HAD to make criticisms it would be that we still kinda pulled into the middle giving up some open 3s and Nathan Knight wasnt as physically imposing as I had hoped. But damn that was nice
Nathan Knight
"I'll try yo cheer you up a big on Nathan Knight lmao. He acted so cocky yesterday, had 7 fouls and 1 technical foul, played against the Spurs that have no real center so there was no interior defense."
"Hawks signed Johnny Hamilton as 15th man..  Couldve retained Nathan Knight (who is genuinely awesome) snagged Omer Yurtseven, or pursued Paul Millsap/Isaiah Hartenstein  Dare I say it but this was Travis Schlenk's only misstep this offseason"
First we didn't simply give Nathan Knight a contract... then we couldn't lock up Yurtseven  I was personally looking out for Millsap or Hartenstein but I guess 15th man is an extremely hard sell
Nathan Knight and Naz Reid off the bench is gonna be sublime
Nathan Knight
"We, the Wolves, certainly haven't. It's more a product of our minimal cap space but we made a lateral move healthy for depth across the roster and hope to resign our &lt;7$$ per year role guys (who can be legitimately impactful at times). Not a lot of upside in terms of creative roster building, as our assets seem kinda mismatched in regards to the guys it would make sense to bring in to our roster.   The upside is even our fringe rotational guys have a fair amount of upside going into the season. Jaylen Nowell, Jordan McLaughlin, Jarred  Vanderbilt, (Nathan Knight?), Juancho Hernangomez are all guys that could credibly play better next year than last. How much better is unknown. I personally believe Malik Beasley's play will make GMs reassess his value more highly. Also we're still just riding the high of Anthony Edwards, so life could be worse."
We signed Nathan Knight and McKinley Wright fyi
I hope Nathan Knight dunks on us to show Travis what a mistake he made
"Not a trade, but not re-signing Nathan Knight made me very sad"
I think most of these takes are bad but I love the prospect of Nathan Knight starting for an NBA team so I'm with you
"Timberwolves:  Jarred Vanderbilt is extremely replaceable and not worth $5 million a year.  Jarrett Culver should be ahead of Josh Okogie in the rotation because he has more upside on offense.  A team can never have enough offense, so signing Lauri Markkanen to a deal worth $15-$18 million a year isn't a terrible idea.  If we don't get a PF, Nathan Knight should start at C while KAT moves to PF.  Naz Reid is best suited for a bench role."
"Nathan Knight and some local guy from Minny, Wright something."
Thank god for Ant. If this team can build a winning culture and some sort of identity then recruiting free agents will be a lot easier. Doesn't really help that we don't have money but at least we brought Prince back to Minnesota. I also like Nathan Knight.
"Nathan Knight has the Gerald Green tendency of turning any open lane into an absolute poster of a dunk.   He can ""sorta shoot"" too. He's definitely worth taking a flier on, he has the physical talent to compete and his game has a lot of room for growth."
"Wow Nathan Knight to the Timberwolves, what an offseason acquisition for the least appealing destination in the league. How did they do it"

we signed nathan knight
100% agree. Mays and Nathan Knight were a ton of fun in limited minutes and hopefully they're brought back cause I'd love to watch more of them under coach McMillan!
Put Nathan Knight in the dunk contest immediately.
Nathan Knight why not
Nathan Knight!
"And Jalen, don‚Äôt forget Jalen. Oh shit, Nathan Knight too. Summer league is gonna be POPPIN"
Nathan Knight
Nathan Knight gonna smoke em in training camp
"Sry for the homer but im gonna bet $1k on the Hawks over.    1. Hawks were one of the most injured teams last year - our only injuries this year will be Okongwu for half the year and Hunter for maybe a few games.   2. Coach change turned around almost every team stat 180 degrees   3. Young players will at least get slightly better   4. We lost Tony Snell, Bruno Fernando, Brandon Goodwin, Nathan Knight (one 9th man + g-leaguers) for Delon Wright, Dieng, and 2 solid rookies.    All this and we are only set to get roughly the same record as last year (last year we had 41 wins in a 72 game season)..? Easy money here."
Brandon Goodwin behind the back pass to Nathan Knight for the jam!
Nathan Knight needs more minutes
"No no, Nathan Knight plays basketball. Bruno‚Ä¶ well, he does _something_ but it‚Äôs not quite basketball."
i think you mean we lost team mascot Nathan Knight
Take care of our Nathan Knight and we will cherish Deing
"Whole hardheartedly agree with this. I think Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Pistol Pete were equally talented and the best two college players ever [behind Nathan Knight]... Kareem just happened to be 7'2""... So he is number 1 [behind Nathan Knight] easily  (also there was no three point line nor shot clock which hurt Pete and Kareem had the best coach of all time and likely a much better supporting cast though idk much about the makeup of the teams)"
Isaiah Miller would be amazing to have on a 2-way and I think Nathan Knight with his NBA experience deserves at least a minimum contract to free up said 2-way slot but the wolves are right up against moving into the luxury(to the point where a minimum will push us into it) so I don't think it'll work out
"Timberwolves, hoping Nathan Knight has a good season"
"I thought I read that Pat Bev was already vaccinated?  It‚Äôs likely new players, so Bolmaro makes sense. You could also potentially see Taurean Prince in that category. But it also could be the young guys (like Nathan Knight or McKinley Wright)."
"Nathan Knight has been inches from getting meaningful minutes two nights in a row, only to have Naz hang on."
"Saw some people doing this for their teams so wanted for my own  1. Towns 2. Edwards 3. DLo 4. Vando 5. Bev 6. Naz 7. Beasley 8. McDaniels  Which leaves: Okogie, Prince, Nathan Knight, Jordan MacLaughin, Nowell, Bolmaro  They prob don‚Äôt take anyone, although Bolmaro potentially could be nice tbh. Dude just doesn‚Äôt see minutes"
"I  checked this out on bball ref, and it's unfortunately a little messy to analyze from their platform. Filtering out non-qualifiers leaves out some key guys like Anthony Davis because of injuries either last year or this, but opening it up to all and doing per 36 brings absolute legends such as Nathan Knight and Eugene Omoruyi to the top of the list. So I'm doing some filtering in Excel and will bring any good findings back."
