"Kuz, Aaron Gordon, Monte Morris, Lonnie Walker"
Jokic Murray MPJ Monte Morris JaMychal Green
"Not contesting your point on Graham, but it's extremely generous to call 6.2 AST/1.4 TO a 6 to 1 ratio. It's about 4.5 to 1. If you use rounded numbers to calculate that ratio you're gonna get some inflated values  Monte Morris is the god of AST/TO and is at 5.67 to 1 right now. 6 to 1 would be earth shattering"
"**Pleasant**: Monte Morris. Dude has gotten better every year and in an early season where most outside of Joker are struggling, Monte has been a constant point and play making boost off of the bench. Oh and JaMychal Green is dope.   **Unpleasant**: Everyone else, really. Will and Gary have taken their time getting back in the groove.. Will is more frustrating to watch because his game revolves around having the ball.. Gary as well though because he should be a critical piece in our offense and just... isn't, but we need his defense.  MPJ went and broke protocols so while it's nice he's back missing him for 20 days was annoying.   Facu had a great game yesterday but otherwise was having a rough transition to NBA ball while being undersized.  I didn't really expect Jamal to seriously ascend to All-Stardom, but injuries are making him less impactful than usual.   I've been annoyed with Millsap since the restart. He just isn't a great fit, but as long as he can hit occasional threes he isn't a huge detriment."
"RAPTOR has CJ 7th with Capela, ahead of Lebron, AD, Gobert, KD. It also has Jordan Clarkson and Fred VanVleet as the 15th and 16th most impactful players, above Steph and Beal. It also has Patty Mills ahead of Giannis, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, and Lillard. What an accurate statistic! Advanced stats are meaningless, just use your eyes and you can see Lebron is clearly the most impactful player in the league  edit: Not to mention Shake Milton, Delon Wright, Terry Rozier, Bobby Portis, and Monte Morris have a higher RAPTOR than Donovan Mitchell despite him playing with Conley like you said. Since RAPTOR is such a good stat, Utah's GM should have been fired yesterday for giving 82nd best player in the NBA a max contract when he's no better than Josh Hart."
Idk man I think all these stats have their flaws. Idk that I can trust a stat that has Monte Morris ranked higher overall than Jokic.
yes Monte Morris and Goran Dragic basically the same player
"and neither that performance or the heat's run are repeatable, as good as they were  there's no one in the league paying that much for that role - monte morris just got $8M for the same job, backup pg that sometimes closes games  keep in mind you get $110M to build a team, contenders are over the cap at $130M or so  i'd learn a bit more about basketball before acting so smug on the interwebs if i were you but thankfully i'm not"

Monte Morris
"lmao alright. It's literally every 30 minutes, someone posts a thread about how Luka is overrated because we are 8-10, like we aren't dealing with injuries/COVID.  Have fun if your team ever gets COVID and Murray/Millsap/Porter etc... are all out for weeks, and instead of having any sort of rational thought, redditers just think your team sucks and that Nikola Jokic is horrible because he isn't winning more games with Vlatko Cancar, Monte Morris, Isaiah Hartenstein, and PJ Dozier as his starters."
Think Monte Morris would thrive on the Sixers as a starter PG and play Ben at the PF
Monte Morris
Monte Morris although he isn't an underachiever. He's very good but not a starter or star.
monte morris and jalen brunson
Monte Morris &amp; Gary Harris. Smooth buttery playmaking and shooting with elite perimeter defense.
I love Monte Morris
I was a bit confused by the nuggets team not giving the ball to Jokic in the clutch. Isn't he one of the clutchest players in the league. Jamal Murray needs to delegate to superiors. Monte Morris seems like a great player and I wouldn't be surprised if he becomes like a grant after leaving Denver
Monte Morris &gt; Gary Harris
Monte Morris is working CP3
Monte Morris is the mvp of this game.
I’ve never seen Monte Morris make a mistake.
"You have to look beyond the record. Jokic has been utterly dominant, just as much as Embiid has been while also literally running the offense and setting up his teammates - dude leads the league in assists, as a center. He's 4th in the NBA in steals. Leads the league in PER, and is at or near the top in BPM, DRPM, TPA, etc. He's scored or assisted on 42% of the Nuggets made baskets this year, which is the highest percent in the NBA (next closest is Luka at 40%, and PG and Embiid are closer to like 25% each respectively since people are mentioning them). And honestly he's doing this with teammates that mostly have been subpar so far.  What I mean partly - the Nuggets have been incomplete the whole year. Murray hurt his elbow in the 3rd game and hasnt really be right since, missed one game but he's still bothered by it. JaMychal Green missed the first four games, and MPJ missed the last 10, so the Nuggets depth/size at forward has been quite bad mostly. Monte Morris has been steady as always, PJ Dozier is ok, defends well, JaMychal Green has been solid as a backup 4... but Gary Harris is still one of the worst shooters in the NBA, and Will Barton has been wildly up and down (and REALLY cant finish at the rim). Paul Millsap is incapable of finishing in the paint anymore, for the most part. Like, Jokic's teammates have really not been very good, and he still is just dominant (to add a bit more evidence, only 3 Nuggets have a positive net rating when playing without Jokic - Murray, Monte Morris, and PJ Dozier). It's not a stretch to say that Jokic is quite literally the only thing separating the Nuggets from being average right now in record (with the 5th best net rating in the NBA mind you), and being utterly awful, like worst team in the NBA. With him on the floor the Nuggets offensive rating is 120. With him off, it's 97 which is historically bad (and also the largest difference in offensive on-off rating in the NBA by a HUGE margin). If all that doesn't make someone an MVP candidate I dunno what does."
Monte Morris   JaMychal Green
Monte Morris makes 9 starting next year since he extended
Monte Morris
Monte Morris + ?  Two most valuable sub $2M contracts in the NBA that I can think of.

Nuggets with Jokic on the court are a top seed team. The 2nd unit has been useless. Not include MPJ cause sample size:  Jokic is OBPM and DBPM of 8.5 and 2.9 and only one with a positive BPM.  2nd highest OBPM is monte Morris at 1.5. 2nd highest DBPM is Dozuer at -1.2.  His on/off this season has been +16.4.  He is hard carrying this team so badly
mOnTe mORrIS iS ThE mAn  Did you steal this post from someone else too Lurk?
"If you set a [minimum of 80 possessions](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/ball-handler/#!?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PPP&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=POSS*GE*80) (Monte Morris has 36), you get Beal, Lillard, SGA, Curry, LaVine, Conley, and Ingram."
"it would take a straight fleecing for the nuggets to get gordon   the only tradeable assets of value they have are monte morris and 2 of their picks (might even be 1 due to protections on pick they owe okc), which are likely to be worthless after getting gordon for so little"
"Yea I'm curious if it was just Murray that messed up. He pointed to Monte Morris as if to swap, but Morris had his back to Murray. Either way Murray was standing in the middle of nowhere.  That's at least partially brilliant by the Jazz to design a play (or maybe impromptu?) to get it to the player who they definitely wouldn't pass it to."
MPJ and Monte Morris for the Nuggets
That's why I thought Monte Morris would get a big deal.  A team like the Bulls or the Knicks would get so much more out of their young talent with him around. Glad he stayed in Denver though
"Not reallly. Their stats are pretty similar.  The main difference is Monte Morris is one of the most efficient ball handlers in the league. Him and Pritchard both average 3 assists a game, Pritchard averages 2 turnovers to Morris’ 0.4 a game.    He’s not way better lol . Probably will be one day but definitely not now"
Monte Morris
Monte Morris has nice chemistry with everyone.
Green has been very very very good for the nuggets thus far. He and Monte Morris have a nice chemistry as well.   Nuggets bench gonna be nice when MPJ comes back from Covid (either with MPJ or Barton coming off the bench)
Monte Morris   Kcp    Mikal Bridges   Crowder    Boucher
I wish they’d just sit him for a few games. Monte Morris is a starting-quality PG.
sixers would be better with jalen brunson or monte morris instead of ben
"I'm in a similar boat where I hate the Nuggets, but have a soft spot for Jokic, Murray, Gary Harris, Millsap, Craig, MPJ, and Monte Morris"
Monte Morris over Westbrook
Monte Morris ballin.  Bench doesn't suck
Monte Morris is our best pg rn not close
No way why would you play Monte Morris over Russ are you mad

Will Barton and Monte Morris are most likely 15+ppg guys on other teams too.   Damn that Nuggets team was deep. Looking like what the Clippers were supposed to be lol.
monte morris with 11:1 lmao
Monte Morris
"I'm just wondering what the hell is going on w/ the Nuggets? Jokic's insane play should be making the game easier for his teammates. I guess MPJ being in COVID protocol forever b/c he refuses to quarantine properly, plus Will Barton thinking he's the shit, and Gary Harris losing his shooting will do that to you. Millsap's still pretty good but old af. And losing longbois Craig and Grant didn't seem to help.  Hopefully Monte Morris and PJ Dozier take a huge leap this year. I'd really like Jokic to win MVP this season, or at least come in 2nd."
"He's still getting paid 20m  Nuggets would look something like this - Murray (30m) + Jokic (30m) + Gary Harris  (20m) + Grant (20m) + Barton (15m) + Monte Morris (10m)   You don't have any money to sign JaMychal Green and I'm no salary cap expert I think you have to let Paul Millsap go if you want to talk about the future with MPJ and potentially the possibility of an extension the next year, Gary Harris by then would become a FA though, so you can choose to resign or let him leave in FA because you probably can't pay him as much as he would like.  From in the 2020 season advanced stats show the Nuggets offense and defense was better when he was off the court, but idk - check in 2 months time to see if he's still ballin."
Caruso is not getting 15m a year. Something like Monte Morris money is more likely
"They also had all the following calls:   They said pj Dozier was JaMychel green  They said green was monte Morris  The called him montee the entire game  They twice said Gary Davis  Will barone was a person  The said mpj was out injured  They said nuggets bench missed MPJ, who is a starter who rarely plays with the bench this year.   Your dudes just sucked at their job today. It's ok to admit that"
"He said Walton was the best passer because he win a championship. Walton himself thinks jokic is a better passer, and a championship has nothing to do with passing.  They also had all the following calls:   They said pj Dozier was JaMychel green  They said green was monte Morris  The called him montee the entire game  They twice said Gary Davis  Will barone was a person  The said mpj was out injured  They said nuggets bench missed MPJ, who is a starter who rarely plays with the bench this year.   Your dudes just sucked at their job today. It's ok to admit that"
"I mean they also were terrible at like... knowing anything that was happening.   The said pj Dozier was green  They said green was monte Morris  The called him montee the entire game  They twice said Gary Davis  Will barone was a person  The said mpj was out injured  They said nuggets bench missed MPJ, who is a starter who rarely plays with the bench this year.   They said Jokic passing wasn't looking as heralded as they thought as he had 12 assists.  BUT they did nail the pronunciation on Hartenstein lol.   They were just clueless out there"
"Called PJ Dozier Jamychal Green, Monty Morris instead of Monte, Will Borson?, said our bench is missing MPJ(who is our starter) due to injury(out for covid protocol, not injured), and said Bill Walton is the best passing big of all time because he's a winner. Just a rough game to listen to."
"&gt; He’s a one dimensional playmaker. A decent passer with little court vision.   That's good enough for a backup role. The number of backup PGs with excellent court vision can be counted on 1 hand  - Rondo, Lamelo (who will probably be starting by February), Rubio, maybe Monte Morris if you're being generous. It's not like Corey Joseph or Reggie Jackson or Jalen Brunson have great court vision."
Look at another Steve Prohm coached PG in Monte Morris...he’s had the best A/T ratio since he’s been in the league and has the career record in college. I don’t like him as a coach for Iowa State but the dude can find a point guard.
"Nuggets for MPJr, Monte Morris, a few picks and other filler"
"Also, Monte Morris missed his second free throw and Jokic tipped it in, yet they only counted it as 1pt as if Monte made the FT"
"Monte Morris by a mile. Top 20 pg in the league imo, plays backup to Jamal Murray. But nobody takes him from denver"
"This is a wild take to me.  Lebron has more gravity, and he obviously has a shit ton of experience on Jokic. But jokic’s court vision is second to none. He’s seriously a savant when it comes to being able to look at the floor and knowing what will happen 5 seconds into the future.  Just as an off the top of my head example, checkout this [no look assist from his game last night](https://twitter.com/msinger/status/1346182108524343296?s=21).  He knows the nuggets have (or should have) a guy in the far corner. He knows that faking towards Monte in the near corner and/or a cutting Gary Harris will cause a rotation from Rubio along the baseline, but he’s gotta sell it. So he stares down the area between Morris abs Harris, prompting Rubio to rotate, because he has to. Jokic then, without resetting or anything, flicks it cross court to Facu (a small target) **dead center** to allow him to smoothly catch and shoot. No having to corral a wild pass, reset his feet, then shoot. Just catch and shoot. Perfect pass.  I suspect as he’s doing this, he’s watching for Rubio from his peripheral vision (though probably can’t see facu) and if Ricky doesn’t rotate he just hits the cutting Gary Harris for the free 2 points.  That’s just one example of his court vision taken from a single play from his most recent game. And he’s been doing this same shit pretty routinely for 4-5 years now."
G: Monte Morris G: Paul George F: Got overpaid this summer but Jerami Grant F: Injured but I love Jonathan Isaac C: Richaun Holmes
"Both teams are in the same boat at the moment.  Denver look terrible offensively without Jokic on the court. For Denver, Murray, Monte Morris and MPJ have had periods where they have been excellent.  For Denver, Gary Harris has been ok defensively but awful offensively. For Denver, Will Barton, Milsap, P.J. Dojier have oscillated from Okay to unplayable. Green has looked good in short spurts for Denver and probably deserves more minutes.  The Raptors barely look like an NBA team without Lowry. For the Raptors, Boucher &amp; Van Vleet have had periods where they have been excellent. For the Raptors, OG has been good defensively but his offense has been iffy. For the raptors, Siakam, Powell, T.D have all oscillated between okay to unplayable. For the raptors, Matt Thomas has looked good and should get more minutes, especially when the raptors has periods where they can't hit a 3 to save their lives.  But overall as things settle down, I thing the Nuggets will be fine because Jokic's facilitation has been sublime. If Gary Harris and Will Barton stop missing open shots/layups they will be fine.  Really worried about the raptors, especially, if Siakam can't get back to an all-star level"
"Right now? Basketball.   Overall and looking ahead a bit: depth. If Barton and Harris continue to play the way they currently are then the Nuggets really only have 3 legit starting calibre players, maybe 4 if you throw in Millsap. The bench would be solid if Barton picks thing up with Monte Morris, Jamychal Green but the team going forward is perpetually a couple of shooting slumps or injuries away from being terrible like they are right now."
"Not concerned about the Nuggets but Gary Harris &amp; Monte Morris have to improve. They are going to need those two, alongside Barton, to step up when MPJ is absent."
"definitely. Apart from having Murray who's a great scorer, Porter Jr, Barton, Monte Morris, Millsap, Gary Harris, Green, PJ Dozier and Campazzo are decent or good rotation options.   Sixers have just Embiid, Simmons, Harris, Curry, Green, Shake Milton and Dwight as decent rotation guys. Then the likes of Korkmaz, Thybulle or Maxey who are way too green for the current nba  denver has 10 nba guys vs the Sixers 7"
"I want to put some respect on Monte Morris. I think he's an incredibly good backup point guard. He's been a top assist/turnover ratio player like every year he's played, and he dominates the end of the 1st and 3rd quarter. I don't remember the exact stat, but I remember he lead the league in points in like the last minute of those quarters."
"The nuggets players with the most minutes this season are Jokic, Murray, MPJ, Will Barton, Monte Morris. Jokic is a better defender than any of them."
"Eh, we got lots of dudes to watch in the NBA (so we don't have to watch the Flyin' Pr0-16hms this year). Monte Morris, Georges Niang, THT, Matt Thomas, Abdel Nader, Haliburton. All having solid years, and all but Tyrese on good-ish teams."
Why wouldn’t Malone have Monte Morris play with the bench?
"Covid   He looks gassed in the game, having a hard time chasing shooters around on defense, Monte Morris is giving him extreme cardio"
"&gt;literally, without any exaggeration, every other rotation player injured  Are you counting Monte Morris missing one game and Barton missing three? Not many guys around the league have played every game this season. I don't think the Nuggets are unique in this regard."
Monte Morris
Eric Green &gt; Monte Morris and its not even close really...
"Terry better than Monta? what? you talking about Monta Ellis or Monte Morris, cause in what world in Jason Terry better than Monta Ellis?"
"Yes it is, in the context of franchise leaders. Rate stats mean way less on franchise leaderboards, per the examples I gave you. Counting stats mean a lot more, that the player played with the franchise at a high level for a long time. No one gives a shit that kyrie Irving leads the celtics in PER because he basically played one season. Nor that Daniel Theis has the highest offensive rating. If lebron had played half a season here he'd be the leader in a bunch of rate stats. Plumlee is the nuggets leader in efg%. Monte Morris has a higher offensive rating than Jokic.   Rate stats mean a clearly lesser player can be on the leaderboard. That's damn hard to do with counting stats for a franchise"
Have you met Monte Morris? Dude literally is exactly what you are describing.
"The Monte Morris Effect, ladies and gentlemen..."
Monte Morris?  Grizz fans love Tyus Jones - I think he rarely turns the ball over but he's not much of a shooter

Throw Monte Morris in there too
Monte Morris is at 5.3 for his career
What about the count of monte ast/TO (monte Morris). Hes held the best ratio for a few years.
"Thank NBA for giving us a surprise game against the Nuggets right now, I really wanted that, really.  &amp;nbsp;  Anyway, expected lineups for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Expected Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (10-19) | [](/DEN)Nuggets (15-13) ---|---   D.

Jamal Murray and Will Barton are below average defenders. MPJ is waaaay below average. Gary Harris and 36 year old Millsap are good but both have missed at least 1/3 of each season for the last three seasons. Y’all seriously underestimate how bad the Nuggets are defensively regardless of Jokic.   Furthermore the only true PGs on the team are Monte Morris and Facu Campazzo. If you replace Jokic with Embiid the loss in playmaking outweighs the gain in rim protection.
The only true PGs on the team are Monte Morris and Facu Campazzo. The playmaking on that team would be atrocious. And Embiid ain’t gonna fix the terrible guard defense and all the corner threes they already give up.  They’d lose more on offense than they’d gain on defense.
"Murray is inconsistent maybe due to injuries,   Grant is gone,   Millsap is older and injured,   Plumlee gone and his replacement is a G league caliber(hartenstein),   Garry Harris injured,   pj dozier injured,   Jamychal Green playing very badly for two weeks and occasionally injured,   Bol Bol is useless,   Monte Morris injured,   Barton unavailable due to personal reasons,   MPJ Shooting 20% so mostly benched also due to very bad plays not just bad shooting  basically 3 people can play right now except rookies. Campazzo, Joker and Murray available only"
Yes for some Monte Morris shoutout. He’s the 2nd most consistent guy in the team.
"Bro Monte was out last night due to injury. Monte Morris, Gary Harris, Will Barton, Paul Milsap, PJ Dozier were all out. Every single one of those guys is a 20 minute player (PJ probably in the 12-18 range).  We're just not able to find our groove because everyone keeps getting fucking hurt all the time. We just played 18 games in the playoffs in October. Like... This team is exhausted and talent-wise worse than last year (IE missing Grant, Craig, and Plumlee)."
I don’t see Harris or Barton this season to be a game changing factor when playing. Also Monte Morris isn’t a game changing factor...they were missing consistency from everyone besides Jokic.
Not Monte Morris though!
"My tinfoil theory is that our backup PG Monte Morris was in a Jrue Holliday package before Milwaukee came off the top rope, but we didn't want to go back on our word to him when the deal fell through"
"Oh shit i confused him and Monte Morris for a second, was legit confused at your take lol"
"Idk man that Nuggets bench is pretty good, they got:  Monte Morris  Facundo Campazzo  PJ Dozier  JaMychal Green  Paul Millsap  &amp;#x200B;  Idk if it's better defensively but efficiency wise they are (even tho they don't shoot at the volume the Knicks bench does), not to mention 11-15 they are by far the best in the NBA imo. I mean RJ Hampton, Zeke Nnaji, Bol Bol, are all getting minutes on most teams imo."
And Monte Morris at 51st
 2016 – Malik Beasley – 19th overall  2017 – Monte Morris – 51st overall  2018 – MPJ – 14th overall  2020 – Zeke Nnaji – 22nd Overall  2020 – RJ Hampton – 24th overall  The way this FO keeps hitting on these mid/late-round picks is crazy
Bro he has monte Morris and Facundo campazzo as his primary perimeter defenders
Monte Morris flailing his arms and calling for the ball like he’s Lebron fuckin James over here
"I’m a bad homer, but Nuggets are so deep, Idk who will play when we are fully healthy:  Monte Morris, Facu Campazzo, RJ Hampton, PJ Dozier all legit role-players  and the only non-guard bench rotation player: JaMychal Green"
Monte Morris.  It's gonna be Monte Morris
"Since the Mavs really need another facilitator behind Luka, I could see them giving up Josh Richardson and another guy for Monte Morris and Gary Harris."
Monte Morris is not a top 4 guard for the Nuggets?
"One of my favorites too, that game February last year was one of the best of the year too  I think he went that hard too because somebody like Monte morris was talkin a lotta trash too, so LeBron turned it on starting with that dunk"
"**2020**: Zeke Nnaji at 22, RJ Hampton at 24.  **2019:** Bol Bol at 44.  **2018:** Michael Porter Jr at 14.  **2017:** Monte Morris at 51.  **2016:** Jamal Murray at 7, Malik Beasley at 19  **2014:** Nikola Jokic at 41."
"Bradley Beal is the worst defender at SG in the league by and is negative in most advanced stat metrics.   Jokic is far from it and is positive in most advances stay metrics. If only Jokic had LeBron, Schroeder,  Gasol and others to help him, instead he has MPJ playing at the 3, 36 year old millsap, Monte Morris, and will Barton."
My brother is a warriors fan and he seriously wants to trade Monte Morris for oubre lol. Monte can't be traded though.
"Better: Monte Morris. Underrated back up guard, probably best in the league (a lil bias). Smart player and knows to take care of the rock.  Worse: Will Barton. Super inconsistent. I’d rather play MPJ with heavy minutes."
"Nuggs had a team of Monte Morris, Barton, Grant, Millsap and Jokic last year - all 2nd rounders. Not saying the hit rate is all that high, but just about every team has contributing 2nd round players."
Monte Morris seems around there
"Steph, Greek Freak, Zion, Luka, and Monte Morris."
"Nuggets have three. Jok, Murray, Facu, and the king of assist to turn over ratio Monte Morris."
"Man, he reminds me so much of Monte Morris."
yo monte morris really nice
Monte Morris
Monte Morris is better than Tj McConnell. I have hot takes here all day
"I'd say Monte Morris, Rubio, and Dinwiddie are all in contention"
Monte Morris hands down
"Nuggets clearly first, the Blazers/Mavs/Warriors would all kill to have Aaron Gordon &amp; MPJ as their 3rd &amp; 4th best players.  Also Monte Morris is the best reserve guard on any of these teams (Norm Powell is a starter &amp; a wing)"
"Sorry brother I've recently learned to like parts of the Philly fanbase and it's an amazing City but their announcers are absolute PISS. Especially the color guy who is a toxic fuck, play by play guy just seems to say names wrong. How hard is Monte Morris and Gary Harris to say?"
"TC has been great, as has our scouting team.   I remember some fans were against trading future assets under the idea of “why are you taking picks away from TC when he’s so good at using them!” And other fans were saying “but we need to consolidate; plus, if TC is so good at drafting, he can replenish the young talent with whatever picks we retain anyway!”  I’ve even been impressed with the guys we have brought in to summer league or as UDFA/2-way guys. A short list from the past few years:  -	Torrey craig -	kenrich Williams -	pj dozier -	Terence Davis   And that’s not even including second round guys like Monte Morris and bol Bol who we ended up having as 2-way guys who spent some time in the g-league.  Really the biggest misses I can remember from this FO in the past few years are:  -	Emmanuel mudiay -	trading back from 12 to get Trey lyles and trying to snag OG anunoby at 24, only to have Masai snipe him at 23 and seemingly not having a backup plan and selecting Tyler Lydon  One of the “what if’s” we still have is if we had just selected anunoby at 12 instead of that trade. Would have a huge ripple effect through the NBA. Do the jazz still find a trade partner to go snag Mitchell? If so, does that trade affect other teams? Do the raptors still win the ship without OG (certainly not the biggest piece but a good cog in the system). Do the nuggets still end up getting MPJ the next year?"
...did you just say Monte Morris has no floor general abilities? Have you watched him play lol?
6'4 shooting guard is about average I guess. But he's got a small frame which allows him to be quick. Monte morris is a better playmaker for sure but when he plays with jokic he just focuses on scoring
To me Hampton looks like an undersized shot creator with no floor general abilities. Exactly like monte morris and we know which one the nuggets decided to keep.
"Ya, for sure!  I think having Monte Morris with him on the second unit will help him a ton as well.  Monte can create his own shot and make a pass, which will help create some space for him."
Glad to see the ever steady Monte Morris back
Monte Morris is pretty good I guess
"Or the nuggs, no monte Morris. Our second unit is atrocious with facu running it alone"
"Monte Morris is back soon, going to make a huge difference for that second unit.  Pretty excited to see JaVale playing with those guys as well.    But ya, the second unit we have been running out the last couple weeks would absolutely ruin us in the playoffs."
"What the heck are you talking about? Murray hasn't been the most durable of players. He's been in and out of the injury list throughout his career so far. Early in the season, he was apparently playing injured and instead of resting him, Malone's dumb ass let him play contributing to Nuggets losses. There were many games early in the season where Murray's games were so bad he might as well have been playing for the opponent. And it's not like the Nuggets don't have a capable starting quality back up in Monte Morris.  In prior years, Harris was part of the core. He has been injury riddled for most of his career. Milsap's old ass was also part of the core and he has become so injury prone in his old age.  I think Gordon's durability is so-so. I think he missed about 30 games in one season. Too lazy to look it up. The jury is still out on MPJ's young career. The Nuggets' med staff say he has the same probability of re-injuring his back as a play that didn't have the injury in the first place."
"We beat them pretty soundly last night on the road and they had PG and Morris back, we were missing Monte who is big for us (bench scored 11 lol) so idk man. Certainly not easily"
"They didn’t have AG, Barton, or Javale last year and MPJ wasn’t playing nearly this good.  They also have the MVP this year and Jamal is having a career year.   With the squad they have now they are in the top tier. 140 offensive rating almost with a 90 defensive rating with the current starting 5 against 2 of the best offenses in the league and 3-0 since getting AG.   Plus Monte Morris hasn’t played in any of those games and comes back Sunday.   They are absolutely in that top tier"
"Absolutely better than last year. I’ll start with Grant. In the pre covid part of the season Grant was a 6th man for us. He was streaky on offense and inconsistent on defense. He continued to develop and earned his minutes as the season went on eventually leading to his outstanding defense in the WCF against Lebron. That’s what non-Nuggets fans saw and thought that’s the player he always is. AG is a better player than Grant for our team, no question about it. MPJ is being ignored by a lot of people, in the last two weeks this man is putting up elite numbers, crashing the boards, and playing strong defense. AG opened up the floor for MPJ and since his arrival MPJ looks like a superstar. Eons ahead of where he was in the bubble. Gary Harris is a Nuggs legend, but he has been off the court so much with injuries these last two seasons and his offense had taken a nose dive. The team was clearly better defensively with him on the floor but our offense was still stagnate. Our guard defense was never bad though without him. Our wing defense was horrendous though which is where the addition of AG elevates the entire team. There’s less need for guys to come off their man or out of their zone to help the wing defender which is what was freeing up so much offense for our opponents. The last thing is the depth of this team now. With a healthy Monte Morris we have two starting caliber guards to pick from as a 6th man. Our second unit will be Monte/Barton, Dozier/Facu, Milsap, Green, McGee with some fluidity in the positions they play. Behind them you have effective guys like Nnaji, Gary Clark, and potentially Bol and Cancar. Idk if it will be enough to take on Brooklyn, but two weeks ago I would have thought we stood no chance against them. I personally felt we over performed on the bubble and that was enough to get us to where we got. This team is much better than last years and if Mal can put up 75% of what he did in the bubble and the team stays healthy, we can win it all."
"&gt;Morris and Campazzo are both better than Harris on both offense and defense.  No they’re not. Gary was our best defender, period. Facu has great energy and is pesky, plus he has the ability to make other players use the wrong 2k animation, so that comes in clutch. Monte is the best backup point guard in the league and reliable at both ends, nothing bad to say, but not as strong of a fender as Gary was. When he was healthy, of course."
"good thing is monte morris is returning next game , not that our coach is qick to make changes but at least we can hope. Worst thing that can happen to us is a hot barton start, that usually means a lot of stupid shots thru the game, when you look at the box score he had a solid game but the timing if some of those bricks were killing us. He overdribbles all the te , cant make good entry passes, doesnt really look to find the open man and somehow he is regarded as a playmaker."
"Oh, believe me, I see the clamor to put 6'1"" Monte Morris in the starting lineup  I'm like come on this is a 6'5"" guy who gave you 15/6/4 last year playing out of position, offense is consistently great in his minutes. Just accept the occasional Shaqtin' moment lol"
"Monte Morris is gonna take those Campazzo minutes, he’ll be back Sunday."
Monte Morris coming back will really help our stagnant bench I think
I think Monte Morris is back this weekend.
That’s where we miss monte Morris. He’s money from end of quarters 1-3.
Monte Morris please come back soon
Monte Morris is skedded to return Sunday.
"Monte Morris still out, only significant injury."
Monte Morris is probably going to start and he's a playmaking guard
Gary Harris missed 25 games.   MPJ missed 10.  Millsap missed 10.   Jamychal Green missed 13 games.  Monte Morris missed 11 games.  Dozier missed 15.  All of these guys are in their rotation and play 20+ minutes.
"he's on the level of the best backups, idk if he's the  monte morris namely"
"Jokic, Murray, Monte Morris, Gary Harris, and Giannis.  Monte / Murray / Gary / Giannis / Jokic would be a pretty good lineup, but would have no answer for the Lakers. So it'd probably make it to the 2nd round."
Our bench struggled against your bench. Has nothing to do with Embiid and mostly to do with being without our 6th man in Monte Morris. Our bench has no identity without em
"His Argentinian stans are the worst.  When we signed him, they flooded Monte Morris' twitter saying he won't get minutes anymore.  Throughout the season, they ripped Malone and Jokic for not featuring him in the offense."
I think monte morris can be that guy.  he is extremely reliable
Monte Morris is that guard lol
"Just curious Nuggets fans, this your final starting lineup?  Or will Monte Morris start when he's back?"
We need monte Morris back  to lead our bench asap
"This is a nasty team. Bench is also fine tho, jamychal green will barton monte morris facundo campazzo javale mcgee. Definitely winning the west."
1. Jokic 2. Murray 3. MPJ 4. Gordon? 5. Barton 6. Monte Morris 7. PJ Dozier 8. Jamychal Green 9. Facuuu  10. Javale McGee? Idk
Monte Morris  Jamal Murray   Gordon (not drafted)  MPJ  Jokic
"When Monte Morris gets healthy, our starting 5 will likely at least for some games be Monte, Murray, MPJ, Gordon, and Jokic.  That would be 4/5."
"he's a good defender. Nuggets are 15th in defense or exactly average with Jamal Murray, Monte Morris, MPJ, Will Barton, Facu, 36 year old paul millsap and Jamichael Green playing most of the minutes. Jokic is literally the best defeder on the Nuggets other than Gary Harris who has barely played this year."
"It’s hard to be a net negative overall on defense if you’re even serviceable at the 5 though- I mean that’s the hardest defensive position and the Nuggets have a drtg of 111 when Jokic is on the court in the playoffs which is about league average, with a fairly weak defensive supporting cast. Every C has pretty bad perimeter defense, even Gobert gets cooked when he’s drawn out there. If he was a real net negative then there’s no way the Nuggets would still be an average+ defense year to year with him playing so many minutes, when they start Murray, MPJ, and Monte Morris for stretches. I mean, is Jokic really worse overall on D than guys like Curry, Harden, Dame and Westbrook? If he was like Kanter or something there’s no way the Nuggets could be a WCF team."
This guy is going to be good next year after they get Monte Morris
"It depends, but perimeter defense has been a huge problem for the Nuggets the past few years, especially because Gary Harris has been hurt a lot. Every center is going to look worse when they’re starting next to guys like Jamal Murray, Monte Morris and MPJ. If Jokic had someone like Ben Simmons, PG or Kawhi on the court with him his numbers would look a lot better."
"People who blame Jokic for the defense of a team that starts MPJ, Jamal Murray and Monte Morris is bizarre lol"
"Nuggets have an average drtg and Jokic is one of the best players in the entire NBA for generating steals and deflections. Our best two defenders in Gary Harris and Millsap have missed a ton of time- you really think a team starting Jamal murray, MPJ and Monte Morris is gonna have a good defense? Jokic is clearly not the problem there."
"averaging 50/40/80  Monte Morris makes like 9M a year. He's not getting a stupid a contract like Rozier but he'll probably get something between 9-15M a year. Again we're over the cap by 2023 anyways, there's no reason to not extend him."
"Monte Morris, top tier 6th man."
Don’t forget Monte Morris who leads the league or is among the top in assist-to-turnover ratio.
I think green is still out? N our future contending hopes kinda rest on mpj cos its not like we can snag a big FA... Gotta hope he develops. Monte Morris ain't a gd defender either it's pretty rough
"There was a point last year that Denvers bench was Monte Morris, Beasley, Grant, Porter, and Plumlee."
"Donovan Mitchell  Jamal Murray  MPJ  Nikola Jokic  Rudy Golbert   Bench:  Monte Morris, Gary Harris, Melo, Josef Nurkic  Solid."
"G: Monte Morris G: Tyrese Haliburton G/F: THT F: Abdel Nader F: George Niang  Yeah, probably not going to win many too many games, but all solid role players."
"Nuggets: Jokic for sure had it. Speculation that MPJ, Monte Morris, and Will Barton got it."
"Monte Morris, Sabonis, PJ Dozier, Keldon Johnson, Larry Nance, Garry Tent, Josh Hart.   Role players are not sexy"
"Dude... Lakers had 3 top-2 draft picks, and another that was the 7th pick.   Neither the Nuggets or Raptors were bad enough for that long to accumulate those picks.   If anything, the Laker should be applauded for their 2nd round picks, but then again DEN with the Jokic pick already trumps that. Not to mention Monte Morris should be a starter/is a close tot starting player but has told Malone he wants to come off the bench, even when Murray went down."
So huge.   People focus on the Murray injury not realizing how many other significant injuries we’ve had or still have  Aaron Gordon Monte morris Will barton PJ dozier  Even millsap missed a game or two.
"Add Monte Morris and PJ dozier, two key players for us and both could miss a bit or all due to injury."
Monte Morris is listed as questionable today! Finally we might see him again! You can add him. :)
"You might want to look at the Nuggets injuries the second half of the season... it's really only been Jokic and MPJ. 90% of their guards are injured and their basically signing guys off the street to play significant minutes. Will Barton, PJ Dozier, Monte Morris and Jamal Murray have all been gone. Campazzo is literally their third best player now and I'm not even exaggerating. He's even out playing Gordon( who also missed time)"
"The Nuggets also have Michael Porter Jr, Aaron Gordon, Paul Milsap, Will Barton, Monte Morris, Javale McGee, and Jamal Murray (for half of the year).     The Warriors 4th and 5th guys rotate between Mychal Mulder, Juan Toscano Anderson, and Kent Bazemore. Not taking away from Jokic having an incredible year, but when you’re talking about their team records you’ve gotta see that there’s a pretty massive talent difference between the two teams lol."
"LeBron is a forward by position only. He’s really a point guard and the initiator of the offense. And so is DS.  The Lakers don’t have any offense initiators or shot creators right now. Caruso and THT are trying to fill that role but they really don’t have much playmaking ability. They’ve been like secondary or tertiary creators, they’re not primary creators.  That’s why LeBron/DS missing are waaay more major injuries than whatever the Nuggets are facing. Because Jokic can handle all the responsibilities of imitating the offense and creating for others. Meanwhile the Lakers literally have no one on the roster right now that can create for themselves or others.  And you’re being incredibly disingenuous calling Campazzo a useless rookie. He’s 30 years old and legitimately a good role player. He’s like Caruso-lite. Oh, and PJ Dozier played in that LAL game, he wasn’t hurt.  I’m just gonna stop arguin. Will Barton and Monte Morris are not more important than LeBron or DS dude. It’s insane I even have to debate that. The Nuggets actually have players to shoulder the offensive creator role too while the Lakers have no one to fill that role."
Jamal will Barton Monte morris and??  Also we know jokic and campazzo are good ball handlers
"It sucks you guys are missing Mitchell and Conley and we’re missing Murray and Barton, as well as both of their backups Monte Morris and PJ Dozier. At least we have Jokic; I feel like he could run an offense with four people selected from the crowd. And Campazzo is a pretty decent playmaker, even though his lack of shooting and size makes his PnR with Jokic pretty useless.   I like Ingles; he’s smart and savvy. I wouldn’t want to rely on Clarkson’s playmaking but at least he can get a bucket as well as most wings."
"It’s disingenuous to point out the lakers without lebron while only mentioning Murray. Nuggets are down 5 guys. Only guards on their roster that arent out are facu-rookie, Markus Howard-rookie(3 mins per game) shaq Harrison(signed less than a month ago, and Austin rivers ( signed less than a month ago). They might be red hot because jokic is truly that good, but it was anything but a surprise. Using that game as a “it already happened” when we’re going to see Monte Morris, will Barton, and pj dozier come back for the playoffs isn’t fair to the nuggets depth at all"
You are sort of looking at it too narrow though. Not taking into account all the details.   Jokic this year has had the following:  -Gary Harris missing significant time while he was with the team  -A pretty big player turnover  -MPJ missing time due to Covid  -Monte Morris missing significant time with Hamstring injury then reaggravated it and missing probably til playoffs  -Murray coming in tired and battling minor injuries at the begging of the seasons   -Obviously ACL tear for Murray  -Barton Hamstring will miss significant time   And maybe something else Im missing.   Suns have so far been one of the healthiest teams in the league.
Facu is playing great. Monte morris is still a better player.
Hi Anthony thanks for taking time out to do this AMA. First it was Monte Morris and now Facundo Campazzo. Can you tell us what it's like to get absolutely bodied by Nuggets players half your size?
"Oh yeah it’s not like we were without 2 starters and 2 replacement starters or anything. Yeah, Barton and Murray played. I just can’t remember them doing anything. Same with Monte Morris who starts when Murray is hurt. Wonder why he didn’t score any?? And PJ Dozier is who we rely on for defense in the fourth quarter. He was nonexistent on defense in the fourth quarter. Almost like he wasn’t even on the court! Craziness"
Do you think injuries only exist for Lakers? Literally 2 of our starters were out (Murray &amp; Barton) aswell as our 6th man Monte Morris you ignorant Lakers fan
"Nuggets also have players out lol in Monte Morris, Jamal Murray, and Will Barton, I dont think that's a valid excuse."
Monte morris would help a ton. Any news on Barton's Hammy?
"Hell, monte morris wouldve been enough for a blow out"
"It’s not just facu though. Its also PJ dozier getting run with the starters. It’s also Austin rivers and shaq Harrison. And it’s also the millsap/green pairing in the bench getting more comfortable.  It’s a lot of different things.  Go back and watch the handful of games after the Gordon trade before the Murray injury. One of the reasons we were so excited about this teams potential was because *both* ends of the floor were clicking. By moving thrill up to the 2 instead of having him play the 3, suddenly we were oversized with him, mpj, and Gordon on the wings. We were basically switching everything 1-4 and occasionally even switching with Jokic.  The players even talked about how much they loved the free flowing style on defense and how it also translated to the offensive end. This team has always played best when they are loose and having fun and that was a big part of it.  All of that went out the window with Murray’s injury because our replacement options at the time were Monte Morris and facu, who are both too short to do that with. Then Barton goes down. Dozier is long AF (and I would have been down for dozier-Barton after Murray’s injury, but Malone would never do that) and is a great defender for sure, but the switch everything plan is out the window as soon as facu is involved.  But what did happen is our guard depth was so thin that we brought in shaq Harrison and Austin rivers. Those guys have really bought into their roles as defense first guys. Our second unit has been mauling people defensively. We basically transitioned from a high powered dynamic offensive team to the grit n grind grizzlies where we just play at an even more glacial pace through Jokic, clamp down on D, and our second unit lives off of transition buckets from turnovers and whatever scraps we can get in the half court offense from Millsap, random buckets from MPJ when he’s staggered with that unit, or positive shooting variance from 3 from a group of somewhat unreliable 3 point shooters. Millsap and green are both fine catch and shoot 3 point threats, but there’s not really enough rim gravity or shot creation to get them open looks consistently. Both of them are pick and pop threats with no rollers really, so it’s rare for them to get open looks outside of defensive collapses. Javale plays minutes occasionally and he changes that a bit, but offensively the bench is still very limited.  Basically, the team identity has changed entirely and it’s really unfair to put all of that at Murray’s feet. We absolutely still miss him and will especially miss him in the 2 man game/3 man game (with Gordon) on offense. It really unlocked Gordon as a roll threat"
"If Barton and/or Morris come back before the play offs Austin Rivers is hopefully out of the rotation or at least on very low minutes. We will have Facu, PJ, Shaq, Monte and/or Barton which is good enough rotation. Edit: If Austin starts hitting shots I'm ok with him, that's the main problem with him now, he is been a plus overall."
"Lmao dumb ass, what about removing Jamal Murray(you know the one who made the clippers his bitches) will Barton and monte Morris. That's our top 3 guards fool and we won. We won with fully fit teams in the bubble(sans Barton) and we beat them with injuries to important players in our rotation. And u just assume almost everyone will take clippers lol. Like I said, delusional."
"What? MPJ missed a third of the season. Murray was never healthy and missed time all year. Their second best guard behind Jamal is Barton who has been injured most of the year and is out right now. 3rd best guard is Monte Morris who has missed a lot of time and is currently out. 4th best guard is Facu who missed a lot of time earlier in the year. 5th beat guard is PJ Dozier who missed a lot of time. Our two top bench guards at the moment were signed off of the street after the deadline. Gary Harris barely saw the court for us this year before they traded him for a  loss (Hampton was to get Gordon and the 1st to take Garys contract as part of it). Paul Millsap missed a few weeks. Jamychal Green missed a few weeks sparsed out and has played through injuries.   The only rotation players the Denver Nuggets have who haven't missed significant time this year are Nikola Jokic, Aaron Gordon (who they traded an injured starter for), and two guys signed midseason as reactions to both a starter and his backup going down at the same time.   And just to throw the math out there:  Players lost to injury this year so far:  Clippers - 10 players missing 148 games between them  Nuggets - 14 players missing 164 games between them."
Malik Monk  Monte Morris  Marcus Morris  Markieff Morris  Mike Muscala
"We're down Jamal Murray, Will Barton, and Monte Morris. Who do you expect him to play? Also Shaq has been really good and we've won like 4 games in a row with guards we signed a week ago."
Monte Morris was a second rounder as well
"This is coming from someone very critical of westbrook like you, but if getting uncontested rebounds and run down the floor seem easy then why aren’t other teams run it and why don’t other players do so? Westbrook has a unique style of play and even though i don’t rank him top ten or top 15 for some* of the reasons you just mentioned, I have found to appreciate his game and the nuance behind his inconsistent yet game changing play. His stats are all over the place. I also think saying “please watch the game” is an honest point. One two three stats don’t tell the whole story. Westbrook commits a lot of TOs but it’s fine if pace is high and his crazy passing leads to a more varied and dynamic offense. Take monte morris for example. He’s a perfect example of a mini chris paul where he doesn’t commit Tos at all but his playmaking is limited to his “safe” play. Chris paul is a point god and manipulates the offense (kudos to him) but just checking stats for his ast percentage doesn’t make you see how he hogs the ball and dominates the ball for 20 seconds then passes it till the last second so its either a miss or an assist. I’m one to cite compounded statistical data but there really are some players that are better to watch and appreciate live/video. Quick question. Do you play basketball?"
"He has started every game since Monte Morris went down.  supreme facilitator, excellent defense; his 3pt shot is slowly getting better as he adjusts to the NBA 3pt line depth compared to Euroleague."
Murray and Monte Morris channeled their energies into MPJ like a spirit bomb.
They’re all one-way defensive specialists except for Monte Morris
"Monte Morris, Jalen Brunson, Tyus Jones or De'Anthony Melton  George Hill still has a good case even at his age."
Monte Morris
Monte Morris if Jamal Murray is healthy.
smh where is monte morris
And Monte Morris who is extremely important. Aka nearly our entire primary backcourt rotation when healthy. Two guys we just signed as free agents played 20 mins lol
Second best players then were Jamal Murray and Jeremi Grant and they are both gone now. Even Will Barton and Monte Morris are down with injuries.
"What else can they do? They have no facilitators, Monte morris, Barton and jamal murray are out"
"There's no guarantee of that. The Nuggets starting lineup with Murray in place of Facu or Monte Morris was absolutely *crushing* teams on both ends. Literally DOMINANT offensively and really, really good defensively. They had as good a chance as any team."
DW we are missing 35 mpg jamal murray and his back up monte morris who plays 26 mpg.
"Have you forgotten about Wiggins? Steph, Dray, Wiggins, Oubre, then Baze. That top 3 is honestly pretty solid, and Oubre has had some awesome games this year. He's a fine role player.   Assuming MPJ is the second best, who is the Nuggets 3rd best player right now? Aaron Gordon who is a very solid player, similar to Wiggins, maybe? After that though? It's a pretty fucking steep drop off. Like, Will Barton is good but not any better or worse than Oubre or Bazemore. They just bring different skills. He's a worse defender but he can handle the ball and pass a bit. Monte Morris is good, but again, just a role player like those dudes. The rosters are not as different as you make out without Jamal Murray."
"&gt;You've seen him in his prime  lol, literally talking about Faccu this year alone, he was starting for Real Madrid before coming to you guys mid season.   &gt;against way lesser competition  In a league were everything from scoring to passing is harder to do than the NBA.  &gt;Monte Morris is absolutely the better player right now.  I disagree"
"You've seen him in his prime against way lesser competition in his prime years, yeah. Monte Morris is absolutely the better player right now."
"They already have Monte Morris, who is better all around, and good enough to start in NBA. Facu is 3rd string PG, but is a vet and wiley"
"Let's put it this way:  |Position|2017|2018| |:-|:-|:-| |PGs|De'Aaron Fox, Lonzo,  Dennis Smith Jr., Monte Morris|Luka, Trae Young,  Colin Sexton, Jalen Brunson| |Wings|Tatum, Mitchell, OG Anunoby, Kuzma, Hart, Dillon Brooks, Kennard|SGA, MPJ, Bridges (both), DiVincenzo, Kevin Huerter| |Bigs|Bam, Jarrett Allen, John Collins, Bryant, Markkanen|JJJ, Ayton, Wendell Carter Jr., Bagley, Robinson|  Looks pretty even to me. 2018 has way better PGs. 2017 has way better wings. Bigs are pretty even, though I lean toward 2018- didn't even include Robert Williams on that list."
Monte Morris should be out about the same amount of time so it’s a stop-gap for now
"Almost like there’s a lot of variance in a covid season (with a shortened offseason to boot) and that a small sample size at the beginning of the year is probably not indicative of what the end result of the season would be.  Look at the final 4 teams from last year who had the shortest turnaround for an NBA season ever:  -	Lakers: AD and Lebron both miss extended time -	nuggets: plagued by injuries all year, most notably with Murray and Monte Morris both having separate instances of injuries causing missed time or nagging injuries -	heat and Celtics: I don’t even know if I can list off all the shit these two have been through. They have basically been a MASH unit all year long   Meanwhile the top 2 teams in the west are the ones who have been basically healthy all year. Clippers to an extent as well. Sixers and nets in the East have obviously had their injuries, but the East is a bit more forgiving in that regard."
"Monte Morris is also extremely important for Denver, especially without Murray"
"Monte Morris is also absolutely crucial for us, but no JV was huge"
"Jamal Murray (24)  Monte Morris (25)  MPJ (22)  Aaron Gordon (25)  Jokic (26)  Am I missing something? Would you mind explaining to me your logic on how we're 18th and the Spurs, Cavs, and Knicks are higher than us?"
Monte Morris
"I agree, with Murray we had a good chance to make the finals, without him we're still a dark horse for it. Lakers are limping into the playoffs, Utah is down their best playoff player. Clippers and Suns are gonna be tough though, and Blazers and Mavs are both gnarly dark horses themselves.   Somebody is gonna need to step up for it though, Tall Klay has been making great strides, but it's gonna have to be a third person as well as the bench stepping way up for it to happen.  Aaron Gordon? Monte Morris? THE THRILL HIMSELF?? Time will tell."
"I'd compare Brunson to Monte Morris on Denver, who's on a 3yr 27mil. I think Brunson could probably get a bit more, but I'd be surprised to see more than 11mil/yr."
Super glad the nuggets locked up Monte Morris for a couple years.  Gonna be interesting to see what Brunson gets when he hits free agency in comparison
"There are a few guys I've always wondered what their stats would look like with really high usage. Guys with pretty good per-100 stats and (some of them) pretty good advanced stats, but just never high enough usage.   * Dejounte Murray, Devonte' Graham, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Delon Wright, Monte Morris, DeAnthony Melton, Patty Mills, Malik Monk, Shake Milton  I think Murray, Graham, and Bogdanovic could easily put up All-Star stats under the right circumstances. The others I'm not too sure about but I've always been really curious what would happen if you gave them more opportunities.  I think Goran Dragic is an example of one of those guys who always had really impressive stats in low minutes for the first few years of his career, then found himself in a situation with more minutes/opportunity and really thrived. Same with Fred VanVleet."
Also Monte Morris is a decent fill-in
"Monte Morris and Barton. Bench unit Rivers, Dozier and Facu."
"You put Cade in the best position to succeed. Make Garland and Sexton both available and trade the one you get the best offer for. See if there's a way you can get a young big (go hard after John Collins) and depth that has played in a structured system (try to get guys like Georges Niang, Jarrell Brantley, Furkan Korkmaz, Monte Morris, Semi Ojeleye). Prey on teams that might be looking to shed salary around the margins to go after FAs or cut their luxury tax bills.   In short, go all-in on Cade and surround him with players that aren't going to be the problem. Also, you need a new coach, someone like Charles Lee. Hire him."
I assume Monte Morris like others are saying
Monte Morris hopefully
We don't really need a traditional pg like that. I'd much rather have Monte Morris start and have Facu run the second unit. We do need a shot creator in the team though.
"We also have one of the best backup PGs in the NBA with Monte Morris. But the chemistry between Murray and Jokic can’t be understated, they have spent their entire careers together and built it up over 5 years. Which is why this is so gutwrenching for Nuggets fans."
Lol not even Wiggins  They win this game if they play Austin Rivers or Monte Morris over Simmons
"Ayton, Trae young, monte Morris,"
CJ made Monte Morris look like Steve Nash.
"He played two dominant backcourts with the worst point of attack perimeter defenders in the league. Pretty well established that no NBA center is doing shit 1v2 against Paul and booker or against dame in space. Watch some highlights of our guards getting vaporized by every screen against Phoenix for example, and not helping in the corners. Embiid would get carved up too there, and conversely Jokic would look a hell of a lot better with Tisse and Simmons navigating screens instead of Austin Rivers and Monte Morris"
Whats he gonna do lmao if its not him its Monte Morris or Will Barton  When Murray was there he played off ball cause Murray iso
Monte Morris was a killer as well.
"we'd get swept, dame dropped 55 and we still lost to the garbage nugs. we also let austin rivers and monte morris look like superstars...imagine what cp3 and book would do"
"Will Barton, Monte Morris, Michael Porter Jr, and the GOAT himself JAVALE MCGEE! That’s not a G League roster my friend."

"wasn't your coaching mike. thank terrible terry, our dogwater d, and austin rivers + monte morris going nuclear (before reverting to absolute dogshit vs the suns)"
"Monte Morris, the third Morris brother"
"Monte Morris was good as fuck this playoffs. He was terrible game 1 and 2 against the Suns I know, but for a backup PG he really stepped out outside of that  Scored 20+ 3 times this playoffs after doing so just twice all season. And he had 19 in another game."
Monte Morris can’t win with these cats.
Not having Murray and Barton in the starting lineup killed our spacing which severely limited Aaron Gordon's ability to impact the game offensively and allowed the Suns to key in on stopping MPJ from getting open.   Monte Morris had a rough game 1 and should've started the entire series. And non-Nuggets fans forget we were without PJ Dozier who is our best guard defender and one of the few bench guys who can get his own shot.   I disagree with the sentiment that other players weren't playing hard. We were just a banged up team going up against a fully healthy squad playing their best basketball of the season.
Bad defense or no Aaron Gordon and Austin Rivers will never have another series or even stretch of games like that. Monte Morris too but he’s decent.  I literally don’t think Aaron Gordon could shoot better in practice wide open than he did in the series.
"MPJ sold this game for the Nuggets, they got stops but he was nonfactor. How are you getting carried by Monte fucking Morris"
Monte Morris literally too gassed to run anymore
I love watching monte morris brick every shot 😃
"Monte Morris: “Look at me, I am the captain now”"
"If it's not ejection, I'd like to see Ayton fuck Monte Morris in the ass right here right now. Just a flagrant dude."
"Hey we may be getting swept but I’m proud of the teams effort, especially proud of Monte Morris he’s hella underrated"
Monte Morris is the MVP of the Nuggets so far this game.
why isn’t Monte Morris in. Man was dominating
Been telling everybody Monte Morris is the real MVP 😤
"Lmao if y'all are seriously arguing Khris Middleton is better than Nikola Jokic that's wild. I usually ignore those kind of takes but this is too funny. Just to clarify:  So the Bucks probably get swept if James Harden is playing. Y'all were a shot away from being down 3-0. Now Kyrie goes down and the Bucks have the luxury of playing a team whose 2/3 stars are out. Plus Khris plays next to Giannis, one of the best players on Earth to take defensive gravity off of Khris.   Meanwhile we all know how much of a playoff beast Jamal Murray is. So the Nuggets are clearly missing their second best player and it's blatant when you watch their offense right now. Their second best player has basically been Monte Morris.   And your best data/argument for Middleton over Jokic completely ignores the MAJOR injury scenarios present. That's some impressive critical thinking skills ya got there."
Honestly though. Every time I tune in he’s hitting clutch 3s. I’d take monte Morris though
Monte Morris looks nice as hell every time I watch the Nuggets
I really like Monte Morris  Jackson is currently playing the best right now though
"They already have some guys man. It's not like Gordon and Barton would disappear.   Green, dozier, Millsap, monte Morris, etc. All still on the roster."
"At the top end, teams will be eyeing Lowry, Conley or CP3 however likely or unlikely. That's where the YOLO money will be going. I'll be shocked if Schroder gets more than 15M AAV unless it's from the Lakers. Pelinka might sympathize agent to agent if he's lucky. I respect Monte Morris securing generationaloney but he'd clean up if he was an FA, just as an aside."
Denver would be giving up way to much.  I’ll give you Murray and Monte Morris.  Portland should explore this trade idea.
"Nope that honor goes to ""The Count of Mont Assist/To"" Monte Morris"
"I mean, when you're talking about the group of important role players that disappeared, you're not gonna talk about the only ones who didn't.  Jokic had like 8 teammates who should have given some help, and the only decent ones were Barton, 2nd game back from injury and shooting inefficiently, and Monte Morris, significantly outplaying his role and contract."
"And y’all had Aaron Gordon, Austin Rivers, and Monte Morris play some of their best games of the season. Aaron Gordon shooting 60% from 3 for the series will never happen in another stretch of 6 games in his career."
"&gt;if ANY team lost their entire front court yeah it wouldn’t be good  But it's fine if a team loses nearly their entire backcourt? The matchup is the problem- you'd be getting smacked if you had Frank instead of Ayton on Jokic, which is why he isn't playing this series.   We're down Murray and Dozier, plus Barton was out in game 1 and on a heavy minutes restriction in games 2 and 3, and hasn't played since April. He was just -2 in game 2 and +2 tonight btw, so there's evidence this would be a wildly different series if we had him and PJ at 100%, not even including Murray.  You know why there isn't chemistry? Because 3/4 of the guards who have experience playing with Jokic are out or severely limited. We had 7 guards to start the season (Murray/Barton/Harris/Morris/Dozier/Hampton/Facu). That's too many, so we traded Harris and Hampton for Gordon, who works in space. Then Murray, Barton and Dozier all went down (and Monte for a while too), so we were left with just Monte and Facu, then signed Rivers and Shaq off their couches. No team can plan to lose 3/4 of their top guards, and teams have depth in different places. We swapped guard depth for forward depth, and then all our guards went down. Can't really plan for that! If we lost a guard and one of Millsap/Green instead of Dozier, it would be much easier to handle. Those limitations exist for all teams.   You guys have more backcourt depth than frontcourt depth, hence comparing the situation to you losing 3/4 of your top frontcourt players at once, and having your 2nd best remaining player get injured. A suns team of CP3-Payne-injured Bridges-Saric-and minutes restriction Ayton would be getting hammered by a fully healthy Nuggets team lol, no teams are build to withstand season ending injuries to their #2 player. That's just ridiculous and it's clear you haven't been self aware about your extreme injury luck this year if that's your take. We thought it couldn't get worse after the Murray injury and then what a surprise, we lost our #2 and #4 options to fill that role! Having 0 remaining shot creators is a problem for any team, and it's just bad luck."
it kinda helps that Suns can put 99% focus on him without having to worry much (at all?) about the other 4 guys on the floor not named Monte Morris.
I’m being obtuse? The guys you listed are all thoroughly outplaying the guys i referenced. MPJ is in the same role as Seth Curry because he can’t create anything for himself and relies purely on outside shooting. Tobias is a solid three level scorer and a  fringe all star and you’re comparing him to jamychal green and monte Morris who are both bench players. The start of this argument is you saying Embiid has had a better fg% and then saying he has no offensive help. Regular season has no bearing on how a player performs in the postseason. This postseason Embiid has had objectively better teammates and has faced markedly worse teams than Jokic has. So address the argument or just admit you’re a moron who hasn’t watched a nuggets game
Is monte Morris always been this legit? He’s making everything
Monte Morris stepping up
"Starting 5 is Murray/Barton/AG/MPJ/Jokic with Monte Morris, PJ Dozier, and JaMychal Green subbing in and out on a fully healthy roster. Facu averaged 9 minutes a game before Jamal went down and Rivers wasn’t on the team"
"Like the guys he named?  Those guys were hitting against us lol.   Hell Monte Morris' last 3 games from 3 against us were 2/4, 4/9, 3/6"
"Rivers is a competent NBA guard.  Millsap, Green and Monte Morris are infinitely better than anything we have off the bench"
"Ayton has been great, but it has been a lot of team defense too. Easier to clog the lane and send doubles when you're leaving Facu and Monte Morris unguarded as opposed to leaving Jamal Murray."
He had a big hand in Monte Morris and Austin Rivers have no effect at all too
"Seriously, your Suns exposed this so bad.  Gordon is a great piece, but only when he can be the 3rd/4th option with MPJ behind Jokic/Murray.  Monte Morris is the perfect backup, Facu is a great guy to bring some energy when you need it, and Rivers is well, Austin Rivers.  Just a lot of guys having to step up and take over roles that they aren't equipped to handle."
"Suns are really really good, not sure we win this series even with Jamal.  But we really need another shot creator against their defense.  Jokic is an absolute beast, but when he is the only legit threat it is too easy to prevent him from taking over the game entirely.    If Monte Morris can start hitting his shots he can be a budget Jamal, and I am sure we will win a game off that exact thing, but the series seems pretty doomed."
"monte morris is back to 2nd ranked morris below marcus, but above markieff"
Made Monte Morris look like Steve Nash
"Monte Morris... 2-16 in the series... bruh, after what he did to Portland they're getting nothing from him"
eh Dame feasted 34 points on 67% TS... Cj on the other hand got outplayed by Monte Morris
Also Dozier.   Also Monte Morris and Will Barton not playing through injuries and with restrictions  Also MPJ to hit a shot
It’s like monte Morris forgot how to play basketball. Completely different player than the blazers game 6
Monte Morris 1/14
is monte morris trying to make the worst possible decision every chance he can get
"Gordon expires after next year. We’re losing Monte Morris, McGee, Millsap and Austin Rivers this year. Will Barton and JaMychal Green have player options but Barton would be dumb to walk away"
Monte Morris kinda looks like a mini LeBron
Cam Payne literally just impregnated Monte Morris
Why does Campu start over Monte Morris?  Morris always looks so much better whenever I watch the Nugs
"John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunoby, Jonathan Isaac, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Derrick White, and if you're feeling generous, Markkanen, Kuzma, Zach Collins, Luke Kennard, and Malik Monk. Oh and Dillon Brooks and Monte Morris in the 2nd round."
"Tbf I think Mpj was where he got really really lucky lol.  I commend him for Monte Morris, Jamal, AG trade, JG trade, Convincing Millsap, Facu, rivers and ofc Jokic  However 2017 draft day trade..."
Murray when he’s not injured and Monte Morris so far in these playoffs.   You very clearly think it’s done by height.  If not then there is no reason to think of LeBron as anything other than a PG.
"I’ll go contract-by-contract and defend them:  * Brogdon: I can see taking Bogi, they’re about equal in contract and ability. But Brogdon can match Bogi’s scoring and defense while also being a better passer. * Turner is a DPOY caliber player and one of the league’s best shot blockers, he single-handedly carried the Pacers defense this year. Definitely taking him over Bogi. * Capela is also a phenomenal defender, but he’s also one of the league’s top rebounders and a menace in the PNR. For me, he’s easily a top ten C in the league, and this isn’t even close. * Rose is a 6MOTY caliber guy who massively helped the Knicks go on their run to the four seed. If he and Bogi were on the same contracts, I’d take Bogi, but $7m a year for what Rose has done is phenomenal. Rose could easily get a $15m-$20m contract in the open market IMO. * Noel should be All-Defense first team. He’s a really, really good defender. For $5m a year (barely more than the VetMin), that’s hard to beat. * I could see taking Bogi over Monte Morris because of the talent gap, but $9m a year is just so cheap for a starting-level PG. I could see this one coming down to team need. * O’Neal is one of the league’s best 3 and D guys and a key role player for the Jazz. I could see him being worth Joe Harris money and getting a contract in the $16m-$18m a year range. * Kleber is a good defender, but I can see taking Bogi over him.  * DFS’s shot seems to come and go, but he’s a solid defender, decent rebounder, and $4m a year is a pittance. * Ibaka is a solid all-around, decent shooter, good defender, and has slightly improved every year he’s been in the league. He was on $16m a year with the Raptors and reportedly turned down an extension in that range to go contend in LA.  For me personally, Bogi’s $18m a year is about what he’s worth. His scoring hasn’t been proven consistent, though he’s been on fire of late- earlier in the season, people were bashing his contract as being on an overpay. If he can keep up this kind of scoring, then he’s worth more, but, if you look at the contracts of, Terry Rozier, TJ Warren, Caris Levert, or Terrence Ross, I think $18m a year is about right for a good-shooting/streaky scoring second guy."
"* Zach Lavine $19m a year. * Lu Dort $1.4m a year. * Brogdon $20m a year. * Myles Turner $17m a year. * Sabonis $19m a year. * Capela $18m a year. * DRose $7m a year. * Nerlens Noel $5m a year. * Monte Morris $9m a year. * Royce O’Neal $8.5m a year. * Maxi Kleber $8m a year. * Dorian Finney-Smith $4m a year. * Serge Ibaka $9m a year.  Bogdan is a better player than some of these guys, but that doesn’t mean his contract is a better value."
Monte Morris 3 years 27 million total
"Absolutely!  I'm not at all arguing that Trez sucks by any means, but him being a ""niche player"" is very accurate, and that niche absolutely will suffer in the playoffs.  Trez is *great* as a regular season player, because he's an iron man player who can be highly efficient against bench rotations.  When rotations cut down, game plans become more pointed at finding the weakest link, and targeting players becomes the name of the game, he'll suffer--on both ends.    The gameplan against Trez is pretty simple: put a singular big dude in the paint to alter his shots and then absolutely hunt him on defense by forcing switches or relentlessly attacking the paint.  Both of those are possible from bench players on *most* playoff teams.  Against Dallas, Carlisle parked Boban in the paint (who destroyed Trez on both sides) and also had Trey Burke/Seth Curry switch and iso onto him.  Against Denver, Malone packed the paint with Plumlee and had guards like Monte Morris switch onto him or Jokic simply take him to the perimeter OR the post.  The Suns would have absolutely done the same shit, but admittedly, Vogel could have tried to use him a bit more due to the lack of big depth the Suns have to defend Harrell.  The issue is more on the defensive end where they have Booker/Cp3/Payne who could easily blow by him or just launch shots on him.  He's useful, but when you really look at the potential playoff matchups, he'll have a hard time.  Frankly, the best matchup he possibly could have had this year was against the Clippers, but even that changed once they got Boogie."
Monte Morris...rip
Monte Morris robbed
Monte morris sure is a steal huh
Monte Morris 1-10... Portland Blazers defense is such a step down from Suns defense. I don't think Nuggets have enough without Murray in this matchup.
Monte Morris finishing with a +/- of -28. Ouch
Monte morris....
Monte Morris doing his best Will Barton impression tonight
I just wanna know who the fuck told Monte Morris to take 10 shots at this point in the game
Monte Morris just wasting minutes lmaooo I’m sick
Monte Morris' powers wane when not facing the Trailblazers
Monte Morris must have been reading all his press
Monte “does not have it all” Morris lol
My mom can hit shots better than Monte Morris what a clown 🤡
Monte Morris played but who else can run PG?
Nuggets will need Monte Morris to do a whole lot better than 1-6 in the 2nd half to win this thing
"Nuggets have been missing Murray, Barton, and Dozier for over a month. Their guard depth is laughably thin: two rookies (Facu Campazzo and Markus Howard) and two free agents at the time of the injuries (Austin Rivers and Shaq Harrison) are what they have with backup PG Monte Morris for their entire backcourt"
"Cam Payne is getting paid, Monte Morris money sounds about right"
Monte Morris the best backup pg in the league
"with Jokic as your superstar, Monte Morris gives you 80% of Murray's production at a much cheaper price"
And he signaled Monte Morris to speed up with advancing the ball out of the backcourt to avoid the 8 second violation. He is playing chess on a baskeball court...
"Monte Morris to me is the budget version of them, without the defense. Does everything u want on offense at a decent level, steady, reliable."
I’d say Monte Morris would go at #14
Recently I would say monte Morris over Gordon
"i think i see it, this man might actually be a monster   who's guarding Green? Damian lillard, instead of RoCo   i remember the clippers play he told Monte Morris to go on the baseline, cause a small was on him as well"
"Problem with the Portland statement is that the team they just lost to is in the same boat. Nobody teams up to play in Denver but alas here they are.     Jamal Murray (pick 7), Nikola Jokic (pick 41), Michael Porter Jr (pick 14), Monte Morris (pick 51), Capazzo (signed overseas),   Do better Portland"
"Monte Morris? Not as good as a lot of guys mentioned and he's been getting some good recognition since last round, but still a very under-rated player IMO"
"Bogdan Bogdanovic, Monte Morris..."
Monte Morris.
Monte Morris.
Right. But Simmons can make plays for others. And Monte Morris can score and create…decently. But the main point which I failed to address is a secondary hall handler. They all have that. Luka doesn’t.
Embiid has Simmons who isn't really a shot creator and jokic has Monte Morris rn.
Ben Simmons wants to be Monte Morris so badly
"I'm not saying they dominate the game for them, but they have solid contributions from them. MPJ is averaging 19/7/2/1/ on 54/42/91. That's more than solid. You even have guys like Austin Rivers, Monte Morris, that Campezzo dude and Aaron Gordon putting in work.  Edit:  I'm not trying to discredit Jokic and/or Tatum. They're both fantastic players, if it came across as such, I'm sorry."
"I feel like with a healthy Barton, the rotation depends on the situation at hand.  If they need guard defense, (which they will for this series. CP3 and Booker is a stronger duo than Dame and CJ), then they go with Facundo Campazzo and Will Barton. If they need guard offense, then they'll go with Monte Morris and Austin Rivers."
Monte Morris have it all
"Dillon Brooks, Cameron Johnson, Monte Morris"
"Offense: G Jamal Murray, G Monte Morris, F Will Barton, F MPJ, C Nikola Jokic  Defense: G PJ Dozier, G Shaq Harrison, F Aaron Gordon, F Paul Millsap, C Javale???"
"Do we know for a fact that they want to keep Ingram? I don't think he meshed that well with Zion.   And even if they do roll with that combo, Lonzo is not worth that asking price. Players like Monte Morris fit that mold just as well and don't cost 25M per year. Lonzo is not even a real PG"
"Would Portland be interested in trading Dame to Denver for MPJ, Bol Bol, Will Barton, Monte Morris and a couple 1st rounders? Dame and Jokic?!?!? Watch out. Then Jamal Murray comes back from injury and the Nuggets are looking scary."
1.  Nikola Jokic 2.  Jamal Murray 3.  Michael Porter Jr. 4.  Monte Morris 5.  RJ Hampton :/
Probly shouldn’t have let Monte Morris become Nigerian
G Monte Morris  G Victor Oladipo   F Giannis   F Bam   C Ayton
Monte Morris / Victor Oladipo / OG Anunoby / Giannis / Ayton would be filthy. Bam sixth man could do serious damage too.   Only position that's below average is PG
Monte Morris/Iggy/Oladipo is a pretty good guard rotation
Monte morris opted out too. Couldve used him this year
"I think it’s sad that, really and truly, the Nigerian team wasn’t at their best either. They were missing Monte Morris and OG Anunoby. I don’t know why Jahlil didn’t play. He isn’t that bad, right? Literally every active player for Nigeria beside him played good minutes."
"You’re right but Nigeria also isn’t considered a real contender even though they beat us. They have real NBA talent on that roster, they’re not even full strength monte Morris pulled out. But in the future I can almost guarantee they’ll have some continuity."
Monte Morris?
I kinda like the Murray one because it gives you next year to suck and tank while he rehabs.  Should be more like Murray + Monte Morris + four 1st round picks though
"It's crazy because at times Middleton looks like Durant-lite with his in-your-face threes, turnaround fades, and iso play that can carry the team for a quarter or so...and other times he looks like a bench player who you're begging to stop shooting. It's got to be so frustrating to not know what you're getting game to game.  Jrue has been really good with Giannis in the PnR and is a disruptive defender, but he's never been a reliable scorer. They just need a Monte Morris/Satoranksy type playmaker and one more Danny Green/Reggie Bullock/Duncan Robinson shooter to kick out to, but idk if they can get it the next season or two."
LeBron James / Monte Morris  Patty Mills / Gary Trent Jr.
I almost went Lebron James/ Monte Morris
"Has he? Guys are shooting about 1.5% worse against him than their averages this playoffs which is the same impact had by Clarkson and worse than guys like Pat Connaughton, Huerter, Powell, Dame, Kaminsky, Rivers, Mann, Payne, Beal, THT, George Hill, Lou Williams, Duncan Robinson, and Korkmaz.  He has a -0.6 dbpm. It’s the worst on the Suns besides for Galloway and Jevon Carter. The only guys besides those 3 who don’t have a positive dbpm are Torrey Craig and Abdel Nader. Of the 91 guys who played enough to qualify for the leaderboard, he’s 66th. He’s tied with Bryn Forbes. Some guys in the negative who are still above him include Trae, Mitchell and Shamet. Dame and Mann are at 0. Some guys with positive ones include Monte Morris, Reggie Jackson, Lou Williams, Huerter, Doncic, Batum, Campazzo, Seth Curry, and Schroeder. He also has fewer defensive win shares per 48 than guys like Duncan Robinson, Cam Payne, CP3, Saric, Kuzma, Shake, Korkmaz, Quickley, George Hill, and Drummond."
"Unless you can prove otherwise (and I hope you do!), there's zero indication Monte Morris is actually on team Nigeria right now."
"Nigeria is ranked way too high. Australia and France are definitely better. Not only is the NBA talent on Australia and France better but their players also haven’t played much with each other.   I think you are overestimating exactly which NBA players are projected to be on the Nigerian team. The best player might end up being Monte Morris and the rest of the team will be some combination of guys like Precious Achiuwa, Jahlil Okafor, and Josh Okogie."
They barely beat the 2017 team in 7.  1. PG - De’Aaron Fox vs. Trae Young 2. SG - Donovan Mitchell vs. Shai Gilgeous Alexander 3. SF - Jayson Tatum vs.  Luka Doncic 4. PF - John Collins vs. Michael Porter Jr 5. C - Bam Adebayo vs De’Andre Ayton 6.  Lonzo Ball vs Devonte Graham 7. Markelle Fultz vs. Collin Sexton 8. O.G. Anunoby vs. Mikal Bridges 9. Jonathan Issac vs Jaren Jackson Jr 10. Jarrett Allen vs Mitchell Robinson 11. Monte Morris vs. Jalen Brunson 12. Derrick White vs Kevin Huerter or Donte DiVincenzo 13. Josh Hart or Kyle Kuzma vs Miles Bridges 14. Lauri Markannen vs Robert Williams 15. Thomas Bryant vs Wendell Carter Jr
He got outplayed by Monte Morris in the elimination game LMAO. Dame's game doesn't impact winning because he is a ball hog.
"I mean, yeah. We undeperformed this playoffs pretty handily, and CJ was the biggest guy on both ends. Got lit up by Austin rivers and monte Morris every game + was awful on the other end  Dame + Simmons is the perfect PnR pairing to beat traps.   Plus we get a massive defensive boost"
Monte Morris is a homeless man's cp3
"Bro you want the victim complex so bad even when your team is winning. Again, I’m not hating, I’m objectively describing the situation.  Your points are grasping as straws. This was not a difficult path, you can’t turn it into one. That’s ok! It’s worth it to be there, easily.   * You beat a Denver team starting two guards who wouldn’t even be in the normal playoff rotation. Teams in that condition virtually never make the second round, MVP or not. Losing 3/4 of your rotation guards and #2 is not really possible to overcome in the modern NBA, once you get past the first round of the playoffs.    * You cannot seriously be acting like geriatric Rondo, Cousins and Morris are the types of players to carry a team through the WCF in 2021. Come on.   * Yes, typically when teams lose 3 starters, including their best player, they have “no chance” against an essentially full strength, late round team.    Their regular season record is largely a function of extreme injury luck (in both directions) as well. Compre them to Denver for example, who would have been the 2 seed if health was equal (and likely if offseason length was equal):  No top 4 Sun missed &gt;5 games. Crowder missed 12.  Murray missed 24, Barton 16, MPJ 11, Gary/Gordon ~28, Monte 18, Dozier 25, Millsap 16, Green 14.  That’s worth more than 4 games &amp; Denver had the tiebreaker.   Again, enjoy it! But you can’t twist the facts here- those were pretty weak attempts at doing it."
"&gt;Westbrook had a quad issue that didn’t allow him to drive and was clearly off from covid.  Yeah him underperforming year and year is obviously because of COVID.  Give me a break lmao. Westbrook looked 100% health-wise. He was just flat out playing like shit. Couldn’t hit a jump shot to save his life.  &gt;When did I compare them? By this subs logic. If the heat took the fully healthy lakers to 6 without a healthy Bam and their LEADING scorer, surely they would have won if everyone was healthy  Is this a rhetorical question?  &gt;I also love how you threw in will Barton, monte Morris, Marcus Morris, and ibaka lmfao   I threw in those guys because it caused Denver to have to start Facu Campazzo and Austin Rivers. Probably should have listed PJ Dozier as well."

"&gt; 2020 Lakers: Dame, Westbrook, Bam and Dragic (they still got taken to 6)  Lmao Dame was injured when the series was already over. Westbrook just shot like shit, that has nothing to do with COVID.  Nice try comparing Bam and Dragic to Kawhi, LeBron, AD, Murray, Barton, Monte and Marcus Morris, and Ibaka btw"
I mean they were starting Austin Rivers and Monte Morris instead of their best wing defender and a guy who averaged 26.5/6.6 on 50/45/90 shooting last playoffs
Monte Morris is a candidate
You mean CP3 played better against Austin rivers Monte Morris and Facu? You don’t say?
"That’s what happens when you go from having Austin Rivers, Campazzo and Monte Morris guarding you to Reggie Jackson, Pat Bev (mostly been on Book), and Terrence Mann. And a week off of playing basketball, and COVID   Cp3 and Book play into the Clippers hands. They want you to shoot jumpshot cause they’re betting that their defense will contest the look as good as possible. They want to stop people from getting to the rim.   And for that reason, I think Monty is heavily under using Cam Payne. He’s too slippery to guard well."
MPJ &amp; monte Morris for Beal is coming. Heard it here first
"Monte Morris, Christian Wood, Jeff Green, Blake Griffin (stupid), Reggie Jackson."
Monte Morris could be a starting guard for a playoff team like the Knicks/clippers/Lakers but is happy coming off the bench for just 3/29 lmao
Lol! We’ll give you Michael Porter Jr but we just absolutely can’t give up Monte Morris
You have almost all your picks and a good young player in MPJ. You also have Aaron Gordon/Jamychal Green/Will Barton (if he opts in) to match salaries and Monte Morris on a team friendly contract.   Although I would probably move Murray instead of MPJ because Lillard and Murray will be essentially playing the same role.
"lakers get robbed  not trading Kuzma AND a pick for some guy who got beat by the trio of Monte Morris, Austin Rivers, and Facundo Campazzo."
Honestly thought Monte Morris played a lot like Chris Paul in college. He’s adjusted his game quite a bit playing next to Jokic and isn’t close to as good but he’s the first guy I think of
The Nigerian team could be great if they all played for Nigeria  Giannis Bam OG Anunoby Monte Morris Semi ojeleye  Masai and the giant of Africa really going to increase the amount of African talent coming into the NBA.
I wish he would take one second like Monte Morris
Monte Morris will be playing for Team Nigeria in Tokyo (2nd gen)  So excited.
What elite pnr guard has he faced? Monte Morris or facu lol
Monte Morris is huge for them.
I think Monte Morris was still on a minutes limit too. So that's their top 4 guards all injured.
Terrence Mann is what I am/was hoping Monte Morris would turn into.
"Well it’s kind of weird to think about but all of Jokic, Murray, Porter Jr, Monte Morris, and Aaron Gordon are 25 or younger. Plus, they have some other intriguing pieces include Zeke Nnaji, Bol Bol, PJ Dozier, and Markus Howard. They could run a respectable NBA rotation with just their young guys, which makes them all the more dangerous with some veteran signings."
"I don’t think you can call it a lost art. 21.3% of Booker’s points these playoffs are from midrange. Of players with at least 4 games and 15 plus mpg, six guys have a higher percentage of their points from midrange than that, nine last year with a higher percentage than Booker’s now, and eleven the year before.  This year its CP3, KD, Beal, Ish Smith, D’Andre Hunter, and Carmelo in that order.  Last postseason, it was Carmelo, Middleton, Seth, CP3, Markell’s Fultz, Gallinari, Terrence Ross, Trey Burke, and Tyler Johnson.  Luke Kennard, Demar, Monte Morris, Collison, Schroeder, Myles Turner, Ish Smith, Aldridge, KD, Lou, and Klay were the ones in 2019."
"I say AG+Monte Morris+random filler for Simmons+picks would be worth looking in to for both sides. Idk that Denver gives up on AG that quick, but if I’m Philly I’m for sure asking."
"Not accurate. Simmons scored 14 ppg this year. He had a rough time in the playoffs, but so did CJ, who struggled to match the output (or stop) the likes of Austin Rivers and Monte Morris. The Blazers can replace the lost scoring that comes with CJ being traded as long as Simmons improves the D and brings some playmaking, which judging by his assist numbers that should be the case. Both teams have to come to grips with their failed experiments and try something new. Seems like a good swap."
We'll take ben for AG and Monte Morris
PG: Monte Morris/Jalen Brunson  SG: Shake Milton  SF: Matisse Thybulle/Jalen McDaniels  PF: OG Anunoby/George's Niang  C: Pascal Siakam/Reggie Perry  We don't get draft picks
"Did you watch CJ this playoffs? They were both dogshit lol. CJ let Austin Rivers, Facundo Campazzo and Monte Morris go off on him"
Except us. I love me some Monte Morris
"How can you say we don't count because early picks (with 0 top 5 picks, 1 top 10 pick lol) and then cite drafting 3 MVPs who were all taken top 5? And no mention of Jokic round 2, literally the latest MVP ever drafted by 20 picks. Monte Morris(another round 2), Jamal and MPJ. Not even counting Nurkic, Gary Harris, Fournier, Malik Beasley (also round 2) Almost every player the Nuggets have taken for the last half decade has surpassed expectations. I don't see how two two lottery picks (both of which were home runs despite being late lottery picks) negates any of that.  Not saying OKC isn't a great FO but they're not ""easily the best drafting team."""
CJ played great in game 4 and game 1. Simmons has been good in some games. Monte Morris got swept.
anyone else think Monte Morris and Lebron look like cousins?
Monte Morris has very good shooting performances and very bad shooting performances
"Simmons, Mccollum then Monte Morris. Simmons on the right team with a good fit and Mccollum as a sixth man would be great"
Monte Morris hit one at the end of a quarter in one of the games against the Suns
I knew when Kawhi couldn't get a layup to go over Monte Morris in transition  Man was spent
Why go that high?  Monte Morris and they win
Howard played 20 minutes the whole series. Monte Morris played more than campazzo. Jokic is not a better player than lebron
"&gt;And then we replaced Dennis Schröder with Russell Westbrook.  Oh you mean the Westbrook who carried the Wizards to (checks notes) 8th seed in the East?  He's also struggled these past couple of years. He's an improvement over Schroder but he's not someone who can carry a depleted roster anymore.  &gt;They had Murray for most of the season…  They actually won more after he got injured. They went from a ~50-win pace to a ~60-win pace. He's huge for them in the playoffs but he's generally nothing amazing in the regular season.   &gt;What you don’t seem to understand is Jokic misses even 10 or 15 games and the Nuggets are fucked.   Jokic has missed 2 games over the last 3 seasons in total. That's 268 games played out of a possible 270.  Which is why the Nuggets have been 3rd, 3rd and 2nd in the West over the past 3 seasons.   &gt;(unlikely for LeBron)  Huh?  In his 3 LA seasons, you've been 10th and 7th seeds precisely because he's started to miss significant time to injuries. He's one of the most durable players in NBA history, but he is slowing down now.  &gt;If Jokic gets injured, the Nuggets are left with Monte Morris and MPJ.  And if your aunty had a dick she'd be your uncle."
"&gt; Right...So the best team in the West nearly missed the playoffs because your two stars were injured?  And then we replaced Dennis Schröder with Russell Westbrook.   &gt;One of those stars is getting older and starting to miss more and more time to injuries.   LeBron at any age would have missed time if a grown man fell on his ankle.  &gt;The other star has been injury-prone his entire career.  AD had about 5 straight healthy seasons before this year.   &gt;So banking on them being healthy isn't a sure thing.  Lmfao stop trolling.  &gt; Yeah and the Nuggets were still the 3rd seed... They don't need Murray to be a playoff team, that's why they're safer.  They had Murray for most of the season…  &gt;Which is the part of this you don't seem to understand. I'm not saying the Nuggets are a better team than LA but the odds that they make the playoffs is higher.  What you don’t seem to understand is Jokic misses even 10 or 15 games and the Nuggets are fucked. The Lakers have the luxury of missing 2/3 stars and still making the playoffs comfortably.    &gt;Healthy LA beats healthy Denver but there's a lot more that could go wrong for LA.  No, there’s a lot more that can go wrong for Denver since they’re literally relying on a solo carry job.   &gt;Jokic can carry them to the playoffs on his own and he's a lot less likely to get injured than LeBron/AD.  If one of those two gets injured (unlikely for LeBron), we would still have the remaining superstar to go along with Russell Westbrook.  If Jokic gets injured, the Nuggets are left with Monte Morris and MPJ."
"Passing is largely subjective. Most objective metrics like Backpicks have Jokic as the best passer in the NBA.  It's hard to categorize players as passers. For me MPJ is a bad passer, Giannis is an average passer, Monte Morris is a good passer and Trae young is an elite passer. Backpicks Passer rating is probably the most advanced metric out there to judge passing ability but, even that is not all encompassing."
I could probably find you a stat that says Monte Morris has the highest FG% between the 6th and 10th minute of the 3rd quarter and it would be just as meaningful when assessing the player's overall impact
Monte is the best Morris twin
Monte is the best Morris twin
Off topic but I see the Cyclone/Nugget fan combo quite more often than I expect.  Not sure if a Monte Morris connection or a regional thing.
Monte Morris
Monte Morris is the best backup PG in basketball   (This is based purely off of my love of monte and nothing statistically)
"Tbf- the Nuggets have the steal of the 2014 draft (Jokic), two of the steals of the 2016 draft (Murray went 7 but should have gone no lower than #4, Beasley @ 19), one of the steals of the 2017 draft (Monte Morris @ 51), and the steal of the 2018 draft.  In other words-- this is sort of what they do. And Bones 28 is second to only Jamal's 29 in that span."
"Agree with Fox. As far as role players though, Nuggets got a steal with how much they’re paying Monte Morris. I think he could be a 20 plus ppg and 7apg if he started on other teams."
Personally I’d go Mann over THT and Monte Morris over Brooks but really cool and neat post
Nikola Jokic/Monte Morris/Facundo Campazzo love to run PnR thankfully!
"Man what a trash ass offer for us. Why would any team give up two *elite* shooters *and* picks for Ben ""Everyone Else's Skills Have To Cater To Mine"" Simmons. All y'all uneducated, don't actually play basketball, haven't watched a Wolves game in your life /r/nba nephews come up with the most ass ideas. Y'all have these elaborate tiers of player value based on how you guys see other people discuss them rather than having actually watched these guys, making everyone agree simultaneously with Raptors fans that OG is untouchable, but DLO is a negative asset, and CJ McCollum is also ass compared to Ben Simmons (tag my post y'all wack ass 76er fans, y'all never getting Dame).   Nevermind the fact that D'Angelo Russell played good (not passable, good) defense after his return from surgery, nevermind that for some reason because KAT isn't a mistake eraser you supposedly have to surround him with all plus defenders despite Jokic playing the same position with guys like Monte Morris, Jamal Murray, and MPJr surrounding him (successfully). Man, I just really hate y'all bum ass, can't hoop fools."
"Defensive rating has a ton of noise. It also generally works better to evaluate a team’s defense or a particular lineup’s defense when they’re a significant enough sample size.  A single postseason is also far too small a sample size to reliably evaluate a player’s defense.  Trae hasn’t played enough to qualify for the active players’ postseason offensive and defensive rating leaderboards. Or bball index’s postseason Lebron metric. Raptor recommends 1000 minutes at least and defaults to combining regular season and playoffs numbers (in which Trae has the 2nd worst defensive raptor, above only Bryn Forbes).  Even if you did look at just this past postseason, other defensive metrics don’t reflect as well on Trae. His d-Raptor of -4.6 was tied for 90th worst of 100 players. The only players that low who played multiple series (so one bad matchup didn’t skew the results) was Forbes, Conley, Monte Morris, Dwight Howard, and Rondo. He also was a -.5 in dbpm or 64th out of 91 which isn’t as bad but still isn’t average."
We got Monte Morris at PG until Murray gets back
Monte Morris is better
Don’t they still have monte Morris for backup pg?
you missed Monte Morris who is better than him... and also Facu would be getting minutes over Rivers simply because his defense is much better.
Only having Monte Morris is why they got swept by the Suns.
Because they have Monte Morris who is less of a headcase but can also shoot better.
If the Nuggets didn't have a million point guards already I'd say they'd be a good fit for him. He'd likely be better than everyone other than Monte Morris and could potentially get a ton of time on the court until Murray comes back for the playoffs.
Blazers lost to a guard rotation mainly consisting of campazzo and Austin rivers.  Nuggets didn't have Barton Murray and even Monte Morris just came back from injury
You can lose one (like Monte Morris) and a draft pick or two for Goran Dragic
I never get this right cause it always comes out of nowhere so I’m predicting Monte Morris to win
"See:  Denver starting last year with Murray, Monte Morris, Gary Harris, Will Barton, PJ Dozier, and Facu and having a starting backcourt of Facu and Austin Rivers come playoff time.  Depth is a wonderful thing to have."
Monte morris top 5 PG? Im sorry but hes never gonna get close to that. Way too many good PGs  I didnt see people put Ayton on Jokic or Embiid's level except some delusional Suns fans  Siakam won MIP in 2019 and had quite a few good performances in the playoffs. Then was an allstar and all-nba in 2020. He only looked bad once the pandemic hit and couldn't practice. He started to play well but got Covid which derailed his season
"Higher on: Monte Morris (top 5 PG in the league potential), Matisse Thybulle (future DPOY if he gets minutes), Nikola Vucevic (literally a 25/10 guy), Melo (too many bad takes of people thinking he's trash due to efficiency)  Lower on: Deandre Ayton (he's good, but people were acting like he was in the Embiid/Jokic tier during the playoffs), Draymond (he's become Dennis Rodman tier offensively), and then for younger guys, Lonzo went from underrated to overrated again, and Siakam had one breakout season and has looked otherwise eh."
"30 is easy.  Steph Curry, Lillard, Westbrook, Doncic, Kyrie, Trae Young, DeAaron Fox, Collin Sexton, Jamal Murray, Brogdon, Wall, Walker, Ja, DLo, Jrue Holiday, Lowry, Paul, Simmons, Conley, Lonzo, LaMelo, Dejounte Murray, Dragic, Rose, Smart, Haliburton, Mills, Reggie Jackson, Dinwiddie, Herro, Payne, Monte Morris. And Cade Cunningham, obviously.  I'd also take Rondo, Coby White, Clarkson, Teague, Campozzo and probably Maxey over Schroder."
"Enes didn't just get killed by Jokic isos, he got killed again and again on pnr coverage and provided minimal help defense against drives by noted elite slashers Monte Morris and Austin Rivers. It'd be hard to find a big in the league right now that would defend worse than he did that series. Nurk also deserves some shit for his defense that series (especially his ability to defend without fouling) but he was way more solid than Enes."
"Jokic is our best player; the man is clutch af, even his contested shot would probably be just as good if not better than most anyone else’s open shot on the team.  But open shot I’d definitely trust Jamal, MPJ, and *maybe* Will Barton but that’s definitely it. Off the bench I actually wouldn’t be mad if Monte Morris took the shot as well."
"That's true, and Monte Morris would have helped a lot. It's also a bunch of young athletes still learning how to play basketball. Athleticism gets you so far, but at some point you need to have an understanding of what you're supposed to be doing to create advantages against teams of Euroleague vets. If they stick together they might be completely different, perhaps completely unrecognisable, in 3 years' time -- or at the WC in 2 years.  It also illustrates why people who think that the 450 best basketball players in the world are in the NBA, that everyone else simply isn't good enough/as good, and that any NBA player would dominate in Europe, are nothing but close-minded and uninformed. The end of NBA benches is full of young athletes who are still getting used to basketball, and are only there for what they could be, not what they are. The Nigerian NT is the prime example of that.  I'm curious, how do you do cross-league ratings? Because that's a thoroughly non-trivial task!"
"Deni was a rookie, he showed flashes of being great. Now has a good development coach (same guy credited by Jokic, Murray, Monte Morris. Barton for their development as players)  Wes was the guy who innovated Denver’s offense and defensive schemes from bottom of the League to top 5. Denver FO said losing him was a huge deal."
"Even without Murray, Barton does not play the point guard role at all. He primarily plays the shooting guard role, while occasionally going into the pick and roll with Jokic. Monte Morris or Facu are the ones who do the primary ball-handling and distributing when Jokic is not.   Plus the Nuggets team has very few wings. MPJ is their only pure small forward, while you already have Monte, Facu, and PJ Dozier that play the pg role as well."
They should’ve gotten Monte Morris instead of Westbrook.
"In the regular season. We got torched by a backcourt of Campazzo, Rivers and Monte Morris in the playoffs."
"“We should’ve taken Monte Morris, dork!”"
Monte Morris was supposed to play idk why he pulled out
Monte Morris would have been huge for this team
Excited for next season when Monte Morris goes circles around him and then Murray drops 50 on the Lakers in the playoffs. We will probably still lose in 5 though
"2 of them are bottom 10 picks in the draft which are almost garbage.   2015 draft: 9/10 never played a game, the other lasted half a season  2016 draft: 3/10 never played a game, 5/10 were backups cut before finished their rookie deal, 2/10 were backups who finished their rookie contract and left the league  2017 draft: 3/10 never played a game, 5/10 were backups who didn't last their rookie contract, 1/10 finished his rookie contract and did not resign. 1/10 is **Monte Morris**  2018 draft: 2/10 never played a game, 5/10 did not last one season, 2/10 are playing backup minutes today, 1/10 is Shake Milton  2019 draft: 2/10 did not play a game, 3/10 did not last a season, 5/10 are backup players the best of which is **Jalen McDaniels (19 MPG)**  2020 draft: too soon to judge but 1 of them never signed with the team"
Carried by Monte Morris
"I understand it's value is pretty small But you can package it with other things to get actual assets.   And you can find contributors in that range. Shake Milton, Monte Morris, Georges Niang, Jalen McDaniels are all recent picks in the 50s who have found big roles in the NBA quite quickly."
"AG, Monte Morris, all the Denver picks from now till eternity."
Monte Morris floater 3 at the end of the third quarter game 6. We were down a bit prior to that and that shit gave us and him enough confidence to finish off the blazers in the fourth quarter.
Yup. Monte Morris might be the best backup PG in the league. Why would you trade him for an unproven rookie
"That just doesn't make much sense. We'd have to give up real assets to get that high up in the draft. Our best trade pieces are what, Monte Morris, Zeke Nnaji, and picks? No shot."
"If you are being serious, you are heavily underrating the value of Monte Morris or overrating the value of your pick. Monte is quite possibly the most consistent and trust worthy back up guard in the league now."
i want monte morris.
i want monte morris.
17 for monte morris?
"How so?  Any 52nd pick or undrafted player who is even a viable bench player is a steal.    The best 50+ pick from 2010-2018 were Jeremy Evans, Isaiah Thomas, Robert Sacre, Ennis, Jordan Mcrae, Brandon Dawson (because he was literally the only one to play an NBA minute), Georges Niang, Monte Morris, and Shake Milton.  Isaiah was obviously an insane outlier.  The rest of the guys are either below average role players or not in the league."
"Honestly this is probably the most success Iowa State players have had in the league ever. Monte Morris- one of the best 6th men in the league Tyrese Haliburton- ROY candidate this year, seems to be a key piece for the Kings moving forward  Georges Niang, Abdel Nader, Talen Horton-Tucker- All solid rotation players for playoff teams Plus you have guys like Matt Thomas, Naz Long, Deonte Burton, and Marial Shayok who have all had appearances on rosters for playoff teams.  Ironically, Royce White was one of the highest draft picks and he flamed out, although that obviously wasn't for on-court reasons."
"Just to add:  Isaac Okoro - Cavs,  Chinezie Metu- Sac,  Chuma Okeke - Orl,  Onyeka Okongwu - Atl,  Zeke Nnaji - Denver,  Udoka Azubuike - Jazz,  Desmond Bane - Mem,  Jordan Nwora - Bucks,  Daniel Oturu - Clips  Monte Morris - Den"

"If Morris said that, surely Campazzo enters the starting five and Monte contributes his points in the second unit. Not a bad plan"
"The Denver Nuggets are one healthy season away from winning a championship. They're not exactly up and coming so people forget that they're still very young: Jokic is 26, Jamal is 24, MPJ is 23, Aaron Gordon is 25, and Monte Morris is 26. If everything falls into place, they have the potential to be a dynasty.  In the brightest timeline, MPJ becomes Tracy McGrady, Jamal proves that he's the real Maple Jordan, Aaron Gordon turns into Warriors Iggy,  Jokic is Jokic, and they go on to win three championships in four years.  The brightestest timeline also involves RJ Hampton coming back home when he's an all-star, future league MVP Aleksej Pokusevski choosing the hardest road and joining the Nuggets dynasty because he can't win with those cats, Tim Connelly drafting another generational superstar in the 2nd round (i.e. Kai Sotto), Jokic playing well into his 40s without any decline in his play, and Bol Bol finally taking the leap to become a serviceable NBA player.  Or everything goes to shit because nothing good ever happens. Either way you'll still have fun because every single Nuggets player is hard not to root for."
Nigeria w/ Monte Morris and Anunoby could battle for Silver ngl. Their bigs look clueless out there
Monte Morris?
Blazers lost because they are ass on defense. Dame and CJ both were getting cooked by Monte Morris and Austin Rivers lmao
Jordan Farmar  Shannon Brown  Oscar Schmidt  Dino Radja  Arvydas Sabonis  Or...  Monte Morris  Tyrese Haliburton  Matt Thomas  Abdel Nader  Georges Niang
"Other decent draftees include Monte Morris, Malik Beasley"
Can we add Monte Morris as an honorary Morris brother for an addition squad?
"Current Monte Morris is solid.  I think prime Teague was slightly better than just solid.    Cause the answer is 100% prime teague, but if he was just ""solid"" that implies Morris is less than ""solid"" which isn't true, he's basically the definition of a solid PG, haha.  I'd say prime Teague was legit a good PG."
"Nuggets would have:  Nikola Jokic  Rudy Gobert  Donovan Mitchell  Jamal Murray   Evan Fournier   With Melo, Michael Porter Jr.,  Monte Morris and Manimal in the rotation"
I mean… he did out play Monte Morris
"I mean, our entire offenae is pretty much built off the two-man game between Jokic and Murray, so having him out was a pretty big deal. If Murray is there, we don't have to rely on MPJ as our 2nd option, which he isn't ready for, and our starting backcourt isn't Facu and Rivers. By the way, MPJ and Monte Morris weren't 100% either. If everyone is healthy, we go back to having a strong team where everyone is in their proper role. Murray, Barton, MPJ, Gordon and Jokic with Morris as a sixth man causes way more problems than Facu, Rivers, an injured MPJ, Gordon, Jokic and no clear sixth man does. At the very least, they don't get run off the floor.  With that being said, one team's injury situation doesn't diminish another team's accomplishments, and all the complaining about it during the playoffs and trying to downplay the two teams in the Finals has bothered me. There's been so many recent Finals that have been affected by injuries in recent history that it's pretty silly to continuously bring up the injury point this year or act like it hasn't happened before."
"Off the dome? Well, Schreoder, monte morris, Reggie Jackson, fultz, Hayes, kemba, Graham (it might be naw idk who'd starting) Dinwiddie, Conley, vanvleet. And thats not bottom 1/3"
"Not good business for a small, traditionally undesirable market like Denver. Tim Connelly has meticulously created a reputation for doing right by his players. It's the only chance for a place like Denver to retain players and attract free agents. If the Nuggets betray Murray like that, what message does that send to MPJ? Does AG decide to sign an extension? Does Jeff Green come over in unrestricted free agency? Do guys like Will Barton and Monte Morris take pay cuts to stick around? It might be good business for a season, but it would be a suicidal business decision after that."
"Monte Morris. While I think you'll see a big leap for MPJ, I think people are underestimating Monte Morris being able to hold the fort down in the regular season while Murray rehabs.  Morris is still only 26, and compared to any other player with as many or more assists boasts the best assist to turnover ratio ever.  Add that he is a career 39% 3pt shooter, finishes 70% at the rim for his career, 77% last season... you could argue that he is the best backup point guard in the league. As teams cheat on Jokic and MPJ, I think he has a real ability to make high IQ plays and punish teams that cheat off of him."
If you’re Philly - what’s better if available? CJ and another young wing on the roster or a Barton/Monte Morris and MPJ package?
"Monte Morris, Josh Hart, Otto Porter Jr, Larry Nance, Robin Lopez"
Monte Morris
"Starters: Curry/Paul George/Tatum/Giannis/Capela   Bench: Malcolm Brogdon/Wiggins/RoCo/MPJ/Myles Turner  Monte Morris/Marcus Smart  I tried not to go too crazy with the players. Most of them are decent defenders, and the versatility both on offense and defense is insane. The starting lineup is centered around the gravity of Steph and Giannis, who can create open looks for PG and Tatum. Capela is there mostly for defense, to provide a strong paint protector who’s still decently switchable. The bench lineup is much of the same, and can function both on its own or mixed in with the starters. I also included two solid backup guards in case Curry hurts his ankle ☹️."
1. Jayson Tatum  2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Bam Adebayo  4. De'Aaron Fox  5. John Collins  6. Lonzo Ball  7. Jonathan Isaac  8. OG Anunoby  9. Jarrett Allen  10. Monte Morris  11. Kyle Kuzma  12. Derrick White  13. Lauri Markannen  14. Luke Kennard
Facu ain't the backup. Monte Morris is.
Bro. Do you even know who Monte Morris is.
"It’s not really disingenuous. Gordon had to try being a primary secondary ballhandler for us for most of this season since Murray, Barton, Dozier and Monte Morris (our entire normal backcourt rotation) were all injured for most of his tenure. Which just isn’t what he’s good at, it’s what he struggled with in Orlando"
Good thing we got Monte Morris on a 3/27 deal
Lol and Monte Morris was 51st
Denver: AG + Monte Morris????
"They did, but Monte Morris drank it all."
Monte Morris
The actual score after the Kawhi 3 was 80-67. The scoring error came from a Monte Morris layup not being added and a Zubac layup counting double. This all happened around the two minute mark in the third quarter
"Apologies, your response seemed flippant to me. I'll remove that comment. It was wrong in hindsight.  The switch-ability of Murray/Harris is a far cry from that of Austin Rivers and Monte Morris.  Why do you think the Jazz and Clippers didn't ""target"" him like you think the Suns did?"
"I think two Jokics is the answer here, and is being underrated. Jokic makes defenses scream because he's a big man who can pass like a PG and score at all three levels. The Murray/Jokic PNR/PNP works because it's really hard to tell if Jokic is rolling to the rim or popping out to shoot a three (and 39% on 3.3 attempts is legit three point shooting for a big man). So imagine that two-man game, only you have *another* 7'0"" matchup nightmare as the ballhandler. You gotta consider the roster around them too; yeah, sure, the defense would stink, but a lineup of Jokic/Murray/MPJ/Gordon/Double Jokic would be lethal offensively, with those kind of offensive weapons having incredible playmakers to feed them. Plus, Facu/AG/Barton/Monte Morris/both Greens give the Jokics some respectable defensive role players on the floor, and Jokic really isn't a horrible defender, just a poor rim protector."
"Aaron Gordon, Monte Morris, lottery protected 1st round pick. But idk if we should even give up Morris"
"Monte Morris, Bol Bol, Zeke Njaji, &amp; a 1st"
I am far from an expert but for Denver:  Monte Morris  Will Barton  Michael Porter Jr  Aaron Gordon  Nicola Jokic  **Bench**  Campazzo   Rivers  Dozier   Jeff Green  Bol Bol  Could be forgetting someone and JaMychal Green may end up being in the 10 man rotation
So…for the Nuggets this is a tricky idea. Simmons is a major benefit on the defensive side but he’d need to fulfill a slashing role on the offensive end with the starters and play as point-forward with the reserves. So Monte Morris and two 1sts (one conditional) seems to work for me here.
"The two you mentioned + John Collins, Jarrett Allen, Josh Hart, Dillon Brooks, and Monte Morris are the other guys getting significant rotation play"
"Having Facu Campazzo, Monte Morris, and Austin Rivers as the first line of defense and Jokic as the second line is not going to go far in the playoffs. With Jokic, we really need to surround him with talented defenders to stay afloat against the best. Obviously, he is a powerhouse on offense who gets the team there in the first place. The Nuggets really need a Jrue Holiday and OG Anunoby type at guard, if they want to survive a CP3 pnr."
"Monte Morris has been a legit 6moty calibre player for like 3 years now, but he might end up ineligible this year because he'll likely get starter minutes with Jamal out"
"If Denver has to involve MPJ or Murray, then Denver should hang up immediately. I’m thinking more of a package of Monte Morris + Aaron Gordon + Bones Hyland/Zeke Nnaji and two-three first round picks. Not the greatest offer, but the Simmons trade market is pretty dry"
"Salary-wise, plenty.  * Boston: Al Horford  * Denver: Aaron Gordon + Monte Morris  * Portland: Covington + Derrick Jones Jr.  * LAC: Bledsoe + Kennard  * etc etc.  A lot of competitive teams have 1-2 bigger contracts they'd be fine parting with.   It's just those trades + picks aren't enough to compete with what Minnesota/Sacramento/Cleveland can offer up."
Will have a hefty luxury tax bill.  Also expect monte Morris to go somewhere else
"Denver vs. Bucks  If Jamal Murray gets back healthy, there’s no guarantee AT ALL that Lakers are the top team in the West. Denver was amazing post-AG Trade and now they have also added a bit of depth with Jeff Green.  Each playoffs, someone has been hurt (Barton, Murray, Monte Morris, or Gary Harris) and yet Jokic has been great and Denver has had some big wins.   Bucks I think has to be a bet on Nets being injured. Especially now without PJ Tucker who was needed to guard KD, I don’t see any chance the Bucks getting past a healthy Nets team. It needs to be KD that’s hurt for the Bucks to advance imo."
And the bee hive that produced the Big Honey? It belonged to Monte Morris.
"He was stuck because he was inconsistent chucker who didn't play defense. If he were really that good, he would've earned more minutes, like Monte Morris or Craig etc."
Monte Morris because he has a good ast/to ratio.
"Jokic, Murray, MPJ, Monte Morris, Aaron Gordon. pretty much would have to be those 5. not sold on Gordon, but you're not giving him up for nothing in that scenario. don't think you protect Barton or Dozier over Morris."
In what world is Facu starting over Monte Morris for the Nuggets lol.
yes it does. cj at the time is a better player than mpj. they both suck on defense . dame and jokic are both mvp level players. i prefer jokic but dame is still good. nurkic as a third option is comparable to aaron gordon. then you go into the part that makes portland better norman powell is better than everyone else on the nuggets. the players that were missing from the nuggets drop their depth alot. robert covington is better too than most of the rest of the nuggets players. pj doizer will barton and jamal all out they trade away monte morris for gordon. pretty much had no guards left over. then you have enes a turn style on defense but can give you a good 5 minutes when jokic. on paper blazer are much better than the injured nuggets. coaching really did them a big diservice. terry stotts should have been fired years ago.
Monte morris is getting paid 9 million per season when hed probably be worth 15-20 million for a playoff contender
"You guys have done stupidly well with lower draft picks, so I'm inclined to agree that it's on Bol Bol.  **2018:** Michael Porter Jr at 14.  **2017:** Monte Morris at 51.  **2016:** Malik Beasley at 19.  **2014:** Nikola Jokic at 41."
Monte Morris is such a dumbass
Monte Morris looks like baby faced LeBron. This is either old news or I need glasses.
"I'm not sure how you think Jokic is targeting JA here, his focus is on Markkanen from the moment Markkanen gets the ball. Granted, he's playing soft so he can try to steal the pass and/or make a late switch to Allen since no one's covering him, but Markkanen's still his focus. If anything it's Monte Morris who's the secondary defender, he quite clearly starts out targeting Garland and then switches to help Jokic with Markkanen.  The key phrase there is making the play *after* the defense is beat. The defense wasn't beat there yet, it was just very soft. Not what the RA rule is attempting to target."

Nah that's Monte Morris
Monte Morris averaged 5.5 this past off-season. Is he a playmaking top 75 player then?
"We are hoping that once Murray comes back after the all-star break we can alternate Morris and Barton with the bench unit, given that Jamal can play both guard positions. Also we will see how the Bones-Rivers situation develops, given that Malone has said that Bones has done enough to get minutes in the rotation, and Rivers is not playing well right now.  At the end of the day it probably won't matter, the playoff rotation will need Murray at an All-star level to really be 1st tier contenders, and if we are healthy we alredy have the 9 men rotation with Murray/Barton/MPJ/AG/Jokic and Monte/Dozier/Green/Green off the bench, with Campazzo for certain matchups, and maybe one of the young guys breaks out at some point."
"Campazzo was in the rotation with a healthy Murray, Malone loves the guy and even moved Monte Morris out if position to fit him in."
"So they changed the Jakob out of bounds call but not the Monte Morris one? 🤔  gg tho Denver, Jokic too OP"
Is Monte Morris trash or something? Thought dude was a good backup PG. He has 2 points 😞
I actually think Jamal being out won't hurt us as much as people think for the regular season because Monte Morris is so good
"Fam Dame played the nuggets (without Jamal Murray) lmao not the 2004 pistons Jesus. Dames direct matchup was Austin rivers, Facu Campazzo and monte Morris"
"In my opinion, MPJ doesn’t have a great “feel for the game” yet. Which is fine because he has started less than one full season’s worth of games, and I expect it to improve. But it’s one of the most important parts of playing next to Jokic. Guys like Jamal, monte Morris, Gary Harris in the past, fit so well because they see the whole floor and react according to the situation, and that’s where Jokic is most dangerous. Finding cutters, off script passes, just general game sense. MPJ has all the tools and skills, but can get stagnant on offense when a play isn’t run for him. I think that is the key to really unleashing him offensively."
monte morris is so bad LOL
"Monte Morris, PJ Dozier, Will Barton, Bones Hyland… Nuggets are deep at guard if all of them don’t die at the same time. There is a good chance Rivers hardly sees the floor this year."
"Nuggets fan here. Excited to see how much run Bones Hyland gets. He's looked great in preseason, very crafty and a smart player.   The nuggets desperately need shot creation with Murray being out, ESPECIALLY the bench. Now that Monte Morris is starting, our bench units look lost at times. But Bones seems to be great at getting his shots, and I think he will be utilized often.  His ROY odds are +4500 right now. I think it's worth the flier. You heard it here first folks"
"Cap rises are really messing with people's sense of good/bad contracts. Current cap is $112M, while some teams are paying up to $180M. $10M/y is not much at all, just barely above the full non-taxpayer MLE. Also, in a couple of years, this contract should be fairly easily tradeable, regardless of Shamet's usefulness on the court.  This is also outside of the top 100 AAV, which kind of reflects where Shamet is as a player. He provides shooting, which is at a premium in today's NBA, and makes up the backend of a rotation. Maybe they could have negotiated him down to like 4yr/$36M, but then they risk losing him.  Non-rookie contracts in this price range (+/- 1M/year, from higher to lower) include: Devonte Graham, Dillon Brooks, Richuan Holmes, Dwight Powell, Reggie Jackson, (Shamet here), THT, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, (below this are the full MLE guys)  For a career backup, this is around the range you'd expect. Probably the argument here is for Shamet to be paid more like Monte Morris 3yr/$27M, Alex Caruso 4yr/$37M, Royce O'Neale 4yr/$36M, Daniel Theis 4yr/$36M, but perhaps the Suns were worried about losing some shooting at a position they aren't super deep at (with only CP3, Booker, Cam Payne, and Elfrid Payton as the other dedicated guards)."
"Ayton was their only consistent inside scorer and interior defensive presence in that playoff run.   MPJ’s scoring prowess is easily offset by the likes of Jamal Murray, Monte Morris, AG, and Will Barton. etc. MPJ may have the bigger hype but his skillset was easily replaceable on the Nuggets compared to what Ayton brought for the Suns."
"Joining other euro legends Monte Morris, Matt Thomas and Talen Horton Tucker"
"Both guys have hardly played.   And look at previous years...   Terrance Mann, Horton-Tucker, Eric Paschell, Bruce Brown, Diallo, Svi Mykhailluk, Shake Milton, Monte Morris, Dillon Brooks, Thomas Bryant...   These guys are actually playing minutes and were drafted in the 40s/50s. Its not that unusual."
"As someone who bet on him and watched him at Marquette a lot, dude is still adjusting to the NBAs speed and size. His sliver of looks got smaller and hes having to shoot over bigger hands. But I personally see him adjusting and coming out of nowhere in a season or two. Especially with Denvers track record for developing guys. He will have a Monte Morris type resurgence Im calling it now!"
"There consistently been one great older college pg that comes out every year. With Monte Morris, Brunson, Tre Jones, and butler in line with that title imo"
"It’s hard to copy Denver. They’ve been one of the best drafting teams in the league. Getting Jokic in the second round is obvious, but they’ve also hit on a ton of mid to late first round picks.   ### All their first round picks were great in 2016  -	Jamal Murray (#7 Pick) -	Juan Hernangomez (#15) -	Malik Beasley (#19)  ### They got a solid player in 2017, despite not having a first round pick.  -	Monte Morris (#51)  ### Michael Porter Jr was obviously a steal in 2018  -	Michael Porter Jr (#14)  ### No Pick in 2019  ### Both their picks in 2020 seem to have potential   -	Zeke Nnaji (#22) -	RJ Hampton (#24)  ### Bones Hyland has played super well in pre-season  -	Bones Hyland (#26)"
denver always coming with dudes I've never heard before and have them play well...it was Craig torrey and monte morris previously
Monte Morris damn near drew a swastika lol
"Monte Morris averaged 10.5 points, 3.8 assists and 2.2 rebounds in 13 games as a starter in 2020-21.  Jalen Brunson averaged 16.6 points, 3.8 rebounds and 3.7 assists in 12 games as a starter in 2020-21."
"The Nuggets have had far more makes than misses in the draft since Connelly replaced Masai in 2013. All of these players are either on the Nuggets roster or still in the NBA:  2014 Gary Harris (I know he was technically traded for, but that's because that's how draft day trades work in the NBA, Denver drafted him as far as I'm concerned) Jusuf Nurkic (same situation as Harris) Nikola Jokic  2016 Jamal Murray (the very last pick acquired from the Knicks in the Carmelo Anthony trade from 2011) Malik Beasley  Juancho Hernangomez (movie star Juancho)  2017 Vladko Cançar Monte Morris  2018 Michael Porter, Jr.  2019 Bol Bol  2020 Zeke Nnaji  2021  Bones Hyland  7 of these guys are on their active roster still. The ones that were traded returned guys like Aaron Gordon and Mason Plumlee, who have been big contributers currently and formerly in Denver).  Not to mention after draft signings in recent years like Facu Campazzo, PJ Dozier and Torrey Craig.    Denver has one of the best run front offices in the NBA."
Monte Morris
dlo hid behind monte morris for that steal
"Monte Morris. He's a solid PG who's flown under the radar behind Jamal Murray and is already probably one of the best backup PGs in the league.  With Jamal Murray out, he should get a chance to start and get more minutes surrounded by much better talent. General high IQ player who has one of the best assist to turnover ratios in the league should really benefit and be able to take advantage of the attention that Jokic, MPJ, Barton, and even Gordon will draw. Last season he shot 38% from 3 and 48% overall, with a TS% of 57.4% and eFG% of 54.7%, numbers I think he can sustain or even improve upon with more minutes next to Jokic on higher volume as he have more opportunities to exploit defenses while he flies under the radar.  He should also see a bump in assists due to the sheer amount of scoring talent around him. On top of all that he just turned 26 so he there is potentially still another level to his game."
"Barton played all but one game, and played well at roughly normal minutes. I have no idea what Monte Morris injury you're talking about *or* what AG injury - I must have missed something so if you want to link to an injury report for something please do, I can't find anything on that.  &gt; and the 7th guard to start the season was the lead guard (Facu) in the playoffs  It looks like Facu had played the 5th most minutes out of any Nugget player in the regular season, *and* was good in the series. It's a bit much to complain about being 'forced' to play Campazzo.  Anyway, I said it in another comment, but if you want to count ticky tack stuff and playing through injuries then you have to credit CP3 with his injuries in the series. I'm not pretending that Denver was only missing Jamal, but sorry if I'm not bringing up PJ Dozier as a piece that swings a comfortable sweep into a Nuggets series win."
"Or Barton, or Dozier, and Monte Morris coming back from injury 10 days prior to the series."
Aaron Gordon just signed for 4 years 78m or so and Monte Morris is signed for another 2 years 24m
"Let's just say you are grossly oversimplified the situation.  The year we won 54 (54!) games Barton and Gary got badly hurt (and have never been the same). There were two other above average starters on that team (Murray, Sap) and then a bunch of kids. Young players are almost always net negatives and yet we came within a game of the WCF. If Barton and Gary had stayed healthy you'd have a point-- but they didn't.  The next year we traded Malik bc he wanted to be a starter and brought in Grant. But Sap's play fell off a cliff and Harris play fell off a cliff post-injuries. I'd call them both below average starters by playoff team standards. Morris rise sort of replaced Malik. Torrey Craig is a solid 10th man but the rest of the bench was a net negative pretty much the whole year due to the lack of scoring. People also have a misperception in regards to how good Grant for us. Every stat painted him as a negative player until he was moved to SF in the playoffs. Luckily Murray took a leap forward. And as to MPJ-- the reason he wasn't playing is bc Malone was focused on developing him as a player and getting rid of bad habbits. Again, young players usually don't add to winning.  Last year was the most talented team on paper... except we lost Grant and Plumlee (our backup Cs were AWFUL) and right when we traded for Gordon we lost Barton, Monte, PJ and Murray to injury.  Long story short-- as the guys original comment indicated- we have had horrific injury luck during Jokic's main run. Including injuries that destroyed the career of Harris and turned Barton injury plagued. Meanwhile-- a lot of the depth you point to were kids on rookie contracts aka that period in a career where they aren't particularly good. But our coaching staff is elite at player development and so they are in a good place to take a leap once they leave Denver (see Malik, Vandy or even Grant)."
And Monte Morris at 51 is a crazy good pick
"Philly makes out like a bandit if you include all their picks.  Ben Simmons --&gt; Ingram,  Korkmaz --&gt; Siakam, Fultz --&gt; Ball, Matthias Lessort ---&gt; Monte Morris, Mikal Bridges ----&gt;  Shai Gilgeous , Shamet ---&gt; Time Lord.  Like... LOL  PG: Shai/Morris  SG: Ball  SF: Ingram  PF: Siakam  C: Embiid/Time Lord"
"He hit on Monte Morris too. And in 16 with 3 first rounders they got Murray, Beasley and Hernangomez. Really the worst pick he's made is Mudiay. Also not a fan of the Beasley trade but the dude was an idiot."
"Not even just the core locked up but we've also locked up our primary bench pieces (Monte Morris and PJ Dozier), we've got control of the majority of our future draft picks, and we still have intriguing young talent like Bol Bol and, Bones Hyland, and Zeke Nnaji.  Tim Connolly still has all the firepower to swing for a huge trade without even having to touch one of Murray, Jokic, or MPJ."
"And I’m super happy about it, mostly because I disagree heavily with your criticisms of those players.  In terms of the surrounding cast, you’re always going to have role players on smaller deals surrounding your max players on any contending team. Denver happens to be very good at finding and developing talent through the draft/udfas/2-way contracts etc. Monte Morris, PJ dozier, Torrey Craig, Terence Davis, Kendrich Williams we’re all 2 way guys our FO found just in the past few years."
"That's not a good offense, no one to run the pick and roll with other than Monte Morris"
"AG+Monte Morris makes some sense both ways tbh.   Philly gets a competent PnR PG who can score a bit, and AG replaces what Ben gives them defensively. Picks + AG might be enough of a package to get a star in the future as well, who knows.   Denver consolidates two guys in to one. Ben can run the point while Jamal is out, and take on the best opposing wing in the absence of AG. Ben could push it on the break, and, on paper, works much better with Jokic than Embiid. He could camp the dunkers spot all he wants. The Nuggets have enough shooting to space everything, and a Jokic/Simmons high/low game could be nasty.  Having said all that, AG can’t be traded till close to the deadline. It won’t make since for the Nuggets to make a Simmons trade till then."
"Only an elite offensive player for 2 years? Bullshit. The stats have said Jokic has been an elite offensive player literally since he started playing in the NBA.  He was also the first team All NBA center 3 years ago so you're full of shit.  Last - this idea that Kawhi had to carry the Clips offense more than Jokic had to carry the Nuggets in the playoffs is straight up *wild* considering, again, PG13 exists, and was healthy. PG averaged 29 against the Mavs so is he also an all time offensive player? 9.5 boards and 5 apg too (slightly more than Kawhi did on that front). Reggie Jackson meanwhile averaged 18 ppg against the Mavs.  For comparison, the Nuggets next highest scorers against the Blazers after Jokic (again, 33 ppg) were MPJ - 18 ppg, and Monte Morris, 15 ppg and Aaron Gordon, 12 ppg vs Portland. Everyone else was 10 ppg or below for the Nuggets vs Portland. Not a single other player averaged double figures. Marcus Morris averaged 13 ppg for the Clips, Terance Mann 10, to go along with those PG + Reggie Jackson. It's not a close comparison here as to who had to shoulder a larger burden on offense. Not even a little close."
"Jeff Green, Aaron Gordon, Monte Morris?"
"I mean that's pretty damn debatable - it seems rather like you either dont watch much Nuggets if ever, or you just believe scoring is all that matters for offense given you just keep saying he scored many points. But - Jokic is one of the two best midrange shooters in the NBA statistically (along with one Kevin Durant - this has been the case since Jokic entered the league as well), and shoots from there quite frequently (and while I'm not going to go track down where their shots came from overall in the playoffs, in round 1 Kawhi shot 40 3s over 7 games - Jokic shot 35 3s in 6 games - the point is that your ""paint vs midrange"" is not really that significant, given that Jokic was literally the team's only person capable of regularly handling the ball at times in the playoffs, and how much each team sold out to stop him - all of his shots are contested too, for the most part). So, all that to say: Against Portland Jokic averaged 33 ppg on 53/43/92, without the Nuggets whole regular guard rotation except Monte Morris, and without his second best player. I'd argue 33 ptspg on those efficiency numbers with only one of your top 4 guards playing &gt; 30 ppg with a fully healthy roster, personally. Also worth noting that the Mavs have uh... exactly zero good defensive players to put on Kawhi and PG. The Blazers meanwhile matched Nurkic to Jokic's minutes and it's worth noting that when Nurkic played last year, Portland defended at a top 10-11 level. So there's that.   Jokic wore down against the Suns shooting very poorly compared to all his previous playoff series, but still averaged 25 ppg... and while Will Barton played the last 3 games of that series he was clearly still hobbled, and the Nuggets still were without Murray and their best perimeter defender in PJ Dozier - the Suns basically loaded up to stop Jokic because the Nuggets had literally no one else who could handle the ball and reliably punish them.   Jokic and Kawhi's assist numbers in round 1 are also in fact nearly identical, except one of them was playing without his second best player and the rest of his starting and backup guard rotation.  OH! And while Jokic's efficiency went way down against PHX, Kawhi's also went down against Utah. He didnt shoot 60% for this whole playoff run. Against Utah he averaged 27, 7 and 4 on 50 (still really good!), 33 (much less good), 84.   That all said, I'd be curious what Kawhi might average without PG13, Reggie Jackson, Terence Mann, and whomever else would work as the last guard. He might average a similar amount of points. Might even still be really efficient. I'd be willing to bet not as efficient though, and likely with fewer assists. But it's not even a fair comparison really given the Clippers were *healthy* in the playoffs, until Kawhi got hurt.   Last - Steph Curry conserves his energy on offense? WHAT? Have you ever uh... watched Steph? Or did you mean on defense? If you meant on defense, that might be true (though I dont think in the playoffs you can really do that), but *we aren't talking about defense*. Literally just offense."
Monte Morris will win MIP.  Haliburton will have a better career than Lamelo
"not great but hey, durant, that's something  murray (if / when he comes back) -&gt; **ben gordon**     otherwise monte morris -&gt; **moochie norris**  barton -&gt; **doug west**  gordon -&gt; **kenneth faried**  porter  -&gt; **kevin durant**  jokic  -&gt; **nikola vucevic**"
Nuggets with Barton Dozier and Jamal Murray out with a hobbled Monte morris is absolutely a worse team than the mavs without Luka.
"""Too far in the playoffs"" I think needs a bit of definition. I mean, he literally won a playoff series last year against a fully healthy Portland team with a worse team than this year's team. They started Austin Rivers and Facu Campazzo for the first 4 games of the series until Monte Morris was healthy enough to start in games 5 and 6. Like, he's already proven he can do it. And they've been top 3 in the west each of the last 3 years - the only team which can say that in the West. He's just that good.   The Nuggets on their losing streak were missing their top 3 players, it'd be like if the Dubs were without not just Curry/Klay but also Draymond Green... and Jordan Poole, given that the Nuggets were also without Bones. Of course they went 0-fer in that stretch.   Now both guys are back and they pounded the Heat, they're back on track, and only a game out of 4th place. The entire middle of the west is super packed together right now... so I think they'll still end up top 4, and maybe they'll even catch Utah (that's a bit less likely, but Utah isnt that far ahead really, just a couple games)."
Monte Morris at McDonald’s last night:  “I’ll have a medium number 6 with a coke please”
"The Nuggets starters are still pretty good compared to their bench. And Jokic is just that good, Luka doesn't even compare to how valuable Jokic to Nuggets is right now. And btw Aaron Gordon and Monte Morris on/off are also above +20, but bench player like Campazzo and Rivers have -20."
"Come on now…Ya’ll GSW fans gas the fuck outta your roster until it comes to the MVP convo then they’re all scrubs?  Draymond Green, Andrew Wiggins, Otto Porter, Jordan Poole is a million times better than Will Barton, Monte Morris, Aaron Gordon, Jeff Green.  I don’t know if what Jokic is doing in Denver w/o MPJ and Murray is sustainable, but if it is and they make the playoffs, that’s the MVP."
"It is not shit at all, the only other pointguards worst than Russ in the league are:  - Kemba (no more a starting pg) - Jalen Green - Jalen  Suggs - Cade  - Graham - Monte Morris - Reggie Jackson - Aaron Holiday  That's it. You could argue about Dennis Scrotum also been worst than Russ, but at least he seems more adaptable. And also Lowry is playing bad for now. Anyway if Russ isn't in the worst 10 PG is for sure below average (aka been worst 15).   And that's a fact, if you are dumb I cannot do anything about that."
"Jokic, Barton, Aaron Gordon, and Monte Morris is a good enough team to compete for a lower seed in the west. Who knows maybe Murray comes back"
Monte Morris &amp; Brunson prefect low usage PGs
"#Yes, just dont have Jameer Nelson, Muday, Barton, Monte Morris, Campazzo, Rivers, Markus Howard, Wilson Chandler, and Murray defend perimeter."
"So I think there’s a very fair case that Steph is the best in the world, and he’s probably who my pick would be. But you’re kind of accidentally arguing that Jokic is the best right now lol.

"I would say that the Barton hate is injustified and goes away quickly when he performs well, meanwhile Bol Bol definitely has something going on.   He even low key caught some strays from Monte Morris last game in the post conference for being extremely passive and out of focus on the court last game.   You would think that not having much chances he would go out there trying to destroy everyone to show what he´s worth in the few times he can get minutes but as soon as he touches the court you know why he is often out of the rotation.  Maybe other fanbases like him because they see him as a meme or something, but I am not so sure that other teams scouts think the same."
Probably Monte Morris and a 2nd rounder.
"Surely Monte Morris continues to start ahead of Campazzo for the foreseeable future. I would pair Morris and Rivers, and Campazzo and Hyland, as backcourt duos. I think what Dozier's injury does is now make Barton and probably Jeff Green spend more time at the 3 spot (a bit of a change for latter-day Green)."
You’re right I confused him with Monte Morris
Why does Monte Morris hate us so much?
"Beef Stew definitely is his nickname but Basketball Reference is famously loaded with insane nicknames no one has ever heard of. This website would have you believe that Monte Morris is known as ""The Count of Monte Assist/TO"". I literally loaded a random Hall of Famer's page and if you can tell me who ""Tuss"" is without looking it up, big ups from me."
"Monte Morris, he’s a great 2nd unit leader, and can run with the starters"
"Monte Morris, Jalen Brunson, Robinson Earl"
The even better thing was that instead of having a guy from the stands we has Will Barton and Monte Morris. A legit starter on any team and a great 6th man on an even better contract respectively.  But that lasted for less than 12 games or so before Jamal and Barton went down and now we’ve got this going on as well

Monte Morris has to be more aggressive with jokic out
"I think A.d. would work better with Rudy gobert. He's a juiced up javal Mcgee and Dwight Howard since he doesn't like playing  the 5 often.   Giannas and Jokic would be crazy with Murray running the offense or Middleton.   I got Monte Morris, Jamal Murray, Aaron Gordon, giannas and jokic.   Dennis Schroder,  Mitchell ,  Joe Ingles . A.d. gobert"
If you consider assists to turn over ratio MOnte Morris has been up near the top or at the top since he has been a Nugget. Both Harden and Steph have a lot of TOs.

"Dude.  They also had Kyrie and Kevin Love and an age 30 JR Smith.  LeBron ain't beating anyone with a starting backcourt of Monte Morris, Facundo Campazzo, and Austin Rivers like Jokic had during the playoffs last year."
"Yeah I’m with you, we have always been super deep but our depth comes from players who don’t have big names. For example — not a lot of ppl had heard of Monte Morris but the first year he got real playing time and ran our bench unit he had the best A/TO ratio in the league. He is a guy who could easily be a starting PG on a different team"
"I appreciate the super passive aggressive and condescending post so I hope you like mine in response.  &gt; The Blazers suck bro lol who cares  I dunno the media, the gamethreads here when it happened, players reacting to it, Lillard saying it was unexpectable to lose to a team missing so many important guys. I mean sure man whatever you want to say, I guess they do suck--at least compared to how the Nuggets played that series.  But then again they had more wins last year than New York, Atlanta, Miami, Boston, LA, same amount as the Mavs. They found a way to suck all the way to that point, and Lillard found a way to suck to All-NBA second team.   Also, Jokic got exploited by the Blazers on defense in that series?   Sheesh how did a team who was fully healthy, with the league's 3rd leading scorer, with the 20th best scorer in the league next to him, and just for kicks another 17ppg scorer, lose to the Nuggets if it was going to be so easy to expose the cornerstone of their defense?  I mean the Nuggets were missing their two starting guards and their best guard defender, how did Portland lose when those All-NBA level scorers were being guarded by two 5'9"" rookies, one of which who hadn't played all year, Austin Rivers who just got signed by the team and doesn't know the defensive concepts, Monte Morris who is not known for his defense, and a two-way contract player you've likely never heard of named Shaq Harrison.  I mean jeez you'd expect that to just be a free bucket every time down the floor, especially when there's this center that you have pointed out got EXPLOITED!!! all series!   I mean if the Nuggets have all these terrible defenders (who also can't score) because they're missing two starters, and their most important player keeps getting exploited on defense, how could they even possible keep up with the kind of scoring pace Portland must have been on?   Someone on the Nuggets must have had a really special performance to pull out a win like that I guess!  Anyway I'd kill to get some examples of that from you because I've watched the whole series multiple times. I do not think that Jokic got exploited whatsoever on defense, besides what teams try to get switch wise on every center in the league from Zubac to Gobert to Bam, or what happens when your guards are rookies who can stay in front of anyone and give up free lanes to the basket forcing 2v1s.   As far as the Suns go I'm not even sure what you're trying to say. That Jokic didn't guard the Suns guards that well? No kidding! Imagine a 7fter who can run around and guard CP3 all the time. It doesn't exist. Giannis gets killed by him, AD gets killed by him, Bam gets killed by him, that's why they force those switches onto bigs.  That's like me saying to you that Jimmy Butler is a terrible defender because Embiid kept exploiting him. Couldn't stop Embiid. Got torched by him, it was obvious to anyone watch.   It's like yeah man, this is a game of advantages. You work to find the best advantage you can, like getting a 7ft center on a wing player, or getting the switch as a PG vs. a center.   Your ""it was obvious to anyone watching"" comment is even more ironic be because when Jokic has the highest defensive splits on the team that series. He was without question the Nuggets best defender.  It would have been super obvious to anyone watching what was happening there. Not only was Jokic not the one getting exploited/exposed on defense by the Suns guards. It was Michael Porter Jr. who got switched onto quite literally 90% of the possessions he was in the game. That's what the press conferences were about when defensive questions were asked to Malone. That's why reporters asked CP3 if they were singling him out because they knew it was a weakness.   Additionally if you were watching the game you'd have realized that we had absolutely horrific point of attack defense. Again, another thing you can either watch or hear Michael Malone talk about in the pressers.   Monte Morris, Austin Rivers, and Facu Campazzo could not stay in front of the Suns guards for the life of them. CP3 and Booker were blowing by them like there was no defender there, when they weren't switching onto MPJ, and making the big have to step up and deal with the penetration while also somehow trying to play the lob threat to Ayton. Whether it was Jokic, or McGee, or Green, all of them kept getting put in 2v1 situations in the midrange/key because the guard defense was so spectacularly bad.   If it's too much trouble to watch that and see that indeed the sky is blue, the stats also back that up as one of the worst perimeter defensive performance of all time. No hyperbole."
"And Jokic is putting up better numbers than either with Monte Morris as his #2 on offense rn, #2, #3 and #4 guys all out"
"PPG is cool, he's also an atrocious defender, a below average playmaker for a guy that has the ball that much, and a guy who has never been able to carry line ups without Dame to positive outcomes.  So really the only thing he does well is score, and he does it at an average efficiency every year but one (2017).  He was a big reason the Blazers went into the WCF at 28 (btw alos a big reason why the Blazers lost against a team whose best guard was Monte Morris last year), that doesn't mean him having a 36 millions dollars salary when he'll be 33 isn't a horrible contract"

Turns out Monte Morris was the third twin the whole time!
I hadn’t heard about this incident before I saw a “Jokic vs Morris fight” headline and I thought it was Monte who initiated it
And Monte Morris and Aaron Gordon will average 20 each and Denver will lose 90-120 every night
"Stupid hard foul but baby jokic what is you doing big dawg? Mpj hurt and your team needs you man, he’s probably suspended for 5+ games leaving Aaron Gordon and Monte Morris to lead this team"
Monte Morris with the team high +15
"nah will barton is good so is monte morris and gordon is one of the best defenders in the league  MPJ should be playing better than he has, big regression from him so far this year"
Monte Morris Jr
"Basically him and Monte Morris are the gods of this specific stat, hence the nickname The Count of Monte AST/TO, which is probably the best nickname I've ever heard; its even on his Bbref page."
"Nuggets have not impressed me. I know they’re likely getting Murray back at some point but I don’t think Monte Morris switching to the bench once Murray is healthy will save the terrible bench lineup. Malone’s insistence on playing the majority of the bench together, especially the Greens, is a nightmare. It wouldn’t surprise me if they’re a play in team.       Portland is missing the playoffs. I know Dame has a core injury and that’s had to do with his poor shooting to start the year but I think the roster stayed the same and teams like Sacramento, Minnesota, and Memphis have all gotten better which will push Portland to a play in team or worse.       Toronto and Cleveland will be 5-8 seeds and one or both of them will upset a higher seed in the first round. One or both of them will also make a solid addition near the deadline to get them there."
"&gt; They drafted Lydon who i wouldn't have drafted with the 60th pick. How come these proffesional front office geniuses with much better scouting and information than me fucked that up?  Dunno what to tell you there. Teams will reach for a gamble with their late 1st. Nothing is guaranteed at that point whatsoever. You can confirm this with how many players drafted after him are out of the league, it is almost all of them. They had some sort of intel that told them that maybe this was a little bit better of a gamble than others. Of the ones who are still in the league now only Kyle Kuzma, Derrick White, and Dillon Brooks are starters. Not exactly guys anyone thought to pick either.  Luckily Denver also found Monte Morris late in that draft who is now the best back up PG in the league.  &gt; Giving Jamal the contract a year early your risk is fairly high while the reward is at least comparable as giving him the contract a year later . Giving him the contract a year later your risk is clearly much lower while the reward is roughly the same if not bigger. Surely you agree with this.  No, I don't agree with this because I've followed the NBA long enough and have seen enough lousy rookie/RFA/UFA situations to know that if you think your player will be worth that, then give it to them. Countless times they wait a year and it sours the player, it says to other players we are going to make you wait to get contract security as long as we possibly can, we want to wait for you not to get injured another year before we commit to you, and when they go to RFA they get to hear from other teams how much that team values them, how the team they're on didn't give them the max but that they would have, that they're going to do everything that their other team can't do if their team doesn't match the max. Whether or not they end up staying with the team, that has a huge impact on someone in their early 20s.   Again, this isn't 2K, the human element in this is a huge deal. That's why all these teams secure their guy a year early. It's not like the ""logic"" and math isn't obvious. It's that it's clearly outweighed by the negatives, considering if the player plays the exact same as they did the last year you're gonna give it to them anyway."
"Check out Aldon Smith's record. He got multiple chances from the Niners alone. But the bigger point is, he didn't have long Reddit/Twitter threads dedicated to how shitty of a person he is. Pretty sure Monte Morris has had some recent legal troubles. Nobody wants him booted from the league. Journalists certainly don't research these players in order to drop juicy exposes.  Sarver seems like a big time ass, but the world is full of them."
"The mid-2010s Iowa state teams were loaded in retrospect. Niang, Monte Morris, Abdul Nader, Naz Long, Matt Thomas, Deonte Burton have all been in the league. Niang and Buddy Hield were the main big 12 guys of that period who actually scared me bc of how good they were.   Interesting how the narrative at the time was my Kansas teams had the big players and ISU was the scrappy underdog when really Niang and Morris have had far better careers than Perry Ellis and Frank Mason have had. Fuckin Steve prohm"
It'll get better with Monte Morris leading the bench.
"You don’t trade either unless you’re getting a bonafide star… I wouldn’t trade for depth. The Celtics need playmakers. Both Tatum and Brown need to improve their playmaking but they need a couple of players who know how to run an NBA offense. They don’t have to be All Star caliber. Someone like Ricky Rubio would be great there, Monte Morris off the bench. They just need a couple of players to break up the iso ball so that it’s a last resort rather than a first resort."
"One of the Nuggets players has a nickname inspired by the book!  One of Monte Morris' nicknames is ""Count of Monte Assist/TO"". It's even on his Basketball Reference page."
We call Monte Morris the Count of Monte AST/TO
Stop giving Facu minutes. We already have a second unit point guard in Morris who shines in the role. Swapping any guard on the roster besides Bones into the starting lineup.with Monte would imrove rotations so much.
"Somewhat apropos of this, I always enjoyed Monte Morris nickname 'The Count of Monte Assist /TO'"
"No scorers and almost no chemistry. Before you had Will Barton and Monte Morris off the bench who are both facilitators who can score, now they're in the starting line up. Now you have Campazzo, Rivers, PJ Dozier and two Greens. That's not bad on paper but that means the main playmaker is Campazzo who's great at passing but isn't a scoring threat so NBA defenses can easily play around his weaknesses.     If Bones keeps playing as well as he's playing, he could potentially be the 6th man in his rookie season which is unprecedented for Malone. Nuggets fans are all for it."
Monte Morris a little too involved if I'm a Denver fan...
Monte Morris with a +32.... lol
"Jamal Murray, Monte Morris, Jusuf Nurkic, Malik Beasley."
"&gt;THT wanted to stay and the Lakers wanted the same.   lmaoooooo  If someone else wanted to sign THT they would sign him. The fear was that the Lakers would get poison-pilled. But no, crickets.  Let's see who else is earning around THT's range (9.5). I've put in bold text the ones who signed in the same FA year as THT.  **- Richaun Holmes (10.3)**  **- Devonte Graham (11)**  **- Shmurda (10.3)**  \- Jae Crowder (9.7)  **- Danny Green (10)**  **- Reggie Bullock (9.5)**  \- Seth Curry (8.2)  \- Monte Morris (8.4)  \- **Caruso (8.6)**  Source: [https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/)  THT is the NBA version of ""it doesn't matter what you know, it's who you know""  I mean it's just the price of dealing with LeBron/Klutch. That's just the way it is. At least you already got a ring out of it."
"Campazzo doesn't space the floor well enough to fit with Aaron Gordon.  Jamal Murray's on- and off-ball gravity really unlock Gordon's offense. Murray and Gordon screening for each other off-ball was killer because Jamal's a physical screen-setter and a shooting threat, and Gordon is big and strong enough that you can't switch Jamal's guy onto him.  My tin-foil theory about Campazzo is that our FO reached out to him assuming that we would put Monte Morris in a Jrue Holiday trade (and re-sign Grant), and didn't want to go back on their word when the trade fell through. Because he'd have been a nasty bench guard to run alongside either Murray or Jrue."
"Monte Morris is pretty good, he would've been in SMOY consideration had he stayed healthy. Can't really think of anyone else on the nuggets tho"
yeah that Monte Morris dude is good

Does Denver have anyone that can help Jokic punish Portland's PnR defense and expose Kanter?  To me, isoing Jokic against big bodies like Nurkic &amp; Kanter may not work, getting those guys moving &amp; into rotation and hitting the smaller Portland guards with screens seems like a recipe for success.     At face value it seems like Facu &amp; Austin Rivers won't have nearly enough to offset what Dame &amp; CJ can do, but maybe if Will Barton comes back they'll have a better shot.  The real X-factors will likely be whether or not Monte Morris can be healthy enough to give the Nuggets anything and how long Portland can survive with Anfernee Simons on the floor.  How do you feel about his development in general?  Do you think he's worth extending this summer?"
"True that’s what kept killing us. Those screens where deadly, because Dame could come off them and just hit something or you guys opened up space for a big to crash. Like one play either nurkic or kanter had Monte Morris on him in the lane.   I felt like your guys d did an amazing job of fighting through screens. Think it really bothered Mpj."
"Monte Morris attempted an Imanari Roll on CJ, and Murray was wondering how CJ was able to stuff it"
"Vince, I’m calling monte Morris  Monta Ellis as well. I Keep on fucking up."
monte Morris have it all
Kanter getting bullied by Monte Morris is not a great look lol.
Monte Morris has to be a top 5 underrated/under the radar guys in the league. He’s so nice
"People need to quit judging Melo based on started/star level standards. That's not who he is and that's not the role he plays here. Same with Kanter. These two are our 6th and 7th men. They have shortcomings but tey both have a positive VORP and league average (Melo) and above league average (Kanter) scoring efficiency. Kanter also has incredible offensive rebounding numbers that go a long way in offsetting his defense.   If you don't believe me, go look at other teams in the playoffs (outside really deep teams like the Jazz). How do their 6th and 7th men compare? Do Caruso and Horton-Tucker provide considerably more than those two? Monte Morris and Facundo Campazzo?"
"Also, ""high quality"" is a relative term. Melo is *not* a high quality starting player. But he's essentially co-6th/7th man with Kanter. So, he plays like a 	Monte Morris or Jalen Brunson level role. Compared to teams like the Jazz he doesn't compare, but compared to most teams 7th men he's solidly ""quality"". I should also add that he has a positive VORP and his highest TS% since 2016. He shoots us out of games sometimes but overall he helps us win."
"I mean if we're calling Ingles and Bojan shot creators then I don't think it's that hard to find another team with 5.    Nuggets have Jokic, MPJ, Murray, Barton, and Monte Morris for example"
Barton and Dozier are the last ones to return. We just got Monte Morris back last week.
"“Far superior cast?” That’s debatable. He went 10-2 without 2 of his starters in Murray and Barton. Monte Morris, their bench PG, and one of their best defenders in PJ Dozier weren’t available either. One of the teams he beat was a clippers team with both of their stars. Dame’s team has been healthy all throughout April and May, and he by no means has a weak roster. Your second point isn’t even true, Jokic leads the league in box +/- (by far, 11.7 compared to Curry’s 8.1), win shares, VORP, and PER."
"I misunderstood what you said actually. You said wouldn't there be 2 playmakers mb.  Ben will make us an extremely fast team and will run all the breaks. and he's surrounded by shooters in jokic, MPJ, and Monte Morris (assuming he starts) AG is also serviceable from 3 to not hurt spacing.  Wed also become a defensive nightmare."
Didnt just lose Jamal. Lost their starting two guard (barton) lost their backup to their two guard (dozier) lost their backup point guard  (monte morris).  Nugglife giveth and taketh a lot.
1.	Jokic 2.	Murray 3.	MPJ 4.	Monte Morris 5.	Gordon 6.	Facu 7.	Barton 8.	Nnaji
"Of course I watched it lol. It was one game, we’ll see what happens in the playoffs. The lakers don’t have magically 8 ppg better wing defenders than the average nba team. Sorry, but kuz and Morris aren’t elite defenders. We’ll see what happens, but I think Monte will be extremely important and mpj’s growth the last 2 months will show to be enough to at least make it within reach."
"Like i said in my other post, mpj. But also the mvp. And Monte mole, ideally. But the clippers (I think it was them?) absolutely claimed Mike and if we can’t screen for him effectively or drive and pop he can’t make space for himself, that’s when it’ll be hard. Joker can score by himself but if he’s doubled/tripled we need more than just mpj to be able to hit open looks consistently. I think Monte can do that and rivers has been doing better.   Essentially, if lebron covers mpj (I assume he will), we need to scheme him open, and if we can’t do that, we’re gonna need Monte Morris and Austin rivers to be as good as they can be, because joker will be doubled and someone other than mpj’s gonna be open, they just need to hit shots."
Facu is at the very least equal to Gary as far as perimeter defense. Idk if Gary ever reached the level Facu has displayed but Gary showed it over a larger sample and in bigger moments so he still gets some credit there.   The two midseason injury-replacement acquisitions were with defense in mind. Austin Rivers is serviceable on defense. Good for a bench guard. Shaq Harrison is a plus guard defender who offers almost nothing in offense in exchange.   PJ Dozier can defend 1-3 at a very high level. Whether he will be back and looking healthy on the court is a question mark though.   Monte Morris is serviceable but definitely has faults that Dame can exploit.   Nuggets guard defense has actually improved with all the injuries. They just lost almost all offensive production from those spots instead.
"Barton should hopefully be back during the first round.   Unfortunately, Dozier seems like he won’t be back before the second round, since his injury was estimated 3-6 weeks after the game he was injured.   There is also a deal with Monte Morris, who is still not fully healed"

I just think he's going to be an amazing 2nd unit Point Guard at this point like Monte Morris or Jalen Brunson
"Imagine Murray tore his ACL 13 games earlier. Now imagine Jokic missed the last 30 games. Now throw in 5 or so games where with both Jokic and Murray out, Monte Morris and Facu were also unable to play, leaving Austin Rivers as your only capable ball-handler.   That's about what the Lakers went through this year in terms of injuries/COVID.   If you truly believe what you say then you should have no problem with Denver winning tonight."
"Barton and monte morris (who hopefully will be making an appearance in the playoffs), dozier being injured also sucks"
Murray/barton/dozier and Monte Morris is still working himself back from a hamstring injury. And has to hop right Into playoff basketball. So 4/9 of the playoff rotation is either out or dealing with lingering injuries.  So literally the entire backcourt.   Again millsap has been a step slow defensively and was getting torched last postseason especially in the jazz series.   No lie warriors fans are the dumbest fan base. Bunch of nephews who constantly whine about shit they don’t even get. Like bro honestly you’ve been wrong on over half the shit you’ve said and continue to comment. Just give this shit up. You don’t know what your talking about and it’s getting more and more obvious with every passing comment.
"So many matchups I’m looking forward to in this one, just as a fan of the game. Ayton vs Jokic. Long bois Bridges and MPJ. Cam Payne and Monte Morris. Going to be a fun one."
The most? Probably Monte Morris with a shoutout to Austin Rivers
Monte Morris will become the new Murray. Every single one of Denver's shooters is significantly better than anyone we played on the Lakers except for Lebron
"&gt;Nah, this is recency bias. Jokic has been much more consistent and just as dominant.  You replied this under someone who said Kawhi is the best playoff performer so far.  &gt;Lastly, I never said Jokic is better than Kawhi but I guess I can’t expect someone that argues with emotions to see things without rose tinted glasses 🥴  ? So you said Kawhi isn't the best player in the playoffs but Jokic isn't better than Kawhi? Was the word you're looking for ""tied""? Clearly you're contradicting yourself there.  &gt;1) Jokic has a higher defensive rating than Kawhi this season (albeit, marginally). 2) Ignoring his final season with the SAS, which he barely played and was injured, Kawhi recorded his lowest Defensive Win Shares since his rookie season.  I just showed you stats that showed Kawhi has a lower defensive rtg than Jokic in the post season. Yet you said its higher (point 1). I have the proof (which I assumed you saw), so that's why I assumed you're talking about the regular season. If not, that's means you're using false statements.   &gt;Here’s some more facts since you don’t got any: Kawhi has the 3rd lowest defensive rating among all Clippers, only ahead of Pat Bev (whose been benched since game 2) and Marcus Morris.'  This is called taking stats too literally. Here's what I mean; using your argument, Jokic's offensive rtg is the 5th best on his own team, he's behind J Green, Marcus Howard, Monte Morris and Paul Millsap. Jokic's defensive rtg is 2nd worst on his own team, only Austin Rivers is worse than him.   These are facts but you want to know why I don't use them? Because that's taking them too literally. The more deeper in the stats you go, the more you have to consider the external factors. Stat analysis isn't your forte, because your same argument would mean Jokic isn't as important as Monte Morris. We all know Jokic is the best offensive player on his own team and likewise, Kawhi is the best offensive and defensive player on his own team.  &gt;Here’s some more facts since you don’t got any  [Nuggets Proof](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;TeamID=1610612743)  [Clippers Proof](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;TeamID=1610612746)  &gt;You don’t have any facts to corroborate anything you’re saying  I don't have facts? Idk how old you are but I'm going to assume you're old enough to know that in academia, when you say statements that aren't common knowledge, you have to cite your sources. I've provided my proof twice now and you haven't even mentioned where you get your stuff from.   Some are defensive anchors and some are better one on one. I used Gobert as an example of a defensive anchor and Kawhi as a one on one defender. Simmons is another example of a one on one defender, which is why Gobert's going to win DPOY again, because Simmons doesn't affect his team defense compared to Gobert's impact, even though Simmons is an elite defender. That's why I used two different types of defenders, but maybe putting Simmons in that arguement instead of Kawhi would have made it easier.  Using my supreme emotional rose tinted reasoning, I have countered almost every major point you made."
"I think there are 4 big storylines in the series   Joker vs Ayton,   Mikal Bridges vs Michael Porter Jr.  How healthy will CP3 be  can anyone on the Nuggets Stop (or slow down) booker  If you want a bonus storyline look to Cam Payne vs Monte Morris"
Jokic&gt;Murray&gt;MPJ&gt;Gordon&gt;Barton&gt;Morris  Absolutely not.  Monte over Kuzma 10/10
"Monte Morris is my choice. Impactful, big plays, helped the bench and closing games. All around stellar performance."
Monte Morris
Monte Morris. He played really well out of the bench. I am actually surprised since he has under preformed past 2 seasons in the playoffs so I am happy for him. People here saying MPJ didn't watch the games and just looked at the box store. He was so bad defensively that he negated all of the points he scored on offense. There is a reason we came back in game 6 without him on the floor
"Monte Morris. MPJ was great but, he was torched on the defensive end. When Monte got increased minutes, Monte changed that series."
"i love it when monte morris comes into the game, and basically takes over playmaking from jokic. just the transition from a shuffling jokic to a blazing morris is so comical to me"
"Next year WCF book it... Idk what version of Murray we getting next year tho, cos he will only hv a couple months on probably limited mins bef the play offs hit. He's a warrior n the heart of the team, so I'm sure hes gonna put all into his rehab, but expecting him to play like he did next post season is kinda much. Its the year after where he's gonna get back on his feet n continue to improve. Gd thing we got monte Morris hving a break out play off performance tho"
"Monte Morris? No turnovers, good free throw and 3 point shooter, not sure about his defense tbh"
"as much as i want you to take out the suns in vengeance, i dont see how you guys do it, they have an 'answer' to jokic in ayton, who while not the most mobile, was able to severly help limit ad's production. Only saving grace is that jokic is more effective as a playmaker and starts from the top of the key in playing.   However, who in the living fuck do you guys put on booker and paul? we had schroder and caruso and those motherfuckers got cooked.  caruso legit has a chance of making an all defense team this year. Who are the nuggets putting on them? monte morris?  My heart votes for the nuggets win, but my head tells me the suns are in the conference finals in 6"
Monte Morris is Diet Tony Parker
Monte Morris
"But his volume was still lower than Dames, both as a scorer and a passer.   Would you rather have had CJ or monte Morris this series? There's your answer for why we lost."
Also why are you lying? What do you mean jokic doesnr carry a larger offensive load? Jokic took 6 more shots this series than average and his usage rate went up by 6%.  Also monte morris averaged 15 in average efficiency. Last i checked 15 ppg in leage average TS% is not 20+ efficiently.
"Dame played great defense this series, outside of the first half of game 5. Like guess who was on MPJ after the first quarter? Dame. And he shot 1/5 after that 22 point quarter with Dame on him.  Dude, Dame runs off ball. But who is going to pass to him? CJ? Melo? RoCo? Powell? None of those guys pass. At all. The only one that ever set him up was Nurkic.  Who was lighting Dame up this series? Like seriously, who? Wasn't Austin Rivers. Wasn't Monte Morris."
"On significantly worse efficiency. Again dude, it's not that Jokic didn't play amazingly - he did. But the series came down to guys like Monte Morris stepping up and creating efficient shots for themselves.   Idk why you keep ignoring **that Dame got double as many assists**. That's Jokic's entire thing."
"Yeah dude, Jokic 100% outplayed Dame in 2019. I would never argue otherwise. Sometimes the best player in the series still loses.  Except Jokic didn't have to carry as large of load offensively in reality. That's just what we thought would have to happen. Dame scored more points himself and had created double as many points from assists, yet his team still lost. His team was much worse without him offensively than the Nuggets were without Jokic. And that's all because guys like Morris kept dropping 20+ efficiently off the bench.  Again, you're entirely basing things **off of what you thought was going to happen, as opposed to what actually happened**.   Raise your hand if you thought that Monte Morris, Facu, and Austin rivers would all be better than CJ through 6 games? No? Me neither. But they were. And that's why we lost."
"All I'm saying is that people should give Jokic's teammates a little more respect. He for sure makes a lot of space and elevates his team. He's a big guy who seems like he can do literally everything. However...  In the regular seasons Aaron Gordon, Austin Rivers, JaMychal Green, and Paul Millsap have been putting up similar numbers on different teams for years. MPJ was one of the top prospects in 2017 and a first round pick. Jamal Murray is already good. Will Barton's numbers shot up as soon as he joined the Nuggets, before Jokic even joined them.  It's harder to tell with Monte Morris, Facundo and Markus Howard because they've only ever played with Jokic but I assume he just makes them better when he's on the floor with them, so you could be right about them."
"Out of teams still in.  I think most underrated players ( looking at from an underrated importance to winning) I am going to go with guys like Monte Morris , Tim Hardaway Jr, etc.     Seems when those guys have good games and can put up around 20, they tend to win.  That third or so option is way important. Especially when the stars are resting and points have to come from other players.     When they ball out they win."
Monte Morris 3 years 27 million
Monte Morris
MPJ is great though. Monte Morris as well. You have a lot of talent on that team.
"judging me by my flair, eh?  I live in Portland, I watch the Blazers every night.  I watched every single second of this series.  Norm didn't guard MPJ exclusively, in fact he spent as much time on Monte Morris (who absolutely killed the Blazers) as he did elsewhere.  MPJ had 25, 18 &amp; 15 points in the first 3 games of the series before bottoming out in game 4, which was a blowout during which the Nuggets gave up a bit.  He then absolutely torched the Blazers during games 5 &amp; 6.  I think it took the Nuggets a bit to realize that getting Porter more shots was the key to the series, the Blazers had absolutely nobody to guard him.     And yes, he's small, which is exactly the same problem the Blazers already have with Dame &amp; CJ, so if that didn't work, why would Powell be any different?  The Blazers need a bigger guard in the back-court next to Dame, otherwise they'll continue to be a sieve on defense.  But go off king, why not just insult me personally some more since you're frustrated, that's a great way to show just how astute you are."
"No, but it’s fair to ask if we’ve unlocked Monte Morris. Dude was on fire the past few games. I’ve been wanting this for a few years now (Monte is my guy, only Jersey I have from the current squad), but look for Monte to be starting at PG when Murray comes back and Murray sliding to SG. When you finally see us run out the Jokic-MPJ-Gordon-Murray-Monte starting 5, that’s when we’ll see this team’s full powers."
"Try to look at it this way, the main media narrative is to say ""Jokic single handle is going to win the MVP"", ""Jokic doesn't have any help"", ""Look at the lineup Jokic just won playoff series with""   Now the coach, in effort to give a compliment to his best player, impulsively says a bunch of old guys who couldn't play in the NBA when they were young men, can don a jersey as middle aged men and be competitive as long as they have Jokic.    It feeds into the narrative of minimizing the contributions of Jokic teammates. Clearly he knew as soon as he said it, it's not a good narrative to push out there. It wasn't just Jokic hitting three pointers on the road late in the game (Austin Rivers) or point guards coming off the bench stepping up to score 28 points and 22 points (Monte Morris). Many of his players are guys working hard to establish a reputation as belonging in the league. (Campazzo, Morris, Rivers, JaMychal Green, Markus Howard). Their playoff run doesn't happen nor continue without consistent benefaction from those players.  Malone's comments should be cognizant of the hard work contributions of those players to push back on the narrative to champion their cause. Malone wouldn't like it much if a player used the old Jerry Jones line during their 90s Super Bowl run, ""anybody can coach this team"".    Clearly you're a big fan of the team. Famdom doesn't give accessible  privilege of insider access to private conversations or thoughts. It's also impossible to summarize how every coach in the league is viewed unfiltered by their players where you can garner a ranking system to determine ""the most love in the locker room of any team"""
Based off one half ?  I guess Monte Morris is an MVP candidate then lol
"Moving the goalpost much? I thought he was being this amazing playmaker, setting everyone up. And that Dame lost because he didn't  But in reality, the Denver role players made their own plays and hit shots. And the Blazers players neither made plays nor hit shots.   We lost because Austin Rivers and Monte Morris were both better than CJ, and that's not on Dame. Monte was out there creating all his own looks and drilling 3s late in the game off the dribble. CJ was stepping out of bounds on open 3s"
this monte morris dude looks so good too
"It did work though. Just only when Nurkic was on the court.   If anyone other than Dame had stepped up anyways, the series would be pretty different. Like everyone but Dame just flat out played terribly for the majority of the series.   Monte Morris was out here outplaying CJ McCollum, with the majority of his shots being self created"
"Just tell me you don't know what you're talking about lmao  1) So we hid Dame by putting him on the hottest player on either team? The guy that dropped 22 in the 1st quarter?  2) Who was on Austin Rivers this series all those times he went off? Who was on monte morris going under screens in the 4th quarter and getting burned? It wasn't Dame  3) That DRTG argument shows you have zero clue what went on with the blazers this year. CJ and Nurkic both missed a 30 game stretch together. I wonder if Dames DRTG was worse because he had to play with Kanter as his starter center for 30 games and CJ didn't  But hey, that's context that takes actually watching the game"
"Blazers forced Jokic to become more of a scorer in this series and it didn't work, also the role players stepped up big the last couple of games guys like Monte Morris and Austin Rivers come to mind. CJ was disappointing. He was great in 2019 when they beat the nuggets in that series but  couldn't replicate a similar performance here."
"Monte Morris, Georges Niang, Matt Thomas, Abdel Nader, Talen Horten Tucker and Tyrese Haliburton."
No love for MPJ and Gordon? And Monte Morris is a good player.

Dame for Monte Morris confirmed
ALL MY HOMIES LOVE MONTE MORRIS!!!
"Monte Morris, Dorian Finney-Smith, and Lu Dort are the top 3 contracts in the league imo"
"As a Blazers fan, the Nuggets are better than you think. Even without Murray, what Jokic does for them offensively is unreal. MPJ, Rivers, Monte Morris, and that Campazzo guy can play, no cap. They have weapons.  Not to mention they beat a good team with a superstar in six games."
where the hell monte morris come from man he’s legit! did you guys expect him to show out the way he did? i can’t believe i never heard of him
Cj should give half his salary to dame for carrying his ass for so many years. He played worse than monte Morris and Austin rivers the whole series
I watched the whole game and it felt like Monte Morris didn't even contribute as much as he did. 22 and 9 is a great line
Yesss. More Monte Morris minutes
"Ya I know. But in their place the other guys played really well. MPJ 10-19 with 6 three pointers, and 8-16 and 9 assists from Monte Morris. JaMychal Green didn't shoot the ball a lot but he was +22 for them! If they had Murray playing those 23 minutes instead of Facundo I wonder what damage they could do but what they're doing right now isn't bad at all. They've got depth"
His teammates are just so bad.. the dropoff to the second best player is so off. Cj is getting paid like an all star but playing worse than monte Morris or Austin rovers
Monte Morris is gonna be a starter next season   Murray/Morris/AG/MPJ/Jokic is FILTHY
"It's the Luka shot. from that one game-winner  Also  Death, taxes, and Monte Morris at the end of quarters"
Monte Morris is better than Dennis Schroeder
Monte Morris is best Morris.
If Monte Morris can keep playing anywhere near the level he did in this game they should have a legitimate shot.
"Damian Lillard... what a great player. Shame Portland couldn't really put the best pieces around him.  Nikola Jokic showed why he's MVP. 36/8/6 in a close-out game, and his teammates stepped up hitting big shots like MPJ (who kept them in the game in the 1st), Monte Morris (who hit the shot to end the 3rd) and Austin Rivers and Aaron Gordon (who hit key 3s to put the game out of reach)."
"But fr their GM is a legend. Jamal Murray was a solid pick but not a wild one, the MPJ (and Bol Bol) picks were both home run swings and one is already paying off! And to get both Jokic (the MVP) and Monte Morris in the 2nd round is insane - like what are all the other GMs doing?"
Monte Morris is a certified baller. Dude was everywhere this series.
"Monte Morris and Austin Rivers burned this dude, he’s gotta be better"
Monte Morris is the unsung hero tonight. Made big plays when the blazers were falling apart.
What team in the NBA wouldn't want Monte Morris on his current contract? Crazy value for the cap space
JaMychal Green was such a big pickup for the Nuggets. And Monte Morris is so steady. I hope Portland can get Dame some help.
Can’t cry about the refs when Monte Morris outperformed dame + CJ in the 4th.
Monte Morris is the most underrated player in the game right now.
"People were donwnvoting me after Game 5, but I will say it again. This Portland team needs to blow it up, you were outplayed by a team with a guard rotation of Austin Rivers playing 40 minutes, Compazzo, Monte Morris and Markus Howard. This starts with CJ he under no circumstances can be on the team next year if they expect to ever do anything with Dame. It’s not 2019 anymore."
Jokic is just too good. Monte Morris was good too.
Jokic is just too good. Monte Morris was good too.
"Fun fact - Monte Morris is going to make $28 million the next 3 years, CJ is going to make $100 million the next 3 years"
Monte Morris is making himself a ton if money
Monte Morris &gt; CJ McCollum
monte money morris have it all
Monte Morris is too good
Monte Morris has outplayed both dame and cj so far in the 4th lmfao
"I’m honestly not mad. We have the better roster and the Nuggets started Compazzo and played Austin Rivers, Monte Morris and Jamychal Green big minutes and we lost. Stotts is ass, Jokic is amazing and CJ gone! Excited to see what moves the Blazers management can pull out they ass."
Monte Morris is a fucking boss.
Rivers and monte Morris killing it this series
Get it jumpin like monte Morris
Monte Morris earning himself a pay day
How has Monte Morris been the far better player than McCollum in multiple games this series
When did Monte Morris become Dame Lillard??? 💪
Damn Monte Morris is good
Monte Morris is such a stud. I been said he’s Denver’s VanVleet.
Monte Morris is taking over
&gt; Who the hell is Monte Morris  The best backup PG in the league.
Who the hell is Monte Morris and how come I never heard of this guy
where would jokic be without monte morris
Who the fuck is monte Morris?? this guy looks like he was born to fuck
Why does Monte Morris show up at the most inconvenient times for the opponent I stg
But with monte morris they are favorites
"Monte ""Ellis"" Morris"
If LeBron got Monte Morris to do a DNA comparison test he would find one of Monte's uncle is his (LeBron's) father
Could Monte Morris just fuck off for just one playoff game please?
Monte Morris only makes 1.7 million what a steal
Monte Morris is a real gym rat
Monte Morris saved Malone there. He should have subbed Jokic back 2 mins earlier. Blazers missed a chance to make it 8 points lead
I will fight with anyone who dares argue that there’s a backup PG better than Monte Morris‼️
I wish the Lakers had someone like Monte Morris to make these late game shots
Good lawd who’s this monte Morris guy and how many years has he been in the league for now
Monte Morris game
Monte Morris outplaying Dame...
Monte Morris the Blazer slayer
Monte motherfucking Morris!!!!!
Monte Steph Curry Morris
#MONTE MORRIS
Holy shit Monte Morris 👀
MONTE MORRIS MY GOD
Monte Morris is literally MJ against us
"Can’t stand CJ man, so bad close to the basket, gimme Monte Morris every time"
When did Monte Morris get so clutch?
MONTE. MORRIS.
Monte Morris &gt; CJ McCollum
"Monte Morris looks like LeBron if LeBron was 6'0"" and wasn't going bald"
"What is Portland doing?? Portland should be trapping players from taking buzzer beaters in a do or die game lol, Monte Morris got a ridiculous shot in but he was still very open."
Monte is by far the best Morris triplet
"But seriously, Portland should be trapping players from taking buzzer beaters in a do or die game lol, Monte Morris got a ridiculous shot in but he was still very open."
Lol Monte Morris going off on us this series is so typical. Hopefully CJ shows up so he can inflate his trade value and we get a 3&amp;D SG and a competent forward.
What a big shot by Monte Morris lmao
MONTE MORRIS!
Wow Monte Morris
Blazers fans hate Monte Morris lol
How is Monte Morris this good?
Wait did Kenny call Monte Morris by Ellis?
"Monte Morris looks like a mumble rapper, I can’t explain it"
Monte Morris looks like mini lebron
Crazy that the nuggets have a Monte Morris - Austin Rivers backcourt and it can work
"I'd rather have Monte Morris over Schroeder, and Morris just signed for 3/28."
"Lakers: missed LeBron, AD, and Shroder for significant time.  Clippers: missed PG and Kawhi for a combined 38 games, before including 31 missed from Ibaka, 35 from Pat Bev, 15 from Marcus Morris Sr. etc.  Nuggets: Murray missed 24 games, Monte Morris missed 25, Dozier missed 22, Millsap missed 15, MPJ missed 11.  The only guys who DIDNT miss double digit games are Jokic.  Lastly, Blazers: Nurk missed 35 games, CJ McCollum missed 25.  Besides Dame, those are practically their only relevant players.  Glad you can talk shit in a 5+ month old deleted thread, when you didn't even comment on it initially.  Real impressive"
"Some of that is variance, sure. But you also go against better defenses in the playoffs  It mostly comes down to the fact that CJ has been outplayed by Austin Rivers and Monte Morris over 5 games lol. That's the series right now"
Monte Morris Aka CJs father
"We have Marcus, Markeiff and Monte Morris all in the NBA  we can almost form a full starting lineup of M. Morrises, the dream"
"Y'all acting like Millsap and Monte Morris didn't both blow wide open layups... Both teams blew some chances, it happens."
"I like this list and I would add Mikal Bridges, Joe Harris, Monte Morris, and PJ Washington"
"Monte Morris, De’Anthony Melton, and TJ McConnell. I like the small guards if you haven’t noticed."
"Ehh PP is already 23 and has some serious physical limitations. Obviously Kemba came into the league at like 21 and is also undersized, but his development into an All-Star was a real anomaly.  Realistically I see Pritchard as a Jalen Brunson, Monte Morris type player. Borderline starter, every team in the league would love to have them, but no one is throwing assets to trade for them, or offer a huge contract."
"He was pretty good against Monte Morris at the point of attack, I thought.  Got over the screen quickly and Monte was just not getting any separation."
"Monte Morris really fucka up here. One thing is that he misses the FT, but after the make he's ""down on the ground"" - but it's fucking tied!! He should have gotten the ball in real fucking fast, instead he was smiling and gave Portland the chance to set their defense. Extremely poor play and unawareness."
"Every time Monte Morris touches the ball, I know he's going to make the right decision. What a smart player, best bench point guard in the league and it is not even close."
Monte Morris denied him when he missed that point blank layup off the dribble hand off.
"So?  Folks ain't ever missed shots before?  Monte Morris blew a wide open layup and moments before that Paul Millsap also bricked an uncontested layup.  Then Monte Morris decided to miss a FREE THROW that would have ended the game.  So I don't know what you are on about.  Players miss shots, it happens.  If we are going to sit and compare the level of easily bricked shots, Monte and Paul's were easier than Covington's CONTESTED dunk which is the only reason he missed it."
Monte Morris will break it next game.
Monte Morris can’t make clutch FT’s
Yup! Remember how we won game 3? With Jokic getting the rebound and tip-in off a Monte Morris choked free throw? Better take him out on that final free throw of OT though! ...Fucking hell.
"CJ is supposed to be good, but then gets outplayed by Monte Morris. You're probably right though."
"Facu is an undrafted rookie averaging 6 points a game on the season, and Austin Rivers is the starting 2, who had been an unsigned free agent until a few weeks ago.  First off the bench is Monte Morris, 2nd round pick who is admittedly a solid guard, and Markus Howard, an undrafted rookie who is really not good by any metric.  That backcourt is also tiny as fuck.    The fact that our backcourt is responsible for winning two playoff games against y'all isn't really an indication that they are objectively better.  Lillard and CJ and Norm and Simons is 100% the better backcourt and guard rotation.  It's not even fucking close.  The fact that we have outplayed your backcourt twice is a strike against y'all, not really a point in our favor if we're talking straight talent."
Yeah and Dame lost to Monte Morris tonight so his performance means nothing either
"It does help when your teammates are also contributing. Dame had nothing left to give and when the magic ran out, so did the Blazers chance of winning. Monte Morris was huge."
Monte Morris is the best backup point guard in the league.
"I know, Monte Morris went GOAT mode tonight.   (For real though, a couple of usually no names on the Nugs stepped up big, like Austin Rivers and Monte Morris.)"
is it just me or monte morris looked like lebron? lol even the wrinkles
"Absolutely. I damn near stopped watching, I was ready to go to bed cause the game felt totally spoiled. Fortunately Denver made a quick run that made me think “At least they’ll still win” and then Dame did Dame things and Monte Morris forgot how to shoot layups, and it was game on all over again. Incredible performance by Dame. His teammates ought to be fired into the sun though, Stotts included. RoCo left more flat tires out there than I have spares"
lillard’s best teammate this game was monte morris in the 4th and OT
Monte Morris played like CJ McCollum tonight
Monte Morris popping out a career high in points to help handle the Lillard attack
"In a game that went to 2OT, CJ was out scored by Monte Morris and had the same amount of points as Austin Rivers and didn’t even reach 20. Simply unacceptable. Put him on the trade block on the plane back"
"I am a blazers fan and I am heartbroken, CJ is trash this game trade his ass quick, he gave up points to a bum called monte morris and chocked on offense, I like CJ and this is defo reactionary but I don't wanna watch him play right now"
Monte Morris looks like Lebron's kid
If my life was on the line I would take Dame shooting a 40 ft contested 3 over an open Monte Morris layup
Monte Morris gotta be sick right now
"Monte Morris blows layup then misses the 2nd free throw, he’s forsure playing for the Blazers 😂"
Austin rivers should’ve passed it to Monte Morris but it’s a shoulda coulda woulda situation
Fuck pff Monte Morris
"Lillard hitting great shots, but Monte Morris missing stupid shots has kept Portland in this."
"Monte Morris is going to lose sleep on that layup miss, jeeeeez"
"idk but maybe they were chanting ""mo"" for monte morris?"
"So is Monte Morris actually the real deal Nugs fans? If so, y’all gonna be such a problem when Jamal back."
"Monte ""I'm Jamal Murray now"" Morris"
Monte Morris is clutch as fuck
"Damn, I didn’t expect Monte Morris to significantly outplay CJ McCollum"
Death by Monte Morris
"Monte ""Ellis"" Morris"
Monte Morris doesn't need two attempts to be clutch
Monte Morris
Monte is the best Morris in the league
MONTE MORRIS HAS IT ALL
Monte Morris looking like Blue Arrow
Monte Morris has balled the fuck out.
MONTE MORRIS!!!
Monte Morris going crazy
Monte Morris has been huge this game.
Also apparently I hate Monte Morris now too
Does Monte Morris look like a mini lebron or is it just me
Cold free throws by the ever reliable Monte Morris 😏
Monte Morris better not have a repeat of game 3
"Monte ""best backup PG"" Morris chose the best game to turn up"
"I can’t believe the Blazers are struggling against a team starting Campazzo and playing Austin Rivers, Jamychal Green, Monte Morris and Markus Howard big minutes."
"Am I the only one who thinks Monte Morris looks kinda like a skinny LeBron?  (In looks, not play)"
This guy didn’t watch monte Morris in college
Post here if you have guts. Block was fair  However block On Monte Morris was not.   You can thanks referees for this situation you are in. They help you get back into game.
Monte Morris is my favorite backup pg. He’s smooth as hell
"I was at that game, sitting right by under the other basket.  That was a BOMB he threw.  That was the game Jamal Murray tried to score 50 as time was running out.    In context Coach Malone was SCREAMING at him not to shoot it and he still did.  The possession before Monte Morris got a rebound and was going to dribble up the court and run time and Murray was yelling him to ""PASS THE FUCKING BALL."""
"Yeah the thing with murray is that he and jokic have crazy chemistry in the 2 man game. It was crucial in the bubble playoffs and if mpj develops more it will make it that much harder to gaurd. The other thing with murray is his competitiveness and clutch gene are super valuable. Any trade involving murray and picks would have to be too good to turn down, I think jokic would be pretty upset if murray was traded tbh, also the injury complicates the whole picture even more.   They'll definitely have to get creative, use the MLE and try to get guys on rookie deals too. I think nnaji has potential to be a really solid role player. As for millsap I love the dude, and would be happy to keep him around in a udonis haslem type role, but I am excited to move on from him playing significant mins. We've paid him 40 mil the last 2 years so I think we've done right by him. I'm glad we locked up monte Morris too.   I think they'll have a better plan this coming free agency, I think they were caught off gaurd by Grant leaving and had to scramble to piece things together."
Think he’s a step above Monte Morris money at 9m  Jordan clarkson money is pretty fair   Less than fvv  13-20m probably on the lesser side of that
"I’d say 8-10 mil. I like him, but anything over is an overpay. He would be a good spark off the bench for many teams. I’d give him something similar to what monte morris got."
"Ayton is the top of the list FOR SURE  Booker Trae and Ja are 100% showing up in their first playoff games so they’re looking good  Tatum and Luka are already high but they’re playing insane ball so they have to be on the list   Cameron Payne  Monte Morris  Dillon Brooks  Thybulle   Everyone on the Blazers, specifically Nurkic though. Yes Jokic is feasting but honestly how can you stop him lol. It’s just impressive that they’ve managed to hold him at 5 or less assists each game (2x 1 assist, 2x 5 assists)  Everyone on the Hawks  Hate on me all you want but Paul George is DOING IT. Make all the Playoff P jokes, but he’s balling tf out  I’ve always been SUPER high on Jrue but no one can say shit about him after this series  Andre Drummond made this really weird IQ jump after the first game of the series so why not   Caruso is proving that he’s what Patrick Beverley pretends to be"
"You're being *extremely* kind to Kanter lol. Obviously the offense will usually be better and we won't score zero, but we still conceded a great look every time down with him on the floor.   Plus you're not even looking at the plays where he royally fucked up, but you just didn't score. For example, Dame made a great steal during that sequence  on what would've been a wide open Jokic layup after Kanter got completely beat on a basic cut.   The main difference is that Nurkic knows where to be and when to be there. Kanter doesn't on either end and it throws everyone off. His defense is erratic and changes from play to play and guys have no idea what he's doing which makes rotations difficult.   &gt;Jokic gets people with his pump. Happens.  But Nurkic has done a great job containing that action  &gt;CJ is at fault for getting blown by on the perimeter.  It's a pick and roll play in drop coverage and Kanter was in no man's land. Morris turned down the pick. Kanter was too low to take away the pull up if he accepts the screen, but was too high to actually take away the layup. He's supposed to cut off the drive there and at worst give up a mismatch on a switch  &gt;Dame turns the ball over Monte hits a transition 3. Kanter not involved.  A turnover that happened because of a miscommunication between Dame and guess who? Kanter lmao. Dame thought Kanter would slip because he was trapped in the corner but with a wide open gap for the pass, but Kanter tried to rescreen. I don't know which one of them messed up, but it was a bad turnover that we haven't seen with Dame and Nurk PnR.  &gt;Jokic scores rolling after getting switched on Melo. Kanter not involved guarding J Mike on the strong side corner.  Dude Kanter let him stroll to the rim lmao. We aren't supposed to switch to begin with, but you're the center. You play help defense there and let Melo run to the corner. That's basic coverage.    &gt;J Mike gets an offensive put back.  Kanter bleed ORBs...remember him coming back in the 3rd only to give up one, then immediately **flagrant** foul Jokic lmao?  &gt;Monte runs a pick and pop at Kanter. Dame gets caught on the screen, Kanter drops to contain and J Mike hits an open 3. Mostly ok defence by Kanter there. Dame completely dies on the screen not much Kanter could do.  Dame recovered and Kanter was late to get back to his man. He's still standing at the FT line with Dame in front of Monte again.    At the end of the day, Kanter is just soooooo fucking slow to react to everything. He doesn't see what's happening until after it already has. That's why on plays like that he concedes a wide open 3, whereas Nurkic sees that there's other help over there, Monte is pulling back, and that Dame will be able to recover...so he goes back to his man.  It's little shit like that. Every play is just a step slow."
Theres a monte morris too?   We can almost field an entire nba team of M. Morrises
heck ya man and fuck you and monte morris!!
"What, you don't like times when Monte Morris and Shaq Harrison are the two best players on the court?"
"I'm a big Monte Morris fan, but he's not an MVP yet"
No lol i cheered whenever kanter entered the court. Roco only got roasted by jokic but kanter got posted off by monte fucking morris
"Thank you Monte Morris, very cool."
Monte Morris just casually showing everyone his ass.
Monte Morris is having a terrible game
"Campazzo would be good to have for like 4 minute stretches, but he is outclassed on too many levels.  Monte Morris need to be out there way more than him, by a 3:1 minute ratio at the bare minimum"
Monte Morris gotta fix up
&gt; Denver entered the season with one of the deeper guard rotations in the NBA. &gt;  &gt; PG: Jamal Murray / Monte Morris / Facu Campazzo / Markus Howard &gt;  &gt; SG: Gary Harris / Will Barton / PJ Dozier / RJ Hampton  Dude read even just the first few sentences
"Text from the article:  As the bus carrying the melancholy Denver Nuggets rolled down Highway 101 toward San Francisco International Airport on that Tuesday morning in April, Jamal Murray sat in a seat with his left leg propped up, wiping tears from his eyes.  Across the aisle was his head coach, Michael Malone, and an impromptu therapy session began.  The night before, Murray's left knee had buckled after he'd planted on a drive toward the basket. Malone was at his side on the ground within seconds, waving for help from the medical staff. Later, inside the locker room at Chase Center, Malone was there when the Golden State Warriors team doctors informed him of their diagnosis: torn ACL.  ""Jamal was grasping the enormity of the situation and was asking himself all those questions. Will he recover? Will he ever be the same?"" Malone says. ""What I've learned in my years in basketball and what I've tried to bring to our team for the last six years is that when you face adversity, you cannot run.""  Malone has become known for a few things during what is now a two-decade-long NBA career. One is for his intensity, whether it is dealing with officials, opponents or even his own team when it's time to demand accountability. Google ""Michael Malone rant"" and there are plenty of results from meltdowns about his players' defense to the NBA's rules on letting families into the bubble last year to the LeBron James-Michael Jordan debate.  Though he has a good sense of humor and a New Yorker's sensibility and sarcasm, when Malone is upset, he sets his jaw and digs in emotionally and with his work ethic. When things aren't going right, he has been known to barricade himself in his hotel room or office and plow through the process to figure it out.  Malone's tenure in Denver has been marked by his ability to do just that. Like what he did on the bus that day in San Francisco. And what he did at the first team meeting after Murray's injury was confirmed by an MRI: leading his team through turmoil, something the now veteran coach is making a trademark.  ""I came into the meeting with Jamal's stats and I read them off. All the points, assists, 3-pointers. I wanted everyone to know exactly what we were going to be missing,"" Malone says. ""That 24 hours was very emotional for all of us. But I needed to let the guys know that none of them were expected to be Jamal. They didn't have to play outside themselves. But what they had to do was be positive. To have good body language. To believe in themselves and their teammates. That is what good teams do.""   It was the same type of resilience the Nuggets displayed last year in Orlando, Florida, where they twice came back from a 3-1 series deficit to win and reach the West finals.  ""This team's resiliency is a direct reflection of Mo,"" Nuggets team president Tim Connelly says, calling Malone by his nickname. ""We've haven't had many losing streaks in the last six years. We've responded well to tough times. A lot of credit goes to him.""  Malone is at it again, trying to chart a path for the Nuggets to get through their opening-round series with the Portland Trail Blazers. The injuries in the backcourt -- in addition to Murray, the Nuggets were down Monte Morris (who has since returned), Will Barton and PJ Dozier -- have left him starting 30-year-old rookie Facundo Campazzo and Austin Rivers, who just a few weeks ago was signed by the team on a 10-day contract.  ""Stay positive,"" Malone says, almost as an instruction to himself. ""We are consistent with that. We do that every day no matter who is out there.""  Malone is quick to credit his players, especially Jokic, for the team's ability to follow that mantra over the past two seasons. But while Malone hasn't gotten the attention as other successful coaches have -- the Nuggets have a .625 winning percentage over the past four seasons and are trying to advance in the playoffs for the third consecutive season -- his team has developed a reputation that he has spearheaded.  His career has been highlighted by working with superstars early in their careers. Malone was with LeBron James in Cleveland for five years as an assistant and was part of the effort that transformed James into a willing defensive player. He was the lead assistant in Golden State when Stephen Curry took the leap between 2011 and 2013, overcoming ankle injuries to morph into one of the league's greatest offensive weapons of all time.  And he has been with Jokic since day one, overseeing his development into what will likely be the third MVP whom Malone has impacted.  ""When Nikola was at his first summer league with us, there wasn't one person in our group who thought he'd be an NBA starter,"" Malone says. ""But with LeBron and Steph, you see they have great basketball IQ and they have a great work ethic. Their IQ is off the charts. That's what you also see with Nikola.""  Malone acutely remembers flying home from Dallas after getting blown out in early in the 2016-17 season and talking himself into building the team around Jokic, whom he had been trying to shoehorn into the lineup next to fellow big man Jusuf Nurkic. Within weeks, Nurkic was traded and the team's turnaround began.   Four years later, the turnaround looked to be nearing its apex. After a March trade for Aaron Gordon gave Malone defensive versatility he hadn't had in the past and unlocked a leap for Michael Porter Jr. on offense, the Nuggets promptly went on an eight-game winning streak, looking every bit like bona fide title contenders.  But the Murray injury lowered their ceiling and possibly set that dream back -- and not just this season, as Murray is likely to miss much of next year. And with just one year left on Gordon's contract, it's unclear when or even if the Nuggets will ever get to see what that collection of players could become.  ""No excuses -- that's what we believe,"" Malone says. ""And that's why I'm so proud of this team."""
Isn’t Denver the only team with two 5’10 point guards? With 6’2 and 6’3 Monte Morris and Austin Rivers at SG
"Yeah, this argument works if the difference is 5 assists to 6 assists. But 7.2 was top 15 in the league, and over double that of Morris. That argument does not work when the disparity is that high. That's like saying Marcus Smart is better than Chris Paul because numbers aren't everything - you have to then back that up with other evidence.  But let's dig into the evidence - beyond just counting stats. If Morris is better beyond the box score, his advanced stats should reflect that, right?  Payton 19/20 LEBRON: 2.04  Morris 20/21 LEBRON: -0.75  Payton 19/20 Wins Added: 3.6  Morris 20/21 Wins Added: 1.3  Payton 19/20 RAPTOR WAR: 2.5  Morris 20/21 RAPTOR WAR: 1.8  Payton 19/20 VORP: 0.6  Morris 20/21 VORP: 0.4  Payton also led in BPM, WS, etc. I literally could not find an advanced stat that did not significantly favour Elfrid Payton over Monte Morris. All the evidence indicates Payton is a decent NBA player who has been put in a bad situation as a starter on a playoff squad with reduced minutes when he should be a sixth man (I will admit it is also a likely factor that he's struggling/having a genuinely bad season). All the evidence also suggests that Morris is a league average bench player who would probably suffer a worse statistical fate in Payton's situation."
