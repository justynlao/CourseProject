"Last offseason NOP S&amp;T'd Kenrich Williams, Zylan Cheatham, and Josh Gray in the Steven Adams OKC trade."
"For some perspective, this is what the roster of the Iowa Wolves, a team with the worst record in the G-league last season, consisted of:  -Zylan Cheatham- 1st team all pac 12  -Canyon Barry- SEC 6th Man of the Year  -Jordan McLaughlin- 1st team all pac 12  -Jordan Murphy- 1st team all big 10  -Allonzo Trier- 1st team all pac 12  -Isiah Briscoe- Averaged 12/5/4 while being a starter for an Elite 8 Kentucky team  Heres the Salt Lake City Stars, the 2nd worst team in the G-League last season:  -Trevon Blueitt: consensus all-American in college  -Jarrell Brantley- 1st team all-CAA  -Trent Forrest- 2nd team all-ACC  -Trevon Scott- 1st team all-AAC, AAC DPOY  -Malcolm Miller- 2nd team all-Patriot League  And these guys have all gotten better with years of training and experience since they earned these college accolades.   The top couple of guys in college are better than the top couple of guys in the G-league but top-to-bottom it just doesnt compare. You aint getting to the G-League if you arent a pretty damn good college player"
"You can…https://twitter.com/ericpincus/status/1418340159318224902?s=21  “teams CAN S&amp;T more than one player together to aggregate salary. Example: New Orleans sent Zylan Cheatham (S&amp;T, Josh Gray (S&amp;T), Kenrich Williams (S&amp;T), Darius Miller (under contract at the time) to OKC for Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe”"
"Jrue was not sign and traded. Kenrich Williams, Zylan Cheatham, and Josh Gray were part of the same trade and all sign and traded"
"&gt;I thought the Jrue trade was great.   It would have been if it had just been that straight up, but he made it instantly worse by folding in the Steven Adams deal along with it (especially since he was already taking back a negative contract in Bledsoe).   Here is what the actual trade wound up being from the Pels side:  * **Out:** Jrue Holiday, Sam Merrill, Zylan Cheatham, Joshia Gray, Darius Miller, Kenrich Williams, a 2023 2nd round draft pick and a 2024 2nd round draft pick   * **In:** Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams, Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 1st round picks, and swap rights on Milwaukee's 2024 &amp; 2026 1sts, which most likely won't be used (and now New Orleans has had to send out one of the picks they got from the Lakers in the AD trade just to get rid of Adams and Bledsoe)  So basically they traded Jrue, two 2nds and a bunch of random players and got back two late 1st round picks and two negative value contracts they had to attach a pick to to unload. That's not very good in the aggregate."
