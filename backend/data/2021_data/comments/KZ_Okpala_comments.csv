"I looked up KZ Okpala the other day and Wikipedia had this:  &gt; In 2021, Maxwell Stone rated him as the 97th Greatest Basketball Player of All time, directly behind Andre Drummond in his all time rankings."
"I didn‚Äôt watch the game. How on earth did KZ Okpala start at SF, play 3 minutes and be a -12?"
Where tf is KZ Okpala?
"If it makes you feel better, when we play you tomorrow we are gonna be without Bam, Jimmy, Goran, Avery Bradley, Kendrick Nunn, KZ Okpala, Mo Harkless, and Haslem.  Battle of the decimated.  Our game on thursday with y‚Äôall is on TNT üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
"The Miami Heat have added these players to the OUT/Health and Safety Protocols list, following the completion of contact tracing:  Jimmy Butler  Goran Dragic  Kendrick Nunn  Bam Adebayo  Moe Harkless  Udonis Haslem  KZ Okpala  This is in addition to Avery Bradley, on the list Sunday.  ADDITIONALLY: Meyers Leonard (shoulder) is questionable, Kelly Olynyk (groin) is probable and Gabe Vincent (knee) is probable."

"We‚Äôre planning on incorporating KZ Okpala, who the heat are really high on, into the rotation"
"GSW should trade Steph to the Heat for him a chance to compete for a championship again  We‚Äôll send you Nunn, Olynik and KZ Okpala"
"We have a lot of team options for next season adding up to around 50 mill plus. The only contracts we have on the books are Jimmy, Bam with his new extension, Tyler who is still on his rookie, and KZ Okpala. Realistically, we‚Äôre going to re-sign Dragic to his 19.4 million, Duncan, and Nunn to extensions around 4 million, so we‚Äôll probably have somewhere between 20-25 million in cap space"
"When Herro comes back and the Heat don't have to give Gabe Vincent or KZ Okpala extensive minutes, the Heat are going ro be scary."
&gt; KZ Okpala  Okpala sounds like a Mortal Kombat character.
"For some reason I always think KZ Okpala should be like 6'2"" and Gabe Vincent should be like 6'9"". I don't know why, just something about their names"
Miami's development org can make a role player out of anybody.  Excited to see what the future holds for KZ Okpala.
KZ Okpala. Definitely a project player. Mostly filler but maybe Raptors think they can do something with him. You'd get Iggy and Olynyk too to match salary of course. And if you wanted Nunn
olynyk would be replaced by meyers bc salary filler but yeah it would have been harden-bradley-jimmy-bam-meyers with dragic-gabe vincent-kz okpala-chris silva + buyouts off the bench  i think pat riley underestimated the free agency pull of ring chasing as well as harden's superhuman ability to carry teams but i understand why he didn't do it at the time
"sadly I think they'd have to give up KZ Okpala, but not a thing more than that"
"KZ ""Wing Scorers' Dream Matchup"" Okpala"
KZ Okpala carrying this team right now üî•
"What‚Äôs crazy is that you actually have KZ Okpala too, who is also Nigerian."
"Best I can do is Kendrick Nun and KZ Okpala, and even then you‚Äôve got me over a barrel here."
"Y‚Äôall always get hit the hardest on just pure injuries (though Warriors probably have that title this year), idk what the fuck y‚Äôall have done to deserve it.  I think we might be one of the most fucked over teams when you combine the injuries with Covid cases this year. Shit, even as of recently, KZ Okpala had started getting actual minutes for us and was performing alright and then got stuck in protocol (might have even been positive) for like 3 weeks and only just got back on the floor tonight. All his momentum, just gone."
Lord no lol. If that were the case we‚Äôd have a KZ Okpala vote instead of a Derrick Rose vote.
"Ok, let's get a fan vote for KZ Okpala next season!"
"For Miami idk if it‚Äôs even possible for us to put together a good package without including Bam.. that being said Bam is untouchable, I‚Äôll ship Jimmy out before I ship a hair on Bam‚Äôs buttcheek. So realistically we can give Herro, Precious Achiuwa, KZ Okpala, picks, maybe sign and trade of Duncan Robinson if possible..   The end goal is to have Dame with Jimmy and Bam.. We‚Äôll fill out the rest of the roster with Max Strus and some G Leaguers"
"No it wouldn‚Äôt, stop making shit up. Heat had nothing to offer that was nearly as good as the Nets package  *‚ÄùBut the Rockets want more. Even if the Heat offered Herro, Robinson, Precious Achiuwa, KZ Okpala, Iguodala, Olynyk and first-round picks in 2025 and 2027, I‚Äôm not sure that would be enough to satisfy the Rockets.‚Äù*  -Barry Jackson, Miami Herald"
"&gt;Dude didn‚Äôt even entertain a Herro trade for Harden even tho his best player is 31  How do you entertain a trade if there isn‚Äôt one to begin with ?  [Heat were prepared to offer Herro+Duncan Robinson](https://twitter.com/flasportsbuzz/status/1344691335459201028?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1344691335459201028%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-30835999862001070912.ampproject.net%2F2105210438000%2Fframe.html)  Houston wanted more. Heat don‚Äôt much in terms of picks either. The only picks they can trade are in 2025/2026.  Nets traded Levert &amp; Allen AND 3 FRPs, Allen was traded for another FRP from the Cavs.  That‚Äôs 4 FRPs + Levert in terms of valuable assets not including filler + Pick swaps.  Where in gods name do Miami come up with the Picks ? This deal could never happen realistically. The Lowry deal is much more realistic. You guys have to stop this narrative.  *‚ÄùBut the Rockets want more. Even if the Heat offered Herro, Robinson, Precious Achiuwa, KZ Okpala, Iguodala, Olynyk and first-round picks in 2025 and 2027, I‚Äôm not sure that would be enough to satisfy the Rockets.‚Äù*  -Barry Jackson, Miami Herald"
"Jimmy about to demand another trade, and will take KZ Okpala and Gabe Vincent in a 3 v 5 against the starters"
"No, they didn't. Sources came out with Houston's asking price.  - Herro, Duncan, Precious &amp; Nunn (combined salary: $9,732,122) - Salary Filler ($31,522,798 worth) - Two 1st-Round Picks (miami only has their 2022/2024) - 4 Pick Swaps (legitimately did not have enough picks to swap)  That means mortgaging the future in two ways: the young players **and** the pick economy for 2-and-a-half years of James Harden. Not to mention that Miami's only way to create the filler would've been to trade Olynyk &amp; Iguodala for Harden at the last minute.  But fuck it, because *Oh please...* came so easily to you, here's what the roster makeup would've looked like fresh out of the trade, completely ignoring that we didn't have the picks or the swaps for Houston.  PG: Goran Dragic/Gabe Vincent (2-Way)  SG: James Harden/Max Strus (2-Way)  SF: Jimmy Butler/Trevor Ariza (who was acquired with a 2027 SRP + meyers)  PF: Nemanja Bjelica/KZ Okpala   C: Bam Adebayo/Dewayne Dedmon (f/a signing)  If you think **that** 10-man rotation does any better against the Milwaukee Bucks than the one we've pushed out there twice, you're completely out of your mind. Go Hornets."
Lmfao at sticking one of these already struggling expansion teams with KZ Okpala.
We offer KZ ‚ÄúGiannis‚Äù Okpala that should do it
Which ever Heat scout said KZ Okpala will be the next Giannis should be fired immediately. We wasted 3 second round draft picks to have indiana take him for us. HE'S BUNS
"Well Jones came in and made a bad trade almost immediately, trading TJ Warren and KZ Okpala for cash."
"Three Nigerian starters in this game -- Precious Achiuwa, KZ Okpala, and Gabe Vincent -- are all Heat bench players"
"\&gt; Most of these guys on the roster were helping their NBA squad try to get into the playoffs a few months ago  Team USA has like 5 guys that average more ppg INDIVIDUALLY than Josh Okogie, KZ Okpala, Gabe Vincent, Ekpe Udoh, Michael Gbinije, Chimezie Metu in the NBA combined. Combined.  Granted smaller roles and less overall playing time, these guys aren't even in the same stratosphere at least yet. They are all bench players / rotational players. I mean Gabe Vincent is averaging 4.8ppg and .38 fg%.  You acting like you're some kind of basketball savant that saw this coming is incredibly disingenuous.  The reality is 7 guys shooting between 50-100% from 3 is highly unlikely (understatement) to be sustained and USA will adjust."
"They did lose that exhibition, and it must have been great for the Nigerian team's morale. But, KZ Okpala and Precious Achiuwa are not beating Dame and KD in a game that actually matters.   Especially since now they have something to prove"
Gave Vincent and KZ Okpala
"no shame in losing to the 2022 mvp gabe vincent, the 2022 DPOY kz okpala, and the 2022 MIP and finals MVP precious Achuiwa"
KZ Okpala. Orange County Legend.
Don‚Äôt you wanna see the KZ Okpala-Bam connection l?!!!!
"Gabe Vincent, KZ Okpala and Precious Achiuwa."
kz okpala about to show the heat why they need to play him
"Precious Achiuwa, Miami Heat   KZ Okpala, Miami Heat   Miye Oni, Utah Jazz    Josh Okogie, Minnesota Timberwolves   Jordan Nwora, Milwaukee Bucks   Chimezie Metu, Sacramento Kings   Jahlil Okafor, Detroit Pistons   Gabe Vincent, Miami Heat  Alzo Michael Gbinije and Ekpe Udoh have experience in the NBA."
Put some respect on my boy KZ Okpalaüò§
"They can have Herro for Dame, but KZ Okpala and Max Strus are way off limits!"
"To lose 81 games is such an incredible feat... lookin to these players to hopefully drop that ball   PG - Patrick Beverly   SG - Tony Allen   SF - KZ Okpala (iykyk)   PF - Anthony Bennett    C - Robin Lopez  Only time I can see them win is when they clamp down the worst team in the league, cuz honestly, this team's defense is pretty cool."
kz okpala
How do you feel about KZ Okpala and some 2nd round picks?
"Marielle Fultz, KZ Okpala, Josh Giddey"
"The others years didn't really matter but this year  1. Oladipo is out most of the season 2. guys like Gabe Vincent, Max Struss, Kz Okpala, Omer Yurtseven are projects/unplayable 3. Miami actually is opting not to use the 15th spot to stay under the luxury tax leaving them with only 14 spots  including UD thats 6 unplayable pieces right there leaving only a (playable) 8 man rotation for the season. This team went through tons of injuries and if you include the possibility of covid protocols thats a very short rotation to go through a season. On top of that they need decent a backup PG and SF. So some heat fans are angry that instead of being able to sign one of these veterans that are still on the market that can be a rotational piece they are giving the spot to UD when he could just stay on the bench in some coach type role."
Yo bring him to Miami we need a good backup pg. We will give you the legend KZ Okpala. Okpala just had an insane 0-3 in 30 minutes with our summer league team. A legend in the making. Deal?
"Idk of anyone who was hyping him up. He played like trash the whole season. I saw every game and every time Precious or KZ Okpala got minutes I knew the game was chalked. No hate, but I really can‚Äôt see Precious or Okpala ever being any good. I hope KZ is next out the door tbh."
"When it‚Äôs a guys first year on a team getting limited minutes and have a highlight real of L‚Äôs, it‚Äôs kinda bad. Good luck with him, but him and KZ Okpala have been ass since we got them."
"Idk, We‚Äôve had KZ Okpala for like 3 years and he has been pretty trash the whole time. Meanwhile other rookies like Nunn, Robinson, Herro killed it. They just don‚Äôt look very good. Maybe a change of scenery and coaches could help him out."
1. Dion Waiters  2. Tyler Johnson  3. Wayne Ellington  4. Rodney McGruder  5. Gabe Vincent  6. KZ Okpala  7. Max Strus  8. James Johnson  9. Justise Winslow  10. Greg Oden
For fucks sake if I have to see another one of these who's the best player and who's the goat threads. It doesn't matter. It's all personal preference. There is no objective way to determine this. I personally think the best player on the planet is KZ Okpala and there is nothing anyone can say to make me change my mind
"My flair will tell you I am biased towards the Raptors, but I think it is clear that the Raptors have the most leverage here, with Miami having the least leverage.   Miami needs the Lowry deal to go through and the Raptors want to help, but only if Miami compensates them enough. Achiuwa is clearly not enough to justify taking Dragic's contract. For the deal to go through, Toronto needs to be compensated. This can either come from Miami or Dallas. Dallas doesn't want to give anything of value for Dragic, so they would need compensation as well. Raptors are not going to give anything to Dallas to take on Dragic (obviously), so everything will have to come from Miami. People have floated around 2nd round picks/KZ Okpala, but I wouldn't be surprised if we hear about how Herro will become a sticking point. Miami has been adamant about not trading him, but what would happen if keeping Herro is what makes the deal fall apart? This is just speculation, though. Most likely scenario is KZ Okpala, a lightly protected FRP, and a SRP will be given to the Raptors to absorb Dragic's contract.   I personally think that a Malachi Flynn and Herro swap would be interesting, but Miami would apparently let the entire deal fall apart before they trade Herro."
"This would make sense to me as well.  KZ Okpala, a 2nd round pick maybe  more long wings please!"
One KZ Okpala coming up!
"As it stands (from rumours/reports)  Dragic, Achiwua, and a 2nd are going to Toronto.  Lowry is going to Miami.   Dallas is interested in Dragic, but can‚Äôt find a trade package that Toronto is interested in. If Toronto/Miami can‚Äôt find a 3rd team to take on Dragic‚Äôs contract, Miami will include additional assets (rumours are a 1st and/or KZ Okpala)."
"So far,      PG            C               SF                PF                SG     Kyle Lowry    Bam Adebayo     Jimmy Butler      PJ Tucker         Duncan Robinson     Gabe Vincent  Dewayne Dedmon  KZ Okpala (??)    Markieff Morris   Tyler Herro                                                                       Max Strus  KZ might be going in the Dragic+Achiuwa trade in which case I'm curious who'd fit into that spot. Second unit is looking a bit directionless."
"KZ Okpala, I think he‚Äôs playing for Nigeria in the Olympics"
kz okpala
Probably KZ Okpala
"And Herro and KZ Okpala, who are both under contract"
"Strongly doubt they get Robinson back if Lowry and DeRozan both go. Assuming Dragic and Precious are the S+T, and a conservative estimate of Lowry getting $25m a year and DeRozan getting the full MLE, the Heat will be over $104m with 6 players on the roster (one of them KZ Okpala)"
"Currently at 75M with only butler, bam, herro, and kz okpala under contract. Add Lowry for around 25M and duncan robinson for around 15M and it's up to 115M. So about 29M left to spend under the hard cap. If they sign and trade for derozan somehow, then the MLE will probably have to go unused."
"If we send Dragic (19.4 mill) and Achiuwa (2 mill) for Lowry, we have around 102 million in salary between Lowry, Bam, Butler, and KZ Okpala plus Duncan and Nunn's cap holds of 4.7 million each. The rumor is that Derozan could be slotted into the non-taxpayer MLE of 9.5 million and then we use our Bird Rights on Duncan to match any offer sheets. Miami's hardcapped at this point so whatever is left over, we'll probably use to re-sign Oladipo, Ariza, probably Bjelica, and then I guess we use the bi-annual to sign Dwayne Dedmon again."
Lol you guys are getting KZ Okpala
"Schroder and Harrell could definitely make some teams better. I was only talking about KCP and Kuzma. And I disagree with you about Kuzma‚Äôs potential, going into season 5 at age 26 I feel like we pretty much know who he is at this point.  THT is that one dude who‚Äôs potential ignited the home crowd. Every team has one. The Heat have KZ Okpala. I shit you not, his comp was Giannis lol point being I think at this point THT has way more value to the Lakers than anybody else."
KZ Okpala is a phenomenal defender.  If he could build his offensive game he can earn a lot more playing time and become a huge asset.  We gave up a lot for him so hopefully it works out.
"**Team Africa**  C: Joel Embiid, Precious Achiuwa.  PF: Pascal Siakam, Chimezie Metu, KZ Okpala.   SF: Josh Okogie, Luc Mbah a Moute.  SG: Victor Oladipo, DJ Strawberry.  PG: Miye Oni, Gabe Vincent."
Has been for awhile. Unless Spo plays Bam and Dedmon together and has Bam play some 4 this year.  Our depth in general is pretty concerning. Really counting on guys like Gabe Vincent and Max Struss to give us production off the bench. I have more faith in Max tbh. They were also really hoping KZ Okpala would show something by now but dude just looked straight up terrible offensively in summer league (his defense is alright tho)
"Because the heat aren‚Äôt good. Lowry is old and declining, Jimmy and Bam can‚Äôt shoot, Robinson can‚Äôt defend, Herro sucks, they might have give KZ Okpala serious minutes"
"Considering that  1. We have our PG in Lowry 2. Our top two stars don‚Äôt stretch the floor 3. Simmons doesn‚Äôt address our potential needs at the 5 (big body to go against the AD and Embiid of this world but who can also protect the rim and shoot 3s)  There is nothing that we can offer that makes sense for any team.   But to play your game, I‚Äôd give up KZ Okpala, Oladipo, and Gabe Vincent + a first and two second rounders."
"Yeah it‚Äôs clearly UD, but I find it super interesting how KZ Okpala convinced the team he is an NBA caliber player."
Kz okpala
KZ Okpala for Bol Bol? Nuggets need some defense and Okpala can do that
KZ Okpala
"Seriously, i‚Äôd honestly love to hear why the Suns aren‚Äôt shelling out now bc for all we know Sarver has no intention to match a max offer. This is the man who traded TJ Warren and KZ Okpala for straight cash"
KZ Okpala and a bag of chips
"KZ Okpala was born and raised in California. Jordan Nwora is from Buffalo. Ekpe Udoh was born in OKC. Chimezie Metu, Miye Oni and Ike Nwamu from LA. Plus Vincent and Okafor as you mentioned. There were only like 3-4 Nigerian-born guys on the whole roster."
KZ Okpala probably shouldn't be on a G-League roster but he'll probably finish the season on ours.
luka for KZ okpala
"Claxton at 31 still has massive potential too, in my opinion.  Kevin Porter Jr, Jordan Poole, KZ Okpala, Keldon Johnson, Nicolas Claxton is a seriously solid team of late, consecutive picks. KZ should be set to step up a bit in Miami this season."
"&gt;ere might be another Draymond Green or Paul Millsap who's about to make his breakout that was drafted in like 2019 that just isn't on our radar right now  That 2019 second round coincidentally has a lot of guys who could pop off this season:   Nicolas Claxton, KZ Okpala, Daniel Gafford, Eric Paschall, Isaiah Roby, Talen Horton-Tucker, Terance Mann, Jalen McDaniels.  Then there's the ultimate wildcard in Bol Bol."
Kz Okpala and Gabe Vincent but the Gabe hate has lessened recently.
KZ Okpala. But then again it's really fun seeing a second round pick get called a bust like. It's a second round pick
Kz Okpala and Gabe
"If it was preceded by Bam, Tyler, and Duncan continuously not putting in the effort needed to win, so much so that he took Caleb Martin, KZ Okpala, Omer Yurtseven, and Marcus Garrett in practice and bodied the shit out of the aforementioned starting players, and then those players didn't have an ""aw shit he's right we gotta be better"" moment but just doubled down and got defensive and called him a locker room cancer?  I would then say ""Damn Jimmy deserves better"".  Thankfully I don't have to worry about any of that in Miami as they all feel the same way as him and care more about winning than their fragile egos."
Kz Okpala
"Caleb has emerged to be the perfect back up wing forward that we need. I was concerned because KZ Okpala was supposed to be tht guy but he‚Äôs 2 years away from being 2 years away.  Caleb plays hard, defend, hs good hands, had a really nice athletic play alley oop where he caught the ball and reverse high off glass. Can make open 3 at an expected rate"
"It's funny you'd say that...  I opened the game late and was unaware Adebayo was also out.  So here I am wondering wtf why is Yurtseven playing in the first half? Wait KZ Okpala is in the game??? Hey, Gabe Vincent isn't being awful. Oh this must be the G-League... Wait why is Duncan Robinson here? Did they send him back to the G-League???  Had quite the trip until Tyler Herro checked back in. Then some Lowry action."
"Whatever Spo decides to go with, I just hope we never see KZ Okpala and Gabe Vincent on the court at the same time again"
KZ Okpala
"Sure but you can only develop so many people at once anyways and every team has multiple guys that never turn into productive roleplayers. Hell, great example here, both our teams tried to make Briante Weber work.  And we can always let go of KZ Okpala just as easily (more easily really) as UD if the team found someone who impressed them."
"People keep saying that but I don't think that's true at all. How valuable are those last 2 bench spots, especially now that we have 2-way contract spots now?  He's providing just as much on-court ""value"" as KZ Okpala has been for the last 3 years."
"This is the number one choice. Love the Heat, but not sure why this guy can‚Äôt get playing time even when half the team is injured. They bring in Caleb Martin over KZ Okpala? Wth?"
Gabe Vincent and kz okpala
What about Gabe Vincent and KZ Okpala?
I'll take Oladipo on one leg over KZ Okpala and Gabe Vincent right now TBH.
Gabe Vincent  Omer Yurtseven  Caleb Martin  KZ Okpala
