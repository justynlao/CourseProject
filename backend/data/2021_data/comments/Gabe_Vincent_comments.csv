"You do know we havent had a full squsd until like this week right?  Im concerned but I wouldnt cross off last season as a fluke based on like 8 games we had everyone actually play. If they are still bad by mid Feb, thags when I will freak out.  We were playing Gabe Vincent and Okpala till last week week lol."
"Gabe ""Steph Curry"" Vincent"
And having to play fucking gabe vincent
Looks like Gabe Vincent was limping off the court too.
Gabe Vincent
gabe Vincent looking like a smol Jarrett Allen
"More K-Nunn, less Gabe Vincent please.  He’s earned those minutes back"
Reading is that hard ? IT DEPENDS IF THEY CAN BACK THEIR WHOLE TEAM BACK QUICKLY ENOUGH.  Yeah if your team continue to have to play Gabe Vincent you could be in the play in
"I really like Gabe Vincent and Precious on the Heat, and that Strus kid's a shooter I wouldn't have noticed otherwise."
"No, but currently they are running Gabe Vincent at PG lmao. If it's Dragic, they stay put."
The amount of players Heat fans claim played these games decreases every day. Pretty soon I'm gonna hear you saying it was just Gabe Vincent vs. a healthy sixers team
"I don’t know, aside from Maxey being good, I’m having fun watching my team get crushed but having players like Herro, Duncan, and random third stringers like Gabe Vincent just get to do whatever for 35 minutes."
You clearly didn’t see Shake lock down Gabe Vincent last night

Wait so you’re telling me that Gabe Vincent doesn’t normally start for the Heat?
Gabe Vincent man. How do the heat keep pulling guys out of nowhere and making them good.
Who the hell is gabe vincent and how the hell is he averaging 16 ppg
gabe vincent night?
Yes Gabe Vincent and Tyler Herro who are both half a foot shorter than him created an impenetrable wall
"Idk man. It's just not. Why mention per 36? We're literally talking about one game. 5 points and 2 steals. In 32 minutes. Right up there with defensive stalwarts gabe Vincent, Kelly olynyk and Danny green"
In fairness Gabe Vincent is prime Ray Allen
Tbf gabe Vincent versus Isaiah Joe is a fucking delight
Gabe Vincent probably just took all of Nunn's minutes for the year
Gabe ‘Ray Allen’ Vincent
We played gabe Vincent 30
"If you don't like Dakota Mathias vs. Gabe Vincent, you hate competitive basketball. GG - hopefully we both can get a few more guys cleared next game Thursday."
"The Miami Heat have added these players to the OUT/Health and Safety Protocols list, following the completion of contact tracing:  Jimmy Butler  Goran Dragic  Kendrick Nunn  Bam Adebayo  Moe Harkless  Udonis Haslem  KZ Okpala  This is in addition to Avery Bradley, on the list Sunday.  ADDITIONALLY: Meyers Leonard (shoulder) is questionable, Kelly Olynyk (groin) is probable and Gabe Vincent (knee) is probable."
"This is a gross oversimplification of Bam's defense lol. Dude guards all 5 positions every night, switching every pick and roll, covering for defensive mistakes made by putrid defenders like Olynyk, Duncan, Herro, Dragic, etc. He regularly bottles up perimeter stars into passing away from that matchup. Numbers don't equate for this shit lol.   Bam is a top 5 defender in the NBA. Miami has a top 5-6 defense with 3 positive defenders on it and 10 horrendous ones on it. Like, worst in the league bad. Orlando has a below average defense. 18th in drtg and 22nd in field goal % against. There is a grand canyon gap between Bam's defense and Vucevic's. The gap between them defensively is probably 5x the difference between them offensively.   Bam is close to Gobert defensively, if not certainly more useful come playoff time. Utah somehow has a worse defensive field goal % against than we do despite the fact that Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, Goran Dragic, Kelly Olynyk, Gabe Vincent, Max Strus are arguably bottom 20 defensive players of anyone getting minutes in the NBA."
All stars Gabe Vincent and Max Strus just had an off night.
Miami was missing this guy for 9 straight games forced to play absolute fucking dogshit bums like Gabe Vincent heavy minutes.
"When Herro comes back and the Heat don't have to give Gabe Vincent or KZ Okpala extensive minutes, the Heat are going ro be scary."
"For some reason I always think KZ Okpala should be like 6'2"" and Gabe Vincent should be like 6'9"". I don't know why, just something about their names"
"Gabe fuckin Vincent adult man, how are things down at the ole dunk factory?   Good... I did a midrange"
Gabe Fuckin Vincent Adult
Shoutout to Gabe Vincent also. Needs to get those fouls under control but 11 points in as many minutes was very good offensive production
Just wait until we are playing Herro or Avery Bradley rather than Gabe fuckin Vincent
Gabe Vincent looking like Lionel Richie at the YMCA pick up games
It is kinda devastating because that’s the Heats entire guard depth forcing them to play 2-way contract guys like Strus and Gabe Vincent. Have you ever even heard of those dudes?
"Really went 0-7 while the commentators kept on saying ""shooters shoot"". I honestly just can't believe that Gabe Vincent and fucking Max Strus are two guys in our rotation this season"
I can’t believe Gabe Vincent managed to convince a teammate to vote for him
"Yeah true, I deleted my initial comment because it wasn't accurate and I realised that. I was just trying to make a point that Harden also needs talent around him, which is why I threw KD in the list and I wasn't only referring to Russ in OKC. And in this Heat scenario I know that talent includes Butler and Bam but I really think you need to have more than that.  As inconsistent as they are playing right now you are essentially trading half of your finals run team for one player. Go look at what Houston wanted, it's pretty much the whole Bench. Herro, Duncan, Achiwua, Nunn and salary filler which would've been Leonard but he's gone for the whole year. 2 first round picks and 4 pick swaps.   I get that Harden plays well with role players but the fact that you are sending ALL of the roleplayers plus more for him leaves you with literal G Leaguers. Gabe Vincent and KZ okapala ain't gonna cut even if you have Harden.   Besides, Miami have a fuck tonne of problems other than scoring right now that get worse with that trade."
Gabe Vincent just isn't the all star he was in the bubble. What a letdown.
Idiots don’t realize that the heat would have easily traded herro for harden it was the fact rockets the whole damn team since the heat didn’t have picks. You would have 40 year old haslem playing back up center and g league gabe Vincent off your bench
"Yeah, remember Gabe Vincent and Max Strus in the bubble? They were all stars in the bubble."
"Bam is 58x the defender Sabonis is while being comparable offensively lol. I mean Bam somehow anchored a top 16 defense while Jimmy and AB were out while we played Herro, Dragic, Duncan, Kelly, Nunn, Precious, Gabe Vincent, and Max Strus. These are all negative as FUCK defenders."
Damn no Gabe Vincent
"I heard of Gabe Vincent 10 minutes before the Sixers played the Heat, so if that counts, him"
"I think you mean Gabe Vincent, Nunn is alright."
"For real. In a game against the sixers this season the heat started herro, ollynyk, precious, gabe Vincent, and Duncan Robinson. They all played for close to 40 minutes each. Oh, and how can I forget about six man of the year, max strus. He really carried our offense this season. Can’t imagine how hard it must be for kyrie and James harden."
Kelly Olynyk and Gabe Vincent is the best i can do for Harden  Who says no?
I’m a big fan of everybody on my team... most the time. But sometimes Gabe Vincent drives me fucking crazy.
Gabe Vincent
"&gt; PLEASE NO MORE GABE VINCENT, PLEASE SPO  Oh don't worry. When Oladipo comes Gabe will never play a single minutes again"
"If you hate good NBA offense - watch this. That final 4th Q stretch was brick after brick after brick. It was stuck at 87-82 for the longest time. After Sabonis' dorky ass celebration on the over-turned challenge call they didn't score for like 3 minutes straight.  * We played like dogshit for most of the 1st half, went down 58-43 in the 3rd, and somehow won * Duncan had a phenomenal game tonight * Precious is officially getting on my nerves. I know he's a rookie, but goddamn * PLEASE NO MORE GABE VINCENT, PLEASE SPO * Bally sports... FIX YOUR GODDAMN FONT FOR THE SHOT CLOCK AND QUARTER TIME  But forreal - good ass win vs Indy. 'specially after they swept the last back-to-back against us."
Beal type? They should trade us Korkmaz for Gabe Vincent.
Is that the play that ended with a Gabe Vincent tip in?
"that steal by Gabe Vincent after the Noel block on Iguodala was the back breaker for us tbh, we were about to make a comeback down 8 (and about to be 6 or less) and then they got a few offensive rebounds (all game) and got a tip-in from Vincent after a missed shot"
olynyk would be replaced by meyers bc salary filler but yeah it would have been harden-bradley-jimmy-bam-meyers with dragic-gabe vincent-kz okpala-chris silva + buyouts off the bench  i think pat riley underestimated the free agency pull of ring chasing as well as harden's superhuman ability to carry teams but i understand why he didn't do it at the time
That's just because our point differential is still recovering from our 47 point loss to the bucks and all the big losses from when our whole team had covid and Duncan Robinson and Gabe Vincent were our #1 and #2 options. It was a dark time to be a heat fan.
"This is where I’m at. The only team that scares me is the Nets and that’s only if they have KD balling out. You get rid of Duncan and Herro, the perimeter shooting disappears. Shots that would have gone to them now go to...Strus and Gabe Vincent? Fuck that. I’d rather roll with the team we have now and take our chances in the most random season of my lifetime."
Gabe Vincent has definitely been terrible against every team not named Philadelphia. But at least he is a two way player.
"Max strus played well enough for people to readily add Drob to trades for a couple weeks. And Gabe Vincent has had games where you realize why he gets minutes, and then games where you realize there’s a reason why he’s only a 2 way player."
"They've had a lot of injuries/Covid issues.   I think at one point, they played the Sixers twice in a row starting guys like Max Strus and Gabe Vincent."
12-5 in games since Jimmy came back from weeks of being out due to Covid plus a revolving door of our important players out due to health and safety protocols. The team isn’t bad; they just aren’t playing. Just look at the amount of minutes Gabe Vincent has played. That’s not ok.
That’s probably the contingent that’s pissed at Jimmy for leaving. It is what it is. I got nothing against the Heat beyond friendly rivalry. And I won’t judge that roster based on games where Gabe Vincent had to play like 28 minutes.
"&gt; TF they were thinking playing no name ass dudes heavy minutes like Gabe Vincent and Max Strauss. Where these dudes came from??!? You won't win in playoffs playing them boys 15 minutes a night.  To be fair, Duncan Robinson and Kendrick Nunn came out from absolutely nowhere and have been great for us the past two seasons. Heat are great at finding undiscovered gems.  That said, Vincent and Strauss haven't shown themselves to be in that class. But the Heat are good at finding ""no name ass dudes"" to ball out."
"Now this is the Heat at their best, a true playoff rotation with proven veterans like Iguodala and Dedmon. Idk what TF they were thinking playing no name ass dudes heavy minutes like Gabe Vincent and Max Strauss. Where these dudes came from??!? You won't win in playoffs playing them boys 15 minutes a night."
"They didn't start that way, but in the later half of the season it's been Precious Achiuwa and Gabe Vincent.  Since we acquired Bjelica he's played like 3 games then disappeared, doesn't even get garbage time."
"Goran Dragic and Gabe Vincent, but that's my final offer. 👀"
AND Gabe Vincent (who already plays for y’all). That’s more than a third of our roster. 😂
"I posted this elsewhere here, but here are your lowest 20 per 36 Marvel Point accumulators (min 500 MP).   |Player|MHP per 36| :--|--:| |Wesley Matthews|8.5| |Rodney Hood|8.5| |Isaac Okoro|9.6| |Gary Clark|9.6| |Chasson Randle|9.7| |P.J. Tucker|9.9| |Solomon Hill|9.9| |Avery Bradley|10.0| |Sekou Doumbouya|10.1| |Gabe Vincent|10.1| |Maurice Harkless|10.3| |Mike Scott|10.7| |Gary Harris|10.9| |Semi Ojeleye|11.2| |Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot|11.2| |Grant Williams|11.3| |Tyler Johnson|11.3| |Austin Rivers|11.5| |Ben McLemore|11.7| |Damyean Dotson|11.7|"
"If one more Heat fan held the disdain I have for Gabe Vincent, two of us could’ve made him the most hated alone. I don’t think anybody does though."
Gabe Vincent anyone?
Cool? There's a strong chance we dont make the playoffs considering Harden/Butler/Bam/Dragic have together missed most of the season. We'd be relying on Gabe Vincent to carry the load and he's been injured often too. I don't even think we'd roster a team half the time
Ummmm.... Yes. Gabe Vincent was somehow worse though.
Gabe Vincent had more fouls than minutes
"Gabe Vincent would've if he wasn't pulled in 3 minutes for being a complete disaster. Us getting in the bonus with like 10:00 left in the 4th quarter, in large part because of Vincent, was pretty much the key to winning this game."
The Heat have a good squad. They won 40 games playing half the season with guys like Gabe Vincent and Okpala soaking up heavy minutes. They just have very obvious flaws that can be exploited by the right team: the Bucks are just bigger than them. How many teams have a seven footer guarding wings and another seven footer guarding the paint? This was their Kryptonite.
You know it's bad when Gabe Vincent gets some burn
"Jimmy about to demand another trade, and will take KZ Okpala and Gabe Vincent in a 3 v 5 against the starters"
Gabe Vincent LMFAOOO
Marv called Middleton Gabe Vincent.
"I mean, that's kinda over-looking the small detail that EVERYBODY on the Heat was out while Jimmy was out. So was Dragic. We were playing the likes of Gabe Vincent and Max Strus gigantic minutes. It's harsh to just fault Bam, as I don't think Simmons would have won a lot if Tobias Harris and Seth were also out.   I don't think Bam will ever be a superstar OR capable of leading an offense. But he can be a DPOY-caliber player who can get you 18-20PPG with the right offense. We don't have that offense at the moment."
"No, they didn't. Sources came out with Houston's asking price.  - Herro, Duncan, Precious &amp; Nunn (combined salary: $9,732,122) - Salary Filler ($31,522,798 worth) - Two 1st-Round Picks (miami only has their 2022/2024) - 4 Pick Swaps (legitimately did not have enough picks to swap)  That means mortgaging the future in two ways: the young players **and** the pick economy for 2-and-a-half years of James Harden. Not to mention that Miami's only way to create the filler would've been to trade Olynyk &amp; Iguodala for Harden at the last minute.  But fuck it, because *Oh please...* came so easily to you, here's what the roster makeup would've looked like fresh out of the trade, completely ignoring that we didn't have the picks or the swaps for Houston.  PG: Goran Dragic/Gabe Vincent (2-Way)  SG: James Harden/Max Strus (2-Way)  SF: Jimmy Butler/Trevor Ariza (who was acquired with a 2027 SRP + meyers)  PF: Nemanja Bjelica/KZ Okpala   C: Bam Adebayo/Dewayne Dedmon (f/a signing)  If you think **that** 10-man rotation does any better against the Milwaukee Bucks than the one we've pushed out there twice, you're completely out of your mind. Go Hornets."
"B.  We managed to recover well enough from a really bad start affected by Covid resulting in Gabe Vincent and Max Struss getting major minutes.  Still dropped plenty of winnable games though and could have been in a better matchup situation if we had done better there.  Precious is going to take a while to become properly affective, but that’s fine,  it was going to be difficult to match the absolute fun of last year’s run but I really like the team all the same and am curious to see how the playoffs affect what we do in the offseason."
"Not really. Nigeria’s leading scorer, Gabe Vincent, averages 12 minutes a game in the NBA. Josh Okogie averages 5 ppg in the NBA. Chimezie Metu averages 6 ppg.    Mills and Ingles are legit NBA players, but they’re role players. This whole thread is full of jokes about Keldon Johnson, and he’s better than anybody on either Australia or Nigeria. Team USA played 7 NBA All Stars."
"Just about. Bam, and maybe Duncan on USA. And precious, KZ, and Gabe Vincent on Nigeria. Herro on the select team.   Butler and Dragic are really the two other guys who could have played these olympics if they wanted to."
You forgot Gabe Nnamdi Vincent. Almost half of the list were on the Heat last season and Gabe.
You forgetting about the GOAT Gabe Vincent?
"I mean, they still should have destroyed Nigeria   Gabe Vincent is like a 3rd stringer who lit them up"
"I don't know if Zeller is necessarily the answer, but I also don't know why people would assume NBA All Stars would be necessary to compete internationally if bench players like Patty Mills, Gabe Vincent, and the skeleton of Luis Scola are smoking teams."
"&gt;“[To lose to] some dude Gabe Nnamdi, who goes by Gabe Vincent for the Miami Heat. Or Caleb Agada. Or Nma…however the hell you pronounce his name.  Jesus if a white guy said this it would be a fucking scandal. You really gonna make fun of peoples' names? Like the difficulty of an English speaker in pronouncing your name makes any degree of difference in the quality of their game and whether we should respect them as players?"
"The massive disrespect to the new Heatles Big 3 - KZ, Precious and Gabe Vincent"
"Nah, those are three chuckers. Don’t get me wrong, I’ll take any one of them on the Heat tomorrow, but not team USA. They already got Draymond, Middleton, Grant. Those are like the cavi cones of the 3 and D, not the Good Days or Berzerker though (that’s Kawhi and PG). No need to have Crowder throw up a couple 1/10s to sandwich his one 6/7 game.  Keep in mind that these dudes generally don’t need to defend elite NBA talent, they’ll be guarding Gabe Vincent, god bless his soul, and Euro stars. A streaky shooter is a streaky shooter though, regardless of who they’re playing.  If I had to guess, I would just say it’s a combination of fatigue and apathy. I don’t think replacing the talent makes much of a difference."
KD lost to Gabe Vincent. His tier is sub-olympic.
"&gt; gabe Vincent 6/8 3fg, is that going to happen often?  Maybe not 6/8 but I know he's a shooter."
"Three Nigerian starters in this game -- Precious Achiuwa, KZ Okpala, and Gabe Vincent -- are all Heat bench players"
"\&gt; Most of these guys on the roster were helping their NBA squad try to get into the playoffs a few months ago  Team USA has like 5 guys that average more ppg INDIVIDUALLY than Josh Okogie, KZ Okpala, Gabe Vincent, Ekpe Udoh, Michael Gbinije, Chimezie Metu in the NBA combined. Combined.  Granted smaller roles and less overall playing time, these guys aren't even in the same stratosphere at least yet. They are all bench players / rotational players. I mean Gabe Vincent is averaging 4.8ppg and .38 fg%.  You acting like you're some kind of basketball savant that saw this coming is incredibly disingenuous.  The reality is 7 guys shooting between 50-100% from 3 is highly unlikely (understatement) to be sustained and USA will adjust."
"Gabe vincent - born in modesto Jordan Nwora - born in buffalo Okpala - born in anaheim nwamu - born in LA Udoh - born in oklahoma Agada- born in Canada Okoye - born in North Carolina Iroegbu - born in Sacramento okafor - born in Arkansas Okogie - moved to US at 3, is an American Citizen  Would've been easier just to name the players from Nigeria"
Saint Mary’s High School legend Gabe Vincent
Currently its Gabe Vincent but maybe it changes tomorrow
Gabe **Nnamdi** Vincent
I need a god damn Gabe Michael Vincent!
My boy Gabe Vincent showed up!!
Gabe Vincent is gonna be the new international Patty Mills
"Yup, would rather here than later. But still, gabe Vincent 6/8 3fg, is that going to happen often? And obviously Nigeria is not their only opponent but will it be common for other countries to have these types of sharpshooters?"
Gabe Vincent turned to Steph curry.
Sign Gabe Vincent.
Gabe Vincent needs to be brought out of the G-League. He can shoot the 3!
"dawg still. if you told me our starting lineup was the first team all-nba team next year, I'd believe it. no fucking way we should be getting smoked by Gabe Vincent &amp; Caleb Agada."
Gabe Vincent &gt; KD don’t @ me
Gabe Vincent
Imagine forming a super team just to lose to heat legend Gabe Vincent
We wouldn’t have gotten swept if we played Gabe Vincent
That Nigeria team didn’t have Gabe Vincent
Give credit to Nigeria. They made 20 threes. They was cooking out there especially Agada and gabe Vincent.
Precious Achiuwa and Gabe Vincent for Kevin Durant. Who says no?
Gabe Vincent better than all of them combined tonight
"no shame in losing to the 2022 mvp gabe vincent, the 2022 DPOY kz okpala, and the 2022 MIP and finals MVP precious Achuiwa"
Gabe Vincent
That’s MIAMIS Gabe Vincent sir
Gabe Vincent instantly goated
Ima tell my kids Gabe Vincent is Steph Curry
Kd and draymond gonna fight over recruiting gabe Vincent
Gabe “Steph Curry” Vincent
They also said Gabe Vincent can be a good piece for the Heat. Dude doesn't sniff the floor in playoff rotations.
Gabe Vincent
"Gabe Vincent, KZ Okpala and Precious Achiuwa."
Don't sleep on my boi Gabe Vincent.
"Precious Achiuwa, Miami Heat   KZ Okpala, Miami Heat   Miye Oni, Utah Jazz    Josh Okogie, Minnesota Timberwolves   Jordan Nwora, Milwaukee Bucks   Chimezie Metu, Sacramento Kings   Jahlil Okafor, Detroit Pistons   Gabe Vincent, Miami Heat  Alzo Michael Gbinije and Ekpe Udoh have experience in the NBA."
"NBA players on their roster include:  Precious Achiuwa, Kezie Okpala, Miye Oni, Josh Okogie, Jordan Nwora, Chimezie Metu, Ekpe Udoh, Jahlil Okafor, Gabe Vincent."
"I actually heard the above news from someone I know who’s kinda close to the Nigerian team, but I also saw this on Twitter (see link below) since I wanted to make sure I wasn’t misleading anyone. That’s the official Nigerian Olympic Basketball team Twitter page (you can see it has a lot of info/photos from the training camp).   I was told guys like Gabe Vincent, Precious Achiuwa, and Jahlil Okafor would be some important pieces. Also Ike Diogu is their veteran leader (he’s played overseas a lot but was a former 1st round pick). Also I believe Jordan Nwora (who’s currently with the Bucks) might be able to make the team if he chooses to play after the Finals is over (his dad is associated with the team so my guess is he doesn’t need as many contractual stipulations).   Nigeria’s group is super balanced but I would say a team like Australia which has a core who’s played together a long time is probably better at this point, but we’ll see what happens. I am rooting for Nigeria over Australia.   https://mobile.twitter.com/NigeriaBasket/status/1409722941005258752"
Jimmy Butler  Bam Adebayo  Duncan Robinson  Max Strus  Omer Yurtseven  Gabe Vincent
"I agree with their take on the Heat. It’s not an incredibly big issue (considering Bam, Jimmy, and Lowry are all ball handlers to some extent) but Gabe Vincent is nowhere near good enough to be a quality backup PG. The only problem close to backup PG is backup C, since Dedmon will not be good enough sometimes. But, Morris and Tucker can shift down a position if needed."
I saw a little bit of Jarreau for the Heat and I hope he gets some minutes. People are talking about Gabe Vincent as our backup point in local newspapers. I never really saw much from him last year.
"&gt;Please point out to me where I ever said that any team was offering multiple firsts for Lowry.  Some of the links you provided as evidence of the existence of offers for Lowry say exactly that.  I thought you read them, but perhaps not.  Next time, I would advise reading your citations.  &gt;You said teams wasn’t willing to pay Lowry $30 million a year.  Well, he didn't get $30M, he got $28.3M.  And they needed to pay him at least $\~23M just to match salaries.  Apparently the extra was to create a TPE for Toronto, so I'm not sure one can conclude that $28.3M was Lowry's value on the open market.  &gt;Funny enough, Dragic, the player who you thought he is a better player than Lowry, and a player who you thought shouldn’t get paid as much, ended up getting traded in a package for him.  And I still think that Dragic + Nunn for $\~24M makes Miami a better team than Lowry for $28M.  Who is Miami's backup point now, Gabe Vincent?  That's the only other point on their roster.  Are they going to run Lowry 40+ minutes at his age?  Not for long they aren't.  &gt;You also thought he would walk for free, which was wrong.  Yeah, this was a terrible trade by Miami -- maybe unless Dragic is still more injured than we know -- but it was still a far smaller return than you claimed Toronto was offered at the deadline.  So that's a lose/lose deal."
A young kid trying to make it in the league better be more valuable than Max Strus or Gabe Vincent.
"The others years didn't really matter but this year  1. Oladipo is out most of the season 2. guys like Gabe Vincent, Max Struss, Kz Okpala, Omer Yurtseven are projects/unplayable 3. Miami actually is opting not to use the 15th spot to stay under the luxury tax leaving them with only 14 spots  including UD thats 6 unplayable pieces right there leaving only a (playable) 8 man rotation for the season. This team went through tons of injuries and if you include the possibility of covid protocols thats a very short rotation to go through a season. On top of that they need decent a backup PG and SF. So some heat fans are angry that instead of being able to sign one of these veterans that are still on the market that can be a rotational piece they are giving the spot to UD when he could just stay on the bench in some coach type role."
I'd take him in Miami. Gabe Vincent sucks
Considering we needed a stretch big that's also a 7fter he solves more problems for Miami. Plus you have gabe vincent as a young PG
1. Dion Waiters  2. Tyler Johnson  3. Wayne Ellington  4. Rodney McGruder  5. Gabe Vincent  6. KZ Okpala  7. Max Strus  8. James Johnson  9. Justise Winslow  10. Greg Oden
Gabe Vincent being our backup pg until Dipo returns.
Gabe Vincent is our backup point guard Rn tho
Jimmy missed a ton of time. Dragic. Herro. Nunn missed time. Dipo only ended up playing 4 games for us. Even Bam missed time. Avery Bradley was hurt all year. The Heat were playing straight bum gleaguers Max Strus and Gabe Vincent significant time lol

Second unit is looking a bit directionless."
Nigerian legend Gabe Vincent.
"Not really KZ is 22, Gabe Vincent is 25, Strus is 25, Bam is 24, Herro is 21 and Duncan is 26. We have like 3 old players in Butler, Tucker and Lowry."
Some dude Gabe…..Nnamdi?!? The one who goes by Gabe Vincent?
Dude Gabe Vincent is torturing the team USA basketball team but doesn’t get on this list?
"&gt;Like I said, all of us would die for our country.  *looks over at Gabe Vincent and Jahlil*"
Going to have to throw in Gabe Vincent too while they’re at it
What was gabe Vincent thinking with all those 3s ? He is 30 % shooter in the NBA
"right the difference between luka and the 40th best basketball player in the world is gigantic.  but the difference between the 380th and 423th isn't as much.    Italy its actually a good test of this theory  fontechio and polanaro are two top 30 players in Europe. Plus they have galo who might be the best player between italy and nigeria.  but nigeria has more nba players.  gabe vincent, kz opkala, precous achuiwa, josh okogie, miyi oni , chemezie Metu, jordan nwora.  almost their whole rotation besides agada and emegano"
How the fuck is a team of KD Dame Tatum Bam etc crappy?  The Nigerians have a team led by Ekpe Udoh and Gabe Vincent and beat us
"""Man I know Gabe Vincent aint nice like that over here"""
Gabe Vincent the Nigerian Curry 1/7 today lmao
Gabe Vincent is balling
"Thanks for including the /s, if you hadn't included that I totally would have thought you actually think Gabe Vincent and Bradley Beal are equal!"
Ok somebody’s feeling greedy… Gabe Vincent straight up swap is more than fair   /s
Gabe Vincent though
"**Team Africa**  C: Joel Embiid, Precious Achiuwa.  PF: Pascal Siakam, Chimezie Metu, KZ Okpala.   SF: Josh Okogie, Luc Mbah a Moute.  SG: Victor Oladipo, DJ Strawberry.  PG: Miye Oni, Gabe Vincent."
Has been for awhile. Unless Spo plays Bam and Dedmon together and has Bam play some 4 this year.  Our depth in general is pretty concerning. Really counting on guys like Gabe Vincent and Max Struss to give us production off the bench. I have more faith in Max tbh. They were also really hoping KZ Okpala would show something by now but dude just looked straight up terrible offensively in summer league (his defense is alright tho)
Gabe Vincent
"He was good for us when he played. He just couldn't stay healthy, so it was easier to ship him out for Oladipo and, although Oladipo got injured too. Oladipo at full healthy is more impactful for us than Avery Bradley at full health. I'd personally wrlcome him back to Miami. I'd rather have him over Gabe Vincent."
"I think we will need a player to take an unexpected leap to have a chance. Our main guys log a lot of miles and we don’t have a lot of proven bench players. If Okpala can hit threes consistently to be a good 3 and D guy or Gabe Vincent could earn real minutes at the backup pg role, I feel good. If they don’t earn it, I don’t feel so good as I think we are like 7-8 deep or so max."
"We lost a lot. People talk about us gaining Lowry and that’s great, but he is much older than he was even when he won a championship.   Beyond that, from our 2020 Finals run, we lost, Dragic, Crowder, Olynyk, Iguodala, Derrick Jones Jr., Nunn and Meyers Leonard.   We’ve added old Lowry, old PJ Tucker, Markief Morris and Dewayne Dedmon.   Really and truly, I don’t expect too much production out of Morris and Dedmon and even with them we lost 7 rotation guys and added 4. The ones we added are older and our bench is shorter. We went from being 11 deep to about 7 deep unless Okpala and Gabe Vincent to actually earn more minutes which they really haven’t as of yet.   It’s hard to win a championship without solid bench production and nobody on our bench really pops, scares a team, or does really anything so well as to be incredibly positive for us."
Gabe Vincent
Bismarck biymbo and gabe vincent So literally no one. They are uncrowned co-MVP
"Considering that  1. We have our PG in Lowry 2. Our top two stars don’t stretch the floor 3. Simmons doesn’t address our potential needs at the 5 (big body to go against the AD and Embiid of this world but who can also protect the rim and shoot 3s)  There is nothing that we can offer that makes sense for any team.   But to play your game, I’d give up KZ Okpala, Oladipo, and Gabe Vincent + a first and two second rounders."
"Really? I don’t think we need wing depth, we just need one more wing.  Lowry | Dipo Duncan | Herro Butler | Strus for now, also KZ is available PJ | Keef Bam | Dedmon  We don’t need depth, just one more would be enough to complete the puzzle. I’m worried about the Gabe Vincent minutes till Dipo comes back more than anything lol. Marcus Garrett could also be used"
Very nice. Did you get to watch Gabe Vincent in person?
"Great question. u/rkpeagle1013 had a great [breakdown](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/pbig8z/sbj_espn_takes_rachel_nichols_off_nba_programming/hac6faj/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) elsewhere in the thread:    &gt;1.

"I don’t get it either, but we will see. Adding PJ Tucker was pretty big. I love that. Our backup point is Gabe Vincent though and I have zero faith in him."
"5 games don't mean anything over a stretch of 82 — 5 out of 5 games **do** mean something, no matter how you want to spin it. he had tangible effects on both ends of the floor, and even if he comes back with low athleticism, he's a better option as a backup ball handler than our current one (Gabe Vincent was a two-way player last year and should, ideally, still be in the G League right now)."
This is why its important to watch the games bot just look at a box score.  PJ played 30+ min and had 0 points. Lowry out and Gabe Vincent started at point and had 0. Dedmon 15 min 0 points. Jimmy struggling.  Herro was literally being doubled and the only one able to keep the offense afloat. No one who actually watched that game would think he was chucking or had a bad offensive game.

"I know a lot of fans want KZ gone but at least he's a body on defense, instead of Gabe ""road cone"" Vincent.  Doubt Gabe will start ever again, but ig he got it tonight over Strus cause experience? I dunno."
"Yeah with no Dragic we have to run bum ass Gabe Vincent out there. He may be the worst player in the league and I don’t think I’m joking, he has zero offensive game and he can’t defend for shit."
"Possibly, I don't think we'd start Gabe Vincent. But if Lowry's out we probably have Jimmy be the primary handler and he could share point time with Herro.  In our first preseason game Butler was out and Herro started at the 3 alongside the other regular starters, and it looked fine."

Thought Gabe Vincent played well for Nigeria
"ATL going with their likely starting 5 while MIA is starting UD, Strus, Gabe Vincent, KZ and a Martin twin."
"Most of them born in Nigeria. They all played college ball in the US, and many played HS as well. But they're still Nigerians, I think only Jahlil Okafor and Gabe Vincent were born in the US and grew up there from a young age"
"Max is untested and it is still up in the air if he will earn solid minutes. Same with Yetzen to an even greater degree, although I’d be really excited to see him. Morris is really solid on the bench. Same with Gabe Vincent. He and Max are pretty untested to this point, even if they’ve shown some flashes."
That's true. I think Oladipo will actually be the backup PG and replace Gabe Vincent
"So many takeaways. Not just what Lowry does for us, but it feels like all our young core players got better.  * Bam, Tyler, and Duncan all got bigger and faster * PJ feels like Ariza and Iggy combined into one person * Probably too early to judge but it seemed like Max Strus and Gabe Vincent (and maybe even KZ) took steps, though Gabe still needs to rein in those turnovers  And these two impressed:  * Caleb Martin. I didn't even know we had this dude, apparently we two-way'd him in mid-September. I don't know if his game tonight is representative of what he can usually do, but he showed out * Omer Yurtseven. He played his first NBA minutes tonight. In just 14 minutes he got a team-leading 8 rebounds. He's still green and made all the typical rookie mistakes like too many fouls and low shot clock awareness, but he absolutely did his job and filled his role"
Why did the Heat sign Lowry when they already have Gabe Vincent
"I’ve got a pretty random list. Off the top of my head:  Felicio, Vonleh, TJ warren, Mitch McGary, Jakarr Sampson, Semaj Christian, Wiggins, Stanley Johnson, Olynyk, Sabonis, Gabe Vincent, Tyler Johnson, Robert Swift  Between college ball, prep school, and the aau circuit I’m sure I’m missing more"
I agree. They should trade Embiid to the Heat for Gabe Vincent straight up and build around Ben!
He really sets the tone in practice and camp. It’s different having someone on the same level as the players who is out there working with you that has the respect of all your superiors but still allows himself to be coached like any rookie. It shows what the team is about. If UD is giving it everything as a senior citizen then Gabe fucking Vincent better run those sprints.
"Herro off the bench helps balance their lineups better. It essentially allows Spoelstra to always have 2 of Lowry, Herro, Jimmy, and Bam in the game at all times when healthy.  I’d imagine Gabe Vincent or Morris would get the starting spot if Duncan gets demoted."
Aaron Gordon vs the ghost of Gabe Vincent lol.
"He really isn’t a point guard that’s why Miami got Lowry, Wall would help a lot and completely eliminate players like Gabe Vincent and Max Strus and also probably take time from Duncan Robinson who honestly needs to get his shooting together before Oladipo comes back or he will be losing minutes to him as well. If Miami got Wall and Oladipo comes back healthy I don’t think anyone can beat Miami"
"I mean, I like Gabe Vincent too but he's not the best backup yet"
Yeah wasn’t really bad defense either. They doubled Jimmy to deny him the ball which they should do on that situation. I’d rather Gabe Vincent shoot last second free throws than Jimmy if I’m an opposing team. It was really just a great play call though. Spo gambled on them potentially doubling Jimmy and it worked.
22 turnovers and letting a dude named Gabe Vincent torch you on the second night of a back2back doesn’t usually translate to a W if you ask me

"Great game defensively, for both teams. But of course congratulations and deep respects to the Heat, their defence was better and they didn't give Zach a room to breathe.  Also shoutout to Gabe Vincent, that man was the decider in the 4th quarter."
Gabe Vincent vs Alex Caruso is why people turn on that game right?
"Gabe ""Modern Day Jesus"" Vincent only has to wait until the next game to go off after being crucified."
Idk it reminds me of Heat fans furiously typing how much they hated Gabe Vincent and hated that Spo played him. Sometimes you gotta give guys minutes and live with it if they struggle. Coby is important to their season so I’m not surprised he’s getting minutes.  Like you really can’t just bench a shooter cause their shots not falling. You’ll just end up mentally breaking all your shooters. Just like Spo playing Duncan through his slumps
Enter: the Gabe Vincent era
Gabe Vincent revenge tour starts now
The Heat really shouldn't have won this given the circumstances but Gabe Vincent and and Kyle Lowry said NAH
"Honestly, he is an energy guy. Brings the energy up, plays hard. Good glue guy. Unfortunately he played against Gabe Vincent going super saiyan."
Gabe Vincent is the new Undertaker
He was up against Gabe Vincent. /s
&gt; Gabe Vincent became Klay Thompson in that 4th quarter  RSBK
Heat leading scorer Gabe Vincent is what I expected before the game started.
Tyler herro who? Gabe Vincent is my new best friend
"As we all expected, Gabe Vincent was the best player in the fourth quarter"
Thank you Miami Heat legend Gabe Vincent.
Gabe Vincent is just too good I guess
Gabe “Duncan Robinson” “Tyler Herro”” Vincent
"Gabe Vincent became Klay Thompson in that 4th quarter. If I'm a Bulls fan, I'd be furious lmao  Felt like we were gonna crap our pants with another bad 4th Q just like we did vs Minnesota and then Gabe/Lowry went to another stratosphere. Hell of a win vs a damn good team."
Thank you gabe Vincent and SPO
Kz Okpala and Gabe Vincent but the Gabe hate has lessened recently.
Gabe Vincent
May i interest you in one Gabe Vincent
May i interest you in one Gabe Vincent
"Gabe Vincent is the main punching bag.  However, both Bam and Duncan have been getting rough treatment lately.  More Duncan than Bam, really."
RIP Gabe Vincent [sauce](https://twitter.com/bennnyboom/status/1463708731674406914?s=21). You really hate to see the league reward that bullshit late/weak rotation.
Did you WATCH the video? Edwards made Gabe Vincent a maneater by putting his nuts down his throat…
"Anyone else notice that they're allowing way more taunting this season? The way Ant stood over and looked at Gabe Vincent woulda been an easy tech until recently. I'm definitely not complaining, just something I've noticed."
Gonna come back as Vincent Gabe and hope no one remembers he's the same person.
"&gt; He was already airborne when vincent got there lmao. Awful call.  it's the right call. It may not be the popular call, but Gabe beat him to the spot. Call me a no-fun guy, but being cool doesn't earn extra points from me."
On the same day the refs bail out Gabe Vincent from an equally monstrous Ant dunk no less
"Gabe Vincent does clear the bubble, but his right foot is way off the ground when they collided.  Rule of cool &amp; the Rulebook agree on this case."
im ngl as a heat fan this hurt but it was on gabe vincent so i felt a little less bad
Gabe Vincent 🤝 Riley Reid  Having videos of them getting facefucked on the internet.
Nope Nope Nope. That was a murdering. Gabe Vincent is no more.

So Jimmy got Gabe Vincent murdered.
"GABE FUCKING VINCENT , MY CONDOLENCES!"
"Gabe Vincent was playing well, and then gave his life so the Heat might have a chance.  A noble sacrifice, but all in vain."
damn he sucked the soul out of gabe vincent
"I remember how much flack everyone gave MIN for drafting this guy number 1 after there were all those rumours about how he wanted to play football and how lax he is about his legacy but cmon… THIS GUY IS A MANEATER, I couldn’t care less about Melo’s rookie season, this man is the TRUTH.  Side note: you love to see Gabe Vincent put his body on the line to draw a foul like that, a lot of other blokes out there getting 12 mins a game that make make a business decision there, a true reflection of the culture the in Miami."
Anthony Edwards:  - Showed up  - Dunked Gabe Vincent into he shadow realm  - Refused to elaborate further  - ~~Left~~ Ejected  Woulda been some GOAT shit
call anthony edwards a priest.  He just baptized Gabe Vincent.
Day? Ant murdered his career. Gabe Vincent is gonna be the guy that got dunked on now
"i thought this was title gore, but he's right. gabe vincent is dead."
TIL there ~~is~~ was a Gabe Vincent in the NBA.
[Gabe Vincent passed away violently tonight.](https://streamable.com/c6b53h)  He will be missed.
Well I mean he literally murdered Gabe Vincent.
[Gabe Vincent passed away violently tonight.](https://streamable.com/c6b53h)  He will be missed.

Gabe Vincent is a brave soul because I would have moved tf out of the way.

I mean it’s fine. Tyler plays the most minutes each night anyways.   You want Gabe Vincent and KZ for Cory Bc I will drive them to Michigan right now
why did Gabe Vincent not play? he killed us last game but he got a DNP today. is he injured or something?

It’s gonna be Gabe Vincent
"Gabe Vincent, wtf. I hope this is a turning point for him. He looked great defensively, but offensive was lackjng"
Lotta people Googling Gabe Vincent rn  Edit: Oh my god the Spoelstra table leap
Fucking Gabe Vincent lmao
holy shit Gabe Vincent playing great tonight
The Gabe Vincent game
"Good 2nd half from butler, unlike him in the 1st. Bench did really well and hope Gabe Vincent continues this run of his. Even if it's against 500~ teams"
UD so mad he had to play minutes that he put extra spice on that block. That 3 from Gabe Vincent was clean as hell
Gabe Vincent minutes give me trauma
"It's funny you'd say that...  I opened the game late and was unaware Adebayo was also out.  So here I am wondering wtf why is Yurtseven playing in the first half? Wait KZ Okpala is in the game??? Hey, Gabe Vincent isn't being awful. Oh this must be the G-League... Wait why is Duncan Robinson here? Did they send him back to the G-League???  Had quite the trip until Tyler Herro checked back in. Then some Lowry action."
"Whatever Spo decides to go with, I just hope we never see KZ Okpala and Gabe Vincent on the court at the same time again"
"KZ AND Gabe Vincent, this is the stuff of nightmares"

Hopefully Gabe Vincent gets bullied into being a better player.
It should be illegal for Gabe Vincent to play basketball

Gabe Vincent is a frustrating guy at times
"While I understand this take, I don't agree with it.  It isn't UD's responsibility to make room for the young player. At the end of the day rosters are built by evaluating the value a player brings to the team. The Heat FO clearly believe the value UD brings to the team on/off the court is higher than any other young player they could sign. I would rather cut(or send him down to the G league) Gabe Vincent before losing UD."

"It is.  Markieff and Strus were out, Jimmy left the game early, then Bam and Dedmon both got in foul trouble.  Having Haslem, Martin, and Gabe Vincent all playing is not what the Heat want to do."
He shouldn’t but I want it to happen for my own selfish reasons lol. I’m tired of seeing gabe Vincent get playing time dude
Butler was injured. Struss was injured. Apparently Spo didn’t trust Caleb Martin and Gabe Vincent has issues. I think the Heat were forced to play Duncan when they clearly don’t like closing with him. I also think Spo made some rotation choices on principle. Like leaving UD in for 5 mins in the 2nd
We deserve half a win for having to play Gabe Vincent outside of garbage time
"We can’t really get deeper without getting new guys. Oladipo doesn’t count, he’s more like a potential pipe dream bonus, kind of like Oden was when we had him, a low risk rehabilitation project. It’s not like Strus or Gabe Vincent or KZ will make sudden leaps.  We’re already losing steam the past three games, getting crushed by a supposedly bad team amidst inter-team drama, blowing a 19-point lead with a few minutes left against Utah (still won thankfully), then getting crushed by Denver missing 2/3 of their top guys."
Gabe Vincent
Who gives a shit it’s probably just be another KZ or Gabe Vincent on the bench instead of him who suck ass anyways
"I remember the flashes, though they were mostly on D.  Not as frustrating as Gabe Vincent was"
Gabe Vincent and kz okpala
Take Gabe Vincent instead
Gabe vincent is awful. I’ll take that trade 100/100 times
"Miami can have the dragon back, I'll take Gabe Vincent and a 2nd"
"It's not that you would take a guy who can't stay on the court over a Gabe Vincent, it's that so many Heat fans are treating Oladipo like he's surely coming back and will be reliably available to play, when he's rarely ever been."
What about Gabe Vincent and KZ Okpala?
Or if we wanna rest Lowry. Dipo+Herro is much better than having to watch Gabe Vincent or Caleb Martin.
"yeah, a good way to put it in short is that you can either have Gabe Vincent and Caleb Martin playing NBA basketball in a Miami Heat jersey, or you can try out a fully rehabilitated Victor Oladipo and whatever that may entail.  it's not a fucking question"
"&gt; “I repaired the quad tendon and did it a little differently than [he had] it done before,” Dr. Glashow told ESPN. “The quad wasn’t really hooked up. It was torn, and I reattached it. I was amazed he was playing with what he had. I’m very optimistic that I could clear him in six months, by November. I think he’s going to play really well again… [The surgery] went extremely well, and it’s healing beautifully. I’m confident he’ll play next year.”  Now, why Oladipo's surgeon didn't really **fix** the issue the first time is a puzzling question, but Oladipo's said that he's felt unbalanced ever since and didn't realize that that wasn't just a product of having a repaired quad. He's since said that he feels balanced for the first time in a while (and you can take it with a grain of salt, because he's a player rehabilitating his image).  What we **need** from VO isn't much (if we keep this up, because we're 6-1 as the best defensive team in the NBA) but I will take an ""infamously chronically injured player"" over potential Gabe Vincent minutes every single day of the week. Having VO off our bench fortifies that lineup **and** produces the 5-headed Clamp Monster lineup of Lowry/VO/Butler/Tucker/Adebayo.   He'd be a gamble if we absorbed a legitimate contract from him -- right now, the gamble we're taking on Oladipo is like shooting craps with weighted dice. If he sucks, whatever, we're fine without him."
The score is nice and everything but the real story is that we got 1:28 of Gabe Vincent vs. JaQuori McLaughlin. I don’t even know if two UCSB players have ever shared the floor together
I'll take Oladipo on one leg over KZ Okpala and Gabe Vincent right now TBH.
idk id still rather have him than gabe vincent
"Gabe Vincent for Smart, who says no?"
"ariza was, iirc, the 2nd most negative player on the heat last year (gabe vincent).  like he was one of the worst players in the league in net rating. he looked gassed on every possession, he was genuinely awful. if ur looking for him to play any amount of minutes ur in big trouble imo."
KZ and Gabe Vincent. You can have them for free.
Oh are we counting Gabe Vincent as a player now too? I thought he was just keeping that slot warm.
Gabe Vincent  Omer Yurtseven  Caleb Martin  KZ Okpala
As a fellow Warriors fan I agree. We should trade him for a real talent like Gabe Vincent.
fuck you gabe Vincent
"Ah, now I need to watch Gabe Vincent.  Worth it for the shooting display."
"Yeah they couldn’t get open and were taking contested jumpers. Last year we also had Nunn and dragic to at least drive and her bam and jimmy open we don’t anymore, so when Lowry goes down we start bum ass Gabe Vincent. Watch the fucking games he’s insanely valuable that herro buzzer beater only happened because of Lowry, if you watched you’d see Lowry yelling at Tyler to stay in the back court with him. If you watch these games you’d see Lowry all the time doing this and setting up our offense which is why it was so bad when he was out. You can say poor shooting which it was but you’re leaving out the context that jimmy and bam were constantly shooting jumpers."
Herro made that game look close. We had to start Gabe Vincent. It was painful.
