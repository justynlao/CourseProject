It's very top heavy and super super thin at the Center position. Last year's draft class probably had better depth of talent. Though i do think some very good guard prospects are being severely underrated (Jared Butler/Miles McBride/Davion Mitchell)

"&gt;maybe one outside of the top 5  Bouknight for sure is one. I actually think I might have him a touch too high here. If UConn flames out hard, I could see if slipping because the SG market is ridiculous competitive for this draft. His whole schtick is that hes been one of the best scorers in college basketball and if that slips, then so does his stock.  He's a bit on the older side (relative to the one and dones) and his entire impact is in his scoring.  If he shows he can't get it done in the tournament, I could see him slipping hard, but if he does, I think theres a reasonable chance that a GM could bite on him on the first guard outside of Cade/Green/Suggs. Though I personally think he's a bit of a fools gold - that'll just show through unless he can have a great tournament.  Ayo Dosunmu is another. Ayo has a lot of question marks in terms of his NBA role and ability for things to translate, as well as his age curve, so if he can keep himself in the spotlight and continue to prove that hes simply better than the competition as an elite scoring option, I think that would be hugely beneficial. I could see a team reaching on him hard if he leads teh Illini far, but also dropping if he's forgotten about quickly after an upset.  &gt;another currently out of your 1st round  Herb Jones just played the best basketball of his career leading Alabama to the SEC championship and I think Alabama are a decent darkhorse in the tournament. I personally believe they should have been the 1 seed over Michigan. He will have a ton of eyes on him  if he leads Alabama far, and theres plenty of contenders with late 1sts who could use his role player skillset.   Miles McBride is another (for 3rd seed WVU), but I technically included him in the 1st for this mock (for the first time), but im really not confident at all he will be a 1st rounder."

"&gt;there are usually more than 4 solid three point shooters in the lottery lol.  Well, there are 5 this year. Let's check the past few drafts.   2020: Toppin(low volume), Smith(low volume), Vassell, Haliburton, Lewis, Nesmith.  2019: Morant, Hunter(low volume), Garland, Johnson, Washington(low volume)  2018: Young, JJJ(low volume), Bagley(low volume), WCJ(low volume), SGA(low volume), Mikal Bridges, Miles Bridges, Robinson  There are usually about 3-4 actual proven shooters in the lottery of each class, not counting guys with solid percentages that only have like 2 attempts per game.   ------------  &gt;and no chance in hell those guys guard 3 positions at an average level.  Name which one of them couldn't guard 3 or more(not counting McBride who I already said)."
"When Miles McBride was asked who was his toughest cover between Cunningham, Mitchell and Reaves, he said Mitchell without a doubt.  Then theres the whole defensive player of the year thing on the other side of the ball.  And the fact that Baylor reached heights its never been before might have something to do with it.  Idk, lol."

Oh yeah miles mcbride
"Post-lotto mock draft. I'm pretty much going BPA in my opinion, with some subjective considerations, particularly whether I think the team is going for high potential or high floor, and in some cases where multiple players are about the same talent tier, best fit.  1 - Detroit - Cade Cunningham   2 - Houston - Evan Mobley   3 - Cleveland - Jalen Green   4 - Toronto - Jalen Suggs   5 - Orlando - Jon Kuminga   6 - Oklahoma City - Scottie Barnes   7 - Golden State - Moses Moody   8 - Orlando - James Bouknight   9 - Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  10 - New Orleans - Davion Mitchell   11 - Charlotte -  Franz Wagner   12 - San Antonio - Alperen Sengun   13 - Indiana - Josh Giddey   14 - Golden State - Corey Kispert   15 - Washington - Keon Johnson   16 - Oklahoma City - Usman Garuba   17 - Memphis - Ziaire Williams   18 - Oklahoma City - Kai Jones  19 - New York - Cam Thomas  20 - Atlanta - Isaiah Jackson   21 - New York - Sharife Cooper  22 - Los Angeles Lakers - Chris Duarte  23 - Houston - Trey Murphy  24 - Houston - Tre Mann  25 - Los Angeles Clippers - Jaden Springer  26 - Denver - Greg Brown  27 - Brooklyn - Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  28 - Philadelphia - Miles McBride  29 - Phoenix - Day'Ron Sharpe  30 - Ayo Dosunmu"
"Nerlens Noel, Mitchell Robinson are top defenders at their position. Reggie Bullock was a solid defender last year, Elfrid payton (despite being garbage) is a decent defender, RJ is coming to his own on defense. Miles McBride looks like he has the tools to be a great defender."
We got Miles McBride and Jericho Sims this year with 2nd round picks. Just sayin'
"Josh Christopher, James Bouknight, Jalen Johnson, Ziaire Williams, Evan Mobley  My thinking was to start with the best player from 21-60, since it's the hardest place to find talent. Then go with Mobley since he's the highest value C and it's the hardest position to fill using this draft. From there, you slot in the BPA for each segment.   For 21-60, I went with Josh Christopher, but I could be sold on Cam Thomas or Miles McBride, maybe even Sharife Cooper. Just the highest ceiling guard in that range (deepest position overall)."
"Alperen Sengun, Jalen Johnson, Quentin Grimes, Cam Thomas and Miles McBride were the 5 who I felt dropped too far."
"No one is arguing, I have an opinion and he has his about basketball talk, why u taking it to the next level with random shit with the mom has to much during pregnancy? Straight weirdo. Also why is immanuel quickley still playing then? Knicks have young guards like miles McBride and Quentin Grimes, quickley is obv to good for summer league also"
"Well it shouldn’t have been, he’s the 3rd string PG with schroder and smart over him, you got guys like immanuel quickley obviously to good to be in summer league still playing, and the Knicks have guards like miles McBride and Quentin grimes as rookies, so obviously you can still make it work"
"I just woke up actually so I slept really good in my new bed, but I woke up with 15 people going off on why Pritchard shouldn’t be in summer league, when you got guys like immanuel quickley in summer league still lighting it up, and the Knicks also have young guards like Quentin grimes and miles McBride so wouldn’t they want to see the level of those guards also?"
"I woke up to 15 people in my mentions, you guys are spamming me because I said Payton Pritchard like immanuel quickley should still be in summer league😂... Oh so Pritchard is to good to play in summer league and the Celtics want him to sit so they can see the younger guards, but the Knicks who have young guards like miles McBride are OK with quickely who is still playing dropping like 30 points each game obviously to good for summer league also, so why is quickley playing and Pritchard isn’t? There extremely similar"
RJ Barrett is gonna average 20+ shooting at least 45% from the field and 38% from 3 on good defense. Miles McBride will make all rookie first team
"I would also argue that Baylor's team defense was miles ahead of WVU, they are pretty comparable as defenders, McBride is looking like he could guard 1-3, I am not sure if Mitchell will be assigned wings"
"The ""maybe"" isn't saying we might not have to offer them, it's saying that those players might be untouchable in the Knicks FO's eyes  Even without those players you're getting Noel/Burks (both moveable contracts who would certainly be traded for more assets for the Blazers), Obi Toppin, Miles McBride, Jericho Sims, Quinton Grimes, Mitchell Robinson (5 young players), and a LOT of picks. You can decide for yourself if the Blazers would take that (I wouldn't) but it isn't the most ridiculous package ever considering what Harden went for.  I would be shocked if we get Dame without moving one or both of RJ/IQ"
"some combo of:  Nerlens Noel, Alec Burks, RJ Barrett (maybe), Immanuel Quickley (maybe), Obi Toppin, Mitchell Robinson, any of our future picks, Miles McBride, Quinton Grimes, Jericho Sims  I don't think it beats the Sixers package if they offer Simmons + another player + picks"
"The problem with IQ is he doesn't really run an offense. He does his own thing which is either dump the ball off or create for himself, which is great when he's hot but when he's not then his teammates are going to suffer for it. 20 minutes a game is just right for him IMO, I think Miles McBride will also be deserving of some minutes too"
Fr. His supporting cast with the Knicks would be Taj Gibson and Miles McBride
A really good example of it working is the Knicks.   They signed Marcus Morris and flipped him 2 months later.  Which turned into:  1. Immanuel Quickley (2020 #25)  2. Miles McBride (2021 #36)  3. Rokas Jokubaitis (2021 #34)
"Brandon Boston is wrong, Ziaire Williams is wrong, Isaiah Todd is wrong, Miles McBride is wrong, JT Thor is wrong, Jared Butler is wrong, Greg Brown is wrong, Balsa Kopravica is wrong. I don't think there are many accurate teams on his list lol."
"Oklahoma City has acquired No. 32 from the Knicks for Nos. 34 and 36, source tells ESPN.  He is going to OKC. Knicks got Rokas Jokubaitis and Miles McBride"
Miles McBride is a great get for Dallas.
So the second round still has:   * Sharife Cooper  * Jared Butler  * Miles McBride  * Ayo Dosunmu  * Jason Preston  * Joe Wieskamp  * Isaiah Todd * Isaiah Livers * Joel Ayayi * BJ Boston  There's some really good talent in there.
Really bummed Miles McBride didn't go first round
Well Miles McBride and Day'Ron Sharpe can definitely contribute right away.
They better call McBride Deuce instead of Miles.
Miles McBride gonna sneak up to top 25 I’m calling it.
"Miles McBride, Quentin Grimes, Jaden Springer, Josh Christopher"
"Bucks have the 31st pick while feels like a pretty volatile place. The dream is Ayo Dosunmu or JT Thor drop past the first round, but more realistically hoping for Miles McBride or Quentin Grimes."
1. Cade Cunningham (Detroit Pistons)  2. Jalen Green (Houston Rockets)  3. Evan Mobley (Cleveland Cavaliers)  4. Jalen Suggs (Toronto Raptors)  5. Scottie Barnes (Orlando Magic) 6.

Miles McBride?! Don’t mind if I do.
"Guys of Davion's profile are also always available in late first.    If you are gonna trade up, should be for the type of prospect you can't get at 26.  There are plenty of meh upperclassmen guards mocked in the late first.  I mean, stick Miles McBride on Baylor and Mitchell in WVU and does anybody have Mitchell going ahead of McBride?  I doubt it."
Miles McBride is worth 40 million dollars and Quentin Grimes is worth 0
RJ Barret is closer to Miles McBride or Quentin Grimes than he is to Anthony Edwards
Miles McBride
.....Miles McBride szn
Miles Mcbride szn
I’ll give you miles McBride and 2 second round picks
Jericho Sims and Luka Samanic are locks but Quentin Grimes and Miles McBride are uncertain? lmao uhhhhh
