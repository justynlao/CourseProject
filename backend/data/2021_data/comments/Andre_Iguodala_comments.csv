"I see you’ve mentioned Dirk I raise you, ANDRE IGUODALA."
Andre Iguodala reacts to the whistle like he just watched the second plane go into the south tower
"LeBron’s won the last 6 game 7’s he’s played, unless you’re taking Russell, in a winner take all game LeBron should be your choice.  And easier competition? He’s played Tony Parker 3x, Manu Ginobili 3x, Tim Duncan 3x, Ray Allen 4x, Paul Pierce 5x, Kevin Garnett 5x, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose 3x, Andre Iguodala 5x, Dirk Nowtizki, Carmelo Anthony 2x, Paul George 4x, Russell Westbrook 2x, James Harden 2x, Kevin Durant 3x, Kawhi Leonard 2x, Stephen Curry 4x, Klay Thompson 4x, Draymond Green 4x, Damian Lillard, Nikola Jokic, and Jimmy Butler in the playoffs.  And ignored a bunch of fringe guys like Arenas or Jason Kidd."
Imagine thinking Andre Iguodala was more important in the finals than Steph Curry
"Who's the better player, Charles Barkley or Cedric Maxwell?  Karl Malone or Andre Iguodala?  Steph Curry or Chauncey Billups?  You can be a run-of-the-mill star or even, in certain circumstances, a role player and win FMVP. That's not true with MVP."
And is a average role player unless he has 3 super stars and a finals MVP playing along side him. Andre Iguodala would have had more of a right to talk shit than Draymond.
Also Andre Iguodala over Klay. This list is crap.
"Injury Report before anyone asks ""Why are the Heat 6-12?"" tomorrow:  \- Jimmy Butler, Goran Dragic, Avery Bradley, Andre Iguodala, Meyers Leonard, Maurice Harkless, Chris Silva all OUT"

Daily Discussion Thread : [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/wiki/rules#wiki_daily_discussion_thread)"
"Jokic, he's by far the best player according to impact metrics which are designed to tell you which player helps the team win the most. Now with MPJ back Jokic's play will translate to a bunch of Ws again. Joker's putting up massive numbers but they also are as valuable as they look.  Historically guys like Andre Kirilenko and Iggy fit the bill. Iguodala rarely had standout boxscore seasons but impacted the game like an All-Star for many years. Jimmy Butler comes to mind if we look at the past 2-3 years. Draymond is another good example. Chauncey Billups is another one. Jason Kidd put up unspectacular numbers but was a high impact player. Lowry is another great example as you mentioned. Honestly any Top10 player fits the bill as well, strictly speaking. Harden Bron AD Giannis Kawhi KD have the highest impact in the league and so their impressive boxscores are also the opposite of empty stats. Jrue Holiday is another guy that has more impact than his statlines suggest. Generally great wing defenders fit in that department since their value is hard to capture through traditional means."
"Kobe's last three years didn't need to be that way, though. Just like Westbrook's play doesn't need to be what it is now. It's hard to do, but players can adjust their game to fit a new role and still be a productive NBA player. Vince Carter did it. Ray Allen did it. Rudy Gay, Andre Iguodala, Chris Paul, etc."
"I have really thought about this, and a deal with Tyler Herro, Andre Iguodala, Meyers Leonard and 3 first rounders might make the most sense. Leonard is an expiring, and Iguodala has a team option. It would be almost like a 1 for 1 with 3 first rounders. I’d probably take a swing on Herro being a great player in a few years whilst he’s on a rookie contract than taking Ben, and if I’m Miami, I do this 100%."
"&gt; Warriors had 2 damn good defenders in Klay and Draymond, and Steph wasn’t a slouch either.  Warriors also had Andre Iguodala, Marreese Speights, Shaun Livingston, Andrew Bogut, David Lee, Harrison Barnes etc.  Depth matters. One of the reasons Warriors fans are optimistic about next season, when Klay comes back, is that while having two seasons effectively lost to injuries sucks absolute balls, the bright side is that it let us rebuild the bench. Bench depth is incredibly hard to maintain during non-stop title runs."
"Andre Iguodala would have a good argument. He was already a brilliant player to begin with who passed and took care of the ball as good as most guards in the league. In his prime, he was an insane athlete and could get to any spot on the court. And on top of that he was/is one of the best perimeter defenders of his generation. Now add Steph’s J..."
Do you really think Andre Iguodala in 2020 can put up a statline like Grant on a bad team?
"OP you murdered Arizona Basketball. Sean Elliot all time? Are you forgetting about Andre Iguodala , Gilbert Arenas. Shoot DeAndre Ayton was drafted a couple years ago and is far more talented then Sean Elliot ever was."
"1st FMVP was probably the weakest one until like the yar after. Don't get me wrong, a FMVP is a FMVP at the end of the day, but Kawhi got that award for having the ""Lebron Stopper"" narrative in similar fashion to Andre Iguodala. The 2014 FMVP could have gone to like 3 other players.   His Toronto FMVP is a whole another story."
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green.   6th Man: Eric ""Better Zion"" Paschall  Coach: Don Nelson"
Andre Iguodala
"Him not suiting up to play has no basis on his value.   In 2012, the Lakers traded Andrew Bynum in a four-team deal that also sent Dwight Howard from the Magic to the Lakers and Andre Iguodala from the 76ers to the Denver Nuggets. Bynum never played a game for the 76ers.   Bynum signed with the Cavaliers in the 2013 off season and by January Cleveland traded Bynum to the Bulls in a package that got them Luol Deng.   So what did you learn? Teams will always be eager to make stupid trades."
NBA players like Andre Iguodala explained that Bron hates Curry because he’s light skinned for a black dude. Plus the fact that Curry tremendously changed how the game is played so Bron is bitter and jealous as usual that he was not the one who changed the game.
"I mean that’s how I interpreted that quote. What do you think?  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2019/10/31/20941852/kevin-durant-left-warriors-free-agency-explanation-nets  “I came in there wanting to be part of a group, wanting to be part of a family, and definitely felt accepted,” Durant told the Wall Street Journal’s J.R. Moehringer. “But I’ll never be one of those guys. I didn’t get drafted there ... Steph Curry, obviously drafted there. Andre Iguodala, won the first Finals, first championship. Klay Thompson, drafted there. Draymond Green, drafted there. And the rest of the guys kind of rehabilitated their careers there. So me? Shit, how you going to rehabilitate me? What you going to teach me? How can you alter anything in my basketball life? I got an MVP already. I got scoring titles.”  “As time went on, I started to realize I’m just different from the rest of the guys. It’s not a bad thing. Just my circumstances and how I came up in the league. And on top of that, the media always looked at it like KD and the Warriors. So it’s like nobody could [give] a full acceptance of me there.”"
Him and Andre Iguodala were just those dudes hitting 25% throughout but 100% when it mattered
[CJ McCollum and Andre Iguodala chiming in](https://i.imgur.com/kZDT9Lm.png)
"Are you even thinking before you hit post.  Andre Iguodala won FMVP in large part because of his defense. Curry was the offensive leader for the Warriors, and was great in the 4th Q of that series.  Curry had his worst series in 2016, to be sure. He's been good in all others however."
Andre Iguodala won over Steph as well was it Andre's team?
"I mean in Ethan Strauss book, he talks about how Andre iguodala moved half his stuff into Justin Holidays locker as a message to him that he’s about to be out of the league if he doesn’t play better.  The NBA isn’t a nice play a lot of the time"
"Ben Simmons is a complementary player and not close to being a superstar, even if he is sometimes perceived as one.  He’s a more skilled but flawed and probably lesser version of Andre Iguodala at a similar age."
That's FINALS MVP Andre Iguodala okay!
Guess Andre Iguodala just some scrub then?
"But what you’re saying is that Paul Pierce (the originator of the “I can’t win a chip alone, I need a big 3) and Andre Iguodala (a great defensive player and decent 6th man, but only 1 time all-star) are on the same level...and that level is ABOVE Luka Doncic who is an MVP candidate and without a doubt the best young player in the league?? Do you even watch basketball?"
"Who is Andre Iguodala?  I saw him out there, is he one of the rookies??"
Andre iguodala carried every team he was apart of.
"When I first got into the nba, my parents wouldn’t let me stay up late enough to watch the western conference games so what made me fall in love with the association was the eastern conference circa 2009-2012  Celtics: Loved Watching Rondo facilitate to Kg, Paul, and Ray Bulls: D Rose was an exciting of a player as I’ve ever seen, plus I loved the way Joakim Noah played  Magic: Prime Dwight Howard killing shit with Hedo, Vince Carter, Jameer Nelson, and Ryan Anderson Heat: LeBron, Wade, Bosh were on another level Pacers: Paul George, David West, Roy Hibbert, Lance  Sixers: Young Jrue Holiday and Andre Iguodala  Knicks: Melo and Amari    Even liked watching the not so good teams like the Cavs with Young Kyrie or the Wizards with young John Wall"
"1. Bradley Beal FOR Pascal Siakam  2. Bradley Beal FOR Jrue Holiday  3. Bradley Beal FOR Tyler Herro, Andre Iguodala, Kelly Olynk  4. Bradley Beal FOR Ben Simmons  5. Bradley Beal FOR Al Horford, 4 1st Round picks  6. Bradley Beal FOR Jamal Murray  7. Bradley Beal FOR Eric Bledsoe, JJ Redick, 2 1st Round picks  8. Bradley Beal FOR Kemba Walker, Payton Pritchard  Which of these trades is the best?"
Their entire bench outside of Shaun Livingston and Andre Iguodala
"Sure, but my response was to the notion that it was “Steph vs. Lebron” which is silly because Steph lost out to Andre freakin Iguodala for FMVP."
Memphis did it with andre iguodala told him to stay home till they got a trade they wanted
"TFW andre iguodala is described as an ""infinitely better shooter"" than you"
The “draft Raphael Araujo instead of Andre Iguodala” era
"It's a problem when they say shit like Andre 'role-player' Iguodala robbed Steph of the 2015 FMVP. Or that KD ran to join Steph, the genuine 3x champion. It's just straight up disrespectful to the sport. No other fanbase rips their own teammates to elevate their guy to the extent Stephews do."
"That’s not unique to LeBron. Hell, both Tim Duncan and Andre Iguodala have never committed a foul in their entire careers - truly impressive stuff"
"Yeah, Jamal Crawford finished above Andre Iguodala in both 2015 and 2016, when Iggy was a GOAT-level 6th man, and Crawford was barely a positive player."

Finals mvp Andre Iguodala
"The crazy thing is that they also have other valuable players like Kendrick nunn, who I expect to get there by the end of the season, precious achiuwa, who looks like a promising young defender, Andre iguodala, who provides veteran leadership, defense, and shooting, Myers Leonard, a strong center who can shoot threes, and mo harkless, who is a solid 3 and d player. This is after losing derick Jones jr, Jae crowder, and Solomon hill in free agency. If they were able to bring those guys back they would be 15 men deep."
"the single biggest stain on lebrons career is that he got swept by a roster of 4 (!) garbo overrated players, absolute choke artists   in crunch time, with martian death beams pointed at the earth, the only good player on the warriors roster is andre ""jordan"" iguodala, who single handedly embarassed so called all timer lebron james"
"Bro I love Iggy, but Kerr had to seriously offense-defense substitute Quinn Cook and Andre Iguodala bc we needed Cook’s shooting during the Raptor’s box-and-one. 2019 Iggy was clutch, but defenses still didn’t respect him and surrounded Curry w 2-3 guys.  Yes, he was vital. And Livingston would probably also be vital if Steph had went down and KD had to carry. Again, you don’t have an argument"
&gt; to be run by some g-leaguers or some washed up vet who refuses to shoot 3s  Lol you juss described 2019 Andre Iguodala and Alfonso McKinnie... aka KD’s backups when he went down in 2019. You don’t have an argument
"I remember when he first came to the Dubs, when he was a starter and still had a lot of his athleticism, but when Kerr came in and wanted to bring him off the bench despite him being the better player than his replacement in the starting lineup, Harrison Barnes, Andre didn't make a big stink, didn't screw up the lockerroom, he was willing to try it and it paid off in a championship and a FMVP for Iguodala (I personally think it was a kind of suspect vote but what can you do).   I have so much respect for Andre as a player and as a person. While I of course appreciate everything KD did it was loving Iguodala that hurt the most."
&gt;DWade legit might be the biggest Curry stan   Andre Iguodala would like a word
I pick. ANDRE. IGUODALA
"Yep.   LeBron averaged 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, 8.8 assists, and 1.3 steals that series and it literally felt as though he was single-handedly propelling that team as far as it could possibly go. I know it wasn't LeBron vs. the Warriors but it often felt like you were watching LeBron vs. the Warriors.   I mean, Andre Iguodala won Finals MVP because he played a role in LeBron turning in only one of the best Finals performances of all-time instead of *the* greatest Finals performance of all-time (people will look at James' field goal percentage and criticize someday, though it was mostly a result of trying to do everything at all times on that team and nearly succeeding).   If we wanted to go traditional, Steph would have been very fitting (26.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 1.8 steals, .385 from deep, 25 treys in six games).   Andre Iguodala doesn't make much sense in most frames of thought."
Andre Iguodala?
I HATE when people refered to Andre Iguodala as AI... AI is Allen Iversion.
Iguodala doesn't like iggy fyi https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1779798-andre-iguodala-on-iggy-nickname-i-never-liked-that
"We are finding out once KD left the Warriors management aren't light years ahead of the league. They couldn't replace Andre Iguodala a wing who can guard perimeter on defense, and switch if they need to. On offense he can be ball handler, playmaker, cutter, and good screener. Shaun Livingston veteran point guard who help the bench handle the ball, get buckets in midrange with his height and length, make necessary passes, set good screens, and can defend the perimeter. They don't have a big who can defend the paint well like Bogut or Durant. Who else on this team you are scare of shooting or make good decisions on the court consistently besides Curry? All 4 games warriors are getting cooked by their opponents, and they can barely get any stops. Curry gravity is still lethal, but his gravity can't overcompensate flawed players in Andrew Wiggins, Kent Bazemore, Damion Lee, Kevon Looney, Nico Mannion, Mychal Mulder, Kelly Oubre Jr, Eric Paschall, Jordan Poole, Juan Toscano-Anderson, Brad Wanamaker, Draymond Green, and James Wiseman against good teams"
Unfortunately you'll need to settle for the Andre Iguodala kind
"And interestingly, when LeBron James kicked Andre Iguodala in the nuts the next year, it wasn't even a common foul, much less a flagrant."
"I think what you meant is ""Danny Green, Andre Iguodala, or JR Smith have won the last 9 NBA championships."""
"It’s easy to look back and say that now, but at the time, it was still a team friendly deal. Here’s an article written at the time he was signed.   https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/7/12/4518576/nba-free-agency-2013-andre-iguodala-golden-state-warriors"
"Off the top of my head to kick things off:  1) When was Shaq the fattest? There were numerous random huge guys drafted this decade. Not sure who the shortest were last decade, especially since so many listed heights were a joke.  2) Most: Duncan? Nash? Nowitzki? Grant Hill? Least admirable can get real tricky this decade ... Z-Bo?   4) Iverson &amp; Larry Brown were definitely a weird combo. So were Shaq-Kobe since they both wanted it all and couldn't co-exist. Darko on those '04 champion Pistons.  5) KG's clash with Minn's idiot owner was good, but I know there's something better. Kobe def threw his teammates under the bus pretty good in the mid-00's.  6) Personal Foul (*Tim Donaghy*), The Last Season (*Phil Jackson*), 07 Seconds or Less (*Jack McCallum*)  7) Andre Miller, Camby?  8) Maybe Andre Iguodala or Shaun Livingston  10) Michael Beasley!  11) Boris Diaw?  12) Athlete = LeBron, unless I'm missing something. Fastest = Iverson. Leaper = Vince, Francis.   13) Phil Jackson, Ron Artest? Marc Cuban?"
"The Golden State Warriors reportedly have interest in a trade for Victor Oladipo, according to Kevin O'Connor of The Ringer.  O'Connor noted this shows the team's plans to add another ball-handler in the mold of Andre Iguodala or Shaun Livingston, who each played key roles during the team's three NBA titles.  Oladipo has appeared in 15 games with the Houston Rockets since coming over in a January trade from the Indiana Pacers, averaging 19.9 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.7 assists with his new team.  The 28-year-old is set to become a free agent in the offseason.  Several big names have already changed teams this season, including James Harden heading to the Brooklyn Nets as part of a blockbuster four-team deal and Derrick Rose returning to the New York Knicks from the Detroit Pistons.   The Pistons are keeping Blake Griffin on the bench for the time being as they continue to explore trade opportunities for the six-time All-Star. The Cleveland Cavaliers are also holding Andre Drummond out of games in hopes of dealing him.   Teams will try to pursue other impact players such as Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine ahead of the March 25 deadline, while a young playmaker like Lonzo Ball or veteran role players like JJ Redick, George Hill and P.J. Tucker could all be on the move to help contenders.  For more NBA coverage, check out B/R's surprise landing spots for the league's top trade targets.

"I disagree. He made it over as an all-star replacement for Chris Bosh over better players like Vince Carter, Richard Jefferson, Andre Iguodala or even Antawn Jamison"
ANDRE IGUODALA
"We had a good bench of vets and youngins for 2017 and 2018, 2019 is when things went to shit.   Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, Javale McGee, David West, Ian Clark, Patrick McCaw, Looney.  Ian left after 2017.  Nick Young joined in 2018  David West retired after 2018,   Javale left after 2018  McCaw left after 2018.  Nick Young went after 2018.  Also, Zaza went, that's our entire bench minus Iggy and Livingston who were getting older  We were then left with Iggy, Livingston, Looney, Jonas, Cook and Jordan Bell.   What a fall from grace from our bench. From one of the best and smartest benches to absolute shit."
"Dr J for the sixers is obvious, but his peak dunking was aba pre sixers. I think Andre iguodala is pretty underrated in game dunker. Article mentioned darryl dawkins and throw in Ben Simmons for pretty solid list for one team."

A bizzaro Andre Iguodala with the Warriors.
Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala but that's kind of a copout so I'll say Demar Derozan
"Oh he must not realize that there were more players on the W’s than Durant and Steph. Believe it or not, Steph had help from some other pretty “okay” players. Guys like Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, David West, Andrew Bogut, Andre Iguodala, and Javale McGee. I guess he just isn’t familiar with any of those players."
"My whole issue with Rockets fans is how delusional they are in regards to the outcome of that 2018 WCF series. They act as if the injury to Chris Paul hadn't occurred, they would have definitely advanced, while never taking into consideration the injury to Andre Iguodala, or the margin of victory in the previous games in the series, etc."
According to Andre Iguodala he is lol
Draymond Green? Andre Iguodala?   Never even heard announcers talk about them being athletic (although iggy was in the dunk contest) it always about the BBIQ.  Making blanket statement never works out bruh

"Let’s go through a list of some notable players who refer to Jrue Holiday as one of the game’s best three defenders or as the league’s most underrated players:   [Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Andre Iguodala, Lou Williams, Joe Ingles, JJ Redick.](https://www.thebirdwrites.com/2020/9/9/21428836/jrue-holiday-giannis-lebron-james-ja-morant-all-defensive-pelicans-bucks-clippers-beverley-bledsoe)"
"I watched prime Pippen. Without Jordan, Pippen would be a typical best player on a mediocre team. A better scoring Andre Iguodala without the hops."
The entire ethos of 38 year old Andre iguodala is to get away giving as little effort as possible on defense. He knows exactly what he’s doing but once you see it you’ll never be able to unsee it
"In general, and this is very general, 6th man ""scorer"" archetypes have more value in the regular season than in the playoffs. The regular season is a grind. Teams benefit from a bench player who can come in, run the offense, and get buckets. This allows starters (read: star players) to play fewer minutes and not wear down as much during a long regular season. Come playoff time, starters play more minutes because there are no more back-to-backs and the games all hold more importance. A bench scorer ends up being less valuable than a someone like Andre Iguodala when he was with the Warriors and the defensive role he played."
i agree. it marginalized andre  iguodala  from getting the honour many times.
"what if they even had a savvy veteran defender, an andre iguodala type?"
"Yup, he's actually why I said ""on a NBA roster"" and not ""play in the NBA.""  The other three are JJ Reddick, Andre Iguodala, and Carmelo Anthony."
Udonis Haslem (40)   Andre Iguodala (37)  Carmelo Anthony (36)  JJ Redick (36)  LeBron James (36)
"&gt; Of everyone on Golden State, open shot with the fate of the universe on the line or the Martians have the death beam pointed at Earth and you better hit it, I want [Andre] Iguodala,"" ESPN's Max Kellerman said Monday morning on ""First Take"" when asked if he'd rather have Iguodala or Steph Curry shoot the ball with the game on the line."
"MVP Steph Curry / All-NBA All-Defensive Klay Thompson / MVP Kevin Durant / All-Star Chris Mullin / All-Star DPOY Draymond Green   Bench: Andre Iguodala Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, Chris Mullin, Monta Ellis, Harrison Barnes, David Lee, Andrew Bogut, Gilbert Arenas, Latrell Sprewell... sure I'm forgetting some people   Good luck Lebron lmao"
Andre Iguodala didn't win finals MVP for putting up the most points. He won it because of his defense on Lebron. Of course he didn't stop him. No one stops Lebron. But he really did slow him down enough for his higher scoring teammates to outpace him.
I completely agree with you however you lost me at Andre Iguodala
"&gt; But hey we talk about an award that Jamal Crawford won over Andre Iguodala and Taj Gibson,   Funny thing about this was that everyone on r/nba was stunned when he won it at the time. The sub was polled prior to award voting and he finished [5th.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4fim5i/official_rnba_power_rankers_2016_award_votes/)"
"I think Clarkson will win it, I also would like one day, that the 6MOY award becomes something other than the ""scorer of the bench who can't do anything else"" award, because there are a lot of better bench players that just never even get votes because they don't score like that but that any contender would want over the ""one dimensional gunner on average efficiency"" type.  But hey we talk about an award that Jamal Crawford won over Andre Iguodala and Taj Gibson, so I can't complain about Clarkson because he's at least good"
If I had to choose one of them to take the last shot it’s probably Andre Iguodala.
That's Finals MVP Andre Iguodala to you
"[during the 2011 nba lockout, iguodala took an internship at merril lynch and shadowed a venture capitalist and visited the nyse](https://www.businessinsider.com/andre-iguodala-internship-2011-10)"
"They also played in an era with no zone defense. Bulls second best scorer averaged 16ppg in 1995-6. Warrior's second best scorer (whoever he may be) averaged 30ppg on transcendent efficiency. Then Klay is a better scorer than Pippen. Warriors also have Andre Iguodala, David West, and Shaun Livingston to bring off the bench. They easily roll the Bulls in 4, 5 if they're lucky. MJ can GOAT all he likes, he's going to have about as much success as LeBron did, which is to say none at all. Bulls have no answer for Curry, KD, and Thompson whatsoever. There's just too many threats. Rodman is fantastic but the Warriors have prime Draymond. I just don't see how anyone could think otherwise. Two MVPs and all-timers in their absolute primes sharing the court &gt; 1 MJ. And again, they're both more efficient scorers than MJ. None of the big men on the Bulls would be able to stay on the court with Draymond, so you'd basically see Dray and Rodman small ball an entire series, which I'd really like to see, lol."
I thought Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss were going to put us in the playoffs by 2018.   I thought Josh Jackson’s floor was Andre Iguodala.   I thought Devin Booker was just going to be a spot up shooter.   All my Phoenix Suns tales have been awful.
Andre Iguodala would be the type of guy to ruin our fun.
"The Warriors are still in asset accumulation mode post-KD leaving. There's not a single player on their roster that's untouchable outside of Steph, Klay, and Dray, and that's honestly being a little kind to Klay and Draymond (neither of them are on positive value contracts).   They've turned Andre Iguodala, their 2021 first, and their 2025 first-round pick into Wiggins, Oubre, and the 2021 Minnesota first-round pick, with the real gem of those assets being that Minnesota 1st.   The Warriors are still big game hunting, they want to get another star. Wiggins' purpose is to be the salary filler in that trade, and they're hoping that they could improve his trade value and TBH they've probably succeeded in that endeavor with the way people are talking about him.   And on the court, LaMelo fits Steph and Klay like a glove, he's a playmaker that likes to set up his teammates. He could've been on offense what Iguodala was for them for so many years."
"The question is if he is better than Magic Johnson. Some of his own teammates do not think so, such as Andre Iguodala, who has stated Curry is the second best Pg of all time behind Magic."
"The You Cant Fucking Recycle That Name, Stop It All Stars  ""Melo"" Ball   ""AI"" Andre Iguodala  ""LT"" LaDanian Tomlinson  ""Bad Boys II"" 00 Pistons  ""Dream Team 2"" 96 Olympic team  ""Superman"" Dwight Howard  ""A-Rod"" Andy Roddick"
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
This can literally be true of everyone in this draft. He has all the talent in the world to be the best big in the league. That's all you can really ask for in a prospect.   For me the best rookie this season has been Haliburton. The kid is just a winner. Reminds me a lot of Andre Iguodala.
ANDRE IGUODALA
Lebron’s not the VP anymore. Andre Iguodala is
Andre iguodala
"One low-key seller is Golden State, I think.  They are going to do everything they can to move Kelly Oubre before the trade deadline.  His game is just not a good fit for the way the warriors play.  It's a classic case of a good player, in the wrong system for his skills.  De'angelo Russell was the same thing last year.  They didn't acquire Russell to keep him, they acquired him to not lose KD for nothing and to flip him.  I think they did the same thing with Oubre: they didn't acquire him to keep him, they acquired him to not lose the trade exception from the Andre Iguodala trade for nothing, and to flip him."
"You mean the team with Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, and Andrew Bogut?"
Personally i would take andre iguodala
https://www.google.lv/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/george-karl-continues-to-imply-andre-iguodala-was-mark-jacksons-mole-in-2013-warriors-nuggets-playoff-series/amp/
"Yeah, because Andre Iguodala doesn't have actual reasons to walk proud. Get over yourselves."
"It started with something seemingly innocent. During our 2013 playoff series against GSW, Andre Igudola decided to pray with Jackson and the Warriors team all series, instead of with our team. That's not something anyone holds against them.  After Game 5, Mark Jackson stated that he believed the Nuggets were sending hitmen after Curry. This play was referenced. Jackson believed that we were playing dirty, not hard. he must have forgot about this play.  Mark Jackson insinuated that he had a ""mole"" within the Nuggets team, that was telling him they were targeting Curry. That mole was clearly identified as Iguodala, who went to Golden State that off season.  To add to everything, Igoudala's cousin sat conveniently behind GSW owner Lacob during the series, telling him how much Igoudala liked the Warriors organization.  Because of all this, there's a lot of hate for Iguodala within the Nuggets fanbase.   from Philly after being considered the ‘most hated athlete in town’  And obviously the Grizz saga. Kudos to the guy for being a great player and making a lot of money, but he is hated by three fanbases, and for good reason. Defending him is not the hill I’d like to die on."
Yeah but I’m going to assume someone who is 20-30 years older than me wants me to know how much of an impact Walton had on the 1986 celtics just like I want the wee lad I’ll talk to in 20-30 years to know about how important bosh or Andre iguodala had in the 2010s. That’s only taking into account serious bbbal talks. Furrowed brows and all.
Andre Iguodala: played in the finals last season  Dillon Brooks: didn’t

Andre Iguodala having flashbacks.
wahhhh wahhhh im andre iguodala i cant play the basketball that im getting paid $17m to play because i'm not close enough to curry to suck his dick every day
Hear me out though.....Andre Iguodala
"&gt;Semantics are quite literally the only reason Lebron didn't win that award. He averaged 36-13-9 with his two best teammates out due to injury and took them to 6 games on his back.  Semantics? What semantics? Its an unwritten rule dude. He lost so he doesn't get the award. Those aint semantics lmao.     &gt;If you wanna argue about who should win it from the winning team, it's Iggy, and no amount of revisionist history will change that.   &gt;   &gt; ""Listed at 125-1 odds before the series, Iguodala became the Warriors' most important two-way player, making it not even a question that he'd receive the award over regular-season MVP Stephen Curry""  It's pretty much universally agreed upon that Iggy didn't deserve it, Curry did. Even Iggy probably agrees. Take Curry off of the 2015 team and they lose in 4. Take Iggy off of the 2015 team and it goes to game 7, 50/50 odds. Lebron still averaged 36 or something ridiculous. Sure, he was inefficient but he was inefficient because he took so many shots. Why did he take so many shots? Because there was nobody else to take them. Andre did as good a job as one can on Lebron but he barely dented him. He made smart rotations, good plays, made smart gambles and occasionally clamped him up. Lebron still nearly averaged a 36 point triple double in a loss. It feels like you're just hating on Steph for whatever reason."
[here’s an article on it.](https://mashable.com/2013/10/10/twitter-andre-iguodala-nba/) it was actually his brand consultant/business manager that gave it to him
"Dude, *I'm* qualified to be a starter, because the only qualifications to start in the NBA are things like ""you have to be over 19 and a year out of high school"".  I'm not *good enough*, but that's a different question.  Kelly Oubre is not good enough to take a starting spot from Klay Thompson, and it's a problem that he thinks he's too good to come off the bench. He's not better than Andre Iguodala. He's also not better than Manu Ginobili was, when he started coming off the bench.  Given the degree to which the biggest problem with his play is BBIQ, it's a real problem that he's apparently *not smart enough to come off the bench*."
"Yeah, you want to see a guy winning too do anything to help his team win, look no further than Andre Iguodala. I mean, just look how absolutely committed he was and how he played his heart out in Memphis last year..."
"Andre ""Group Economics"" Iguodala"
It would be very different if they asked a 25 year old Andre Iguodala going into unrestricted free agency for the first time to come off the bench for a borderline playoff team.
andre iguodala who had already signed a huge contract and played years in the league collecting money?  different situations.  i'm not surprised oubre doesn't want to come off the bench as a young player looking to make a name for himself.  just because he's not as good as klay doesn't mean he has to be cool coming off the bench for a team he only knows as the 10th seed.
"How about if I phrase it a different way? Winning the Finals MVP means you only have to play well enough for the winning team in a series for 4-7 games, winning the regular season MVP means you need to play well for a full season. Which is why Andre Iguodala, Cedric Maxwell, or a pre-prime Kawhi could win the award."
Elton Brand &amp; Andre Iguodala
"LMA was not an all star lol, thanks for exposing yourself, player efficiency?  Exposing yourself even further dumbfuck, imagine comparing a dude like LMA to a finals MVP like Andre Iguodala."
"Yeah I don't know why I even bother, Jamal Crawford won that award over Andre Iguodala and Taj Gibson, that's all that has to be said about this ""award"""
"After a mediocre Jamal Crawford season beat out Andre Iguodala, we all have to accept that 6MOY is basically ""bench scorer of the year"" award.  I doubt we'll see a guy like Bill Walton win it again."
"&gt;Warriors were without one of their greatest weapons  That's right, all they had were Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston. I can't see a team with those players really achieving much. No idea how the Blazers couldnt beat that team"
Andre Iguodala needed in this Warriors team.
"What if I told you that the value you can get in a trade with another team is also dependent on where the pick is in the draft, so the exact same problem applies?  Not only that, but we actually did trade some of them for a guy who you may have heard of named Andre Iguodala. Which is why it was only 4 picks in the dynasty years 2013-2018 instead of the 12 you normally get, none of which were higher then 28th overall and we did hit on one of those in Kevon Looney (Unless you're arguing that our picks the last 2 years were airballs which is dumb since they mostly look good given their age and experience, or you're talking about the Patrick McCaw and Jordan Bell picks which we essentially got for free)."
"Because the Warriors didn't have any picks in the 2014 draft, they had traded their pick for Andre Iguodala so Jokic was never an option."
"Fun fact: LeBron James and Andre Iguodala are the only players in NBA history to never commit a single foul. The refs haven’t seen it that way, but it’s true."
Suns are far from the days of facing intern coach Andre Iguodala
"I've been a Warriors fan for almost 30 years, I don't really give a fuck what you think you know about how I view the team I love.  And defense? That's your hail mary for trying to downplay Steph Curry? That's beyond sad my guy. You're over here trying to argue Iguodala and Klay's greatness when the narrative in 2015 was all about how Dray, Klay and Andre were all ""system players getting carried by Curry and would be average on any other team."" Especially the hate Klay got for being ""nothing but a spot up shooter that cant create his own shot and would never be close to a 1st option on any team."" But I don't expect you to remember any of that cause I know you started watching basketball after 2016.  And for your stupid ass comment around ""ruining the integrity of the game;"" that tells me everything i need to know about your knowledge of basketball...ANY GM worth their salt goes and tries to get the best available player in FREE AGENCY if they can...and that's what ours did. If a KD is availble and you have the means to get him, you do it, or your FO is fucking hot garbage."
"AC Green, 3x champion with the Lakers  Danny Ainge, 2x champion with the Celtics and played on 2 other finals teams outside of the Celtics  Vlade Divac  Andre Iguodala for obvious reasons  Kermit Washington"
Tyler Johnson &gt; Andre Iguodala
Lebron lost in 6 shooting &lt;40% in the 2015 finals. Guess he didn’t even go “toe to toe” with Finals MVP Andre “Iwant” Iguodala.
"Have we already forgotten Bob Myers drafted Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, signed Steph Curry to a bargain contract allowing them to sign Kevin Durant and create maybe the best team the league has ever seen?  Not to mention found someone to take on the awful contract of Andris Biendrins in order to sign Andre Iguodala.  Not to mention managing to snag D'Lo when KD left and then flipping D'Lo for Wiggins and a pick?   Is he the best?  Idk.  But David Griffin makes your list and Bob Myers doesn't?"

"Ingles crossed my mind as a second tier IQ player. A level headed, smart, unselfish guy you can trust to always make the right decision. Much like an Andre Iguodala."
Hijacking this to say that Andre Iguodala should open a basketball themed barbecue joint after retirement and name it Entree Piguodala's BBIQ
Sure but you cannot tell me Andre Iguodala was the best player on the Warriors in 2015. Sometimes people win because their team is good not because they are. I agree that advanced stats aren’t perfect but they are better than rings at least as determining factors since they actually use numbers not just subjective opinions
"Superteam has always meant a superteam and 2 other all stars. You're attempting to change the definition because you're a LeBron hater, clown.   6MOTY is a borderline meaningless award for volume scorers off the bench. Jamal Crawford won the shit over Iguodala when he wasn't half the player. Schroder and Harrell aren't borderline all stars or anything, they're flawed volume scorers who aren't elite contributors to a championship team. The fact that you consider Andre Drummond an all star level player tells me you don't have a single clue what you're talking about."
"In the 2016 NBA Finals, LeBron took one of the most important shots in basketball history over Andre Iguodala. The Warriors had a 3-1 lead in that series, but LeBron willed his team to greatness, Kyrie started to deliver, and the Warriors were losing a step due to getting banged up, aided in a large part by LeBron's aggressive and physical defense, and Harrison Barnes did his best Game 7 Starks immitation over the last three games, but they were still dangerous, they were still in the game, and they were still favorites despite everything.  Andre Iguodala is one of the greatest one on one defenders basketball has ever known. Come playoff time, he is the guy that can see the cracks in the defense and fill that gap with ridiculous mobility and skill. He won a Finals MVP on that skill, somewhat successfully aimed at LeBron.  As LeBron was about to release, let's take a deep rewind on LeBron's jumper.  Young LeBron sucked at shooting. We're talking ""very young"", since he entered the league at 18. It didn't matter, because he was just that good. It didn't matter also because his team was just that bad so he was going to do his thing and it would be the best for his team. But what made it really not matter was that no opponent could deny him his bread and butter.  So in 2007, the Cavs had only one card to play: give ball to LeBron. Now, a young LeBron James was a freakish athlete, and could already pick a part a defense when going downhill. At 22, he was already one of the best players in basketball. The two major knocks people had on his game? Two skills: the post up, and the jumper. Everything other than that he was already an outlier due to being not only one of the greatest athletes ever, but also because of his exceptional mind for the game.  Since basketball is perhaps the only major sport where one man can just take over, giving the ball to LeBron was a very, *very* good card for the Cavs to play.  It got them to the finals.  Yes, the East was weak, as the Celtics were one year from the Big 3, the Bulls didn't have Rose yet and Orlando were just figuring things out. The Pistons were physically done. LeBron was too athletic, had too much energy, was too relentless. The Cavs gave him the ball over and over, and he won that series. It remains one of the most extreme carry jobs ever.  Facing them were the meatgrinder that were the Spurs at the height of their power. The Tim Duncan Spurs had won less than 50 games in only one season. That was during the lockout, and they won the championship that year after shredding through everyone. A fifty win season in that two decade stretch was considered a *failure*. There was no such thing as not making the playoffs.  They were bigger, stronger, tougher, and smarter than more or less everyone. They had who is now considered by many one of the greatest coaches (if not The greatest) in the history of basketball in Greg Poppovich. They were battle tested multiple time champions, having fought through everything the league had to offer year after year. They were better than the Cavaliers at everything except ""having LeBron James"".  Poppovich built The Wall. Three people between LeBron and the rim, completely smothering his lanes by putting too much muscle even for LeBron to plow through. Short of LeBron reliably hitting his shots away from the rim, someone else on that terrible Cavs team was going to have to win the series.  It did not go well.  The Spurs dismantled the Cavs with contemptuous ease. LeBron couldn't shoot, the rest of the team was bad, and the help defense was Tim Duncan. It's not a knock on any player or any team in history losing to a team like that. They were a force of nature.  But even for a sweep, it was absolutely brutal. It wasn't a fair contest. You could give the Cavs 10 games and they probably wouldn't have won any. Against a team with the greatest stretch of dominance other than the Michael Jordan era Bulls, the Showtime Lakers, and the Russell Celtics, at their best, nothing was going to matter. They could force LeBron away from the rim, and the only card the Cavaliers had to play was rendered toothless. He still put up numbers, but there was no winning strategy behind those points, only the best he could do.  It was hard to watch.  It was, to someone who can only be described as insanely dedicated to winning, probably much harder to live through. What the Bad Boys did to MJ, the Spurs did to LeBron. They exposed a weakness in his game had cost him what he really wanted - the chance to win. He immediately got to work on fixing that. At first, it was only to force teams to play honest defense against him. But after he started taking charge of the Miami offense he had figured out his spots. He was extending his range, improving his reliability, becoming less position dependent, and you can see it in his shooting stats across the board.   In 2015, largely because of Andre Iguodala's defensive performance, his jumper was questioned yet again - someone just kept getting in his face and his percentage dropped. This cannot be any more of an understatement, but LeBron really doesn't like losing. People in the media kept pointing out his finals record over and saying he just loses. After his fifth straight finals, people were finding reasons to doubt him. He used that as even more motivation.  In the following season, that shot became a true elite weapon. More than percentage, it was reliability. This didn't really have much of an impact in the regular season, because LeBron treats the regular season as summer league, and at this point he was focused on a championship.  They made the finals with ease. And this time, LeBron was hitting the shots that Iguodala took away last series. And when he took that shot - you can make a case that what started in 2007 finally ended, as he had beat one of the strongest teams in history, his performance could be described as arguably the greatest single-player masterpiece in NBA history. The Warriors were *that* good. LeBron was even better.  In 2017, LeBron tried hitting that shot again in a pivotal game three, and it was Andre Iguodala, remembering that specific move and having practiced specifically for it, who evaporated the Cavaliers hopes of a repeat with one of the greatest defensive stops in finals history, as the Warriors took their vengeance, in maybe the strongest season of basketball ever played.  tl;dr: Zion is actually shooting better from mid-range than LeBron was at that age."
Right because a player like Andre Iguodala didnt help the warriors after his superstar days.. Lol.    You dont know basketball kid.
"That are realistically going anywhere?  Lowry, DeRozan, Oubre, Otto Porter, Dinwiddie  Kawhi could go somewhere if the Clippers flame out badly again, but that’s doubtful.  Andre Iguodala probably comes back home, but that’s not really a big signing anymore lol"
Andre Iguodala
I feel like Rudy gay can be a Jae crowder/Andre iguodala type contributor for a contender.
"Oh yeah, forgot about that stretch without CP3.   I would argue though that Kerr puts the handbreak on Steph and doesn't allow him to play like Harden/Dame and spam PnRs all day because he's tied to his motion offense and using Steph off-ball, even though that's probably not the best way to maximize this group of players, that lacks the passing and IQ to play that style. You can't do the motion offense with Andrew Wiggins and Kelly Oubre instead of Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston.   Would love to see Steph play under MDA and be given free reign to do whatever he wants."
"Uh, first of all, there were plenty of possessions where the Cavs *didn't* hunt Curry for an ISO mismatch. There were plenty of times when they hunted other players or didn't go ISO hunting at all.  Second of all, yeah, of course they went for the clearest mismatch more often than not. That's just kind of a 'no shit' thing. Yes, Curry was a worse defender on LeBron than Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, or Andre Iguodala. Not really much shame in that."
"Ive always liked Andre ""last shot"" Iguodala, His athleticism was really cool to me, First time i seen him was when he was in the dunk contest and it was probably my favorite one to this day. Warriors is my favorite team so having him on there was 10x better ( one of the reasons why warriors were my favorite team). Iggy is just one of those guys who really helped the team and really fun to watch. He's just one of those guys you want on your team. Defense, athletic, IQ, And don't forget if it was for the fate of the earth and a death beam was pointed at me IGGY IS THE MAN TO TAKE THE LAST SHOT"
"sixers fans trying to downplay embiid so simmons can win DMVP, lol  Simmons might be the best perimeter defender in the league, but unless you're peak Kawhi, you aren't as valuable as an elite interior big.

"I think that was pre process years. We're talking about the Andre Miller, Dalembert and Iguodala years IIRC."
Or Andre Iguodala?
So did Andre Iguodala.
"&gt;Curry had 3 all stars on his team in Draymond, Klay and Iggy  It doesn't work like that. You don't say someone had all star teammates if they weren't selected as an all star that season.   For the 2015 championship season Stephen Curry played with exactly **one** All Star, Klay Thompson. Draymond Green had not any All Star selections yet and Andre Iguodala has had exactly **one** All Star selection in his career and it was 2012, three seasons before this run.  Stephen Curry was 100% the most important part of the Warriors from the start of the run until today. He was more important than KD, than Draymond, than Iguodala.   The only reason Curry was robbed of the FMVP was they voters did some kind of weird ""can't give it to a player on the losing team so we'll give it to the guy who guarded him,"" as LeBron's usage was very high and so were his counting stats. It is widely regarded as a flubbed vote.   If you go by the numbers, eye test, accomplishments, anyway you slice it Stephen Curry is one the best active players and will go down as one of the best to ever play.   The fact that LeBron stans and Harden stans hate him so much and always try to tear him down ironically reveals just how impactful he is.   So keep talking shit about Curry and telling us all how much you fear and resent him."
Andre Iguodala
Andre Iguodala
"I think you're looking at it from the wrong angle. that's all those guys should be doing. their role was defined by their skillsets being limited. if you've ever seen Danuel House try and move around the court or dribble a basketball, you'll know why he shouldn't be doing much more than standing on the 3pt line. same goes for PJ Tucker, and even Eric Gordon.  &amp;#x200B;  they didn't have any intelligent playmakers on the team. they were consistently signing minimum guys and pulling up from the G League (House, Mclemore) or finding guys that nobody else wanted (Rivers, Green, even Gordon) to avoid paying the tax.  &amp;#x200B;  [The Missing Piece the Rockets Need to Help James Harden - The Ringer](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/5/11/18616097/houston-rockets-missing-piece-james-harden)  &gt;The Rockets’ problem, especially in comparison to the  Warriors, is that they have never had players who combine both. They  have no one comparable to Andre Iguodala or Klay Thompson, much less  Draymond or Durant. None of their other shot creators are natural  pick-and-roll partners for a star guard. Golden State can switch a  screen between Harden and Gordon, Paul, or Rivers, and keep  similar-sized defenders on both players. They don’t have to worry about  any of those three attacking Harden’s defender on a switch. He is always  the one who has to create the mismatch, which wears him down during a  series. My guess is the primary cause of Harden’s history of fading in  the playoffs is his overwhelming offensive responsibility, not any flaw  in his character or his game.   &gt;   &gt;Harden doesn’t play with anyone who makes his life easier in the way Draymond and Durant do for Steph Curry. [The play that sealed Game 6 for Golden State](https://twitter.com/connectwidutpal/status/1127056521232175105)  (a Thompson 3 with 36 seconds left in the fourth quarter) summed up the  difference between the two teams. Houston blitzed a pick-and-roll  between Steph and Draymond, creating a four-on-three opportunity for  Draymond at the 3-point line. He drove into the lane and found Iguodala  in the corner, who then swung the ball to Thompson. There is no one on  the Rockets’ roster who can consistently make the play that Green did.  Draymond is a legitimate point forward. Neither Capela nor Tucker is  comfortable making plays off the dribble. The Warriors can overload to  stop Harden without worrying about any of his frontcourt players making  them pay for it.  this is a really good article that highlights the difference between the Rockets and, say, the Warriors. it's not like Harden wouldn't of rather had other lineups, it's that for what the Rockets were willing to spend they were never going to get guys who were more capable of doing anything other than 3&amp;D."
And Andre Iguodala
"Between Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, and Steph Curry...give me Andre Iguodala"
Andre Iguodala
"Nash didn't win a ring either.  The point is, you can shit on any player, even Kareem, Lebron, and Jordan. If you selectively shit on players because they were never put in the right position to succeed, then you probably don't even like basketball- you just like drama.   CP3 is undeniabley better than guys like Tony Parker, Andre Iguodala, Chauncey Billups, etc. The fact that people *choose* to define him in the worst way possible illustrates how obsessed so many fans are with drama and hyperbole."
Andre Iguodala
I rode in an elevator with Andre Iguodala. Beanpole thin in person.
"I think that's overstating it a bit for the Eastern Conference. Definitely more true in the West at that time though.  -  Eastern Conference centers in the playoffs that season:  * Chicago: Joakim Noah * Miami: Joel Anthony * Boston: Jermaine O'Neal * Orlando: Dwight Howard * Atlanta: Al Horford * New York: Amare Stoudemire * Philadelphia: Elton Brand * Indiana: Roy Hibbert  -  Eastern Conference small forward in the playoffs that season:  * Chicago: Luol Deng  * Miami: LeBron James * Boston: Paul Pierce * Orlando: Hedo Turkoglu * Atlanta: Josh Smith * New York: Carmelo Anthony * Philadelphia: Andre Iguodala * Indiana: Danny Granger  -  The centers are hit-or-miss, but the SFs are absolutely stacked."
Andre Iguodala has a fmvp
That's NBA Finals MVP Andre Iguodala to you
"Send CJ to the Celtics in a deal for Marcus Smart. Throw a bag at Danny Green, Andre Iguodala, and Richaun Holmes. Make some other moves with their younger guys.  Starting Lineup would be Dame, Smart, Covington, Holmes and Nurkic with Green, Iggy and Melo on the bench. Are they top contenders? No but defensively they are much improved."
I still can’t believe we watched the Heat set a double screen for Andre Iguodala to take a pull up J and it went in lmfao
Andre Iguodala would like to have a word.
"I can see what you are getting at but DeMar DeRozan has been a beast in his NBA career.  The Raptors were consistently good because of him, and now he is leading the Spurs to a play-in spot in the West. He has been great for so long, but unfortunately, he had to play LeBron in the playoffs for most of his career. It is hard putting Andre Iguodala in the 100-150 spot, but because of his finals MVP, it's kind of a must for me. If Curry were to have won it, which he 100% should have, Andre Igoudala is nowhere near my top 150 players of all time."
All time rankings are hard and after the top 100 its basically impossible but some of these guys like DeMar DeRozan I have a hard time seeing being top 100-150 players in NBA history. Someone like Andre Iguodala I can get why some might argue it but even that gets tough.
"Type of dude to drive right and put it up with his left hand. Or attempt outlet passes deep underneath the hoop time and time and again when the passing lane is nowhere to be found. I mean, I don’t necessary find all of these things too troubling with him in the sense that, I’ve never perceived him to round out much more than a 2b or six man so to speak caliber player... a lazy comparison would be Andre Iguodala (though I’m not really altogether comparing their games, just that sort of potential utility to a championship caliber team type player. Which, may be a bit too flattering for him if I’m to be honest, but I honestly couldn’t read the tea leaves altogether for him, though my suspicion is that he simply doesn’t have all the cards in the deck to put things together all that much beyond what we’ve seen of his skills thus far. But he’s young, and he’s got an incredible build, and most importantly, the kid is super humble and won’t let his ego get in the way of team contribution. I don’t get the feeling for instance, that say were Randle to have not exerted his clear top dawg position within the team this year, he would be making it a point to make sure he did so himself. Not even sure where I’m going with all this tbh, just that the kid’s honestly grown on me and he’ll always catch daps for that “yooo I’m a knick” shit alone. Shit, I would have been like, “fuck I’m a knick...”. In the end, like I said, I won’t profess to read the teas with his future, but if he can in any small way become even a shade of that Iguodala eschelon + added caliber player, that’s a big win. League can always do with more or them folk - less of the Carmelo Anthony types. One type of player contributes to something bigger, the other don’t."
"KD wasn’t blessed with the talent that the Warriors surrounded Steph with after 2012. The man had Andre Roberson shoot 2-12 in game 7 of the 2016 finals, his team outside of him shot 34% that game. Y’all want to talk about how winning is a team game, yet crown the man who has never won a finals mvp for winning more than KD.   So what, that finals was just entirely narrative driven? There was no substantial difference at all between the Warriors in the first 3 games when they went down 2-1 to a team whose second leading scorer was Timofey Mozgov vs when Iguodala started and became significantly more prominent in the offense? I’m not saying he was a better player, but he won the finals mvp for a reason. You can cry about media bias or narratives like most Curry fans, but there’s a significant overlap between media members who didn’t vote for Curry for finals mvp in 2015 and who did vote for him for regular season mvp the same year.   Finals MVP isnt ceiling raising???? Having the highest output on your team in a literal nba finals isn’t ceiling raising??? What????? Gravity allows for Steph to raise the floor of his team, that’s the entire purpose of raising the floor... making teammates outperform situations they wouldn’t have otherwise outperformed in. Chris Paul is a floor raiser because he makes everyone play better. The same is true for Curry and his gravity, as well as the fact that he is the offensive focal point. A ceiling raiser is someone that, given a circumstance, raises the upper bounds of the highest possible outcome. We have seen obvious limits to ceilings to teams with Curry and no KD, even if that ceiling is much higher than most stars in the league. Curry operates as a good offensive system, one of the better offensive systems that we’ve seen in NBA history. You can plug KD into literally any offensive system in NBA history, and that offense becomes substantially better. One of those things I just described is a floor raiser, one is a ceiling raiser.   So why did Durant average more assists in the 2018 finals if it was all Curry being doubled and KD getting no special defensive treatment? All hockey assists from Curry, right???? Even though the stats don’t back that up. KD generated more points, but off assists and scoring, in both the 2017 and 2018 NBA finals than Curry did... but it was Curry actually generating more!!"
"For context, a couple of players that shoot about 3 3s a game at \~33% are Solomon Hill, Andre Iguodala, and Dejounte Murray."
"Andre ""stopped LeBron from averaging 40ppg"" Iguodala"
"Okay so he's been top 3 in WS, WS/48, BPM, PER, VORP, RAPTOR, RPM, and RAPTOR WAR. RAPM is the only statistic that has that opinion and frankly is not a very good statistic for comparing players. According to RAPM the best player in the league in 2018-2019 was Danny Green. In 2017-2018 it was Robert Covington. In 2013-2014 the best player in the league was Andre Iguodala. My favorite though has to be in 2009-2010 when Anderson Varejao was the 2nd best player in the league according to RAPM. Clearly RAPM is either not made for comparing players or is completely useless because I don't think anyone is going to agree with any of these players rankings."
Andre Iguodala and Kawhi Leonard enter the chat
"I don't think why the Warriors suffer in a world with 90's rules. You can't go zone or send super hard doubles against KD or Steph. Now Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Shaun Livingston all get to handcheck on the perimeter? You have to keep in mind as well that KD/Klay/Andre are all very big relative to their position in the 90's."
"Andre Iguodala when AI left the Sixers.  He was a well-above-average overall player and was a great player &amp; help on the Warriors, but the man is not a scorer or at the very least, not a first option scorer."
My man wanted Andre Iguodala to take those 12 shots lol
"My transition was pretty smooth. I went straight from college to the Olympic team with Bron, Melo, Kobe, Tyson Chandler, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Andre Iguodala, Chris Paul. I was able to be around these guys 24/7 for about two months, and learn a lot from them.   My “welcome to the league” moment was when we played Indiana at home during my rookie year. They had PG, Lance Stephenson, David West, Roy Hibbert, all those guys. David West just lit me up. I couldn’t stop him. I was so frustrated. He went to the same move, over and over. Literally 5 times in a row. Just caught the ball, jab, jumper from the elbow. I couldn’t stop it. That’s when I knew the league was for real."
Again Joe Dumars was the All NBA player and the FMVP in 89.  He was clearly better than Zeke it's not like that was an Andre Iguodala situation.  Dumars was the better 2 way player.  People have a revisionist history on Isiah Thomas that seriously needs to get checked.  The guy wasn't even a top ten player in the league by the time the Pistons were winning titles.  Watch the games check the numbers.  The guy just wasn't the best player.  Second best sure.  At times other guys stepped up as well.  Just ignore that Detroit were the deepest team of the 80s.
"What made Andre Iguodala was his basketball IQ, awareness on the court, and ability to make adjustments. Wiggins has the body, but he has a long way to reach Andre Iguodala level mentally on the basketball court."
He’s only 26 too. I can see him having an Andre Iguodala type career for sure
And Andre Iguodala was that difference thanks for proving my point!
Anyone saying Luc was equal to Andre Iguodala is out of their mind.  Year in and year out Steph does y’all dirty and every year there is an excuse. How about y’all just make a shot
"Allen Iverson and Andre Iguodala to referee NBA Finals, you heard it here first folks!"
"It's happened before, here's an example I can remember, where Andre Iguodala got ejected for throwing a ball into the stands:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3tjm528RZI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3tjm528RZI)  Iguodala tried to argue that he was attempting to beat the halftime buzzer, but it was very clearly in frustration, and the refs kicked him out of the game for the 2nd half. Hear what the announcers say, ""Warriors had a 17 point advantage"", ~~but are down 2 at the half,~~ so yeah, Iguodala was pissed off. Very similar situation to what happened to Luka tonight.  Edit, oh whoops, read the score wrong. Maybe I'm the drunk one..."
"You wanted to talk about Lue having LeBron so I thought I’d remind you who Steve Kerr’s had.  - Michael Jordan  - Scottie Pippen  - Dennis Rodman  - Tim Duncan  - David Robinson  - Toni Kukoc  - Brad Daugherty  - Larry Nance Sr.  - Tony Parker  - Manu Ginobili  - Shawn Kemp  - Steve Smith  - Shaquille O’Neal  - Tom Chambers  - Steve Nash  - Amar’e Stoudemire  - Steph Curry  - Klay Thompson  - Kevin Durant  - Andre Iguodala  - Greg Popavich  Odds are I missed some names but if you want to say Lue had help then Steve Kerr had help with a capital H, E, L and P."
He probably wants Andre Iguodala taking the last 3
"the argument was that kerr inserting andre into the starting lineup was what changed the series. iirc there was a stark difference in lebrons counting stats and efficiency before and after game 3, and iguodala himself elevated his counting stats in the last 3 games. still definitely a narrative and curry was 100% the best player on the dubs during that series, but that was the justification at the time"
"That's one of the only years I can remember where the overwhelming best player on the winning team didn't win the award. 1981 Larry Bird and 1988 Magic might have a case but at least Cedric Maxwell and James Worthy scored more than Bird and Magic respectively. And obviously Jerry West  when he won FMVP in a losing effort. There really was no argument for Iguodala over Curry, even Lebron had more of an argument than Andre."
"Yup. NBA just doesn't really see much star free agency movement (especially when you exclude the players that are moving to create super teams with whoever currently has cap space, and look instead solely at the players that moved for the destination).  Biggest name that moved in free agency in the past decade that wasn't moving to create/join a super team is probably Al Horford to Boston, Terry Rozier to the Hornets, or Andre Iguodala to the Warriors. edit: LaMarcus Aldridge to the Spurs."
Like a ten-fold Andre Iguodala in Philly post Iverson
"At one point, if you were going to guard Curry, that meant you would fight through an Andrew bogut screen followed by a Draymond Green or Andre iguodala screen. Almost every play.   Fuck that's gotta hurt"
"Even Andre Iguodala called Kellerman crazy over this statement. ""It is true that Iguodala has knocked down some huge shots over his career but he’s a career 33.3% shooter (0.9 on 2.7 attempts per game), while Curry shoots 43.5% from deep per his career on 8.9 three-pointers per game.""(Ernesto Cova; In NBA Media) No disrespects to Iguodala, but I'd go for Klay to take the shot over him too."
"it was said by former Nugget JR Smith   i really do get it and i’m pretty sure a decent amount of players agreed, or at least completely understood what he was saying   i am in absolutely no situation asking andre iguodala to shoot a basketball before steph curry, but JR might lol"
"Mine’s DWade, his speed and ability to shift the direction and finishing ability. Then Tony Allen, Andrei Kirilenko, KG, Jrue Holiday, Andre Iguodala, Ben Wallace, Nikola Jokic all tied for second."
Guys calm down he obviously meant Andre Iguodala when he said AI /s
"My MEAT top 5 (in no particular order)  Nique, AI, T Mac, Prime Blake, Steph  &amp;#x200B;  Honorable mention to Andre Iguodala.  Between the dunks, celebrations, and some of his funny dribbles up the court in transition he's one of my favorites."
Andre Iguodala really stepped up in Season 3 from being a recurring character
"17 is a relatively small number.  His stats may look less impressive without the games he started in, but his contributions are still as important as any other bench player in the league.  It's like how Andre Iguodala was robbed of a 6MOY because voters got lazy and gave the award to bench scorer Jamal Crawford in one of his least effective seasons.  Edit: saw that you made the same point about Iggy lol"
Today I learned Andre The FMVP Iguodala was drafted by the Warriors
ANDRE IGUODALA
Andre “Group Economics” Iguodala
I've seen Iverson listed as a shooting guard on basketball reference and a few other places like 2k And I don't know if I would consider him a 2 guard. I'm from the philly area and I've been to many sixer's games during his time with the sixers and he really didn't play the 2 in my mind.  He didn't guard the other teams shooting guard And in his rookie year stackhouse was the starting shooting guard. Then you had Eric snow and I guess this is where the idea that he was a shooting guard and because of Eric snow  did a lot of the ball handing and usually covered the other teams two guard or Aaron McKee. Then they drafted Andre iguodala And he was a shooting guard pretty much until he went to Denver and started playing small forward.  I don't know I think maybe we try to put too much emphasis on positions like Tim Duncan He's considered a power forward and played they're mostly when David Robinson was there then he played more center especially in crunch time I'm sure if you look up the minutes that him and AI played It was mostly at point guard and for Duncan center. Maybe I'm just being a stickler but I never really considered Iverson a two guard.
"Anybody who says “Curry cost them defensively every night” has literally no clue what they’re talking about. Curry is an above average defender for his position. He got bad press as a defender in the 2016 Finals where he was switched onto every possession because he was next to Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Andrew Bogut, and Andre Iguodala.  You say that like Curry is so bad defensively that he’s actually a negative on the floor despite his scoring 😂 watch some games bro"
"I also agree that he should have won the finals MVP in 2015, unfortunately if he never gets one it is going to be something that holds him back NBA all-time rankings I would argue even if 2015 went the way it did with Andre Iguodala winning the MVP of the finals, if Curry had finished the job as he should have in 2016 and somehow pulled off 2019, both with finals MVPs, there are people who would say he's top 10 and possibly even above Magic"
"Kawhi Leonard is tough because I know he has Defensive Player of the Year Awards, but he's not somebody that anybody saw being a superstar right away, even his first Finals MVP you can make a case that could have gone to two other people on his team ( I myself would have given it to Duncan), and I don't think he truly became a great, franchise-changing player until the 2015/16 season, I think he's just barely passed 10,000 points now, he led an all-time great playoff run which had people calling him the best player in the NBA, a status he lost the very next postseason by blowing a 3-1 lead and choking in game 7, and even though he's chilled out on some of the load management this year I don't think he's ever going to be in position to win an MVP so his legacy is going to be built on all NBA teams and winning , so I could see him being on anybody's list anywhere in between 25-40 all time              I understand Andre Iguodala was a very valuable piece to the Warriors Dynasty and even to Miami getting the finals last year, and even though Max Kellerman turned him into some kind of a meme he does seem to be unusually clutch, but the conversation around Andre Iguodala reminds me of the one that's also being had about Julian Edelman in the NFL, grade intangibles in the playoffs and even though I don't think Andre Iguodala deserved his Finals MVP he has it, not a Hall of Famer              In the case of Giannis Antetokounmpo, top 10 power forward already, I'm comfortable saying that I just don't know where to rank him right now, he's been in the league longer than I thought, he has to get it together in the playoffs, I'm curious as to how he does this playoffs"
"Multiple players have held out, the most notable being Andre Iguodala with the Grizzlies last year. Horford is holding out. Also Kyrie and KD have both missed games this year just because so it's not unheard of."
Andre Iguodala was more important to the Warrior's dynasty than Draymond.
"come on guy, do you really think that Andre Iguodala would have had the impact necessary to prevent Houston winning two games by 3 and 4 points respectively? when has Iggy ever had that sort of significant impact on a playoff series? he's not some sorta Confrence Finals MVP type of player!  we gotta focus on the what ifs!"
For Curry it should be Andre Iguodala. His closest friend in the league. And then Steph can be the guy for Klay and if Draymond gets in
"First of all I WANT IGUODALA  Second of all, you've gotta actually be in the game for that game winning shot to even matter, so Steph all day. Every day. Except for when Martians are invading then Andre."
I honestly think Iguodala gets really underrated as a perimeter defender. He shaved significant numbers off of the percentages of LeBron and Harden. I'd feel perfectly comfortable putting 2014-17 Andre on an island against pretty much any elite wing player in the history of the league.  Another thing to consider: imagine if Andre had gotten to play in the era of handchecking.
Steph Curry  Klay Thompson   Kobe Bryant  Michael Jordan  Kevin Durant  Draymond Green  Andre Iguodala  Demar Derozan  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Dirk Nowitzki
"Lakers got Dwight Howard, Sixers got Andrew Bynum, Magic got Aaron Afflalo, Denver got 1 yr of Andre Iguodala. All team lost in d trade."
Andre Iguodala in 2015
"Just throw a golden oldies squad out there:  **Guards:** Kyle Lowry, Rajon Rondo, George Hill, Wes Matthews, Lou Williams, JJ Redick.  **Forwards:** Andre Iguodala, Carmelo Anthony, Paul Millsap, PJ Tucker, Trevor Ariza, Jared Dudley, Al Horford.   **Centres:** Dwight Howard, Taj Gibson.  Lowry, Redick, Iguodala, Melo, Dwight.   Rondo, Matthews, Tucker, Millsap, Horford.   Hill, Lou Will, Ariza, Dudley, Gibson."
Andre Iguodala&gt;Chris Paul confirmed
Does Finals MVP ever determine who the better player is? Is Andre Iguodala better than Curry?
If you’re a fan of Andre Iguodala or the Warriors he has a memoir called The Sixth Man. It was a good read for sure
"Andre Iguodala said Utah can “lull you to sleep” and make you think, “Man, let's just get out of here. '” Matt Barnes said “There's no nightlife in Utah.”  When asked about those comments later Klay Thompson said ""Boring people get bored."""
"LeBron got shitted on for losing to the Warriors in 2015 when he became the first player in NBA history to lead BOTH teams in points, rebounds and assists.  They named Andre Iguodala the MVP.  Some people think making the Finals and losing is somehow worse than losing in the 1st or 2nd round (ala Jordan).  People are weird."
That warriors team was also significantly worse than the previous year. Particularly the bench. Key guys like Andre Iguodala and Livingston had declined a fair amount
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Harrison Barnes, Draymond Green, Andrew Bogut, Leandro Barbosa, Shaun Livingston, Andre Iguodala, Marreese Speights, Festus Ezeli, Ian Clark, Brandon Rush, James Michael Mcadoo, Kevon Looney, Anderson Varejao  and Jason Thompson who got waived midseason."
"Bro Steph Curry hard as fuck. He literally killed my child in cold blood in the summer of 2015 and dared me to report it to the police.   I was staying at a nice beachside resort in Oakland, CA with my beautiful wife (F 24) and my immaculate daughter (F 73 months). We had been spending the days lounging on pool chairs and drinking bottomless mimosas. The television above the bar had been playing highlights of the local Warriors team (I'm not sure if you've heard of them but every TV in Oakland is actually required by law to play highlights at all times. Kinda crazy for such a small team). I've never been a big fan of the Warriors, and remarked so to my wife in passing. Little did I know that would be the moment my life changed forever.   The man behind the bar laughed at me after this comment and smirked to himself. ""The warriors are actually pretty good,"" he said, ""the kind of team that would never need super stars to join.""  I told him this was an outrageous claim and that their best player, Andre Iguodala, would never be enough to carry the team, especially with the worse of the Curry Brothers riding his coattails. My wife agreed and said that even our 73 month old daughter could see that.  The man laughed again and stepped out from behind the bar, drawing a gun. Point blank he shot three times into my darling daughter. I couldn't hear anything over my wife's screams. My blood was rushing in my ears and I felt like the world had fallen apart. The man stood over us and pushed back his hat to reveal that he was actually Stephen Curry (M 27) himself!   ""Listen chump, I'm gonna have to disagree with that assessment,"" he sneered, ""I'm definitely better than my brother Seth. And to prove that, I'm gonna go on to win 73 games this season in honor of your dumb daughter. And just when you think that nobody can stop me, I'm going to throw the finals to let you know that you lost the light of your life to a coattail riding loser. And one day, I'll come back for your wife's feet...""  Ever since that day, I've lived in constant fear of Steph Curry. I've moved out of California to Cleveland, but Lebron's move to LA, I'm not sure where I'm safe anymore and I don't know where to go. I fear for the day that Steph follows through on his promise to steal my wife's feet from under my nose.  So for those that think Steph Curry is soft or a loser, let this be a warning."
Wrong. Being the MVP means you have to play well for a full season. Being a Finals MVP just means you have to play well for 4-7 games. Andre Iguodala could never win a regular season MVP.
"Agreed. I've always believed Pierce is thought of so well now because of the FMVP, the fact that he's arguably the best Celtic since Bird and because he made all those All Star teams. But winning a FMVP doesn't mean you led a team to a title, just that the voters thought you were the best in one specific round (see Andre Iguodala, Chauncey Billups or even Kawhi in 2014). The Celtics are an iconic franchise with 17 titles, but if we're being real they haven't had many top tier all time greats since Bird anyway. And All Star selections are skewed by being in a weak conference, which Pierce definitely was.   Jokic is now an MVP winner, and AD has already finished higher in MVP voting three separate times than Pierce ever did in his career. Pierce never made 1st Team All NBA (AD has done it 4x, Jokic has done it once, and this year will be twice). Pierce actually only ever made 4 All NBA teams total (once on the 2nd team and 3x on the third). Pierce never made any All Defense teams, while AD has made 4 (2 on 1st and 2 on 2nd). It's really a no brainer that AD and Jokic should be above Pierce here. I asked the OP to explain Pierce over AD elsewhere in this thread but he never responded, so I'm not sure what his thought process was."
"He is an inconsistent *scorer*, he still brings it on defense and is a smart player. But his offensive game is all based around jumpers which is why he's streaky.   His man defense has also slipped from what it used to be, but again, he's still a smart player who is a great help defender and makes winning plays.   The PG that we see now is like this weird hybrid of Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala. Which is not good enough offensively to be the #2 on a championship team."

"[Andre Iguodala did not regress in 2017](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/andre-iguodala-is-not-an-afterthought/). KD had nearly **3x** as many win shares as Harrison Barnes in 2016, and far more than Speights, Barbosa, Livingston etc combined. The Heat, on the other hand, gave up basically every single player who was on their roster in 2009-2010. It would be more analogous to KD, Steph, and Draymond all joining the Knicks, or LeBron joining the KG/Pierce/Allen Celtics immediately following their 7 game loss in the Finals 2010.   I'm not disputing that LeBron kicked off this wave of forming superteams through free agency or strong-arming trades; that much is obvious and was virtually unprecedented when it happened in 2010. But saying KD did the exact same thing as LeBron, only better (which is what you implied) is pretty dubious."
"Yes. And I have maintained this for a long ass time, and a lot of people on this subreddit always argue with me when I say it.   And yes, before it's inevitably said, players have discussed who they want on their teams with their GM's, Barkley himself famously said as much when he was in Philly. But that on it's own is not a super team, even if his wish gets granted.   There are two types of teams that fans often conflate to be the same thing, and I maintain they aren't:    1 - **Super Teams:** Miami's Big 3, KD's Warriors, Brooklyn's Nets. That's it.   This is fairly simple to me, and there's only three instances of it existing. It requires all star players taking either paycuts, or using loopholes in the way the NBA contracts work to be able to make their team work even though in theory they should never be able to be on the same due to the size of the contracts they demand.   Coordinating in the off season, and taking paycuts with your friends so you can all strategically join one team is a super team.   - Lebron and Bosh took paycuts to make the money work out in Miami. [Source](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2010/07/10/lebron-james-dwyane-wade-chris-bosh-each-leave-15-million-on-the-table/) *""But they will be leaving $15 million on the table to play together. In the first year of their contract, Bosh and James will be making $14.5 million (Wade with $14 flat), nearly two million less than what they would have made base-year at the max (in a non-sign-and-trade). They’ll each receive 10.5% raises throughout the life of the contract.""*  - KD took a paycut to join the Warriors so they could keep Iggy paid. [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/07/why-kevin-durant-took-a-10-million-pay-cut-to-play-for-the-warriors.html) *""Kerr says Durant’s generous pay cut allowed the team to keep Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston, which will hopefully lead to Durant and the team winning more titles.""*   - KD forced the Nets/Warriors trade to be DLo in a sign and trade. [Source](https://nypost.com/2019/07/11/kevin-durant-refused-to-be-traded-straight-up-for-dangelo-russell/) *""As a result, Durant and the Nets owned the high ground and were able to leverage the Warriors into parting with their first round pick. In addition to the pick, the Nets forced the Warriors to take Shabazz Napier and Treveon Graham, giving them the extra cap space used to sign DeAndre Jordan, Durant’s good friend and key piece in luring him to Brooklyn.""*   2 -  **Teams w/ stars:** Celtics Big 3, Warriors Pre-KD, OKC  All of these teams are GM's doing their jobs well, and being rewarded for their efforts with fantastic teams. Drafting phenominally well, like in the case of OKC and GSW, or trading well and getting those players.   GM's being great GM's fits within the context of professional sports.   -----------------------------------------------------------  Players being their own GM's and orchestrating their situation how they want it is an overuse of power IMO, and an indictment on the leagues rules that these three super teams were even possible. Essentially forcing the GM's to almost not even be a factor in the decision making. Doing this to tag along with your friends is what makes these teams different then any other dominate team in NBA's history."
ALLTIME: Eric Snow  Current: Andre Iguodala
"""Eh, that award doesn't hold that much weight anymore. Doesn't Andre Iguodala have one?""  I can see it now, lol."
We literally had 36-year old Trevor Ariza and 37-year old Andre Iguodala playing major minutes in the playoffs this year.  I'll gladly take Bron as a fossil.
"$24m is a fucking bargain for a guy who still the best help defender in the league, one of the best overall defenders in the league, a guy who isn't just a great individual defender but tells his whole team where to be, calls out sets and coverages, etc.   It's a fucking bargain when that guy is also one of the best passing/play-making bigs in the league, not that far from LeBron in assist percentage (i.e. he's the guy racking up most of the assists while on the floor, helped by some Curry gravity of course).   Would you rather be paying...  $27.5m for Al Horford?  $31m for Kevin Love?  $28.5m for Otto Porter?  $19.2 for Gary Harris?  $36.6m for Blake Griffin (his salary this season before being bought out)  $15m for Andre Iguodala?  $17m for Rickey Rubio?  $24m for LMA, his salary before his heart issues forced him into early retirement?  Here, I'll even get controversial, is Russell Westbrook at $41m really more valuable than Draymond at $24m?  Draymond's extension was 100% team friendly."
2014-15 Finals MVP: Andre Iguodala  I guess Iggy &gt; Curry with your logic lmfao.
You could probably find like 30 clips of LeBron not getting back on defense after a no call. That's quite literally quitting on your team. Only difference is Rondo quit on offense. The Klay thing is just trash talk. If you're really trying to sit there and tell me LeBron has never trash talked in his career then there's really nothing I can tell you lol. Look up LeBron kicking Andre Iguodala in the nuts. Literally the exact same thing Draymond did to Steven Adams.
chalking it up to 'politics' is basically a pseudo-intellectual way of trying to brush off the fact that not everyone feels the same way about mark jackson that andre iguodala does lol
"https://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/stephen-curry-offered-to-take-less-than-max/385629  Stephen Curry, who recently signed a record five-year, $201 million deal, told Marcus Thompson II of The Athletic that he informed Warriors general manager Bob Meyers he would have taken less to help the team.  “I actually asked Bob, if I were to take a discount — at any number, I don’t know what it would be — how much of a difference would that make for us to be able to sign other guys,” Curry said. “It wasn’t like (Durant’s) situation. His had a direct impact on us being able to sign Andre (Iguodala) and Shaun (Livingston). And it was just an unbelievable sacrifice by KD. But mine didn’t matter.”"
Each of the last 30 NBA Finals series featured either:   Scottie Pippen  Robert Horry  David Robinson  Derek Fisher   Dwyane Wade  Andre Iguodala   With Andre out - the 2021 NBA Finals will be the first since 1990 not to feature at least one of those players.

Andre Iguodala won a Finals MVP
Ah yes Andre Iguodala &gt; Curry too!  Durant was only able to succeed because Curry draws so much attention and takes the pressure off.
&gt;not unlike Andre Iguodala  that double negative threw me off for a bit
"He's a streaky scorer, which is what everybody goes on and on about, but everybody forgets that when he's not scoring, he's still a smart basketball player that makes winning plays on both ends of the court, not unlike Andre Iguodala."
It's not good if he's your main perimeter playmaker or even your second best player. I think he would work a lot better in a Andre Iguodala role.
"Geez y’all are such prisoners of the moment .   Any time you take a talented player and ask him to do less, it’s a steal . Ie Andre iguodala as the best guy on a team was not ideal. But as the 4th option on the Warriors he’s a finals MVP and invaluable player   I say all that to say…fuck yes the Warriors trade Wiggins for KP. You serious? Lmao KP expected to be the 2nd best player is a let down. But KP as your 3rd best player—on a team with the exact opposite of Dallas as far as ball movement, as well as the shooting gravity of Steph and klay—-would make them favorites out west."
"Andre iguodala said that during the warrior runs, they started to feel almost relieved that they won the games they did instead of actually enjoying and feeling satisfied due to all the pressure on those teams.   Did you ever feel that toward the tail end of the Big 3 era that you could never sit back and appreciate the moment you were in or did it feel like immense pressure to just fulfill expectations? Thank you!"
"&gt; You never destroyed shit.  Destroyed three HOFers.  &gt; Toronto beat a banged up team and the Lakers ring is just as valid.  One guy was out. Lakers faced two All Stars for four games, with no fans, no games on the road after three month break.  &gt; You want to pretend the Warriors team was the same team that won the chip but it wasn’t.  Hmmm it pretty much was. The starting lineup for the 2015 finals which the Warriors won consisted of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green and Andrew Bogut. For the 2019 finals which the Warriors LOST consisted of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green and Demarcus Cousins who is an upgrade over Bogut. 4/5 are the same and one is an upgrade lmao.  &gt;  I’ve repeated my argument over and over because you’ve never destroyed it.  I destroyed it before it ever began. Sorry to say."
First nba finals since 2010 to not feature Udonis haslem or Andre iguodala
Andre Iguodala would prob be the NBA’s Joe Flacco
"After the final seconds ticked off the clock and with many of their teammates heading for the locker room, Golden State’s Stephen Curry and Andre Iguodala watched as the Cavaliers celebrated their first-ever NBA Championship.  “We've obviously been on the other side of the situation last year, and know how great a feeling that is when you accomplish your goal,” Curry said. “I think me and him were kind of just waiting for it to calm down a little bit so we could congratulate the individual guys"
"he can play center but during the raptors 2019 run he spent a lot of time doing wing defense too  just a very versatile defender  he's a lot like andre iguodala, can defend inside, can defend the perimeter, can hit jumpers when you need em"
"2004 Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala, Trevor Ariza still here."
"Andre Iguodala &gt; Curry, but these kids and their excuses smh"

Dame “Andre Iguodala” Lillard
I'm taking Andre Iguodala
"I mean Andre Iguodala won one too, but KD didn’t go to GSW to play with him.   Kawhi averaged like 17/11 or something that series which was impressive but nothing compared to what he became after"
It’s like Andre iguodala all over again
"I didn’t even mention any FMVPs (when I could’ve, as Wilt technically had more) because guys like Andre Iguodala win them and anyone who uses them to determine who’s better than who is reaching.   And even if we give Russel the edge in All-defense, and DPOYs, Wilt still would lead in far more categories.  &gt;Scoring and Rebounding titles don’t mean much to me  Why do you care about FMVPs and not scoring titles? Russel played similar minutes to Wilt so total stats shouldn’t be a problem. And even when we use ppg (which I did) Wilt still leads in all categories.   Wilt Chamberlain is top 10 all time in scoring, Bill Russel isn’t top *100*, and Wilt only played 2 more seasons than Bill. The offensive gap is too big for defensive skill to cover."
Andre iguodala
"I may be biased, but Andre Iguodala and his stint with Memphis is another example. Dude wanted more money, so he signed a massive contract with Golden State that meant they would eventually have to trade him to keep the rest of their core. They do, and once he realizes he's going to a small-market rebuilding team he just quits, continually bad mouths us, and demands to keep getting paid while refusing to participate in any way, shape, or form."
"Hes definitely not behind Steph as a playoff performer. Hes won 2 FMVPs and won championships with teams that weren't near as stacked as the Warriors, especially with the Raptors where he seriously put that team on his back. Steph has never put a team on his back for a playoff run like Kawhi did in '19, the fact that Andre Iguodala won an FMVP over him whether you think it was deserved or not speaks volumes.   You can't be talking about Steph is a better playoff performer than Kawhi when he has 0 FMVPs with a literal role player winning one over him and on top of that got beat by Kawhi while Kawhi was in the midst of a better playoff run than Steph has ever had."
"Well, I'm a different guy than the guy from before so we could agree anyways...but no, Ariza was honestly overrated the whole time he was here.   He constantly shot around 40% from the field and never shot above 40% from three. His best attribute was being 6'8"" and long + being able to move alright for his size. He certainly didn't impact the game like Draymond Green or Andre Iguodala."
"Seriously, though, this is a nice list at SF...   Rick Barry, Kevin Durant, Chris Mullin, Andre Iguodala, Bernard King, Juan Toscano Anderson   It might be top 5"
"You're forgetting Andre Iguodala who was needed for salary, and we wouldn't have had ariza, and we wouldve needed to include 6 picks/swaps.  But go off"
why does Smart sometimes morph into a Montae Ellis-Andre Iguodala hybrid?
"The Lakers are better this season, and Bam had nothing to do with that, he was injured most of the series. It was Jimmy having an all time series plus our shooters being hot at the right time. This team doesn't have good shooters, and wouldn't have as good defense. You're ignoring the Heat having Derrick Jones Jr, Jae Crowder, and Andre Iguodala, who were all great defenders. Thats where depth mattered in the playoffs. Jimmy and Bam cant play 48 minutes and in the minutes that one of them is sitting they'd have completely atrocious defense."
"I know people consider him a dirty player, but I loved Bogut.   Sean Livingston is a stud.   Andre Iguodala wasn’t a star any more so it was cool to watch him succeed.   LeBron’s comments on Barabosa’s speed made him into some type of legendary player in my eyes.   And then you had the code of Klay, Steph, and Dray all drafted by the team.   That team was incredibly likable for their first championship."
"It’s a long shot but there’s a couple of disgruntled All Stars every season demanding a trade. I’m just used to the Heat signing contracts like this every couple years, like Myers Leonard and Andre Iguodala, so they can be moved in a massive trade if need be. It’s nice to have $30 million of practically dead cap if a Superstar says he wants to be traded to your team lol otherwise yeah Kennard is a terrible contract"
"OK, but Denver, for example, did hit in the draft on Melo, and that got them 7.5 years of Melo which then got them 6.5 pretty decent years of Wilson Chandler, 5.5 pretty good years of Danilo Gallinari, 2 1st round picks for Timofey Mozgov, the Jamal Murray pick, and the assets and flexibility to trade for Andre Iguodala. And they still have that mindset."
Andre Iguodala
"‘nephew-tier’ doesn’t begin to describe this take.  andre iguodala has absolutely proved his playoff mettle, and he did so long before he won Finals MVP.  Did you start watching basketball in 2017?"
Bucks are lucky that the heat gave it to jimmy instead “mr. clutch” Andre iguodala
"Kawhi won FMVP in his fourth season and Harden averaged 26/6/5 in his fourth season. Andre Iguodala won FMVP, but he was never a super star level player ever in his career. After Kawhi won FMVP, most expected him to be an all star, not a top 5 player with an efficient offensive package so yeah it was def surprising."
"You were right to want him, and like Andre Iguodala said... the rest of the league were kind of foolish to let the Warriors have him this long. We have his bird rights now."
"1. No, there's nothing wrong with being an elite athlete, but relying entirely on your athleticism over improving your fundamentals makes you predictable, and predicable players get shutdown in the postseason.  There are all sorts great players that come from different molds from Jokic, to Curry, Lebron, Kawhi. Embiid, etc.  The one commonality between all these players is they have deep tool kits, allowing them to beat you in a myriad of ways, WB is just a one trick pony, and its a good trick, but not good enough to make a deep playoff run.    2. His defense is the same as his offense, entirely reliant on athleticism, with poor fundamentals, he makes flashy play but get beat way to regularly, most top guards are wayyy better defenders than WB, which is sad since he has significantly better tools than most of them  3. Within the NBA ecosystem there are a variety of different types of role players.  Some are purely one dimensional guys, spacers like Korver or Mcdermott, defenders like Thybulle, they have one elite skill and are meh at everything else.  Others have 2 skills they excel at, 3&amp;D players like Danny Green, Alex Caruso, etc.  Still others are multi dimensional role players, like Andre Iguodala, Aaron Gordon, etc.  WB turns all role players into one dimensional tools, which if youre a one dimensional role player is great, but if you have more to your game it hurts those players ability to contribute by crowbaring a round peg into a square hole (see Oladipo's and Sabonis's growth after they left OKC).    4. Sure but WB takes it to another level, dude hunts Triple doubles.  There is no rebound myth, lmfao WB collects tons of ez defensive rebounds rather than leaking out so his bigs can pass him the ball to start the break.  You can easily inflate assists, just run low percentage actions off P&amp;R, EZ.  5. Ah yes the KD choked narrative, lets look at the final 3 games of that series  Game 5:   KD: 12-31, 40 pts, 7 rebs, 4 assists, 1 steal, 1 block, 3 TO's, -4  WB: 11-28, 31 pts, 7 rebs, 8 assists, 5 steal, 1 block, 7 TO's, -9  Verdict: they either both choked or both played meh  Game 6:  KD: 10-31, 29 pts, 7 rebs, 3 assists, 2 steal, 3 block, 3 TO's, -6  WB: 10-28, 29 pts, 7 rebs, 9 assists, 4 steal, 0 block, 5 TO's, -11  Verdict: once again they both chocked, but WB def chocked the game away turning the ball over 4 times in the final 2 mins  Game 7:   KD: 10-19, 27 pts, 7 rebs, 3 assists, 1 steal, 1 block, 2 TO's, -4  WB: 7-21, 19 pts, 7 rebs, 13 assists, 2 steal, 0 block, 3 TO's, -14  Verdict: WB chocked  WB chocked 3 out of 3 games, KD chocked 2 out 3.  Also just for fun Wb career playoff stats  106 games played, 24.8 pts, 7.7 A, 7.0 Rebs, 1.8 steals, .3 blocks, on 41/30/83 splits, with an eFG of 44.4.  6. 2011 playoffs, game 5  OKC vs. Denver, KD definitely didnt carry his ass.    KD: 14-27, 41 points, 5 rebs, 2 assist, 1 steal, 2 blocks, 0 TO's,   WB: 3-15, 14 points, 5 rebs, 4 assists, 1 steal, 0 blocks, 3 TO's  7.  Really?  Then how were the Spurs so successful? or the Mavs with Dirk?  or the early 2000's Pistons?  Or the 2012-2016 warriors?  There are plenty of teams that found postseason success without multiple superstars.  Virtually every WB centric team has catered to his needs and its proven not to work.  If he needs such a narrow team construction that its virtually impossible for a GM as good as Presti to build around him, maybe he just isnt that great of a player."
Is Andre iguodala better than Tracy McGrady?
"What in the world are you talking about? Was it not just two years ago that the Golden State Warriors had Durant, Steph, and Klay? Not to mention guys like Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala, two of the very best role players in the league (and saying that much is arguably disrespectful to two former all-stars). AND that doesn't even consider that another washed all-star in Demarcus Cousins was a part of their rotation as well. Don't get me wrong, the nets are very good, but it's not something the league hasn't see before."
"When it comes to Robert Sarver this is legit news though. He's the owner that let Joe Johnson walk in free agency cause he didn't want to pay market value for him, and who simply dumped the first round picks that were used on Rajon Rondo and Luol Deng [because he was trying to save money:](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/347130-how-robert-sarver-destroyed-the-phoenix-suns.amp.html)  &gt; Sarver didn't want to spend money on first-round picks for four straight summers. Instead he sold, for ""cash considerations"" and future picks, the 2004 No. 7 pick (Luol Deng or Andre  Iguodala, who, ironically, they'd happily settle for now), Rajon Rondo (All-Star point guard for Boston), Rudy Fernandez (Spanish highlight film and fan favorite in Portland), Nate Robinson (three-time Dunk Champ; there's no money there?), Sergio Rodriguez (A backup point guard with skills? No way!), and two No. 1 picks (plus Kurt Thomas) for a conditional second round pick (I've never heard of that, by the way. What is a conditional second round pick?).   &gt; So there's another biblical tragedy spiral in all of that: Deng/Iguodala begat Rajon Rondo, who begat Rudy Fernandez who begat...you guessed it, cap space. (Seriously, that string of downgrading happened. Robinson, Rodriguez and Thomas were separate, though. Does that make Suns fans feel better? I doubt it.)"
"I see where you're coming from. I still think there's flash but the most popular types of flash have changed. Like, Steph's crossover-to-stepback 30-foot trey balls with 22-seconds left on the shot clock are flash to me.   That said, there *are* times where I feel like today's players finally listened to the criticism previous generations always got about valuing the highlight over making the play. High flyers seem much more content with throwing down a routine quick-dunk with barely any hand-rim interaction these days. It's easy, it's efficient, it's certain. But I definitely miss so many dudes aching to break out into the open floor so they can flaunt their stuff.   I kind of think the 2000's may have been the golden era of dunking to this point. There were *so* many dudes unleashing funk back then - either via creativity (Vince Carter) or on account of murdering the rim (Kenyon Martin).   * Vince Carter  * Kobe Bryant  * Tracy McGrady  * Jason Richardson  * Ricky Davis  * Desmond Mason  * Stromile Swift  * Richard Jefferson  * Steve Francis  * Baron Davis  * Young LeBron James  * Dwyane Wade  * Young Andre Iguodala  * Kenyon Martin  * Gerald Wallace  * Young Josh Smith  * Young J.R. Smith  Then this whole second tier of not-quite-elite dunkers but still punishing finishers like Chris Webber, Chris Wilcox, Chris Andersen, Darius Miles, Jason Maxiell, slightly less prime Shaquille O'Neal, Rasheed Wallace, Jermaine O'Neal, Dahntay Jones, etc.   At times, it does sort of feel like we're just watching a 3-point factory night-in and night-out. But on that same token, in the 2000's, watching teams like the Atlanta Hawks could feel like watching an iso- or iso-post-up factory so to some degree you have to pick your poison."

"People knew they couldn't keep KD, Westbrook, Harden, and Ibaka and the discussion was between who moves between Harden and Ibaka, which is crazy to think today.  It seemed pretty immediate that people assumed OKC would get better even with Harden's absence which of course now with 20:20 hindsight seems insane, but at the time Harden was seen as like almost an Andre Iguodala type sixth man player (albeit not defensively of course) and no one realized just how amazing he would be.   A lot of people I think forget Harden was exclusively coming off the bench for OKC. In that 11-12 season, he only started 2 games and had only started 7 games in his career up to that point.   The Harden trade was still bad at the time though, it's only become apparent looking back how much worse it even was than it seemed."
"Andrew Bogut, David Lee, and Andre Iguodala"
The best team I could come up with:  PG: Trae Young  SG: Jaylen Brown  SF: Andre Iguodala  PF: Zion Williamson  C: Bam Adebayo
"You mean FMVP Andre Iguodala?  Yea he’d be a good choice too. Can’t go wrong with a hyper athletic wing that plays good defense.    One of my dumb theories that probably doesn’t hold up is that all great teams need an Ariza-type. Just a big wing who can play defense and do some dirty work. Three point shooting is a plus, but not a requirement. Sometimes the star player can also play the role of the Ariza-type.    The Suns have bridges, the bucks have Giannis and PJ Tucker. Before that were guys like iggy, Kawhi, Lebron, Paul pierce, Shane battier, Ariza, you get the idea."
How about an Andre iguodala
G - Mike Conley  G- Jrue Holiday  F- Andre Iguodala  F- Andre Kirilenlo  C -Tyson Chandler  Nobody's scoring on this team
 Sam Cassell  Steve Smith  Andre Iguodala  Andrei Kirilenko  Vlade Divac
PG JRUE HOLIDAY SG KYLE KROVER SF ANDRE IGUODALA PF HORACE GRANT  C VLADE DIVAC
Let's just look at the names:  Lebron James vs Kevin Durant  Kyrie Irving vs Steph Curry  Kevin Love vs Klay Thompson  JR Smith vs Draymond Green  Tristan Thompson vs Andre Iguodala   Does that look even top to bottom?
People have been trying to push this narrative lately and it's ridiculous. The 2016 finals matchup was pretty even top to bottom. Even Andre Iguodala admitted adding KD to that Warriors team was completely unfair for the rest of the league.
Ask 2015 FMVP Andre Iguodala
"Absolutely!   You know what, Andre Iguodala is right, fans like the people in this thread deserve super teams. Cp3 should just go play for the Lakers after this year. This is why people just join super teams because fans are dumb and  cant think critically."
Lebron didn't in 15 it will never happen even if someone does even better than Lebron did in 15 because he lost it to Andre Iguodala lmao
"Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, PJ Tucker, Dwight Howard, and Andre Iguodala."
"Am I comparing the loss of defensive impact from starting Andre Iguodala to starting Kevon Looney to on the other side the Rockets going from Chris Paul at point guard to James Harden at point guard? Yeah, I think that's in the ballpark of fair.  The Rockets were -63 in that series. This idea that the Rockets ""solved"" the Warriors needs to die. They eeked out a couple of close wins after Iguodala went down because there was someone on the floor the Rockets could abuse hard enough on offense. It's really hard for bigs to be relevant for the right reasons facing a perimeter centric offense. Just ask Rudy Gobert.  The harsh truth of that series was it was the absolute closest that those Rockets could have played that Warriors team. You can simulate that series game 1 to game 7 20 times and the Rockets maybe win 1"
"This reinforces my respect for Steph &amp; Klay. According to Andre Iguodala on JJ’s podcast, they’ve *never* asked for the kind of team-alienating special treatment and deals other superstars do."
"He's not a Sun because [they didnt give him what he wanted the full $125 mil](https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/amare-stoudemire-says-staying-with-suns-is-plan-a-as-long-as-plan-a-includes-six-years-and-about-125-million-6655816). I posted this the other day about how Andre Iguodala was ready to leave Hou for less money than GSW was offering because he felt dissed that GSW wasnt offering as much as he felt they should. Same thing here, if you arent offering the full max to Amare, it tells you what you need to know and part of why he left."
Andre Iguodala spoke highly of him on JJ Redick’s latest podcast.
"PG - Harden SG - Irving SF - Joe Harris PF - Durant C - DeAndre Jordan / Nicolas Claxton  They need a back up forward and back up guard and the 8 man rotation is set.  I can see two of the players below deciding to sign a cheap deal to get a ring with the Nets.  Guard - Victor Oladipo, Goran Dragic, Lou Williams, Derrick Rose, E’Twaun Moore  Forward - Danny Green, Andre Iguodala, Paul Millsap, Reggie Bullock, Markieff Morris"
"Quit putting words in my mouth. I didn't say it was okay for Steph , I said there's no shame in losing to the greatest player of all time . ,KD on the other hand , had a team well equiped to take down the warriors ( Andre iguodala said himself that thunder team was the hardest to face that season ).   Meanwhile we had Bogut go down and had to start festus Ezili and Anderson verajao. But that's part of the game and you play who's Infront of you . We ended losing to arguably the greatest player of all time ."
"Andre Iguodala is a more well-rounded player offensive player than Michael Cooper.  I agree he isn't a Hall of Famer, but he isn't too far below that level.  Incidentally, why was Iguodala a controversial FMVP?  LeBron James was even better in the 2015 NBA Finals (and I personally would have selected him as a FMVP), but I can understand why he didn't receive it; his team lost the series.  On the winning Warriors team, IMO Iguodala was clearly the most deserving player."
"The one difference between this block and Lebron's block on Andre Iguodala is that Iguodala probably could have sealed the FG if he chose to dunk it. The Suns, however, couldn't have picked a higher probability play to run and seal the FG. I remember not appreciating the block on the first viewing because it just looked like a broken play."
"Max Kellerman actually has a point. Andre Iguodala shoots better in the clutch, especially do or die situations, partially due to the fact that he is open more. Perhaps, in the situation discussed, the opposing team would only put 1 man on iguodala, but they would double team Curry. Take that as you will, but this claim has evidence to back it up and it is 100% non-logical to deny that."
"I always thought the Iguodala to GSW stuff started in that DEN/GSW series with the controversy of Iguodala spending time with them in the chapel and telling the Warriors the Nuggets were trying to hurt Steph.  [It was reported from George Karl though, so who knows?](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/12/1/5162790/andre-iguodala-mole-nuggets-warriors-george-karl-playoffs)"
"I think several people close to KD around the league try to make him stop defending his decision to go to the Warriors. I thought this was some really good advice that Andre Iguodala remembered giving KD before 2016 free agency, according to his excellent book The Sixth Man:  ""We can all do our best to take the heat off of you. But the most important thing is that YOU have to not give a fuck.... What's more important? For you to enjoy life being where you want to be, but with a bunch of strangers not liking your decision? Or to be where you're not enjoying your life, but with a bunch of strangers approving of you?""  For my book, Iggy told me that his advice for KD got more advanced by 2019: ""At this point, fuck EVERYBODY. That's including management, anybody — from this team to the team, fans, whoever. Do whatever makes you happy, man, and don't feel like you're letting anybody down with any decision that you make.""  Has that stopped KD from giving a fuck? Nah."
&gt; every single bucket a team scores on offense can be stopped by good defense  I mean this is just flat out wrong. You can play be the best defense in the league and someone like KD will still make shots. Andre Iguodala won Finals MVP for his defense on Lebron when Lebron averaged almost 36 points per game.
"This is a complicated question with a complicated answer - eye test consensus paints klay thompson as a top 15-20 player in his prime.  Advanced metrics (BPM, on/off, RTG) paint him as a top 40-50 player.  This discrepancy exists for a complicated reason.  Klay Thompson's strengths: -Shooting (all time 3 point shooter) / spacing -On ball defense  Klay Thompson's weaknesses: -Playmaking -Help Defense (sometimes not his role, but nonetheless rarely breaks up plays)  In 2016,   the best shooter was Curry, who could increase his usage when Klay was off the floor. the best playmaker was Draymond, who is almost always on the floor with Steph in lineups for the past half decade. the best on-ball defender and transition player was Iguodala, who was better than Thompson when playing with the other 4 starters.  So what happened?  Klay Thompson benefits from playmaking, except Draymond is always playing with Steph.  Klay Thompson is an excellent 3 point shooter, but Curry just increases his volume when Klay is out.  Klay Thompson is a strong wing defender, but Iguodala was an on-ball juggernaut who was better in transition, creating more positive value when he was on the floor over Thompson.  So what was the logical decision for coaching?  Play Thompson in the second unit.  Unfortunately for him, his motion heavy style of play in the golden state system without strong ancillary ball handlers led to highly contested shots from 3, and plays were run to get him open on long 2s that were not run for Steph, which lowered his efficiency further.  This made him look very pedestrian on golden state's second unit, and it was partially a coaching and front office problem.  So, in summary, on a team with Lebron James, who plays like a GOAT version of Andre Iguodala, I think he would be more valuable.  But ultimately I think playing with Steph makes him somewhat redundant and less valuable than the eye test would suggest."
&gt;genius  Thank you. But I can't take all the credit.   Here are legit multiple sources talking about what he was valued at during his season with us.   [https://theathletic.com/1466663/2019/12/19/clippers-trade-primer-montrezl-harrell-marcus-morris-andre-iguodala-and-five-players-they-could-target/](https://theathletic.com/1466663/2019/12/19/clippers-trade-primer-montrezl-harrell-marcus-morris-andre-iguodala-and-five-players-they-could-target/)  [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2871835-how-aggressive-should-la-clippers-be-at-the-nba-trade-deadline](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2871835-how-aggressive-should-la-clippers-be-at-the-nba-trade-deadline)  Honesty there's more but you can go ahead and look it up. Fact is he was projecting at 2x his current rate. So you are deflecting and wrong.
It's a crime Andre Iguodala didn't win it during the Warriors run.
Wait Andre Iguodala? He's Nigerian?
Don't forget Andre Iguodala! And Okongwu on the Hawks :D
"Actually other sports have done it.  But this guy explains why Lebron deserved the Finals MVP way better than I could:  *LeBron James is fighting an army by himself. He's probably going to lose, but he's not dying easily.*  James' average line in these NBA Finals is 36.6 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 8.4 assists per game.  **Only Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal and James Worthy** have managed to do that **in a single NBA Finals game** since 1986. **James is doing it every game.** *James is the only person to have 35 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists in that time frame ... and he's done it three times in this series.*  *His 40-point triple-double in Game 5 was the first in decades. James had 20 points, eight rebounds and eight assists by halftime, something nobody has done in any game -- finals, postseason or regular season -- since James entered the league.*  James is the Cavaliers' offense. He scored or assisted 16 of their 17 first half baskets, including every one in the second quarter. He ended up scoring or assisting 26 of their 32 field goals.  **He's doing this out of necessity. When James is on the court, the Cavaliers score 97.2 points per 100 possessions. When he is off the court, they score 54.6 points per 100 possessions. THAT IS VERY BAD.**  With Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love injured, the Cavs are down their second- and third-best players. None of LeBron's remaining teammates can create his own shots.  J.R. Smith loves trying, but he is woefully inefficient in doing so. Tristan Thompson can score on offensive rebounds, but isn't a great post-up player. Timofey Mozgov works best in the pick-and-roll, which needs James to act as ball-handler. There was one possession in Game 5 where Matthew Dellavedova tried going one-on-one with his defender. It looked like an escaped zoo animal trying to break out of a lasso after being hit with a tranquilizer dart.  There is no course of action for the Cavaliers besides just giving the ball to LeBron over and over and over and over and over and over and over. Against the NBA's best defense, this should end disastrously. But it hasn't been a complete disaster. It's been kind of close.  The Warriors are winning because they're a great team with several great players. Sometimes Stephen Curry is great! Sometimes Klay Thompson is great! Sometimes Andre Iguodala is great! Everybody's great! The Cavaliers have won two games and made two others close solely because LeBron James is playing like a demigod.   By the literal definition of the term, James has been the most valuable player in the NBA Finals.  But if the Cavaliers lose, don't bet on James receiving the award that goes to the most valuable player.  Once upon a time, it was reasonably common for players who put up astounding performances for losing teams to receive championship event MVP trophies, but sometime in the past 40 years or so, that trend fell out of style.  In the NBA, a losing player has only received the MVP once, when Jerry West won the award in 1969, the very first year an award was given. His was as preposterous as LeBron's. He averaged 38 points per game in a seven-game defeat to the Celtics and had a 42-point triple-double in Game 7, the only triple-double with a higher point total in finals history than James' Game 5.  The MLB and NFL have also given out MVP's to losing players just once, and both were a long time ago. The only losing World Series MVP was Yankees second baseman Bobby Richardson in 1960. If that series were played now, the trophy would almost certainly go to Bill Mazeroski, who hit a walkoff home run in Game 7. The only losing Super Bowl MVP was Cowboys linebacker Chuck Howley way back in Super Bowl V, in 1971.  Hockey players who lose the Stanley Cup are still kind of in the running for the Conn Smythe Trophy, but that's a bit more understandable because it's meant to reward the player with the best overall postseason performance, not merely the best performance in the decisive series. It's been given to losing players five times, with four being goaltenders. But this too is becoming increasingly rare. After two defeated players received the trophy in the first four years it was awarded, only one has gotten it in the past 25 years: Jean-Sebastian Giguere in 2003.  Whether the move away from rewarding losing players is a conscious effort on the part of leagues, a change in the voting procedures or thought processes for participating media or merely a coincidence is unclear. But it is clear that nobody is particularly interested in making an incredibly awkward moment happen.  Picture the scenario of the Warriors winning and James winning the MVP. The confetti-covered Warriors are celebrating their team's first championship in 40 years. It's the photo opportunity of a lifetime, a moment Warriors fans will cherish for decades to come.  And now Adam Silver has to speak into a microphone and tell everybody that none of them was good enough to win MVP. They have to stand aside as somebody goes searching for LeBron. Is he in the locker room? Does he come out, despite being devastated by defeat, to receive the trophy on stage? Does somebody go quietly bring it to him backstage? Does he even want the dang thing? Everybody involved hates it. The LeBron-hating contingent would go apoplectic, convinced once and for all that people will go to great lengths to praise James in spite of his consistent failures.  For these reasons, James will almost certainly need to will the Cavaliers to a win in Game 7 in order to be the NBA Finals MVP. If he doesn't, somebody on the Warriors -- probably Curry, perhaps Iguodala or somebody else depending on what happens in the future -- will get the award.  But let's not forget what James is doing against incredible odds.*"
"Can we all agree the only reason why Iguodala won the FMVP was because of Curry's insane fucking gravity leading to Andre being open seemingly all the damn time. He made his shots but if you told me Andre wins FMVP over Steph with ""zero discussion"" then someone's smokin' something."
"I love Steph (check my flair) but Iguodala deserved it. People forget that Curry getting his is part of the gameplan for the Cavs. Their goal in the series is to do what little you can to slow down Curry to at least prevent him from averaging 30+ on elite efficiency and in the process force the other guys to make shots. Then on the other end, have LeBron go beast mode and feast.  Here's the thing, it kinda worked. Every Warrior was below their normal numbers in both volume and efficiency. With one exception. Andre more then doubled his regular season scoring, on super high efficiency. Plus he was the primary defender on LeBron who, while he got his numbers, was horribly inefficient.  If both teams are able to execute their gameplan but one team comes out on top, the Most Valuable Player is the main engine of the winning team (Curry). If instead, one team's gameplan is completely blown up by one guy whose impact and production wasn't expected, and it's consistent thoughout the series (not just one or two unexpected big games), then that's the Most Valuable Player in that series."
Andre Iguodala &gt; Steph Curry
Here’s the thing about being on a team with Stephen Curry. If you knock down the open threes you are gifted from his gravity in the finals you are immediately hoisted to the front runner for finals MVP.  See Andre Iguodala in 2015. And Draymond in 2016 if they had won that series.    Yet somehow no one ever mentions that their man is literally guarding Stephen Curry and there is not a defender within 10 feet of them as they shoot open threes.
"So LeBron was somehow both so amazing that he had a case as FMVP even though he lost, and also was shut down by Andre Iguodala to the point that Iguodala deserved the FMVP primarily for his defense on LeBron? I know LeBron's a great player, but those two statements seem directly contradictory."
And the NBA Finals where Andre Iguodala was inserted into the starting lineup mid-series occurred in June 2015.
"&gt;  LeBron somehow made it a 6 games series with the worst supporting cast ever seen in a Finals.  This is the shit I can't stand. The Cavs made it to 6 games. Not just Lebron. Lebron played really great in games 2 and 3. But he also got some really good performances from ""the worst supporting cast ever seen in a Finals."" He also had a little help from Steph Curry in game 2 who shot like complete shit. Was it Delly locking Curry down or Curry choking? Either way it wasn't Lebron. Delly bottomed two massive go ahead free throws in overtime in game 2. Shit like that matters.   Lebron in game 4 with a chance to go up 3-1 played like total dog shit. Warriors took a 15 point lead right after half time and the Cavs were hanging in there with all the credit going to the ""worst supporting cast ever seen in a Finals."" Delly hit two massive threes in a row to keep the Cavs in the game. TT gets an offensive rebound and put back off a Lebron brick. Lead gets cut to 4 points with 4 minutes left in the 3rd. What does Lebron do? Makes one more layup, makes 1 of 2 free throws, then doesn't score again in the whole game including the entire 4th quarter. And did the media even slightly mention that terrible game by Lebron? No. They shifted the entire narrative to Andre Iguodala."
Andre Iguodala
he's like an Andre Iguodala than can shoot. Such a great player. Him and Booker are my favorite players to watch on the Suns.
Behind only Festus Ezeli who was a 7 foot brick shithouse. I know it's a different set of muscles for deadlift but I'm surprised Andre Iguodala and his Spongebob Anchor Arms weren't higher lol
"How does that tweet contradict what /u/lakerswiz said about LeBron giving his opinion? And LeBron isn't a vice president of the NBAPA (his term expired 2.5 years ago). [Here's the player leadership:](https://nbpa.com/leadership)  * Chris Paul, President * Andre Iguodala, First VP * Harrison Barnes, Secretary-Treasurer * Bismack Biyombo, VP * Malcolm Brogdon, VP * Jaylen Brown, VP * Kyrie Irving, VP * CJ McCollum, VP * Garrett Temple, VP  LeBron isn't even the Lakers' rep (that's Jared Dudley, with Alex Caruso as alternate)."
"Most of them are just right wingers that can’t get over Lebron disrespecting Trump.   Andre Iguodala put it nicely:   &gt; “They ready to attack LeBron for making a statement because they don't like his statement, they feel like he should have took another stance. But when he's home and he makes a stance about... and it's like, 'No this is not your place to make that statement.' That was just mindblowing. That's what bothered me the most.”"
Andre Iguodala gives effort on defense
I've always said Andre Iguodala was better than Jokic
"Obviously the 6 FMVP. Unless every one of those was an Andre Iguodala situation, it probably means he was one of the top players in the league anyway."
I suppose 3x All Star and former DPOY Draymond Green was also a bench bum? And surely former 6MOY and FMVP Andre Iguodala wasnt known for using his body to hide reach-in fouls
Andre fucking Iguodala
you already named the person who should be #1 on the list of best role players of all time (a guy who contributes but isn’t relied on as the first or second scorer) and that’s Andre Iguodala
Andre Iguodala
"Lebron didn’t play alongside an mvp and a great all-around team. He had Sasha pavlovic and boobie Gibson.   Andre iguodala even said on record that the thunder were the best team in the playoffs in 2016. Lebron also wasn’t up 3-1 on a 73-9 team, and he didn’t choke a 3-1 lead away and join the team that beat him after they had already won a championship.   He also didn’t join a 73-9 team.   The scenarios are totally different."
The Warriors didn't sign that many players for cheap and contenders can often do that anyway.  There are accounts of Warriors players getting involved in the investment scene but that didn't involve the team at all. Andre Iguodala talked them into it.  Not sure who you think were or are on favourable contracts. KD was getting paid as much as the rules allowed the Warriors to pay him. Draymond left money on the table for cap room because he wanted rings. Steph was underpaid but his contract was fair both ways when it was signed and then he went supermax. Klay is on a max now.  Have you seen the Warriors tax bill? They're not avoiding shit.
"I don't really disagree, but I would say that number would need to be 70 percent at least, along with showing he can knock them down in crunch time.     The Cavs were playing Hack-a-Iguodala when he was a 60 percent shooter, which only worked sporadically because Andre has a clutch factor that Ben definitely doesn't have."
What if Lebron hypothetically joined the 2016-17 warriors in place of Andre Iguodala??? How many titles would they have won??? Wtf is this question
TIL Andre Iguodala is Rayquaza.
You make it seem like Steph was just a starter on the warriors instead of the second best player on the team with KD being the second best player in the league at the time. Steph was top 5 in the league when he win his championships. He was the best player for the first championship in 2015 as he is better the Andre Iguodala obviously.
No love for prime Andre Iguodala?
"First off, stop with 6th all-time in Finals MVPs. He has 2. Andre Iguodala shows how little those mean, as Kobe only has 1 more than Andre.   Secondly, 2nd all-time in non-pg assists is misleading. He is 31st compared to all players. You are cherry picking that stat and taking away a fifth of the players in history so his rank for a stat is higher."
Andre Iguodala won the FMVP?
"Idk we might be defining role player differently.  He was still an all star and HOFer.  I don't consider someone like that as a role player.  Role players to me are like a JR Smith, Derek Fisher, Andre Iguodala etc.  Kyrie was a side kick to LeBron, but he's not a role player lol.  Jr Smith was."
Let’s ask Andre Iguodala.
Far from the worst in history but we traded Andre Iguodala for zero minutes of Andrew Bynum. Dude was earning 16m when he injured his knee playing bowling.
Andre Iguodala
Deandre Ayton or Jae Crowder (a la Andre Iguodala all those years ago)
There’s a certain finals MVP missing here and it’s not Andre Iguodala
They also forget that Timofy Mosgov literally outscored Lebron in game 4 when they had a chance to make it 3-1. Maybe if Lebron didn't shoot 32/25/50 that game they could have won the series. Literally nobody talks about Lebron having a bad game instead they made it all about Andre Iguodala so they wouldn't have to say Lebron shit the bed. He literally scored 0 in the fourth quarter. Scored only 10 in the second half on 10 FGA and 6 FTA.
With the fate of humanity on the line the correct answer is Andre iguodala
 2015 NBA finals mvp is curry not andre iguodala  I dont understand up to date why media give it to iggy
"&gt;So what? Paul George, Jermaine O'Neal, Blake Griffin, and Alonzo Mourning all finished 3rd for MVP too.  ...and they're all better than Andre Iguodala."
"He should have got 2015 FMVP.  Think about it logically for 2 seconds, who do you think was more valuable to the Warriors in that series? Stephen Curry or Andre Iguodala? You know the answer to that question..."
Yeah Iguodala even said they were the best team in the playoffs despite losing to the Cavs https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2652104-andre-iguodala-says-thunder-were-the-best-team-during-2016-nba-playoffs
"76ers-Jrue Holiday, Seth Curry, Andre Iguodala, Tobias Harris and Joel Embiid,"
PG &gt;&gt; glorified Andre Iguodala
"Yes this happened with DLo, which is why Andre Iguodala was traded for a bag of baseballs. The outgoing money is only a small piece of the equation in this case."
"Honestly, my posts all weekend were lazy because I shut my laptop off after I end my work week and I *really* don't like having to turn it back on, and looking this stuff up takes more than twice as long on my tablet or phone.  So anyway....... I showed you a league history indicating teams in their 30s don't win rings very often, and 40 years of most-valuable-player-on-title-teams being in their 20s. You showed me outliers. Every player we're looking at is exceptional, so if these guys don't indicate players tend to be in their primes in their 30s, some outlier performances aren't going to sway me.  Additionally - you keep pointing out that guys that are 29 tend to be more successful than guys who are 26... That in no way invalidates my point. If anything IT SUPPORTS it. It makes complete sense that guys will more often be at the peak of their powers at the tail end of their prime, combining the fact that they are still in their peak athletic form with their increased basketball IQ/skill level. That doesn't mean they're still peaking in their 30s, because the numbers I've shown you indicate that guys in their 30s clearly don't lead championship teams nearly as often as guys in their 20s, on around a 2:1 level.  You've brought up Finals MVP a bunch, so lets look at that. I'll also look back on the previous list I posted to see who is a top complementary player, and what age their top complementary players were if these are the primary stars. I'll use PLAYOFF Win Shares to determine this. So this whole list is composed of 1. the Finals MVP and 2. the top performer on the team other than the Finals MVP in terms of playoff win shares.  Pre-prime (under 26): 16  Prime (26-29): 38  Post-prime (30 over): 26  Players in their 20s in general are represented at over 2:1 - 54 to 26. On top of the previous data showing the most valuable player in a full season (my point regarding prime) is 26-29 at a 2:1 rate, and the fact that weighted by minutes only 9 championship teams all time have been over 30.  In addition - you've got multiple long stretches where guys in their 20s dominate the list, while there's really only one period where guys in their 30s dominate it: 1994-1998 where 9/10 players are in their 30s.

WNBA supporters are basically 90% Twitter people who don't watch the games themselves."
"Not true, a lot of them overpay their guys to keep the championship together, JR Smith, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston all got overpaid because of the championship high. Bucks might do the same for PJ Tucker, Bobby Portis and such"
"No. Shoot, even look at the Warriors of recent. They had Shaun Livingston, David West and Andre Iguodala providing that veteran leadership while the young guys were shining."
"You don't get it.  Stars alone don't carry you to championships, or every Superstar would get them. Stars will bring greatness no matter what, but you need lesser players to step up.  Otherwise LeBron would have more rings.  Do you think Andre Iguodala would be a better coach than Steve Kerr?"
"Ah I was wondering why Andre ""I Want"" Iguodala is the most hated for the Nuggets, maybe there's something else as well but I guess that makes sense"
"ok?? who gives a fuck who the ""partner"" is? literally every ama has something like that in the post body... no one reads it and no one cares. this is not something that is remotely specific to the anthony davis ama. they all have something like that.  did you actually look at any of his replies? or are you just circlejerking based on what youve seen others say?  how are any of these answers not ""opening up and interacting with fans""??  &gt;My transition was pretty smooth. I went straight from college to the Olympic team with Bron, Melo, Kobe, Tyson Chandler, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Andre Iguodala, Chris Paul. I was able to be around these guys 24/7 for about two months, and learn a lot from them.   &gt;My “welcome to the league” moment was when we played Indiana at home during my rookie year. They had PG, Lance Stephenson, David West, Roy Hibbert, all those guys. David West just lit me up. I couldn’t stop him. I was so frustrated. He went to the same move, over and over. Literally 5 times in a row. Just caught the ball, jab, jumper from the elbow. I couldn’t stop it. That’s when I knew the league was for real.  ...  &gt;I would choose the ability to teleport. It seems weird to be invisible and have no one notice you, and flying I don’t really care about. But being able to teleport and get point A to point B anywhere in the world would be the best for me. It would be even better if someone could hold onto me and we could teleport together.  ...   &gt;A guy I’ve looked up to a lot was Kevin Garnett. I always wanted to be like him, play both sides, be a fierce competitor. He was in the later part of his career when I came into the league but I always looked forward to playing against him too.  ...  &gt;If I’m back home in Chicago, I gotta have Giordano’s pizza. In New York, Philippe’s is a must.  ...  &gt;A little of both. They made me feel a part of the team. They welcomed me, they invited me to dinner. And then I got a chance to play sometimes, and they would coach me up. Most of the time it was just being shocked that I was even there, being able to share the court with them and win a gold medal.  ...  &gt;I was actually nervous. It’s a moment you dream of your entire life, and you reach that childhood dream...it was a lot. I was able to take it all in and embrace the feeling with my family. When I heard my name called it was one of the best feelings in the world.  ...  &gt;Just winning.   &gt;Winning it all with family there, and me just sitting back and reflecting on everything that happened that season, everything in my career, in like 15 seconds. That’s the picture that floats around a lot with me sitting by the bench, just crying with all the emotion coming out."
"While I don’t know if I want to give Max Kellerman that much credit, just the fact that the question was who do you want to take a must make 3, Curry or *Igoudala*, not Klay, who is the second best shooter on the team, but *Andre Iguodala*, is pretty suspect. Like, you’re just looking for a hot take, because the correct answer is obviously Steph between those two."
"I wanted to do Kevin Garnett but I think that's kinda cheating  C: Elton Brand (top 10 player in his best year, looked like a borderline superstar at times)  PF: Rashard Lewis (seen as a one-season wonder for 2009) but was an amazing floor stretcher and very good complementary scorer for years)  SF: Andre Iguodala (didn't get enough credit as a defender, could easily have made a bunch of ASGs)  SG: Doug Christie (same.thing about not getting enough credit as a super elite defender). Could also put Battier in this spot but I think he got more credit  PG: Chauncey Billups (almost won two MVPs in a row in years where he didn't make the ASG)"
"PG- Mike Bibby: Dude was the Kyle Lowry of this era  SG- Andre Iguodala: He went way under the radar in Philly and only got real recognition in his 30s in GSW  SF- Andrei Kirilenko- Such a Godly defensive player. The Jazz made the WCF in 2007 because of his amazing defense and the We Believe Warriors knocking out Dallas  PF- Chris Webber- He was forgotten in a golden age of power forwards. C-Webb was right there with Duncan, KG and Dirk for many years though  C- Zydrunas Ilgauskas- He was a great center, a little ahead of his time at the position  6th man- Peja Stojakovic- 3rd King on my list. One of the greatest shooters that has ever lived"
"Damn, guess Andre Iguodala carried the Warriors to their first ring then. See how that logic doesn't work?"
Better wings and some actual guard depth. This team desperately needs a do it all wing (ex. An Andre Iguodala or Mikal Bridges type)
7 &gt; 6 winning is all that matters. Games about winning. Also Andre Iguodala &gt; Steph Curry. More Finals MVPs!
Alright but should they have kept Andre Iguodala?
"Even Salt Lake City?  I remember that a few years ago the Warriors had a bunch of time there, and a bunch of the players were trying to figure out something to do (because there's not much compared to other places).  They ended up going to an escape room, lol:  https://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/warriors-curry-mocks-nightlife-backlash-slc-insta-12536656.php  &gt;Steph Curry mocks last year's 'nightlife' backlash with funny Salt Lake City Instagram  &gt;Who says Salt Lake City doesn't have #nightlife?  &gt;A year after the Warriors' ""nightlife"" comments lit up Twitter, Stephen Curry made light of the pseudo-controversy with a tongue-in-cheek Instagram post on Monday night. In the photo, the team poses at an escape room in Salt Lake City. The caption: #nightlife.  &gt;In case you missed last year's weakest Warriors controversy, here's what went down: During the Western Conference playoffs, ESPN asked the Warriors if they preferred the nightlife in Los Angeles or Utah during their between-games downtime.  &gt;""No comparison. There's no such thing, man,"" then-Warriors forward Matt Barnes said. ""There's no nightlife in Utah.""  &gt;**""The problem with Utah is that you're just sitting there and your mind is, like, dead**, because in L.A., you still got energy for the game,"" added Andre Iguodala. ""Because you're in L.A., you're like, 'Man, this is just the vibe in L.A.' but in Utah, it can kind of lull you to sleep.""  &gt;Soon after the story broke, ""nightlife"" started trending on Twitter. The ""Visit Salt Lake"" tourism bureau even shared a two-minute video highlighting the city's attractions called, ""There's Nothing to Do in Salt Lake.""  &gt;Luckily, it looks like the Warriors found some of the elusive Salt Lake City nightlife this year. Omri Casspi, Draymond Green, JaVale McGee (and his fanny pack), Nick Young, Zaza Pachulia, Jordan Bell and Andre Iguodala all appear in the escape room snap with Curry. Missing are Klay Thompson (probably playing ""Call of Duty"") and Kevin Durant (perhaps the photographer).  &gt;According to its website, the Escape Key has four different rooms with mad scientist lab, Sherlock Holmes, Russian spy and CSI themes. In case you were worried they didn't make it out, McGee posted proof that they did.  &gt;""The champs made it out the escape room,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""TeamWork make the DreamWork!"""
"Yeah, Book had 70 points in 45 minutes, big fucking deal. He got his Finals MVPs because of the aforementioned coattail riding. It's easy to look good in the Finals when you have a guy on your team that is better than you, and TWO guys on your team that have incredible gravity on offense. Shit, Andre Iguodala even got one on that team."
brooklyn especially. Dinwiddie bruce brown melo claxton and someone like trevor ariza or andre iguodala is a winning bench unit
"Wow, definitely great to sign Jabari Parker instead of getting the first round pick the Grizzlies got for taking on Andre Iguodala. 4d chess there.  Great GMs maximize every asset and opportunity. Arguing bad moves were actually good because Hawks got to draft a backup center is really something."
"OK, let me give you some hypothetical trades to illustrate my point.   1. Who says no to a trade where Miami gives Goran Dragic and Andre Iguodala in exchange for Ben Simmons? Dragic and Iguodala both have team options, so Miami could pick them up and trade them to Philly and the Sixers would get two pretty old players on expiring contracts and just get off of Simmons' salary. Are you telling me Miami says no to that?  2. The Sixers ask the Knicks to trade them Kevin Knox for Ben Simmons. This works because the Knicks have the cap space to absorb Simmons contract, even though Knox is only on a $5 million deal. Are you telling me the Knicks turn that down?  3. The Sixers offer Ben Simmons to Dallas for Willie Cauley Stein. Same as the Knicks trade, WCS only makes $5 million, but Dallas has the cap space to absorb Simmons contract. Does Dallas say no?  Clearly these are all trades where Philly is far, far more likely to say no than the other teams are. You're delusional if you think Miami, the Knicks or Dallas tells Philly they also need to include a 1st round pick or two before agreeing to those trades."
It will also be the first finals since 2014 that will not feature Andre Iguodala!
Hey man that’s Andre finals mvp Iguodala ur slandering
I guess it's semantics and perception as to how much the Warriors were hated  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  Obviously we weren't as hated as the Heatles. They didn't draft 4 starters and had a few bigger FA signings than Andre Iguodala. I don't remember the Warriors having a TV special for Andre either...
The result is all that matters in the NBA.   Andre Iguodala held Lebron James to a measly 36/13/9 and won FMVP.
Andre Iguodala
"I mean Mark Jackson managed to take Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala all the way to the conference semifinals. Then he got fired and the Warriors won the Finals the next year with basically zero roster changes. I can't imagine why nobody wants to hire him!"
Good point.   Give me Andre Iguodala
"This is commented a lot but I don't think it's true.  Many NBA players (both active and retired) gave him props:  * [NBA PLAYERS REACT TO GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO WINNING FINALS MVP 2021 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9yOhfBKHwM) * [NBA PLAYERS REACT TO MILWAUKEE BUCKS WINNING NBA CHAMPIONSHIP 2021 | GIANNIS REACTIONS (LeBron etc) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqGBut87sqw)  Some examples from these two videos: Lebron, Jaylen Brown, CJ, Draymond Green, Pau Gasol, Andre Iguodala, Miles Bridges, Christian Wood, Larry Nance Jr, Magic, Isiah Thomas, Donovan Mitchell, Jordan Clarkson, Ja Morant, Dejounte Murray, Covington, McGee, Haliburton, Gobert, and others."
"Warriors fans watched Andre Iguodala avoid any potential contact despite having so many high percentage opportunities at/near the rim, BECAUSE he didn’t wanna go to the line. It was mildly frustrating, but no big deal because he wasn’t asked to do it often and was a glue guy sixth man who did literally everything else. I can only imagine the levels of frustration Sixers fans had watching their high usage second best player playing hot potato a la Andris Biedrins in those playoff games"
"He’s a bust in the same way Lebron would be a bust, after being nicknamed King James, and went on to have a career like Andre Iguodala or something similar.  I dunno if Wiggins took on the nicknames like Air Canada or Maple Jordan but…"
"Should of just done a ""can you win a championship with a team of these 35+ (year old) players""?  **Starting 5:**  * Al Horford (35) * Paul Millsap (36) * Lebron James (36) * P.J.

Andre Iguodala is balding like a motherfucker tho
Robert Horry is on a short list of guys who don't seem to age at all;  \- Richard Jefferson  \- Andre Iguodala  \- Jeff Green  I'm sure there's others but they seem to have looked the same age forever
"KD, Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Javalle McGee  Andre Iguodala, Seth Curry, Harrison Barnes, Tobias Harris, Thybulle"
"Not sure about 82-0, but I think this could be close:  KD, Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, and some role players like Andre Iguodala but younger"
"You gotta split LeBron’s career in 2 main pieces:   •Spurs (Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Kawhi Leonard) Tim Duncan caused the most damage offensively, so I would consider Tim Duncan to be his greatest rival from 07-14.  •Warriors (Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala) Stephen Curry has played longer than KD on the warriors and has had a leader role for almost his  whole career, thats why I believe Stephen Curry is LeBron’s greatest rival from 2015 to now."
"Not exactly under my control, sparky, but it seems pretty inappropriate - Curry's married and I think Iguodala might be too.  I think Andre was fine with picking up some rings, though."
Andre Iguodala is Steph's #1 Superfan and I love that for him.
Andre Iguodala has VIP access to my ear - either of my ears - 24/7. Always a pleasure when this dude shares his mind.
You can’t keep a pride flag on your set and then welcome a homophobic bum like Andre Iguodala as a guest. Iggy keeps trying to build up Steph Curry because he knows association with Curry is his only claim to fame.
"Yep, assuming Draymond wins in 2016 FMVP rankings would go IMO (Only using Finals performance, not playoffs as a whole):  1. Kevin Durant 2017 2. LeBron James 2012 3. Kevin Durant 2018 4. Kawhi Leonard 2019 5. LeBron James 2013 6. Dirk Nowitzki 2011 7. Kobe Bryant 2010 8. Draymond Green 2016 9. Kawhi Leonard 2014 10. Andre Iguodala 2015"
The shade on 2015 NBA FINALS MVP ANDRE IGUODALA.
"I love that team. Shaun Livingston, Andre Iguodala, Bogut, Draymond, Klay and Steph all overachieved so well. There’s so many comebacks and redemptions on that team.  It’s one of the best I’ve seen in my lifetime, just pure passion and unity."
"Kyrie's reputation as a playoff performer is almost entirely due to the one shot in game 7.  In fact, Kyrie and PG have been two of the least clutch playoff scorers of the past decade.

Andre Iguodala won FMVP and I never thought he was very good at all
"Dumb  Andre Iguodala has a Finals MVP, is he above Chris?   It's a holistic picture. Chris is top 5 point guard all time. Go back to school nephew"
People really think Klay Thompson is Andre Iguodala on defense 😭
[GIMME IGUODALA](https://giphy.com/gifs/nba-expression-gsw-andre-iguodala-KD7kZWYmawHUb9LEZs)
"a shooter’s reputation matters waaaay more than how they’re currently shooting. roberson would have to shoot 60% contested threes from the logo for a whole season before any defense ever takes him seriously. it’s great that a professional shooting guard shot 32% though with all five defenders eating popcorn 90 feet away daring him to pull up  i read that every team recruiting kd that year had video highlights about how he had to work waaaaay too fucking hard to generate offense. you’re reciting KD’s shooting that series like apex draymond green (he’s washed now), andre iguodala and klay Thompson weren’t swarming him on every possession"
andre iguodala almost signed with the kings before landing with the warriors
"MVP: Dwyane Wade, Jerry West, or Kawhi Leonard   DPOY: Tim Duncan   SMOTY: Andre Iguodala  FMVP: Steph Curry"
Andre Iguodala is a lot less likeable after reading his crappy book.
"Andre Iguodala when he retires belongs in the hall of fame. He was also robbed of multiple 6th man of the year awards.  Which brings me to my second point. The way the BB HOF is judged is terrible. The BB HOF tends to rate players box score states and career totals heavily. This is falling behind how baseball does their HOF. Basketball is fundamentally different than baseball. Theoretically and actually every season a player can put up good box score numbers in basketball and still not contribute towards actually winning basketball games. Meanwhile in baseball it's more one on one, aside from defense offensive numbers are generally accurate if you get a lot of homers you help your team win. Basketball is all about synergy a 20 ppg player might stifle the offense or hurt the team badly in other ways.   So with basketball a player should be judged more on how they helped their team win. Iguodala was a part of a historically good ""death lineup"" that changed the way basketball was played, and helped get the warriors to a bunch of finals and three rings. He even won the finals MVP.  I am sure there are other players just like that, and there are many players like Mitch Richmond that maybe should not be in the HOF."
"If only he pull ""Andre Iguodala"", win a championship and final mvp, what are the chances they put him in the ballot. I seen comment above and forgotten he won gold medal twice.   Edit: oh wait, its basketball HoF , oh hell yeah. Of course he gets in."
"Obviously win shares is a flawed stat and does favor players with longer careers like Melo, but looking at who is just behind him some of the names are pretty good suggestions IMO:  Hal Greer  Alex English  Andre Iguodala  Jerry Lucas  Grant Hill  TMac  Lenny Wilkins  Bobby Jones  Ben Wallace  Amare  Kevin Johnson"
"&gt;  Listen to your logic: If a player has to take breaks on defense to perform on offense, then he’s not a good defender (he may have good defense skills but he’s not helping the team on the defensive end).  Okay, so rather than refute my arguments, you've moved onto another unrelated and incorrect point.  Here's a fun fact:  FVV scored more points per possession more efficiently after Steph switched off of him.  Here's another fun fact:  Kyle Lowry scored fewer points per possession on lower efficiency when Steph switched onto him.  Steph is not an elite defender, I never made that argument.  But people who argue he's a bad defender don't watch his defense and don't understand how much your brain matters on that end.  &gt;  I’m not saying he’s terrible on defense, but he’s not a top 10 isolation defender just because some metrics rank him top 10.  Actually he's pretty good.  In the history of the finals, no player has ever been targeted as much on switches as Stephen Curry.  And there's a reason for that, it roughs him up and tires him for the other end, it's a strategy that works.  But in isolation in the playoffs (think LeBron and Harden) he actually held them to fewer points per possession on lower efficiency with more turnovers than their averages.  People think because they hunt him that he's a bad defender.  They hunt him so he doesn't drop 40 points in 22 shots on offense.  They hunt him because their other options were Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston etc.  He does particularly well against stronger, taller players because he's stronger than he has any right to be and a low center of gravity relative to them.  People like JR Smith embarrass themselves trying to take advantage of that ""mismatch"".  Does that mean he's going to stop LeBron a meaningful amount?  No, he needs serious helpside to guard a 6'8 monster like LBJ.  But he does a pretty good job of holding his ground until help rotates or steering him into more defenders."
"I'm gonna say it, I use to really dislike Andre Iguodala.   But then he came here and that changed"
"With the fate of the universe on the line, Martians have the death beam poitnted at us? Andre Iguodala"
Andre Iguodala
"  Wariors advance to first West finals since '76 after closing out Grizzlies  MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Stephen Curry practices tough shots every day. The MVP came up with a third-quarter buzzer-beater his coach calls the play of the game. For Golden State, rank it among the Warriors' best shots in decades, and it helped put them in their first Western Conference finals since 1976.  Curry scored 32 points with that 62-footer among eight 3-pointers, and the Warriors beat the Memphis Grizzlies a third straight game, 108-95, on Friday night.  ""In a closeout game like that, that's a big turning point and the moment's magnified,"" said Curry, the NBA's MVP. ""I made one in college like that. That's the last I made anywhere past half court and same kind of shot: loose ball, grab it, throw it up and knock it down."" First-year coach Steve Kerr called this a beautiful team win and a big moment for the Warriors. He said Curry was amazing, especially with that shot as the Grizzlies tried to make a run in the third quarter. ""It wasn't quite a closeout shot, but it was the play of the game,"" Kerr said. The Warriors advanced with some of the best shooting in the NBA postseason since 1985, becoming the first team since that year to hit 14 or more 3s in three consecutive playoff games. Curry was 8-of-13 from beyond the arc as the Warriors knocked down their playoff-best 15 3-pointers. Curry, who had 10 assists for his first double-double this postseason, hit the shot of the night after Andre Iguodala blocked Jeff Green's shot near midcourt. Curry grabbed the loose ball and beat the buzzer from the Grizzlies' 3-point line for a 76-68 lead. Klay Thompson had 20 points for Golden State, and Draymond Green added 16, Harrison Barnes 13 and Shaun Livingston 10. Memphis coach Dave Joerger said he hadn't seen the replay of Curry's shot. Grizzlies guard Mike Conley said he thought Green was fouled and that his teammates stopped playing, waiting for the call, and then Curry threw up the shot. ""It was tough to realize and kind of grasp it all in the same time,"" Conley said. The Warriors will play the winner of the Los Angeles Clippers-Houston Rockets series in the conference finals. That series will start Tuesday night at Golden State. Curry says the opponent does not matter. ""We'll obviously be watching on Sunday to figure it out,"" Curry said of the Clippers-Rockets Game 7. ""I feel like if we do what we're supposed to do in the next round, we'll be all right."" Marc Gasol led Memphis with 21 points and 15 rebounds. Vince Carter added 16 off the bench, Zach Randolph had 15, Courtney Lee 12 and Conley 11. Curry finished the series with 25 3-pointers, one more than the Grizzlies managed as a team. When he beat the buzzer with that long 3, he celebrated by bumping chests with Iguodala and David Lee. He then added 11 points in the fourth quarter to finish off the Grizzlies. ""It's just one of those special moments,"" Grizzlies guard Tony Allen said of Curry. ""He's a special kind of guy. They make those kind of shots."" That stellar shooting helped the Warriors win a second series in the same postseason for the first time since capturing the title in 1975, and they never trailed in this game. The Warriors outshot, outrebounded and simply did everything better than Memphis early, looking like the team that dominated the NBA regular season. Golden State led 32-19 by the end of the first quarter and Memphis had one more field goal (seven) than the Warriors had 3-pointers (six). The ""Splash Brothers"" outscored the Grizzlies by themselves, combining for 22 points. But Curry and Thompson got plenty of help with teammates taking turns knocking down shots. ""I think what you see with their team is I think that they really grew up,"" Joerger said. ""They really grew through the battle of this series and matured to the point where I think that will help them, unfortunately, in the future being able to take the hits that they took and the physicality that I think we are known for."" Memphis tried to rally, opening the third quarter with a 13-5 spurt with two free throws by Green pulling the Grizzlies within 63-62 with 3:59 left. Green hit a jumper to get them within 65-64 before the Warriors finished the quarter on an 11-4 run capped by Curry's amazing 3. Memphis got within eight with 6:03 left and got no closer as Curry knocked down consecutive 3s. --- TIP-INS  Warriors: Curry had been 0-for-32, 0-of-3 in the playoffs, on shots from the backcourt before his 62-footer. ... The Warriors are 13-7 all time in Game 6s and improved to 9-2 in their past 11. ... They are 54-5 this season and postseason combined when making at least 10 3-pointers, including 7-0 these playoffs. Grizzlies: Allen, who had 24 steals in his first nine playoff games, tried to play with the injured left hamstring that kept him out of Game 5. But he played only 5 minutes before going to the bench for the night, unable to move effectively. ... Memphis had only three turnovers, the fewest ever in a playoff game against Golden State. The Lakers had six on March 31, 1969, against Golden State. ... Memphis is 4-2 all time in Game 6s, losing its past two. REMEMBERING B.B. The Grizzlies played a video tribute and held a moment of silence before the national anthem in memory of musician B.B. King, who died late Thursday at the age of 89. King got his nickname early in his career playing live in Memphis as the ""Beale Street Blues Boy,"" which later was shortened to B.B."
"Rudy Gay, Andre Iguodala, and Josh Smith the GOATs"
This is similar to asking if a player wasnt full of injuries how good would they have been. But I personally think he just needed little more help Andre iguodala was his best partner at his prime and he joined Melo later in his career.
"The funniest thing is the retrospective narrative around The Warriors to undermine their achievements.  The constant complaints around being a ""stacked team"" to ""got lucky with injuries"" but before 2015 the stacked Warriors were made up of:  Steph Curry who was considered too small, too frail, too unathletic and an ankle injury away from being shipped out of the league  Klay Thompson who was considered a role-playing spot-up shooter at best (Marco Bellineli comparisons) because of his athletic limitations  Draymond Green who was considered a tweener with no true position and a high probability of fading out of the league  Andre Iguodala who was celebrated as a versatile two-way swingman but also heavily criticized in his Sixers days as being too passive and not a championship calibre SG  Andrew Bogut who was considered an unfortunate draft bust due to his injuries  And a collective of uncelebrated veteran journeymen like Shaun Livingston, Leandro Barbosa and Ian Clarkson"
Andre iguodala is James Milner.
"Nate is an idiot reading tea leaves. He is a baby. Never played College ball (3 games), didn't have a preseason with the Warriors. Sat with covid complications and then injury. Was forced into the starting position because Kerr was trying everything to win. Though still recovering, he's got a new coaching staff geared to development. He still has Dray, but now has Andre Iguodala as floor coaches. Still has Looney, but now has Bjelica and Porter to take minutes. Kerr has expressed his desire to rim protect and play defense. He'll be sitting a lot, and practicing even more. He now has to prove he deserves minutes. He either development and mature into it, or not, but he has the tools to be a top 3 or 4 center in a 2 or 3 years. That's my bet."
"He was a big part of every game, especially the ones he won. Judging Andre Iguodala by TS% is the dumbest fucking thing you could do, and you say I’m trolling. He’s just like draymond where he impacts the game in so many ways.   Nobody said he’s a star, but he’s the ultimate glue guy as a role player and is great on both ends."
"KD is not a great 1v1 defender starting at the 3 pt line. Kobe is. Kobe's offense is also much quicker than KD when KD is on defense. In a 5v5 game, Kobe let team work help his defense so he could coast in his later years because Kobe was smart, but in a 1v1 Kobe wouldn't have to coast because they are only going to 21. People said during a 1v1 game it seemed like Kobe's stamina was unlimited even in his later prime years.  Everyone talking about KD having the ability to block Kobe's shots, but you also have to think about putting the ball on the floor too where Kobe isn't going to let KD dribble in front of him easily. KD would have to play his back to Kobe from the 3 point line in which would make KD have to show case his post-up play which is not as great as people think. Kobe is by far one of the best post up players for his size. Both players playing post up starting at the 3 point line favors Kobe hands down.  Lakers used to play 1v1 in their regular practice and there was a story of Kobe literally never letting a person score a single time during a whole practice session. It is often noted that Kobe has never lost a 1v1 even to elite defenders. You can read handfuls of stories about Kobe 1v1'ing X guy and Kobe beating them. 1v1 was literally Kobes shining point in his game which is why dude was doubled out past the 3 point line his prime in the playoffs. You literally don't let Kobe 1v1 anyone or else it's automatic bucket.  At the end of the day, Kobe's foot work would cook KD and if they were playing make it take it where Kobe got the ball first, Kobe probably wouldn't even let KD score a single time. We also have to remember that people like Iguodala has said that 1v1, Kobe is the hardest player to guard he had ever played, and he played alongside prime KD while defending him for years and went against a prime Kobe while Iguodala was at his prime defensively. He said this before Kobe died, so there's no saying Andre was just saying that cause Kobe passed away."
"Even though Steph is by far the greatest shooter of all time, he didn't have enough experience, size, or the shooting mechanics to shoot highly contested 3s in 2019 and before. And he still did fairly well because of his release.  Guys like Kawhi generally jump and then shoot at the apex of a shot. This is extremely inefficient energy transfer, but it allows for a player to have a better chance of shooting over a defender. Mix that with his size and arm length, a player like Kawhi or KD is much better suited to take a contested shot. Kawhi has been moving somewhat closer to a single shooting motion in some cases to help with fatigue or to offset his injury, but he doesn't always do that. Given that Steph initially could only shoot if he were uncontested (and because Steph has a historically quick release, I mean that someone is not already in his face and he has no chance to get a shot up that someone is not already guarding), this was not a bad take by Max.  That being said, Max didn't explain anything other than by making it seem like IGUODALA was just more clutch than Steph. And I'm not sure Max even understood or cared about the nuance. But it was technically true, though only in the context of a a heavily guarded Steph at the end of games (where they knew he would have to take the shot so they double teamed him) vs a lightly guarded or wide open Andre IGUODALA."
KD: PJ Tucker  Harden: Lu Dort  Curry: Fred Vanvleet  LeBron: Kawhi Leonard  Giannis: Kawhi Leonard  Kawhi: Andre Iguodala   Jokic: Deandre Ayton  Embiid: Marc Gasol  Dame: Jrue Holdiay
"My guesses were:  * KD * Giannis (I thought maybe against the Pistons or something) * Anthony Davis * Donovan Mitchell * John Wall * Devin Booker * Andre Iguodala  I was certain of #5 and #6 and I guessed #7 was going to be either from the Warriors or Cavaliers, because he was never going to be one of the stars and for a role player, bad FT shooter to shoot at least 20 free throws he would need a lot of games."
The ol' Andre Iguodala FMVP
"So Klay coming off two years of rest because of two brutal injuries, a 37 year old Andre Iguodala, and an improved Jordan Poole are going to take them from a non-playoff team to a title contender?"
"They were projected as a 7th/8th seed at best. I remember for an extended period they didn't have anyone averaging over 15 points a game, yet they were one of the best offenses in the league. They didn't even get one all-star nod despite being one of the top teams.  Ty Lawson/Andre Miller/Julyan Stone  Andre Iguodala/Evan Fournier  Danilo Gallinari/Corey Brewer/Jordan Hamilton  Kenneth Faried/Wilson Chandler/Anthony Randolph  Kosta Koufos/JaVale McGee/Timofey Mozgov  No eye popping stars, but the roster was pretty deep and well coached."
"&gt; while Iggy refused to report to the team.   Grizz told Iggy to stay away in summer while they were trying to trade him to teams like Mavericks (didn't want him to get hurt) and then Iguodala held them to their promise.    Good for Andre, Grizz tried to double dip by getting a 1st from the Warriors and additional assets from Mavs.  But in the end their greed costed them even more money."
"Pretty sure that was in relation to Andre Iguodala and their refusal to buy out his expiring $17 million contract. But since they ended up trading him (along with Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill) for the combined $85 million in salary of Dion Waiters, Gorgui Dieng, and Justise Winslow, I'm not sure they actually got any assets back. In two years those three players combined to play only 65 games for Memphis, and now all of them are no longer on the roster, with none being traded to bring back anything further."
"[Celtics defy legalized segregation and pushback to draft the first black NBA player in 1950.](https://ca.nba.com/news/the-everlasting-legacy-of-charles-chuck-cooper-the-first-black-player-drafted-in-the-nba/1dp8lmes8uuv31we7r4r1uckaf) The second black player believes he wouldn't have made it to the league without the Celtics making this pick.

"An underrated misstep was fucking up the 2004 draft.  They had the 10th pick in a loaded draft and they came out of it with Luke Jackson who was a bust.  The 7th pick was Luol Deng, the 9th pick was Andre Iguodala, the Cavs could have tried to move up in the draft.  The 7th pick was the Suns and they basically sold it for cash and a future pick.  It was available.  There was a lot of value in the second half of the first round too.  Josh Smith was the 17th pick.  JR Smith was 18.  Tony Allen and Kevin Martin were in the 20s."

Andre Iguodala?
Surprised Andre Iguodala isn't on the list tbh. No other player I'd trust more with a Martian death beam pointed at Earth
Andre Iguodala from Nuggets days but without the vertical.
If current day Thaddeus young thought he was prime Andre iguodala
When he said he would take Andre Iguodala if the fate of the world/ game is on the line over Stephen Curry……
"&gt; bench = supporting cast  No, bench specifically refers to…the bench.   &gt; And what exactly did the Warriors do this offseason? Get back 38yo Iggy? Sign Otto Porter while losing Oubre?  Drafted Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody. Signed Otto Porter Jr, Nemanja Bjelica, and Andre Iguodala.   &gt;  No one seriously thinks Warriors got better if we don't factor in Klay yet.  They improved significantly. You can’t seriously think Oubre, Bazemore, Paschall, and Wanamaker contribute more to winning than OPJ, Moody, Kuminga, Bjelica, and Iguodala…"
"&gt;	The list of active NBA players with at least 2 Championships is actually surprisingly short: ​  1. (1 player) Lebron James ​  1.

"I WANT IGUODALA: Spell card  If max Kellerman is on the field, special summon one andre iguodala. If the field spell ""fate of the universe"" is on the field, Andre iguodala gains 2000 ATK"
"If he's willing to do what Andre Iguodala did and be a role player, he can be a key piece of a championship squad. Idk if he'd win Finals MVP or anything, but hey, did anyone ever think Iggy would?"
"Kawhi needs a more complementary team? Did you not see KD having to leave the thunder to go play with Steph Klay and Draymond??? Kawhi took Lowry and Siakam as his two best players to win a championship.  And for the defensive competition aspect, go take a look at 2019. Kawhi averaged 30.5 ppg on 49/38/88 shooting splits while going up against defenders such as: Aaron Gordon, Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Tobias Harris, Khris Middleton, Giannis Antetokuompo, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala.  I'll wait for you to let me know when KD has ever faced that many elite defenders in one playoff run.  Also, I remember when KD was going crazy vs the Pat Beverly Clippers, people didn't seem to care about how shitty the defenders he was playing."
"From a times article &gt;&gt; Ribbing, in fact, became an essential part of the Golden State program. In his upcoming memoir, The Sixth Man, Warriors forward Andre Iguodala recalls a team-building exercise in which players were asked to recall the moments in a game during which they felt the highest. “When Klay’s turn came, we all assumed he was going to say that his highest moment was the the day he scored 37 points in a quarter against Sacramento,” Iguodala writes. “I mean, that was an NBA record! But he didn’t. Instead he said, ‘My best moment was one night I caught a pass and I was like fifty feet from the basket and I was about to shoot it. And all of a sudden, I hear Andre being like, ‘What the fuck, Klay? You’re fifty feet out.’ And I thought about it for a second and shot it anyway. It went in, and I was like, ‘Yeah, Andre, fuck you.’ We all had a good laugh about that. I was like, ‘Wow, really dog? That was your best moment?'”"
"So this trade is talked about (or at least was) a fair bit, but it hasn't been mentioned here and it might be one of the most disasterous trades of all time.  The Dwight Howard - Andrew Bynum trade.  Philly gets: Andrew Bynum - never plays a game for them and two years later is out of the league  Jason Richardson - is mostly hurt during his two years with the team only playing 52 Games  LA gets: Dwight Howard - spends one year with the team that is pretty much an unmitigated disaster, sustains a back injury and is never quite the same player.   Chris Duhon - plays one year with the lakers and then retires  Earl Clark - plays one year for the lakers, shows a little promise but never improves from there and is out of the league by 2015  Denver Gets: Andre Iguodala - While he was able to help the team to over 50 wins, he leaves after the season to go to the Warriors.    Orlando Gets: Nikola Vucevic - Solid all-star level player for many years on bad Magic teams.  Gets traded to the Bulls in 2021  Aaron Afflalo - A good stats on a bad team player for 2 Magic seasons before getting traded for Evan Fornier  Al Harrington - Plays only 10 games with the Magic during his only season before being waived  Moe Harkless - His time in Orlando was not great, even after a promising rookie season.  His playing time declined and he was traded to Portland in 2015  Josh McRoberts - Played one season for the Magic before being traded to the bobcats for Hakim Warrick  Christian Eyenga - Never played a game for the Magic  2013 2nd Rounder from Nuggets - Became Romero Osby who never played in the NBA  2014 1st Rounder from the Sixers - Became Dario Saric, traded back to the Sixers for Elfrid Payton  2017 1st Rounder from the Sixers - Traded back to Sixers in the Elfrid Payton deal.  Then traded to the Kings and became De'Aaron Fox  Protected 1st Rounder from the Lakers - Eventually transfers as two 2nd rounders in 2017.  Magic use the first on Wesley Iwundu, and the second is traded to the Nets and used on Rodions Kurucs in 2018  The Sixers and the Lakers get totally destroyed by this trade.  Both teams end up becoming two of the worst teams in the NBA for years directly following the trade.    The Nuggets were able to have a good year directly following the trade with Iguodala being a large contributor, but he still leaves the next year.  The Magic is a mixed bag,  Vucevic was probably the gem of this trade playing a high level for the Magic for several years.  Afflalo was also a good contributor to this Magic team.  but while the Magic likely expected to be bad right after the trade I don't think they expected to have not made any meaningful progress up the standings a decade later.  A lot of this is bad management (Getting Elfrid Payton when you could have had De'Aaron Fox and Dario Saric is particularly bad), but it is pretty clear they didn't get the pieces they needed to build for the future like they thought they were getting."
Andre Iguodala
"It's that bandwagon Warriors thing. All of them just rub me the wrong way: Curry, Kerr, Green and especially Iguodala since he used to play for us. Max Kellerman saying ""life on the line, I want Andre Iguodala taking the last shot"" was pretty annoying. Then they got Durant and it just made it all worse. Talk about loading the already loaded dice. EDIT: Forgot to add, I hate Curry the most! lol"
Actually tony Parker may be fighting for that last spot with andre iguodala
"As with all things there is a middle ground between what either side wants that needs to be found. Teams having all the power is terrible for the players/league. Players refusing to play is bad for the teams/fans/league.  I kinda feel like it's totally fair for there to be huge repercussions for players on huge contracts refusing to play. I also think there are obviously huge issues with ""when does this apply"", and selective enforcement. Teams obviously want to be considered well by upcoming FAs, which means if you enforce any sort of punishment and you're not a huge market team, you may be shooting yourself in the foot. Memphis paid Andre Iguodala a bunch of money even though he refused to report, which, to me, fucking sucks."
Andre Iguodala is a secret Earth guardian
"He's injured, which can happen, but we have a big who's not actually worse than some of the other bigs we've had to trot out.  He was raw as hell but he improved rapidly last season. Now he's being coached by the guy who taught Jokic how to play basketball and getting mentored by Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala.  It's way too soon to judge a player who had to go into his rookie year **with no training camp** and having played 3 games since high school."
"I know that Landry Shamet (as a draft pick) was part of the big trade that sent Andrew Bynum to Philly, Dwight Howard to the Lakers, and Andre Iguodala to the Nuggets"
"During Nash's prime they traded 2 separate first round picks for cash. That included a 7th overall pick with which they could have gotten Luol Deng (picked 7th) or Andre Iguodala (picked 9th).   They low balled Joe Johnson, causing him to walk.   They traded a 1st round pick for Kurt Thomas, then traded two more 1st round picks to dump Kurt Thomas' salary.   So I guess what they could have done better is actually use their picks on players."
"Chris Bosh, it’s not even about Vince leaving, but because Rob Babcock passed up drafting Danny Granger and Andre Iguodala in back to back drafts to take Rafa Arujo and Joey fucking Graham. And then there is the whole Bargnani pick to top everything off"
"Was Andre Iguodala another NBA 75 snub?  Obviously 1x FMVP, but I haven't seen anyone really mention him on /r/nba or anywhere in the media. Do people just think the Warriors 2015 championship was a fluke or sth? There are other guys with only 1 ring that have been discussed as ""locks"" (Pierce, KG, etc)... And guys without rings that got it (Dame).   Help me out fam. Do you think Andre Iguodada is jealous of Dame?"

"LeBron and Steph. Born in the same hospital should play on the same team. We'll give the Lakers Jordan Bell since they like centers, and a finals MVP in Andre Iguodala, I'm sure he'll understand."
"We're talking about Ray Allen versus Worthy, not Pierce. I agree that Pierce should be in over Worthy, but those guys are both above Ray Allen. And James Worthy was vastly superior to Andre Iguodala. I know Worthy is before your time, but trust me, they're not even comparable players. In Game 7 of the 1988 Finals Worthy put up 36 points (on 15-22 shooting), 16 rebounds and 10 assists and was the leading scorer for the Lakers in that series, which the Lakers won. You never saw Iguodala doing anything like that."
"Frankly, I'm surprised Andre Iguodala is still alive"
That’s vintage Andre Iguodala
"Agreed. I don't think Melo is either. Pierce may not be either, I haven't really dug into the whole list, but I think Dame, Dwight and Melo have already proved to better than Pierce was. Pierce gets an outsized amount of credit just for that FMVP (I don't see Chauncey Billups, Andre Iguodala or Tony Parker on this list) and because he played for the Celtics. Pierce was leading the Celtics to consecutive tanking seasons before KG and Ray Allen showed up, but people overlook that for whatever reason."
"Lmao how is Andre Iguodala winning FMVP  used to discredit the fact that Pierce was also a FMVP. That’s a great accolade.  As for Reggie Miller, at the time he had the record for most 3 pointers and in a sense redefined the term 3 point shooter.  I get you are a Blazers fan, but you are obviously bias toward Dame."
You’d be happy to know when I visited Lhasa about a decade ago my guide took me to a local basketball court to play 3 on 3. After we played he told me how much he liked Andre Iguodala.
"Andre Iguodala is clearly the face of the Warriors dynasty, they were never successful without him."
holy shit i forgot andre iguodala was still in the league lol
Andre Iguodala is gonna pull the old ex-patriots trick of being shit everywhere except Golden State
"&gt; Toronto was a disaster franchise and he wanted out,  I want people to understand how bad Toronto was run back then, and why I could understand why Carter wanted out. Instead of drafting Andre  Iguodala they drafted a player who didn't even last through his rookie contract (with a top 10 pick mind you)... who had been projected *at best* to be a very late 1st round pick (but at best shouldn't even have been a 2nd round pick, never mind top 10).  Why?    Because of ""need"".      This same GM traded Vince with years left on his contract for a 1st round pick in the teens and the privileged of *paying* Alanzo Mourning to walk away (he was injured and wasn't going to report... so they bought him out).   **To summarize:** The franchise was so bad, they wasted a top 10 pick. Then traded an All-star started in the middle of a contract for 1 pick and *paying someone NOT to show up*.      So was Carter dogging it? Yes. And that is why."
Or Andre Iguodala
"The ""Memphis vs. Andre Iguodala"" phenomenon."
You should be more worried about your own team:  * Steph Curry has missed 115 games in the last five years due to various injuries  * Klay Thompson has missed each of the last two years and won't be back until December or January  * Wiseman missed half of last season and is at least going to miss the first couple months of this season with an injury  * Otto Porter Jr. has missed 120 games over the last three seasons with injuries  * Kevon Looney has missed 56 games in the last two years with injuries  * Andre Iguodala is older than anyone on the Lakers (which is saying something)  * Draymond Green has missed 47 games over the last 3 years with injuries

"Well here’s an entirely new topic no one was talking about. Kinda showing your hand that it’s just a bone to pick and a hater stance.  But sure let’s go there.   Zach Lowe, a voter , and Andre Iguodala , the winner. Both said a mistake was made in 2015. But aight."
"It's kinda like when people say Andre Iguodala or Kawhi Shut down Lebron. It's more they kept him from going Nuclear, and were able to do it mostly on their own."
Hmmm...Andre Iguodala on when he was on the Warriors championship team. I thought he was like top 3 best swingman in the league at that time just based off of his impact on the team. You could also say Alex Caruso
"The great khali, andre iguodala, rondo"
"&gt; He's never made an all-nba game for example, it's not about offense vs defense, it's the overall package.  But that's the point.  We say things like ""the overall package"" but what we really mean is ""offense, and maybe if you're really good at offense, we'll also count your defense.""   Yeah, Andre never made an all-NBA team, absolutely true: and based on every measure we have of actual production on the court that accurately reflects defense, that's a huge mistake. He was CLEARLY a top-12 player in the league during that period. The fact is that defense as a whole is hugely undervalued (less so today, but even still it is today) and shot creation is over-valued.  We deem players who are worse than Iguodala was in that period ""superstars.""  e.g., Westbrook. I guess what we mean by ""superstars"" is ""floor-raising offensive players.""  I mean, that's what gets your all-star nods and all-NBA nods.  (Interestingly enough, I remember an interview Iguodala gave about this. He basically said that in terms of giving advice to his son, or to another young player, that he wouldn't recommend that they took the path he did, because scorers get all the accolades and thus way more money. He won more, taking his path, but he left a lot of money on the table.)  The only defense-first all-NBA players you ever get are centers, and that's because in some years there simply aren't any great offensive centers. I mean, look at the all-NBA teams - where are the great defensive non-centers who weren't also scoring 18+ppg in that season? Are you saying no such players exist? (And bear in mind, some of those guys who made all-NBA teams were really bad at defense, while Iguodala was NOT really bad at offense).   In any event, if the point is that the conventional wisdom vastly underrates elite defense that isn't coupled with volume scoring, especially from non-centers, then pointing to all-NBA teams doesn't really argue for much since all-NBA is voted on by the media that largely represents the conventional wisdom.   &gt; The realities of player movement is stars want to move to other stars. If you get the first one then it's easier to get the second or even third one. The hard part is getting the first one.  The Knicks were never able to build around Carmelo. Portland's never been able to get a second star to go with Dame. Dallas never found a second star to go with Dirk, and to date haven't managed to do so with Luka. Indiana was never able to get a second guy next to PG. It doesn't seem like people have been lining up to play with Giannis or Kawhi.   &gt; What strategy should Hinkie have followed that was better?  Not trading Jrue Holiday.   &gt;  Their long term title chances are better now after they bottomed out, picked Trae Young really high.  Atlanta never said, ""let's trade a great young player to bottom out.""   Atlanta was in a position where they lost some guys to free agency, some of their free agency acquisitions weren't as good as they hoped, and they suddenly found themselves with no good players.   That's the difference between all these other teams and what Philly did. Atlanta wasn't in a hurry to get good, and they weren't averse to letting guys go for assets, but their philosophy was ""draft upside guys with star potential - get the 19, 20-year old kids who might grow into something special.""   And they got those guys, and put them in a system to try to get them working together, building something.   Also, I think you're under-valuing Atlanta's title equity in 2015, when they were 3-1 against the Cavs in the regular season and then the NYPD broke the leg of guy the team was counting on to make LeBron work for it. (LeBron was 24-5-6 with a -10 pts/100 differential against the Hawks in the regular season. 30/11/9 with a +15 pts/100 differential in the ECF). But of course, Thabo, as a defensive wing who doesn't score a lot, was not seen by the general public as a significant loss despite literally being the front line of their defense against LeBron)."

I met Andre Iguodala. It was at a little coffee shop right next to my office. There was only about three other people in the shop with so it was a little surreal. It was right after he got traded from the Warriors so I just thanked him for everything he did for the Dubs and how much I appreciate him as a fan. Really cool dude.
Andre Iguodala the only Finals MVP to not make the list is another good guess.
"High: Was a fan of these players before they got drafted and often wondered why they werent picked a bit higher.   Dwyane Wade, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins, Deandre Jordan, Andre Iguodala, Danny Granger, Paul George, Joakim Noah, Roy Hibbert, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, 	   Domantas Sabonis, Tyler Herro, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Tyrese Haliburton.   &amp;#x200B;  Wrong: I thought these players would be pretty good before the draft.  Marcus Williams, Ben McLemore, Rodney Stuckey, Chris Douglas-Roberts, Earl Clark, Wesley Johnson, Kévin Séraphin, Andrew Nicholson, Nerlens Noel, Rashad Vaughn, Justin Patton, Wendell Carter Jr., Goga Bitadze.'Too soon, but I was high on Jalen Smith, Zeke Nnaji."
"Cade:  * Ceiling: Luka * Floor: Kyle Anderson  Green:  * Ceiling: Kobe * Floor: Jamal Crawford  Mobley:   * Ceiling: KG / Giannis with a jump shot * Floor: Larry Sanders with better offense  Barnes:  * Ceiling: Ben Simmons / Andre Iguodala / more athletic Draymond * Floor: Having some trouble with this one... He's going to be a solid defender no matter what, and he's got point forward skills. Jabari Parker who I saw mentioned in another comment isn't a terrible comparison.  Suggs:  * Ceiling: Deron Williams / not fat Baron Davis * Floor: Rodney Stuckey"
Nate Robinson winning over Andre Iguodala
He lost finals MVP honors to journeyman legend Andre Iguodala
"Yeah agreed... but Shaq is too low too. How is he beneath Kobe?  Anyway, funnily enough Andre Iguodala compared KD to Shaq on JJ Redick's podcast, said how he's just ""too good"" he doesn't even count when discussing the best players in the league lol. near the end of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0T1_XK0DwA"
"Kante’s closest NBA comp is probably like peak Andre Iguodala maybe? Insane defender, takes care of the ball, great passer. Everything but a scorer basically."
CJ McCollum would be an awesome analyst IMO.  I think also Andre Iguodala would be interesting as an occasional contributor.
"There is a SBnation article where their own source says Andre family member was sitting behind the Warriors owner telling them how much Iggy liked the Warriors.   With the OWNER of the warriors being on record saying   &gt;This has some added credence with Warriors' owner Joe Lacob telling Rusty Simmons of the San Francisco Chronicle that Iguodala's cousin sat behind Golden State during the playoff series and went out of his way to indicate Iguodala ""liked"" the organization.  Let's just take Karl out of the picture for argument sake.   A player who has expressed a desire to play for the opposing team, who subsequently goes on to join said team was not the mole for Mark Jackson after Jackson said   &gt; I got inside information that some people don't like that brand of basketball and they clearly didn't co-sign it,"" Jackson said. ""They wanted to let me know they have no parts in what was taking place. Let the best team win. And let everybody, with the exception of going down with a freak injury, let everybody leave out of here healthy. That's not good basketball  Source: www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2013/12/1/5162790/andre-iguodala-mole-nuggets-warriors-george-karl-playoffs  It's a real case of ""who done it"" guess we'll never know. It couldn't have been the dude that would sign with the team month later, that would be absurd.   It's probably the janitor that told Jackson."
Iguodala smash!  Seriously though it was obvious an accident and Andre seemed to feel pretty bad about it.
"“Yo James, you a 14 year old little bitch.” - Andre Iguodala"
"Andre ""George Michael"" Iguodala"
&gt;The Warriors welcomed free agent Otto Porter and welcomed back Andre Iguodala  The Bjelica disrespect.
"We had some other dudes laying breaks though, to be fair. JTA, Bradley, Iguodala, Kuminga, and Galloway combined for 1/20 from 3PT. The Kelly Oubre special.  That said, we know JTA can hit from deep (&gt;40% last year). We know Galloway is not gonna be on the squad, and Andre isn't going to be attempting 3s as often in the regular season. Kuminga hopefully picks it up there, and Bradley, if he makes the team, probably won't get as many minutes/attempts either."
Andre Iguodala
"Andre Iguodala. Not a great scorer or shooter, good passer and defender but certainly not the best. Great third option on a good team."
Andre Iguodala
Andre Iguodala in his prime was one of those dudes.
Luke Walton wanted the ball over Kobe. Andre Iguodala refuses to pass. Steve Kerr shit talked his teammates in NBA championship celebrations. Richard Jefferson misses free throws.
You… you think Andre Iguodala was better than Kevin Durant in 2014?
I think that even if he’s not a FMVP that a championship would guarantee it. Similar to Chris Bosh. Also Cedric Maxwell and Andre Iguodala are FMVPs that probably aren’t going in the hof
Andre Iguodala did the same thing a few years ago and the team couldn't do anything to stop it. If a player doesn't want to show up the team can cut/trade them or eat the cap space &amp; roster spot. I guess they could send him down to the G league if they wanted to open the roster spot though.
"Andre Iguodala, who is first vice president of the NBPA, was asked on media day whether he saw the nbpa requiring the shot, to which he replied ""I don't think you can force it upon guys. You can give people options and I think that's what we try to do at the union and it's our duty to try to try to protect our players physically, mentally, emotionally, and psychologically.""  Sounds like he is more concerned about the mental health issues resulting from forcing someone to take the vaccine against their conscience than he is about the possibility of unvaccinated players spreading covid to vaccinated players."
"Which FMVP's have gotten a triple double:  Jerry West: yes Willis Reed: no Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: yes Wilt Chamberlain: yes John Havlicek: yes Rick Barry: yes Jo Jo White: no Bill Walton: yes Wes Unseld: yes Dennis Johnson: no Magic Johnson: yes Cedric Maxwell: yes Moses Malone: no Larry Bird: yes James Worthy: no Joe Dumars: no Isiah Thomas: yes Michael Jordan: yes Hakeem Olajuwon: yes Tim Duncan: yes Shaquille O'Neal: yes Chauncey Billups: yes Dwyane Wade: yes Tony Parker: yes Paul Pierce: yes Kobe Bryant: yes Dirk Nowitzki: yes LeBron James: yes Andre Iguodala: yes Kevin Durant: yes Kawhi Leonard: yes Giannis Antetokounmpo: yes  1) why did I do this 2) by my calculations, 33 different players have won FMVP 3) 6 of them have not recorded a triple double (18% of FMVPs)"
Can someone send me the picture of Adam silver blocking Covid the same way LeBron James blocked Andre Iguodala? It was posted a few days ago and I accidentally deleted it

Why is that a bad thing?   https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/12/1/5162790/andre-iguodala-mole-nuggets-warriors-george-karl-playoffs  George Karl is a racist old man and he didn’t think he could outcoach mark fuckin jackson so his game plan was to injure steph. Iguodala said fuck that and mr Karl got upset.   If another teams coach told was telling their players to injure Tatum and someone told Tatum that, you’d hate the player that told him??"
FMVP &gt; All-NBA 1st &gt; DPOY but all need context in a league where Andre Iguodala can win FMVP and DeAndre Jordan can win All-NBA 1st team
Thank you Andre Iguodala for being a decent human being.
His stats were basically all better that series than the regular season.  Supposedly he told the Warriors that Karl wanted the Nuggets to be extremely (dirtily) physical with Steph and he didn't agree with it.  https://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2013/12/1/5162790/andre-iguodala-mole-nuggets-warriors-george-karl-playoffs

"Andre ""Cramer"" Iguodala lmfao...."
Andre Iguodala. I thought that he would be the next superstar in Philadelphia after Iverson. He had all the physical tools but was always a little disappointing and inefficient on offense. Great defender and dunker though.
"Fans overrate scoring. Simple as that.  Players who specialize in other areas (i.e. Draymond, B Wallace, Rodman) will never be *fully* appreciated because so much analysis is reductive to the point of ""Who scores the most points?""   You see the same thing in soccer. Ask about the best players of the past decade. People will invariably name goal scorers like Messi, Ronaldo, Ibrahimovic, etc. It is very easy to understand the person whose job is to finish the chain. What's harder to value correctly is the people who toil in the support structure, like a defensive midfielder, center back, or goalie.  In basketball there are players like Ron Artest, Jae Crowder, Andre Iguodala, Tristan Thompson, Jrue Holiday (until this year), Andrew Bogut, and Tyson Chandler who just sort of fly under the radar because the things they excel at aren't the things that most impress the general public (i.e. shot making).   But to actually win basketball games, you need rebounding, passing, defense, etc. That's why you see Scottie Barnes as a top 5 pick in the draft, and the Bucks selling the farm for Jrue, who is not regarded as a great pure scorer. Teams have more of an understanding that winning isn't just about having a bunch of guys who can drop 20 every night."
"The best part of getting KD, other than the whole winning titles thing, was that we didn't have to play against him. I swear he killed us more than any other team. Only way we ever beat OKC in the regular season those years were from crazy buzzer beaters from Andre Iguodala and Curry, and it took Kd fouling out in the 2016 game. I think we beat them one other time where KD had 30 pts at the half and then hurt his foot"
"Yes - Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Jokic, Kyrie   Yes, but he shouldn’t - Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin  No - Paul George, Kevin Love, Rudy Gobert, Andre Iguodala  Absolutely not - Kemba Walker"
Lowry - No  Lillard - Yes  Carmelo - Yes  Derrick Rose - No  Paul George - Probably   Kyrie - Yes  Kevin Love - No  Rudy Gobert - Maybe  Andre Iguodala - No
Mmm false:  https://www.nba.com/warriors/news/otto-porter-jr-20210806  https://www.nba.com/amp/warriors/news/nemanja-bjelica-20210806  https://www.nba.com/news/andre-iguodala-returns-to-warriors-on-1-year-deal?amp=1
"Andre Iguodala  - signed, some Warriors slappy"
"He was drafted second overall. The scouts who liked him thought he could be Andre Iguodala. Instead, what they got was an above average defender who lacked a place in a half court offense.  Also, he never had a season in the NBA where he achieved in the low bar of 12-7-2."
I was curious about who was next.  Derek Fisher with 259.  Next most amongst active players is Andre Iguodala with 170.  Full list: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_National\_Basketball\_Association\_career\_playoff\_games\_played\_leaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_National_Basketball_Association_career_playoff_games_played_leaders)  Slight asterisk since the opening round used to be best of 5 instead of 7.
"Andre Iguodala legitimately deserved the 2015 Finals MVP, over both Steph and LeBron."
"Andre Iguodala says Mark Jackson is being blackballed b/c of his views on homosexuality. Which makes sense b/c Rick Welts (president of GSW) is openly gay. If true, Mark can’t fault anyone.  When one of the team executives is openly gay and the coach is open about not necessarily being in support of homosexuality there's going to be problems. When an assistant coach is allegedly caught for secretly recording coaches meetings and supposedly turned those recordings over to ownership there's going to be problems. And Mark Jackson clearly thought those problems might be affecting the team. In the middle of a huddle in the fourth quarter of a Game 7 he asked his players: ""You think you all are playing for me?"" No, he reminded them, you are playing for yourselves.  It was certainly the leading factor. Overstatement to say it was the entire reason but certainly was the main reason."
"Wes unseld should not have been finals mvp, Elvin Hayes should have been that year    I understand people would look at a finals featuring Tim Duncan and LeBron James and raised a few question marks about Tony Parker being the finals MVP, but he was great that series, say what you want about the competition but that Cavaliers defense was legit and Duncan was terrible from an efficiency standpoint so I think they gave it to the right guy     So I do think Wes unseld probably has the worst finals.mvp on this list perhaps, but as far as overall players yes Andre Iguodala and Cornbread Maxwell are the two worst , you can flip a coin honestly"
"16 of 53 FMVP (30.2%) award winners were not regular season MVPs at any point.      2019 Kawhi Leonard   2015 Andre Iguodala   2014 Kawhi Leonard   2008 Paul Pierce   2007 Tony Parker   2006 Dwyane Wade   2004 Chauncey Billups   1990 Isiah Thomas   1989 Joe Dumars   1988 James Worthy   1981 Cedric Maxwell   1979 Dennis Johnson   1976 Jo Jo White   1975 Rick Barry   1974 John Havlicek   1969 Jerry West      Looking at it as ""how many unique names""; there were 32 different FMVP winning players and 15 of them never won reg. season MVP."
And that's why Andre Iguodala is better than Steph Curry!
"Cavs fan homer scenario: summer of 2004, Andre Iguodala falls to the Cavs at pick 10 instead of going to Philly at 9. Shortly after, Cavs re-sign Carlos Boozer to a long-term deal. Cavs have a core of LeBron (19), Iggy (20), Boozer (22), and Ilgauskas (29) going into the 2004-05 season."
"Your lineup made me think of something:  Andre Miller, Andre Roberson, Andre Iguodala, [Andre Brown](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/brownan01.html), Andre Drummond.  All current day. Feel like there's a chance to get it."
"There's nuance to it, though, it's not a straight like-for-like comparison. Nobody says Andre Iguodala is as good as Chris Paul, or that they were 100% equally as important to their respective teams.  The Warriors had a chance to essentially put the series to bed with Game 4 at home, but Iguodala was suddenly out and his 27 minutes largely went to Looney and Jordan Bell. And the Warriors blew a 12-point lead in the fourth quarter of G4 that drastically changed the series (2-2 as opposed to 3-1).  Iguodala was a net ratings god for that team; losing his minutes and having many go to Jordan Bell was hugely impactful considering G4 and G5 were nailbiters that they lost. There is a very good chance the Warriors win in 5, or at least come home for G6 up (rather than down) 3-2, if Iguodala wasn't out after three games."
"Who is the vocal locker room leader in that team who would speak up and ask Draymond to apologize  and KD to peace out.  I mean, Draymond is that guy normally.  I don't think Steph and Klay have that personality (not to mention that Steph wasn't even suited up)   Maybe Andre Iguodala or Bogut ?  I can't see Cousins, Cook, Looney or most of the guys on that [roster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_NBA_Finals#Player_statistics) taking the lead and confronting Dray &amp; KD and takin"
"&gt;	But you didn’t right? So your 70 game regular season was meaningless.  Ok, so by your logic, for 8 teams in the league the regular season was pointless because it all came down to the play-ins, which inherently means that for the other 22 teams in the league who either won enough “meaningless” games to avoid it or didn’t win enough “meaningless” games to qualify for it, they weren’t meaningless at all.    &gt;Like giannis has more mvps than Durant (and even a fmvp now). Do you think giannis is better because regular season mvps are worth more?  No, I think Durant is better because he has 6 more all-star appearances, 3 more all-NBA selections, 4 more scoring titles, and numerous other accolades over Giannis in addition to the FMVP.    Or do you think that Oscar Robertson, Charles Barkley, and David Robinson are lower all-time than Andre Iguodala?"
"Both the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 Warriors had 6  Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Demarcus Cousins/David West"
"20 years later same question , when everyone still remembers Curry and how he changed basketball :  3 time champion and Finals MVP on Warriors dynasty?  Andre Iguodala"
Wear it with your Andre Iguodala Grizz jersey
"Please see Andre Iguodala as an example of why you're wrong.  Iggy did a lot of what Smart did, and he's been in the league for ever.  Pat Bev is 33. Avery Bradley is 30, Rondo is 35.  All these guys threw their bodies around and still do, and are still playing.   PJ Tucker is 36. I mean if i really wanted to im sure I could keep naming more, like Tony Allen played till 36."
"Doctor J is an all-time freak. Jordan/Kawhi type of hand size.  David Robinson, Bill Russell also come to mind. Andre Iguodala for high level role players."
Got taken to 7 by the 8 seed Sixers led by Andre Iguodala lmfao
Set aside the team context for a moment and look only at the history between one player (LeBron James) and another player (Andre Iguodala).
"&gt;Curry, who literally transforms a team of bums into 40% 3PT shooters because of his gravity.  You might should double-check that claim.  Curry has played with, last time I counted, 16 different Warrior teammates who shot over 40% from the arc while playing **for other teams.**  That does not include Klay Thompson or Draymond Green, obviously, as they are Warrior lifers to date.  It also doesn't count Andre Iguodala who has not shot 40% yet, and whose best shooting season by a mile was with Philadelphia.  So who, exactly, are these ""bums"" you are referring to?"

"Hahahah jesus christ did I get one of those ___ISGOAT twitter accounts here? I don't even know where to start.    &gt; his whole team was often hurt)  Yeah damn must be tough dealing with injuries  &gt; Was down 0-2 to the Clippers until CP3 &amp; Blake Griffin got hurt, then he basically won by default.  Literally just untrue(shocker).  Won game 3 with both CP3 and Blake, then CP3 went down in the 2nd half of the next game.  Btw we were starting Mason Plumlee, Al Faroq Aminu, and Mo Harkless   &gt; Then lost to the Warriors in 5 in the 2nd round, and never beat Curry in a game where Curry played (Dame was 1-2 vs the Dubs without Curry even playing)2017 - Swept in 1st round to Warriors. Still hasn't even beaten Curry in a game.  Yes god forbid he didn't do better starting Meyers Leonard, Mo Harkless, and AL farouq Aminu vs Steph Curry Klay Thompson Draymodn Green and Andre Iguodala   &gt; Swept in 1st round by.... AD &amp; the Pelicans. As a 3rd seed vs a 6 seed. When the Pels were missing their 2nd best player.  Got destroyed by Jrue/AD traps, this was the bad one.   &gt; Won in 1st round vs OKC, even though Westbrook &amp; PG aren't very good playoff performers it still was impressive. Credit to him.  Beat Paul George and Russell Westbrook with a center rotation of Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard and dropped 50 points and a game winner to send them home.   &gt; In 2nd round he barely squeaked by the baby Nuggets with CJ outplaying him half the time.  It's really pathetic how you try to characterize everything lmao.  Dame put up 25-6 and CJ put up 26-3 on the same efficienccy.  One of those guys gets doubled and draws the best defender.  And nice of you to ignore we were starting ENES KANTER vs Nikola Jokic.    &gt; Then got swept in the WCF vs the Warriors with no KD, blowing leads in every single one of them. Still hasn't beat Curry h2h in a single game btw, I'm noting this because it's crazy to me after realizing it.  ""With no KD"".  Yeah only left Curry, Klay, and Draymond vs Dame, CJ, and Meyers Leonard.  Fair battle! [Shocker chose to ignore he separated a rib in game 2](https://youtu.be/Nr4sFo16bNk?t=22)  &gt; Went off in the bubble that allowed his team to get healthy in the playoffs when they otherwise wouldn't  Yeah god forbid he carried a team starting Carmelo Anthony and Hassan Whiteside to the playoffs in the west lmao.  Stick Anthony Davis on that team and they win 20 games.    &gt;  Lost in 6 to the Nuggets missing their 2nd best player &amp; all their defensive guards.  ""All their defensive guards""? They were missing PJ dozier.  Unless you think Jamal Murray plays defense.  And Nuggets fans kept talking about how Facu would lock him up.  **Instead Lillard puts up 34 and 10 on 67% TS and 2 turnovers a game.  Read that again.  He outscored the MVP on better efficiency while doubling his assets and with less turnovers.**  All your list does is show how consistently Dame carries AWFUl teams to playoffs in the west, then plays significantly more talented competition"
With a garbage bench featuring dead weight Andre Iguodala
this is a dumb post. MKG looked like prime Andre Iguodala in his first preseason at age 18 and we all know how that turned out

Andre Iguodala won an mvp for slowing Lebron down did we all forget this?
"No it’s guys on championship teams who played important roles no one hears about. PJ Tucker, Serge Ibaka, Andre Iguodala level guys."
The 2019 warriors were 1 Andre Iguodala 3 away from being swept and it was one of the most detrimental outcomes for the league. If the warriors lost that game they would likely have been swept and KD would never have returned and torn his achilles. Klay was also injured in game 6. I think about the possible implications of this all the time.
"That was by design, they made their rosters entirely of defensive specialists while letting the offense all on AI's hands, it wasn't a coincidence that they always had one of the best defenses in the league, their rosters were built with Larry Brown's way of thinking basketball.  The 2001 Sixers had a starting lineup of AI, Eric Snow, Aaron Mckie, Mutombo and Tyrone Hill. AI led the starters in 3-PT% at 32% and none of these guys averaged more than 11 ppg, but they were all really good defensive players that would play their asses off every night. That situation helped AI focus only on offense, but he had no spacing to work with and had to create everything on his own, making it almost impossible for anyone to be efficient.  The moment Iverson got any talent on the offensive end (2006 Sixers and Denver) his efficiency and assists number went up. It's much easier to be efficient with Kyle Korver, Chris Webber and Andre Iguodala on your squad, proven by AI's 33/3/7 on 54% TS (above league average), but the Sixers were 25th on defense and missed the playoffs."
"well, they signed 3 other forwards on mins (otto porter jr, nemanja bjelica, andre iguodala) and are already out of roster spots...."
"Pj tucker, andre iguodala, and carmelo"
Apparently JR is a beast at golf according to JJ Reddick and Andre Iguodala on JJ’s podcast
"I actually don't understand how this hurts his trade value. Could you please explain for me? He didn't come out and say he wasn't going to play unless he's traded to XYZ team right?   And, even then, Andre Iguodala brought value back to the Grizzlies despite never even showing up in Memphis."
"Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Andre Iguodala, Kyle Lowry, Rajon Rondo, Damian Lillard  Edit: Marc and Pau Gasol"
"Kareem played against Rod Strickland, who also played against Andre Iguodala, who plays today. Six degrees of forever basketball."
Remember the GSW infatuation with Silicon Valley? The players have always been this clueless.  https://www.fastcompany.com/3064934/how-golden-state-warrior-andre-iguodala-became-the-nbas-ambassador-to-silicon-valley
"Draymonds offense has gotten significantly worse since 2016, even though his defense might be just as good.  BUT even if it is as good I personally think it is less valuable than it was back then since the league has gone far more perimeter oriented.   Klay Thompson is a huge question mark this year since he is coming off 2 consecutive missed seasons with huge injuries.   Andre Iguodala was a huge reason the Warriors were so good, but he has looked pretty old for a while now.   Andrew bogut was tremendous for the warriors and Festus Ezeli provided them with really really good minutes as a backup.  Looney is good, but not as good as Bogut was and Wiseman may not even make a positive impact this year.   Shaun Livingston was a very important piece off the bench that provided, scoring, defense and playmaking when Steph was out.  Jordan Poole proved last year to be a very effective scorer, but maybe still questionable as play maker and very very questionable on defense.   Steph is still Steph though so that is good.   The warriors could very well be contenders this year, but it depends on the health of Klay Thompson and whether or not their rookies (I am including Wiseman here) can contribute.  2016 had good depth without relying on any rookies."
"You're comparing a below average shooter to a guy who doesn't shoot at all, that's an easy choice. Especially when it's Andre ""when fate of the universe on the line"" Iguodala who has proven time and time again to hit necessary shots and free throws during crunch time vs a guy who refused to dunk because Trae Young was in the area."

Andre Iguodala in Memphis vibes.
Not even just for the era. For the fit and for the fact Kobe had arguably his best season in 03 and both Shaq and Kobe played well.  The LeBron Dirk faced looked more like Andre Iguodala if he was bad at defense than LeBron James.
"This is what I think many people miss, but Durant takes it a step further. You can *never* expect to lock down superstars.  Andre Iguodala isn’t locking up LeBron James, Fred VanVleet isn’t locking up Steph Curry, Lu Dort isn’t locking up James Harden, PJ Tucker isn’t locking up Kevin Durant. A lot of people like to think these guys can lock up some of the game’s greatest scorers, but that’s not true. What often happens is that one might think those superstars had off/quiet nights but you check the box score and they had a quiet 30. They’re superstars for a reason."
Pippen was a glorified Andre Iguodala who was carried to 6 rings. Replace him with any other all star and the Bulls still win 6 titles.   KD has been the best player in the league for several years. People just didn't want to admit it because of their irrational hatred towards him.
"Funny to say this considering the current situation, but the Iguodala trade to Memphis to get DLo.   To preface, I’m a really big Andre Iguodala fan and a really big Golden State fan (still am too) I love the way they played and the chemistry that they had.     Andre Iguodala became my favorite player ‘cause I said to myself that since everyone liked Steph, I should like someone else.  Also, my favorite highlights of all time had him (the 2014 game-winner against the Thunder and filthy crossover against Denver).   So you could imagine the shock when they traded him for basically a bag of chips and salary to Memphis for the DLo trade.  Mind you, the sting of losing KD (to the Nets and the Achilles), Klay, and the 2019 Finals was still really fresh.    That’s why It made me really sad knowing that during the Warriors lost one of the best sixth man in franchise history.   I just didn’t think it was worth it.   So yeah, losing Iguodala was really sad for me at the time.   But looking back now, I’m happy that he’s back witth the team and really excited for what’s to come!"
"I felt curious enough to try to find out who else has come close to this, for no particular reason. These 3 all came close to an NCAA championship but not quite, Kevin Love (final 4) Andre Iguodala (elite 8) and Steve Smith (sweet sixteen), but had the rest."

"&gt;Disaster of a trade? We gave up expiring contracts in Solomon Hill, Andre Iguodala, and Jae Crowder.   Yes, it was a disaster. You gave up solid players on expiring contracts just to take back a shit ton of bad salaries which were not expiring and which weren't positive contributors for you. You got two large multi year contracts that you ended up just buying out (Waiters and Dieng), and Winslow, who was a bust.   If you had not made that trade and those guys had all left it would have opened up $38 million in cap space that summer. Instead, you essentially traded those expiring contracts so you could devote  $84 million total over two years basically just for Winslow. How is that *not* a disaster?   And let's be honest: the only reason Memphis did this is because they were too proud to just buy Iguodala out, even though they'd already received a 1st round pick to take him on. They had made a big stink in the press about how they believed they could get something positive for him again in another trade, and when that never happened, rather than admit they'd been wrong, instead they made a bad trade and tried to proclaim that they'd been right. They should have just bought Iguodala out and been done with it. Wasting $15 million is far better than wasting $84 million."
I'll take Andre Iguodala!
"Disaster of a trade? We gave up expiring contracts in Solomon Hill, Andre Iguodala, and Jae Crowder. None of which were re-signing with us anyways. We took on a bit of cap hits, but it was a low-risk/high-reward trade for us.   The Grizzlies needed an athletic wing who can create his own shot. We were hoping that Winslow was that guy. He wasn't.  It was a risk worth taking, especially considering we didn't give up any assets that actually match with Ja and JJJ's timelines."

**AT&amp;T Presents: Andre Iguodala - A Decision**
This was an AT&amp;T 5G commercial interspersed with the occasional Andre Iguodala fact.
Ain’t no way Andre “3ppg” Iguodala warrants a whole video from Shams
"I’m obviously biased, but I really do think it’s Bam. Outside of Jimmy last year (and Oladipo in the handful of games he actually saw the court for us), our best defenders were like Andre Iguodala and Trevor Ariza, and the year before it was probably Iggy and Crowder. Bam’s ability to switch and guard 1-5 did a lot to help cover up our guards’ defensive ineptitude, even though he was expending a lot of energy on the offensive end as well. Ben has Bam on height, but Bam has the longer wingspan and about 15 more pounds packed on, so the physical attributes pretty much cancel out, if not give the edge to Bam. Simmons is a great defender, and they’re definitely both in the same tier, but I’m taking Bam."
"Think of him in the Iguodala role. Passing, defense, playing point for the second team. Though Andre did have to shoot some."
Andre Iguodala has size 17 feet and weighs 215 = .079
"These are Scottie's totals during both Bulls threepeats.  Year | Games | Points | TRB | Assists ---|---|----|----|---- 91-92 | 5 | 104 | 47 | 33 92-93 | 6 | 125 | 50 | 46 93-94 | 6 | 127 | 55 | 46 96-97 | 6 | 94 | 49 | 32 97-98 | 6 | 120 | 50 | 21 98-99 | 6 | 94 | 51 | 29  Average:  19(18.97)/8.3/5.9  And yeah, Jimmy went 26.2/8.3/9.8 in his lone final appearance...as the number 1 option...in 2020 as opposed to the 90s, but sample size is everything. Having one incredible finals series does not equate to being a better player. Shit, Andre Iguodala has more Finals MVPs than Scottie, does that make them equatable?   But let's look at their playoff averages:  Jimmy: 80 Games. 18.4/5.8/4.3  Scottie: 208 Games, 17.5/7.6/5.0  And, again, Jimmy was the number 1 option in most of those playoff games. Scottie was 2nd to the fucking GOAT, yet he's still putting up just less than 1 PPG, 2 TRB, and 1 AST. Over 128 more games.   So, if you wanna talk about the postseason, and a #1 option in the 2010s is putting up pretty much the same stats as the #2 to the GOAT in the 90s....yeah it's still not even close for me."

"Basically the Heat swapped Dragic for Lowry and swapped Andre Iguodala for PJ Tucker. Does it make them better? Yeah  Does it make them WAY better?

I wish I was a little bit taller I wish I was a balla if I was Bob Myers I'd sign Andre iguodala

"LeBron, Dwight, Marc Gasol, Carmelo and Russ were all in the 2012 All Star game, as was Luol Deng who is also still technically on their roster. Recent Laker Rajon Rondo was also in that game, as were buyout candidate Kevin Love and current Lakers target Andre Iguodala. AD made the 2014 game:  Westbrook, James, Anthony, Davis, Howard.   Rondo, Iguodala, Deng, Love, Gasol.   TL;DR: Finalise Melo and Iguodala, bring Rondo back, wait for a Love buyout and get the decrepit corpse of Luol Deng back on the court, boys. We're winding back the clock."

Not interested in signing Andre Iguodala for an Andre Inguodala-type role?
"Joe Ingles playing an Andre Iguodala-type role on this Warriors team is something I'm interested in.   If we get Ingles here, im happy with this trade."
JTA is like 28 lol. He's already at the stage of his career that Andre Iguodala was at when he joined us. Best case scenario is he basically fills the Andre Iguodala ultimate glue guy role
"Two different sides of the same coin. Because defensive ability, basketball IQ and other intangibles just doesn't seem as impressive to an average fan. Arguably the point of the game is to get the ball in the hoop and Kyrie can do that at will with finesse. Kyrie was a 1st overall pick with everything you're talking about. A shot, handles, ability to finish at the basket.  Draymond had to work his way into the starting lineup in a Warriors team that was just starting to have a new identity. It took a David Lee injury and Andre Iguodala benching for them to realize his impact on winning basketball. Definitely talented in his own right but he's also overshadowed by two prolific shooters. One happens to have changed the way defenses have to guard because someone can make a basket from literally anywhere."
Toronto should have drafted Andre Iguodala
Andre iguodala-DNP (old)
Steph Curry  Klay Thompson  Andre Iguodala   Kevin Durant   Draymond Green  It’s pretty obvious why they targeted Steph.
"&gt; I legitimately don’t know where the narrative of him being a bad defender came from.  He used to get targeted on switches by other teams.  Notably, when the rest of the defensive lineup was Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, and Kevin Durant.  The ""no shit Steph is the weak link"" lineup. Did you know he's also a worse rim protector than Rudy Gobert?"
"Yup, Andre Iguodala carried the Warriors offence.   I'll say that only because you don't seem to watch the Warriors. Steph could average 0 points for 82 games and he would still be the best player of his team. He made the opponent give the best scorer in the world (KD) an open lane to the rim. What does that say?"
"Oh yeah, he certainly has declined. However, his last two stops have ranged from underwhelming to nonexistent, while he really benefits from fitting into the Warriors' system at this point in his career.  [Before the season](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-player-projections/andre-iguodala/), the model predicted he'd be absolutely terrible. Since he's still at least a smart player and not a complete negative on defense (his +/- has been crazy thus far), the model seems to have re-corrected him to be an okay player again, instead of the trash they thought he would be."
"yeah bums like Demarcus Cousins, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, and Shaun Livingston"
"The Brittney Griner/Demarcus Cousins moment, the Andre Iguodala beef that shouldn't have been a big deal, and just some basic arguments consistently made about comparisons to the NBA and pay."
We are still grateful for Andre Iguodala.
Andre Iguodala - The Sixth Man
"You mean save the world from aliens, Andre Iguodala?"
Andre Iguodala/Lebron archetype = doesn’t exist  Drivel.
did u watch that series in 1874? idk the context to that all i know is andre iguodala received the most undeserving FMVP of all time
"Kawhi had 6-22 and 4-17 games, and was overall less efficient while averaging 5 points less, and doing so against Jerami Grant and will Barton while kd was playing Andre iguodala and Draymond green"
"I don't really think that's true. The Warriors have signed multiple FA All Stars in the last decade in David Lee, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant, Demarcus Cousins, David West, etc.   Yes Curry has played a big part, but you're *severely* underrating organizational culture. GS wasn't an GA destination pre-Curry because Cohan was a god awful owner. Joe Lacob is legitimately one of the best in the league, and players trust that the organization will put together a winning roster. That matters to players."
"Iguodala? Granted Andre eventually realized that nobody's paying him more than the vet-min, so he came back."
I think that the ceiling for Scottie Barnes is somewhere slightly north of Andre Iguodala. The floor is what he is now. We've seen enough to know.
"&gt; Like yeah, opposing teams used to target him on defense, but the list of players who wouldn't be the weak link when the rest of the lineup is Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala is what you might call limited.  I mean, obviously you don't watch games, but you could at least read what you're replying to."
"Steph Curry's defense is severely underrated.  Like yeah, opposing teams used to target him on defense, but the list of players who *wouldn't* be the weak link when the rest of the lineup is Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala is what you might call *limited*."
"Saw someone else mention this first, so the credit is theirs, but Scottie Barnes does remind me of a taller and remixed version of Andre Iguodala. Taller, with similar vision and pass first instincts, not as explosive of an athlete, but much longer on defense.  Maybe a mix of Iguodala, Draymond Green, and Shawn Marion, with emphasized poise and passing ability? I am very bullish on Scottie Barnes with a solid organization developing him. Can see him as an impactful championship team player."
"Bogut injured, Andre Iguodala injured, Draymond suspension, Steph hobbled also played a factor.  Oh and LeBron playing like one of the 🐐 during that series.  I feel like that series was the exception.  So can’t say the warriors are doomed just because they are starting this season with a ton of wins.  Idk how you can turn that around lol"
You’re saying Lebron James today is offensively equal to Andre iguodala?
"So... and hear me out with this...  ""Stephen Curry averaged 26.0 points, 6.3 assists and 5.2 rebounds in 6 games in the 2015 NBA Finals.""  ""Andre Iguodala averaged 16.3 points, 5.8 assists and 4.0 rebounds in 6 games in the 2015 NBA Finals.""  Other than the adjustment made by the coaching staff in Game 4 (similar to what they did in the Memphis series) and the obvious impact of the move (Iguodala inserted into the starting lineup and shifting Bogut out; lessening LeBron's efficiency but not necessarily the scoring output) I still really can't argue for Iguodala being Finals MVP over Curry tbh. The award should always go to the best player on the winning team and statistics bear out that Curry was the better player by almost every metric other than defense.  &amp;#x200B;  Source: [2015 NBA Finals Statistics](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2015-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html)"
"Stevie Kerr to Andre Iguodala: ""I like the way you retire, boy."""
"Injury list: Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, Andre  Iguodala, Otto Porter Jr, Klay, Wiseman.  That's why.  It's good to get him reps right now."
Out for Golden State  * Steph Curry  * Draymond Green  * Andre Iguodala  * Klay Thompson  * Otto Porter  * James Wiseman
Andre Iguodala  now it's your turn to answer my question
"...With the way coaching is going it's gotta be someone whom stars respect. As insane as this is, my guess for good coaches would be...  Rajon Rondo, Steph Curry, Seth Curry, Jrue Holiday, Andre Iguodala, Udonis Haslem, Spencer Dinwiddie, Fred Van Vleet, Lonzo Ball."
I feel like Andre Iguodala will make a great coach
"Because you have Steph Curry? Because you don't need a ball-dominant point guard when you run a motion offense and *have Steph Curry*? Because you haven't had a decent true C since Andrew Bogut left?  We don't need Wiseman to be prime Hakeem out there. If he can be *Zaza Pachulia* only without *injuring so many of his teammates* that's enough.  Meanwhile a guy with his physical tools getting mentored by Draymond Green, Kevon ""would be a star if his body didn't betray him"" Looney and Andre Iguodala, now getting coached by the guy who taught Jokic how to play basketball, could be a future franchise centrepiece."
So Andre Iguodala?
"Go back to Cleveland, trade all the young talent and picks for vets that get it like Jaymichael Green, Iguodala, Andre Drummond, jj reddick, Rajon Rondo, and the prize free agent/trade piece Derozan.          Edit: Fire the head ball coach and get Byron Scott as HC."
"Heat - Lebron James, Andre Iguodala, Goran Dragic, Hassan Whiteside, Avery Bradley  Rockets are OP but I wanted to make one for Miami"
Whos the better #1 Option: Andre Iguodala or Joel Embiid
You can run that play on Andre Iguodala or someone who has signed a couple big deals in their career. Caruso was near the vets minimum for two years. Go get paid.
That bench was hot garbage outside of Andre Iguodala. I don't think anyone from that bench is even still in the league.
"Nurse didn’t bust out the Box and 1 until it was only Curry on the floor playing with Quinn Cook, Alfonzo McKinnie, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green  That type of defense is for high school basketball to shut down one specific player on the other team. There is an opening for everyone else if they’re capable enough"
I was trying to say he can be an athletic point forward like Lebron James and Andre Iguodala. Those were the 2 most athletic small forwards of the 2010s. Rudy Gay would be next after that.
"Don’t talk like Andre Iguodala wasn’t hurt either. People bring up CP3 all the time (who’s playoff injuries were like clockwork up to that point) as if that was the only difference maker, but conveniently forget about Iguodala’s injury and his part in the Death squad.   If Iguodala was healthy, there’s a chance the series would have been over in 6.  Regardless that was a nasty Rockets team, and deepened my appreciation for players like PJ Tucker."
There’s a drastic difference between an Andre Iguodala type and Lebron type
Andre Iguodala has 16 points in the last five games.  LeBron James? 0.  CHECKMATE ATHEISTS.
2x FMVP Andre Iguodala
Yeah but Andre Iguodala in 2k10 was easily better than all of them
Another thing to look at is the replacements.  If KD is off the floor he's replaced by Andre Iguodala who was a starting caliber sixth man.  When Steph is off he's replaced by Livingston who while talented isn't a floor spacer and he works best in the post offensively.  Also Steph and Dryamond had their minutes always matched together.  So those numbers even have asterisks next to them.
"Not only is he completely ignoring fit as a team, but his player to player comparison is blatantly incorrect lmao. ""Could go either way"" between him and Durant? Past-his-prime Rodman over prime Draymond? Ignoring Andre ""2015 Finals MVP"" Iguodala off the bench? Acting as if Longley vs McGee is a meaningful comparison?"
"So when they teach you to shoot, the rule of thumb is that your upper-body mechanics should be *exactly* the same. Your range comes from your legs. In fact, when you're watching players who can hit 18-footers but can't hit 23-footers, you can see them start to really muscle it with their arms, which kills your accuracy. (This is really obvious if you watch players at lower levels. You can tell from the form which guys should be taking threes and which shouldn't).   Your accuracy comes from your arms, your distance from your legs.   Now, for a lot of players, getting your legs into it slows you down. You can see this with, way, Andre Iguodala. To get his body into it, he ends up bringing the ball down fairly low, but that means that his release is slow and he can't really hit them unless he's wide open (martian death-rays aside). You see this with a lot of 3-D guys. They're fine if they're wide open, but can't get the shot off under pressure. What makes someone like Klay special is that he can get the shot off so quickly that it almost doesn't matter if he's open or not. What makes Harden's step-back great is the way he transfers his energy backwards and then forwards into the shot: try it, even without dribbling, and you'll see that it's difficult to keep your balance and get any distance on the shot at all. Most people end up pausing, but that gives the defender a chance to close and defeats the point of the step-back.   But I digress.   Generally, good 3-point shooters are fine from 18 feet, IF they have the time to get the shot off, because the defender is closer when you're only at 18 feet. The closer defender somewhat balances out the shorter distance, although if you look at most good 3-point shooters (basketball-reference has shot percentages for players) they do shoot slightly better from the midrange than from deep - it's just not worth the extra point. 39% on a 3 is worth more than 43% on a long two.  Lastly: players practice the shots they expect to take. Most role players have probably spent a lot more time shooting the corner three than they have an 18-footer from the wing. Because 3-and-D guys tend to get the ball in similar spots every time, they can really practice that particular shot, which helps you get the range right."

Andre ‘Honest Abe’ Iguodala 2/2 on challenges

Andre Iguodala is a big brain basketball genius
"Unbelievable layup issues.  He been playing a lot like andre iguodala out there which is a comp I'd never thought I'd ever fucking consider.  Moves brilliantly off-ball, not a primary ball handler but enough to make plays and push in transition. Holds up from 3. Excellent secondary passer, moves into space well, and has played EXCELLENT defense through 10 games.  It's odd because so much of it is so different than his prospect profile. Lots to work on, and the layup stuff is legit concerning, but a nice early season suprise"
"They had a lot of talented guys, though without that Rose injury, I don’t think they would have beaten the Bulls in the 2011-2012 season.  But that roster, Lou Williams, Andre Iguodala, Jrue Holiday, Thad Young, even Elton Brand was playing a solid vet role for that team. They had just drafted Vucevic. And Evan Turner was showing some signs of being a solid guy.  I always wonder what could have been if they didn’t trade for Andrew Bynum. Another year or two and all those guys may have made a serious run in the East."

"At least the Clippers didn't sacrifice much to get him. If you want a laugh, go look at everything the Grizzlies paid and gave up for him: they traded away Jae Crowder and Andre Iguodala for him while also taking on the bloated contracts of Dion Waiters (immediately buying out his remaining $25 million) and Gorgui Dieng (whom they bought out last year), all to give Winslow a look. Winslow only wound up playing 26 games for Memphis. That's one of the least talked about disastrous trades of recent memory."
Andre Iguodala has nearly 39000 minutes played in the NBA and a lot of that was as one of the top options for the 76ers. Rodman has nearly 29000 minutes but spent most of his career as a defensive specialist who didn’t have much of an offensive role.
"When it was rumored that Jason Collins, the first openly gay active NBA player, might be signing with the Warriors, Mark Jackson told the media, “not in my locker room.”  Andre Iguodala has also claimed that Mark Jackson was fired because he was homophobic and Rick Welts, the president of the GS Warriors, is openly gay.  There’s other stuff too, but those were the really public ones"
"&gt;I’ve accumulated [Jeff] Bezos-type of money  [Wojnarowski] ""The Golden State Warriors has extended Andre Iguodala on a 99-year, $193 billion dollar contract. The final 98 years and $192.99 billion are non-guaranteed."""
Does Andre Iguodala believe he may have 190 billion dollars in 10-15 years?
"- Tyler Herro (currently averaging 22.4/6/4.4, leading bench scorer in the NBA)  - Duncan Robinson (extended, enables extensive spacing for two stars who can't shoot even if he's in a slump)  - Precious Achiuwa (used in trade to acquire Kyle Lowry)  - Kendrick Nunn (let go for nothing)  - Salary Filler (would've likely been Goran Dragic &amp; Andre Iguodala, one of which was used in the Lowry trade)  - Two 1st-Round Picks (likely 2022/2024)  - 4 Pick Swaps   this is the king's ransom they asked for Harden."
"Warriors fan here!  I feel great about the Dubs, 5-1 ain't bad. Steph will be fine, I believe he will have a good season ahead of him. I believe he will break Klay's record. I hope Draymond will continue to score like his 2015-2016 self because we need it. Once Klay returns to his old self, I can see that this Warriors team is like the 2014-15 Warriors.  I think turnovers and sloppy plays are ruining our momentum and the game and I think they should limit those mistakes. We should have won the Grizzlies game if it wasn't for our 23 turnovers.  Damion Lee suprised me because he improved and became a key factor on the team. Some fans don't want him on the team and they say that he's here cause of nepotism but I believe DLee deserves to be here. Dude can shoot and contribute (10 pts +). Also, I was suprised by Bjelica, he can contribute right away. Can score, make good plays but not suitable for small ball opponents since we need fast players. I am disappointed in our sloppy plays and the turnovers we are causing.  Like I said, Bjelica is a great addition. Also, OPJ is worth the vet minimum. He is a 40%+ 3pt shooter in his career. Both of them are great fits, hope OPJ will not get injured. And most importantly, it's great they got Andre Iguodala back since he knows our system and can improve the team's chemistry and be a mentor to the young guys.  I agree that Moody and Kuminga will be sent to the G-League for their development. Even though Moody played a few minutes, he can score and pass the ball. I am high on the 2 rookies and I believe they will succeed.  Once Klay and Wiseman are back, I hope we suprise the basketball world soon."
For a moment I read that as Andre Iguodala and it threw me for a loop.
"pj relies heavily on strength/physicality, ball denial, dog mentality, and above average quickness for his size. its not the best matchup in the NBA, it was the best matchup the bucks had.   Best matchup in the nba would be lebron when hes trying on defense, or andre iguodala. andre has the ball denial and the swiping that really bothers KD and the length of his arms."
Players and media always say this. Andre Iguodala said this on first take.

"Lonzo is a secondary ball handler/playmaking wing type then he is a true guard. 6'6"", good length and defensive instincts too. I actually wouldn't mind that lineup seeing a good amount of run.  He's a lot closer to the ideation of Evan Turner/Warriors Andre Iguodala then he is Magic Johnson or Jason Kidd"

"Yeah I enjoyed reading thru this post haha. Damn, you just reminded me of Raefer ‘skip 2 my lou’, he brought and1 into the NBA. Holyyyy that just reminded me of Jason Williams now that dude was fun af to watch! That Kings team as a whole with Divac and Webber were lit.   Iguodala and Andre is actually a good comparison as far as the value they brought to a team. Andre was so fun to watch because he looked like the stadium janitor lol and it almost didn’t make sense how he would blow by defenders at half their speed."
"ANDRE MILLER!  my favorite thing about this post is getting nostalgic hearing some of the names people wrote down.  I havent seen it,  but I wanted some way to fit in Raefer Alston, david west,    One guy said monta Ellis.  There are just so many awesome peripheral players that killed it, but get forgotten about, but they could easily have been the key that turned a franchise into a chip as the 3rd option or 6th man.   Would you say Iguodala and andre fill a similar championship  component?"

"Probably your worst comment yet bro. Andre Iguodala, LeBron James, freaking the entire Brooklyn Nets Big three, the list goes on. Tons of high talent players coast the regular season. You're a clown dawg. Stop talking."
"It is a key question.  Just as an FYI, they don't actually own all their own 1st round picks.  They owe Memphis a pick from the Andre Iguodala cap dump trade.  It is a first round pick in 2024 (protected 1-4)... or if it doesn't convey, 2025 (protected #1), and if it doesn't convey, 2026 unprotected.  But the fact that the pick could theoretically be in 2024, 2025, or 2026 actually significantly hampers the warriors because you are not allowed to not have a 1st round pick 2 years in a row.  And this obligation means they don't know for certain if they will or won't have a pick in 2024, 2025, or 2026 ... so they aren't actually allowed to trade their first round pick from 2023-2027 or some weird sh\_t like that.  I might have the details a bit wrong but this obligation really makes them not be able to easily trade their own future first round picks.  Apparently GSW and MEM were talking a lot about a trade of 7 for 10 + getting this pick back, but it didn't happen."

"Three teams got robbed in the Dwight Howard trade, and the inexplicable winners were the Orlando Magic.  Dwight's (first) time in LA was marred by injury and dysfunction, the superteam the Lakers attempted to form by adding Dwight and Steve Nash to their pre-existing core of Kobe, Gasol and Artest was a spectacular failure.  Andrew Bynum's time in Philadelphia was somehow even worse, his career absolutely cratered coming off an All Star season with the Lakers, which in retrospect hardly seems like it ever actually happened.  The most notable thing Andre Iguodala did in Denver was leave for Golden State.  That leaves the Magic, who traded away Dwight at his peak, mostly mismanaged the assets they received in that deal, but still managed to come out of it with Nic Vucevic, who turned out to be best player in the deal in the years that followed, and was often the only bright spot in Orlando until they traded him to the Bulls last year."
"He is not a better defender than Giannis and he is also not a better defender than Draymond.   If you look at advanced defensive metrics, he's level with Royce O'Neal on DWS and with Andre Iguodala (and below Jimmy Butler) on DBPM. [source](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::dws)  I think he's a better defender than O'Neale and Butler (and Dre, obviously), for what it's worth, and that advanced statistics need to be compared with the eye test. But there's not a credible case to be made for Simmons as the best defender in the league other than media voting (which, btw, put Pat ""trick y'all"" Bev on the All-Defensive Team three times)."

"Vince Carter's career was such a roller-coaster.  At UNC, I thought he was just a jumping jack sidekick to the main attraction, Antawn Jamison. I wasn't even sure he was *that* unique of a dunker until [I saw this on Plays of the Week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVik0xm5q20&amp;ab_channel=RyanVanDusen) his rookie year. I still remember my brain thinking it was obviously watching a reverse layup but instead he kept going up.  He had that meteoric rise that may have peaked around the 2000 Dunk Contest, where his popularity coincided with this do-no-wrong type of stretch where you felt like everything was coming up Carter. [That Clippers lob and game-winner was right in the heart of that stretch](https://youtu.be/Qn1cHJhEaAk?t=158).   Then there was that moment where he got his diploma before Game 7 against Philly in 2001, [*arrived in Philly ready to go five hours in advance*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3y8aon9rCQ&amp;ab_channel=RyanVanDusen), and still got totally roasted for it because a last-second shot in a mutually ugly game rimmed out.   Next the injuries hit, frequently enough and in such succession that the message boards I visited back then almost exclusively referred to him as Wince rather than Vince. As a Carter fan, I found this annoying, but everyone seemed so sure this dude's career was pretty much toast at that point.  That led to the messy Raptors divorce, where Vince Carter dreamed of Julius Erving (front office), Steve Nash (free agent), and a guy like Andre Iguodala (draft) but instead ended up with Rob Babcock, Rafer Alston, and Rafael Araujo. He moped, tanked his value, and permanently killed his rep among many.   He balled out in New Jersey though, except they were never built to compete at that point either. Kidd-Jefferson-Carter was fun, but it wasn't even touching the other big boys in the East at the time (Pistons, Heat) so his greatness was lost out there for a few years.   That all led to the end of his career around 2010, at which point he chose to begin a second NBA MyPlayer, this time as a effective role player. He played that mode until 2020.   Wild ride, all told."
"Spobot is a mixed bag.  At times, we love him and his ability to adjust to situations from game to game.  In other instances, we get very frustrated because he plays Andre Iguodala at the 4 in 2021.  Roster construction played a part in it, but…Dedmon &amp; Bam would’ve been a serviceable frontcourt if they got more reps together.  All in all, we take the good with the bad."
"The Bulls use a territorial pick to add Dwyane Wade, then use another territorial pick to pair him with Andre Iguodala, then use a territorial pick to add Derrick Rose, then draft Jimmy Butler with the 30th pick in the draft, before drafting Anthony Davis with a territorial pick the next season."

"Literally every team would do what the Lakers do if they could. You see Golden State? Perennial lottery team that was the joke of the league that nobody cared about and had no fanbase for decades. (There were definitely diehard Warriors fans, but they were basically on the level of diehard Clippers fans; all through the 90s and 00s, you were much more likely to see Kings or Lakers jerseys out and about in the Bay.) And the second they gained any amount of clout and and hype, they bought big name FAs like Andre Iguodala and Kevin Durant, along with an endless parade of title chasing vets. If the Kings or the Mavs or the Rockets could do what the Lakers could do, they'd do it in a heartbeat. Might makes right in sports."
"Draymond aimed for the balls but made no contact, so it should have been a technical at worst (like it was originally called before LeBron begged for an upgrade, because he's a competitor).

"He can shoot and he's inconsistent because he's forced to be this jack-of-all-trades Andre Iguodala bench player for them, and no disrespect but he's not that guy pal, he is not that guy  He needs touches to be consistent as he's shown in his early years and he's not getting them with LBJ, Schroder, Harrell, Davis.."
fmvp is dumb lets throw andre iguodala in the top 50 lmao
"My Dinner with Andre Iguodala, is that anything?"
Andre Iguodala will get his number retired by the Warriors. I personally think he deserves it but I could see some people thinking he doesn't
"The 2011-12 team would have had an incredible future. Jrue, Lou, Young and Iggy, plus they had just drafted Vucevic. Looking back now we can say that would have been a very competitive team for years. They built a great team without tanking and ruined it all with the terrible Bynum trade.   Which of these two teams would you like to have?  *2012 Sixers*  Jrue Holiday (21)  Andre Iguodala (28)  Lou Williams (25)  Thad Young (23)  Nikola Vucevic (21)   *2021 Sixers*  Joel Embiid (26)  Ben Simmons (24)  Tobias Harris (28)  Seth Curry (30)  Danny Green (33)  Embiid is by far the best player out of both teams, but that 2012 team is super good and so young, and didn't cost 3 years of intentional tanking."
"Evolutions would be more like    Eric Bledsoe -&gt; Andre Iguodala -&gt; LeBron James         The way you have been commenting is like    Typhlosion -&gt; Infernape -&gt; Blaziken         In short, your evolutions aren't evolutions."
2015 Warriors because as we all know Andre Iguodala was the best player on the team
You’re obviously a big fan of his and I won’t disagree that he will probably have more winning seasons then not moving forward. Chris Oaul had Trevor Ariza and he battled with Kobe. Almost everyone you listed did better than Booker though.    Jrue Holliday and Andre Iguodala won more games than Books early Suns. Hell Josh Smith and the Pistons did. It’s not an indictment on him to recognize that. He didn’t have to win them all but he wasn’t even flirting with five hundred.
"Yea his chucking is what lost them that series, not Dellavedova being their second best player. Speaking of supporting cast, Andre Iguodala who was a career role player won the finals MVP over a supposed top 15 player of all time because he actually provided value on the defensive end"
"**In order:** Jamal Crawford, Pau Gasol, Amare Stoudemire, Bron, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Brandon Roy, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Steph Curry, Paul George, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, Giannis, Nikola Jokic, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown 🍀, Jayson Tatum 🍀, Luka Doncic, Zion, Lamelo.   **Honorable mentions:** '01 Tony Parker, '04 Andre Iguodala, '06 LaMarcus Aldridge, '08 Russell Westbrook, '11 Kyrie Irving.  It's funny my honorable mentions stopped at 2011 and didn't continue. Those are all the guys i almost picked over ny final pick for that year.  Tony Parker was a fantastic cerebral PG who won several championships with San Antonio. I went with Paul Gasol because he was one of the best 4s in the game and played at a star level alongside Kobe Bryant. That says alot.   Andre Iguodala was always a really good 2-way player and enjoyed a long, healthy career. But people forget how incredible Dwight Howard was. 4x DPOY, explosive athlete who managed to lead his mediocre Magic team past Lebron's slightly worse Cavs team.  It's a shame that both of my picks for '06 were guys that would end up having health problems. Although Aldridge had a much longer career, he was in the league for many years with a heart condition. Long story short, he is lucky to be with us today.  Derrick Rose was *not* by my knowledge ever an injury concern. But what I do know is that his intangibles blow Westbrook's away, and assuming both could've stayed healthy, I'd trust a Rose-led team over a Westbrook-led one any day (except maybe prime OKC...)  Klay Thompson is extremely underrated because he shares the court with the best shooter we've ever seen, but Klay is a fantastic 2-way player who can not only heat up with some of the greatest scorers ever, he also frequently gets the assignment of guarding the opponent's best perimeter or wing player because he can clamp them down. Also team chemistry."
If Suns somehow win the series they should just give the MVP to Andre Iguodala
&gt; Andre Iguodala  Heh
They need to hit on another draft pick and bring in a Boris Diaw or Andre Iguodala type role player in free agency plus Jaren needs to stay healthy and be a star level player for them to contend
"Oh yeah, he did have Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala as teammates didn’t he? That’s a pretty good team."
Andre Iguodala Won finals MVP
"Then Cuban is an idiot.  Machine learning systems build in the biases of whoever designed the system. A basketball machine learning system designed by Gregg Popovitch, Rick Carlisle, Draymond Green, LeBron James, Steph Curry, Chris Paul, Steve Kerr, and Andre Iguodala *might* produce output worth considering.  But not following all the time.  Designed by some guy called Bob is going nowhere good."
Draymond and Andre Iguodala
I wish I have a friend like Andre Iguodala
I'm taking Andre Iguodala
Andre Iguodala
"From the article, Kyrie on his time in Boston:  &gt;He’d tried to stop internalizing the media’s misperception of his ego.   I needed a good laugh.  But the real gem in there was something Iggy told KD before KD decided to bounce out:  &gt;Andre Iguodala had guilt-free advice for his friend. ""At this point, f--- everybody,"" Andre told him. ""That’s including management, anybody — from this team to that team, fans, whoever. Do whatever makes you happy, man, and don’t feel like you’re letting anybody down with any decision that you make.""  I love Iggy, lol.  Just raw truth."
