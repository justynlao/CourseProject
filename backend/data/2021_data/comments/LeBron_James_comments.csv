"&gt; Lebron James was 3rd team that year. Was Kyrie better than him?  Remember, i said 9-11 ? Kyrie arguably was better than dame. Regular season where LBJ played 12 fewer games than Kyrie and his team missed the playoffs while Kyrie's team made it"
"&gt;Which suggests that he was a top 10 player  uhh not really? Lebron James was 3rd team that year. Was Kyrie better than him? If you think Kyrie was a top 10 player that year then he had to be better than 4 out of Lebron, Steph, KD, AD, Harden, Giannis, PG (remember that was PG's ""MVP"" era), Jokic, Dame, Butler, Russ, Embiid, Kawhii and CP3. He might have an argument over 1-2 of those guys, but he was definitely not top 10.  &gt;Then why gatekeep that ?  Gatekeep what? The term all time great? Terms are defined by use. Like how literally now means figuratively. People dont use the term all time great so loosely.   &gt;Repeat - I wasn't the one gatekeeping or suggesting any hard lines  Yea you were. You were the one who wanted to draw hard lines. I've never stated that my opinion is some kind of fact or gatekept anything. In my first reply to you I even qualified my statement with ""I would say that....."".   &gt;I did point out that all time great often was used to referenced careers (eg hakeem on raptors) and not current or peak. And HoF does reference careers  I'm not sure how this is relevant in any way, it seems like a huge strawman. I challenge you to point out where I contradicted this point. Did I say all time greats have to be good right now and not over their careers? That's nonsensical. Obviously you look at an entire career. Kyrie's career just isn't that good.  &gt;There's a lot of All-Stars who you could place below Kyrie.. he's not in the lowest echelon or occasional finding there.  I also challenge you to find where I said he was the worst all star ever...."
"Ah yes, cause the homeless Jimmy Butler had connections or the homeless LeBron James had connections. Definitely not because they were really really good and had scouts come to games and stuff. I‚Äôm sure connections are what are keeping some players out of the league, not the fact that they are less talented then others. How about the European players who come from European leagues. I‚Äôm sure Luka made it to the league because of all the connections he had, not the fact he won the league MVP and championship in Europe. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Who makes generates more money Lebron James,Embiid or Jokic?"
So basically your saying the rumors are true he is the next LeBron James...
Lebron james has entered the chat
"No, I am not saying casual fans have no grasp of the sport, rather, I am saying that casual fans don't care about whether someone accidentally calls Landry Shamet ""Chris Chiozza"".   If the announcers are out here calling LeBron James ""Joel Embiid"" then sure it's an issue but Landry Shamet and Chris Chiozza nobody cares."
Probably because it‚Äôs LeBron Fucking James? Idk how you‚Äôre supposed to guard him in the first place
"Idk what kind of influence you think I have as a minimum wage worker, not even remotely famous person living in the UK. But I can only really express my outrage over certain topics when they arise. At least I'm not actively trying to suppress those topics if I had the money and influence like LeBron James does.  I don't claim to be a saint, but it's pretty ignorant of you to say I don't give a shit just because I'm on Reddit."
"Ever heard of Andrew Wiggins? Oh yeah, it's worth readjusting your value of him 20 games into his career.   https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/andrew-wiggins-lebron-james/"
ITT: fat neckbeards crying that professional athletes including Luka Doncic and Lebron FUCKING JAMES don't behave like they want them to.
Campazzo would probably have a hard time defending lebron James.
"I tend to agree - I really don't think turning Luka into basically James Harden in terms of the weight of the offense being entirely on him is that healthy. He gets compared to LeBron a lot and sure I see why but offensively he's at least a bit more like Harden in his shot diet and what he hunts for, and in terms of how much is on him. Think that's probably a bit of an error."
"The problem is that for all the whining to actually work and not have too much of a negative impact on your own guys, you have to be as good at basketball and valuable to the NBA as LeBron James. Luka might be that one day, but he's just not there yet."
"The advanced stats from last year also say Whiteside was .2 win shares off Kawhi? Gobert had more than Lebron? I could tell you exactly why that is, doesn‚Äôt mean they had a better season. BPM also again, relies on 4 other people on your team. Not a the best stat to use. In fact it would be one of the last. It doesn‚Äôt tell me the difference between 1st in BPM and 10th in BPM.  How can you say Lebron was better on defense? In what way hahaha? Because he finished higher in the defensive player of the year. He got one more first placed vote? I‚Äôll admit Lebron is a better defender but we are like saying the difference between the best defender in the league and the second, it‚Äôs so marginal it isn‚Äôt even a factor and not guaranteed either. Wade averaged 2 steals and 1 block, how many players have done that as a guard?   I‚Äôm not completely ignoring it, if wades team was already a playoff team fair enough. But his team was lottery the year before. You brought up something two years in the future and used that as an argument for Lebron? That‚Äôs impossible to calculate. Like Kobe vs Nash, you can give it to the ‚Äò team‚Äô with the better record, but you can easily make an argument for the other way around. James harden better numbers last year, just not the better record.   Plenty of justification for Wade winning it. Don‚Äôt have to give it to the best record, quite simple really."
Well lebron James is his favorite player...0
"Baseball is mostly worse because the umpire's only tool for enforcement of poor sportsmanship is the ejection. They have to rely on warnings &amp; persuasion to keep a player or a coach from ejecting themselves. In the NBA at least the referees have the technical as a tool for cooling tempers before they escalate into ejections. Therefore, to the casual observer, baseball's ejections seem to happen suddenly &amp; without warning, even if they happened slowly &amp; with many warnings.  This ejection of Bagley is clearly a mistake. That referee is going to feel very silly. I'll make an exception if Bagley engaged in hysterics on 2-4 calls preceeding this, and was warned, which isn't entirely impossible in the NBA, but this is soft &amp; looks horrible. Officials are supposed to keep track of who has been warned/T'd and for the most part all modern officials try to keep players in games (I definitely know some officials who are assholes, but they are a dying breed).  But both sports have standards. Both sports allow players to voice discontent. Both sports are relatively if not perfectly consistent in enforcing them.  Honestly, as a HS/Rec level basketball ref I really wish the NBA would crackdown on this behavior more, not less. I'm tired of getting shit on by parents, coaches &amp; players every time I do or don't blow my whistle everytime the players touch one another, perform a fancy dribble move or otherwise do anything besides dribble normally, chest pass to a teammate or shoot an open jumper, and I do think the kids are largely copying what they see on TV, which is a bunch of whining millionaires, led by Lebron James.  I love Lebron James for the record. Thanks for the ring King.  But if you could stop being so god-damned melodramatic 15 times a game I'd appreciate it."
"There are a lot of different types of teams and players, and different people enjoy watching different styles of basketball.  If you're looking for fast-paced action, watch a Wizards game. They aren't an especially good team this year, but they play very fast and focus more on offense than defense. The Nets also focus a lot more on offense, and they have two or three of the best players in the league.  If you're looking for a slower, more defensively-minded team, you could try the Lakers. That would also let you watch LeBron James. The Suns and the Jazz are also slower teams.  If you're looking for a one-man show, try watching the Warriors. Steph Curry pulls off some of the most amazing shots in basketball history. Nikola Jokic is one of the best passers in the league right now (and a good scorer as well). He plays for the Nuggets.  When I got into basketball, I watched my local team (the Suns) and found a player that I could root for. I really liked Steve Nash. I learned the things that he was good at and the things he was bad at, and that helped me understand the game better. It also helped me appreciate what other players and teams were good at.  I hope you have fun watching! I'm no expert, but let me know if you have any questions and I'll do my best to answer them."
"Of course, but there are magnitudes of no calls, and certain players receive mroe no calls than others and vice versa. I agree, I don't think it's intentional, but it persists. We have stats to prove it too. Look at Jeremy Lin, Goran Dragic, or Shaq, or LeBron, all receive a higher percentage of no calls than say Jimmy Butler or James Harden etc...   Just because other players don't receive calls too, doesn't mean Luka or LeBron etc... wasn't hit on a call. He has a right to be pissed, but do it at a deadball, not while the other team is looking to score."
Lebron James
nah man [LeBron James vs Karl Malone](https://imgur.com/Ce0EmrX)
"&gt;nobody says anything about it  Man, we must be talking about a different Lebron.  If the Lebron James I know sneezes wrong, the next day there will be a half dozen pieces about how Jordan never sneezed that way, Bird never sneezed at all, and how James is an entitled millennial because of how he sneezes."
This was funny at the beginning but now its just so damn cringe. Just go on r/nbacirclejerk and u can see this joke on every Luka post.  Yeah it was fun making jokes about Luka fans who are racists but now its just annoying.And this is not only about Luka really.This place loves to use old jokes even 2 years after they were funny. Same thing piss me of with Lebron James Mickey Mouse jokes on twitter.
"TIL Kyle Lowry, LeBron James, Tim Duncan, Pascal Siakam, DeMarcus Cousins are all European"
"Honestly the funniest part about all of this is if I were the husband Id be fucking rolling if LeBron was talking shit to me. Man Id be like ""Maaan I really got in a 1v1 trash talk with King James""."
"Why are people acting as if it's okay for lebron james to call a fan a bitch? He's old enough to know how to deal with hecklers, this is kinda pathetic imho.  Also he said ""those two, they gotta go"" but then in the interview said he thought the expulsion was unnecessary.... seems fishy to me"
"Opinion not rooted in reality  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/6/8/17441998/lebron-james-steph-curry-mismatch-2018-nba-finals  &gt; In the past three Finals, the Cleveland Cavaliers did everything in their power to get Curry on LeBron. Now the Warriors are giving them the matchup, and somehow the Cavs haven‚Äôt been able to take advantage."
"Wrong.  Top 10 in order and if you disagree you‚Äôre wrong.  Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokiƒá"
Lebron James is by far my least favorite player to watch in the nba.
"I'm not defending her, I dont even care about this beef. I'm pointing out the absurdity of reddit acting like she is a worthless human being primarily because of her lifestyle/physical appearance, when literally all available evidence points to the contrary.    She's just a Karen that made inappropriate remarks towards LeBron James. Nothing more, nothing less."
"&gt;In her Instagram story, (woman) said her husband has been ‚Äúa Hawks fan forever‚Äù and has a longstanding issue with James.  I love how this was worded as if its a mutual personal vendetta between the two.  In reality its probably just that the dude is big mad that Lebron keeps whipping the Hawks' ass whenever they play and Bron doesn't know nor care about either of them."
"&gt;the only comment that is audible from James is him saying ‚ÄúOl‚Äô steroid ass.‚Äù  lebron james, accusing SOMEONE ELSE, of using PEDs? what? am i misreading this?"
&gt;Giving Harden as a similar example for Beal is just insane  Harden had actually lead his team to the playoffs every year and to multiple conference finals. Beal hasn't done shit in comparison.   He was there for 8 contract years. Most players dont even last that long with their rookie deal included. How many times has Lebron James signed a second contract with a team after using up all their assets? You just wanna paint him that way so you'll spin it anyway you can.
Delonte West and his stepson LeBron James
"Idk during my time living in Orange County I‚Äôve seen people will almost always approach ANY celebrity whether it‚Äôs in public, a high end restaurant, or a random bar. I just doubt not 1 person recognized him and didn‚Äôt want to bother him.    I was more adding to the claim that Trout is the LeBron James of baseball but if LeBron was sitting a few tables over then dozens of people would have came up to him whereas with trout it wasn‚Äôt one single soul."
"Westbrook has shot 46 for 164 (28%) in the final 5 minutes of playoff games that were within 5 points, including 8 for 52 on threes.

Only reason people like this cuss at an athlete is because you have security and obstacles between you and them. You'd never say this stuff to someone like LeBron James in a public situation because they'd beat the shit outta you.
"Lebron James is one of the most followed and talked about person on the planet. Him showing his support for Hong Kong would have been huge even if he physically couldn‚Äôt do something.

"That‚Äôs not exactly true. Muscle typically peaks at around age 26 for men. For instance, [weight lifters peak at that age.](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2019.01121/full) Peak bone mass for men [is reached typically by 30.](https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/tp23004spec) And for NBA players the peak [is usually around 26, going down a bit over the next 3-4 years, and then dropping a lot in their early 30s. ](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qkydgq/the-aging-of-lebron-james-why-its-all-downhill-once-nba-players-turn-30) Now of course, as I mentioned, there‚Äôs variance. But it‚Äôs not outlandish to say that GP was no longer in his physical peak at age 33."
"Imagine saying ""I will fuck you up"" to lebron james. Also I wonder what % of her face is real"
"&gt;Do you understand the attention kobe brought to the team? Kobe drawled constant doubles, leading to alot of open shots for his teammates.  Bryant is not from the South, he ""drew"" doubles.  And his open teammates are irrelevant when Bryant fires up a bad shot against two or three defenders anyway.  &gt;When kobe was on the floor the team had a .51 efg% and with him off they had a 43 efg% they had a top 4 ortg with kobe in the court and by far the worst ortg in NBA history while he sat.   Yeah, they had very little offense -- largely because no one wanted to play with the guy who had chased O'Neal out of town a year earlier.  Bryant has to accept much of the blame for the state of the Lakers' roster at that point in time.  Were it not for his attitude, O'Neal would have been winning another ring in Purple and Gold that season, instead of for Miami.  &gt; So kobe wasnt the most efficient but he had +2.3 rts% lebron that same year had + 2.9 rts%. Lebron had a guy coming off an allstar appearance while kobes 2nd option Was super inconsistent.   James was still a 21 year-old kid.  And that 2006 Cleveland roster was not very good, either.  If they played a series against the Lakers without either James or Bryant, they might very well lose. Your claim that Zydrunas Ilgauskas is significantly better than Lamar Odom is dubious.  &gt;In short The lakers as a whole were more efficient with Kobe on the court because of the attention he drew from the defense so simply saying he was inefficient is really stupid when he was still above league average on crazy volume   The ""crazy"" volume was exactly the problem.  Bryant's penchant for attempting shots that would certainly make ESPN's Top 10 plays, instead of the passes that were often available, hampered that team.  It is very difficult to be a consistent shooter when you play with a guy who only passes the ball out of absolute desperation, with one second on the shot clock.  Also, for the record, Bryant's efficiency was about league-average that season, with, as I noted, a massive home-away differential.  On the road, he was shooting the Lakers out of games on most nights.  The attention that Bryant was capable of drawing was wasted, as often as not, because he'd rather take a low-percentage hero shot than pass to a teammate.  He had that attitude when playing with no less than Shaquille O'Neal, as well, so it's disingenuous to blame the quality of his teammates."
"I don't agree with this, at least not world wide.  I live in Denmark, where basketball is not that popular and pretty much everyone knows who Michael Jordan is. He is pretty much  synonymous with basketball. Lebron James however is usually only known by people who actually follow basketball."
"Why the fuck is the NBA letting this dumb Karen bitch get within a thousand feet of Lebron James during a pandemic? I don't care how much her rich husband can pony up for courtside tickets. This should not be allowed, WTF."

[She says she will stand up for her husband against anyone including LeBron James or a fucking bum on the street. She means it.](https://instagram.com/stories/julianaacarlos/2499940364647975980?utm_source=ig_story_item_share&amp;igshid=whvicub2c1i3)
Something tells me she wouldn‚Äôt have actually fucked up LeBron James.
"Hahaha, thanks bro!  ""Talk to my husband one more time and i will fuck you up!""  LMFAAAOOO, how the fuck is Karen Barbie fucking LeBron James up"
LeBron James?
‚ÄúLeBron James‚Äù
Lebron James. The ultimate trump card
"2017- Nurk comes in late season trade, prior to that their 3rd option was *checks notes* Mo Harkless? Lose to the greatest team ever assembled   2018-  Stotts lets Dame get trapped at half court all series with no real secondary playmakers (Pels weren't trapping off CJ). Dame definitely has some blame in this one  2019- Takes team with Meyers Leonard starting to WCF, runs into Warriors again where they unfortunately give up big  leads in each of the last 3 games  2020- Injury-riddled season for a team with a poorly constructed defense, runs into a team with LeBron James and Anthony Davis    The list of guys who could have done any better given these circumstances is VERY short"
"&gt;Klay isn't the type to talk shit for no reason  Klay is constantly talking shit, and then whining when anyone talks shit back.  [Klay Thompson on LeBron James: 'I guess his feelings just got hurt'](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/06/klay-thompson-lebron-james-feelings-hurt-trash-talk-green-nba-finals)  Then got offended by cookies.  [Klay Thompson Calls Cavs 'Bums' and 'Idiots' Over Halloween Cookie Troll](https://www.complex.com/sports/2018/12/klay-thompson-calls-cavs-bums-over-halloween-cookie-troll)"
LeBron James Harden dribbles the ball for the entire possession and hits the stepback 3
I think Lebron James and Kyrie Irving both going nuclear in the finals cost them a chip much more than any trash talking did
But LeBron James makes public his opposition to Daryl Morey‚Äôs spot-on comments about Hong Kong?
"He will have LeBron James feeding him the rock, anyone gets better with him, he took Anderson Varej√£o to the finals as a starter"
"Lebron James the first retired player to win the dunk contest, and he's not even competing."
"&gt;	Durant isn't a playmaker. That's not his position. He's not a guard.   Ah ya let‚Äôs just forget lebron james, Larry bird, KAJ, Kevin Garnett, the all time great playmakers who were guards, ya. No it‚Äôs about usage: how does the player *play.*   &gt;	Durant was always the primary option. OKC would be nowhere without him.  Not in GS he was ....*checks notes* ....**third** in time with the ball, dribbles per possession, passes completed, etc behind Draymond green then number one Curry. How is he the primary option but doesn‚Äôt even have the ball for the *second* most possessions on the team?   I won‚Äôt get into OKC other than WB was the de facto ball handler and creator."
"&gt;Rockets GM says argument could be made for James Harden to be called best offensive player ever                    Is this wrong? I think you *could* make a good-faith argument that Harden is the best offensive player ever, especially during his MVP season when Morey said that. There's obvious arguments to be made for MJ, and maybe Kobe, LeBron, KD, but Harden has a case."
&gt;	What evidence is there to that? The year Westbrook was injured KD won MVP leading his team to 59 wins on .63 TS.  Any of his post seasons in 2014-2016. WB played half the year and then Durant almost *lost to the grizzlies in the first round* if Reggie jackson didn‚Äôt bail him out.   &gt;	But KD was leading a bunch of star 22 year olds and LeBron the Heatles.  Nah that was James harden creating and being the focal point of the Heat‚Äôs defense.   &gt;	I think KD‚Äôs relative value has gone down because its a lot more common now for players to have high efficiency and combine that with playmaking.  Ya unfortunately he does not have the playmaking the other greats do. And it shows: he‚Äôs never had team success really as the primary ball handler and creator

HOT TAKE: if LeBron James is on your team then you‚Äôre probably gonna win some games
And Lebron James and Anthony Davis are better than KD
LeBron James is the GOAT you loser
It doesnt have the same ring because we‚Äôve heard lebron james so much. But yea lebron feels more like a last name
"So bcs he is the second best he is supposed to play with ymca players, he second best player when he was Young was mo Williams now compare that with not wanting to play with westbrook. I dont know if You are insane enough to argue that Durant is better than lebron but for me he is top 20 if he won this year would just kyrie i would have given him Credit and put him top 10 but adding james Harden a top 30 player in league history is yet Again not fair and i dont give a shit if its brooklyn who never won."
"yeah, I mean, Lebron don't know what's like to guard Lebron James or being guarded by Lebron james."
Best explanation right here. High end starter. With 2 elite skills. Passing and defense. And the best floor general this side of Lebron James when you consider how he does it on both ends. But idk how you quantify that.
"James LeBron doesnt have the same ring to it, but it makes sense that the common name is the first name and the uncommon name is a last name."
Team LeBron vs Team James would be pretty funny though.
[I am well aware](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/14/us/lebron-james-nba-china-intl-hnk-scli/index.html).
Cool. Lebron James literally didn't even try and was eating snacks on the bench like a child.
"‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre misinformed or you‚Äôre not educated about something, and I‚Äôm just talking about the tweet itself, you never know the ramifications that can happen,‚Äù said Lebron James  https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/LeBron-James-comments-on-China-an-14535304.php"
"They just missed the point of All-Star completely. KD chose a bunch of ISO guys who focused on getting shots like what they can normally get in games.   LeBron chose guys who would play off each other well and they were getting crazy opportunities as a result of it. He had all the best playmakers and off-ball players.   They had facilitators like:  * Luka, CP3, Jokic, LeBron - 4 generationally great playmakers  And then on the end of those plays they had:  * Giannis, Curry, Gobert, Brown - Really efficient off-ball players  And then you've still got Lillard and Paul George in the mix...   Hell, the reason Giannis went 16/16 is because he was mostly being fed good opportunities and he's so good on capitalising on them. CP3 + Giannis was killer.  Whereas Team KD came down to ISO ISO ISO. Even at the end you could hear Doc saying ""when Kyrie and James [Harden] get the ball clear out and give them space""."
"It could be infinity for all it matters.   Humanity will go extinct before it happens.    A lifetime (100 yrs) does the statement no justice.   Ten lifetimes (1,000 yrs) doesn't even do it justice.      Lebron James has been on an incredible (MVP like) plateau for 11 years straight, through age 37 - without even a decline in sight as of yet.      Go look up any great player in the history of the game- MJ, Duncan, Kobe, Russell, Dirk, Kareem - they all deteriorate in their early 30s, significantly so.      LeBron might be 40 years old and be averaging 22, 9, and 7 - All-Star numbers.    You're telling me that this will ever happen again makes me think you're team Jordan in the GOAT debate.    If so, while you say it's just a matter of time before LeBron comes along again, I bet you think we'll never see another Jordan again.   Spoiler Alert: We already have and his name was Kobe.  Not as pretty or cinematic as MJ, but basically the exact same player, with a better 3 at that.    LeBron's a golden unicorn, just like Brady.  I'll die someday knowing I saw the best ever in these 2 sports, for as long as time lasts."
"I know it‚Äôs James Harden for team Durant, but which player has the fat suit on team LeBron?"
"Just watched Mickey Mouse clubhouse this morning and right away I thought of one man when I saw that logo. LeFraud James. I‚Äôm disappointed in you LeBootyJuice, I had to lie when my dog asked,‚Äù Is it true LeBald won a Mickey Mouse ring?‚Äù, shame on you Lebum.  This is the worst. My pet attack helicopter used to always think LeFraud was the goat until today. He found out that Lebum has 0 rings and 4 mickey mouse rings. He is honestly ashamed of LeBum and wishes he could actually see his idol win a real ring. Shame on you LeNottop1000  IS THIS REALLY WHAT OUT SOCIETY HAS COME TO??? I WAS PROPOSING TO MY WIFE WHEN LEFRAUD CAME IN AND STOLE HER RING. I CANT BELIEVE HE DID THIS IN FRONT OF MY CHILDREN. I HAD TO TELL THEM IT WAS BECAUSE HE ONLY HAS FRAUD MICKEY MOUSE RINGS. SHAME ON YOU LEMICKEY!!  I‚Äôm  literally shaking. My teacher said ‚ÄúEverybody gets an A if LeBron has won a real ring.‚Äù I told her the truth. Now we all have an F. Shame on you lemickey!  I was in McDonald‚Äôs eating a happy meal when LeSwept came in and ran with my FOOD! Luckily the security guard that was there was the one and only JASON TERRY aka his FATHER, and he tackled LeChoke and got me and my son‚Äôs food back!  Man this BLOWS! I ran to the library to get the new publication for my son ‚ÄúHow to Win a Real Ring‚Äù by Michael Jordan but they said every copy was STOLEN And you‚Äôll never guess who... LeFraud James...broke it to my son and he cried. How could his idol do this? Shame on u LeMickey  I was watching the Mickey Mouse clubhouse earlier and right away I thought of one man. LeFraud James. After seeing the logo I was immediately overwhelmed with disappointment and I even had to lie to my pet fish when he asked me about your finals record (3-6-1) SHAME ON YOU.  I was trying to win my son a Ring Pop at a Disney World Arcade game and guess who was my opponent? None other than LeFraud! I beat him really bad, and guess what happens? LeMickey gets Ray Allen to knock me out and steals the ring pop! Shame on you LeFailure my son is now crying!  It was just a normal day for me. I was running my family jewelry shop.Then suddenly a man with a handgun burst through the door, guess who it was LeFraud!!! He stole all my rings and ran away! I had to tell my kids and my family that we were poor. All because of LeMickey!  can't believe it. My pet Alligator who has been a LeBootyJuice fan since he was in highschool asked me, ""is it true that my idol will never be better than Micheal Jordan. Unfortunately that is the truth and he is now ashamed to be a fan of Lefraud. Unbelievable.  I was playing madden with LeCock and balls and he made my controller sticky with his ring pop Mickey Mouse ring. I ended up losing the game because LeButtsex broke my right analog stick and I couldn‚Äôt QB spy Lamar Jackson, who he ran with on every play. Shame on you LeMickey!  I walk into Blaze pizza with my kids and up to the counter. I‚Äôm reading the menu when out of nowhere LeFraud James jumps infront of me and slams a Mickey Mouse pizza right into my face!!! Now my kids are crying and we are all so hungry with NO PIZZA! Thanks LeBooty Juice James!!!  I‚ÄôM LITERALLY SHAKING. LEGRINCH WAS ABOUT TO STEAL MY PRESENTS!! LUCKILY I YELLED ‚ÄúWIN A REAL RING LEMICKEY‚Äù AND HE WENT AWAY CRYING TO HIS DADDY JJ BAREA!! I SAVED CHRISTMAS FROM BEING RUINED BY LEFRAUD!!!  On the last day of Christmas LeFraud gave to me 12 excuses given  11 choked quarters  10 fake finals 9 tears to the refs  8 missed free throws  7 flops and travels 6 finals losses 5 turnovers  4 klutch checks 3 super teams  2 bailed out rings And a Mickey Mouse clubhouse ring  I called LeFraud yesterday but it went straight to voicemail... very odd... because whenever I call MJ it usually has 6 rings to it. And he always comes up clutch answering my calls. Must be bc LeMickey has 0 real rings! As calculated, LeChoke lets us down again!   Crazy, I know a certain guy who started this whole superteam thing on july 8th 2010, only to score 8 points in an NBA finals game and get outscored by a 6‚Äô2 Jason Terry   I'm literally shaking. LeWashed tried to steal my 8 year old child's hula hoop mistaking it for a ring. Fortunately JJ Barea was there at first to stop the theft but when JJ left LeFraud came back with Ray Allen and Kyrie to steal the hula hoop.   Shame on you LeBum  RIDICULOUS! I was watching the Mickey Mouse Ceremony on Disney Channel with my 7 year old son and guess who shows up On the screen?  LeFraud himself! My son asked me ‚Äúis that the man who choked 6x in the finals and can‚Äôt win a real ring‚Äù I had to lie to my own son. Shame on LeBum"
the same grown folks that think lebron james is scared of vaccine because he's black?
"You think LeBron James has ever lost one minute of sleep of issues with China???      Don't *even* give him the credit for being woke like that.    Dribble the damn ball, LeBron."
"""*Hey LeBron, can you trade for me?*"" - James Harden"
Stephen ‚ÄúLebron ‚ÄúleGM‚Äù James‚Äù Curry
"""*I created this.*"" - LeBron James"
Remember when the dumb lady on the voice said vaccines come autism and everyone was like you are nuts... Now LeBron James is anti vax lol. Why on earth would you wanna keep it private unless you weren't taking it...
"Yes.  Lowest in history.    The author of this article knows that you don't know the ratings history of the NBA. They know this and can market you a shiny piece of shit.    They are barely drawing 1 mil viewers now for primetime ESPN and TNT games.  Again, ratings have been falling all season long.  Many prime time National games are around 700k total.  That's pathetic.    Some people checked in to see if NBA was woke in first week, then bailed as it was 1000% woke.  Plus the whole NBA sucking China's cock thing.....despite along their atrocities, including enslaving millions of Muslims.    Wrestling is a bigger draw now.  As is Dora the Explorer.    Get used t ok it, because it's only getting worse.    Just wait until the world learns that Lebron James staged his own fake hate crime, which will end up in here with many other situations he has pushed:  Www.fakehatecrimes.org  Yep."
"If your own health decisions are based on what LeBron James or any other pro athlete does, you're already a lost cause.   Maybe don't ask a high school graduate what his thoughts are about the field of medicine."
Fuck lebron the bitch james  He's just reading the script his chinese daddy gave him
"the appeal for the dunk contest for the first 20 years was never really about the dunks, it was always about the superstars competing in the dunk contest. Fore example michael jordan, dominique, kobe bryant etc. This all ended when Lebron james refused to enter the dunk competition and normalized superstars not entering, yes, you had a few golden years for the dunk contest in the 2000s when people were coming up wiht innovative never before seen dunks, but and now that the NBA has transitioned to a more perimeter oriented game the upcoming superstars will be less explosive and you get randoms entering dunk competitions and this is the end result."
"This isn‚Äôt even a coherent comment. Acting like Lebron James is somehow setting the movement for racial equality 60 years back (that‚Äôs another hyperbole for you, you should learn to spot them) because he used a HYPERBOLE that is NOT TO BE TAKEN LITERALLY is insane. Go outside. Read a book."
"This is not unique to Lebron James. I don‚Äôt know why he is playing coy, but in general the African American community is very skeptical and for good reasons   Our large health system has vaccination data broken down by race, and the vaccination rate is markedly lower among African Americans."
Most people also don't have the resources and platform of Lebron James.
"You're not _wrong_ but again, it's a problem completely outside of politics. To act like this is a Trump voter problem only gets at a segment of the skeptics. It's not like LeBron James is a big Trump guy. It's not like Republicans are organic food enthusiasts. We're talking about an aspect of human nature, not a red state blue state cultural problem."
"Lebron and Curry born in the same hospital... That's weird af üòÇ. Gives more credibility to the conspiracy theory that lebron james is an experiment by the US government, (and as well as Curry now)."
&gt; Well you see the situation in china hurt us financially and spiritually but most importantly did I say financially  Lebron James. Not probably. Literally
Fuck LeBron James
"I had Michael Buble in this chair not long ago, I asked him, I said, ‚ÄúMike, you &amp; Lebron are good friends; just between me &amp; you, how old is LeBron, really?‚Äù He looked at me and said, ‚ÄúLeBron James 137 years old.‚Äù"
"‚ÄúI speak from a very educated mind. I‚Äôm kind of the wrong guy to go at, because I do my homework.‚Äù  -lebron james"
"""*I wonder how I can get that Curry guy on the Lakers...*"" - LeBron James"
"Yeah Lebron ""I do my homework"" James  agreed"
"Wow LeBron James, anti-vaxxer"
"""Socialist, LeBron James, sings Canadian national anthem"""
LeBron antivaxx James smiling when they announced covid deaths lmaoo
"There's a lot of people who think that if LeBron James doesn't take the lead on *every* issue that it means he doesn't actually care about *any* issues.  It's stupid, but threads like this bring out the stupid."
"""I am woke, but I am not THAT woke!"" -LeBron James apparently"
Lebron James is a basketball player not a doctor lmao
"Let me get this straight, so KD signed with a 73 win team that took pay cuts to form a literal starting 5 of all stars. Now he's in brooklyn where in the span of two years he has another damn near starting 5 of all stars in Irving, Harden and Griffin.   Kevin Durant is the best player in the world and LeBron James needs help to win? Bro, the hypocrisy on the internet is getting out of hand. Keep that energy consistent for fuck sake, this shit is weak."
"Why are people so butthurt? It‚Äôs his choice at the end of the day, why are you talking shit if he doesn‚Äôt want to get vaccinated? Yeah, he‚Äôs LeBron fucking James, but he‚Äôs human at the end of the day, he doesn‚Äôt have to share EVERYTHING he does or will do.."
That's your opinion just leave it at that plus if someone is waiting to know if lebron James is getting the vaccine before they decide what to do then those people need more help than covid
That is such a stupid argument. Do Jews not trust trains? Lebron James has a grade 9 education at best before he was just given A+ cause he could ball.
"&gt; You deadass think brown could make those adjustments nurse made against bucks and golden state??  I‚Äôm saying he doesn‚Äôt need to because he has Lebron fucking James on his team who carried scrubs to the finals the year before.  &gt; I agree lebron and Joel would eat but Simmons ain‚Äôt doing dick but chilling in the dunkers spot. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying  My point is that‚Äôs *fine* when you realize the defensive powerhouse that team would be with Lebron + Joel carrying the offense.  Let me phrase this a different way - put Simmons on the Lakers, do they get better or worse? Because Lebron + AD are the defending champs, and then you had the most versatile defender in the game. That‚Äôs similar to what this team would be"
"What's stopping Minnesota or Charlotte from offering a better package for Harden than what the Nets offered? What stopped the Cavs from acquiring Amare at the deadline that year?  I find it hard to believe that small markets don't have a trade package to acquire superstar players. I find it much easier to believe that they do have the packages that could acquire those guys but they're scared that those players would want out very soon or that they wouldn't want to go there at all.   I'm sure that Wolves picks would be much much more attractive to the Rockets than those Nets picks. Maybe one day one of those small market teams will have the balls to say hey, let's go get this superstar and we'll pair him with KAT or LaMelo or whoever the star is that they currently have, and they'll go get that James Harden or even a Bradley Beal type of player and say fuck it.   I'm just using those two teams as an example. I don't see why you couldn't go get a star that might have one or two years left on his contract and say hey, we're acquiring you, figure it out with KAT or don't, you're going to be here for the next year and a half.   There was no guarantee that AD would have stayed with the Lakers, but they said hey, we have LeBron and the assets to get AD, we're going to acquire him with no assurances that he'll re-sign with us and let's see what happens. I don't think that's some once in a lifetime scenario only available to the Lakers because they play in Los Angeles. The Lakers had one star and the assets to acquire another star who only had 1 year left on his deal and made it anyway.   What's stopping the Twolves from getting one other than fear? All these small markets do is luck into one star, surround them with garbage (assuming they don't luck their way into another star or two in the lottery), piss away their careers for 7 years then trade them in year 8 and complain that stars are always leaving them."
Wow his wife is LeBron James
"&gt;The fact that Zion can get to the rim from anywhere on the court makes him a better perimeter shot creator.  No it doesn't. Because he's limited to 1 spot.   &gt;Obviously CJ McCollum is a better perimeter scorer than LeBron James  If this were some alternate universe where LeBron never developed the ability to score outside the paint, this would have been a decent analogy"
&gt; Nobody said it did. But the fact that Tatum can create his shot from anywhere on the court makes his offensive skill set more valuable than a player than can only score at the rim.  The fact that Zion can get to the rim from anywhere on the court makes him a better perimeter shot creator.  Obviously CJ McCollum is a better perimeter scorer than LeBron James.
"Calling anyone who has a first name as their last name by their last name sounds really weird      Ex. Chris Paul, Lebron james, kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Anthony Davis, Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, Dwight Howard. The only exeptions to this are d‚Äôangelo Russell and Michael Jordan"
Lebron. You could make highlight reels of clutch defensive stops Lebron has gotten in his career. Like he blocked Rose's game tying 3 point attempt in Game 5 2011. Have you ever seen Giannis *block* a 3 pointer? Heck Lebron last playoffs blocked a James Harden floater. Who blocks a *floater*? There aren't many players in nba history who have the ceiling Lebron has defensively. He might even have the highest defensive ceiling ever.
bro Yuta Watanabe is not LeBron James. plus LeBron was in much better position on that play
"That's true. Ben simmon's defense compared to gobert's defense is the exact same as joe harris and lebron james.   Jazz fans are brainless. If you want to use MVP as an example, use Harden vs Russ. Player that does everything well vs scorer."
 The bolded ones are all Yes.   The strikethroughs definitely No.  The others are borderline.   &amp;#x200B;  * **Lebron James** * James Harden * Steph Curry * **Giannis Antetokoumpo** * **Kevin Durant** * ~~Kyrie Irving~~ * Kawhi Leonard * Nikola Jokic * ~~Russell Westbrook~~ * ~~Luka Doncic~~ * Joel Embiid * ~~Karl-Anthony Townes~~ * ~~Jayson Tatum~~ * ~~Ben Simmons~~ * ~~Devin Booker~~ * ~~Trae Young~~

"Of that list of talent and consistency, I'm comfortable stating LeBron, James, Steph, Giannis, KD, Kawhi, and Russ right now - Jokic and Luka are right there for me, but not quite yet. Everyone else is a tier below in my eyes."
"A generational player is the players you think of when you think of a certain era. Usually a span on 10 years. Players who *define* the era they played in not just exceed.   Previous generational talents:  Bill Russell  Wilt Chamberlain  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Magic Johnson  Larry Bird   Michael Jordan   Kobe Bryant  Tim Duncan  Lebron James   We don't know who's next yet   There are some other notable players like Oscar, Jerry West, Dr. J, Hakeem, Shaq, KG, Curry, and Durant but I chose to list first people I thought of whenever I think of an era."
Generational talents:  Lebron James  Kevin Durant  Steph Curry  &amp;#x200B;  Up Next:  Giannis Antetokoumpo   Zion Williamson
"Jarrett Allen has this same mindset and I loved him for it. Had some amazing blocks (Lebron James, Blake Griffin, Giannis) and has been postered plenty of times (John Collins, Marquese Chriss)."
"&gt; Giannis is pretty great at that   He's not even close to LeBron James as a playmaker or passer. Like, not even remotely comparable."
"The following is apparently the plot:  LeBron and his son are sucked into Warner Bros' server and a CGI humanoid named Al G Rhythm kidnaps LeBron's son in order to steal LeBron's Instagram followers. LeBron has to round up the Looney Tunes, including a banished Bugs, to defeat the Goon Squad in a basketball game. When James is sucked into the WB server, he drifts through some of the studio's most famous films to track down his underdog squad. In addition to entering these worlds, WB characters will be watching the game courtside. WB properties like Mad Max, Casablanca, Matrix, The Mask, Harry Potter, Wonder Woman, and more will be present.  Sounds pretty awful tbh"
"Like OP's example, using only ""Kevin"" to refer to Kevin Durant. Same for any player with a relatively common name and a relatively uncommon other name. If you said ""James"" then we'd ask ""LeBron or Harden?"""
"The best is when LeBron &amp; Harden are both in the discussion for something such as MVP, and then someone refers to one of them as ""James"" haha"
"&gt; ‚ÄúJust like in the NBA, I like to be coached by my coaches,‚Äù James explains. ‚ÄúI was the same way on set.‚Äù  LeBron for Best Director confirmed"
specifically by LeBron James.
"Dude, are you dense? No one knew how good they would be until after the fact. You are obviously looking at their career in hindsight. Pippen was garbage when he was DRAFTED and got better. Phil Jackson was an UNKNOWN coach with 0 rings. Jesus.  A superteam is an ALREADY KNOWN super star like Lebron James joining a super star like Dwayne Wade and all star like Chris Bosh by signing with Miami. A superteam is superstar Kevin fucking Durant joining the 73-9 GSW with Unanimous MVP Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. This isn't Rocket science."
I guess I would be salty too if my only claim to fame was lebron james being born in akron
"I get the reaction to paying that much for a video, but it‚Äôs fundamentally the same as trading cards. He‚Äôs acting like a pretty piece of cardboard has extremely more intrinsic value than a mp4 file. I could just as easily go on Google images and print out a picture of Lebron James, but it obviously isn‚Äôt valuable because it isn‚Äôt limited."
"Lol, you're acting like he did it to Stephen Curry/Lebron James."
"Aliens coming down to Earth and challenging him to a game of basketball for the fate of the planet. Their best 5 vs LeBron and 4 of his choosing.  Then the ensuing game is a back and forth nail biter down to the wire. Aliens up 1 in the closing seconds.  Kyrie taking the ball up off the inbounds. He's a changed man knowing the earth is round after watching aliens arrive to take over the planet. Beef with LeBron is squashed for the sake of mankind.  He now believes LeBron is another motherfucker that can make that shot so when the aliens double team he passes to him.  LeBron, emboldened to save humanity and prove he's Earth's MVP, power drives to the rim, euro steps, but the layup doesn't fall at the buzzer.  But there's a late foul call!  LeBron at the line, bricks the first try!  Still a chance to play for OT...oh no, an airball...  Humanity is enslaved under the rule of our new alien overlords all because of LeBron, former Hall of Fame lock, blows it at the line.  So no one like Bronny James can rise up and challenge them for the planet the aliens systematically destroy any trace of basketball's past existence. Courts, balls, arenas, etc including the Hall gone til basketball is only a distant memory in the oldest survivors of LeBron's FT failure."
Lebron James adds politics to his summer workouts
"Nah, won't change the fact that the Lakers already have Lebron fucking James at that point."
They probably will use these. The NBA has already released All Star shirts with a similar design: https://store.nba.com/mens-lebron-james-jordan-brand-royal-2021-nba-all-star-game-name-and-number-t-shirt/p-93353639417528+z-829-3367465732?_ref=p-CLP:m-GRID:i-r0c0:po-0
"I hate it when people say the regular season does not matter. If we are going by historical accounts, the finals usually consists of either a number 1 or 2 seed from each conference. Why is that? Because the best teams in the league are usually winning the most games, and they prove that in the regular season. That is where you build habits, good defense, and all the necessary traits needed to be a championship caliber team. You just don't magically go from being a struggling team in the regular season, to a finals contender. Case in point, the 2019-2020 Clippers. Championship favorites, probably the most talented roster that year, but they could never put it fully together in the regular season, and once the playoffs came around, they struggled and lost in the 2nd round.  Yes, there are some years that are the exception, like the bubble with the Heat and Lakers, but that was such an anomaly of a season with no home court advantage and no fans in attendance.  The only way you can get away with saying stuff like this, is if you have LeBron fucking James on your team. The man is a beast and he carried the 5th seed Cavaliers to a finals appearance, so his teams are the exception to the general rule. I don't care if the Lakers are the 8th seed. I am still picking them coming out of the west, but that is only because of LeBron, and assuming if AD is fully healthy. But the Jazz are legit and being disrespected hard. I think they can beat anybody in the west at full health in series, except for maybe the Lakers."
"Buddy getting 3 points on a 2 point shot and it never being changed was crazy. The score was 121-120 before the last second foul.   It was literally the difference of a OT and a Loss. But oh well, no Gasol, no Anthony Davis, No Lebron James, no Caruso and Lakers still showed up. I loved the intensity and offense they had."
No but the one that includes Lebron James and Anthony Davis might

LeBron James. watch carefully. This is how you carry a team and will them to win. #eMVPiid.
LeBron James. watch carefully. This is how you carry a team and will them to win. #eMVPiid.
Do you genuinely believe the duo of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George is better than the duo of Lebron James and Anthony Davis? That Clippers team also had so many chemistry problems all season long and could never get it right.
"This nonsense definitely contributes to people not watching the game. Not ""There's too many fouls, the referees are too soft on contact!"" so much (though I'm sure that annoys a lot of people) but literally having about 10 super-stars who can do whatever they want and the optics when a great player who's not on a superteam receives infinitely more attention. I know it's completely played out to go ""IF LEBRON JAMESSS!"" but really. If Lebron James was telling this official he fingered his mother last night, then stared him in the eyes while bouncing a ball off the floor in to his teeth the referee would apologize to King James for the smell on his fingers."
"The amount of times someone can see that clip regardless if you own it is limitless. Just because I buy a bunch of carrots and label them 1-100 doesnt mean they're any different from a regular carrot. Cards have a set amount printed and the only way to ""experience"" the card is know someone who owns it or own it yourself. You cant just go to google and type ""Lebron rookie card"" and print out a PSA 10 lebron the way you can go to YouTube type in Lebron James highlight and watch the clip in 1080P"
"the year before the Rookies sported a 30 years young rookie Jorge Garborosa along with 22 year olds Paul Mislap and Andrea ""Primo Pasta"" Bargnani; 23 year olds Adam ""Mustache Morrison and Brandon Roy; and babies (21) Jordon Farmar and Rudy Gay.  Jorge was a year younger than KG, who would appear in his 10th allstar game the next night. And he was older than many of the other allstars, including Gilbert Arenas, Dwyane Wade, Lebron James, Chris Bosh, Dwight Howard..."
"And while AD has been hurt the Lakers are 7-6, which should automatically disqualify LeBron from this race. He has put up worse stats than guys like Kawhi, Embiid, Jokic, Steph and Dame AND when his 2nd best player isn't on the court his team has been mediocre, there's no debate.  The only reason LeBron James is in the MVP discussion is because his name is LeBron James and the media/fans try to insert him into the MVP discussion every year regardless of whether he deserves it or not, i.e 2018, 2020 and now 2021."
"Lol I don't give a fuck about my experience relative to theirs, anybody who has Kobe Bryant as the greatest player ever is a nostalgic moron. It doesn't take much to see that. Michael Jordan alone was just straight up much better, and he alone automatically eliminates Kobe from the greatest ever title.  Players are not the ultimate authority on anything. Shaquille O'Neal and Charles Barkley were both top 15 players ever and cry nonstop about how teams are shooting too many threes and about how guys like Kristaps fucking Porzingis should post up. Magic Johnson had LeBron James on his team and said ""fuck spacing"" in favor of constructing a meme team around him."
"Because you are saying something that isnt factual. Lebron does not get more hate than other superstars in this sub. Rondo SPAT on Chris Paul and people up voted it. That is one example among many, stop this nonsense.  I dont dick ride anyone, I like James Harden because he's the second best Rocket of all time and I want to see him win a ring. I would never tell you anything delusional like he's better than Lebron or he's been MVP over  Embid this season or that he's most liked superstar when he istn. What you are saying about Lebron is you stanning him and wanting him to be number 1 in hatred for some weird ass reason."
"Pretty sure that's what the user who you responded to is talking about. OP is complaining about the odds as if LeBron has already won it, and the user said the odds don't matter at all in the big picture. Unless OP is mad because he wants to bet LeBron James and can't get good odds, then the user you replied to is correct."
"the actual value of LeBron James puts every team in over the cap and into the luxury tax instantly, before the second player signs."

"The first thing I would recommend is looking at the standings:  [https://www.espn.com/nba/standings](https://www.espn.com/nba/standings)  This will give you a good idea of the ""exciting teams"".  Next, i would check the National TV schedule for games with these top teams as they are typically going to be the most exciting games:  [https://www.espn.com/nba/schedule](https://www.espn.com/nba/schedule)  I would recommend watching the Philadelphia 76ers vs Dallas Mavericks game that is on ESPN on Monday April 12th.     These are two teams hoping to compete for a title this year. They also have two of the MVP candidates :       Joel Embiid (76ers) - he is the 7' center for PHI. In the past, centers were usually just big guys who would be there to lay in easy shots near the basket. Embiid is a good representation of the way the league is headed. He can shoot 3pointers, he can handle the ball well (most centers cant/wont). Hes all around a fun, exciting player to watch.       Luka Doncic (Mavericks) - Luka is one of the youngest stars in the NBA. He has been compared to LeBron James by some people (who is considered a Top 3 player all time).  \---       I would just watch the majority of this game keeping your eye on these two players. I would listen to the announcers who are sometimes pretty good at giving extra details you may not have noticed (like why something was a good or bad shot, etc.).       Most of all, watch the body language of both teams. See if one team looks bored or if one team seems to be having a ton of fun. Honestly nomentum is one of the core parts of NBA basketball in my opinion.            \---  After watching that, id recommend taking a look at this years All Star teams:  https://www.nba.com/2021-all-star-roster  Familairizing yourself with the big names in the league makes the games a lot more fun and easy to get into.  While you can definitely appreciate games between ""bad teams"" without stars, i think its a lot tougher for new fans to get into because theres not the same ""energy"" and excitement that star players bring"

We didn't file any complaint or anything like that,"" Vogel said. ""There's a thing called the officiating portal that you're allowed to submit calls that you think were wrong calls from the game before. We do that every game all year long, as does every team, and this series has been no different."
"He's so underrated - in the 21st century, only Lebron James has been more accomplished than Duncan  But true to his character, he stays lowkey and just keeps doing his thing. I'd love to see him become a legendary NBA coach, and win 5 more rings that way"
For those who want HIS list and not the fan list  1. Michael Jordan  2. LeBron James  3. Shaquille O'Neal  4. Hakeem Olajuwon  5. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  6. Larry Bird  7. Stephen Curry  8. Kevin Garnett  9. Tim Duncan  10. Magic Johnson
"&gt; Lakers-AD,Lebron,Caruso,Schroder,KCP   Not answering the question, but that's not the Lakers' best defensive lineup.    James/Davis/Kuzma/Caruso/Schroder is better.  Caldwell-Pope has occasional moments of good defense, but he gets lost way too often, and Kuzma is much better these days.  He's also taller, and a much better rebounder, which that lineup would need."

Consider all time career defensive win share.  Russell: 133.6.  Duncan: 106.4  No one else is over 100.    Dwight Howard and Lebron James are the next contemporary players and the are in the low to mid 70's.
"The Clippers have actually been one of the best run organizations since Balmer took over, and they've been one of the most competitive teams 2012.  I know Chuck is looking at a life time of experience, but outside of the Webber years, the Kings haven't won a playoff series in almost 40 years.   The last time they won a playoff series, LeBron James wasn't even in the league.   So, yeah, the Clippers sucked while they had a shitty owner, but they have a new owner who has changed the culture."
"Lebron beat the Wizards who were a .500 team that year in the first round, in the second round he beat the Nets who were also a .500 team that year, they had a 30 year old Vince Carter(Who was great that regular season) &amp; 33 year old Jason Kidd they took the Cavs to 6 games, then he beat the Pistons who were a great team that year but had lost their most important player in Ben Wallace, still a good feat by James who took that team to 6 games, Lebron proceeded to get swept 4-0 in the Finals averaging 22/7/7, though this was to an All Time Team in the Spurs.  KD beat the defending Champs in Dallas 4-0, then proceeded to beat the Lakers who played well that regular season in 5, then took the All Time Great Spurs to 6, then proceeded to get gentleman swept by the Heatles in 5 while averaging 30/7/2.  We also have to take into account the level of competition Lebron was playing against, his teammates were bad but its not like he was going up against All Time teams, KD had better teammates but faced WAYYYYY tougher competition and was unquestionably the best player on his team. I'd give the edge to KD over Lebron for this one."
"but what's a legitimate reason not to get it? there isn't one apart from being immuno-compromised, and lebron james is not.  so it would be a case of him lying, and a case of an immensely wealthy man with a platform telling people without those benefits that they should get a vaccine that he didn't get himself.  that erodes trust in him, and then it erodes trust in the vaccine because if the vaccine is so good, why would it need a rich man to lie about it for the rest of us get it? if the vaccine is so good why isn't the rich man getting it?  it becomes a case of tainted by association, just like brands get rid of people who are bad for their rep."
"Well that settles it then, once and for all. Lebron James is better than Dennis Schroder"
"And here I was, thinking that your bad takes were only limited to topics involving Lebron James"
"I cant believe Tom Brady, a dude who looks a dorky middle aged dad is cooler on social media than lebron fucking james."
"Lebron ""I am the storm"" James"
"I really don‚Äôt think that would be an issue at all, assuming he had a legitimate reason not to get the vaccine...at worst it would erode public trust in Lebron James, not in the vaccine itself.   And if he doesn‚Äôt have a legitimate reason to get the vaccine, he should get the fucking vaccine."
"Montrezl Harrell yelled, ‚ÄúThere you go!‚Äù Andre Drummond gave a look of pleasant surprise.  Alex Caruso belted, ‚ÄúWe got an [expletive] squad now.‚Äù And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Jared Dudley hugged him &amp; said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù"
Imagine once we get Lebron James and Anthony Davis back   League fucked
"Neither KD nor LeBron ever had such a terrible supporting cast. Even James' worst Finals team back in 2007 could **consistently** drain open threes, whereas no one on the Warriors can. Sucking in two or three defenders isn't effective if your teammates can't be counted on to hit a jumper."
"LeBron, Wade and Bosh agreed to team up together years before they actually did.  From [April 2010](https://www.wbur.org/news/2010/04/28/heat-celtics-4):  &gt; Ray Allen scored 24 points to help Boston beat Miami 96-86 on Tuesday night and eliminate the Heat in Game 5 of their first-round playoff series. It could be the last game in Miami for Wade, or it could be the beginning of a new era there if he returns and recruits LeBron James to join him. &gt;  &gt; ""This will be my last first-round exit for a while, I can tell you that,"" Wade said. ""I'm looking forward to continuing to build, and being with some great players next year, continuing to beef up our roster.  From [May 2010](http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=5224873):  &gt; Dwyane Wade has a big decision to make on where he'll sign this offseason. And before he makes his choice, he said he'll talk it over with fellow big-ticket free agents LeBron James and Joe Johnson. &gt;  &gt; Wade told the Chicago Tribune that he's not sure when the three players will talk, but they've been discussing their futures informally for a while now. &gt;  &gt; ""[Free agency] has been three years coming,"" the Miami Heat superstar told the Tribune. ""We've discussed it prematurely, at different times. [But] you don't know what guys are thinking and where they're going. I think we'll all sit down, and before one of us makes a decision, all of us will have spoken to each other and [listened to the] thinking. &gt;  &gt; ""A lot of decisions [will be based on] what other players are willing to do and what other guys want to do. So it's not just a 'me' situation here. We all have to look and see what each other is thinking."" &gt;  &gt; A source told ESPN The Magazine's Chris Broussard that the Toronto Raptors' Chris Bosh also will join Wade, James and Johnson when they discuss free agency. &gt;  &gt; ""Bosh will definitely be there,"" a source said."
"Hasty generalization fallacy, that was one series, you can't say he's bad as a number one option off of one series. 2014-15 NBA Playoffs Lebron James had a TS% of 48% by your logic he is also bad as a number one option"
Are you really that dumb?  So you think LeBron James right after being beat by the Warriors would go and text other players in the parking lot for more help?  Put some respect on LeBron's name. I don't even think you are a Lakers fan.
&gt; Lots of players (especially in today‚Äôs NBA) would‚Äôve done the same  Do you think LeBron James after being beat by the Warriors went and texted James Harden right after the game?
"The rankings:   **DPOY:**  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Bam Adebayo  **MVP:**   1. Nikola Jokic 2. Damian Lillard 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo 4. Joel Embiid 5.

"In terms of defense... he is in the bottom third of the NBA though. Here is [his on/off](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4432/onoff#tab-team_efficiency). If you flip around and look at people like Lebron, Giannis, Suns stint Nash, Curry, Giannis, they consistently improve their team to a much greater extent. Curry was insane and he improved his team +20 per 100 at some point. Lebron James since he was 19 years old helped his team by 10+ per 100 most years and was arguably better than Luka at a younger age. Just like any other stats, on/off has flaws and shouldn't be taken as gospel but it really is one of my favorites because it doesn't simply reward for having high volume and uncontested rebounds and at least attempts to factor in defense and how the team overall plays."
"Cavs completely fell apart whenever LeBron sat, which Cp3 would fix. Just look at this insane stat   ""In 46 minutes with LeBron on the floor, the Cavaliers outscored the Warriors by seven points. In the two minutes he spent on the bench, Golden State ran off 12 points. That means James finished the night +7 and his team still lost by five""  https://www.sbnation.com/2017/6/8/15761986/lebron-james-plus-minus-cavs-vs-warriors-game-3-nba-finals"
"The new guys are just as competitive as the old guys, they just express themselves differently. Same bs that Barkley and other old heads said about Lebron James, yes they questioned how competitive lebron was, in 10 years this take will look equally stupid."
"Probably not, just think about the players that were on that Golden State team that year. Prime Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, a great defensive year Klay Thompson, Andre Iguadala before he got old, Draymond Green, Clyde Drexler, rookie Michael Jordan, James Naismith's ghost, 2 clones of LeBron, dream team Christian Laettner, and the football player from The Last Boy Scout that pulls out a gun on the field. I just don't see CP3 making a huge difference that series."
"Some players like Chris Paul are predominantly multiplier players. Others like Kyrie (and probably Booker at this point in his career) are excellent additive players.   Every now and then you get a Lebron James, Michael Jordan who are damn good at both and can single handedly carry team. In my eyes 2021 James Harden or Nicholas Jokic come close too.  Chris Paul is probably the best multiplier in the game even as he ages. However no doubt if he didn't already have excellent teammates like Booker to help multiply, theres no way the sun's will be doing so well. To me it's just a great media narrative around a redemption arc that happens to be the perfect piece to unlock potential."
Also imagine that your friend is actually LeBron James and you want to show him something funny on reddit and he sees your username.
Yes. CP3 is pretty much a midget LeBron James. I promise you that.
Frank Underwood scene?   Lebron James the nba Frank Underwood?
"To be fair, if someone is taking scientific health advice as serious as vaccines from Lebron James they're probably looking for a reason to support their bias in the first place."
Mario Hezonja‚Äôs game-winning block on Lebron James.
What? We're in an NBA subreddit and specifically a thread about NBA and Covid/vaccines. Why would we discuss about people in the medical field on r/NBA instead of LeBron fuckin' James lol
Unless your name is Lebron James being a lock for 1st team is really fucking hard. Also Curry being injury prone and not being in the MVP discussion got him out of 1st team in 2017 because he was still the best PG in the league but it would be dumb to not have the MVP and runner up on the 1st team.
"I see comments about James Jones GM, is this the same James Jones NBA player who followed lebron everywhere he went??"
"A few months ago Nick Wright was saying there's only 4 players that can guarantee a playoff berth: Lebron, KD, Kawhi and James Harden. Chris Paul is also a guaranteed playoff berth too imo."
Wait it's that James Jones that was on the Lebron teams just riding the bench for a few years and getting rings?
"what kind of question is this? Harden is top 2 floor raiser in this generation .. and one of the best in history.   The only person arguably better than him in this generation is Lebron James and even Bron couldn‚Äôt take the lakers to the playoffs before AD came along.   Harden led teams has never missed the playoffs, and he was the entire engine during Houston‚Äôs days and he never had a stable in their prime super star for co star.   Don‚Äôt think CP3 has ever brought much success without a in his prime co star. In fact, he has never done much in the playoffs even with a superstar costar. But I will give him props for elevating the Suns"
LeBron Raymone James
Is LeBron James even a top 5 player? I didn't watch him play today so I need a reminder.
Y‚Äôall can down vote but if LA were missing Lebron James people would say their best player was literally injured and that why they lost. Raptors were a fluke and will drift back into irrelevancy
Having LeBron James on your team might help a little bit too.
"&gt; LeBron fucking James had to campaign the league offices to get respect from the refs  Please tell me this isn't in reference to the letter sent during the bubble playoffs, because if so lol. That was the dumbest letter given the context of what games it was in response to. Lebron was getting calls left and right but arguably missed one and felt the need go to silver with, it was so stupid."
"Disagree with him being the best player in the game. If I had the option to plug in Lebron or KD on say, the lowly wolves, I would take Lebron 10 out of 10 times. He is the ultimate floor raiser who can elevate a basement team to playoff and even championship contention. I would not trust KD do the same thing.   Put Lebron on the nets or warriors super teams instead of KD, and what do you think would happen? Similar results. I would have also trusted Lebron to not relinquish a 3-1 lead over that warriors team ala OKC.  KD as clear number 2 though. Rounding out my top 5 is James harden, curry, and Kawhi."
I don't care what anyone says KD is the best player in basketball when healthy. He took the throne once he joined GSW.  Players around the league seem to respect him more than LeBron. Look at all the players demanding to join him on the buyout market. Harden joined him.  James Wiseman said KD is his mentor.    KD runs the league now.
"It's a difference in the sports though, not how the NBA is operating.  NBA has more distilled talent - five starters, 9 in a rotation, 15 on the roster.  Take it a step further - why don't people complain that there have only been three tennis players ranked #1 for like two decades now?   It's really hard to have parity when the sport is more individual.  This is nothing new in the NBA, christ the Lakers and Celtics won everything forever.  There's nothing you can really do to mitigate the fact that LeBron James being on a team makes it a virtual certainty the team will be in the Finals."
"Y‚Äôall really think it‚Äôs som conspiracy, huh? LeBron fucking James had to campaign the league offices to get respect from the refs and y‚Äôall think they don‚Äôt call fouls for Jokic because he‚Äôs not marketable or something?"
"Kyrie proved that take against the Bulls the other night. I know harden,  kd, and I think DeAndre Jordan too, were out but the rest of the nets aren‚Äôt total bums. Kyrie put up some big numbers but in the end a loss is a loss.   Also the only time Kyrie really has a ‚Äúwinning pedigree‚Äù is with LeBron James on his team who is the modern day GOAT so I totally buy that take."
"""LEBRON JAMES WITH THE ERECTION!"""
TJ McConnell is in fact the greatest NBA player of all time. Greater than Michael Jordan. Greater than LeBron James. Greater than Thaddeus Young.
"This is just a plain stupid take.   Our rotation was:  **Starters:** George Hill, JR Smith, LeBron James, Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson.   **Bench:** Jordan Clarkson, Kyle Korver, Rodney Hood, Jeff Green, Larry Nance Jr.   And then the three guys to round out our roster were Jose Calderon, Cedi Osman and Ante Zizic.  Please enlighten me; what about this roster screams *great team*?"
Kevin durant and 4 mugsy bogues would beat a team of lebron james and 4 mugsy Bogues in a best of 7 series.
"Meanwhile lebron James the face of the nba isn‚Äôt getting vaccinated, what a nice example for his millions of fans."
"This year Lamelo has been:  1. The youngest player to record a triple double.  2. The youngest player to make 7 threes in a game.  3. One of three rookies to make 7 threes and dish 10 assists in a game  4. Only rookie in the last 60 years to lead all rookies in points, rebounds, assists, and steals heading into the all-star break.  5. One of three NBA players age 20 or younger to have multiple 20/10/5 games (the other two being Lebron James and Luka Doncic).  6. One of three rookies to record 7 threes and 10 assists in a game (the other two being Steph Curry and Jason Kid).  7. One of two rookies to average 15/5/5 and 2 threes (the other rookie being Luka Doncic).  8. Per 36, one of two rookies to post 18/6/6 for a season (the other being a Oscar Robertson; less impressive if he doesn‚Äôt play again this year).  That is literally the definition of historic.  Before he went down he was the prohibitive favorite to win ROY. Sports media regularly said at the point he went down that it was his to lose.   [This article does a pretty good job putting his season into perspective](https://www.google.com/amp/s/fansided.com/2021/03/03/nylon-calculus-comparing-lamelo-ball-greatest-nba-rookies-ever/amp/)  Games missed going to be his biggest black mark, but with an injury unlikely to inhibit his growth going forward and how he was head and shoulders better than every other rookie, in the eyes of many a stat nerd he‚Äôs done enough to be deserving of ROY. Don‚Äôt think he gets it but we all know who the best rookie this year was."
"I think lamelo passes better than doncic he‚Äôs also a winner something Luka didn‚Äôt do as a rookie.  Kyrie has outplayed Steph in every series they‚Äôve ever played in and hit the greatest shot in nba finals history in stephs face, and dominated him the entire series. Kyrie is currently at the age Steph was when he started winning mvps so he‚Äôs just now hitting his prime. A ‚Äúmvp‚Äù really only matters to geeks who are to into numbers Steph has never been better than or ‚Äúmore valuable ‚Äú than lebron James so it‚Äôs just a piece of hardware. I‚Äôm also taking into my anticipation how rough these next couple years will be for the warriors. I see consecutive first round exits even with klay back.

It's weird.
You can if it's LeBron Fucking James and you won the series.
"it goes beyond his tenure in Boston, I hated him on the Cavs as well.  He's the most overrated player in the NBA and has done literally nothing without LeBron James to piggy-back off of (and soon to be James Harden &amp; KD), yet he gets treated like a god because he has sick handles, a signature shoe &amp; hit a heavily contested 3 in Steph's grill.  Add to that all of his anti-science, conspiracy theory bullshit, the fake-sharp/tortured artist act and it's just overwhelming.  I'd sooner root for Eli Manning or Derek Jeter than Kyrie"
what has Kyrie ever done without LeBron James?
"Kyrie is better at playing with LeBron James &amp; James Harden than Dame is, but Dame is better at just about everything else."
"Just prior to lebrons injury:  &gt;	Big man Anthony Davis has been out a month now, yet there the Lakers sit atop the league in defensive efficiency (106.0), a sizable edge over Philadelphia (108) and Utah (108.3). And there‚Äôs James, leading all players in defensive win shares (0.183) by an equally impressive margin. The 36-year-old future Hall of Famer has a defensive field goal percentage of 40.6% compared to the 46% they normally shoot. That 5.4% difference ranks seventh among players who have logged at least 30 games and face 9.5 shots or more per game. And that makes James the top-ranked non-center. *NBA.com*  LeBron also ranks 6th in defensive win shares, where as Jokic ranks 151st."
LeBron James   Paul Pierce   Vince Carter but people are mixed nowadays
"The NBA, Microsoft, and China have conspired to put behavioral modifiers into the Covid-19 vaccines given out by Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson &amp; Johnson. The chip is injected into you with your vaccine.  Since getting vaccinated, I have already ordered 10 LeBron James jerseys, bought an XBOX, and now eat Panda Express for every meal."

I'd say it's LeBron James because he's arguably the most impactful player in the history of the NBA
"Does the ball change size or weight in the finals?  The rim?  Players can‚Äôt control injury or where/when they face their opponents.   Didn‚Äôt everyone expect the ‚Äòreal‚Äô finals to be the western conference finals last year?  If Jordan had made it to the finals earlier and had to play competition equal to the Celtics and pistons of those years, he would have lost in the finals those years.   It‚Äôs possible to be the second best team in the league, face the best team in the league in the first round and lose. The second best team in the league can possibly lose in the first round.   Stop over-weighing the finals.  It is just as important to win any playoff series as it is the finals - either way you go home losers if you don‚Äôt win the series  Want to REALLY compare Lebron vs MJ?   Here you go:  Michael Jordan: 30-7 playoff series record Lebron James: 40-10 playoff series record  One is 4.29/1 win/loss ratio the other is 4/1. Pretty damn close."
Lebron James is the Michael Jordan of acting.
Feels kinda wrong coming from a [CLE] LeBron James flair though...
"This is exactly what I‚Äôve been saying all year.   LeBron James in my mind is the GoAT, but even he‚Äôs not gonna win any games if you give him a team full of fifth graders. You can‚Äôt judge an individual on their merits when they have this kinda trash around them. Steph‚Äôs amazing, and putting up historic numbers, but with this team, of course his ceiling‚Äôs gonna be limited."
April 17th vs UTA for Anthony Davis. Either April 30th vs SAC or May 2nd vs TOR for LeBron James.
"Volume &gt;&gt; Efficiency when it comes to ROY. Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Wiggins, MCW all won ROY with below average efficiency. Edwards is improving and at his pace, yeah he will still win ROTY based off of how the award is historically."
"Brandon Ingram hasn't played a single season of winning basketball and has struggled to fit alongside elite talents in Lebron James and Zion. He is a ball stopper, a poor defender and doesn't make his teammates better.  There are countless prospects I would rather build around than him."
"&gt;When Iguodala was in the game, LeBron James shot 38.1 percent from the field, scoring 26 points per 36 minutes with 2.9 turnovers.  &gt;On shots contested by Iguodala, James is shooting 24 percent from the field. On shots contested by anyone else, James is shooting 41 percent.  shit i'd brag"
"People love to tout accomplishments of players when they're playing, but the first and most important ability is availability.  Steph and especially KD are not durable players.  The Warriors lost the 2019 NBA Finals primarily because their best player, Kevin Durant, got injured in game 1.  The Nets were a 7-seed in 2020 because their best player, Kevin Durant, was out for the whole season.  The 2015 Oklahoma City Thunder missed the playoffs because their best player, Kevin Durant, was injured for most of the season.  In the 2016 playoffs Steph Curry's play regressed a fair amount from his regular season MVP performance - rolling his ankle and being injured for 6 playoff games likely didn't do him any favors.  James Harden has **never** had a significant injury - I was legitimately shocked to see the news that Harden will be out for at least 10 days with a hamstring injury.  I would bet that if the playoffs were today, Harden would play through it.  But I cannot remember a time where Harden had to miss more than a week because of injury.  Sure, when they play at full health, Durant and Curry may be better than Harden.  But the only player in the past 10 years anyone can argue is anywhere near as durable as Harden is Lebron.  Doesn't this count for something?"
"Awesome post dude, really like how you addressed the issues with the stat while also making key observations about how to read the data.  Really cool to see that this does absolutely establish how Curry's impact on the Warriors this season.       Hopefully you don't mind but I decided to post this ranked table for total differential.        |Rank|Team|Player|Total Differential| --:|:--|:--|--:| |1|Golden State Warriors|Stephen Curry|**17.6**| |2|LA Lakers|LeBron James|**15.2**| |3|Philadelphia 76ers|Joel Embiid|**14.7**| |4|Utah Jazz|Rudy Gobert|**14.4**| |5|Milwaukee Bucks|Giannis Antetokounmpo|**12.2**| |6|LA Clippers|Paul George|**11.0**| |7|LA Clippers|Kawhi Leonard|**10.7**| |8|Minnesota Timberwolves|Karl-Anthony Towns|**10.7**| |9|Brooklyn Nets|Kevin Durant|**9.8**| |10|Denver Nuggets|Nikola Jokic|**9.8**| |11|Miami Heat|Jimmy Butler|**9.5**| |12|LA Lakers|Anthony Davis|**8.4**| |13|Atlanta Hawks|Trae Young|**8.1**| |14|Houston Rockets|Christian Wood|**7.9**| |15|Toronto Raptors|Pascal Siakam|**7.9**| |16|Detroit Pistons|Jerami Grant|**7.8**| |17|Brooklyn Nets|Kyrie Irving|**7.5**| |18|Boston Celtics|Jason Tatum|**7.4**| |19|Miami Heat|Bam Adebayo|**6.6**| |20|New York Knicks|Julius Randle|**6.1**| |21|Dallas Mavericks|Luka Doncic|**6.0**|"
"Superstars usually do. Lebron James bullies jrue and so has other top stars. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre superstars, usually no top defense can do much."
"What does Ayesha Curry‚Äôs following have anything to do with this? LeBrons Wife has 7 million followers less than Ayesha, and that has literally no bearing on if LeBron James is more/less of a household name than Curry.   Giannis plays for the Milwaukee Bucks has had the highest tv ratings it‚Äôs had in 20 years, i wonder why?? and that was the fourth highest average tv ratings in 2020. so, yes Giannis has significantly elevated the viewership of the Milwaukee games"

"I mean, if you‚Äôre looking for the 5th best guy on a team he does fit that role better than Trae. That doesn‚Äôt really qualify him as a better player. Klay Thompson isn‚Äôt better than LeBron James because he fits better off ball with Curry."
Fox is a godly finisher for a guard. He‚Äôs shooting 75% from 0-3 feet as a 6‚Äô3 guard. That‚Äôs a number that you‚Äôd see from prime LeBron James.
"1 and 2 are Number 24 Kobe and Number 8 Kobe. Then in no particular order Damian Lillard, Allan Iverson, Tracy McGrady, LeBron James, Tim Duncan, Dwyane Wade, Arvydas Sabonis, and Spud Webb."
"The only realistic dark horse I could see is if Luka keeps this hot streak up and somehow gets a top 3 seed. Outside of that, I don‚Äôt possibly see MVP going to someone not naked Giannis, James Harden, or my favorite to win it, Jokic. LeBron and Embiid missed too many games, and I don‚Äôt see the blazers winning enough games or Lillard having an impressive enough season to warrant winning as a lower seed."
Acquire Lebron James

"Lebron James and Rondo couldn‚Äôt make the playoffs, or even play above .500 ball, so no reason to think they are some unstoppable force"
i know the leagues are fucked up with their treatment of criminals but cmon.  it could have been Lebron fucking James who did this and he would be out of the league in a minute. This is so far beyond the limit of what anyone would be ok with with the video and picture evidence.
"We also had Ingram, Kuzma, Lonzo, Rondo, KCP, and Lance. But I guess it‚Äôs your opinion.  Again, you do realize this is LeBron James right?"
Lakers in 6. LeBron James.  How are they ‚Äúain‚Äôt gonna cut it‚Äù lmfao
"&gt;Who tf is guarding Jokic?   Tyson Chandler, JaVale McGee, and Zubac. Lol.  &gt;who had one of the best playoffs that year?   You do understand who LeBron James is right? And you know this would be exactly one year after his legendary 2018 run?  &gt;Who tf is guarding Murray who averaged 24 that playoffs?  Lonzo/KCP/Rondo  &gt;Prime Gary Harris? A decent Millsap? Prime Will Barton?  Aight."
yeah so a rookie team that never made the playoffs before is beating LeBron James &amp; Rondo in the playoffs. Got it
"who was Karl Malone competing against for first-team All-NBA honors in the 90s?  Barkley?  Shawn Kemp?  Larry Johnson?  Barkley is an all-timer but after that it gets pretty thin, whereas Dirk was competing against KG, Duncan, LeBron James, Chris Webber, Jermaine O'Neal and more.  And again, even if you think Malone is ahead of Dirk (we disagree on this, obviously), there's zero argument for Karl Malone over Moses, Jerry West or Oscar."

Bias &gt; cause to feel or show inclination or prejudice for or against someone or something  You have an inclination for Michael Jordan over LeBron James, therefore you are biased."
LeBron James could have the Julia Roberts* movie cover tatted on him and I wouldn't bat an eye. He is max level corny.
"Ahh yes. When I think leadership I think Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, Chris Paul, Udonis Haslem. Lol. Whhattbout whattabbout whattabout. Don't turn this about what you think about me, the subject is UD being an unnecessary part of the team and full time hanger on at this point in his career."
"Woah no way, are you trying to say Lebron James, the 2nd best player all time, is better than Jimmy?!!?? Wild take dude. Jimmy still did more than most other player in the NBA could dream to do against Lebrons team"
"Average height for a male is 5'8""  Steph Curry : 6'3""  Lebron James: 6'9""  There's a larger difference between Steph and the average guy than between Steph and Lebron"
"&gt;I know it exists because Lakers hate supersedes logic  Oh yes, woe is me, the victimized Lakers fan.   &gt;It amuses me and makes me laugh.  I mean, yes, that tends to happens when something amuses you. What's amusing is just taking a look at the preseason posts about how the Lakers supporting cast was so much better than what he got in CLE, yet ya'll failed to make the playoffs with Lebron fuckin James.  Complain more about injuries; a lot of good teams were injured. Harden didn't have CP3 and Capela for like half a season and still carried that team out with his 50+ point games.   Laker fans always have an excuse for everything. But keep going. As you said, it's amusing and it makes me laugh."

"He does need the ball.   He was awful off ball with lebron James and he wasn‚Äôt off ball last year, your full of shit and don‚Äôt even know your own team. He has the exact same usage rating this year as last year  Ingram just isn‚Äôt super star material. He‚Äôll be an all star level player that puts up counting stats on mediocre to bad teams but that‚Äôs his ceiling. His playstyle and game don‚Äôt fit next to other stars at all. His best bet is to go to a bad team, be there main offensive weapon and let them build a team around him to chuck and handle the ball. They‚Äôll be a 30-40 win team and maybe a first round exit every once in awhile"
"The video? Let me see if I can find it. It was posted not too long ago, but it's in a comment chain.

"He's a washed undersized shooter, not LeBron James. You don't get to demand championship destination that's close to home when the organization don't owe you shit (it's not like he had a legacy on the Pels). JJ took that bloated overpay of an contract with them two years ago eyes wide open, don't be playing the victim now when the team discarded you like a washed piece that you are.  Shut up."
"Don't try and mince it, Jerry West has 1 FMVP and 1 Ring while playing as a Laker  LeBron James has 1 FMVP and 1 Ring as a Laker.  Plus Jerry West literally had years coaching and being a GM with the Lakers.  So the same accolades except LeBron was a Laker for less and had nothing to do with their FO."
&gt;Buss seems to be talking about on court play/resume   Jeanie's list  * Kobe Bryant * Kareem Abdul-Jabbar * LeBron James * Magic Johnson * Phil Jackson  Jerry West led the Lakers to 9 Finals appearances and a Championship as a player.  He should have made the list just for his playing days alone.  Jeanie's list wasn't exclusive to players though.  She put Phil Jackson on her list.
"God, Lakers history is so nuts. Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James both won finals MVP as Lakers, and you can make a strong case neither is a top five Laker. Lakers fans are so spoiled lol."
"Ah now you‚Äôre backpedaling. Instead of saying his BBIQ couldn‚Äôt improve its now, ‚Äúhe was 99 out of 100 coming into the league‚Äù.   And you‚Äôre still wrong. Lebron James‚Äô BBIQ has definitely increased over the years. A large amount even. This shouldn‚Äôt even be a debate honestly. aNd tHe fAcT tHaT yOu dOnT rEaLiZe tHat TelLs mE aLl I nEeD tO kNoW."
"&gt;Kobe Bryant still owns the city of Los Angeles, as he should. At the hundreds of souvenir shops on the Venice Beach promenade, Bryant posters and T-shirts were everywhere, while LeBron James‚Äô stuff was hard to come by.  LA knows whats good"

"why even stick LeBron there? To make him happy with staying with the franchise, obvious sucking up to King James by Jeanie Buss, cannot really blame her but maybe LeBron does become a top 5 if he brings home a few more titles."
"""LeBron JaMes"""
Sure thing. Kevin Love and LeBron James ^Jr
Looks like he changed his tune a couple years later. https://sports.yahoo.com/lebron-james-wants-play-tournament-203700119.html
To LeBron James for his outstanding advocation for Chinese slave labor
"""Uyghurs don't buy sneakers."" -LeBron James probably"
But ad hasn‚Äôt overtaken lebron yet and no if the lakers get more help it doesn‚Äôt just make the ring for shits and giggles lol. The nba is an arms race. Bkn just added James harden to kd and kyrie. Lebron doesn‚Äôt get to not add help just cause he‚Äôs lebron. He needs to be the best player for all the rings though for sure.
Only behind Giannis? Since when? James Harden and Giannis were in the running from what I remember while LeBron creates narratives that he somehow deserves to also be part of the conversation.
All we know is that LeBron is clearly behind MJ and Kareem‚Äôs level. He may even be behind Magic in terms of being a winner. Looks like the LeBron ‚Äúfather of the superteam cutlure‚Äù James is really not built different. Now he‚Äôs begging for a bubble set-up.
Bro lottery aint gonna solve the problems for you unless you draft another lebron james. Small market small city with shitty front office.
"All-NBA 1st Team  C: Nikola Jokic  F: Joel Embiid  F: Giannis Antetokounmpo  G: Luka Doncic  G: Steph Curry  All-NBA 2nd Team  C: Rudy Gobert  F: Julius Randle  F: Zion Williamson  G: Damian Lillard  G: Chris Paul  All-NBA 3rd Team  C: Bam Adebayo  F: Kawhi Leonard  F: LeBron James  G: Jimmy Butler  G: Paul George  &amp;#x200B;  Notable Snubs:  Tatum, Westbrook, KAT, Harden, Trae, Booker, Beal, Jaylen, Mitchell, Lavine, Kyrie."
"Exactly, people saying Harden &gt; KD don't appreciate that a player's post season performances are several factors of importance greater than their regular season performances. Harden has shown on several occasions that when the pressure is at its greatest, like elimination games 'win or go home' scenarios, he has wilted. KD has been dominant in the Finals and there is no greater stage than that. Dude has averaged 32/8/5 across three Finals series on 55/43/90 shooting splits which is a ridiculous 67% true shooting. If I ask you to show me modern players with better career Finals numbers, the only names you are going to mention are Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Shaq. And these people are going to pick Harden over him? Crazy."
"Do OKC fans regret drafting Harden over Steph? Or Clippers fans regret drafting Blake over two top 25 all time players? I don't think so. In the end, there's only so much you can do when scouting talent and developing players. Had Lebron never left the Cavs and Denver somehow got into their streak of drafting amazing players with mid 1st round and 2nd round picks a few years earlier, we could be discussing how letting *""3 time MVP, 5 time finals MVP Carmelo Anthony""* fall to 3rd was a huge mistake for Detroit, but Cleveland wouldn't exactly be laughed at hysterically for picking a multiple time MVP in James themselves."
"This is absurd.  If you put James Harden into Lebrons career, I can confidently say Harden will no way achieve the same level of success as Lebron had, not even close.  Now if we put Lebron in the Thunders with KD, Westbrook.... oh boy, that‚Äôs rings right there."
Luka creates more point per possession than Trae this year. And the Ast/TOs ratio is not all that define a playmaker and it is not too far by the two!  Last year when Trae had better stats was worst than Luka as overall creation so I assume this year is the same. That's the article about that: https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/1/24/21079412/points-creation-giannis-antetokounmpo-luka-doncic-lebron-james  From last year I think Harden and Jokic have improved in playmaking and also Steph would be in the mix. Last year Trea was 5th by Points created so this year he should be top 7 as I said.
"This is awkward, but he was okay for it last year.   https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/trail-blazers/lebron-james-whines-about-play-year-after-championing-it"
That is incorrect. https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2765841-lebron-james-on-idea-of-nba-play-in-tournament-thats-corny-thats-wack
"Lebron was always against the play-in tournament.  &gt;""That's wack. That's wack. Why? You got to earn your spot to be in the postseason. No consolation for finishing last. That's corny. That's corny. That's wack. To play for what? What are they playing for?""  &gt;[Make the playoffs by winning the tournament]  &gt;""Even if my record is better than yours? Nah, that's wack,"" he said.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2765841-lebron-james-on-idea-of-nba-play-in-tournament-thats-corny-thats-wack"
"I wouldnt say Curry is the second best player in the league in general though. Although he is definitely an interchangeable Top 5. For me, it would be:   1-Lebron  2-KD  3-Giannis   4- Kawhi Leonard  5- James Harden  My reasoning for why I put KD as second is because he has always been second to Lebron for his entire career. At KD‚Äôs full health you can even debate that he‚Äôs better than Lebron( I dont think that, but people do and thats their opinion), but I see it like this. You have Lebron James and Kevin Durant right next to each other on the same pedestal , and then there‚Äôs everyone else below them. They‚Äôre that dominant.  Now on my list, I put James Harden and snubbed Curry. This is the part where the two are switchable because they are so similar in effectiveness, that you wouldn‚Äôt be wrong to choose one over the other. I got Harden, but I think 80% of people would take Curry over Harden."
Because the best players from around the world come to play here. You‚Äôll never see a lebron James playing for Barcelona because he wants to compete against the best
"&gt;aren't given the right to draft players on a fair playing field  You do realize no one has to be drafted right? LeBron James didn't have to go to the NBA if another team in a foreign league would pay him more money  There literally wouldn't be a draft if the sport was as popular anywhere else. The reason there is no salary cap in international soccer is because there are so many pro leagues, that if one installed a draft and cap, the players would just jump to a league without drafts and caps"
You know Michael Jordan? LeBron James? Now think of fusion.
"&gt;Los Angeles star      Oh, *that* Lebron James"
"KD doesnt impact the game like Giannis or Harden does anymore. You can put Harden or Giannis on any team and they would instantly be in playoff contention. Cant say the same for KD. Nets have been below average in games with KD and no James Harden this year. KDs obviously the best pure scorer of the bunch, but he doesnt impact the game in nearly as many ways. Current KD does not do enough on the floor to be put on the same level as guys like Steph, Giannis, Harden, or Lebron."
"Kyle ""LeBron James"" Kuzma"
Bill Laimbeer &amp; Lebron James
"A cieling is not meant to be an unrealistic goal, it is meant as a likely cap as to who the player will end up being at his very best.  Why would you speculate on how good someone will be if the answer is always Michael Jordan or Lebron James?  It's pointless if that's your criteria for ceiling.  No shaq met and probably exceeded his ceiling.  Not everyone's ceiling is the greatest player of all time, thats an idiots take."
But if that‚Äôs the case then we‚Äôd have to say Lebron has been point guard his whole career too which isn‚Äôt the case. They both play like it and sometimes are listed as such but James is listed as SG majority of his career and Bron is a SF for his.
lebron james and steph curry as the 7 and 8 seeds is extremely funny. western conference baby
How so please don't tell me you think James harden has preformed better than LeBron in the playoffs.
"LeBron James is on this list. He is ranked 18th, you must have just missed his name.   Anthony Davis was probably left off for having too low a sample size. I can see that no listed player has played fewer than 40 games played - AD has only played 36 this season. Either that or he didn't make top 50, which is entirely possible. All of those listed are pretty good clutch shooters - Jimmy Butler was only the last guy to make it!"
"Your original point was that Harden has had it tougher in the West. LeBron came to the west and fuckin beat James Harden. Beat this year‚Äôs MVP too. You can add all the asterisks you want but it is what it is man. LeBron is the better playoff performer and the better overall player and always has been. That‚Äôs not a knock on Harden, just respect for LeBron."
I like what Scalabrine‚Äôs said to some dude that thought he could beat him 1 on 1 ;  I‚Äôm closer to LeBron James than you are to me!
Raise your hand if you‚Äôve been personally victimized by Lebron James.

"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine  As well as front court players like:  -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  This was from a week ago so even if he's eclipsed some of these players since then, the point still stands."
"Steph Curry is the only person I put up there with him. They are 1a &amp; 1b to me for complete offensive players, I put Steph ahead, but I don‚Äôt fault anyone who has James as their #1  Maybe the Big O is up there?  And then my next question is exactly how good was MJ‚Äôs passing as someone who didn‚Äôt get to see him play life a lot?  Edit: Kobe &amp; LeBron obvious thoughts as well, but I could see the argument they are both ‚Äúdeficient‚Äù at one of the two criteria here...  It‚Äôs an interesting thought for sure"
"Wow I feel emasculated and utterly humiliated now. I'll be more careful when mildly trash talking a rival team online, or else a sensitive onlooker might remind me that Lebron James joined my favorite team and led us to a championship"
Mike James could have a team of a LeBron Kd Jordan Hakeem and he‚Äôd still shoot it like he‚Äôs the superstar.   My goat tbh.
"I can't help but chuckle when writers list the team, as if there's another Lebron James they could be talking about, so they need to specify lol"
"You still don't understand.  It's OK your IQ is something that doesn't go up or down much once you've hit a certain age, usually by the time you hit adulthood.  IQ is not your specific knowledge of a subject but rather your intuitive understanding of the world around you.    IQ tests measure your ability to recognize complex patterns and your ability to use logic to figure out what comes next.  It does not test your ability to memorize world capitals.  Similarly BBIQ is a measure of your ability to understand what is happening in the game around you, what the offense is trying to do to score on you/ how the defence is trying to stop you from scoring.    Lebron james played basketball for a decade before coming into the NBA and had a full understanding of how the game of basketball is played.  His intuition for the game was off the charts and this was one of his many highlights on his draft report.  He was a basketball genius, much like Chris Paul, before he came into the league.    What he learned in the NBA was NBA specific and had nothing to do with his understanding of basketball but rather his understanding of the physical freakish attributes of his NBA opponents.  This is a learning process that every single NBA player must go through and has nothing to do with BBiQ.  If you don't understand how this is different from BBIQ I can't help you.pp"
I like how ‚ÄúLos Angeles Lakers Star‚Äù had to be added. Because we needed to make sure it was *that* Lebron James
Lebron James.
One Lebron James. You do realize he was anchoring the #1 defense in the league with no AD for majority of the season? Can you tell us about the block in 2016 Skip?
"magic dwight is like cavs lebron. they were both by the far the best on their team with the 2nd and so forth bests not being even close.  lakers dwight is like heat lebron. they both had some great teammates, lakers dwight unfortunately didn't last very long though.  lebron got MVP with his nobody Cav's and his somebody Heat's. so im not really sure what wade and bosh have to do with it. Howard has had kobe as a teammate and james harden. not at the same time obviously but if LBJ had those as teammates then everyone would call it a superteam. yet with howard i guess they a bunch of schmucks. lets just be real there are superteams and then there are teams that have LBJ. thats not me sucking his D but pointing out there just arent many teams that LBJ can go to where it wouldn't be called a superteam so may as well just call it a team that has LBJ."
"I feel like there would be all kinds of ripple effects. It might be a less coveted award overall when you're giving it to Tony Parker while LeBron James is on an all-time run with the Miami Heat. Take today's ""we all know LeBron is the best player but we have to give it to someone else"" conversation and multiply that by ten. It would make the MVP seem like a side show when an all-timer isn't qualified.  It might turn into an award just to reward a good, consistent enough veteran that everyone likes but never got a championship."
"One major thing you missed is that a significant portion of superstar ""moves"" aren't free agency signings, but trade requests to big market title contenders. Paul George is only on the Clippers because Kawhi Leonard would only sign with LAC if they made the trade. Anthony Davis is only on the Lakers because he requested a trade from the Pelicans and refused to sign an extension anywhere else, effectively forcing himself to the Lakers. It's ""pre-agency"", not free agency for a lot of superstars.  In addition, it typically isn't the front office that deserves the credit for superstar free agency signings. LeBron James only joined the Lakers because they were in LA - they were the worst team in the league the previous 5 years, seemed mismanaged, and even failed to make the playoffs his first year there.  Conversely, when's the last time a superstar free agent signed to a small market team? LaMarcus Aldridge with the Spurs in 2015? There's significantly less ""skill"" involved in signing superstar free agents compared to the ""luck"" of working in a big market. Respectfully to the Nets, who put up solid teams the past few years - they only got KD and Kyrie because the only other big market team with cap space was the Knicks, who at the time were considered by everyone to be ""lolknicks"". They got James Harden because their only competition was Philly.  **It's hard to feel like those kinds of super teams are ""earned""**. It feels much more special when a 2011 Mavs team wins a ring, or the 2012 Thunder make the Finals with a core of KD-Westbrook-Harden-Ibaka that they drafted. When a team ""lucks"" their way into a super team, opposing fans will complain and discount their success (maybe out of envy?)."
But that Miami team without LeBron James isn't THAT good.  They had zero depth behind the big 3.  Bosh and Wade with Haslem and Ilgauskas is a decent team but they don't make the finals without LBJ.   The Warriors are still a championship team without KD though.
"The Raptors were not the joke of the NBA. This wasn‚Äôt the Bargnani days, Kyle and DeMar had led the Raptors to top seeds for 5 years in a row before Kawhi even got traded. They weren‚Äôt the joke of the NBA, even if you want to say that LeBronto was the reason, there‚Äôs no shame in losing to prime LeBron James.  Just want to point out that since 2013-2014, the Raps were a top 4 seed 7 times and missed the playoffs once (this year playing in Florida). In that same time frame, the Lakers made the playoffs twice (if they win the play-in that is) and had a 17-65 season. I feel like those Raptors teams were definitely less of a joke pre-Kawhi than those Lakers teams were pre-LeBron."

"In a *century* might be overselling it.  Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and Kareem have existed, and I'm sure others will want to throw in Kobe, Magic, or Bird."
The Lakers only got LeBron James because they signed him in the off-season.
* Skip probably has his wife call him Lebron during sex * Skip probably reads Lebron texts on the toilet * Skip probably goes to sleep with the Lebron mediation on the Calm App * Skip probably wears Lebron Jammies to bed * Skip probably dresses up as Lebron for Halloween and pretends to hate it * Skip probably has a pet turtle called Sir James
It's ridiculous that you guys have Lebron James and still didn't do shit this postseason.
When he was going head to head with lebron james in the ecf?
The man has taken LeBron james in his prime to 7 games lmao
"&gt;KD is fucking amazing but there‚Äôs no way he could have 4 games of the type he had yesterday in a single series.  I've seem my teams die to lebron James in the playoffs too many times to buy that one, sorry lol."
"Ben‚Äôs kit is so strange. A 6‚Äô11 PG with elite vision yet lacks the shooting touch or ability to make FTs like a guard. Has the strength and athleticism of Lebron James, yet can‚Äôt finish inside like a forward. What do you do with a player like that? Can‚Äôt play him at guard‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt play him at forward."
"Ben‚Äôs kit is so strange. As much as he‚Äôs a mismatch for other teams, he‚Äôs also so exploitable. A 6‚Äô11 PG with elite vision yet lacks the shooting touch or ability to make FTs like a guard. Has the strength and athleticism of Lebron James, yet can‚Äôt finish inside unless he‚Äôs got an open lane. What do you do with a player like that? Can‚Äôt play him at guard‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt play him at forward."
Why isn't Lebron James pronounced Lebron Jim
You mean the guy who basically only lost to Lebron fucking james?
The lebron James special
"with lebron out, someone has to get the King James treatment"
"We need RDCworld to make an updated Doc Rivers rant, this time with the Sixers  ""Ben Simmons, you trash. If I ever see your name compared to LeBron James again Imma kill somebody"""
"Yes if they had James harden, an mvp, and he was doing all the crunch time work, they would be better than with Tobias Harris.   That‚Äôs my point. KD, lebron, Kawhi don‚Äôt need someone else to take care of crunch time because their post ups don‚Äôt work"
"I'll never forget someone describing him as ""he plays like Lebron James but it's against the 2011 Mavericks"""
Need to take a chill pill bud   Look at any other wing and compare them to the way Lebron James plays then come back to me
Ben Simmons just had a LeBron James against the Mavs moment
Ben about to be the LeBron James of the Beijing Tigers
"Skip: ""Michael Jeffrey Jordan is the greatest angler of all time. If this was LeBron James, he would have caught a tiny sardine instead."""
"You think we like losing in the playoffs? Obviously I'd love to see the bucks win. I'm just saying no Anthony Davis or LeBron James is coming to the bucks, so we have to build our team from the ground up. We can't just suck dick for 5 years like you guys and sign the best player of all time, and get another superstar for dirt cheap just because he only wants to play in Los Angeles."
"Twenty-five year old LeBron James lmao, coming off two consecutive MVPs. That's going to be damn hard to ever top."
"Well, McNuggeroni, you may not have a Lebron James but you do have back to back MVP player that crowned himself the new King of basketball on national television and infront of a 35 year old LBJ .  As far as Davis goes, even if his 2 options were LA or Milwaukee, you guys wouldn't even come close to outbidding us. Hell, you guys couldn't even bid on Ingram if you wanted to. I remember we did that because no one wanted to come play with Bron,  not Kawhi or PG the year before. Some picks work out and some don't but don't blame others for your team having lousy picks.    The culture that you are fine with is off-putting. Yall only value the regular season."
"&gt;It is like you are not thinking things through before posting them.  Okay, let's recap real fast.  &gt;read the box score FFS...  Your rebuttal to someone who you felt didn't watch the game.   &gt;In performance he can be better under the right system.  You claiming he can be better than Lebron and KD if he just had the right system. Any team you build around Giannis would be worse than just swapping him for either of those two.  &gt;Bigs do not need a bag  Lmao spoken like a true casual.  &gt;Giannis is and plays like a championship calliber big  Yet he has never even carried to the ECF and has had better teams than players like Damian Lillard or James Harden had in which they also carried in a more difficult conference.  &gt;Nobody else his size is as skilled in the current league.  This is really where you exposed yourself.  &gt;Most ultra athletic people are not volume scorers from 5ft in.  No amount of bball ref scouring will support your idiotic claims. You are the one reaching and you have not disproven a single claim of mine. All you did was expose yourself as someone who either has no idea what they're saying or someone who is trolling. Either way don't bother replying, I've had my laughs and at this point, it just feels like I'm bullying you so I will stop now. Have a nice one!"
"What's your solution for us then, redfan? We can't get a LeBron James to come to the bucks in free agency lol. And we for sure can't tamper like you guys can to get Anthony Davis to our team. We're playing with the hands we've been dealt, and I'd say we're doing a pretty damn good job"
"And we don't have LeBron James because of injury either lmao but just because he's a fraudulent ""king"""
&gt;	would he be the most coveted free agent ever?   Are you familiar with a guy named LeBron James?
Lebron James
Lebron James was a free agent in his prime.
LeBron James Derangement Syndrome
Bruh what ?   Jamal Murray - WCF   James Harden - 2nd round   Kawhi - 2nd round   Embiid - 2nd round   Lebron and AD - Finals   Brown and Smart - ECF   Conley and Mitchell - First round   Can you spot the trend here ?
"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31646849/los-angeles-lakers-lebron-james-says-predicted-injuries-quick-turnaround-start-season  From the very beginning of training camp in December, James let it be known that he was taken aback by how quickly the league transitioned from the NBA bubble in Orlando, Florida, to a condensed 72-game regular-season schedule as the COVID-19 pandemic persisted.  ""I was like, 'Wow.' And I said, 'Oh, s---,'"" James said on Dec. 7 when asked about his reaction to the quick turnaround. ""Just being completely honest, I wasn't expecting that because early conversations were going on and I was hearing that there would be kind of a mid-January start and training camp would kind of start after Christmas.""  The playoffs have seen the continuation of an unfortunate trend for the NBA during the regular season, when All-Stars missed 370 of a possible 1,944 games (19%), the highest percentage in a season in NBA history, according to Elias Sports Bureau research.  --------------  Also FYI it's like 9 weeks off after the finals end then they go back to work. Like, this is not sustainable. Please, give these guys more rest.   Usually they got like 15 weeks off."
"&gt; Would have been a great co-ROY, I wish they were more open to doing that with these awards.  I was alive the past 2 times it happened (Grant Hill and Jason Kidd, Elton Brand and Steve Francis), but I have no idea how it happened. Was it not based on a vote tally back then? Or did those pairs somehow end up with the exact same vote tally?   I would've been perfectly fine with this year having co-ROY given the special circumstances of the season. Another year I would've been fine with co-ROY would've been Lebron James and Carmelo Anthony. There's probably more examples that I'm not thinking of right now."
"LeBron, Anthony Davis, CP3, Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley, Jamal Murray, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Joel Embiid all either missed playoff games or have played/are still playing injured.  Kawhi now joins the list.  OP: ""Are the Clippers cursed?""  Lol.  No.  There have been many key injuries during these playoffs."
"Talkin' 'bout LeBron ""China"" ""Cop Killer"" ""It's Quittin' Time"" James?"
"Hope you‚Äôre happy Adam Silver. Lebron, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Kyrie, Kawhi, Jamal Murray, CP3, etc. etc.  Just had to rush back didnt ya"
"Just want to add that **Lebron James was in the race for MVP prior to Hill diving into his legs** which he explained as ‚Äúhigh effort‚Äù.  He was not the same after that, but still put up insane numbers. I think the Lakers beat the Suns with a fully healthy Lebron even without AD."
"There was that whole LeBron James thing.   Unless the next generational talent rises from the depths of Lake Minnetonka, we've still got a ways to go."
"Lebron james when he was playing, played without AD, James Harden came to a new offensive in the middle of a season, Conley and Donavan Mitchell share the ball-handling duties, Memphis moves the ball around. How many hawks players missed games?"
"&gt;Because of course no one could understand what it is like to go to the NBA finals 10 straight times but Lebron James, the king of basketball.  He literally didn't even bring up going to the finals lol, you're upset at him for something he didn't say."
"‚ÄúI think when we all sit back and learn from the situation that happened, understand that what you could schedule or could organize (could affect people),‚Äù Adam Silver said. ‚ÄúWe all talk about this freedom of load management. Yes, we all do have freedom to manage loads, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you‚Äôre not thinking about others, and you‚Äôre only thinking about yourself.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get into a word or sentence feud with LeBron James, but I believe he wasn‚Äôt educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke, and so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically. Emotionally. Spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say, and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of load management, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.‚Äù"
"Issue is how he frames it.  If he wrote this as an ‚ÄúI told you so to my fellow NBA players‚Äù it would still be gross, as he is set for life and half the league is not, but he is positioning this like the league/owners forced this upon the players because they are dumb/greedy and don‚Äôt understand basketball injury risk like he does. Because of course no one could understand what it is like to go to the NBA finals 10 straight times but Lebron James, the king of basketball.  It‚Äôs just so lame that he chooses to frame it that way. So, so lame."
"https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/5/24/22452208/lebron-james-taken-covid-19-vaccine-lakers-nba-statement-vaccinated  This, from the same source as linked above, suggests that Lebron was vaccinated. This is from after the comments referenced above..."
"Pfffffffft‚Ä¶  This is classic Lebron James: Hypocrisy combined with intense self-importance.  ‚ÄúThey all didn‚Äôt want to listen to me‚Äù  Oh my gosh dude, really? Lebron is the face of the league and a smart business man. He understands what is on the line financially.  The players didn‚Äôt have to play right away!  Lebron and the rest of his co-workers didn‚Äôt want to give up the money that would have come with that. Now, maybe for Lebron, he was fine with giving up the money and truly didn‚Äôt want to play. Fine.   But don‚Äôt try and blame ‚ÄúThem/They‚Äù, as if it is the owners alone that drove this forward.  The players agreed to play because they wanted the money.  This is dramatic bullshit. Classic Lebron."
"Luka still needs more size/strength. Lose some fat, put on some muscle, get on that Miami Lebron James cycle and he‚Äôll be able to do it."
"LeBron has become a professional complainer, the GOAT for sure in that regard.   Let's put this in relative terms.. nurse's,  doctors, ems, fire, delivery drivers, truck drivers, store clerks, shipping and receiving (  EVERYONE ) have worked huge work loads for the last 18 months, with little to no raise or rest.   Shut the fuck up LeBron James."

"Because the players are not a monolith and a lot of star players (notably Lebron James) didn't want to start the season so soon.  Obviously delaying the season would affect those who aren't stars more, but it's pretty obvious now that a lot of stars are getting serious injuries because of the shortened off-season."
How do you know they were right?  If he reports ‚ÄúSixers interested in a trade for Lebron James‚Äù. Is that false?  It doesn‚Äôt make him trustworthy
"I'm more pissed off about James Harden not making it. LeBron missed a substantial amount of time yet still made all NBA, as did Embiid.  James harden put up 25 8 and 11 on his best  shooting splits and carried the Nets when Durant was injured."
The mental gymnastics that'll be in some of these comments will be crazy because it's LeBron James
1. Michael Air Jordan  2. Lebron King James  3. Kareem Abdul Jabbar  4. Magic Johnson/Kobe Bryant/Larry Bird
The 2015 one cracked me up lol. I have no idea how ‚ÄúJames Harden had 12 turnovers in game 5 when the Rockets were eliminated‚Äù has anything to do with the rest of the reasons on this list lol. The famous air conditioner taking out Lebron might actually take the cake tho
"lmao he's LeBron James, do you actually think the NBPA gives a shit about a no name like him?   Wait"
"I don't see how LeBron James isn't on there. He's won four championships on 3 different teams in one of the most absolutely competitive couple of eras in league history, and has had incredibly durability and the most prolonged ""peak"" of an NBA player ever.   Russell won a lot, in a league of 8 teams. He basically had one opponent, which was Wilt. Russell played in the league he was able to play to, and comparing generations is fool's errand. But, he was basically Ben Wallace.   Jordan, Magic, James, Curry (that's right, I said it)."
"Yep these crazy advanced metrics like ""assists"" üòÇ  That's so fucking stupid it hurts. Having 2 extra assists per game means you created at minimum an extra 4 points for your team, usually by drawing a double team and kicking it out or feeding a cutter.   Creating good looks for teammates is absurdly valuable. Like have you heard of LeBron James? He's not just valuable bc of his scoring.   Rebounds also don't add points to the scoreboard, are you going to argue those aren't important at all? Smh"
"He's been pushing this ""KD is actually the best player alive"" narrative for almost a decade and he's been wrong every time. I love KD, he's a top 15-20 guy EVER. Without question. But he hasn't been the best player alive for a single year of his life because Lebron James was born 4 years before him."
"Lebron James is my guy. Off the court I don't know that's another discussion. But some of the injuries probably don't have anything to do with the shorten season. The Kyrie injury could happen to anyone in that moment. That has nothing to do with the bubble or whatever. Lebrons James ankle injury was a freak accident on a loose ball. How is that related to covid. Kawhis knee was also an unfortunate situation that is not related to covid. The list goes on and on. Point is these injuries would have happened with or without the shorter season. And also, injuries happen EVERY year."
Skip: Boohooo LeBron James. If you were in the playoffs right now you wouldn't be ranting about short season. You'd be celebrating your 5th ring. Go play with your bunny.
That‚Äôs interesting considering he voiced his frustrations [before the season even started](https://nypost.com/2020/11/07/lebron-james-is-not-happy-about-nba-2021-season-start-time/)
Not hindsight when he literally expressed his feelings in the [moment](https://nypost.com/2020/11/07/lebron-james-is-not-happy-about-nba-2021-season-start-time/)

He‚Äôs right but let‚Äôs see how people react considering it‚Äôs Lebron James.
"Who cares what Schroeder said. If you do care, he eventually said LeBron was vaccinated. I'll take the nbas word over his:  https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/5/24/22452208/lebron-james-taken-covid-19-vaccine-lakers-nba-statement-vaccinated"
Anthony Davis - Groin - LIMITED    LeBron James - Ankle - LIMITED    Chris Paul - Shoulder/COVID-19 -LIMITED    Joel Embiid - Meniscus tear - LIMITED    Luka Doncic - Neck - LIMITED    Donovan Mitchell - Ankle - LIMITED    Donte DiVencenzo - Foot - OUT    Jaylen Brown - Torn ligament - OUT    Jamal Murray - ACL - OUT    Kawhi Leonard - Knee - LIMITED    Mike Conley - Hamstring - OUT         Did I miss anyone?
"To be fair Luka is out, james harden was hurt, lebron is out, Conley is out, curry is out, ja morant is out. His only competition is ben simmons"
"It‚Äôs LeBron lol. There‚Äôs a good argument he shouldn‚Äôt have made it either but it‚Äôs LeBron fucking James.   Plus Miami had a very disappointing season after going to the finals.   Tatum has more games, better record and better traditional stats."
"1. Hard not to be condescending when I'm talking with someone whose TL;DR is ""ignore stats, they don't count, I watch the games, Lebron is awesome."" 2. None of the metrics from this year 'destroy' Lebron. They just all say he's not an elite defender. You can go back through the years to see similar things. 3. As I just said in my previous comment, every single advanced metric in every single sport is flawed. There is no perfect stat. Blinding listening to them is just as ignorant as ignoring them if you don't like what they say. Critical thinking is a pretty important skill to have in general; this is one of those times where it's useful.  4. The people whose literal job is to watch/comment on/write about NBA basketball games have not felt that Lebron James is an All-NBA defender since 2014. Not really sure how there's a disagreement over this.  FWIW still interested in seeing what seasons you think Lebron ranked highly in defensive metrics despite playing awful defense."
"That doesn't necessarily mean Lakers were frontrunners after Clippers. It just sounds sexier to write ""11th-hour move to keep Leonard from partnering with Lebron James and Anthony Davis"" than ""11th-hour move to keep Leonard from re-signing with the Raptors""  All that sentence suggests is that the window for him joining the Lakers was officially closed"
There is considerable evidence that LeBron James is anti-vax
"Enjoy your blood clots buddy, I make my own decisions and I'm not getting vaxxed. Would you say the same thing to LeBron James? Stay mad, because unless you haven't realized, most of us aren't getting vaxxed. And yes, I said MOST, because this time I'm positive that the vaccination rate is less than 50%."
Dude. Bron wanted a teammate. Bosh went along for the ride i mean are you serious? We are talking about a 25 year old lebron james - hes the guy people want to play. And you cannot answer how the Heat would be contenders without him
David Griffin is overrated as fuck. Lucked into like 5 first picks and LeBron James being born in Ohio.
"True, and indeed funny... but part of being able to tolerate LeBron is understanding that his narcissistic tendencies could be a *lot* worse for someone with his story.  Everything from the gag order on his wife ($25 million + a certain amount per year before they got married, to not talk about his infidelities), to the excessively curated image... when casual fans catch glimpses of his true self they're like what the fuck this guy is an asshole. There's a reason he's so hated, and I promise you it's not just his greatness. He can be a massive dick at times too.   LeBron fan for over 15 years.. I'm just James Franco asking you ""first time?""  I'll eat the downvotes, truth hurts apparently"
But Lebron James did not have to follow protocols....
I thought we were talking about LeBron James?
"The fact that you thought including defensive stats in your argument where LeBron sometimes ranked highly even in some of his worst defensive seasons in recent memory says enough. They are just not accurate all and are wildly dependent on role players, minutes, and a gazillion of other factors that are not really influenced by the particular player. That's why you see such things as Duncan Robinson being ranked 25th or Marc Gasol ranking 17th. They are not worth your or my time.   &gt;Wait...you you actually think that Lebron James hasn't been named to an All-Defensive team since 2014 because of a lack of reputation? That's delusional. His reputation (well-earned because of those late Cavs/early Heat years, when he was one of the best defensive players in the league) is basically the entire reason why stans keep insisting he belongs in these conversations despite the fact that he hasn't actually been an All-Defensive level player in years.  I'm only speaking about the last few years when he has noticeably improved his defensive effort during the regular season. Turns out when you are playing on a defensively oriented team (which is the polar opposite to the last few years in Cleveland) and when you have an amazing defender like AD playing with you it's much easier to play great defense.   LeBron has earned the reputation of coasting on defense in the regular season between 2014 and 2019 but he has time and time again shown that he still has the ability to play excellent defense.   These past couple of seasons he was locked in and especially this year before the injury he was looking great.  &gt;The people who vote on NBA awards are literally employed to watch the games  I didn't tell them to watch games I told **you**. There was plenty of buzz around media circles/podcasts and what not about LeBron being an dark horse candidate for second all defensive team if he continued playing like he did at the start of the year. He had a legit shot at it if healthy.   You are the one that is basing his opinions on years old narratives."
It was literally a celebrity tequila party: https://thesource.com/2021/05/19/lebron-james-hosts-drake-michael-b-jordan-and-more-at-lobos-1707-tequila-party/
"Gosh, it would be terrible if someone's opinions were ""extremely heavily influenced by reputation"". Someone like that would probably make claims that weren't backed up by reality - definitely want to avoid being one of those people.  In totally unrelated news, here's what advanced stats say about Lebron's defense this year  * 18th in [DEPM](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm), between Marc Gasol and Rudy Gay * 26th in [DRAPM](http://nbashotcharts.com/rapm?id=-2146555570), between Duncan Robinson and Brad Wanamaker * 40th in [Real Plus-Minus](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/DRPM), between Steven Adams and Jae Crowder * 92nd in [RAPTOR](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/), with the same rating as Jokic and John Collins * DWS tied for the lowest of his career * DBPM below 2.0 for the fifth season in a row  Interesting.  &gt;awards that are extremely heavily influenced by reputation  Wait...you you actually think that *Lebron James* hasn't been named to an All-Defensive team since 2014 because of a lack of reputation? That's delusional. His reputation (well-earned because of those late Cavs/early Heat years, when he was one of the best defensive players in the league) is basically the entire reason why stans keep insisting he belongs in these conversations despite the fact that he hasn't actually been an All-Defensive level player in years.  &gt;I recommend actually watching the games  [**The people who vote on NBA awards**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1KMzwRcilLDej0BWl7eYE_OYC9Tx9olI_Ptn-nHjKfpQ/htmlview) **are literally employed to watch the games**, and not just the ones involving the player they stan. Basketball is their career. They haven't put Lebron on an All-Defensive team since 2014 because he has not been one of the best defensive players in the league since 2014. Other than that, great comment."
Cleveland has sports? I thought lebron james just randomly vacationed there and played with some local kids and won the championship.
lmao that you think a party is gonna turn away LeBron James or ask him to show a vaccination card to let him in.
"This was literally not sourced anywhere, I'm only speaking on what was reported at the time:  &gt; In an 11th-hour move to **keep Leonard from partnering with LeBron James and Anthony Davis on the Los Angeles Lakers**, the Clippers are trading four future unprotected first-round picks, one protected first-round pick and two pick swaps to the Thunder to get George, league sources said.   https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27129474/sources-clippers-land-leonard-george"
The Warriors were a great team on both sides. Check the stats for that postseason. They were the #1 defensive team. Strictly in defensive personnel the Bucks are better but the Warriors were so much smarter and also had all defensive players like Klay and Iggy. Bucks have better D but don't underestimate the Warriors. They're comparable.   But anyway that's not even their biggest strength like you said. They were also #1 in offense by far.   KD had to keep up with an offense that can't figure out how to get past a hobbled James Harden to attack a center rotation of Blake and Jeff Green. LeBron had to keep up with an all time great offense that included 2 MVPs in their prime flanked by a top 2 shooter of all time. And he had to go through the best defense of the playoffs too.   KD was unreal but that LeBron performance man. Just something else
"So why does Lebron not get sidelined for covid protocols but CP3 does? It was pretty well known that Lebron just straight up broke protocols and absolutely nothing happened to him. Charles Barkley was right, the league doesn‚Äôt have the balls to suspend Lebron James."
"At this point there‚Äôs no excuse, the shot is available everywhere. Imagine choosing not to get vaccinated the reason why your whole team lost the opportunity for a ring...  LeBron James is also unlikeable for not taking a stance and trying to influence more people to get vaccinated. Dude, you‚Äôre a public figure, in an environment where there‚Äôs misinformation being believed by so many people, you can‚Äôt stop thinking about money for a minute?"
"""To clarify any remaining misconception, LeBron James briefly attended    an outdoor event last week where participants were required to be    vaccinated or return a negative test result,"" the statement reads.    ""Under these circumstances and in consultation with medical experts, it    was determined that his attendance did not create risks related to the    spread of COVID-19 and therefore no quarantine was necessary.""  &amp;#x200B;  So he could be vaccinated"
Ask him about Lebron James‚Äô legacy and you‚Äôll really watch this dude earn his username lmao
"Assuming everyone's available and healthy 100%  PG: Steph Curry, CP3, Dame  SG: James Harden, Klay, PG  SF: Lebron, Kawhi  PF: Durant, Zion, Draymond  C: AD, Bam"
G- Steph Curry  G - James Harden  G- Damian Lillard   G- Chris Paul  G - Bradley Beal   F- Kawhi Leonard  F- LeBron James  F - Kevin Durant  G/F - Jimmy Butler  F - Paul George  C - Bam Adebayo   C - Anthony Davis
"Then you have Lebron James who won't talk about it.. NBA players have been really weird about this, but then again, not surprising considering most of them are dumb jocks who were pampered from age 14 and surrounded by yes-men telling them they're god."
"Sure, it took a team effort but that team was top heavy and the carry job is also referring to the season, not just 1 series. The OP was commenting on top 10-15 teams not just teams in the finals.    There's no way it's a top team 10-15 of the last decade. Pick an allstar wing not named Lebron James and they probably don't even get to the conference finals."
https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/5/24/22452208/lebron-james-taken-covid-19-vaccine-lakers-nba-statement-vaccinated  He went to some event and everyone needed to get vaccinated.
He did. https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/5/24/22452208/lebron-james-taken-covid-19-vaccine-lakers-nba-statement-vaccinated  You just are assuming.
LeBron Raymone James exists
Ha ha I wish buddy.....I returned to India a few months back from the states.....I get up at 5 am to watch Nets and Bucks thinking it will be  the series off the playoffs..... But instead I'm treated with the horse shit play from the bucks....they make the stupidest plays like shooting jump shots when James Harden on one leg was guarding them..... man if the nets had all 3 stars healthy the bucks would have been swept by the Nets with a combined margin of 150 points......It makes me appreciate Lebron even more when he was going against the warriors with Nobody.....those games used to be competitive atleast
This is somehow LeBron James fault
"I know it's beyond repetitive at this point, but when it comes to talent, the only team that can stop Brooklyn is the Nets.  Irving out? OK. Harden playing damn near the whole game and yet making one more field goal than you or I? OK. Milwaukee jumping out to a big early lead? OK.   Just didn't matter. Will KD put up another boxscore like last night? I don't think so. If he plays the entire game again, is it possible? Very. He's just that damn good. James will play better. Kyrie will return at some point. Blake suddenly looks like a different player than when he was with Detroit (I know LeBron and KD get knocked for switching teams, but gimme players leaving via free agency after giving it their all over someone phoning it in like Griffin did in Detroit, gut that's a different subject.)"
What if LeBron James injures Landry Shamet and has to sit for the rest of the season? Would it be fair for Lakers (and viewers worldwide) to miss their best player while Nets are missing a roleplayer? Same thing even if Zaza didn't play. Warriors would have won the series regardless if Kawhi didn't play.
Its Lebron James?
kind of like the best lebron james defender is JR smith
"Most comments in this thread are complaining about the Bucks, their coach, Giannis, or expressing frustration which says it all. Nephews don't understand we're witnessing greatness. Lebron/Steph/KD are like Rafa/Nadal/Djokovic we're blessed to witness this.  I don't like Lebron James on the court at all but damn is the Suns Lakers series and Suns Nuggets or even Clippers Jazz night and day in terms of how little I care about the other two series. Any game with Steph, KD, or Lebron playing good minutes and playing to win is must watch basketball.   Kevin Durant is an all time great. I'm still not a fan of Harden or Kyrie but I definitely am pulling for Brooklyn over the Bucks. KD, Kyrie, and Harden OOZE skill and BBIQ. KD takes his physical gifts and matches it with such versatility.  Hope Giannis can develop his post play, play-making, and maybe get a hook or floater, his shooting is just not there and eventually he won't be able to just ram into the opposing defender and dunk it when he ages."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like ~~LeBron James~~ The Best Player in the World‚Ñ¢, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3fyimi/regarding_the_antikobe_bias_on_this_sub/"

01 LeBron James.   02 Kevin Durant.   03 Giannis   04 Jokic  05 Stephen Curry.   06 James Harden.   07 Kawhi Leonard.   08 Anthony Davis.   09 Luka Doncic.   10 Embiid  are your superstars in the league (honorable mention Dame)
He‚Äôs my favorite player ever but KD. KD has not had one season (minus his MVP season and even that‚Äôs super debatable) where he was a better player than LeBron James. LeBron has been the best in the world since 03 and KD has always been a tier below him. KD has never been the best player in the world and I‚Äôm tired of everyone saying it. He‚Äôs the 1b.
"People who dont watch basketball know all these players?  Here in germany it stops after Lebron James and maybe Luka because he plays for dallas now.  But maybe the bigger factor is the language barrier, while nearly all people below a certain age can speak english they ofc still prefer content in their mother tongue.  Also the general interest for basketball could just be higher in ireland then germany, we are quite fixated on football,"
"LeBron took this starting 5 to the Finals at 22, which is the same age MJ was in MJ's rookie season:  - LeBron James  - Washed Zydrunas Ilgaukas  - Drew Gooden  - Sasha Pavlocic  - Washed Larry Hughes"
"They want to milk 2 small markets but didn't want to milk Lebron James and the Los Angeles Lakers, the 2nd most populated metropolitan in the US, playing the Miami Heat, the 6th most populated, during the year when the league was bleeding money.  They would rather put their efforts in rigging an extra game, and risking it all, for only small gains rather than big ones.  Yes, this conspiracy theory makes perfect sense."

"The whole no trophy argument to me makes very little sense. It's all very situational. If the competition at the time happens to be teams led by Michael Jordan or LeBron James a lot of good players will not win anything, despite being really good, since the current competition are all-time greats.  For instance, if you're a small forward playing today you might be better than a lot of those who played in the 00s and 90s since it was a big man era. But, since we have a league with KD, LeBron, PG13, Giannis, and Kawhi all playing that position chances you'll make the All NBA team, or win chips is a lot lower."
"yeah this giving me real ""Ray Allen saved LeBron James!!!"" vibes  The fuck you think made it possible for the game to even be within 3 points for Ray Allen to hit the 3...?"
This is my argument when I tell people I might be better than Lebron James.

‚ÄúLeBron James with NO REGARD for human life‚Äù
"&gt;Michael Jordan has enough star power to light up a commercial or a ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù sketch, but his wooden acting needed the animation of Bugs Bunny to make the original Tune Squad a powerhouse.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;Who‚Äôs better: M.J. or LeBron? This endless sports-talk debate over the greatest ever usually focuses on stats amassed and rings won, but now we have another metric to argue over: Who is the best ‚Äî or more precisely, least terrible ‚Äî lead actor? It‚Äôs close, but James gets the edge, showing more range playing opposite cartoons, pretending to be the overbearing sports dad along with the goofy big-kid corporate hero, even tapping into sloppy sentiment that Jordan reserves for meme-able Hall of Fame inductions."

"I'm being a bit more generous because there's a lot of stars that I think ***can*** lead their team to a title, but just haven't yet.  I think after this year, Giannis would be considered a star who has the potential to lead a team to a title (even if the Bucks lose 3-4). One could also argue that guys like Devin Booker and Trae Young also showed the ability to be a #1 option on a title contender.  So my list would be like Lebron, KD, Steph, Kawhi, Giannis...but also guys who could be #1 options on a title-contender, but are currently on teams with weaker or flawed supporting casts (e.g., Luka, Dame, Embiid).  I also wonder if Donovan Mitchell and Nikola Jokic are close to that level as well (the Nuggets did lose Murray which stunted their playoff potential this year). There's also James Harden - who has made the WCF a few times but was stopped by the Warriors dynasty  Then there's guys like Jayson Tatum, who shows a ton of promise and potential - that's a future superstar IMO  Sorry - geeked out a bit. But you can see how the list quickly expands in my mind"

"Oh, I get your logic. But most of them (It seems) want the security of a long-term deal. ‚ÄúGet the bag‚Äù, they say. Well, that bag is attached to a long-term deal. As it stands, that‚Äôs only something that a LeBron James aged/ endorsement backed athlete could/would attempt."
Ben Simmons is the next LeBron James
Yes I‚Äôm watching Giannis beat up on a third year deandre Ayton. If harden and Kyrie are healthy bucks aren‚Äôt in the finals and you wouldn‚Äôt be putting Giannis ahead of Lebron James.
[They only played in 2 of these losses?] (https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=cavaliers+record+without+lebron+james+2014-15+to+2016-17) Or are you just referring to the 2016 season?
Portland - Greg Oden or Brandon Roy getting bad news from a doctor.  Seattle - fat Shawn Kemp in a Cavs Jersey. Cleveland - LeBron James sitting in ‚Äúthe decision‚Äù. Utah - Karl Malone skipping child support payments. I ran out of steam‚Ä¶
Necessity is different than luxury. To beat the Cavaliers of Warriors didn't need Kevin Durant with their existing roster (they were injured and lost by one minute in G7). But Durant was a luxury and they changed their roster to get him and then he was a necessity to win.   You make it seem like LeBron and the Cavs like he had no help whatsoever. Kyrie Irving Kevin Love LeBron James. All amazing shot creators and their Prime.  You're mixing narratives for the Warriors and KD
"No you are underrating the talent, work ethic and intelligence of lebron James   I think you‚Äôre just stuck on this Gus Johnson comparison because they are both bulky athletic 6‚Äô8 black men from Akron Ohio"
"LeBron James averaged 28/10/8 on great efficiency while consistently being one of, if not the best defender on his team across 55 finals games.  The East also consistently has elite defenses in the playoffs, so dominating offensively against those teams is just as impressive if not more so than doing it against the West.  He averaged 33/12/9 across 22 finals against the Warriors, who were consistently one of the best defenses in the league across that time."
"Again, reading comprehension. Saric couldn't contend with the combination of Anthony Davis and LeBron James. We needed more athletic players at that time. I doubt he'd struggle as much when Brooke Lopez is one of the two people that he would be helping defend and rebound against."
"Jamal Murray, Mike Conley, Donavan Mitchell, Kwahi Leonard, Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Klay Thompson, Joel Embiid, Trae Young, Jaylon Brown, Kemba Walker, James Harden, Kyrie Irving"
"Dwight Howard gifted those accolades to them.  You say super hot from three, I think most people see it as doing what the roster was constructed to do.  4 shooters out bombing outside shots with Howard in the middle.  IIRC this was the first time this play style was used so prominently and effectively over a long term.  ===========================*  Much like LeBron James in his first Cleveland stint.  Mo Williams was an All star but come on now.  Lol, Antwan Jamison?  Ilgauskas?  Illegitimate all star.  Ilgauskas team before LBJ had the 3rd worst record in team history while in a one of the weakest conferences and divisions ever.  LBJ propped up a washed Ilgauskas for years."
"Lue is a product of Lebron James though lmao? They should have beaten the Mavs in 5 and the Jazz are a flawed team that‚Äôs at its best midway through a regular season. He gets partial credit for taking on a young Suns team while missing kawhi for sure, but he‚Äôs not a top coach in the league."
Relying on fans to evaluate coaches is how you get people calling Lue a product of Lebron James.  People loves Fizdale back during his first year with Grizz because he called out the refs and said not to rook him.   Fans can't evaluate coaches.
"They only have three people they talk about. Tom Brady, LeBron James and Michael Jordan."
"Not an apples to apples comparison. Bosh voluntarily took the reduced role knowing he was going to win multiple rings. Plus he was playing with a stacked roster with LeBron James and Wade, two of the best players in the league.   Porzingis demanded a trade to contend thinking he‚Äôll be a co-star but the team is mediocre and the offense is completely centered around Luka. He‚Äôs more of an afterthought than a co-star. He‚Äôs a bit upset and rightfully so, reminds me of how Kyrie went to Boston where they promised he‚Äôd be the face of the team. But then Tatum broke out and they decided to focus on Tatum over Kyrie."
"They won 3 out of 5 games against a Cavs team with LeBron James, Tristian Thompson, and that Mozgov. If the Cavs were healthy, they were not going to lose that series.     I think part of their 73 game run was everyone being worried about Steve Kerr's injury. At the time, he was given a lot of credit for the team's success. Luke Walton engaged the team differently and allowed Green more freedom. He did a lot of growing in those games."
"This has to be the dumbest take I have ever seen. Kd + kyrie win by like 40 points in one of the first two games. James harden yes choked in game 7 against the kd steph klay dray warriors but how did he even get to game 7 in the first place. Healthy James is a guaranteed 20 points and 8+ assists minimum per game, but in the series he was an absolute liability due to his health. If you don‚Äôt think the nets would‚Äôve scored 1 more point in regulation game 7 with a healthy James there is no saving you.   ‚ÄúKyrie never performs in playoffs‚Äù I guess the 2016 nba finals no longer exist then. Maybe he can‚Äôt do it as a number one option, but on the Cavs with lebron he absolutely performed and maybe even outperformed Steph curry in that series."
"I know the odds, but I also know the 73-9 Warriors blew a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals when that had *never* happened before.   Long story short, the Suns could really use LeBron James. I‚Äôm not afraid to say it."
"Name nba players that has no flaws. How many there are? like 3? Kevin Durant (but he has some injury concerns so maybe doesnt fit here?), Lebron James (but he is at the end of his career so maybe doesnt fit either), Luka Doncic (below average 3pts/ft shooter, lots of To...so maybe bot him either?).  You are massively underrating Sabonis. He can defend. Defence isnt only blocked shots. Its steals too (Sabonis had 1.1 per game), its deflections (was high on the list), rebounds (one of the best in the business), he was like leading nba in distance covered on defence meaning he is putting effort there.  Even advanced stats that kinda did nt like Sabonis last year - werent bad whatsoever for his defence (they suffered on offense mostly).  Also he just turned 25, is on great contract and keeps improving massively every year."
"Yes, because the NBA went through and required each player to be measured and listed at their actual height.  He measured at 6‚Äô9 [here‚Äôs an article ](https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/nba-official-player-heights-kevin-durant-lebron-james-anthony-davis-dwight-howard)"
"I'm of the belief that you can put 2011 squarely on LeBron James's shoulders and 2014 if you're feeling it. But other than that, I struggle to see which of his Finals losses he was favoured in. In my eye, James was an underdog in 07, 15, 17 and 18.  Realistically there was no way for him to win those.    But my arguement against KD is that all of his Finals runs have been with legendary teams save for 2012. There was no way he could lose with those teams around him, this is evidenced by the fact that the Warriors nearly three-peated if not for those significant injuries. And still he feels the need to present himself as an underdog which is clearly delusional to me.   As for 2001 Sixers, I think we both can agree to the fact that even if they went down 0-2, I can hardly see Iverson taking down Prime Shaq &amp; Kobe on his own. But still his Finals run is forever immortalised as he went toe to toe with those Titans.   As for Bosh, I agree with you that he took somewhat of a backseat in MIA, but to my eye he was in decline by 2014. The Spurs ran an offense with surgical precision and I doubt LeBron could've done anything different.  I guess my point is that when LeBron James does everything and his team is simply outmatched he is murdered by the so called analysts. When KD for the first time experienced this is in 2021, his performances were hailed as legendary and heroic."
"Interesting [according to the Superteam wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superteams_in_the_National_Basketball_Association) the first Superteam was the Heatles but  people are redefining Superteam and applying it to teams in the past.  &gt; A superteam in the National Basketball Association (NBA) is a franchise whose roster typically has three or more Hall of Fame caliber players that are in their prime.[1] A more conservative form would be 'All-Star' or All-NBA level players who have recently or are currently still chosen to represent the best of the Eastern and Western conferences as All-Star players or were voted in as part of the All-NBA team at the end of every season.[2] The first Superteam was ushered in when LeBron James decided to join his fellow draft-class players, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, at the Miami Heat at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season  &gt; Although Superteams are mostly thought of as a fairly new concept, some have tried to apply the term to teams of the past, prior to the 2000's, due to the multiple players considered ""superstars"" or ""stars"" at the time, that were on the team. However, some refute this by claiming that the stars on these teams were past their prime and teamed up as a last ditched effort to try to win a championship, such as the 2007‚Äì2012 Celtics. Teams that feature multiple stars that were drafted by the team they play on, do not meet the ""super team"" criteria in many people's eyes."
"Lakers: No issue here, Lebron James will just magically appear on your doorstep and also tell AD to force his way to your team.  EZ PZ"
"Except the 2016 finals rosters weren't that close. Curry had an injury, Barnes forgot how to walk and LeBron James played the 3 greatest games of all time to win that series. Frankly, the GSW roster was *already* way better than that Cavs roster."
"This is like ""LeBron James isn't black, he's American"", they're separate things."
What‚Äôs missing is the NBA building superstars that don‚Äôt name LeBron James. That‚Äôs on the NBA if you think that anything is missing in the finals.
"2011 Mavs beat Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Dwade, and bosh. Giannis beat a nets team without Kyrie, a crippled harden, trae young, and Chris Paul/Devin Booker they can‚Äôt be compared"
"""LeBron James with no regard for human life"" - Kevin Harlan"
"I think some people got too hyped for it, to be honest.   I was pretty hyped, too, but I kept my expectations in check. After all, it's a movie about LeBron James playing basketball with Bugs Bunny.   I enjoyed most of the jokes, the MJ fakeout and the NBA references. The only thing missing was a shot at James for his performance in the 2011 NBA Finals. I was hoping the Goon Squad would have JJ Barea."
"Miami is still a free agent destination. Every time someone mentions big markets there is always a Miami fan pretending they aren't a destination. There is always risk involved but you know why AD wasn't a risk for them? Because there was essentially a 0% chance he was gonna leave. For most other teams in the league it's like a 90% chance so yeah they aren't going to throw away all their assets and future to win for 1 season.  Miami did take a risk when trading for Shaq and then he re-signed there. If Utah had cleared cap space for the big 3 or Toronto had cleared cap space for the big 3 in 2010 do you honestly think that there was even a 1% of them signing in those places? The Nets thing is why teams don't take these risks. If the Nets weren't in New York they would still be mediocre as hell and have missed on potential star players with those draft picks. Sure they took a bit of a risk with Kyrie and Durant but do you honestly think that there was a single team in the NBA that would not have switched places with the Nets and signed both of them? I do agree I think teams need to take more risks but I also entirely understand why they don't. Butler forced his way to Miami. Has a player in the entire history of the Toronto Raptors ever forced his way there? You know what the answer is. As a Miami fan do you think that free agents are just as likely to go there as they are Utah, Toronto, Indiana, Denver or Portland? Every time someone brings up Miami being a destination for free agents I always see a bunch of Heat fans talking about how great there front office is and all the smart moves they made. And guess what? Nobody is denying any of those things, these free agent destinations have to make the right moves and be well run to win nobody is saying that that isn't the case (except maybe the Lakers). But I know that as a Toronto Raptors fan, I know they will never have a player of the caliber of Chris Bosh, Jimmy Butler or Lebron James ever sign with this team in free agency barring some extremely exceptional circumstances or some future Canadian superstar but even that is extremely unlikely."
"This is true. Finals series have always been more popular with a super team. Usually those series have included LeBron James or MJ though, so take those ratings with a grain of salt. Would Lakers-Nets have drawn big ratings? Probably - but predominantly because of LeBron. I don‚Äôt know that KD has that social pull."
that sounds fair. also can we have tyler herro for lebron james and anthony davis?
"If this was NBA2k and we turned off injuries, the Warriors don't win the 2015 NBA finals and who knows what happens with Durant. LeBron James would have become a dynasty winning 3 out of 4 (12,13,15).  I don't understand why people say the Warriors got robbed in 2016, while ignoring 2015. Honestly, those 2 seasons couldn't have played out any better because they got Durant and 2 more rings out of that loss.  Also, Klay Thompson didn't get to sign a supermax because salty voters with Warrior's fatigue didn't put him into the all-nba team. This has yet to pay dividends, but it could starting next season. Or maybe it has already hurt the Warriors because they used the MLE and injury exception last season to try and chase another playoff run and it cost them draft position."
"&gt;and james   The NBA community is in shock, as the Los Angeles Lakers finalise a trade involving SF LeBron James."
Let's just look at the names:  Lebron James vs Kevin Durant  Kyrie Irving vs Steph Curry  Kevin Love vs Klay Thompson  JR Smith vs Draymond Green  Tristan Thompson vs Andre Iguodala   Does that look even top to bottom?

That yank on Lebron James shoulder in the first round didnt really get much traction but he does some petulant irresponsible shit sometimes
"You're arguing that Lebron James plus 2014 Kyrie and Kevin Love isn't a superteam but yeah, I'm delusional..."
"What confirmed my view on Chris Paul bring a prick was during the Suns first round series against the Lakers. When Paul went down early in the series, LeBron James when to check up on him. When James went down, he didn‚Äôt do the same for him. And they are suppose to be friends too."

"So then why are we conflating this with big markets vs. small markets? It‚Äôs really about LeBron James vs. everyone else. There was an era recently where the three most important players were on the Cavaliers, the Thunder, and the Warriors. Big Markets?"
I‚Äôll give it another try. I couldn‚Äôt get passed the first 20 minutes. Lebron James seemed to force his lines early on and there was so much ‚ÄúPOP‚Äù just happening.
I know someone that LOVES Lebron James and HATES Giannis just because sports commentators like to compare them.
Lebron james and Anthony Davis &gt; james harden and‚Ä¶ Patrick beverly?
"Football has worse flops in the quality of the flop. Like some seriously no contact delayed reaction sniper shots to the players. However these happen once or twice a game and we move on. If that much sometimes.  However, NBA has like 10+ flops a game. If you like certain teams or players even more. This is one of the reasons that no matter how good James harden is I just can't watch him. It's boring and egregious. Meanwhile Giannis goes to the line even more at times and takes longer yet I don't mind watching him.   I also don't mind when bigger players flop a bit cos they don't get as many fouls as they should. LeBron, Embiid, Jokic etc, get beat up and no fouls are whistled. Not nearly as many as for smaller players who yank their head back, getting a whiplash while someone walks past them."
Conservatives don‚Äôt like LeBron James.
"A few players commented on Giannis‚Äôs block, Iguodala &amp; Dame did I know for sure.   Idk why he doesn‚Äôt get similar love to other star players when they do incredible things, it‚Äôs probably a whole mixture of things. Like others said Giannis keeps to his team, he‚Äôs Greek &amp; didn‚Äôt grow up over here, also some probably hold James Harden‚Äôs stance that ‚ÄúI wish I could be 7 ft tall, run &amp; dunk. That takes no skill‚Äù (paraphrasing).  Now in this series specifically I‚Äôm very sure that a lot of players want to see Chris win a ring. So you won‚Äôt really hear a player like Lebron praise Giannis, there are likely others."

"I remember a couple of years ago he was asked something to the effect of why doesn't he train with players on other teams in the off-season. He said something like why would he train with them when they're his opponents.   &gt;He told¬†The Athletic: ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt work out with you in the summer and then play you in a few months. It feels weird. It doesn‚Äôt feel right with me. Like other players, it‚Äôs cool for other players, but I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt want to. Other guys do it. ‚ÄòI feel like with LeBron and KD [Kevin Durant], KD did that to LeBron. Take a lot of his thoughts and use it against him.

But because he doesn't train with them he doesn't build the same relationships. Like most of those guys grew up playing AAU ball together. Giannis didn't and he's also not into training, so he really isn't making friends.   I absolutely love his way of thinking. If other players don't give him props and go to his games then it's whatever. It doesn't seem to phase him."
"Well my dad was a general manager at one of the nicer restaurants in the area and had served Chris Paul and Justin Gray (Who is awesome btw) multiple times well around 10ish years ago cp3s mom calls him and says him some other people and lebron James were visiting and wanted to eat dinner there. well my dad asks her to tell him a time since it'll be a Friday and they have to shut down the restaurant since LeBron is gonna be there and doesn't want them to get swarmed with fans bothering them. Well date and time passes and nowhere to be seen so my dad calls her back and she says that Chris didn't want to go anymore since the restaurant was never shut down when Chris Paul went with his family and didn't understand why LeBron was getting ""special treatment"" so he decided to go bowling somewhere else that night. so basically shut down the whole place on the busiest night of the week just because he wasn't getting treated the same way as LeBron fucking James.

"I do think the max contract is a problem. LeBron James and KD shouldn‚Äôt be making anywhere near the same amount of money as Porzingis.   If you remove the max, a smaller market team could throw money at the problem. Eventually you‚Äôll get a superstar going to a team like Oklahoma City because they‚Äôll pay more."

LeBron James - his first name is James   Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal - he is actually Irish   Pete Marovich - he is an anthropomorphic pistol   James Harden - he is a metapod

"&gt; That‚Äôs just a bunch of excuses for MJ. You‚Äôre failing to look at the 93/94 team.  How so? It's the truth, they coasted to a title with Jordan and the very next year despite having better pieces overrall, couldn't make past the second round.  &gt; That team was a bad foul call away from the ECF. They took the Knicks to a game 5 without MJ. If they don‚Äôt make that BS call the Bulls are back in ECF. That‚Äôs not normal.  No they weren't, they were a bad foul call away from being up 3-2 in the series, the foul call didn't end the series, they had two games left to play and couldn't get it done.  &gt; You think the 2017 Cavs would make it to a game away from the ECF without Bron? Not a chance.  Yes, i absolutely do, especially considering how god awful the Eastern Conference was in 2017. They probably wouldn't have made the Finals, but they would've made the ECSF. They would've had to go through a 42-40 Pacers squad led by Wayoff P to match what the Bulls did in '94, hardly a challenge.  &gt; Or how about the 2011/12 Heat? Bron had to go nuclear in a game 6 at Boston down 3-2 in order to save their season. Bron doesn‚Äôt play that series and BOS probably sweeps Miami.  So? Jordan had to score 42 in Game 7 of the 1992 ECSF to carry the Bulls through the Knicks, then he had to average 41/8/6 in the greatest Finals performance of all time to beat the Suns in six, great players do great things.  &gt; I could do this exercise with a bunch of our modern stars and I can PROMISE you their teams aren‚Äôt winning 55 games without them.   And that only shows how you fail to understand what context is. Modern stars leave their teams because they don't think they can win, so they move while their teams rebuild, Michael didn't leave, he retired, the Bulls tried to bring new pieces to keep contending, which obviously didn't work as they got bounced in the second round.  But i will go along with it. Kevin Durant AND Serge Ibaka left the Thunder in 2016, they went from 55 to 47 wins. Kawhi Leonard left the Raptors and they went from 58 wins in 82 games to 53 in 72 the next year.  And since you love to ignore context, here is one that you will love: LeBron James joined a 35-win Lakers squad in 2018, they won 37 games with him the next year, by your logic you should question his impact."
"The narrative was that LeBron was supposed to be the cavs' savior but then left and now Kyrie was this new drafted wizard saviour. Kids were asking him if you are gonna leave too and he said ""no I'm not Lebron James.."". Ofcourse, looking back at it now it's hilarious."
&gt;I'm Not Lebron James I'm Kyrie Irving  why tf does he have to say this obvious stuff out loud
"My favorite mixtape on YouTube is still Kyrie Irving ""I'm Not Lebron James I'm Kyrie Irving"". So fkn good highlights, rookie and sophomore Kyrie was just doing AND1 shit."
If you picked goats of each era  Bill Russell/ Wilt  Kareem Abdul Jabbar  Magic Johnson/ Larry Bird  Michael Jordan  Shaquille/ Tim Duncan/ Kobe  Lebron James  And that gives you your top 10 as well. Avoid trying to rank them any further.

Lebron James will win a Championship in Cleveland
"Would be better if team B had one more interior defender, right now Duncan can't stop shaq and giannis together. Kawhi can't provide too much help on giannis cz he would be busy on James. Giannis would eat KD. Team A spacing would be horrible though, but to counterbalance it team B doesn't have any real curry stopper and would absolutely need to double him if they want to win.    Offensively Team B looks better but team A has way better defense : Shaq would protect the paint and can follow Duncan enough. Giannis is a relatively good matchup against KD and Leonard. MJ Kobe would be interesting and LeBron on Kd or Leo. Curry will be eat alive by Kyrie but it's the best option they have probably. They are also way better on switches so they would stop more team B than B would stop them.   I would go with team A."
He made the lebron james stat infographic less impressive than the original thread imo.

Scottie Pippen went before Lebron James???
"All-time playoff games played (266 and counting) and all-time playoff total points scored (7,631 and counting) - LeBron James."
"I mean take it decade by decade, there is usually one or  two guys that own the decade-60s you have Russell and chamberlain-70s its pretty much Kareem- 80s it's Bird and magic -90s is clearly Jordan-the 00s  it's Kobe and duncan( Shaq almost makes it here, but by virtue of underperforming, constantly switching teams and one less ring than the other 2, keeps him from reaching it)-the 10s belong to LeBron. Period. (Durant, curry, and kawhi all have hof resumes but none come close to James). So from that we have a easy model for a top 10(chronologically)  1 russel 2 wilt 3 Kareem 4 magic 5 bird 6 Jordan 7 kobe 8 Duncan 9 lebron 10 (you could argue a bunch of guys here, Shaq, is my pick but if you picked curry or Durant, you could have a solid argument)  I am a lakers fan, but I am here to tell you to put some respect on that man's name. That's Larry fucking Legend. That's one of the baddest men to ever lace them up. You don't have to like him, but you're a fool to not respect him."

I don‚Äôt agree with the part about Bill Russell having ‚Äúreally no chance to make it to the finals 11 times in 13 years‚Äù. We‚Äôve seen LeBron James go to the finals 9 times in the past 11 years. 8 of those consecutively on 2 different teams too.  There would absolutely be a chance for Bill to go to 11 Finals in 13 years when it‚Äôs entirely possible LeBron might just do it if he goes to the Finals this year and then the next. I‚Äôm talking about a lot here sure but to say there is no chance when there is a chance of watching it literally happen over the next 2 years just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me.

I love how on this subreddit you can go to any given comment thread and find some idiot with a warriors flair talking about Curry. Every warriors fan would let steph curry shit in their cereal every morning for a FORTNIGHT just to suckle one of his ring fingers. and I just KNOW that they're reading this right now, because they infest game threads like a ganon of leeches, and halfway through skimming it with their limited reading skills they realize they have an erection, so they ctrl+shift+n and search ayesha curry feet until they bust a nut onto the keyboard, posting comments like ""if this wasnt curry people would think this was cool"" or just ""mmmphmmgofgpsngfjg"" because they still have Steph Currys DICK in their mouth.  They say don't cheer for injuries. Fuck that. I hope Steph Curry gets hit by an airplane. He'll be screaming at one of his teammates who works day in and day out for him, because the warriors are only up 74 - 8, and some insane fan will just lose it and prison shank him 3 times, and then once more for good measure.

And when security drags me out for causing a rumpus I'll just laugh and laugh, because I know that I hired the insane fan to do it. It was my plan all along. All I had to do was promise him the chance to wear step currys skin. Oh, you thought the funeral was closed casket out of respect? No, no my friend. His SKIN is gone. Where is it now, you ask? It's been... distributed. A small bribe to the chef was all it took. And now Ayesha is wondering why her pig in a blanket has the faint taste of vegetable curry ice cream, and the tears begin again as my laughter drowns out the wind and the rain. And the world keeps spinning. I am home now. Some days are good. Some days aren't. All I can do is live what life Curry has left me."
"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass."
"Kevin Love yelled, ‚ÄúThere you go!‚Äù Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. J.R. Smith belted, ‚ÄúWe got a fucking squad now.‚Äù And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him &amp; said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù"
The playoffs are way more enjoyable and less toxic without Lebron James playing.
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World‚Ñ¢, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
Who heard this in RDCworld Lebron version when he came to know James Harden joined the nets.
"How are you telling me it‚Äôs factually incorrect when you don‚Äôt even have access to the stats?  And win shares, BPM etc are extremely outdated  stats. Jokic apparently had a higher peak than Shaq by several standard deviations. Paul George is apparently better than Kobe. I just don‚Äôt think harden was as good as Kd in the playoffs, kds defense on tatum, scoring and efficiency were a lot better.   And here‚Äôs an article from end of January (period before Kd got Covid)  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-mvp-rankings-lebron-james-kevin-durant-nikola-jokic-in-mix-but-joel-embiid-is-quarter-pole-leader/amp/  Kd was firmly in mvp convos before injury.  And here is the on/off net rating of harden and Kd. https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612751&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=201142,201935  The offense is so much better with Kd, then it was with harden. Like what the hell is hardens argument over Kd? When healhy Kd provided way more value. Kd is like the best player in the world while harden is like 5th or 6th. Cmon"

"I understand your side of the argument, i overlooked Giannis entirely. Clearly Lebron won in the playoffs however that is the baseline argument. Lebron played very well and ultimately won the championship. But to say no one was playing his level or better is simply untrue. The lack of a winning team doesn‚Äôt discount the skill and ability of an individual player in my opinion.  Luka and Giannis are my front runners for better than Lebron in the bubble season. Luka, had he had a team to carry him on would be the toughest contender for lebron in the western finals, more than the heat were. If you were to skill match all the players to an average amount of production between the Mavericks and the lakers that year and the only stars were Luka and Lebron. Luka would have clearly shown his scoring ability and ball handling to be better than lebrons all around. The only thing that lebron had on luka was court vision and that only stands up because lebron arguably has had the best court vision of any player in the league ever.  Plainly Luka Doncic in the 2019-2020 season was a superior shooter and scorer from the midrange. Roughly equal at finishing around the rim when acounting for percentage and was quicker and faster than lebron james of the dribble. Lebron that year had court vision and iq over luka as well as psychicality."
"I believe this perspective to be skewed because of many league narratives. But in my opinion the 2020 best player in the league was a toss up of Stephen Curry, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid.  Again though, perspectives are skewed based on league narratives and wins/awards. You can individually look an any of these players though and objectively say they were better than Lebron James under a microscope."

"Boy, did you miss something magical. That championship run was legendary. Imagine a team beating the defending champions with Kobe as their leader, then whooping Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden, and ultimately prevailing over prime LeBron, D-Wade, and Bosh.  That was the Dallas Mavericks. Led by a single all-star. A man on a mission. Dirk Nowitzki."
Kyrie James or LeBron Price
"In the age of social media, where a ton of people don‚Äôt even rely on major media outlets to keep up with the NBA and watch highlights and learn about players, your argument is absolutely absurd.  Fans aren‚Äôt saying, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs this Jokic guy? The NBA never markets him, so I‚Äôve never heard of him!‚Äù They‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄúJokic? That big, goofy-looking guy? Yeah, he‚Äôs pretty good, but let‚Äôs see some Trae Young or Steph Curry or LeBron James, please.‚Äù  As others have pointed out, the Nuggets have played on Christmas the past couple years. The NBA has tried giving the fans Jokic, and evidently, not enough fans have been interested in him to warrant another Christmas game."
"Wes unseld should not have been finals mvp, Elvin Hayes should have been that year    I understand people would look at a finals featuring Tim Duncan and LeBron James and raised a few question marks about Tony Parker being the finals MVP, but he was great that series, say what you want about the competition but that Cavaliers defense was legit and Duncan was terrible from an efficiency standpoint so I think they gave it to the right guy     So I do think Wes unseld probably has the worst finals.mvp on this list perhaps, but as far as overall players yes Andre Iguodala and Cornbread Maxwell are the two worst , you can flip a coin honestly"
"Nets lost because they got injured.   &gt;A lot more that goes into basketball than just who's the best team on paper  Lebron James, a self-proclaimed GOAT candidate, 2 time MVP winner up to that point and seen as the ""best player"" in the league retrospectively pulls the biggest choke job known to a player of that caliber and that's seen as ""normal?"" I don't think so.    I won't lie though. I enjoyed seeing Lebron getting locked up like that, but that was his series to lose after all the clowning he did that season"
Ridiculous for pointing out that Lebron James choked and shouldn't be in the GOAT conversation because of it?
&gt;Cringe  My team has championships. Sorry that you aren‚Äôt focused on winning. The only sadness is that Lebron James has failed to win a real ring with us. Instead we got a bubble ring
"&gt; LeBron James - 2009, 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2020 (5)  3/4 of Lebron's titles were from teams that finished the season as the 1 seed.  Kind of crazy most of his finals appearances were when his team wasn't the 1 seed"
Sorry my expectations for my team are higher than yours. I could give less of a shit that we have Lebron James and Anthony Davis if they don‚Äôt win a real ring
Yes. You think the Mavs win against the Heat if Lebron James plays like a normal basketball player and not absolute shit?
There's a reason for Lebron James being held to 18 PPG? Did you not read my earlier comment? No amount of game planning against ANY superstar should hold them below 20 PPG. Lebron James eliminated himself from any GOAT conversation with that horrible performance. He choked and proved why he will never be the GOAT. Has absolutely nothing to do with the Mavs scheming. Lebron choked
"They overperformed, and every team they played against underperformed. If Lebron James plays like a normal human being, the Heat win in 5. No amount of ""gameplanning"" should take out the supposed best player in the league and hold him to 18 PPG. There's a reason why people focus so much on Lebron's failure, and not the Mavs success"
"One of the most overrated finals runs of all-time. Swept a Lakers team that just got finished going to 3 straight finals. Played against a baby Thunder team that swept them the following season. And got lucky that Lebron James pulled off the biggest choke job of any superstar. More focus should be on Lebron eliminating himself from any GOAT conversation than Dirk somehow becoming a ""clutch"" player despite having over a decade of playoff failures. I'm so sure he ""carried"" when his team shot 40%+ from 3, had a DPOY and got outscored by his teammate to end game 6 of the finals"
"I mean do you honestly think Steph Curry is 89% more of a draw than LeBron James on the Lakers?   I‚Äôm sorry, but clearly there‚Äôs some lack of context in these numbers probably stemming around what team the Lakers were playing in LeBrons healthy games. Cause I remember few marquee matchups."

"Lebron is just as much of an outler though.  14% of all NBA finals in history have featured Lebron james as the best player  For comparison, Hakeem has 2.  Barkley 1, Dirk 2.  Hell Duncan and Pop only have 6 and the Spurs were synonymous with the word dynasty in the NBA."

"""You can't average 14 in the first round"" He had 7 assists and 7 rebounds still, plus the dude was the only person the Bucks were worried about because they knew the rest of the team wouldn't do shit. It was a good bet. Saying ""KD and Kyrie had their way with the BUcks"" is so monumentally stupid as a way to shit on Butler. KD and Kyrie are two of the most gifted scorers of all time. That's like shitting on Paul George for not having as many MVPs as Lebron James. What the fuck even is your argument. It just sounds like you're taking 4 games of Butler's career personally and are salty he was voted as All-NBA over Tatum. And again, no one claims Butler is as good a scorer as Booker or KD or Kyrie, but you know what Butler has that those three don't? Two of the five greatest finals performances in NBA history. Fuck off with this weird sports revisionism. You're the time who critiques every player on the same scale as the media does to Lebron James. Enjoy the sport, stop pocket watching"
"Paul Pierce: the authoritative, objective source on all things LeBron James  Anyone who doesn't have LeBron James as a top five player of all time (regardless of what happens this season) is a fucking moron. You can probably extend that to top three."

NFL fans are more about their team than players when compared to the NBA.  Brady had a far far bigger percentage of football fans who were haters than James. Brady wore them down.  Rewind time before the last 2 super bowl wins and you couldn‚Äôt mention his name without a bunch of people saying he‚Äôs overrated and just lucky because of Belichick.   The hate on Brady was real. Flip 3 of those Lebron finals losses to wins and nobody dares say anything negative about lebron today.
Lebron james?
"No one‚Äôs arguing that Lebron is a better scorer than MJ. I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre on other than some delusional anti-Lebron kick.   Your point was MJ ‚Äúmakes the right pass in the clutch‚Äù and I pointed out that Lebron is noitorious for doing the same thing.   Also, for what it‚Äôs worth, [Lebron shoots slightly better in the clutch than MJ](https://howtheyplay.com/team-sports/Michael-Jordan-Versus-LeBron-James). That isn‚Äôt to say he‚Äôs a better scorer in the clutch than MJ, he‚Äôs not, but you saying he‚Äôs bad in the clutch is entirely wrong."

Basketball is not a very popular sport in Denmark, but it's at least on the spectrum. Up untill a decade ago you I honestly don't think most people in Denmark could tell the difference between American Football and Rugby let alone tell you about specific people in the sport.   NBA at least gets mentioned on the news sometimes and it's usually Lebron James related. NFL basically only gets a brief mention after the Super Bowl or if Morten Andersen(the Danish kicker) clinched a big game."

"""I don't believe I've played for a super team. I don't believe in that,"" is my favourite LeBron James quote of all time"
"In no particular order: James, Curry, Giannis, Doncic, Durrant, Harden, Embiid, Jokic, Lillard, AD, Kawahi, Tatum, Booker, PG, Mitchell, Young, Randle, Bam, Middleton, Butler, Gobert. If he returns healthy, Klay.  All players I would take on a team before Kyrie and trade him for in a heartbeat. He is injured frequently and has never led a team in the playoffs as it's best player. He has only made the playoffs on teams with LeBron and the Nets to an extent. In Boston he was pathetic and in Cleveland before LeBron he was a stat stuffer that couldn't lead a team to the playoffs in a weak east outside 2-3 teams. He is also a terrible defender, worse than anyone on my list.  He is a top 25 player when healthy, but not top 20."
No one cares.  Warriors fans are so annoying with their second hand inferiority complex about LeBron James.
"Zion is listed at 6'7"", but probably a 6'6"" barefoot. LeBron's 6'9"" listing is BS, as Love is listed at 6'8"" and is taller than LeBron. I made a comment going greater into depth about this: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/pg4w85/comment/hba4ohp/  Celebheights.com also has LeBron listed as 6'7.5"": https://www.celebheights.com/s/LeBron-James-3984.html   LeBron is listed only 1 inch within AD, when AD is clearly over 2 inches taller than him. So the gap in height is not as big as people think between Zion and LeBron. And you can even see it in pictures they are photographed together. This is not a 3 inch difference in height:  https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/26/sports/26zion-2/merlin_169547004_ba1ea0eb-b693-411d-819d-1a459bad8a6c-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"
"Not sure if he is, because ESPN reported that LeBron is maintaining his weight at 250 lbs for this upcoming season  &gt;While James dropped 17 digits off his uniform, changing from No. 23 to No. 6, he's maintained his weight at around the 250 pounds he was listed at last season, sources told ESPN. His offseason regimen was focused on adding lean muscle rather than shedding pounds, sources said."
"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass."

What about Lebron James also known as Lebron James?
"I don't really need to look at context-less accolades to form my opinion, cuz i actually watch basketball and form my own opinion . I think lebron james is the best basketball player ever"
I'm saying that's fine. I'm also saying he's LeBron James. And now he's vaccinated. Great.
"&gt; Yes he was still raw at that point and once again, it was not until MJ was 24 that his team finished above .500 or advanced past the first round of the playoffs. James Worthy went on to average 13.4 ppg the following year, so again to argue that MJ was going to be tearing up the league out of high school or as a one-and-done is completely asinine.  &gt; If your argument is that MJ is the GOAT over LeBron because once he lost to the Pistons enough times, he learned from it and hit an untouchable peak where he just couldn't lose and that overrules the sum total of LeBron's career, I'd personally disagree because there are years he didn't win a championship where he was as good or better than he was in '96 or whatever and the difference was that he had better teammates, but at least there's some kind of logic.  &gt; Saying that MJ's legacy would be better if he entered the league straight out of high school is just silly because we can already see that it took a few years for MJ to be the undisputed best player in the league and again, the argument for MJ is already pretty much just '6-0 in the Finals' so it seems like additional years of not having that much team success would be more likely to hurt than help him.  &gt; Giannis and LeBron both won their first championships at the same age as MJ did with his. I'm not so hung up on the idea of LeBron being the GOAT that I can't acknowledge that while you could say this year's championship was somewhat weaker due to all the injuries, there's at least some non-zero chance that Giannis improves his shooting to the point that he ends up better than either of them.  &gt; With Jordan though (and a lot of other older players), it's more about the story where because they entered the league closer to their prime, a higher percentage of their career is on teams that win big and they don't get as much of a 'loser' reputation. If MJ had an additional 3 years at the beginning of his career where his team wasn't winning and it was then year 9 where the Bulls still couldn't get past the Pistons, I assure you he would be looked at at least somewhat differently.  &gt; Just consider someone like Kevin Durant, who was leading the league in scoring and playing for a 50+ win team at the age MJ was a rookie. Throw those earlier years out and he's been on a 50+ win team every healthy year of his career, and if the Nets win the title this season like they're favored to you could say he's got 3 titles in the 10 years he's been healthy to finish the season and could very well have a couple more with better injury luck. Now I don't think he's at MJ's level, but those three additional years of losing at the beginning of his career have certainly made him underrated when considering whether he should go down as a top 10 player of all time.   lol, i think you replied to the wrong person"

Would LeBron James with Steph Curry accuracy and Isaiah Thomas height be better than Michael Jordan with a 99 speed rating on 2K?
"Clearly my point was that you were 5th seed by a hair and has no bearings about being top 4 especially since you were tied with the Lakers who had you know, Lebron James injured half the season"
"It doesn't fit until you realise that LeBron James is a wine-drinking mommyblogger in a 6'9"" basketball phenom's body.  Seriously, if you look at his social media through that lens it all makes perfect sense."
"It doesn't matter since they're both household names and two of the most famous US athletes. But I'd absolutely argue that Brady being more popular is debatable. LeBron has been in the public eye since he was in high school and has been all over sponsorships where tons of people have seen him in commercials and movies.   I even prefaced that social media isn't the end all be all but it absolutely isn't meaningless, especially when the difference is so large. This is pretty flawed since, again, social media isn't everything but let's use their following and say LeBron and Brady are as popular in the states. Let's say 90% of Brady's fans are from the US, so 9M followers. That leaves 1M from the rest of the world and let's just assume it's all Europe. 9M of LeBron's followers are from US (to mstch so that leaves 91M for the rest of the world. I'm sure at least 1M of that 91M are from Europe.  Ronaldo has 350M on Instagram and Messi has 270M. They're obviously far more popular than LeBron and Brady and those numbers reinforce that. Also, I think we'd probably agree that they're more well-known or at least as well-known as LeBron or Brady in the states.   Europe does have their own leagues but just because Europe has their own league and professionals doesn't make less people know of LeBron James. I'd actually say that goes in favor of LeBron being more known. As I mentioned, you don't necessarily have to follow the league to know of the player. I'm sure you'd agree that basketball is more popular in Europe than American football. Wouldn't it make sense that more people know of the guy who has been arguably the best basketball player for over the past decade?  In the US if you were to ask the average person if they know Messi or Ronaldo or Neymar or something, they'll say yes but the average American probably wouldn't know someone like Christian Pulisic even though he plays for the National Team and plays for a good club. If you follow the sport and know Pulisic, you'd definitely know the best players in the world. And I think that'd apply everywhere. If you follow the sport, you're going to know the best players even if you don't follow the league they play in or the team they play on."
"250 has been his listed weight for so long which is wrong, as are most listed weights  No one can guess weight with eyes but you can see clear differences from 2014 when he dropped weight to now   [Example 1](https://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/lebron-james-skinny-picture/237902)   [Example 2](https://i.insider.com/53e22a56eab8ea63106c108e?width=600&amp;format=jpeg&amp;auto=webp)   It's a lot of weight but it's also an insane athlete who looks after himself and spends millions on his body so"
Base of the last season alone I definitely take Curry over LeBron. Your statement only works when factoring in the past when you realize in the past LeBron James tends to turn it up in the playoffs

Unless you live in Spain or Lithuania basketball is a niche sport. So I have no idea where you live where a Lebron James is constantly on the ‚Äúnews‚Äù
You must be trolling. Did you seriously just call Lebron James an excellent rim protector?   Have you ever watched basketball in your life?
Good for them. Field a roster fully vaxxed and be proud of it. Be leaders - fuck - you have THE leader of the NBA in Lebron James.  Applaud this.
Lebron James: Anti vaxxers buy shoes too
Brady is not more well known. Maybe in the US since they're both two of the most famous athletes but no one overseas knows Brady. Very few people follow the NFL outside of the US.   Far more people follow the NFL than the NBA in the US but you don't have to know basketball to know LeBron James
"&gt;Not even close. Think about the second best player on the Pacers (Smits?), Knicks (Starks?) and Cavs (Daugherty?) in the nineties. Lebron‚Äôs east was weak but so was Jordan‚Äôs. The west won in ‚Äò94 and ‚Äò95  It's not really a matter of opinion, it's an objective fact.  &gt;The average East playoff team in Jordan‚Äôs era was much better than the average East playoff team in LeBron‚Äôs, even though Jordan‚Äôs Bulls were also better than LeBron‚Äôs Cavs and Heat. If anything, this table undersells the difficult East that Jordan (usually) defeated. Jordan‚Äôs average Eastern Conference finals opponent was nearly a point better in net rating than James‚Äôs.  [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/michael-jordan-faced-better-competition-than-lebron-james/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/michael-jordan-faced-better-competition-than-lebron-james/)   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I think Scottie was comfortably better than heatles wade, cavs kyrie, only AD last season was on that level. Scottie took third in mvp voting jordans baseball season. The second bulls threepeat team especially was deep too. Ron Harper‚Äôs scoring average dropped like 15 ppg when he joined cause they were stacked.  I mean, Lebron had more than one teammate did he not? Bosh &amp; Love are better than MJ's other teammates"
"Is it time to start questioning the validity of these ""top"" rankings?  What does ""top"" mean? It's really ambiguous. Maybe these rankings are only meant to start heated debate (because that's what they do.)  SI's formula is ""a combination of data and subjective evaluation... The goal remains to evaluate players in a vacuum as much as possible, without overvaluing team context in taking stock of their quality.""  That's super weird because basketball is a team sport. Each team needs someone different, depending on the players and their relative strengths and weaknesses.  Who's better, Steph Curry or Lebron James? Depends on what category. If you need a jump shot, Steph Curry. If you need to defend a tall player, Lebron James.  I get it, these are fun, and the debate is fun. I get into them. But stepping back a bit and looking at these ""best,"" ""top,"" or ""most valuable"" rankings seems a bit pointless.  Sorry, I know it can be fun. Maybe I'm just being grouchy today lol"
Thats basically the same exact difference between league average that Lebron James has. Are you saying Lebron has been a bad scorer in the playoffs?  and im not ignoring valid arguments i'm ignoring shit like this   &gt;Certainly LeBron in his prime had more defensive value than MJ ever did. Despite MJs defensive player of the year and all-defensive accolades.  Like at that point you can just say whatever you want. You are ignoring facts anyway.
Only change I'd make on this list is swap Kevin Heurter in for Lebron James
LeBron James doesn't work for the NBA. The NBA works for LeBron James.
I'm LeBron James
you literally got lebron james
"It isn't just anectdotal. People don't know who Lebron James is in Europe. Like they might know the name, at least some people but most people would not be able to pick him out of a line-up. Michael Jordan is a more famous basketball player in Europe than Lebron James is.     Tom Brady i think is more well known, but neither Brady nor Lebron reaches the heights of Messi or Ronaldo."
"Best Player Ever: Michael Jordan  Best Scorer: Kevin Durant  Best Offensive Player: Steph Curry  Best 2-Way Player: LeBron James  Best Defender: Hakeem Olajuwon  Now I'm just imagining a line-up of Curry, Jordan, Durant, LeBron and Hakeem"
"I hear people debate Jordan v. LeBron, and there‚Äôs good arguments on either side, and I can see points in either direction looking at stats, rings, recognition, etc.  Then you watch 15 seconds of Jordan clips and go ‚Äúnope, yeah he‚Äôs the, one he‚Äôs the greatest ever.‚Äù  I think the way I‚Äôd say it is that LeBron James is the greatest basketball player I‚Äôve ever seen.  Like if you identified every skill it took to be a basketball player, LeBron has the best accumulation of those skills at the highest level of anyone ever.  But Jordan was just on another level entirely, just out there doing shit from a physical and mental standpoint as if he came down to slum it from Basketball Olympus."
"Tried to post this Just my two cents in the discussion...      Going through the initial list from NBA 50th anniversary and Simmon's Pantheon (given that he is/was the basketball savant)... seems that there are 27 players in the Pantheon (not on the 50) AND have ended their career later than 96:         Rank Player	               Rank Player	Rank	Player	Rank	Player   7	  Tim Duncan	39	 Dirk	69	Dennis Rodman	85	Arvydas Sabonis   8	  Kobe Bryant	41	 Gary Payton	72	Chris Webber	88	Shawn Kemp   20	  Lebron James	43	 Jason Kidd	74	Joe Dumars	89	Vince Carter   22	  Kevin Garnett	47	 Paul Pierce	77	Tracy McGrady	90	Chris Paul   28	  Dwyane Wade	55	 Dominique Wilkins	78	Dwight Howard	93	Kevin Johnson   36	  Steve Nash	62	Ray Allen	82	Chris Mullin	96	Tom Chambers   37	  Allen Iverson	63	Reggie Miller	84	Robert Horry		   IMO, all the names up to Rodman should be included in the 75, as well as Tracy, Dwight and Chris Paul - total 18 players      Of course the Pantheon doesn't include current household names as KD, Steph, Harden, Leonard or Giannis (could also add Westbrook in that list for MVP and number of All-NBA teams consideration). - other 6 players, bringing the total to 24.      That leaves one extra player to add in the top 75. Perhaps Jokic due to his late MVP, dunno.      The tough question to answer is whether we are keeping the initial NBA 50 list intact or can we remove a few names and create space for more current players?  |||| |:-|:-|:-| ||||"

"Firstly, your comment is hella wack and idk why you think you should belittle people on the internet lol.

NBA has a monopoly on high level basketball, but there is no revenue without the players. You have multimillionaire and even billionaire GM and owners acting fools and also being disrespectful (see Morey trying to deal Simmons in bad faith, Dan Gilbert and Lebron, Tillman Fertitta and how he manages the Rockets, James Dolan and the Knicks).  Also idk what basketball you‚Äôve been watching for the last 30-40 years, but the NBA as a whole, has always been about hero ball and Big 3s. See: Any championship aside from 2004 and 2014 (but even then Spurs had Timmy D for all those rings and also a budding Leonard too).

Did he not have james harden? But i Digress.

I dont ever wanna hear Kevin&gt;Lebron. If Kevin wins this year I think the past year and this year Kevin&gt;Lebron

"Wade is better and there‚Äôs five reasons IMO, first Is playoffs, he won one of the most impressive rings ever, I think in terms of carrying a team it‚Äôs right on the same level with 2016, and in general he was a great playoff performer. 2nd with Lebron he was a superstar fir 2 years, and would‚Äôve won finals MVP if they won in 2011, but he didn‚Äôt so ppl don‚Äôt give him as much credit as he deserves, third is rebounding, I think wades a better rebounder, 4th is a higher peak, maybe individually harden peaked higher then Wade, but I consider Wade the best player in the world in 05-06, I‚Äôve never considered harden that level of player, and 4th is defense, I think Wade and harden are pretty comparable in most individual categories (shooting I‚Äôd give to James easily though), but James Harden is nowhere near the defender Wade was, and yeah that‚Äôs one category but it‚Äôs also half the game, Harden has always been a one sided player who was at best decent on D, Wade was a DPOY level defender at his peak"
Lol it‚Äôs LeBron James. He‚Äôs an interesting topic. Simple
"  [Serious] In the event that Lebron James decides to request a trade before the start of the season, which team is most equipped to trade for a Top-3 center in the league?"
"This list still doesn‚Äôt include AD (on the Lakers), LeBron James &amp; Kelly Oubre among many others as well."
"Delledova played great defense but in no way did he give curry huge problems. Steph averaged like 26-5-6 that series and had like 1 really bad game and 2 mediocre ones. One of those 2 games delladova only played like 10 minutes in. Delladova played excellent defense and helped push curry into much more difficult shots, and the cavs as a whole keyed in on him hoping to ruin the flow of the warriors offense. It didn‚Äôt work. And he still out scored every player that series except Lebron James. That type of defense is also much more exhausting than offense and tired delladova out significantly letting steph have a few 50%+ three point nights.  ‚ÄúGood D, better O‚Äù is a saying for a reason and curry would be they most talented offensive player back then by far, also the best ball handler, best off ball navigator and quite possibly the best point guard. He would thrive just as he does now. They wouldn‚Äôt even know how to guard him once he starts making 25+ ft threes, and no amount of hand checking is saving them, they‚Äôd tire out way before he would."
"Lol, what a narrative.     Lebron james is an idiot who doesn't know better?  In what field if you are a top revenue generator, in this case the true stars are less replaceable than owners of which a line of people wil come to take the cost of this team with its appreciation, let alone the next tv deal will cover salaries in themselves.   And its all predicated on what stern built and opened up in marketing on the stars themselves.  But theres a reason after 7 years of Lebron Dominating he left for a better team, tehres ar eason that MJ after winning MVP, DPOY demanded help, theres a reason even mr laker legend Kobe demanded help or a trade. Bc basketball is about cohesion, they get that. Sadly the espn/tmz thinks its a 1-1 game and thats how its judged, but it takes a player holding his own and most of the max players go above their salary. they are guaranteed money, they can coast, but most aren't wired that way and are tring to build a legacy if they are 1A stars.  Then it takes an organization to match them to get the Ws  Do you remember PAxon, Kerr, Fisher, Horry, so on. Each year non headling players who probably dont generate revenue for a big contract, but role players make vital plays to win.  You need cohesion, you can't cheap out on depth, and the playoffs is a marathon and all that matters.    Let alone this isn't a typical business, its a revenue sharing where players are equal partners. Why would these billionaire titans who are cut throat in other businesses accept such a model? Bc its F'n Lucrative.  The appreciation and yes, the yearly margins as well including will be sky roceted with the new deals.  Lol at 'uneducated dumbasses'  Lebron james may not have had his education and speak refined through the same higher education system that I went through, but the guy literally took an organiation from scratch, empowered people that were laughed at, and now is a market force that literally can't be denied. ITs funny when you look at some of the business sharks in ownership and they are celebrated for being ruthless and hostile take overs, and now when lebron does it in his own way, hes just uneducated and doesnt get it or something like that,  Hes absolutekly killed it off the court and did it on his own inutition and leadership abilities. ITs downright impressive  as is kobe, as is MJ.  They could easily have spent their 100s of millions in earnings and not missed a beat, but they were ambitious and brilliant at business and delegated the right way and there are many guys like Jamal Mashburn and Iguodola, KD that have utilized their access and advantages not unlike some ivy league kids using their resources or contacts to get ahead.    These uneducated dumbasses have negotiated and now control a market share of the business profits from these so called educated business titans...wonder how?"
"yea the professionalism is terrible, but at the same time look at the picture.  The nba window of play is a career that is 10 years and thats lucky to have not considering injury issues, then the culmination of your life work is gone. You are often judged by team performance and if you are a great and you don't win, it falls on you. Yet every one who knows hoops, outside of ESPN, know its not played 1-1.     There is a reason that MJ demanded help after 7 years of dominating including get DPOY and MVP.  THere is a reason Lebron JAmes left after 7 years to get help. There is a reason Mr. bleed yellow and gold Kobe  asked for a trade when lakers weren't giving him help.  And more recently, frankly there is a reason that Harden left the Rockets after new ownership began to cheap out on margins and role players and non-headline making moves to make his job harder, likewise with the pelicans with Anthony Davis.  They had their best year, he sang praises on Rondo making a difference in the playoffs for him and Rondo said hes willing to even consider a discount because he liked what they built, they replaced him for Elfrid Pyton who may make sense if all you do is read box scores.    So I agree, they handle it the wrong way. The truth is the NBA is more of a mom-pop business that grew to billions rather than your traditional billion organization and teams are trying to change that, but its just a unique make up where the players have 51 percent of revenue and its predicated on marketing on them.  The owners may be more replaceable than the stars in most cases.  So with the culture of things, I don't mind players who go above and beyond.  Including your boy giannis last summer and they want an organiation that matches that level and they have to get it right.  No one cared the son of Chicago Derrick was kicked out when he couldnt stay on the court, no one cared that hakeem was sent ot kick rocks in Toronto because he wanted to play.  Loyalty are a few anomaly situation, its a results league.  Somehow the ownership has taken the teams and conjoined it with fans who don't get the profits or to enjoy the wins if they cheap out but have put the onus on the players of betraying a fan base and cityeven if the organization doesn't do them right.  Most players love the cities and fans, evne if they dont like the owner.  I can't imagine any other industry where you are at the top of your game, high income, producing high revenue yet you're more stuck and not able to move aroudn if your company makes your job harder.  The 'loyalty' thing is another hilarious undefined non consistent theme they billionaires have pushed on fans to hold accountable the millionaire players, either way with the next media deal salaries themselves are going to be covered just with tv rights, with some creative accounting, the owners will still be crying and pointing at the finges and saying look at them!  Now I agree, its tough with contracts and I agree players almost never handle this the right way, but the organizations often get off scotch free for making their employees jobs harder. I can't imagine if you're a star employee at any job, new owner comes in cheaps out, gives you mroe on your plate, makes your job harder while you make a lot of money, then blame you for wanting more help or wanting to leave"
"""I'm closer to LeBron James than you are to me"""
I'm not being biased. Giannis has maybe the best resume in the league after LeBron James and Steph Curry.

"A GM that desperately wants to prove that he was the real brains behind a championship that was clearly due to a choice made by LeBron James. He goes to a franchise gets another generational talent and doesn't really read the room or handle it well.  The best GMs see their situations realistically and make the best out of their situations. It seems like he wants to prove something that isn't really true. The key ingredient any GM needs is a player capable of taking a team to the finals, then they need luck and knowledge on how to construct a team, often times that means being able to keep players who are helpful to your goals happy. Sometimes this is impossible, sometimes it's possible but the GM/franchise screwed up.  He seems like a not-great GM."
"Nah nah man we just gotta accept that Devin Booker and Ayton EXPOSED a 100% healthy LeBron James and Anthony Davis, according to this sub üòÖ"
I remember threads on Reddit like 'Who would you pick in a 7-game series: Brad Stevens or LeBron James?' Wild times. Khris Middleton might be the only player who consistently kills the Cs so much that I still love.
"Correct, if there are no pathways to become a coach because you are black, then it is not a meritocracy and there's a racial bias. You're operating on the assumption that this is currently the case. This seems to be the area where we disagree.   For instance of all the players currently playing, who are considered to be legitimate coaching candidates? Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Lebron James? If any of them wanted the opportunity, the pathway is there. If anything Udoka represents that pathway due to him being considered a no brainer future head coach since he first joined Pops coaching staff."
"Sorry, ""performing oral sex on Lebron James scrotum"" Is that better?"
"Derrick Rose, Dwayne wade, and Lebron James.   We will only score in the paint."
"To an extent yeah. Im not saying people should do it. Im just asking is it possible? Like a lebron james type player, could they theoretically just sit until they became a FA?

Lebron James of course. MJ too small for him.
Imagine if Lebron James and Serena Williams had a child.
"If I had LeBron James and the 2012 NBA all stars, I would think to myself, ""I need to surround LeBron with veteran shooters who can be productive off ball and have a proven track record of exceling under the pressures of the playoffs.""  Now does that sound like the profile of Ben Simmons?"

Andre gets hate because he was on a losing team with LeBron James. As simple as that. Majority of the hate on him comes because he didn't make lebron win and that is true for numerous players who played with lebron those few past years.
Lebron James!!!
"This isn't the Lakers. I've been saying this since LeBron was added.  This is an attempt at an instant team to win titles and a shitty one at that.  The fact that James Worthy said it is the worst Lakers team he has ever seen is saying a lot.  Which also means he thinks that the 2007 Lakers with Smush, Mihm, Turiaf, and Karl Coby were better.  The Lakers sold out and it is an ugly look"

I‚Äôll check it out and maybe send him a message saying, ‚ÄòI liked your whole show, except the ending.'"
"Those are the types that cry the most. When the Lakers lost to the Suns a few games ago, a camera caught Lebron James on the sideline yelling at Cameron Payne to stay humble. When's the last time Lebron dunked without making a spectacle of it?"
"‚ÄúThere he goes.‚Äù Carmelo Anthony gave a look of absolute disinterest. Dwight Howard yelled ‚ÄúIs it still the preseason?‚Äù And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-Laker star Russell Westbrook put on skinny jeans and Urkel suspenders &amp; said, ‚ÄúDid I do that?.‚Äù"

He sits with 3,893 after tonights game.  1 more game and he overtakes Kobe Bryant for the 4th spot on the all time leader-board for turnovers.  He still trails, John Stockton with 4,244, Karl Malone with 4,524, and Lebron James with 4,592.  Although of course Lebron is still playing... so who knows if he'll actually catch up. LBJ is averaging 4.0 TOV per game and Russ averaging 6.0, it depends on how many games these guys play in the remainder of their careers."
"&gt;Lol. Impressive. Nephews really out for blood tonight.  Did... Did you unironically call me a nephew for asking a question? Are you 12? That's something a literal child would say.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Yeah - dude didn‚Äôt respond but averaging 25 a game Jordan is enough to get an 8 seed if he had another star like Kevin Durant and James Harden. They‚Äôll have each other (granted they stay healthy). This is Lebron and Melo‚Äôs 37 season. Which will be Durant‚Äôs (Harden will actually be 36)     Did 37 year old Jordan playing in the NBA exist? What about 38 and 39, when he was with the Wizards? Ten seed twice. You're arguing for a player that literally doesn't exist.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;And Jordan won a chip at 36 then averaged 22 when he was 38 -40.     Jordan was 34 according to BBRef, turning 35. You made 36 up, which is a complete lie.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;And I never said lead. I said ‚Äúproduce enough‚Äù. But you did get me with KG. So I‚Äôll replace that with Wilt and Tim Duncan. Sound good?     You said top stars and produce enough to be 8 seed, implying they're getting the team to the 8th seed, implying they're the leader and best player.   Yeah, Wilt and Duncan are better examples. The dude you were arguing against was still right with the 3 players only tho.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I do appreciate you going through all that work and digging through my post history. See anything else you want to discuss?     Nah.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Side Note: I also said ‚Äúoff the top of my head‚Äù. This Warriors fan funny enough decided to leave that out. Also the way the other guy responded didn‚Äôt sound at all like this warriors fan made it sound. And finally Warriors fan listed 2 not 3 and put words into the other guys mouth for him.     Why would I have to include you saying off the top of your head? That was in your 2nd reply which I didn't quote.  If you aren't confident in your options, then don't say them lmao. Don't blame me. You listed 6 guys and proceeded to say ""Do you not know the guys I listed?"" after the person challenged you..  &amp;#x200B;  The way he responded didn't sound like how I'm saying?  ""Ok so 3 guys ever. Not looking good for a guy with an achilles surgery under his be  That's what he said. The only time I referenced ""what he said"" is when I said ""Correct me if I'm wrong, but, he seems to be correct?"" which literally has nothing to do with ""What he said."" It's about whether he was right or not.  &amp;#x200B;  Finally, me listing 2 and not 3 doesn't change anything, it's me demonstrating that you're even more wrong than the guy implied. Only 2 of your examples work and the Bucks fan was generous and said 3. Again, doesn't change anything. You could include a 37 year old MJ that doesn't exist or a 37 year old Lebron that doesn't exist and he'd still be right."

"Sucks getting old doesn‚Äôt it? Went to an old folk home and I saw a few of them in there.

Not much the Lakers, but, more so James. I don‚Äôt like him. I despise him and he is a fucking joke. Y‚Äôall know that baby is shit, right? Since day fucking one when he came in, everyone made a big deal about him.   Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong. He WAS a great player and We all know what records he has and the stats. Takes more than numbers to prove you are the best and he never proved anything that he was the best. There is so many better players out there than him.   Bottom line is this. He will NEVER EVER be the GOAT. That‚Äôs MJs Legacy. He never gave up on plays. He never stood in the backcourt fucking off. He made everyone better around him. Case and point. Steve Kerr, Luke Longley, Toni Kukoc, Ron Harper. And the greatest second player of all time. Kobe Bryant.   Seeing the previews a few months ago for the new space jam movie. The Goat. A New Legacy. Get the fuck outta here with that bullshit shit show. Listen up basketball fans. New and old. LeBron James, is a bitch. HE IS SO WAY OVERFUCKINGRATED.   I just wanted to say my joke but I went on a rant instead. Well, thanks for the time."
"Watch, people are going to interpret this as ""James Harden admitting he's washed because of rule changes and age"" just like they interpreted Lebron saying he'll never be back to where he was as him not recovering from the injury ever, not him saying he's just not in his prime anymore."
Lebron James Tonight:  0 points   0 assists   0 rebounds   0 steals   0 blocks  LBJ really needs to put in more effort if the Lakers expect to make the playoffs this year. It can‚Äôt be all on Westbrook to carry the team.

"#An open letter to LeBron James  Hello,  As a kid from Earth, your teams were my ‚Äúdefault‚Äù team. After the mid-2000s, through the Mo Williams years, your fans held on. Then, you, the hardworking, driven, focused, determined LEADER, came to Miami.  With a keen eye for talent, you built a TEAM focused on hard work and success. If your ‚ÄúJust a Kid From Akron‚Äù phrase had a managerial equivalent.. it‚Äôd be personified by you.   You brought us 4 rings. You brought us DeRozan. You yelled ‚ÄúFuck Dallas‚Äù, and took us to the playoffs 9 of the past 11 years. You managed to go back to Cleveland, in a deal that made me sad (lol) at the time. Had I known it‚Äôd be a deal that‚Äôd lead us to another championship I think I‚Äôd have moved on much quicker.  It‚Äôs like the saying goes, ‚ÄúTrust in LeBron‚Äù.  You brought us Wade, Bosh, Kyrie, AD... AD! The list goes on! Kevin Love!   You collaborated with Drake.   This off season we lost a LeBron legend in Caruso. But we managed to keep you. HUGE DEAL! You‚Äôve built a culture of winning rings. The parade on the planet in 2012 &amp; 2013 &amp; 2016 &amp; 2020 brings to life the excitement you‚Äôve created. Happiness, joy, a player to root for.  As a kid I cheered for you by default. As an adult I cheer for you by choice. I‚Äôm a proud LeBron fan. You‚Äôve given us a player to be proud of.  Front office, back office, front court, backcourt.. you‚Äôve built something truly special.   When we won, the pandemic spoiled your moment. When your trades came through, Twitter trolls tragically disrespected your value. Still, you‚Äôre here.  I‚Äôm grateful that you‚Äôve given so many people on this planet so many positive memories. I hope you‚Äôre being appreciated the way you deserve to be. For a man to be as accomplished as you and remain as humble as you are.. it‚Äôs legendary.  So, to the King of Akron Thank you,  Earth"

Scottie Barnes is better than Lebron James
"What if they figure it out though?   We‚Äôre not talking about some scrub here, it‚Äôs LEBRON JAMES.   He‚Äôs the guy with possibly the highest basketball IQ in the game today, if not all time.   Say whatever you want about Westbrook, (I‚Äôm a fan personally) but even his biggest detractors can‚Äôt deny he‚Äôs an incredible talent.   There‚Äôs a way to make it work with LeBron AD and Russ. I‚Äôd agree with you if this was the playoffs, but this early?   Let them at least *try* to figure it out.   I actually wonder why they‚Äôre not letting Russ be the focal point of the offense. Literally make every play a pick and roll with Russ and alternate between lebron or AD. It might seem like a waste, but so what? Russ is more durable than Lebron or AD. Come playoffs, spread the load and let Lebron and AD do their thing."
TIL IQ is Lebron James
First performance at Barclays‚Ä¶ ya no one cares about Lebron James lmfao not even acknowledging the Harris comment.
James Harden never choked that bad. He always has a few great games then shoots 5/30 with 9 turnovers half the series. He wins you some and loses you some in the playoffs. Lebron pretty much just disappeared that finals and took a back role seat.
"260*  Also, while it is correct that he only played 260 games in his first 7 years, he also played 260 games in the last 5 years. I think most people are aware he missed the entire first two years of his career, but for the few that don‚Äôt, 260 games in 7 years is missing a lot of context.  Over the last 5 years he has played in roughly 40 games less than AD and roughly 60 games less than Lebron James. That‚Äôs still a decent amount of games more than two players who have also dealt with some injury plagued seasons, but it‚Äôs not as bad as 260 in 7 years sounds.  Sorry for the rant. It‚Äôs just annoying to constantly hear about how much time Embiid misses without any context."
How many people are more recognizable than LeBron James?
&gt;James Harden is a better scorer than Lebron.  LeBron's resilience in the playoffs says otherwise.
"He's not even close to the goat scorer, c'mon. James Harden is a better scorer than Lebron."
"&gt; US Royalty ... Like Lebron James, Jay Z, Aaron Judge  But no mention of the King himself, Henri Lundqvist?   I‚Äôm just kidding maybe you wouldn‚Äôt recognize him, just be staring at an incredibly handsome and suave man without realizing."
"Yeah, I feel like these guys think everyone in New York are like those hardcore psychos from that meme that's been going around recently. Like nah that's like 0.001% of the NY population. An average New Yorker doesn't give a fuck about the Knicks, or basketball other than like Lebron James or Kevin Durant lol"
Did you miss the whole saga of ESPN reprimanding Arash Markazi for writing an article about Lebron that wasn't even negative!  but just detailed his extravagant party?

"6-8 a decade?  1 year into this decade we have: Lebron, AD, Steph, Giannis, Jokic, Booker, Kwahi, Durant, Kyrie, James, Dame  Easy 10  Edit: forgot Embiid, Luka and also Ben Simmons most likely in the future if not now"
I don't wanna edit my post but this is probably the most suprising one so far.      - LeBron James is shooting 48.3% from long range and making 4.7 threes per game.   - Stephen Curry is shooting 40.0% from long range and making 4.5 threes per game.
Anthony Davis is washed up and lives at the free throw line.   There are certain players that get special treatment in the league and he is one of them. James Harden KD AD LeBron Giannis Luka Probs Dame

"I think people here are forgetting that Lebron James didn't play.  I'm getting whiplash from the takes the last couple days to the vindictive takes now. He had a great game, sure, but Lebron didn't play. We have yet to see if he can be a good player when sharing the court with LeBron and that hasn't changed.  We know he can be a good or even great player when he gets to be the man...so I'm not sure why anyone is surprised by this, and I'm not sure why anyone thinks this means Russ is BACK and the haters are all just completely wrong/ignorant"
Lebron came out talked to his team mate in his opinion on the ending...why people so butt hurt?  alot of people doesn't like the ending beside james..
"If LeBron James is your problem, you have a damn good problem on your hands."
Kevin Durant is better than LeBron James.
"Thank fuck LeBron is actually willing to play offball some, unlike James Harden."
"Ah yes, LeBron James is the only person with the power to stop China. Forget asking representatives to fix this issue democratically, let's talk about what LeBron is doing.   Fuck outta here if you wanted something done about China you wouldn't be talking to LeBron about it. How many tweets Kanter got calling out politicians?"
"LeBron ""Kayne West"" James."

Yes because when you have lebron fucking James on your team you obviously want him to not have the ball
I called Giannis a ‚ÄúRobin‚Äù at one point implying he needed a bigger star to win a title. When the Blazers signed Carmelo Anthony I called him ‚Äúwashed‚Äù and said he would last with the team for a month at best before he would be released. But the all timer has to be when I said Lebron James would never live up to the hype when drafted and playing for the Cavs would ruin him.
Chandler Parsons is poor man Lebron James
"I actually think [this article](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-lebron-james-russell-westbrook-pick-and-roll-shows-promise-in-lakers-crunch-time-win-over-grizzlies/) did a pretty good job of breaking down how they can potentially make the 'big 3' all work together on the floor.   Main idea was using different variations of the Russ/Lebron PnR (which they used for the first time end of last game). Taking advantage of their passing ability inside, with having AD in the dunker's spot + an outside shootert. Difficult to pull off, but definitely better than Russ aimlessly standing around because his outside shot isn't respected"
"Players can change, even veterans like Russ. Especially when they are playing with LeBron James."
"its 3 games into the season and your take is that the Lebron/Westbrook fit is not going to work  it's a nephew take just based on how gross of an overreaction it is, let alone the fact that you're assuming Lebron-fucking-James, one of the most versatile and jack-of-all-trades players of all time, can't find a way to mesh his game around Westbrook"
it actually perfectly matches my agenda  westbrook can be westbrook when hes the primary ball handler. but this is a team with lebron james on it.
"Makes sense. LeBron and Russ left their original teams they played since drafted and over a decade with relatively beloved (James, the second time around). Davis made his Pelicans exit an ugly one, and lost a lot of those fans that were with him since his rookie year."
Are the Lakers better without LeBron James? /s
He is in awe of LeBron James
"&gt;We literally won a ring. Having good young players is a nice way to get bounced every 2nd round and waste LeBron‚Äôs career lol what   I didn't get a ring, did you?  There are 82 regular season games that go from November to April. That's half the year that I like to spend watching my team. It brings me enjoyment to see my hometown team play hard, and it's an added bonus when I get to watch the same players for a few years in a row.  I don't particularly give a crap about LeBron James' career being ""wasted"" or not. It's not my career. I enjoyed basketball before LeBron James and I will enjoy basketball after LeBron James."
"Can you find the interview where he said he's the original idea? I googled and couldn't find anything, they all quote him saying he's inspired by Battle Royale and Liar Game.  Also the concepts of death games have been a thing forever, like Stephen King's The Running Man came out in the 80s.  And yea, dude also said, ‚ÄúLeBron James is cool and can say what he wants. I respect that. I‚Äôm very thankful he watched the whole series.""  Are you saying it's not hard to read the lines of what the director is saying, or about what you're saying, because so far it seems like YOU have an agenda."
AD being completely fine and walking it off after acting like he just tore his shit literally shocks no one. He goes to the LeBron James school of drama and acting.
League's next Michael Jordan and Lebron James are terrorizing other infants in the kindergarten as we speak and they'll be ours.

This my adaptation of a Soviet political joke:  An American explains to a Russian that the United States is a truly free country because he can stand in front of the White House and shout ‚ÄúTo hell with Ronald Reagan!‚Äù The Russian says that this is nonsense because he can easily stand in Red Square and shout ‚ÄúTo hell with Ronald Reagan.‚Äù"

I don‚Äôt think LeBron James is a very nice person at all.
"This is so aggressive it almost seems like a long-term plan to benefit China. The trio waltzes into a plant that has like 2 weeks to tidy up and hide the shackles and it's now a gigantic, public L for the anti-slave labor contingent.   Not really, but it's funny to imagine LeBron James, Enes Kanter, and Michael Jordan catching the PRC off guard like a basketball-themed special ops unit. A supervisor finds the film roll and they run a perfect 3 man weave with it to make sure it winds up with Homeland Security. And then they each lose like half their wealth as China cleans up its act. Say what you want about Enes, but the dude is GROUNDED..."
If it‚Äôs so complex then why is someone like Lebron James speaking only about black issues? He has enough time to get good at the game‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no way he knows ALL the intricacies of how black individuals are disadvantaged in America. Speaking only of his own self interest only increases the political divide with conservatives. If he wants to get them on his side as well he needs to do more than just speak when it‚Äôs his own interest at stake.
"In terms of purely playing Lebron James is pretty much indisputably the GOAT, but because of his obnoxious/shitty off court behavior (The Decision, trying to patent Taco Tuesday, his garbage takes on China, being anti-vax) I will FOREVER argue against him being the GOAT."
LeBron James isn‚Äôt top 5 and is overrated

"**my least popular opinion** is simply that **Lebron James is old**, and he probably won't be good/healthy enough to lead a team to a championship or even the playoffs for much longer. I offer this opinion when people say things like *all he has to do is score X points per year for another Y years to break all the records and he will do that easily... I mean look at Karl Malone!*, or *of course he is a top MVP candidate... he would have been one last year if not for injuries...*  No player Lebron James' age is a lock to do anything. The fact that he is the only player his age that is still as productive as he is is NOT evidence against this opinion. To the contrary, it is evidence *supporting* this opinion.  Think of him as your 90 year old grandma who is still sharp as a tack. Every day is a gift.  **my most meta opinion** is that submissions for ""unpopular opinions"" threads should be required to link to a thread where the commenter was downvoted to oblivion in order to prove bona fides. Otherwise they turn into circle jerks."
I can see that. I meant more so like i am a lebron James fan so itd be great if the lakers won games but i couldnt care less if they do so long as lebron had a good game. Theres a lot of players to like in the nba and they not every team can win.  Some one has to lose. But that doesnt mean the players I like have to have a bad game. If that makes sense
"He‚Äôs more or less a one-of-one, best in the world defender whenever he puts forth the effort through his entire career. Basically from his second season (too young before) until this season (maybe too old now) he‚Äôs arguably been the best defensive player in the league when he tries. There‚Äôs very weird erasure of lebron as a defensive player on here. A couple weeks ago a lot of people called my crazy for having the gall to say a 25 year old lebron james was a better defender than a prime Shane battier."

"That would be amazing, if he releases Penny video. Young guys don't know how good pre-injury Penny was. Legit superstar and rather unique player with his size and incredible skills. As Ben wrote, Penny was cooking the best defensive perimeter duo that ever existed. Tremendous player.  Also, I'm so glad that he added Grant Hill. Another legit Superstar ruined by injuries:   ""After the first six seasons of his career, before the ankle injury, Hill had amassed a total of 9,393 points, 3,417 rebounds, and 2,720 assists. Oscar Robertson, Bird, and LeBron James are the only three players in league history to eclipse these numbers after their first six seasons.

"Let's say that for whatever reason, LeBron misses the next 4 or 5 games (the ankle sprain's worse than originally assumed). Westbrook fills in, and the Lakers win them all. Then James comes back, and suddenly they look bad again. What would the front office do?"
"&gt;SF: LeBron James and Kevin Durant(maybe the most and least ball dominant superstars)  I'd suggest Luka and Wiggins. Opposite in personalities, one is a dominant playmaker and scorer whereas the other is a great defender and solid scorer. Luka wayyy more on ball whereas Wiggins is more offball.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;PF: Kristaps Porzingis and Zion(Guy who is 7 foot but only takes jumpers vs. guy who isn't but scores everything at the rim)     I have a better one:  KP vs Draymond:  KP is a giant PF/C that misuses his height by being a sharpshooter from deep despite his height. Dray is a relatively small PF/C that is a historically elite defender despite his height. Dray is mobile as hell and an iron man whereas KP is stiff and injury prone. Also opposite in personalities as well as being opposite in games."

I did find this video, it's not the NBA rulebook but interesting nonetheless as they are specifying transition plays.  https://youtu.be/w56aeYCX78c?t=597  In an odd man break if you're bouncing between players you're considered a secondary defender and can't draw a charge.  https://youtu.be/w56aeYCX78c?t=629  I feel like this is the better interpretation of what happened here in which Jokic can draw a charge, of course, your opinion may differ."

&gt; Magic LeBron  I appreciate you not going with Magic James because that just sounds like a movie about a male stripper
"As point guard intangibles goes? Sure, CP is absolutely more talented than Curry on this regard. Curry also controls the tempo and playmaking in a elite way, but by performing drastically different plays than what a PG is supposed to do, which makes him unique and it's kinda laughable to see lesser talent like Lillard and Trae trying to mimic that. But the way CP plays is more traditional, that's a huge sample size of pure PGs before Curry arrived with his freakish shooting ability (he is more a combo guard, by far the best combo guard ever). And compared to all of these pure PGs, including Kidd, Nash, Stockton, Thomas, etc.. CP is the most talented between all of them. Magic got really close, but he had the luxury of playing in a super team his entire career (only LeBron had more help than him in NBA history), so I know people love to aggrandize Magic, but we can't never know if he would be the same high productive PG in a ""normal"" team, playing with DeAndre Jordan or Tyson Chandler instead of freaking KAJ, having role players cutting at the basket instead of James Worthy and so on. Chris Paul arrives in any roster, magically (no pun intended) he makes the team better, this is the definition of a elite PG"

"I guess‚Ä¶ players would be more susceptible to using emotions to judge whether they want another player on the team.

And just like that. Every critique he has ever made of LeBron James has faded to dust.
"&gt; For example, if a team like Minnesota drafted Giannis instead of Shabazz, it is no longer the same team, same chemistry, same timeline as before, and therefore, you can‚Äôt guarantee that this same team would now end up last place in the west 2014-15 so that they could get the pick for KAT.  I agree, but in this situation its likely.  Giannas had all sorts of signs that he could be a stud one day, but was a non-factor for his first year or two in the league.  Milwaukee actually had a worse record after drafting him (not saying he was the reason for it, but its not like a LeBron James or Magic Johnson situation here where a player came in NBA ready)"

"Erik Spoelstra, he's another victim of the LeBron James media from guys like Nick Wright and Isiah Thomas who always love to claim that ""LeBron has never had a great coach"", even though that's never been the metric used with NBA coaches who also had transcendently great players, people didn't start giving Erik Spoelstra the respect he really deserved until he took the fifth seed bubble heat to the finals"
And behind 34 year old LeBron James and famously injury prone Joel Embiid. Oh the humanity. How could they treat him this way.
"The point is games play out differently entirely. He has been a positive for them no doubt, but it's ridiculous to think a team with 11 games of LeBron James would be 1-21."
"boozer was a restricted free agent. they could‚Äôve waited one more year and they could match the jazz offer. it wasn‚Äôt a cleveland problem with boozer. utah  offered more money and boozer signed with them. think about this, the best pf they had since letting boozer go is old man antawn jameson. if you actually think that they handled the boozer situation right ur out of your mind. they drafted lebron mf james. you have to give up everything to give him the best situation to win. he was so good that he would carry them to great records, therefore they couldn‚Äôt pick shit in the draft. they always played in the safest way possible. always afraid to give up picks, knowing they were going to be bottom first round picks. never were aggressive in free agency. look at what the bulls did for jordan. all the time looking to improve the team. cleveland just gave lebron a bunch of junior varsity players and said deal with it. i wish he never returned to cleveland after getting so much shit from them dumb ass fans. can you imagine if lebron was drafted by san antonio?"
"That‚Äôs a very results oriented way of looking at it. It‚Äôs easy for you to call them dumb now in hindsight, knowing that boozer would take advantage of the situation and screw them over, but in the alternate universe where they ignore his request to rework his deal, it‚Äôs entirely possible that results in him throwing a fit and demanding a trade or taking the qualifying offer.   ....And then you‚Äôd be losing your mind calling the team dumb for being stupid enough to nickle and dime a young up and coming all star level player when you had a chance to lock him up long term and pair him with Lebron fucking James...  It isn‚Äôt ‚Äúcharity‚Äù it‚Äôs small market teams feeling pressure to do right by players and agents because they need to go the extra mile when it comes to talent acquisition.   Teams can‚Äôt win with people like you lol. Everything is just dumb stupid incompetence any time anything ends up being anything less than 100% successful 100% of the time. They would have made your laundry list of grievances no matter what they ended up doing in that situation lol"
"In 2009 he played 7 games and shot 36%. In 2010 he played 5 games and shot 40%. That's hardly a sample size to go by.  He may put more emphasis on the 3 point shot but there is hardly any guarentee that he would be anything more than 35% shooter. Westbrook, AD and Lebron all try to be better but they can't or aren't able to sustain it for someone like James.  Kawhi effiecincy is up there with KD/Steph and even trumps them at moments. He is also a DPOY when he feels it. Wade's playmaking hardly cuts that gap. In a League with KD, Curry, Lebron, Giannis and Harden - Leonard was considered the best at certain moments. I don't think that Wade could do so."
What happened to this team? I swear it wasn‚Äôt that long ago that luka was regarded as the next LeBron James. I couldn‚Äôt scroll through Reddit at night without at least 1 ‚ÄúLuka is the first player ever to ______‚Äù post.
"If Enes Kanter Freedom is actively playing in the NBA, wouldn't anything he does become NBA-related? Also, if something like this will be stopped for Enes Kanter Freedom, shouldn't non-NBA related posts be stopped for all NBA players, past &amp; present? Or, is it just singling out Enes Kanter Freedom specifically? So, if Lebron Raymone James does charity work outside the NBA, we can post it here while if Enes Kanter Freedom does charity work outside the NBA, it cannot be posted? Might be good to keep everything posted on r/NBA, NBA related, no?"
"I‚Äôm actually joking about top 5 all time. I should edit that and leave an LOL.   My top 10 would have to include MJ KAJ KOBE BIll Russell Wilt Chamberlain SHAQ Tim Duncan Magic Larry Legend Lebron James   Steph is knocking on the door of up to 3 of those guys, but In my opinion unless he surpasses even 2015-2016 levels he won‚Äôt crack the top 5.   And no he won‚Äôt be a defensive savant but he‚Äôs aging defensively like a fine Wine."
"When it comes to tanking, it sucks. Not only for the fans, but for the players. They won‚Äôt smile at the cameras and do a thumbs up while watching some other dude on the opposing team do an eastbay dunk on their end. That‚Äôs demoralizing for them. It‚Äôs way different than having fun out on the court and trying to make some electric plays with their teammates while building chemistry. Plus you‚Äôd probably get clowned for doing that while LeBron James is in the middle of a reverse dunk"
"Are you dumb as shit? I checked, you don‚Äôt give a shit about the nba, you‚Äôre last comment here was about Lebron James. Also you‚Äôre on Reddit constantly, you‚Äôre not better than others because it makes you happy to be a prick. You say lmao more than any teen I‚Äôve met, all you do is find random subs to spout conservative shit and be an asshole.  ‚ÄúHurr durr don‚Äôt read my history‚Äù if you say stupid shit on a public site, you can be held accountable for it."
"""I like the Lakers.""  ""LeBron James is the GOAT."""
‚ÄúLebron James will not sign with the Memphis Grizzlies‚Äù or sum shit
"Again, Lebron James agrees with me, scoring champion, best shooter in the history of the game. You can disagree with me and Lebron, but that just means you are missing something. KD couldn‚Äôt win a ring without Steph and hasn‚Äôt while playing with another mvp in virtually every season he‚Äôs played, but keep spitting your bullshit lil boy. Some day you‚Äôll understand like Lebron and I do, but that day won‚Äôt be today you oversimplifying teenager And let me clarify: Curry, Klay, Dray works better than any team Giannis ever has played for. 3 rings, no flukes. Meanwhile, the nets will literally never win a ring with that cobbled together faux-super team. They have and will win zero rings with KD, and that‚Äôs what really upsets you. Brooklyn couldn‚Äôt buy a team üòÇ"
"This is good for Lebron, not good for the Lakers. James Worthy said it the other night. Lakers are not playing as a team."
"Vogel is just doing a solid for his good friend LeBron James, who is doing a solid for his ~~good~~ *unemployed* friend DeAndre Jordan"
Lebron James
"Or because it‚Äôs Lebron James and AD; if healthy, they are still a dominant duo and a lot of potential role pieces that can fit in well. We are only 20 games into the season; obviously that is a decent sample size but there is still a ton of time before the playoffs for them to figure out rotations/game plan/etc. I think their weaknesses are pretty glaring, but it‚Äôs also smart not to overreact"
"*At 39,998, 42-year old LeBron checks in with the Staples Center crowd going nuts. The Lakers inbound the ball to LeBron who brings the ball up the front with nary a resistance from the Cavs backcourt, who all idly stands around the 3-pt line while a standing ovation accompanies LeBron James as he picks up his dribble, pulls up for a 3-pt shot and drills it for his 40,001th point. Bronny Jr. is the first one who comes over and gives his dad a hug. The Lakers take a time-out while LeBron walks back to the bench soaking in the applause and the chants for one final time: MVP... MVP... MVP...*"
"you mean averaging 2.3 asts/turnover, above lebron james career average? no shit hes turned it over, hes had 45 assists in the last 5 games"

Imagine thinking you have to defend Lebron James
"Let me take the opportunity to restate this fact: After years of observation I am convinced that the average LeBron James fan has a mind that is approximately 1.25 to 1.80 times more impoverished than the average homo sapien's. Common traits are low intelligence, absence of introspection, and defective communication skills."
Curry is playing at a different level compared to the last 3 years. One of the biggest surprises is how well his teammates are doing.   KD is at the top of the East and even James harden has struggled this year. Lebron consistently took poor teams late into the playoffs.   Giannis took Brook Lopez to the championship.   I‚Äôm not doubting Curry can put up numbers on a bad team. I‚Äôm talking about wins.
"He is an amazing shooter. But when I think of best basketball player in the world, I think of someone whom is versatile and can make his teammates look good.   KD is a great shooter and a underrated defender Lebron James is a good shooter, good defender, good pg and can play a 1-5 position. That‚Äôs what makes a player one of the greatest.  Take nothing from Steph, he is an amazing shooter, but to say he is the best in the world, is a little too much"
McGregor would not by any means beat lebron james in a fight.   There's over 100lbs weight difference depending on what weight class we have McGregor in. Lebron is not trained but as someone with over a decade of MMA training I strongly encourage you to understand that generally speaking there is a point after which training means less than size.  100+ lbs is past that point. McGregor is getting eaten alive.  155lbs vs 250-260lbs
"LeBron's never played with someone dumb enough to take the ball away from him in crunch time before  Remember we're talking about a guy who thought he was a better scorer and should take more shots than Kevin Durant, it wouldn't surprise me if he thinks he's a better option to run an offense than LeBron James"
"Cavs. There's a lot of revisionism around the 2016 Warriors.  Suddenly Andrew Bogut is this DPOY defender that would've swung two blow outs and stopped LeBron's reign of terror even though he was done laterally, playing 14 minutes a night and not even closing out games for the Dubs.  And Draymond would've without question swung the game where Golden State got blown out, even though he came back next game and they still got blown out.  LeBron James was even better in the 2017, Klay Thompson was having a terrible post-season, Gimme the Cavs in 6 if they meet again."
"TLDR: You're dumb and wrong for you objective reasoning. Just say you think they're better players, don't try to use stupid statistical arguments.    Wilt was 2 of 6. That's a lower win percentage at 33 percent compared to LeBron 40, with half as many rings and 4 fewer attempts.  So considering what appears to be your parameters: Hall of Fame Level Player, Win Percentage in Finals (No consideration for volume of appearances or quality of supporting cast).  Your top 10 should be as follows with amount of wins being used as a tiebreaker for matched percentages. (Sorry if I've forgotten anyone.)  1. Havliceck. 8 of 8. 100 percent.  2. Pippen and Jordan JOINT. 6 of 6. 100 percent.  3. Kukoc. 3 of 3. 100 percent.  4. David Robinson. 2 of 2. 100 percent  5. Giannis. 1 of 1. 100 percent.  6. Bill Russell. 11 of 12. 91.7 percent  7. Bob Cousy. 6 of 7. 85.7 percent.  8. Tim Duncan, Rodman JOINT. 5 of 6. 83.3 percent.  9. Kobe. 5 of 7. 71.4 percent  9. Shaq. 4 of 6. 66.7 percent   10. Walt Frazier, Paul Gasol, Kahwi, Hakeem, Bill Walton JOINT. 2 of 3. 66.7 percent.     Players who would be above Wilt who was 2 of 6 33 percent:  Michael Cooper.  5 of 8. 62.5 percent.  Kareem. 6 of 10. 60 percent.   Bird, Wade, Curry, Parish and Mchale JOINT. 3 of 5. 60 percent.  Magic at 5 of 9. 55.56 percent.  James Worthy. 3 of 6. 50 percent.  Ray Allen, Durant and Mcadoo 2 of 4. 50 percent  Rick Barry, Garnett, Dwight, Dirk, Pierce, Robertson and Wallace JOINT. 1 of 2. 50 percent.  LeBron. 4 of 10. 40 percent."
"Ever since the Warriors were a contender Steph was never a defensive liability. He was just the weakest defender on the floor closing games out of Harrison Barnes, KD, Klay, Andre, Dray, Livingston, Looney, and/or Bogut. Of course he got attacked.  And of course it didn't look good when it was Lebron James attacking him. If you'd swapped him with prime CP3 the same thing would have happened to CP3 too."
"as i said, LeBron James does LeBron James things. Just like Michael Jordan vs the Jazz. Doesn‚Äôt matter if your team is better. If he has Kyrie and Love as back up he‚Äôs gonna game 6 BOS his way"
"a team with lebron james, anthony davis, and russell westbrook just scored 23 points against the worst team in basketball...  what's even weirder is that the pistons shot 39% from the field while the lakers shot 49% and they're only up 2 wtf is going on lol"
"Dude got traded pretty much straight up to LeBron James in exchange for Kyrie Irving. There's some pretty crazy revisionist history going down: he hated to leave but he was cool with it because as much as he loved us, he wanted to get paid BIG, and he know Danny wasn't going to do that but (if the played remotely like he had been doing) some other GM would have."
&gt;This is the 900 time you refused to answer a direct question.   Sorry I'm not answering a question about another man's emotional and spiritual response to something.   &gt;And we already know there was no physical impact to Lebron James so he was just straight up lying about that.  Oh yeah because the Chinese government has always been rational when it comes to criticism.
This is the 900 time you refused to answer a direct question. How about it?   And we already know there was no physical impact to Lebron James so he was just straight up lying about that.
So in your mind why would Lebron James be spiritually and emotionally impacted by Morey tweeting support for a state that Lebron doesn‚Äôt live in and has no relation too?
BREAKING NEWS: LeBron James demands trade to Phoenix Suns

"&gt;Don't tell me in a game 7 series you would doubt LeBron James.  This is a weird thing to bring up since the overwhelming majority of this sub knows that a healthy LeBron in the playoffs with a good team around him is a threat.  He's not being overlooked. The Lakers are not good at the moment, to say the least, and he's not playing as well as he did last year, not to mention he doesn't look interested in the regular season at all. He's perfectly rated right now."
"Every year that Curry has been in the league, LeBron James has been better."
LeBron James is in year 19 and putting up insane numbers.   He's still The King.   Steph is a great player in his own right but the LeBron James disrespect has to stop.
LeBron James put on a historic performance to prove he's the GOAT and you blame the refs. Smh.
You gotta be delusional to think LeBron James won't make an all-star team
"Bruh what? The succuss of the players is highly dependent on what the coach is running.   If Kerr just had curry post up every possession, would he be anything close to what he is? Having one of the greatest point guards of all time, but then having your power forward bring the ball up? That's coaching.  Let's apply that logic to some other things.  LeBron James would have to play for a notoriously crappy team before any winning is attributed to him.   Michael Jordan superiority doesn't count because he won all his rings with the same team....   See? Dumb logic"

"It wasn‚Äôt so much that the players forced trades but they the other teams back then were incredibly stupid and the Lakers have always been incredibly lucky, getting #1 picks out of weird trades and coin flips.  They got Magic in a Gail Goodrich ‚Äútrade‚Äù to Utah with the pick only becoming first overall thanks to a coin flip. They traded Don Ford to the Cavs for a pick that became James Worthy, again after a coin flip.   Wilt and Kareem both basically forced their way to LA and were traded for guys I‚Äôve never heard of. Shaq chose LA. The Pau trade was laughable at the time even if Marc Gasol ended up being good. The Kobe trade was a great trade for sure and Jerry West deserves credit. Lebron and AD picked the lakers for the market. Lakers combined having one of the few competent owners historically with some incredible luck, and now it‚Äôs a self fulfilling prophecy."

"The point is that LeBron is famous *beyond his sport*. Tom Brady is not. Tom Brady doesn't even approach LeBron's level of fame.  My mother likes exactly two sports: cricket and tennis. Doesn't mind a bit of rugby union. She knows nothing about basketball, couldn't even name the teams in the NBL except *maybe* the Wildcats because I was super into them as a kid.

I‚Äôd take the Cavs. MVP DRose and Wade would be an insane backcourt. Then add on LeBron James. He‚Äôs pretty good too.
"It is true, at least among American sports.  I don't know anything about soccer in Europe but maybe it's true there.    The Cowboys get talked about 24/7 but we're talking about the team playing football 24/7.  You're talking to a guy who lives in NYC and has season tickets to the Cowboys and I know next to nothing about the guys off the field.  I have no idea what Dak Prescott has been up to outside of rehabbing to play football again.  I have no idea if he's married, political, or who he hangs out with.  Again, my wife has never watched a game and she can tell you who LeBron James vacations with.    Tiger Woods was arguably the most recognizable athlete on the planet who apparently fucked everything that moved and it took his wife attacking him with golf clubs on Thanksgiving for the world to find out he even has a personality.    Tom Brady is arguably better at football than anyone is at anything else and married to arguably the single most famous model in history but, beyond that, his personal life is a mystery.  What everyone knows about him is football related."
"Lebron James is the best point guard of his time, sorry."

"There‚Äôs more talent in the league than ever . A lot of it is hype but I think it‚Äôs fair to put the generational tag on players who are a couple of tiers above the rest   For example , I think Lamelo is the best player in the draft by a pretty good length . But last year , was mostly hype since you couldn‚Äôt say the same for Zion and the rest of his class . Ben Simmons was different since he was red shirted for a year  , and he is still a jump shot away from being Lebron James and was very obviously a cut above the 2017 rookie class, even Donovan Mitchell"
&gt;an extra game or two against X western team each year would cause LeBron James to miss the playoffs in the West.  I think you don't understand how competitive the West was.
"&gt;Because there are definitely years in the west where lebron could not make the playoffs without a solid supporting cast  LOL this guy went to the finals with George Hill, JR Smith and James Crowder yet there‚Äôs still people that think an extra game or two against X western team each year would cause LeBron James to miss the playoffs in the West.   Man yall some trolls."
"First off not a dude, second off it came across a serious, and I've seen multiple people outside of you with the same shitty take. You just happened to be higher up the list in the comment chain so you got the response lol. Don't you know this is the internet /s does exist ;) sorry but some of your fan base is insufferable with their takes, like all fan bases, heck the Lakers might take the top of the charts for moronic statements. I'm still pissed at Lebron for the bs he pulled during the sixers game with Embiid, I lost a lot of respect for him, anyone else thats a flagrant 2, not King James though. Hell Draymond breathes and gets flagrant 2s. Heck Mike Scott last year got a flagrant 2 for not even touching a guy haha. It's absurd pushing a guy mid air who can't even brace his fall is a flagrant 1. Imagine if anyone your team did that, they would insta get ejected. I was surprised Embiid didn't break something in his back how awful it sounded."
&gt; Additional comments I saw from discussion boards: Lue on his time in Cavs was manhandled by Lebron James.  That makes no sense. One of the largest reasons why he was so coveted as an assistant and has now gotten his second head coaching gig is his respect among the players. Huge part of them not imploding against the Warriors was his ability to speak to LeBron earnestly and give him hell without any fear. He famously cursed out LeBron in game 7 at half-time which changed LeBron's mindset for the second half.
"That apparently had been stalled for awhile and was finally greenlit by Jordan, who had almost complete control of the process, the same day LBJ and the Cavs beat the Warriors (after the warriors blew a 3-1 lead. Sorry, had to include that).  https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bulls/michael-jordan-green-lit-last-dance-after-lebron-james-2016-nba-title-win"
Yeah more people need to talk about how LeBron and James K Polk are basically the same person.
"Additional comments I saw from discussion boards: Lue on his time in Cavs was manhandled by Lebron James. Now it's happening in Nets as well, where Nash cannot seem to control his all stars as it seems that they are doing what they just want to do. I think a coach needs to be respected by the players first."
"It looked to me like Lebron saw that Embiid was about to dunk hard right on top of his head.   Obviously Lebron knew he couldn't let that happen to 'King James'.  So rather than be a man and respect the game, he decided to be a thug.  .  It was a two hand push while Embiid was helpless to protect himself.  Total dirty play."
Im convinced atleast half of people here don‚Äôt watch basketball but just have some huge admiration for Lebron James
"Slightly below Lebron in terms of hype but within the same tier, if that makes sense.  Greg Oden's hype is the closest I can think of in terms of what Shaq would be where people were saying ""the next great big man aka a Top 10-15 player of all time"".    Remember that Reebok commercial where rookie Shaq's answering to Kareem, Russell, Walton, and Wilt?  People knew he was the next great thing - the multi-championship winning, MVP touting, dominant big man.  No jumpshot, no problem.  Lebron James wasn't coming in with a reliable jumpshot, either.  He was athletic and possessed an unreal physique that allowed him to just hammer it home."
Lebron James
Fuck LeBron James
lol wtf has AD done without lebron James. He can barely even make the playoffs
What is this revisionist history? AD has one good postgame playing next to Lebron James and suddenly he's absolved of his time with the Pelicans?

U don‚Äôt know 16 Time mvp LeBron James?/s
"God damn, even James Worthy had a Finals MVP with the Lakers, LeBron is the better player, but considering his accolades with the team Baylor and Worthy are ahead of him on their all time list"
Embiid  Lebron  Jokic   KD not in the discussion because James Harden will probably steal votes from him.
The Western Conference LeBron James vs Toronto.
Hey did you know LeBron James gave Kevin Love depression. There‚Äôs a whole story about it
"LeBron James  Kevin Durant  James Harden  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Giannis Ante...  Jokic  Anthony Davis  Embiid  Damian Lillard  Alex Caruso  factoring in the fact that kyrie havnt done shit since he played with lebron, the top 10 stays."
"I mean Jokic is a top MVP contender. If Lebron James scores that many points, we say it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs fucking amazing at basketball. Don‚Äôt need to find any excuse to shit on Gobert"
We talking LeBron James MVP awards or Paul George MVP awards?
My MVP favorites are:  1. Joel Embiid 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. Nikola Jokic 4. Kevin Durant 5. Lebron James
"Anthony Davis is a better player than Joel Embiid. I don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs struggling in the regular season. He‚Äôs a playoff monster.   Top 10 players in order:  Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokiƒá."
"&gt;No, I think he‚Äôs a good defender in the post-season because he consistently ranks high in most counting and advanced stats, which is further confirmed by the eye test.  That is just not even remotely true. What stats are you looking at?  And what does your eye-test tell you? How do you not see him constantly die on screens? Missing rotations on the weakside? There are a million things that point to Rondo being a negatively impactful defender.   &gt;The same metrics that rank Markieff Morris a hair behind LeBron James and far ahead of Dwight Howard?  [They don't.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/) He is among the worst defenders in the league."
"&gt;You accuse me of parroting narratives but think that getting a few steals means a player is a good defender?  No, I think he‚Äôs a good defender in the post-season because he consistently ranks high in most counting and advanced stats, which is further confirmed by the eye test.  &gt;No matter how good or bad defensive metrics are in actually ranking first to last it's a pretty good indicator when he consistently ranks horribly in all metrics that adjust for lineups like DRAPM or D-RAPTOR.  The same metrics that rank Markieff Morris a hair behind LeBron James and far ahead of Dwight Howard?"
Kawhi Leonard deserves it more than Joel Embiid or Nikola Jokiƒá.  Kevin Durant and LeBron James should be the favorites to win MVP though. Interesting that the top 3 MVP candidates are the 3 best players in the NBA (in order).
"Or he could have heard Brian Windhorst and Rachael Nichols discussing how they are *definitely* voting for LeBron because he ""only"" has four MVPs. Or he could have read the article ESPN had on their website claiming that ""someone is going to have to *steal* the award from LeBron James.""  So basically ESPN has decided to perpetuate this narrative for God know's why and all of their analysts and writers seem to be towing the company line."
It‚Äôs literally what Lebron did in 2010. Dude got tired of taking Ls to stacked teams and said fuck it I‚Äôm going to be a part of that stacked team.   More power to him. Go get your üíç James and come back to retire in your home üöÄ
"&gt;cmon don't be dumb. Bron formed a big 3 and won less games than he did in cleveland the previous 2 years. Had a worse individual season than he did the previous 2 years.  His ""worse"" individual season was still superior to Rose's ""breakout"" year.  Rose: 25 ppg on 20 shots per game, 7.7 assists to 3.4 turnovers/game. 4 RPG.  James:  26.7 ppg on 19 shots a game, 7 assists to 3.6 turnovers /game. 7.5 RPG.  So, more efficient, more scoring, basically same assists/turnovers as a PG, and almost double the boards. Oh, and LeBron could actually play defense.  &gt;The bulls went from 41 team to 60+ win team in thibs first year.  That's an excellent argument for Thibs as COTY. It is not an argument for Rose as MVP. It's actually the opposite, as Rose was on that 41 win team the year prior. I know people love their offensive ""stars"", but the reason the Bulls were a relevant team for so long in the East is because of Thibs and the Bulls defense. While they remained a strong defense they kept winning ~50+ games a year, regardless of whether Rose played or not.  Hell, Thibs managed to make frikkin Omer Asik look like a DPOY and got him paid like one.  &gt;Dwights Orlando teams also weren't as good as they were the previous years  Very true! Did you watch the Magic that year? Our supporting cast around Dwight basically crumbled, resulting in a blockbuster trade jsut 20 or so games into the season. Dwight meanwhile had his best season as a pro as more and more of the offensive load was put on him and other teams could leave the rest of the Magic alone.   Despite being the only real offensive threat, Dwight had a career year keeping the Magic in the top 3 in DRTG and 14th in ORTG, getting it done on both ends.   When Dwight sat, the Magic were 9 points worse per 100 possessions, going from a +5.9 NetRtg to -3.1. When Rose sat, the Bulls were 2.8 pts worse, going from +8.0 allllll the way down to +5.2 pts.  Now, who was more important again?"
"LeBron‚Äôs won the last 6 game 7‚Äôs he‚Äôs played, unless you‚Äôre taking Russell, in a winner take all game LeBron should be your choice.  And easier competition? He‚Äôs played Tony Parker 3x, Manu Ginobili 3x, Tim Duncan 3x, Ray Allen 4x, Paul Pierce 5x, Kevin Garnett 5x, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose 3x, Andre Iguodala 5x, Dirk Nowtizki, Carmelo Anthony 2x, Paul George 4x, Russell Westbrook 2x, James Harden 2x, Kevin Durant 3x, Kawhi Leonard 2x, Stephen Curry 4x, Klay Thompson 4x, Draymond Green 4x, Damian Lillard, Nikola Jokic, and Jimmy Butler in the playoffs.  And ignored a bunch of fringe guys like Arenas or Jason Kidd."
"Tangentially related story:  I was in franchise mode in NBA 2K, running the Kings, obviously. I like a good challenge. Anyway, I tank the first year with Demarcus Cousins, selling any and all players I can for picks except for Cousins who goes down with an injury before the trade deadline or else he would‚Äôve been gone too.  We get the 2nd pick in the lottery, which I use to draft a 20 yr old SG. Not great defense, but can hit logo threes like nobody‚Äôs business.  And because I have so much cap space left over from selling off all my players, I was able to sign Lebron James in free agency and went on to win 2 out of 3 of the next titles.  Anyway, I had to start over because that was way too many things going right for the Kings organization and I wanted it to be a little more realistic."
Hell nah. LeBron James is not a global icon like Messi is.
Yea. LeBron James

"i mean we can dislike james' ""im a grown man"" shtick and attempt to get draymond suspended doesn't mean and also think that the team could and should have played better (and that lebron was v. good in games 5-7)."
Lol Klay called LeBron James soft. He clearly accepts all smoke.
"Because defense is more of a team effort than ever there are barely any defensive players that can completely increase a whole ass teams defense to an elite level, but put lebron james in any team and that offense skyrockets. Before zone defense and analitycs where stablished it was more impressive to be a defensive force because most defense was one on one but now that teams are allow to play different types of zones and switching defenses it is more about the system implemented. Curry in 2019 was defeated by a box and 1 defense not because fred van vleet is a god of defense. Harden in 2020 wasn't stopped by the lakers elite perimeter defenders he was stopped because of their doubles and fast rotation. Put Gobert on the wizards and they are still a bad defensive team put lebron james and they become an above average offensive team."
"&gt;Anthony Davis put up better efficiency numbers than that for years in New Orleans, yet no one would say that guy was a top 5 player in the league.  What? Anthony Davis was consistently regarded as one of the best players in the league.  &gt;Even now Davis is still looked at as a robin to another alpha personality in order to win a championship.  Because it's fucking Lebron James?   &gt;Dominique Wilkins  Is a hof of player?? Has everyone gone fucking mad? You're criticizing Luka here because you don't think it's that impressive that he's putting up Hall of Fame numbers in all 3 seasons he's been in the league?  Look man, I get that there are plenty of reasons to criticize Luka, same with Trey, but don't fucking straight up lie or exaggerate to make your argument. This is some dumb ass shit man."
"Also Lebron is 11th all time in 3 point attempts, so it's expected he'd fall under a similar rank in makes.  And honestly, being high on he list of 3 pointers made doesn't necessarily mean you're an amazing shooter. In fact, half the guys in the top 10 are only in the decent to good range: Jamal Crawford (34.8%), Jason Kidd (34.9%), James Harden (36.4%), Paul Pierce (36.8%) and Vince Carter (37.1%).   Again, those guys and Lebron (34.6%) are all good shooters, but nowhere near the conversation of best shooters of all time."
Mario Hezonja block on LeBron James
"So you think he was actually in fear for his life and not worried about the hundreds of millions of dollars he could potentially lose. His PR team did a hell of a job I guess.  It wasn't ""out of thin air"", it was from articles like [this.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2019/10/17/lebron-james-nike-china-revenue/3989915002/)"
Above LeBron James lmao
Chris Boucher all star over Lebron James üíØüíØ
"Lakers are the issue. I think utah matches up really well on the clippers if everyone is healthy. Gobert can match up fairly well with AD if he gets the occasional trap to keep him honest. But the problem, as it has been since 2003, is Lebron fucking James. Utah, like virtually everyone, doesn't have a great match up for him. Can't run a straight up zone very often vs AD/Lebron.   I think Utah's clear cut route to the championship rests with the LA Clippers. If the clippers can clip the Lakers before the WCF the Jazz could be sitting pretty.   Suns a not-so low key dark horse too to potentially give lakers a fit. Feels like they could match up well in a 7 game set. Phx historically plays well in Staples. Or maybe that was just Steve Nash and Shawn Marion"
"I'm not sure whether the tech was justified or not because I don't know what was said, but my point is that it's either a tech or it isn't, whether it's 4 seconds in or 4 seconds left. I hate this idea that is perpetuated through the NBA and NFL (and probably other sports, but I just watch those) that there are some players on whom fouls shouldn't be called as much or some situations during which fouls shouldn't be called. If it's a foul, it's a foul. I don't care if you're LeBron James or Kyle Guy and if it's in a preseason game or game 7 of the finals."
"Why are you comparing the best player on the planet to LeBron James, Wardell Stephen Curry II, etc?   Kevin Durant tried to spoon feed Wardell Stephen Curry II the FMVP in 2018, but Wardell Stephen Curry II choked. You‚Äôre worried about Kevin Durant‚Äôs ego? Funny.  The Los Angeles Lakers aren‚Äôt locks to make the NBA Finals. The Brooklyn Nets will sweep the Los Angeles Clippers or Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals."
This is why LeBron James is the greatest basketball player of all time
"&gt; someone who gets handed things  Ok what? LeBron James. Someone who grew up without a father, worked hard to exceed unrealistic expectations, and still keeping at an elite level despite age. You don‚Äôt think he got himself where he is today?"
julius randle might be better than lebron james
"You got the order reversed.  Remember...  \- Jordan led teams that did not have Scottie Pippen were 182-228 in the regular season.  \- Jordan led teams that did not have Scottie Pippen were 1-9 in playoff games.  \- Jordan led teams that did not have Scottie Pippen were 0-3 in playoff series.  \- Jordan led teams that did not have Scottie Pippen never had a winning regular season record.  5 seasons without Scottie Pippen...and Michael Jordan never managed more than 40 wins in any season.  They both won 6 championships together.  They both have 2 - 3peats.  However, Pippen dominated without Jordan.  Jordan without Pippen was just a taller Allen Iverson.  &amp;#x200B;  In his one full season with the Bulls without Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen led the Bulls to 55 wins on his own (read:  15 more than Michael Jordan ever managed in any of his 5 seasons without Pippen).  &amp;#x200B;  That season..Pippen was dominant all-around (as he was for his entire career).  That season Pippen led the Bulls in points scored, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots.  ""Versatility is a prized trait in all sports. Baseball scouts have a name for it: A ""five tool"" player is someone who hits for average, hits for power, runs well, has a strong throwing arm and fields his position well. The basketball version of this is a player who scores, rebounds, assists, steals the ball and blocks shots. Only five players in NBA/ABA history have led their teams in each of those categories in the same season: Julius Erving, Dave Cowens, Scottie Pippen, Kevin Garnett, Tracy McGrady, and Lebron James."""
On one of the only nationally televised games we got all year too. Shit was heartbreaking. I remember before the play even happened thinking ‚Äúwell Kevin love is the best outlet passer in the league and it‚Äôs lebron fucking James who HATES the wizards. This is probably gonna go in‚Äù
Lebron James is not a center
"Imagine thinking Luka Donƒçiƒá was a top 5 player in the NBA and had GOAT potential because he won two games against the Los Angeles Clippers and lost in the first round lol. Couldn‚Äôt be me. Luka Donƒçiƒá isn‚Äôt even a top 15 player in the NBA.   Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokiƒá, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young and Jaylen Brown are better."
"I‚Äôve felt a similar way with MJ and Kobe‚Äôs supposed primes. To me, MJ and Kobe were at their best in their second runs - MJ‚Äôs second 3-peat and the Kobe/Gasol titles. Not sure if LeBron is really better right now vs early 30s, but I like 2nd Cleveland Bron slightly over Miami James."
"LeBron essentially gifted the award to Rose midway through the season by batting for him, if the support from the rest of the league wasn't enough. Also, stats aside, if LeBron had a season like Rose's that year, it would be a top 10 season in his career (James did not play a lick of defense all through 4 regular seasons with the Cavs)."
"The MVP awards in most if not all major sports are all about promoting new talent and growing the fanbases and not actually awarding the most valuable player. Let's take Michael Jordan and Tom Brady for instance. They could have easily won the MVP award most years they played because they were so valuable that they lead their teams to multiple championships, same with Lebron James. That's why they hype up a new player every year for the MVP candidate."
"1. Actually they aren‚Äôt rotating them on a substantial level,  as seen by the fact all 3 are playing a ridiculous 40+ minutes  2. Yea you kinda left out 1 little detail about Kyrie playing off ball in Cleveland: they didn‚Äôt have a kevin Durant. In your comparison,  the co on-ball presence (Lebron) is harden. So while Kyrie and Bron could just take turns scoring all game, Kyrie and harden can‚Äôt do that. Which brings it back to my point about diminishing returns...  3. As you just explained Harden is on ball. But he‚Äôs not just on ball and able to do his thing, he has to get the ball to Kyrie AND KD. So he‚Äôs more of a traditional PG. So as PG that means he‚Äôs not averaging 30, 35 like he normally does. And if he‚Äôs not averaging 30-35, well then he ain‚Äôt ‚ÄúJames Harden‚Äù.  Perfect example is Chris Bosh and Kevin love.  Both still good players obviously, but Bosh became a percentage of what he was before (they won a title with him scoring 1 point in a clinching game), and Love at the end became a straight up role player."
"""no stopping LeBron James""     you mean the guy who has only won 4 titles in 18 years being in the league? He's been stopped with more talent before."
This Jazz team is beautiful to watch. Id have them as favorites but theres no stopping Lebron James. sorry jazz fans. Only team I see beating us is clipperd
LeBron Goat James is actually 10-0 in the finals in my eyes  2007: super team   2011: Dirk Cheated  2012: beat Thunder big 3  2013: beat the Spurs   2014: Kawhi cheated also  2015: Kyrie love hurt  2016: 3-1  2017: Super team  2018: Super team  2020: won the hardest finals

"This:     When Curry entered the NBA in 2009, the average NBA team attempted 18 threes a game. It hovered around that mark for the first three years of Curry's career until his breakout season of 2012-13 which just so happened to coincide with the NBA itself becoming more 3-point happy. The same year that Golden State's golden child set the all-time record for made 3s (a record he would go on to break multiple times in the coming years), NBA teams for the first time averaged 20 3-point attempts per game.  As Curry's shooting continued to explode and the [Warriors](https://ca.nba.com/contestant/golden-state-warriors/news/btbrq55c3e6btsf1z2poaakb4) transformed into a juggernaut, the rest of the league ramped up its efforts to keep pace with the free-wheeling Warriors. By the 2018-19 season, the fifth straight year that Curry's Warriors reached the NBA Finals, teams were shooting over 32 of them per game.  In that 2012-13 breakout campaign, Curry hoisted 7.7 per game and was the only player in the entire league to average at least seven. Care to guess how many players topped that threshold this season?  28.  There were 28 instances of something this season alone that had only happened a grand total of 28 times in NBA history prior to Curry's arrival.  Kids all over the world have spent the better part of the last decade emulating Curry in driveways, parks and gyms, a trend helped by the fact that Curry is about as physically relatable as any superstar in the history of the game. You can't just go in the driveway and uncork drop-step dunks. Or look in the mirror and pretend to be chiseled like LeBron. Even the famous tagline 'Be Like Mike' ignores the fact that it's utterly impossible to replicate the 6'6"" Air Jordan.  But anyone can heave as many off-balance 3s as humanly possible. Look no further than the NBA itself as James Harden, Damian Lillard, Kemba Walker, Trae Young and many others have followed in Curry's footsteps and leaned into the novel concept of 3 &gt; 2.  The 3-point revolution represents the biggest on-court strategic change in the history of the sport and there's no player more single-handed responsible for it than the original Splash Brother.  ""Seldom are game-changers idle."""
Especially when you're LeBron James. He has every right to be proud of himself. Fine line between a demanding perfectionist and a narcissist
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2755718-kevin-durant-says-michael-beasley-is-as-skilled-as-lebron-james  Dude I just read this !
"Nah you good, that's the first thing I came here to say.  No one can solve LeBron James. I'd be surprised if the Nuggets get past the Clippers again."
Isn‚Äôt it obvious? Most people are in their feelings. The Brooklyn Nets will easily win the NBA championship. LeBron James and Anthony Davis witnessed first hand  the monster Kevin Durant is in the playoffs.
"LeBron James was 6'2, 185 lbs in Freshman Year."
"Is this 911? Yes, it's LeBron James and I'm HURT.... emotionally, spiritually etc. Police presence is required!"
The folks at nbawowy have him at 70% TS in that lineup and like 54% TS in any other lineup so yes it helped. They only used it like 400 min though mostly a late game thing.   I think playing vs second units helped but he‚Äôs also playing with better talent this year and guys like LeBron James. At the end of the day he‚Äôs just shooting way worse on wide open 3s open 2s and catch and shoot 3s than last year just think last year was more just outlier shooting than his role being so much more difficult now. Pbp stats actually has his shot quality(which is their metric that says what a players expected eFG% should be based on a number of factors) as being better this year
"&gt; CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Security tossed a Cuyahoga Falls man out of Monday‚Äôs Cavaliers-Lakers game for holding up T-shirts with offensive slogans that targeted former Cavalier LeBron James, according to police reports.  &gt; The 49-year-old man was not arrested and no charges have been filed in the incident. James scored a season-high 46 points, including 21 in the final quarter, in the Lakers 115-108 win over the Cavs.  &gt; Cavs General Manager Kobe Altman and several team employees and players reported the fan to Rocket Mortgage Field House security, according to the police report released on Thursday. The report also said several Cavs‚Äô players complained that the fan was screaming obscenities.  &gt; The man held up t-shirts that read: ‚ÄúLeBron is a racist,‚Äù ‚ÄúLeBron is a narcissist,‚Äù ‚ÄúGloria Goes West. Starring LBJ as king narcissist‚Äù‚Äî an apparent reference to his mother Gloria James‚Äî and another one that contained a sexual innuendo.  &gt; A Cleveland police officer and arena security guards confronted the man in Section 126, behind one of the baskets on the lower level of the arena, and asked to see the shirts to determine if they violated the fan‚Äôs code of conduct.  &gt; **The man ‚Äúbecame extremely aggressive,‚Äù shouted at the officers and security guards and refused to show the shirt, according to police report.**  &gt; **The security guards told him he was kicked out. He continued shouting profanities, then lunged at the head security guard, grabbed her hands and hit her in the side, according to police.**  &gt; **The officers escorted him out of the arena. The man refused to leave and five times tried to run back into the stadium by trying to burrow his way through the guards and officers, according to police.**  &gt; An officer reported that he shoved the man to the ground the fourth try. A Cleveland police commander arrived and the man shouted at her. She told the man if he tried entering the building again that officers would arrest him for trespassing. The man yelled at the officers as he walked away.  Yep, sounds like plenty of reasons to get kicked out of the arena if you ask me."
"Yeah not everone can be LeBron James/Karl Malone and have MVP seasons in their late 30's. Actually those two are the only ones I can think of. It's unfortunate watching guys in their early 30' like Blake Griffin slowing down, but it happens."
"Both LeBron and KD took the easy way out, intending to get rings with few adversities as possible.   [LeBron James: ""Not 1... Not 2... Not 3...""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYe8B--jrbs)"
"Bro I said lebron was better can you read? Stay with me. Westbrook‚Äôs mental midgetry made him a huge liability and the heat ‚Äúsupporting cast‚Äù abused him and the rest of those brick layers Presti scrounged while sitting on his binder of assets. Lebron would not be able to redeem Westbrook then or now. They play the same position, lebron is just infinitely better and smarter. Sounds like a hyperbole but it‚Äôs not. And guess what, Wade was only SLIGHTLY worse than James.   So yeah, say lebron is better than KD. Miss the point entirely. I welcome it. It warms my heart to know I‚Äôm connecting with one of the people of the land. The common clay of the new west. You know, morons."
"[LeBron James: Not 1, not 2, not 3....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYe8B--jrbs)  I mean, KD took it to a new level. But let‚Äôs not get revisionist with the Heatles.  LeBron set a precedent for  KD to join a team with 2+ All-Stars to get easy rings."
"Lmao slow down. These dudes barely beat the Magic who: have lost 5 straight, are on the 2nd half of a back-to-back, missing 2 starters, and lost by 30 last night to the Celtics who were without Kemba or Tatum. KD and Steph won 2 championships together against Lebron James. Enjoy whatever you‚Äôre smoking but maybe slow your roll a bit lol"
"Ah, yes. As if being a lifelong Bucks fan adds any credence to your claim. I am a lifetime Lakers fan, that doesn‚Äôt matter.    What the fuck are you trying to say that he ‚Äúmost likely cannot contort his body as athletically as LeBron.‚Äù You then clarify this ‚Äòmost likely‚Äô statement by asserting that it is true ‚ÄúPoint blank period.‚Äù Would love to know how we measure a person‚Äôs ability to contort themselves athletically and why this nonsense attribute is the most important one when determining athleticism.    He absolutely has a faster first step than 36 year old LeBron. His first step allows him to take one dribble and dunk from the 3 point line with ease. LeBron does not possess that attribute anymore. Look at [this video](https://youtu.be/vWr5qbj5Jsc) where Giannis chases down Tatum for a chase down block despite Tatum catching the ball on the 3pt line while Giannis was at half court. He got there EASILY. Strength and lateral quickness I‚Äôll give you.    Overall, Giannis can currently definitively do many athletic feats than LeBron can definitively do. MAYNE an ‚Äòengaged LeBron James‚Äô could do some of these same things but he can‚Äôt just choose to be so engaged that he jumps higher than Giannis, explodes faster than Giannis, go down the court faster than Giannis, cover more distance laterally than Giannis, etc."
Lebron James will not join the Memphis Grizzlies.
I hate James Harden with a fiery passion but it would be nice to see someone compete with the Lakers this year rather than Lebron getting another lay down title from some eastern team that has no business being there to begin with.
Right. Like when KD faced the Rockets who were the best team in the league and the regular season and then faced LeBron fucking James in the finals.   LeBron played injured teams and barely got by.
"Yes he has a case but there's still no reason to doubt LeBron, especially in the playoffs. King James is still reigning until further notice."
"This IS Space Jam 2, starring James.   LeBron James. Harden plays for Moron Mountain"
He‚Äôs like a short Lebron James with a wet pull-up diaper
These mothafuckaz going to dominate watch. I just don't see a team with Harden and KD failing. Them Boyz cutthroat!  Kind of funny how LeBron 3 biggest haters ended up on the same team. They really been plotting on King James for the throne!
Well then the answer would be the Lakers because they have Lebron James lol.
Lebron James has never lost when he isn't facing superteams and his co stars are healthy. Insane.
"Don't know how credible it is, but [here](https://citiusmag.com/how-fast-can-lebron-james-run-a-mile/) they estimate Lebron at a 4:20 mile, which according to [this](https://www.milesplit.com/calc?time=+4%3A20&amp;event=1Mile) converts to 14:36 for 3 miles."
"I‚Äôm not, and you‚Äôre crazy if you think Giannis is the better athlete ‚Äî Giannis is in his athletic prime, and he‚Äôs still not touching a 36 year old LeBron James.  If you don‚Äôt see that, then you just don‚Äôt watch actual basketball games and probs only catch highlights.  I‚Äôm a lifelong Bucks fan.  LeBron is the superior athlete to Giannis. Giannis has not, will not, and likely cannot contort his body as athletically as LeBron. Point blank period. He is lanky af sure. He has nowhere near the starting sprint speed, chase down ability, strength, lateral speed, etc of an engaged LeBron James."
"Honestly the only real ""guaranteed"" finals appearances the past decade has been a LeBron James led team. Especially when he was out East."
Yes. 4 time NBA champion and 4 time FMVP LeBron James may have just figured it out in his 18th season.
"Oh fuck off  Not everyone gets their underperforming organization bailed out by lebron james because he wants to pursue media endeavors and add to his legacy in a place where he will get constant attention  One signing that made every laughable signing, draft pick, and trade go poof over night."
"Dame? For what?   Hardens nickname is hitler  What does derozan say? He just gets clowned for choking, same as PG except he isn‚Äôt obnoxious about it  What does Giannis say? Like I think you forgot what the whole point of why people dislike PG for this and just started naming dudes that get clowned.  Lebron James was the most hated athlete on the planet at one point, PG doesn‚Äôt get nearly the hate that he did.  I‚Äôm literally telling you why people dislike him, i don‚Äôt know why you have it in your head that it bothers me. The only one upset here is the instadownvoter lmao."
"Dame Lillard, James Harden, Demar Derozan, Giannis, what Kobe said before blowing 3-1 lead in 2007, Rudy Gobert. And hey guess who else? Lebron in 2011 after ‚ÄúNot one, not two, not three.‚Äù There‚Äôs seven right there  Now tell me why it bothers you so much every little thing PG says?"
"&gt;Have you actually watched any of the laker games?  Almost every one.  &gt;Correct me if I'm wrong, but sounds to me like you're simply going off of stats.   You are wrong.  &gt; THT hasn't really been playing his role or playing within the system.   This is contrary to the [public statements](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2020/12/22/22195892/lakers-frank-vogel-talen-horton-tucker-scoring-playmaking-skills-lebron-james) of Vogel, and several other Lakers.  &gt;I'd say a lot of his missed baskets are akin to TOs because of his very tunnel visioned play.   They are not.  Even a bad shot might go, and if it doesn't, Harrell -- usually on the court with Horton-Tucker -- is one of the best offensive rebounders in the league ( 3rd best ORB% ).  &gt; he needs to actually earn his playing time on this team.   He has."
"We always give credit to lebron for elevating his teammates its time that Harden get his credit for doing the same thing against the KD-warriors.  My post isn't about who's the better individual player. Its about who gave them the most trouble. You can't deny that Harden gave them the chills of actually losing a series. Not cavs, spurs, pelicans, trailblazers.  In 2018 playoffs in which we can say the best year for the warriors (talent wise), they lost 5 games in the entire playoffs. 3 of those is from the rockets. They didn't even lose 1 game to cavs (3 games decided by double digit margin)   Sometimes people forgot James Harden is getting doubled team more than Lebron in 2018 despite Harden had a better supporting cast back then.  Imagine if he had JR smith as teammate he is getting doubled way more."
Lebron james vs shao kahn is the movie we all really want to see
"Lebron and AD might give them both trouble if they are teammates but certainly Lebron isn't really as big of a trouble to the KD-warriors era compare to James Harden.  I know I'm gonna get downvoted but James Harden put up the biggest fight against the KD-warriors (excluding the 2019 finals where KD only play for 1 quarter).   Harden made me think that team might actually be beatable. Lebron didn't, he won 1 game against them in the playoffs.   He played great but didn't actually gave them real ""trouble"""

I'm talking about him completely *checking out*. Not the same thing. Kobe was awful in his inefficiency but he would leave it all on the floor. He played from tip to buzzer. Harden didn't do that. You can't blame Tillman for that. We had Vince Carter, he totally checked out &amp; forced his way out of Toronto. The moment he got to the Nets, he went back to being a monster on the court. His *on-court* behaviour is why so many Raps fans are against him &amp; against the idea of him retiring a Raptor (which isn't an issue now) or him getting a statue. *Vince Carter gave up on the team* ***on the court***. That's the biggest sin. Just look all that Lebron has done &amp; you'll still hear about how he checked out in the playoffs during his last run with the Cavs before he jumped ship to Miami. That shit will stick to him forever.  If you're upset with management or ownership or whatever, fine, but you don't sabotage the team by just giving up.  &gt;""over the past five years Harden has shot less than 25 percent from the 3-point line in playoff fourth quarters and overtimes.""  [He didn't even take a shot in the 4th quarter](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/james-hardens-disappearing-act-in-another-playoff-fourth-quarter-is-so-on-brand-its-painful-to-watch/) last season.

"Didn't Lebron just make TIME's Athlete of the Year and Top 100 list? Even living in a fairly rural area of the US I know people who unironically refer to him as King James. That shit's more than a nickname to a lot of people. The idea he is ""by far"" the most hated couldn't be more off."
LeBron MFKN James!
Lebron james is on coke
Oh. And they also have lebron James.
I counter you with this trade.   Lakers get: Josh Green  Mavs get: Lebron James and AD
I think that 2018 playoff series where he went head to head with LeBron James for a couple of games really changed him.
So I‚Äôll just go with the 3 advanced stats I will list every time since 2000 someone was in the top 3 in all of the advanced stats  2019-2020 Giannis DPOY  2018-2019 Giannis 1st Team  2016-2017 Draymond DPOY  2015-2016 Kawhi DPOY  2013-2014 Joakim Noah DPOY  2010-2011 Kevin Garnett 1st Team  2009-2010 Dwight Howard DPOY  2008-2009 Lebron James 1st Team  2007-2008 Kevin Garnett DPOY  2006-2007 Tim Duncan 1st Team Ben Wallace 2nd Team  2005-2006 Ben Wallace DPOY  2003-2004 Kevin Garnett 1st team  Tim Duncan 1st Team Ben Wallace 2nd Team  2002-2003 Ben Wallace DPOY  2001-2002 Ben Wallace DPOY  This feat has been achieved in the last 14 years 9 of those times that person won DPOY  Every time the person made 1st team unless someone at their position also was top 3 in all of the advanced defensive stats  In summary if the season ended today historically speaking myles turner would at least be on the first team
Breitbart headline: Lebron James Quits Coke
1. Jokic     2. LeBron 3. CP3  4. Ben Simmons 5. James Harden 6. Luka  7a. Lamelo Ball 7b. Lonzo Ball  9. Domas Sabonis 10. Dame Lillard  HM: Facundo
"That's pretty much what they were saying. It's not that you go ""you know what I should listen to what Lebron James says I should drink"" rather you see a commercial for Sprite Cranberry with Lebron and after that you're more likely to think ""you know what I want a Sprite Cranberry"" or when you're in the gas station ""that Sprite Cranberry looks good"".   For the most part nobody is actually going ""Lebron likes this so I should buy it"". It's just that he's a useful or compelling vehicle to transmit the message that Sprite Cranberry exists. And then people are more likely to buy it.   So if your problem is with advertising in general then sure we can have a discussion. But if your problem like Dave's joke above (and it's a joke so I assume he's doing it primarily for laughter and not because he seriously believes it) is that people listen to celebrities too much you're off the mark because that's not what's happening by and large."
Bro he did the James Harden and purposefully tried to land on the defenders feet so it looks like a foul. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm against gaming the system I‚Äôm just calling it like I see it. And Draymond really didn‚Äôt try to kick lebron in the balls in the finals but he did it to okc so the refs had two for one punishing draymond and helping the face of the league stay in the series.
LeBron James still good at basketball confirmed.
LeBron James and Wilt Chamberlain are both 4x MVPs with putrid Free Throw shooting. And there's also Shaq who had 1 MVP but should have probably had more
"Meanwhile, i‚Äôm watching the Lakers steam roll the Pelicans for another blowout win. 30 assists to 5 TOs and 10 steals with like 5 minutes left of garbage time. Seriously, the Lakers are playing like the 14 Spurs but with the likely DPOY in AD and LeBron fucking James that swishes threes at a 40% clip.   As a Lakers/Bulls fan, the Lakers are making it easier to numb the pain man."
LeBron James made all his free throws
Lebron James.
Lebron James 3900. Years old
Its like every time she keeps talking about the leadership of Lebron James. Shes not wrong obviously but she overpronounces and elongates every syllable to add emphasisüòÇ
"Yes LeBron James, your Queen"
Shaquille O'Neal and Rajon Rondo  Nikola Jokic and Richard Jefferson  Muggsy Bogues and Vince Carter  Michael Jordan and Kwame Brown  Shawn Marion and LeBron James

"&gt;But instead of answering, you dodge the whole thought experiment.   The problem is that your ""thought experiment"" was the actual dodge. The argument was about showing up. Because you are trying to trap me into your comically narrow logic I will now answer the question to continue your ""thought experiment."" Yes. Chris Paul is better than Kyle Lowry.   Maybe the problem is here that we have different definitions of ""showing up."" To me showing up means playing to your ability. At work today I would say I didn't completely show up because I found out my friend died yesterday. I was at work but my mind wasn't.  I explained this before but when I say James Harden doesn't show up in the playoffs, I'm saying the edge he bring into the regular season is not there.   I pulled a stat specific to this conversation. It's a little random but bare with me. I tracked a bunch of stars that won championships to see how many playoff games they played where they shot less than 25% field goal percentage to show you an example of how much more frequently James Harden has a bad game in the playoffs. In no way am I saying this is a perfect stat but one factor in winning is obviously consistency.   I will list them ranked from least consistent to most consistent and you can tell me if it's a good indicator of greatness in any way.  Kawhi Leonard 3 times in 124 Magic Johnson 4 times in 190 Lebron James 3 times in 260  Larry Bird 2 times in 164 Michael Jordan 1 time in 179  At this time you are probably saying to yourself that these are all mid range shooters. Lets look at some 3 point shooters.  Kyrie Irving 5 times in 61 Damien Lillard 3 times in 55 Klay Thompson 6 times in 123 Steph Curry 4 times in 112  Kevin Durant 3 times in 139  There were definitely a bunch of players that were more inconsistent than Harden but I am only putting exceptional players because Harden gets regular season awards for being exceptional.  The amount of times Harden has shot less than 25% fg%: 14 times in 128 games. That's a lot more.  You want me to go into true shooting percentage and how great an indicator that is? He is below all the active players I listed that won a title as well.   He simply isn't a great playoff player and it takes being great to win.  You pointing out a couple specific games is completely missing the point. I never said he has never played well in the playoffs."
"I think his point is that the BKN FO has proven itself competent enough that -- unlike the post-LeBron Cavs -- the Nets likely wouldn't become a total dumpster fire even if all the stars left in their option years. BKN would find some sneaky solid guys in the G League; eat some salaries of guys who are still OK, just overpaid; get some picks that way and get some decent draftees; be well-coached; be in the East; etc., the end result being that they'd suck, but they'd suck in a 12th-pick-in-the-draft way rather than being a favorite for one of those guaranteed top 5 spots. So HOU ends up coming out of it with a Sekou Doumbouya, a Jaxson Hayes, a couple Ty Jeromes, and a Mfiondu Kabengele... for James fucking Harden."
"&gt;The guy was late to camp  COVID Protocol  &gt;partying instead with videos posting to social media  fair  &gt;played below his standard after the first few games  44, 34, 33 in his first three games.  &gt;was publicly badmouthing teammates.  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/06/07/lebron-james-says-he-left-cavaliers-because-they-werent-talented-enough-wont-say-whether-this-team-is/"
LeBron James + Pepsi are both icons for social justice.   ... s/
"&gt;Kyle Lowry  Kyle Lowry doesn't tell his teammates they aren't good enough. Also the conversation was about showing up to the playoffs. Also, Kyle Lowry has a 3 point shooting percentage of 41% when facing elimination over his career. Harden is at 34.6%. Lol. Below average. You may say that's a cherry picked stat but you can compare various stats when it counts. Harden doesn't SHOW UP.  &gt;Again moving the goal-posts. Now to ""show-up"" in the playoffs, you have to lead the league in playoff PPG?   No. You really just don't understand. Winners take over the game when it counts. James Harden is very much like Pandemic P in that his numbers go down in the playoffs and they go down a lot when games are on the line.   Players like Jordan, KD, Lebron, Steph, Leonard, Tim Duncan they turn it up, play more minutes, know they are going to be the focus of the other team and still find ways to dominate the game   Harden's performance when it counts is straight bad. In the past 5 years he has shot 25% from the 3 point line in the 4th quarter and overtime in the playoffs.  The problem is that every year Harden chokes in the playoffs and then a bunch of ""casuals"" forget part way through the season because they didn't watch him in the playoffs.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/james-hardens-disappearing-act-in-another-playoff-fourth-quarter-is-so-on-brand-its-painful-to-watch/  https://www.sbnation.com/2017/3/31/15134562/james-harden-clutch-stats-history-mvp-rockets  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-an-undrafted-rookie-stopped-james-harden-in-the-playoffs/  I gave you actual evidence. If I am the casual and you aren't you will come back with really solid evidence of Harden coming up big in the playoffs.  Good luck with that."
[Lebron said the same thing and no one cared](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/06/07/lebron-james-says-he-left-cavaliers-because-they-werent-talented-enough-wont-say-whether-this-team-is/)
hot take: the best thing lebron james can do for poor kids in the hood isn't BLM but telling them to stop putting junk inside their body
"&gt;LeBron did everything for Cleveland and got nothing in return except for a washed up Shaq and Ben Wallace. The Rockets did everything for Harden and he told them to go fuck themselves.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a prime example of revisionist history and shifting goal posts.  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/06/07/lebron-james-says-he-left-cavaliers-because-they-werent-talented-enough-wont-say-whether-this-team-is/  &gt;The Rockets did everything for Harden and he told them to go fuck themselves  Yeah, trading for a 36 year old point guard with injury issues, and then trading him for a player who is a bad fit, (who also got injured in the playoffs)  Their situations are the exact same, whether you like it or not"

I love how Coke said they mutually decided to part ways. In what universe is it a good decision for you to not have Lebron James endorsing your brand and to go to your direct competitor? ü§®
"&gt; They were an awkward fall away from putting away the GOAT team and going on to likely beat LeBron James in a minimal amount of games.  Lebron swept a team that almost won 60 games, nothing was a lock"
No KD is 100% better then Kawhi. I mean the only other player I‚Äôd rather have then him is LeBron James
I think we should take it a step further. They were an awkward fall away from putting away the GOAT team and going on to likely beat LeBron James in a minimal amount of games.
LeBron said the same thing essentially https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/06/07/lebron-james-says-he-left-cavaliers-because-they-werent-talented-enough-wont-say-whether-this-team-is/
Lebron James is quitting coke...LeRehab
I first read this as Lebron James stopping doing cocaine and I thought it was a great explanation for all those Taco Tuesday vids
"You might actually be right or Keldon might be close to it. I started listing some of the best SFs in the league and there's a pretty big drop off once you get past Ingram or DeRozan level: Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Paul George, LeBron James, Brandon Ingram, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Khris Middleton, Bojan Bogdanavic, DeMar DeRozan, Michael Porter Jr., Malik Beasley, TJ Warren, OG Anunoby  I'm sure I'm forgetting some guys but I was thinking that the SF position was much deeper than that."
"I mean even the worst person on this sub could probably cherry pick layups every possession. Just stand on the block and wait for lebron James to throw you a pin point pass and then lay it off the glass.  I‚Äôm by no means arguing someone here would make a positive contribution on the court, but just having someone hack a bad free throw shooter or cherry pick is better than having literally no one I would think"
PG: Steph Curry   SG: Michael Jordan  PF: LeBron James  SF: Kevin Durant  C: Shaq
"Their worst matchups in my opinion are the Lakers, Bucks, Clippers and Sixers (in that order) and theres a world where they have to face 3 of these teams in one playoff run. Their biggest problem, at least in my opinion, is rim protection so its important to look at the teams that will feast at the rim.  The Lakers will absolutely be able to feast against the Nets at the rim and it gets even worse when you think about the minutes where they will have to have a backup center in the game going up against Monrezl Harrell. Can you really trust a guy like Claxton against not only Harrell but against the other players coming off the bench for the Lakers. Not to mention that Lebron/AD will be playing most of the game and theres nobody on the team that can defend AD at all. Tough matchup for the Nets and I feel that they would have a better time in next years playoffs if its against the Nets.  On the Bucks it is entirely possible that Jrue, Giannis, and Khris work together to contain James or Kyrie and negate some of the guard offense that Brooklyn will be reliant on, but even if they don't there isn't anyone on the team who can stop Giannis. They're going to have to build an even tighter wall than we've ever seen and this will allow Middleton and Holiday to put up big numbers. This is a series where Deandre Jordan could foul out easily in every single game and leave the Nets scrambling for extra paint defense. Honestly an incredibly tough matchup, but one where I can see the Nets coming out on top because of their absolutely insane offensive potential.  The Clippers have as ideal of a lineup as you can ask for against a team with an elite offensive PG, SG, and forward. Beverley, PG, and Kawhi on Kyrie, Harden, and Durant is about as good as you're going to find in the league and with a guy like Serge Ibaka backing them up that's going to at least present a bigger challenge for the Nets than 95% of teams can present. The issue with the Clippers is honestly the same with the Nets. Both teams are going to be reliant on guys who disappear in the playoffs, guys who are prone to injury and on a team with guys who understand the heaps of pressure being put on them. The Clippers and Lakers being the two western favorites is pretty much the least ideal situation Brooklyn could ask for.  The 76ers are basically the anti-Nets. They're super defensive and play above the rim. Theres a world where Simmons is on KD, and then you figure the rest out from there, with Embiid locking up the paint. Who can guard Embiid on this team? This is a series where Dwight Howard can actually put up 10 pts, 10 rebs off the bench and Shake can average 13-16 ppg off the bench. I would bet the house on the Nets winning this series but there is a world where we see the Sixers looking completely unstoppable at the rim.  I would bet on the Nets getting to the finals and losing, then looking better next year after getting more front court depth."
PG: Steph Curry   SG: Michael Jordan  PF: Lebron James  SF: Larry Bird   C: Shaq
"If Lebron had the team and coach James Harden had he would‚Äôve beaten the 2017 and 2018 Warriors. Lebron had a garbage team and a horrible coach, every single year Lebron had to carry his team on his back and lead them to the finals."
Unless you are LeBron James of course.
James harden needs to be looked at the same way people looked at Lebron and KD when they left their teams to create superteam
"I never said that, woj wouldve just said kyrie is cleared to play rather than expected to play. You see the difference? Everyone makes mistakes, lebron james has turnovers each game, nice try smart ass"
"I don‚Äôt agree with Shaq here entirely. One he never had talent on par with what Shaq got to work with during his championship runs, full stop. He wasn‚Äôt gifted the best teams during his time in Houston but contended most every year.  Dwight couldn‚Äôt advance with a Lakers super team, having him as a #2 option in a Western conference that featured the Spurs, Warriors, Clippers, Grizzlies, etc and not winning a title is considered a black mark on Harden‚Äôs career?   I don't think so, not to mention without CP3 playing Harden took Golden State‚Äôs super team, considered the greatest of all time and insurmountable by even King James, to 7 games.   Houstonians have every right to be irritated with Harden‚Äôs off the court antics, they can even criticize performances where he faltered in the clutch. But I don‚Äôt think he ever had enough help, nothing comparable to say Curry, KD, Kawhi, or Lebron, to say he‚Äôs not a legendary player."
"That‚Äôs cool and all but idrc when it‚Äôs not even a quality post. Rank these players for me jusuf nurkic, Emoni baites, snoop dogg, Kevin hart, lebron James, and isiah Thomas?? You see how dumb these posts look"
Bc he is not fkin Lebron James. Why do ppl complicate shit?
"I'm going to say the same thing I said when Kawhi and the Clippers and bron stans were asking for the same level of slander Bron would get, Lebron James is in completely another tier to every player in the current generation. He is in the GOAT conversation and yes he has been over scrutinize. Basically you cannot expect the same level of scrutiny over this players because they are not as good."
&gt;Why doesn't James Harden get the same scrutiny that Lebron gets?  He gets more scrutiny than Lebron these days.  Are we pretending that Harden has received no criticism for his playoff eliminations?
"Because no one tries to argue that James Harden is a better basketball player than Michael Jordan.  If LeBron stans would stop crying and whining about how it's unfair he's not the goat and use crazy mental gymnastics to make their cases he'd be a lot less scrutinized. If people put him in the Kobe, Magic, Bird instead of the MJ tier he'd be a lot less scrutinized."
Not if it's Lebron James who's fucking Lebron James.
Idk maybe cause one is fucking LeBron James and the other one isn‚Äôt?
And 36 year old LeBron James still manages to be the best player in the world. He really is built different.
"Really? I remember him being a key part of the ""defensive minded"" celtics lineups of Rondo, Tony Allen, Pierce, Garnett and Perkins, he wasn't the best defender, and he wasnt elite, but he was good enough to guard lebron james to a bunch of shitty games. (not calling him a lebron stopper by any means)"
"Luka may have the better career in 10 years, but you clearly havent watched pierce a day in your life lol, dude was legit the 2nd best SF behind lebron james for like 7 years."
"Just casually ignoring that Pierce went against Lebron James his entire career for first team, thats some cherry picking right there.  ""well paul pierce was worse than lebron, therefore he is worse than doncic""....ok."
I swear they are all Lebron Hate Bots. Like someone has set up a bot-farm specifically to reply to every mention of the word ‚ÄúLebron‚Äù on Twitter and hate on Lebron James. It is so classless.
"I mean I personally don't see anything wrong with the yelp reviews. It was his name and reputation that was going to make money for that place not a world renowned chef and his/her culinary abilities. If you were going to make money because of your name, it's totally okay for you to no longer make money because of your name if you are no longer one of the town's heroes. I have no problem with fans expressing their frustrations as long as it's not violent and certain other lines are not crossed. Burning jerseys are fine because they paid for that jersey and now they are choosing to burn it. As long as you don't threaten people on twitter or talk shit about their family and things like that, fans should be allowed to express their disappointment. Why the fuck should Rockets fans thank James Harden? What is there to thank for? Fucking memories? He won an individual award while there and he gets to keep it while going to Brooklyn, it's not like he's leaving trophies behind and all that.  My point wasn't about certain fanbases being better than others. My point was, if the player meets or exceeds the expectations of the franchise, if there isn't any unfinished business; then the backlash ends up being very insignificant and even if people are hurt inside they still say thanks and take the high road and shit. My point was that it's different for different players not different for different fanbases. One fanbase can have two different reactions to two different players on their team. Hell, Cavs fans had two different reactions to LeBron alone with his first stint and second stint.   The fact that there is this big of a response shows the level of disappointment. That levels of disappointment and anger stems from love. Houston loved Harden. And to be fair he loved the city back too. Sometimes you just gotta move on.   Harden acted like a dickhead because Houston were still not willing to deal him before the past 2 days. He had to take things to point of no return, the way Jimmy did with Minnesota. So I can understand his actions as well, when despite making it clear he wanted a trade, Houston still dismissed those requests and said James is fine, we'll be fine once we get to play, bla bla bla. There is always a huge difference between each individual case."
"Well that's just you being disingenuous IMO, his team was at a massive talent disadvantage, and the only reason they had a chance in that series was because of Harden, he was the only shot creator on that team once CP3 went down, and the other 2 team had 2 MVPs, and another 20+ PPG scorer in Klay, arguably the best 3rd option of all-time (well until now with this Nets team...).   Harden is just a worse version of LeBron. LeBron always lost to better teams, until he stacked the deck and made the best team and won championships. Even the Finals he's lost in 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, he gets a pass for because again, he lost to better teams and nobody rightfully holds that against them because there's an acknowledgement of the talent disadvantage he was at.   KD lost to better teams in 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2016, until he stacked the deck in his favor and won championships.  You say LeBron took GS without Kyrie and Love to 6, and yeah, he did, but he didn't actually win that series and he was horribly inefficient. Does anybody *blame* him for that? No. Nobody sane does.   Harden took the 2019 Warriors to 6 with a decrepit Chris Paul who was useless for the first 5 games of that series, and yet somehow he gets blame for that? That series was INSANELY close, 2-2 after the first 4 games, with none of the games in that series being decided by more than 6 points. If you want to argue that he could've done better once KD went out, sure, but if anything that proves what every sane basketball fan believes, which is that Steph Curry &gt; James Harden. Klay Thompson was also a better #2 option than CP3 was at that time given his injuries, so again, he was at a talent disadvantage.   Point is, that Harden has never lost to any team where he was the favorite, where he had the better team. Now, you can argue that's what makes you a truly great player in this league.   However, has Kevin Durant done that before? Has Kawhi Leonard done that before?  Hell, has LeBron done that before?   It's really, really fucking hard to win a championship, which is why these superstars just stack the deck in their favor to try and increase the odds. The NBA has never been more like Game of Thrones than it is right now."
"was I wrong?  you are a textbook bandwagon fan. you're beginning to support another team because your guy now plays for them. That's what LeBron fans do, and nobody takes them seriously.  my favorite player was Kawhi Leonard, and I was probably his biggest dickrider of all time. I got to see him get drafted, develop as a player over watching hundreds of games, win Finals MVP and back-to-back DPOYs - but I'm not about to start rooting for the fucking Clippers. Fuck that dude.  How can you continue to support a guy that forced his way out of 'your team', while players that are still playing for 'your team' are calling him out on his shit?  I literally watched James Harden completely give up against the Spurs in 2017. dude accomplished nothing for the Rockets, unless you want to call a regular season MVP and shitting the bed in numerous playoff series an 'accomplishment'. at least Kawhi contributed to our 2014 championship.  and lmao you have a Nets flair on but are speaking as if you're a Rockets fan. how can you not see what's wrong with that? People are gonna be confused.  John Wall plays for your team now, and he's a great player and an awesome person. How about sticking to backing that guy?  and you can still like James Harden. You do you. but that doesn't mean you need to become a Nets supporter."

"Yes because PPG is the end all be all of a player, quoting that implies nothing about your basketball knowledge. Basketball has two ends of the court dude. Kawhi is an all time great defender (evident by his DPOY in his first five years)  and if you actually watched him in games that MATTER you would have saw him play crucial minutes on defense against PEAK LeBron James in the NBA fucking Finals.   Not to mention the Spurs teams on which Kawhi played in that time frame were objectively more successful than the Thunder, and some of the best teams of all time. You‚Äôre a clown who thinks because he can google box scores that he can pretend he‚Äôs an avid fan."
"There‚Äôs point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center. With that being said, basketball has become a lot more positionless nowadays because of switching and spacing. Now it‚Äôs basically a point guard, three wing players, and a center. The best point guard is Steph Curry, the best shooting guard is James Harden, the best small forward is Lebron, the best power forward is Giannis(imo), and the best center is Embiid(imo)"
LeBron James? 8 straight finals.
"Just so I cam understand how insane you are, this is presumably a draft that includes both Lebron James and Michael freaking Jordan?"
"I don't mean to be a dick, but where were you getting that stat of Shaq scoring over 29 points per 75 posessions on a +4% relative TS% in the playoffs? Because it appears to be wrong, and you've yet to post a link to it.  Shaq only got over 29 two times, in 1997 and 1998. And looking at the league average TS%, Shaq beat it by 1.6% in 1997 and 8% in 1998. So it looks like he only did this once in his entire career.  For comparison Jordan got over 29 points per 75 posessions in the playoffs a ridiculous 12 times, and was 4% better than the league average TS% an equally ridiculous 7 times.  Looks like LeBron got over 29 pts 4 times and 4% better TS 3 of those seasons. And those were all pre-Miami. In the seasons after he has around 8 near misses on the 29 pts, but on much better TS% and really high assist totals.  Kevin Durant got over 29 pts 2 times and was easily 4% better than the league average both times.  James Harden got over 29 pts 3 times and was 4% better once.  So even if you want to chuck out the regular season, Box Plus/Minus, Win Shares, RAPTOR, Offensive Rating and everything else in favor of this insanely narrow 29 points per 75 posessions on a 4% better relative TS%, it looks like Shaq only did it once, while Jordan did it 7 times, LeBron did it 3 times, and KD did it twice."
Lebron James?
"You are being a dumbass all over this thread.  He lost to the WARRIORS. In game 7. He would literally have a ring if he didn‚Äôt face the greatest NBA team ever assembled. He played better against them in comparison to every other player besides lebron james.  How did Dame do against them? Is he a selfish player? He doesn‚Äôt have an assist title does he, and certainly doesn‚Äôt have as many assists.  Harden never hurt his team. In the game where they were eliminated against the Lakers, he scored more than the rest of the rockets starters COMBINED. The team simply doesn‚Äôt cut it."
"Superstars in baseball have little value because they don‚Äôt impact the game on the same level.   In the playoffs Lebron James plays 90% of the game, playing offence and defence, while being responsible for over 1/2 the offence.   It doesn‚Äôt really matter how good you are at baseball, you are still only going to get 4ish opportunities on offence, and defensively you play a part of the field (assuming you do play).   Baseball just isn‚Äôt a sport that 1 player makes a huge difference in, where basketball is basically the epitome of that."
"LeBron ""Runaway MVP favorite"" James has never shaped a narrative before.   I will always say the most impactful thing he did to win Cleveland's title was get on TV and say ""the NBA will not suspend Draymond Green."" Basically daring them not to suspend him lol. One of the smartest things I've ever seen an NBA player do and I respect it."
[https://www.nba.com/news/kyrie-irving-called-lebron-james-apologize](https://www.nba.com/news/kyrie-irving-called-lebron-james-apologize)  You're combining two different situations
LeBron James
Can we all agree that Jeff Green is the LeBron James of role players
"Sure but when his notable failures include putting CJ Miles on Kevin Love, benching James Johnson when we needed defense, under using PJ, overusing Lou, I'm comfortable saying Casey is a bad coach.  Vogel isn't as good as Spolestra probably, but  If you can manage the egos, coaching a Lebron team is butter so not super fair to compare.   The Bucks do have a lot of issues outside of Bud but his decision making is questionable to down right baffling at times, to the point I wouldn't really trust him outside the first round."
We dont know that lakers are still capable af without AD .. they have lebron james lmao..And loaded debth
wow [LAL] LeBron James is a cowboys fan? who would have guessed
"There will be a highlight thread of James Harden at the top of r/nba tomorrow, like Lebron and Steph right guys? Right??"

"Am I talking about mma or football. Stay on topic . Mma takes years of skill development. Running fast, running routes and catching balls don't take as much time to learn especially WHEN HE HAS ALREADY PLAYED FOOTBALL GROWING UP.   &gt;Before LeBron James ever began his ascent to basketball immortality, he was a kid first known for his football abilities. He was a quarterback who surprised people with his basketball abilities when he started playing at eight years old.  &gt;For the first two years of high school, James considered the possibility of playing football in college. After his unforgettable high school football debut, he became the star of the Fighting Irish, catching 42 passes for 752 yards and 11 touchdowns during his sophomore year, earning all-state honors.  Now show me the times he practiced fighting growing up or shut the fuck up."
"The team with LeBron James. We are right on schedule, another month and we will talk about how this team doesn‚Äôt fit and doesn‚Äôt have enough"
we didn't bend over backwards for him more than any other team caters to its star/stars (as we saw with the kawhi/pg13 articles this offseason and as i'm sure cleveland/LAL have done for lebron).  i don't know why people think trading for good players is catering to james harden.
Neither of which is on par with lebron james
"Ofc, otherwise LeBron James would be dominating the charts."
Zion Williamson: 64.7% Lebron James:59.7%  That's a massive difference and the reason why Zion is a better offensive player than Lebron
"LeBron will not win MVP.   Not only does the team need to reach the top seed the majority of the time to win MVP, in the past 5 seasons the MVP was #1 in PER. Also the last 10 MVP out of the past 12 seasons, the MVP was #1 in PER (only Curry #3 in '15, and Rose #9 in 2011), however, Curry and Rose's team led the entire NBA in wins that year.    Lebron James is currently #17 in PER being 7 full points behind #1 Joel Embiid. Joel Embiid and Lebron James have the same odds of winning MVP based on Vegas bookmakers at +1000. Embiid is a far better pick than Lebron.   The last time a person won with a PER ranking worse than the top 10, was Steve Nash both in 2005 and 2006 (PER 17 and PER 14)."
All I see when reading this comment is you repeating LeBron James three times.
"&gt;Lebron and AD are simply better than all of them combined  James is irrelevant in that context -- they simply signed him.  They could have had a lineup like:  Ball, James, Ingram, Randle, Zubac with Kuzma, Clarkson, Caruso, Nance, Russell, Hart, Wagner, Hunter, and Horton-Tucker off the bench.  That team wins a lot of games, and maybe a ring.  James has won with less.  They'd also be deep enough to be impervious to injury, other than to James.  Any other player goes out with, say, Achilles tendonosis, and it wouldn't be a big deal."
Jarrett Allen: 70.8%  Lebron James: 59.7%  That's a massive difference and the reason why Allen is a better offensive player than Lebron
man I always loved this commercial [Lebron James to the Browns](https://youtu.be/SvmALPg9Cmk)
Bruh how disconnected from reality do you have to be to consider LeBron James *maybe* top 30 lmao
I feel bad about all the big ol women sucking all the air out of the arena down there. Almost killed LeBron James yall almost killed the best player in the world
"I think the people citing the Lebron James block have a good argument. Game 7 in the finals, tie game with a little more than a minute to go in regulation.   Can't fathom on the other suggestions though. The Ray Allen shot was very nice imo but I'd take other moments from the 80s and 90s over it."
"&gt; i think so, but i think the same for all top-10 level guys.  I remember Joakim Noah was top 5 in mvp voting one year. A lot of it is based on narrative. I have little doubt that Luka will win MVP one day because of how much volume stats he puts up and how great of coaching his team has.   &gt;a range or level you think luka actually is vs. what people think he is?  Last year Luka started with like 60% TS and the Mavs were like a middle of the road playoff seed team at the very start of the year. His reputation immadetly went to a top 5 MVP player and he carried a lot of that reputation for most of the year despite his efficiency cooling down and his team going down the rankings. His stock is lower than this point of the season last year. The Idea that Trae may be a comparable player wasn't even entertained but this year at least it is discussed. However, the Mavs got on a slight tear where Luka did amazing recently. I think prior to this year people thought he was a top 5 player but he is like a top 12ish player. I think he is considerably worse than those players who can play both sides of the ball like Kawhi, Lebron, Giannis, and Embiid, and he is also worse than those players that can both play make and shoot well like Steph Curry and Damian Lillard. I think he is closer to Kyrie Irving than he is to James Harden in terms of how good he is."
"Why do people say this shit lmfao. If either of LeBron James or Anthony Davis weren't on the team, the Lakers wouldn't have won the championship and this point is moot."
"&gt;Lakers really have the most unfair advantage in the league. The most preferred free agent destination for players(rich people)  This is largely a myth.  Very little of the Lakers' dominance is due to free agent acquisitions.  There's LeBron James and Shaquille O'Neal, but to-date, those two only combine for 10 seasons in Purple-and-Gold -- and only five of those seasons are noteworthy here -- and both of those guys were not shy about signing with other teams too.  On the list of best-Laker-free-agent signings, you reach Kurt Rambis a lot faster than anyone would think.  The Lakers drafted Magic Johnson, Jerry West, James Worthy, George Mikan, Elgin Baylor, Vern Mikkelson, AC Green, Clyde Lovellette, Gail Goodrich, Norm Nixon, Michael Cooper, Vlade Divac, Nick Van Exel, Jim McMillian, Derek Fisher, Andrew Bynum, Marc Gasol, and many others.  Plus K.C. and Sam Jones who declined to play for them and went on to win 8 and 5 titles in Boston.  The Lakers traded for Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kobe Bryant, Byron Scott, Anthony Davis, Pau Gasol, Bob McAdoo, and a raft of others.  Want to win like the Lakers?  Draft and trade like they do, and players will want to play for your team, too."
I mean if you compare them to a team like Utah I think you're making them sound worse than they are. Of course AD was out which is a big fucking deal.  But even then Utah allows 47.9 pts in the paint and the Lakers at 49.2.  Jazz hold opponents to eFG% of 49.9 and the Lakers 51.2. lakers also average more blocks and steals and less PF.   The Lakers are middle of the pack in 3p%  I don't like Lebron but you're making the Lakers sound way worse than they are.  And I was gonna compare it to the nuggets but idk if I'm stupid or something I cannot find the stats for the nuggets lol but I did try. Idc if the Lakers barely make the playoffs and are playing like complete shit. There is two people I will never bet against in sports (minus the obvious against the OP warriors lol) Tom Brady and Lebron James come playoff time.
"Jordan, KD, Kobe, Steph, Harden. HMs: LeBron James, Karl Malone. Jordan was exquisite. If you watched him in his prime, you remember. He was the MVP every year. KD is unreal. With MJ/Kobe effort from the beginning of his career (more assertive, killer instinct), he could have made a case for best ever. Probably won‚Äôt by this point. Kobe was exquisite. His prime was filthy, and it lasted for years. Steph. During GS‚Äôs insane run, Steph (and Klay) sat the fourth quarter for weeks at a time. When you‚Äôre up 30-35 points going into the fourth every night, it demonstrates just how potent Steph and that team was. Imagine if they played him 6-8 minutes more per night during that run. We‚Äôd be having ‚ÄúHarden‚Äù discussions about Steph. Harden. When he‚Äôs not drawing contact, manipulating the rules, making the rule ‚Äúwork for him‚Äù, when he‚Äôs just straight balling, he‚Äôs amazing. But I can‚Äôt get behind his style. And I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the only one who thinks this way. It‚Äôs not hate, I promise. I recall him playing well into games where he had no business being in. The coaching staff would put him back in up 18-20 points to ‚Äúget to 30‚Äù. That‚Äôs whack. Style matters. Presence matters. Hopefully his Nets run is more like he‚Äôs been recently. I‚Äôve enjoyed watching him of late.  LeBron‚Äôs offense the last several years, on top of  his assist/rebound dominance, is really beginning to shift my opinion of best ever. I think he‚Äôs going to have to retire for me to take an objective look. He‚Äôs adding to his case every night. Karl Malone from 88 to 98 was a monster. 51% career FG%. Career 25/10. Played for 60 years...fuhgetuhboutit."
"&gt;  he's a top 5 playmaker who can carry an offense  Even as a rookie he had a higher USG% than most PG's in history and it higher than any year of CP3, Steve Nash, Stockton, and Magic Johnson. In addition he has super high uncontested rebounding Westbrook style. He gets a ton of volume stats. He is a top 5 playmaker in the league, but I would rather have a great playmaker that has &gt;60% TS like Jokic or Lillard. Or I would rather have a worse playmaker that does other elite things like score and defend really well. Considering how much credit he gets for carrying his team, he has always had very mediocre on/off number and even this year where he has had bad team he doesn't improve them as much as you would expect given his reptuation. Like those PHX Steve Nash years, the team would go from bad to elite when he was on. Lebron James has been pretty much the same his whole career even on those terrible Cavs teams."
"&gt;So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that  Lol"
"&gt;But Steph is an S-tier character while he has the ball and is also S-tier without it  What? S-Tier typically means the best you can possibly be, and he isn't on that Lebron or Harden level of offensive talent on ball. His passing, while good, is nowhere near theirs. Nor is his ability to break down opposing defenses on ball. He can't be rated S-tier at something he both does not do very often (hence the surge after Draymond returned) nor does at the level of the actual S-Tier players.  &amp;#x200B;  And right now, Harden is playing with Kevin fucking Durant and Kyrie Irving and it's still better for him to be on ball than anyone else on the team. He's averaging the most assists in the NBA by a lot while putting up a very efficient scoring season. You can't hold what he does off ball against him when the only person in the NBA that might be better than him on ball is Lebron James. It's just not an indictment on him that he's so good at running an offense.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Harden himself awknowleged you can't really win playing that kind of hero-ball  This is a mischaracterization of the point. He had to play that kind of basketball to win *when his teammates were that injured.* He is clearly very capable of not playing hero ball. But when you don't have the supporting cast to make it worthwhile, you do have to if you want to win. Look at how Harden's old teammates are doing without him running the show for them"
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World‚Ñ¢, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"Statistically, Russel Westbrook is objectively better than Michael Jordan. To elaborate, this is because Bradley Beal is just Lebron James, as they have the same facillitating and rebounding and athleticism, but Beal is the more versatile scorer and defender. Its obvious 2021 season was a fluke, get a grip on reality. Wizards will sweep their way to the playoffs after warming up this year and will 4-0 sweep LeBum ""It hurt me financially"" James."
Lebron James
LeBron James
Lol as if a dude named LeBron fucking James whose been carrying your trash ass franchise isn't enough to win a playoff series.
"Ah yes the very selfless act of opening the ""Lebron James I Promise School (founded by Lebron James)"""
"It was during this 2003-2004 range that KG registered 1 of only 5 seasons ever when a player recorded the most points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks for their team. The complete list is:  * Dave Cowens, Celtics in '78 ([link](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/1978.html))  * Scottie Pippen, Bulls in '95 ([link](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHI/1995.html))  * Kevin Garnett, Timberwolves in '03 ([link](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIN/2003.html))  * LeBron James, Cavaliers in '09 ([link](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CLE/2009.html))  * Giannis Antetokounmpo, Bucks in '17 ([link](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIL/2017.html))  I'll point out that Garnett arguably had the best overall averages in these 5 categories of these 5 seasons with 23-13-6-1.4-1.6, comparing quite well to James in '09 (*28-8-7-1.7-1.1*) and Pippen in '95 (*21-8-5-2.9-1.1*). It also has to be mentioned that KG did this in the slowest era of the 3, and in by far the hardest conference."
Nah just some bum named Lebron James
"I'm sorry but the defending champs with LeBron James on their roster isn't losing to anyone in the 1st round unless LeBron is injured.   Reminds me of those post-game threads during Blazers, Rockets, Nuggets series."
"Well. LeBron did that in 2011. Kobe did in 04. Magic Johnson did, Larry Bird did. Kevin Durant has, and James Harden has. Dame has had some awful playoff performances. It happens to all superstars, even the clutch ones. Kyrie hit the greatest or second greatest NBA shot of all time while averaging 27 PPG in finals series though."
Defenders should be able to hold their ground. There space. That includes vertical space.   If I‚Äôm backpedaling and keeping pace while you drive at basket and shoulder dive into my chest knocking me to to the floor to ‚Äúcreate space‚Äù for an easy layup... that an offensive fucking foul.   All the greats find ways to find the loopholes to the rules. Kobe mastered ripping through your hands for a jumper.   Lebron does the shoulder thing. He also had a nasty and I mean NASTY forearm that‚Äôs an offensive fucking foul every time but he‚Äôs just ‚Äúmastered the paint‚Äù.   James Harden mastered the flop for a few years but created the step-step back. Every league I ever grew up playing on that‚Äôs a travel.   Equally tough defense and offense is what makes basketball great.   Jordan pushing past the Pistons wouldn‚Äôt have been nearly as great back in the 80‚Äôs/90‚Äôs because they kicked the shit out of him defensively. And he took it to them offensively. When he finally overcame it was AMAZING.
We can trade lebron james for 1 month
Quality &gt; quantity. Would you rather have 1 LeBron James or 7 Dion Waiters?
"He was. Guess people forget his lockdown defense on Lebron.  https://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/106613/iggy-makes-lebrons-shooting-iffy  Casuals on this sub are funny. Iggy also has a much better plus minus than curry too.  James shot 39.7% from the field that series. Igoudala was the main reason why.  Igoudala was great on offense too. I know casuals like to look at Curry‚Äôs offense, but maybe, just maybe the two way player guarding lebron amazingly well and scoring 16 points a game was more important to winning that series."

"Given their lead, no, they just didn't care enough to get a blocking foul at the end of the half, which would have led to two points either way. Lebron James doesn't get charging fouls and everyone knows it."
It was a travel. Lebron James is as notorious a traveler as James Harden is a cheat for hooking arms to get free throws and Russell Westbrook is at taking easy rebounds in meaningless minutes to pad triple double stats.
"Here's another:  &gt;Historically, Abdul-Jabbar has been painted as a mercurial giant ‚Äî and one who doesn‚Äôt particularly rock with the media. And even though he is now an official part of the media, the description still might hold. The reality of how reserved he once was should always be couched in the reality of who he is and what he represented: an incredibly talented black man with a Muslim name who was willing to be outspoken in a country that prefers ‚Äî better yet, demands ‚Äî that its black athletes shut up and [insert athletic action]. And Abdul-Jabbar was covered by a media that didn‚Äôt look anything like him and rarely even feigned an understanding of the roots of any animosity that might have burned inside him.  https://theundefeated.com/features/kareem-abdul-jabbar-lets-go-of-his-past-and-talks-lebron-james-eric-reid-and-his-own-legacy/  Sounds like a history of being approachable and personable. Whether you agree with him or not (I do, actually), he has generally never been one to talk with others on any term but his own. I think that's fine but it doesn't mean he'd be easy to meet."

"Yeah seriously. I know people like to preach the ""play every minute"" thing, but if you're up 14 with 4 seconds left in the half and an angry charging Lebron James is coming after you, you are getting OUT OF THE WAY"
"He signed a contract that ends when he‚Äôs 35. For most people not named LeBron James, that‚Äôs the twilight of their career. At that age, he‚Äôll most likely lose a step and either retire or accept a diminished role. He spent his prime in Portland and that‚Äôs really all they want from him. If he leaves after his prime, thats 100% fine because he‚Äôs given everything already. It‚Äôs like how MJ went to go play for the Wizards after his prime, no one criticized him because he gave everything to Chicago.   Not everyone is like KD or LeBron, obsessed over their legacy. Some players truly care about loyalty to their city and their fans."
Wouldnt be surprised if the NBA creates another award named after him in the future.. Lebron James Ironman award.
"bro Nate trained for like 3 weeks before the fight lmao you think LeBron James, who has endured a full swing my Ibaka to his face breaking his nose and still managed to finish the layup, can't take a punch from a way undersized Jake Paul?  Do you know why weight divisions exist?"
‚ÄúI Knocked Out LeBron James üò±???!!!!! (Boxing Gone Wrong) (Not Clickbait) (*NSFW*)‚Äù
"Mans beat up one out of his prime, undersized, former NBA player, and now he can take on LeBron James lmaooooooooooooo"
LeBron James and Steph Curry's gotta be on this short list too.
"Yes, but they‚Äôre usually referenced separately from the regular season ones.   Steph is already first in playoff threes made, and has a sizable lead on second place, Lebron James. Klay Thompson is a few games way from passing Ray Allen for third."
"Because he was forced to be 1st/2nd option on the that Lakers team with a bunch of extremely young players. With LeBron James keeping you as his second option. Kuzma gets less minutes then KCP, he isn't going to be the 1st or 2nd option for any team in the NBA right now. Even the Hornets, possibly the wolves but Edwards even in his raw state is a better player to invest minutes into then Kuzma."
Lebron James.
https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30895017/los-angeles-lakers-lebron-james-kyle-kuzma-warned-nba-violating-anti-flopping-rule
"Hmm Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Lebron James and Andrew Bogut.   He should've joined the warriors in 2015"
So don't listen to Lebron James outside of basketball. Got it.
"People with money and fame have power, who knew?  LeBron James revitalized an entire city's economy by just winning games in Cle. If athletes weren't paid millions of dollars and on tv everyday, and that money went to say, teachers, they would have the power and Steven Adams wouldn't be getting interviewed about his opinion on athlete worship lol"
"It‚Äôs not that we only care about Ringzzz it‚Äôs that the standard has already been set. MJ got 6 so any player that wants to be considered as good will always have the: Well your god but MJ had 6 rings( see Lebron james). That‚Äôs what created the ringz chaser mentality amongst elite players(see kd, james harden, etc). So now everybody is trying to get as many as possible, and since there are super teams, it forces even bigger super teams to be created to win.   Kind of the same in the NFL. Idk how Mahomes career will go but if he wants to be considered the goat someday, people will always tell him: Well Brady has 7(and counting)."
LeBron James
This whole pandemic was orchestrated to expose Lebron James hairloss
Monte Morris flailing his arms and calling for the ball like he‚Äôs Lebron fuckin James over here
"2/3 were losses to LeBron James, and LBJ w/ Kyrie. There's no shame in that. You were also missing Kyrie and Hayward in 2018.   Last season you could argue that they should've won. But the other 2 years? Come on"
"Part of that is because Kawhi Leonard is primarily known for his defense, LeBron James was easily positioned to be the face of the league the moment he graduated high school, Kawhi Leonard did not even become a truly great player in my opinion until the 20 15/16 season, even when he won the 2014 finals MVP that was such a team effort ass-kicking that it just felt like "" alright let's give it to the young guy"". Another reason is by this eras standards the 2019 Toronto Raptors were a historically great defensive team, and he was the best player on it so that carries over as well so reputation and perception is a huge part. And LeBron bear a lot of responsibility in that as well because there was a few years stretch after he left Miami that he wasn't exactly putting up the best efforts on defense like he had been"
"&gt;No it's more that we know our team situation better than you do...   &gt;   &gt;The trade included Smart so take him out of your listYou now have 3 players. One of which is coming back from a serious knee injury and is in wait-and-see mode.You now have 2 players.  You coulda probably gotten away with Brown &amp; Kemba for Harden considering how Harden tanked his value so hard to make it affordable. Include some filler &amp; picks and you likely get Harden and PJ Tucker, which is a veeeerrry good haul  &gt;Yeah Tatum + Harden + ? - picks (so we can't go grab a role player) = definitely a championshop contender.../s  Yes. Considering the Nets then don't get Harden and you do, you're better than Philly and just as good as Brooklyn. Harden is one of the best floor raisers of all time, up there with LeBron, Steve Nash, etc.  &gt;You mean that team that had Capella, Ariza, Tucker and Gordon all playing some of the best basketball of their careers?   &gt;   &gt;Who are Boston's depth pieces to fill out the roster?  They were all playing the best basketball of their career then, and now they're not...... I wonder why.... who is the common denominator for all their success? It couldn't have been the superstar who elevates every role player he plays with as he's been carrying rosters averaging 30 &amp; 10 for years now, could it?  &gt;Yeah... imagine... all those good defensive pieces we have...We're the 15th defense in the league right now and you want to trade 2 of our 4 plus defenders for James Harden.  Harden, Smart, Tatum, Tucker and Theiss/TT is much better than what you have right now. Hell, if you played the S&amp;T properly, you coulda had Myles Turner for fucking pennies. Didn't Turner come with McDermott and a 1st? Or something like that?  And Ainge hesitated likely because he wanted even *more* for a player who was gonna leave anyway? Hayward went to Charlotte because you guys took too long to make an easy decision that woulda elevated your team.  Imagine, I know this is absolute best case scenario but:  PG: Harden  SG: Smart  SF: Tatum  PF: Tucker  C: Turner  Top 3 team.  &gt;That's stupid. Siakam was the #2 on a championship team. Jaylen is more than qualified.You don't Billie King yourself for 2 uncompetitive seasons.  Siakam was the #3 behind Kawhi &amp; Lowry. Just because Siakam averaged a lotta points in the Finals doesn't mean he was the #2 when Lowry was the leader, playmaker, best shooter and heart/soul of that Raps team who was almost as integral as Kawhi. He was even better than Kawhi in some of those games at Oracle... Brown isn't as good as that Lowry.  Also, if KD, Klay, Iggy and Looney are healthy, Siakam is getting clamped tf up. So is Brown. That's an unfair comparison.  Now put Brown on any of the Main 3 Championship Frontrunners right now. Lakers, Clips, Nets. How is he the 2nd best player on any of those teams?"
"I‚Äôm just fucking frustrated at how completely nonsensical you are being. Bruh, if you admit that you would have lost with Chris Paul then you can‚Äôt tell me that WB was the sole reason you fucking lost. And it‚Äôs insane to me that you think 6‚Äô0 Chris Paul would play better defense on Lebron FUCKING James. And the fact that WB was paid 40 million doesn‚Äôt somehow make him MORE responsible, your FO chose to pay 40 mil to CP and then CHOSE to trade for WB because he was the only trade able player making similar money. If anything that makes the responsibility more on the FO than anything. Also calling WB‚Äôs play g-leaguer is such a gross fucking overreaction that I realize this argument is pointless because you obviously are so narrow minded as to never have a realistic viewpoint."
The Lakers **missed the playoffs** with prime LeBron James
"For sure, the Lakers made mistake after mistake and somehow got LeBron James, and even then embarrassed themselves by missing the playoffs with them.  Luckily LeBron convinced AD to come and they won a title. Without that, they‚Äôd be in a dark place right now."
"Lmao, Russ was not the reason the Rockets lost last year‚Äôs playoffs. It was the dogshit team construction that put a small ball team against Lebron James and Anthony Davis without anyone to guard them. Crazy how Rockets fans turned on him after he balled out most of the season for them. Dude had recently gotten over Covid and an injury and got rushed back during the playoffs."
Comparing LeBron James to Danny Ainge is definitely bizarre. Whatever you gotta do to justify it.
That haul paved the way for us getting LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Have them winning a title and locked with us for 3 more years at least. I'm not complaining.
"Well, lebron has stats over MJ if you want to go there.. MJ has a .32 on his 3p%, while lebron has a .34   MJ is well below average there.   Lebron James has an Efg% of .540 meanwhile Jordan has a .509   A 4% difference in efg is much bigger than ft%...   But neither of them have a good rating of 60%... so why are they both in the convo for a goat???   Defensive rating wise they are within 1 of each other (MJ 102 and lebron 103)... still not great, but definitely good... not GOAT level defense though like a Kareem who has a career 96..  Now MJ has a few more ppg than lebron, but lebron has more assists Meh its hard to say based off of stats...  MJ is the GOAT not because of stats, obviously, but because of his resume and IMPACT above all else..  It‚Äôs ‚Äòlike mike‚Äô after all... his reign as the king of basketball came at the height of the golden age of sports in general. His sticking with one franchise, his titles and his fame among other things makes him the goat"
I do it out of good fun. Of course Tatum doesn‚Äôt actually suck and this one game doesn‚Äôt mean Booker is better.   But yea there are too many people who are actually serious. Even established players still get crazy reactive hot takes after bad games. LeBron fucking James does not go down on the all time list after some regular season stinkers
"Well, Lebron James ain‚Äôt ‚Äúsome people‚Äù ya know?"
Idk u seem to think it‚Äôs completely fine to compare total stats from 27 games to 82 as if that‚Äôs a fair comparison lol.  You say Russ had no help but 16-17 Steven Adam‚Äôs scored over 200 points more than 20-21 Lebron James! He had a better scorer on his team than this years Lebron! Seems like a lot of help to me!
"Translation: ""I don't know what you think this is, but I am LeBron James."""
"What kinda logic is that lmao? They rebuilt in one year and made deep playoff runs a lot quicker than anybody anticipated. Injures and things players leaving in free agency has hurt them. The lakers were complete dog shot for 7 Years, lucked into Lebron James bc they are located in LA and win a title. You some how think Boston isn‚Äôt trying for a title lmao. Winning a title is hard in the NBA lmao."
"I mean he didn't really come that close to winning. He got a but of a media boost because he is Lebron James, but it's not like you can't say he earned that kind of respect.   Lebron is a much better player than Kyrie. He's also the best player on his team. He was playing like one of the best players in the league and he's doing it again.   I don't really understand the confusion on that."
"The only active players ahead of him on the all time assists list are CP3 (7) and LeBron James (8). Westbrook is 13 on the all time list, despite the time lost to injury."

"First part for those who can‚Äôt access it:  &gt;There was a choice to be made.  &gt;‚ÄúIt all depends what you want in this sport, to be honest,‚Äù LeBron James said. ‚Äú... Do you want to score a bunch of points but sometimes it doesn‚Äôt really matter or doesn‚Äôt make a difference in winning or losing? Or do you want to be a part of something special where you continue to get better, you continue to make an impact and you have a role on the team where you‚Äôre playing for something more than the sum of your individuality?‚Äù  &gt;Anyone who closely watched Kyle Kuzma‚Äôs career with the Lakers couldn‚Äôt be sure which direction he‚Äôd pick.  &gt;In his first two seasons with the Lakers, Kuzma scored ‚Äî a lot. He was a 17-point-per-game scorer before his 24th birthday on the Lakers ‚Äî endorsements and fame coming far before any winning.  &gt;Left with the Lakers after the team traded the rest of their future for Anthony Davis, it was time for Kuzma to decide.  &gt;He‚Äôs chosen wisely.  &gt;Armed with a new contract, an NBA championship and comfort in his role, Kuzma‚Äôs shaped his game around the stars on his team instead of trying to star alongside them. And it‚Äôs working.  &gt;In the Lakers‚Äô 115-105 win over Memphis on Friday, Kuzma scored 20 points ‚Äî but it was his 10 rebounds, including five on the offensive glass, that flashed like some of Kuzma‚Äôs game day outfits.  &gt;‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of different ways you can impact the game,‚Äù Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. ‚ÄúAs he‚Äôs grown his offensive rebounding, he‚Äôs really gotten comfortable with that aspect of his game and has given us a huge lift ‚Äî just creating a lot of extra possessions that are helping us win games. So, it‚Äôs just a testament to understand that there‚Äôs many ways you can impact the game without scoring.‚Äù  &gt;Friday was his seventh game with 10 or more rebounds this season, all of which have come since Jan. 7. Last season, his first as a player trying to find his way on a contender, Kuzma grabbed double-digit rebounds just three times in the regular season and playoffs."
It could really just come down to not having a James Harden or also someone who can slow down a Lebron. Although we have so many players who can accord 25 in a night. We had 4 players over 25 against the bucks.
"To be fair, what makes Pat's trash talk annoying is that he doesn't do shit to back it up. He ain't even the third most important player on the team. Remember Lebron's ""Not one, two three..."" comment when he joined the Heat? It was so fucking stupid, but it was Lebron James.  Pat Beverly is that guy in pickup games who scores a single basket in 1/6 attempts and trash talks while his team has the best guy of the court bodying your team."
Lebron James
"Fun fact: Lebron James participated in a fake hate crime. True story, Google it. So faking a foul is small compared to other things he has faked. Funny how the media covers when Lebron fakes a foul, but now when he fakes a hate crime. Pretty interesting, no?"
Lebron James is in the Flophouse and he is PISSED.
"Gobert fucking exists. WTH? Besides, team defenfe is how you beat LeBron and AD, and the Jazz have great team defense. I still would never bet against LeBron James in the playoffs, but to act like it's a sure Lakers win is rediculous."
"???  * Michael Jordan: 5,633 Assists - - 2,924 Turnovers (**1.93** Assists per Turnovers)  * LeBron James: 9, 560 Assists - - 4,526 Turnovers (**2.11** Assists per Turnovers)  **PLAYOFFS**  * Michael Jordan: 1,022 Assists - - 546 Turnovers (**1.87** Assists per Turnovers)  * LeBron James: 1, 871 Assists - - 950 Turnovers (**1.97** Assists per Turnovers)"

"Longtime Sixers fan here: I‚Äôd say ‚Äúok fair‚Äù. I‚Äôve long believed that the MVP award has actually been ‚ÄúMost Valuable Player who Isn‚Äôt Lebron James‚Äù.   Even when he hasn‚Äôt really been in the conversation for the last few years because he wasn‚Äôt at HIS absolute peak he objectively should have been contending. Other players have had ‚Äúnarrative years‚Äù where they win because they are doing remarkable stuff like Russ‚Äôs 2017 MVP year.   But the award isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúRemarkable Player of the Year‚Äù its Most Valuable Player. And consistently, imo, thats been Lebron, even in his ‚Äúquiet‚Äù years.   Also I‚Äôm a Sixers fan first and more casual NBA fan so feel free to disagree."
"Wade was never a superstar.  He always played with better players than him (Jermaine O'neal, Shaquille O'neal and LeBron James).  This guy is a scam and only north-americans (they are so na√Øve) fell for it."
The fact yall were a laughing stock because LEBRON JAMES was your dad is ridiculous in itself though.

"Lebron James:  ‚ÄúIf I could come back, in the NBA, I want to be Jayson Tatum.  I don‚Äôt want to get boomed on because I want to keep my knees good and all that.  I want to be that f***ing Tatum:  come out of preschool; boom people anytime I want, ultra green jersey, be so good (x4),  just go home after and work out with me this summer.‚Äù"
"LeBron James Jones duo continues, it's lit!!!"
LeBron James works one hundred and ten percent get the pistons into the playoffs in the fucking east without a doubt. Lebron could even get this year's 8-30 wolves team to the post season
"Until LeBron James IV does this averaging 62.6% from the 4 pt line, maybe"
"But if they did, LeBron James (of Trainwreck, Space Jam: A New Legacy fame) could play LeBron ."
"Yeah, LeBron James is a really smart dude and he does pay attention to this MVP talk. This is why I think he's playing back to backs now lol"
"Look, I'm as straight as a line, but LeBron James is so fucking hot üòç. His muscles are as big as a beast, his body movements are so smooth and sexy, and that face of his is j-j-just... beautiful. I mean, look at his hair, it's growing back. Not only that, but his beard is just beautiful. His face, looking so happy. His eyes, so full of life. Just hearing his voice gets me hard. I just want him to bring back that sexy headband.  And let's not forget he's a GOAT. Wanna see what I mean? Just look at him compared to MJ. He isn't a skinny, aneroxic looking dude. He's strong and big, just like a train. He can grow facial hair unlike MJ. He also helps kids and spends money on kids, unlike MJ (gambling).  I just love LeBron. I would turn gay for him in a heartbeat. He's got the money, he's got the looks, and most of all, he's got the good personality. He never got involved in scandals, and knows how to raise a proper family.  LeBron, if you're reading this you're awesome. Please talk to me. I worship you every single night. &lt;3"
LeBron James is the MVP.
LeBron James coming for that MVP.
He‚Äôs got about 80% chance at winning MVP just cause he‚Äôs Lebron James
LeBron James can't keep getting away with this.
Lou Williams - LeBron James
Lebron James or Shawn Marion?
You have no source but your ass. There is literally no one in league history with more clutch defensive stops than Lebron James. That's a fact I can prove just by discussing important defensive plays in nba history.   But you can't even name a single clutch stop Pippen or anyone else had so there is nothing for me to counter argue. I win.
"*""Another cake walk for LeBron James.... oh wait""*"
"Skip: MJ would come out of retirement, change teams to Miami, and dunk on LeBron in a #23 jersey with Jordan covering the James on the jersey. Just to assert his dominance."
\[Stephen A.\]: James Harden and Lebron James are clear MVP favorites.
It‚Äôs LeBron James. Give him a Div II squad and he‚Äôs probably still dragging them through March Madness.
"Are you a LeBron James fan by chance??? If yes , I just wanna say that he is not equal to Michael Jordan."
"Ja Morant  Kyrie Irving  LeBron James  Giannis Antetokounmpo(imo, Zion is also great)   Nikola Jokic"
"Move the goalposts? Can you read? This is what I said  &gt;Name someone with more clutch stops?  You can't.   None of those players are better all around defenders than Lebron. Some of them are better shot blockers (Wallace, Hakeem, Gobert, Russell) but they are worse perimeter defenders. Draymond at his best is as good of a help defender as Lebron at his best, but Lebron is the superior man to man defender and perimeter defender.    Lebron James has the most clutch defensive stops in league history. He is the only one of those players who can and who actually has done it all defensively. He can be the best defensive player in any game, season, series, or moment. That's one of the reasons he's the best player he can do anything."
"OP is making a specific argument that Curry's on/offs make this season historically great (even, presumably, compared to past seasons by Curry himself), based on his on/off splits. Nobody's arguing that Curry isn't an exceptional player, but the on/offs (which would already be high in any circumstances, because Curry is very good and nobody else on the Warriors is nearly as good) are being exacerbated by Kerr's rotations in a way that simply isn't true for most other stars in the NBA, particularly two of the players who Curry draws the most comparisons with (Damian Lillard and LeBron James), who have staggered minutes significantly with their team's 2nd best players over the last year and a half, depressing their on/off splits.   The fact that Kerr plays Draymond exclusively next to Curry while Stotts frequently plays CJ away from Lillard doesn't, by itself, say anything about the capabilities of Curry or Lillard themselves (and no, I'm not arguing that Lillard is better than Curry, just shooting down the idea of the on/offs being informative about that one way or the other). That's more about the specific skillsets of Draymond and CJ than anything else. If the two were traded the Blazers would run Draymond next to Lillard as much as possible and the Dubs would have CJ run their 2nd unit."
"I was thinking about it last season already, when AD was getting all the ""defensive"" votes.  But now it's becoming kinda hard to ignore, because it's impossible to dismiss it as ""not real minutes"", ""not against starters"" or whatever usual comment - this season, Lakers played way more minutes without Davis than with him. And in that time, their defense was still even more stingy than with Davis.  LeBron himself is playing fantastic. If anything about LeBron James could be ""quiet""... I'd say his defensive turnaround since joining Lakers has not been talked about that much as it's very impressive.  It's kinda hard to push it further that Lakers are mostly the league's top defense because of Davis individually. And they have a healthy lead among all teams in terms of defensive rating.  &amp;#x200B;  Does it mean he is the very best defender in the league? I'd say probably not, but being the best defender on the league's best defense, both by a healthy margin, could be something worth considering."
"Curry Lillard LeBron James KD AD  Curry and Lillard are excellent floor spacers who you can't leave open. Check the 2021 ASG; I think they'd be a better fit than Curry and Harden. LeBron will be on-ball the whole time because he makes the right decision pretty much every time on offense. If KD buys into making quick decisions and playing off-ball a la 2017 Warriors, then this team will have really good synergy. AD and Curry are scalable to any team and do not need the ball to be effective. So it's a well-balanced onslaught of jump shooting and off-ball movement, from a heliocentric, LeBron-lead offense. Can't go wrong.  I would consider adding Jokic, but I don't really want to have the ball outside of LeBron's hand all too much."
"It's not necessary to watch him. I just made a search now on what he's up to lately and had a chuckle at the quotes that lately made the headlines. It's like a villain in a cartoon, only this one doesn't have a thing for Smurfs but for LeBron James."
"Lebron has guys like Caruso, Kuzma, KCP, Dennis Schroder, Gasol, and even Matthews is decent   Green has Kelly Oubre, Andrew wiggins, Steph Curry, James Wiseman etc.   One team has much better defensive personnel than the other."
Kyrie Irving  Tracy McGrady  Vince Carter  Lebron James  Tim Duncan
LeBron James still exists I think
"&gt;Like if lebron james is your favorite player that's fine he's one of mine too, but im not gonna have a brain aneurysm if someone thinks mj is the goat lol.  Lmao this sub acting like the biggest zealots aren't the LeBron haters themselves."
"Eye test tells me Jake Layman &gt; Lebron James, how‚Äôs that for your data!"
It doesn't effect their bone development. Idc how much hormone therapy Lebron James takes he's still not a girl lmaoo
And Ricky Davis thought the Cavs were adding Lebron to give *him* help.  &gt; Davis thought the Cavaliers had drafted James to help him score the ball with more efficiency and regularity.
"I mean he‚Äôs a rookie getting LeBron James switched on him.  He‚Äôs not poor defensively because he‚Äôs lackadaisical like we can see with other players. He‚Äôs a rookie and is developing his bbiq. He‚Äôs still figuring out when to go up, and when not to, and how to defend hard without fouling."
"There's plenty of time for Jokic and Embiid. They'll get even better and it will be glorious. But first we have to celebrate poor Lebron James some more and make him feel extra special, we haven't done it enough over the last few decades."
"I don't know why, but the NBA Second Spectrum has a different defensive rating formula/ranking. Among players with 25+ mpg, this is how the ranking looks like:  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=MIN*GE*25&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Season=2020-21  1. Patty Mills 2. Mike Conley 3. LeBron James 4. Kyle Kuzma 5. Rudy Gobert"
"LeBron James has what it takes to dominate into the NBA; amazing stats in scoring, rebounding, and blocks and assists! But he believes that he is basketball and the G.O.A.T., wtf no way! His competition is nothing like that of the 50‚Äôs -90‚Äôs!! More teams with more than one all-star player on their squad and the players who are taking care of business are of a different cloth than James!! LeBron will always be known as the guy who couldn‚Äôt compare to Air Jordan and the black mamba Kobe!!!"

"In the modern era you DO need to be a genius and say exactly what you mean. Everyone holds each other to those standards now - which are obviously unattainbale. Or else people like you come online and destroy them, misinterpret their context, and refuse to see any other theoretical explanation except their own as a possibility. People have latched onto this years later and never listened to the original video. They have, instead, watched everything Kyrie has done since then and reinforced their own views.     I personally understand why Richard Jefferson, Channing Frye, Lebron fucking James, and Kyrie Irving - during their championship run / the year after - might be having a candid conversation about how the media warps the truth or ""decides"" for us.      Again, it's obvious his ""flat earth"" example was stupid and ruined his point. But how can you say an NBA basketball player can't have an opinion on journalists/media? Just because his example was bad? Just because he isn't up to your standard? Is JR Smith or Kyle Kuzma (random examples) not allowed to talk about the media either simple because they aren't college educated on the subject?      Why do we have any more reason to be here talking about it? Is it because we aren't in front of cameras and microphones? I would argue Kyrie shouldn't need to ""keep it behind closed doors"". He tried to have a philosophical conversation and it backfired; reinforcing his own world view that the media and people can't be trusted.      Our society NEEDS to have a real conversation about how social media, journalists, and news control our behaviours while making us too lazy to search topics ourselves.      Seriously, sometimes I think Journalism is the 4th branch of government; it holds that much power. Yet it has barely any regulation in fear of hurting freedom of speech.     Kyrie tried to talk about stuff like this and misspoke. But then again, I'm sure I did too. And so did you. I personally stay off twitter in fear of doing so. It doesn't suddenly mean we can't talk about it. Just that what people truly mean when we speak day-to-day isn't always 100% perfection - and the media needs to come to terms with that, critically think, ask more questions, and find out what people truly mean. Including you.     If you actually did read all of this I must say you are more friend than foe!"
"Now that all 13 are out I'll bite the bullet and rank my personal peaks based on these videos alone.  1. Lebron James, simply put that version of Lebron is quite literally unstoppable on both sides of the court.   2. Shaquille O'Neal, I would have him #1 but in terms of offensive dominance only Steph really rivals him but in other avenues.  3. David Robinson, yes really, criminally underrated stretch for him that gets overshadowed by Hakeem. In those years he was either scoring leader, blocks leader, DPOY, or all of those.  4. Steph Curry, really wanted to have him higher and don't get me wrong Steph is an underrated defensive player but the 3 ahead of him brought it both ways at a high level but Currys offense alone catapults him over a bunch of 2 way guys in this list.  5. Kevin Garnett, another one that's probably a head scratcher but hear me out. At his peak he was an MVP, first team all defense, first team all nba, and was able to drag a lifeless team to the WCF as a supposed not #1 option. We can have the debate about Duncan being better all time which is not debatable imo but I've always said I'd take peak Garnett over Peak Duncan.  6. Michael Jordan, this isn't to say Jordan isn't better than these ppl, just that the stretch Ben chose (although valid) I personally would have gone back a year on each to account for 1988 when he was DPOY, MVP, but to each their own.  7. Tim Duncan, again like Garnett you had someone who was MVP, First team all nba and defense, and was winning finals MVPs. I guess I underestimated his defensive value because I only watched him 2010 and on when (to me) it seemed like he was just a post defender.  8. Hakeem Olajuwon, really Hakeem should be higher but like Jordan, his PEAK wasn't much better than his career (which is a compliment) so he falls to the wayside.  9. Larry Bird, now this is tough because Larry was god tier on both sides of the ball but not quite dominant in the sense that ppl like Shaq or Hakeem were.   10. Kobe Bryant, this is tough again because the game was different and Kobe's game was heavily ""mid 2000s"" with tons of mid range jumpers and contested fadeways. The fact that he was first team all defense while averaging 35 a game says something though.  11. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, tremendous peak but really he was good for his entire career even until his 40s which hurts him IMO. 6 MVPs with his first being in 1971 and the last being in 1980 means his career was basically a peak, much like lebron.  12. Magic Johnson, wasn't too impressed with his video and this is me being young and not understanding his impact. Very good offensive player but very poor defensive player on anyone who was laterally quick and didn't play in the post.  13. Bill Walton, least impressive peak by far but not someone I even expected on this list. Never knew how good of a passer and shot blocker he was.  He didn't post these but here are some good honorable mentions:  - 08/09 Dwyane Wade - 17-19 James Harden - 15-17 Russell Westbrook - 90-93 Charles Barkley - 16-18 Lebron - 07-09 Lebron - 75-78 Julius Erving"

It‚Äôs one thing for Dunkey to shout out a fan for subbing but nobody expects Lebron to shout them out or chat or whatever. Literally all he‚Äôd have to do is record a few matches with Steph and Ben Simmons and he‚Äôd be making millions (more.)"
What type of word babble did you just type. Go be wrong at bball somewhere else   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2018/6/8/17441998/lebron-james-steph-curry-mismatch-2018-nba-finals
"Because he only really has too elite offensive seasons. Lebron has a bunch, MJ has a bunch, arguably Harden has bunch too. You could argue Currys one-two year peak is outstanding at no one will deny it, but if you look at stats like OBPM Steph has one season in the top 20, Jordan has 7, James has 3, Harden has 2. One good season doesn‚Äôt give you the title of best all time anything."
"Unless any of the candidates go off I can't see any of them as the surefire MVP  We had like 12 this season, the following players imo qualify or are at least honorable mentions, no order   James Harden  Kevin Durant (Nets success without him hurts his case allot more then everyone else tho)   LeBron James  Nikola Jokic  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Joel Embiid   Giannis Antete-pretend-I-spelled-it-right-kumpo  Kawhi Leonard  Chris Paul  Luka Doncic  With all due respect Gobert ain't cut it, the Jazz are a 2014 spurs clone to me, as in the whole team is good, just that Mitchell is inconsistent as fuck"
Lebron James.
Lebron guarded Rose in the 4th quarters. 'Short stretches' or not he guarded Rose for the most important minutes in the most important situations.  He guarded Parker for entire games if you need an example of Lebron guarding a little guy all game.  Yes the Lakers guards defend most other Laker guards most of the time. That doesn't mean Lebron can't.   When Draymond is at his best he will get right around screens and even block jumpshots. Just because he's not doing it all the time doesn't mean he's not capable. Same deal with James.
I mean yeah.  Gordon is just more versatile.  He‚Äôs our best defensive player even over Isaac because he can legit guard all 5 positions.  In 2019 he was statistically speaking the best defensive player on LeBron James.  He‚Äôs just good at everything but shot blocking and steal ironically.  He doesn‚Äôt foul he stays in front of his man and more importantly he isn‚Äôt athletically overwhelmed by anybody.
"They're definitely shaping up to be great. Not saying you were one of them, but every single year, people say ""this draft class is *soooo ass*"" or it's ""*so top heavy it's not even worth getting picks*"" because they just regurgitate everything they hear without looking into any prospects, and then the draft class comes up and performs amazingly and develops into great, well-rounded players. If a draft class doesn't have a Zion Williamson or Lebron James, it's a fucking bust class.   Sorry, tangential rant."
"I was curious who the 17 are:  LeBron James (LAL)  Anthony Davis (LAL)  Giannis antentekuonmpo (MIL)  Luka Doncic (DAL)  James Harden (BKN)  Steph Curry (GSW)  Paul George (LAC)  Nikola Jokic (DEN)  Damian Lillard (POR)  Kevin Durant (BKN)  Russel Westbrook (WSH)  kawhi Leonard (LAC)  DeAndre Jordan (BKN)  Marc Gasol (LAL)  Chris Paul (PHX)  Dwight Howard (PHI)  Derrick Rose (NYK)  So 3 Lakers, 3 nets, 2 clippers and a Knick."
Muggsy Bogues &gt; Lebron James
"Ofcourse: Norm Nixon, Brevin Knight, and Andre Miller are all better passers than Lebron james"
Is it time to be worried about Lebron James?
Lebron James
Insane how lebron james stays so healthy for 15+ years
"John Salley was in the Bad Boy Pistons, 72-10 Bulls, and the Shaq-Kobe Lakers.   Danny Green was on the Duncan-Spurs, Kawhi/Raptors, and Lebron-Lakers.   Few other players that also come to mind as role players consistently on great teams (Kerr, Fisher,  Harper, James Jones)."
&gt;The Kings are clearly still pondering the possibility of adding the kind of impact piece that they believe would put them in the playoff mix.  that impact pieces name? LeBron James
"I believe they are playing the best ball in the league right now and if you were to introduce the game of basketball to someone who had never seen it before giving them access only to this season to form an opinion that they would absolutely believe those 2 guys have a better argument at being called ""the best player in the league"" than LeBron James."

"I see.  Well, I think it *should be* LeBron, but given the landscape of the league with Embiid out, Golden state, Denver, Mavs, and Bucks (relatively) underachieving, I BELIEVE the media will vote for LeBron James especially now since the Lakers announced AD is out another three weeks.  I was arguing for what I think is going to happen based off what we know, not who I would vote for personally, despite the fact both answers are the same."
That‚Äôs my biggest pet peeve listening to any broadcast: ‚Äúa lesser player isn‚Äôt going to get that call cuz he is Lebron James or Giannis‚Äù well was it a foul or not?? That‚Äôs the only question that should be asked. I don‚Äôt even like hockey that much but I‚Äôve started watching it so much more because the reffing doesn‚Äôt ruin the fucking game
"True but no other team has fucking Lebron James who can just turn a switch on in his head and play out of his mind  He dragged the 2018 cavs to the finals. He's done more with worse, I wouldn't count out the Lakers tbh"
"Obviously there are famous black people supporting the effectiveness of vaccines and specifically a trust in this vaccine, but not every black person looks to the same set of leaders for their take on the issue. Some people love Lebron James more than anything, but would still be taking their medical advice from Dr. Fauci because...of course they would. Other people do not listen to the most knowledgeable sources. Some people look up to Steph Curry and Lebron and if it is okay for them to have doubts, what grounds do you have to argue with Joe So-and-so that he can't share those doubts.   It isn't about creating a false narrative to then drive an agenda. No one is telling people to listen to Kyrie instead of Obama, or vice versa. People listen to more than one source, and any prominent figure will have people forming their opinions, in part, based on what they have to say.  Racism is giving the black community a double-whammee on this issue. Because of a myriad of racist practices, black people have been very underrepresented with regard to having positions of power. There are fewer black CEOs, A-list actors, Politicians. They exist and many are just as good or better than their non-black counterparts, but there are fewer of theses people to look up to. By contrast, professional sports are disproportionately black and ,especially with regard to the NBA, the biggest stars almost all left college early to pursue the NBA. So you have a field of candidates for black people to potentially look up to that is overly saturated with people who shortchanged their education to make it to where they wanted to be. I am not faulting anyone for that decision as I would make it too if I could.   When you consider the correlation between education and the belief in the effectiveness of vaccines, it isn't weird at all to see articles on the subject. It is obviously foolish to listen to Kyrie's opinion on almost anything that is already explained by science, but it is equally foolish to ignore the fact that some people are going to take his opinion over Fauci's. It is what it is...and it is dumb."
"Lebron muhfuckin James.  I was 12 years old in 2007 when he torched my hometown pistons and I decided that I didnt want to root for Rasheed Wallace anymore lol.  Its easy to be a fan now but man 2010/2011 was rough, I stuck through it all."
"Well this is coming from a black person as well but I feel like your take on it is super optimistic and in a perfect world that should be the case...but it‚Äôs way too hopeful and I feel like you kinda miss the point in a large way which kinda makes me sad  I know here we‚Äôre talking about players specifically but this is a topic going through an entire community. Will LeBron James be fine? Of course. Hell, Ish Smith will be fine too because you‚Äôre right...they have money. Every day they see how modern medicine works and they benefit from it more than most other people and that‚Äôs fantastic   But the skepticism isn‚Äôt in the medicine. The skepticism is in the people providing it and possibly hidden agendas. The skepticism is in not trusting your own government. These players can afford to trust the government but people in poverty can‚Äôt. Wasn‚Äôt there documented studies talking about how they were running tests on black people just to see how something would develop inside humans? Basically using black people as lab mice. Makes you wonder why black people specifically?  Now of course they wouldn‚Äôt ever do that on high profile players because like you said, they have millions, but at the same time we still got dudes calling players the n word at games, we had the cop slam a player, a cop try to slam Masai Ujiri and all this other stuff. For some groups your money don‚Äôt mean shit to them  *Then* we look look at even the riots. This didn‚Äôt involve players at all but we had mostly white trump supporters storm the capitol where it seemed like the president gave the okay but when black people were rioting and protesting they got different energy and the catalyst for those two incidences were so far from each other on a scale that it‚Äôs embarrassing  So I‚Äôm bringing all this up because all of this **history** is why black people are skeptical. There hasn‚Äôt been enough history to show that you can truly escape this. What happens these days is how people treat you really depends on where the switch was set to and the sad thing is nobody ever knows where that switch is  So if we had a little thought experiment let‚Äôs do it like so: if Lebron James got this new vaccine and was part of a large group of other black men who died from it...what would you say?  Would you be shocked because all the people died or would you be shocked because it seems like another thing happening to only one group of people?   Now compare that to if Tom Hanks died in a similar group. Nobody would ever think anyone was targeted in that group  The goal in all of this is to live in a world where both of those scenarios have the same reaction without anyone using history to point to foul play but I promise you right now that couldn‚Äôt happen. Even if LBJ was in a group of predominantly white people. People will still feel like something was off   So really I feel like the point of all this is to say that I just can‚Äôt agree with you at all and it‚Äôs painful seeing people just side with you like ‚Äúof course players should be ok with it. They‚Äôre rich!‚Äù As a black dude that shouldn‚Äôt be what you fight for. That‚Äôs not how you should earn your equality because if today all you need is money then who knows what you need tomorrow. And because of *that*...that‚Äôs why players have the right to be skeptical imo"

His dunks are too good and he's an elite put-back player. Just nice guy to have on the team.   I made sure to have a playmaker, a shooter, and an elite defender at each position so that the team can essentially play any playstyle and succeed. Can use dominant post-man, traditional ball movement, heliocentric offensive-creator etc. Could even go with a twin towers lineup by sliding AD to the 4."
Lebron James
1. LeBron James
I honestly think Zion has had a more successful career than Lebron James.
"Did you see kyrie against the bucks in 2019? Or that just didn‚Äôt happen ?  Chris Paul got fucking injured after we went up 3-2, Wby are you intentionally leaving things out to prop up your stupid argument? Harden went against 4 allstars with 1 and still put up 32/6/6/4 and was fouled on half his threes in game 7, and we only lost by 9. The same team that 4-1d kyrie while he had lebron fucking James on his team lol. Hardens next best teammate was eric gordon  &gt; kyrie has never had the opportunity harden has had to have a team constructed around him  Yeah, because he‚Äôs not that good. Like there‚Äôs no way you are this sense.  Kyrie is a champion because he played with lebron. That does not make him better then harden in the slightest, harden would have beat the tougher warriors team had his teammate been healthy.  Kyrie isn‚Äôt a superstar, and has never been considered for MVP. You‚Äôre talking out of your ass"
"Lebron James... ya, I know its low hanging fruit"
"Luka is an entire offense by himself. Only other guys you can say that for are lebron James, jokic, and curry. Luka can get it from anywhere on the court by himself and is multiple tiers ahead in playmaking.   Neither are very good defenders and Zion definitely has more potential there, but Luka is better there for now.   Both have top 20 ever level talent tho. Can‚Äôt really go wrong."
"Volume &gt;&gt; Efficiency when it comes to ROY. Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Wiggins, MCW all won ROY with below average efficiency. Edwards is improving and at his pace, yeah he will still win ROTY based off of how the award is historically."
"uh, there is a team with lebron james and anthony davis on it"
I love Jokic but that's just disrespectful to Giannis. He is better both in defence and in offence.  He scores more points and creates more points.  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/1/24/21079412/points-creation-giannis-antetokounmpo-luka-doncic-lebron-james

"Bro we don‚Äôt need to come back in 5 years. Tatum has already passed the ‚ÄòFlAsHEs‚Äô stage and is a legitimate star in the league. I can‚Äôt stand the guy or the Celtics but he‚Äôs a 2x all star and has been to the ECF twice. One time in which he took LeBron James to 7 games.   Lamelo has done nothing of the sort, sure he has cool highlights and had an outstanding rookie season, but he‚Äôs not even close to Tatum.   Tatum is looking like a future MVP caliber player. Lamelo is not."
"&gt;done so kneecapped the Pelican's leverage but they still got an amazing package for him so it gets overlooked  They got the best return ever for renting out one player for one season.  Definitely in basketball history, and maybe in all of sport.  So yeah, I'd say their leverage was intact.  Davis also had an ever-changing list of preferred destinations, so it's not quite correct to say he was set on the Lakers.  You also had Davis' agent making it crystal clear to anyone who would listen that trading for Davis was a 1-year rental, and no more.     &gt;Rich Paul, Davis's agent, [told](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/rich-paul-klutch-sports-group-lakers-pelicans-lebron-james-anthony-davis)*Sports Illustrated*'s S.L. Price that regardless of where Davis plays next season, the six-time All-Star will test the free-agency market next summer.   &gt;   &gt;‚ÄúWhere he‚Äôs going to land? I have no idea,‚Äù Paul told SI. ‚ÄúAnd it don‚Äôt matter. We‚Äôre going into free agency. Why does it matter to me where he goes? Earth: We‚Äôre going into free agency. He has a year, he has to play.

"Lebron James was the best player in the league in 2011, but he was not more valuable to the Heat (a team with 2 all stars already) than D Rose was to the Bulls"
"These are the guys I consider to be the elite elite defenders in the league. Could be missing a couple:  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Draymond Green 4. Anthony Davis 5. Giannis Antetokounmpo 6. Bam Adebayo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Jrue Holiday 9. Marcus Smart 10. Jimmy Butler 11. Lebron James 12. Mikal Bridges 13. Joel Embiid 14. Robert Covington 15. DeJounte Murray 16. OG Anunoby 17. Myles Turner  I think Marcus Smart has been tangibly worse this season and couple of those next 5 guys have been little better, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt."
"&gt;AD had several playoff runs before getting traded to LA.  No, he did not.  The Pelicans made the playoffs twice in Davis' seven seasons there -- as #6 and #8 seeds.  They won 5 games total, and never had ""several runs"".  &gt;Why even mention Butler? He was clearly set on Miami and reports said that he didn't want to play with Lebron.    [Reports before Butler signed](https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/2019/05/27/jimmy-butler-would-reportedly-like-playing-with-lebron-james/) in Miami were that the Lakers were at least high on his list.  [Others said Butler has always wanted to be a Laker.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2843129-lakers-rumors-free-agent-target-jimmy-butler-has-always-wanted-to-play-for-la)  Some [said he would definitely sign in Los Angeles, if offered.](https://twitter.com/ArashMarkazi/status/1131719730845237248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1131719730845237248&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Flebronwire.usatoday.com%2F2019%2F05%2F27%2Fjimmy-butler-would-reportedly-like-playing-with-lebron-james%2F)  After going to Miami, Butler has denied considering Los Angeles... but Butler says all manner of things that are not true.  &gt; The lakers missed out on countless superstar free agents and you're focusing on Butler?   Because they could've had him for peanuts compared to the cost to rent Davis.  He's not the only player they could've gotten, just one of many.  &gt; A rental implies that AD's tenure with LA would be temporary.   Which it precisely was.  Davis was an unrestricted free agent in December 2020.  Do you understand what those words mean?  He was not under contract to play for the Lakers, and only did so in 2021 because they recruited and signed him.  Exactly as they would've had to do, and could've done, had they never traded for him.  &gt; AD signed a long term deal and stayed.   As an unrestricted free agent, who could've gone anywhere -- and if he had, would've destroyed the Lakers chances for most of this decade.  Even with him signing a new contract -- and chronically injured -- their chances are not very good.  All of that is exactly because they massively overpaid to rent him for one season, when they did not need to."
LeBron James. He was leading the #1 defense. He's definitely top 5.
"Where do the following players fit on your top 50 list then:   Dennis Rodman, Carmelo Anthony, James Worthy, Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Vince Carter, Tony Parker, Dikembe Mutombo  The list goes on. I think Pierce not making a first team All-NBA is more of a product of him playing in the same era as other all-time greats such as KG, Tim Duncan, Dirk, Lebron, etc. than anything else."
"&gt;Yes, they win with superstars like Magic, Kareem, Kobe, Shaq, Lebron AD etc. It hasn't happened with prospects lol.  They had James.  One superstar and an All-star has been enough in the past.  They also could've obtained Butler for vastly less than they spent to rent Davis.  That said, calling Davis a ""superstar"" is a bit over-the-top, since he could not reliably make the playoffs before that trade.  &gt;It's a pointless hypothetical situation. And stop using the word ""rent"" for AD. He already re-signed. It doesn't support your argument.  That's no more hypothetical than you claiming that the Lakers would not be champions without that trade, first of all.    Second, they precisely did rent Davis for one season.  He was UFA in December 2020, and could've signed with anyone -- including the Lakers.  &gt;AD has missed several weeks and the Lakers are still in the playoff picture. They're fine.  You don't burn a decade of assets to make the play-ins with LeBron James.  The Lakers would precisely be better off right now if they still had Ingram, Ball, Hart, Hunter, and Wagner.  Had they not thrown them away on that Davis rental, they also had available assets to improve further -- while their big UFA signing remains on the shelf with Achilles tendonosis."
"Kawhi Leonard, Scottie Pippen, Lebron James, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan all did to name a few"
"Bud, you guys would have fucked up luka.  Face it, you guys have been a shit organization post-Adelman and not even drafting prime Lebron is going to change that.    This isn't about the kings, it's about shitty front offices.    Lebron left Cleveland because it was a shit front office. AI only went to one finals in philly when Larry Brown got him some decent help in Dikembe and virtually nothing else.  AD couldn't get shit done in New Orleans.  Garnet, Jimmy Butler, KAT, same in Minnesota.  Booker was empty stats in phx until they got James Jones.  Lavine was being wasted in Chicago under Boylen, and they had their own high profile big in wendell carter jr. whose growth seems to have been badly stunted.  Beal, wasted in washington, point is the nba is full of good players that aren't doing shit because the organization around them sucks.  The Kings are exactly such an organization.  There is zero reason for me to believe you guys wouldn't have fucked up Luka, but go on believing he would have fixed everything."
"I mean I still got to go with what was put out in front of me, and with LeBron James being extremely passive in those fourth quarters and looking like he forgot how to play basketball Dwyane Wade being the best player still got the series to six games, probably would have pushed it to seven had momentum not swan in Dallas is favored in game 6 after that little scuffle and even though Wade was not great in game 6 there's nothing LeBron could have done in the hypothetical game 7 to get Finals MVP"
"&gt; Similar stat lines = similar players  Lol yes you idiot that's how it works. Luka being a scorer and facilitator with rebounding instincts gets him Lebron comparisons.   &gt;Someone tell that to Tyreek Evans and LeBron James. They both put up 20/5/5 as rookies  If Lebron never got any better, you'd be 100% right. Did he ever get any better? I'm asking for real, I never watch games so I don't know.  Douche."
Similar stat lines = similar players? This is the dumbest thing i‚Äôve heard all day. Someone tell that to Tyreek Evans and LeBron James. They both put up 20/5/5 as rookies  you literally do not watch basketball.
"...idk, if you ask my mom if she knows Jordan Clarkson, she wouldn't have any idea, but if I ask her if she knows Kevin Durant or Lebron James or Steph Curry, she knows for sure."
"Man, people who dont watch the Timberwolves play at all and still bother to say these takes is ridiculous. Ant has a massive role which is carrying the offense, he has to take way more shots than the rest of the team due to them simply not being very good enough to score.  Its easy to be Haliburton and be the 3rd or 4th guy and you can average 10pts some dimes and that's it. Some of the most elite scorers in the NBA have been inefficient rookies and some even won ROY. Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, ect."
"There would definitely be guys scared of playing LeBron, Harden, KD because of how hard they can embarrass them. There aren't many enforcers anymore for players to fear physically though. Probably just James Johnson but it's not like he's ever actually socked anyone"
"Probably because we‚Äôre actually decent this year and have won some games against good teams. Also correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but I‚Äôm pretty sure the last 4 or 5 games we lost were all within 2-5 points at the end. So it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre getting blown out even by great teams like Brooklyn and philly who we‚Äôve played a lot recently. So not overrated I don‚Äôt think, plus most of this shit doesn‚Äôt matter because we all know who‚Äôs gonna be in the finals this year so unless you have Lebron James or Kevin Durant on your team your chances are looking slim"
"Coming off the bench: LeBron James, Steph Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kevin Durant, and Hames Harden."
"As a high profile celebrity, that‚Äôs not what you should do.  Have we seen lebron James live streaming being drunk with strippers?  No.  Paul pierce simply fucked up and it costed him his job."
Not everyone is LeBron James. I repeat not everyone is LeBron James.
Shoutout to everyone's favorite MLB LeBron James with his open court tackle on Curry
The Cavs before he traded away like half the team. There‚Äôs plenty of examples when a Lebron James led team sucked. Let‚Äôs no cap
"For all-defense (1st or 2nd team), restricting it to just forwards, there's Giannis, Mikal Bridges, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Paul George (sometimes), Ben Simmons (sometimes), and this season, LeBron James.  I'd throw Pascal Siakam in there too, but I'm a homer, and our defense this year isn't really good enough to justify it."

Nice to see Lebron James' mentor
LeBron and James Jones
‚ÄúThe best ability is availability‚Äù  So you agree that Cory Joseph is one of the greatest players of this generation?  And that Dwight Howard has had a better season than Lebron James?
Yeah it looks awful. The story makes no sense. Like why would you want to challenge LeBron James to a basketball game in the first place?
"RJ &amp; Channing Frye trolled Lebron so hard during an interview James legit cursed them both out, LOL"
"People add context by saying the teams they beat weren't world beaters, meanwhile Orlando beats the Clippers, Memphis beats the Sixers, and Chicago beats the Nets (with Kyrie).  My point is that just because a team isn't +.500 doesn't mean it's an automatic win, or an automatic high stat game. Memphis is 7th in the league in defensive rating and the Jazz played them 3 times.  People always find a reason to take away from what the Jazz organization and Jazz players do. But when LeBron James puts up stats on the rest of the league he's MVP."
"Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma, Steven Adams"
"I think the casual take would be thinking Guard defense is just as valuable as offense. The James Hardens the world get paid and built around not the Tony Allen‚Äôs. There‚Äôs a certain level of offense that‚Äôs more valuable than 2-way dominance. Steph Curry is the most efficient volume scorer to ever exist and warps defenses as much as anybody. That‚Äôs more valuable than what 2-way demons like Paul George have to offer. You‚Äôre never going to take Giannis over let‚Äôs say 2nd-stint Cleveland Lebron, MVP Steph, OKC KD. Also calling Steph Curry only a top 30 player ever is just straight up disrespectful and clear hating idek why I responded to u."
"The one thing I remember about when Heat and Mavs played in the finals was when they let JJ Berea guard James or another smaller player and just mug the shit out of him. I don‚Äôt remember specially but there was a few offensive fouls on larger Heat players for bodying the smaller players, no different than if they were playing someone larger. I know LeBron more or less folded in that series, but the way they reffed that series has always stuck with me."
yeah it's obviously a big difference.. one of the biggest of all-time? no lol. an all-star to an mvp caliber player isnt one of the biggest differences of all-time. plenty of players go from   just this season harden went from playing with david nwaba/pj tucker at forward to kevin durant. that's a way bigger difference.  or anthony davis going from playing with elfrid payton as a primary playmaker to lebron james  or lebron going from anthony parker at sg to prime dwade.  and im probably missing a bunch of bigger ones. vucevic to jokic isnt on the same tier lol
I hope this is considered for MVP. I can't think of any other player that comes close to him now that Lebron James is out. If Harden gets it I swear to god...
"&gt;Keep telling yourself that man, go to the lakers sub and not one would rally by your side.   Argument by authority is meaningless, especially when the alleged authority is r/lakers.  &gt;AD and lebron won us a ring and thats all that matters.  That is precisely not all the matters, and this is childishly naive, and borderline stupid.  It is possible to win a ring while losing a trade, and not only has it been done, the Lakers have done it on at least one occasion previously.  You'll be hard-pressed to find even one person on r/lakers who can name that trade, however, unless they search my comment history.  &gt;He was the main recruiter for AD. Dont trade for him? Alryt you are pissing off literally one of best chance we have of even getting a ring.  James was also simultaneously recruiting Jimmy Butler -- who would have been available without that staggering overpayment and whose acquisition still results in a Championship -- and others. That's a serious problem for your alleged logic.  &gt;I'm sure ingram lonzo hart and a pissed off lebron would get us a ring over the clippers and the current nets  And a Davis with a chronic leg injury -- on top of his lengthy list of other injuries -- will?  That same Davis who signed as a free agent in December, which means they gave away all those players and picks to rent him for one season?  Why did the Lakers pay far more to rent Davis for 1 season than Brooklyn did for two seasons of Harden?  Is Davis three times the player Harden is?"
"Cp3, playoffs. Lebron James, playoffs. There is your out."
I just checked with LeBron James Jr and he said yes.
"&gt;Efg% measures efficiency as a scorer not as a shooter.  There is no difference.  You literally cannot score without shooting.  &gt;It‚Äôs also easier to shoot when you‚Äôre much more selective with shot selection.  Not really.  For exactly the same reason that coaches rarely call plays for cold players fresh off the bench, and for the same reason that players warm up before games.  Shooting more is at least as easy.  &gt;Ft% is the best measure of actual shooting as there isn‚Äôt much context that can affect it.  So LeBron James is a bad shooter?  There are many players who can shoot free-throws and not shoot from the field, and vice versa.  &gt;Lonzo is an upgrade but not a huge one, his playmaking is less valuable playing with bron.  I didn't say he was a huge upgrade, first off, but he is a huge upgrade over a couple of guys on that list.  And Davis is not a huge upgrade over Ingram offensively, either.  &gt;You‚Äôre overvaluing how good Anderson, Evans and Gordon were. They‚Äôre all arguably net negative players in NO.  In 2016, they were all positive, while Davis was negative.  This varied year-to-year, but regardless, they were all good enough to be 3-5 guys on a playoff team, with an alleged superstar.  &gt;ADs defense is crucial for la   Against whom?  Even against Denver, the Lakers used Howard and McGee extensively on Jokic, and no one else they played had a threatening center or forward.  And they would not have played Adebayo without Butler.  &gt;and negates any offensive advantage those 3 have(which they don‚Äôt)  Yes, they do, as previously explained -- especially with Butler in the lineup, meaning you are sliding everyone else down a notch.  &gt;No you just don‚Äôt get sign and trades, butler was a free agent.   I fully understand sign-and-trades.  If Butler has a list of destinations, Philadelphia will pick the best offer.  It's moot anyway, since there's no possibility Butler turns down a chance to win with James.  &gt;If butler really wanted to go the lakers they could‚Äôve signed him with their 3rd max slot which they were holding for kawhi anyway a point you completely gloss over this argument and another benefit of the ad trade, they could trade for ad and have a 3rd max slot.  Leonard officially signed with the Clippers 3 days after the Butler and Davis trades, but the decision leaked earlier.  There's no reason Philadelphia had to make that move on that day, and would not have.  How is keeping a spot open for a player who never signed, a benefit?  It's not.  And they only had that space because they gutted their roster in the Davis trade, so you are talking utter nonsense.  &gt;You act like it‚Äôs a given the lakers get him and that couldn‚Äôt be less true.  There's literally no reason [they would not have](https://twitter.com/ArashMarkazi/status/1131719730845237248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1131719730845237248&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Flebronwire.usatoday.com%2F2019%2F05%2F27%2Fjimmy-butler-would-reportedly-like-playing-with-lebron-james%2F).  &gt;So you can trade for other guys, that likely leads to a worse result as you trade a lot  Davis was the most expensive single season rental in basketball history, and maybe in all of sport.  &gt;holiday didn‚Äôt fetch any young players but he did get 3 picks and 2 swaps literally a decade of assets like kd.  2 older players, 2 picks ( not three ), and 2 swaps is not a decade.  The Lakers surrendered 7 players, 3 picks, and a swap for one season of Davis."
"Lebron James sent a letter to the NBA during the WCF complaining that he wasn‚Äôt getting enough fouls, but you‚Äôre right, when Big Honey complains about getting violated for the 15th time and not getting a call he‚Äôs going to far"
Is steph going to get the same hate players who put pup stats on loosing teams get lol? Trae was clowned for putting up similar stats on a trash team. Same for guys like booker and  Kat   But really the only two guys I‚Äôve seen consistently take trash teams to the playoffs are James Harden and Lebron James
"From last season:   https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/1/24/21080019/lebron-james-los-angeles-lakers-free-throws#:~:text=LeBron%20is%20actually%20averaging%20more,tallying%2013.8%20drives%20per%20game.  &gt; It‚Äôs strange. LeBron is actually averaging more drives this season than he has since tracking data became publicly available seven years ago. Right now he‚Äôs tallying 13.8 drives per game. In reverse chronological order starting with the 2018-19 season, his drives have been 12.4, 11.7, 11.3, 11.1, 13.2, and 9.4, which occurred in his last year with the Miami Heat."
Want to see Steph play with Lebron? You just saw Steph with a 40 inch vert play with Lebron James Johnson
"Honestly it's necessary. People still have it in their minds that Trae Young is a superstar. Remember when people thought that Lou Williams was better than LeBron James? Oh sorry, that was Trae and Luka."
"&gt; had to play with ‚Äúlesser‚Äù players in 2018   That's one way to describe a team whose 3rd-best player was 31 year-old George Hill.  You should review that Cavs' roster.  Taking that team to the Finals was utterly ridiculous.  &gt;lebron + lakers young core didn‚Äôt even make playoffs the next year  While missing how many games due to injury?  James 27, Ingram 30, Ball 37, Kuzma 12, Hart 15, Rondo 36.  &gt; probably wouldn‚Äôt have come higher than third or fourth seed last season   How many times has James been healthy, and finished below third with an All-star teammate?  Never mind with the deepest team in the league, which the Lakers would've been."
"&gt;beating a stacked team USA with Tim Duncan, Allen Iverson, Amare Stoudemaire, Shawn Marion, Stephon Marbury, Dwayne Wade, Lebron James, Carmelo Anthony, Carlos Boozer, and Lamar Odom   Just for the record, Puerto Rico also beat down that team -- which was the worst Team USA in the professional era by a vast margin -- by 19 points.  Puerto Rico isn't even a country!  That PR team was Carlos Arroyo and a dozen guys who, but for their height, would not have looked out of place on your local playground court.  Spain was the only even half-decent team that couldn't beat that American squad.  Duncan's ""stacked"" Team USA was the biggest embarrassment in the country's basketball history."
"Avoiding using Anthony Edwards, who is too young to see what's going on, here is where I'd rank the ones in the post-Jordan era. He's definitely above average.   1. Lebron James 2. Dwight Howard 3. Anthony Davis 4. Zion Williamson 5. Kyrie Irving 6. Derrick Rose 7. Blake Griffin 8. Ben Simmons 9. John Wall 10. Karl-Anthony Towns 11. Deandre Ayton 12. Yao Ming 13. Elton Brand 14. Andrew Bogut 15. Kenyon Martin 16. Greg Oden 17. Kwame Brown 18. Andrew Wiggins 19. Andrea Bargnani 20. Michael Olowakandi 21. Markelle Fultz 22. Anthony Bennett  Only one I feel bad about is Greg Oden. He was a bad pick beause his one leg was longer than the other, so he never got to see his prime, but his talent was there to be one of the best ones had been built for pro play.   Derrick Rose could go lower if you're judging solely on full career (and Zion probably doesn't belong as high), but we saw what he was at his peak, and it was an MVP, so that's why he's rated above a guy like Blake Griffin that had better longevity.   The Towns-Elton Brand grouping could also be shuffled up based on personal preference. Those guys are close, and I honestly feel Ayton probably ends up the best of the bunch."
Yes you‚Äôre changing the goal post. I said that most players averaging 35 mpg this year were all stars this year or the year before. I thought using a 2 year sample size would be better than using one year where the season has been pretty whacky.   Holy fucking shit why don‚Äôt you just answer the question. Who were LeBron‚Äôs 2 beat teammates in those respective years you mentioned?   But to answer your question LeBron has been averaging better overall numbers now than he was in his first stint with Cleveland. His percentages are all up along with his assist and rebounds. I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre comparing him now to his first Cavs stint when it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs the better player now. Even the box score support it.   You said Kobe would average worse stats and you haven‚Äôt giving a clear cut answer except for he would average less minutes. I disproved that by showing you he averaged his career numbers when he was already old and he was playing less than 35 mpg that season.   I‚Äôve been saying his prime this whole time. You‚Äôve been saying his prime this whole time. We never talked about his peak offensive season. See how you don‚Äôt even know what you‚Äôre taking about?   Did I not tell you per 100 stats are not meant to be used as the sole dictator in a discussion? It‚Äôs a damn mathematical equation used to try to balance out the numbers for every generation. But guess what? No one fucking averages per 100 numbers in a season for a reason. You really think if you give someone 100 possessions every game they would average those numbers for a season? Get the fuck out of here.   Less minutes does not equal less touches. Holy shit you‚Äôre dense.   James harden in his peak offensive season was averaging 24 shots a game and 11 FTA a game. That‚Äôs almost 30 shots a game if you count the shots he needed to take to get those free throws. He did that in 36.8 mpg. Kobe on the other hand 27.2 shots and and 6.5 3‚Äôs a game along with 13.2 3‚Äôs a game along with song with 10.2 FTA. That‚Äôs about 32 shots a game. You really think Kobe wouldn‚Äôt be shooting more 3‚Äôs in this era? Kobe would constantly take 3‚Äôs with his toe on or foot past the line because the 3 wasn‚Äôt as important when he played.   You‚Äôre crazy if you think Kobe would play exactly the same in this era where he would have the offensive freedom to do whatever he wanted.
Lebron James will be on a 10 day contract in 4 years time. Change my mind
"Nah, he has literally zero case. None. Not a single good argument can be made in favour of that position. Michael Jordan's existence alone makes that position totally absurd. LeBron James is also indisputably greater."
I really don't think that matters to LeBron James and Anthony Davis lmao
"""U bum @StephCurry30.."" - LeBron James on Twitter. Never forget."
"Damn the disrespect to James Harden and Steph Curry, they ain't Lebron or MJ, but they belong in the same class as everyone else"

Turns out LeBron James is an important player for the Lakers
I have been banned from this sub for calling Lebron James a psychopath my dude
"He should not be on the basketball floor if Jokic is also on the floor. Doesn‚Äôt matter what way he was utilized, he should‚Äôve never saw the floor with Jokic. He might this year cus of the personnel on the Lakers but it you need LeBron James and Anthony Davis on the floor with you to finally make you playable in the playoffs then it isn‚Äôt that great of an accomplishment lol."
"He‚Äôs an all-star. Not a superstar. What sure what you‚Äôre expecting.  He obviously isn‚Äôt LeBron James, but I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs a certified all-star. Been consistently proving it at Orlando."
"He‚Äôs an all-star. Not a superstar. What sure what you‚Äôre expecting.  He obviously isn‚Äôt LeBron James, but I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs a certified all-star. Being consistently proving it at Orlando."
"&gt;Giannis can‚Äôt shoot   He's shooting better from three than Davis this season.  &gt;and he put up those numbers as the 1st option and AD did it as the 2nd.  And which do you suppose is harder, being the first option or being the second behind LeBron James -- who led the league in assists?  Davis took 0.8 fewer shots per game than Antetokounmpo in the playoffs last year.  &gt;AD would‚Äôve made the playoffs all those years too if he was in the East.   ""Woulda coulda shoulda"" doesn't cut it for $50M.  And that claim is doubtful anyway, some of Davis' Pelicans teams were bad.  &gt; AD is built for post season success   Yet he had none without James.  &gt;Giannis is the better floor raiser no doubt but AD is clearly the better ceiling raiser   Nonsense terms.  Antetokounmpo is the superior player, and still two years younger.  As I said previously, if you think the Lakers win last year without James, or that Milwaukee doesn't win with him, you are delusional.   The only thing Davis has done better in his career to date is get traded to the Lakers."
"Clutch time is the most important time when players show their pace control.   &gt;	There‚Äôs no slant that a 3rd year or 4th year player isn‚Äôt at the peak of the league. Being said you‚Äôre below Lebron James tier isn‚Äôt a insult. He‚Äôs young and he‚Äôs still developing, no doubt about it he can reach there.   &gt;	But anyone who‚Äôs watched the games knows that he has some poor decision making, THAT HE HIMSELF said he needs to improve.   &gt;	But oh well, anything said against Doncic is just hate."
"I like how the Mavs fan agrees he‚Äôs not on that level yet, but everyone else is calling me a hater.   There‚Äôs no slant that a 3rd year or 4th year player isn‚Äôt at the peak of the league. Being said you‚Äôre below Lebron James tier isn‚Äôt a insult. He‚Äôs young and he‚Äôs still developing, no doubt about it he can reach there.   But anyone who‚Äôs watched the games knows that he has some poor decision making, THAT HE HIMSELF said he needs to improve.   But oh well, anything said against Doncic is just hate."
"&gt;Name one player who can do everything AD does.  Antetokounmpo.    &gt;And he‚Äôs a post season performer so he‚Äôs not gonna win a regular season award.    Without James, Davis managed to play just 13 playoff games, and lost 8.  For $50M, you need make the playoffs regularly, and beat more than one team.  &gt;There‚Äôs a reason Giannis gets shut down in the playoffs and AD doesn‚Äôt   In last year's playoffs, one of them averaged 27.7 / 9.7 / 3.5 on 60.3% effective shooting, and the other averaged 26.7 / 13.8 / 5.7 on 59.9% effective.  One had LeBron James on his team, too.  If you think the Lakers win last year without James, or that Milwaukee doesn't win with him, you are delusional."
Counterpoint: LeBron James
Not necessarily. I would argue Magic Johnson and James Worthy are a tougher opponent than Dirk and Jason Kidd (And that Lebron had the better team)
"2017 NBA Finals Game 3  LeBron James played 46 minutes, was +7, the Cavs lost by 5. Anytime people say Durant outplayed him I foam at the mouth in anger.  &amp;#x200B;  [https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400954512](https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400954512)"
Lol what? Do you think every player is lebron James? He is definitely gonna start regressing before he‚Äôs 34
Im fine with him asking out tbh. Its lakers fans acting like they are entitled to every great player ever. Fucking drives me up the wall with how pretentious their entire fan base is. esp when its validated as players refuse to be traded anywhere else and lebron james casually just walks on.
SUPERHUMAN TOILET PLUNGER RECOVERY BY LEBRON JAMES.
 ‚Ä¢[LeBron James] Woke up out of my sleep to use the restroom and thought to myself.... MAN I WANNA ~~HOOP~~ **POOP**! MISS IT SO MUCH! ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Ok anyways back to sleep I go #BasketballJones  I seriously read this at first. Then i saw your comment here about dunking it into the toilet and i honestly didn't thought anything was wrong until nobody talked about it
LEBRON JAMES WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE
"&gt;  He's statistically a perfectly average rim protector. Nothing more.  He's not being asked to be.  That's what Anthony Davis is for.  Drummond is a wide body who will clog up the key and take the physical beating that Anthony Davis is desperately trying to avoid at center.  &gt;  He's also statistically an overrated rebounder. He grabs a lot but his teams don't rebound better with him on the court. Meaning he's mostly just gobbling up rebounds that teammates could have gotten anyway, and rebounding his own misses on offense.  While what you're saying is partially true here, it lacks context.  Drummond is an all time rebounder, and you really, really need to be pushing a slant otherwise.  Here's the context it's missing:  bench squads miss more shots.  There are more rebounds per 100 possessions to be had when bench squads are in.  So when Drummond goes out, Detroit's bench (which has actually had pretty solid rebounders over the years, if not really solid all around players) does a pretty decent job getting a similar number of rebounds per 100, but they actually don't rebound a better percentage.  &gt;  He's not useful catching lobs, he's statistically one of the worst finishers at the rim among centers.  These are two entirely different skill sets.  If you think LeBron James isn't going to have a laughably easy time throwing lobs to Drummond, you haven't watched either of them.  He's made some pretty mediocre centers into lob threats over the years, and while Drummond is poorly adapted to the modern NBA as a star, he's actually pretty well suited as a role player.  &gt;  He's useful enough setting screens, but that doesn't provide nearly enough value to offset what he costs your spacing and defense.  Oh he's definitely a net negative in terms of spacing.  But you have a stretch 4 who can offset some of this, and it's not like Dwight Howard or Javale McGee were providing any spacing in a similar role.  They both played excellent in their role for the Lakers, why not Drummond?  &gt;  The only aspect of Drummond's game that's actually valuable is his passing, both outlets in transition and post-passing.  Eh, he's a decent passer for a big and I've defended this before, but I'd just as soon have the ball in someone else's hands as much as possible in the starting lineup, and in Kuzma/Gasol's hands off the bench.  This is of course assuming they don't have Marc Gasol in the light minutes starting role with Drummond doing the Dwight thing of coming off the bench but playing heavy minutes (matchup dependent of course).  &gt;  Giving him post touches doesn't mean making him iso for a bucket. It means getting him the ball there and letting him make decisions.  If you're talking about high post, there is no coach in the NBA that would rather have Drummond get the ball in the high post that Gasol.  If you're talking about the low post, his decision making is problematic.  He does not have a polished post game or good foot work and is not very efficient this way.  He is at his best offensively when he's catching lobs after setting a screen, and when he's getting offensive rebounds for put backs.  You give him the ball in the low post, he's not so much making a decision, unless he makes a huge change from the last few years, he's just going to dive bomb the basket.  He passes pretty well out of the high post, not the low post, and for the high post quarterbacking they simply have a better option.  If he wants to be a net positive for the Lakers, his job is what Dwight's was.  Hustle, set screens, catch lobs, fight for boards.  He's not the defender that Dwight is, even at this age, but he is a better rebounder capable of playing more minutes at this point."
"There's this guy called LeBron James who's OK at the 4.  But even those lineups didn't look better than AD-at-the-5 lineups last year, except against very small lineups."
"The game they were preparing for: https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202103200LAL.html  Summary: March 20, 2021. Hawks win at Lakers, 99 to 94. Lakers star LeBron James left the game in the 2nd quarter after a leg injury. He has not played in a game since :("
Reminds me of method actor lebron james who decided to play 18 seasons in the nba to prepare for his role in space jam 2
"they could have, but also a chance to sign LeBron James and Anthony Davis... you don't turn that down. and a championship is worth it no matter what."
I like Lebron James
"It‚Äôs not like d wade played with Shaq, Gary Payton, ray Allen, PRIME LEBRON JAMES, Chris bosh etc."
Guys like Tyler Herro could very likely have more NBA career earnings than LeBron James.  We'll have Chandler Parson's type players finessing the league and making more than Jordan+LeBron ever made in their NBA careers (NBA contracts only).
"Rookie scorers arent efficient, Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Durant, Lebron James all were inefficient."
"Kevin Harlan generally talks pretty loud and yells when it‚Äôs a hyped play, that‚Äôs just an announcing style most people like, I don‚Äôt wanna watch a game and a big dunk happens or a extraordinary pass and the announcer whispers ‚Äúgreat pass by LeBron James....‚Äù"
"Do athletic players careers not last as long? I always hear about this but I am not sure this really is the case. We all know about Derrick Rose who suffered an injury or someone like Cam Newton in the NFL but athletic players can afford to lose a step while borderline slow players can't. Like Kevin Love and Blake Griffin are both the same position and same age and 1 was an athletic freak while the other one was very skilled. They are both dropping off at around the same age. Zion Williamson isn't just really athletic, he also has really great BBIQ so I think he can be someone who continues to develop skills as he ages like Karl Malone and Lebron James did."

"OK since we're just ignoring prime years. Shaq, lebron, Ray Allen, Jimmy butler, Chris bosch.  Shaq and lebron james. That's 2 top 10 players ever right there.  Really comparing dwight, cp3, KD and westbrook all out of their primes to prime lebron james, and Shaq who wade wouldn't have even got to the finals without???"
"Durant didn't win his 2 fvmps with harden though, and harden decided at 31 to join KD off a season long injury. Wade at 29 joined a 25 year old lebron james, see the difference?    Wade literally got outplayed by lebron the entire time they played together at miami"
'Dwight literally made an all star game' Lebron james was literally the best player in the world. He literally won 2 MVPs and 2 FMVPs in Miami. 'outplayed harden in a couple playoff series' Yea and lebron outplayed wade in Miami
"He plays a lot like early lebron james (at least on the offensive end). He's an elite finisher, super agile, and can accelerate to full speed and then come to a complete stop in an instant. Plus he's basically impossible to stop once he's anywhere near the basket because he's so buff. He's not really tall enough to be a great post player though.  I think he'll really need to work on his passing and defensive iq going forward. He's athletic enough to be a great defender but he gets caught ball watching all the time and struggles with rotations. He draws enough defenders to get a solid number of assists every night but he's going to have to work on his passing going forward. Lebron is still crazy athletic obviously and I think Zion will be able to maintain a lot of his athleticism, but there'll definitely be fall off with age (just look at lebron's early cav days vs now, sure he'll do some athletic shit now and again on the lakers but back on the cavs he was relying almost entirely on being one of the greatest finishers ever. dude's head was above the rim at least once on like every play)."
"Horrible take, harden played with russ and KD... Til he was 23, then it was 8 years with the rockets with cp3 as his best teammate in that time. D wade played with shaq and a fucking prime lebron james."
Kinda crazy lebron James played 18 seasons in the nba just to prepare for this movie
Lebron B(ronny) James is an actor who has appeared in Top Class
"Actually, playing with James caused incredible sacrifice of his game. He went from being a primary top end scorer to a stand in the corner when James is on the court. Same thing happened to Bosh.   LeBron always wants bigs to box out and protect the rim, but he doesn‚Äôt want them offensively on the block as that changes how he prefers to operate offensively.   I am not saying he is wrong. The wins and rings speak. But you can‚Äôt deny that Love and Bosh both had a tremendous change in what they were asked/allowed to do offensively with King James on the court.   It should be noted that the second scorer normally has not been as impacted (Irving and Wade). With AD being the second scorer, James seems to have adjusted. This is probably a result of his high b-ball iq and the fact his game is different now that is was five or ten years ago."
"Nahhh  KD, LeBron, Evan Fournier, James Harden, Sabonis, Steph Curry  Those guys tend to murder us  There‚Äôs a bunch more"
Roses are red  Why isn‚Äôt she giving me attention  LeBron James gave  Kevin Love depression
How incredible of Lebron James to win a championship playing alongside an all nba guard who outplayed unanimous MVP Steph Curry.
"Lmao I remember that ""fit in/fit out"" shit. It was the [least cryptic cryptic message](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/12299557/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-fit-tweet-was-reference-kevin-love) ever"
#LEBRON JAMES
"Because that's the modern NBA. Threatening the opposition with the possibility of a three point shot does wonders in stretching the floor and opening up driving lanes. It's not like AD is chucking it up at will. If he's open then he should go for it because it helps out the team as a whole. Especially when opening up lanes while playing alongside LeBron James.  I mean, why are we listening to Charles Oakley in the first place? It's not like he was a super gifted scorer. AD definitely knows what he's doing out there this deep into his career."
"I'd argue the opposite. He used to be considered a borderline top 5 player. Now he's Lebron's extremely talented sidekick. Same thing happened to Wade in Miami early on. Lebron because he is so good often overshadows his teammates (not his fault, he's just Lebron freaking James)"
"Hard to be MVP in a league with Lebron James and various all-time greats too. In fact, he's prevented top-tier players from becoming truly great by beating them over and over."
‚Äúteammate had confidence in playoff lebron fucking james‚Äù
"Sometimes the NBA promotes the games more so like a circus act (‚Äúsee the leaping Celtics vs the speedy Suns tonight on ESPN!‚Äù), whereas I wish the competitiveness was highlighted more.   I remember during the 2020 finals, almost no promos were directly about the Lakers vs Heat, but rather just highlights of a single player (e.g. ‚ÄúLeBron James in the NBA Finals... only on ABC‚Äù)."

"Having LeBron and another top 10 player, especially one that compliments LeBron Fucking James so well does change the game a little bit"
 The one with LeBron James
The team with LeBron James and Anthony Davis
beat rookie since lebron james
I have two that ive seen nobody brought up (the first one is weird but hear me out)  A fully healthy 2012-2013 lakers vs miami heat finals (as a lakers fan that season was such a mess overall from the start)   The second one is the fact we never got a dwyane wade vs lebron james playoff series (the closet was probably 2016 but bosh sadly was forced into retirement and we could've saw a heat vs cavs ecf that could've gone 7 games)  That stories for that series just writes itself
"He probably meant in the spirit of the kind of circus shots he takes and how KD can make those very shots too. Of course, there's the small matter that he was teammates with LeBron James for the only title of his career before this..."
"Not with the way Anthony Davis plays in the playoffs historically. 30/10 on elite efficiency and great defense is at the very least equivalent to James Harden. LeBron/KD and Harden/AD are all equals and will cancel each other out.   But yes, Kyrie is significantly better than anyone else we have. Luckily, Nets inept defense and the Lakers incredible defense will keep the series competitive."
"Yeah, but most of that hype came when he was in high school (and like, a week in college lol).  For me, as I've gotten older, I follow high school prospects less despite watching the same amount of ball.  Idk if that holds for others, but I think it's easy to let that fall to the wayside after you've seen 10-12 ""next Lebron James"" come and go haha"
"Lebron James stats in the clutch: 4.4 points, 47.6% FG%, 39% 3PT%, 37.5% FT% (yikes)  Kyrie Irving stats in the clutch: 3.7 points, 47.5% FG%, 44% 3PT%, 88% FT%  Kevin Durant stats in the clutch: 4.3 points, 53.6% FG%, 40% 3PT%, 84.6% FT%  Lebron is definitely clutch outside of shooting free throws"
He is just salty of Mr LeBron Raymone James Sr.
I guess you're right about all that but that's not getting you another chip. I'm sorry. I think next season will be much better with west teams not dead.  I hope the warriors are one of them.  How can you not love Steph and Klay clicking? 3s are so fun to watch fall as a basketball fan.  People haven't realized yet that LeBron James is still a thing. It's been pretty much the Lakers bench all year and none of them are worried.   Think Steph and Klay beat AD and LeBron
Their team is poorly built. They got a good deal for AD and they are by no means where they could be. It's still a team hastily thrown together and now that they can see what zion and BI are like playing at that level scoring wise they can work on finding some good shooters and or some guys who can play good defense.  Idk if it's whatever scheme they run but their defense shouldn't be as bad as it is.  They are no means a guaranteed good team eventually but to say they don't have an opportunity to do so is unfair imo.  They are not a good team right now obviously. But zion and BI both have more room to grow. They still have Hart and Lonzo as of right now that have more room to blossom as well. They have a lot of young players and a team that was not built for zion. Lots of room for improvement in general.   Would I bet my money on this? No I would not but hey sometimes franchises get that break they need.  Toronto got Kawhi and Danny Green and that pushed them to the level they needed to win after years of mediocrity and lebron james sweeps. Not to mention they got fucked pretty hard. Boogie going down and then AD forcing his way out.
James Naismith team duh.  Dude can just rewrite the rules that makes Team LeBron baskets worth 50 PTs and TeamKD baskets worth 1 PTs and it‚Äôs a wrap. Team KD can‚Äôt say shit either.
The best player to jerk off China and go silent about genocide:  LeBron James
"&gt;Why Kyrie keeps winning championships  Man, idk perhaps it's because he gets to play second fiddle to a guy in Lebron James and potentially behind 2 guys in Brooklyn with KD and Harden....."
"At least you got to see a historic team!  I went to see the Warriors on opening night in 2014 against the Lakers. Klay had his then career high against Kobe. Steph also had 30 or more irc.   I really appreciate that I got to see the Splash Bros and Kobe in the same game. It's even better to know that the one game I've so far gotten to witness was the first home game on a historic run. Kobe played pretty poorly for most of the game, but in the 3rd he caught fire.  I did also get to see JJ Redick drop 30 on Portland in LA, Monta Ellis drop 34 on Washington and struggles of the early Cavs with LeBron, Kyrie and Love. Which kinda sucked because if you travel to watch LeBron James you want to see him perfom. Not just be there.   &amp;#x200B;  Jesus I wanna go back and watch some more NBA games."
"The year is 2023. The KD-is-back Warriors have broken the single season win record with 74-8 after picking up Blake Griffin for 32$/mo at the trade deadline. Steph and KD are both scoring exactly 31.2 ppg each, due to Kerr's new forced sharing policy of not letting the team's highest scorer shoot until someone else catches up. The nets subreddit is shut down in protest of their ownership trading KD for a package of now-DPOY Andrew Wiggins and James Wiseman.   After a hard fought WCF loss the year before LeBron James decided ""fuck it"" and proceeded to buy the Cleveland Cavaliers. He immediately traded Sexton, Garland, and 20 future draft picks for Himself, Chris Paul, and Carmelo Anthony. They trio meets up with Dwyane Wade in Toronto where the local LeBron fan club has custom built a giant wooden banana boat. Just as the four begin to depart Alex Caruso, who had been hiding in LeBron James' suitcase the entire time, jumps into the last seat. The team now paddles down to Ohio where they proceed to win 32 games, good for 8th seed in the east.   Oubre is now on a two way contract with the Warriors, averaging 28 seconds per game. He has demanded that the ownership ""only play him in the hype minutes"" where the score is close in the final 5 minutes. This has only happened in two games, both against the newly rebuilding lakers.    The two teams meet in the finals after historic dual 12-0 runs. LeBron, now 7'2"", is averaging 48/12/22. As the first game is about to begin, LeBron announces his retirement under the condition that Jordan fans all admit he's the goat if he wins. As the game starts the warriors reveal Kerr's latest revolutionary offensive scheme, dubbed the friendship circle. Every player on the Warriors roster scored 12 points while playing energized defense, leading to a 120-72 victory.  With all the saved energy from reducing his scoring load Blake Griffin is now averaging 12 blocks and 18 rebounds per game.The cavaliers suffer two more losses, 110-65 and 140-83. Lebron has shattered Jordan's scoring record with 70, but Skip Bayless says he is beginning to question whether LeBron has that killer instinct. Game 4 starts 70-24, LeBron heads to the locker room feeling slightly less sad than the Celtics in 2016-17. His teammates, having already given up, start to pour each other shots of Hennessey.   After a 15 minute delay, officials check the locker room only to see black smoke and pentagrams. Just as the officials are about to call the game a forfeit, LeBron James, now 11 feet tall with wings, crashes through the roof of the stadium. Two of the officials begin to question whether LeBron might be taking human growth hormone, but are both quickly fired by Adam Silver. LeBron proceeds to score 85 points over the next 19 minutes to cut the lead to 120-109. 5 minutes left.  Kelly Oubre takes off his jacket and calls on Kerr to sub him in. Kerr, desperate, agrees.   The fans, who have all but given up hope, see their former FMVP Kelly Oubre walk on stage. His energy breathes life into the Arena. With their newly energized defense they manage to hold LeBron to 74 FG%, and the additional stops raised the team's true shooting percentage by 14.8% - just enough to stay in the game. LeBron, clearly out of breath, demands his health team bring him lamb blood and wolfsbane. 150-149 warriors, 2 seconds on the clock, the warriors starting center Alen Smailagic fouls LeBron. LeBron, steps up to the line, but he knows Oubre's tricks. Oubre begins to wiggle his legs, and LeBron laughs and drains the first free throw.   However, LeBron looks back. Oubre hasn't flinched. No reaction, he continues to look straight ahead, wiggling his knees all the same. The pure matador energy radiating from this man captures the entire audience. Everyone is staring at his knees. LeBron shoots his second shot free throw and it rims out. The stadium goes berserk, people are calling Oubre the goat while analysts are saying that missing 1 free throw out of 2 is fairly common for a 70% free throw shooter. Oubre goes 1-4 in overtime but the warriors win anyways. Twitter is seeing a suspicious trend of newly created accounts near SF tweeting #KDsweptLeBronTWICE. Michael Jordan releases a documentary about how he would've won if it were him. Draymond gets FMVP for holding LeBron to 83/22/40"

Good thing Lebron James is a better coach than Vogel
"Eh. I'd say it depends. If you look at MVP award like the best player on the best team, as it usually is, it was clearly Rose. If you want to argue that he wasn't better than LeBron or Dwight in 2011, I can see the point and I'd agree with Bron being the best player in the league but Heatles wouldn't get an MVP for 2nd. Idk if I agree with Dwight, as it was more of a modern approach to the basketball that helped them dominate as much as Dwight's own dominance. And I don't particularly remember their 2011 campaign.  But the fact that we are comparing a 22 year old Rose to a 26 year old LeBron James is enough of an argument for 22 year old D Rose being better than, or at the very least as good as, 22 year old LeBron."
"Lmao where does your dumbassery end?  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lakers-injury-updates-anthony-davis-could-return-after-road-trip-lebron-james-by-end-of-april-per-report/amp/  It‚Äôs literally a fact he went down with a calf strain, but you can delude yourself. Nets in 4.  RemindMe! 2 months"
"Y'all know who he is, he is Kevin Durant. In seriousness though, KD has missed a third of the season, played 28 minutes and still made everyone look like they shouldn't even be in the same court as he is.  KD gets hated for his decisions and internet antics, but only a healthy LeBron James has been able to consistently see eye to eye with him in big games. This dude has a shot to become a Top 10 player of all time this year with a championship and that's insane to me considering how much i respect Hakeem Olajuwon."
Gotcha. You are trying to now compare players who have played with LeBron James and who  haven't played with LeBron James.  Kyrie never outplayed LeBron
 Lebron james is toxic as fuck
LeBron taking heat for passing to wide-open teammates for shots in the crunch.  Kawhi Leonard for missing the 2017-2018 season with the Spurs due to an injury.  I‚Äôve also heard some people say that James Harden comes up short in the playoffs because he ‚Äúgoes too hard‚Äù during the regular season.  Carmelo Anthony took extra tens of millions of dollars to re-sign with the Knicks rather than signing with the Bulls or Heat.
"Harden averages 22.9 points per game in his playoff career, which ranks ninth among active players behind Kevin Durant (29.1 PPG), LeBron James (28.9 PPG), Stephen Curry (26.5 PPG), Russell Westbrook (25.4 PPG), Damian Lillard (24.8 PPG), Carmelo Anthony (24.5 PPG), Kyrie Irving (23.5 PPG) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (23.0 PPG).  KD."
"Bullshit. They didn't have a primary playmaker, and Kawhi and Paul George aren't leaders. I don't care how badly they want to try against LeBron James, they weren't mentally tough enough to beat LeBron 4 times in 7 games last year. They couldn't even close out the Nuggets."
"Then it would go to LeBron James, you know, the reigning Champ and FMVP"

Dude...I miss Lebron James...wtf am I saying rn
The moronic take is you thinking AD was the number one option last year playing next to LEBRON FUCKING JAMES LMAO. You Lakers fans are genuinely special
"What? AD took the Pelicans to the playoffs in 2018, swept the Blazers and won as many games as LeBron James did against the KD Warriors.  It isn't AD's fault that Jrue Holiday couldn't stay healthy for more than one season and that Boogie seemed cursed with injuries the moment he left Sacramento. The amount of shit that Lakers/LeBrons stans give AD is absolutely astounding."
"it's the regular season, everyone knows gasol will get more minutes in the playoffs.  we crucify budenholzer every year for running the same regular season stuff and get absolutely torched.  then we have people come in with ""Vogel is being extremely stubborn with his Drummond experiment""...   yeah you know why? because Drummond is 27 and an athletic monster who can put up 20/20 on any night. If he figures out the system then it helps them tremendously for potentially multiple years. if he doesn't then gasol gets more minutes and the team which has LEBRON JAMES (the only player that actually matters) makes the finals."

"LeBron 2007 playoff victory against the favored Pistons:  In just over 16 minutes of game time, James would score 29 of Cleveland‚Äôs 30 points, including the team‚Äôs final 25 points on 11-of-13 shooting from the field. He‚Äôd force overtime on a driving dunk with nine seconds remaining and then finish the game off in double-overtime with a driving layup with two seconds left."

Lebron James Lebron James
That is a pretty America-is-the-center-of-universe claim. LeBron James isn't known only to Americans. People outside have their reasons to dislike him. They are not very likely to have delusions about American cops.
"Lebron James, the guy who's been in the public eye since he was 15 years old, has never been in any real scandal at all. If this is the best people can do, then he's a fucking choirboy. This is the dumbest ""controversy"" of the year."
"That's fair. I reckon even if he doesn't get a title Giannis will eventually surpass Kareem due to longevity and being the face of the franchise if he plays out his contract. Also just adding to my previous comment to show Giannis' elite company, here is a list of the the dudes who were the best players on a team with the best WL record in a season multiple times (since the merger).       - 6x Larry Bird.   - 5x Tim Duncan.   - 4x Michael Jordan.   - 3x Magic Johnson, LeBron James, Stephen Curry.   - 2x Giannis, Dirk, K. Malone, Rose and Parker (depending on how you see him vs Duncan in 2012 and 2014 I said they were co-best players)"
"You do realise young lebron was consistently among the best clutch players in the league? From like 07-10 there‚Äôs he was the leader in 4th quarter and clutch time scoring because of his incredible ability to attack the basket.   There‚Äôs a Ben Taylor or cleaning the glass article on it from way back, I remember following the lebron James thread on realgm player comparison board back in the day, and it was only really that outlier year in 2011 that distorted people‚Äôs opinions on him."
"Yes, when he‚Äôs been in games he‚Äôs earned and even if you don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs been in enough to get it-he‚Äôs LeBron James. The media voters will find a justification"
"Who would win, one Ohio bar or Lebron James lol"
Lebron James
"He won more playoff games against the LeBron than Budenholzer, but getting swept is bad optics.  I've seen my team get swept three times in the playoffs, and they were all against LeBron James teams. Needless to say, I'm not worried about Nate."
"&gt; There‚Äôs only so much a coach can do in the nba when going up against lebron James type players  That's fine but that's still no excuse to never win a single game in the playoffs in three out of four years. The Heat beat the Pacers 3/4 times last year and he didn't make a single adjustment to the lineup or playstyle until the last game of the plaayoffs. There was no Lebron James type player on the Celtics and the Heat and he couldn't even steal a single game at home. When the team scored 8 points in the 3rd Q in game 1 against the Celtics, he didn't adjust whatsoever and got swept. When the Cavs doubled Oladipo on every possession, he didn't make any adjustments. He insisted on starting Monta Ellis in 2017 when both CJ Miles and GR3 were playing great and, no surprise, he was so bad that the Pacers stretched his contract.  He was thoroughly outcoached by Lue, Stevens, and Spoelstra in the playoffs. The Heat sweep was the most egregious example of his ineptitude. The team was playing really well in the bubble despite Sabonis' absence. Myles Turner and TJ Warren were playing great and he couldn't even win one single game.  Even really bad teams like the Magic can win *at least* one game. He never could."
Do you think the pacers lost to a worse team when healthy? There‚Äôs only so much a coach can do in the nba when going up against lebron James type players. Same thing will probably happen to the hawks this year against a really good East team and the coach will only have so much influence when your roster is inferior.
"Lebron James is an average free throw shooter, that doesn't make him an average player.  The stupidity of this place.."

"""Lebron James and AD"""
"&gt; AD played one game of limited minutes since his injury, fully healthy lol.  Limited minutes does not mean he‚Äôs not fully healthy. Did you watch that game? It was a rust issue. He was moving as well as ever.  &gt;Gobert is at his peak now, wait and see what trouble he gives AD if they meet in the playoffs.  &gt;Utah lost both the last two years as underdogs. This year they will have home court, at altitude, with one of the loudest home arenas. Conley is playing the best basketball of his career. Mitchell has evolved as a playmaker. Clarkson and Ingles will finish top 2 in 6th man voting. Gobert is having one of the best defensive seasons in modern NBA history.  And yet, they will still be heavy underdogs.  &gt;I am not gonna count out LeBron James in a series, but I see nothing to suggest that it's a particularly good matchup for the Lakers.  Of course you don‚Äôt."

"&gt; Royce is a borderline all NBA defender he will do fine against LeBron. Obviously LeBron will get his because he is LeBron, but Royce is a very solid option.  He‚Äôll probably average 35/10/10 if that‚Äôs the case.    &gt;AD will face Gobert when he comes anywhere near the paint.  Have you ever watched them play?  &gt;Whos guarding all of Utah's 40+% three point shooters?  The same players who guarded Damian Lillard, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, CJ McCollum, and Jamal Murray last playoffs. Oh and the law of averages.  Did I mention they‚Äôre the #1 defense this season with LeBron and AD missing 40+ games combined?"
Fuck LeBron Bum James. Thinks he's some speaker for everybody or something because he throws a fuckin ball in a hoop. Fuck that piece of shit. The dude needs to get off his horse. We don't need people who are going to add more fucking bullshit onto the pile of shit we're already laying on. We need people on both sides of the coin who aren't fueled by fucking hate. That's the mother fucking reason we're here in the first place. Childish fucking petty bullshit from grown as fucking icons people look up to. bullshit
"&gt; LeBron hasn't won a playoff game in Utah yet either.   Ha   &gt;His team's struggle there and they should be worried about playing in Utah come playoff time.  Lmfao   &gt;It's definitely not a good matchup for the Lakers. Utah are one of the few teams that can matchup well defensively with the Lakers, and the Jazz's offense will be a huge mismatch.  Who‚Äôs guarding LeBron James and Anthony Davis? Royce O‚ÄôNeal and Bojan Bogdanovic? Lmfao"
"I mean, if anyone were to be in our heads it would be Lebron for beating us during the 73-9 season. But I like Lebron and James Harden so I guess they are in my head rent free, because I enjoy watching them."
Drummond is not a quality option. You are delusional if you think Rudy fucking Gobert and Donovan Mitchell are going to be competitive against LeBron James and Anthony Davis.
https://fox8.com/sports/ohio-bar-owner-refuses-to-show-nba-games-until-lebron-james-is-expelled/
I don't know if you watched those teams...Dumars wasn't better. No one who watched those games with a straight face can say that.  Dumars without Thomas playing at a high-level was not good and neither were the Pistons.  Just think of it like this. In 30 years someone will be looking at stats and saying LeBron James played well in the 2011 NBA Finals. When everyone who watched that series knows he didn't. We saw those games and how plays transpired.

Anthony Davis.  Davis has been one of the most valuable defensive players in the NBA this season (some would even argue the most valuable) but his value to the Lakers specifically has shined through in the postseason, where he‚Äôs been able to show his defensive versatility in multiple positions. Through 10 playoff games, the Lakers posted a defensive rating of 101.4 with Davis on the court and a defensive rating of 113.7 off of the court. His point differential of -12.3 is the highest point of anyone on the team. Alex Caruso is second with -10.1.‚Äù  You can check this site if you wanna make comparisons: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/  This is coming from someone who almost never uses defensive stats, i do think the eye test holds more weight which is why i usually like to refer to video evidence."

Plus all 5 of these guys are or can be high intensity showtime players, combining the best shooting, finishing, and post dominance in NBA history. I don't know if this 5 beats one of the more balanced classic GOAT lineups that include MJ, Magic, etc but imo it'd be the most entertaining 5 man lineup possible."
"If we can give every team 1 Lebron James, that'd be the right amount of parity."
Kawhi had an impressive series with a remarkable 27.0 game score. I looked up the highest for a NBA finals series and if you consider the round vs the Sixers the finals he almost would have made the top 10.

Has anybody actually seen Lebron James &amp; James Harden in the same room together????
Yeah he only destroyed his old team's season to join LeBron James bc he couldn't hack it in the west. Now he gets to play second fiddle and act like he's the man when he scores 20 in a regular season game against a midpack east team.
"neither of those players are remotely as dominating as AD, let alone Lebron Raymone James Sr."
"Lmaooo just peeped the flair too ""LeBron James"""
I'm starting to think this LeBron James guy is pretty good too.
and then add playing for the Lakers who has Lebron James for extra difficulty.
"Fine because we have LeBron James and Anthony Davis. The only things I‚Äôm worried about are chemistry, health and Andre Drummond missing a million wide open shots at the rim"
"Again, we have LeBron James who has probably 2-3 good years left max.  THT wouldn't have finished his development then and he'll be an RFA soon. Schroder will be a UFA.  If there's a chance to flip those players into better win now assets you do it."
&gt;LeBron James flair
"Live by the THT, die by the THT. That was a lot of turnovers but that's what happens with your 4th string play maker. Really fun game, could be an amazing finals series? Remember, both Lebron James and RJ didn't show up today."
"2018 NBA Finals Game 1. Lebron James and shooters against Steph (top 3 player), KD (top 7 player), Klay (top 25 player), and Draymond (top 25 player). The game was not conventional basketball. The game was Lebron‚Äôs game and he dictated how it was going to be played. Lebron was clearly the best player on the court w Steph and KD.   Lebron is clearly the best basketball player on earth today."
imagine forgetting Lebron James exists
LeBron James Harden returns on the same day.  Coincidence? I think not!
I agree that Lebron James is hated because he's a racist and promotes racist ideas.
"LeBron James on every teammate since after his Cavalier days: ""It's so valuable to have someone who can count to be there every night."""
"Lebron ""Day-to-Davis"" James"
"I mean, considering LeBron on his own is arguably the GOAT...I'd say giving him the positive traits of all-time scorer James Harden and also James Wiseman removes the ""arguably""."
Lebron James
A fully healthy LeBron James on this Warriors team would be higher than the 8th seed.
Jimmy Butler outdueled LeBron fucking James in two finals games.   How quickly people forget ffs
"I think that's overstating it a bit for the Eastern Conference. Definitely more true in the West at that time though.  -  Eastern Conference centers in the playoffs that season:  * Chicago: Joakim Noah * Miami: Joel Anthony * Boston: Jermaine O'Neal * Orlando: Dwight Howard * Atlanta: Al Horford * New York: Amare Stoudemire * Philadelphia: Elton Brand * Indiana: Roy Hibbert  -  Eastern Conference small forward in the playoffs that season:  * Chicago: Luol Deng  * Miami: LeBron James * Boston: Paul Pierce * Orlando: Hedo Turkoglu * Atlanta: Josh Smith * New York: Carmelo Anthony * Philadelphia: Andre Iguodala * Indiana: Danny Granger  -  The centers are hit-or-miss, but the SFs are absolutely stacked."
"Steph Curry   Michael Jordan   LeBron James   Larry Bird   Shaquille O'Neal   Curry and Bird provide all-time shooting, while the two GOATs do GOAT shit. Shaq's presence in the post means a lot of teams will have to double him, and I'd back the shooting among the other four to more than punish them from the outside; especially considering the ability they all have to make the right read of the play."
Lebron James was robbed of finals MVP in 2015.
Lebron four easily just a far better player and also the best player in the league. Worthy might not have been a top 10 player in the league at his prime. Lebron at this age is still better at every facet of the game no disrespect to ‚Äúbig game james‚Äù
Would you rather have James Worthy/Pau Gasol for 10 years or Lebron for 4?
"Lebron James is my favorite team. It all started after the decision. I couldn‚Äôt fathom the hate he was getting from making a show of it with all proceeds to charity. I get that it was a bit narcissistic but if it‚Äôs for a good cause, who gives a shit.   I just root for the guy and want him and his team to win. He‚Äôs a good player, teammate, leader, father, and public image.  I don‚Äôt live in the US if that helps."
Lebron James hasn't been the best player in the league for at least three years.
"Dad was a Lakers fan and for some reason I just decided to be a Bulls fan when I was young.  Was never super into NBA at a young age, just gave my dad and I something to talk about.    Did not watch much until I did a book report in school titled King James: Believe the Hype.  Learned about LeBron more and more and started watching his games in the NBA.  Just became a mega fan of his.  Started learning more about NBA history and loved watching the Spurs and the Lakers.    DRose years had me inspired to be a Bulls fan again as I was from Illinois down near MO.  And I loved watching Bulls vs. Cavs/Miami in the playoffs.  Basically in awe of LeBron James while wanting the Bulls to win it all again.  I've just never really been a fan of a single team.  I guess I root for Lakers now that LeBron is on it but I still love watching other teams like the Mavs and Wizards.     Just an all around fan.  Maybe the Bulls will be great again someday!  Though, I very much dislike the Bears and the Cubs.  So that I guess is my main reason for never committing to be a hardcore Bulls fan."
"&gt; Also Steph was absolutely robbed of finals MVP in 2015  Honestly, they should have just pulled the Jerry West and given it to Lebron.    &gt;James also became the first player in NBA Finals history to lead both teams in points, assists, and rebounds for the entire series. He averaged 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists for the series, although he shot 39.8% throughout the series"
"I live in Columbus, OH. Family is from here. My three fav teams are Nets, Wolves, and Cavs, in that order.  I grew up in NJ, was a big fan in the Kidd/Carter years, but one of my favorite players was Kevin Garnett. When I moved to Ohio, I kind of lost interest, started rooting for the Cavs as they were localish and they had this kid named Lebron who was pretty alright.  Then when they moved to Brooklyn (and James went to Miami) I started to follow the Nets again. Been my main team since, especially when Dlo (former Buckeye) was on the team.  Now, Dlo is on the Wolves, as have been two other Buckeyes recently (KBD and Evan Turner), so I've been following them the last few years."
Ah yes Michael Jordan. A man known for getting out the first round several times before Scottie arrived. (He didn't for any first season was 2015'ers reading)  Should be the LeBron James Playoff MVP
I never said anything about Luka I think he‚Äôs just as bad I hate watching him. And Lebron doesn‚Äôt do that James harden bullshit where he runs to the free throw line and stops on a dime and the defender slightly touches him and he falls to the floor. That‚Äôs a Luka/Trae/Harden play.
"The reality is Anthony Davis is in peak form and LeBron James looks to be healthy going into the playoffs. So believe what you want. As long as those two are available, the Lakers will be favored in every series."

Soon he'll have to decide whether to sign a long-term extension with the Thunder, but this week he's been in Spain promoting the NBA 3x Tour, a series of streetball and three-on-three events sponsored by Spanish bank and NBA partner BBVA.

On whether he'll remain with the Thunder after this season:  ""It's decisions, but I love the Thunder. I'm excited to be here. I think we've definitely grown a brotherhood, so hopefully I'll definitely want to be in Oklahoma.""  On the appeal of the Thunder:  ""We're young, and we're exciting. I think that's why everybody likes us a lot, because we're exciting and we get the job done. We've got to just keep doing it and win games.""  On his continued development:  ""I've got to improve.

James (Lebron/Harden/Wiseman) is arguably the goat.
"That's a lot of words for barely anything said. The question is why people are skeptical of the Jazz and Suns come playoff time. The answer has nothing to do with market size.  If the Jazz or Suns had Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic, or Steph Curry, they'd be taken more seriously and they wouldn't even have to relocate! Sometimes it's that simple.  The NBA is a superstar-driven league where the champion *almost always* has a widely-considered-to-be top 5/10 talent, if not several. Many strong regular season teams have folded in the face of a superstar in the playoffs, and some people here have watched long enough to learn from this. The exceptions exist, but are rare."

If your suggestion is to ignore what doesn‚Äôt seem to make sense then it returns back to a subjective evaluation of the data and at that point the LEBRON measurement is pretty damn useless. This has been essentially my critique of all these holistic player measurements.

1. Russel Westbrook - 182 2. Oscar Robertson - 181 3. Magic Johnson - 138 4. Jason Kidd - 107 5. LeBron James - 99 6. Wilt Chamberlain - 78 7. Larry Bird - 59 8. James Harden - 58 9. Nikola Jokiƒá - 56 10. Fat Lever - 43 11. Luka Doncic - 35  We used to consider Jason Kidd a Triple Double Machine.
LeBron James said if would be impossible for him to average a triple double. He was asked about it in a interview and he said he doesn't think he would be able to since it takes so much energy.   Many superstars have talked about it. Stamina plays a huge factor and they can't just do 100% all game long. Russ is very special because he can just keep attacking all game
He‚Äôd be Lebron James
"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine  As well as front court players like:  -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  This was from 9 days ago, so maybe he's eclipsed some of these players since then but my point still stands."

"How about that guy on your tag, Melo? It's like watching a better Bernard King. Or LeBron James. As much as I can't stand him, he is 100% otherworldly. And Embiid. He's like Hakeem/Kareem with modern skills and Shaq size. Speaking of Shaq, Zion is like young Shaq meets Shawn Kemp."
He‚Äôs no James Lebron
yea bro lebron james isnt one of the best players of all time
"And what a surprise, suddenly Lebron James Harden are both probable to return just in time for the playoffs"
It's also a necessity if you're LeBron James. The media would love to expose him and create hit pieces off the things he says without thinking too much about it. I don't think we can even understand the amount of eyes on LeBron and every word he says. Even slight mishaps will cause a shitstorm on him so he has to be vary to protect his brand and the brand of the NBA.
"People are acting like LeBron didn't look like post-injury 2019 LeBron the last time he played a game, if he ain't 100% the Knicks can absolutely beat the Lakers and most likely will.  LeBron James should be a legitimate concern for the Lakers right now, if he ain't 100% by the playoffs, the Lakers won't win the West, plain and simple and if recent history helps at anything, the last time LeBron had a significant injury and cameback, he led the Lakers to an 8-13 record.  If LeBron and AD are healthy by the time the playoffs starts, the Lakers are the favourites in the West by a decent margin, but if LeBron isn't, they are drawing dead, AD can win them a series at most."
LeBron James
"No lol  Last LeBron tweet was 6 days ago.   &gt;Lakers star LeBron James is expected to miss back-to back games on Thursday (Clippers) and Friday (Blazers) to rest his right ankle, sources tell ESPN. James will proceed cautiously with ankle injury as playoffs approach."
"I agree difficulty is all relative to expectations and pressure and Lue definitely had a lot of that, but at the end of the day, he still had Lebron James on his team"
Bill Simmons' most hated player lineup:  PG: Trae Young  SG: James Harden  SF: LeBron James  PF: AD by default I guess? He hated on him plenty through the trade  C: Dwight always and forever
"I did not add age to influence opinion.  I added age for the context of when I started watching the NBA.  There could be more difficult seasons, but I'm not familiar with them myself.    Anyway:  [Link](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2921469-lakers-lebron-james-says-hes-won-the-2-hardest-championships-in-nba-history)  ""And then what we went through in the bubble. And if you were not in the bubble, you don't quite understand it. You will never, ever understand how hard it was to win that championship, to be able to motivate yourself to be out of‚Äîthis is literally out of your whole comfort zone. No family. I didn't see my family for eight-and-a-half weeks.""   LeBron is talking about his experience in the bubble.  What do you mean the players prepare for this their whole lives?  It was a totally new basketball experience.  Some players Opted out.  How often do a % of players Opt out of parts of a season and the playoffs?"
"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lebron-james-i-won-the-two-hardest-championships-in-nba-league-history. I'm not here to define someones world view, if you agree with what he said here that's your prerogative. You're not going to get me to agree with this statement however"
"it never guarantees it tho. Only 7 different teams from the East have won the Finals since like 1980. Cleveland because Lebron James was born there and Toronto because they rented Kawhi.  Look at minnesota and the kings. Been awful for years  Even GS was garbage for 25+ years until they hit. And it wasn‚Äôt top top picks either, just lucky ones Steph was 7, klay 11, draymond in the second round.  And say the Nets beat the Sixers this year. That mean their tank still hasn‚Äôt worked and they‚Äôve gotten nothing out of being god awful for 3-4 years.  I‚Äôll take 4th seed with a shot every year over completely awful for 3-4 years and then maybe hitting on some draft picks and still getting nothing"
"well, LeBron James and Anthony Davis are still under contract and power rankings are intended to predict future performance, not report on past performance (we have standings for that)"
And just toss in one Lebron James on top ;)
"Exactly, all they did was be trash for years and just acquire lebron James cuz they‚Äôre near Hollywood. If the Lakers can do it so can any team tbh"
"Seriously, they failed their way to LeBron James and Anthony Davis lmao"
"One of the most efficient high-volume scorers in league history. Here‚Äôs a list of every player with multiple seasons of TS% of .62+, usage of 25+ and 1,000+ MP, and how many times they did it:    Kevin Durant ‚Äî 7   Steph Curry ‚Äî 6   Adrian Dantley ‚Äî 5   LeBron James ‚Äî 3   Giannis Antetokounmpo ‚Äî 2   Charles Barkley ‚Äî 2   Amare Stoudemire ‚Äî 2   Karl-Anthony Towns ‚Äî 2    That‚Äôs the list. In addition to that, there‚Äôs only 11 other guys with 1 such season.    Dantley was an amazing individual scorer. Pretty selfish player though, and a lot guys reportedly didn‚Äôt like playing with or coaching him. Probably the standard bearer of empty scorers."
"It's crazy lol, Kyrie puts up worse stats than Dame while facing far less defensive attention throughout his career. The only reason the comparison is made is because LeBron James happened to be born in northeast Ohio."
Lebron james johnson
Lebron James.
hot take:   LeBron James Worthy would beat LeBron James Harden   you give Worthy‚Äôs post game with LeBron‚Äôs body and he‚Äôs scoring every single play in 2 on 2
"Wit both teams fully healthy, i dont see the Jazz beating the Lakers in a 7 game series. AD cooks Gobert for the most part then there is the Lebron James problem. Playoff Lebron is still a different animal."
"Uhhh they also have two dudes named Anthony Davis and Marc Gasol lol.   And oh yeah, they also have a fella named Lebron James."
"**Most recent championship runs**  Kevin Durant averaged 29.0 points, 7.8 rebounds and 4.7 assists on 49/34/90 in 21 games in the 2018 playoffs. He won his second Finals MVP award and his second NBA championship.  Kawhi Leonard averaged 30.5 points, 9.1 rebounds and 3.9 assists on 49/38/88 in 24 games in the 2019 playoffs. He won his second Finals MVP award and his second NBA championship.  LeBron James averaged 27.6 points, 10.8 rebounds and 8.8 assists on 56/37/72 in 21 games in the 2020 playoffs. He won his fourth Finals MVP award and his fourth NBA championship.  -------  **Most recent playoff runs**   Kawhi Leonard averaged 28.2 points, 9.3 rebounds and 5.5 assists on 49/33/86 in 13 games in the 2020 playoffs.  Kevin Durant averaged 32.3 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.5 assists on 51/44/90 in 12 games in the 2019 playoffs.  LeBron James averaged 27.6 points, 10.8 rebounds and 8.8 assists on 56/37/72 in 21 games in the 2020 playoffs. He won his fourth Finals MVP award and his fourth NBA championship.  --------   Keep in mind here that Kawhi's stats are similar, arguably better (depending on what you value), without being on a superteam or even having a fellow superstar on his team (in my opinion, Paul George is borderline, not a superstar but a star. If you think he's a superstar, that's fine, but he's undeniably worse than Curry/AD. KD and LeBron have had better teams around them than Kawhi has). Kawhi's Raptors/Clippers supporting cast pale in comparison to LeBron's Cavs/Heat/Lakers and KD's Thunder/Warriors/Nets.   Again, everything except the stats are OPINIONS, and I have my own, and you can have your own. Please stop following me around and being weird about this. It's just basketball man"
"&gt;The commentary in the clip even mentions ‚Äúgrabbing a player around the neck.‚Äù  Right, which Crowder does not do.   Watch the actual actions instead of just what people say about it.  Crowder grabs Lebron on the shoulders as Lebron goes by. He only makes contact with Lebron's neck after the play is over and Lebron has completely turned around *because* Crowder was holding on to Lebron James to keep him from falling or getting hurt."
"I remember Lebron ""best playoff performer"" James getting clamped by JJ barea. Lebron fans so insecure about kawhi they just cant shut up."
Oh c'mon you had two stints with LeBron freaking James. It ain't that bad.
I stg people in here are so reactionary or just wanna be Stephen A's. Imagine being over the age of 10 and thinking Lebron James is weak willed lmao. Then 99% of other players must have no will at all or be negative willed.
The future has a banner hanging in one of the scenarios and still has Lebron James.
It‚Äôs almost like their 2 superstars missed half the season ü§Ø  Also what the fuck do u mean by ‚Äúit‚Äôs not the bubble‚Äù lmao this is LeBron James ur talking about

0. Tha same number as LeBron James and Dwayne Wades Stevens got to coach.
"LeBron James can't take Beasley one-on-one.  He's my GOAT, but he ain't the best at everything.  I still like Jordan and KD over Harden, though."
Lebron James or Steph?
You would take James Harden over Lebron James...
2-2 split with lebron fkn James on your team and you think you're done? Wowzers
"Lakers   SG   Kobe, West, Michael Cooper 8x all-defense and a DPOY, Gail Goodrich   Small forward Lebron, Elgin Baylor, James worthy   Center   Wilt, Shaq, Kareem, Mikan,"
The GOAT vs Lebron James
"Some observations:  Chris Paul looks like he's largely recovered from that shoulder injury. Had his best game of the series thus far - 18 points and 9 assists on 0 turnovers.  Deandre Ayton had another solid game - 14 points on 6-8 shooting, 17 rebounds and 2 steals - 0 turnovers as well.  The Lakers' fate is very much measured by Anthony Davis in this series. He plays badly in Game 1, they lose. He plays great in Games 2 and 3, they win. He plays gimpy in Game 4, they lose.  Now, for the elephant in the room - LeBron James. He's been solidly consistent, and his impact numbers bear it out, but he still hasn't had a transcendent, series defining performance. Will Game 5 be it?"
Lebron James: Into the Multiverse! I don't really understand what you're getting at with this post or what discussion there is to be had. His career is obviously one of the best ever and like any long great career there were a million little things along the way that could have gone differently....   but didn't...
"Thank you! We have Lebron fucking James, this dude took Dellevadova to 6 wins against the 72 win Warriors. I know he‚Äôs older and is recovering himself but we can do this shit!"
You‚Äôre the first lakers fan to underestimate the power of Lebron James lol  This dude has carried worse rosters than what the Lakers have. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he ends this in 6 or 7.
You have Lebron James. Your backup center is Marc Gasol. Your team is absolutely stacked. You get more star calls than anyone in the league. Stop it already.
I‚Äôm not talking about dudes his age I‚Äôm taking about MVP candidate and contender for greatest player ever Lebron James
Lebron James isn't how aging works
Soon to be eliminated? The series is tied and even without AD I wouldn't count Lebron James out

Anybody saying this series is over has forgot about Lebron Fucking James. Biggest competitor in history other than Kobe. This will still be a series for sure.
Lebron James faked an injury just to play against the suns 2nd unit. Dude sat the entire first quarter just to do so lmaoooo

"LOL what? Not every player is lebron james with a court in their house. Some players were legitimately locked down. Other things like chefs and PT were probably also only had by the lebron‚Äôs of the league.  Also, the argument that ‚Äúeveryone had to deal with the same bubble‚Äù also doesn‚Äôt hold water when these were not the circumstances everyone signed up for. Like imagine if you were forced to work from home and your performance declined. You didn‚Äôt sign up for this shit, and it‚Äôs not a good indicator of how you‚Äôd perform otherwise.   Maybe ‚Äúfraud‚Äù isn‚Äôt the right word, but it would be disingenuous to claim the playoffs last year were equivalent to all other playoffs. The heat got swept. Yes there are some changes, but both teams brought back mostly the same squad (Jrue is the biggest addition, but it‚Äôs crazy to think Jrue is only reason a 1-4 loss turns into a 4-0 sweep). The Heat definitely overperformed, that‚Äôs why people are calling them ‚Äúfrauds‚Äù."
"He was a notable loss for sure, just tired of people acting like he was literally Lebron James for us."
"Definitely smart we don't go down that road. I believe the people who are firmly ""anti-lebron"" are that way because of his fans and the media shoving him down our throats. At Tim Duncan's Hall of Fame induction he was asked about what he said to Lebron after the first finals by Rachel Nichols ‚ÄúAfter the final game, you said ‚Äòthis is going to be your league, appreciate you giving us a year,‚Äô what was that moment like?‚Äù This is Tim Duncan's moment not Lebron James but Tim Duncan has to answer a question about Lebron James on the day he is celebrating the achievements of his life's work. It got boiled down to, what was it like to play against Lebron.   The huge amount of hatred for lebron is because of his fans and how the media pushes him for everything. A very small percent of his haters are because of his play on the court."
"Yeah the whole ""buBbLe FrAUd hEaT cUlTuRe"" circlejerk for the last day has been tiring. Its the only thing that really bothers me about this sub; feels like theres a sizable portion of people here who dont actually care about basketball, they are just here to jump on whatever hate bandwagon is currently active. They get their memes and copypasted comments ready and just sit on r/new until whatever team/player that is currently the hate target loses. Clippers, Paul George, LeBron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Trae Young etc. It goes way beyond legitimate criticism and just ends up being a circlejerk where the frontpage will be covered with just ""x team/player sucks"" for a couple days and the comment sections are worse than twitter replies. Like when this sub turned into the official Paul George haters club for a week before suddenly remembering caring about mental health. I come here for basketball and memes, not to see the sub used as megaphone for venting your personal frustrations.       Like look at the posts yesterday when Miami lost, literally within seconds I saw people posting long ass hate comments they had clearly typed out in advance and were just waiting to copypaste spam the PGT with. Like how fucking sad is that? We had like 10 different frontpage posts that were all shitting on Miami or Butler in some form. Comment sections just full of insanely bitter 76ers/Bucks/Celtics fans that have apparently been seething since the last playoffs and waiting for their chance to do some hating.  Like yeah it was kinda embarrasing for the Heat to get swept, but did they really do anything that bad to get this level of hate? Saying that you are locked in is too arrogant? Losing against the reigning MVP and DPOY who just added Jrue+Tucker to an already solid roster? I can understand getting some shadeunfreude after getting your ass beat last year, but cmon man it gets embarrasing when you got Raptors flairs out here spamming comments about how embarrasing and trash the Heat are whilst finishing 12th. Even the official Bucks twitter account out here being petty posting cocky fan tweets that hade like 3 likes on em, like thats not something you can dig up from every fanbase on twitter.    If the Clippers end up losing I will prob just unsub cause the amount of concentrated hate in this subreddit will be enough to literally resurrect Hitler."
I agree .. this is a dumbass post... Similar to 'Is LeBron James the luckiest player in the NBA' Or saying that LeBron won 2016 finals just because of Kyrie
"Honestly, it's even crazier because the entire world had seen a similar film before starring Lebron James.  People would trash him for destroying defenses in the regular season but disappearing in the playoffs, so he change to an elite ""support player"" mode and started collecting rings.  Now, it's a basic blueprint for LBJ championship teams: Lebron + another All Star + perimeter shooters."
LeBron and Luka are Forwards that run Point and James Harden is a Guard that runs Point.
yeah here's my lineup  PG: LeBron James (2020)  SG: LeBron James (2013)  SF: LeBron James (2016)  PF: LeBron James (2018)  C: LeBron James (2009)
"James and Luka are point gaurds. LeBron switches throughout the game, a point forward."
"&gt;Yeah I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre way past today‚Äôs humans breaching the top 100 of physical athleticism.  It‚Äôs hard to comprehend but with intelligent discovery we have strived to make our existence easier.  Yes, but we're smart enough now to figure out the answer -- and we've invented the perfect tool to do so, the reality TV show!  Stick LeBron James, DK Metcalf, Eliud Kipchoge, Usain Bolt, Jan ≈Ωelezn√Ω, and James Lawrence on an island stocked with game, with nothing but their birthday suits and a knife, and see who lives the longest.  If they all die before the season ends, modern humans lose."
"Heat deserved this sweep and this line big time. Those dummy's should've tried harder to pull off a deal for James Harden. On the Flippy flop, all the best to the Bucks. Watching them go down in the playoffs these past few years has given me some gnarly flashbacks to some first run Lebron Cavs teams."
Lebron is a 3/4 who can bring the ball up and pass better than most point guards hence the point forward was born. James and Luka are both PGs.
You think exploring Lebron James trades one year into his contract would‚Äôve been a good idea and I‚Äôm delusional lmao
"Idk I think it's all about having one where you go ""1 man army"" that makes it all worth.  Dwayne Wade has 3...but many reference his 2006 the most if not all the time since it was mostly just him.  Lebron James has 4...but many reference his 2016 the most since it was mostly just him.  Even if KD gets his 3rd, it just won't mean anything more or less than the GSW rings.  Sadly same for Harden I feel."
"What is the criteria?  Are we talking about putting the best team on the floor?  Or honoring players' service to a franchise?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;G: Derek Fisher G: Kobe Bryant F: LeBron James F: Pau Gasol C: Shaquille O'Neal  If we're talking about putting the best team on the floor, I would be very tempted to move James to the point, and go with James/Bryant/Odom/Davis/O'Neal.  That team is crazy long and good luck getting a rebound off us, at either end."
"‚ÄúAnd with the first pick of the 2024 NBA Draft, the Orlando Magic select a Bronny James‚Äù  LeBron: Fuck"
"Its been shit show since they fired Mike Fratello &amp; Wayne Embry was pushed out in the late 90s after only one bad season even though they weathered so many injuries pushing the Cavs to the playoffs for years longer than they shouldve. Lebron James might be the only reason they dont have a longer playoff drought than Minny; they fall to 2 &amp; take Darko, I see nothing but 2 decades of misery."
"superstars are a different tier. or at least you can't put james harden, lebron james, and westbrook in the same category as jimmy."
Still a laughably awful take. Mark Jackson even agreed. Do you honestly think the lakers should have explored trading Lebron James one year into his contract?
Kendrick Perkins is the same age as Lebron James
Lebron James?
Lol you were successful because Lebron James liked beaches
Lebron James has won undefined% more FMVPs than Ja
"Yeah, but its a twitter poll. If there was a twitter poll ""would you trade Marcus Smart for Lebron James"" then I might click no just because Marcus Smart is life and I want to show him love. But if I was Ainge then I would probably make that trade."
"Because of Lebron James, not ‚ÄòHeat culture‚Äô"
What's your point?  A 20 year old put Lebron James on a poster in a Game 7 to go to the Finals as a rookie.
Dwade phantom fouls  Lebron James  Lebron james ray Allen
"Most guys in the league don't win shit, especially with LeBron and KD constantly stacking the deck in their favor.  Since Jimmy's been in the league, six players have been the best player on a finals team - LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Tim Duncan, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, and Jimmy Butler.  Since Jimmy's been in the league, the only players that have won shit are LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Tim Duncan, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Kyle Lowry, and Anthony Davis."
Yes because he plays with LeBron fucking James  you're definitely underrating Davis' impact.
He‚Äôs 16 rn so he will be a really nice 19 year old. Easily the best teenager since LeBron James
Luka will never ever be better than Lebron James. Won't be top 10 or even 15 all time like people are already crowning him
Idk if he just tells the league he's actually LeBron james there's no violation and he's ok.
‚ÄúLakers should trade Lebron James‚Äù- JVG 2019
"Wasnt the clippers the obvious favourite against the nuggets?   Dray got suspended in game 5 and curry was injured before the playoff. We played lebron james in his fucking prime with 2 all stars and solid supporting cast.   The clippers choked double digits lead in game 5,6,7 too."
"This is the most ridiculous narrative. You really think the treatment of IT was why AD refused to go literally anywhere other than the lakers? It‚Äôs not like he specifically said ‚Äúno Celtics‚Äù, he said he would not re-sign anywhere other than LA. He must have had issues with all other franchises previous treatment of players as well  Maybe, just maybe, the allure of Los Angeles, the Lakers franchise and Lebron James is why AD demanded to go to the Lakers.... though now that I think about it, you may be right that it was more rooted in AD being upset with how the Celtics organization treated IT.  Goddam the stupidity in this sub sometimes is mind blowing."
How is A worse  A is losing to LeBron Freakin James
Defense wins championships if you have lebron james and anthony davis to run your offense.
"Lebron James turned 19 one month into his rookie season, and was net negative player that first year. He certainly wouldn‚Äôt have been a positive player 2 years earlier."
"Kevin Durant has always been in LeBron‚Äôs shadow. Tonight, he looked a hell of a lot like LeBron James at his best."
&gt;To accomplish something that not even Michael Jordan or LeBron James ever accomplished.   Yeah because he's KEVIN DURANT!
Didn't LeBron James drive the Cavaliers to defeat said 73 win team in the NBA finals or am I thinking of another 73 win team led by Stephen Curry?
Durants only weakness was lebron james and the 73-9 warriors
"not to shit on durant here but his career path is taking an similar trajectory in the vein of lebron james.  he's now in the 2nd cavs team territory where his superteam got decimated by injuries despite being the favorite,"
"Overtaken who? You only can put one name before KD in the last decade, and that name is LeBron James."
"""We have to do better, I have to do better. He's a great player but we can't let any opponent drop 50 on us"" or some shit  Even if you're slightly obvious that you're downplaying your opponent you never gas them up while they're kicking your ass  LeBron ""there's no rivalry between us"" James only started acknowledging your team/Steph after you became an injury-riddled non-playoff team"
Kevin Durant is better than Lebron James. Simple as that.
I can come up with a list of 5 players not on the first team that could beat the 1st team (with only one player even being on the 2nd or 3rd team):      1- LeBron James    2 - James Harden   3 - Jason Tatum      4 - Kevin Durant   5 - Anthony Davis
Didn't he say it was lebron during the regular season lol  https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/3/9/22321580/giannis-antetokounmpo-says-lebron-james-still-best-player-nba
"I mean, the Bucks roster doesn't contain someone with an incredible basketball IQ  like Chris Paul or LeBron James. You can't expect players to independently identify every crack and weakness in your opponent's game - that's literally the coach's job. Giannis is a magnificent physical specimen that could be used to utterly destroy your opponent, but you have to know how to use tools to benefit from them. Bud was out there trying to pick a lock with a chainsaw without realizing the door is made of wood."
"If they bring a championship to LA and continue their community work in Inglewood, where the new stadium is, and bring in kids from the area to see the Clippers live. Then YES, the Los Angeles Clippers will be seen as a viable team here in LA.  Remember the Lakers are the glam and glitter of Hollywood, while the Clippers are the rough and rugged streets of Compton and Inglewood.  Especially with Lebron ""Leaving a playoff game early while your teammates are still playing"" James garnering ill perception from the thousands of Kobe fans. That incident turned off many of my family and friends who are lifelong Laker fans. One of them telling me ""Kobe would never have done that""."
"&gt;If any other player in the league not named Lebron James  Yeah, he's one of the greatest players of all time and they're not, get over this"
whether jeff green hit his shots or not is irrelevant to the performances of lebron james and kevin durant
"You think playing him when hes so injured he couldn't even score 10 fucking points, as james harden, is going to help him in any way? And yes. You ARE a bandwagon fan. Kyrie and lebron are my two favorite players and I'm not out here simping for either of them or rocking a lakers or nets flair. Look that word up bro lmao. Tell me how it doesnt apply to you."
"Soo. Steph Curry who couldn't even make it into the playoffs. Lebron James who barely played and is hobbled and Julius Randle who may be good but no love for Trae Young or Donovan Mitchell?  Luka Doncic who can't get out of the first rd?  I whole-heartedly disagree with HALF of this list.  Oh yeah, did I miss Kevin Durant????!!!  Who picks Playoff P over KD?  No Booker?"
Lebron James 51
"Cuz from an FO standpoint Lebron may still hold more value than a guy like Tatum or Giannis because it‚Äôs LeBron James  Age is **a** factor, not the only one"
"&gt;With Luka clearly being the most valuable player in the NBA from a Front Office standpoint, who is the second most valuable player in the league?  &gt;A few things matter to this I feel. Age, offensive skill, defensive skill, contract, and that x-factor.  &gt;Candidate wise a few guys come to mind. Jayson Tatum, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Zion Williamson, LeBron James, Devin Booker, and Donovan Mitchell  &gt;Who do you guys think the second most valuable player is in the NBA and if you have the time, why?  &gt;Edit: I forgot Jokic"
"straw man. do you really think people are going around recording, saving, and uploading inbound highlights lol? how about you go find me lebron james college highlights? can you read?"
"They were all on trajectory to do great, if they stayed they would‚Äôve been just as good. Clarkson was traded to make room for them to sign Lebron in the offseason, DLo was traded because of off the court stuff and how he couldn‚Äôt lead the locker room, Randle wasn‚Äôt re-signed because we replaced him with Lebron James. Lonzo hasn‚Äôt seen a massive jump, he‚Äôs a more comfortable shooter but I think that was coming with time as he seemed to really get shook from the spotlight in the beginning. Lakers taught Ingram to run an offense and was putting up the same numbers he was in New Orleans towards the second half of his last season with the Lakers. We know how to pick, how to build a solid foundation, but we cashed out for bigger chips. It wasn‚Äôt like we just sucked and lost players for no reason. These players weren‚Äôt re-worked from the ground up when they left."
Lebron James: BITCH MADE
"bruh, one jumpone away from lebron james part 2 is literally the worst take of all time"
Lebron is Lebron James. James Harden is just.... james harden.
"If any other player in the league not named Lebron James missed 3 out of every 8 games and was the 7 seed, they wouldn't even sniff an All-NBA Team.  Lebron played 45 out of 72 possible games and the Lakers finished as a severely underwhelming 7 seed. **Availability** and **team success** have traditionally been **massively influential factors** in determining All-NBA Teams, and a huge reason why Lebron holds the record for the most All-NBA 1st Teams of all time (which he deserves). But when these factors work against Lebron for the first time in his career, suddenly they went out the window.  All-NBA Teams are used to determine both salaries and legacies. These accolades are not a joke and should not be treated as such."
"You are conflating a major market team like the Lakers having lots of publicity and Lebron James performance on the basketball court.  You gonna say his Finals MVP just 8 months ago was because of ""lakers fans""?  cmon man"
LeBron James E. Cornette
"Might be part of Father Time catching up to him. And part of being the current best is availability.   I think we should be prepared for a lebron james that isn‚Äôt the best player in the league anymore, but still a fantastic player. He will need a prime and heathy AD to be the main force on the team for him to win more rings"
How does one reconcile the ideas that Kevin Durant is now better than Lebron James and that KD shouldn‚Äôt be expected to beat the Bucks by himself but injured Lebron is expected to beat the Suns by himself
Funny how people were accusing James Jones of being a Klutch puppet that was sending LeBron players for pennies on the dollar.
Except LeBron James apparently...
"""6‚Äù10 Lebron James without a jumpshot"" can still give you decent scoring because of the aggressiveness of driving inside, Ben does not do that"
"I mean they literally just won an NBA championship because of their location. What other team could suck ass for 7 years, have a team consisting of Brandon ingram and lonzo ball, and be an attractive destination for lebron James"
I mean give harden lebron fucking james and he wins more rings then that lol
"Simmons was probably not going to be on the team if they had Lebron. He‚Äôs awful fit with James and would have probably been able to fetch a different, yet still valuable asset.   It‚Äôs nonsense to compare what Lebron‚Äôs team would be with the Sixers vs the Lakers this season. If Embiid played as deep into the bubble as AD did, he might have an even worse injury than he already does this season. You can‚Äôt compare things like this. You‚Äôd have to consider what the Sixers would look like if they made the same bubble run. It‚Äôs especially ridiculous to just pencil Embiid in for healthy playoff runs the way you‚Äôre doing here."
"And that's the problem. Do you think his coach care about Ben being a ""6-11 LeBron James"" especially since that's not his game or skill level? I remember when Daryl Morey was in an interview and this was after Ben scored 42 points against Utah. He said that it was great to see Ben score like that but that's not how the Sixers are going to win games. He has a role and he's damn good at it. He's averaging almost 3.8 assists to 1 turnover ratio including 4 to 1 assists to turnover ratio. He has his scoring flaws and he's not going to be the ""next LeBron James"" but Jesus, he's an extremely important player for a contender, a team that since he's played for has been a winning team."
"I didn't know that 1991 Michael Jordan played in 2019, was a free agent before the season started AND met/considered Philly as an option, wow who knew?  The reason i specifically mentioned LeBron James is because this was a possibility, it almost legit happened, but he decided to go for L.A (and was criticized for it at the time)."
Lebron James
"Funny thing is that on the Lakers sub, there‚Äôs people that say they would trade fucking LeBron James for Luka. The opposite of homers"
He‚Äôs a jump shot away from being a one inch taller LeBron James? Lmao üòÇ
"You sure? Maybe Paul Pierce is more like Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Zeus, etc."
"That‚Äôs the kind of dialogue worth having about Tayshaun Prince, not a number 1 draft pick from 5 years ago that was supposed to be the second coming of Lebron James. The dudes motor just isn‚Äôt there with regard to on court offensive aggression/offensive development. Guys like Jaylen Brown, BI, and Mitchell (I know not the same draft class but they‚Äôll forever be compared bc of their ROY race) have continued time and again to add different layers to their game and Simmons has arguably become worse."
"I can do a good SAS impression about this topic if you want more. Here goes, deep breath:  BEN SIMMONS JUST DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE GAME. HE PUTS IN MINIMAL EFFORT WHEN HE HAS ALL THE TOOLS. SHAME ON US THE MEDIA FOR COMPARING HIM TO KING JAMES. THIS FOOL DOESN'T DESERVE TO BE IN THE SAME SENTENCE AS LEBRON. LEBRON. LEBRON. LEBRON. LEBRON.  ***earpiece crackles in, you didn't meet the quota, one more at least*** LEBRON.   Max Kellerman: I completely agree, also he doesn't do enough for the black fans."
LeBron James üëë
"You didn't have to remind me of that bruhüò≠ Fr though, I doubt LeBron regrets going to the Lakers, especially since he won a ring, but honestly he just had a better situation in Philly.      If he signs with us, we win in 2019, then a great chance in 2020 (depending on the offseason moves Philly would've made), this season would be challenging but still much better than whatever the Lakers did this szn.      Just imagine fucking LeBron James playing next to an all-nba/dpoy level PG and an MVP-caliber 2-way center with a solid supporting cast."
"Comparing him to Lebron James is really misguided. We saw what Lebron looks like without a jumpshot, he was still virtually unstoppable. Simmons doesn't have the aggression offensively to be Lebron. He's a completely different player despite the fact that he passes, defends, and rebounds similarly to Lebron. That aggression has never been there with Simmons."
Dumb af.. What are the odds Lebron James forced AD to play?
"First of all, why not? Feel free to be disappointed. Nobody minds.  I have never heard any Sixer fan say those things you mentioned tho. Those mostly came from the media and casual fans. We know what Ben can and cannot bring to the table so our expectations are tame and reasonable. Of course if you expect him to be a 6'10 LeBron James, then you will definitely be disappointed.   The ROY award is based on the players' performance during their rookie season, not on their potential so your point about that is invalid."
"Can we stop saying anything close to LeBron James though? Even when LeBron was considered a poor perimeter shooter, he was always able to score. Ben Simmons doesn‚Äôt score in the half court nor does he dictate offense in anywhere near close the amount LeBron does. He‚Äôs a good player, but this whole LeBron comparison is reallllllly bad. It‚Äôs like when someone can shoot from deep and suddenly everyone compares them to Steph Curry, plz stop."
exactly...Lebron James driving a 2012 F-150 is way more interesting to me than him driving around in a lambo or whatever.
"SMH, just ignoring that we have the GOAT,   Michael ""Jordan, Lebron"" James"
"This is an interesting way of looking at it. I think I would go instead with the actual last 5 by year:  FMVP: James, Leonard, Durant, Durant, James  MVP: Giannis, Giannis, Harden, Westbrook, Curry   The MVP hasn't actually been the same as the Finals MVP since Lebron in 2013."
LeBron James - Kyrie Irving (2017)  Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal - Kobe Bryant (2002)  Hakeem Olajuwon - Clyde Drexler (1995)  Michael Jordan - Scottie Pippen (1992)
"I wouldn't call the Raptors cursed , they don't have nearly enough history but I will say this from the standpoint of Tyronn Lue, I just saw Eric Spoelstra getting his respect last year, the media does a great job shiting on LeBron James head coaches, if Lue can't even get the Clippers to the finals hopefully maybe people can stop the ""LeBron has never had a head coach narrative for good"""
It's that he's not a high level half court player. How long will it fucking be until people figure this out? I dunno where people get this impression that he could be LeBron James if he just tried harder. He can't. He's not remotely close to as skilled of a scorer.
"This is the ""LeBron James Didn't Make It To The Finals, Everyone Must Pay"" Rule."
"perhaps LeBron james can wear a technological appratus on top of his head, like a beanie that is a monitor and display his preferred hairstyle on it"
if your average guy can finish at the rim at a level slightly below than lebron james then yes.    he can‚Äôt shoot for shit and his FT shooting is awful but let‚Äôs not get too carried away with the criticism. there are far more offensively inept players in the league. of course the question of whether he should be a #2 option is valid
"No one mentioned them? Are you blind? That was literally the Lakers‚Äô storyline the entire season. LeBron James missed 2 months with a high ankle sprain and only played 3 regular season games (non-consecutive) before the playoffs. And actually he retweaked it against the Pelicans a week before the series.  And he was clearly hobbling. Literally everybody mentioned LeBron barely driving in Games 1 and 2, supported by the fact that his percentage of shots taken in the paint was drastically lower...  You are the definition of a sore winner, which I didn‚Äôt even know existed until now.  &gt;AD needs to get in shape and take care of his body if he wasn't healthy in games 2 and 3.  Why do you think he injured his groin?"
"Has kd openly say he‚Äôs the best? Sure, if he wins without kyrie and james he might really be the best But losing without them means very little to him  Anyway, have fun with your hate with kd. I am happy as is with lebron losing this year and have no specific player or team to root for"
Remember when people was hyping Simmons to be the next LeBron James
"He played the entire 3rd quarter.....and was shooting 50% in the series from the floor with kyrie Irving in the lineup. No one, even lebron James is winning or staying efficient with Mike James/Bruce brown and 99 million salary on the bench"
"Imagine the ""BLOCKED BY JAMES"" had been called a goaltend, and thanks to that call, the Cavs had never actually won a title during their run with LeBron.  How would you feel 25 years later if the Cavs had never again made it to the Finals once over that timespan?"
Collins should have enrolled in the Lebron James School of Acting
Lebron James will cease to exist
"Top 10 defensive win shares for 2020-21  Spencer Dinwiddie  Henry Ellenson  Mike Conley  Rudy Gobert  LeBron James  Julius Randle  Elijah Bryant  Dante Exum  Ben Simmons  RJ Barrett  This is your voting list for all-defensive teams, correct?"
"It's highly unlikely he will accomplish enough wearing 6 to earn a Laker retirement.  No one has ever had a number retired for their accomplishments at the ages he will be during the next two seasons.  I realize he's LeBron James, but he also hasn't even played a full season since 2018."
They will retire 23 or 6. It‚Äôs LeBron James we‚Äôre talking about. And he brought them home a championship in one of their hardest seasons emotionally.
LeBron James to the nets makes a lot of sense too but it ain‚Äôt gonna happen
"He wore 6 at Cleveland practices, 6 in Miami, and now 6 in LA. 666, Lebron James sold his soul to the devil for basketball skills confirmed..."
"Eh you are asking an awful lot from role players, they don't even have Dinwiddie either. Green, Griffin, Harris, Bowen, James... imo thats not even as good as any of the early Cavs LeBron teams."
"Who‚Äôs better, JJ Barea or Lebron James?   /s"
"‚ÄòPretty close‚Äô ain‚Äôt it though, because he‚Äôs not a consensus top 5 player.   Lebron has more rings, has more finals MVP‚Äôs, has more regular season MVP‚Äôs, has more allstar appearances, has more all defense team appearances, has more all-nba appearances, has more playoff appearances...  There‚Äôs no reason to say Bird is better than James unless you‚Äôre wearing nostalgia tinted glasses."
"Suns prior to the 2018 draft already gave the ""keys"" to Booker as the combo guard who will play similar to Harden... it didnt work after the draft, but point was that Booker was going to be the ""main"" ball handler.  &amp;#x200B;  Bringing in Luka who also NEEDS the ball as main to be effective meant Booker plays off the ball.  &amp;#x200B;  The difference with CP3 and Luka is that CP3 is a proper Point Guard, a play making FLOOR General who can also dominate scoring as second priority. Luka on the other hand is the DO-IT-ALL type Point Forward, like Lebron and Grant Hill before him with elements of James Harden blended in...  A CP3 system vs Luka system is simply different. Booker is also more willing to play off the ball next to CP3 because CP3 is an ALL-TIME great floor general. Top 3 greatest game manager In My Opinion, up there with Magic, Stockton.. probably ahead of Nash and Kidd."
James Jones was coached by Lebron 4 times
1st G - Stephen Curry G - Damian Lillard  F - Luka Doncic F - Giannis  C - Nikola Jokic  2nd G - Chris Paul G - Jimmy Butler F - Kawhi Leonard  F - Julius Randle C - Joel Embiid  3rd G - Kyrie Irving G - Paul George  F - Jayson Tatum  F - Lebron James C - Rudy Gobert
"&gt; Lebron has a no-trade clause  No he doesn't.   https://www.wkyc.com/article/sports/nba/lebron-james/report-los-angeles-lakers-owner-jeannie-buss-being-pushed-to-trade-lebron-james/95-fe547d9b-f274-4890-a25a-ebf057ba9f39  &gt; The contenders don‚Äôt have any assets  Sure they do. The Sixers have their own first rounders for 21, 22, 23, 24, 26 and 27. They have a bunch of 2nd rounders. They have Simmons and Embiid. I'm not going to do this for you for every team.  https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/draft/future_drafts/detailed  &gt; no contender has a motherlode the Lakers want.  This hypothetical scenario has little to do with what the Lakers *want*. If LeBron says he wants out tomorrow, the organization knows he can make the situation really ugly for them. The organization won't just be trying to get back value, they'll be trying to do it as seamlessly as possible to stop it from becoming a fiasco. If teams thought they could just hold out for a pile of picks, the Spurs wouldn't have dealt Kawhi and Danny Green for DeRozan and Poeltl.  If you really want a matching trade, use the Trade Machine. Lots of options out there."
"It‚Äôs because  for little over 10 years, we held Lebron James to absurdly high standards that never existed before him as the ‚Äúbest player in the league‚Äù.   KD is one who allegedly has that title and it‚Äôs time for alllllll those standards that Lebron was held to to fall on KD‚Äôs shoulders. KD fans are confused because they want the clout with none of the scrutiny that comes with it."
Could you imagine a woj bomb that says Tom Brady for lebron james
Within 5-10 years from now or when they were drafted? Because I think even someone like Lebron James would fit the criteria of being out of the league within 5-10 years if you mean from now. Dragan Bender is already out of the league despite people telling me he looked good on other teams.
LeBron James
"That‚Äôs exactly what I hate about coaching comparisons. On the Ty Lue thread the other day people were saying ‚ÄúOf course Lue is a top 5 coach his teams have never finished outside of the top 4 in their conference‚Äù completely ignoring the fact that the only teams hes coached had Lebron fucking James and Kawhi/PG.    I like to grade coaches more off their expectations with their given talent rather than just randomly looking at what the end of season results are while ignoring everything else. Teams like the Nets, Bucks, Lakers, Clippers are going to be a playoff contender no matter who is coaching them because their teams are incredibly talented. Give any coach a roster with a starting lineup of Harrison Barnes, Wes Mathews, Yogi Ferrel, Dennis Smith Jr., and a 40 year old Dirk and see how many games they win lol."
"KD wants to be seen like LeBron so bad, now he gets a chance to enjoy the LeBron James Playoff Experience."
"Kevin Durant, Lebron James.   There‚Äôs 2"
Don't tell this sub that. His suspension broke their team's continuity. Ignore the fully healthy LeBron James and Anthony Davis.
"Some dude that played semi-pro in Germany came to my neighborhood court for pickup.   Dude absolutely dominated all aspects of the game.   Really opened my eyes as he wasn't even good enough to play fully professional anywhere, and just absolutely murdered everyone.   It was like watching LeBron James vs the JV team for the Washington Generals."
"Yeah I'm aware, but that's generally how they call them still. Excessive contact usually means intentionally fouling and/or not going for the ball.   He accidentally grazed his face with his upper arm. His hand got all ball. That's not a flagrant 2.   Can you explain to me how this was a common foul on draymond but jokic gets called for a flagrant 2? The inconsistency is absurd.   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lakers-vs-warriors-lebron-james-follows-up-hard-draymond-green-collision-with-game-winner-to-seal-no-7-seed/"
"Yes, LeBron James literally attempted to paralyze Joel Embiid."
"An interesting tidbit that nobody will see but I feel adds a bit is when James Jones was inducted into the University of Miami Hall of Fame, Pat Riley and Spo showed up for the ceremony. I saw that as a huge sign of respect considering James was merely a role player on a team featuring Lebron, Wade and Bosh. I think Pat could see James was something special even at that time and wanted him as a part of the organization like the Heat did with Alonzo Morning in the past."
Negative? I'm sorry. Those tendons and ligaments are crying out in pain.  Check the MRI. Gonna be a grade 2 or 3 sprain. That's gonna take weeks to fully heal (see lebron james)
"If the owner was willing to pay Harden, things could very well be different.  Who‚Äôs your favorite team‚Äôs Gm?    Are you gonna hold him responsible for losing to Lebron James or the Warriors dynasty every year, having a cheap owner that let one of the best scorers in NBA history go because they didn‚Äôt want to pay him, had KD dip on them for the team that he chocked the lead to, and then had PG request a trade to the Clippers?    All of those things are out of his control and I would say he navigated them very well with their prolonged period of success during the entire last decade.  The Thunder just had 11 straight winning seasons and making the playoffs in 10 out of 11 years, before 2021.  He‚Äôs been great and with SGA and all the picks they have, most people think they are in a good spot to bounce back soon enough.    I swear some of you are so ring oriented it‚Äôs crazy.  There is more to being in the nba than winning a ring.  I guarantee the fans are more happy with long periods of success, rather than rebuilds and tear downs, and horrible tanking losing seasons.    OKC finally has a bad year for the first time since 2009 and you want to jump the GM.  Stop it."
"Well it‚Äôs not exactly an easy question. I‚Äôve never seen KD has ‚Äúthe best player in the world‚Äù at any point in his career, but I think this is about as best of a chance he‚Äôll get to claim the throne.   The last best player in the league would be expected to win this series, but the last best player was Lebron freaking James lol. It‚Äôs not like KD is a top 3 player ever, the same expectations we put on Lebron can‚Äôt be put for KD.  But what would we expect out of other best players? Throw 99 Shaq or 08 Kobe, you expect them to win this series?  Not saying KD has to win the series, he‚Äôs lost all of his help, but he‚Äôs gotta play better. For his own sake too. If he continues this performance, and Bucks take it in 6, I feel like it kinda kills any convo of him being the best. Certainly not a legacy killer, but it does prove the notion that he‚Äôs dependent on the elite help around him."
"I doubt KD will take plays off like [this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/thespun.com/news/lebron-james-not-hustling-pacers-video/amp) on defense, so I'd give him a pass if his scoring efficiency takes a slight hit these next few games."
This got me curious where Chris Paul was rated coming out of highschool.  He was #52 in the Class of 2003.  #1 was Lebron James.  http://www.espn.com/recruiting/s/020703top100.html
‚ÄúReferee Joey Crawford immediately jumped to action and tossed Lebron James out for his behavior.‚Äù
"Teams have gone from lottery to NBA champions to back to lottery by adding or substracting LeBron James. But yeah, CP3 is crazy, deserves all the praise. Can't believe it was agreed consensus 2-3 years ago that he's done and just a negative contract."
"There‚Äôs a reason klay is probably the best role player of all time, but he still is one. What star creates less than 5% of their own shots? What star creates very little shots for his teammates? His role is to run around and shoot 3s, and create spacing for his teammates. He‚Äôs one of the best players of all time at this role, but it‚Äôs a very specific role that you would never give to a star. Who‚Äôs role is more similar to klay‚Äôs in the flow of an offense? Jae crowder or lebron? Danny green or James harden? Klay is just a really great version of the 2 former players."
Tell me LeBron James does the EXACT same thing and gets ejected on an ELIMINATION game in LOS ANGELES. Unbelievable.
"In no particular order over Malone I at least have: Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Kareem, Tim Duncan, Shaq, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Bill Russel, Wilt Chamberlain, Stephen Curry, Hakeem, Kobe, Kevin Durant, Oscar Robinson, David Robinson and Jerry West. So I don't feel he is a lock for top 15."
"&gt;Agree to disagree.  My understanding is we got Lebron and management realized we had a championship window.  They saw the young core play for a few years and decided that wasn‚Äôt their best chance to win a chip, AD was.  I agree that is what happened.  &gt;There may or may not have been some other move to make, but Butler doesn‚Äôt compliment Lebron nearly as well as AD does.   Arguably true, but Butler would've cost 1/10th as much to acquire, so really, who cares?  And James can seemingly play with anyone.  &gt;Some people will see it as a bad move I guess, but you‚Äôre in the minority.  I obviously am in the minority, but that doesn't mean I'm wrong.  &gt;If we win again this year, are you going to admit it was a good move? Or will you still be on the ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt paid off yet‚Äù tip?   First off, whatever the Lakers win in this and subsequent years is really irrelevant.  Davis was a UFA this past December, and could've signed with anyone, Los Angeles included.  There was absolutely no need to spend a decade of assets to acquire him unless you believed the window was just 1 year -- in which case, again, that was way too much to spend for one title.  That said, I would not consider two rings ""paid off"", no.  As I said, historically, the Lakers win 2.3 titles every 10 years.  And they traded an entire decade of assets for Davis.  Two titles would be getting close, but if it winds up being a title last year and this year, followed by 10 years of bad teams, I am calling that no better than a mediocre trade.  There are many variables.  Maybe De'Andre Hunter never makes it back from his leg injury.  Maybe Lonzo Ball never gets any better.  Maybe those 3 first-round picks all wind up being late-twenties picks in shallow drafts.  Those are all possibilities.  On the other hand, Ingram is already an All-star, and putting up better numbers this year than Davis is.  And Ball is still younger than, say, Larry Bird was as a rookie -- not that they compare as players.  And Hunter was posting 17 ppg for Atlanta, and hasn't played a full season yet.  If all three of those guys wind up All-stars, and a couple of the first-round picks are very good players, then that trade looks really quite bad.  &gt;Personally I‚Äôm ecstatic that I get to watch Lebron and AD for years to come, calf strain and all.   Hopefully Davis winds up playing more, and not an expensive disabled-player-exception."
"Why would Dolan overpay guys who suck? LeBron James agent calls him, ""Hey, LeBron wants a $100 million contract.""  Do you really think Dolan would reply, ""Sorry, I'd rather spend $100 million on Fred VanVleet.""  Management with a salary cap requires brains and creativity. If you could throw as much money at players as you want, you can be a monkey and win."
"So assuming first and second in the West are some combo of LAC and UTAH then no player on those teams will win. Then I'm assuming all the players are playing at the rate they are now, more or less.   -Jokic will not win from the fifth seed. Whether he should or not isn't what's being asked. He won't be considered a serious contender.   -Nets players won't be considered either. James Harden and KD and Kyrie, there's just too much talent there to give one of them the award for doing what most people expect them too.   -Giannis will not win the award. Again, maybe he should? But the voters won't consider it giving him the award for his dominance season. They will consider it giving him MVP three years in a row. That's not happening under any but the most extreme circumstances. And even then it's not very likely.   It's between LeBron and Embiid imo. Both the three seed. Embiid dominating in stats but LeBron has the narrative and support of the voters. If the Sixers were second seed it would be easily Embiid but that's not the question posed. I honestly think they'd give it to LeBron since everyone has something against them. He will also probably play more games than Embiid and that will be used against Joel. The only way Embiid wins is if he finishes with 30+ ppg, the first center doing so since Moses Malone."
"Not everyone who gets maxed is Lebron James. The comp for Mikal is Otto Porter, Draymond, Gobert. In a league starved for wing play, he‚Äôs getting maxed if he keeps this up"
"I literally have no idea what constitutes a foul in the NBA anymore. If a player doesn't move out of the way when a person shoots and they land on his foot it's a foul. If James Harden grabs your arm as he goes by and then throws a up a shot, you get the foul. But on the other hand we see straight up muggings go uncalled every game. The NBA had peak viewership in the 90s and the 90s was a very physical style of basketball. It was expect that you would have to touch people in a game where you shove 10 people inside a 25 foot semi circle. Look at the Jordan Rules and how the Pistons played Jordan. Isiah Thomas is quoted as saying ""we don't know how he got out of [playing the Pistons] alive"". It was a very street game. If Lebron was defended like that he would start a social media campaign denouncing the NBA as racist for jot protecting Black players from violence. Jordan took it personally and won 6 chips and is still the biggest brand in basketball because of it."
"As someone who is actually a very big Russ fan and think his only real problem is turnovers , Doncic is already a better player than Brodie .   Doncic is 100 percent a team player , at times to a fault . Doncic could stand to be a little more Westbrook in some games even . But let‚Äôs be honest the guys around him are okay at best . Klieber is inconsistent as all hell this year . Dorian Finny-Smith has been more or less a bust this year . Kristaps isn‚Äôt able to play the Defense at the 5 that you want in the west . Jokic , Gobert , Nurk , even old man Lamarcus pushes KP in the paint.   This team is dead last without Luka and just looking at the guys around him shooting stats , eff % , and + / - would tell ya that.  Luka is special to be cooking the way he is at his age . But let‚Äôs not forget LeBron James wasnt exactly dragging the Cavs to finals every year in his early 20s either and we all know how that turned out."
25 years from now: LeBron James and LeBronny James
"It's been this way all season. The MVP odds don't favor who is having the best season, they literally favor who the odds-makers think will win the award. There has been a *massive* push for LeBron to win the MVP the entire year. Both Jokic and Embiid's counting and advance numbers have dwarfed LeBron's the entire season. Embiid was considered a distant second while the Lakers were the two seed and the Sixers were the one. (yes I know which conferences they play in). Tbf the Lakers did and still do have the better record but not by much.   To that end, Jokic's team has hovered in the 6-8 seed range and thus he was never seen in competition with LeBron for the award. It's clear that Jokic/Embiid would have to massively outplay LeBron, while finishing top two in the conference, while LeBron *doesn't* finish top two as well. He just has an inherent advantage because he is starting from a place where the voters openly want to give him the award.   Your issue should be with the voters considering things outside of this season, like past playoff performances or how old James is, that Embiid and Jokic can't control and not with the odds-makers accurately acknowledging the voters preference."
"The best ones have a great grasp on x and os in both leagues.  LeBron James and Chris Paul know the game inside and out too.  When you see a next level player, they are almost always smarter than their opponent along with athletically gifted.  Yes, there are exceptions, but guys like Harden and Curry break the game because they know how to.  Put chris Paul's brain in kyrie and you have the greatest pg of all time."

"Depending when he chooses to end his career I could see him having a Kobe-esque final game. Just take as many shots as you can so you give the fans something to remember.  However, the only problem with my own theory is that it would mean that a regular season game is the last game of Bron‚Äôs career, and I can‚Äôt even imagine that a team he‚Äôs on at that stage isn‚Äôt a contender with a meaningless last game for Bron. I don‚Äôt see him playing on a shit team to end his career, and if it got to that point I feel like he‚Äôd rather retire than play for a garbage ass team.  Who knows though, maybe Bronny gets drafted to Minnesota, so Big Bron decides to play a season for MN for the chance to play with his son? Even knowing that ‚Äò09-‚Äò10 LeBron has no chance to take that inept franchise to the playoffs, much less ‚Äò23-‚Äò24 Bron, but if he somehow did lead MN to the playoffs at 39 years it would almost be akin to Tom Brady winning the SB in Tampa Bay.  Taking a garbage ass franchise to glory at an age where you should be a ‚Äúwashed king‚Äù according to your age would just further cement his already cemented legacy. I mean, shit, even just taking MN to the playoffs one single time is probably a tougher challenge than winning a ring with the Lakers, even if you get swept in the first round.   But that‚Äôs the only scenario in which I think he could pass his career high. Still a great player, inexplicably goes to a trash island of a franchise, and becomes that franchise‚Äôs GOAT in one season there just because he‚Äôs LeBron Fucking James.   And yeah, I know KG played for MN, and he was great for them (albeit very overrated in my mind, but his prime was top notch, or one notch below that) but even so, one season of 39 year old Bron instantly becomes the most important player for your team, even though you had an all-star player for a decade.  It‚Äôs similar to Brett Favre (Analogy Bron) going to the Vikings at his old age. Sure, Kirk Cousins (KG in this analogy) has been an above average QB for them, but one or two seasons with a grey bearded goat and they got closer to winning than they ever before."
"Looks like he says ""oh jesus christ"" to the bad foul call, then says ""how is that a foul?""  Refs tee him up.  He throws a bounce pass a little too hard to the ref and they throw him out.    AKA, a small market team is beating the Los Angeles Lebron James.  The NBA isn't fair, it's a money making entertainment business and you ain't in the club."
"Hard disagree on the first part. Absolutely can get annoying watching players mouthing off after every play, especially when they're choosing to do so over getting back on the other end of the floor.   Not only does it get annoying to watch, but it's ridiculous to say that shit has no direct effect on a game. Veterans like Lebron James, Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, etc don't do it every single game for fun. They do it because they know the more they do the more they can influence the whistle to go their way."
Referees did everything they could. Really hate the fact that every time Ayton challenged James the referees had pre-determined whistles... however Lebron wrestles Ayton or Saric.. and its play on
"&gt;Kawhi 3% higher true shooting percentage and a higher player efficiency rating.  LeBron's higher rebounding &amp; assists make up the difference and then some. LeBron's playmaking is also so much better &amp; more valuable than the total assist numbers indicate compared to Kawhi that it's not even close. That's why him and guys like James Harden are the best floor raisers in the league.  Also, PER is a useless stat with no validity to it whatsoever, so mentioning it is a non sequitur.  &gt;Lebron also has 3% higher usage rate and plays more minutes which also factors into why blindly looking at counting stats is not helpful.  LeBron has to play more minutes to carry his injured team (missing 3 top players and then 1 getting injured midgame). His playmaking alone is insanely valuable  LeBron's also arguably playing better defense than Kawhi this year, as crazy as it would sound to say if the year were 2016. 1st in Defensive Win Shares and Net Rating, really high opposing FG%, leading the #1 defense in the league (by far) on a team without their DPOY candidate.  There's a reason LeBron is ahead of Kawhi."
Heck Chris Paul LeBron James Kobe when he was alive definitely had people who wanted to hit him Cousins  Shit ton of dudes people want to hit more Heck cousins or lebron would probably be the main ones  As lebron probably has the biggest hater group And cousins just isn't a good person
"Ayton was fantastic tonight, but that bench was rolling.   And Dario was initiating damn near everything. In a way it was like watching LeBron James, but a version of him that had every single ounce of athleticism exorcised from his body."
"LeBron ""despite the loss"" James"

‚ÄúI wear my Canada goose jacket every day in LA.‚Äù -LeBron James
"Some may wonder why Lebron James is ahead of Jokic in the MVP race when he is statistically better in every single way, but I'm here to tell you all about the primary statistic that shows Jokic and Embiid just can't keep up: Yellow Jersey Percentage (YJ%). This stat measures how many games a player has been on the lakers for. Lebron has 100% and both of the centers are at 0% and really shouldn't be counted."
"Isaiah Thomas 5'8  Stephen Curry 6'3  Michael Jordan 6'6  LeBron James 6'8  Bill Russell 6'10  #31 feet, 11 inches"
Is that even a foul on Lebron? This camera angle seems like minimal contact but obviously the ref can‚Äôt see that standing on the sideline likely blocked by James body.
My frontrunner is Lebron James.

"I am getting kind of sick of these threads about how good the Lakers are and we need to respect them, blah blah blah...  The Lakers are hoes. On them we shall stunt.  2 points:  The Lakers beat the jazz in Utah. A Utah team that was slumping, limped into the playoffs, and lost to a legit bottom 3 team in the league (The Nuggets, also hoes) at home, in a game that could have won them a potential bye.  Yes Lebron James is a good, bruising style Point guard. I ask you what good is a game manager PG when you are down 30 points?? Lebron will be forced to play against a backcourt that has 2 ALL STAR GUARDS.  We are going to destroy the Lakers. Our offensive is a fucking buzzsaw. Our defense is stacked and hungry. Booker is playing better than Jesus right now.  Get it together homies, BIG TRUSS."
"He‚Äôs had no issues with Vogel. No issues with Lue. He didn‚Äôt even throw Luke Walton, who we now know is not a good head coach, under the bus when he could have. What issues of coachability on the Heat are you referring to? Wanting Pat Riley, arguably one of the greatest coaches in NBA History, to replace an unproven guy who was hired to coach a bad team? Him not posting up Barea in the finals following a regular season where they won 58 games? And yea I‚Äôm going after Blatt‚Äôs record. Every other coach Lebron has had since his first stint in Cleveland is objectively a better coach than Blatt, even Luke Walton. Blatt just was fired by a euro team and has been out of coaching for 2 years. Lue is the coach of the team with the 3rd best record in the West, Spo went to a championship, Walton got a second chance, and where is David Blatt? David Blatt wanted to run a motion offense with Lebron James. Even a basketball novice could tell you that if you have Lebron James you don‚Äôt need to run Princeton backcuts. Gtfoh with this David Blatt revisionism. At this point in his career, it‚Äôs pretty evident that Lebron would be completely fine without a head coach and he still works well with Frank Vogel. You just sound like a hater."
"He had a 3 year stretch where he was basically all NBA. He was the prototype of how we think about the modern NBA guard.  As for Comp? On BS Book of basketball 2.0, they did the 2001 redraft and basically came away with Gilbert was James Harden before Harden. Shot with major range before it was mainstream and averaged damn near 30 when scores were 94-85.  Today, a Hybrid of Dame and Harden is probably what reminds me of prime Gil, just the ability to get to the rim, with range where you needed to guard him 30+ ft beyond the basket.  I also still have an irrational hate of Gerald Wallace because he's the one that fell into Gils knee, 8 games before the playoffs and we had home court in the first rd atleast, then we lost Caron and fell all the way to 7, then got pity swept by LeBron in the 1st rd. We had the best record at all star break and Eddie Jordan was the ASG East coach too. Ugh."
"He‚Äôs number 4 in the NBA‚Äôs DPOY race and this is their explanation  &gt;‚ÄùThe Lakers still boast the league‚Äôs top defensive rating (105.1), with Anthony Davis sidelined since Valentine‚Äôs Day, and rank in the Top 5 in blocks, defensive rebounds, opponents‚Äô field-goal percentage, opponents‚Äô free throw attempts and opponents‚Äô effective field-goal percentage. James leads the NBA in defensive win shares (0.178) and ranks fourth in defensive rating (102.6), with a 9.2 net rating‚Äù  I also remember him holding his opponents to a ridiculously low field goal percentage but I forgot how to get that statistic. Obviously I‚Äòve got some bias but LeBron has actually been really good this year."
‚ÄúI thought I was famous until I got to China with Kobe‚Äù - LeBron James
Depends enormously on the year.  Bird in his early twenties is wildly different from thirtysomething Bird.  Let's just say that he did not have LeBron James' relationship with Father Time.  Bird's back injuries took a toll.
"&gt;Had you watched the Lakers pre Lebron?  For about forty years, yes.  &gt;We went from utter garbage, to not making playoffs even with Lebron to winning it all.   And in James' first season with the Lakers, how many players were injured, and for how long?  Since I just posted it elsewhere, I'll tell you...  James missed 27 games and was hurt when he did play. Ingram missed 30. Ball missed 35. Rondo missed 36. Hart missed 15. Kuzma missed 12. They traded Zubac, Beasley, and Mykhailiuk at the deadline.  The only two players who played &gt;70 games were Caldwell-Pope and Javale McGee. They had sixteen guys play over 350 minutes, and eight of them were 23 or younger with six being rookies or sophomores. For reference, the 2020 Lakers played under-23-year-olds a total of 114 minutes (!!) and 81 of those were Horton-Tucker.  &gt;  I feel like you are trolling.   And I feel like you are woefully informed.  &gt; Disastrous for the Lakers lol.   Davis has played 106 games, and now has a chronic injury.  No one knows how his future will go from here.  If you are older than sixteen years, you should remember the last time the Lakers had a franchise big man's career end far too soon, due to injury and attitude.  It was only nine years ago that Andrew Bynum's career was effectively ended by chronic leg injuries, and there's nothing at all stopping that from happening again. Even before this injury, Davis only averaged 66 games per season -- he's no A.C. Green.  If Davis remains limited by his injuries for the remainder of his Lakers' contract -- a very real possibility -- and the seven players the Lakers traded for him ( plus Zubac who they gave away to make room ) continue to develop apace, and those 3 first-round picks that have yet to even be executed pan out, this trade will go down in history as one of the worst.  And if James stops playing like a 25 year-old, which will happen eventually, and Davis is only occasionally able to play, those 3 first-round picks might be quite good.  The bottom line is that trading a decade of assets for one season of one player was a massive and unnecessary risk, and may well bite the Lakers in the ass."

I'm not even sure what you're arguing at this point. LeBron James is a mutant athlete built in a laboratory. Do we take away his accomplishments too because of that? Do stats only count if you're a dumpy stone foot player like Larry Bird or Jokic?
"I watched all lakers games this season and if Lebron James won an all defensive award. I would call bs. He is one of the worst off ball defenders in the league and not an exceptional on ball defender really.   He gives up open three point shots because he doesn't like to rotate and run to contest. If any other do this, they would be fucking clowned.   Lakers success on defense is more of a team effort and Vogel.   They got jamal murray on this shit. Shows to you how inconsistent this list is.   I know Im getting downvoted by lebron stans lol"
"Lebron James has 200 more minutes then anyone on the Lakers, a team that is running away as the best defensive team in the league. The gap between 1 and 2 is equivalent to the game between 2 and 14"
What exactly do you get from jumping to white knight for LeBron James lmao
"\- Dallas was straight up better than Portland.   \- Teams are rarely the same after three consecutive Finals appearances. The Pistons got crushed by the Bulls in 1991, the Lakers lost to the Spurs in 2003, the Heat got killed by San Antonio in 2014, and the Lakers got demolished by the Mavericks in 2011.   \- OKC was a young and inexperienced team. They were also just not as good as the Mavericks. Neither of Durant or Westbrook were in their primes and James Harden was a role player that year.   \- Miami had zero depth. Like none. That team was good because of its Big 3 and with LeBron choking as hard as he did, victory was not some insane feat for Dallas."
"For every Lebron James, there‚Äôs someone who thinks it‚Äôs pretentious to order lettuce."

"Black: One day I was sitting in my office at the Forum, and Jerry just pops his head into my office and says, ""Hey, come on, let's go, we got a workout, you gotta see this kid!"" In the summers the court inside the Forum would not be down because there would be concerts, hockey, the rodeo or whatever. So we worked out guys at Inglewood High and the Inglewood YMCA -- they were both like a minute car ride from the Forum. To me it was just Jerry being social, wanting to include other people in something he was excited about. I knew the names being bandied about that we were looking at, and Kobe wasn't one of them. It was just a chance to get out of the office.  Ryan West, son of Jerry West, Lakers front office, 2009-2019: The Inglewood YMCA was not the nicest gym in the world. It was probably 30 years out of date. It was small, not a full-sized court even, and it had a real homey feel to it. I've read a lot about the workouts and there has been a lot of misinformation about it. As time has gone by people have gotten the details mixed up about the order and the location of the workouts. But I'm blessed with a great memory and I drove him to the workouts and I remember it like it was yesterday. The first place where the story gets misconstrued is with Michael Cooper. He was the first workout. The other error is about Inglewood High. I specifically remember walking through the door with Kobe that day at the Inglewood YMCA.  Kupchak: Today you walk into a workout and there's trainers, strength and conditioning coaches, sports scientists, measurements, charting, all kinds of stuff. Back then, it was all pretty informal. I'm not even sure we had someone there to rebound the ball for him.  Ryan West: At the beginning they were running him through drills, and Kobe would just go to the rim and dunk every ball. My dad stopped the workout and said, ""Kobe, we know you can dunk. Let's see what else you can do."" He wanted to see him do other things rather than just tear the rim down every time. My dad wanted to see players put in situations they would find themselves in during NBA games. That's when you saw the pull-up game, the jump hooks, the floaters. Kobe had every shot in his repertoire. The Lakers had the recently retired Michael Cooper, who had been named DPOY in 1987, guard Kobe during his pre-draft workout. After just 20 minutes, Jerry West had seen enough. ""This kid is better than anybody we have on our team."" John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images  Black: Michael Cooper was 40 at the time, and he had been retired a few years but he was still a freak. Still wiry. Still in great shape. Cooper at 40 was like a normal person at 25. Larry Bird is on record saying Cooper was the most difficult guy he ever played against in his career, the toughest guy to ever defend him. And there's Jerry saying to him, ""Don't take it easy on this kid. Make him work as hard as you can.""  Michael Cooper, Lakers guard, 1978-1990: I thought I was going to go out there and whip his ass, to tell you the truth. That was my thought. I was like, OK, look, I don't give a f--- how old I am, I'm not gonna let some f---ing guy do anything.  And boy was I brought back to reality quick. In a hurry I found out that 40 and 17 don't go together on the court. At the very beginning, I got right in there and got my hands right up in his face. Guys hate that, especially young guys. He just rose up over my hand like I wasn't even there. I was planning on him not being that strong and that he'd be intimidated. This is an unfair comparison to this young man because I really like him, this LaMelo Ball kid in Charlotte, 19 years old he comes out to the NBA and you see his little, frail body -- Kobe didn't have that frail body at that age.  Carbone: The knock on Kobe in high school was even if he had the skills he was too skinny. I met him the summer of 1995, and Kobe trained that whole year and put on 10-15 pounds of muscle. His first visit to the Nets, the GM at the time, Willis Reed -- his hands are huge -- well he grabs Kobe around the upper arm and he's shaking him and he says, ""OK, you ain't so skinny.""  Black: Kobe never backed down from anyone, even at age 17. Kobe did not know how to be deferential. Michael was playing his best and Kobe just had his way with him. Kobe was just destroying him.  Raymond Ridder, current senior VP of communications, Golden State Warriors, Lakers PR staff, 1990-1998: I just saw Michael Jordan out there. Kobe had all the Jordan mannerisms: the fadeaway jumper, dribbling between his legs, tongue hanging out -- he had perfected every Jordan move at the age of 17.      ""I thought I was going to go out there and whip his ass, to tell you the truth. That was my thought. I was like, OK, look, I don't give a f--- how old I am, I'm not gonna let some f---ing guy do anything.""     Former Lakers guard and DPOY Michael Cooper, who guarded the 17-year-old Kobe  Cooper: There were certain things Jerry wanted to see. The big one was: Could he get to a spot? Great players can always get to their spot. Spots, and the angles you take to get there, are so important in basketball. You might not always hit the shot, but if you can get there, that's when you feel like you'll hit 8 out of 10, or 9 out of 10. Jerry requested that he get to an exact spot, say, at the elbow, every time. Not a foot away, not two feet away, not an inch away. Even the very best offensive players cannot get to that spot by just going from Point A to Point B. Sometimes you're gonna have to take me to A to C to F and then come back to B. So that was the first thing I admired about Kobe. I had done this, taken this away against Larry Bird, Dr. J, and a young Michael Jordan, and here's a young man fresh out of high school and I'm trying to deny him certain places on the court, and Kobe was able to get to his spot, I'd say, nine times out of 10.  Ryan West: They had him doing a particular play off a pick and roll where Kobe was the ball handler and he threw me a great pass, and I went up for the layup and completely bricked the layup. I was so embarrassed.  Cooper: One time Kobe comes off the screen and he got me pretty low so I ended up going under the screen. Now, a decent offensive player in the NBA would think, OK the defense is under the screen -- let me take one dribble past the pick and hit a jump shot. Sure, you could hit that shot, but that's the shot the defense wants to give you. He came off the screen, gave me a little pump fake, which rose me off my feet and gave him some room and then he drove -- one-two, bounce, dribble -- got to the elbow, rose up and hit the shot. Then he went to the left side and did the same thing.  Ridder: He wanted to do everything he could to destroy Michael Cooper. That mentality was something he had from day one, and you saw it in this workout. He had the mamba mentality at 17.  About halfway through the workout, legend has it that things began to heat up, with Kobe and Cooper talking trash and throwing elbows. Kobe was, after all, notorious for ruthlessly humiliating all challengers -- teammates, coaches, friends even -- in games of one-on-one. But the truth is Kobe was so dominant and relentless (at one point he hit 12 shots in a row from the baseline) the workout never even got competitive enough to become contentious.  That week in Los Angeles, Kobe was already shooting his first commercial. Even as a teenager he was a genius at building a brand and spinning his own mythology. Growing up a Lakers fan, he knew exactly who Michael Cooper was and, more importantly, what people around the NBA would say if he strolled into L.A. and destroyed one of the game's greatest defenders. So Kobe never said a word. He knew the workout would speak volumes on its own. In fact, the only chatter heard that day came from former Laker Norm Nixon, who tried to encourage Cooper by yelling, ""Bang on him, Coop! Bang on him!"" from the bleachers. It didn't help. Afterward, Nixon walked up to his old friend and whispered, ""The kid just kicked your ass.""  Cooper: He did kick me in the nuts one time with his leg, and I was mad about that. But that was it. I was banging on him. I was hitting him with my forearm and he was banging me right back. I hit him hard one time, in the kidney and it was a cheap shot, on purpose. It was just that he was backing me down, backing me down and so I hit him. He felt it, you could tell. I said, ""Hey man, sorry about that,"" but Kobe was so focused on the workout he was like, ""No, no, no problem, Coach, let's go."" When he'd hit me with an elbow he would say, ""Oh, oh, I'm sorry,"" and I said, ""Quit treating me like an old man."" But no, Kobe didn't talk. And it was a good thing. Jerry hated that. He always said, why are you fraternizing with the enemy out there? Why are you talking to the enemy when you should be trying to kick their ass? No, Kobe had one thing on his mind: He wanted to play in Los Angeles.  Jerry West: He just had that ""It"" factor. LeBron James, Magic Johnson, people like that, they just have it. Kobe had it. You could see it. You could feel it.  Cooper: When we moved to the low post, Jerry took off the restraints. Kobe didn't have to hit a certain spot or go a specific way anymore. So I didn't know what he was going to do. I was at his mercy. Left-hand hooks. One-bounce turnarounds. And he had that little shake shot, that little MJ shake with his back to the basket and that fall-away shot. And he was able to get up and get his shot off and sink it time after time after time. play 0:47 Kobe's early years: From high school star to the Lakers' gold  Take a look back at how Kobe Bryant went from high school phenom at Lower Merion to a teenage sensation early in his NBA career."
&gt;	Crazy that Harden could realistically have been a 2-4 time MVP if it wasn't for narratives consistently changing against his case lol  Say that to lebron james or stephen Curry as well
"The Cavs were a 33-49 team when LeBron joined them. I‚Äôm not saying KLove and Bron aren‚Äôt significant additions (they were), all I‚Äôm saying is that they joined a team that, without them, was not good.   KD joined a team that had literally just had the best regular season in the history of the league, and beaten KDs team in the WCF.   You can slander Bron all you want I don‚Äôt give a fuck man he killed my raptors for a hundred years lol but don‚Äôt act like him going to Cleveland is REMOTELY in the same conversation as KD going to GSW. The ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù that LeBron is GOAT relies a lot less on those 2 years where he ran into the Warriors death squad in 17-18 than you‚Äôre making it seem. Like if they had lost to GSW without KD, he still would have 4 rings right now and have made 9/10 finals and you know.. he‚Äôd still be LeBron fucking James.  P.S. KD = snek  Edit: also what kind of fan are you that you don‚Äôt consider Steph to be one of the greatest of all time? He is indisputably the best shooter ever and genuinely amazing."
 No. I'm saying that the narrative that LeBron is the GOAT does not hold up if the KD-less Ws beat him consistently. Bc they have a bunch of guys that are not the GOAT and LeBron also had all stars.  So his fans say that the Ws needed KD otherwise LeBron would have 8 rings or something. Which stands to logic. (Ws not good enough) But then they also say that when KD wasn't there that the Ws were stacked with all stars. (Ws really good).  The one thing I dispute that you say is Cavs were trash. You can't say that all a team added were LeBron James and another multiple all star starter and that's not that much. It's a star league and there are 5 guys on the court.
"comparing anyone to lebron james is stupid as hell, esp two young guys"
Even if they were in their primes its still lebron fucking james. This is such an awful comparison
LeBron ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt play defense‚Äù James
Z should be quiet and stay in his place. Leave American politics to Americans Iike LeBron Raymone James.

Lebron James Harden
"I remember LeBron switching onto Curry in many a finals game, bellowing for screen after screen until James was isolated onto the 6'3"" Steph...and y'know...he wasn't destroyed.  &amp;#x200B;  Yes, he had a ton of plus defenders helping him, but Curry wasn't annihilated on the iso. Guy is NOT a scrub on D."
LeBron James Harden wins easily
&gt; The man refers to himself in 3rd person. No Swedish man that claims he is god had to face any adversity like African Americans have in America   Tbf Lebron literally calls himself King James. Zlatan is mostly doing his own schtick.
"His argument is that he played better.  * Lebron James - 26.7 points on 59.4 TS%, 7.5 rebounds, 7.0 assists, 1.6 steals, 0.6 blocks, .244 WS/48 * Derrick Rose - 25.0 points on 55.0 TS%, 4.1 rebounds, 7.1 assists, 1.0 steals, 0.6 blocks, .208 WS/48.  I don't care that Lebron lost the MVP that year and am happy that Rose won it, but Lebron has a clear statistical case over Rose that year."
"You know I really have to say James Dolan, through trial and error, is becoming a better owner and less of a fool.  From watching Phil Jackson Beef with Lebron and Slander Melo andHaving Oakley arrested and calling Oak an alcoholic to Fussing over Game of Zones and staying out of Leon‚Äôs way. At his pace Dolan is gonna be a decent owner in about a decade. He‚Äôs a good NHL owner."
"By this metric no one had any g-damn right beating a 2017 Cavaliers team with LeBron James, Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, and Richard Jefferson"
"Unless Harden picked up some eating tips from Big Daddy Vladdy over the offseason, I think LeBron is still the Heaviest James."
"It's a nuanced situation that will have both winners and losers. Perspective and bias will obviously dominate either side.  What is **not** up for debate is that Lebron was entirely unaware and uninformed on the entire matter, even more so than Morey, and yet he commented strongly on the situation.  It's pretty obvious that Lebron was not speaking about the intricate relationship between the former British colony and China, or the Communist Party of China, or the One Country, Two Systems' style of governance, or even Chinese or Hong Kong sovereignty.  Lebron James was simply commenting for the sake of his personal bottom-line.  Which is grossly hypocritical from his purported stance as a *Champion for the Voiceless*."
"Well the NBA and the media tends to make a lot of exceptions for LeBron James haha, but I think seriously a part of the reason is the fact that they lost in 2011 and he was so bad in that finals to a team that was anything but a super team it kind of tweaked the perception of the Miami Heat, so the Redemption story was definitely there as well as of course the statistics, and 2013 there was really no other choice honestly.  And while KD and Steph were together I don't think they should have won the MVP any of those years, but that's just because I always felt there was somebody more deserving , I agree with you about the double standard"
True. I was making a point about the value of combining very different players.   Could Manute Gin√≥bili be better than LeBron James Harden?
"&gt;Dan Snyder talked about how much a benefit  to his other businesses it was to have Lebron James on the Cavs.  Did Lebron have a stint on the Washington Football team, or do you mean Dan Gilbert?"
"bruh lebron james is just a dude, he‚Äôs not Jesus or Gandhi lol  he‚Äôs directly impacted by racism toward black people and has chosen that as an issue to speak on and attempt to battle. Which is great; all the power to him.   Guy is busier with more shit than 99% of folks on this sub but y‚Äôall expect him to becoming a social activist for racism towards Asian Americans, something he has zero direct experience with in his personal life?  May as well complain that he‚Äôs not speaking out about the fossil fuels or the war in Iraq or the shark-fin soup industry or big pharma etc. lol"
"&gt; The WNBA gets subsidized by the NBA, the owners don't actually lose money.  It's also true that depending on the ownership structure and how the businesses are run, those losses can often offset other income and actually be somewhat of a tax benefit for owners.  There is also ancillary benefits of owning a professional sports team that aren't captured in the revenue model of the team.    Dan Snyder talked about how much of a benefit to his other businesses it was to have Lebron James on the Cavs.  I remember a hockey owner whose team lost money, but he owned and operated the arena and the team paid the arena rent.  So the team lost money and he claimed the losses on his taxes, but the arena was more profitable than the team was a liability.    To say nothing of the fact that it was hard to find a buyer for some NBA teams forty years ago, and now they cost billions.  I think the Heat were purchased for around 60 million in the 90's.  So, in addition to the subsidies you mentioned, the actual financial picture for these owners is complicated."
"I‚Äôm not saying that Lebron NEEDS to come out and stand behind J-Lin, it would be nice but Lebron is not the reason why there is the increase in hate crimes. However the issue (and the reason people are calling on him specifically) is that Lebron has positioned himself as an advocate for all people publicly, yet he is relatively selective about when he put actually puts his voice on stuff and advocate behind.  &gt; &gt; ‚ÄúWhen I first came into the league, it was all about ball. It took me a while to realize the responsibility, the opportunity I was given. You know, ****I speak up for those without a voice, those who grew up like me, poor without hope. Those people, those kids exist all over the globe, and they deserve a chance. No one person is capable of turning the tide, but each of us have an obligation, because somewhere along the way, someone picked us up. And that‚Äôs why we pay it forward.‚Äù -Lebron James, 2019  &gt; ‚ÄúI hope we made [Kaepernick] proud,‚Äù James said, according to a video from The Washington Post‚Äôs Ben Golliver. ‚ÄúI hope we continue to make Kaep proud every single day. I hope I make him proud on how I live my life, not only out on the basketball floor but off the floor. I‚Äôve been one to always speak out about things that I feel like are unjust. If I‚Äôm educated on things, I always go about it that way.‚Äù- Lebron James 2020   [Lebron at the Bloomberg Leadership Summit in 2017](https://youtu.be/BFxMzDW5k3I)  The production of that clip (not say Lebron has any actual involvement in the production that reel) highlighting democratic protest around the world and specifically Venezuela. Speaking the way he did to a room full of world leaders (both in the political and financial sense) really shows how impactful of a person Lebron is and how much his voice (or lack of) actually matters. Nobody cares or expects what KD or Harden feel about an issue like this.  I think many people here would think that his response to the Morey tweet (an issue that uniquely affect Asians and Asian-Americans) is something that was very un-leader like and does not fit well into his own characterization of how he sees himself."

Crediting Pelinka for the championship LeBron James won him is overrating him. Lebron and AD are the reason the Lakers won. All Pelinka had to do was say yes and not fuck things up.
"We could also put the factors from lasts nights game in to play, the mavs had nothing to help him with and they would double him at points due to him being the only threat, you also have Joel embiid to help with that shit so pick and rolls are incredibly difficult.

"1. i really enjoy watching james harden  2. as a whole, the nba is kinda boring right now  3. i can't stand steph curry's shimmy  4. what JR smith did in the finals wasn't even that bad, by getting the offensive rebound he prevented any chance of the warriors winning before overtime, the real screw up was when the refs switch the block to the charge on Lebron  5. the spurs would have beat the warriors if Zaza didn't injure Kawhi"
What rules did they change to make lebron at the top? Y‚Äôall think every website just loves lebron at the top when he hasn‚Äôt even won mvp since 2013 lol.   Maybe they have Embiid and James at the top cause they had the best arguments and one of the top record for most of the season. I mean Embiid is averaging 22 on 26% shooting in the last 3.
"It‚Äôs nba.com they will just change the rules so Lebron can be at the top, it‚Äôs always been like that. They only have Embiid at one because putting James at one would seem completely dumb after dropping 4 straight and going like 5-40 from 3 the last couple of weeks."
"&gt;He had three straight losing seasons with the Lakers, with his final season with Lebron.  After taking over a team that won 17 games the preceding season.  And how many games did James play?  55.  &gt;And it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs in a process era Brett Brown situation where his roster is literally just G-Leaguers, his rosters were never that bad.   Again, Walton's Lakers were one of the youngest teams in NBA history, weighted by minutes played.  There was talent -- and it was almost all college aged, and drafted on potential.  And, as I asked the last misinformed person on this topic.  Exactly how many games do you think ""a good coach"" wins with the 2020 Kings roster?  To refresh your memory, that's full seasons from Barnes, Hield, Bjelica, and Joseph.  13 games from 20-year-old Bagley, 44 from Holmes, 51 from 22-year-old Fox, and 61 from Bogdanovic.  So put a precise number on that.  Are you claiming that's an NBA playoff caliber roster?  It's not.  &gt;5 seasons of being below 500 shows that Walton at this moment is not a good coach.   No, they don't, which is why to-date, Walton has never been fired as a coach."

"I consider a superstar to be someone who is a household name outside of basketball fans. Now a lot of people retort that it shouldn‚Äôt matter whether non basketball fans know who they are but that‚Äôs what makes their stardom super in my opinion.

Even some of the best players in the league like Harden and Kawhi aren‚Äôt that well know outside of sports fans and their city.  So to answer your question no I don‚Äôt consider Zion anywhere near a superstar."

"I've said it before, I'll say it again: this idea that your job somehow disqualifies you from making your opinion known is ridiculous. Just because he's a famous athlete doesn't mean he can't speak on politics.

"LeBron James, 4x MVP and future hall of gamer"
"He's definitely more influential then lebron james. Maybe you're just young, but go back to 2008 when they played the Olympics in China. Look at how the crowd reacted to Kobe opposed to everyone else. Multiple players on that team said they never saw anything like it. Kobe is definitely more popular globally which is a he had the highest selling brand outside the US."
"james harden, lebron"
"I believe at that point, only LeBron James and Anthony Davis will be on the team along with KCP/Kuzma who can easily be moved. Deng‚Äôs $5 million coming off the books helps as well. It would be the same as the potential Kawhi situation, 3 stars and a whole bunch of vet mins."
"&gt;pretty much anyone on that raptors team would have been a top 10 NBA player in Wilt‚Äôs time.  I honestly hate this argument as context matters so much when it comes to comparing eras.  If you gave someone a time machine from 2008 and let them go back to 1950, of course they would be better human beings thanks to the advancements of science, nutrition, and education.  But if you took, say, Lebron James as a baby and raised him in the 1940s to become a basketball star in the 1950s, he'd still be among the best players in the NBA in the 50s, but he would not be the same Lebron James stepping in to a time machine from 2015 and going back to 1955.  Similarly, if Wilt was raised in the 1990s and started playing basketball in the early 2000s, he'd still be one of the greatest centers of all time."
" that doesn't mean Pheonix is a small market just because it's not one of the largest 2 markets.   Also, Lebron James did plenty well with opportunities in Cleveland because the markets aren't actually local, they aren't even national, they are international.   As of 2 years ago, Westbrook had the second most endorsements despite having played exclusively in the smallest market.  My point being that markets don't mean that much in actuality.   So in many ways, the biggest market teams are the teams that play on TV the most. The sun's unquestionably play on TV far more than the league average just by being guarenteed TV time for being in the pacific Division and playing against the Lakers  Clippers, and Warriors more than other divisions."
"What?  I'm assuming you're saying LeBron has been the best player since 2008 where Kobe was arguably the best.  So by that logic Kevin Durant was the 2nd best other than in 2009 where Dwight led the Magic to the Finals.  Hmm.. thinking about it but I don't know man.  I'd argue James Harden could have been #2 in his MVP year and in the year where Giannis first won it.  Also as a Warriors fan, how can you not list Steph as the 2nd best in at least one of those 5 years during that run?  He was better than KD at least once.  Also KD was injured all of last year, so 2nd would by default fall to:  Harden/Giannis/Curry/Kawhi/etc."
"So you‚Äôre just going to assume that next year players will all be healthy and James Harden and Kyrie won‚Äôt miss 20+ games? Maybe Lebron will be healthy, but I‚Äôd definitely count on this being the new norm with players getting faster and stronger."
"That LiAngelo turned out to be the best of the ball brothers.  That Draymond Green would be the head coach of a LeBron James led team.  That Anthony Davis never missed another game due to injury.   That Marvin Bagley ended up being a better player than Luka, Trae and DeAndre Ayton."
"Kinda makes me wonder how an All-Old team would look. Only taking folks from the oldest 20 players in the league, I‚Äôve got:   PG: Chris Paul, Goran Dragic  SG: JJ Redick, Andre Iguadola   SF: LeBron James, Trevor Ariza   PF: Carmelo Anthony, Paul Millsap  C: Dwight Howard, Marc Gasol  Honestly, that‚Äôs not a bad team. I‚Äôd call it a second round exit, maybe conference finals."
To that Lebron James kid that‚Äôs on those televised high school games you‚Äôre seeing
This Lebron James guy you‚Äôre watching in high school will gun for the GOAT title and will STILL be playing this many years later at the highest level through 3 generations of basketball.
You could also put 2011-18 LeBron James.   Pretty insane that he has been to 9 Finals in the past 10 years (before this one) and 10 in the past 14.
"Just an observation, but you‚Äôve got   **2016-2019 Steph Curry**  LeBron James had also played in the finals for 2016-2018 after having previously won championships in 2012 &amp; 2013. Why only name one player from one team when earlier you‚Äôve included Kobe &amp; Shaq together as well as Magic &amp; Bird even earlier?"
"""While you're enjoying the eastern conference finals, let's take a quick look back at the most dominant eastern conference player of fhe last decade, Lebron James"" lmao"
"I would agree if thats for normal people like us  But if we're talking about Bronny, aka son of one LeBron James. Shit don't matter, and LeBron wants to play with his son in the NBA so there is motivation to get his son in the league as quickly as possible whether its via one-and-done or the G-league.  No way is Bronny staying 4 years in college, LeBron is already 36 he ain't got that kind of time."
"Yep no people.

Finals appercences since leaving the Cavs:  LeBron: 1   James Jones: 1   The legend continues
Defund LeBron James
Michael Jordan would retire in 3 years because he would be too scared to play against a rookie LeBron James
"Sorry, I should have specified ‚Äúdrove with intent to score.  &gt; In the Lakers‚Äô first round series loss, the Suns played LeBron to drive, knowing that he lacked the explosiveness to finish upon arrival at the rim. Shockingly, after scoring 0.84 points per possession on isolations in the regular season (36th in the NBA among qualified players with at least two per game), LeBron scored just 0.5 points per isolation in the playoffs, the worst mark in the league.  &gt;Further, despite averaging 14.8 drives per game in the playoffs ‚Äî almost 150% of his healthy regular season average ‚Äî LeBron made just 48.6% of his shots on drives, more than 13 percentage points worse than his healthy average.   &gt;In each of those first three games, LeBron‚Äôs usage never climbed above 30% as he effectively attacked in bursts within the rest of the offense. However, the Lakers seemed to unravel as soon as they lost Anthony Davis in the second half of Game 4, letting their lead slip away to even the series before getting blasted in Games 5 and 6 by a combined margin of 43 points. As LeBron‚Äôs usage climbed near Westbrookian levels in parts of the final three games (all over a 30% usage rate), his efficiency plummeted, unable to shoulder the entire offensive burden by himself.  &gt;Without the gravity of another superstar on the floor, or the burst to explode through multiple defenders, LeBron simply couldn‚Äôt carry the downright anemic Lakers offense on his own. You can see his heavy feet as he turns the corner loosely on drives, and an extremely atypical lack of oomph to power through contact for finishes at the rim on his Game 5 misses in the paint  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.silverscreenandroll.com/platform/amp/2021/6/24/22541574/lebron-james-ankle-injury-lakers-nba-playoffs-analytics-stats-analysis"
"&gt; You had a 36-year-old lebron james average 23/7/8?  Exactly my point...  &gt;You had ""the best offseason acquisitions"" in Dennis Schroder, Marc Gasol, Andre Drummond, and Wesley Matthews?  Drummond was a mid-season acquisition.   &gt;But a GOOD coach and a GOOD leader would rally the troops to step up. Caruso, THT, Schroder, for all the praise they were getting? They were TRASH. And Lebron gave up on his team once his co-star went out.  What praise were Caruso and THT getting? LeBron ‚Äúgave up‚Äù because his ankle gave up."

"Bron absolutely did not look like himself. He looked passive and couldn‚Äôt drive at all. Bridges and Crowder are good defenders but you think they‚Äôre stopping LeBron fucking James? Lowest PPG since 2011, but no he looked absolutely normal, no lingering injuries at all."
"Personally, I think it's someone like Paul George or Klay Thompson. Both are elite shooters that provide great defense and the ability to create their own shots. I think that would be the ideal partner for LeBron James in this era."
‚ÄúRockets are trying to acquire Lebron James‚Äù while being capped out to hell.  I love that he was aggressive tho. He got All Star Dwight and CP3 to Houston.  Wonder who he can bring to Philly to pair with Embiid.
"Yeah because of LeBron James, our franchise is nothing without him"
"LeBron James   Kevin Durant   Stephen Curry   James Harden   Chris Paul   Dwight Howard   Carmelo Anthony   Russell Westbrook   All of them could retire tomorrow and would still be first ballot. You have others who‚Äôd get in but not 1st ballot because of a lack of longevity(Jokic , Giannis, etc)"
"You just contradicted yourself then if now youre saying the raptors were a top 4 team before covid, youre implying they were a good team and not one that wouldve missed the playoffs if cp3 was there. Fvv is the better defender correct but cp3s offense is miles better, hes an actual pg who can finish and run pnr and shoot efficiently from the floor. If two ""pgs"" in fvv and lowry worked, why cant two actual pgs in lowry and cp3 work? Both can play off the ball as well. Theres no reason theh couldnt work, if anything, the facts show both wouldve worked well together. Just because masai is a good executive doesnt imply he doesnt make mistakes and miss out on opportunities. He didnt re sign serge overprioritizing bringing both gasol and serge back and he overpaid for carroll in desperation and had to flip 2 picks to get off the contract. Dont act like hes perfect, lebron james still has turnovers"
"LeBron fucking James (on one leg).  Nuggets were starting Facu Campazzo and Austin Rivers.  Clippers had Playoff P. You get the drill. They didn‚Äôt have Kawhi, Zubac, or Ibaka."
"Notice they didn‚Äôt use Dame‚Äôs jersey in the picture? And they used 3 instead. Know what 3 stands for? The 305. As in MIAMI. Who do we associate with Miami and the number 3‚Ä¶ and a BIG 3? Ice Cube. Guess who his favorite player is? KD, which rhymes with AD, who plays with Durant‚Äôs greatest rival, LeBron James. Dame to Lakers CONFIRMED."
"James Worthy  James Harden  LeBron James  Michael"" Mike"" James  Michael Jordan"
"Lol James Jones got carried by lebron for most of those finals appearances and barely even played, I give him credit as the GM not to much as the player"
Or James Jones was leGM all along and was pulling the strings on Lebron from behind the scenes on all the other Lebron teams‚Ä¶
Thank you!! I swear some ppl don‚Äôt understand this. ‚ÄúIf the Lakers had their full team‚Äù or ‚Äúif kyrie didn‚Äôt get hurt‚Äù this happens every single year yet this year we want to take credit away from teams like the suns because they don‚Äôt have lebron james smh. There‚Äôs no asterisk on any championship team! Yes we all agree injuries suck but that doesn‚Äôt mean the champions are less worthy. A chip is a chip in my opinion give credit where credit is due!
Crazy to think that not everything has to be about the Lakers and Lebron James
"That‚Äôs just not true though. I agree MJ is on his own level, but I‚Äôm not saying Lebron is as a good as MJ. I‚Äôm saying lebron reached ‚Äúbest current player in the world‚Äù status and kept it for long enough, people over the world know ‚ÄúLebron James‚Äù and it‚Äôs a little silly to say otherwise."
"Clips had PG, Nuggets had the MVP, Lakers had LeBron fucking James..."
"Didnt the Cavs hat the worst record and then drafted LeBron James in 2003 and they reached the finals in 2007?  Wouldnt it be only 4 seasons?  Edit: oh i misread the stats they are talking about. its like they created a statistic to make a headline to be ""the biggest in us history""."
You are of your rocker if you think people wouldn‚Äôt have anything against it.  Jerry west winning FMVP in the tightest 7 game series possible with him clearly being the best player was controversial.  Lebron James winning it after losing in 6 and shooting less than 40% from the floor would be laughable.
LeBron James Jones.
"Would they have announced it like they do normally?   Just imagine the entire Warriors team huddled together on stage, and Adam Silver is like ‚Äòthis years finals MVP, LEBRON JAMES!‚Äô   Watch this video where Igudola accepts it: https://youtu.be/gq8KwOxV-0w just imagine Lebron walking up on stage amidst the entire GSW team hahahahahaha"
I'd rather have lebron james
Lebron James literally pushed embiid in the air and y‚Äôall gonna try and take the moral high ground? Lmao
"&gt;He said the tapes were confiscated because videotaping of after-hours pickup games at the camp is not allowed.  &gt;""Nike has been operating basketball camps for the benefit of young athletes for decades and has long-standing policies as to what events are open and closed to media coverage. Unfortunately, for the first time in four years, two journalists did not respect our no videotaping policy at an after-hours pickup game following the LeBron James Skills Academy,"" Nike spokesman Derek Kent said on Wednesday."
"Lebron James two hand shoved Joel Embiid while he was in the air, an extremely dangerous play and much worse than anything Jae Crowder or Pat Bev did this series. He‚Äôs a dirty player. You should be ashamed to support him."
"‚ÄúOn the way to your first finals, how would you compare yourself to Lebron James and the Lakers?‚Äù  *Spo comes bursting out of the crowd, ripping the mic from Rachel‚Äôs hands*  ‚ÄúSTOP DOING THAT!‚Äù"
"Ok now why are we discussing the role players now? I thought this was about AD and LeBron not being 100%? And how exactly do you know what they‚Äôre thinking? Didn‚Äôt LeBron take a photo with Booker after the game? Yeah I‚Äôm sure he was pouting then. Jesus Christ, yeah you definitely build a team around fucking LeBron James and Anthony Davis, it sucks they got injured but you absolutely take a chance with those 2. You didn‚Äôt break shit."
"I literally opened by saying I loathe Patrick Beverley. Come on man, grown ass adults need to be better than that ‚Äúbut he did it firstüò© grade school business.‚Äù  Two wrongs never have and never will make a right. I‚Äôm all for playing physical and even hard fouls going both ways.  That‚Äôs a part of the game that I love and it really only comes out in the playoffs but the flopping and whistle baiting BS needs to be stopped by all the players. It‚Äôs pathetic and I for one can‚Äôt wait till next season when players start getting called for offensive fouls for some of that BS. Again, I am a big CP3 fan. Ever since Steve Nash retired he has taken the throne as my favorite point guard in the league, doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt take issue with a part of his game that pissed me off when I see it out of any hooper. Can‚Äôt stand it when Lebron does it, can‚Äôt stand it when James harden does it, can‚Äôt stand it when anyone does it. For the record I respect and love Chris Paul and Lebron James but just not that part of their game in the past couple years. Harden made it seem like a good idea with how often it has gotten him free points at the line but even the refs/league are starting to realize it‚Äôs bad for the game. It‚Äôs a weak ass way to play the game. These guys are too amazing to resort to that stuff. It‚Äôs part of why so many old heads complain about the game being too soft these days. Pat Bev is one of my most hated players in the league because he regularly does this kind of bitch made shit."
"James Jones &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; James, LeBron"
He‚Äôll always have some lift because he‚Äôs lebron James lol. Doesn‚Äôt mean he was 100%   AD wasn‚Äôt 100 coming into the playoffs either.   It is what it is tho at the end of the day. I don‚Äôt really care to debate it further because you have an obvious bias
"it was instead of trying to trade Tyson Chandler, the Suns just bought him out. ""James Jones did LeBron a solid"""
Yo it blows my fucking mind he got away with that shit. Like he really was playing with lebron fucking james after that and it was like recent lol not even from early 2010 or something
"It wasn‚Äôt to Lebron, but James was crucified early for giving up TJ Warren and not being able to properly manage draft capital (overdrafting Cam when certain teams had called to pick up). Don‚Äôt think any trade benefited Lebron though.. (as far as I can recall)"
"I‚Äôm not sure picking up Lebron James and AD counts as a ‚Äúturnaround‚Äù, especially when their lottery year was literally because of injuries"
"&gt;But we did get that great quote of ""I get it, you want Gregg Popovich, and I want LeBron James""  To me that meant he'd rather ride the cost tails, than lead at all, and Marc is willing to learn and win"
LeBron bout to make a call to James Jones
"The missed free throws was game 2, he put them in the position to have the chance to win in the first place. I dont expect him to pull out a Lebron James this series. But i think played pretty well overall, had a couple of bad games but he definitely did put a good performance out there."
I mean Cousins actually threw an elbow at him. Just because he didn't connect doesn't change it. They wouldn't have called the illegal act if he didn't (dramatically lol) call attention to it.   FOH with bitching about flopping when every three point shooter falls on a hard closeout. LeBron James who is a fucking alien made of adamantium acts like he gets sniped when a hand comes close to his face.   Yeah Paul is at the forefront of it but people acting like he's a one man flopping show are just pissed hes savvy enough to make it work so often
He also made it more recently than LeBron James. Did you knew that?
Right out of the LeBron James playbook.
Yall gotta see skip Bayless twitter the man obsessed at with lebron James skip we get it bruh he not in rhe playoffs lmao let it go
Lebron James says hello
"After Booker took that elbow to the face, LeBron James will be out 4-6 weeks."
Did LeBron James really give Dwight Howard a blowjob at that party in 2010.
"hypothetically if Lebron James retires today, it would take Kawhi Leonard 22 addition years just equal LeBron James total points"
I'm convinced Mark Jackson would take Patrick Beverley over prime LeBron James and Michael Jordan.
Patrick Beverley game 6 vs Suns   LeBron James game 6 vs Celtics  We are all witnesses.
Lebron James&gt;James Harden&gt;Lebron Harden&gt;James James
Lebron James breeds toxicity!   Michael JEFFREY Jordan‚Ä¶would never ^^^^^^^^s
"it is unequivocally LeBron James...   12 Durants would be sick too  among non-all-stars, a team of 12 Gordon Haywards would be pretty awesome as long as 8 of them don't get injured at the same time"
all these guys are fucking roided to the max.  Does anybody care?  I'm not trying to pay $300 for some shit tickets to go see LeBron James sitting on the bench.
LEBRON JAMES WITH THE REJECTION.   Such a perfect call.
"Man that really compares to a Lakers team with no chemistry since they didn‚Äôt have the players to practice together or play games together, a short season for our guys and one extra game so that we couldn‚Äôt watch film on y‚Äôall and plan,  a Lebron James who couldn‚Äôt drive and AD not being able to play on one leg. CP3 just needed to sit out 2 games to be more than 75% fine."
"See, to me endurance, durability and toughness are markers for a champion too.   We also can‚Äôt dismiss roster builds for depth, it‚Äôs the anti putting your eggs in one basket with a couple stars.  It‚Äôs next man up, and also allows you to load manage throughout the season   We are quick to make a big deal about this but KD coming off an Achilles tear didn‚Äôt Have another major injury despite his workload. The heat managed to avoid major injuries.   Sometimes things are just unlucky or built up. Kawhi has degenerative knees. Embiid has pre existing problems. Lebron has a massive load and is getting older. James Harden came to work out of shape. Chris Paul is old. Davis is injury prone. Spida has a big workload but ankle injuries in ball are common. Trae was a freak acccident with a red but also common.  Are we saying the clippers beating the jazz is unspectacular because Donovan‚Äôs foot when kawhi also was out?   The fascination with stars is interesting but insulting to the other players. The booker playing through a smashed nose etc"
"The use of ""Lebron James"" from that kid and that ending makes this something special."
"There's a VERY thin line that Harden crosses, which is why fans don't like him. He hunts fouls looking for fouls.      What you're talking about is being aggressive, knowing the defender can't foul or risk fouling. Harden hunts fouls for the foul alone. Scoring off that foul is secondary to him.      There is a difference, even if that difference isn't reflected in the rules. LeBron James charging the paint knowing his defender and the help defender are high on fouls is not the same thing as jumping into a defender behind the 3 point arc. It is not the same as hooking your defender to try and sell a foul.      Stop trying to equate them because they are equal in the eyes of the law. A man stealing a loaf of bread to feed his starving family is not the same as a man stealing a loaf of bread because he does not want to pay.      They are not equal, Harden does not do what plays have done forever. His lens of attack is entirely different from other players that charge the defense.      What he does comes across as cheese. When players charge the defense, daring them to foul, it comes across as dominant."
"No he's isn't. He's good at dribbling and decent at passing. Those are his only true skills. The rest of his game is built purely on size and athletics, which he doesn't even utilize close to their full potential because his mind is so shot. There are no doubt thousands of middle school kids right now who have more basketball skill then Ben Simmons. They just probably aren't going to grow up to be 6-11 with Lebron James type athleticism.   You think Ben Simmons would he a top 100 player if he was JJ Barrea's size? Simmons basketball success has very little to due with skill."
"Da bess  2009 NBA champions: Los Angeles Lakers* Asterisk reason: Kobe Bryant dodges LeBron James yet again. King James averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds and 8.0 assists for the 66-win Cavs in the Eastern Conference finals, and somehow it wasn‚Äôt enough. Of the 229 individual opponents that Kobe faced at least 20 times in his career, Kobe‚Äôs lowest win percentage came against LeBron, losing 6 of his 22 games against the four-time MVP, per Basketball Reference. Kobe and the Lakers faced Dwight Howard instead. Lakers catch another break."
"Wow, gonna be interested to see what he does now that he actually has Lebron James."
"Lebron James is not injured. He played in every game. How is he injured? if we call people who are not %100 injured than every season has asterisks.   Even last year, heat had a line up of butler, crowder, duncan robinson, tyler herro and that nazi dude (literally can't remember his name) was on the court against the Lakers and LeBron said 'this was the hardest championship ever' and the nba nation didn't even blinked."

Lebron James
Do u think Lebron James‚Äô new movie will be a blockbuster?
Well at least he is going to get LeBron James
"Yeah I honestly feel like this question was partially bait  It's like asking ""Who would you rather have: Kobe Bryant or LeBron James?"" just to get a ""Kobe overrated"" circlejerk going"
"Yeah, should have kept Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, and Josh Hart, and traded Lebron James for AD smh"
"Not at all. In fact, the Lakers should trade that scrub LeBron James for some real winners"
"I‚Äôm so tired of this narrative and correcting it. No, they don‚Äôt hate each other. And they made up. The lack of nuance in discussion these days is exhausting.       Fizdale wanted Marc to shoot more 3s and become more of a modern big man. Gasol didn‚Äôt want to do that, he was much more comfortable playing a post-focused game. Marc had a successful career doing what he knew best and was good at, and adding a new facet to his game was, to him, unnecessary.  At the apex of their disagreements, there was a heated argument in the locker room. Fizdale said ‚Äúyeah yeah I get it. You want Gregg Popovich. Well I want LeBron James. But that‚Äôs not the situation, so we have to work with what we‚Äôve got.‚Äù This is the comment that essentially got Fiz fired.        Well, Gasol got traded to Toronto and helped them win a championship largely by not being afraid to shoot 3s and stretch the floor. It was a huge addition to his game that really helped both him and his team. Fiz and Gasol then made up, with Gasol literally saying ‚ÄúI now understand what he was trying to get me to do‚Äù.       Side note, this move to LAL is because LeBron loves Fizdale and always has. Not to mention Fizdale‚Äôs roots in LA."
"""You know, I've always thought that talent in the NBA is a lot like ordering a meal after a long day at work. You can order the exciting and flashy fajita, they bring it out and it grabs everyone's attention in the restaurant. But.....ehhhhh.... it leaves you wanting more after you're done. It's all flair and no substance. You can load up on a few appetizers, but....ehhhh... again you may find yourself coming up short at the end of the meal. Your best bet is ordering a nice steak dinner, the most reliable option on the menu. Never disappoints. Sure it's pricey, but you get what you pay for. That's how NBA talent is for me, you can have the exciting and flashy Trae Young, or the well rounded but lack luster Knicks. Or you can have the steak dinner, the LeBron James and KD's of the league. The pricey but proven option. (Stares intensely at the camera). I know which one I want. I want the option winners take. The only meal that can satisfy in places like Brooklyn and LA. Fajita's may sell well in places like Milwaukee or Portland, but... (laughs like a robot learning to laugh)...you won't see anyone ordering a fajita on a Friday night in LA. They want the best. They demand the best."""
"LeBron has so many supporters out here man. Guys literally wake up thinking, I'm gonna protect Lebron James on the internet today."
"Wtf, youre saying this guy could be prime curry? He's that good? Then what's cades ceiling?? LeBron James?"
"I am almost totally on board with this. Magic was the best player I ever saw ‚Ä¶ until LeBron James. Nobody ever wants to say an active player is the GOAT, but James is the the best I‚Äôve ever seen. He won two games in the NBA finals (2015) with bus drivers and car salesmen on the floor with him.  All that said, based on the grainy footage, stats, and what his opponents said about what it was like to play against him , Wilt Chamberlain is the GOAT."
"Because I'm not 13 and I have watched PG's entire career. Five years from now i have no doubt in my mind Luka will be the better player, but he objectively fucking isn't today.when Paul George was Luka's age he was a PROBLEM for Lebron James. Luka is close that level but not fucking there yet. He isn't top ten yet, nephews here need to give it a rest."
"That's a weird way to spell ""LeBron James"""
"Midrange never died because of dudes like Lebron, Kawhi and KD still using it in the 2016-2020 range.  But it definitely had a moment where a lot of players ignored it. It's such a travesty that someone as skilled as James Harden basically took 0 midrange shots over the course of 4 years. Maybe that was just a Rockets/Dan Tony thing and not the NBA at large tho."
He's lookin like Lebron James out here
"I wouldn‚Äôt say Kawhi was meh in the beginning... He won finals MVP in year 3 and in doing so made Lebron James scared. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=I_Ia2InBHDY&amp;t=60s  Think about that. Here is a third year player who is making the guy who is the face of the league look over his shoulder and start cursing.  Huerter is a good player, but he‚Äôs not exactly putting the fear of god into the likes of Lebron, Durant etc. when he comes in.    I see him ultimately being like Joe Harris, a role player who will shoot some 3s... a poor man‚Äôs Klay. If you look at Joe Harris and him they have very similar numbers.  Klay has never shot below .400 for 3pt in his season average ever... not 1 season.  Heurter best 3pt is .385 his rookie year.  He‚Äôs a good player but this is probably all you will see out of him, who knows he might be able to improve his game, but more than likely this is what his role is and it‚Äôs not going to expand much."
"&gt; The window is closing on KD, Steph, Lebron, Paul George, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Damian Lillard. The rise of guys like Ayton, Embiid, Jokic, Young, Doncic, etc will eventually catch up.  Time do be like that."
"What do you mean? Even if he went to the top of the key, Robinson would still sag off or full on rush to James and force the ball out of his hands, resulting in a rotation to green or morris for them to shoot the shots. Lebron had just scored the previous several plays via bully ball in the paint, there was no way we were going to let him do that again or even take the last shot."
"Breen: ‚Äúand there‚Äôs his good friend Lebron James watching here tonight. Must‚Äôve flown in straight from the premiere, you always have to wonder what could‚Äôve been this year if not for that crippling injury to Anthony Davis, but he here anyway to show his support‚Äù"
Is that box office king LeBron James?!
LeBron James the actor? Wow!
Marvin Bagley finds his niche as a role player on a good team.  Jalen Suggs makes an all-star team.  Kenny Smith takes a GM job and fails at it.  Knicks make the Eastern Conference finals  OKC doesn‚Äôt get much out of their picks.  A major PED scandal in another sport occurs and some NBA stars are implicated.  Chris Paul retires and becomes the lead analyst on ESPN.  The debate is still occurring on who will be the next LeBron.  Nuggets win a championship  A superstar not named Kawhi or Kylie retires before the age of 32.  Kings still haven‚Äôt made the playoffs  Orlando rebuilds into a solid team.  Draymond and Kerr both retire at the same time and join the TNT studio show.  Cam Payne makes the finals again on a different team.  Luka hasn‚Äôt made the finals  Heat don‚Äôt get past the 2nd round  James Harden starts having AD like continuous nagging injuries.  Grizzlies make a playoff run.  Two teams tie for the 10 seed and the clearly better team loses out on the tiebreaker.  LeBron embraces the gray beard.  A streaker runs onto the court in next years NBA finals and KD body slams him injuring him. ESPN debates whether KD was too violent.

LeBron James ruined this man. And anyone that disagrees can gladly fight me. LeBron fought to have him on his team and then bullied him to no end when he was a Cavalier. So much so that he now suffers from depression. It‚Äôs just so sad what he could‚Äôve became if he was ever tainted by LeBron.
"Ya I think this is the point a lot of people are missing. At 150mil+ I can't think of another kids movie that has been this bad in a while, except for sonic I guess but Jim Carrey is a ever so slightly better actor than Lebron James making the movie not terrible to sit through"

"Because it's prohibitively expensive to start a whole new league with minimal capital. Why the fuck would they undergo that burden?  And yet, what's more difficult, building a new stadium or finding the next Lebron James?   Also it's hilarious you use ""kindergarden socialism"" to talk about a league that is literally the closest thing to communist we have in this country. Five teams make nearly the entire bulk of the revenue and it's forcibly split to the rest of the franchises, who are forcibly made to pay a minimum to its workers."
I was stoked that it‚Äôs on HBO max. Not something I‚Äôd see in a theater but it‚Äôs probably fun and it‚Äôll be fun to make fun of LeBron James at home after i had a few gummies.
Do you really think billionaire LeBron James is worried about watching his mouth in hopes of an Almond Joy endorsement?
"""If LeBron James was really a loyal player, he wouldn't take these short term deals. It signals to other players that he isn't fully committed so why should the organization go for broke trying to get him help?""  Always view contracts in the light of the fact that the orgs want to pit players against fans.   They want the maximum benefit with none of the risk. Players for a very long time tried to make the team that they played for bigger than what it was until it was just so stupidly obvious that the teams do. not. care.   Maybe a coach does, or a single Front Office guy does, but collectively their interests are winning titles as cheap as possible as long as possible.   Players want to win titles, and they want generational wealth for them and their family. They also want to be compensated based on what they contribute.   Dame has made the Blazers a shit ton of money just by being Dame not even the post-season runs. Of course he wants their money. He deserves it."

"All Defense is way more competitive for bigs than it is for guards. Kobe would not have more all defense 1st teams if the teams were positionless. Duncan was going up against some combination of Kevin Garnett, Ron Artest, Marcus Camby, Dikembe Mutumbo, Andrei Kirilenko, LeBron James, Tyson Chandler, Ben Wallace and Dwight Howard every year for nearly a decade."
He compared it to lebron james leaving cleveland but lebron left as a free agent. Not while he was under contract. Dame just recently signed a fresh max deal.
"&gt; sign 1+1 deals  You mean like LeBron James did when he went back to the Cavs?   They can also turn down the 5 year rookie extension if they don't want to be stuck with the franchise that drafted them for that long. Just like LeBron only took a 3 year rookie extension.   All these people scream ""player empowerment"" and honestly LeBron is a good example in a lot of ways. Except he never pulled this ""sign a max then beg for trade"" garbage like AD, PG13, Harden and now maybe Dame. When LeBron wants flexibility, he gets it up front and in writing."
The general public doesn't give a fuck about LeBron James. To them he's just a big name basketball player.
"In my very limited example, my 14-year-old daughter, who knows who LeBron James is but doesn't follow anything sports-related, loved it."
There have been no finals since 2011 without Lebron James or Steph. This is the first one.
https://www.si.com/nba/2018/11/03/jr-smith-cavs-trade-request-adam-silver-koby-altman-lebron-james  You don‚Äôt need to be a star to request a trade. JJ Redick requested one.
"It ended up being pretty disappointing for me. It ended up coming off as an ad for HBO MAX and a Lebron ego massage first and foremost with the enjoyment of actual move audiences an afterthought. The entire first 15 minutes is basically just Lebron bending in half and blowing himself. The whole multiverse thing could have been fun but it was really underutilized which is why the whole movie ended up feeling like an HBOMAX ad. Lebron James' acting ability has somehow regressed. His voice acting was so bad that I'm convinced that he did all of it in one take over zoom.  It's not all bad though. Some of the parts once he turned into a cartoon were funny, entering the different universes was good, and the cameo appearance was great."

"We couldn't have signed anyone else. Your whole point ignores the context surrounding his contract. We're in Milwaukee which means no one's coming to us. He's Giannis' guy. We don't really have cap flexibility even with him at 5 mil less. He's signed more recently than some great players who will absolutely make more than him. The max contract and salary cap sets an arbitrary limit on how much players make, so guys like LeBron will always be severely underpaid in comparison to their output and it'll make it seem as though they're valued the same as lower tier guys.   James harden is making $7mil more so I don't see why he's relevant to the conversation, were also never fucking getting him to stay here.  Klay is only making 2.5mil more but he hasn't played since 2019, so I'd absolutely prefer Middleton.   It's not about him doing great for himself, it's about him completely living up to his contract and this subreddit being clueless when it comes to evaluating player value.   Also saying him being cheaper would be better is ridiculous, you can say that about every player in the NBA."
"&gt;‚ÄúYou got all of these people debating it, and everybody is still saying LeBron James is still the best player in the world,‚Äù Green explained. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when I kind‚Äôve felt like it took a turn.

"After watching it I'm surprised that so many people are so mad at this movie. I was expecting to either be cringing the whole time or falling asleep by the way people were complaining about everything in it, but I thought it was a pretty fun yet corny movie and was about as good as you could expect from a movie with a basketball player as the lead actor who is interacting with cartoons. LeBron's acting was definitely rough when they needed him to be serious, but I think during the silly scenes where he's just reacting to the tunes it was easier to overlook.  I think it did a good job of not taking itself too seriously and took some shots at LeBron to balance out all the 'King James', 'He came back from down 3-1 so he can do this' stuff, like the villain talking about him leaving all of his teams, saying he can't boss him around cause he's not his coach, and when they had LeBron complaining to the ref at the beginning of the game."
LeBron James? Also best GM.
The original was cinematic masterpiece and idc ppl can downvote me. But if u born in early 90‚Äôs u obviously gonna love it. And then 25 years later when u watch it again wit ur kids on the same vhs u had when you were a kid and you realize that Elmer Fudd and the prospector guy were doing a pulp fiction bit. That‚Äôs insane! A pulp fiction reference in a kids movie! What a wild time! And your wife is like why are you laughing that hard lol cus she‚Äôs a basic bitch who‚Äôs never seen Tarantino movies?

"LeBron was great in that Amy Schumer movie, but he was also playing LeBron James...so, take that however. But his comedic timing and ability to make fun of himself actually changed how I saw him as a real person, it brought out a human side that I don't think we'd really seen before then."
"So, this movie was compared to Ready Play 1 and I liked that movie so I figured I would like this movie. Not at all similar.

Lebron James the 420th is the top draft prospect. It's rumored that the Cleveland Lebrons will trade up in the draft to take him so he can play with Cyborg Lebron his great x 418 grandfather. They are planning to offer a 2nd rounder and the rights to the Kuzma Memorial

It took me my pretty much his entire career to admit LeBron James was great. Larry Bird is closer to 10 all time than 5. Marcus Smart might never get back to his previous defensive level.

"&gt;We already have Boucher and Birch who are a very good backup 4 and 5, we just need a bigger starting 5.  1) Birch is a FA  2) I'd rather use my team's resources to trade for Lebron James, but that doesn't mean that preference should stop me from seeing the realistic options in front of me.

"Hmm, this makes me wonder: Are there any instances where the league MVP won the Finals, but wasn't the best player in the playoffs?   Kareem is an obvious argument, but this post pretty much seals that one right here for me.   Willis Reed missed ONE game in 1970, but it wasn't the clincher and he did get the MVP (including Reg. Season AND the ASG). That's similar to Kareem's performance, but with the obvious MVP snub. A good comparison for sure  A cool list I found: https://www.allaboutbasketball.us/nba/nba-players-who-have-won-regular-season-mvp-finals-mvp-and-championship-in-the-same-year.html  **Kareem Abdul Jabbar**  Kareem Abdul Jabbar won six championships, two finals MVP and six regular season MVP awards but only once he has been able get these three honors together in the same year. It was the 1970- 71 season when he won all three with Milwaukee Bucks.  **Moses Malone**  Moses Malone picked up regular season MVP, Finals MVP and NBA title in 1983 as a member of the Philadelphia 76ers. He was the only player in NBA history who won back to back MVP awards with two different teams (previously with the Houston Rockets in 1982).  **Larry Bird**  Larry Bird, the former Celtics forward, achieved this ultimate feat twice in his career, in 1984 and after that in 1986, on both occasions with the Boston Celtics.  **Magic Johnson**  Magic Johnson won double MVPs and a championship in 1986-87 season with the Los Angeles Lakers. He also knocked the game- winning shot in the finals series against the Boston Celtics and led the team in winning a championship.  **Michael Jordan**  Winning both MVPs and championship once is special but what about doing it four times in the career. This has been done by perhaps the greatest basketball player of all time called Michael Jordan. He won league MVP, finals MVP and Championship four-times in 1991, 1992, 1996 and 1998.  **Hakeem Olajuwon**  Hakeem Olajuwon completely dominated the 1993-94 season. He won both the MVP awards, defensive player of the year award and championship and became the only player in NBA history to get all these honors together in the same year.  **Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal**  For his all-round performance in 1999-00 season, Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal earned both the regular season and finals MVP awards and an NBA title. That particular season, he also became an All-Star game MVP and a scoring champion too.  **Tim Duncan**  In 2002-03 NBA season, Tim Duncan walked away with the leagues MVP and the finals MVP awards. He also won a championship with Spurs that year. That made him only the ninth player to get these three honors together in the same year.  **LeBron James**  LeBron James is the latest to join this elite group by winning regular season MVP, finals MVP and a championship with Miami Heat in 2012.  TLDR: Nope, the MVP is always the team's best player in the playoffs on title teams."
"&gt; LeBron James  Lebron hasn't played a full season in 4 years, injured this year and 2 years ago and came in 13th in MVP voting this year.  He ain't going to be a top 5 player anymore and will be lucky if he even plays 40% of games next year at 37."

I'm not saying what LeBron did wasn't kind of pathetic. What I am saying is that LeBron James is still a top 3 player in the league and USA Basketball would be lucky to have him  Kevin Love does not move the needle and really had no business being there in the first place

"‚ÄúAsk Wade and Heat forward Chris Bosh for their defining Bryant moments, and they simultaneously drift to the summer of 2008. It was 10 days after the Lakers lost to Boston in the Finals, and Team USA had convened for its first mini-camp meeting in preparation for the Beijing Olympics. Spoiler alert: It‚Äôs quintessential Kobe.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in Las Vegas and we all come down for team breakfast at the start of the whole training camp,‚Äù Bosh said. ‚ÄúAnd Kobe comes in with ice on his knees and with his trainers and stuff. He‚Äôs got sweat drenched through his workout gear. And I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs 8 o‚Äôclock in the morning, man. Where in the hell is he coming from?'‚Äù  Wade chimes in along memory lane.  ‚ÄúEverybody else just woke up. We‚Äôre still stretching and yawning and looking at [Kobe] like, ‚ÄòWhat the f‚Äî?'‚Äù Wade said as he squinted into a frown and then burst into laughter. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all yawning, and he‚Äôs already three hours and a full workout into his day.‚Äù  Bosh interrupts.  ‚ÄúYou never forget stuff like that,‚Äù Bosh said. ‚ÄúI felt so bad. I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòWhat is he trying to prove?‚Äô But he was just doing his normal routine. We‚Äôre all supposed to be big-time NBA players, Olympians and stuff. And then there‚Äôs Kobe, taking it to another level from Day 1. And I had been off for like three months.‚Äù  Bryant‚Äôs approach spoke volumes that morning, although he never uttered a word to Wade, Bosh, LeBron, Carmelo or anyone else.  To Kobe, it was no big deal. After all, who doesn‚Äôt get in a grueling workout before sunrise on the opening day of summer camp?  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all sitting there thinking, ‚ÄòMan, I‚Äôve got to reevaluate what I‚Äôm doing as a player,'‚Äù Wade said. ‚ÄúThat set the tone for pretty much everybody. But that‚Äôs always been Kobe.‚Äù  And to his fiercest peers, that always will be Kobe.  And then, to prove that hard work pays off, in the Gold Medal game, Team USA found themselves in a close game going down the stretch against Spain. Who was it that came through when it mattered most? The man himself, Kobe.‚Äù          From an espn True Hoop article.       ‚ÄúI always aimed to kill the opposition. The main thing LeBron and I discussed was what constitutes a killer mentality. He watched how I approached every single practice, and I constantly challenged him and the rest of the guys,‚Äù Bryant wrote then.  ‚ÄúI remember there was one half when we were messing around. I came into the locker room at half-time and asked the guys‚Äîin a less PG manner‚Äîwhat in the hell we were doing. In the second half, LeBron responded in a big way‚Äîhe came out with a truly dominant mindset. And I‚Äôve seen him lead that way ever since.‚Äù -excerpt from Mamba Mentality.         Turns out what we have witnessed was early Lebron James after adding some of Kobe‚Äôs mentality."
"They don't say, Lebron, King or James enough in the movie."
Lol why not? Since when does playing with ONE superstar stop a player from putting up numbers? Kyrie averaged 25 when he was with Lebron. He averaged 27 with KD and James Harden. Paul George averages 27 with Kawhi. What are you talking about?

"Wilt would have scored 100 in any era. Why would you leave him off? He was a bigger, faster and stronger Lebron James. He could run down the court faster than Lebron James on less steps to do it than Giannis. Dude didn't need to pass cause he shot 54% FG% mainly using a fade away jump shot that would go out as far as 17 feet. His fade away was more automatic than Jordans, which was literally the most consistent shot in the entire league in his era, and would be in todays era. He holds the record for 35 consecutive field goals made mostly on fade away shots.   If you told me there was someone who played today, who was 7'1"" could shoot 63 FG's in a game, and make above 50% of them while still being the most energized player at the end of the game a few weeks before playoffs started, I wouldn't believe you and I would say he'd be winning MVP's back to back to back."

And it stars LeBron James.
"Andre Iguodala is a more well-rounded player offensive player than Michael Cooper.  I agree he isn't a Hall of Famer, but he isn't too far below that level.  Incidentally, why was Iguodala a controversial FMVP?  LeBron James was even better in the 2015 NBA Finals (and I personally would have selected him as a FMVP), but I can understand why he didn't receive it; his team lost the series.  On the winning Warriors team, IMO Iguodala was clearly the most deserving player."
"You may be right but similar pronouncements were made in 2004 when the team had Lebron James, Carmello Anthony, Allen Iverson, Tim Duncan, Amar'e Stoudemire, Dwayne Wede, Stephon Marbury, etc."
"If he'd been a generation earlier he'd have been a forward in a league with Malone, Barkley, Pippen, etc. If he'd been two generations earlier he'd have been with Bird, Dr J, James Worthy, Kevin McHale, etc. If he'd been a generation later he'd have been with LeBron, KD, Giannis, Kawhi, etc. This is why Pierce is not the all time great a lot of Celtics fans want to pretend he was. He was a very good player, but he wasn't one of the best of his era, nor would he have been in any other era."
The last all nba first team player lebron played in the east when he made 8 straight finals was derrick rose in 2011. In 2020 alone he played james harden and ad being his teammate was also nba first team. There is a reason why hawks made the ecf and lakers got bounced in the first round. Lakers even with ad injured are wayyyy better than the hawks but got bounced because of the competition.  Lakers had to play in a play in game when they are tied with the 8th best record but the knicks had home court advantage with a worse record then the lakers. East has been trash this century and still is just as trash. Ad never made it out of the second round before lebron cause west has been dominant.
"Harden, he made a career out of running into LeBron James for free throws."

"In football I've seen it defined as a player who stays in the top 2-3 in the game for 10+ years, so Messi and Ronaldo for example.

I can only really see Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Zion Williamson making it to that level."
LeBron James
"If we're considering having had a constant impact deep into the playoffs, I'd say the likes of Jokic, Embiid, Luka and Dame still have some work to d to make the top 5:  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Steph Curry  4. Giannis Antetokounmpo  5. Kawhi Leonard"
enter lebron james and saves the world.. perfect storyline
"Weird, come think of it, I've never heard ESPN use the phrase ""ties Lebron James ever"" in a stat. They always have one for when another players stats get passed."
"In case you are pay walled:  #Thwaaap! Giannis Blocks a Shot‚Äîand Milwaukee and Phoenix Have a Series A brilliant defensive play by the two-time MVP prevents a dunk, and NBA Finals are thrillingly deadlocked  The NBA Finals between Milwaukee and Phoenix are knotted 2-2 after Milwaukee‚Äôs impressive 109-103 come-from-behind win Wednesday. A few quick thoughts:  This is a refreshing reboot. The Bucks haven‚Äôt won a Finals since 1971. The Suns have never won a Finals. While I enjoy watching pinnacle talents like LeBron James and Kevin Durant stack their championship r√©sum√©s, seeing all these new faces on the league‚Äôs biggest stage is energizing. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, Devin Booker, DeAndre Ayton, future Hall of Fame point guard Chris Paul‚Äîthese Finals are full of first-timers with an opportunity for career-defining moments, and we‚Äôre getting a bunch of them so far.  Fresh energy is always good. The NBA built itself on starcraft and iconography‚Äîelevating names like Magic, Bird, Jordan, James, KD and Curry, but the hazard comes when the biggest stars are eliminated or injured, and the assumption is that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúdown‚Äù year for the sport. Not always. This series shows it.   Giannis! The low-key Middleton deserves credit for bailing out the Bucks with 40 points in Game 4, but this series has been an indelible showcase for Antetokounmpo, a two-time MVP who still contends with a low frequency of grumbling that he‚Äôs not among the NBA‚Äôs peak elite. Bah: Giannis is incredible, and he‚Äôs only getting better. Antetokounmpo seemed lost for the season when he injured his knee in the Eastern Conference finals; versus Phoenix, he‚Äôs playing with characteristic relentlessness, averaging 32.2 points and 14 rebounds, and appears locked in on the chance to get Milwaukee its first title since Kareem and the Big O delivered one.  Giannis‚Äôs signature Finals moment may prove to be a spectacular defensive one: with barely a minute left in Wednesday‚Äôs game, he leapt from somewhere on the outskirts of Sheboygan to block a game-tying alley-oop dunk by an airborne Ayton. Watch it again if you can, it‚Äôs astonishing: Antetokounmpo is thoroughly beaten on the play, spun in a pick and roll, and has a foot near the free-throw line when Booker lofts the oop skyward, and yet Antetokounmpo somehow manages to track back, turn his body completely in the other direction, and leap for a perfectly clean swat above the rim of a 7-foot-1 center.   Who does such things? Basically, comic book characters, and Giannis.    Meanwhile, Middleton has been quietly essential for the whole Milwaukee run, including those two Giannis-less victories over Atlanta to get here, and dumping 38 in a crucial Game 6 victory over Brooklyn when the Bucks looked like toast. In the 29-year-old second-rounder, the Bucks have a co-headliner whose fluid, clutch scoring perfectly complements Giannis‚Äôs blunt power‚Äîthese stars may be dissimilar, but that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre such a potent 1-2.   Focus on Giannis, and Middleton burns you. Switch it up, and get more of the same. The Bucks can maddeningly complicate things for themselves, but it really may be that simple.   As for Phoenix, they remain very much in this series. (it‚Äôs tied, for crying out loud!) The Suns got some early excellence from the veteran Paul (32 points in Game 1) as they raced to a 2-0 series lead, their rotation has more depth than Milwaukee‚Äôs, and they had a clear chance to jump to a 3-1 lead Wednesday. In Game 4, Booker had the thrilling, pour-it-on ‚ÄúBooker game‚Äù everyone had been waiting for, with 42 points‚Äîthough playing with five fouls in the fourth quarter, Booker also got a miraculous reprieve from officials who missed a double-armed intentional tackling foul he made on Milwaukee‚Äôs Jrue Holiday.  The NBA is a sport in which they‚Äôre now halting games for dull, FBI-style forensics on fingertip out-of-bounds plays, and they somehow didn‚Äôt see the equivalent of a QB sack.  There‚Äôs no asterisk to this title. There‚Äôs been a persistent muttering that this title will be somehow diminished because Phoenix got past some banged-up teams (the Lakers without Anthony Davis, Denver without Jamal Murray, the Clippers deprived of Kawhi Leonard) and Milwaukee barely escaped an East without a fully loaded Nets team. Please. The path to any championship is always paved with opportunism and moments of fortune, and great teams capitalize. If anything, I‚Äôd take the other side of the argument: winning a championship this season, which arrived fast on the heels of the ‚Äúbubble tournament‚Äù in Orlando and began with empty stadiums due to Covid-19, is an even more striking accomplishment. No asterisks for the ‚Äúbubble title,‚Äù or this one. Come on. Don‚Äôt be absurd.   I have no idea what‚Äôs going to happen here, and that‚Äôs great. Some truth in the fine print: Game 4 was the first really competitive, down-to-the-wire game of this series. As the series shifts to Game 5 in Phoenix on Saturday‚Äîthanks, basketball, for the extended delay, maybe I‚Äôll go off to culinary school and get a degree in the interim‚Äîit‚Äôs hard to get a read on where it‚Äôs going. Phoenix‚Äôs championship-starved crowd is at full tilt. Milwaukee‚Äôs championship-starved crowd is at full tilt. You could argue the Bucks have momentum, but the home teams have held thus far.   Do you have a sense that one opponent has unlocked the other? I don‚Äôt, and that‚Äôs the exciting thing. There‚Äôs nothing duller than a Final with a vibe of inevitability, and there‚Äôs none here. We truly don‚Äôt know for sure who‚Äôs going to win it, and that‚Äôs the best possible sell. That, and Giannis. He‚Äôs really something else."
"Can‚Äôt really act like there‚Äôs a rule.   Isiah Thomas was a 1st team All-NBA at age 22, same with Dwight Howard.   There are plenty of players that saw success at age 22, the reason why Luka is the most successful 21 year old is more of a part that the previous generations players were rookies at age 22 as opposed to 18-19 like they are today.   You could easily argue that KD was overall better than Luka at the same age Luka is right now, KD finished 2nd in MVP voting to a prime Lebron James at age 21 and lead the league in scoring. He lead his team to the finals at age 22.  Acting like Luka should only be in competition with guys in the top 10 all time just shows that your not really factoring in why those guys ended up top 10 all time:"
BY GOD THAT'S LEBRON JAMES' MUSIC!!!!!
especially impressive when you consider that LeBron James played all 25 of those seasons.
"Lebron james got blocked by Nate Robison. Lebron is false hype.  Lol I don‚Äôt think wiseman is all that, but this logic makes no sense"
"Why would I give a shit about what critics have to say about a movie where LeBron James plays basketball with the toons in multiple animated worlds? There are so many movies that I absolutely love that  critics shit on because it's not the next Shawshank redemption.  People who are saying that since this is a kids movie and Pixar makes movies for the kids then we should compare it with Pixar and it should be of that quality are clowns. This is a movie where I will shut my brain off and have some fun watching Looney Tunes and Bron play some ball and there's nothing wrong with that. Hot Rod is at 39% on rotten tomatoes and I couldn't care less. I think it's funny and great to just sit down, shut my brain off, and watch. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna enjoy this Space Jam too."

Lebron James
"I'm not sure what your point is.  The Atlantic article you link also says the movie is just a bunch of marketing:  ""Space Jam represented the apotheosis of crass commercialism in 1996. So it makes sense that its sequel attempts to do the same, essentially functioning as a glitzy advertisement for the studio that created it. The cast has been updated‚Äîour hero is now LeBron James, Jordan‚Äôs successor as the reigning king of basketball‚Äîand so has the shamelessness, as James and Bugs Bunny zoom through scenes from past WB movies and marvel at how one company could have such a grand history.""  Just because it's marketing Warner Brothers properties more than Sprite cans, doesn't make it any less a marketing ploy."
"Well specifically in America, but Lebron James around the same popularity as Ronaldo, he's more popular but not by a crazy amount"
Lebron James. He left his hometown because he couldn't win. Left a dynasty in the making because he got one of the biggest finals beatings of all time when the Spurs dismantled him so bad he was booed on his homecourt.   Then it was he didn't have enough help in Miami so he traded in the Big 3 for one of the best artful scorers and ball handlers ever in Kyrie and a big who had avg 20+ and 13 boards for 3 of his last 4 seasons. Wins a ring with this crew and immediately his two costars are constantly marginalized. Bron fans have actually told me K Love wasn't even that good and wasnt a star. James Block is seen as the iconic moment over Kyries game winner. Starts losing again so Kyrie leaves before James can ditch him. Kyrie is seen as an ingrate for doing this.   James leaves again has a top 5 player force a trade 2 years into his contract 2 team up with him. They win a ring. The top 5 player carries through the finals and then James stat pads literally playing in games that were clearly out of reach to get another MVP. Now that  former top 5 player is seen as less significant and James took a loser and won with him.   Now the James gang will romanticize his heroic story with their replys to my claim and prove my point.
He will literally be Lebron James.
"Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Russell, LeBron James.  There's your top four. Rearrange as you like."
"We all know he's considering the Lakers. Imagine telling someone in 2015 that you could have a starting lineup of Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and LaMarcus Aldridge on the same team. Fuck I hate super teams lmao"
"James Jones needs to repay Lebron, ungrateful ass. Send over Booker for Schroeder and call it even"
&gt;Say what you want about Bron but he'll trade or dump anyone to maximize his odds of winning lol.  Yea I'm calling bullshit on this. The last roster spot always went to James Jones when he was still active. He and Lebron were really tight.  Besides the Nets do need DJ during the regular season. Can't have KD playing center for 82 games.
**Career Effective Field Goal Percentages**  * Kobe Bryant - eFG% .482 * Clyde Drexler - eFG% .495 * Michael Cooper - eFG% .502 * Eddie Jones - eFG% .505 * Michael Jordan - eFG% .509 * Magic Johnson - eFG% .550 * LeBron James - eFG% .560  lmao - casual
The whining rule? The stop bitching act? The LeBron James r√©gulation?  Pick your poison.
"lebron james, kobe bryant, tracy mcgrady."
"&gt; ‚ÄúTo clarify any remaining misconception, LeBron James briefly attended an outdoor event last week where participants were required to be vaccinated or return a negative test result,‚Äù the statement reads. ‚ÄúUnder these circumstances and in consultation with medical experts, it was determined that his attendance did not create risks related to the spread of COVID-19 and therefore no quarantine was necessary.‚Äù  &gt;The NBA went on further to say that ‚ÄúUnder current NBA rules, vaccinated players are permitted to engage in outside activities including their individual commercial arrangements such as sponsor appearances or ad shoots.‚Äù  You make it sound like he was going out to strip clubs. I agree he probably got some preferential leaning in the decision, but I wouldn‚Äôt say it was the massive outrage people make it out to be.  Wasn‚Äôt there another player (some young guy) who also didn‚Äôt have to go in to protocols because the event he went to was similarly set up? I may be misremembering though."
"Wade was stuck getting bounced in the 1st round or missing the playoffs every year after Shaq fell off and got traded to Phoenix while Chris Bosh couldn‚Äôt make the playoffs at all in Toronto, let alone win in the playoffs.   Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love couldn‚Äôt crack 35 wins on their respective teams before LeBron, let alone make the playoffs, let alone win in the playoffs.  Anthony Davis couldn‚Äôt make the playoffs in New Orleans, let alone win in the playoffs.  LeBron turned every one of them into champions within the 1st 2 seasons lmao. Chris Bosh missed the entire 2012 2nd round series against Indiana, missed 4 of the 7 games against Boston in the ECF, and was limited to 12 and 7 in only 25 mpg in the 3 games he did play in that series after returning from injury. They still won the East and ultimately the championship because LeBron was the best player in the league by far.  In 2013 Wade was having obvious knee issues through the whole playoff run. He averaged less than 14 points on below 37% shooting in round 1 vs Milwaukee, averaged less than 13 points in round 2 against the Bulls, and averaged less than 16 ppg on below 44% shooting in the ECF vs. Indy. Bosh averaged 11 points and 4 rebounds on less than 38% shooting in that same ECF vs Indy. They still won the East and ultimately the championship against one of the best teams of all time in the Spurs because LeBron was the best player in the league by far. They won the finals against the Spurs in the minutes that Wade was on the bench in favor of Ray Allen.   But yes, LeBron was one ‚Äúcockriding‚Äù them and not the other way around. Can‚Äôt make this shit up lol. I didn‚Äôt even get into the part where Kevin Love dislocated his shoulder in round 1 of the 2015 playoffs and they still rampaged to the finals without him only for Kyrie to get hurt in game 1 of the finals so LeBron could push one of the greatest teams of all time in Golden State to 6 games with a starting 5 of Delly/Shump/Bron/TT/Mosgov because he was the best player in the league by far.   Also didn‚Äôt yet mention the 2016 playoffs when Love averaged 8 points on 35% shooting against the 73 win Warriors who were an awful matchup for him but the Cavs still came back down 3-1 with LeBron putting in arguably the greatest finals performance of all time because he was the best player in the league by far.  While we‚Äôre at it let‚Äôs fast forward to 2018 after Kyrie was PMSing and forced a trade in which the Cavs got back a pile of garbage and still went on to win the East and make the finals with Jeff Green being their 2nd best player in the playoffs ahead of ‚Äúsuperstar‚Äù Kevin Love. That same team went on to win 19 fucking games the next season when Bron went to LAL.  Sounds like Bron was really cockriding them hard though lmao.   Meanwhile when MJ retired to play baseball the Bulls still won 55 games, pushed the Knicks 7 games in the 2nd round, and got screwed out an ECF appearance at least by the referees. Anchored by arguably the best coach of all time, MJ had a supporting cast that was still a contender without him. When Lebron left Cleveland for Miami, they won 19 fucking games after winning 61 with the same team the year before plus LeBron. But MJ is WARRIOR for being drafted to an organization that put him in an incredible situation  unlike the COWARD LeBron who only carried Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Mo Williams to the finals once before leaving after wasting 7 years. Lmaoooo.  Kobe got drafted to play in LA with one of the 3 most dominant players in the modern era while also getting to play for one of the best coaches of all time. Kobe averaged 15 points on 35% shooting in the finals against Indiana and they still won easily because Shaq averaged literally close to 40 points on  almost 60% shooting lmao. THAT is cockriding like a playboy bunny. But once again, What an absolute GAMER  for not leaving the absolutely perfect situation that was brought to him unlike the FRAUD LeBron James who went running from Drew Gooden and Larry Hughes after 7 years. Also Kobe totally didn‚Äôt publicly request a trade after they had a couple bad years after Shaq left before they got Pau Gasol and reloaded. That definitely didn‚Äôt happen and Kobe would‚Äôve stuck it out for way more than 7 years in Cleveland with Boobie Gibson and Jamario Moon because he was a true junkyard DOG unlike LEBUM.  The LeBron hating cult has gone way past the point of insufferable. Y‚Äôall have been bitching about a dude leaving the most incompetent franchise in sports (while Boston was in the conference coming off a finals appearance with 4 stars on one team, mind you) for literally over a decade now. Get over it."
"Dude, he won 60+ games (multiple times) and made 2 NBA Finals with some bummy ass Cavs teams. And now he has AD and Westbrook. The fit doesn‚Äôt matter, the talent is obviously there and it‚Äôs LeBron fucking James. They‚Äôll be fine lmao"
Yeah but they have LeBron James. I‚Äôm amazed you can still doubt any LeBron led team after watching him cock your team in the playoffs for years lmao
"Ah yes, the most well-known underdog career in the modern NBA...LeBron ""Heatles"" James."
The current top 10:  1. Michael Jordan  2. Bill Russell  3. Kareem Abdul Jabbar  4. Tim Duncan  5. Magic Johnson  6. Larry Bird  7. LeBron James  8. Shaquille O'Neal  9. Wilt Chamberlain  10. Hakeem Olajuwon   Tell me who he would replace?
"&gt; and if he doesn't do that the MJ stans will just call him ringless or ""only 1 ring"" or whatever the case may be. no matter what lebron has done in his career he's been shit on by certain people  Oh no, his hand has been forced because @LeMickey42069 said MJ won *real* rings.   He's LeBron James, a billionaire international sports icon. He's not making his super teams because people on instagram and Kendrick Perkins are cyberbullying him. Stop acting like he doesn't own his decisions."
"In terms of Lebron James' name, 2 of the 11 letters are Le, which comes out to 18%. For Ben McLemore, 2 of the 11 letters are also Le, which also comes out to 18%. Dude's literally on par with Lebron James and Dame still claims to have not enough help smh"
There should be a game show where you show an audience Instagram captions and they have to guess whether it came from LeBron James or Dejounte Murray.
"It works the reverse too - there are guys who are decent role players on lottery teams, and when people think that‚Äôs underwhelming for a team with Lebron James suddenly it‚Äôs ‚Äúomg if you don‚Äôt think this guy is immediately out 4th best player, you are just a hater.‚Äù"
"People were laughing at Kuzma because he didn't live up to expectation of guys from ESPN who were telling he should ""take over"" from LeBron James. Him and KCP played the most minutes on Lakers this season (after Schroder), and didn't hold the standard of the strong title favorites. Doesn't mean they are worthless as rotations guys on a team that went 34-38 in the East."
"What does it mean to be able to win ""in the right team"" if that team has LeBron James, Anthony Davis and a handful of free agents who signed for millions less than their market value lol. You gonna give Melo props for winning a ring with the Lakers too?"
LeBron James
Lebron proved himself years prior and after lol. I‚Äôm shocked you‚Äôd compare Lebron James to a Kevin Love sub 500 team lmao
No one said Russ was better as the main guy lol.  Well now he's playing with LeBron James who is better than KD
"Yeah I'm pretty sure the biggest factor of whether a player is considering ""winning"" or not the last decade is their proximity to LeBron James lol  Looks pretty promising for Russ and the Lakers this year."
"Some guys here said Melo had no place in the NBA no more  2019 people say LeBron was a liability in defense. Last year before the injury he was one of the best defenders in the league  Dwight Howard is a locker room cancer  KD is coming back at 60% of himself. May be 80% if he's extremely happy  James Harden is the worst superstar defender because he doesn't care (advanced stats shows he's a very good defender, even at the post)  Giannis can't win a ring because he's a liability in the playoffs against the walls because he can't shoot  Jaylen Brown doesn't deserve that contract.  Trae Young can't succeed yet in playoffs  Chris Paul's contract is a liability for an injury prone old, undersized player"
"I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs really a fair characterization of Kanter, or at the very least, by using that logic, you can easily discredit nearly every athlete‚Äôs stance on social justice.   &gt; a) authoritarian regimes, he only has problems with a specific one  In addition to his very public spat with the Turkish government, Kanter was one of the few NBA players that made a statement clearly alluding to  [China during the Hong Kong protest, and specifically Lebron‚Äôs response](https://sports.yahoo.com/enes-kanter-lebron-james-nba-china-turkey-051919243.html). Something that no other NBA player did (to my knowledge, willing to edit). Kanter does frame his battle as a personal one with Turkey, but I do think it‚Äôs  disingenuous to see his statements like:   &gt; Rise of Strongmen is a grim reminder that sustained vigilance is a must for every society  Or   &gt; We need to stop authoritarian leadership in its tracks so it doesn‚Äôt have a chance to evolve into systemic change limiting freedoms and human rights.Standing up to Dictators like @RTErdogan now gives us a chance to restore democracy.  As messages specificly applied to Turkey and only Turkey. He has done/said infinitely more work on the international political scenes then 99.99% of the rest of the league, but it will never be good enough.   &gt; b) that specific one with anti-authoritarian/liberal intentions, he's a member of a cult.  Calling Turkey an anti-authority liberal intentioned  government (which I think is what sub point B is about) is an odd move, when [there has been a movement of constitutional amendments to keep Erdogan in power for 3 decades](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/04/13/the-turkish-constitutional-referendum-explained/), including another wave proposed constitutional amendments [including the elimination of the opposition in democratic forums(HPD Party)](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-politics-erdogan-idUSKBN2A13EQ)  &gt; Rights groups and Turkey's Western allies have criticised what they see as increasing authoritarianism and threats to the rule of law under Erdogan, especially since a 2016 coup attempt that prompted sweeping crackdowns on his perceived opponents in public services, the military and elsewhere.  I guess it‚Äôs a good think you are only calling him a cultist and not a terrorist like the Turkish government does (because it‚Äôs common in the liberal world to put athletes on terrorist watchlist) . At the very least the language of calling people names who disagree is evolving."
"But now you're wasting LeBron James! Asking a guy who's still a top 5 player to play off ball (where he's at his least valuable on the floor these days) is like the Russ situation I laid out *but worse*.   LeBron is one of the few players who's better than Russ as a primary creator, and the best offensive efficiency for the team as a whole always will happen on plays where he's the primary ball handler, just like in Miami with Wade, just like in Cleveland with Kyrie.   Russ can be a primary ball handler/secondary scorer next to many superstars, but in order for that to work he has to be a better shot distributor than the other guy. He was a better distributor than KD, Beal, PG, and about even with Harden, but LeBron is a more skilled passer than he is, and a more threatening scorer off the bounce himself because of his ability to hit tough shots. Any possession Russ primarily dictates will feel like a win for the opposing defense when it means marginalizing LeBron."
"I'm not ignorant nor arrogant you're literally assigning rankings to a completely nebulous concept called basketball ""gravity"" and using one single tweet to prove your point. But because I watch basketball and you don't, I can name 5 players just off the top of my head that NBA teams would never not guard before they would not guard Duncan Robinson. Kyrie Irving, Keving Durant, James Harden, Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, Joel Embid, Trae Young, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, Lebron James ...oh wait that's more than 5."
"\&gt; he very clearly declined  On paper, he was 3rd in PER, the same spot he was in the previous year.   Using the eyetest, he perfectly transitioned to a more off-ball position (as well as a non-shooter could) and would still cook mofos off the dribble whenever LeBron went off the court.  \&gt;He was no the same player physically, he didn't move as fast.  A lot less chances to show off your speed off the dribble when your playing as an offball slasher and have LeBron as an outlet pass on fastbreaks. If there was a decline it was minimal because he was still lethal at the rim and on fast breaks.  \&gt;He could shut down anyone before  Key individuals he guarded for a significant portion of games in 2012 Playoffs:   J.R. Smith who shot 12ppg on 31%.  Paul George (before he was a star) who shot 10ppg on 37%.    Danny Granger (secondary defender on him) who shot 13ppg on 38%.  Ray Allen who shot 12ppg on 38%   James Harden 13ppg on 38%  Russel Westbrook (secondary defender) 27ppg on 43%   Outside of Westbrook who he wasn't even a primary defender on, the others all shot significantly worse from their regular season standard.  \&gt; he used to get a ton of blocks for a guard.  He tied his career high in blocks per game in less minutes per game."
&gt; it's not very hard to recruit for a team with **LeBron James** and **located in Los Angeles** lol
"No, absolutely not.  Pelinka has done a great job ofcourse, but he is located in freakin' Los Angeles, and happens to have LeBron James and AD in his team. He did not really work all that much to land these two superstars. The city, and the weather did the talking.  We in Toronto have to deal with a host of problems in attracting free agents. This is why I value Masai/Webster from Toronto, and even GMs like Sam Presti who have been a step ahead."
it's not very hard to recruit for a team with LeBron James and located in Los Angeles lol
"LeBron Raymone James Sr. (/l…ôÀàbr…ín/; born December 30, 1984), nicknamed ""King James"", is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Widely considered one of the best players in NBA history, James is frequently compared to Michael Jordan in debates over the greatest basketball player ever.[1] The only player to have won NBA championships with three franchises (the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Miami Heat, and the Lakers) as NBA Finals MVP,[2] James has competed in ten NBA Finals, eight of them consecutively with the Heat and the Cavaliers from 2011‚Äì2018. His accomplishments include four NBA championships, four NBA MVP awards, four NBA Finals MVP awards, and two Olympic gold medals. During his 17-year career, James holds the record for all-time playoffs points, is third in all-time points, and eighth in career assists. James has been selected to the All-NBA Team a record 17 times (with a record of 13 First Team selections and 11 consecutive First Team selections, the latter of which is shared with Jordan and Karl Malone), made the NBA All-Defensive First Team five times, and has been named an All-Star 17 times, including three All-Star MVP selections."
And now he is going to be with Lebron James and Anthony Davis...
James Jones‚Ä¶you know Lebron would give him a spot.
"What exactly is wrong with what I said?  &gt;Curry is one of the greatest players of all time at the tail end of his prime.  True.  &gt;You should probably go all-in and trade for/sign vets that can help right now.  Up for debate, but not unreasonable. See: James, LeBron and his MO  &gt;Threading the needle on staying competitively afloat while also getting young guys (and it should be noted that the young guys acquired aren't even regarded as ones that can immediately help, but rather super raw guys) is less than advisable.  Debatable, but not beyond the pale.  Can't wait for you to reply ""lol another dumbass paragraph""!"
"I agree, they should‚Äôve just done what the Lakers did to stop sucking and just sign a Lebron James and get AD to force a trade to them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÑ"
LeBron James actually left Cleveland in 2008 and joined the Miami Heat
The league is such a copycat League.  You always see this where someone has success doing something a certain way and then everyone feels like they have to do it or really they're so stupid and lack any creative thinking that they just take whatever's easily afforded to them. And if it fails they can just say well look that's what everyone else was doing. Everyone else was paying big contracts to these crafty veterans to come in and elevate a team of young players to play off success.  Could it be that Chris Paul was just a fluke? Could it be that LeBron James and his incredible performance in his mid-30 still being arguably the best player in the game at least top three is because he's an absolute genetic freak who also does everything he possibly can to stay on top?  I really think you're going to see Conley and Lowry become unplayable quickly. DeRozan is a little younger and he's a bigger guard but of course he can't space the floor so his life expectancy is going to be pretty short.
He's also the most hyped prospect since LeBron James. Some team gives him at least 20 million a year unless he literally has to amputate his leg. He's already making 75 million off a shoe deal.
Lebron James
Yuck! Gross! Google links.

I wouldn‚Äôt have too much confidence in David Griffin if I were you. The man only managed to build one championship team around LeBron fucking James.
"As much as LeBron James wants.  He understands the cap and teams situation.  He took less to sign with the Heat to fit in more talent.  James' value goes beyond the court.  He pulls talent at a cheaper rate (vet min.), he increases your franchises' exposure, he helps sell seats and merchandise more so than any player we've ever seen.  Jordan did a lot of the above, but other than Dennis Rodman, who did he draw to the Bulls?"
And to top it of   Teammate is :   -LeBron James   Effect: -15% 3PT accuracy
Counterpoint: LeBron James and Anthony Davis
The fact that their best players can stay healthy (ignore my flair my favorite team is lebron James)
The Lakers couldn‚Äôt get meetings with top-tier agents when they were absolute dogshit? How about them getting Lebron fucking James lol. I‚Äôm agreeing with you btw
Lebron James
"""Fuck Dem lights"" -LeBron James"
Lebron James.
None of those teams had Lebron James
"It‚Äôs a joke to feel like anyone loses anything. It‚Äôs a light, the production crew isn‚Äôt liable for what Lebron James does. Get over it"
And had like 5 first picks and LeBron James fall onto his lap.
"Fam, what? Lmao  You‚Äôre all over the place. You could have easily made this asinine statement without ever mentioning LeBron James. Why you chose not to do that is baffling, but whatever.   And no, NBA teams in the 90s didn‚Äôt have 2 ‚ÄúSupermax‚Äù players because ‚Äúsupermax‚Äù contracts weren‚Äôt even a thing. The NBA has a television deal in 2021 that is damn near worth more than the whole NBA was worth in the 90s, soooo yea.   The average NBA team in 2021 isn‚Äôt composed of 2 supermax players, as there are only 6 players in the league with a supermax contract.  Again‚Ä¶.fam, what?  Lol. You don‚Äôt even know what you‚Äôre taking about"
"Lmao, you got caught red handed and pulled an explanation out of your ass. Lebron‚Äôs defensive rating has been well above average for the past two seasons. [He was making a case for all-defensive team before he went down in March.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-star-index-lebron-james-continues-to-make-all-defense-case-but-damian-lillard-has-jumped-him-in-mvp-race/) EVERY fan who watches the Lakers knows this. You want to be taken seriously so bad it‚Äôs hilarious"
"Yea you‚Äôre right I never watched him play on the Lakers. I never watched him miss open shots created by LeBron James. I never watched him not take good shots because he only takes open shots. You‚Äôre right man, his percentages are definitely not screwed by his minimum shot selection."
"Ah yes, 18-time NBA champion LeBron James"
"Luka's playoffs were as impressive as any of those guys you just listed. And our rankings for right now don't care what you've accomplished in your career, but rather how good you are today.  Also, this isn't a slight on anyone in that top tier; they're all great. I just think Luka's top three. I'm not dead set on it; I could be convinced that he's actually below Steph, Lebron, and Jokic right now. I wouldn't put him below Harden, give that we last saw James as more out of shape and (more than) slightly injured."
"Only someone without a modicum of basketball knowledge would claim market size has no effect on the appeal of a destination. Look at every recent superstar who caused drama to force their way off their team and see where they eventually wound up:  * Kawhi Leonard: Forced his way out of San Antonio, pit stop in Toronto, ended up in Los Angeles * Anthony Davis: Forced his way out of New Orleans, ended up in Los Angeles * Paul George: Forced his way out of Indiana, pit stop in Oklahoma, ended up in Los Angeles * Jimmy Butler: Forced his way out of Minnesota, pit stop in Philly, ended up in Miami * James Harden: Forced his way out of Houston, ended up in Brooklyn, NYC  So you mean to tell me it's a coincidence that every single superstar who demands out ends up in either a huge market or desirable destination (Miami weather)?  The Lakers couldn't get meetings with major free agents when they were dogshit. 80% of NBA teams can't even get meetings with major free agents when they're good. What a horrendous ""argument"".  &gt;iT's nOt AbOuT BeInG a bIg oR sMaLl mArKeT  If your theory is true, why isn't anyone clamoring to head to Utah, Milwaukee or Denver? Why didn't a star join Minnesota or Sacramento to put them over the top against the Lakers in early 2000's? Or join Indiana or Toronto to try to put them over the top against Lebron?  You're clearly a casual yourself, put that Lakers flair back up lol, you're not fooling anyone."

"That's not at all what I'm saying. I'm saying LeBron and AD aren't &gt; than KD, Kyrie and James.  Let's say they are even a wash, tell me how the Lakers role players are better than the nets.  And the nets will feast when Russell is on the floor."
"I don't see the defense.  And the questions about offense are enough to give me pause whether or not it's a net positive.  We all know LeBron and AD are great if healthy.  But you think they have an advantage over KD, James, and Kyrie?  Let's say it's a wash for your arguments sake.  I don't see how the Lakers role players fit better than the nets guys."
"&gt;That expansion team had Oscar Robinson a top twenty player ever.  Yeah, and he was many years past his prime.  And they had almost nothing else.  &gt;I will have to take your word for it was not there in 71, there are not many better defenders the Dwight Howard so who are you thinking there?  Chamberlain, Walton, Thurmond, Lanier, Malone, Gilmore... 20 years of guys tried.  The problem for Howard would be that he's just too small.  Prime Abdul-Jabbar is a match for him athletically, and around 4 or 5 inches taller, with longer arms.  &gt;I mean Gasol can hit threes so might not be the best option  Now, yeah, but he barely even attempted one until he was 32.  And that version is getting absolutely torched on the defensive end.  If I'm coaching in this game, I do not care in the slightest if Gasol makes 1.5 threes -- his career high -- because McAdoo is scoring 40 on him, or Abdul-Jabbar is hanging 50.  &gt;This ignores the AD of it all as well, which is another all time great defender to throw at them.  You could get Davis to cover McAdoo, and he's well-suited to that... but good luck trying to get Davis to guard Abdul-Jabbar.  He's too small, and worse, refuses to play that position.  &gt;Prime Lebron is 2013 and Cooper is 4 inches and 100 pounds away there‚Äôs nothing he can do there.  James did not weigh 270 pounds in 2013.  And what Cooper would do is stay in James' jersey on the perimeter -- like he used to do with Bird, driving him to distraction -- and weight doesn't matter there.  So James would have to post him up, but then he'd have to deal with getting his shots over or around a free-lancing Abdul-Jabbar, which is next to impossible.  Abdul-Jabbar held entire playoff teams to 40% shooting in his prime.  &gt;Norm Nixon and Byron Scott can‚Äôt stay in front of Russ they just can‚Äôt,  Sure they could, they'd give him 6 feet of space, and let him shoot jumpers if he wants.  &gt; Magic won‚Äôt be able to guard Anthony in the slightest.  Johnson led the league in steals, twice, and his defense is wildly underrated.  He's also one of the smartest basketball players ever, so he'd just slack off Anthony and invite him to launch from distance... at his career 48% effective rate or even his peak 51%.  For that matter, depending on the ruleset used, I would be inclined just to zone up your team of James, Westbrook, Anthony, Davis and Howard or Gasol.  I'm begging that team to shoot from outside, because they are all poor shooters except James, and even his career number is mediocre.  &gt;Shaq and Karl Malone are the match of McADoo and Kareem, Gary Payton can guard Magic and Cooper couldn‚Äôt do much agonist Kobe  Cooper is about as well-equipped as any human to guard Bryant.  No, he couldn't stop him from shooting, no one ever could, including O'Neal.  But he'd force him to take hard shots, which is exactly what you want to do with Bryant, because he'll take them all game long, and miss most of them.  Payton tried to guard a healthy Johnson a couple times -- and got torched for 33 points each time, with 9 and 11 assists.  Johnson shot 12 for 14, and 11 for 14 against him in those games."

"&gt; They could happily prove their point with videos like I've done but they haven't so  [Lebron James is Underrated as a Defender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYedgu-va3)  [How Great Was LeBron James on Defense? Better Than Jordan.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FhqTVeL7_4)  [LeBron James | Examining his defense in 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsxlu7nYdhU)  [LeBron James Defense on James Harden - 2020 WCSF ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq2mwBvcJX4)  All of these are from the last 2 years. But that's a bad way of supporting an argument since you can just as easily find a ""LeBron No Defense compilation"" just as easily.  Both of them are cherry picked, although the Thinking Basketball video actually has defensive stats to support his argument, so that would be the best example, if you really feel the need to use videos.  If you can find a video from the last 2 years of LeBron being a bad defender with stats to support it I'd love to watch it."

I'll take 17. Stephen Curry/LeBron James  Curry taught his son many things in the finals
"James Jones, Mo Williams, Kyle Korver, Kendrick Perkins, Jason Kapono too  All former teammates of LeBron drafted in 2003. All 2nd round or late 1st round picks"
"&gt;I mean most people have prime Lebron over him  Yeah, and most people are wrong.  Abdul-Jabbar won 6 MVPs in a decade, and has a very strong argument that he was robbed at least twice.  He also took an expansion team to a title, in dominating fashion.  &gt;Howard and Gasol are all time defenders  Neither managed anything similar to the defensive season Abdul-Jabbar posted in '71.  No one has -- not even Chamberlain or Russell.  &gt;offense their whole job would be too slow those two down and they might be able too.  Better players than those two couldn't.  And whoever is guarding Gasol can play free-safety, which is a luxury the modern squad will not have.  &gt;I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs clear just that it‚Äôs close  I was referring only to the frontcourt matchup that you described.  &gt;On the other side they have no one who could guard Lebron or Melo,   You would put Cooper on Russ  That depends on which version of James we are talking about.  The current one, at 250 pounds or whatever, would be tough for Cooper, but if say, 2007-ish James then I would put Cooper/Worthy on him, Johnson/Wilkes on Anthony, and Nixon/Scott on Westbrook."
"you know nothing about either guy so for you to assume the carefully crafted public persona that is lebron james isn't an asshole is a huuuuge reach  we don't know these guys aside from what we get from the media, we literally can't say anything foolproof about their character that hasn't been filtered through"
"People thought exactly that about the Heat (LeBron ""not one, not two, not three..."" James included). The only difference is that LeBron is a more likeable guy with *way* more stans than KD so he got shit on less, and therefore the rings aren't ""worth less"""

They're either doing it for the memes or because they just hate Drake and don't care about throwing dirt on his name.

The NBA and basketball is a global sport. It isn't a US thing so we're allowed to not care about NBA cities as much as Americans do.

"&gt;Most NBA players live in West LA  You focused on the most affluent part of LA and then tried to invalidate me saying the same of the Bay Area. You completely ignored the fact there are NBA players in Los Angeles that aren‚Äôt LeBron James.  SF is definitely not too expensive for NBA players. But you can‚Äôt act like LA and the Bay Area are comparable in cost of living just by using Oakland as an example.   If you want to use Oakland, then you should compare it to a part of LA that takes just as long to get to Staples as it does from Oakland to Chase. Maybe Woodland Hills (where Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union lived until recently)? How do the houses compare then?   Edit: I think we‚Äôre butting heads over different things lol  I‚Äôm arguing that for the same price, you get more in LA by a significant margin. So I guess it‚Äôs not ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù but you just get more value for your investment"
The Lakers literally tanked with Lebron James on their roster lmao
"I get what you're saying. MJ has a relatively bigger public profile, is still generally positively-regarded and might have more people who view him positively than any other NBA player (maybe even athlete) ever.  But I think you're underestimating the amount of dislike people have for him. Especially LeBron fans who want people to recognize LeBron as the GOAT - because Jordan is the reason that folks are hesitant to call James the GOAT. The fact that there's a significant amount who view him negatively (LeBron stans, ""he's an asshole"", ""he said Republicans buy sneakers"", etc.) hurts his ""universal approval"". That's because if Yao has 95% (out of 1 billion) approval and MJ has 90% (out of 2 billion), Yao is closer to ""universal positive approval"" since % is the most important part."
Some of the best NBA players we consider top 10 had the luxury to play with another superstar or damn near superstar or a star.   Kobe with Shaq  Kareem Magic and Oscar  LeBron James pre heat....   MJ got arguably best coach in history but he needed another star to succeed (nothing wrong with that)   Magic literally played with an 80s version of a super team  Larry Bird got two hof big men  But yeah the carry team argument is just very flawed
"""Overall I think Pelinka is a genius of a GM who's strategy to team building is not followed enough by other GMs for whatever reason""  &amp;#x200B;  Maybe because theirs only 1 Lebron James... LA was building a team for the future, ended up getting Lebron and from there the rest was easy... Trade your ""future"" for AD to form a super duo and then what player doesnt wanna compete for the Lakers... in LA... with Lebron and AD?? Pelinka did what any other GM would have done lol he was just dealt the better hand out of all the GM's honestly."
"Right. We‚Äôre driving down Schroeder‚Äôs value by scoring 0 points in a playoff game for him, but clearly the worst player on the court was Lebron James. We‚Äôre all taking you very seriously"
You think LeBron James Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook are not a superteam lmfaoooooooooooooo
"I mean Steve Nash, Gary Payton, and Karl Malone are pretty big names. Artest certainly a better player than Kendrick Nunn. Not to mention, the league seemingly has gotten more ring chasy in the last 5 or so years it seems.   The Knicks point is just not relevant at all, they don't have lebron james or Anthony Davis. The nets on the other hand just got Blake on the cheap and would have had Lamarcus last year if not for his condition. Plus, I've never lived in LA but I have lived in BK, some of those winter days arent too pleasant, I imagine its a bit nicer in LA then on Atlantic ave when its 15 degrees out. The clippers are the clippers, there's an obvious allure to being on the Lakers over them, plus players very likely perceive the lakers as the better team (as do I)"
The entire cavs organization is overrated without Lebron James
James. Lebron James.
You‚Äôre out because you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. Caruso isn‚Äôt a good shooter. I swear I feel like a Pistons fan telling everyone Drummond isn‚Äôt as good as his stats say. If you watched him play you would have seen him miss a ton open looks created by LeBron fucking James
"Could also be he was buried in a Charlotte roster brimming with solid guards, and he figures a good way for him to get some good exposure is to maybe try to win and play well alongside Lebron James"
"&gt;I am not considering shot difficulty or volume in this scenario at all.  Right, that's an issue. You obviously need to take that into account. Acknowledging that you're not taking it into consideration doesn't fix the fact that you don't consider it.  &gt; I‚Äôm just noting that in the threes that they take, those 4 make about 40% of them  Single season 3 point shooting has huge variance, it's better to use 3 year sample sizes where that group only makes about 36%.   &gt;Therefore they are not a total walking brickfest  The Lakers were 21st in 3P% the last two years and they just got worse by getting rid of capable and willing shooters (and defenders) like KCP and Caruso and replacing them with one of the worst volume shooters of all time in Westbrook and a guy who is probably not going to be able to crack more than 20 minutes a game because of his defensive issues in Carmelo Anthony.  Sure, they're not ALL awful from three, but you're being pedantic. The point is obviously that the Lakers were already bad from 3 and they managed to get worse.  Most teams in the league (and certainly the best teams,) have at least 2 very good shooters. When your best shooter is Carmelo Anthony and your second best shooter is LeBron James, that is a problem."
"For real. If every GM put in the work, they too could get a 26 year-old superstar to publicly demand a trade to their teams.   And it‚Äôs not like every team doesn‚Äôt have the history, branding, and market size to attract LeBron James."
See anytime someone says that about the small market teams I would counter by saying look at the lakers  Does anyone seriously think if any small market team had the run the lakers did from 2013-2018 they would get rewarded with Lebron James wanting to join that team?   Milwaukee just won a title and are not getting the same caliber of ring chasers
"The Lakers will always attract players, but this is more about the opportunity of playing with Lebron James and AD which = contending. Big markets will always have an advantage but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a lot more amplified when said team is in the playoffs/a contender."

Lebron James 2011 finals.
"LeBron James has been the best player in the league for like 15+ years and he wasn't a good jumpshooter for most of his career up until the last couple years where he developed a decent fadeaway midrange and pull up 3pt shot. He still isn't an elite jumpshooter, just average for a primary offensive player. Actually when LeBron was the same age as Giannis is now, he shot like 37% from the midrange during the playoffs.   So I don't think you need to be that ""prototypical"" jumpshooter player to be the best in the league. Although if Giannis does develop a decent midrange and 3pt game like LeBron, that would really help his playoff runs in the future."
"That's revisionist history, Gasol, LeBron and Duncan all had reasonable claims to the award--there wasn't a standout candidate that season. Here's a copy/pasted comment I made comparing some of the top DPOY candidates from that season  I think that there is easily room for debate in 2013:  Player | Team DRtg | Player DRtg | DBPM | DWS | BLK+STL | D RAPTOR ------|---------|-----------|----|---|-------|-------- Marc Gasol | **101.2** (2nd/30) | 98 (Net -3.2) | 3.1 | **5.4** | 2.0 | 4.37 Tim Duncan | 102.3 (3rd/30) | **95** (Net -7.3) | 2.9 | 4.9 | **3.4** | **4.41** LeBron James | 104.8 (9th/30) | 101 (Net -3.8) | **4.7** | 2.4 | 2.6 | 1.09 Tony Allen | **101.2** (2nd/30) | 98 (Net -3.2) | 2.4 | 4.1 | 2.1 | 3.39 Joakim Noah | 103.9 (6th/30) | 99 (Net -4.9) | **4.7** | 2.7 | 3.3 | 3.97  In summary: Gasol/Allen had the best defensive team surrounding them (the fact that they were both starters on the same team obviously contributed to that) of the five, Duncan had the best positive impact on his team's defensive rating by a strong margin, LeBron and Noah had the best Defensive Box +/-, Gasol had the most Defensive Win Shares, Duncan had the most STOCKS, and Duncan had the best Defensive RAPTOR (which of course wasn't even invented then, but is helpful to use when looking back on things now). Duncan takes 3/6 categories, Gasol takes 2/6 and LeBron, Allen and Noah take 1/6 each.  LeBron ""deserving"" that DPOY is overblown when the voting wasn't particularly close back then, and stating that he was guarding all 5 positions that season is a bit disingenuous when he was getting destroyed in the post by the not-yet-desiccated-corpse of Roy Hibbert in the postseason."
"Let's compare another great passer from the same era as jokic so that we can maintain c.e to a better degree than a cross era comparison. Hell lets do it with apg considering you love the stat so much (I don't think it defines whose the better passer but lets use it as a heuristic for now to simplify the conversation).   James Harden has a 30.4% career usage rate, with a 6.5 apg. His MVP year he had a 35.9% usage rate while having 8.8 apg.  Jokic has a 25.5% career usage rate with a 6.0 apg.  This year he had a 29.5% usage rate while having 8.3 apg.  Lebron has a 31.5% career usage rate with a 7.4 apg.  His last mvp year he had a 30.1 usage on 7.3 apg.   Russell Westbrook has a 32.5% usage rate with a 8.5 apg.  His MVP season he had a 41.5% usage rate with 10.4 apg.   I'll never understand people who have a superiority complex and just assume others ignore data all because said person might not put weight on the same data points as they do."
Lebron James
"I had to come way down here to find this. I just feel like Dame is not that guy. He's an amazing piece, but he's not going to carry you by himself. It's the same reason I never crapped on DeMar for coming up short for Toronto. DeMar is designed to thrive as your second best player. He's not designed to carry you by LeBron goddamn James."
"Its shame that Lebron didnt get dpoy in 2013? I guess for snowflakes is really tough to understand that Gasol deserved that dpoy over James. Gasol was vocal point in defense in those grit and grind Grizzles teams. The main difference between James and Gasol in defense, in that 2013 season is the way that opponent team completely change their attack when Gasol is in the game. He was command force in post that year. He got 1.7 blocks and 1 steal to go with it. James was better 1 on 1 defender, and dominant one. But to say that Gasol didnt deserve the reward, its just fallacy."

I guess... be LeBron James? It's not a slight to KD that people would take a GOAT candidate over him.
"yeah, most top players tend to go with their first name or a nickname, except a few. For example:  Lebron James: we just call him lebron, never heard him called by his last name alone unless its by a commentator   Giannis Antetokounmpo: we call him giannis, and the same applies for him  Kevin Durant: we call him mainly KD, followed by durant or kevin durant, but mostly KD  Steph curry: we call him steph, and we also call him curry, but I feel like I personally use steph for, around others who know ball  James Harden: Usually just harden or james harden  Anthony Davis: I think most people in real life and online mostly refer to him as AD, and ocasionally by his full name  Kawhi leonard: literally Kawhi, never heard him called by his last name alone unless its by a commentator   Luka Doncic: Luka, Doncic, and Luka Doncic are all common, but I use Luka the most  Kyrie Irving: simply kyrie  Carmelo anthony: I think I've only referred to him as melo  Paul George: PG, PG13, or Paul George, never Paul or George  This can go on and on, but a LOT of guys are referred to their first names, even the likes of Klay, Russ, Draymond, etc"
"According to a thread earlier today he isn‚Äôt even better than James Harden. I think he is the second best shooting guard of all time no debate. I personally have him at #2 after Jordan and I would draft him over Lebron so I know I have a heavy bias. He was my favorite player and was the player after Jordan and before Lebron. I‚Äôd also draft Curry over Lebron though, so my opinion is shit lol"
"Well... one one hand, LeBron just suffered a fairly serious injury, the second serious injury in the past 3 seasons, will be 37 this upcoming season and did not look like himself in that Suns series due to coming off the injury....  But on the other hand, its LeBron fucking James, and you'd have to be an idiot to doubt him."

"I know you‚Äôll disagree with this, but he‚Äôs been an MVP candidate because of narrative only the last few years. Anytime you see the voters talking about him and his chances they always have to add the qualifier of his age and the number of years he‚Äôs been in the league.  ‚ÄúLebron James in year 17 at 35 years old is doing x, y, and z!‚Äù  Meanwhile arguments for Jokic or Giannis are ‚Äúthese are the stats, they‚Äôre the best on the court every game, etc‚Äù  And my point of bringing up 2016 is because that was his peak IMO. That was the start of the decline. He played 82 games that season for the first time in his career. His MPG dropped off after that. His 2pt%, 3pt%, and FT% dropped off after that. REB, STL, BLK, and PPG. Those are all statistically true. I‚Äôd argue his defense has gotten worse not necessarily because he can‚Äôt but because of a lack of effort. And obviously his 2 biggest injuries happened after 2016. A younger lebron probably would have walked those off, but his body isn‚Äôt letting him anymore. Idk how that‚Äôs a controversial take lol."
"I think he would have a strong case.   Unlike Jordan, he would title with more less two different rosters.   I think his teams was less talented then the Bulls, Kobe‚Äôs Lakers or any of LeBron championship teams.   He was a force at both ends and showed up in big games.   He would have a strong case and really he does anyway. I think he has a stronger resume then James or Kobe."

"Because fouls don't get called all the time, especially when it's a superstar. Especially when it's LeBron. For the same exact way that James Harden is going to get way more foul calls than Alex Caruso, the same tends to happen on defense.     This is not a unique situation nor something that I thought would have to be explained or wouldn't be understood by anyone who has watched the NBA for even just a couple of years.      If you genuinely don't see the fouls then I'd be glad to highlight them for you, but I honestly do not believe any basketball fan could watch that and not see that unless they are blinded by the player who is involved in the play."
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not writing home.‚Äù  LeBron James
"Lebron James. I hate myself for suggesting this, but that would be an unstoppable duo."
"Imagine thinking the nba can be dumbed down to ‚Äúone non shooter, offense can‚Äôt score‚Äù.    Spacing has to be the number one most overused and overrated term for causal and ignorant fans. Did lebron James struggle to score at the rim sharing the floor with javale and dwight? Did rondo ruin spacing in 2020? How did the cavs function with fucking TT on the floor then? He sure as hell can‚Äôt space the floor.   You know what‚Äôs going to happen to Westbrook‚Äôs defender when lebron and AD drive? Not a damn thing because it‚Äôll likely be someone like kyrie and they aren‚Äôt doing shit to slow down a lebron/AD pick and roll. And if the nets are dumb enough to put a big on Westbrook he will blow by them constantly"
Tbh the ‚Äúwe got a squad‚Äù shit is exactly the type of corniness I‚Äôd expect from a LeBron James team
tbf LeBron missed almost no significant time for the first 13 plus years of his career. Now James and KD are hitting that stage of their careers. Can't really compare a mid 20s early 30s Harden to a mid-late 30s Lebron in terms of health. Pretty dishonest and misleading imo.
"As a Lakers fan all I can think when other teams say ""Lakers must be scared to face PG/Kawhi or KD/Kyrie all I can think is, hello? Isn't the other team scared to face LeBron fucking James and Anthony fucking Davis??? People on here hate the Lakers and LeBron so much they are almost saying their best rec team would beat them cos reasons."
Harden apparently has played more games than any other all star in the past decade with I think Lebron being #2. It's like Jordan who went out gambling at 4 am a night before a game and still dropped 30-40 points. James Harden is similar in that regard.
"Russell Westbrook, Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Dennis Schroeder, Marc Gasol"
"While I agree and fully understand how great LeBron is....keep in mind that Father Time always wins.   Even for a freak of nature like James, he is going to start slowing down at some point. Will that be this year...or next year....or five years?  No one knows, but it's going to happen and he is already showing signs of it.  Don't get me wrong...Lakers are still contenders until they prove themselves not to be. But Duncan also seemed ageless...until he wasn't anymore."
Yeah you absolutely could‚Äôve predicted cp3 would be better than Russ after2019. Most of this sub predicted that. So no I don‚Äôt agree with your statements. Chris Paul and James harden is such a good pairing they could‚Äôve won in the bubble too. They would‚Äôve given the lakers a serious run for their money and I say that as a lebron fan
"ESPN: [Ariana Grande] God is a woman, is Lebron James God?  ESPN: What is a God to a King? Lebron in crisis  ESPN: Is Kanye West Lebron‚Äôs dad?  ESPN: Would Kanye Lebron and kyrie be the greatest father, son, grandson trio in the league?"
It is lol. Every game is a legacy game for LeBron James. At least that‚Äôs how it feels.  This example tho was in large part due to his own failure in the finals the year before tho
ESPN: LeBron James is a woman.
LOL just looked. Lebron James 11 mpg. Stephon Marbury 26 mpg. They lost.
"They had a top 3 defense and top 12 offense with Lebron James and AD, they were insanely formidable, also the fact that they never blew a 4th quarter lead means you HAD to win after 3 or you‚Äôre fucked."
Cade just needs to stfu! Evidently  He doesn't know basketball he just plays basketball! if he thinks that Lebron James is the goat after looking at Michael Jordan he truly is lost...
No because he didn‚Äôt really play much prime minutes like Dwight and most of the time our lineups had to run smaller especially with golden state and Houston and etc. while they held their own in the paint it‚Äôs literally a turnover trying to get them to shoot 3s when you have lebron James markieff who was on fire when he came kcp who got hit around the playoffs and theoretically Danny red on the off chance he knows what a 3 pointer is that day.
"The Warriors were the league's golden boys and the league could not fathom the ratings loss if they didn't make the Finals. The casual fan interest in the Warriors in being an ""unbeatable"" team was simply too high to let things happen naturally. The Rockets should have won that series. The only player capable of overcoming such a tremendous league bias for the Warriors was LeBron Fucking James in 2016. But he is pretty much the only player in the world Adam Silver was OK with getting one over his personal viagra, the Warriors."

"Even if they win he will make it harder not easier. LAL could have won last year with Trez and Drummond, doesn't mean they were good moves.  Also interesting how you can't argue any more and just resort to blind hope. Westbrook was surrounded by shooters in Houston and he still sucked. They didn't have a single center PJ Tucker in the corner 3 was their center. You're also ignoring the sacrifices James and Davis will have to make trying to play with Russ. You like things being harder for them? LAL's terrible spacing has forced Lebron to be a 3 point shooter for years, and now they've done it to Davis too."
"Due to the makeup of this sub, you could put any healthy Steph Curry or LeBron James championship team and this sub would take em over last years Bucks. Milwaukee won‚Äôt ever get that type of respect lol"
The team with healthy LeBron James
"&gt; Nobody is saying KD is dumb or a bad person for going there, everyone talks as a fan of the game.  This might be the dumbest thing you've written yet.  The lion's share of anger towards KD joining the Warriors is driven by people being a 'fan of the game' and not fans of the Thunder, fans of other contending teams, or fans of LeBron James in particular.  You have a ton of comments in this very thread talking about how what KD did is fundamentally different than what LeBron did with the Heat.  So forgive me if I think your quote there is just self-serving bullshit.  &gt; If you can‚Äôt see that, then you‚Äôre just a blind Stan.  I mean this is pretty ironic given the above as well.  But in point of fact I don't particularly like KD and think he's a pretty weird guy with a decent amount of issues to unpack.  But he played for the franchise he got drafted to in a shitty market for 9 years, didn't force his way out, didn't collude with a bunch of free agents to build a superteam, he just went to the best available destination in his free agency year.  There is literally nothing objectionable here unless you believe that he's somehow obligated to pick a shittier situation for your viewing enjoyment."
There is plenty of data out there supporting Lebron James winning MVP that season.
"Giving the award to the best offensive player on a team winning games through their defense is a recipe for a bad MVP reward. As it was in this case. It should have been given to the guy generating the most value for his team, Lebron James. But people were mad he ran out of Cleveland so they didn't vote for him."
"My take is that the way max contracts work in the NBA indirectly causes tanking. Everyone wants to tank for the next Lebron James because you can afford Lebron for only marginally more than Khris Middleton. Superstars become mandatory because by definition a superstar on a max contract is a steal. How much would Lebron get per year if there was no max contract? 80 million? 100 million?   If you had to pay superstars what they were worth, they would become a lot less important to a championship caliber team. Teams would have to choose between playing Lebron 80 million a year vs two perennial all-stars for 40 million a piece, for example. You'd see stars going to teams for the money, rather than the desirability of the destination, and it would be a lot easier for a team with cap space to snag a player from another team that's cash strapped, as you see in the NFL and MLB. As a result, getting the number one pick wouldn't be nearly as valuable, because there's a good chance you couldn't afford that player once they hit their payday. Instead the route to becoming a contender would be about managing contracts and finding undervalued players, again, similar to the NFL and MLB."

Imagine Lebron James at 37 being the most durable guy on your team
"&gt;I have read many posts on this sub about how players would adapt to the modern game if suddenly just dropped in.  The idea of adaption probably applies to almost every sport. To some degree, athletes of a given era can only work with what they know. Then usually someone nudges the game forward a little bit, then the next generation takes that and adds a little more, until finally you end up with the modern game.   A pretty big example would be the Euro-step. You'll see random clips of Archie Clark, Julius Erving, and ≈†ar≈´nas Marƒçiulionis pulling off their own derivations, sometimes seemingly accidentally (more like a side step). But over the past 20 years it's become ingrained in basketball as a pretty basic maneuver.   So the question there would be, do I think a guy like James Worthy, if transported to today's game, could pick up relatively quickly on the Euro-step and learn to implement it into his game? And when you're talking relatively recent NBA history (say, post-merger), I think the answer to that question is oftentimes going to be yes.   Generally speaking, when discussing most modern, post-merger NBA basketball, I think a lot of people sell a player's ability to adapt quite short. To go the other way, I swear 70 percent of the comments on some Bad Boys Pistons videos are something along the lines of ""lehBRon wud CRY in this era"". Rather, I think there's a safer bet that LeBron (and others from the modern game) would simply adapt. It's what basketball players on all levels already do, depending upon whether they're playing in the street, open gym, 3-on-3, high school, college, FIBA, or the NBA.   As it pertains to the wide open nature of today's offenses, yeah, I think that'd be a great opportunity for any number of amazing players in recent history who had to slog through the hand-checking, clogged paint, possession-control era. Tracy McGrady in today's game would have probably thought he'd died and gone to heaven."

"Nobody seems to appreciate what an incredible player Wilt was,"" Russell said at 1997 All-Star Game when the league named and honored its 50 greatest players. ""He was the best player of all time because he dominated the floor like nobody else ever could. To be that big and that athletic was special.""  ""You obviously never saw Wilt Chamberlain play who undoubtedly was the greatest scorer this game has ever known.   When did MJ ever average 50.4 points per game plus 25.7 rebounds? (Wilt in the 1962 season when blocked shot statistics were not kept). We will never accurately know how many shots Wilt blocked. Oh, by the way in 1967 and 68, Wilt was a league leader in assists.   Did MJ ever score 100 points in a game? How many times did MJ score more than 60 points in a game? MJ led the league in scoring in consecutive seasons for 10 years but he did this in an NBA that eventually expanded into 30 teams vs. when Wilt played and there were only 8 teams.""  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in an open letter to Scottie Pippen after Scottie Pippen referred to Michael Jordan and Lebron James as the greatest scorer and greatest player, respectively   Larry Bird..   When the topic of all-time greatest player was once raised, none other than the legendary Larry Bird didn't hesitate.   ""Open up the record book and it will be obvious who the greatest is,"" he said.   Rick Barry..  If you could have one player to start a team with , who would you take?

I think Cade not right because Michael and LeBron played in different erras. So we possibly can‚Äôt even compare them. But if I needed to take a pick my pick would be LeBron James the G.O.A.T
"Damn, I can‚Äôt believe I was alive to witness the LeBron James and the Kristaps Porzingis era, truly something special"
Who's James? The man's called LeBron
LeBron has James Jones in his back pocket now to do him favors as suns GM
&gt; Don‚Äôt think lebron will let westbrook bring the ball up the court in possession like this  Did you by chance watch what the Lakers did to James Harden when he brought the ball up in the season Russ was in Houston?
"No celebrity in all of existence has been under more pressure or scrutinized more then Lebron James. It‚Äôs not even close. He came from literally nothing, his mom was 16 and a high school drop out. He has been the subject of potential GOAT debates since probably before he could legally DRIVE A CAR, and his worse quality is he‚Äôs not the most humble. Fuck outta here, Jordan was a psychopathic asshole with a severe gambling addiction who got his father killed and assaulted a teammate."
James Harden &gt; LeBron right now
Not true LeBron loved James Jones and Mike Miller and he brought them with him to Cleveland
"Bro it‚Äôs absolutely hindsight. It‚Äôs all speculation. Guy had never played an NBA game up to that point. Saying you *knew* he‚Äôd be great is sus. Tyler Hansbrough and Doug Mcdermott are some of the greatest college players of all time, imagine someone saying they ‚Äúknow‚Äù this player will be great.   I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more but the only player I can possibly think of where most people *knew* they‚Äôd be great before they played in the NBA is Lebron James."
"My favorite part : ‚Äúi‚Äôm not even going to discuss lebron because its just disprespectful to put lebron james and stephen curry in the same sentence.‚Äù  10 years later, it‚Äôs all anybody was talking about"
&gt;i‚Äôm not even going to discuss lebron because its just disprespectful to put lebron james and stephen curry in the same sentence  This and the franchise savior guy time traveled from the future to be wrong as precisely as they could be.  Can't even discuss LeBron or Steph's careers without discussing their finals records vs each other.
"Sounds like you're jealous. He's a kid who's brain hasn't fully developed and he thinks speaking ebonics makes him look cool. Lebron James, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Tracy McGrady all had the same amount of education as this kid yet none of them sound like your poor prediction."

"You have to prepare yourself for this, Westbrook has taken more shots in series than Kevin Durant, James Harden, Paul George despite them being superior efficient scorers and having  better scoring series   It's gonna be hilarious when he outshoots AD and LeBron going 3/17 while they go 6/10, i will laugh my ass off"

"Lebron James. If you have to call yourself the GOAT, you ain't the GOAT."
"While that is true, the finals rematch for the past couple of years is usually a skate between two of the larger market teams (or in the case of Cleveland, Lebron James). No offense to them, but i doubt the nba would slate Phoenix to play on Christmas. If I had to guess the shoe ins would be us, GS, Milwaukee, Brooklyn, ny and maybe Atlanta since they just played."
"I'm conflicted - the lineup data with Simmons does indicate his value as an elite transition player with playmaking and strong isolation defense.  He also should improve over the next 4 seasons, given a standard development curve.  RPM data also puts him in the top 20 players, winshares, plus/minus, is all very similar.  On the other end, I have characterized him as a borderline all star before, which really means I can't figure out what he is or how impactful he is within the context of a championship offense.  The error bars on his actual value is the highest Ive seen in awhile.  We falsely characterized the 2011 heat mavericks finals as a breakdown on the part of lebron, when really it was at least 50% about the mavericks unusual zone lineup adjustments that didn't really have a counter until 5 out offenses became more predominant later in the 2010s.  Even then, it is clear that series might have played out differently if it was a best of 15 rather than best of 7.  I don't know what the fuck happened with Simmons during the hawks series.  You can point to individual plays, but the number of shots, his inability to be coached to throw the ball at the rim if he is within 5 feet and to see what happens, and the lack of any form of shot development is really odd.  Is he really just living off natural potential and is lazy off the floor?  Does he have an undiagnosed, untreated anxiety disorder and we are bashing him inappropriately?  Is Doc Rivers a toxic coach? Im not sure anymore.  What I do know is most casual fans are severely underrating him right now.  He is significantly more valuable than Jrue Holiday.  He is less of a player than James Harden, but he is much younger and locked into a contract he cannot escape from.  But I also don't know where he can go, because a player like Simmons shouldn't go to a rebuilding team in the modern era, because he does have championship equity...  And his hypothetical fit, even if the lineup data doesn't always agree, means he needs to go to a team with elite shooting.  The most obvious fit however, the warriors, already has Draymond Green and its extremely unclear whether these two players could play cooperatively next to each other or if their skill sets are not additive.  Basically the Simmons hate may or may not be warranted, but a player can't just move on when he feels like it when under a massive contract and the team he is on cant get something in return."
"Yes, Giannis is clearly ‚Äúmuch better‚Äù than LeBron James and Anthony Davis."
"I did not go to business school. You know who else didn't go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA so... So, it's not the same thing at all."
"Uhhh LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook?"
"This is a really interesting question, because AD is an absolutely perfect fit with Harden and that Nets roster. AD is huge help with Giannis and Embiid. It's like the Rockets only AD is super-Capela and Kyrie is super-Gordon.  I think you have to bet on the talent of KD and Bron, but you lose the best interior defender in the league imo and you try and fit KD in to the Lebron offense w/Westbrook and I that has some legitimate questions about how it would work. Lebron's so smart that I'm sure he'd figure it out and understand just the right amount to defer. But interior defense is an issue.  But frankly you can't bet on James Harden to win against Lebron."
KD and LeBron are two of the best game 7 performers e v e r and the Nets' best player is James Harden who shoots like 41% from the field and 30% from 3 in elimination games  It's no contest imo if we're assuming LeBron is back to pre-injury form
The team with LeBron James and Kevin Durant
"Giannis Overrated  Since one of yo giannis fanboys want to delete my post I‚Äôm gonna repost it.  Giannis has no skill whatsoever  - He can‚Äôt dribble   - He can‚Äôt Shoot  - He has no IQ (decides to take a fadeaway on JAMES HARDEN)  -Overrated defense he‚Äôs regarded as an all nba 1st team defender yet was scared to guard kd and he has no permitter defense average at best he only has decent post defense   -He‚Äôs not clutch every time the game is on the line guess who gets the ball not Giannis MIDDLETON because giannis is not to trust in the clutch  Now let me get on with this overrated ring he got.  -the whole western conference was injured they played the worst team   -would of lost to the nets   -claims he doesn‚Äôt have a super team(great team) yet bucks beat hawks without him   - kd by himself took them to 7 games   - choked last year, only reason there doing so good this year is because injuries and the addition of jrue holiday was major to there success   - jrue holiday and Middleton don‚Äôt get enough credit the media acts as if giannis carried them, if giannis is not showing up Middleton drops 30 and they jrue holiday to lock up the other team guard like he did with booker  - all the times dropped over 35 he averages 17 free throw attempts   - he was dropping big numbers on one of the worst defensive team in the suns which is why against the heat he only averaged 24 against the heat  -he averages over than half the amount of the suns highest ft player with 85 attempts   -the idea over the casuals is that the bucks team wasn‚Äôt good and Giannis carried them they have jrue holiday, Middleton, brook lopez who saved them with the block on kd, and they got Bobby portis nowhere near a bad team actually a great team  -lost 2 games to a overrated suns team   - both his mvp he got were undeserved harden should of got it then Lebron   -Giannis also averaging the most free throw attempts in a series since Dwade in the 2006 FINALS.    Stop being bias and look at the facts when you put it into context you see how unimpressive it looks."
I don't care how much media knowledge he has or whatever you're getting at. Saying Lebron James has a bad work ethic while you're only a trainer (of a sub par player) is ducking dumb. Period.
Lebron James arch nemesis
"Idk man Lebron in ‚Äò15, was pretty unstoppable in that series having games of 44, 39, 40, 40, and 32 while leading both teams in PPG, RPG, and APG. Just sucks for James his 2nd best player was Moz or delly. He was the only threat for the Cavs and the Warriors still couldn‚Äôt stop him."
LeBron James is also kind of like Larry Bird but more athletic if you want someone else similar. Same level of bball IQ and feel for the game but with a 40 inch vert.
BREAKING NEWS: LEBRON JAMES FAILS MATH QUIZ    more at 11    back to you Skip
I wasn't around to see 2009 LeBron or rookie Durant and Westbrook but this doesn't seem as insane as it sounds if you're trading for literally the best player in the league.   Of course with what we know nowadays trading KD *and* Westbrook might have been too much.   But that also means you pair LeBron with a Rookie James Harden just saying.
"Players can have weaknesses but some don‚Äôt. If Lebron James can shoot 34% from 3 for his career, I can guarantee you MJ would‚Äôve shot better lol"
"I think this one will be overrated just because of the names you can bring up that he beat..   Beats LaMarcus Aldridge and Brandon Roy in the first round   Beats Defending champions Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol in the second round   Beats Durant Westbrook and JAMES HARDEN (who wasnt really james harden yet but that will get lost in time) in the WCF   Then does step up and beats Lebron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in the finals..     Thats 8 HOF Locks and two Solid names on portland."
"&gt;Hey what was the record of the 2010 heat? was it 73-9, the best record of all time? oh oops looks like they won 26 less games actually  It's almost like you're arguing without any good faith.  Bosh, Wade and James all joined up to form a superteam - the ""record before those three got there"" is almost idiotic to mention since they're forming the superteam by *coming together*.  &gt;Really weird, seems a lot different actually  Sure if you're actually not arguing in any good faith.  Again, you can take *LeBron James'* own words wherein he was so confident about his stacking that he proclaimed it's ""gonna be easy"" and they might win 8 championships."
"He actually did hold his own against NBA players as a 16 year old sophomore.  &gt;He talked about crying when Jordan retired in 1993 as a nine-year-old who idolized MJ, and then recalled being a 16-year-old sophomore phenom who ended up in a pickup game with Jordan, Antoine Walker, Jerry Stackhouse, Paul Pierce, Penny Hardaway, and a number of the baby Bulls in the early 2000s.

Lebron James. Known back then to choke in the clutch.
The GOAT LeBron James.
"Ohhhh that dude? Taking Lebron over him no doubt. Sengun won MVP of the Turkish league and he went pick 18. Other Euroleague MVP‚Äôs are Nemanja Bjelica and Nando de Colo. Winning euro league MVP doesn‚Äôt make you the best prospect of all time. James‚Äô size, athleticism, mind, and skill is still gonna be miles ahead of Luka."
This question definitely came from someone who didnt see the unbelievable hype that was LeBron James as a high school senior.
Probably LeBron James Sr.

"If Tim Duncan and KD were in the same draft. Tim Duncan would get picked #1 in 100 out of 100 mock drafts. If KD had all his career earnings on line and had to choose between himself and TD, he would choose TD. The only ones in history who would get chosen definitively over TD in all of NBA/ ABA history are Michael Jordan, Lebron James and Bill Russell ( maybe Kareem)"
"Can someone take his phone away? I‚Äôve been a fan since day 1 and it‚Äôs rough. Bron fans been through some shit. So much slander. I feel nothing at this point, just dead and hollow inside.

Did you know that LeBron James won against the 73-9 Warriors in 2016 **without any all-star teammates?**
"By that rationale, 99% of the league need to renounce their citizenship, take ancestry tests and take their talents to countries in Africa...  LeBron James on the Ugandan national team. Who says no?"
For talking basketball like an idiot.   Talking about how Bazemore is bad at contested 3s when the guy said all he‚Äôll shoot is open 3s  talking about how Dwight shouldn‚Äôt be shooting 3s when the dude was clearly talking about his overall play  For saying Russ doesn‚Äôt get shooters open   for saying Bazemore doesn‚Äôt have to goat shooter to get him open looks when Lebron James is probably the best player in history at getting teammates open 3s‚Ä¶  For even acting like Kent Bazemore matters on this Laker team‚Ä¶

Lebron James got out scored by Jason Terry my dude. He averaged 18 ppg. Let that sink in for you before you write a whole life story nobody wants to read. That shit never happened to Jordan.   Jordan got 6-0. Two 3-0‚Äôs. He was the best player on all of those teams. More MVPs (5). More FMVPs. And a DPOY. More 1st TEAM Defense selections (9 to be exact &amp; 4 more than Lebron). He STILL has the record for most points scored in a playoff game. Still hasn‚Äôt been broken in 35 years.   Tell me you‚Äôre butthurt about Lebron not being better than Jordan without telling me. Just comparing their careers objectively with individual accolades alone tells you Jordan is better lol.

"You‚Äôre talking about 1 season‚Ä¶ the dude played most of the minutes, for most of the games, for most of the seasons of his entire career. That alone is a feat when someone like Lebron James has only played 82 games once in his entire career. Yet Lebron‚Äôs longevity and durability is supposedly better than anyone else ever.   I also never said he was the greatest scorer ever so I‚Äôm not sure why you even bring that up.  What you say is stupid though. Sure if you want to talk about a players play style contributing to team success, go ahead. But  scoring itself can and should be considered as an individual ability separate from team success. 2 points is 2 points whether your team wins or loses the game."
"Lebron James! I used to hate on him all the time, blamed him for every problem that his teams had. But today I genuinely respect him for all that he has accomplished in the NBA, and also his life outside of sports.   He is a family man that has never been in trouble, which is pretty rare given his upbringing."
"On any given play a player could be anyone of the three,also this pretty much only happens during half court situations,because positions definitely don‚Äôt matter during transition.  If Jokic sets up in the high post,he‚Äôs a post player at that point in time,if he gets a rebound and brings it down the court,he‚Äôs a ball handler(I‚Äôll add that ball handler isn‚Äôt a great term,because if the reasons you pointed out,a better term would be initiator). If Jokic for some reason spots up in the corner,like if a transition opportunity breaks down and if he finds himself open in the corner,he would be a wing. Also most of the time Jokic operates in the post,whether that‚Äôs the high post or out of a screen and move set.  Other examples of players that fit into all three are KD,LeBron,Kobe,and a lot of others.  Many of the all time greats can do all of them,because that‚Äôs what makes them all time greats.  Also an easy way of finding out what they would be referred to as(like if it were to replace the 1-5 classifications) in my weird way of positions:  Point Guard:99% of the time would be a ball handler/initiator  Shooting Guard:either a ball handler or a wing. James Harden and CJ McCollum are ball handlers,Klay Thompson is a wing  Small Forward:Could feasibly be all of them,like KD and LeBron  Power forward:Wing or post,Marcus Morris is a wing,Anthony Davis is a post player  Center:99% of the time would be classified as a post player"
"LeBron James. You can run, you can shout, but at the end of the day you can never deny pure greatness."
So is playing LeBron James the ultimate accomplishment or something? Not sure where you're getting at..
LeBron James
"Westbrook his own teammate was the main reason they even took a 3-1 lead. They had an elite defense with a rebounding advantage as well. Durant choked plain and simple and didn‚Äôt show up in the final 3 games   &gt;he was the best player on the court  Curry was a back to back mvp and just led the best regular season team ever.    &gt;best player in the world    Maybe in a world where lebron James and curry don‚Äôt exist you can call Durant the best player in the world. But not this one    You‚Äôre a clown because your takes are fucking stupid and contradict each other. You also can‚Äôt get the point that even if those players are the better players on the floor they get shit on for losing, they don‚Äôt get excuses."
"I hate to say it ... but Lebron James ... i mean, is not that i like him now but i do respect him a lot more than before. I don't know if i will like him once he retires, specially because i still hate how he keeps building super teams and then brag about his ""legacy"" ... but yeah, is kind of dumb to not see how great of a player he really is and how important for the game he has been."
Yeah i remember how Cleveland downtown businesses were booming because of the cavs having lebron james
"Can name a few   LeBron James, I hated all the hype he got in his early career. Was an avid Carmelo Anthony fan and thought he would be better. I definitely grew to love watching LeBron play.   Kobe Bryant. Allen Iverson is my favorite all time player, so that was a big influence in me disliking kobe. I did grow to love watching him play, and grew to love him as a person. RIP  Jimmy Butler. For a while I thought he was an asshole but he definitely is just committed to winning. Have to respect someone who gives their all trying to win with whatever team he is on."
Lebron James.
"LeBron James. Dude was an egotistical clown early on (which is somewhat understandable - young millionaire and all) and it‚Äôs only later in his career that I see him as a real leader and part of a team. People hate him viciously nowadays, and I‚Äôm not 100% sure why, but for me, he‚Äôs a legendary player, legendary leader and a pretty solid person. Glad I‚Äôve come around - wasn‚Äôt fun being the only dude who didn‚Äôt like LBJ, ha."
"The only player i genuinelly didn't like and rooted against my whole life, until the 2018 playoffs.  LeBron James.  I grew up in the Kobe v Bron era, and as a kid developed a ""root against"" attitude (not hate, i don't know how else to describe it) towards him, and rooted against him everywhere he went, i am even ashamed to say i was with the Warriors in 2017 (mostly cuz of Steph, but Bron being on the Cavs doesn't help) and obviously in 2016 as well.  I just didn't like him, what can i say.  But then, 2018 happened, when he absolutely carried that weird Cavs squad to the Finals, and he forced me to root for him, and like him, actually, like he kinda won me over, you know.  And boom, literally a month after that he signs here, it was surreal timing.  I'm not a Bron stan but i am like a step below that, i am a fan of his, now."
"Lebron James existed, AD wasn‚Äôt even the best player on his team lol"
"I went from really liking LeBron James in his younger years, to greatly disliking him as he got older (not because of the move to Miami). Then when he brought a title back to Cleveland it put me back on his team for a couple of years. Now that is on the Lakers I fucking hate him."
"I‚Äôve hated Lebron James just the narrative around him they expected him to the most and he was the guy. I started watching basketball in 2014 so I didn‚Äôt understand the hype as much but seeing him at 36/37 and still playing at an elite level, nothing but respect"
"I'm not idealising, I'm generalizing. That should have been obvious when I said:  &gt;If the traditional ""PG/SG/SF/PF/C"" position model is going to be useful at all, it has to be a short hand for defensive lineups and match ups.  One thing we can all hopefully agree with is that positions are always going to be pretty fluid. Unlike other sports that have rules limiting what you can do based on listed position or starting placement, basketball has always been a game that allows any combination of 5 players, with each player having the potential to do any legal action. Therefore, *any* definition we give for a position will inevitably have exceptions as teams find a way to gain an advantage by breaking convention.  This is why I said this:  &gt;not just who you guard, but who guards you best as well  You can't look at either to determine position, you need both. Lillard isn't a forward because he lacks the size to guard forwards. Bridges has the size and speed to guard point guards, but he's defended primarily by wings. This is the *only* system that actually communicates *any* useful information by giving a general idea of which physical profile a player falls in while still mostly matching how people use the terms. I've already demonstrated how completely useless offensive roles are for determining position with the Lillard/Harden/Lebron example, your system only gets worse the more you consider other roles and positions. James Harden and Tony Allen played the same position, enough said."
"Too much love: Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, Bradley Beal, Zion, Paul George, Tobias Harris  Too much hate: KAT, James Wiseman, Myles Turner, Porzingis, Lauri Markkanen, Kyle Kuzma, pretty much any role player that Lakers/Lebron fans want to throw under the bus whenever the team isn‚Äôt playing well."
A Raptors fan would know LeBron James.
Seattle and Las Vegas will have teams.   Lebron James III will be in the league.   Players will take games off for mental health.

&gt;the media would never vote for lebron  Do you know who LeBron James is?
"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass."
"That wouldn't make sense though. Jazz would sooner put Royce O'Neal or Rudy Gay on Davis and let AD light them up for 36/10/5 than cede a huge scoring advantage to Lebron and Russ. There's very little you can do to slow down Anthony Davis and Lebron James, so you used the same strategy the Bucks used on KD this year and numerous teams used on Harden on the Rockets: make the stars work hard for their points, and focus on locking down the less reliable and more containable supporting cast."
Counterpoint: Is Royce Oneal supposed to stop LeBron James? Or do you expect Bojan to slow down AD?
[Not according to the NBA when they measured everyone a few years back.](https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/2019/10/21/lebron-james-officially-measured-at-68-5-thanks-to-new-nba-rules/)  6'8 and a half without shoes.
Ig Rondo is irrelevant with James/Russ. That shooting is still gonna be crap as prime Lebron shot from 3 less than he does now.
"Yes you are wild for thinking that. Luka will get better as a player but there is only so much better those box score stats can realistically get    I think the true evolutions he makes to his game will be things like his defense, making a higher percentage of threes and extending his range further. He could add more variety to his mid range and maybe even post game even though he is already pretty good at both.   He‚Äôs just gonna learn to be a better two way player and a more efficient superstar.    Lebron James was a way better between 2013-2018 than he was between 2005-2010 but he didn‚Äôt improve statistically that much. Same thing applies to Kevin Durant, Michael Jordan, etc  Guys who come into the league and become MVP caliber players at 20-21 years old rarely ever end up improving their raw box score stats that much."

Did you miss this part   &gt;It supports his Lebron James&gt;&gt;&gt; Jordan argument
I think it‚Äôs absolutely insane to contribute all of that to Wilt when in fact there was an entire league of players and teams. That‚Äôs like looking at the amount of game tickets sold in 2002 vs. now and saying that it is all due to LeBron James and nobody else.
"For the majority of his career he was at or slightly below league average efficiency, but with much greater volume. His efficiency should rise back up given the decrease in his volume as the 3rd option, that's not a hot take.  He's been an average defender for the majority of his career, but Vogel is the first defensive-minded coach he'll be under, and their def are competent defenders on the Lakers, so I expect him to be at worst average defensively. That's not even accounting for the reduced usage which will allow him to expend more energy on that end.  This last point is the most valid concern, and that'll hinge on AD's shooting while also playing at the 5 for crucial matchups ([which is something they already apparently agreed upon](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/7/30/22601457/anthony-davis-told-russell-westbrook-hed-play-center-more-make-trade-work-lebron-james-lakers)).   But LeBron's shooting has been underrated, he shot 36.5% on 6 3s per game, and that increased to 37.5% on 8 in the playoffs. And with Russ to take over some of the playmaking roles he should get much easier looks at 3 to make the defense pay if they do sag off him."
The league became goofy after that year. There's no way Kyrie and James Harden should be on the same team as Kevin Durant in Brooklyn. And Westbrook on the same team as AD and Lebron...on the Lakers. They are driving away fans like me.
I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs a pretty clear top-5. In any order.   Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Steph Curry  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  I‚Äôd probably have Durant and Kawhi 1 and 2 but the margins are incredibly slim and I‚Äôm not mad at any argument for a different guy at the top spot.
So I've a friend that's such a hater for 90's basketball that he said that Jonas Valanciunas can stop Hakeem because the players now are so much better in every way. No joke.   It supports his Lebron James&gt;&gt;&gt; Jordan argument because Lebron played against superior competition.
"Any proof that LeBron James, Rich Paul's longtime close friend,  is Rich Paul's highest profile and biggest money maker? You kidding  And I'm not suggesting anything. Sorry, this is too dense for me."

"Each year on Opening Night, one lucky boy is freed from Adam Silver‚Äôs basement, and is crowned as the year‚Äôs ‚ÄúFine Hoard.‚Äù  90% of player fines go straight to a bank account this child can access the day he turns 18; the remaining 10% are put towards maintenance of Adam Silver‚Äôs basement chamber.   Since term length is only one year, upon completion of the NBA Finals, the child must return to Adam Silver‚Äôs basement until he reaches adulthood. Roughly 72% of all graduates end up bankrupt within 3 years, and are left with no choice but to return to the basement.

"Cade Cunningham becomes the first player in NBA history to win the scoring title, ROTY, league MVP, and FMVP, in the same season after leading the Pistons to an 82-0 regular season record and sweeping the playoffs.    The Pistons set a new finals record for average margin of victory at 44 points per game over the Lakers. A humiliated LeBron James realizes the futility of continuing his career and announces his retirement during the post game 4 news conference. Still in awe of Cunningham's performance the media is largely disinterested.  Unsatisfied with his performance Cunningham vows to do better in his sophomore season and spends summer of 2022 hard at work shoring up his ""weaknesses."" In the 22-23 season he delivers on that promise and becomes the first player in NBA history to win the scoring title, DPOY MIP, league MVP, and FMVP in the same season after doubling his scoring average, repeatedly breaking Wilt Chamberlain's single game scoring record, and leading the Pistons to their second straight undefeated season. Behind Cade's increased defensive intensity the Pistons post the first 94 shut outs in league history.   LeBron James talks Bronny and Bryce out of persuing careers in basketball and together they found a religion with Cunningham as their deity. Cunningham is not affiliated with the faith.   In the 23-24 season Cade continues his dominance, again winning every game and virtually every award.   Little Caesar's Arena changes its name to Cade's House. In an unprecedented move every other team in the league follows suit renaming their arenas variations of Cade's Vacation House, or Cade's Home Away From Home. The owners unanimously decide such a tribute is insufficient and with the exception of the Pistons every team retires not only Cade's number 2, but every multiple of 2 as well.   In the summer of 2024 Cade expands his record setting to the Olympics, single handedly dominating the Paris games as every other American player watches in awe from the bench. After the medal ceremony the nation of France immediately gives up both the French language and the metric system, and changes their flag to a replica of Cade's jersey. The rest of the European union follows suit shortly afterward. Soccer falls into obscurity.   A jealous and starstruck Kim Jong Un threatens to launch his entire nuclear arsenal unless he's allowed to meet Cade Cunningham. Cunningham agrees and upon their meeting Kim converts to Cadeism which has become the world's fastest growing religion. Reverend LeBron James annoints Kim into the faith with drops of sweat squeezed from Cunningham's game worn socks. Cunningham who remains unaffiliated with the religion vows to stop leaving his socks laying around after games.   Kim attempts to abdicate his position as Supreme Leader to Cunningham who politely declines. Regardless the nations of North and South Korea after seven decades of hostility put aside their differences and become one united nation under the name the United Republic of Cade-rea.   There's more but honestly after this it gets a bit far fetched."
LeBron ‚ÄúStopped By DeAndre‚Äù James
The nba drafts from 2011-2014 were heavily rigged towards the cavs in any effort to try to get Lebron James to go back to cleaveland and revive Ohios nba market. The nba needs to open up an investigation on Lebron and the cavs.

"Brooklyn or OKC.    Warriors KD will always be just 3 of the worst nba years ever where KD joined an all time great team that was capable of winning the championship without him and he decided to hop on the bandwagon for easy rings.     When I think of KD I used to think about his 2011-2016 playoff runs and all the great battles he had with teams like Memphis, San Antonio, Dallas, etc   When I think of warriors KD I remember an all time great talent who was scared of adversity and got the defensive attention of a role player despite being an all time talent.   Last year was the best Kevin Durant I ever seen and straight up the best basketball player I have ever seen except for 2013-2018 lebron James and early 2000s shaq. If we see more playoff runs like that I‚Äôm gonna accociate KDs legacy with Brooklyn because it‚Äôs the best version of himself"
"Significantly worse than this.  Everyone that wasn't a Heat fan was actively rooting for him to fail, and his loss in the Finals was legitimately celebrated.  A quick Google search of things people were saying:  [The criticism of Lebron won't stop until he wins 8 titles](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/732925-2011-nba-finals-criticism-of-lebron-james-will-continue)  [Lebron James: The Most Hated Man in Basketball?](https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/lebron-james-hated-man-basketball/story?id=13832164)  [Lebron James Deserves Criticism, but his attackers go overboard](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/wizards/lebron-james-deserves-criticism-but-his-attackers-go-overboard/2011/06/17/AGeXJEZH_story.html) - Honestly, the closest to fair, but it's hilarious that this is probably the fairest take on Lebron, given what he went on to do."
"Exactly. You have to look at best case scenario for each team if they don‚Äôt reach a deal.  For the lakers, they have a war chest full of assets and cap space to go spend on any other star that becomes available, and since they have Lebron James basically any star will be a good fit so it‚Äôs not like they need to hold out for a center or anything.  For the Pelicans, their only asset is Davis and he publicly declared he would not re-sign anywhere but LA. If the deal with the lakers falls through, they will have to sell AD to someone else at one-year rental prices instead of franchise cornerstone prices.   The lakers were always in the more powerful seat here, the Pelicans were just lucky that the lakers valued getting Davis sooner over the extra assets they were able to get."
"I swear Rich Paul is the epitome of being in the right place at the right time.   Like, if he hadn‚Äôt randomly met young Lebron at an airport and sold him some jerseys, he wouldn‚Äôt have been able to charm his way into Lebrons entourage and eventually become his agent. The only reason he is successful is because he is friends with James.  He doesn‚Äôt even appear to be the mastermind behind the lucrative contracts Klutch Sports was able to come up, that credit goes to Termini."

"All of what you‚Äôve written is based on your subjective assessment of him and his teams post-outcome. There are so many teams who let drama fester but they STILL win and that drama is forgotten.   Doc‚Äôs teams don‚Äôt have any drama that is so out of the regular as to make him NOTORIOUS for having that. Both the Clippers and the 76ers have star players(Simmons, PG) who were clowned for their weaknesses showing up BEFORE Doc coached them. Placing all of that at the feet of Doc and making him seem weak when he handled a 4 star locker room with a player like KG handsomely is BS.  Besides, Lebron‚Äôs teams are consistently drama filled but that doesn‚Äôt limit success because he‚Äôs Lebron James."

"Yeah, he is still the most hyped prospect since Lebron James.  People knew KD was going to be scoring champ/MVP and still expected Greg to go #1.  If he lived up to that hype, he probably ends up up #5-15 All-Time ranking.  He's one of the few players who could've gotten that elusive DPOY and MVP combo.  For reference, the players who have accomplished that have gone on to win championships.  Likewise, his PER was close to 24 PER in his second season and probably would've achieved that if he played more.  Iirc, NBA starters with that stat (24 PER in second season) have all won championships.  So, the trajectory for an All-time great was there."

"It‚Äôs hard to call it a play when Simmons unironically declared what he was going to do a month ago. The front office of the Sixers were EXTREMELY content in this whole situation until they realized they couldn‚Äôt get Lebron James in a trade. Honestly the only people that aren‚Äôt fucked in this scenario is the players. The coach shit talks a player to the media, the front office then doesn‚Äôt respect their word and goes on to play chicken for NO apparent gain.  As someone who watches OKC I thank fucking god I don‚Äôt have to watch your front offices decisions. When Paul George wanted out to play for the Clippers after performing sub par in 3 playoffs our office didn‚Äôt give a fuck he was gone.

Kobe was picking up guards full court when he played with Shaq and he was also given point guard duties and did a good job. Having Kobe committed to running the point while also being able to chase Steph would be fun. And Steph wouldn‚Äôt be able to guard Kobe. Jordan and Kawhi could probably both switch back and forth from Klay and KD. Lebron can hang with Giannis. And though I understand Embiid is no Shaq, he‚Äôs still really skilled, has size, and also the right type of attitude to go against Shaq. He won‚Äôt wanna get punked."

"It meant Lebron's run with Cleveland ends and people hate Lebron. Gotta remember that Kyrie wasn't considered a big weirdo then and unlike most of the other star trade demands, Kyrie was actually not the guy who leaked that he wanted to leave. Him leaving Boston and that shit he says is what made people turn on him. Throwing Jamal Murray's ball into the stands after the game winner was in bad taste too. Boston will still be Boston but they were the anti-hero who tilted James Harden to the face of oblivion, made life difficult for Lebron and somehow managed to constantly challenge Warriors in the regular season even with the talent disparity"

"Its been called a dying sport ""ratings"" down 40% since 2019. Personally I cant watch basketball anymore, too many divas, the players dress ridiculous, every call on the court, gets blown up bye the player, making stupid pathetic faces and throwing there hands in the air. Plus now guys just all jump to the same team to win, follow lebron James around crap. Back in the day, you would build teams drafting, coaching and training. Guys didn't demand trades, especially demanding a trade to only certain teams. So giving players too much power, ruined how teams are built and guys getting recruited to teams with a lebron or harden, etc."
2017 was Kyrie Irving for daring to not want to play with the great LeBron James anymore
"I'll start from least to most controversial:  \- Giannis's peak is already the second best for a PF of all time, Garnett was even better defensively but wasn't as good as a scorer  \- Heliocentric ball dominant guards, no matter how much assists they may rack up, make their teammates worse and unless they are a truly elite scorer(example: LeBron) they cannot be the best player on a championship team, as they are only floor and not ceiling raisers(example: Westbrook.) Controversially, I also believe this to apply to current Luka and think the Porzingis situation is partly caused by Luka's extreme ball dominance and refusal to pass early in the shot clock. Players like Curry who can play off ball well will always be better than players who can't, with the SOLE exception of LeBron James.   \- Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant are just as good skillwise as Magic and Bird, the only difference is that Magic and Bird didn't have their prime overlap with Jordan the way Curry and Durant did with LeBron. For example, Durant would have threepeated MVP just like Bird did if LeBron wasn't in the league. Also, as I mentioned before, neither one of them needs to hold the ball constantly, which makes them much more ""plug and play"" than other stars."

"It's because he's trying to pull a LeBron while being nowhere near as good as James, and with 4 years left on his deal. LBJ, for all the shit he's gotten for it, signed short term deals to keep his leverage. Also, you can't really accuse the guy of not trying to win every chance he gets. Ben's effort is questionable, his production is bad, he gets mad the moment Rivers stops sucking him off and has four years left on his contract but has decided he's not gonna come to work. Of course he's hated, he's the worst elements of the modern NBA all rolled into one."

"As far as coaches he's not elite but how many coaches on the market have his pedigree?   You can say he sucks all  You want point is he won a championship,  has beaten lebron James in a playoff series, age has shown the ability to coach superstars.    Could he do better yes he could but outside of Phil Jackson or Pop who could the 76ers hire that is better in a vacuum and im not taking about potential or take a shot on this guy or that guy.  NBA is a business abd finishing returns on replacing him is non-sense unless he battles with ownership or loses Embid's endorsement"
Trying to correct someone who's supposedly a huge fan of the player but keeps saying his name is James Lebron
"I don't know if there is a way to ""fix"" it at all, especially if the player we are talking about is of a James Harden or Kyrie Irving stature (we all saw what happened when they wanted out). I think if anything the Schroder situation showed that only superstar-caliber players can successfully demand to leave their situation and come out better off after the fact. I'm also not so sure the NBA wants to ""fix"" these sort of situations because most of the time they are better for the league and create interesting story lines - the James Harden saga that ended with him becoming part of a super team in the Eastern Conference (something the NBA has been starving for since Lebron left Miami, especially as Golden State got so dominant and Lebron teamed up with AD in La etc.) and now Ben Simmons making headlines practically every week as that story continues to develop. A lof of fans hate the way guys are demanding to leave their situations and I understand it but like it or not, I think the NBA thoroughly enjoyed the way James Harden forced his way out and teamed up with Kyrie and KD - situations like that are very profitable and create an insane amount of buzz around their league."

"The ball movement would be off the charts though. Imaging Kyrie with Magic's court vision. In my opinion, the three best players when it comes to being able to track mass data across the court (all the little details at the same time) were Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and LeBron James. Getting two of them together would have been spectacular. Sorry, did you want more buckets? Is that the only way you kids know how to pay these days?"
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
If Lebron alone can have this much economic impact I would think a team can have a pretty big boost for an area as well.  https://www.jamesmadison.org/king-midas-the-economic-impact-of-lebron-james/
"His reputation?  He's a (former) basketball player with a podcast.  Drama just brings him more exposure.    If Griffin disputed his claims, you really gonna have a different opinion of JJ?  He's not LeBron James, Durant or a even a 1 team - career player."
"LeBron gave money to a public school. The taxpayers in that area are paying $8M/yr for a selective school with 240 students, that's about 33k/year or 3x the average in Akron of 13k/year. James says he's committed to funding at about 2M/year, or 25% of the school's budget.   You can read about it [here](https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2018/08/whos_paying_for_lebron_james_n_1.html)."

"It is this mentality that has allowed LeBron James to accomplish an extraordinary career and still be at the top of his game at the beginning of his 19th season in the NBA. A model for every professional basketball player."
Even coaches are excited to coach Lebron the GOAT James
is this same 73-9 Warriors team that lost to LeBron James' Cavalier team? The 3-1 historic comeback to win the Championship?
"Eh, famous people become famous when other people recognize them and care about their brand. Russel Westbrook has curated his own brand, has his own charity foundation, and does commercials and endorsements. It comes with the territory. I‚Äôm sure famous people already expect and plan for people to ask for pictures when they go out, and thus usually avoid places like the grocery store. You won‚Äôt find Lebron James at the store picking up stuff for Taco Tuesday"
"plenty of role players have better stats playing with lebron, lot of guys are catch and shoot guys and lebron is one of the best at creating open shots for teammates.  Simple one is kcp had the 3 most efficient years of his career playing with lebron.  also ad had his best year ever with lebron in 2020 but let me guess that was all due to his own development and had nothing to do with lebron.  Ofc volume will go down when you play with lebron or a ball dominant star but that's expected whenever you move to any more talented team. You'll have the ball less and get less shots and play less minutes.    aaron gordon scored 15ppg in orlando, he scored 10ppg in denver and jokic is the absolute opposite of a ball dominant star.  Denver is fine with that too he was more efficient and shouldnt be scoring 15 on a great offensive team.  To use a great player as an example, james harden wont average even 30ppg in bkn most likely while he was putting up 35 in houston and KD isnt luka/lebron ball dominant either."
"Then we would've run with Eric Bledsoe, Paul George, LeBron James, Kevin Love and TT."

"I don't care at all how much any of these people make, but it's insane to just deny facts here. Stephen A. Smith is one of the biggest five names in sports media. I'm totally on board with Taylor betting on herself. You do you. I like her a lot. I think she's talented, she's pleasant to look at, and comes from the sports world. And all that said, she isn't Steven A. Smith. We'd laugh at Terry Rozier nonstop if he said ""I want to make LeBron James money"" if he turned down a pretty big contract offer. What's the difference?"
You‚Äôre adding Lebron James to a team that went 73-9
"Is that LeBron one after the JR Smith Game 1 goof? That was so goofy.  &gt;Schwartz: From listening to everybody‚Äôs reaction to the play at the end with J.R. getting the rebound, there‚Äôs still confusion about whether J.R. thought the game was tied or whether he thought you guys were ahead. From where you stood on the court and from talking to him after the play, what‚Äôs your reaction to it? What‚Äôs your version?  &gt;James: What do you mean what‚Äôs my version?  &gt;Schwartz: Did he think that the game was tied or did he think that you guys had it salted away?  &gt;James: How do I know that?  &gt;Schwartz: Or did you discuss it with him at all at the end of the play?  &gt;James: No. They asked me if I talked to J.R. about it. I said no already. I knew it was a tie game. We was down one. George Hill went up and made the first one. We got the offensive rebound. I thought we were all aware of what was going on. That‚Äôs my view. I don‚Äôt know what J.R. was thinking. I don‚Äôt know the question you‚Äôre trying to ask.  &gt;Schwartz: I was just trying to see if you knew exactly what his state of mind was. Did he think that you guys had it won or did he think he was trying to make a play? (James begins shaking his head) Not sure?  &gt;James: What do you mean I‚Äôm not sure? No, I don‚Äôt know his state of mind.  &gt;Scchwartz: Did you know if he knew the score?  &gt;Without speaking another word, James quickly rose to his feet, put sunglasses on, grabbed his bag and walked out."
"k you're 12 years old, Paul Pierce guarded Kobe Bryant and won FMVP you must not have watched that Playoffs, it was clear who was the best player.   And KG was the DPOY in 08 the year the Celtics beat the Lakers and it was clear Pierce was still their best player.   KG was miles ahead of Chandler..  Dirk has the second greatest carry-job of all-time after Hakeem.      Michael Jordan once said there were only 4 great players during that era ""According to Thompson, Jordan quipped that he could ‚Äúonly come up with four‚Äù modern players. Those select few? Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Tim Duncan, and Dirk Nowitzki.""  (Notice no KG?)     Do the Math:      Dirk + Jason Terry beat LeBron (Superstar) and Wade (Superstar)   KG + FMVP + HOF beat Kobe (Superstar) and Pau      The Celtics were a better team than the Lakers, empirically.  The Mavs were NOT a better team than the Heat, empirically, but they won bc of Dirk."
"Since 1956, the MVP played the following positions:  point guard - 11 times (Bob Cousy, Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, Steve Nash, Derrick Rose, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook)   shooting guard - 8 times (Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, James Harden)   small forward - 9 times (Julius Erving, Larry Bird, LeBron James, Kevin Durant)   power forward - 12 times (Bob Pettit, Bob McAdoo, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, Giannis Antetokounmpo)   center - 26 times (Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Wes Unseld, Willis Reed, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Dave Cowens, Bill Walton, Moses Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Nikola Jokic)"
"LeBron James and Jeff Green.  Their skillsets are similar, their talent gap could not be much wider."
"To be fair there is a reason Bronny goes by Bronny and insists to go by Bronny and not LeBron James Jr.   He wants to be his own man and make his own path. It's why he does stuff like Faze Clan, smoking a blunt on Snapchat, and trending towards becoming a PG instead a SF. He's his own man and not just an off shot of his dad.  That's probably why he doesn't post anything about his dad.  And who often posts about their dad?"
Steve Nash and LeBron James.  Both are guys who always focused on distributing for their teammates in the regular season but would amp up their scoring production come playoff time.
[LeBron James](https://youtu.be/NQGIAZsxtC0)
"I mean KD and kyrie when paired with other stars have been historically good in the playoffs. Harden has an iffy track record but he also hasn‚Äôt had this lessened burden prior to with Brooklyn. Folding under pressure shouldn‚Äôt be an issue at all, although injuries are definitely a concern. This would be assuming they‚Äôre healthy.  A 50 piece in the playoffs is out of the ordinary for any player that‚Äôs not a Michael Jordan/ Lebron James/ Kobe. Even explosive regular season players that drop 50 casually like harden or dame haven‚Äôt done it many times in the playoffs.   And idk if I trust Boston to take down the bucks. Like in terms of raw talent, Milwaukee has the edge. In terms of fit and chemistry, we know Milwaukee is seamless while Boston has a whole new supporting cast and has a lot of question marks. Idk how Boston‚Äôs gonna slow down giannis, they struggled in their last series against him. I assume smart takes on jrue and tbf he could slow him down a good bit. Middleton should get his against brown, even if it involves a lot of catch and shoots or screens. And then at the offensive end, who in Boston can be trusted that much to create besides brown and Tatum? I love Al but I think his days of having consistent playoff offence run through him are over. Schroder is the embodiment of inconsistency. It‚Äôs basically brown and Tatum who will be dealing with jrue, Middleton and Divincenzo on the perimeter, and if they get past them, giannis and brook waiting to shut down the paint"
You would hope that a new coach would have already realized that they'll be coaching Lebron James.

"I mean if you have so many that the whole court is full of them (I mean full), LeBron basically can‚Äôt move without getting a foul called. And yeah 8-year olds have no strategy, it‚Äôll probably just be if they catch the ball they shoot. But given James can never move, almost all of the 8-year olds misses are just gonna land in the hands of another 8-year old who will shot. Eventually some of the shots will go in = win for the 8 year olds"
"Didn't Jamal avg 26.5/4.8/6.6, come back from 3-1 twice in the same run, and was 1 Buzzer beater from going up 2-1 on the eventual champs in the 2020 playoffs, including having a 3 game run of 50,42,50 on the 1st 3-1 come back? Didnt he do a 360 layup around a 3 time DPOY in that come back? Didnt he do a fake up and under reverse in those playoffs around Lebron James who most consider to be top 3 all time? Who tf do y'all think Jaylen Brown is God disguised as Jaylen Brown gtfo. If Jaylen Brown was Jamal Murray you would havr won a ring in the last 5 years. They said Jaylen not Jason Tatum."
"Primarily through James, occasionally Westbrook. I expect a lot of LeBron drawing defenders then passing it to Westbrook on the 3 point line, who then drives to the hoop."
"I think its a stretch to say that hes better than jamal murray and jrue holiday RIGHT NOW, those guys are proven and have performed at the highest levels, but i feel like a lot of nephews here saying that hes the worst out of the players you listed are only saying that because they either a. dont watch the grizzlies whatsoever so they have no frame of reference or b. they only watch his highlights, assume that people think hes good only because his highlights are flashy, and convince themselves they are basketball analysts because they somehow ""know"" he doesnt have advanced stats numbers that matchup with the flair he has for the game.   People that actually watch games and grizzlies fans know that ja is special, and I would even go as far to say i think he will have a better career and be a better player than zion. Ja was the spoon that stirred the drink for memphis this season, and actually led his team to a playoff berth. Furthermore, along with zion, hes one of the most efficient players to come out of college since the likes of lebron james, steph curry, and anthony davis.    Yea he is still young, but put some respect on the guys name. De aaron fox is good, but I dont think he is on the level morant is even now, never mind in the future."
LeBron James
"Jesus Christ the revisionist history. Giannis at this point was leading LeBron in the following statistics: points, rebounds, steals, blocks, FG%, PER, WS/48, OBPM, DBPM and VORP. LeBron had him in assists and media narrative.  Giannis was having one of the greatest seasons of ALL TIME, he was legit breaking Wilt's PER record and people were talking about LeBron because of a meaningless March game where Giannis dropped 32-11-6.  He was also in no freaking DPOY conversation, Anthony Davis was by far the best defensive player in the Lakers and he was in that conversation, the same AD was also leading the Lakers in points, rebounds, steals, blocks, PER and FG%.  LeBron James is a Mount Rushmore player, yet Reddit has the ability to somehow overrate him and create storylines that never existed, how is that even possible."

If you hate LeBron you just a lame.  LeBron making money moves. Putting his team in a position to shine. All this while being a great father. He doesn't get in trouble off the court.   What's not to Love about King James?
"Laker fans are toxic, pure and simple. Look at how they reacted to a mural of Lebron James, a member of the Los Angeles Lakers, that referred to his as the King of La. They defaced it.   A mural of a Laker roster member was defaced by their OWN fans."
"I mean, I know he‚Äôs not in his prime anymore, but it is kind of mind blowing he‚Äôs playing with Lebron. If you told someone in say 2005 or 2006 that one day Lebron James and Carmelo Anthony were gonna be teammates their brains would melt."
"&gt; Players have no incentive to accept smoothing,   Yes they do.  Because the vast majority of players didn't benefit from the cap spike, One guy gets Mozgov money, a bunch of other plaeyrs get minimums.  &gt; Teams might want this for monetary purposes.  There is no monetary benefit for teams.  The amount that would be in the cap available to players is *distributed to players across the league*. That was always the plan.  The NBAPA didn't want cap smoothing because the president and vice president were Chris Paul and LeBron James, and star players can confidently expect that *they'll* get max money.  They fucked over most of the league on that one."
"We don't have a good back up for luka. + Luka doesn't seem to want to get into shape.  I'm not saying turn into LeBron james, but you can't have playoff games where you are the best player in the world for three quarters. And then completely gas out and only take two shots in the fourth quarter."
"If you look up the definition of ""carrying"" in sports, it's just LeBron James in game 6 of 2007 ECF"

Agreed. I thought the OP was saying that Skip doesn't post as much about Savannah James and Bronny as he does about LeBron.
"For the Raptors, Kyle Lowry Game 6 vs the Celtics (2020) and Game 7 vs the Heat (2016), Terrence Ross 51 point game  For my favorite players: LeBron Game 6 vs the Celtics (2012), Devin Booker Game 1 vs the Lakers (2021), James Harden 60 point triple double"

"Lebron James. Surrounds himself with players better than him in the hopes of getting chips but always steals the glory (Kyrie, Wade, AD). He'd probably fit in OP's last category of being straight up trash."
"It‚Äôs not ‚Äòtoo‚Äô dismissive: it‚Äôs dismissive because it‚Äôs true. At some point any claim that isnt correct has to be dismissed. So in this case it‚Äôs the ‚Äòright‚Äô amount of dismissal.  Jordan played for over a decade as the best in the game. His career was  3 times the length of the  average NBA player. He has a large sample size, and was extremely consistent across it.   A good college career is irrelevant. ‚ÄòThis guy was great at a lower level of competition so he needs to be considered as the greatest ever‚Äô. Thats‚Ä¶.not how it works. If they were equal At the highest level you could look at other aspects, but that‚Äôs not the case here.  I‚Äôm not sure whether we are talking  about the same thing stats wise but Jordan‚Äôs best year beats LBJs best year in ppg, steals and blocks. Essentially: on both ends of the floor Jordan‚Äôs best is better than LeBrons best; and on both ends  Jordan‚Äôs career average is better.   Rebounding numbers are harder to compare because of position, but Jordan is clearly ahead on offensive boards. He‚Äôs also #1 all time defensive boards for an SG and top 5 for any small. LeBron is a great rebounder, but all things considered he‚Äôs probably behind here.  The stats kind of dismiss LeBrons case, even without looking at finals performances. He‚Äôs just not as good at either end.  The fact of the matter is if you look at skill and success at basketball there isn‚Äôt really a legitimate challenger to MJ. That‚Äôs not to say these other guys are bums, it‚Äôs just an indication how how freaking good Jordan was.  Something else to consider: if LeBron came first, that is, if LeBron played with the same level of success but he started in the 80s and Jordan started in 2003, what would the consensus be?   James would have been the almost unanimous GOAT. Then we would have seen the greatest scorer ever eclipsing James‚Äô rings total playing for the one team (sorry Wizards) who were legitimately the worst in the league, while picking up more MVPs, more FMVPs and a DPOY along the way.   Would we even be debating whether LeBron still had an argument?"
Also Kendrick Perkins: Cade Cunningham is the most complete prospect since Lebron James!  Guys a certified clown

Oh god now we are going to hear more nonsense from the ‚Äúunderdog ‚Äú LeBron James again.
"Two great things that would go terribly together. Guys who operate in the same space and/or need the opposite of what the other brings. Guys with similar personalities but different game philosophies.   Allen Iverson &amp; Patrick Ewing. Sorry OP. Cheating a bit. The greatest off the dribble PNR guy with a stationary low post operator.   Kobe Bryant &amp; Isiah Thomas. Ball dominant orchestraters who‚Äôd get into fistfights about who The Man is.   Larry Bird &amp; James Harden. A movement creator and the ball pounder. Cultural differences?   Grant Hill &amp; LeBron. Too similar, too interested in playing chess, these two complement each other too well and don‚Äôt make up for each other‚Äôs minor deficiencies. There can only be one smartest guy on the court and it‚Äôd be like having two teachers pet‚Äôs vying for valedictorian."
He was LeBron James before LeBron James.
"I mean, it has to be duncan, but also duncan was just better than him so in the lebron james movie I would make it maybe... Idk, westbrook? Curry is also better than lebron (at playing winning basketball, not at putting up counting stats) so that doesn't paint him in a favourable light."
"Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabar, Michael Jordan, LeBron James (not in that order, just all 5 could easily be called GOAT)"
"None. He kept joining/creating superteams that he doesn't really have that adversary where he had to strive to beat them.  When the going got tough, Lebron James up and went and took his talents to another team."
"Sounds like copy pasta from the Heat after lebron left. And then again after the Waiters, Whiteside and James Johnson contracts."
"Neither you nor anyone has countered what I said though. Let‚Äôs forget about opinions, let‚Äôs look at facts  Who came in second place to Lebron in 2012 in MVP voting? KD, Steph wasn‚Äôt even an All star in 2012 and played only 26 games  Who came in second to Lebron in the 2012 NBA finals? KD  Who was unanimous FMVP in 2017 against Lebron?

KD  KD is lebron‚Äôs main rival and has been before Steph was even an All star and the Warriors had any relevancy.  2 out of Steph‚Äôs 3 rings against Lebron, who was the finals mvp including Unanimous finals MVP?  Yea exactly   Bron and KD have a decade long rivalry Steph been his rival for what? 6 years?  Forget espn. Let‚Äôs talk the facts. Here‚Äôs lebrons comment in 2012 &gt; LeBron:‚ÄùI know there is someone, somewhere, trying to take my spot. And I know where he is too. He's in Oklahoma. He's my inspiration because I see the direction he's headed, and it's the same direction I'm headed. I know his mind-set, and he knows mine. It's a collision course. We're driving one another.""  https://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-durant-rivalry-2012-12  Here‚Äôs Kds in 2011  &gt; Durant, though, almost goes out of his way to downplay a budding rivalry. ‚ÄúIt's kind of cool for the fans of the game. But as a player, you just want to go out there and play,‚Äù Durant said. ‚ÄúYou don't want to take anything from your teammates or the organization.

Yea exactly lol."
"That‚Äôs just incorrect.  As long as Lebron James has legs and is under 50 he can play in the nba.  Even if he‚Äôs washed as fuck and comes off the bench on a trash team Lebron will always be able to play in the NBA,  because he sells tickets and his vision will always be elite"
"Steph is definitely NOT a great passer. Calling a player like him a great passer, with his AST-TO ratio and his playoff history as a passer, is disrespectful to actually ""great passers"". Steph has had playoff SERIES with more turnovers than assists, calling him anything but a decent passer is massively overrating his passing capabilities.  Rajon Rondo is a great passer, LeBron James is a great passer, Magic Johnson was the greatest passer of all-time by far.  &gt; But to stay that the gap between shooting is smaller than the gap between passing is absurd.  No it isn't, Magic was actually a pretty good midrange shooter and in his last three years he shot either at league average from 3 or above it, if you ask me that's either better than Steph's ability as a passer or as good."
"Lol I‚Äôm a Lebron fan, I‚Äôm a basketball fan. I don‚Äôt hate any superstars, so You‚Äôre looking for someone else carrying a pitchfork.  I saw this as an observation of a random stat. The comments have haters but that‚Äôs expected in sports. Nobody said anything about King James legacy, or anyone else‚Äôs. Great as they are we can talk about the their shortcomings without being haters."
You‚Äôre the one who said Shane Battier is a better defender than lebron james  Edit: your ‚Äî&gt; you‚Äôre (maybe I *am* the stupid person here!)
"Did DWade take votes from Lebron on the heat? You do understand that Lebron James is 37 this season right? And we‚Äôre literally taking about 25-1 odds, obviously a lot has to go right."
"Yeah, save for maybe Artest (and this is a stretch) but I‚Äôd so much rather have young Lebron guarding the other team‚Äôs best player in the last 2 minutes of a playoff game than any of these guys. They‚Äôre just names with (well-earned!!) reputations, but literally none of them have the foot speed, size, body control and athleticism of lebron james. And it‚Äôs not particularly close. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs maybe the goat!!"
"Not quite sure what you mean by that. I mean the difference between Durant and Lebron in terms of career scoring is similar to Durant and Curry, just in different aspects.  Durant is quite clearly the best career scorer overall out of the players currently playing and James Harden might have better argument for 2nd in that aspect rather than Curry or Lebron, also maybe Giannis in future once we see how his career progresses.  Now where would anyone get idea that Curry or Lebron aren't strong scorer's is odd to me and I've never really heard any such statements."
"It's a terrible bet. Even if AD is the guy statistically, everyone is gonna know he's playing with Lebron james. Also, its highly likely that AD has minor (or major) injuries throughout the season that can put him at a games disadvantage."
"‚ÄúMy motivation is this ghost I‚Äôm chasing. The ghost played in Chicago.‚Äù      On Wednesday night LeBron James passed that ‚Äúghost‚Äù in career points, putting him at fourth all-time in NBA history.  http://skedline.com/2019/03/lebron-keeps-chasing-the-ghost-in-chicago/"
Lebron james cares more about his reschedualing his dentist apointment then he cares about reschedualing his apointment at the DMV

Yes LeBron James has a poor work ethic.
"Dude did a triple-double without points and missed 5x5 by a point. Versatile on both ends. Also was the top scorer in a FINALS GAME 7 that featured LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Kyrie Irving. That's nuts."
"Cant I?  Kobe never averaged 22ppg on dismal shooting splits and got swept in the Finals specifically because he couldn't shoot like LeBron in 2007.  LeBron James and the Cavs were 60 win teams in 2009 and 2010, very much in part due to the additions of Mo Williams and other quality players. No, Cavs weren't super talented, but they fit extremely well around LBJ, and are a big reason for why they were favorites to make it to the Finals. Kobe's Lakers had more talent, sure, but they weren't super stacked or anything. The Big 3 Celtics and Duncan's Spurs overall had more talent, and Kobe beat them.   In these instances, LBJ wasn't the underdog. The expectation was always a Kobe - LeBron Finals back then, there's no getting away from that fact.  And then you can also just straight up compare LBJs and Kobe's stats against the 2007/2008 Spurs, 2008 Celtics, 2009 Magic, 2010 Celtics. Outside of the 2009 Magic, Kobe played better as well (and Kobe still was phenomenal against the Magic)."
"There was a good twitter thread breaking this down but can't find it. Here's what I remember.  The Cavaliers were going to trade Kyrie. They were looking into Eric Bledsoe (haha) and so Kyrie was offended and he asked out before they could move him. He said he'd go to the [Timberwolves, Spurs, Heat, Knicks](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/7/21/16012292/kyrie-irving-trade-demand-cavaliers-spurs-heat-knicks-timberwolves-lebron-james) and they instead sent him to the Celtics.  So it wasn't really like he left Cavs in a one-sided manner to go on to do something better. He was kind of traded around and then eventually left to go to his hometown team and his father's favorite team."
We would have seen this Lebron James in the playoffs again this summer until Solomon Hill decided to choose retaliation. ol dusty ass bitch
Preseason is basically for young guys to prove they deserve a rotation spot. 37 year old Lebron James is in the complete opposite spectrum for the target player for preseason
Appearances are obviously subjective but I always thought Kevin Durant and Lebron James are really ugly lol.
Was the list changed because your top 10 and the top 10 in the link is different   LeBron James  Michael Jordan  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Wilt Chamberlain  Magic Johnson  Bill Russell  Shaquille O'Neal  Kobe Bryant  Tim Duncan  Larry Bird
The LeBron James drill is carrying a dead team to the finals
"They really said:   ‚Äúthere are 61 players better than dwade including paul arizin ‚Äú (a guy who played back when black people weren‚Äôt allowed to play in the same games and also most people could only dribble with one hand.)  They really said:  ‚ÄúScottie pipen over Shaq, Kobe, KD, Robinson etc‚Ä¶ but not Steph.‚Äù   They really said:  ‚ÄúDirk was just aight‚Äù  They really said:   There are FIVE people better than lebron fuckin James. One is George Mikan, and the other is Magic Johnson, who himself said that lebron is better than him‚Ä¶.   They really said that shit."
I‚Äôve never heard a basketball coach tell someone to do the LeBron James Drill.
Not even just that but over Lebron fucking James lmao

Reply to this if you agree Michael Jordan is better at basketball than LeBron James.
LeBron James. There are a few other candidates but LeBron in my opinion had the perfect mix of size/strength/agility/athleticism and a body that was able to mostly stay injury-free.
LeBron James JeBron Lames LeJame Brones JeBrame Lones Semaj NorBel
Dude what‚Äôs sad is it could be Ben Simmons but the reality is it Lebron James. Kevin Durant is underrated in this topic as well
Lebron James and Wilt. Put them in the order you want.
Lebron Raymone James
"The anti-LeBron James is Clifton McNeely. He was the best player in the NAIA (which used to be a much bigger deal) and was the first pick in the 1947 BAA draft, but he was married and wanted a stable career, and thus he coached high school basketball instead. The Pittsburgh Ironmen, who used their pick on him, folded before the 1948 season. Most of their players didn't play in the league again. Their only player of note was Press Maravich, Pete's dad."
john cena and lebron james.
"I'd say this from the 2018 finals is fairly successful. ""According to NBA.com/Stats, James has had 26 possessions with Curry as his primary defender in the first three games of the Finals, almost nine per game. These possessions have come primarily toward the ends of games, when James methodically slows the offense, points at Curry‚Äôs man, and calls for a screen, at which point the Warriors‚Äô switching defense demands Curry switch onto James. In the 26 times this has happened, James has zero points. He‚Äôs taken five shots, missing all five, and he‚Äôs never been fouled in the act of shooting.""  I'd say it's accurate because LeBron hasn't been able to. Is that because Curry's an elite man defender? Obviously not but he knows how to play defense so that he isn't taken advantage of and his teammates are able to cover any issues he may have, is able to funnel defenders into Dray, etc. That's all he needs to be able to say LeBron switching onto curry hasn't been effective"
"one had LeBron James, one had Jason Terry I'd say they're pretty comparable lolol"

"was an amazing performance, was more amusing people calling butler a superstar when lebron was basically having to do the same thing but he did it every game     two games that series butler played like lebron james     and he was fucking dead the game after for it and it straight up looked like his body was giving up on him     goes to show you just how crazy lebron's finals runs have been and how he did so many at once, warriors had a dynasty team and it seemed like their bodies all literally started to implode after a handful of deep runs when lebron did that like a decade straight"
They traded him to LEBRON JAMES. For Kyrie Irving in return. They didn't ship him off to some team who's lucky to lose in the first round like the Mavs for the past decade. Where's the ire towards the Cavaliers for playing him before he had fully healed? Explain to me why are the Celtics are obligated to have charity roster spots? If they had given IT a 10 day contract and then not signed him afterwards his chances on making it on any team would even less than they are now. It would've hurt his ability to play in the league to give him a chance out of the goodness of our hearts.
Check out kemba walker vs lebron James while your in there. One of the most one sided head to heads I beliebe
"Lebron James,¬† Chris Paul,Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Dwayne Wade, Deron Williams, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Lamarcus Aldridge, Amare Stoudemire, Dirk Nowitzki,John Wall, Joe Johnson, Zach Randolph, Chris Bosh ,Paul Pierce,Steve Nash  There are 23 players here.  Pau Gasol BARELY fits into this list.  Reddit is way too biased on Tim Duncan for what i think are reasons external to the game of basketball.  And I'm fine with that, but you're absolutely wrong if you think Tim Duncan would survive on any other team not Spurs.  Spurs and Duncan is the GOAT match when it came to player + organization. No other organization + player combo will top those two. Curry + GSW comes at #2."
Brian Scalabrine and LeBron James
"Almost all the Laker flairs you see commenting on here are acknowledging this is going to be an unknown season as far as how they will come together.   And the season hasn't even started yet and you are assuming everything will be certainly one way between Lebron James, Russell Westbrook, and Anthony Davis.  Only a hot take shit poster would say they know how this team will play with Westbrook."
"I‚Äôm aware and it‚Äôs horrifying. This is the same shot the president got, the Queen of England got, the head of the biggest bank in the world got, and Lebron James got. There aren‚Äôt excuses anymore.    And your segregation point is still nonsense. Trying to use a scary buzzword to make your point meaningful   And as I said, Kyries dumbass is already vaccinated for numerous diseases, as are you. It‚Äôs time to be a big boy"
Have you met Ben Simmons? Or post-The Decision LeBron James? Or post-GSW Kevin Durant?
"No doubt it's gonna be harder without him. But Harden missed a lot of games last year as well, including in you guy's series (which I'm really happy you won btw congrats).   I'm just saying they are definitely contenders even without Kyrie. KD and James Harden on a team with a bunch of solid pieces and cheap vets is always gonna be a contender.  Personally I think they win the East if they stay healthy. It'll be interesting to see how much the stars sit. Maybe they do the Lebron and just prioritise getting to the playoffs over having a good seed."
"""The Duel""  The only game in NBA Finals history that had two players (Jimmy Butler and LeBron James) to post a Top 10 Finals Game Score in the same game."
I'll never say my lines as fast as ~~Jamie Taco~~ LeBron James.
"You‚Äôre telling me Lebron James knows the affected communities well? He‚Äôs been a multi millionaire since he was 18. The guy is completely out of touch, as are the majority of players.    They‚Äôre millionaires.    And the issues are morality based not just ‚ÄòI‚Äôm black so I know all about black people‚Äô lol"
"I mean, can we just stop calling a preseason game someone's debut? Teams and players couldn't care less about it, they treat it as a less intense practice with a crowd.  I'm sure LeBron James will also average 9/3/2 for the rest of the season."
Alright. Now this is all about LeBron James and his inability‚Ä¶  It‚Äôs preseason. It don‚Äôt matter.  ITS MY TURN!!!  Listen. Skiiiiiiip.
"I played at a 24 Hour Fitness in SoCal with DJ Shumpert, a wing for the South Bay Lakers. This guy had been grinding for years and just couldn‚Äôt manage an NBA roster spot.    After lifting he would step on the court and pick any random 4 players. They could be short, fat, un-athletic. Didn‚Äôt matter. He would single handedly carry that team to win after win. His team would play for 2 hours, and never lose. He‚Äôs dunking on people, pulling up from 35 feet, nothing but net. He would not miss, block every shot, grab every rebound. Finally DJ would say he‚Äôs gotta head out, and the team would break up.    The skill gap between a random gym bro, a g league player, and the NBA is massive. DJ was closer to LeBron James than I was to DJ."
"No, because DAJ was never capable of scoring more than the low teens in points per game.  When you increase volume you decrease efficiency for everyone not named Stephen Curry.  Stephen Curry has two scoring titles on all time efficiency, 63% and 60.4% true shooting while leading the league in scoring.  That's insane.  That Steph can score more points on fewer shots than any of these people is pretty wild, and putting him next to Kevin Durant who is also scoring more than any of these other people on better efficiency...that is the point I'm trying to make.  They literally combined this season for 59 points on 38.9 shots, and that's at 33 years old for both of them.  Anthony Davis and LeBron James best seasons combine for 59.5 points on 43.4 shots."
"I think you're making an argument that I've never made.   Location matters. It matters in every job in the world. An average person isn't picking San Antonio over Los Angeles, why the fuck would LeBron James?    Having a competent team, decision makers, and a plan matters a lot more. Otherwise the Knicks and Bulls and a lot of other teams would be on easy street."
Wade also had LeBron James
It would be terrible if someone as talented as Luka had to wait years to win just ONE ring when he‚Äôs basically competing with KD and LeBron James for career pace right now.
"The Lakers are starting DeAndre Jordan, LeBron James, Kent Bazemore, Malik Monk and Russell Westbrook.  Should be fun."
"Shameful! I bought my son tickets to this game so he could see his favorite player just for Anthony Davis to sit out! The NBA really needs to do something about this, now we‚Äôll have to settle for just watching LeBron James, Steph Curry, and Russell Westbrook."
it's lebron james
Michael Jordan or Lebron James... even then... idk lol
"See: James, Lebron"
"I mean anything is possible, but by a lot of accounts Mitchell likes Utah. He shows up to college games and is involved in the community.  He also has very well run organization.   If you were a player and had to chose between the big market Knicks and the Jazz, I think you would pick the Jazz.   If you start looking at the league, I do not know if big markets outside of LA are worth it.   Salt Lake has an extremely fast growing economy and is currently 30th in the nation ahead of San Antonio, Milwaukee, New Orleans, [etc.](https://mediatracks.com/resources/nielsen-dma-rankings-2020/) Of the teams with bigger markets, there are only a few options.  * Toronto - Nope - If you have a residence in the states and play in Canada. Lots of taxes.   * New York - The Knicks have been one of the worst run franchises this decade. They may be turning the corner, which may be intriguing.   * Brooklyn - It is an opportunity to win a chip, however it would be a tough situation with volume shooters like Harden, Durrant, and Irving.   * Lakers - I think this would be a good fit, but you would still be third fiddle behind Lebron and Davis.   * Clippers - It is also a good fit and given that George and Kawhi can be passive this is an option. Not a great history of the clippers though. One of the historically worse ran franchises in the NBA.   * Chicago - Nope. - Since Rose, it has been a bad run franchise.   * Dallas - Decent option and Cuban would sell the farm. However, Luka would dominate the ball a majority of the time.  * Warriors - Was an even worse ran franchise in the 90's and early 00's than the clippers. It has since turned around and would be a good place to play.   * Washington DC - What was the last big time free agent the Wizards got? 36 year old Paul Pierce? It is not an attractive destination to free agents.  * Houston - Why would you go from a contender to the current state of affairs that is the Houston Rockets? (Obligatory FTR)  * Boston - Not a bad spot to go, but you have questions with the coaching and management now. Nothing to show they are a contender from their boat load of picks.  * Atlanta - Another team that was a dumpster fire in the past and is looking to turn the corner. Domestically, though Atlanta and Georgia has a ton of issues.  * Phoenix - Made a title run last year after being continuously bad throughout most of recent history.  * Detroit - Struggles to put people in the stands and the organization is dysfunctional.   Salt Lake City is a closer media market to No.3 Chicago than No.3 Chicago is to No.1 New York. Unless you are going to New York or LA, then market size doesn't mean as much as being in a better situation.   Now, as far as the free agency attraction factor. Every team struggles with that. The Knicks, Lakers, Clippers, &amp; Nets did not get Lebron when he left Cleveland the first time or left Miami or Durrant when he left okc. They went to better situations rather than markets.   Let's review the top $ FA's over the past five years, shall we.   **2021**   * Lowry (TOR - MIA) - Smaller Market  * DeRozan (SAS - CHI) - Bigger Market  * Ball (NO- CHI) - Bigger Market  * Markkanen (CHI-CLE) - Smaller Market  * Dinwiddle (BKN - WAS) - Smaller Market  **2020**  * Hayward (BOS - CHA) - Smaller Market  * Bogdanovic (SAC - ATL) - Bigger Market  * Gallinari (OKC - ATL) - Bigger Market  * Wood (DET - HOU) - Bigger Market  * Crowder (MIA - PHX) - Bigger Market  **2019**  * Durrant (GSW - BKN) - Bigger Market  * Walker (CHA - BOS) - Bigger Market  * Butler (PHI - MIA) - Smaller Market  * Russell (BKN - GSW) - Smaller Market  * Horford (BOS - PHI) - Smaller Market  **2018**  * James (CLE - LAL) Bigger Market  * Anderson (SAS - MEM) Smaller Market  * Jordan (LAC - DAL) Smaller Market  * McDermott (DAL - IND) Smaller Market  * Ilyasova (PHI - MIL) Smaller Market  **2017**  * Hayward (UTA - BOS) Bigger Market  * Reddick (LAC - PHI) Smaller Market  * Milsap (ATL - DEN) Smaller Market  * Teague (IND - MIN) Bigger Market  * Hill (UTA - SAC) Bigger Market  There are a few big names in here, but most of the guys on the list were overpaid to move and didn't make the team they went too a lot better. This year remains to be seen.   The mid tier free agents or sleepers are where any team can find players. And these players will go to any team that pays them the most.   A lot of player movement is done by trades and not the result of free agency. Teams generally fight to their talent or trade them away for compensation."
"Sure you can? I have yet to see ANYONE present an objective argument for why Lebron James should be above Jordan. He has less of everything essentially. Less MVP's, less championships, less FMVP's, less DPOY."
"AD was better last year, Wade was better in 2011, its not really debatable. That doesn't mean Lebron James hasn't been the best player on his team for almost his entire career, but he defintely wasn't those two years."
You mean the famous actor LeBron James widely recognized for his performance in space jam 2?
"Let me take the opportunity to restate this fact: After years of observation I am convinced that the average LeBron James fan has a mind that is approximately 1.25 to 1.80 times more impoverished than the average homo sapien's. Common traits are low intelligence, absence of introspection, and defective communication skills."
"I don't see Bosh at Pau's level.... but man, it's LeBron James. Kinda hard to pick almost any other combo unless you also make the second guy an high-level all-timer."

"LeBron James plays 40 games, Austin Rivers plays 82, Khris Middleton plays 58, how do you rank those players for that season? See, availability isn't how you grade the skill level of a player, it can only grade the impact they had on the team during the stretch you set out to look at, and even then availability only matters to an extent.  But regardless, this post isn't asking who was better last year, it's asking you to rank the players. Get your head out of your ass."
"Lebron James plays 45 games one season, Steph Curry Plays 20, Kevin Durant plays 82. All give their normal output in games played. How would you hypothetically rank them for that season?"

KD then joined steph the following year. You cannot be better than someone if this happens.   Steph won the chip against lebron james without KD. KD has not.   Steph revolutionized the game of basketball today.   Steph led the winningest team of all time. like yo, KD is really just another elite scorer like Tmac who went to an automatic ring situation, but we're going to crown him a goat for that?"
In what insane world is Damian Lillard better than LeBron James?
"&gt;Whether they‚Äôre cheering for me out of sarcasm or actual fandom or whatever it is, it comes with it‚Äù   I know that AC loves to prove people wrong, but I hope that he know that almost all Laker (and now Bulls) fans are cheering for him because of his selflessness, attitude, tenacity, IQ and hustle. LeBron didn't already ask for AC's jersey when the Lakers face the Bulls because it's funny. He asked for it because he respects and likes Caruso, and he knows what AC means to the Lakers. I also think that the majority of fans who follow the NBA, but aren't even fans of the Lakers or Bulls, now understand that he's a valuable role player.   During their postgame shows, Robert Horry and James Worthy have raved about AC for years. Horry has called Caruso ""my man ACFresh"" countless times. Vogel called Caruso ""an important part of our team who also happens to be an extra assistant coach."" As for Lonzo, he just called Caruso ""the perfect teammate.""   Caruso was so focused on the playoffs in the bubble that he simply sent his parents a short text telling them that he was starting game six. His Mom admitted that she felt slightly nervous when she found out that news, but Vogel said that he wasn't a bit nervous because starting AC was his checkmate move against the Heat. AC went out there and proved that Vogel was right.   If people are cheering for AC due to sarcasm, then they're underestimating him, and all that seems to do to give him more power.   &gt;‚ÄúI was a little surprised it was as loud when I first came in. I would like it to be a little more warranted with some success and winning. But hopefully we‚Äôll get to that point.‚Äù  Oh, just shut up, Alex, and just accept that fans love watching you. Well, most fans do anyway. There is this one podcaster in Houston..."
"Appearance does play a part in terms of how we gauge people and their overall likeability. Its not just him being white, its him being white and kinda... ordinary looking? Like obviously he's in really great shape but from the neck up I see a Caruso at every white family reunion I go to.  &amp;#x200B;  Him being ""sneaky athletic"", while playing in a big market, next to LeBron James, and looking like a kinda ordinary white dude all contribute to his memeability."

"LeBron James, Steph Curry and Draymond Green honestly.  Draymond already did a good job on inside and might be another controversial head who could back it up, while having a better understanding of the current game than Chuck, Shaq and Kenny.  Steph because he seems to have a great understanding of the game, same reason with LeBron. It's always a blast to hear players who understand the game to a high degree talk about it. Kobe was another example of that. I really loved listening to him when he talked about different parts of the game, and especially tactic."

"Not *the* saddest, but it hurt pretty bad to see IU grad and ‚ÄúThis Is My City‚Äù Victor Oladipo hugging &amp; laughing with the Heat players seconds after each of our 4 straight playoff losses in ‚Äò19. Then it broke shortly after that he was openly asking Heat players, and several other teams who didn‚Äôt make playoffs, to trade for him in front of his teammates.   Layer that in with how the year before in ‚Äò18 the [referees admitted they missed a game clenching goaltend on Lebron ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nba.com/news/nba-says-referees-missed-lebron-james-goaltending-call-game-5%3famp=1) vs the Heat.

"LeBron James.  He has been the unquestioned face of the NBA for nearly two decades.  He has always carried himself as a thoughtful person who, in addition to natural athletic talents, also has natural intelligence.  LeBron had no problem organizing support for black voters during the election.  He started a non-profit and talked about it a lot.  That was great.  But when a vaccine came out for the most damaging virus/pandemic any of us have ever known, LeBron punted.  He chickened out, over absolutely nothing with baseless reasoning, and was one of two guys on the Lakers who delayed getting their shot.  He only recently came out and said that he was vaccinated.  It is no surprise that the Black community in America is hesitant about the Covid vaccine.  And they have legitimate reasons to worry -- Tuskeegee is basically the first chapter of every medical ethics textbook about what not to do.  LeBron is possibly the most famous Black person alive.  He had the unique opportunity to come out directly and say ""I took the vaccine, and you should, too.""  Instead, he did the exact opposite.  And the country is still having a lot of trouble getting people in the Black community to take the vaccine.  It's infuriating and, while he was subject to some scrutiny, he should have been subject to much, much more.  The simple reality is that when you command that much influence, your actions have that much more severe consequences and implications.  He had a duty to be a positive voice for vaccination right from the start.  Duty failed."

As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."

"""The reason LeBron James, one of the greatest athletes with a near sterling reputation, raised 2 million dollars for charity, is because he didn't have a father figure in his life to lead him down the right path""  It checks out......"
"meh, this year LeBron has a ton of questions to answer too. Anyone who watched that PHX series (hopefully everyone did ITT because it was damn entertaining) saw that LeBron is starting to REALLY show signs of age now. He can hardly keep up with even average guards in speed. His explosiveness has really scaled back now, he's good for maybe 1 or 2 explosive plays a game now and afterwards you're able to see how exhausted he is. With that said, he is probably the best floor general in the league now which is what people aren't talking up for some reason. LeBron is still very good, he isn't good enough to be a teams reliable #1 scorer. He needs better athletes around him to do the heavy duty work while he focuses on shooting, passing, running the floor, etc.  Also it doesn't get mentioned that..it was LeBron James time to really shine out there and he posted a career low in PPG for a playoff performance."

Because lebron is no longer in China.   Morey got his family former US special forces the day he made the tweet. The only reason LeBRON James was involved was because he was in China and his life was at risk along with a few hundred players and employees. Lebrons criticism of Morey only makes sense once you realize that Morey was setting them up.
LeBron James
"He is referencing what Lebron said to media about Morey's tweet that said ""Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong."":  &gt;""I don't want to get into a [verbal] feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke,"" James said before the Los Angeles Lakers played the Golden State Warriors in a preseason game at Staples Center. ""And so many people could have been harmed not only financially, physically, emotionally, **spiritually**. So just be careful what we tweet and say and we do, even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too."""
Ben Simmons is wayyyy better than Lebron James at this point and time
"You think Lebron James, Taco Tuesday, Spacejam 2, Trainwreck, The Shop, King of dramatic tweets and on court theatrics LEBRON JAMES did the show with charity in mind as the ‚Äúwhole reason‚Äù???"
Every job doesn't require you to be the less than 1% in the world at what you do either. You could also make the argument that some players are underpaid. Like a Lebron James is easily worth more than he's current contract but because there is an arbitrary salary cap there's a limit on what he can earn. Why is it that the NBA and NFL have salary caps but MLB does not.
"Please read this comment from a Celtics fan and let me know your thoughts.  ‚ÄúAbsolutely it's a fair assessment and anybody saying different is trying to fool themselves. People trying to play it off like ""nobody cares this much about the lakers"" is laughable. They're by far the biggest team in basketball. They have lebron james on top of multiple hall of famers who carry enormous name value still. The players on the other team know this. The fans definitely know this. Playing the lakers isn't just ""1 of 82"" or whatever. It's something you plan your day around, and in my case as a celtics fan, my entire week around.  Want proof? Here's the total comments on the game threads for the teams the lakers have played so far compared to their other 2 or 3 games...  Grizzlies vs lakers game thread comments: 1,079  Grizzlies vs clippers game thread comments: 502  Grizzlies vs cavs game thread comments: 491  Suns vs lakers game thread comments: 2,138  Suns vs blazers game thread comments: 786  Warriors vs lakers game thread comments: 5,653  Warriors vs clippers game thread comments: 3733  So if the lakers are ""just another game"" why do they bring by far the most activity in opponents game threads? And like op said the arenas are always sold out which brings an energy to the game that you won't get another team. So yea I do think the lakers get the opponent's best every night whether they're the champs or not, and whether the fans want to admit it or not.‚Äù"

"Absolutely, for example Messi made $673 million on a 4 year contract for Barcelona mainly because of value he brought to the club. LeBron James in an open market would easily be $100+ million a year and Giannis's value would definitely be $80 million or above especially in Milwaukee where they would do everything in their power to keep him"
Enes Kanter is a much better person than lebron james
"That would be the best outcome in terms of positive publicity and autonomy to pursue endorsements, etc. But then again, teams like OSU, UCLA, or even Duke/Kentucky might bet the farm on the marketing opportunities that come with having ""LeBron James"" on their teams, even just for a year."
Did you consult professor LeBron James before forming your opinion?
Lebron James is beside himself
Don‚Äôt act like almost every single nba team won‚Äôt offer a max contract to superstars like lebron james and AD lol. Pelicans tried to pay the crap outta AD but he wanted out.

"only when we are winning - LeBron ""LeGOAT"" James"
"I think my favorite post-2000 ones besides what you listed are:  Gilbert Arenas - Agent Zero  Kobe - Black Mamba  Jokic - Big Honey and Joker are both great  Curry - Chef Curry, The Baby Faced Assassin  Kyrie - Uncle Drew   Lebron - King James  Paul Pierce - The Truth  Dwyane Wade - Flash  Jonathan Simmons - Juice"
Harden was with the Rockets for 8 years that's more than LeBron or KD. How long did you want James to stay in Houston? Forever? If you're gonna set a standard at least be consistent.
It's not really a comparable situation. He's freakin LeBron James.
r/nba hates no man like they do LeBron James
"My older sister studied at Duke so we‚Äôre naturally avid fans of its basketball program‚Ä¶ man I would definitely want to see Bronny in a Duke jersey. You‚Äôre right, he wouldn‚Äôt be getting as much attention if he weren‚Äôt the son of Lebron James but Duke also probably accepted my application because of my sister so you decide‚Ä¶  I mean it would be great for ratings and he would advance his skills incredibly under Coach K. Worse players have been part of Duke‚Äôs program idk."
"What is he gonna do? What is he gonna do that he wasn't able to do with James Harden? With PG and Melo the first time? With Kevin Durant? With Bradley Beal?   He can't shoot. He still can't shoot. He's gonna win games for sure but how much will it matter in the playoffs when this is the same Lakers team that sagged off of him during the Bubble Run.  The only way I see him get busy is when you make him the 6th man and he plays with Monk, Melo, Dwight and Ariza while AD and LeBron are on the bench. Even then his shooting inability is a detriment to winning basketball. Even then, I don't think that's possible coz why you paying this dude who never learns $40M as the 6th man."
My lineup of these players would be this:  PG: Ben Simmons and Steph Curry(pretty obvious)  SG: James Harden and Jrue Holiday(Again pretty obvious)  SF: LeBron James and Kevin Durant(maybe the most and least ball dominant superstars)   PF: Kristaps Porzingis and Zion(Guy who is 7 foot but only takes jumpers vs. guy who isn't but scores everything at the rim)  C: Jokic and Embiid(Great playmaker meh defender vs. great defender meh playmaker)
No one could hear you over everyone telling us that Luka Doncic was BETTER than Lebron James
KD is the Lebron James of basketball and I cannot be convinced otherwise.
Over billionaire father/gentleman Lebron James?  Maybe.  Over first stint Cleveland athletic God James?  Tough sell.

"I watched a ton of Lebron James games in 2017-2018 and the one thing that kept sticking out to me was that he was not going out of his way to make great plays. He racked up a lot of points from mid-range jump shots and that isn't really impressive.   Harden did it all - 3 point shots, dunk in your face, great passer, fast paced player, etc."
People used to call Lebron Leflop until a certain someone started having MVP caliber seasons.  Not gonna say any names *cough* James Harden.

"wrong. Lebron never asked for spo to be fired. Riley said this himself  &gt; ""Not from him to me, ever,"" Riley said Thursday of James, who left the Heat two seasons ago in free agency to return to Cleveland. ""So a lot of stuff is following him out the door. Whether it's right or wrong, it's just the nature of it. **But as far as that goes, no, he never, ever walked in and said anything.""**  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/14669732/miami-heat-president-pat-riley-says-lebron-james-never-asked-erik-spoelstra-fired  But he did ask Pat if he was ever interested in returning to coach in 2010. This was during 2010 free agency, and when they started 9-8. Spo back then wasn't the coach he is now, wade even says this.   &gt; ‚ÄúAnd I remember LeBron looking at me, and he said, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt you ever get the itch?‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòThe itch for what?‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòThe itch to coach again?‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòNo, I don‚Äôt have the itch.‚Äô He didn‚Äôt ask any more questions, and I didn‚Äôt offer any more answers. But I know what it meant, and I always go back and wonder about what he was thinking at that time. He walked out scratching his leg like it was itching.‚Äù  &gt; **‚ÄúThe thought was in their mind at times that maybe I would come back and coach, I think.** But I was truly done, I didn‚Äôt want to get back into it, and Erik is a hell of a coach. He was coming off two good playoff years, but he had not been coaching three superstars. And then with the whole LeBron effect, it would have been a tough transition for any head coach with two years of experience.‚Äù  https://heatnation.com/media/pat-riley-reveals-lebron-james-wanted-erik-spoelstra-fired-2010/"
"I'm not the one calling anyone an easy W, especially a team with LeBron James on it. That right there is delusion"
"I found the full quote I think you're talking about:  &gt;‚ÄúWhen guys are making the same mistakes over and over and over, it‚Äôs hard to bite your tongue,‚Äù Rondo says, ‚Äúbut I tried to get \[James\] to focus on his body language ‚Ä¶ Those young guys were looking at everything he did. If they missed four shots in a row and LeBron was making a face, it was crushing to them. He was their Michael Jordan. They didn‚Äôt want to let him down. But if LeBron said one thing positive to Brandon Ingram or Kyle Kuzma, they immediately were back to their old selves.‚Äù  I would say that's talking LeBron into refining his demeanor with his younger teammates to a top level, rather than, ""Rondo was on record saying he was constantly calling out LeBron about his attitude.""  I'm also curious about the other dude's cited article about LeBron apparently doing antics that almost got him removed from Olympics consideration one year, as there was no detail about what exactly he was doing.  I presume whatever it was didn't demoralize teammates and relegated to off-court shenanigans, as even in his first Cavs stint the players were much better with him than after he left."
"LeBron did this with the 2017 Cavs too, it was better but still a very shitty plan. And now he is doing exactly the same thing but there is no one in the Lakers front office saying ""LeBron stop, we are in charge here"" only because he is LeBron James.  No offence but that's why I hate the Lakers as a whole, everything about them yells ""spoiled"". Does the front office believe that they can bring anyone cuz they are the Lakers? Spoiled. Can a franchise player not discuss and recommend but dictate who to sign? Spoiled. Are most Laker fans are toxic as fuck and poke their nose everywhere in the NBA with an NBA=Lakers mentality? Yes? Spoiled."
"He took two plays off, one of which should have been a fast break and got broken up. And he's suddenly putting in *zero* effort?  And Cam Payne being gifted a career by CP3 gives him the go ahead to talk shit to....LeBron James? When he had 4 points in the game?   Lmao what???"
They are on pace for 0 wins. I would be surprised if he got a vote honestly. Going through mvp votes year by year not even Michael Jordan could get a vote in a 0 win season. Kareem has 6 mvps but never managed to get a vote in a 0 win season. Shaq had one of the most dominant peaks in history and he still didn't get a vote in a 0 win season. Lebron James is the greatest of his generation and is currently on pace for a 0 win season yet no sniffs of a vote. Bill Russell is the greatest champion of all time and still wasn't able to get a vote in a 0 win season.
They're gonna make a last dance documentary with Lebron James
C‚Äômon now use common sense. One team has arguably the greatest player of all time and the other has Lebron James.
"Obviously talking out of my ass with zero actual experience of what it's like to be around LeBron James, but it's always seemed like LeBron is fun to be around *if* you're ready to *always* have him be the center of attention at all times and *always* be ready to laugh at whatever he's saying on any given day.  People say he's a funny guy, but he's always seemed to be, like, that *loud funny* guy, you know what I mean? More of the ""look at me"" style class clown than that guy who can just drop a one-liner at dinner that has you in tears."
"&gt; No, you don't get to say that and be Lebron James.  Is what you said... and now you say,  &gt;I didn't say Lebron made the excuse  Those two statements are not compatible."

"Candace Parker was packing her bags Wednesday afternoon, prepping for an early evening flight out of Chicago to her home in Los Angeles. She was wrapping up a memorable, whirlwind few days. On Sunday Parker, who grew up in the Chicago suburb of Naperville, Ill., led the Chicago Sky to the franchise‚Äôs first-ever WNBA championship; the Sky defeated the Phoenix Mercury 80-74, to win the WNBA Finals 3-1. Parker, 35, had spent her entire 13-year WNBA career with the Los Angeles Sparks before signing with her hometown team in February, with the goal of bringing a title to Chicago. She delivered‚Äîand then got to unwind a little. Parker pulled up to the drive-thru at Portillo‚Äôs, a favorite Chicago-based hot dog joint, for a jumbo chili cheese dog and fish sandwich on Sunday night. The team was feted at a championship parade and pep rally on Tuesday; Barack Obama called to congratulate Parker and her teammates afterward. Now, real-life beckoned. Following the parade, Parker dropped off her daughter Lailaa, who just started seventh grade, at the airport Tuesday. Though she signed with Chicago, Parker kept her home in Los Angeles, and Lailaa still goes to school there. ‚ÄúShe looked at me and like, you have one day to get back,‚Äù Parker says. Thus, she was furiously packing on Wednesday, to be back in time to take Lailaa to class on Thursday morning. ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs the life of a mom that just won a WNBA championship,‚Äù Parker says. Parker‚Äôs used to the busy motherhood balancing act: Lailaa was born in 2009, after Parker‚Äôs rookie season in Los Angeles, when she won both the WNBA Rookie of the Year and MVP Awards, to go along with an Olympic gold medal that summer in Beijing. Parker, a two-time high school national player of the year who became the first female to win the dunk contest at the McDonald‚Äôs All-American Game, is a six-time WNBA All-Star, and two-time WNBA MVP; she clinched her second WNBA title, to go along with her two Olympic golds (not to mention the back-to-back NCAA titles she won in 2007 and 2008 at the University of Tennessee). Her full-circle, heart-warming title for the Windy City comes at an opportune time for the WNBA, which enjoyed a banner 25th season and is growing in popularity, thanks to players like Parker. As an analyst for the NBA‚Äôs widely watched programs‚Äîshe‚Äôll be back at work, fresh off the title, early next week, as the 2021-2022 NBA season tipped off on Tuesday night‚ÄîParker‚Äôs work is now familiar to a wider swath of sports fans. Due to her on-court excellence and her conversational, analytic on-air presence, Parker‚Äôs emerged as one of the most influential figures in her sport. Read more: Candace Parker on Voting Rights In an interview during a brief packing break on Wednesday, Parker put on her analyst cap to break down what this second WNBA title means for her career. ‚ÄúYou can mess around and do stuff one time, and people can doubt it,‚Äù Parker says. ‚ÄúBut if you do something twice, it‚Äôs not by accident. So I‚Äôve said, from the time I was at Tennessee, in order for my name to be mentioned with the greatest players at Tennessee, I have to win twice. So I do think this was a legacy-defining moment.‚Äù One that was so much sweeter‚Äîand memorable‚Äîsince she won in Chicago. ‚ÄúI just remember watching ‚ÄòBron [LeBron James] when he won in Cleveland,‚Äù says Parker. James, who‚Äôs from Akron, Ohio, returned to the Cavaliers from Miami in 2014 and led his team a title two years later, ending Cleveland‚Äôs 52-year championship drought. ‚ÄúJust the emotion and how it hit him. And I don‚Äôt think it was until yesterday when I realized, ‚Äòman, I went home and we won.‚Äô I don‚Äôt know if I fully grasped what all of this means.‚Äù The Sky finished just 16-16 in the regular season and entered the playoffs as a sixth seed; Parker had injured her ankle earlier in the season and missed eight games; Chicago finished 1-7 during that stretch. ‚ÄúI went out to LA and really thought I got Hollywood,‚Äù Parker says. ‚ÄúAnd couldn‚Äôt, you know, be gritty and play defense and rebound and all those things we did this year. It was so hard. That‚Äôs why I love it so much.‚Äù WNBA boom Parker‚Äôs buzzy Finals win followed some key victories for the WNBA this season. Google signed on as a sponsor. The league inked a multi-year deal with Amazon Prime Video to become the first women‚Äôs pro sports league streamed on the service. On WNBAStore.com, the league‚Äôs regular-season merchandise sales jumped 50% over the prior year, a record growth. The Sky has sold more merchandise on Fanatics than any prior WNBA champion, according to the Sports Business Journal. Regular season viewership was up 51% over last year; it was the league‚Äôs most-viewed season for national TV partners in 13 years. The Finals series between the Sky and Mercury drew an average of 548,000 viewers, up 23% from a year ago; these were the most-viewed WNBA playoffs since 2014. June 2009 -10 Questions for Candace Parker 0 seconds of 4 minutes, 49 secondsVolume 0% Changing societal attitudes are driving this growth, says Parker. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre filled with a league that people before were scared of,‚Äù says Parker. ‚ÄúLike, women should be in this place. I don‚Äôt fit that. I‚Äôve never fit that. I don‚Äôt want to fit that. I don‚Äôt want my daughter to think she has to fit that.‚Äù As people grow more attuned to the benefits of diversity, the WNBA will remain well-positioned to expand. ‚ÄúCompanies, and actually consumers, are demanding that they are represented by women,‚Äù says Parker. ‚ÄúWe are a league that is the majority of the minority in this world. I say that in the sense of race, sexuality, gender, all of that. So we‚Äôre what all companies want and need.‚Äù Tokyo Olympics: Sue Bird 0 seconds of 2 minutes, 56 secondsVolume 0% Back to work Parker will now turn her attention to the NBA; in March, a TNT clip of Parker explaining to Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal the nuances of playing defense in the modern NBA‚Äîwhere nearly every player on the court, no matter his size, can make a long-range shot‚Äîwent viral. ‚ÄúCandace Parker Schools Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal‚Äù read one typical headline. Such banter with Shaq, says Parker, happens all the time. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how it is back in the green room,‚Äù Parker says. ‚ÄúWhen we‚Äôre watching television, me and D-Wade [Dwyane Wade] are trying to explain to Shaq something. We‚Äôre arguing with his viewpoint. ‚ÄòWell, when I used to do this.‚Äô Like, Shaq, you were seven feet. Literally, all you had to do was throw the ball down to you and you score. Other people aren‚Äôt like that. It‚Äôs hilarious and I love him.‚Äù She‚Äôs been tracking the two biggest storylines entering the 2021-2022 season: the refusal of Brooklyn Nets superstar Kyrie Irving to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, and Ben Simmons‚Äô standoff with the Philadelphia 76ers. Under New York City law, Irving can‚Äôt play in Brooklyn‚Äôs home games unless he receives the vaccine: the Nets have essentially benched Irving until he complies. ‚ÄúI do believe we are honestly at a point now where, as Chuck [Charles Barkley] said, you do get vaccines for others,‚Äù says Parker, who is vaccinated. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fault the Brooklyn Nets at all. We want you here, but you can‚Äôt be here partially. It‚Äôs all or nothing when you‚Äôre trying to win a championship.‚Äù Read more: Nike Stays Silent On Kyrie Irving‚Äôs Anti-Vaccine Stance Parker‚Äôs more sympathetic toward Simmons. After Philadelphia lost in the playoffs to Atlanta last year, Sixers teammate Joel Embiid called Simmons out for passing up a shot in Game 7 of that second-round series; Simmons‚Äô coach, Doc Rivers, said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know the answer to that‚Äù when asked, after Game 7, if Simmons could be a point guard on a championship team. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm big on keeping internal difficulties internal,‚Äù says Parker. ‚ÄúSo to hear your coach say that, how do you recover from that?‚Äù Simmons held out of training camp and was kicked out of practice this week for refusing to engage; the three-time All-Star was suspended for Philadelphia‚Äôs season opener on Wednesday. ‚ÄúI was young once, and it‚Äôs very hard to tolerate and handle an organization that doesn‚Äôt have your back,‚Äù says Parker. ‚ÄúThere are not many people in that situation that would handle it at 20-whatever years old professionally. I just think that it‚Äôs done. It‚Äôs a divorce that needs to happen.‚Äù She‚Äôll start opining in the NBA TV studio on Monday. But what Parker really wants to do is lounge on a Mexican beach. ‚ÄúI love the balancing act,‚Äù Parker says of her multiple high-profile gigs. ‚ÄúIt does get a little bit tiring, just because there‚Äôs so much emotion and energy that goes into winning a championship. You just have that crash. But I‚Äôll get it together.‚Äù Mexico can wait. If a basketball is bouncing these days, Candace Parker will be there."
"David Robinson, Kevin Garnett, Anthony Davis, LeBron James."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World‚Ñ¢, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"Absolutely not, they have LeBron James and Anthony Davis on their team.  The fact that they even traded for Westbrook in the first place was absolutely dumb."
"The fact Westbook played at an elite level for 10 years is amazing since his game is based largely on his athleticism and speed. He is 33 his year, Carmelo was in OKC when he was 33 and out of the league a 34 (for a year) and went on ESPN to beg for a job. Him not being MVP Westbrook at 33 doesn't prove anything. Most players do not age like LeBron James."
"Yeah, came here to say this. Westbrook just looks entirely out of place and he‚Äôs getting targeted on defense on top of that now. I‚Äôve heard people talk about how maybe the answer is to play him with the 2nd team mostly but I think that‚Äôs flawed because‚Ä¶  - Westbrook has to buy into that and aside from the reality that that situation will be the only way he‚Äôd be able to have a lockdown grip on the offense, he‚Äôs also been a first team guy all his career.  - Who are you closing out games with? If it‚Äôs Westbrook I don‚Äôt see how he just magically becomes a fit with AD and LeBron in the last 8 minutes of a game.  - They‚Äôre giving Carmelo Anthony a lot of second team minutes and even a squad of backups playing against a team with both Westbrook and Anthony on the court at the same time will feast on the offensive end.  They‚Äôll figure something over the next 80 games I‚Äôm sure but‚Ä¶ what? It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs going to suddenly start shooting well from 3 or being an effective roll man on picks after never ever doing that before in his career. And in the half court offense, who would you really rather run the offense through, LeBron or Russell? Even when they were both in their primes the answer was clearly James."
"I'm sorry I don't even know how to sit here and listen to a Laker fan talk about how Damian Lillard isn't a better player than Paul George ffs.  He has consistently lost to better TEAMS in the west.  It so happens that many of those teams went on to win the chip. We're not talking about one-on-one basketball here. Damian has thoroughly been let down by roster building and depth problems (injuries to starters) here throughout his entire career. To say Damian wasn't as good as Lebron or Steph is obvious. But you can't just leave it at that. Not only did he go up against teams with those players but those teams had on balance much better players than we did.  Last season Denver was missing Murray sure. But they still had Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon. Obviously Jokic was MVP. At every position they're a better team except starting PG.  Obviously vs the Lakers in 19-20 it was the weird bubble situation and we lost to Anthony Davis, LeBron James, etc. LeBron is obviously a better basketball player than maybe anyone on the planet ever when he tries. But take him out of the equation and you have better players at most of the other roster spots...and that doesn't really even matter when you have Anthony Davis AND LeBron.  18-19 was one of his losses to the Warriors after being exhausted and injured he had next to nothing left to carry our team further. And we went up against the fucking GSW with a healthy Steph, Klay, Dray. Shit, we made Kevon Looney look GOOD because we were left starting ENES KANTER at center with Nurk being injured (AGAIN). Yes, Steph is a better player than Damian, no argument there but the rest of the roster is again better at most every position. Klay is better than CJ, Dray better than Maurice Harkless or Al-Farouq Aminu. We got heavy minutes and production out of multiple guys who aren't even in the league anymore 2 years later ffs (Aminu and Meyers Leonard notably).  Could go all the way back through each series and point out how we lost to better teams. Damian might not be the best player in the series (though it could be argued that he was against Denver last year, even though we lost). But the fact remains that he is an incredible top All-NBA level talent that is consistently surrounded by scrubs and Neil Olshey's inability to build a complete team and bring in top level talent to surround him is why we keep losing to these other teams that have done just that for their respective stars. We haven't had a second all-star on the team since LMA left in 2015-16 offseason and outside of that we haven't even managed to put together solid consistent role players. It's a mess."
There are 7 players with a GOAT claim.  That's tier 1.  This nonsense that only MJ and Lebron have a claim is a reflection of how many casuals they attract to the discussion.  Each of those 7 has a claim but there are also reasons why they aren't a clear number 1.  There's no right answer but rather a pick your flavor element involved.  You can build your team around any one of them and find the highest level of basketball.     Alcindor  Bird  Duncan  James  Johnson  Jordan  Russell
"Kevin Garnett, LeBron James (first Cleveland stint), Tyreke Evans, Marvin Bagley III, Karl Towns, Markelle Fultz (Philadelphia). Zion Williamson might be next"
"Lakers will be a playoff team simply because we have Lebron James, but we aren't the championship contenders that a lot of ""experts"" thought we would be."
Lebron James. You have that guy on a rookie contract and couldn‚Äôt trade for some players to be around him?  He should‚Äôve won at least 1-2 titles before he left for the heat.
Why are people surprised that Lebron James mentally checks out of games?? Oh idk maybe because nobody does that shit
"He's not telling him to be humble in general.   He's basically saying ""You're Cam Payne. I'm Lebron James. It's game 2 of the season."""
"""LEBRON JAMES WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE"""
This is perfect example of why you want Michael Jordan and not Lebron James to play the Monstars for the fate of the planet.
"Believe it or not Lebron James. If he was drafted by a competent franchise he would for damn sure have more than 4 rings. He spent 11 years in Cleveland, and basically his entire prime there outside his 4 Miami seasons. And what does he have to show for it? 1 ring because the Cavs are one of the worst run franchises ever."
Things like this are why so many people can‚Äôt stand the basketball player that is LeBron James.
"I feel like if your team has LeBron James and Anthony Davis, and you start to wonder ‚Äúdo we need to build this team after someone else,‚Äù then something is wrong"
"and if ya didn't know lebron james is fucking lebron james. The guy has [""jew money""](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46671819)"
I heard Lebron gave Lee Harvey Oswald and James Wilkes Booth their guns too.

"They can‚Äôt run a lineup that maximizes Westbrook, at least not without sacrificing defense.   They could run Westbrook - Ellington - Monk - James - Davis.   That would maximize the space Westbrook has to operate. But that‚Äôs a leaky backcourt, and an undersized SF.   But even if the Lakers wanted to make trades to accommodate Westbrook, they have few assets to work with. Plus, he‚Äôs not the player they should be looking to maximize. That‚Äôs Lebron."
I could never support a team whose star player is Lebron James who is known to playing dirty. He purposely took Crowder‚Äôs landing space from below him last night on that 3‚Ä¶  Lol that‚Äôs exactly how you‚Äôre corny ass sounds
Lebron James has entered the transfer portal.
"1st seed like the Jazz last year, it means nada.  I watched &amp; neither him or AD were going to finish the season healthy they blew their loads chasing 1st seed.  Feb right before the shutdown Lebron was already missing games.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.upi.com/amp/Sports_News/NBA/2020/02/27/Lakers-star-LeBron-James-to-miss-matchup-vs-Warriors-with-sore-groin/5781582770947/  AD?  Never played a full year our West."
"I think he is. Dude is a bad off ball defender and is late in transition D. He also is inefficient shooting the ball. Russell Westbrook going 100% speed is the only good thing about him in offense (its the only good thing he does on offense other than the obvious kickout to the open man) and even then his passes are reckless and so are his handles. He's a point guard yet I don't trust him in handling the ball compared to other elite point guards. Dude is too reckless and that's just not good.   Don't get me wrong he has upside, but his downsides overweigh what he can give to the Lakers team. He can't shoot. He still can't shoot. He's been traded three times now and for a good reason.   What's he gonna do now that he didn't do with James Harden? With PG and Melo the first time? With Kevin Durant? With Bradley Beal? This is the same Lakers team that left him wide open during the Bubble when they eliminated the Rockets. What's he gonna do? Tell me? Distribute the ball and kick it out? How many times will he turnover the ball? And if he does, do you really want LeBron and AD be spot up shooters for him? How many times will he shoot an unnecessary jumper?"

"No, you don't get to say that and be Lebron James.      That isn't me hating on Lebron James. It's not me saying the rest of the players are playing well. It's just that when you are an MVP candidate and a top 5 player in the league, you don't get to say ""My teammates are why we were down by 30 in the third quarter of a home game""       That isn't working for Embid, Jokic, Giannis, Durant. . . That excuse just isn't there for you.      I'm not someone saying the seasons over. I don't like the Lakers roster construction, but I think they'll get better. There is a lot of talent there and because it's the Lakers, they'll be kings of the buyout market like always. I just don't want to hear that excuse. Not for him."
Can someone please explain if the raptors have Jordan or Lebron James.
"It's not just this piece; there were quite a few reports calling out Lebron's attitude and behavior on Team USA pre-2008 Olympics:  * [Bruce Bowen apparently called him out at for disrespecting Team USA staff members](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2007-05-28-0705270429-story.html) * [Coach K talking about calling out Lebron for turning his back on coach when being talked to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGcvxgkPOso) * [Olympic Director Colangelo irked by Lebron's wishy-washiness in committing to Team USA](https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=2824500) * [Three assistant coaches for Team USA wanted to cut LeBron from the team](https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/2699/lebrattitude-king-james-had-his-moments-with-team-usa)  By the time Beijing rolled around Lebron definitely took it to heart and matured into a leader for the team, but on pre-2008 Team USA, Lebron's attitude was definitely a significant concern. You didn't really see any reports like this for anybody else on the Olympic team."
"I don't disagree with the premise but that's just not how Sports/ Barbershop talk is, and yes it's a bunch of hypotheticals we don't know how 1991 Michael Jordan would do against 2017 Kevin Durant, we don't know how 2018 LeBron James would do against 1974 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,  etc., however we can use the data provided, accomplishments we do have and context and have debates about the whole thing, at the end of the day it's good harmless fun"
his name is LeBron James
"In my sim league back when Jimmy was on the 6ers, in(my headcanon) response to KD resigning with the Warriors, LeBron joined the 76ers on a 3 year 24 million dollar deal.  Yes, AI LeBron James took 8 mill a year to try to compete with the KD Warriors"
"Like it or not, the GOAT conversation is not just about stats and titles. It‚Äôs about fame, narrative, and popular mythology. Lebron will never catch up to Jordan on that count. To be the ‚ÄúMichael Jordan‚Äù of a field is to be the undisputed greatest. Nobody ever says that so and so is the Lebron James of their profession."
"Ben Simmons is faking mental health issues to get HIS way and it‚Äôs obvious.   But I do agree Lebron James, Steph, Dame are all great role models. I shouldn‚Äôt even have to say I didn‚Äôt mean every single nba player but you can‚Äôt act like some of these guys don‚Äôt act like overgrown rich teenagers."
"This is why Lakers fans are annoying. ""Somehow"". Hmm I wonder what that somehow was.. Maybe it had something to do with getting Lebron James out of thin air and then a top 3 big man out of thin air. Both choosing a team so incompetent they couldn't form a playoff team in five years with like 5 top 10 picks. The Washington generals could win a NBA championship with that kinda entitlement. And that's all the Lakers have. Entitlement. Superficial team in the superficial capital of the world"
"So this is probably my favorite wade moment of all time. It's 2009, the heat are playing the cavs. LeBron James gets the ball and tries to dunk on Jermaine O'Neal... He fails.... Wade gets the ball off the rebound and charges towards the rim on the other end. Verajao is waiting for him. Wade jumps, Verajao jumps.... Verajao is put on a poster. Wade one hands it all in his grill and then stomps out to the crowd saying 'that's how you do it!""  Not a wade fan per se, but in that moment I was like"" I think wade is better than lebron"". The next year when they joined forces baffled me to no end. We lost out on a great basketball rivalry"

unpopular opinion : I just support Lebron James
"Without Lebron James, Kyrie Irving would never come close to sniffing a ring. Are we really gonna say Kyrie is better because he was on a team that got to the finals because the East was terrible and he's on Lebron's team? Dame has carried the Blazers in a way Kyrie has repeatedly proven he is completely incapable of doing as the number one guy. Just stop it."
There are a lot of fake tough guys in the league. One of it is LeBron James.

This is awesome. I hate how Lebron James is always completely silent when it comes to CHINA because of the money he makes.
LeBron James*
"Love how you are getting downvoted  This is a distraction to the team despite their record  All the players would much rather have a guy that can contribute than a constant media shit-storm  The fans will never accept Ben back and if somehow both parties agree to let the guy play the fans will crucify him  If the team decides he can just sit in street clothes it will also be a distraction bc the fans will harass him. No matter how much the players hate Simmons they arent going to sit by and listen to that shit.  There has been precedent for issues like this, Lakers paid Luol Deng 17M to sit at home instead of even showing up for practice.  Simmons already has 1/4 of his salary paid (8M) out of 33M  That's a pretty substantial loss from the pockets of the owners.  All this shit doesnt make sense - if the Celtics rumor is true, the Sixers need to trade him Jaylen Brown ASAP before it's too late.  Celtics string together a nice little win streak and Brad Stevens will never trade him.  As for all the people in this thread saying that the players will not have Simmons back during the next CBA - it's quite the opposite.  NBA teams can make promises and rescind them without any consequences.  Look at Blake Griffin, they hung a fake banner with his name on it and said he will be part of the franchise forever. They even compared him to MLK in a fucking video presentation.  Shortly after they sent him to one of the worst teams in the league in a city that is cold (and shitty when compared to living in LA).  Players took note of that. Yeh Blake got paid, but he signed his big deal with the expectation that he would stay in LA. Otherwise he would have chosen a different team that actually wanted him.  The Clippers ended up on top in that deal at the expense of Blake Griffin.  So players will think, why shouldnt we support Ben when owners can trade players for no reason - sometimes just to clear cap space.  To me, both parties look terrible in this situation, but Simmons asked to be traded 4+ months ago. In the history of the NBA when has this happened, maybe with Vince Carter or Alonzo Mourning, but i cant think of any other instance.  People's memories are short - they seem to forget how badly Kobe fucked over a small market team by forcing a trade from the Hornets to the Lakers.   Simmons is a piece of shit for not working on his game but not for requesting a trade - his coach and fellow superstar threw him under the bus and basically blamed the series loss on Simmons. And while Simmons lack of offense in the 4th destroyed the Sixers, he did play some pretty solid defense throughout the playoffs.  Morey needs to trade Ben, get some value back, and both parties need to move forward.  As for the whole mental health argument, it is valid. No one can quantify mental health, unlike Kawhi's injury where multiple doctors cleared him and he still refused to report - again people's memories are short. Kawhi was the team's only superstar at that point and he tried over and over to force a trade out of San Antonio.  Being forced to play in a city that hates your guts (and has some of the harshest fans in the league), being forced to play with teammates and a coach that blamed you for the loss in the playoffs (despite it being a team sport - as if he was the only one to blame for losing to an inferior team) - all those things can take a toll on someone and make them depressed.  Funny how everyone takes Love seriously when he says he is depressed despite being in one of the best roles in the league - multiple finals trips, a championship, while playing next to LeBron James. If Love can be depressed in that great situation, why cant Ben Simmons be depressed or mentally distraught when the whole city of Philadelphia, his coach, and his teammates hates his guts.  Im not even a Sixers fan or a Sixers hater, Pistons / Lakers fan here, but what they are putting Simmons thru is straight bullshit.  If Morey hadnt held off on trading his younger players, he could have gotten Harden for Simmons + youth/picks and with the way the playoffs went last year the Sixers most likely would have won a championship.  Doc Rivers and Embiid tanked his value instead of praising him for his positives - they easily could have said ""Everyone has a rough series, but Ben Simmons is a great talented player and he will come back stronger next season"" But they didnt and now his value is shit and that's on nobody but Morey and the Sixers coach/Embiid.  Trade the motherfucker and move forward.  People are right, the players will throw a fit in the next CBA meeting, but it will be in favor of Simmons. No one is going to throw a player under the bus for wanting to leave a bad situation.  Surprised so much hate and vitriole is being directed at Simmons when there have been 100s of players who collected checks for sitting at home and not even bother contributing.  Even if the Sixers are the #1 seed in the East going into the All-Star break it just doesnt make sense not to get some kind of value for Simmons. Whoever they get back will help reduce the minutes of their top players, thus saving them and their health for the playoffs.  Ill get downvoted but i dont give a fuck"
Why would you want them to award him MVP when there‚Äôs better candidates? What was his nearest miss‚Ä¶.2018? When James Harden averaged 30 a game and won 66 games in the same conference as the KD Warriors‚Ä¶while Lebron was on a 4th seed. Harden wasn‚Äôt a better player than Lebron but Harden fit the clear historical MVP criteria to a T unlike Lebron (best stats on a top 2-3 seed with context such as superteam/injuries included)
"You replied to a comment which directly linked horribly racist tweets and insults toward LeBron James and you denied it‚Äôs existence or severity because you claimed to have ‚Äúscrolled through for 5 minutes‚Äù and didn‚Äôt see anything for yourself. Great.  I am listening to myself. My statement stands. It is a shame. I don‚Äôt want to share the same air or society as the people who wrote those tweets or anyone with your thought process. Sorry if that offends you, it‚Äôs how I feel and you should know that.   Those people that wrote those tweets to / about LeBron are disgusting and anyone who even remotely tries to defend or sympathize with that is also disgusting. For you to speak on any idea of downplaying that whatsoever when it‚Äôs objective truth (the racist tweets are literally linked multiple times) is completely ridiculous and therefore I assume you must be a racist or a closet racist / sympathizer. Be clear, this has literally nothing to do with you disagreeing with me. You are a nobody on Reddit, it‚Äôs not that deep to me, I pinky promise. I just hate racists (:"
we now have proof lebron james is skum
"The Lakers print money. Letting him go to avoid a big tax hit is something you do when you're not, you know, trying to maximize the remaining productive years of LeBron James"
Lebron James will not sign with Memphis Grizzlies.
"Such a stupid take, he's already brought a championship. They're going to be competitive every year he's there. No sane fan is pissed off at LeBron James for what he's brought to their team."
"We know that based on like 6 games together? Idk man, in 2019 Russ averaged 27 7 and 7 playing with James Harden and a small ball lineup, he cut down his threes like halfway through the season and was a maniac at the rim.   Lakers have the flexibility to run that kind of lineup with lebron playing the Harden role and and AD as PJ Tucker.   The appeal of pulling that off is way better than Buddy Hield imo."
"You‚Äôre right, what does HK have to do with this? I didn‚Äôt mention it at all. On a side note though. HK protestors have been pretty vocal supporters of BLM.  I‚Äôm talking about slave labor in mainland China used to manufacture products that these high profile athletes wear.  Sure, if some random black guy in America boycotted Nike nothing would happen, but if LeBron James and other high profile athletes boycotted Nike they may actually make a bit of a difference."
"I said it's true, I don't deny that there are a lot of hypocrites within the BLM movement tho.    Majority of these guys only do it because they don't like lebron or any other celebrity, and the stuff they've said about BLM. I highly doubt the ones calling him LeChina or Lemao James are people with families that ran away from the CCP.   &gt; But ppl like you bringing up that anyone speaking up about china is a ""hero to racists"" is just as bad  I never said anyone that speaks up about china is a hero to racist. I said them not speaking up against china doesn't take anything away from what they've said about their own people in America. Like Kanter saying the NBA made him speak up against china. The NBA is full of black athletes, of course they'll speak up for their own people. Would Kanter not have spoken up about china if the NBA didn't talk about BLM?  Black people and athletes actually get a lot of hate for speaking up on BLM. They always get told to stop bringing politics into sports, or that all lives matter."
"&gt; I don't think your average sports fan (or voter, for that matters) gives it much thought.  I agree that there isn't much thought happening here.  &gt;&gt;  Ostensibly because Americans should be concerned that equal protection under the law is not being applied to American Citizens?  &gt;In theory, but that hasn't been the case for most of this country's history, whether race-related or not.  I mean, the concern that discrimination or state violence against an out group could be turned against the white moderate is a driving force for reform in American history. It was in fact one of the great arguments in favor of abolition that helped sway the Northern voters of the city against the slaveholding south. This was the mainstay Republican platform...    &gt;And while no one's rights should be subject to other opinions that someone speaking out in favor of them might hold, a lot of people will see someone like James fighting for something directly affecting him, ignoring something that doesn't, and thinking that he's a hypocrite for calling out those not supporting his cause... remember ""silence is violence""?  Sure, but against LeBron being a hypocrite doesn't answer my question of ""Why should Black America's equal rights under the law be subject to whether an NBA player speaks out about Yemen or Qatar?"" As you said, it shouldn't. So whether LeBron is a hypocrite or whether the NBA players speak out about Yemen or Qatar or Trans rights or the rights of religious minorities in Europe to practice their religious beliefs without governments forcing them not to wear religious garb.... is literally irrelevant. And this is your central argument - ""If players don't give a shit about the mistreatment of people they indirectly profit from by a government that their league is in bed with, then why should non-black Americans care about how the justice system treats black people?""  I would ask ""why should Black NBA players (or more generally Black Americans) be required to pass a purity test of every single issue of injustice in the world that you consider important in order to be treated like other American citizens?"" Is that an appropriate standard to hold an American citizen to when we are talking about affording them the rights that are fundamentally gauranteed by the Constitutino of the United States? ""Sure, you can have them - but first I need you to condemn this list of atrocities that I chose to be relevant before I will care about how this country doesn't afford equal rights to its own citizens?"" One can see why this isn't a reasonable standard. I'm not asking the average sports fan or voter for their uninformed opinion, I'm asking *you*. Because you are the one who voiced that standard, and I'm asking you whether you think it is a reasonable one. I do not."
"&gt; Ostensibly because Americans should be concerned that equal protection under the law is not being applied to American Citizens?  In theory, but that hasn't been the case for most of this country's history, whether race-related or not.  &gt; Also because ""NBA players"" aren't the spokesmen for Black Americans? Why should Black America's equal rights under the law be subject to whether an NBA player speaks out about Yemen or Qatar?  Not all of them, but some seem to have taken up that mantle (most notably LeBron). And while no one's rights should be subject to other opinions that someone speaking out in favor of them might hold, a lot of people will see someone like James fighting for something directly affecting him, ignoring something that doesn't, and thinking that he's a hypocrite for calling out those not supporting his cause... remember ""silence is violence""?  &gt; And I would argue that not actually having a fair justice system absolutely does impact non Black Americans? Like, this is a patently absurd argument.  I suppose it depends if you think that the problems that black Americans have with the justice system are specific to their group, or whether they reflect larger issues that affect us all to some degree. I think it depends on what exactly we're looking at (overly armed police vs drug sentencing, for example) and I don't think your average sports fan (or voter, for that matters) gives it much thought."
"When Disney asked LeBron James to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to Disney Land‚Äù after the Lakers won, he said: ‚ÄúI'm already at Disney World, why should I go there?"""
"This is such an exaggeration. He scored well in some of the basic athleticism stuff, but less so in other areas that don‚Äôt get so much better just because you work hard. He has the obvious hops, but there‚Äôs so much more to it.   It takes more than that to be an time great. He doesn‚Äôt have the shooting, vision or the isolation/PnR skills that are required to get to that level. You can‚Äôt just say that‚Äôs about not working hard which you can‚Äôt really know fully about either way.   If you‚Äôre talking about between as in counting all 3, Wiggins has not been more athletic than James. He can compete in hops, but other things matter. Guys like Lebron and Zion are way stronger, for example."

Of any active player not named LeBron James he probably has the best chance to be in that discussion  But right now? No. Stop it. Get some help.
I‚Äôd argue that the Mavs won because they had Dirk Nowitzki *and* the insane luck of playing the worst version of LeBron James that we‚Äôve ever seen.
"Being labeled ""The Chosen One"" as a high school junior is insane.    Sports Illustrated February 18, 2002 LeBron James -  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002KDECMC/  I found out from his HBO documentary that Kareem was on the cover of SI as a 17 year old as well."
"Full article:  ON A QUIET evening a few weeks before the start of the regular season, Wilson Taylor was deep inside Paycom Center's laundry room, which doubles as the Oklahoma City Thunder equipment manager's deep storage facility. At a rack pushed up against the wall, he ran his hands over a layer of dust on a cluster of black and gold Nike shoe boxes. Kobe 8 System TB, size 13.5.  He smiled, knowing the score he'd just uncovered. He pulled out his phone, took a picture and texted it to Thunder rookie guard Josh Giddey.  ""No way!"" Giddey wrote back. ""Can I come right now?""  Fifteen minutes later Giddey was in the building, cracking open the five pairs of orange-and-white Thunder-color Kobes that had originally been sent for Derek Fisher, who finished his playing career with the Thunder in the 2013-14 season and had previously been a longtime teammate of Kobe Bryant. Giddey, cradling the boxes like a child on Christmas, looked at Taylor and said: ""Can I have them all?""  For years, this might've seemed like an unusual request. In the world of excess and fashion celebrity that is the NBA, shoes are usually ubiquitous. They're always fresh, always everywhere and typically gratis.  Until now.  Last spring, Nike and Vanessa Bryant announced they were parting ways after the shoe giant's deal with the late Kobe Bryant ended. The sides are still talking with the hope they can eventually come to terms, sources told ESPN, but currently the partnership is off. There had already been production delays that prevented players from getting their normal supply during the 2020-21 season, and for now, there are no more Kobes being produced.  Suddenly, the most popular sneaker among NBA players is also the hardest to get.  ""If you don't already have them,"" says Portland Trail Blazers forward Larry Nance, ""you're not getting them.""  KOBE BRYANT'S SIGNATURE Nike sneaker had become unquestionably the most popular shoe for NBA players in recent years. During the 2019-20 season, more than 100 players were wearing the Kobe 4 Protro, a retro re-release of a sneaker Bryant originally wore in 2008. Today's players love the design, the feel and the statement of the Kobes.  ""This generation looks at Kobe like our Jordan,"" says Chicago Bulls guard DeMar DeRozan, known in the league as the dean of the Kobe shoe devotees. ""It's a great shoe to wear. Guys really fell in love with it.""  In the Orlando bubble in 2020, just months after Bryant's tragic death, nearly one-third of the 330 or so players were wearing a version of Kobe's signature shoe, and that figure was growing. Over the past two years, a number of players who'd previously been with Under Armour and Adidas did not have their sneaker endorsement contracts renewed, a trend that was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the new sneaker free agents went looking for Kobes. It all adds up to a large contingent of players who now have a source problem for their Kobe needs.  There are still supplies on sale at some retailers, but not in great numbers in the sizes NBA players typically need. The scarcity of larger sizes has driven a pricing boom on secondary shoe resale websites such as StockX, GOAT and eBay.  NBA players who wear size 14 or larger are looking at spending at least $800 for the most basic models of Kobes, and that's not what they typically wear. But the players are paying, with several telling ESPN they've spent more than five figures buying supplies of Kobes on the secondary market since last spring and summer.  ""I'm not going into a store and finding a [size] 17 in a Kobe. No way,"" says Anthony Davis, who switched to the Kobes when he joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 2019. ""I mean, it's guys' favorite shoes. ... A lot of people are inspired by him, and the shoe feels amazing. All of them feel amazing.""  Players previously used to wearing whatever colors they wanted -- particularly after the league relaxed its rules around sneakers before the 2018-19 season -- are now scouring the web and trying to hunt forgotten stockpiles to get shoes to wear in games. And they're competing against each other for the available large sizes in the marketplace.  ""If you weren't in on them for the last few years,"" says DeRozan, a longtime Kobe model enthusiast, ""you're having a tough time.""  Kobes are now considered ""deadstock,"" taking them into a vintage market that ups the ante. NBA players have chased deadstock shoes for years, often to add to their collections to wear or display off the court. Miami Heat forward P.J. Tucker is known for wearing high-end vintage models in games, but he's an outlier.  It's also not unheard of for players to occasionally buy shoes for game usage. Taylor says he sometimes helped players such as former Thunder center Steven Adams, who wears size 19 and really liked the way Derrick Rose's older Adidas models fit him, spend a few hundred dollars to chase down extra pairs. More commonly around the league, players wear what they're paid to wear and there's almost never a thought about supply.  The current situation around Kobes is a whole new game, even for players paid to wear Nikes. Giddey, who signed a multiyear deal with Nike before the season, and players like him are spending more than $1,500 on pairs of Kobes right now as they try to stock up for this season and beyond. Their agents are sniffing around for them, calling in favors and hunting the secondary market for their clients, but without much success.  ""I've had a few guys reach out to me for help,"" says Phoenix Suns star Devin Booker said. ""I'll never run out of Kobes."" Booker and DeRozan have a supply of PEs, shorthand for Player Exclusives, that Nike has set them up with as brand ambassadors for years. But they're in an elite class. The shortage is particularly hitting young players who adore Bryant and his shoe line but haven't had the benefit of being in the league long enough to create a backlog.  ""I'm working on it every day,"" says New Orleans Pelicans rookie Trey Murphy, who wore a pair of Kobes gifted to him by a teammate to start the season. ""It's hard out there right now. I'm not DeMar DeRozan.""  But even DeRozan can't be DeRozan.  ""I used to play in a pair once or twice and then give my shoes away to fans,"" DeRozan says. ""I may not be able to do that as much.""  THE RUMORS OF the end of the Bryant family agreement with Nike started circulating last season before becoming official in April. Nike reps quietly told team equipment managers to prepare their Kobe guys for an end.  ""Some of us got the word, and we started hoarding them,"" says Suns forward Jae Crowder. ""By the time the news came out, I had banked up enough for about two years.""  Stars with major shoe deals like LeBron James, who has given molds of his feet to Nike so custom shoes feel broken in on first wear, break out a new pair each game. Some players will wear them for a couple of games. Crowder says his two-year supply was 100 pairs, as he usually goes through about 50 in a year. Davis, on the other hand, uses fewer, as he says he will use around 20-25 pairs of his relatively shallow Kobe supply this season. Some players without a similarly deep supply have already been forced to switch. Several equipment managers say players have switched this season to the plentiful Nike Kyrie Irving Low model, which has design similarities to the Kobe model. Others are using Nike's new more generic line, the GT. But many custom shoes have been delayed as Nike and other shoe retailers deal with factory shutdowns in Asia due to COVID-19.  In the meantime, the players who still have Kobes are trying to get the most out of each box.  ""The guys I have wearing Kobes are wearing them until they damn near fall apart,"" one equipment manager says.  When discussing this situation with ESPN, players repeatedly expressed hope that Nike and the Bryant estate can come to a new agreement, a talking point that's been pervasive among sneakerheads this fall. But even if that comes to pass, it would be a long time before Kobes are available again -- to players or anyone else. Product lines typically take Nike 12-16 months to produce, sources say, and that was before the pandemic disrupted global supply chains.  Either way, as this season rolls on and the supplies of the remaining Kobes begin to dwindle with no replacements, the demand for the late Hall of Famer's beloved shoe design will only increase. In a time when some players are dabbling in cryptocurrency investments, there might be a new exchange developing as more players get desperate.  ""I've always had so many pairs, but I'm looking at them differently now. Guys are asking me [for them], but I can't go through them like I did,"" DeRozan says. ""If it gets bad, I may have to even go to my secret vault.""  ESPN's Dave McMenamin contributed to this story."
I don‚Äôt follow the NBA and Lebron James is one of the few players whose name I know.
" &gt;The argument goes like this: LeBron, newly of the Miami Heat, put up an MVP caliber season and deserved to win. But, because of lingering resentment from The Decision, voters gave the MVP to Derrick Rose instead.  This line of thinking is very reductionist.   &gt;Here are the stats: Rose: 25 points, 4.1 rebounds, 7.7 assists, 1.0 steals, .6 blocks, 44.5% shooting, 33.2% from three. 81 Games Played.  LeBron: 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.0 assists, 1.6 steals, .6 blocks, 51% shooting, 33.0% from three. 79 Games Played.   So outside of rebounds and fg% they're basically the same. Not sure those two categories alone are swinging the MVP vote considering it is an award that takes a lot of things into account, including narrative.    &gt;In addition to putting up better stats across the board, LeBron had to learn a new system, run by a new coach, and how to play with ball dominant stars.   Again, their stats aren't that far apart. Regarding the system/coach/other stars aspect. No one, and I do mean no one, is taking this into consider when voting for LeBron James for mvp in 2011."
"When I was 12, me and my cousins went to the deli and bought LeBron James gum, and I remember thinking to myself ""this guy is way overhyped"". Well now I'm 30 and for pretty much my entire adult life Lebron has played in the Finals. It's tough to not call him the best ever."
"Kobe had the highest selling jersey by far for years amongst other things. As Shaq started to decline it &amp; Bron was still learnin it was definitely Kobe‚Äôs league. Then Bron started winnin &amp; Kobe‚Äôs body gave out on him &amp; it‚Äôs pretty much been Bron Town ever since.  I see the league doin their best to prop the new generation up as his replacement‚Ä¶ but for the foreseeable future LeBron Raymone James, Sr. is still The NBA Finals favorite/Boogeyman."
Still. You do whatever it takes when you have lebron James on your team to contend. Warriors have been in luxury longer
"r/walloftext lmao. Seriously though, your 6 year stretch of sucking wouldn't have yielded Lebron James if it wasn't the Lakers. If most other teams sucked that bad, there's no chance in hell they get a player the caliber of Lebron from 3 years ago. They did not demonstrate being a well run franchise, seeing as how their high picks flourished elsewhere. Laker fans are dense I swear"
"if LeBron James did this, no one would say a word  LeBron, who hasn't been able to scratch his balls and give his hands a sniff without getting a 2 hour segment on ESPN debating what his balls hypothetically may have smelled like since he was 18, would not have had anyone talk about decision  yes yup mhmm yes yeah ur right"
"Come on bro, who else but LeBron James the King üëë   Won his first MVP with averages of 28.4ppg, 7.6rpg, 7.2apg. Now that‚Äôs tuff üíØüî• am I right u/vincoug"
"LOOOL the only reason your team made it out of the first round were injuries. The Suns had one of the luckiest runs to the Finals in modern NBA history. Every single opponent they faced had either their best or second best player injured (or both lol).   LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, and Jamal Murray all missed part or the entirety of their series against the Suns. Even with that luck, Phoenix *still* couldn‚Äôt win the championship."
[Read this](https://sports.yahoo.com/amid-chaotic-offseason-damian-lillard-meeting-lebron-james-decision-loomed-sealed-recommitment-trail-blazers-200041277.html) then shut the fuck up and piss off with this stupid never ending nonsense. Christ how many times does he have to say it?
"Unlike virtually anyone mentioned as a replacement for Dame on the list, Dame has played on a small-market team his entire career and without any fellow stars.  Dwight has played alongside Lebron, Kobe, James Harden, Vince Carter, etc.  Kyrie's teammates and teams have a similar profile.  Paul George has played with Kawhi, Westbrook, and Dame's career stats are simply better.  Dame's best teammates ever were Lamarcus Aldridge for 3 seasons and CJ.  To do what he's been able to do in Portland without other weapons to spread the defense is absolutely insane."
"first, ""this generations _____"" as your describing seems pretty weird, generations in basketball fans come ups are somewhat small, we've had years where fans growing up adored Kobe, and then we had LeBron for years after that, Steph has been relevant the most recently  second, this generations _____ isn't determined at all by impact of a player on the league. if thats your qualification, I think it's most obviously harden the most impactful player in basketball history. he's had multiple rule changes specifically because of his dribbling moves taking advtange of the rule itself, we had mass flopping and baiting for fouls that has ran rampant for years, Steph opening night not getting that embarrassing foul bait shot, the shot and the no call is all a result of James harden.    Also, there was definitely years of players coming up and practicing their hesi pull up to be like KD, and its weird to be like yeah look at this impact on a player drafted like 2 years later in Dame"
Not really crazy considering Steph is head and shoulders a better basketball player than Lebron James. This is the type of greatness one expects from Steph Curry.
"yes! thank you I was looking for this, and it's ridiculous.  If scoring 50 wasn't a big deal then why isn't everyone scoring 50? Troy Hudson probably got paid for getting 50. Corey Brewer and Tony Delk probably got a couple more years of playing for scoring 50.  LeBron James got 50+ in a finals game and it was probably considered the most amazing individual performance in finals history despite the loss."
"Yeah, don't get me wrong, I think guys today would kill it back then. But they'd have a lot of adjustments to make.   But imagine not having the shoes, and the training, and the proper seats to sit down in, and travelling on a bus or in tiny seats in coach.   There is so much today that allows them to optimize their games.   I mean, I'm sure Hakeem would have put up number similar to Wilt had he played back then. And LeBron James and Jordan would have run amuck in the 60s.   One of the things that Wilt doesn't get enough credit for is changing how guys train. He lifted weights. Not a lot of guys did. He forced the guys around him to get stronger, and that's led to what we have today.   But yeah... the number of minutes they'd get and the pace of the game... it would certainly be an adjustment."
"Forgot to add, here's a longer version of the first table with the 50 biggest connections.

"Why should Morris care that he‚Äôs the fucking reigning MVP? Bill Laimbeer sure didn‚Äôt give a fuck that Michael Jordan was the best player in basketball, same with Lance Stephenson to LeBron James.   Just because a guy is more talented, doesn‚Äôt mean you have to respect him more. People are going way over the top with the Morris hate in these threads.

"Who wins a pre-30 vs post-30 game in the NBA?   **Pre:** Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Jayson Tatum, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic.   **Post:** Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Nikola Vucevic."
Let's dispel with this fiction that LeBron James doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing.
"""Heat Culture"" is actually just LeBron James. They haven't done anything since"
"It's a stretch. But it's not completely off-basis. He was having a great year, but was one of the favorites simply because he was LeBron James and the narrative that he hadn't won it in a while. And why Giannis, despite having another great season, wasn't an MVP favorite because of voter fatigue/lack of playoff success.   Lebron's name is also the reason he made All NBA despite missing 40% of the season."

"&gt;Except, draymond does bring the ball up a lot  But not as much as Harden, and he can't be relied upon to handle the ball as much as Harden does  &gt;The ones where you pass to a teammate, they take a dribble and a tough contested shot but you get accredited with the assist anyway.  Maybe on the Nets now, but for years in Houston Harden was the only shot creator on the floor for most of the game. He got most of his assists from pocket passes to a rolling Capela or passing out to one of the shooters on the wing. So none of this actually applies to Harden. Same with LeBron. Same with Jokic.   ƒ™If you tally up assist averages from players who play more than 20 minutes and divide it be time on ball, you get a near perfect linear line (with a few exceptions like draymond and Westbrook). Basically, there are barely any ‚Äútrue‚Äù playmakers, assists are mostly a bogus stat and over-awarded to the point it‚Äôs hard to differentiate between who is and isn‚Äôt a good playmaker.   This is where your whole argument falls flat. The entire reason why guys like Harden or LeBron have the ball so much is because they can handle the responsibility of carrying the offence like that. Give Simmons the ball for 15 seconds on every halfcourt possession and you'll have a bottom 5 offence. I don't know what your definition of ""true"" playmaker is but I bet if you could apply your analysis to Stockton or Nash, you'd get similar numbers to what you're getting from Harden, James, etc.  &gt;And no, if I doubled his assists, I would have said 16. That‚Äôs why I put some slippage in knowing defenses would adjust, and said 12.  And like 8 turnovers"

"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."

"He's not even Top 10 yet... but I'll humor your argument, even though your argument contains mostly shitty non-basketball related arguments.

Lebron and MJ both have 17 all star appearances, both were ROY, and both on all-defensive teams. In short, both players have more accolades and success with better career ppg, rpg, apg (not mj), spg, bpg, and fg%. What does steph have again...?  Right now he's ranked #71/#67 all time in points behind Bob McAdoo, is behind Ray Allen in 3 pointers, is tied with Giannis and Steve Nash with 2 mvps, is tied with the likes of Javale Mcgee, Patrick McCaw, and James Jones with 3 rings, has less all star appearances than Russell Westbrook, Dwight Howard, and Carmelo Anthony, less all NBA appearances than Moses Malone, Dwight Howard, and Kevin Garnett, and less ROYs than Ben Simmons and Michael Carter Williams. In regards to defensive teams and finals mvps, he has the same as you and I do, 0.  Forget Lebron, Kobe, MJ, Kareem, Wilt, Bird, Bill Russell, Shaq, Magic, and Duncan, curry is only discussed with and might be below Kareem, Big O, Jerry West, and even KD.  If you want to go off the fact that he is only 33, then I can literally point to Giannis only being 26 and Luka being 22 as better contenders for the GOAT case in the future.  Let's just say that if his game ages gracefully and he plays another 5 years with the best case scenario (another MVP, 2 Finals MVP+rings, 5x all star appearances, 30 ppg average), then he STILL doesn't beat any GOAT candidate. If you add 30 ppg for the rest of his 5 year career, he still only has 31000 points, which makes him 8th all time. If you add 5 more all star appearances he would still only would have 12. If you add another MVP he still only has 3, and if you add 2 more rings and finals mvps he would still only have 2 finals mvps and 5 rings, same as Kobe, who realistically also isn't even in the GOAT conversation.  Just to contextualize, Curry would have to have at least 2 more mvps, at least 2-3 more rings all with finals mvp, at least 5-6 defensive all nba first or second team selections, at least 6 more first team all nba selections, and at least 7 more all star selections to even have similar accolades to **compare** with GOAT tier players.   To have similar **career** stats, steph would have to literally average 43.7 points per game while playing every single game for the next 5 seasons, average 9.8 rebounds, and lord knows how many blocks/steals just to have a similar stat to the lowest of either GOAT player (27 ppg, 6.4 rpg).  &amp;#x200B;  TLDR: fuck no"
"Are we on the same fucking sub?  Give me 3 posts slandering one of Curry,  Jokic, Giannis in the past bit?  I don‚Äôt give a shit about ranking who gets more hate,  but acting like all superstars are treated the same is delusional.  Lebron gets more hate posts proportionaly,  just like AD and James Harden"
Look i know Reaves is the next Lebron James but he has no business closing the game.
&gt; Absolutely crazy that LeBron James never did this at age 33 when he was on those teams where he needed to carry.  Lebron did go for 51-8-8 during the 2018 game 1 finals though
I read ‚ÄúI tailed all of LeBron James assistants in his career‚Äù and got really confused.
Embiid got his team to a conference finals without Lebron James lol
TIL that Kevin Ollie got 10 assists from Lebron James. Somehow.
Lebron James or Michael Jordan would be a better fit with Luka.
"Honestly I think they're extremely close. The come playoff time thing doesn't make any sense to me, they have extremely similar records of success in the playoffs. His one terrible series doesn't erase his entire career. They're close enough imo that it's not outrageous to suggest a swap between them.  Also, shooting is the most important part to fans. Plenty of great players can't shoot super well. Giannis just won a title and multiple MVPs without a real jumper. Obviously Ben isn't Giannis, but just saying fans think every single person on every team needs to be a great shooter when it's not necessarily true. Ben on a team surrounded by good shooters is perfectly fine. Brown is also nowhere near the defender Ben is realistically. Ben is much more versatile and has better defensive numbers every single seasons.  You guys just throw everything that isn't shooting out the window to support your stance lol. Lebron fucking James was not a good shooter most of his career. You do not have to be a 3 point threat to be a very good NBA player."

But I think the shade thrown because he developed a personal connection and leveraged that into a career is dubious. I mean, for example, there's be substantial blowback if somebody said:  ""Bob Myers was just a schmuck who walked on at UCLA, and was lucky because his coach introduced him to Arm Tellem. Myers finagled a mentorship with Arn Tellem which he kept until he saw the opportunity to ditch Tellem to go run a team.""  Rich Paul found and developed a fantastic connection - LeBron James. But a lot of people are in LeBron's inner circle and none of them have successfully parlayed that into an independent career at the level RP has. RP has done right by a lot of his clients - getting AD where he wanted to be, getting Draymond way more money than most people thought he'd get. Everybody assumed the Klutch connection was part of why KCP got paid so much on his first Laker contract, and there were a bunch of guys in Cleveland who got overmarket deals via Klutch.  There are legitimate questions about Rich Paul. But it sure seems like the exact same sort of actions, taken by a white person, are lauded."
"This is utter shit. The double standards you guys use are ridiculous.  He plays hurt or doesn't get enough rest after the bubble-&gt;his fault.  Lebron James-&gt;everyone else's fault.  Lebron played like utter garbage after AD went down in the playoffs and all the blame went onto our role players that are quite literally thriving, every single one of them, on 4 separate teams."
"Probably LeBron James, Jayson Tatum's son üòå"
"I‚Äôm taking a huge risk here. LeBron James. I really like him and what he‚Äôs doing at his age. He truly is one of the greats to ever play the game and it‚Äôs exciting to see what he can do at almost 37. But damn if i want to see him on my team. Recently all is see is LeBron going somewhere, getting the team to play good, maybe winning a championship but as soon as it happens chaos erupts, long contract, no cap space, veterans, friends, friction, depleted rosters after a full season, etc"
"Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give Evan Mobley and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, ‚ÄúThere you go! There you go.‚Äù Sharpshooter Ricky Rubio gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Darius Garland yelled out, ‚ÄúWe got an [expletive] squad now.‚Äù And before Mobley hit the locker room door, former NBA great LeBron James hugged him and said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù"
LEBRON FRIGGIN JAMES
Are you aware that LeBron James and Anthony Davis play on the same team?
Is this the best non-LeBron James season start for the Cavs since like the 90s?
2011 was a thing to not forget. LeBron James chocked and frozen. Shocked üò≤
"As a non-American, can confirm that non-Americans are WAY more likely to have heard of LeBron James than Tom Brady.  And I am, at this point, a certifiable LeBron hater.  In fact, I just ran an experiment.  Screenshot available on request:  Me: Quick experiment. Have you heard of LeBron James?  Mum: I have heard the name, and I think he's a basketball.  Me: Have you heard of Tom Brady?  Mum: No.  Mum: ... er.  (Because she meant basketballer. I think ""I think he's a basketball"" is adorable so I'm leaving it in.)  So the results of my experiment that is EXACTLY as scientific as a dude citing his girlfriend, LeBron James is in fact at least as famous as Tom Brady, if not more so - after all, my mother even knew that he's a basketball. (er.)"
"Your girlfriend might just be kinda ignorant bro.  My mother in suburban Perth, Australia has heard of more NBA players than that and she does not care about basketball. At all. Sometimes she'll hear a news story and ask me about it. She has definitely heard of LeBron James."
Ask a random person on the street who has never seen a basketball game in their life if they know who Giannis is. Now ask them about LeBron James or Steph Curry.
"Laughing at all of these comments.  Yall are literally trying to criticize Lebron James.  Bro, it's Lebron James.  There's only one person who's ever touched a basketball that is more accomplished than him.  Watch him single-handedly win a chip this year."
"it isn't a tribute to the king of england or anything. it worked as a nickname because 'king james' sounded catchy, because it was already a common reference. that's how a lot of nicknames work  it's not because of some bullshit internet rumor claiming lebron means king in some undisclosed 'african language' lol"
Michael Jordan at age 24 (87/88) vs. Lebron James at age 24 (08/09). My brain breaks.  I also have the same problem trying to decide if I'd want the Michael Keaton Batmobile or the Christopher Nolan one.
"...where do people think the nickname 'king james' comes from lol? it's a play on king james of england, king james bible, etc  it wouldn't be considered a 'clever' nickname if his name were lebron murphy or something lmao"
Lebron ‚ÄúLeThisisFine‚Äù James
Lebron James because he knocked us out of the playoffs so many times. But I‚Äôve come to respect his accomplishments now so I guess I‚Äôll go with KG. Fuck Brooklyn.
Lebron knew he couldn‚Äôt be a pre dominant slasher when he hits his 30s. 26 year old James didn‚Äôt have a really good three shot (i think? I was too young to remember) compared to 33 James. 2 totally different people
"Got downvoted. But I‚Äôll state it again: There is a reason why LeBron wanted  to give AD the keys. He cannot, at his age, be the centerpiece of a NBA team.  You can‚Äôt just surround him with shooters and make it work. AD needed to be ‚Äòthat‚Äô dude and he hasn‚Äôt been. He (AD) was that dude in the bubble‚Ä¶ &amp; here we are.  Lakers have too many defensive liabilities, to include James, to stop anyone."
"Lebron James can't  stand him when he flops, and the roster construction of the teams he joins is horrible."
Imagine saying LeBron James has low character and class.... Dude's done so much off the court for years and that's the label people want to put on him....
"We're talking about the 37-year-old shell of LeBron James and a team that's trying to contend now and build for the future.  Not every team is willing to burn their future for the sake of right now, especially when the Warriors are already good."
"This has been LeBron James his whole career, especially with the Cavs where he well and truly runs the show. Pretending to take snapshots of the team, standing on the court while on the bench going crazy. A reminder to everyone that while in Miami, he had to be a lot more professional and behaved while representing the Heat under Pat Riley. In my opinion what he does is a bit much, agree with Big Shot Bob"
"&gt; The suns were killed for being a ‚Äúweak‚Äù western champ   No, they were killed for being gifted a pathetic route to the Finals:   \- Anthony Davis got injured and missed a chunk of the series + LeBron James was clearly nursing an injury as well  \- Jamal Murray misses the whole series  \- Kawhi Leonard misses the whole series  And before any of you idiots and/or Suns fans come at me with the ""b-b-b-but they didn't choose their opponents!"", don't. No shit they didn't choose it."
"If robin Lopez is tradeable, then lebron james is tradable"
"Seriously, there‚Äôs no way a 40 year old Lebron James can carry this roster"
"Lebron James, Rich Paul, and the Lakers minority owners (Mark Walter, Todd Boehly, and Patrick Soon-Shiong) are going to convince Joey and Jesse Buss to break ranks with Jeanie and Janie, flip to the side of Johnny and Jim, and break the Buss Family Trust.  Breaking the trust would allow each member of the Buss family to sell their 11% share of the Lakers individually.  James and Paul will then dissolve Klutch Sports, they'll partner with Walter, Boehly, and Soon-Shiong, who currently own 34% of the Lakers, to buy controlling interest of the team from Johnny and Jim who have been wanting to sell for several years.  Joey and Jesse will receive seats on the Lakers Board of Directors as promised.  Jeanie and Janie will be pushed out.  Rich Paul will become the Lakers President of Basketball Operations while Lebron is given the title of President of the Lakers."
"Kanter himself said the same thing about LeBron, except he didn't specify BLM, he just generally said that LeBron and other athletes [""pretend to care about social justice"".](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/nba/2021/11/20/lebron-james-not-giving-energy-enes-kanters-recent-social-justice-tweet)"
"The ""i just wanna go home"" tells a lot. Hes really ashamed of that team. I can see why: LeBron Princess Me-me-me James."
"this is an overreaction to last night.  i don't care how tired he is, you will lose most close games if you leave the crunch time decisions to westbrook over LeBron James."
It would be absolutely insane to say no to Wiggins and Wiseman for LeBron James!  The front office would do that in less than an instant. Good chance Wiggins probably won't even be on this team next year and Wiseman is a huge unknown that could turn into a roll player or not hit his prime until after Steph.  We're talking about LeBron James.
"https://www.spotrac.com/nba/los-angeles-lakers/lebron-james-2257/  it does say the previous contract was 4 years, from 2018-2021.  the way spotrac labels this is confusing but i think it must be the starting year (for the season) and not the ending year, because his first year in LA was 2018-19.  i think he probably had an PO on the last year of the previous contract so the first year of the extension took the place of that?"
LeBron James
"Ya. Back when they didn't just look at the scoreboard and say ""eh. We're up by 10 i guess we can take it easy"". I'm not saying this team is bad. It's fucking lebron James. Anthony Davis and Russel Westbrook. There's a reason everyone thought that they're locked for the finals. They just don't play like they wanna be in the finals. The moment they see that they have a lead. They just start relaxing till they're down again."
"For some reason, as a Kings fan specifically LeBron is the least scary superstar. James Harden fucking eviscerates us every time we play him, I don't think we beat his Rockets a single time (maybe the Bjelica buzzer beater? He was on his way out by then). Steph/Klay? They fuck us UP. Durant too.   Meanwhile we seem to either beat Lebron's teams or just play really hard against them going back a long ways. I remember when we had Vince Carter, he dropped like 24 on Lebron's Heatles and we beat them in OT. We also beat them with Isaiah Thomas and Marcus Thornton going off I think."
"How do you feel about his haters?   Those [leading to him being by far the most hated Western athlete on Twitter](https://fansided.com/2021/07/08/lebron-james-twitter-most-hated-athlete/), for example. Or the ones [leading his lowlights on reddit getting farr more upvotes than his highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nh0kuy/oc_rlebron_or_rcurry_using_subreddit_statistics/). Or maybe the r/conservative crowd that despises his guts. Or even the fans wishing for his son to die in a car accident   Weird to me that the complaint is always about the ‚Äústans‚Äù"
"I'm still baffled that Lebron chucked up all those 3's when Westbrook was carrying the team during those OT's  Coach needed to grow some balls and tell him to just stop with it, Lebron James or not"
"Being a scorer and a floor general are not mutually exclusive. A scorer is not just a kind of player, it is a role; one that can be shared with other roles to be carried out by a singular player.  Someone like Chris Paul is a good example of exactly the kind of player you are thinking of, not LeBron.  For comparison:  CP3 averages 13.6 FGA and 9.4 Assists for his career.  LeBron averages 19.5 FGA and 7.4 Assists for his career.  LeBron for his career, shoots the ball nearly 3 times as many times as he assists on a successful shot. CP3 can score, but he cannot do it in high volume like LeBron can. LeBron can and does so, thus he is a scorer.  CP3‚Äôs job is to run the offense and set up guys, while scoring here and there. LeBron‚Äôs job is to also set up his teammates, but half the time he is running his offense, he is also looking to score.  You can‚Äôt average 19.5 FGA and 27 PPG for your 19 year career without prioritising your scoring when you run the team‚Äôs offense.  For comparison, Kevin Durant, who is known first and foremost as a scorer, averages 18.6 FGA for his career.  Kobe Bryant, who is infamously known as a chucker, averaged 19.5 FGA for his career. The same amount as LeBron James. Even excluding Kobe‚Äôs rookie year, he averaged 20.2 FGA for his career, only 0.7 more than LeBron.  So how is it that KD and Kobe, who average 18.6 FGA and 19.5 FGA respectively, are scorers, but LeBron who shoots the ball more than KD and averages the same 19.5 FGA for his career as Kobe, is ‚Äúnot a scorer‚Äù?  It just simply sounds silly to not call LeBron a scorer. Just because LeBron runs the offense and is the primary playmaker of his team does not mean he‚Äôs a scorer.  If you can‚Äôt understand something as simple as a player holding multiple roles and abilities that even a child can understand, then I sadly can‚Äôt help."

"""Obscene deez nuts.""  - LeBron James, maybe"
He'll go in as LeBron James if you ask me
"One fan claiming to be at the game said that the female fan made incredibly disgusting comments about LeBron James' son Bronny, saying that she wished he died in a car crash, whereas the male fan was also making lewd gestures at LeBron James."
So that's a yes then.  Why would the Warriors trade an iron man who defends well and scores efficiently for the corpse of LeBron James? He's barely played this season because one quarter driving to the basket had him out for over two weeks with a hurty tummy. He doesn't defend and just chucks inefficiently.  And he has very little future in the NBA. Wiggins is 26. LeBron will retire before Wiggins starts to decline.

As a diehard Lakers fan since Lebron signed  I am disgusted and ashamed to associate with such a sad and pathetic franchise. I think it would be best if we traded Lebron James to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for some 2nd round picks and we should also offer Russell Westbrook and Talentless Horton Tucker 5 year extensions. As a result I will become a Los Angeles Clippers fan because they know how to win and they will always run the city of Los Angeles
"Problem I have with AD right now is he seems to become passive come closing time. Just shoots contested midrangers late in games, but I think it's more the offense of this team. Those last LeBron shots were all just them hoping for LeFuck You threes to go in without any action.  Yeah defense really is the issue here and I doubt this is an Ariza away from fixing it, provided Ariza is even going to be as decent defensively coming back from injury. I smell a lot of trade rumors come trade deadline from this team, and everyone aside from James and Davis, maybe WB are going to be on the block."
"Without the athletic wings who hustled on defense, also not playing in a resort anymore that literally safeguarded the health of both James and Davis... this is the result, not really a surprise tbh. The key injuries to LeBron and Davis at the end of the regular season last year, it was expected because of the wear and tear of a hasted season with teams actually traveling along the country. Now the wear and tear will continue with a even older roster, most likely the end result will be very similar, play-in ""tournament"", LeBron or Davis get hurt early in the playoffs, done season"
FVV = LeBron James confirmed
"Lakers front office might, Warriors front office won't. They're trying to build for win-now-and-in-the-future-as-well and 37-year-old LeBron is *not* a future piece.  26-year-old Andrew Wiggins and 20-year-old James Wiseman are."

Yeah that would change my opinion. My comment was written because it seemed like he was just pulling a ‚ÄúI can do this because I‚Äôm Lebron James‚Äù card. Shit talking is a part of the game as he proved with his gesture. His comment in the post-game interview about ‚Äúwhen obscene gestures and language come into it‚Äù prove he‚Äôs at least a bit hypocritical.
"It was not an accident. LeBron looks at him, as they are tangled up, gets angry and then hammer fists him. Then all the sudden LeBron acts all innocent. And then several games later has fans thrown out cause they were taunting him. In order to do that he grabbed a ref by the arm and walked him over to the fans in question and said something along the lines of ""these fuckers right here"" (paraphrasing).  King James????? More like Queen James and gets whatever he wants. Pathetic!"
LeBron James played 50+ minutes to lose to the Kings in fuckin' November. This Lakers team is a joke...
Lebron James
"Feels like he thinks he can't turn the corner on some players anymore. Even against Indiana he kept pulling up, looks good when its going in but your LeBron James, you can get to the basket with 6 seconds left easily."

"Lebron James, Steve Kerr, Robert Horry, Dikembe Mutumbo, Draymond Green"
"He's a sophomore player who made headlines in the sportsworld by bulldozing through a dozen people to fight LeBron James. This moment is going to be forever a defining moment in his career. Just like how with Artest, Malice is on people's minds."
"I would do 3 SC, 2 LBJ too.   It's absolutely true that Steph can't guard the 3, and let's be serious, LeBron can't guard the 5. But this is a top flight offense. When GSW had three of the best shooters in the game in Curry, Klay, and KD, they were unstoppable offensively, even without another even halfway decent shooter. Imagine they have that firepower, plus LeBron James - the most versatile player maybe ever - and then another LeBron James."
"I still dont understand why anybody thinks LeBron James, the face of the league, would intentionally pick him out to bust his face up. It just doesnt make sense."
Lebron James?
"You‚Äôre delusional as fuck if you think LeBron James is going to intentionally attempt to beat a guy‚Äôs face in on live TV with thousands of cameras surrounding him.   LeBron did intentionally snatch his arm away from him, but he didn‚Äôt intentionally try to strike the man. Any of you with an ounce of common sense can see him recoil and then walk over to Stewart to see if he was good. Stewart was bit miffed but somewhat cool, then started bleeding and went stupid."
Hey you guys will always have the bubble. No reason to be embarrassed about it. You get off to thinking about Lebron James. That doesn‚Äôt make you less of a person
"So a Finals appearance in the East (over LeBron James, Ray Allen, and Paul Pierce) is worth less than making the 1st-round in the playoffs?"
"It'll be included in the next ""Lebron James has a a history of dirty plays"" post"
**Breaking News**   LeBron James to drop 40pts in the Pistons rematch.
"To me, LeBron looked to be trying to come down hard on his arm after he was pushed off with such force. I‚Äôm having a hard time seeing this as intentional though, the hit to the face. I believe he did intend to deliver a hard chop to his arm for Stewart getting under him and pushing like that. You all acting like LeBron went all Ron Artest vs. James Hadin on him."

"Jokic's defense has been excellent this year, I don't really think you've been keeping up with the Nuggets if you think otherwise. Check his advanced stats if you want to see for yourself, he's topping the charts in DBPM and D-RAPTOR.   He's the best player in the NBA right now, maybe tied with Steph Curry. He really  does it all.... He can shoot the 3, he can take it to the rim, he can post up, he can shoot the midrange, he's one of the best passers of all time, he's an excellent rebounder, he can protect the rim. I thought LeBron James was the most well rounded player of all time, but Jokic takes it a step further by being a superior jump shooter and ft shooter. His advanced stats are GOAT tier, he's breaking records."
Lets go! Man the hate Zion is getting is pissing me off. This dude is the best 1st pick since Lebron James and he is gonna shut you all up very soon.
What a wild world - we're talking about the LA Lakers' best player and face of the league LeBron James getting LESS attention than Fred VanVleet lmao
lebron james
"On all D: I have my eyes? I watched a lot of his career. He dogged it on D a ton in the post Shaq years. He had the ability, and that's not in question, but not the inclination. He did turn it up in high profile games, and I think that helped him with a media already looking for more reasons to give an LA player accolades. D isn't as easy to quantify, so citing stats seems pointless. But do you really think he was a better defender than Tony Allen, Metta, Shawn Marion, AK-47, Bruce Bowen, Jason Kidd, Gary Payton, Dennis Johnson, Scottie Pippen, Tayshaun? He has more All D's than any of them, and that's absurd.   On Pau: I think he's massively underrated as a big man who could do almost anything on offense and was especially underrated on D (in general, I think good big defense is much more important than good wing defense, and I think Pau was better relative to his position than Kobe was to his, game in and game out). He could play in the mid range, kept the ball moving when that was called for, was a good shot blocker, could post up (this was both a strength, in that he was very good at it when he was on, and a weakness, in so far as he lacked the drive and clearly second guessed himself a lot), etc. That versatility was insanely valuable, but I think poorly understood, in an era when offenses were ripe for evolution but mentalities were stuck in the 90s. I don't think PPG tells the whole story, and the impact his addition to the Lakers had speaks volumes.   And with Shaq, I especially think PPG is misleading. You game planned for Shaq, and then dealt with Kobe. If you could play Shaq closer to straight up, you had a much better chance of beating the Lakers. If you couldn't, that opened up holes for Kobe to exploit, and also Shaq was still going to score a bunch. But the order of priority matters, and Shaq was the engine of that offensive scheme. He was option 1, and the post Shaq 1A/1b story always seemed to me to polishing the story of the guy who stayed. I think there is a big divide between Laker fans and those of who watched those games not as Laker fans on this point.  I think history has shown Nash probably didn't deserve that MVP (he was great, but that scheme was too far ahead of its time to chalk it up to just him), but Kobe was 4th in mvp voting for a reason. LeBron was far and away better than Kobe that year (that to me was the year that made it obvious he could be what he was hyped to be, a possible GOAT), I'd take Dirk that year over him as well, and I think Wade was comparable. The Lakers were a good but not great offense and a mediocre defense, and so was Kobe. His case was driven by relatively inefficient volume scoring at a time when versatility was more and more valuable. I don't think it was close for Kobe that year, in the same way it wasn't close for Wade.   Finally: I'm a sports fan who grew up in a series of failing Rust Belt cities and towns, of course I'm a hater. I was 11 when Kareem wasn't fouled and still got to steal our title on bullshit foul shots in 88. Fuck him and fuck Magic and fuck the Lakers. I loathe LeBron James and think he's a villain. Michael Jordan is an objectively evil force of nature, like entropy or gastrointestinal disease. Larry Bird can kiss my ass while the shit is releasing. But these are all great players, all top 10, no matter how much I hate them. You have to recognize greatness for the hate to matter. With Kobe I'm just sort of tired of the conversation? He's a great player, but not top 10, and nowhere near the player the guys named above are. He was never the clear cut best player in a given year, or in any given series of years. If he played for another team people would say top 15 and that would be fine. It's Laker fans that prop him up, largely as a matter of scoring, and it wasn't that long ago y'all were on a ""better than LeBron/up there with MJ"" kick, which strikes me wildly delusional. He was a great scorer, an inconsistent but skilled defender, an unwilling passer, had intangible issues like mad, and played well to his crowd."
"&gt; AD was great as his teams second best player though...  AD was actually arguably the best player on a team with LeBron fucking James on it. Dwight was never that good.  Dwight was not ""the absolute centerpiece"".   He was the defensive anchor. But on offense ? He was not the centerpiece at all. Outside of the ECF he basically shrunk away on offense whenever the game actually mattered. He looked scared to even touch the ball in Game 7 against Boston."
"Yeah that's a given. Lillard has nothing to show for at this stage, except failed playoff runs despite a better than average team. Him being in the list and not Dwight is a travesty (no pun intended).  &amp;#x200B;  Dwight was the shit back in 08 and 09. He was arguably on the level of fucking LeBron James. Lillard has never been top of the league (ok though, he had more adversity than Dwight in 08/09 with Durant, Curry, LeBron etc.)"

"Now I know you‚Äôre not worth a serious discussion . The man just came back from an injury , probably too early . Why should he risk getting another when not fully healed and his team is shooting  sub 20% on WIDE OPEN THREES. I didn‚Äôt think James harden was phoning it in but you people complain about players playing without fully healing . This nothing that he just gives up for no reason , rather then a multitude of factors is just born out of unreasonable standards  for an aging injured player. People gave harden shit too , players better off just not playing with how people look for things to make up shit .   Lebron drove less then half his previous career low , I‚Äôm sure that means he‚Äôs in perfect health.  Have a good day"
"Dude you're dense. Just because there's no objective standard since people give importance to different factors and weigh them differently in their judgement, but there are still objective truths.   Lebron James &gt; JR Smith is one such example. It is a fact because there's 0 credible argument for JR Smith to be considered a better all around basketball player or have a better career than Lebron."
"I'll start by what I feel *does* make this play difficult:  1. Chasedowns by nature take effort  2. Chasedowns take timing that some players just never really figure out  3. The ability to rise to the occasion and make this sort of play in the waning moments of a Game 7 with tens of millions of people watching and one of the greatest basketball storylines in history hanging in the balance.   On the flip side, I see Wild's point, too, though the whole not-top-100 thing is something I can't endorse.   I've been watching LeBron perform chasedowns for 19 years. I imagine he's got comfortably over 100 of them, if I'm being modest. And if you stripped *every bit of context* away from all of them and judged them only on difficulty alone, I imagine the Iggy block would be the middle of the pack. He didn't have to sprint at 100 speed to make up a massive gap (he was nearly even with Iggy at the start of the break), he had teammates there to clog things up for Iggy, and Iggy double-pumped which pretty much put the ball on a platter (which Bron then easily ate up because that's what he does).   So, technically speaking, something where James began *way* behind the field, had to mega sprint just to get back into the play, then find the perfect pocket to get a grazing hand on the ball might be the more difficult play. [Like his chasedown on Jason Richardson's 360 dunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYz-_AsTASY&amp;ab_channel=NicholasKopp).   But honestly, context matters, and some plays in NBA history are always going to get a boost for time in which they happened. I'll personally never forget the Game 7 block as a result. I guess it's almost like saying [John Havlicek's steal was overrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4fTjcJwImw&amp;ab_channel=NBA) because he had plenty of better steals."

"Derek Fisher, Bruce Bowen, Lebron James, Dennis Rodman, Dikembe Mutombo.   Fisher and Bowen provide some spacing and good luck scoring against that."
By some margin it has to be James' block on Iggy. The block itself is not a top-100 LeBron play of all time by difficulty but people continue to foist it on me as a career-defining moment. Nah bruh I seen better from The King that very series.
"Totals is a shit measure of longevity objectively, no matter how you define longevity, which is the ONLY ambiguous and subjective part as it encompasses years, durability, career consistency, and actual performance as a scorer scored within basketball games. And it's still shit for all of them. Context is the most important thing behind any statistic, and totals lacks any context behind those variables that underpin it, and that is the root of its problem in trying to measure anything. You have no idea where the points are coming from, how much is attributed to each variable, only that these players have accumulated these points, under vastly different circumstances, career trajectories etc.  * if you weighed injury resistance heavily as longevity you have players who struggle to stay on the court (Chris Paul no.45) outperforming players who are ironmen (John Stockton no.49).   * If you weigh years played heavily as longevity you have players (Bob Petit no.40) outperforming players who played half the years of others (Scottie Pippen no.62)  * If you weigh consistent performance over a long period of time heavily you still have no way of discerning from totals whether someone was a truly great scorer for a long time (James Harden no.32) or was simply an above-average scorer who played forever (Ray Allen no.24). Also see Kevin Durant vs almost everyone above him.  * It doesn't tell you anything about career consistency. Eg. over 80% of Wilts points were accumulated before he hit 30 (over 9 seasons), he averaged 18ppg in his remaining seasons 30 - 36. yet he's 7th in all time scoring purely because he averaged almost 40ppg over 9 seasons. Meanwhile Dirk who is right next to him maintained a consistent level of performance over a long period of time.  And the result of this shitshow is so easily demonstrated by removing player names and comparing stats, example:   * Player A - 19711 points total (no.49). Player B - 18713 points total (no.63). who's the better longevity scorer? Most people would pick A.   * I'll divulge more stats: Player A averaged between 14 - 23 points per 100 possessions over 20 seasons. Player B - averaged between 23.1 - 44 points per 100 possessions over 13 seasons. Literally zero overlap in scoring. Who's the better longevity scorer? almost everyone would change their pick to Player B now. These 2 ppl btw are John Stockton and Stephen Curry.  Moving onto Lebron, Lebron has essentially recorded more points per 100 possessions than Kareem every year, every phase of their career. Now late in his 30s, Lebron is recording a full 10 points per 100 possessions more than Kareem at the same phase of their career. Lebron is already the more accomplished longevity scorer by any objective observer. And this again goes all the way back to the problem of points total, Kareem despite scoring less in every stage of his career has more total points simply because he played more games. Has nothing to do with his prowess as a scorer, nothing to do with his ability to sustain his level better, absolutely nothing to do with performance, and given both players have played 19+ seasons, clearly nothing to do with ""longevity"", it's simply a matter of running the numbers and playing the requisite number of games.    Same thing with Jordan. The man averaged more points per 100 possession aged 38 than Kareem ever did in his career. He's scored an order of magnitude more than Kareem ever did at any stage of their careers. The man also played 15 seasons, stretching from 21-39. He's a better scorer longevity wise than Kareem. It's pretty clear the only reason he didn't pass Kareem when he retired is because he decided not to chill on the wizards for longer, or stay on after the second 3peat.   TLDR: This whole points total thing is dumb no matter what angle or definition you look at it. It's even dumber when you consider the public's fixation with it as some great measure of longevity. If you still don't get it at this point, all I can say is good luck, have a nice day, and your job that requires any critical thinking. Ciao"
6'3 KD is still pretty good.  So is LeBron James with no bbiq  Rest are trash
I don't think so. Think about is win percentage without LeBron James.
"Assuming we're building a team to take part in the 2021-22 season (all peak years are IMO ofc):  **PG: LeBron James** (career 27.0ppg) --- Peak versions: 09, 12, 13, 16  **SG: Danny Green** (career 8.9ppg) --- Peak versions: 13, 14, 16  **SF: Joe Ingles** (career 8.7ppg) --- Peak versions: 17, 18, 21  **PF: Robert Horry**  (career 7.0ppg) --- Peak versions: 94, 95, 01, 05, 07   **C: Draymond Green** (career 8.8ppg) --- Peak versions: 15, 16, 17  rationale: lebron + shooting is a tried and tested formula so here are 3 shooters plus peak draymond  who could occasionally knock down open 3s too (34.4% from 3 in 61 playoff games from 2015-17). All of them are at least solid defenders with some elite ones. Draymond and Jingles are both excellent ballhandlers/passers who can relieve some of the offensive burden on lebron. Might have to ask Horry to become the roll man in some sets ig, im not super familiar w his game haha"
Rajon Rondo  Derek Fisher   Trevor Ariza  LeBron James  Mutumbo
Steve Kerr Michael Cooper LeBron James Robert Horry Draymond Green
"BJ Armstrong, Tony Allen, Joe Ingles, LeBron James, Dikembe Mutumbo  Bench: Rondo, Rodman, Jared Dudley, Shane Battier, Ben Wallace.  A pair of defensive anchor 5s, size that can shoot, guards that can shoot, a lot of positional flexibility for LeBron to play either forward spot or PG. With a ‚Äò13-‚Äò16 era LeBron this roster wins 55 games minimum imo. Tempted to replace Rodman with Draymond but imo this team has some playmakers as it is i think Rodman fits better as a defensive gadget"
If I was playing in todays NBA I‚Äôd put prime Lebron at the point with a closing lineup of:  James  Kerr   Rodman   Crowder   Draymond

Obviously you're kinda fucking yourself with picking big men that can't shoot and never were expected to guard the perimeter a ton, but just imagine the defensive potential. No one could score in the paint whatsoever, and everyone but Korver can be a lockdown defender."
"LeBron James, Dennis Rodman, Ben Wallace, Dikembe Mutombo, and Draymond Green.  They couldn't score to save their lives, but it wouldn't matter, because the end score would be 78-72 every time."
"Because it would look cool if he pulled up from 3 and made it? Players do that a lot. Dame, Steph, KD. If it's tied and you got few seconds. Just shoot. No risk. You hit it, you win, you get in the history. You miss, you still got OT to win the game.      &gt;He couldn't      Yep, Lebron James really couldn't hit a dagger 3 in front of the Pacers. He never did. He totally couldn't do it and hasn't done it."
Kawhi gets underrated on this sub because people here love to change their rankings after every regular season game lol  When he's healthy everyone never mentions him for these lists during the regular season but when the playoffs start he reminds everyone how good he is  His series against a fairly stacked Sixers team in 2019 is probably the most impressive series I've seen from an active player not named LeBron James
LeBron James did spectacular for a man whose balding. Not as good as Alex Caruso but definitely worth noting.
"Other people have probably said it, but it's because LeBron James plays for them."
Lebron James is a contender on his own

"It wouldn't take a kings ransom. I get that LeBron is still the best player in the league, but he's also 36, and you're still getting back Kyrie and James Harden........."
This can only mean that they did this to beat LeBron James
The weird reason is because LeBron fans' way of praising LeBron is by devaluing and demeaning everyone elses contributions that helped James be successful.
"ill never be happy lebron left, that's an insane thing to say lol... we  (well most of us) will always appreciate him and wish him the best, but i'd gladly rather have lebron and keep refilling with role players for as long as lebron wanted to stay... when you have lebron james on your team, every game is fun to watch and you know come playoff time, you got a shot no matter who's on the roster..."
And no Lebron James.
I have never been alive to see a playoff caliber Cavs team that is really fun to watch that doesn't feature LeBron James. Until now.

"As a response to the tweet:  &gt; why are young players so sensitive when the OG Legends give them constructive criticism? When did the respect level change??

""He averaged 30, he led the league in steals, he was 90-50-40 [shooting percentages from the free throw line, field and beyond the 3-point line], and they won 73 [games].

"Wiggins was THE example used for advanced stats getting the call right. 2014, 25 games in to his rookie season the advanced stats called him a bust and [538 made this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/andrew-wiggins-lebron-james/) which was heavily criticized as everyone said it was too soon to call a 19 yearold a bust.   &amp;#x200B;  and we're not talking about the Timberwolves as a team, we all know they suck. We are talking about Edwards, where stats say he sucks now, and unless he changes will suck later. We can use stats to know that even though Kat is on a bad team he is still a great player."
"I honestly don't feel like Shaq is hating on the new generation, I think he just doesn't consider them a winner until they lead their team deep in the playoffs. Mitchell played great in the last playoffs but his team still lost to the Nuggets in the first round after being up 3-1 so Shaq doesn't consider that success because it happened to him when he was in orlando.   I think Shaq gives credit to people like Steph Curry, Lebron James, Dame Lilliard, Jimmy Butler, and more because they have led their teams to more success."
"It's 2026: President Justin Timberlake has defeated the obesity crisis by state mandated and run dance classes. Tom Brady has won another super bowl, behind MVP TE LeBron James. LeBron had to switch leagues becasue THIS DAMN GAME WOULDN'T BECAUSE OF THE FOULS."
Well yeah. When we talk about these scenarios it‚Äôs about the prime years. There aren‚Äôt any players that after years in the league and who are over 35 could still dominat‚Äî   *blocked by James*  Lebron James with the rejection of the nephew take
You forget there‚Äôs another LeBron James entering the draft in a couple years... tank for Bronny. Now that you‚Äôre in Tampa Bay y‚Äôall can sell actual tank tops too
"Yeah no shit they don't want to get rid of their best player. Why is this even an article?  ""Word around the league is the Mavericks have no interest in trading Luka doncic. Also, we're receiving reports that the Lakers intend to do 'everything in their power' to keep LeBron James and Anthony Davis. More updates as this story unfolds"""
"All of those y‚Äôall mention needs a god-given physicality, superior court vision, and a beautiful basketball mind. That‚Äôs LeBron James"
They were waiting for Lebron to throw down a wide open 2 handed slam in garbage time to give their upvotes. This sub might as well be a Lebron James fan club. Just go look at the comments on that post. Pathetic
"No I do not. General athleticism is much much different than fighting athleticism.   Just look at the video of Russel Westbrook and James Harden hitting a heavy bag. Two extremely powerful athletes and they can't generate any punching power whatsoever. They would get mauled by an amateur boxer much smaller than them.  Your body's ability to explode is only useful if you have good mechanics to channel that explosion. If you're not coordinated in the ways of fighting, you cannot. In grappling, you can be as strong as you want, if a smaller fighter leverages the strength of their entire body against the strength of your arm, you're losing that battle.   I've seen countless big strong guys go into a BJJ class and get subbed by a literal kid with a blue belt. It's a whole different game, and LeBron would have no chance whatsoever."

The ‚Äúbest player‚Äù is who is better at basketball than everyone else to me the best player this season is lebron James as he‚Äôs widely regarded as the best player in the world right now. Embiid has been one of the most valuable this season but it doesn‚Äôt make him the ‚Äúbest‚Äù player to me because hes not better than the top guys he‚Äôs just arguably more valuable
"I think your confusing that embiid is arguably the most valuable player but he‚Äôs not the best. He is not better than lebron James, Kevin Durant or Stephen curry to name a few. He‚Äôs been more VALUABLE this season leading his team to a top seed. There‚Äôs a difference"
"Yeah, it‚Äôs an oversimplification. Obviously the team staff, arena crew, etc all should receive a fair share as well.   But under a capitalist free market, the best players aren‚Äôt actually underpaid. LeBron James is worth way more to the league than the value of his contract. The players are the reason the money is there in the first place. They go away, no one else makes any money."
Do you right now think embiid is better than lebron James?
"So now you‚Äôre comparing retired, out of shape Nate Robinson to arguably the best active athlete on Earth? Robinson trained for 2-3 months for that boxing match against Jake Paul. I‚Äôm not disrespecting any fighter but let‚Äôs give Lebron James athletic ability some credit."

"&gt; Lebron James, superstar for 18 years, disrespected by the refs and not getting superstar calls.  &gt; refs making correct foul calls   Occam‚Äôs razor is your friend"
LeBron Goat James is actually 10-0 in the finals in my eyes  2007: super team   2011: Dirk Cheated  2012: beat Thunder big 3  2013: beat the Spurs   2014: Kawhi cheated also  2015: Kyrie love hurt  2016: 3-1  2017: Super team  2018: Super team  2020: won the hardest finals
"It‚Äôll be hard to count anyone who is a teammate of James Harden as truly in the MVP race.  Honestly I don‚Äôt know who I have as my candidates right now.   Jokic is doing incredible but the Nuggets aren‚Äôt, same with Luka and the Mavs  AD and Lebron are coasting  Giannis will have to face some serious voter‚Äôs fatigue  The Blazers won‚Äôt do well enough for Dame to be in it unless he goes absolutely nuts, likewise for Steph and Golden State  I think Paul George has a shot (I think he‚Äôs better than Kawhi lol) but everyone will disagree + he‚Äôs on the Clippers"
"Stephen Curry comes from a long line of basketball demon slayers; Curry is the family name of a lineage of humans that cooked basketball offerings for the basketball Gods, cast down by the basketball gods for flying too close to the stars.  In response, the lineage turned to demon slaying as a way to redeem themselves before the Basketball Gods, training to shoot the ball far enough away from demons so as not to be slain by their infernal pressure.     Each member of the Curry Clan is tasked at birth with slaying a specific demon.  Steph, a particular promising Curry, was tasked with defeating the basketball demon Dribbadon, Demon-god of Handles.  It is believed that Kyrie Irving, upon activating his third eye, will summon Dribbadon into this world to kill beautiful, team first basketball and replace it with ballhogging Demon-iso play.     Curry tried to summon Dribbadon early, as a way to save Kyrie and possibly all of basketball, by defeating him in the NBA tournament of champions and keep him from activating his 3rd eye.  When Kyrie came into the league, he seemed to have no chance of getting to the Championship -- the expectation for activating his 3rd sight and summoning Dribbadon -- due to being on a terrible team with no change in sight.  Curry was taught diligence at a young age though and, despite seemingly not needing to worry about Kyrie, he still trained and prepared for needing to beat Kyrie if the time arose...and almost out of nowhere it did.    Suddenly LeBron James, Chosen champion of the Gods of Basketball, decided to return to his home -- coincidentally being where Kyrie Irving resided.  Over night the team transformed into a championship level team that rivaled anything in the NBA at the time, and -- it seemed -- Curry was not ready yet.  Except he was, by the  grace of the Gods of Basketball -- injuries to key Cleveland players -- he was.     For a year he was.  Right when it was believed the Warriors would be able to defeat the Cavs a second time and keep Kyrie's eye from activating at all -- and possibly leading to the fickle LeBron leaving his hometown yet again -- the warriors inexplicably lost a 3-1 lead for the first time in championship history.  But this was on purpose.  Curry, the clever skyfucker that he is, had reasoned that it wasn't *just* about winning.  No, Kyrie needed to win *because* of him and his demonic handles, not just as a secondary factor.  Almost in unison Curry knew that he needed to prepare and Kyrie, whether by his own design or that of Dribbadon leaking into the real world, knew that he needed to leave the good thing in Cleveland and find a way to win while being ""the man""... as only then could his 3rd eye activate.  Seeing that his power alone would not be enough, Curry set up to lose the championship game as a way to bring in Kevin Durant, a fledgling Basketball Reaper (basketball champions tasked with helping demon slayers in their tasks, often without even knowing their role in the otherworldly battle).     This lead to Kyrie ultimately leaving for the Celtics and Curry bringing KD onto his team, both sides preparing for an ultimate, final battle.  But... somehow Kyrie getting back to the championship never happened.  Not for trying -- being on stacked teams again and again -- but it just never happened.  In the meantime, Curry has been keeping his power level low, conserving energy until the day Kyrie finally reaches the championship again and possibly activates his 3rd eye, summoning Dribbadon to our world.     There have been small stirrings, people wondering if Kyrie has somehow been slowly activating his 3rd eye in other ways.  While World B. Flat seems to be the going crazy, those with links to the HoF Pantheon of basketball wonder if perhaps he is seeing the world beyond our world -- a flat endless world of black and white...Gods and demons... makes and misses.  There is a worry that perhaps there is another way to activate the demon's eye...and so Curry waits for the coming of Kyrie's 3rd eye.  Of Dribbadon.  Of his purpose.

"Ah yes, let's use the rating system that has LeBron James as the 14th best player in the league."
LeBron James would be livid.
No they'd end up over paying Dlo because Kevin Durant or James harden or LeBron James aren't choosing to move to fucking Minneapolis.  Do you know why these dumbass owners fought tooth and nail to shorten the contract lengths? Because they were tired of getting stuck with 7 years of Vin Baker or Erick Dampier at max salaries.
It is not fair!!! Lebron James single-handedly taking over this game!!
Kevin Durant. LeBron James won‚Äôt cry about losing MVP this time because he knows Kevin Durant will win the NBA Finals this year.
"LeBron ""Roman Empire"" James"
"hey, that happens to be complete bullshit. [green clawed at BOTH of harden's eyes in game 2, his left eye was bloodshot for days, then green pokes at harden's right eye on purpose in game 3](https://spacecityscoop.com/2019/05/05/rockets-draymond-green-pokes-james-harden-eye/). also refer to the images of him poking redick and lebron's eyes in the same season. also refer to him tackling lebron at the end of game 7 in 2016. also refer to him pushing lebrons head into a camera lens in one of the other finals and giving him a permanent scar. also refer to him to committing multiple fouls a game that would get any other player thrown out or fined"
"If by scoring we mean putting the ball in the basket -- Harden would have to play at least 228 more games and average about 48 points per game over that stretch to catch Michael Jordan's scoring pace.  Harden has played 844 NBA games. 844 games into his career, Wilt Chamberlain had 7,876 more points than Harden. Harden would have to continue his current pace for about four more years to even catch up to that number.  If you look at the the usual suspects who are considered the best scorers of all time...  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Karl Malone  LeBron James  Kobe Bryant  Michael Jordan  Wilt Chamberlain  Dirk Nowitzki  Julius Erving  Shaq   I don't know where you cut off the top scorers of all time, but all those guys scored more points 844 games into their careers than Harden has.  What barometer are we using for scoring to say Harden is already the best scorer of all time? He's 10th all time in PPG. 14th in True FG%. He's not in the top 250 all time in FG%.   Curious what makes him the greatest scorer of all time?"

Leave it to LeBron James to suddenly become a fucking knockdown 3-point shooter in Year 18 of his career
"Here is an interesting article from 2010 that has plenty of juicy bits to show not only his evolution on court, but emotional evolution.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/478476-lebron-james-needs-to-look-in-the-mirror-to-explain-backlash-amp-not-blame-race.amp.html"
"&gt; I‚Äôve never seen a player get this much hate. Besides maybe lebron.    Uhh, did you forget about Warriors KD, and James ""Literally Hitler"" Harden, or even Kyrie?"
Kyrie didn't wanna play 2nd fiddle to LeBron Raymone James Sr. but he's gonna act as a floor spacer to james harden? I need to see it to believe it
"Yes.   In the 95-96 season, the league average 3 pt shooting was 16 attempts a game per team. Last season, it was 34 attempts which is more than double.  If you put two of the greatest ever shooters shooting on today's volume from this era next to LeBron James, a GOAT contender, there is no chance IMO."
Number of times lebron james mentions embiid and jokic on Instagram -0  Tacko- 4675789997
"Real name is LeBron James Jr, but there‚Äôs only one LeBron"
"Update read the post and mostly agree. Also you should also look at year long consistency. Novak is successful at the 500‚Äôs , 1000‚Äôs and grand slams through the whole calendar year like Lebron who puts up great numbers in the regular season and then just dials it up every round in the plays offs. Also Novak is going to get the most weeks at no 1. So that‚Äôs just adds to the argument that he was dominate just like King James."
He is playing so well and he's not even in the top 10 according to Vegas:  Player | Odds ---|--- Luka Doncic | +400 Giannis Antetokounmpo | +500 Kevin Durant | +550 LeBron James | +600 Nikola Jokic | +600 Stephen Curry | +900 Joel Embiid | +1200 Damian Lillard | +1800 Anthony Davis | +2200 Trae Young | +2500 Jayson Tatum | +3300 James Harden | +4000 Kawhi Leonard | +5000 Devin Booker | +6600 Paul George | +7500 Bradley Beal | +10000 Kyrie Irving | +10000 Zion Williamson | +12500
"Secondly, bust means failure. Making it to the finals is not a failure. Lebron James made it to the finals for 8 consecutive years. That was not a bust. I know the context is different as the nets are stacked and have 3 of the top 20 players in the league but they don‚Äôt have a good big man and have huge holes defensively. Lakers have more depth. So how can you say bust when they are clearly not the best team, as of right now."
"The notorious under the radar first seed in the west with the runner up MVP, LeBron James, and the runner up DPOY, Anthony Davis, playing for the Los Angeles Lakers, famously an under the radar franchise"
"I wish OP would‚Äôve included Chucks [response](https://www.nba.com/news/charles-barkley-responds-lebron-james-comments) to what LeBron said, it‚Äôs one of the reasons I love Chuck. He can be an knuckle head sometimes but I thought his[response](https://www.google.com/amp/s/theundefeated.com/features/barkley-on-lebron-my-criticism-was-fair/amp/) was appropriate and LeBron got personal because his feelings were hurt."
LeBron James retired ?
Lebron ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Jesus‚Äù James
Judging a LeBron James led team by regular season standards is pretty useless.
"That‚Äôs because if you breathe on somebody these days it‚Äôs a foul call. Can‚Äôt even try to defend somebody driving to the rack because if it‚Äôs let‚Äôs say Lebron James, James harden etc. you can‚Äôt even make a play on the ball without getting that foul called. It‚Äôs hard to watch. The bulls vs clippers game I seen the other day was atrocious, phantom calls all game long."
Who the fuck is LeBron James. Sounds like a quiet dude if I never heard of him
Lebron James has quietly won 4 NBA championships.
"&gt;Problem is if LeBron was here he woulda had us trade half those guys for James Harden lmao  wow that would be a serious ""problem"""
I bet we could bring in some really fun vets too.  Problem is if LeBron was here he woulda had us trade half those guys for James Harden lmao
"The Heatles were without a doubt considered a super team when they formed and still should be now. Check out this article from [2010](https://www.sbnation.com/2010/7/29/1591097/miami-heat-2011-record-projection-lebron-james), which not only labels them as such but also speaks to how good they were expected to be heading into their first season. Here's an exert which speaks to how they not only had their stars but were able to retain talent around them:  &gt; Pat Riley outsmarted us all. By completing sign-and-trade deals for LeBron and Bosh rather than just outright signing them, Riley was able to convince them to take lower first-year salaries because he could tack on a sixth year to the end of their deals. This financial legerdemain engineered enough cap room for the Heat to add two solid rotation players in Mike Miller and Udonis Haslem. Add in decent-ish role players like holdover Mario Chalmers and returnees James Jones and Carlos Arroyo, and suddenly the Heat boast a crop of actual NBA players aside from their Big Three.   They won 27 straight games in 2013, second longest win streak ever. They went to 4 straight finals. What else do they have to do to qualify for ""super team"" status?"

During that play Lebron James ran behind Wiseman and pushed him into Marc Gasol then Wiseman fall onto Marc Gasol. This is not only dangerous for Wiseman but also for Gasol.  This is the play: https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=368&amp;GameID=0022000212&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Wiseman%20Offensive%20Charge%20Foul%20(P5.T2)%20(J.Goble)&amp;sct=plot"
"Players sign contract with specific teams. They work for teams, not the NBA. LeBron James is signed to the Lakers, not the NBA. Same with coaches. There‚Äôs a very clear and painfully obvious distinction between guys like Mark Tatum and Frank Vogel. You see that right?"
"Lebron James looked old when he was younger too. Some people just look old in their face. Elite athleticism and elite length, but face that looks like he doesn't need any makeup to play in the next Uncle Drew movie. Not bad genetics."
"Yeah see the difference is.. kyrie is back and James harden is in the East and Jaylen Brown is on another level. 3 players with great stats(Kyrie and Brwon with great efficiency) and on winning teams. If it was like this last year trae wouldn‚Äôt have been a starter.  I understand he‚Äôs averaging 35 and if he was averaging 35 and his team was 6-9 I‚Äôd be cool, his stats actually mean nothing. He has 10 straight games of 40 points and a loss. This isn‚Äôt KD or LeBron or Kobe or MJ, guys that put up historical numbers and can lead a horrible team to a playoffs,  This is a 3rd option on championship team who decided he wanted to stay a first option and get money on a losing squad and now he cries every game. They‚Äôve been trying to trade him for YEARS bro. I definitely think he‚Äôs an all star, but a starter? Hell nah"
Lebron James have never committed a foul in his life. Certainly not dirty ones to not get posterized. Stop the slander!
Jamal Murray slaps Tim Hardaway Jr in the nuts: Ejected  LeBron James dangerously pushes Joel Embiid midair: Stays in the game
Lebron James got locked up Jerami Grant. MJ runs laps around Lebron. Easy blowout for MJ
"Lol I mean couldn't be Hakeem, Dirk, Shaq, or Jordan. If Lebron James ring chased then I guess ring chasing simply means joining another team."
Its called Lebron James bro
"""We take pride in not losing ~~two~~ three in a row."" - LeBron James"
Lebron James missed 11 of his last 12 field goal attempts. Man didn't do anything at all in the second half.
LEBRON JAMES
"yeah thats what im saying. im not saying hes a dirty player or a cheat or anything like that, i actually really like lebron and his game. i just think hes reached too high of a status so much so that refs treat him differently to other players when hes on the court. he has a lot of extra leniency from officials on no basis other than the fact that they dont want to be the guy to tell off lebron james"
"Lebron ""IM 36"" James is absurd"
And the 14-5 Lakers will win the championship led by the GOAT Lebron James.
"Depends how you are measuring impact, but for the past three years he is a top 15 impact player as measured by PIPM, RAPTOR, RAPTOR WAR, Win Shares, RPM, VORP and Total Points Added. Only six other players in the entire league were unamimously top-15 in all of those metrics, and those six guys were all serious MVP candidates: Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic and Luka Doncic. With one exception, those were the top five finishers in the 2019-20 MVP vote (Jokic was 9th), while Gobert wasn‚Äôt mentioned on a single ballot.  I prefer these kinds of metrics versus 1st all-nba ballot nods and such, but to eachs own. I get an argument against 10 impact too"
"&gt;Conceivable, sure. With any evidence to suggest it‚Äôs true in this case? No.  Only what we know about AD's mentality with the Pelicans the last few years which came from him, and Lebron's very own comments, which likely do have some degree of insight given he's a close teammate of him.  [‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre losing, you don‚Äôt realize that you‚Äôre not happy,‚Äù Davis said. ‚ÄúYou made a ton of money. You can do whatever you want. You can live this lifestyle, quote-unquote ‚ÄòThe American Dream,‚Äô but losing sucks. I {realized that} I‚Äôm not happy. I want to be happy. And you kind of go through these times where it‚Äôs like, do I really want to play basketball? Am I really good enough? You start doubting yourself because you‚Äôre not happy. Or it might be stuff in your personal life where you‚Äôre not happy. Whether it‚Äôs in a relationship or family, whatever it may be. I had some of those things where it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm going through something off the court. I‚Äôm not happy and it‚Äôs reflecting my game. It starts leading to minor injuries, you‚Äôre not playing hard enough, things like that.‚Äù](https://www.thebirdwrites.com/2021/1/25/22172505/anthony-davis-new-orleans-pelicans-goodbye-los-angeles-lakers-lebron-james-rich-paul-holiday-rondo)  As for my supposed ""questioning"" of his competitiveness, I'm not. It's the same mentality that nearly drove Kobe out of LA, that did drive Lebron out of Cleveland, KD  out of GS, etc... Their competitiveness inherently drives them to seek and achieve success at their craft, and toughing it out in NOLA just to not make the playoffs or barely scrape in to them and get swept isn't that.  Also, you still haven't acknowledged that whole ""I'm happy/not bitter thing."" You might as well be that happy/mad face meme right now."
"Precisely. A superstar is the reason we have a championship at all, and a lack of a superstar is the reason why we got punked by LeBron James all those seasons and why Utah will continue to have zero championships despite how good the current team is."
"I am very mad at Lebron James for not only doing this, but walking away not checking on Embiid....  Gross stuff"
LeBron James doing everything in his power to win MVP. He‚Äôs trying way too hard. LeBron James already knows the next 3-5 years are Brooklyns.
"LeBron James is my Dad, and last night I was very dissapointed in my fathers actions during that play. Never be ashamed of being postered because you are trying to play defense, and DEFINITELY do not potentially injure someone to avoid it"
1. MJ  2. Steph Curry 3. Kobe Bryant  4. Kevin Durant  5. James Harden 6. Kareem Abdul Jabbar 7. Tracy McGrady 8. Allen Iverson 9. LeBron James  10. Wilt Chamberlain
I didn't think much of it till I saw the replay and what you were mentioning in your comment. It was gross disregard for a fellow player that he caused to hit the floor hard by shoving him. It was a complete bitch move and a small prism into the larger passive-aggressive psycho GOAT chaser that is LeBron James.
"Yeah, but did you know that Lebron also made some poorly phrased comments about the China/Hong Kong situation?   The NBA has a real problem. Employing James ""literally Hitler"" Harden and Lebron ""literally Lucifer"" James is not acceptable."
"Talkin' 'bout LeBron ""China"" James?"
LeBron James called me a criminal I when I can prove otherwise chipless.
"I don‚Äôt know how anyone is a fan of Lebron James other than Laker fans. He‚Äôs a dirty player, cries about every single foul call, and flops worse than anyone not named Marcus smart."
Fuck Lebron James. Seriously.
"That guy didn't mention their ages at all, which was my main point. Most of Harden's best seasons are done, and if you buy him now you aren't getting any of that. All you're getting is 31+ year old James Harden, who could age like LeBron or he could age like Westbrook. There's significant risk on that end of the deal as well.  You can say ""there's no guarantee Wiseman will ever be great"" and it's true, but he's what? 20 years old? If he turns out to be an All-Star, you have maybe 10-14 years of elite performance. It's probably worth more than a short-term rental of a guy approaching the backslope of his athletic prime."
"good, stick to lebron dirty james."
"I'm no ""Bron stan"" or whatever, I enjoy the guy because of course I do, but I'm getting the feeling, based on the comments I've been seeing since last night, that the anti-Bron crowd is doing everything they can to paint Lebron as the devil over this.  It was a reckless foul, the kind James hasn't done in 7 years and the kind Embiid does all the time with no regard for other players, and it was appropriately called a Flagrant 1.  People out here calling for Bron's head on a platter are the same ones who tried to makd his China/Morey comments more than they were, too.  Just like that it'll be forgotten in a month."
"I know! The famous ""I support genocide and death camps!"" LeBron James quote."
"KG once did this to Lebron himself. But KG tried to push him much harder. Lebron adjusted in the air, still landed funny, but I'm pretty sure he dunked it and shrugged it off. Not sure there was even a whistle.  Edit:   Lebron James with no regard for KG's life  https://youtu.be/5umalMCghgQ"

"Nope he didn‚Äôt get speared by Goldberg, but he did get two arm shoved by Lebron James while in mid air bud."
"Eh every sub has its kids with their shit hot takes and unoriginal memeing, its the reddit way.   I've also seen Big Aristotle, Splash Mountain and King James lol. Though the last one is more to troll Lebron fans"
"But LeBron James also might not do all star this year. We don't know. But saying he is is a pretty educated guess.   Wiseman is showing signs he is going to be a star. He might not be. He might. But around people who know a lot about NBA basketball, the consensus is that he is going to be a star."
"I think the call was good. But people here exaggerating too. It‚Äôs not a flag 2 and ejection, On the slow mo vid it‚Äôs a better angle. Looks like James was thought about contesting for half a second and gets ready to jump but realizes it‚Äôs too late, and is trying to move out of the way.  It‚Äôs A bang bang play though, there a small push by lebron and a small push by gasol. Wasn‚Äôt intentional"
"Hey man, all you guys had to do to get LeBron fucking James was simply exist lol"
On top of that lets not forget that a light push from **LeBron James** is like the Flash going for a slow jog lol
shit happens in the heat of the moment with a play like this but the worst part was how lebron handled it afterwards. he walked away from embiid without even checking on him and then complained to the refs. i know he‚Äôs lebron james but it‚Äôs not a good look and he needs to realize he doesn‚Äôt own the league.
Kevin Love is the most overrated 3rd option of all time. LeBron James and Kyrie Irving were by far the best duo in the NBA in 2016.   I want Bradley Beal to end up on the Los Angeles Lakers. It would make the Los Angeles Lakers a lock to make the NBA Finals and the Finals would be competitive.
Did Lebron James give Kyrie Irving his third eye?
"The Heatles is an underrated one.   Dwyane Wade, Ray Allen, Lebron James, Rashard Lewis, and Chris Bosh with Battier, Mike Miller, Juwan Howard, and Udonis Haslem off the bench is pretty amazing. They already won 66 games and 27 games in a row as is, without Allen, Lewis, or Howard anywhere close to their prime level."
A light push by LeBron fuckin James lol

That pussy is so used to the refs bailing him out he doesn‚Äôt know that he‚Äôs a dirty player.  Fuck Lebron James for being a massive pussy."
Anyone not named Lebron James gets ejected for the same exact play
have u ever thought like maybe seeing lebron james on the court tells u that its the lakers.. and after like the first 2 minutes u understand that the blue jerseys will be the lakers.....
The free throw numbers make something in me want to curl up and die because they're literal free fucking points and you shouldn't *have* to be LeBron James or Joel Embiid to make them at a reasonable rate...   But beyond that it was a very entertaining game.
Easy flagrant 1 call there.  First one in a while for LeBron James.
"Thank you for this I thought I was the only one this bothered. Im a pretty huge NBA fan that has an old Lakers jersey my step dad bought me from the strip mall in our hometown of Spearfish South Dakota. When Im at the local Applebees bar hittin on strange sipping my draft bud light I like to impress the ladyfolk by commenting on the game. Today I accidentally confused Lebron James and Ben Simmons because the stupid jersey color was wrong! Wendy the bartender laughed at me and totally cock blocked me from this solid 7 I was flirting with, pretty sure shes a lez anyway. NBA needs to stick to the jerseys we know or how else am I supposed to follow the action!"
LeBron ‚ÄúVince Carter‚Äù James
His name is Lebron James
"Bro, Lebron is still in the game purely because he is named Lebron James. Fucking chill"
And literally every comment under ops is its not a flagrant 2 because it's LeBron James
"Holy shit, imagine thinking all the anger here is some sort of sub-reddit driven conspiracy to...outcast LeBron James?"
Fuck lebron James. That is all
11 letters: LeBron James
Lebron James
"Lebron explaining himself to the referee, ""I'm Lebron frickin James man, I can't let this man body me. Straight to the floor."""

LeBron James
"Its cause lebron is really fucking good. This is why I hate this shit, lakers finally get a stretch where they're not dominating the league and then they get lebron fucking james."
Sure. Just lend him one LeBron James and you can damn near guarantee it.

As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."
"LeBron ""Cutter"" James."
"LeBron was eligible for a NTC in Cleveland in his second stint, and actually did have one then. You don't have to have 4 consecutive years with a team to get it, just 4 years total (and 8 years in the league). There was talk in LeBron's last year in Cleveland about him possibly getting traded, but [he shut all that down using his NTC](https://www.nba.com/news/report-lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-will-not-drop-no-trade-clause-2017-18) and said he would finish the year on the Cavs and then make his decision in free agency. He wasn't eligible for a NTC in Miami or on the Lakers, however."
Kevin Durant was the best player on the planet in 2018. Kevin Durant sweeped LeBron James in the 2018 NBA Finals. I want to watch Kevin Durant sweep LeBron James in the 2021 NBA Finals.

"I don't think Jokic is a lock by any means. He is easily one of the best players in the West, but his fan support is in no way in the LeBron, Luka &amp; Steph category.   Steph has had a few down years in terms of team releveancy, so he may not make the fan vote. Jokic will also be going up against Davis, Kawhi, PG, (possibly LeBron or Luka if they are listed as front court players). So far from a lock IMO.   FWIW, I think the West starters will be:   F1: Anthony Davis  F2: Nikola Jokic  F3: Kawhi Leonard  G1: LeBron James  G2: Luka Donƒçiƒá   &amp;#x200B;  With Nikola and Kawhi's spots most up for grabs."
"Tbf the amount of ""heat fan here what do you guys think of Herro and *insert picks here* for *insert X star player here*"" can get really annoying. As for the annoying support, when you're playing Boston and the Lakers with LeBron James, that's gonna happen."
"They still don‚Äôt make the playoffs. The missed them by 11 games- it‚Äôs not like they were close. They were 28-27 in games Lebron played and the eight seeded clippers were 48-34. They wouldn‚Äôt have gone 20-7 in the games Lebron missed. People always talk about how they were 4th before James got hurt but they had an extremely easy schedule to start the season and a difficult one to finish. Fully healthy they probably win 42 or 43 games, missing the playoffs by 5 or 6 games. Every other team also had to deal with injuries as well."
"&gt; I never said they will,  So why are you arguing and whining with me? You agree with what I've said. Nothing I've said is incorrect and you acknowledge that.  &gt;GSW were significantly Better than the Cavs but they had some fuck ups and well 3-1 happened.  It's adorable that you think citing a case when a team with Lebron James won the finals is a great support for your argument (even though you have admitted I'm right)  &gt;Oh there is no arguing, you only watch American Sports and cant comprehend that another team not from the NBA could beat you.  Well a non-NBA team could definitely beat me because I suck at basketball lmao  Your need to assume that I have never watched non-NBA basketball proves how weak your argument is. You're relying on an unsubstantiated assumption to delude yourself into thinking you're right. You're not, bud. Sorry you're upset about it.

When Lebron got hurt they‚Äôd also had the easiest schedule in the league to that point. They were always going to fall off whether James got hurt or not
"&gt;  In 55 games Lebron played in that season LA was 28-27.  They peaked at 20-14, then slipped to 27-26 during his first absence.  Even with Lebron back they couldn't get it together, falling to 34-41 when Lebron shut it down.  To your point, they started out a few games over .500 but to mine they couldn't sustain that play even with James in the lineup through the 55 games Lebron played."

"LeBron James  Dude is literally doing superhuman stuff at the age of 36 and people are just used to it. Should have won just about every MVP of his career but he is simply taken for granted. He has been in the league for 17 years and near the top for about 15 of them, people are so desperate to find the next LeBron they are largely missing LeBron"
"Lol imagine defending Lebron fucking James and thinking ""nah I can leave him"""
"AD does play with lebron James but you‚Äôre ignoring what he did individually.  His shooting was just another level in the playoffs. Dude was hitting contested midrange shots at like 50% , shooting 38% from 3, is obviously the best off ball big man in the game.   And yes defense is very important. Like incredibly important. AD was the best defensive player in the playoffs ."
AD plays with Lebron freaking James and that probably brings him down a tier for me. Your pair Jokic with Lebron. They also probably win a championship. Although I do recognize that AD's defense is like a couple of levels above Jokic.
"Lebron is the most loved. Say anything about the Lakers or king James, you‚Äôre met with a flurry of downvotes and hate"
"Did you forget center of the universe, lebron James?"
"Meanwhile the Spurs get a number one pick one time and build a dynasty, the Thunder's only time with a number one pick on the roster was Joe Smith for half of the first season which is also the only season under .500 in team history, and the Heat have never drafted number one and got a ring even before LeBron showed up.  The Wolves, however, have only made the playoffs one time without Kevin Garnett and that was with Jimmy Butler who only missed the playoffs one time in his career, on the 9th seeded Bulls who went 5-11 in the games Jimmy was out.  James Dolan would have done better with this team than Glen Taylor. An orangutan with a dartboard would have done better. The hivemind of r/nba would have done better.  It's a shame that Wolves fans have to deal with a team run worse than the Detroit Lions."
Brooklyn Nets vs Los Angeles Lakers   I want to watch Kevin Durant sweep LeBron James in the NBA Finals again. I just hope the Los Angeles Clippers don‚Äôt make the Finals.
"LeBron James, Mr. I Care So Much About Civil Rights, has supported Joe Biden despite Biden drafting the 1994 Crime Bill that has been the main reason why African Americans have been given such long sentences for menial crimes such as Marijuana Possession. You'd never see Muhammad Ali doing shit like that"
"You‚Äôre not hearing what I‚Äôm saying.  The Rockets‚Äô offensive system *is* James Harden, as the ‚Äò18 Cavs offense was LeBron, the 80s Lakers were Magic, etc. When you‚Äôre a ball handler at that level when the game gets that slow, you get to making a lot more of the decisions down the stretch especially without the second ball handler in Paul. It‚Äôs neither here nor there that the 0-27 was dispersed among 5 different guys. The offense was designed and executed to generate those looks, but to get over the hump when it‚Äôs a really close series you have to have the ability to transcend the schematic design, and he didn‚Äôt. Whether he couldn‚Äôt or didn‚Äôt is a conversation to be had, but I genuinely don‚Äôt understand why that admission and that fact is so hard to get through.  Steph gets shit on for not being able to get by Kevin Love in game 7 of the ‚Äò16 finals and for their offense not scoring a bucket the last 6 minutes of that game, it‚Äôs an identical concept."

Then you are really goddamn stupid lebron was mentioned after his loose to the mavs curry was ridiculed for years cp3 was also ridiculed james harden is insulted every weak kobe was also called a choker after a series every single star guys called out this is not singular to paul george the difference is that pg-13 made some dumb comment that make it easier to make fun off
"Yeah because LeBron James has never teamed up with star players to do the same thing, oh no"
Isaac ‚ÄúLeBron James‚Äù Okoro gets me hot and bothered
it‚Äôs not even remotely Hardens fault. 2018(?) was the year they were inches away. He‚Äôs had some down playoff series to be fair but really over the last 4 years he‚Äôs balled out in the regular season and the postseason. He‚Äôs a top 5 player and held to a standard basically only reserved for LeBron James. Losing Dantoni has really hurt and there‚Äôs no one but the owner to blame for that
"I think it's more of a issue for the fans. If a couple brings in their 2 kids because they want to see Lebron James, and it's a game time decision that he is not playing, they are paying for an incomplete experience.  Seats aren't cheap and who knows when they will be able to go to another game. I get that players need to rest because of injuries, there should be an updated status hours before the game."
"That's oversimplifying. Given the choice between a potential foundational talent and LeBron James, you stuff that foundational talent into a suitcase if it gives you the cap space to get LeBron."
Is it a full time regulation type game aka 4 quarters or is it just street ball up to 21? Cause if it's the latter....the WNBA team might not even touch the ball if LeBron's team gets it first. Anyway... I'm not betting against LeBron James against what is essentially high school level players.
"Lebron James exists, but outside of him I agree that Harden has carried his team the hardest"
They were saying tyreke had the best rookie season since lebron james(or since Melo in reality) at the time.   I remember when he hit that game winner. I thought I was watching a future top 5 player in the league.
I got 99 problems and LeBron James is all of them
Yes the source of everybody's depression is LeBron James
"This is such a dumb take. Your team had the second and third best player team up just to beat Lebron James, and Harden+CP3 took them further than anyone else did. If KD didn't join the Warriors Harden would have a ring. He gets eliminated because the other teams are just way better.  Harden hasn't disappointed, he has literally lost in the playoffs to a better team every time. Nobody expected Rockets to beat Warriors or Lakers. He averaged 35 ppg against the Warriors in a seven game series."
"And Ariza should have stopped being fed after going 0-6 or 0-7.  0-27 is James Harden‚Äôs legacy right now. Tell me that Chris Paul, LeBron James, Steph Curry, hell even guys from past generations like Bird or Jordan would keep dishing it out to a shot that‚Äôs missed 20 times already. Every guy I‚Äôve listed has a great playoff win in their resume because they either knew how to take over themselves or knew how to feed the hot hand. It‚Äôs about individual game feel and i never get the sense that Harden‚Äôs game feel is elite like those other guys. He‚Äôs made a living (a killing more accurately) playing the numbers, but playing the numbers doesn‚Äôt win you a ring."

"I was a Mavericks fan since 2000. If you were a fan of the team instead of being a Luka stan, you would see the poor moves management makes that break the team.  &amp;#x200B;  The Rondo trade for one. The Mavs were playing good ball and they broke their Offense for a guy that assist hunts. The team before had the ability to be unselfish on the offense and make hockey assists. They were a 4th seed.  The Odom Trade. This trade should never have been made simply for what he did to JJ Barea.  &amp;#x200B;  Right now the team is based around a Lebron James / James Harden type player who has an usage rate that outpaces his conditioning, surrounded by inconsistent shooters but they expect to live or die by the three. They are 28th in 3pt%.   * If you are going to trade someone, trade for someone who can shoot. Yet they traded a guy in Barnes that can shoot for Justin Jackson. * They drafted Shane Larkin over Giannis.  * They drafted Jalen Brunson, a player who assist hunts, shoots first, a poor defender, and is a black hole on offense over Mitchell Robinson. * They traded Shake Milton to the 76ers while keeping Isaiah Roby even though they had too many SFs at the time, and had Brunson backing Luka up. * They allowed McDermont to leave. * They traded Dennis Smith Jr to the Knicks so Luka can be the main focus on the offense. Yet he doesn't have the conditioning to play Lebron type minutes.  &amp;#x200B;  It's silly and sad. I don't wish to be a Mavs fan. I'm not a fan of that team anymore."
"This dude literally started watching last year or doesn't watch games because I don't know how you can watch what he did to Portland in the conference finals, and be an assist off averaging a triple double in the finals and call that useless.   Also the James Harden eye was in the 2019 playoffs while the LebRon eye was in 2018."

"As I‚Äôve continuously said, Bradley Beal is the most underrated player in the league by far, and the fact he wasn‚Äôt an all-star last year, is an absolute travesty. With the right team, he‚Äôs an all-nba level talent.   But I have to give this guy his true credit in being all class with his situation. Him missing the all-star game and being so disrespected, plus having these fucked up scoring nights and still losing, I don‚Äôt know how he hasn‚Äôt asked to be traded yet. It has to be driving him crazy inside. He‚Äôs the 2nd best 2 guard in the league if you count Harden as one. If not, he‚Äôs the best. Yes, #1. He‚Äôs better than Booker and Klay when healthy. His total offensive package, ability to create his own shot and work whilst being the single focal point of the offense last year is second to none in this league. On a bad nignt, he‚Äôs dropping 23.   If this guy played with LeBron James he‚Äôd be considered a top 10 player, I‚Äôm sure of it."

"Not trying to start a flame war here, these are just my actual reasons for disliking him. And I'd also like to say that I'm a huge Lebron hater, but even I can admit that he's phenomenal at the game of basketball. One of the best to ever do it, hands down. My problems with him are all about the other little things that go into being a superstar athlete.  Long story short, I feel like he's fake. Personally, I've dealt with early hair loss from when I was 19 and it's a rough thing to deal with as a guy at that age. Lebron also dealt with this same issue and I think that the way that he responded gets to the heart of why I think he's fake. There's the obvious... he got some fake hair surgically put on his head. But there's also a deeper meaning behind him trying to deny the reality of going bald. It shows what his priorities and motivations are. He cares about what everybody else thinks about him and I think that this one thing is the core reason for many of the obstacles he's run into during his career.  To be fair, I don't blame him too much for struggling with baldness. I know exactly how much it sucks especially when you're barely in your 20s and nobody else your age is losing hair. It makes you feel alone, it makes you self-conscious, like everybody you talk to is looking at your hairline, and it's usually the first time in your life where you start realizing ""Fuck... I'm not immortal. My body is deteriorating and eventually I'm going to become old and weak and die."" I fully understand why something like this would have a huge impact on somebody like Lebron. His entire identity growing up was his body and his fame. The entire world knew about him, talked about him, watched him because he was gifted with the *perfect* body. But the problem with perfection is that even the smallest flaws can ruin it. And Lebron's ""flaw"" was smack dab in the middle of his head. So, again, I don't really blame him for the headbands and the surgeries and the insecurity.  But I also can't ever think of him as the GOAT over Michael Jordan. How can I? MJ dealt with the same hair loss bullshit as Lebron and he didn't even blink. He shaved that shit immediately because he didn't give a flying fuck about hair or looks. All of that was just a distraction from his mission and his mission was to be the best to ever play the game. He shaved his head at a time when toupees were still a thing and NOBODY thought baldness was cool. Here's a quote from GQ that says it better than I can:  &gt; [But Jordan‚Äôs head was a thing of beauty. Bald men everywhere should worship him as a god for making the bald head manly and totemic. Sure, there was Yul Brynner as the petulant King of Siam, and Telly Savalas as Kojak‚Äîwhom many menopausal women considered the sexiest man alive‚Äîbut Jordan was like a hairless Hercules, a superman with a noble pate that made him look stronger than Samson, grinning like a death‚Äôs-head at the opponents he would dunk over. Taking flight, His Airness made hair seem un-aerodynamic. Like bad design. Jordan‚Äôs baldness made him as changeless as a sculpture. Monumental. Without Michael Jordan, there would be no Ving Rhames, no hair-free Samuel L. Jackson, no chrome-domed Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal, no cue-ball Kobe, no glabrescent Vin Diesel.](https://www.gq.com/story/michael-jordan)  Michael Jordan legitimately improved my life and the lives of men all over the planet for the rest of time. He didn't try to do it, he didn't talk about doing it, he didn't donate money or build a school to help people. He helped people by being himself and not caring about anybody else or their opinions of him. That's the template; the instruction manual that MJ left for Lebron and for men everywhere to be great too. Know what your goals are, dedicate everything you have to achieving those goals, and fuck everything and everybody else.  Lebron failed to do this and that's why I don't like him. He worries about what he looks like, he holds press conferences to explain changing teams, he talks about how many titles he's going to win, he flops, he blames air conditioning for bad games, he wears casts after loses in the Finals, he's got an army of Nike-funded journalists that just try to make him look good, and he's always doing social justice PR while staying quiet if the social justice hurts his pocketbook. He's pretending to be a role-model though words, but a real role-model inspires people through action.  Lebron James is fake."
"35 year old Lebron James would have finished with 17 assists. He‚Äôs washed up. Not impressed. Actually not a fan anymore, just disappointed."
"I think the point you're missing is LeBron went to several finals with a whole cast of different players, even went there with Illgaskus and Boobie Gibson and then a decade later with Love and George Hill, meanwhile Jordan has only been there with Pippen. Lebron made it work with so many different #2s and #3s meanwhile Jordan got sent home in the first round 3 times üò≥.   Lebron has gone to the finals with 5 different head coaches. FIVE. How many coaches has Jordan gone with again??  I would how Jordan's career would look like if you replaced Jackson and Pippen. Probably not very good, might be closer to James Harden than a top 2 all time player."
"burner account, KD in the name, lebron james involved, plus weapons. its the perfect media story."
"The same goes for Abdul-Jabbar (the time he repeated, he was 40+ and way out of his prime), Chamberlain and Bird.      2 of those 3 still have legit cases to be the goat.      Would Kevin Durant be any more proven than Abdul-Jabbar, Duncan, Chamberlain, Bird just because he repeated/defended?.. This is not boxing...      ‚Äî    It‚Äôs LeBron James btw."
He‚Äôs never proven it by winning w/o the goat coach  See: LeBron James
"Uh, Michael Jordan? LeBron James?"
"In a world where AD's defense took 10 points off the scoreboard every game in the playoffs, otherwise known as the world we live in.  EDIT: Look, this is clearly a Lebron PR/stan thread, I was replying to some guy named ""Lebron James"" or ""Lebronto"", so I'm going to get downvotes. But it happened. Go watch all the missed Miami layups. AD was the best player in the playoffs last year. He's the reason they had such a nasty D. And defense is what one it for them."
"I was guessing before, and your comment made me double check. So here's the math, for those interested.   Tldr; Nope. Not quite half his life yet. But, he **will** officially have spent more of his life in the NBA than out of it on **12/21/21**! A nice and tidy date, for sure, and only 9 days prior to his 37th birthday. Math below. I spent too much time on this.    OK so he was born Dec 30, 1984. Making him **13,156** days old as of today, Jan 6, 2021.   So since my statement was about how long he's been in the NBA, and not specifically how long he's been PLAYING professional basketball, I'm going to refer to the day he was drafted, Jun 26, 2003. On that day he was **6,752** days old. That day was **6,404** days ago, today. So, OK. Not quite halfway there yet.    But now I'm interested. When WOULD he hit the ""Over half his life in the NBA"" mark? Let's double 6,752 to make **13,504**. When he's that many days old it'll be even Steven. So let's add one to it. **13,505**.   So 13,505 days after his birth date of 12/30/84 is. No shit. December 21st of this year. 2021. So **12/21/21**! That's... Surprisingly convenient timing! I offer a very early ""Happy King James Day"" to LeBron. Hope he takes a moment to celebrate on 122121.   Unless my math is somehow off, of course. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong."

"Those numbers are pretty crazy is the wild part of it,  just not by his standards.  How many dudes in the league can pull that on cruise control on any given night?  Luka?  Jokic?  Maybe Jimmy Butler if he's playing good?  There's not just many that do everything he does at that type of level, all the time without considering age, let alone with that as a factor.  A lot of people hate on, or disagree with him as a person or player, but from a purely basketball perspective its a privilege to watch him play.  I'm not his biggest fan,  but this type of player comes along once a generation.....maybe.    Often the ones slated to be the next LeBron James, are very good but lack something to their game.  The biggest pull for LeBron in my opinion, is setting IQ and everything aside the dude can do literally everything on the floor at a very high level."
LeBron James type shit. Maybe that was the advice LeBron gave him after the bubble postgame when they talked to each other on the court after the game.  LeBron is smart with this shit. Told Grant to go get your own team you special. Wouldn't be surprised if he signs with Klutch pretty soon.
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there. People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant. The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime. Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime. And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball. Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game. So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better. You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that. This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever. So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like ~~LeBron James~~ The Best Player in the World‚Ñ¢, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

AD is not a top 5 player. How quickly we forget how he underachieved in New Orleans.  Ask Lakers fans how there offense looked last year when LeBron was out. They struggled. Lakers are a totally different team without Goatman James.
everytime ESPN calls him Lebron James without a jump shot I die a bit inside

"Cause it came from Morey.   He's not the greatest scorer of...anything, he's not even the greatest scorer of his generation - that's LeBron/KD right now.  Here's some regular season career averages for comparison:  - LeBron James, 11 seasons: 27.2ppg on 59% TS  - Kevin Durant, 9 seasons: 27ppg on 61% TS  - James Harden, 9 seasons: 25ppg on 61% TS  For reference's sake:  - Michael Jordan, 13 seasons, 30.1ppg on 57% TS"
Him averaging 20 at the age alone is an accomplishment. He was dropping 40+ at that age as well. How much do you expect a 40 year old man who just came out of retirement to carry a team to the playoffs?   Did you even know he got injured during his time on the Wizards? Did you know the reason he even joined the Wizards was because he thought he would have a future as a minor owner in the organization?   Don‚Äôt let your love for LeBron James cloud your judgement. You should also get your facts straight before comparing two players. Players at the age of 40 are usually out of the league or at the end of the bench.
"Think about all the storylines coming into the season.   Will Giannis be able to lead the Bucks one more and stay in Milwaukee if significant improvement isn't made?  Will James Harden stay in Houston after wanting a trade?   Will Lebron and co. repeat in the hard, hard West?  How will Lamelo do with Charlotte?  Anthony Edwards in Minnesota?  Kyrie and KD with the Nets?   Can Toronto come back in the East?  How about the Celtics?  Are the Warriors still to be feared?  Are the Clips a team that's for real?  And yet all these questions, *all of them* will pale in comparison to the Knicks now becoming a contender.   The flood of Starks, Ewing and Stoudamire jerseys flooding the streets. Hide your wives, hide your kids - things are about to change and they might get ugly."

Regardless, let's say it was a BS call, what about Games 6 and 7?  Too mentally weak to bounce back?  Nah, I'm sure that you think Curry's ejection in the last minutes cost them the game *and* was bullshit too?"
"No i mean in general. For example, ppl use to hug lebron james but now its a flagrant."
Super saturated with a bunch of guys who will never beat Kevin Durant or Lebron James in a playoff series
"Better player, but not in terms of skills. Giannis is just an athletic monster and a good defender. Yes, that's a lot, but his other skills lack like passing, dribbling and shooting. Plus he is nowhere near LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and KD. Tatum can eventually get on this level, but who knows? Right now the obvious choice is Giannis, but in hmmm 4-5 years.  I don't think so!"
"You could maybe add Dwight in there too, I guess. Also, the Lakers have a decent collection of all time SFs as well: Elgin Baylor, Adrian Dantley, Jamaal Wilkes, James Worthy and now LeBron. They've also had a good number of HOF PFs too: Vern Mikkelsen, Connie Hawkins, Bob McAdoo, Dennis Rodman, Karl Malone, Pau Gasol and now AD."
"It's not just the duration, a player can be playing for so long but has turned into entirely useless, relegated at the end of the bench and is clearly a shell of his former self. We watched this painfully as Mcgrady, Kobe, Shaq, Carter, Jordan, Melo etc.. is slowly withering away---skills eroded---once unflappable confidence gone. Father time is clearly winning.  Watching Lebron James defy father time is a gift to the sport--Every game is a defiance. He's not there playing just so he can keep grabbing cash. He is still playing like one of the best out there and when Playoff time comes, you can put it in the bank---He is still the best... by far."

"So you either have great defense, or have Lebron James, that‚Äôs really all that‚Äôs being said here."
Blame Lebron James then . He started all of this . But fuck people for logging onto Reddit and trashing the same 4 players it‚Äôs annoying . I‚Äôve never seen anyone talk about AD for literally doing worse than what harden did. Harden/ Kyrie/George/KD
"Nets are a mess. Kyrie doesn't seem to want to play, and has a leg out the door of the league, and is feuding with the head coach.   Harden is out of shape and clearly unmotivated.   Durant...well who knows, what KD is thinking but he's prolly thinking that im stuck on a team with no futures with two headcase guards(well Harden might have to be a centre if he gains anymore mass cause he'll have gravitational pull).   I can get giving in and letting someone like Lebron James or Kobe Bryant run shit because they are legit top 5 all time guys, and they have drive and are committed to being the best.   But Harden and Kyrie, especially right now, dont seem to have the drive, they don't have the motivation, and care more about their image and partying than staying in top shape and competing night in and night out."
"All these weeks leading up to yesterday I've seen every trade proposal with even the least bit of caution or desire to not just bet the farm on securing a deal be shouted down in this sub with a resounding ""fuck caution!/You could have JAMES FUCKING HARDEN on your team!/he'll make it work!/etc"" It's been absolutely insufferable  Obviously Houston fans are gonna have a vested interest in arguing for as good of a haul as possible but I don't think I can overstate Harden as one of those perennial MVP candidates on par with Lebron Giannis Kawhi etc. and responsibility is a necessary part of that prestige. You're expected to be able to put the team on your back to at least a level on par with those other MVPs, playoff success is obviously a part of that too, why else do you even entertain the notion of giving up ALL your picks/role players/depth to get him???  So it just comes off extremely rich to me that after everything is said and done, people want to actually evaluate his tenure and NOW every year has some convenient excuse to it"
"I agree with you 100%. Harden gets penalized for having the second best carry jobs while lebron has been in the league. Harden has literally went against all time versions of squads and people shit on him for it. I'm not making excuses for his losses or some bad performances but james is a god tier player and at the end of the day he got fucking tired of carrying. Yall heard what he said to curry at the all star game....""hall look like yall have fun, I don't like doing this every night"" while he was dropping 35ppg. The harden hate is on full blast tonight."

"&gt; so Cavs just lost their franchise player for nothing  That is false. LeBron was signed and traded to the Miami. Here's the haul.  &gt; July 10, 2010: The Cleveland Cavaliers agreed to a sign-and-trade deal with the Miami Heat to acquire the rights to five future draft picks and receive a traded player exception for free-agent forward LeBron James, Cavaliers General Manager Chris Grant announced today. Per team and league policy, terms of the contract were not released.  &gt; ""This deal provides us with multiple key assets and additional flexibility as we move forward for both the short term and beyond,"" said Cavaliers General Manager Chris Grant.   &gt; 2011 2nd round draft pick (Milan Maƒçvan was later selected), a 2012 2nd round draft pick (Jae Crowder was later selected), a 2013 1st round draft pick (Nemanja Nedoviƒá was later selected) and a 2016 1st round draft pick (Timoth√© Luwawu-Cabarrot was later selected). Cleveland also received a trade exception from Miami. Cleveland had the option to swap 1st round draft picks with Miami in 2012 but did not do so."
"To clear any confusion and prevent misunderstandings:  &gt; July 10, 2010: **LeBron James was traded by the Cleveland Cavaliers to the Miami Heat** for a 2011 2nd round draft pick (Milan Maƒçvan was later selected), a 2012 2nd round draft pick (Jae Crowder was later selected), a 2013 1st round draft pick (Nemanja Nedoviƒá was later selected) and a 2016 1st round draft pick (Timoth√© Luwawu-Cabarrot was later selected). Cleveland also received a trade exception from Miami. Cleveland had the option to swap 1st round draft picks with Miami in 2012 but did not do so."
"The draft order is tied to salary numbers, and not all #1 picks are created equally. You would have to do some pretty serious gymnastics to fix rookie contracts, like allow a player to shop for contracts if they don't like what their selecting team offers.       For example, Lebron james was a #1 pick and Deandre Ayton was a #1 pick. I know which one was worth 25m a year in their first year and which one was...not."
Rookie Lebron James made 4m/year.  Rookie Kobe made like a million. Because of the draft and rookie salary rules. They're nonsense.
I don't want no one saying Kawhi Leonard and Lebron James in the same sentence... The same paragraph... The same essay... Unless trash comes after Kawhis name
"MIAMI -- The side door to the newly refurbished gym opened, a blast of sunlight splashed into the darkened corner, and 100 children began shrieking in unison. LeBron James was thrilled.  ""It never gets old,"" James said.  That was the reception Wednesday when the LeBron James Family Foundation and Hewlett-Packard began rolling out what will soon be 1,000 new computers to 59 different Boys &amp; Girls Clubs nationwide. At the Miami club, the roof is getting replaced and workspaces for kids are being spruced up with furniture from the HomeCourt line that James designs with girlfriend Savannah Brinson.  It's all part of the commitment James made last summer, when his hour-long ""The Decision"" special on July 8, 2010 -- in which he said he was joining the Miami Heat -- raised more than $3 million for charity.  https://www.espn.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/news/story?id=6175574  100% of the money from the decision went to charity. These kids don't have computers, courts to play on, roofs replaced if he doesn't have 'a whole TV show about it'  $6 million total for charity, most of it went to the boy's and girl's club  https://www.cleveland.com/ohio-sports-blog/2010/07/lebron_james_decision_generate.html"
Facts. He‚Äôs got his super team now. James and KD better step or they‚Äôll hear about it for the rest of their lives. Ask lebron.
"The Decision is completely different for a few reasons.  It was less about the Cavs and more about Lebron and the NBA overall. He was the face of the NBA. When you have that pressure and fail That‚Äôs a lot of disappointed people. Especially with the cringey press conference on the runway. Making fun of Dirk, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Lebron James‚Äù etc.   Some rando does that he‚Äôs just a joker that no one cares about. The face of the NBA does it it‚Äôs a bad look on a whole other level."
Imagine James Harden with Lebron James.
Curry and Durant were similar level players and also played alongside two All-NBA tier players (Green and Thompson) and a SMOTY candidate (Iguodala). LeBron James is clearly the best player on his team and the third best player on their team arguably isn't even as good as Iguodala was.
"The last month of the 2019 regular season was wild. Crawford dropped 50, Grayson dropped 40 , Kuzma shoved Lebron in the back and woke up a Laker the next day, DLo eliminated the Lakers from playoff contention and fucking Mario Hezonja had a game winning block on Lebron James"
"""I've never been part of a superteam""  -Lebron james"
"God this hurts my brain. I swear to god there was a thread a week ago about how AD locked down jimmy whenever he was on ball, and jimmy only dominated when AD was off him.  Now everyone is saying Lebron guarded him, so Jimmy dropped 30 ppg and 10‚Äô assists per game while being defended by Lebron James AND Anthony Davis constantly?"
I was excited to see if KD could pull off something like LeBron did in Cleveland. Or Dirk in Dallas. Then they got James Harden for peanuts. Bleh. I hate it.  They‚Äôre going to be dominant assuming Kyrie returns.
"That doesn't mean he makes all the decisions though. It's clear he didn't want Kyrie traded.  &gt;According to the Athletic, when then-Cavs coach Tyronn Lue learned that the Irving trade was about to happen, he drove to meet James and put the latter on the phone with Cleveland General Manager Koby Altman. James was described as ‚Äúadamant‚Äù that Irving should not be dealt away, and Altman reportedly assured the four-time MVP that the trade would not occur.  &gt;A few minutes later, it did, James discovered to his noticeable dismay.

James also implied that Gilbert, with whom he had a frosty relationship dating back at least to the owner‚Äôs infamous ‚Äúcomic sans‚Äù letter in 2010, had ousted former general manager David Griffin to gain more control over his team‚Äôs personnel moves.  &gt;‚ÄúTake nothing from Koby, because Koby [was just named GM], but at that point in time, you realize that Koby‚Äôs not the only one running the team, as [Griffin] had done, and that‚Äôs why Griff was let go, pretty much,‚Äù James said.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/11/20/lebron-james-cavs-kyrie-irving-trade-was-beginning-end-everything/  I think you should apologize, again."

"Are you even reading what you post? How does that make you right about LeBron trying to trade Kyrie?  &gt;**Team and league sources refute that, saying that it was Griffin who initiated the trade talks with Phoenix. Griffin, who is close with Irving, sensed both his unhappiness and his restlessness and was preparing for the possibility that Irving would request a trade. But once Griffin was no longer employed by the team, the conversations stalled.**  So Irving being convinced LeBron wanted him gone makes it so but the GM who was in charge of everything is simply lying about what happened?   And LeBron specifically [telling Altman](https://theathletic.com/660104/2018/11/19/lebron-james-cavaliers-trading-of-kyrie-irving-was-beginning-of-the-end-of-everything/?source=dailyemail) not to trade Kyrie - especially not to the Celtics is also just a fabrication?   &gt;James was adamant on the call - do not trade Irving, especially to the Celtics. By the end of the call, according to four separate accounts of people present for the conversation, Altman told James the trade would not occur.  Like I said. You live in your own little world where things happen differently."
"That doesn't prove anything. Yes Kyrie assumed Lebron had approved trading him which incensed him and caused him to demand a trade himself, but Lebron was always against any Kyrie trades. There are multiple sources in this thread. For example  &gt;There was excitement in Cleveland for the pieces the Cavs got in the Irving trade. But as the season has unfolded, second-guessing has been developing.

"That‚Äôs a player they traded for **after** James resigned. You said he joined stacked teams, but none of them were stacked when he joined them. You‚Äôre using trades made **after** he went there as proof that he joined 3 stacked teams. You‚Äôre wrong, an asshole - although I‚Äôm an asshole too and I admit it and apologize for being so stupid and wrong about the years and nomenclature - and making shit up because you‚Äôve got Lebron Derangement Syndrome  But you‚Äôre literally picking on the least significant details to invalidate the whole point. Because you‚Äôre pathetic and unable to admit you‚Äôre wrong."
"&gt;You keep saying winning one title at the cost of losing multiple titles like you have some sort of crystal ball and you know for a FACT the Lakers would have won multiple titles and that‚Äôs just not the case. If you can definitively prove to me that LA would have won multiple titles without the trade (which you can‚Äôt) then you‚Äôll be correct.  You are still missing the point.  You can also not prove that the Lakers only won because of that trade, and you can also not prove that the Lakers would not be better for the next X years had they not made that trade.  Which means that any such trade is not an ""automatic"" win.  &gt;I like Ingram I was hoping the Lakers would Keep him instead of Kuzma but he‚Äôs not going to be an all star and average 25 a game on the Lakers.  You don't know that, and are still missing the point.  &gt;The Lakers pre AD were good enough to make the playoffs and are finals contenders because of LeBron and LeBron only.   You don't know that, and are still missing the point.  &gt;People didn‚Äôt think LeBron and AD would be the Clippers would you have been more confident with LeBron and Ingram?  You are still missing the point.  That said, they traded far more than just Ingram for Davis.  The assets they spent on Davis would've been enough to acquire, for just two examples, both Jimmy Butler and Malcom Brogdon.  So they could potentially have been something like James, Brogdon, Butler, Ingram, and Zubac ( who they traded separately to make room for Davis ) -- with Hart, Ball, Kuzma, Caruso, and others off the bench.  That lineup competes with anyone, to say the least.  &gt;Also please tell me what year LeBron won a title with less talent than what the Lakers would have been cus I wasn‚Äôt here for it  You should pay more attention then.  &gt;And your lottery analogy is not at all on par the lottery is 100% random luck and lottery tickets are what? 2 dollars? I don‚Äôt see how that compares at all here  The Davis trade was a massive risk.  Just because it paid off does not mean it was a wise investment -- just like lottery tickets are not a wise investment just because someone wins.  Yet, those winners probably unanimously believe them to be wise, after the fact."
Yeah LeBron James will do that to you.
LeBron James looks nothing like that.
"I think it‚Äôs partially true what you are saying, that being said context for an athlete type of Lebron James matters. If he opts out, he loses on fortunes of dollars, his reputation makes a huge hit, he gets a ton of hate and criticism, and he will be judged accordingly. Those factors would not be in play for you and me, even guys like Avery Bradley because those athletes simply are not as impactful and talked about as much"
The Los Angeles Clippers are a better team than the Los Angeles Lakers.   As a Kevin Durant fan.... I want the Los Angeles Lakers to make the NBA Finals. LeBron James will have a 1-3 NBA Finals record against Kevin Durant.  Nets in 4.
Shoutout to the Nets for giving a *Lebron James-led Los Angeles Lakers* the opportunity to go through this season without being the epicenter of basketball media attention.
"KD won't be able to box out AD though, like Bam and Jokic really couldn't do it all that well and those dudes are clear of KD in the strength portion of their games.... so KD's gonna hit a few jumpers over AD, no question, but it will fall on him to box AD out when Kyrie and James Harden miss... he might get destroyed whenever AD's near the basket, which is always.   Nets are gonna take a lot of threes and their best two rebounders aren't a locked in AD and Lebron, but KD, whose okay and Deandre, whose not that guy anymore."
"Since 2008 we've seen 6 or 7 out of 13 teams win a title that could be called superteams. Superteams being 2+ all stars being brought in via FA or trade and not homegrown or in Durant's case an MVP favorite joining a 73 win team with 3 all stars who just won a title.. 13/26 teams to make the finals in that span could be considered superteams  * 2008 Cetlics: KG and Allen join up with Pierce (3 all stars) * 2011-2014 Miami Heat: Chris Bosh and LeBron James join with Wade (3 all stars) * 2015-2017 Cleveland Caveliers: Kevin Love and LeBron James join Irving (3 all stars) * 2017-2019 Warriors: Durant and DeMarcus Cousins joins Steph, Klay, Draymond on a 73 win team (4-5 all stars) * 2020 Lakers: LeBron and Davis join the Lakers within one year of eachother. They didn't team up with an all star in LA, but you had 2 top 5ish players teaming up around the same time.  So while we only saw one true super super team (2017 Warriors) we've seen a lot more of all star caliber teammates joining forces and seeing success. Even teams like the LA Clippers, while not a conference or NBA champion, had two all NBA level guys agree to team up together and join during the same offseason. You also have Durant and Irving teaming up in Brooklyn and Harden forcing his way there.  Prior to 2008 there were not as many instances of all star teammates all joining up simultaneously for a chance to win a title. Sure you had your old vets who were ring chasing, or sometimes you had front offices making a blockbuster trade to acquire another star player (a la 2005 Miami getting Shaq to pair with Wade) but almost all of those instances had the team in question developing homegrown talent (Wade etc...) and then trading for a star to pair alongside. Not 2 or 3 teammates deciding to all meet up during the same offseason.  Prior we had seen the 2004 Lakers with an aged Payton and Malone join Kobe/Shaq. We saw an aging Charles Barkley join up with Clyde Drexler (who had joined the season prior) and Hakeem in Houston. In 1983 you had the Sixers and in '69 you had Wilt and Jerry West. So superteams have always existed, but the level of star players joining forces all at once, and specifically at the players request has been unprecedented.  That's not to say it's necessarily a bad thing, and I don't think it's really hurt parity too much, but it is just something to note. In the era of player empowerment (which I'm 100% here for) there have been a lot more superteams forming at the hands of the players, rather than in days past where FOs would draft/develop all NBA guys Bird/McHale/Parish Celtics, MJ/Pippen Bulls, Dirk/Nash/Finley Mavs, Duncan/Manu/Parker/Robinson Spurs"
Step 1: Pretend to be an un-tradeable asset by going AWOL and violating COVID protocols.   Step 2: Trade for James Harden by only giving up picks and role players  Step 3: Lebron is 36.
"&gt;So let‚Äôs play the hypothetical game. I can just as easily say what if another team trades for AD he loves it there and decides to stay?   This is exactly why trading a decade of assets for one year of Davis was an overpayment.  He could have walked from the Lakers as well.  &gt;What if Ingram loses confidence being in trade talks for 2 seasons? What if LeBron gets hurt having to carry an increased workload during the season? Who knows how the Lakers young players play in the bubble.  You are still missing the point.  It is possible to lose a trade, and still win a title.  You are hung up on one example, of millions of potential scenarios.  Winning one title at a cost of losing multiple titles is not a win.  Whether or not that happened in this case is irrelevant, and doesn't change the fact that it could happen.  Therefore, winning a title does not automatically make every move that team made into a win.  &gt;The Lakers won a title BECAUSE OF THE AD TRADE not because they‚Äôre the Lakers so they have to win every couple of seasons.  This is just as hypothetical as your above complaint.  James and Ingram -- and all those other players -- could have won.  James has won with less than the Lakers would've had last year, without Davis.  It's not as though the Lakers went to overtime in game 7 of every series.  &gt;Championships are never a given. Injuries happen and all types of randomness you just can‚Äôt account for.   Which is another reason that trading a decade of assets for one season of one player is a massive overpayment, and a bad idea.  Especially when you could likely have that same player for ""free"" as a free agent.  &gt;The Lakers are my second favorite team ask any Lakers fan do they make that trade 99/100 will say yes nobody cares about their teams past history they want to see them win now  I am aware of the conventional wisdom, and it's still wrong.  Ask anyone who has won a Powerball jackpot if playing the lottery is a wise investment, and you will get equally-poor advice.  Without that trade, the Lakers may have won last year anyway, but even if they didn't, they would be in unbelievable shape right now."
"Except it doesn‚Äôt.  Teams who win tend to have good culture. In the last decade: the NBA championship team with the ‚Äúworst‚Äù culture was probably the Cavs. Mavs were about team culture, Heat were about team culture, Spurs team culture, Warriors team culture, Raps team culture, Lakers added talent and fixed their culture to get there. The Mavs and Raps were certainly not the most talented teams the years they won. And some of the others are debatable.   LeBron James moves around and is about talent. But love him or hate him, nobody ever questions his work ethic or commitment. Even when he pulls diva shit, it isn‚Äôt destructive to overall team culture.   Kyrie on the other hand."
**Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal** played with:  - Penny Hardaway - Horace Grant - Eddie Jones - Nick Van Exel - Glen Rice - Kobe Bryant - Dennis Rodman - Gary Payton - Karl Malone - Dwyane Wade - Alonzo Mourning - Steve Nash - Grant Hill - Amar'e Stoudemire - LeBron James - Mo Williams - Ray Allen - Kevin Garnett - Paul Pierce - Rajon Rondo - Jermaine O‚ÄôNeal  In terms of playing with the most talent it‚Äôs probably someone like Horry or Mccaw who went to multiple championship teams but among stars it‚Äôs Shaq
"It‚Äôs what the owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers wrote, yes in Comic Sans font, when LeBron James left for Miami in 2010"
"This picture shows us how unprofessional James Harden is.  James Harden is a unique attacking talent, but he doesn't have the mentality of a champion like LeBron James.  He doesn't have the thirst for victory that drives LeBron James to keep working harder than anyone else when he is 36 years old."
"Man when they did the lineup intros on the radio in Cleveland when LeBron was here he‚Äôd go ‚ÄúLeBron James, St Vincent St Mary, ALL POSITIONS.‚Äù"
What if Zion went to Kentucky and wanted to play with AD or just wanted to win? He could easily get endorsement deals and and start off his career making less but being mentored by Lebron James. Win tons of titles and then go forge his own path.   You also now would have nba teams recruiting college athletes.
"He has some iconic calls too, like ‚ÄúLeBron James with no regard for human life!‚Äù But Mike Breen‚Äôs bang are unbeatable"
‚ÄúNow they‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs LeBron James‚Äù
"Yeah in terms of basketball moves, this is one of the best in recent memory. I'm mainly saying that as a fan of a team who won a ring not even two years ago in the exact circumstances you outlined, this sub (and NBA socials in general) remember the injuries more than the ring, if that makes sense.  It's just unrealistic for any team to beat them any other way (there's only one LeBron James in the NBA, after all), so salty  execs or not, expecting anyone to contend is a foregone conclusion."
This. Michael Jordan did not start out as a good defender. LeBron James did not start out as a good defender. Very few top offensive players start out as good defenders. It‚Äôs somehow astonishing to people that players could actually improve aspects of their game throughout their career.
Fat James Harden is what ruined those jerseys more than anything IMO.  And then LeBron and AD getting soul-stealing highlights didn't help neither.
"To be fair, I think it ain‚Äôt diminish his career status to play with those players if he has been the best among them at that period of time.  I do believe if there‚Äôs no man called LeBron James in this world, Durant would become the #1 basketball player in the world for a decent time"
I remember skip bayless called lebron leAlfred james when he was on the heat to troll him
"He had JR playing really good defense, Shumpert paying good defense. Varejao was a good help defender with quick rotations and taking charges. Mozgov was a good enough rim protector that year. Triston Thompson was a really good help defender and was good at guarding pick and roll. Oh and one of the best team defenders ever - LeBron James telling them where to be on every play. Cleveland was a top 3 defense that year when they locked down in the playoffs if i remember correctly."
The decision 2 by LeBron James Harden
"It won't be, stars want to stack the deck and play with good players obviously.  Super teams have existed in literally every decade, from the '86 Celtics to the '04 Lakers and now the '21 Nets, it will continue to be a trend because FO want to win and players also want it.  LeBron James wouldn't have refused Kawhi in 2019 if he had chose the Lakers, players don't give a shit about competitive balance and just want to play for a great team. Super teams are also incredible for the league because it creates a clear narrative and a target, everybody knows who has to be beaten and for casual fans that's actually easier to watch.  To sum it up, dynasties move this league forward and the 80s Lakers/Celtics, 90s Bulls, 00s Lakers/Spurs and the Warriors prove that, also there are a bunch of examples of failed superteams, of the top of my head i can think of the '97 Rockets (Hakeem, Drexler and Barkley), the '99 Rockets (Hakeem, Barkley and Pippen) and the '04 Lakers, so the Nets aren't really championship locks."
"Lebron has such a good narrative and he is clearly the Lakers best player early this season, but the problem for him is, that Luka's narrative as a 3rd seed would just as good and when his numbers are clearly better, he will probably run away with it.   The NBA world knows that they will need a passing of the torch within the next few years and Luka is a few hundred hours with Rosetta Stone away from being a great candidate for that.  Doncic or Giannis are the best regular season players and the rewards for the post-season are FMVP and a ring, so that not that many people would feel bad for James not getting the MVP."
Who's talking about giannis? also when has Giannis played next to lebron fucking james lol  How about when they played each other in the ECSF? Giannis: 28/11/5/1/2 on 52/41/70  Kyrie: 20/4/6/1 on !! 36/22/91 splits
"Have you looked at who the last like 20 NBA champions have been? Pretty much all Spurs, Lakers, Heat, Warriors.   It‚Äôs not like the NBA is some beautiful gem of parity now lol   We reward franchises that are run like shit with elite players. Hey Dan Gilbert, you‚Äôve sucked for years. Lucky for you that sucking has awarded you with LeBron James."
"Cleveland‚Äôs economy is based on LeBron James.  Going by this info, he‚Äôs worth at least 100k."
Anthony Davis is scared of the Brooklyn Nets. Kevin Durant has a history of destroying LeBron James and Anthony Davis in the playoffs.   Nets in 4 against the Los Angeles Lakers or Clippers.
LeBron James - Player Coach GM Agent
I thought it might be Lebron james of the grizzlies but glad it was clarified
"I think this is very true. It‚Äôs like when Rondo said he had to stay on Bron to change his body language his first year in LA because when the young guys made mistakes and Bron got down on them they would be hurt and it would effect their play, because they didn‚Äôt want to let him down.   ‚ÄúWhen guys are making the same mistakes over and over and over, it‚Äôs hard to bite your tongue but I tried to get [James] to focus on his body language‚Ä¶Those young guys were looking at everything he did. If they missed four shots in a row and LeBron was making a face, it was crushing to them. He was their Michael Jordan. They didn‚Äôt want to let him down. But if LeBron said one thing positive to Brandon Ingram or Kyle Kuzma, they immediately were back to their old selves.‚Äù"
"I'm not finding these. The worst I saw was Eddie House saying LeBron quit in the 2011 finals. Mario Chalmers even said LeBron was a good teamate and guy, although difficult  [https://cavsnation.com/mario-chalmers-speaks-lebron-james-teammate/](https://cavsnation.com/mario-chalmers-speaks-lebron-james-teammate/)  I do agree with your point. Especially the threat of being traded and having to perform at a high level when playing with him (LeBron's gonna trade you chants)"
"I saw Lebron James at a party last night in Los Angeles. He broke all NBA health guidelines, there was no social distancing or masks. He needs to be suspended or quarantined immediately he could be infected."
Lakers really are blowing out teams while LeBron James and AD are coasting
**Lebron James is good at basketball**
"Lol why the hell is this response.  It‚Äôs obviously bad for the league that the teams have no control over their players.  It‚Äôs bad that a team like the rockets don‚Äôt have control over their roster and that James Harden can completely dictate what happens. It‚Äôs bad that the Nets don‚Äôt have any clue what‚Äôs going on with Kyrie and he can just take time off.  It‚Äôs bad that when LeBron is on a team the coach is irrelevant. All of these things are bad for the NBA. This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúboomer‚Äù mindset, whatever the fuck that means, and this isn‚Äôt ‚Äúsending them back to the mines‚Äù. The NBA pays $41 million for every single game played. $3.4 billion each regular season is spent on the on 450 NBA players in the league. I‚Äôm not sending these dudes ‚Äúback to the mines‚Äù for expecting them to play basketball for that much money. Get a grip, man."
"But In the 2000s you never really knew who was gonna come out of the conference. It could have been the Mavs, Lakers, Suns, or Spurs any year, plus Kings in the early half. Then there were teams like Melo Nuggets, CP3 Hornets beating some of those top 4 contending teams. Even in the early 2010s, Mavs, Lakers, Spurs, OKC were still battling it out until the Warriors arrived.   In the Eastern Conference, It was like a different team every year up until Lebron James became Lebron James. It's really the perfect team assembly of Golden State and Lebron being as great as he is that destroyed parity for a bit."
Kevin Durant is not better than Lebron James. Lebron was able to carry a sorry-ass Cavs team to 5 Finals. Kevin had to join the greatest basketball team of all time to win a championship. Lebron has been and always will be better than KD.
?? Lebron James is currently competing against Michael as the GOAT  I actually quite like Durant but he is absolutely not at Lebron‚Äôs level
Lebron Raymone James
"LeBron ""Paul George"" James"
"As a Lebron detractor, I have to absolutely give James his due: no ‚Äúload management‚Äù or any of that weak ass shit. He balls hard every night and gives you something.  Guys 10 years younger are taking days off who‚Äôve barely won shit, while James is still at peak physicality and showing up to work."
Lebron becoming prime James harden at 36yo lol
LeBron James
I love LeBron James.
"Man I can‚Äôt wait for the Lebron James memoir when it comes out.  He always has cameras on him so I wonder if he‚Äôs doing a ‚ÄúThe Last Dance‚Äù kind of thing on his career.  Imagine a tell all series for each year of his NBA career, with video proof. All the times he‚Äôs had to put Kyrie in time out then go and make him feel better so he doesn‚Äôt lose his confidence and stops playing with his teammates.   A documentary like that would settle the GOAT debate between him and Jordan when his career is done."
"You mean when Harden averaged 35 ppg against the Warriors with KD and took them further than Lebron ever did?  The 2nd and 3rd best players teamed up to beat Lebron and James Harden + CP3 gave them the most challenge.  Easy for Durant to do well when he has steph and klay to pass to.  I don‚Äôt think Durant is worse than Harden but in no world is he way better than someone with the same MVPs, three times second place voting, 3x scoring champion 1x assist leader."
"I'm okay with this disagreement. LeBron James is the single best player of any of the big three formations that you mentioned, so you do have a valid argument. The Nets could potentially have a third option that would be a #1 on most other teams. I can't say that about Bosh or the Warriors team (I love that team too). It'll be real interesting to watch the Nets if Kyrie decides to buy in and they don't implode."
They couldn‚Äôt win with lebron james they weren‚Äôt winning without him. It‚Äôs an absurd argument. Wade and Bosh is a good 1-2 and then they literally have no other good players. That team was ridiculously top heavy.
"Love basketball but this is ridiculous.  NFL is too far to one side but the NBA is a bit too far to the other side. Media and James desperately want a strong team in New York.....and here it is.  I think what's tough is that there's no reward for making smart decisions. Just be a city that players want to go to and that can turn you into a contender.   LeBron created a lot of ill will but he busted his ass for Cleveland the first time around. Harden.....never got the sense he did everything he could to win and is going to get rewarded for being a quitter. Showing up out of shape, enjoying Frenchies and Breakfast Klub food, partying with strippers and IG heauxs....Le Sigh."
"&gt; This is most blatant in the NFL when #1 drafts consistently get dropped into the worst team in the league (it being the worst team for a reason), then cannot develop and then get railroaded out of the league.  I think that's more that those guys just suck. NFL #1 picks are more likely to become all-stars than NBA #1 picks.   NFL #1 pick all-stars since 2000:   - All-stars (15): Kyler Murray, Myles Garrett, Jared Goff, Jameis Winston, Jadaveon Clowney, Eric Fisher, Andrew Luck, Cam Newton, Matt Stafford, Jake Long, Mario Williams, Alex Smith, Eli Manning, Carson Palmer, Mike Vick  - Non-all-stars (6): Joe Burrow, Baker Mayfield, Sam Bradford, Jamarcus Russell, David Carr, Courtney Brown  NBA #1 overall picks since 2000:   - All-stars (12): Ben Simmons, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, Lebron James, Yao Ming, Kenyon Martin  - Non-all-stars (9): Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, Deandre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Kwame Brown  Zion seems like a pretty sure bet to become an all-star in the future, but I could say the same for Burrow.   &gt; That's why the best NFL quarterbacks nowadays are mid-round picks and late round picks  Only 2 of them: Wilson and Brady. 4 if you wanna include ""good not great"" QBs like Kirk Cousins and Dak Prescott.   Meanwhile the 1st round QBs include: Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers, Deshaun Watson, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Phillip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Matt Ryan, Ryan Tannehill, Justin Herbert. That's already 10, not including any who were listed above as #1 overall picks.   Then you also have Drew Brees and Derek Carr as early 2nd rounders (ie, not midround picks)."
"Exactly, the Heatles big 3 were all 2 way players. They also happened to have fucking LeBron James in his PRIME. All three also fit together much better. All 3 could play on and, more importantly, off ball very well. There's not comparison."
"Absolutely. Especially since all 3 (kyrie, harden, KD) cry about it passive-aggressively if they dont get their way. Hard examples  1. Kyrie with Lebron cries hes not alpha and wants to leave and lead his own team. goes to new team and doesnt lead and cries more if it doesnt go his way. Definition of Beta. Did that with Boston doing it now in Brooklyn 2. KD in his last year with GSW starts to complains how he feels like hes not the first option, feels like he should have the ball in his hands more. To a certain degree valid.. but passively agressively dropping hints about it on twitter/social media without talking it through with teammates. Not right not a leader. Draymond green was the one that pointed this out after he left. He's a prolific score no doubt.. but its not like steph is not the greatest shooter of all time and not a 2 time mvp. or Klay is not a HoF caliber shooter (sarcasm just incase yall dont see it). The right steps towards good communication with that much firepower ... couldve evolved that squad if it weren't for injuries. 3. James harden really tried sticking with the rockets man. BUT, again recently passively aggressively saying its not working, ignoring Covid protocol, not showing up for camp while being seen partying and in clubs? Not a leader. its also an issue when 2 HoF point guards complain about the same thing. lack of defense and no interest in helping the offense off ball. not even spacing wise.  KD and Harden are HoF no doubt, but KD's ignorance about saying he didnt take the easy way with Golden state makes no sense. His thunder were up 3-1 against them right before he went to GSW.  TLDR: yes and it should. Still the strongest offensively talented trio the game has ever seen put together. It will be fun to watch them implode. If they make it work though... Lord almighty."
"He got how many series wins vs teams with 3 hofs?  https://ca.nba.com/news/the-last-dance-did-michael-jordan-or-lebron-james-face-tougher-competition-in-the-playoffs/ub0a1xhfjsff1kuizb90rbd7y  Only 2 of Jordan's final opponents rank in the top 11, when including lebrons...2/11.... the bottom four are all jordan"
Lebron James is the MVP frontrunner.
But then why add Irving after KAI. It would be like Lebron going on a zoom meeting with the name ‚ÄúLBJ James‚Äù
LeBron James. Because why not. It would be funny.
"Lebron James' 5th finger, Lebron James' 6th finger and Lebron James' 7th finger. Easily the most underrated stars of the generation"
Its the LeBron James way. Maybe his first stint with the Cavs jaded him hard.
"Kyrie blows up multiple times because he was angry about being second to LeBron James, only to blow up at the Celtics after getting his own team, to then teaming up with KD and Harden, becoming the third best player..."
Lebron only met James Harden once in 2012
"On one hand, yes, players should dunk less to preserve their ligaments.  On the other hand, LeBron James."
"Didn‚Äôt imply you were saying anything, I was just making a joke? I don‚Äôt need someone to explain to me that LeBron James is very good basketball."
Great minds...  https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2021-02-08/lakers-lebron-james-age-stats-oldest-mvp
WTH you're comparing lebron james defense to jordan although i do think mj is overrated but this is direspecful like bro way to far mj has dpoy something lbj never had and never will have more defencive selections and more defensive first team selections than mj. Mj led the league in steals ounce
"So here‚Äôs what the Lakers fans did and it worked out pretty well for us: Stage a protest in front of the arena and try out the following speech...  First thing‚Äôs first; fire everyone. Second thing; get all the best players back. Third time; we uh, get like uh, cool, kinda like, rec center? For them to all hang out in and I can hang out with the players.   Badabing badaboom, Lebron James and Anthony Davis take you to the promise land"
"AD had nothing to do with recruiting/scouting THT, he barely even knew who he was. It was LeBron who told Rich Paul.  [Anthony Davis Didn‚Äôt Know About Talen Horton-Tucker](https://lakersnation.com/lakers-news-anthony-davis-didnt-know-about-talen-horton-tucker-draft/2021/01/14/)  &gt;Though not for James, who alerted agent Rich Paul after watching Horton-Tucker in high school. Paul has gone on to represent the youngster as well.  &gt;Davis, on the other hand, had barely heard of Horton-Tucker, despite also being from Chicago. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really follow that much basketball, to be honest, so I heard of him but I didn‚Äôt really pay attention or anything like that,‚Äù Davis revealed.  &gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôm from Chicago, so I hear about a lot of the kids coming out of Chicago, a lot of names. But I never really watched him play. When the Lakers drafted him and he signed with Klutch, Rich and some other people told me about him, so then I went back and watched highlights and stuff like that. I was like, ‚ÄòOh, we got a steal.‚Äô"
LeBron James 1 to 1
"After 1980:  All around player, 2013 LeBron James.  As a scorer 2005 Kobe, 1993 Jordan.  Athletic peak, 2009 LeBron and it's not close.  Shooter, 2016 Curry and it's not close."
Era so weak the Lakers could only come up with 5 to the Celtics 13. Also the weak era doesn‚Äôt hold water because although there were less teams the talent was more concentrated per teams. Also wild how you call it a weak era with how many head to heads the Celtics and Lakers had in the big games.  Also what the fuck kinda shit did you link me like I‚Äôm out here rooting for the business entities and not the actual team. And by your logic the LA Lakers are actually second banana to the LA Clippers in rings. The reason I say the thing about location is does LeBron James sign with your team if you‚Äôre not in LA? I rest my case. y‚Äôall did catch up with a 30 year handicap from your opponent congrats. And you‚Äôre talking like the assets the Celtics used are done and ready to retire when really their rookie contracts just ended. That‚Äôs like judging the Super Bowl winner by the first quarter. You have a nice day friend.
"&gt;I was answering the question of why I was using age as a factor instead of seasons.  Again. That has nothing to do with LeBron and his decision to stay or leave. Which is what you are talking about. You're argument is LeBron should view himself not as a player and individual but from a gm's perspective as a commodity? That's illogical arbitrary bullshit.   &gt;I was arguing that James would've been a good spokesperson to recruit stars to Cleveland.   You don't think he did that? He recruited Amare and the Cavs front office refused to go after him. You're literally and arbitrarily blaming him for not doing things he did.   &gt;but I personally don't think Lebron's hands were tied. You clearly do, all the power to you, but it's still debatable.  Yeah cause I've watched this team since 1987  &gt;At the end of the day if you enjoy superteams again all the power to you. But for some, the implementation of superteams has lessen the enjoyment of basketball.  The superteam has been a thing as long as I've been watching basketball. You're just being selective about who you choose to blame for it."
"&gt; But what does that have to do with LeBron's mindset that you're trying to make a judgement about?  I was answering the question of why I was using age as a factor instead of seasons.  &gt; I'm not sure why you're trying to move goal posts now talking about a GM's perspective when that was never the discussion.  What I said was that LeBron was still in a better place than Allen and KG were before they joined the Celtics. I never said that Antwan Jamison, 37-Shaq were the big-3, but it was still better than the Sonics and the Timberwolves. I was arguing that James would've been a good spokesperson to recruit stars to Cleveland. We'd still be in the situation of discussing superteams, but I personally don't think Lebron's hands were tied. You clearly do, all the power to you, but it's still debatable.  At the end of the day if you enjoy superteams again all the power to you. But for some, the implementation of superteams has lessen the enjoyment of basketball."
"I agree that because lebron has been able to adapt his game we haven't seen much of a decline offensively. However I definitely think we have seen a decline on the defensive end.  I think his IQ allows him to still be a good off ball/help defender, and he can occasionally still show signs of greatness but over 48 min I think he's an average defender.   For example, in the finals against the heat, Jimmy was going at him over and over and LeBron couldn't stop him. They had to to have AD who's a C/Pf  on him for the final games.   Again, I'm not saving lebron is a trash defender, he's no james harden, but at one point he was elite and he's not anymore."
Reggie Miller played against LeBron James AND Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
&gt;If you're trying to sign someone would you sign a 25 year old James or a 33 year old Robinson even though they both played 7 seasons?  But what does that have to do with LeBron's mindset that you're trying to make a judgement about?   &gt;but I think players like those three are looked more fondly than people who leave at the first sign of trouble.  Eight seasons of never missing the playoffs is hardly the same situation that LeBron was in. LeBron took a lot of physicality for seven seasons just to watch the cavs assemble shitty roster after shitty roster.   I'm not sure why you're trying to move goal posts now talking about a GM's perspective when that was never the discussion.   Just arbitrary bullshit like I said.
"&gt; but the statement ""LeBron James has a higher chance of reaching an NBA finals than Shaq has of converting a free throw"" is clearly incorrect.  No, not ""clearly"", because there are multiple ways to interpret it. That could with equal validity mean ""a specific free throw"" or ""any free throw / some free throw at some point"".  If you're gonna try and force it to mean any, there's no reason to restrict it to a single season either for that matter."
There's also that one guy Lebron James
"A BIG three It's made up of three stars. You know, like Boston's big three of Garnett, Pierce and Ray, or the Heat with Lebron, James and Bosh. Laker fans were insisting he was going to be the third star for them, not the third option."
"The logical fallacy comes from assuming the two populations are the same or comparable. The statement ""Lebron's chances of making it to the finals in any given season is higher than Shaq's chances of converting a single free throw"" is true but the statement ""LeBron James has a higher chance of reaching an NBA finals than Shaq has of converting a free throw"" is clearly incorrect.   If you make the populations comparable it's easy to see why the second statement is incorrect. Shaq has converted a free throw in every season he's been in the league (100%) while Lebron has reached the finals in less than 60% of his seasons."
"This is LeBron James, not Saben Lee. He's probably the 3rd most popular NBA guy next to MJ and Kobe and is in argument for most influential. One of the biggest argument against LBJ GOAT status was his lack of rings so if he gets 10 rings while having 50 PPG in this era, he's definitely a GOAT to probably a majority of fans.   being an NBA icon does not mean that they are the GOAT lol"
"Could it be...  He was drafted by the Lakers, traded to the Heat and cut during final roster cuts and forced to play in Europe for a couple years.   Bev is kinda super villain level grudge guy. So maybe could see Beverly hating the Lakers for trading him. And I could see him blaming Dwayne Wade for being involved in his cut in Miami -- and by proxy he probably chooses to hate everything that DWade loves most in life, which one of those things, LBJ, swoops into Miami the very next year and proceeds to win multiple championships, while Beverly is over in Europe having to prove himself to the NBA gatekeepers.  Knowing Bev, he probably feels like he should have been a key part of those championship teams and feels slighted by the NBA royalty, including the Lakers, the Heat, DWade, Lebron James et al.  I don't know -- I'm just shit stirring here."
"Stockton is closer to 16K.

"Well yeah he's not Jordan, because he's LeBron James, and a better basketball player."
pat and lou for LeBron James and a 1st?
"Can you tell me which year lebron deserved MVP? 2014 he didnt, 2015, 2016, 2017, he didnt. 2018 you can argue but James led the rockets to the best in the lead record wise so he deserved it. 2020 he had another argument but Giannis put up great stats along with having the best record in the game. I get it hes the best player in the league but I can never understand ""lebron should have won it every year"" when he really shouldnt have even though there were arguments for 2 of them (2018 and 2020). Its not about stats its about impact and literally every year I mentioned the MVP's those years had a bigger impact arguably than lebron in those regular seasons."
Yeah. I‚Äôm confident in the Cs. Also all star wing backcourt pairing in their prime is rare. The last one was Jordan and Pippen so I can see the Jays being that lite. Yeah the Celtics had a 30 year drought and y‚Äôall are just catching up to them in chips (if you count the Minnesota ones) congratulations. And yeah you should win a chip when you sign the best player in the game due to your location and then have a generational talent force his way there. The Lakers did nothing to get that ring except be in LA. You‚Äôre projecting because I am not mad that the Celtics with a player still in his rookie contract as their best player couldn‚Äôt win a ring before LeBron James and Anthony Davis at 35 and 26.  Russell Kareem and Jordan. Could also make cases for Bird and Magic but I moved LeBron up for last year.   I don‚Äôt know but I have faith. I responded to the other dude calling the Celtics mediocre. Y‚Äôall are having your run rn and we had our run earlier. That‚Äôs the game of Basketball.  But if you‚Äôre asking me to project out the next 20 years I like the Celtics chances better than the Lakers.
"&gt; Who was more valuable to their respective teams?      Duncan without a doubt.      People don't know this shit but when Popovich stepped down to coach, he was under immense pressure and if he didn't get an NBA-ready superstar so fast in Tim Duncan, he'd probably be out of the league. Duncan's leadership style was the enabler of the Spurs culture to grow.      Duncan was in a situation like LeBron James in his first Cleveland stint from 2000-01 to 2003-04. A coach with his only plan to dump the ball on his superstar so the superstar would create something.      &gt; Whose career is better (ofc Steph as of now vs Retired Duncan)?      Duncan's career is better. It's not close enough. Duncan has quality over Curry, and quantity gap is massive. Stephen Curry has 6 All-NBA team selections and Tim Duncan has 10 All-NBA 1st team selections. Duncan's 1st team selections almost doubles Curry's entire team selections.      &gt; Better prime?      Duncan.   Here's some info for you about how Duncan didn't care about his stats and when it became tough for his team, he stepped up big time.      &gt; Tim Duncan in his prime (1998-99 to 2006-07) was   21.9 ppg 11.9 rpg 3.2 apg 0.8 spg 2.5 bpg on .551 ts in regular seasons (+2.7 rts)   21.0 ppg 11.6 rpg 4.0 apg 0.5 spg 2.8 bpg on .556 ts in 38 playoffs 1st rounds games   25.3 ppg 13.3 rpg 3.5 apg 0.7 spg 2.7 bpg on .562 ts in 91 playoffs games past 1st rounds   In that time frame, Duncan played   5 playoff series against prime O'Neal and outscored Shaq in 3 of 'em, 3-2.   4 playoff series against prime Bryant and outscored Kobe in 1 of 'em, 1-3. (1999 is the difference between Kobe and Shaq)   3 playoff series against prime Nowitzki and outscored Dirk in 3 of 'em, 3-0.   These players are known for their scoring and scoring based offensive impacts. And Duncan elevated his offensive production to their level in those series while maintaining his defensive impact. Also his efficiency got better even though he played more minutes in tougher series.      Duncan was basically a 25/13/4/3 player (on a 93.7 ppg team) in a sheep's cloth with 22/12/3/3.      &gt; Steph‚Äôs offense valued better than Duncan‚Äôs defense?      Curry's offense vs. Duncan's defense? Curry's offense is the bigger outlier but in terms of outliers, offense tends to be the bigger outlier in the playoff basketball. What I mean is that; +8 rORtg, -8 rDRtg, both are outliers but having +8 rORtg is more common. So, those two are on the same foot and Duncan's longevity is better than Curry's in current state.   So, again, it's Duncan.      ---      It's no wonder there are many people taking 2015-16 regular season Curry as the peak of the 2 players but they fail to understand that wow factor and the peak are not necessarily the same thing. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar peaked higher than Kobe Bryant but Bryant's game had more wow factor.   Curry as 'wow'-ful as he was, didn't peak as high as Duncan."
"*360 windmill dunk on the fast break by LeBron James*  ‚ÄúNow wait, you have to remember that the thing with this guy, he‚Äôs always been able to do that at this level and you can‚Äôt let him do that and get himself going.‚Äù"
"Track and field is a brutal sport to compete in. Just qualifying for the Olympic Trials for the US in that even means you were probably, what, one of the 300 best hurdlers in the whole fucking world at the time? The 300th best basketball/football/baseball/hockey player in the world is playing professionally in the top league in the world. Maybe you weren't the Lebron James of the hurdles; you were more like a bench player -- still good enough to bust the ass of over 99% of people who play basketball."
Michael Jordan has a bigger chance of winning the any NBA Finals the he plays than Lebron James winning a NBA Game.
"I'm a Lebron stan to my very core, but the following statement needs to die a quick death.   &gt; Like everyone has said 100 times, realistically Lebron James based solely on impact could've been MVP almost every year since the late 2000's. People get tired of how great he is and chase narratives for the award instead.  Regular season MVP almost always goes to the most impactful player on a top seeded team, albeit \~2 exceptions in the last 30ish years. Countless posts have determined this to be the case. Every rate stat suggests that Lebron reduced the intensity of his regular season minutes starting in his 4th season with Miami."
&gt;  Lebron James + Carlos Boozer from Cavs  That's completely unreasonable lmao
"Relatively important but with context added that MVP's are narrative dependent.  Like everyone has said 100 times, realistically Lebron James based solely on impact could've been MVP almost every year since the late 2000's. People get tired of how great he is and chase narratives for the award instead.  They can't be the be all end all. Nash isn't a better Point Guard than Chris Paul because he had 2 and Paul had none. There are a lot of other things that play into it. As a baseline thing having them definitely helps but it doesn't thwart a mound of evidence in another direction."
LeBron James.
Raja Bell + Andrei Kirilenko from Utah / Lebron James + Carlos Boozer from Cavs
Tom brady is more likely to win a super bowl than lebron james is to make a free throw
Put prime KG next to lebron fucking James and he would unquestionably be the second best player. He's on such a different level than Davis
"Tom Brady came into a good team and made them Champions.  This is like LeBron James going to the Blazzers, as presently constructed, without Lillard, and winning a Championship."
"Julius Randle's son, Lebron James in his 38th prime and Bargnani's reincarnation will bring the chip home."
Another snipe to Gronk. Another TD  I'm getting New England flashbacks. Is Tom Brady Lebron James
I see LeBron James‚Äô team didn‚Äôt make it to the Super Bowl this year. Just another reason Jordan &gt; Lebron
"the biggest story in the NBA right now, for a couple days at this point, is that some random person said ""fuck you"" to LeBron James. ask yourself why you care"
"Talkin' 'bout LeBron ""China"" James?"
"It was open season after The Decision. To quote renowned Lebron hater, Woj:  &gt; When it mattered most, LeBron James failed, and that turned out to be the sweetest symphony at Staples Center. That‚Äôs his burden until he owns a championship, because there‚Äôs only vindication in the ultimate victory. James missed his free throws, missed five of his six shots in the fourth quarter and overtime. &gt;Judgment comes in June, not January, but these fourth-quarter failures hang over James like no one else in the NBA. &gt;The mocking, the taunts, came cascading down in the Staples Center on Wednesday night, and this unrelenting saga turns a two-time MVP into a punch line. Twenty-four hours earlier, James refused to shoot in a loss to the Golden State Warriors, and now it was something else against the Los Angeles Clippers. With him, it‚Äôs always something else."
Why shouldn't the Lakers trade LeBron James for a younger pieces?
"Well, his idol is Lebron James, biggest crybaby on the court."
Proving once again who the real GOAT is :)  * Michael Jordan: 1072 Games. #33 Career TOV: 2924 (2.7 per) * LeBron James:   1292 Games. #1 Career TOV: 4526 (3.5 per)
"Except for LeBron having a higher career defensive efficiency, more all defensive teams, being robbed of a DPOTY, more steals, more blocks and more defensive rebounds.   LeBron James they both average 27 ppg but LeBron is more efficient, is a far superior playmaker, has a higher BBIQ, rebounds more. More all NBAS and first team NBAs.   Lmao. Durants not and has never been better than LeBron. You have zero data to support your point. Durants never been asked to nor can he carry a bad team. He's under achieved on great  teams and will likely do the same in Brooklyn despite having another MVP and Kyrie.   ""Better on offense and defense lmao"" in what world?"
"jesus christ why do laker fans think that because they chose to root for lebron james they are better people than other fans? some laker fans are respectful and smart but some of you are just pathetic. you don‚Äôt know me, my iq, my career, or even who i am. i promise you that this flop is embarrassing and i‚Äôm curious why you think the nba warned lebron and kuzma about it if you don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre wrong here. seriously, please explain that."
Lebron James
[Right here](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30895017/los-angeles-lakers-lebron-james-kyle-kuzma-warned-nba-violating-anti-flopping-rule)
&gt;I‚Äôve seen less contact receive foul calls from an exaggerated reaction.  In the same game.  From Lebron James.
I‚Äôm not insinuating anything. I‚Äôm just telling you that AD being injured is a dumb excuse considering the Lakers played bad teams and you have LeBron James on your roster.
"Yeah I don't think missing AD is a good excuse. We still have Lebron James and a great supporting cast. Truth is our team is and has been a bit complacent, and that's fine because our record is still fantastic, and what matters is how we play in April/May/June."
"&gt;Everyone, meet your 9-time MVPs Michael Jordan and LeBron James  Any #3 and 4 in career VORP right behind them? Stockton and Malone."
The only winner in that situation is Lebron James
Example: LeBron James
"They're already doing VR on the courts for the ads.  I would attach a sponsor and say something like KIA FLOPPER OF THE WEEK, LEBRON JAMES for one entire game for whoever flops and gets a fine/warning.  The league can also make revenue that way."
I'm not actually opposed to a policy like that but the last thing the league wants is to start ejecting guys like LeBron James.   Viewership would plummet.    Unfortunately leagues walk a tight rope of enforcing the rules and keeping the players fans want to see in the games.
Lebron James has been found guilty of flopping. The punishment is death. Execution is set for noon tomorrow.
"Did JVG and Mark Jackson die? Mark Breen was trying to start a conversation about Jimmy Butler and Lebron James, and there was no one else joining him in the discussion."
yeah that happens when you're not the number 1 because you're teammates with lebron fucking james lmao. but he was a championship #2 whereas dame is a second round #1. i'll take the former.
"There is no objective statistical argument for Lebron James at the top spot. He has slightly worse stats overall, won 50% fewer championships, one mvp less than MJ and is just a much worse overall defensive player. Plus he has some massive chokes in important game, so there isn‚Äôt even a clutch argument. I would like to hear your objective reason for thinking he is number 1?"
"It's why I cant stand soccer, all the flopping and whining. LeBron James is a beast but also might be the largest living vagina with legs. He'll get hit and act like he's been shot with a gun then acts like he's in pain but ""pushing through"" because that's how dedicated he is to the game of basketball. He tries so hard to be a brand, a commodity, however you want to look at it. Jordan was himself and never had to put on the facade LeBron does."
&gt; But the man does not flop.   LeBron James has flopped so many times in his career they interviewed his flopping teacher: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hofst6YUktQ  Shorter version:https://streamable.com/zawj7a
"What a scrub, not even as good as Lebron James"
"Starters  G: Stephen Curry  G: Damian Lillard  F: Kawhi Leonard  F: Lebron James  F: Nikola Jokic  Reserves  G: Luka Doncic  G: Donovan Mitchell  F: Anthony Davis   F: Paul George  F: Rudy Gobert  WC: Devin Booker  WC: CP3  These are just my predictions, not who I necessarily *think* should make it. For example, De‚Äôaaron Fox absolutely deserves a spot imo, but I think he‚Äôll get the Booker treatment from years past where his team just isn‚Äôt good enough to get picked over guards on playoff teams."
"**Starters**.      - G: Stephen Curry - G: Damian Lillard - F: Kawhi Leonard - F: Lebron James - F: Nikola Jokic    **Reserves**.     - G: Luka Doncic - G: Donovan Mitchell - F: Anthony Davis.   - F: Paul George.   - F: Rudy Gobert.   - WC: Devin Booker.   - WC: Chris Paul.      ----      SGA, Fox and Zion could all make the team over CP3 and I wouldn't complain but I think the winning record for Phoenix deserves to be recognised and both CP3 and Booker have been playing at an All-Star level."
"The point was, that the hard part is winning them, and speculating a guy that has never been close to winning anything, will win as many MVP‚Äôs as Lebron James is kind of reaching."
Draymond is receiving passes from Lebron James it‚Äôs hard to help on him without leaving draymond open
Michael Jordan against the Cavs: 4-0  LeBron James against the Bulls: 4-0  I see a pattern here.
and people wonder why a ton of people loathe lebron james' basketball
"[Everyone, meet your 9-time MVPs Michael Jordan and LeBron James](https://imgur.com/a/eYKhWw2)"
"&gt; You gotta love the moving the goalposts. Harden can't play defence and chokes in big playoff games? He makes a big defensive play in a game 7 and people start to add the qualifiers......  Literally never said he couldn't play defense. HAren is one of the best pound for pound post defenders in NBA history.  &gt;He choked in '15 and '17, undeniable. He didn't choke in '19 and '20.  Doesn't even make sense. If you don't think him playing bad in the most important games in a playoff run counts as choking why are you saying he choked in 15 and 17? He did the same shit.   &gt;He has. You just don't want to see or acknowledge it.  Moved on from going 2-11 in 2015 and 2-11 in 2017 all the way to 2-11 in 2020. So much progress. Maybe he should get Most Improved Player of the Year votes?   &gt;It's not like he's losing to dumb and dumber. These are great teams he's losing to. The stacked Warriors. LeBron and AD.  He played those guys in lower stakes games and balled out. He consistently plays worse in the biggest games. I'm not asking him to win, I'm asking him to play like James Harden.  &gt;And that cost them more than Russ being absolutely pathetic? Or the Rockets going ultra small and finally being stretched to the limit? 29 on 66% TS.....he was the least of Houston's problems.  LMAO I love the Russ slander so much. Russ was injured and recovering from COVID. Russ has a better playoff resume than Harden, but no one wants to admit it. Russ has faults but that guy will die with you in the trenches. Harden aint about it. Biggest games Russ pushes too hard. Biggest games HArden disappears. Also Russ was the best player on the rockets in Jan-March 2020.   &gt;And if you're not LeBron, KD, Curry or Kawhi your playoff resume doesn't match Harden's.  lmao CP3&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Harden Playoff Resume. That's the player you should be going ""look man he ran into some crazy teams"" not Harden who doesn't get off the bus for important playoff games. But sure I guess crackheads keep crackin. Carmelo&gt;Harden playoff resume too. Same with Kyrie and Iggy."
"It's true. But it's also well-known big FAs avoided the Knicks for their toxic atmosphere, and James Dolan. I believe even KD said so. LeBron didn't even sit down with them for a meeting."
"Miami won that series and that's all Butler cares about.  He's capable of putting the team on the back when necessary but he's fine letting others exploit match ups and focusing on intangibles.  He just wants to win.  This year Butler's been dealing with a bum ankle and a case of COVID-19.  He's just now getting back into form.  The way Miami plays with and without him shows how important he is to the team.  Obviously Tatum has a bright future, but he hasn't proven he can drag his team to the Finals or go toe-to-toe with LeBron James, while Butler has.  I'm going with the savvy veteran who has performed at the highest level."
"The way the docu described it was the very basic free throw mechanics that were taught to players by coaches since the early basketball days, were made with guards in mind, and feature a full range of motion starting below the hip and ending over the head. But when you get guys that are 6'10 and 7 foot and teach them that same mechanic, it's gonna have way different results because of the extended proportions of their bodies. Add in the strength of these big players like, dwight howard, shaq, wilt, deandre jordan, andre drummond, lebron james, Hakeem, etc. Etc. Etc. And those free throw mechanics that work for smaller guys are just not gonna work for them.   There's a reason these these dudes can't hit free throws at a high clip besides nerves. I mean think of Tim Duncan, ""the big fundamentals"" but he shot 63% from the line."
They'd battle each other to the death for LeBron James supremacy. Whoever survives is the new LeBron James and takes his place in life.
lebron james would win a chip every year
Let me turn this back around on you for a sec.    What do you think would happen if *every* NBA player legally changed his name to LeBron James?
"Nothing, there'd just be 2 LeBron James in the league, the good one, and the other guy."
"Stats are free on the internet, you should take advantage so you don‚Äôt look silly. Steph this season: 66% true shooting. James Harden‚Äôs best full season as a 20ppg scorer: 62.6% true shooting. That‚Äôs basically the difference between Lebron and a league-average scorer."
"I mean yes, if the Lakers get the best or second best record in the NBA and Jokic/Curry wins MVP that would be bullshit in my opinion. In 2018, Harden had CP3 and a good team. Cavs got the 4 seed, not that great, but the only reason they were in the playoffs with home court advantage was because of Lebron James. He played every game and carried them with great stats. He didn‚Äôt win because the Rockets were the best team in the NBA and the best player on that team was James Harden ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"the only thing that actually hurts teams and players is suspensions, and they aint suspending lebron motherfucking james."
I have which is why I was able to correctly state he is no Lebron James. You should watch some old school Lebron James. The only skill Luka is better than Lebron is flopping ability.
"We're not talking level, just style and skill set:  Luka Doncic = LeBron James + James Harden"
Miye Oni for LeBron James
I mean its Grayson Allen standing there and Lebron James dunking. He does that shit in his sleep. Whats the deal with this?
"&gt;	I‚Äôm not sure which media you‚Äôre watching, but the media absolutely loves LeBron. Honestly seems like you‚Äôre seeing what you want to see.  The irony of this comment is actually pretty hilarious.   Skip, Stephen A, Ric Boucher, Rob Parker, Chris Broussard etc are all super critical of LeBron. That doesn‚Äôt even cover all of them. Combine that with all the fans who‚Äôs daily goal is to hate on LeBron. He got shitted on for sitting at the end of the bench for a game lmao and then Phil jackson had something to say about him as well. Former players are always unreasonably critical of him as well.   Even [Gobert](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2929639-rudy-gobert-lebron-james-is-the-most-criticized-player-of-our-generation.amp.html) chimed in on it. Do you think he is only seeing what he wants to see as well?"
"44% of his points come from free throws in that stretch. His Free Throw rate is down for 69% to 64% on the season so far.  In comparison, James Harden's highest FTR was 59% and been below 50% since his MVP season  Giannis has a FTR of 55% season  Peak LeBron was 51% in 2010 (but was 64% in the 2009 playoffs where he averaged 14 FTA/g)  Trae Young this season has a FTR of 57%   Jordan was 43% the season he averaged 37ppg and shot 12 FTA/g  Butler has to be regarded as one of the people ruining the game with their flopping and drawing fouls at that rate right?"
IF THATS TRUE that would mean there are 12 players averaging more points than Lebron James this year ü§Ø
yeah I stopped reading at the LeBron James tomb
"They went way too experimental with small ball. PJ Tucker as Center?! At least Durant or Draymond have length to be center-esque in their play.  Like they should have known any competent team with even one big man could have made their playoff run a disaster. And they were in the Western conference with a Lakers team consisting of Lebron James, who had Austin Rivers on him at one point, Dwight Howard, who is still a relatively flexible big man, Anthony Davis, a younger dominant big man, and Kostas Atetokounmpo  on the Bench, who‚Äôs not his brother, but in a pinch has a serviceable game.  Like skill is good. But skill and height is REALLY good."
&gt;melts down  Lmao this sub does not ‚Äúmelt down‚Äù when LeBron James shoots free throws
"even tho westbrick is great at turning the ball over I think he will retire before LeBron, I think Trey and Luka have better chances at beating James before their career are over."
‚ÄúNext up on Undisputed: ‚ÄúIs Lebron James the worst player in the NBA?‚Äù Skip Bayless discusses next.‚Äù
"You gotta consider the 3 years of collage impact. Although obviously not the  exact same as playing in the NBA, this makes it far more likely his first year is going to better than someone‚Äôs like LeBron James who was literally right out of high school at 18. This would be the equivalent to LeBron‚Äôs 4th year in the league. Luka with his Euro-league is a bit different but the age difference is still a huge factor."

And even after that stat he's still the 3rd best in nba history. 1)Michael Jordan 2)Wilt Chamberlian 3)Lebron James

As if someone like LeBron James doesn't have dedicated trainers and performance coaches that know exactly what they're doing"
How do you lose sight of LeBron fucking James?
"You're asking me to imagine a hypothetical scenario in which Lebron James obtains the athleticism of his 28 year old body, and then you are asking me to imagine another hypothetical scenario within that alternate universe where people are still proclaiming MJ to be the goat? For what though?"
Lebron James. He doesnt age.
"Lebron James played 13 years in the nba before Deandre Jordan made an all star game. Lebron was drafted in 2003, DJs first all star game was 2017"

The rich Jefferson lebron James friendship is one of the funniest thing to see lmaoo
At this pace Bron is going to break Wilt‚Äôs single season record of most games played with 90+pts &amp; 30+reb‚Ä¶and he‚Äôs still 2 months from his 30th birthday.  Or they should just name the whole damn thing The LeBron James 3rd Quarter of the Year.
#LEBRON JAMES
God forbid a franchise with LeBron James and 17 titles have more fans than a team partly owned by Justin Timberlake

What the actual fuck is LeBron James. Misses a couple of freethrows then does several plays to end the quarter.
"""*Free throws are hard. I'd rather shoot fade aways.*"" - LeBron James"

#LEBRON JAMES
"Not sure, but Zion Williams seems to always get and 1s. LeBron James is also pretty good at it."
"Yall gotta stop normalizing his play like he's Giannis or Lebron James and you expect good numbers, so you hold him to a different standard from everyone else. There's no reason Luka should be this good at 21. Wish more people would just acknowledge what we're seeing is special, instead of meming or arguing about the bad takes other respective people had early in in the season."
"yes, they're playing tanking teams and relying on fumbling plays from inexperienced teams to squeak through wins. But they're still the defending champs with Lebron James on their team, until they get bounced from the playoffs they are still ""favourites until proven otherwise"""
"Are you aware that the Warriors have been playing without a Center for the last few games also? Or how they literally had the most difficult stretch of games at the beginning of the season as well? Steph is second in points per game, on a far less skilled team than both the Nuggets and 76ers, he‚Äôs also very high in TS% while getting almost no free throws per game. The disrespect Curry gets by refs and fans is incredible, I‚Äôm not saying he is going to win the MVP, nor that Embiid and Jokic aren‚Äôt great contenders, if anything those three are far away in level compared to the rest of the league, so LeBron being considered would be tossed up to him having a better standing, which shouldn‚Äôt really matter unless the feat is really impressive, because it‚Äôs been shown that without AD the team was struggling, it could be a coincidence or not, but I don‚Äôt see James being truthfully the best player in the world at all"
I wouldn't be so sure. Giannis could definitely pull it off for example. There will be other great players in the future.   It's an incredible achievement and I think perfectly sums up lebron james as the most well rounded legend amongst the goats
"LeBron ""Stop The Count"" James"
"40k-10k-10k, LeBron James"
We are 1/3 through the season so saying he should win it is really premature. Also if lebron does win it it will be because of politics (narrative) which is what AD is trying to do by saying he should win it 1/3 of the way through the season.  Also 7.9 and 7.9 is far from 10 and 10. He isn't almost averaging a triple double. And in the last 6 games james is only shooting 33% from 3 after his hot start. My guess is he ends the season around 37%-38%
"yes, and all of that doesn't take into account that MASH unit teams he's dragged to those points.  Like, sorry he can't beat LeBron James or the Warriors dynasty I guess?  You can always tell when someone doesn't watch Dame/the Blazers when they buy into either the ""playoff struggles"" or the ""not a great playmaker"" narrative.  He can make all the passes &amp; has elite vision which is extra impressive considering his size.  After the Pelicans series he came back able to split traps and make those double team reads easily, and his drive &amp; kick game now is truly elite.  Not sure what more anyone could ask of him, he is the heart &amp; soul of the Blazers and carries them on a nightly basis"
"LMAOOOOO wow I thought you were just trolling, you deadass think Kevin Durant outplayed LeBron James for half the decade  I ain't finna argue w/ you tho lol, other comments already proving you wrong but you're obv stubborn af"
Lebron James will not go to the grizzlies
"I saw them play. You either didn't or have poor memory.  AI carried an astronomical load of this teams offense, but he was a hole on defense (always gambling). Eric Snow was a good pass first PG who covered AI's ass on defense and would guard the better guard. Mutombo was past his prime, but still a rim protector. Theo Ratliff, George Lynch, Aaron Mckie and Tyronne Hill, those were veterans that young Lebron could only dream of.  &amp;#x200B;  If all you care about is scoring, then AI carried them almost all on his own, but basketball is more than that.  It's the same thing as the harden rockets hustling their asses off on defense and being one of the best teams in that regard and everybody playing their limited role on offense very well and then people are saying it was all James Harden, all on his own.  &amp;#x200B;  That shit is disrespectful. Harden was the most important player on those teams and AI was an incredible leader for this sixers team. **Leader, he didn't carry them, he lead them! (and offense only)**  &amp;#x200B;  Always this Iso-hero-ball-BS, just to dumb the game so far down that even apes understand what you're speaking of, smh."
"Oh yeah I totally understand the criticism of that from an evaluation standpoint. A guy like LeBron James is once every ten years or so. I think the Cade to OKC thing is solely because he from that general area, stayed somewhat close to home at OK St. And his style of play really fits this current mold to the team."
LaMelo currently has the 4th best BPM ever for a teenager.

"So he didn't have 2 all-stars with him.   The Warriors and maybe the Rockets bounce the Cavs sure. But it would take a 60 win type top West team. Indiana was good that year they are basically the Jazz West. Oladipo, Myles Turner, Sabonis, Bogdanovic etc good team all around shooting and defense.  Toronto was a 59 win team they had a better record than the Warriors that year they were excellent. They were the favorites to win the series. They had Valunchunis and Ibaka and Fred Vanvleet.  Boston was better without Kyrie. They had a better record without him playing and they were a better defensive team without him. Boston was led by the all-star/all-defense Al Horford. Tatum balled out his age doesn't mean anything. The Cavs were led by a 34 year old Lebron James.  That Boston team wouldn't get swept by anyone. '19 year old Tatum' beat Giannis and Embid before running into Lebron. Boston had the #2 ranked defense in the entire league."
"I have that All Star Game in mind where it got really compedetive at the end and Team Giannis went for an Embiid post up to win the game. 1vs1 against LeBron. Embiid tried to move James, didn't get far and traveled."
James Harden is better than KD these past few years. Imo a better facilitator and just as good as a scorer.   My list would be   1a. Lebron 1b. Curry 3. Kawhi 4. Harden 5. KD
Hand checking has been reduced over time from 1978 until the complete removal of it in 2004. The real change was the removal of illegal defense.      The reason ISO ruled the land then was because you couldn't play zone and defenders couldn't pre-rotate to double.

The ESPN narrative. This is the season where LeBron James' twilight years are more important than carrying a soon to be dead dynasty.
michael jordan + lebron james + wilt chamberlain = lavar ball
TJ McConnell's IQ + Anthony Randolph's Athleticism + James Jones' longevity + Jabari Parker's offense = Lebron
"Ok, so what about Rockets Harden and OKC Harden made then different players? Could it have been his role in the offense behind Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook? Similar to how Wade was playing behind LeBron James, therefore putting up less volume stats?"
"Yes he‚Äôs a negative on defense, but on a team like the Lakers who are a top 10 defensive team and when he would be covered by LeBron James and Anthony Davis instead of Lonnie Walker and DeMar DeRozan I highly doubt his defense would negate his offensive value at all.    Do I think the Lakers would be better giving lamarcus Aldridge touches in comparison to giving them to Wesley matthews, markieff Morris, Marc gasol etc.? Yes, without a doubt yes.   You can argue he‚Äôs a worse fit for y‚Äôall if you‚Äôre only valuing defense, but he‚Äôs without a doubt a better player than gasol"
" The 12 man team will probably be: Steph curry, Damian lillard, lebron james, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis as the starters.             Kyrie Irving, James harden, Paul George, kawhi Leonard, Zion Williamson/bam adebayo off the bench.             Chris Paul, Bradley Beal Jason Tatum to round out the roster. I don‚Äôt think Chris really belongs here, but I think he‚Äôll make it anyway because of his locker room presence and reputation. Tatum can be swapped out for a lot of players here, but he‚Äôs my pick to make it."
"It's the best because you can hear things like ""Lebron James! With no regard for human life!"""
"I kinda want to see a team of dudes above 30 make a run at the Gold. If that's 12, that would be:  F LeBron James  F Draymond Green  F Jimmy Butler  F Gordon Hayward (he'll be 30 in a few days)  F Kevin Durant   G Chris Paul  G James Harden  G Russell Westbrook  G Stephen Curry  G Mike Conley  C DeAndre Jordan  F/C Blake Griffin  that'd be cool"
"""Mavs allegedly would trade KP for Anthony Davis or Lebron James or both"""
Ray Allen did what he was PAID to do. Is Lebron James the only player not allowed to have teammates?
"Yeah the guy whose team Durant joined, who led his team to 73 wins and a title without Durant, and single-handedly changed the game of basketball.   I‚Äôd say that guy is the player of his generation except that he played at the same time as the GOAT, LeBron James."
"You mean the guy that was considered the 2 times finals mvp. was seen as the better player on the same team and was ranked higher by kerr himself while on the same team is not the better player. Kd has also been elite for way longer and is not a defensive liability.  Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact. ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins."" Kerr was then asked by Lowe if Curry would take offense to being ranked below Durant even though the former's long been the foundation of the Warriors' success, but the crafty head coach had a clever answer. ""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr said. ""That's the beauty of Steph, that he doesn't take that stuff personally. Steph is one of the great players in the world, two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of how he impacts the game."" The argument for Durant over Curry largely comes down to size. Curry is a good defender for his position, but Durant is a 7-footer capable of checking anybody on the court. Durant took turns guarding James, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving in the NBA Finals, while Curry was hidden on less dangerous assignments whenever possible. ""You're talking about Kevin Durant at 6-foot-11 protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do,"" Kerr said. ""There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD. Steph is my size, he's literally exactly my size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill. ""In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league. ""And that's why LeBron is there, that's why Kawhi is there, that's why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force."""

"A lot of people said that about Steph Curry before Steve Kerr coached him.  And a lot of people still say that about Harden.  Heck, people said that about Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal, and LeBron James at one time.  I'm not saying it will happen, it just seems like the closest situation to the Warriors the year before Steve Kerr took over."
"No second team. But I'm a lebron Stan so if orlando isn't doing well, then whoever James is playing for."
"Nice list! I've quoted #40 quite a bit but nobody ever believes me.  Here's one:  51) Larry Bird, LeBron James, and Russel Westbrook are all left handed but play basketball as right hand dominant."
"What if we had gotten the number 1 pick instead of the number 2 in 03? We would‚Äôve gotten Lebron James. Instead it was top 1 protected, and deferred to the Pistons who took Darko"
Because Dame has LeBron James in his generation.
"What if the Grizzlies win the 2003 draft and not get second?   Our pick in 2003 was owed to Detroit, but it was Top 1 protected. We got 2nd and so it went to Detroit.   Had we won, obviously we would have taken Lebron. That would have given us a starting line up of Jason Williams, Mike Miller, Lebron James, Pau Gasol, and Lorenzen Wright. Shane Battier would have been a 6th man/small ball PF.   Could you imagine if the Grizzlies had 18 year old Lebron and 22 year old Pau Gasol to build around? That would have been incredible. The franchise would have become something entirely different. We would have never traded Pau to the Lakers. We would have never seen Grit N Grind.   The Cavs were a must-see team for fans because of Lebron. Imagining that in Memphis would have been incredible."
"I don't rank him on my All-Time list. I'm not Bill Simmons, I don't have a hundred-man, five-level pyramid of basketball greatness. I have a top ten list of players that I shuffle around whenever I get asked the question depending on who I like and who I feel like is getting under- or overrated at that moment.  1. Michael Jordan 2. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 3. LeBron James 4. Bill Russell 5. Magic Johnson 6. Wilt Chamberlain 7. Larry Bird 8. Hakeem Olajuwon 9. Tim Duncan 10. Kobe Bryant  And I only include Russell and Chamberlain because I feel like I *have* to, even though I've only seen highlights and the occasional game from them when they were like 38."
"Jokic has a lower usage percentage than trae. Does that mean that you think Trey is better than Jokic?  As does LeBron, Kyrie, Paul George, James Harden, Jimmy Butler, and Zion Williamson."
No order btw  1. LeBron James 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. Anthony Davis 4. James Harden 5. Kevin Durant 6. Stephen Curry 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Paul  George 9. Damian Lillard 10. Joel Embiid 11. Nikola Jokic 12. Luka Doncic 13. Zion Williamson (yes that's right) 14. Chris Paul 15. Giannis  16. Rudy Gobert 17. Donovan Mitchell 18. Jimmy Butler 19. Jaylen Brown 20. Ben Simmons  maybe a healthy KP top 25
"This sub can be so inconsistent. One guy gets downvoted into oblivion for misusing obscure internet slang, but this person implying that three-point shooting is the one differentiator between Ben Simmons and LeBron James is karma-neutral? What is happening?"
"Uh what? I mean its close but you're just posting nonsense.  Kendrick Perkins birthday = November 10, 1984  Lebron James birthday = December 30, 1984"
Lamelo probably won't He might turn into a Chris Paul He won't end up being lebron James good
"Due to your flair i assume you won't agree with it, but 2015-2018 were really close to being as bad. D-Rose and PG's injuries robbed the East of two promising young superstars in those years and outside of LeBron James led teams, the rest of the East had no shot.  But yeah, the East was a mess after MJ retired, the West won five straight titles and never needed a Game 7 for it. Lakers and Spurs were killing themselves in the WCF while the 49-win Nets was making the Finals. If ever there was an argument for seeding 1 through 16 regardless of Conference, it was in the early 2000s."
" &gt; Lol ok man. You keep adding things that I never said, like ""significant advantage."" I never said he had a significant advantage nor did I offer my opinion as to how many writers and analysts felt that way. If you think it's only three then that's your decision to make as an adult. I'm not going to research it for you especially because my point is anything other than zero is an unfair advantage, no matter how significant. And you seem to already know that the three mentioned are guilty of this.   &gt; Again if you're naive enough, or just don't consume enough NBA media to believe it's just those three you are within your rights to continue believing that. Because it's not my point to argue ""significant advantage."" He had an advantage, it was and remains unfair. That's it.   According to you, others needed to have ‚Äúhistoric seasons‚Äù otherwise Lebron would be MVP ‚Äúby default‚Äù. Would you not consider that a significant advantage? Like, I get that you didn‚Äôt explicitly say ‚Äòsignificant‚Äô, but that absolutely doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs inapplicable, based on the other stuff you said.   What this boils down to is that you don‚Äôt have enough evidence to back up the claim that he had a *meaningful* advantage and you tried to divert your point into being ‚Äúwell even one voter saying that is bad‚Äù. My entire argument was that the ‚Äúadvantage‚Äù was negligible.   And even worse, you‚Äôre playing the ‚Äúnaive‚Äù card in place of providing evidence. That‚Äôs just poor form.     &gt; There was a poll of writers who were asked who their MVP was a few weeks back. LeBron was the overwhelming choice. Despite the Sixers being the one seed in the East and Embiid's numbers (also Jokic's) dwarfing LeBron's. Lakers were number two in the West at the time. If you think he was that overwhelming of a favorite because of his on court play alone I have a bridge I'd like to sell you. Most fans know and knew exactly why he's been such a heavy MVP favorite. Even many Lakers fans will admit it. And why not? It's not some crime against him or some conspiracy for him. It's just bullshit that people are judging this way. That there are those who have their mind made up and have to be dragged kicking and screaming for them to consider changing it. And again, if the only place you've heard LeBron's age, lack of MVPs, dominance in the past playoffs, or dominance over the last few years, cited as reasons that he should win this award is from those three people then congratulations because you probably don't pay as much attention to this stuff than most. And that is probably a good thing tbh.    The Sixers were the 1 seed in the East and would‚Äôve been a middling seed in the West at that time lmao. Overall record apparently doesn‚Äôt matter. Also, the fact that you mention Jokic there is laughable because Denver‚Äôs record was dog shit at the time, by MVP standards Again, numbers alone does not an MVP make.    Lakers had the 2nd best record *in the league* and James was putting up an MVP caliber stat line. Seriously, that‚Äôs it. You seem to not understand how crucial record is in the MVP race. And that‚Äôs not opinion, that‚Äôs a fact based on historical consistency.    I‚Äôve heard plenty of talking heads mention narratives about Lebron. But I‚Äôm not aware of them coming from voters, other than the ones we established. And that‚Äôs the issue here. It doesn‚Äôt matter what guys like Kendrick Perkins or whomever say on TV. The only opinions that matter are those of the voters.   And still, you choose not to provide more of them, instead favoring a ‚Äúwell you just aren‚Äôt paying attention‚Äù approach. It‚Äôs lazy, full stop."
"Maybe Lebron really was recruiting, he was suspiciously close with Curry. They both appreciated each other‚Äôs game, and Lebrons getting older, so is Curry. Lakers should have cap space, maybe they add Curry to Lebron, and AD  Also Curry can retire a warrior, but he probably knows with Klay getting an ACL and Achilles injury his chances to contend are over and james wiseman I think will be good he‚Äôs just young to be a star on a contending team"
The 2nd best basketball player of all time is Michael Jordan. You mean the 3rd best basketball player LeBron James.
Yea but 2018 Rockets were no slouch. The 2020 Rockets the Lakers beat were a joke compared to 2018 Rockets. They had Capela patroling the paint. Then we all know CP3 is much better than an out of prime Westbrook. Harden ofc would eat as always. Gordon was much younger back then and was a great 6th man. But the key is Rockets had Tucker and Ariza who would hound Lebron James. I got Rockets in 7.
"He is the white Harden and the media wants  to portrait him as the next Larry Bird or Lebron James.. I can see the similarities with Lebron, but the most accurate comparision is Harden."
"How many MVPs has Wade won? How many 1st team all NBAs does Wade have? Scoring titles? Harden has been top 2 in MVP 4 times, Wade has made 2 1st teams.   Harden has 3 scoring titles, Wade has 1.   Like, maybe let‚Äôs say the MVP versus the finals MVP is a wash. Harden has still had the longer and better peak.  Also, harden has never played with prime Lebron James. He‚Äôs played with a past his prime Dwight Howard, a past his prime Chris Paul, and past his prime Westbrook, and for a lot of that time he was going up against one of the greatest dynasties ever."
"Giannis was on the best regular season team and was a dominant force on offense and defense, the hell you mean Embiid is more deserving? Embiid and Jokic have the best cases this season. James Harden third, Lillard fourth and Lebron will be 5th."
"Oscar Robertson, Michael Jordan, Lebron James and Russell Westbrook are the only players to ever average 30/7/7 lol  Jayson Tatum is obviously not averaging that"

"No I don‚Äôt believe he should have tweeted that.   To quote James himself: ‚ÄúI think when we all sit back and learn from the situation that happened, understand that what you could tweet or could say (could affect people),‚Äù James said. ‚ÄúWe all talk about this freedom of speech. Yes, we all do have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you‚Äôre not thinking about others, and you‚Äôre only thinking about yourself.  I believe Lebron James wasn‚Äôt educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke, and so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, spiritually.. he should be careful of what he tweets"
"Anyone with half a brain could've predicted LeBron coming out and not giving a definite yes or no on the vaccine would be ungodly controversial.  He doesn't *owe* anyone disclosure on if he's getting it or not, but at this point it's basically Public Relations 101 on if you're fucking LeBron James and the media asks you if you're getting the vaccine, you say yes because literally any other answer will stir up controversy and attention."
"First of all just lol. Got Lakers fans are ridiculous. I‚Äôm not gonna hold my players to the same standards as the literal GOAT/Second best player of all time.  Secondly, never called them a superstar...no one does. They are stars, all stars, but superstars are like the top 7 or so players.  I can‚Äôt get over the fact you just said we should hold Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown to the same playmaking standard as LeBron freaking James lol what"
And? Kawhi was playing lockdown defense on LeBron James.
"Yeah, he should be ASHAMED that he plays at a slighty lower level than fucking LEBRON JAMES in the playoffs"
"Yes, if only we could have a GM who makes daring and courageous decisions like ""sign free agent LeBron James""  If LA had a winter you would be even less successful than the Knicks"
"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass."
And yet the player who almost singlehandedly dictates who makes the NBA Finals from his conference is LeBron James.
‚Äúlower your IQ‚Äù    \- man who thinks Kobe Bryant was a better player than LeBron James
" ""Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid overtook Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James last week and is now the consensus favorite to win the regular-season MVP award at sportsbooks around the nation. Embiid is listed at +200 to win MVP at Caesars Sportsbook by William Hill, followed by James at +225.""    What does it mean to be a consensus favorite? It seems that he is not that at all if James is in a near tie with him."
Lebron James + the Eastern Conference.  Only five of fifteen teams had winning records.
"Dwight made the finals in  09 when he beat LeBron James and a scrap of acorns and Old man Paul Pierce and Ray Allen without Kevin Garnett. I‚Äôm talking 2010s. Cousins was more than stats, he even developed his 3 point shot in NOLA. To everyone saying he was empty stats is tripping. No one slanders KAT for failing to lead MIN to wins without Jimmy Butler, Cousins was showing improvement."
Outrage culture of today? The nba is a big fucking business to the communities and owners. If lebron James had said it it would be dealt with and he‚Äôd be playing. But Meyers Leonard? As an owner I do not want to ask my customers to come pay money to root for a guy who called them a slur.  It‚Äôs got nothing to do with outrage. It‚Äôs just business. He doesn‚Äôt bring in enough money to justify
Kyle Korver has surpassed LeBron James in the betting odds for Most Veteran Player
"**TEAM 1988+ BLAZERS**  The talented Trail Blazers come together to win an elusive title for the franchise after coming close several times since Walton.   During training camp, the team makes an effort to work on their 3 point shooting to adapt to the modern NBA. Terry Porter and Aryvdas Sabonis in particular show that potential, with coaches suspecting they can be 40% shooters in time. But the question hanging over the team's heads? In how much time? TBD.  The Blazers start strong, fueled by veterans with chemistry and skill. Clyde Drexler is the ""face"" of the team early on, averaging 23 points per game and showcasing some elite athleticism for this or any era. He makes the All-Star team, with the Blazers well above .500 at the break.  The Blazers settle in at the 5th seed in the playoffs out West, with advanced stats far better than the current Blazers (5th right now as well.) In fact, many consider them a playoff threat to come out of the conference.  The team matches up with the Phoenix Suns, who have slid down to the 4th seed. It's a rugged, physical battle between these two sides, especially at the PG and C spots. The two battle back and forth, deadlocked at 2-2. Still fearing that their spacing isn't elite by today's standards, they start to utilize young Drazen Petrovic more often to great effect. The Blazers snatch the last 2 wins, and win round one 4-2.  That sets up a showdown between them and the # 1 seeded Utah Jazz, who secured that spot thanks to a hot start. The Jazz's elite defense manages to slow the game down, but the Blazers are well suited for that style of play. Drexler outplays the smaller Mitchell, and the Blazers win 4-1.  With their momentum rising, many consider the team a threat to win the title. However, to get there, they'll have to face off against a familiar foe in the L.A. Lakers. LeBron James turns up the gas against them, hammering his way inside to 37 points and then 28 points the following night to go up 2-0. Blazers fan bristle at the officiating, claiming the fix is in yet again.  The Blazers scrap their way back into the series, down 3-2 headed into Game 6. As the seconds wind down, Clyde Drexler launches a Dame-esque three ball to win it but... it falls short! Blazers go home, disappointed.   Still, the team feels confident they can continue to work on their shooting for next year and break their title slump."

Lebron James
He was for the whole year until lakers went 3-7 in the last 10.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/31038407/joel-embiid-overtakes-lebron-james-favorite-win-mvp%3fplatform=amp  media is ridiculous
Lebron James is more valuable thane Embiid and it's not even close. Only reason Embiid is in the conversation is because of narrative.   Without narrative LBJ should've won the last 15 MVPs.

"What‚Äôs your source on lebron being the most dedicated? What‚Äôs your measurement of dedication? Do you think jimmy butler doesn‚Äôt train hard or eat well? Do you think Paul George breaking his leg was an example of poor diet? What about Gordon Hayward? Kevin love was famous for his diet and training and he‚Äôs been barely able to play for years. James Harden has a shit diet and partied late and is a god damn iron man. Is Kevin love just didn‚Äôt training or eating well? A huge part of genes is determining if your body reacts well to training, too. Not everyone can handle the work load, some people develop over working conditions like tendinitis or lose their cartilage. Plus there‚Äôs shit like lebron‚Äôs teammates mocking his diet.   Yes, lebron maximizes his potential. But his potential is defined by hitting the absolute gene lottery. If you ever played sports you would see first hand how working hard is not the greatest determination of success, health, potential, etc. Some guys are born jacked, put on muscle easily, and just don‚Äôt get fat. It‚Äôs ridiculous how much advantage some have. Some guys are just always injured. It‚Äôs just the way life is."

"""LeBron James ""MVP"" based on his workload and great raw stats (57 PPG), but can't do it given the awful team record (2-80).""  Seriously, he's just putting up empty stats in garbage time (which I assume is the whole game)"
I just want to point out the actual title of the article is:  &gt;Lakers trade deadline preview: How defending champions can fortify around LeBron James and Anthony Davis
Defense and LeBron James. Defense correlates surprisingly well to regular season success
LeBron James is my most favorite player from my least fav. team Lakers
"**TEAM AKUNPOURLIKE30FTTALL**  A new expansion team earns some solid TV rights as the new home of superstar LeBron James. Fellow Ohio hero Mike Conley (former Buckeye) joins him on the venture, representing a near ideal sidekick to the King given his steady play and solid outside shot.  The rest of the team? They have some issues. PG Akunpour and SG Zandrick Ellison understand their role (get the ball to LeBron) well, but SF Mrs. Ellison struggles to understand her own. In fact, she doesn't even understand the rules of basketball. She constantly carries the ball without dribbling, leading to a league high 7.4 turnovers per game.  Opponents feel bad for the 70-year-old lady, not abusing her TOO much on defense. Besides, they have the reddit guards to pick on for that. Defenses routinely score 160-170 points per game against the team, leading to easy win after easy win.  Some media members consider giving LeBron James ""MVP"" based on his workload and great raw stats (57 PPG), but can't do it given the awful team record (2-80)."
LeBron James has a tendency to get the absolute best out of anyone he plays with. Adding Fournier might not be such a bad idea.

"**TEAM KD RETURNS TO WASHINGTON**  Flash back to 2016. Fans of the Washington Wizards rejoice as hometown hero Kevin Durant announces that he's taking his talents to D.C. to rejoin his old coach Scottie Brooks (recently hired). Immediately, many peg the group as a true contender despite only finishing 41-41 the season before.  The Wizards start a little rockier than some expected, given the youth on the roster. After all, Beal (23 years old) and Bogdanovic (year 3 year in NBA) have not fulfilled their full potential yet.  At the same time, the overwhelming talent of prime John Wall and Kevin Durant proves to be difficult for the league to handle. Wall takes charge as an alpha dog leader and attack dog in transition, showcasing his underrated vision and passing ability. KD passively aggressively snipes to the media that Wall is the ""best PG he's ever played with,"" leading to a surly Westbrook press conference the next day.  Overall, it's hard to argue with the results. Durant helps lead the team to an immediate +15 game turnaround (going 56-26), winning MVP honors in the process. Wall leads the league in assists (11.1) and earns 2nd team All-NBA honors.  Of course, the true test comes in the playoffs and -- more specifically -- the Eastern Conference Finals where Durant matches up with rival LeBron James (still on Cleveland.) The series is an instant classic, with KD and LeBron trading punches, and sidekicks Wall and Kyrie Irving having their own big games here and there. The teams head into Game 7, deadlocked at 3-3.  In that final game, it turns out to be Kevin Love who provides the difference. Love catches fire and hits 5-7 threes, leading to a 26 point barrage that helps the Cavs slip by and head to the Finals once again.  The Wizards go home disappointed, but hopeful that they can be right back in the title mix as Bradley Beal continues his ascent."
You put Michael Jordan and LeBron James on the same team with a clearly better coach and think it's in anyway a discussion
"NFL athletes train for explosive short bursts, I think its worth mentioning that a lot of nba athletes would be faster with higher verts if they didn't train for stamina as well which offsets the type I/II muscle composition.  Explains at least part of why nfl athletes have greater vertical combine numbers than nba athletes.   Obviously other factors involved as well; nba height reqs - tall guys have lower verts all things equal, intrinsic explosiveness selected for in the nfl and exploitable nfl testing - is his standing reach REALLY that low are also a part of it.   That all being said, Miami Lebron James (maybe on HgH) would absolutely make an nfl roster at tight end.  He is one of the best lob catchers in the history of basketball and we know that skill transposes from basketball to football."
Agreed. Still not betting against Lebron fucking James being good enough for a roster spot though. There are some real scrubby dudes in this league still lmao
Y‚Äôall ever heard of LeBron James? Or how about Micheal Jordan?
"&gt;It‚Äôs pretty unreal that he‚Äôs been one of the best players in the league for like 16 or 17 years straight    Crazy thing is, THAT is not even the ""unreal"" part. What's actually unreal is the fact that NO ONE WAS EVEN CLOSE.. every year.   &gt;  Not unless you count the regular season. That's been LeBron's coasting time of the year ever since he left Miami. But when the Playoffs arrive, the big stage with the most pressure.. there's always LeBron above each and everyone else. The Lion in his jungle  &gt;  No one has ever done MORE with so much LESS, than LeBron. And no one ever will    Throughout his entire career, with the most burden.. pressure and non stop unrealistic work load + leading new players and teams over and over and over again.. Still never getting injured or missing games. Always there. Always dominating, even quite effortlessly. Just everything  &gt;  It's mental. Somehow people still don't appreciate and comprehend LeBron James.. completely. LeBron being LeBron is basically ""normal"" now to most people. It has been almost 2 decades"
Lonzo has been this good since he was a Pelican but has had no momentum due to injuries. Shit he was putting up good numbers on LA the last LeBron year when Bron was out then he got injured in a Rockets game he was shutting James Harden down in. The guys a really really good winning player but he needs to stay healthy to get in rhythm
"Although given the age of the article, it's now ""Lebron James *was* a better defender.."""
"I moved to the US in elementary school not knowing much about the NBA, and to fit in and make friends, I still remember pretending I knew who that young kid LeBron James(?) was who‚Äôd just gotten his first triple double(?). Started following him for real soon after and couldn‚Äôt have imagined I‚Äôd graduate college and start my first job while this guy was still the best in the world.   Haven‚Äôt been his biggest fan the whole time, but at this point his presence at the top has gotten to be a rare comforting constant in life. Good reminder to appreciate every minute because we‚Äôre all gonna miss him when he hangs them up"
"I heard lebron James say ‚Äúbitch‚Äù while on the court. Is lebron misogynistic? Does he have deep beliefs towards women being inferior? Should the Lakers cut him? Should the league throw him into word jail? Investigation incoming, as r/nba tries to cope with hearing a word"
yeah and one player in basketball (lebron james) has more impact than one player in baseball (mike trout)
Pierce would have been best SF for multiple seasons if not for somebody named LeBron James.

"I think they should go after Lebron James instead. They need playmaking. He's one of the greatest passers and floor generals this game has ever seen. Put him out there with Kawhi and PG and that's a scary matchup for any team, even the Lakers"
DeSean Jackson and Stephen Jackson were the face of it among athletes - along side Nick Cannon and Ice Cube for Hollywood/music - but plenty of players were very vocal of their support of them including Kevin Durant and Dwayne Wade.  The only players bigger than those two on the planet are Michael Jordan and LeBron James but it doesn't appear the NBA cared at all.   There's certainly no question he used the word but there's no question that KD and Wade supported Jackson and Cannon's statements too.  Teams and the league certainly weren't that concerned about anti-Semitism then.  The only real difference I see between then and now is skin color.
It‚Äôs LeBron James son.  Even if he doesn‚Äôt look like a good prospect now he will develop into a legit player. He literally has access to LeBron and has extremely high expectations
LeBron james and every athlete who was silent. Silence is violence
"LeBron James: No years at college.   Kevin Durant: One and done.   Anthony Davis: One and done.   Carmelo Anthony: One and done.   &amp;#x200B;  Works both ways, really."
"Oh no! Everyone uproar ! Everyone freak out! Omg! Start a war ! Can we remember the NBA and China are butt buddies , the same China that supports and inacts slave labor ? The same China LeBron James defends ? Where's that outrage ?"
that‚Äôs subjective lol. Lebron James has done much worse and still has his job so I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs acceptable to have him fired. Pretty hypocritical of the nba
"If James Harden played in the Pierce/Walker era Eastern Conference, he would be in the finals every year and have at least one ring.  This dude played the Warriors 4 times in the playoffs and the Lebron/AD Lakers before he could even sniff making the Finals"
Would a combination of LaMelo Ball and Carmelo Anthony be better than the total package that is Lebron James
last time nba got thsi mad about soemthing? it was lebron james and they called him a genocider best thing myers need to do is ignore thsi shit and it will disappear in a week liek other twitch streamers have done
"There are many other factors to the outcome of a series.  On an individual level, there's a difference between ""efficient"" and ""better overall"".   Since 2011, I don't think I've seen a playoff series that LeBron James played in where I didn't come away thinking he was the best player in that series. Not one. Maaaayyybe 2017 or 2018 Finals with KD, but they were about equal and KD had a far superior supporting cast.  Every year from 2011 till now, if you asked me to pick one player to lead my team to ring, I would pick LeBron 100/100 times. Even now in his 19th season or whatever the fuck it is."
"Thanks for the link. It was interesting to see someone as smart as West speak so highly of 24 yr old James. But I think he was talking about at that time who was better. He even says kobe is not a young man, so I think he was just saying who he'd rather have at that point. He wasn't saying Lebron passed Kobe all time.   I don't think anyone would put bron in MJs tier without any rings.   &gt; sometime in the next six years after that and LeBron could‚Äôve won at least one title.  Absolutely not  There is no way lebron in cleveland is beating the lakers/celtics, let alone the future OKC/spurs teams that were stacked with talent. He barely got by the 2012 celtics and 2013 Spurs with the Miami team.   I don't have enough trust in the cleveland front office to think they'll give lebron help. Even 11 years later and with a ring, I don't think you can say they're a well run team."
"I mean bro.... udonis haslem has stuck around on a roster while playing like 300 minutes over the last FOUR YEARS!! ....thats the equivalent of like 6 full games! He's scored 45 points over the last 3 seasons lol  If a guy who is a career 7.6 ppg player can stick around and play single digit games over a 4 year span just becausue of his intangibles, im fairly certain that pretty much every single team in the league would be able to find a spot on the bench for Lebron fucking james for a season or two even if he doesnt play a single minute...  and I'd be willing to bet Lebron at 44 will probably still be quite a bit more productive than haslem was at 40 lol"

"&gt;I have absolutely no idea how the draft/player transfers work.  for the draft, teams are assigned a draft position based on their record from the previous year, with the worst teams picking first. the top 14 picks aren't actually given out in order, but have a lottery drawing weighted by your record. every player who is eligible and plans on entering the nba the next season enters the draft, and the teams pick from this full pool of prospects.  player transfers are pretty complicated and a whole other thing.  &gt;Is there a good opportunity for different teams to make the playoffs/win the league every year?  the nba is kind of known for its lack of parity actually. basketball is a 5 on 5 sport where every player is playing offense and defense. an individual player holds way more power than in other team sports. it's the team sport where a superstar has the most impact because of this. you get lebron james or another top 5 player it instantly puts you towards the top of the league in most cases regardless of the roster around them. this is good or bad depending on your preference. the focus is strongly on players over team, and a great player wins games by themselves. this also means that when 2,3,4 stars end up on the same team, they almost always win. the league has been a league of dynasties, where teams with multiple stars have 5+ year runs of constantly being in the finals or winning championships."
"I disagree.  He couldve been a star if he put in the work.  Not ""the next lebron james"" but a star nonetheless"
"Lebron James, imagine what could‚Äôve been if his expectations were lower"
Even without the racial slur his speech during the stream is really vulgar and aggressive and not at all what I would be doing as a pro athlete who depends on brand endorsements.  Can you imagine Russel Wilson or Lebron James talking like that?
"Kevin O'Antetokounmpo says ""do not take LeBron James for granted"""
Do you think scouts say he is ‚ÄúLeBron James‚Äù like? I heard he models his game after LB.

"Is Jokic in the lead at the 6th seed with his atrocious defensive play?  Embiid missing the better part of a month will likely end his bid in addition to his 7 missed games.  Luka is the 8th seed.  Steph isn't even in the playoffs right now.  The voters will have fatigue and not vote Giannis because of his post-season failures, and Milwaukee whom I believe won't get the first seed which would be his only shot.  James Harden has his Houston mess which will turn off voters in addition to being apart of a superteam roster with 34 combined allstar appearances.  So LeBron, who has a great record without Anthony Davis, is ranked at the top of multiple defensive metrics, which Patty Mills and Rudy Gay are not, should be the in the lead yes? Poised to keep winning games without Anthony Davis for another 3 weeks.   Also, LeBron consistently posts some of the best on/off court stats in the league year in and year out.   How do you *not* make the case LeBron is the favorite and in the lead right now?"
"I‚Äôm sorry but this is just full blown nephew takes. Not going to even bother responding anymore who thinks adding Robert Covington to the blazers suddenly makes the capable of beating lebron James in the playoffs,"
Lebron James

You don't think Lebron James puts a ton of effort and money into helping black issues? How is that a controversial statement to make?
"Such snowflakes they are. What kind of weird human are you that you need only LeBron James to tell you to get a vaccine. Not Kevin Durant, not James harden, not Steph Curry. But only lebron? Weird motherfuckers."
The black community does not listen to Lebron James or any athlete as much as you think they do. You‚Äôre delusional.
"&gt;does that mean Simmons doesn't always match up with the opposing teams best player?  1) The league is far too switch-happy for *anyone* to guard the opposing teams best player 100% of the time. It's simply not reality. ISO possessions are a minority in the NBA and are decreasing YOY (I think)  2) Strength of Schedule I imagine plays a part in this - even if you have 2 players who have guard the opposing teams best player the same amount of the time, there's a big difference between that being Lebron James and Jerami Grant depending on how many times X team has played the Lakers vs played the Pistons.  3) It could very easily be a 72.9% vs 72.7% - remember this is just an ordinal ranking"
Idk ask Asian and Hispanic folks   And it means that a lot of black people look up to and aspire to be someone like LeBron James
"There's a massive difference between saying that stats are misleading and saying that stats don't matter. Looking at TS% and PPG randomly would make you believe that Anthony Davis is the 2nd greatest playoff scorer to Michael Jordan, which is untrue, however ignoring stats would mean that you wouldn't recognize Davis as a great scorer at all.  Looking at stats without any context would land you at thinking that LeBron James is as good as a scorer as Kevin Durant or that Karl Malone was a better scorer than Kobe Bryant and Larry Bird, which are asinine thoughts and the reason you have to actually THINK and watch the games before making a stupid conclusion."
"I know I shouldn‚Äôt, but I can‚Äôt help but be irritated that Harden is even in the conversation. Statistically he absolutely deserves to be in consideration, but the way he left Houston was was petulant, stupid, and pathetic to a degree that he shouldn‚Äôt be rewarded with jack shit.  He‚Äôs the the best player for the 4th best record in the league, but he also broke Covid rules while holding out for a trade mid-season. Fuck James Harden.  *disclaimer: I don‚Äôt think LeBron should be the obvious front-runner either. Giannis and Jokic are a small step ahead of him imo*"
"It‚Äôs not Gobert‚Äôs fault that he has a great supporting cast but it puts a dent in the idea that he‚Äôs ‚Äúcarried‚Äù the team. Kobe carried the mid-2000s Lakers. Lebron carried the mid-2000s Cavs. Gobert has never carried anything.  &gt; KAT has never accomplished anything  You realize he plays for the TWolves, right? And what has Rudy ‚ÄúJames Harden‚Äù Gobert done in the playoffs besides get exposed on switches? You act like the Jazz have done shit in the playoffs lmao"
"Nice selections. This is what I've come up with while trying to take into consideration individual stats, team success and games played/minutes.      |Team|Player|Position| :-:|:--|:--|.    |1st|Damian Lillard|G| |1st|Stephen Curry|G| |1st|Giannis Antetokounmpo|F| |1st|LeBron James|F|.   |1st|Nikola Jokiƒá|C|.   |||.   |2nd|James Harden|G| |2nd|Luka Donƒçiƒá|G|.  |2nd|Kevin Durant|F| |2nd|Kawhi Leonard|F|.   |2nd|Joel Embiid|C|.   |||.  |3rd|Chris Paul|G| |3rd|Kyrie Irving|G|.  |3rd|Jimmy Butler|F| |3rd|Paul George|F| |3rd|Rudy Gobert|C|"
"Larry Bird is *not* a better scorer than LeBron James. A better shooter yes, but LeBron has averaged more PPG in his career shooting a better FG%, has a scoring title (Bird has none), and only averages 0.03% less than Bird from 3 (looks fake, it‚Äôs not) and 0.15% less from the FT line. Oh and the extra 14k points in only 5 more seasons helps. Also: LeBron has 13 games with 50 or more points. Bird has 4."
"It‚Äôs cause he was considered #2 behind lebron even when he was in OKC. He even got tired of being  #2  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1614921-kevin-durant-is-tired-of-second-place-on-new-sports-illustrated-cover  ‚ÄúThe Oklahoma City Thunder superstar receives plenty of recognition and praise for what he can do, but there's always someone ahead him. LeBron James, the Miami Heat and even Greg Oden have always been in front of him.‚Äù  And this was in 2013 lol"
"It's not necessarily tied to an elite defensive team at all, it's just very lineup and replacement reliant and it doesn't actually do anything to try and quantify what a player does defensively.   &gt;If individual defensive rating only about having an elite defensive team then why is Giannis ranked so high if his team is barely in the the top 10?  I mean using one example is just bizarre. I could easily ask you why the hell Rudy Gay and Patty Mills are the two best defenders in the league according to individual defensive rating? Does the fact that they're both on the same team not perhaps hint that maybe it isn't so ""individual"" after all? Why are Rudy gay, patty mills, Cameron johnson, Ty jerome, Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, Shake Milton, and Kyle Kuzma all better defenders than Joel Embiid who is somehow 30th? Why does Rudy Gobert barely scrape into the top 10, despite clearly being the most impactful defender in the league? Why is DPOY candidate Myles Turner a whopping 64th!? Behind notable defensive studs Malik Monk and Duncan Robinson?  ""How do you reconcile that?""  Or is this argument only to rationalise voting LeBron James first because he's an amazing player who should have more MVPs? Just because he's had an incredible career, doesn't mean he should win again this year."
I see you have your r/NBA talking points.  If individual defensive rating only about having an elite defensive team then why is Giannis ranked so high if his team is barely in the the top 10?  Because apparently defense rating means nothing because it's completely tied to being an elite defensive team and not individual play...   How do you reconcile that?  Or is this only an argument you bust out to discredit and somehow rationalize a 36 year old LeBron James dominating both ends of the court in year 18.
"LeBron James is number one in individual defense rating and defensive wins shares. Kawhi isn't even top 35 or top 20 for both of those if you account for at least his amount of games played.   LeBron is having his best two way season since Miami statistically, and Kawhi is having one of his worst."
Getting Chris Bosh and LeBron James did end up really well.
"kyrie has never been in the MVP convo because he played with lebron and the two seasons in boston, he wasn't playing like himself. Situation matters a lot. James harden was never considered MVP until he became the leader of the rockets. Westbrook didn't become MVP until he was the main star of a team. If kyrie was the main star of a team that was built around him he would have the potential. He's literally one of the most skilled players in NBA history, if not the most skilled."
"This is the premise:‚ÄùWhen basketball champion and global icon LeBron James and his young son Dom (Cedric Joe) ‚Äì who dreams of being a video game developer ‚Äì are trapped in a virtual space by a rogue algorithm named Al-G Rhythm (Don Cheadle), LeBron must get them home safe by leading Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Lola Bunny and the whole gang of notoriously undisciplined Looney Tunes to victory over the Al-G's digitized champions on the court.‚Äù   So by digitized champions I think that means that may be Draymond, Klay, Dame, and Diana Taurasi are gonna be the players the Looney Tunes and LeBron will have to go up against"
"&gt;I literally said that it was unfair to compare him to Jordan and James, because he isn't close. You're putting words in my mouth and ignoring my comments. All I said is that he turns it up in the playoffs compared to normal.  I remember you said that he wasn't on the level of Jordan, but the problem with your statement that Luka 'turns it on' in the playoffs is that **there are only 2 players who've** ***consistently, definitively*** **shown they specifically turn it on in the playoffs &amp; get even better in the playoffs: Jordan and LeBron**  I know everyone on this sub throws damn near every player into that category, and some other players have evidence of them turning it on in the playoffs (Kawhi), but my criteria is that there are only 2 who do it definitively. It's fair if you have a criteria that every player who improves their stats marginally can be dubbed that, but there's only 2 who've definitively proved it.  Saying every player who ups their TS% a point or two in the playoffs can be dubbed as ""Playoff \_\_\_\_"" diminishes the value of that impressive title, because then you could say a lotta players definitively play better in the playoffs when they really had marginally better stats due to a very small sample size not being reflective of the assertion that they're somehow better in the playoffs.  &gt;I never said you can't judge Luka based on one series. He played excellent, and despite that fact, we lost our second star and lost the series. You can't ignore context.  When players are held to the same standard GOAT candidates are, they're gonna accept the blame too. If you're gonna hail him based on what he's done so far (which is the smallest sample size possible), so am I; no excuses for only every making it to the 1st round vs a choking Clippers team.   No one can be considered 'Playoff \_\_\_\_' if they've only ever made it to the 1st round.  &gt;I'm not gonna continue this conversation if you're gonna blatantly misrepresent my stance.  It doesn't matter. Luka stans are so convinced that he's already the GOAT, despite not holding him to the expectations of being the GOAT when he performs under expectation, that any conversation with you is possible because nothing would ever convince you."
"So now we can't judge Luka based on that one playoff series? Where he lost? In the 1st round in multiple games where he was blown out?  No one is blaming him for losing, but if you're gonna hail him as Playoff Luka and put him in the same breath as Michael Jordan &amp; LeBron James based on one playoff series, then we'll hold him to those insane standards.   It's impossible for a player whose only gotten as far as the 1st round yet to be hailed as having an ability only the Top 2 players ever *definitely* have and proved it over a decade of playoff dominance."
"Here's a glance of the NBA all-time scoring list:  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (38,387)  Karl Malone (36,928)  LeBron James (34,792)  Kobe Bryant (33,643)  Michael Jordan (32,292)  Dirk Nowitzki (31,560)  Wilt Chamberlain (31,419)  Shaquille O'Neal (28,596)  Moses Malone (27,409)  Elvin Hayes (27,313)  Carmelo Anthony (26,947+)  Hakeem Olajuwon (26,946)  Oscar Robertson (26,710)  Dominique Wilkins (26,668)  Congrats to Melo!"
No way in hell. I‚Äôm pretty sure that a healthy Lebron James hasn‚Äôt missed the playoffs in ten years. When was the last time cupcake made it that far?
James Harden isn‚Äôt playing better than LeBron.. AD had played 23 games.. KD had played 19. It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs a big difference in games missed between the two... Are we ignoring the fact that James Harden‚Äôs second best player is Kyrie Irving? Or did he die when KD got hurt lol. You‚Äôre the one who sounds like a ‚Äúcasual‚Äù bud
James Harden is what you get when you fuse LeBron and Curry together. He's the best basketball player to ever play.
Let‚Äôs be honest if Bronny James turns out to be half decent he‚Äôll probably just step right into the mantle when Lebron retires just purely based off his name and the following that goes with it. Adam Silver will be salivating at the story line and money that would come with it too.
"When I tuck my 9 year old son in to bed, I have to explain what to him what it means to be an NBA champion. How you fight with your brothers through the mud and then through your conference just to play a final 7 round championship series.   Now the reason why I have to explain all this is because of Lebron James tarnishing the reputation the great ones before him brought. When he put on those Mickey Mouse Ears and dribbled for the big Mouse, we all knew Mike would never do that. Kobe even knew better but he had to learn his lesson with that one girl. Let this be a lesson to the one generation out there to never give up"
Yeah why don‚Äôt the Los Angeles Lakers and LeBron James ever get talked about? Feels like I *never* hear about them.
Lebron James shits all over Tim Duncan
the difference between lamelo and wiseman right now is the difference between lebron james and brad wanamaker right now.
"‚ÄúThe Banana Boat Team, Banana Boat Squad or Banana Boat Crew is a hypothetical pop culture NBA superteam, consisting of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Paul.‚Äù  However, looking at the pictures, you‚Äôre right. Melo was on the same vacation though"
PG: Michael Jordan SG: Kobe Bryant SF: Larry Bird PF: LeBron James C: Hakeem Olajuwon
No it's simple we just trade Oubre for Bradley Beal and the MN pick for Towns. Oh and Wannamaker for LeBron James.  I swear some of the trades I see suggested on the sub are no better than this.
"You left off the most important row: ""name is lebron James"""
"He's not whining that LeBron deserves more MVPs.  &gt; I've had an official ballot in every season starting in 2013-14, and have not voted James as MVP in any of them. At the time, each vote felt fine -- close in some seasons, but fine. I don't regret any of them now.  He's saying that across 8 years, it seems ridiculous that the best player across that entire span hasn't won. That's not saying he deserves it. It's saying the situation is surprising."
LeBron James and Serena Williams would have the GOAT imo
"First of all, the OP completely butchers shit - the article is paywalled, so most people won't notice, but he actually selectively quotes and moves stuff around. The other thing is that what's lost in the quoting is that Lowe is talking about the ""discourse"" of the MVP race and not talking about his personal justification. Here's the full quotes and I'll bold the stuff the OP quoted.  &gt;The discourse surrounding last year's top two finishers -- the Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James -- was primed to get messy and interesting and maybe a little edgy in the media even before Harden and two behemoth centers crashed the MVP race. Antetokounmpo has won the past two MVPs, outpointing James easily last season.  &gt;Antetokounmpo's statistical case was almost unassailable -- at least according to almost every publicly available statistic. He also won Defensive Player of the Year. The Bucks finished with the best record in the NBA.  &gt;And then the world went haywire, and for whatever reason -- including the Miami Heat exposing the remaining holes in Antetokounmpo's game -- **the Bucks flamed out in the postseason. James and the Lakers rose up. It was a reaffirmation: Duh, LeBron is still the best player when it matters.** In celebrating the title, James, stone-faced, demanded his ""damn respect.""  &gt;As our Brian Windhorst noted last month, James has not won MVP since 2013. You can explain away each individual season. I've had an official ballot in every season starting in 2013-14, and have not voted James as MVP in any of them. At the time, each vote felt fine -- close in some seasons, but fine. I don't regret any of them now. In totality, **it still seems undeniably stupid that that guy we all recognize as the best player alive has not won MVP in eight years.** It just does.  Then you skip a couple of paragraphs talking about why voters might be reluctant to award Giannis his 3rd straight MVP (it would put him in an exclusive club) he talks about how James is probably behind Jokic, Embiid, and Giannis statistically.  The rest of the article is about the more fringe MVP candidates (Dame, Luka, Curry, Kawhi) and how Harden will impact it."
Lebron James ^/s
"But it's not an argument. This is not an argument for LeBron being MVP last season, this season, or any season. Lowe says that he doesn't regret not voting for LeBron in any of the last 8 seasons. This article isn't even about LeBron. It's about James Harden"
"LeBron shouldn‚Äôt even be in the race. It‚Äôs Jokic, Embiid, Giannis and then daylight.   I‚Äôd honestly even put James Harden above LeBron this season"
seems like? skip has had brons dick in his mouth more than savannah James has had throughout his career  I wouldnt even be mad if lebron super violated skip. dude has made a career out of shitting on his career every day on national tv and social media

Looking at LeBron James and his past success in the finals without a superstar ( 2007 and 2015) I would say he has no chance .
"You sound just like the people who argue that LeBron James being rich proves the fact that black people don't face discrimination. ""See, look, black people can be rich after all.""  Obviously racial discrimination is wayyyyyy worse than cancel culture, but the analogy works because exceptions do not prove the rule. Just because some famous people have enough popularity to overcome attempts to cancel them, does not in any way invalidate the experience of those who get fired or have their lives ruined by cancel culture mobs."

"I mean it‚Äôs why they got Zion, too.        Superstar AD leaves New Orleans. This comes after Chris Paul did the same thing, and Phil Jackson even made comments to the tune or ‚Äúa franchise in NO is not viable, but the league desperately wants to keep trying‚Äù.          What happens? Oh would you look at that! NO gets the most hyped player since LeBron James in the draft."
Randle retires as the all time scoring leader for the Detroit Pistons at age 45.  Lebron james takes multiple years off with league permission at the end of this current contract. But it‚Äôs made clear he‚Äôll come back and sign with whatever team draft‚Äôs his son. Ends up retiring at 47 but bronny jr never could beat Julius.    Kawhi Leonard doesn‚Äôt retire but instead just sorta will show up randomly on random teams for the next 50 years.   Durant? Durant got really into the 60s and no one ever saw him again.
"This is just silly. If you think any of those guys are as valuable to their team as James, you must be a casual. LeBron is the best field marshal, maybe in the history of the game. The intangibles that he brings to his team are immeasurable. You can‚Äôt make these evaluations merely by looking at statistics."
76ers about to catch the hugest of Ls for all the shit talk they been putting out.   Goddamn that LeBron James being the reason Embiid hyperextended his knee.
"&gt; Multiple all-nba is exceeding expectations as a #1 pick.  Let's see how many #1 picks have 2 all-nba team selections or more.

"36 is my stereotype of when a player should retire.  I get that all these are no ordinary players.  KD wants to retire with James Harden is my guess.  I think they are going to quit once they earn the championship trophy.  I give them 2 years of playing finishing on the Nets.  Kawhi I think he'll retire at 44, because he sells tickets that well.   I think he'll retire on the Pelicans.  Lebron, he'll retire at 40 on the Blazers.  Curry will retire at 38 on a team close to Austin Rivers, his brother-in-law."
That guy LeBron James
yeah but his name is LeBron James Jr. so he‚Äôs gonna get in the league no matter what
"He‚Äôs Lebron James‚Äô son and Lebron has said that he wants to play with his son  Bronny could be 5‚Äô1 with no shins like Cotton Hill and some team would give him a contract just for the merchandise sales that come with having Lebron James on your roster, let alone the almost guaranteed playoff berth"
"Obviously, these will most likely be wildly inaccurate. NBA players retire at whatever age they want, for whatever reason they want. Maybe they get tired of the game, maybe injuries just prevent them from being on court, maybe a relative falls ill, etc. Regardless, it‚Äôs fun to speculate based off their personalities.  I see James Harden retiring early, mainly because his off court shenanigans might be a hint towards him losing interest in basketball. I know people will say that‚Äôs not a good indicator, but then what else is? I‚Äôd love to ask Harden when he‚Äôll retire, but I can‚Äôt. I think winning a ring would impact his retirement age. Harden was loyal in Houston until he felt as if he couldn‚Äôt win, and since he‚Äôs been in Brooklyn he‚Äôs put his head down. A ring seems to be seriously important to him, if he gets one, I can see him retiring at around 35.  Lebron James is probably going to retire the year after his son gets in the league, that‚Äôs where all signs are pointing. I can see him being motivated to keep playing by other factors though, such as if he‚Äôs at 5 or 6 rings and wants to tie/ surpass MJ. Additionally, maybe at 40 he wouldn‚Äôt have slowed down all too much, and he‚Äôd find it enticing to go Tom Brady style, reaching unprecedented heights at unprecedented ages. So I‚Äôd say 40, but maybe up to 43.  KD just seems like a straight up baller to me. I can see him going until 39 or 40. He doesn‚Äôt brush his hair, doesn‚Äôt have a girlfriend or wife we know about, he‚Äôs the definition of a hooper lol. I see him playing this long simply because he doesn‚Äôt want to do anything else.  I see Curry retiring at 38. Once he loses his mobility he won‚Äôt be nearly as good at getting his shots off, and he won‚Äôt want to play until he‚Äôs some 12 PPG dude."
"Bro this is literally just a running hook, what‚Äôs highlight worthy about this aside form LeBron James lmfao)"

"A couple reasons. In the NBA, the team with the star almost always wins the trade. The KG and Pierce trade was an aberration because those guys were old and the Nets got way worse way faster than anyone anticipated.    James Harden is not on that career swing yet, and will be better for longer. As LeBron and Chris Paul have proved, a player can maintain productivity well into their late 30s. It's not like any of these guys will be banging down low or are overly reliant on athleticism either.    The Nets are also in the worse conference and Sean Marks has built this team from nothing once before, he can do it again. They're in the premier Eastern conference market, and will always be an enticing free agent destination. The Nets will do everything in their power to be good.   Finally, first round picks have been way overvalued lately. It's harder for teams to tank now and there's a lack of good prospects. There's no guarantee there'll be a player half as good as Harden available with those picks. Better to give up a ton of picks for a sure thing than make a gamble that another team will be bad enough to get you good picks, and that you can nail those draft picks if/when you get them."

Jordan Crawford on LeBron James
"**TEAM KEVIN**  Owner Kevin Hart has made enough movies and enough money to buy an expansive franchise, which he's named after himself.   The roster looks stacked, with 5 players who are multiple-time All-Stars across the board. There's a distinct Minnesota flavor to the frontcourt as well, as KG and Kevin Love played for the T-Wolves and McHale coached them. The chemistry appears to be off the charts during training camp, with the Kevins feeling like a title may in the cards.  As the season starts, that chemistry carries over -- especially on the offensive end. The Kevins start to defer to Kevin Durant as a matchup nightmare. Opponents can't guard him with smaller wings, because they'll be abused on switches against the big men on the roster. The Kevins score nearly at will, with KD leading the way with 28 points per game on sparkling efficiency.  Defensively, the team is more up and down. Kevin McHale huffs and puffs trying to keep up with modern wings, leading to some upset losses here and there. When Paul George goes for 41 points against the team, they start to re-think their strategy. More and more, they let KG come out on the perimeter and guard some fluid wings.  Ultimately the team heads into the playoffs with the # 2 seed in the Western Conference, and a good shot of winning the title. In round 1, they bully ball their way to 4-1 series win over Dallas. In round 2, they manage to pull off a slugfest 4-2 win over Utah.  In the Western Conference Finals, they match up with the L.A. Lakers and LeBron James, proving to be their toughest test to date. However, prime Kevin Garnett proves to be a good defender for the older version of LeBron, and his constant barking appears to be bothering the King. Kevin McHale's physical play also bothers the Lakers and Anthony Davis, who chirp often to the refs about dirty play. Ultimately, the Lakers don't have an answer for KD's offense. Durant scores 37 points in a decisive Game 6, leading the Kevins to the FINALS.  In those Finals... they match up with ANOTHER Kevin Durant and the Brooklyn Nets. The Nets prove to be a difficult matchup for our Kevins, who don't have a good answer for James Harden. Harden lights them up for 41 points in a game 1 victory. The Kevins pivot to a more ""ground and pound"" game, utilizing McHale's post game to help power them to wins in Game 2 and Game 3.   The series continues to go back and forth, with the Nets unleashing a 3 point barrage after that. Joe Harris gets loose for 5 threes in Game 4 (won by Brooklyn), and Kyrie Irving catches fire and goes for 33 in a Game 5 win.   Now down 3-2, the Kevins need to lick their wounds and get back on track. Again, they pound it inside with McHale and Kevin Love, slowing the game down, dominating on the glass, and pulling out the win.  It all comes down to this... Game 7. The Brooklyn Nets and Mike D'Antoni need to switch up their strategy -- and rely on Kevin Durant. They switch constantly, pulling KD off KD and giving him some mismatches. Team Kevin doesn't have much of an answer for Brooklyn-KD, who hits quite a few long bombs against McHale and Love. Brooklyn-KD goes for 35 points in a Brooklyn win. Our Kevins go home, upset, and intent on adding a little more perimeter defense next time around."
Unpopular opinion: James harden is a better passer than lebron althought he isn‚Äôt that flashiest.
"LeBron had an amazing pass from out of bounds to Mario Chalmers in Game 2 of the Finals against Dallas to tie up the game.  It's not brought up too often, but James just makes the pass look so easy, but not a lot of guys could make a perfect cross court chest pass like that one.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkcQnwynqOc&amp;t=235s"

A lot of elite athletes would be scary in MMA. Imagine peak Miami LeBron James pounding your ass to the ground. Nobody would even stand a chance. The physical advantage would be just insane. He would make all current heavyweights like Ngannou look like they belong in a lower weightclass.
"The NBA said Booker, at 24 years and 132 days, is the eighth youngest player in history to reach 100 games with 30 or more points.

"They dont need to stay hot in best of 7 apart from lebron and AD the rest of the lakers roster are below average or average at best on offence the nets def pretty much only have to focus on AD and lebron to win the game and im sure kd can handle lebron while the only problem is who can stop AD, but i can ask again who can stop harden and kyrie?

"sure, I'll trade Steph curry for LeBron James and AD. How about that? Then when lakers tank, trade Steph curry back for wiggins. DONE!"
Yeah cuz Curry won a ring and led a 73 team win and 7 games against Lebron James-Irving-Love. But yeah without KD Curry would have had no shot at another ring lol.
Lebron James created this pee. Lebron brought this pee onto us. The players love the pee but the owners and some fans do not. The media also love the pee because it makes them a lot of money. Pee is good for ratings.
"I really don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case, this Lakers team had a top level defense all year without AD even really seeing the court. Only one of these dudes is a DPoY.  AD won a championship with LeBron James next to him lol, put Giannis in that same spot he‚Äôd be a champion too lol."
"Lebron James and Curry, and then you have the 2 best defenders in Kawhi and AD?  And then you also have Jokic.  Better 2 way team and fit"
"All nba first team lebron James, all nba first team Anthony Davis, 6moty Montreal Harrell, 6moty runner up Dennis Schroder, close to all star Kyle kuzma. Also, lets not pretend that Drummond is some scrub, he was an all star 3 years ago and ""on layups"" is such a strawman."
Drummonds a fucking manic. He somehow has a higher turnover rate than LeBron and James Harden.
"LeBron James is the only player in the history of the NBA to go to another team when his contract was up, and on top of that he's the only player who's ever wanted to win a championship."
If that‚Äôs a defensive foul I‚Äôm Lebron James
"lebron gets more praise in the media because he is far more accomplished as a player than KD, and most basketball experts believe he is arguably a top2 player of all time.   no one thinks that about KD.   that doesn't change the fact that if you took a national poll of sports fans and asked them who their least favorite NBA player was, LeBron James would have by far the most votes of any player"
"I‚Äôm gonna be honest man, Dwight‚Äôs role in the championship run is incredibly overrated. The Lakers won because they had LeBron James and Anthony Davis. You could have replaced Dwight with any average centre and the results would have been the same."
Let‚Äôs see...  ‚ÄúWashed big man who hasn‚Äôt done much in recent seasons going to play with Lebron James on a title contender.‚Äù  Yeah dog never seen it before.
"Don't see any Lebron at all. Even when James was a teenager, he loved to settle for jumpers. He had a lot of big games just hitting jumpers. Fadeaways, off the dribble threes, step-backs etc. He was streaky, but could get hot. Zion doesn't even think about mixing it up. He usually just shoots wide open threes and tries to get to the the basket. Lebron kinda played that way in the 12/13 regular season, but his game was obviously much more well-rounded than current Zion."
"Why are you such a salty hater he‚Äôs been in the league 16 fucking years, you know the only player still at top 3 player in the league level in their 16th season? Lebron Fucking James and that‚Äôs it. And Dwight game was based on being strong and bouncy, both things you lose with age and yes he‚Äôs still doing it."
The difference is irrelevant here. The Lakers would not have won without Lebron James and Anthony Davis. The Lakers could not have won without Lebron James and Anthony Davis.
Lebron was trying to form james-ad-kawhi..  But failed
"You're so right.  If only other teams had proven their worth by going a combined 126 and 284 the previous five years, drafted several very *okay* players with their three number 2 picks in a row, and signed some of the worst contracts ever in Mozgov and Deng, they too could have gotten Lebron James and all that comes with him."
"Lakers have LeBron James, a top 10 player in AD, the top two 6 man of the year contenders from last year, and one of the best rebounding centers over the last decade. They are a super team for sure."

OP i'm sorry but you are either ignorant or willfully ignorant right now.  LeBron James is the most hated NBA player of all time.
Steph Curry? LeBron James? Kobe Bryant? Magic Johnson?
This is reminiscent of the Kevin Love to LeBron James full court pass fade away against the Wizards.
"James Harden has never won a chip, Kyrie won a chip with LeBron (One of the bests to play in the NBA and has made it to the finals 10 times), a washed up Blake Griffin who has never even been to the conference finals, and an old Lamarcus Aldridge.   They can't win alone so guess what they decided to do? Create a friggin Avenger team."
"Playing a significant role in helping a team win a championship does hold a lot of legitimate value.  On the flip side, I'd argue that playing a significant role on a team that *doesn't* win a championship doesn't hold as much value as it should.   For instance, even at the time, I felt LeBron James taking that 2007 Cavaliers team to the NBA Finals was one of the craziest carry jobs I'd ever seen and spoke volumes about his skills and legendary abilities (particularly considering he was only 22 years old at the time). But for most others, it only went down as an L and a mark on his record.   Same goes for when he was averaging almost 40-point triple-doubles in those mid-2010's Finals losses to Golden State. I felt some of those performances spoke to his greatness more than winning a ring with the Super Heat.   I guess the easier way to say it is I really value impact. And impact can mean taking a really good team and turning them into champions, or in some cases it can mean taking what'd otherwise be a lottery team and turning them into legitimate competitors. Impact isn't always a ring to me, but that's how we treat it, so it's no wonder guys look to stack that resume by any means necessary."
"&gt; First of all there‚Äôs no comparison between Lebron‚Äôs and Durant‚Äôs superteams   Wade had won the championship as the best player four years before, and averaged basically the same stat line as Lebron James on the same efficiency their first year in Miami. He made first team-all nba in  the two preceding seasons before Lebron joined Miami. He was a top 2 guard in the NBA, and one of the 5-7 best players. Chris Bosh was a 5 time all star at 26.       &gt; Kyrie and Kevin Love is nothing compared to James Harden and Kyrie   Kevin Love was 26 and 13 guy the year before he joined Cleveland. He was basically asked to play out of position for his entire run with them. Of course he isn't as good as Harden, but he was a top 15 player.   This has no bearing on whether or not he created superteams. If Lebron hadn't created super teams he probably wouldn't have any championships and he wouldn't be considered one of the best players of all time.  &gt; Secondly Lebron played with absolute garbage around him for years and years always leading his team to overachieve   This has no bearing on whether or not he created superteams. If Lebron hadn't created super teams he probably wouldn't have any championships and he wouldn't be considered one of the best players of all time.  &gt;  Durant wasn‚Äôt even the leader of the team during his championships.   After Durant joined he was the only player on Golden State to win FMVP. If you don't think he was the best player and the leader than you are blind."
"First of all there‚Äôs no comparison between Lebron‚Äôs and Durant‚Äôs superteams  Old Wade and Bosh is nothing compared to Steph,Klay,Dray and Iggy  Kyrie and Kevin Love is nothing compared to James Harden and Kyrie  Secondly Lebron played with absolute garbage around him for years and years always leading his team to overachieve. Durant has never played without a multiple time all star by his side and generally had competent teams. Lebron gets more respect because we know he can do a lot with less help, Durant wasn‚Äôt even the leader of the team during his championships."

"&gt;How many superstars are gonna stick it out in fucking Charlotte? Or Cleveland. Now how many LA Superstars have left LA (before their careers were virtually over)?  O'Neal left Los Angeles -- not by choice, but had he not, Bryant would've, so that's one either way.  Chris Paul went to and from LA.  Dwight Howard went to and from LA.  Not that many superstars actually change teams before age 30.  Leonard did it twice.  James did it once.  Chris Paul did it once.  Durant did it once.  Davis did it once -- if he's in that class.  Carmelo Anthony did it once.  Dwight Howard did it twice.  O'Neal did it once.  That's about it, going back 20 years, and most of those were trades, and some quite expensive.  Maybe not in Charlotte, but Westbrook, Lilliard, Curry, Thompson, Antetokounmpo, Gobert, Simmons, Embiid, Beal, and others appear to be ""sticking it out"" in non-LA/NY markets.  Gasol stuck it out in Memphis.    &gt; Guys like Horford and Redick are sought after, but they aren't the marquee players that are like ""LA or bust.   No, they aren't, but Erving and Malone were.  Erving even left his hometown for Philly -- the Knicks made an offer, but the 76ers outbid them.  &gt;Any city outside those 3 needs to pray for a generational talent to fall in their laps and try to build up a roster around them.   You don't need a ""generational talent"" to win a ring, and you sure as hell don't need one to be competitive.  Miami doesn't have a generational talent, and went to G6.  Toronto didn't have a generational talent, and won a ring.  San Antonio did not have a generational talent in 2014, and won a ring.    &gt;You're not getting a generational talent if your team can consistently get the 7 or 8 seed.   You have to pick one here.  Either you use ""generational talent"" properly and it refers to LeBron James only, or you mean something else, in which case you have to include players like Antetokounmpo.  And he was precisely available to such a team -- Milwaukee went 38-44 and got swept by the Heat in the first round, and subsequently drafted their 2-time MVP.  Denver went 36-46, then drafted their franchise Serbian."
Compared to LeBron fucking James? Shutup
"Does it? Onkey paw rules say that Denver must sweep the Sixers with the worst point differential in a 4 game stretch in NBA history, all while every player on both team slowly succumbs to a single splinter infection that leaves both teams hobbled for the foreseeable future, leaving neither team able to complete that final game.  While Denver argues that technically the won that last game, 76ers argue that neither team could finish the final game, this nobody won the championship and the 6ers still need to lose one more game to decide it.  Both teams fight eachother over it in a contentious court battle that grows more and more grandiose every day, leading to both franchises running through all their money, forcing them to trade away every single good player they have before the start of the next season.  Also, the court rules in favor of the Sixers, but due to the timing, the NBA starts up the next season without completing the series at all, thus leaving neither team as winner.  This causes the NBA to simply null the entire season, or as the annuls of history remember it in 200 years ""that one season old non-cyborg LeBron James probably won but they forgot to data record the ending of the season for."""
"It's a lot less likely for one of the stars they got naturally to LEAVE.  How many superstars are gonna stick it out in fucking Charlotte? Or Cleveland.  Even with Lebron fucking James, Cleveland only won ONE ring in his time there and that was AFTER he left once. AD strongarmed his way out of New Orleans, which is not a small market by any stretch (not huge either but it's not Utah). Every trade deadline that a superstar is available, you hear ""I want LA/NYC/MIA or I want a title. If both are possible, even better."" Kawhi is like the only superstar I can remember that didn't force his way to LA, NYC or Miami in recent memory. He just went to a team that could contend. Then, the second his contract ended, he ran to LA like he wanted.  Guys like Horford and Redick are sought after, but they aren't the marquee players that are like ""LA or bust."" You'll see guys like Gordon Hayward sign with the Hornets because he can be The Guy there because they'll never get a Lebron or a Kawhi.  It's not about market to them, it's about connections. You can make a lot more connections in a city like LA or NYC (or even Miami) than even Philly, which is why it is not a desirable free agent destination. Any city outside those 3 needs to pray for a generational talent to fall in their laps and try to build up a roster around them. You're not getting a generational talent if your team can consistently get the 7 or 8 seed."
"&gt;Exactly that. Market. Does. Not. Matter. You're either LA/NY/Miami or you're not. Mainly LA/NY.  The Lakers have signed two major free agents in their history.  Admittedly two very good ones in Shaquille O'Neal and LeBron James, but that's a total of 10.5 player-seasons, of which they've spent about a quarter injured.  O'Neal wasn't good enough to win in Orlando, and James was 34 -- and most people thought he was semi-retiring to Hollywood.  Both of those deals turned out better than they looked at signing, and that's partially due to the Lakers being generally-excellent at roster construction.  Their 3rd-best free agent signing is Kurt Rambis, so it falls off quite steeply.  &gt;There are a ton of large markets in the NBA but only the ones in these cities get free agents to go there time and time again.  First off, Philadelphia acquired Julius Erving in his prime essentially as a free agent -- they paid cash for him.  Second, Philadelphia acquired Moses Malone after agreeing to a free-agent deal with him in '82.  That turned into a sign-and-trade after Houston sued, but it wasn't because Philadelphia wasn't attractive to him.  No one has picked up two better players on the open market.  And did not Al Horford and JJ Redick recently sign with Philadelphia when they were still sought-after?    That said, would you sign with a Philadelphia team if you had a choice?  I was watching the 1980 Finals the other day, and every time the Lakers scored a few baskets in a row, the Philadelphia crowd booed their team.  In the Finals.  Same thing happened in '82, as well.  Significant free agents have signed with non-LA/NY teams more often than not.  Durant signed with Golden State ( and Brooklyn ).  Steve Nash to Phoenix.  Aldridge signed with San Antonio ( and Brooklyn ).  Ariza to Houston.  West to Indiana.   Horford to Boston.  Pau Gasol to Chicago.  Billups to Detroit.  And many others.  And by the way, 13% of the teams are in LA/NY, so they should get about 1 in every 7 free agents by simple chance."
"Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving &amp; Lebron James was a super team in 2015.  The reason the Warriors got to the Finals that year was because the talent level was low in the league. Like I said, transitional period, the old guard in Duncan, Kobe etc were moving on and the young guys weren‚Äôt established in the league yet.  Besides Warriors and Cavs. You had Lob City Clips, Al Horford Hawks, Lowry Derozan Raptors, Harden Dwight Rockets, Dame LMA Blazers, KD &amp; Russ who were hurt a lot.  That‚Äôs how bad the talent was. Most teams had 1-2 All Stars at most. Lebron-Kyrie-Love is 100% a super team in comparison to the rest"
Not sure the Lakers are a super team. When LeBron and AD are out they don't have James Harden to take the reins.
Someone once called him ‚Äúthe LeBron James of Jeff Greens‚Äù and I can never ever get that out of my head.

"LeBron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Luka Doncic, maybe Nikola Jokic"
We like LeBron James. We don‚Äôt like Kevin Durant. WAH.
Yeah his name LeBron James
"I like power to the players, but it‚Äôs gone too far in the NBA.   James Harden this year was what really pushed me over the edge. No player should have that much power over a team, what is the point if they do? What is there point of the great, of free agency, of it all if star players are just going to force their teams to trade them to specific teams and play like shit until they do?    Between people like Harden, Irving, Durant, LeBron, Leonard, etc I just have a really hard time anymore enjoying this league."
"you really just compared the celtics big 3 of past their prime kg, ray allen, and paul pierce, the thunder of kids in their 20s while james harden was still a 6th man and the spurs ‚Äúbig 3‚Äù of tony parker manu and tim duncan to in their prime lebron dwade and chris bosh"
"""Lebron James, Steph Curry, and Jesus Christ request trades to Brooklyn"""
"No, but all three involve LeBron James becoming the league's first player-owner."
Generally speaking about LeBron James
Because on a Saturday night it‚Äôs easier to pretend LeBron James ruined your life and not yourself
Lebron James and Anthony Davis.
"&gt; Higher usg just means you have a higher impact on the game for better or worse.  This is true but lets say he gets someone who is also a 25+ ppg scorer on his team. Luka will be less beneficial because the other player will also want the ball. Not to mention Luka also has terrible defense. It will remind me of the all star game (but not as extreme) where he scored 8 ppg despite starting.  &gt;Now I don‚Äôt know his on/off numbers so that may be revealing but I doubt they‚Äôre bad.  He used to have very mediocre on/off numbers but that changed this year. He now is pretty good in that aspect, not anywhere close to the Lebron James, Michael Jordan or other superstar level he gets compared to though.. even at the same age. He helps his team on offense, but on defense he has been very bad every year but is even worse on that this year."
It‚Äôs Incredible the lengths you have to go to beat Lebron James.   You literally have to form the best of the best teams to beat this dude.
"&gt; Nets getting Blake, LMA is very similar to Lebron getting Wade, IT   Except the 2018 Cavs didn‚Äôt have James Harden and Kyrie along with Lebron. Wade and IT were meant to be big additions to the Cavs. LMA and Blake are playing reduced roles which will likely help the efficiency of their production."
"&gt;If you have to go to college to accomplish this  Duncan played in college barely six months before joining the Spurs and Robinson, which you'd know, if you knew anything.  &gt;No they're not, this is a discussion about how they played within one organization.  Flatly, no.  If you thought that was the question, you did not read effectively.  I literally said that Robinson ""was the superior basketball player in every respect"", which remains the case, and beyond serious dispute.  &gt;Their college career is as relevant as a discussion about Jordan's UNC days in a comparison against Lebron.  Which absolutely would be relevant.  The fact that James was averaging 31/7/7 in the NBA at the same age where Jordan was getting dismissed from both the ACC and NCAA tournaments in the second round is entirely meaningful in that would-be discussion.  At 21 years old, James would wipe the floor with 21 year-old Jordan all day, every day.  That doesn't necessarily apply to later ages, but it's beyond argument at that point in their careers.  Do you, in fact, know thing one?  Start acting like it."
You think Drummond is going to post up when he's on a team with LeBron James and Anthony Davis?
You really dont know what Lebron James does for his teammates do you? Drummond is gonna get paid once Bron fixes his game
"Not knocking lebron . but miami big three was where it started. Wade, bosch, james.  Sell literally everything for a super troop. Its exciting baketball.   But players are more likely to move randomly between groups post that. Maybe im overtitling it , but their was a change in team building after that  Hope that makes some sense"
Harden plans to be with the Nets just for the remainder of his contract.  I see him going back to Houston after he wins in Brooklyn and staying there till retirement. Going the Lebron route https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/11/17/report-james-harden-wants-to-join-nets-for-two-years-not-necessarily-longer/
Here is the list of active players with four rings : Lebron James.
"It's Tobias Harris not LeBron James, doesn't have to be that good to lock him down"
"You think any player wouldn't recruit these guys?   Rest assure, if there was a way for the Lakers to get James Harden, LeBron would be recruiting hard."
Lebron James Heat was that for me
"LeBron James must be kicking himself for starting this whole ""super team"" concept w players in their prime"
"Maybe he was referring to the addition of them to, you know, Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving. I have a strong feeling that he wasn‚Äôt suggesting that LMA and Blake are better than Lebron and AD lmao"
"If LeBron James and Anthony Davis lead the Lakers to the finals and then a win over the Nets, James is the best to ever do it."
All this to beat 36 year old Lebron James.
"Durant is not and has never been in the same tier as LeBron in terms of impact relative to ultimate team success. Ultimate meaning a championship and not just regular season success. The floor was opened up for him in GSW allowing him to be the best statistical player, but anyone who watched knows Steph was the most valuable and whom the offense but built around. This isn't mentioning another 20 PPG scorer in Klay Thompson shooting 40 percent from 3 along with a versatile 1-5 DPOY who can play make better than most point guards. His first year in Brooklyn is seen by generational scorer James Harden carrying so far almost the entire regular season while he is sidelined and can walk back into one of the most complete teams in the league where the floor will again be completely open for him with sparse double teams.   Maybe this comes off as hateful, but I just view this as facts. KD is an MVP, generational talent and scorer while being a plus defender, but at no point has he been the most valuable on a team winning the championship and if the Nets win this season that will continue. And at no point has he been on a super team that could not replace him with an average league forward and still heavily compete for a championship."
"Like I said even if you don't use the metric of everything going the same way, the other team has Lebron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love with nearly two minutes left in the game I'm sure they could find a bucket in that amount of time after the tension of nobody scoring had been broken, now had the block happened with 50 seconds left instead of a minute 50, I'd probably give it a little more credit, the way things stand now it was just a really pretty moment that's been drastically overrated"
"If the game plays out exactly the same Golden State doesn't score another point after the layup, Kyrie hits the 3-pointer and LeBron hits the free-throw after the Draymond foul so yes Cleveland would still win using the exact same way it plays out oh, now if you want to make the case that the layup would have broken the monotony of neither team being able to score the other team has Lebron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love with nearly two minutes left in the game I'm sure they can find a few buckets lol"
they ran into lebron james lmao
LeBron James has never averaged 9 rebounds for a season. He has one playoff run averaging 9 rebounds. It wasn't until he was 28 years old until he averaged 8 for a season. Why are you lying?   What part of MPJ is only 22 years old are you not getting? Kid don't even have an NBA body yet and he's still 2nd among his position.
"I don‚Äôt forget, it‚Äôs just less impressive when it‚Äôs next to LeBron James.  You putting AD over Harden, Giannis, Kawhi, Jokic, or Embiid? Those are the guys between him and the Curry, KD, LeBron tier imo."
Hoping for a Denver/Philly finals so JaVale and Danny Green can duke it out to prove which one is worthy of having as many rings as LeBron James
"No his ass gonna be on the bench if he does. But, with LeBron out he‚Äôs probably gonna be chucking like he was with the Cavs in the meantime. The guys a fucking manic he has a higher turnover rate than James Harden or LeBron."
"In the past decade we‚Äôve seen the Dwayne Wade/Chris Bosh/Lebron James Heat, the Kevin Durant/James Harden/Russel Westbrook Thunder and the 73 win Golden State Warriors. It‚Äôs debatable if they‚Äôre more talented than those teams and you‚Äôre straight up insane if you think they‚Äôre the most talented team in the history of basketball"
*Lebron James is not going to the Memphis Grizzlies*
LEBRON JAMES WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE  One of the goat calls
"Ideally you would want to hold down the paint first and foremost. Next, I would play hard defense on James harden like the lakers did last year and run the three pointers off the line. I‚Äôll live with James Harden floaters all day knowing that Lebron or Ad can easily get a bucket inside to match that. I would relentlessly attack KD, and Kyrie in isolation on offense. Kyrie/KD can‚Äôt contain bron I‚Äôm not even sure they can contain Schroeder. Kyrie/KD would be gassed trying to hold it down on both ends.   Later on In the game, Jeff Green/Blake griffin is another weak link on offense to abuse. If it got into a point into the game where harden or Kyrie are getting to the rim at will I would be more than comfortable letting Jeff fucking green being the one that beats us.   I think it ultimately comes down to limiting the three‚Äôs and staying out of foul trouble. You need to attack them at their weaknesses defensively and limit three point opportunities."
"Talkin' 'bout LeBron ""China"" James?"
Why do they keep referring to him as King James so much when most ppl just call him Lebron? They really want that nickname to blow up huh
Honestly wouldn‚Äôt give up a summer to do that if I‚Äôm the son of Lebron James. That kid is probably getting paid a shit ton of money
"Warner Bros: ‚Äúwell lure them in with the promise of LeBron James playing basketball with the looney tunes, and then when nobody‚Äôs looking , we do whatever the hell we want.‚Äù"
"When all you care about is stats, then yes, its absolutely useless. Why do you think Westbrook goes for the rebounds/assists? To get the easy triple doubles. He doesn't do anything else.      once he gets his triple double, he fades out.  I don't see someone like LeBron James or Steph Curry, or Giannis or Jokic, or KD going for triple doubles all the time. Why aren't they doing what Westbrook does? Westbrook is the only guy who aims for triple doubles and still manages to lose. And don't tell me because he was on shitty teams etc. He played alongside many great all stars."
Oh cool a Chinese government shill who told human rights supporters to 'shut up and respect China' in a movie! Can't wait to never watch that trash!  Lebron  James can fuck off and die.
That would be a great end. Lebron and Jordan are very different players and great in their own ways. James is much more willing to find the open man for a game winning shot.
"If both of Lebron James' former teams are the cellar dwellers of Reddit, what will become to the Lakers after he leaves?"
"Michael Jordon, Shaquille O‚ÄôNeil, and people have to remind me the 3rd guy is Lebron James."
"Highly dependent on who's put around him and if he stays healthy  Also dependent on his competition  LeBron james has 6 finals losses and he's arguably the 2nd best (or to some, best) player ever"
We're gonna need a LeBron B James now
"Kyrie thinks the Earth is flat, Lebron thinks vaccines are fake, Lou Will went to a strip club during the bubble and took pictures, James Harden went to a strip club during quarantine and took videos lol  NBA players are god-tier 1% athletes that barely graduated high school, you're asking for way way too much expecting them to be intelligent."
"It's insane man. This looks so much fun and LeBron actually is acting better. So many references to different pop themes, so many iconic moments and yet they hating. I venture to say had James done the first one and MJ the second, they would call the 2nd one better.  He copies the first space jam, he's a MJ wannabe. He does something different, he's ruined the series. It's ridiculous."
"I hate how they keep calling him ‚ÄúKing James‚Äù and Cartoon LeBron was cool, was hoping most of the movie was him as a Toon.  But, uh, the original was far from High Cinema but at first glance this looks like the original was The Godfather and this is ...Godfather Part 3."
"‚ÄúTo prepare for his role in Space Jam: A New Legacy, LeBron James spent 18 years playing in the NBA and 4 championships.‚Äù"
What I find most incredible is that Kevin Durant doesn't even apologize for his intolerable comments.  He only said he regretted that it became public. That's quite different.  An exceptional player who will never be able to have the same aura as LeBron James off the court.
"Greatest player I ever saw. Had the ability to create his shot for himself unlike any player I've ever seen. Man had infinite ways to score. Truly unstoppable. Could score at will. The Mamba Mentality is truly an inspiration. Lebron James is the greatest player now and has been for the past 10 years, but if Kobe had any of the teams Lebron had or if Kobe played in the East, Kobe would have even more rings. The Greek Freak has the physical potential to be the greatest ever if he ever becomes a great shooter but he can't even be compared to Kobe until he becomes a great shooter and wins some rings"
The final iconic game winning play will be lebron going for an outstretched block on a fast break.  Obvious reference to ‚Äúblocked by james‚Äù in the 2016 cavs championship.  This way they don‚Äôt copy the game winning dunk in the original space jam.
"Also, you all see Lebron trying to recruit Superman? Of course king james needs someone to save him again, micheal jeffery jordan would never."
Crazy to think actor Lebron James actually played in the NBA
"Top 10 in order. By the way, I don‚Äôt overreact to 30 regular season games like some do. A 3 month stretch isn‚Äôt going to undermine years of someone else‚Äôs work.   1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Stephen Curry   4. Kawhi Leonard   5. James Harden   6. Giannis Antetokounmpo  7. Nikola Jokic   8. Luka Doncic   9. Damian Lillard   10. Anthony Davis"
"Yeah, it is an old tweet - and my point is that even when it got press [back in 2016](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2014/10/30/old-tweets-kevin-durant-uses-gay-slurs-including-at-russell-westbrook-damian-lillard-rips-lebron-james/) thanks to r/nba's very own /u/jewishdoggy [posting it](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2kq2z4/i_dug_deep_and_found_tweets_from_nba_players/), he still didn't delete it. Dude's thin skinned and emotionally immature."
Durant was in the NBA finals going head to head with LEBRON JAMES at the age of 23 while curry had yet to make his first all star appearance.
All time favorite lakers in order  1. Kobe Bryant 2. Alex fucking Caruso 3. Lebron James
"Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Wilt Chamberlain."
"Well it‚Äôs because when someone says ‚Äúfinals team‚Äù the implication is usually that it‚Äôs a well put together, cohesive unit. The Cavs were not that. They were a hurriedly thrown together hodgepodge of overpaid role players and journeyman that only looked like a half decent product on the floor because Lebron james was on the court. Saying they sent him to a finals team is a lot less believable when you apply the context to the situation.   Again, looking at playoff stats, Lebron averaged 34/9/9/1/1 on 54/34/75 splits (62% TS). Lebrons closest contemporary was love who averaged 15/10 but took 13 shots a game to get there on below average efficiency. No one else averaged even 10 points.   This was not a finals ‚Äúteam‚Äù as much as it is a finals player."
Allow me to introduce you to a little known player named ‚ÄòLebron James‚Äô.
Dennis Lindsey isn‚Äôt even from Utah and all people can talk about is how this is Utah‚Äôs fault. ‚ÄúUtah doesn‚Äôt deserve a basketball team‚Äù ok then why tf does LA deserve one considering they literally spray painted the n word on lebron James house?
"Don‚Äôt matter, this league has no parity. We all know who‚Äôs gonna win, the Team with 3 Superstars.   Can‚Äôt believe they fucked around and let Prime Kyle Kuzma team up with Anthony Davis and Lebron James"
Negative. Giannis doesn‚Äôt even think he‚Äôs the best player on the planet.  [Source](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2920606-giannis-lebron-james-the-best-in-the-world-doesnt-matter-who-is-the-mvp)
LeBron James.             SIKE
"Fun fact: LeBron James and Andre Iguodala are the only players in NBA history to never commit a single foul. The refs haven‚Äôt seen it that way, but it‚Äôs true."
"Lakers handled them last year in 5. They lost the better player in Grant in the offseason.  Also, LeBron James.  Lakers in 5 again"
James Jones did a great job on the Suns.  Lebron James can learn a lot from him if he wants to become a GM when he retire.
"Doesn‚Äôt matter about the total number. It‚Äôs more about who was standing in their way. James Harden and the Rockets lost 4 times to the Warriors - who knows what happens if they‚Äôre able to reach the finals and play LeBron‚Äôs team . LeBron denied the Melo knicks team, PG Indiana teams, &amp; the Toronto teams because he stood in their way."
"Bill Russell responding to LeBron leavin him off his mount rushmore of nba players   ""Hey, thank you for leaving me off your Mount Rushmore. I‚Äôm glad you did. Basketball is a team game, it‚Äôs not for individual honors. I won back-to-back state championships in high school, back-to-back NCAA championships in college, I won an NBA championship my first year in the league, an NBA championship in my last year, and nine in between. That, Mr. James, is etched in stone."""
‚ÄúI‚Äôm closer to Lebron James than you are to me.‚Äù  -Brian Scalabrine
"There hasn't been a whole lot of parity in the league like there was in the 70s. Instead you have teams that go to multiple finals, back to back championships, even three-peats. We've got dinasties and the greatest teams (and players) in nba history dominating.  Chuck, Karl Malone, John Stockton had to face Michael Fucking Jordan and the Bulls, a team that three-peated on two separate occasions.  AI ended up having to face the dominant Kobe-Shaq Lakers who'll end up three-peating. That decade, in the west, ended up being dominated by the Lakers and Spurs. Also why Steve Nash doesn't have a ring.  And then you have the Big Three Celtics, the Big Three Miami. Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant weren't going to beat *that* Miami team.   And then the later half of the decade, you got a team that just broke the record for the best ever regular season record. And then the next year they add one of the greatest scorers ever to their roster. So it's not exactly crazy that Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Damian Lillard weren't going to get to the finals having to go through them  And of course you've got LeBron going to the finals every year, Kyle Lowry and Demar Derozan's biggest obstacle in the east.  The point is only one team gets the chip. Out of 30. And we've been seeing the same all-time great teams stopping so many MVP-caliber players from getting a ring.   The NBA community's gotten to a cancerous point where players aren't appreciated for their greatness. Instead all we wanna talk about is all time rankings, which is why the media and fans have put so much value on rings.   And then the media wanna complain why these superteams are formed? And then they're gonna talk about how great players like Brodie don't have a ring?? Like damn. Look at the competition they're facing."
The last player to win 3 MVPs in a row was Larry Bird. 1984-86. Magic Johnson didn‚Äôt do it. Jordan didn‚Äôt do it. Tim Duncan no. Lebron James no. Steph Curry no.   Giannis isn‚Äôt going to be rewarded with something even the GOATs didn‚Äôt accomplish when this season his team is performing worse (3rd seed) than in the prior 2 seasons where he won MVP.

Choked. Choked simply because the only person able to lock down LeBron James is LeBron James. Even if Dallas played smothering defense on him(which they did) if he wasnt choking hed still be absolutely amazing. But he sucked. SUCKED. All mental.
"Because that's not the team that was in the playoffs. Their top 9 guys in the playoffs were:  - Anthony Davis  - LeBron James  - Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  - Danny Green  - Alex Caruso  - Kyle Kuzma  - Rajon Rondo  - Markieff Morris  - Dwight Howard  Everyone is a positive defender, no one is an easy target to isolate on. And then two top 5 players carrying the load, including AD who had one of the best playoff runs of all time. The expression ""you're as weak as your weakest rotational player"" really confirms that they were a solid team.   But, on the other hand, the playoff competition in general wasn't that great last year."
What they really mean is sent him to Lebron james.
"I've never really gotten this thought process. They traded him to the favorites in the East to pair him with LeBron James and win a title. Nothing would have boosted his value like being the starting PG on LeBron's team as they make a championship run. The Cavs then proceeded to botch his PT, rush him back, then discard him after it didn't work out perfectly. This is the same office that was so incompetent David Griffin had to walk away from a coveted NBA GM job.   This sub thinks it's the Celtics fault IT didn't work out with the Cavs? Or is this a meme that's not supposed to be taken seriously and I'm whooshing?"

"Lebron James, Larry Bird, Bill Russell.  LeBron at the point, facilitating for the other two. Bird operating as a secondary creator and elite floor spacer. Russell anchors the defense and serves as an elite pick and roller and post-up option.   The team would have an elite and insanely switchable defense and a versatile offense that can get to the rim, stretch the floor, and has multiple pick and roll otions."
"Bill Russell, LeBron James, Stephen Curry"
lmao i like how you had to throw in the ‚Äúlebron james led‚Äù cavaliers. but didn‚Äôt say a single player from any other team.
"In a similar vein, some of it also has to do with how much teams can get you on a deal too. Teams become elite by acquiring players who produce above average value for what portion of the cap they commit to them (or by finding ways to overpay in excess of the cap).  If you are a player who is worth a max contract but not much more, then teams actually limit themselves a bit by committing that much money to you (even if you are good enough to deserve it). For a championship team, it means they have find ways to get that extra edge elsewhere.  There was an [article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/deal-for-anthony-may-limit-knicks-upside/) on Melo's trade to the Knicks back in 2011 that expressed a similar sentiment. Basically, by most metrics, Melo was definitely worth what his salary was - but not that much more. This makes it hard to build a contender around him because the team paying him needs to get some steals elsewhere with their money to actually come out ahead and be elite.  I think a lot of really good players end up in this situation. Like you said, they have to be ""the guy"" which means to be a contender, they're competing against teams that have LeBron James as ""the guy"". If they aren't providing the excess value someone like LeBron is, their team will struggle to go all the way."
"&gt;the degree of difficulty his shots were  This is the whole problem with Bryant -- the degree of difficulty of shots.  Taking terrible, low-percentage shots does not help your team.  Bryant could've led the league in assists -- like LeBron James did last year -- a bunch of times, if he'd taken advantage of defensive attention by passing the ball, instead of by taking the hardest shot he could think of, for highlight-reel purposes.  And before you respond with a dig at his teammates, I'll note that the only time in history that the Lakers struggled to acquire good players was when Bryant was chucking up the worst shots imaginable, in case one went in.  He literally chased away the best teammate he had, and scared off the rest of candidates, because no one wanted to play with him."
Dude won five championship in a decade. His peek was better than Lebron James'.
LeBron James would never. That‚Äôs why he is the goat
I have to agree here. Zion seems to have ‚Äúmore‚Äù repertoire in his offensive game. What I don‚Äôt understand is why Giannis doesn‚Äôt work on his shot or offensive skill in the off season. Like he plays with Khris Middleton. I don‚Äôt know why he couldn‚Äôt help Giannis with a consistent jumper like Kyle Korver did for Lebron James.

"Stoooop.....   Celtics brought him in, made him a star, built an entire team around him, and when they traded him he was sent to play with LeBron James. Yall act like Danny Ainge went out and took a baseball bat to ITs hips personally. Dude got hurt and hasn't been the same, it happens to lots of players we love. He's a Boston legend that will have his pick of media gigs and endorsements in the city when he retires, and he will never pay for a drink or a meal for the rest of his life anywhere in New England"
He's closer to LeBron James than we are.

"Kevin Durant has played one season of his NBA career without a future, present, or past MVP next to him. That was his rookie season. Since then he's either had Westbrook, Curry, or Harden on his team. When Westbrook was injured in 2013, the KD-led Thunder were up 2-0 on the Rockets in the first round of the playoffs and closed it out 4-2 before losing 1-4 to the Grizzlies the next round.  Title success in the NBA this past decade has been either you have LeBron James, ~~Klay Thompson~~ Steph Curry, or put Kawhi Leonard on a team that could make the conference finals without him."
"&gt;So you're trying to ascribe value to Embiid for the team being worse when he sits - that's not how it works. He gets no credit for those games, his value is zero in each one.   This is one of the dumbest statements about a team game I've ever heard. I guess LeBron James has zero value to the Lakers this season because he's missed games. No. That shows how important a player is to their team. If your record gets 20% worse when a single player sits, they're quite valuable to your team. Moving on.  &gt;Even if Embiid is more valuable per game that he plays, Jokic is still very valuable, and because he plays more games his value will surpass Embiid's.   How? If Jokic wins more games. Sure. If he put up his current stats and goes on a losing streak, then I doubt we'll be having this conversation in a month. Someone else will become the front runner.  &gt;Value over replacement - Jokic is at 5.8, Embiid at 2.7.  &gt;Win shares - Jokic at 10.7, Embiid at 6.2.  I can't believe people still quote these stats. They're next to useless. Do you think Domantas Sabonis is the 19th best player in the league? Do you think Montrezl Harrell is the 10th best player in the league? Also, since we're using WS. Why not use WS/48 where Jokic .300 and Embiid is .295. DRTG where Embiid is third and Jokic isn't top. ORTG, where Jokic is 6th and Embiid is 19th.  You can use crappy stats to favor either side of the argument. Advanced stats in general that aren't player specific(RTG, WS, VORP) are mostly trash. I'm trying to imagine in what world someone would look at VORP and WS and be like Mikal Bridges is better than Jamal Murray."
"LeBron James: Reg. Season 27; Playoffs 28.8  Durant: 27.1 - 29  Kawhi (since 2016): 24.8 - 28.1  Curry: (since 2015): 27.5 - 27.2  Harden is a top 3 player in the regular season and doesn't live up to that in the playoffs. Its not even just about stats, the eye test hasnt been great for him."
I mean I‚Äôd rather have Lebron James in every single year since basically 05 but he didn‚Äôt win MVP every year. That‚Äôs a dumb irrelevant question.

"They didn't called a shit ton of offensive fouls to Lebron, when Grant was always taken down by elbowing by James. Moreover Lebron got a lot of fouls away from the shots, Jokic didn't get that."
"I can think of a player who can play a whole game and not go to the line once. His name is Lebron James. This is the new superstar treatment, get used to it."

"Infamous Jokic haters, the ‚Äúmedia‚Äù lol they cover him plenty. He‚Äôs just obviously not Lebron James or Stephen Curry."
"Everyone is so quick to jump the gun and be worried about losing Tatum and Brown, when they are 23 and 24. Is Miami going to be worried about losing Bam if they lose in the first or second round this year? Is Sacramento worried about losing De'Aaron Fox since he was also just signed to a 5-year max and they can't put help around him? Is Ben Simmons going to demand a trade if they don't make the finals yet again? Same for Donovan Mitchell if the Jazz don't win this year? What about Sabonis or Devin Booker?  All of these guys are the same ages as Tatum/Brown, but I never hear this narrative about them, except maybe Simmons in trade rumors, and they all haven't won a championship yet either.  Everyone said the same thing about Giannis and then he stayed in Milwaukee. I understand where it comes from when it does happen and guys want out, I just don't know what kind of power they have with 3/4 years left on $24M+ deals where any trade to match salary would send them to a bad team or a contender would be losing key pieces to match salary and they'd be in the exact same spot in a different location. Celtics aren't buying them out lol.  They have literally no leverage to demand a trade this offseason and if you make the playoffs 4 years in a row and made it to the ECF in 2/4 of those where you're the main guy(s), why would you want out that bad?  James Harden spent 8 years in Houston. KD spent 9 in OKC. LeBron stuck it out with the Cavs for 7. Paul George in Indiana for 7. AD with the Pelicans for 7. Melo with Denver for 7.5. Lillard has spent his entire career with Portland. Embiid has played 5 season with the Sixers and there's no mention of him jumping ship. Jokic 6 years in Denver and no one is saying he's going to demand a trade. None of these guys won championships with those teams.  Why does everyone act like their window is closed now or very soon after just 4 years when people act like their help (Kemba Walker, 4 time All-Star, coming back from injury/surgery. Marcus Smart, 1st team All Defense, coming back from injury. Evan Fournier, 18 PPG scoring option, 2 games in) is no help at all? This narrative is nonsense."

You can have Lebron James and James Harden too
"&gt;Congrats on personally being part of the reason the Lakers are good. You really worked hard and accomplished a lot! Definitely had nothing to do with star players signing in LA for endorsement reasons- oh wait, that‚Äôs the entire reason the Lakers won last year. It‚Äôs not special or impressive.  Imagine being clueless enough to think that LeBron James, at 34 years old, is chasing endorsement deals.  He was probably going to door-to-door in Cleveland, begging someone to let him do mattress ads, right?  I heard that his kids barely had enough to eat, before he came to the Lakers.  No wait, that's not right, he was already the second-best-paid athlete on the planet in 2017.  The best players actually come to the Lakers because they want to play for the best fans, and that's been happening for well nigh 60 years now."
I feel like he makes at least 1 deep 3 per game. Im starting to feel like his deep 3 games going to become super consistent next year. Dude was trying to be like james harden one year. Then lebron. And now hes trying to be like curry.
Bro he needs to get on the Lebron James million dollar annual health plan ASAP so we can see this for 20 years.
Take out the dude who led us to an improbable Finals run and looked LeBron fucking James eye to eye? Nah...
"I don't there theres any player that I resemble perfectly. I'd say I'm a mix of Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Kareem Abdul Jabbar with Steph Curry's shooting."
"KD would only get the same criticism as Harden got with the rockets, Dame with the Blazers, and etc. I don't see it as anymore than comments you get because you lost. It's still your team at the end of the day. The most who gets scrutiny would be Lebron James and his losses. These superstars like Harden, KD and etc doesnt even come close to the hate he gets."
"we're ""agreeing to disagree"" and then you go editing your comments to add shit after I've replied and are twisting what I said.  I never said Kyrie was a bench player, I said there are many deserving All-NBA candidates at guard so there certainly is a range of outcomes where Kyrie misses, especially if he misses more time.  I also said that having an MVP candidate on your team impacts winning, do you disagree with that?  I'm not even going to start in on the top 15 player &amp; GOAT ball handler, because it's just not true and they don't give out awards for handles (it's Iverson, BTW, and I'd say Curry has just as good if not a better handle than Kyrie).  Enjoy life on the flat earth stanning for the ultimate empty calories player (seriously though, what has Kyrie ever done in the NBA without LeBron James to piggyback off of?)."

The only two years he's played enough games to actually get MVP votes he's played with LeBron James.
Enough to where lumping him with LeBron James and not Harden/WB is laughable.
"Yeah, but what does Redick have to gain from lying? Sympathy points? Nothing else really. It's not like he's LeBron James where he commands a ton of power or clout as a figure. If anything, straight up lies would just make him not worth the hassle to any other front office going forward. This seems like a legit case of feeling like he got lied to with promises being unkept and just venting about it.   As much as some people might not want to admit it, these guys are still human at the end of the day. No one wants to get played. And I would definitely side with the player in this case given the history of various front offices not playing it straight with players and the Pelicans not having anything to gain here by granting Redick his request."
Lebron James had a 47.7% TS in the 2015 NBA FINALS. He got heaps of praise
"&gt; when LBJ was winning MVP's on the Cavs, did they have 'Star power', lol.  Yes, I would consider LeBron James a ‚ÄúStar‚Äù. In fact, he‚Äôs probably worth 1.5 or 2 normal All-Stars."
"Pretty solid list.

"If Lebron James had Jokic numbers this sub would be creaming their pants.   If you haven't noticed, people on reddit aren't the brightest."
"Lebron James is always historically great in the finals, there‚Äôs a reason why he‚Äôs the second greatest player to ever play the game.  This is revisionist history lol.

Cleveland was able to find a way to neutralize Steph and Golden State had no answer for Lebron and Kyrie"
"I'm here to watch my favorite players Lebron James, Donovan Mitchell, Anthony Davis and Mike Conley. Hope it's a good one."
LeBron James with the same qualifier is 18/66 (27%). 23/80 (29%) if you include playoffs.

Lebron James Harden
"See: LeBron James, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant... etc. that‚Äôs the reason you don‚Äôt have as many wins as a lot of those guys, 6th in the east is off one player and a coach who preaches defense until his guys break."
"speaking of lebron, there‚Äôs this:   &gt;[James said he memorized how to each one of his teammates likes to catch passes, from the height of the pass to where the seams line up.](https://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-memorized-how-teammates-like-passes-2016-12)"
"Can‚Äôt speak for KD but Lebron James has consistently over 18 seasons been the most dedicated and consistent athlete on any team he‚Äôs played for, and it‚Äôs not close. Dude doesn‚Äôt rest or recover unless he needs it. If he says he can‚Äôt play I trust him, no one has as close to as many miles on his body  This isn‚Äôt a situation like kawhi where you have a weak bum who just has no heart and doesn‚Äôt wanna play  AD I don‚Äôt know, just seems kinda injury prone"
"That reminds me of that comment by Shump about LeBron James and ""no look"" passes not being no look passes. When the Joker sensed /saw Olynyk in the peripherals had rotated for the double he KNEW an opportunity existed ... and then Jokic-ed the ball to PJ"
not a chance. Harden alone is a better passer and a better scorer. LeBron James is... LeBron.  so nope
"Depends on your qualifications. Do you mean expected combined careers, both players who you think will have a better career than the two of them, or how good the two of them look in the first 2 years.  Regardless, these years had great 1-2 pick combos (multiple all star teams, all defensives, all nba teams, or high scorer like KVH)  1960 Oscar Robertson and Jerry West  1968 Elvin Hayes and Wes Unseld  1981 Mark Aguirre and Isiah Thomas  1982 James Worthy and Terry Cummings (Dominique Wilkins was 3rd) making this a draft where 1-3 made multiple all star games and all nba teams  1992 Shaq and Mourning  1996 Iverson and Marcus Camby   1997 Duncan and Keith Van Horn  1999 Elton Brand and Steve Francis  quite a few busts at #2  Some recent notable 1/2 picks are 2016's Ben Simmons + Brandom Ingram and 2015's Towns and Russell  edit: the best has got to be 1960, then 1992 if we consider that both players need to be fantastic otherwise LeBron and Darko would be fairly high"
"It's not arbitrary. It's commonly used across all NBA media. The same stat for other players has been posted to /r/nba ***hundreds of times***. Mostly coming from ESPN with the same criteria.

To be honest man I don‚Äôt follow the NBA to closely so don‚Äôt take my list as a sure thing but I would say   1. Lebron James  2 Kevin Durant  3. James harden  4. Joel Embiid  5. Nikola Jokic  6. Curry ( I think he is easy too 10 he‚Äôs my favorite player some buddies of mine have said other that‚Äôs why I asked) 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Luke Doncic  9. Kawhi Leonard 10. Anthony Davis
"Getting tired of the MVP being about playing 90% of the games. Come on. It shouldn‚Äôt be about who played the most games. It isn‚Äôt an ironman award. Especially with what sports science has told us the last decade. We are basically expecting players to put their bodies at risk to win MVP. Give it to the most dominant player on a team with a good record. The choice is obvious, even though I hate to see him win it because of rivalry reason.  Lebron James. Period.  I think 2021 MVP and his big face shows up.  He earned it. Hate the guy."
I'm sure he can get a nice loan for a buyout.   Collateral: LeBron James.
"The way I see it, Windy believes himself to be a great basketball analyst. He‚Äôs not, but that‚Äôs what he thinks. As a beat writer for the Akron Beacon Journal he gained exclusive access to LeBron James. Lebron James! So he knows what greatness looks like, as well as anybody. So how could he, an esteemed sports journalist, be wrong about the NBA MVP? This guy Jokic, who is he? His games are always too late in the evening to watch, he‚Äôs rarely on national TV, nobody else at ESPN talked about him until the Clippers blew a 3-1 lead... how could this guy he‚Äôs never paid attention to be this good? If Jokic was this good, this great, to be MVP, Windy would‚Äôve seen it coming. So either Windy isn‚Äôt very good at his job, which can‚Äôt be true, or the other sports analysts are wrong.   It makes him angry that everyone else is wrong. It makes him angry everyone thinks he‚Äôs wrong. And it‚Äôs all Jokic‚Äôs fault."
LeBron James had play  ~20% more minutes then Embiid this season. I don't know why this seems so crazy to me but it does. Lebron feels like he's been gone forever.
&gt; Zach LaVine Says LeBron James Is His Dream Teammate in 'First Take' Interview   -Circa February 2020

I don‚Äôt think even lebron james could stop that duo.
"To be clear, going into last season (the 2019-2020 season) Bontemps had LeBron outside of the 5 best players in the league. He was not giving his rankings for how everyone had played the previous season, it was his prediction for last season. [The reason he gave was LeBron's lack of defense,](https://youtu.be/c6sIz31oGW4?t=164) yet he had James Harden and Steph Curry ranked ahead of him."
Read some articles about LeBron written by Windhorst.  He basically wants to fellate LeBron and will say anything to appease him. Its almost like he works for James himself. He's so fucking lame
"Just curious, where did you get the TS% stat. If you are referencing the MavsMoneyBall article, that thing is 2 months old and was written right when Porzi≈Üƒ£is was coming back from his injury. Prior to that being published, Porzi≈Üƒ£is was averaging 20.5 ppg, 8.2 rpg on 47/35/86 shooting. He was also on a minutes restriction, he was a -3.6 and was also playing alongside G-Leaguers and rookies since the COVID protocols had DFS, JRICH, Maxi, Powell and Brunson all sitting. Since that has been published, KP has averaged 21 PPG and 10.3 RPG on 49/39/83 shooting and is a +6.1.   So naturally KP is going to have worse numbers when Luka sits and he was playing alongside James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, Nate Hinton and Josh Green.   In regards to winning games without Luka, naturally we aren't going to be as good without Luka, same with any team missing their best player. Last year we beat the #1 seed Milwaukee with just Porzi≈Üƒ£is. Donƒçiƒá missed a stretch of games and Dallas went 3-3 including close losses to Miami in OT (eventual EC champions), Boston and Toronto (#2 and #3 seeds). We beat the Spurs, Milwaukee and Philly.   I think you are expecting Dallas to play at the same level when Luka misses games and that's just not realisitc, there's natrually going to be a drop off. Even Porzi≈Üƒ£is playing at his best isn't going to drag a team starting Maxi, Brunson, DFS and Richardson to wins over contenders consistently. That's not possible for any team. Look at the Lakers when LeBron sits and just Davis plays. They are naturally not as good as when LeBron and Davis both play.   I guess I just don't get your point. You say that ""whenever Donciƒá sits, Porzingis is not convincing at being the first guy the opponents guard.""  However stats show Porzi≈Üƒ£is is doing fine when he's the primary option, he's scoring well and rebounding well. Then the argument shifts to well we are 1-4 without Donƒçiƒá. Well obviously that's going to be the case, he's our best player. Those are also games that Porzingis hasn't played either, so it seems completely irrelevant. You go from arguing Porzi≈Üƒ£is isn't a good primary option, to he's good at scoring but he can't lead the team.   The sample size is super small for games with Porzi≈Üƒ£is playing without Luka, but he's been able to step up when Luka has bad games. Just look at the last game against Milwaukee where Porzi≈Üƒ£is stepped up in the 4th quarter and brought us to the finish line."
"The celtics only won 1 ring and made the finals twice in their 5 years. While good, that's not the level of dominance I would associate with the term ""superteam"". By the time Lebron formed his own big 3, the celtics big 3 were already old and past their primes. Paul, Allen, and Garnett were 34,36, and 37 years old respectively in 2011. Ray Allen also pulled a KD and joined that same Miami heat team that won the championship that year.  ""KD joined a 73-9 team"". I heard that old line thousands of times already. That 2015-2016 warriors team was a ""lightning in a bottle"" situation. The factors that allowed that team to exist probably won't ever happen again with the salary cap increasing and a Max player being paid peanuts.   If KD doesn't join the warriors in 2017, the warriors definitely get a lot worse as a team in 2017. The warriors had the best bench in the league in 2016, but a mere 3 years later, they had the worse bench in the league. In 2017, role players on the warriors like Harrison Barnes were demanding Max-level money and if KD doesn't sign, GS probably resigns Barnes. GS was forced to let a lot of their depth walk in free agency. Steph was being horribly underpaid at the time and was eyeing the supermax. Without KD taking paycuts, Iguodala probably also leaves in free agency in 2018. At best, the warriors win 1 more ring in 2017 (I doubt that), the cavs were unstoppable going 12-1 against the east in the playoffs, no way in hell they beat the rockets in 2018, and we already know what happens in 2019.  What tools did KD have to win a championship in OKC? OKC as organization favored Westbrook over KD and allowed him to run rampant as the primary decision maker on that team. Westbrook is a great player, but his high usage rate + inefficiency doesn't lead to playoff success. OKC also made really dumb decisions like signing a person who has never coached in the NBA as their head coach, using big chunks of their salary cap to sign big men that were damn near unplayable in the small ball era, and TRADING JAMES HARDEN for scraps because they didn't want to pay the luxury tax. That last reason alone should be enough."

"Warriors strategy is notoriously centered around Steph but it isn't centered around him taking a billion shots. If anything, it drives me insane how Kerr uses the best shooter of all time to get G-Leaguers open for midrange J's. His stubborn refusal to run P&amp;R is even more baffling to me. They had Steph and KD in their primes for 3 years and they ran P&amp;R with those two guys maybe a handful of times each game. Why? Because of Kerr's stupid insistence on his offensive philosophy. Even in 2019 when it was clear that KD was going to leave, they didn't use it. It doesn't end there, Kerr tried to turn James Wiseman into Andrew Bogut ffs. It's just awful, he's completely stuck in 2015 when they had a bunch of unselfish, high-IQ guys and is just so inflexible it makes my brain hurt. I think you are really overrating Kerr's system. Curry is the system. They look worse when Steph's off the court because he's, statistically, far and away the best at raising his teammates' level of play since they started tracking that stuff, even better than LeBron. I mean the Warriors barely broke .500 when they didn't have Steph in the past; they went 1-8 this year. That's crazy. Yet when they don't have other stars, Steph is still amazing. So all the evidence points to Steph being the cause and not the beneficiary.  &gt; just saying those on/offs just aren't really fair to use because those other guys wouldn't see the same dropoff since the scheme would be going from Curry to Harden, who is arguably better at creating for others.  You could argue he's better at creating for others but all advanced stats show that not only is Steph better at Harden at creating for others, but he's arguably the best ever. When Harden doesn't have the ball, he can't create. When Steph doesn't have the ball, he gets double teamed anyways. If you mean pure creation in terms of having the ball in your hands, then maybe, but the off-ball stuff is just a world of difference."
I agree and if Lebron James has the sniffles at that time they should tack on a few more days so he can come back feeling nice and good. The opposing team should also rub his feet at halftime every game
Assuming everyone is healthy  1. Lebron James 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. James Harden  4. Anthony Davis  5. luka doncic
"In this part of the shit show, Wind says that LeBron was the clear favorite for MVP in their previous strawpoll a few months back with a significant lead in first place votes. Bon says he's wrong, that LeBron wasn't THAT far in the lead, and that it was a legitimate three horse race w/ Jokic Embiid and James.  Right now, Jokic has 90 first place votes out of 100, and Wind brought up LeBron's lead in the same breath. In actuality, the previous poll had James with 54 first place votes, Embiid had 23 first place votes, and Jokic with 18. So, Bontemps was right ... which is understandable since it's HIS POLL"
I am 100% on board for this as I am a believer that Michael Jordan and Lebron James are 2A and 2B when it comes to the GOAT conversation - because the true #1 is Marcus Smart.

"&gt;I‚Äôm not sure which crack den you inhabit and get your information from, but outside of you, the entire world knew that lebron was the best player in the league.  And yet, when 111 of those people voted on MVP each year, James did not even reliably finish in second place.  Hence, my point.  There were a lot of people who did not consider James to be the best player in those seasons, even if they were wrong."
Bronny James is 16.    J.R. Smith is 35.    LeBron is used to this behavior.  It doesn't phase him.  LaDad.
"&gt;And some weird notion that he only is a big-time reporter because of LeBron  Brian Windhorst's sports journalism career started in 2003, covering LeBron James. He wrote a book in 2009, about LeBron James. He left Cleveland in 2010 to work for ESPN in Miami covering LeBron James and the Heat. In 2014, Windhorst left Miami to work for a Cleveland radio station to cover LeBron James and the Cavs. He wrote another book in 2017 about LeBron James. In 2018, he began working in ESPN studios in LA covering LeBron James and the Lakers. In 2019, he wrote another book about LeBron James.   What notable contributions to the sports journalism industry has Windhorst made that don't involve LeBron?  &gt;(yet nobody says the same thing for writers who got famous because of the Steph Warriors).  What writers are you talking about? Strauss? Genuinely have no idea."
Nah. LeBron James.
If your name is not Anthony Davis or Lebron James YOU‚ÄôRE NOT UNTOUCHABLE
"Apperantly I am a cross between Westbrook, Lebron and T-Mac.  Personally I always saw myself as James Harden trapped in Delly's body but with the vertical of Z-bo."
"I legit think Barkley started putting him up there, first just to pick on Shaq, then to try and downplay Lebron, and it just kinda stuck with nephews. He's a legit great player, but he's not in that uppermost tier anymore than Pippen or Ginobli or James Worthy or Kevin McHale"
 Embiid is listed at +200    James at +225.    Jokic +350     That is HARDLY overwhelming.  [https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/\_/id/31038407/joel-embiid-overtakes-lebron-james-favorite-win-mvp](https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/31038407/joel-embiid-overtakes-lebron-james-favorite-win-mvp)
"James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant still play for the Thunder? Lebron still play for the Cavs? Is Anthony Davis on the Pelicans? Kawhi on the Spurs? Paul George on the Pacers, or the Thunder whom he promised to stay for but demanded a trade after 1 year? Hell, Kyrie even forced himself out of Cleveland wanting to be 'the guy' then forced himself out of Boston where he was the guy to go be 3rd fiddle to KD and Harden. I guess they all just proved you wrong.  Giannis is an outlier, and you're trying to paint the picture of the outlier being the norm. Knock it the fuck off, it's embarrassing."
"they didn't hate him.  It was one youtube video that makes it seem like they hated him.    &gt;I went there every LeBron James game his senior year.

Do you really think China was gonna do something against the fucking Lakers and Lebron James?
"True, there's no way the lakers can make the finals with scrubs on their roster like... checks notes, Lebron James and Anthony Davis. Can't possibly mess with the proven championship Celtics core."
"""LeBron James could never induct somebody to the NBA Hall OF Fame the way  Michael Jeffrey Jordan could""     ""STOP IT SKIEEEUP"""
"&gt;LeBron was by FAR the best player in 2018.  Not to MVP voters.  He was 5 years removed from his last one at that point.  &gt;a fucking deity  A ""fucking deity"" doesn't lose 10 playoff games and get swept.  Go back and look at the summer of 2018.  Few people expected the Lakers to contend, and almost no one expected James to ever play at the level he did in the bubble again."
"JJ Reddick is older than LeBron James.   Maybe this one is just me but for the longest time I always felt JJ was young, not 20's young but just getting into his 30's. Nope."
Bruh LeBron James is 100% a better scorer than Kyrie Irving. You can give Kyrie as many gold stars you want for arbitrary categories but a mountain of evidence that spans over a decade points to a very clear answer
"James catches, puts up a three, won‚Äôt go, rebound bosh...  Of course he hit the huge three the previous possession, and more importantly the heat started the 4th quarter down 10 and Lebron scored or assisted on 16 points in like 6 minutes to tie the game while Wade and Bosh were on the bench.  I‚Äôd say he was part of it!"
In the history of the NBA there have only been 6 players who won MVP playing less than 70 games (regardless of season length)  Karl Malone 99 MVP (shortened season) 49/50 games = 98% appearance  Bill Walton 78 MVP 58/82 = 70% appearance  LeBron James 12 MVP (shortened season) 62/66 = 93%   Giannis 20 MVP (shortened season) 63/73 = 86%  Bob Cousy 57 MVP 64/72 = 88%  Bill Russell 58 MVP 69/72 = 95%  The only MVP to play less than 85% of their possible games is Walton basically.
"""And they said LeBron James was the goat.... and I took that personal"""
Lebron James and Anthony Davis are the first duo in NBA History
"No problem.   &gt; Ok so in Russ‚Äô scoring title years, he shot league average percentage. So, isn‚Äôt this an argument for his inclusion on this list?  I'm not sure what you mean here. Let's bear in mind that this is not about whether Russ is a great scorer or not, but about whether he's on the level of Lebron, Steph, KD, Harden, and Giannis, all of whom have had seasons where they were the focal point of the offense and produced a comparable volume of points on much greater efficiency.  &gt; He was likely the focal point of opposing teams‚Äô defensive game planning for a lot of years  All of the players we're comparing to have also been in situations like that, except maybe KD who is an efficiency and scoring god regardless of who's next to him.  &gt; Such as quality of supporting cast, his own selfishness as a teammate, or unimaginative coaching?  Even accounting for these things, Russ had low efficiency. Kobe had a terrible supporting cast during the seasons I previously cited, yet scored at 4% above league average efficiency. Lebron James was the focal point of an early Cavs team with a bad supporting cast, and was still dominating in both efficiency and volume.  And player selfishness that leads them to take bad shots and miss means they are a worse scorer. Shot selection and bball IQ is part of a scorer's skillset, not separate from it.  At a certain point, it doesn't make sense to keep fishing for circumstantial excuses. It comes down to Russ and his playstyle, not any external circumstances. He was simply nowhere near as efficient as the guys we're comparing to, who have all produced a similar volume of ppg at some point. I.e. Russ needs significantly more possessions and attempts to score the same amount of points as these all-time scoring talents, thus he is not *as good* of a scorer, even if he is great."
"The pace of the game, B.  2003 was slowball.  Like crazy slowball.    P100P, Malone avged 30 and 19.  BUT Duncan avged 31 and 17.5.  Malone avged 1.1 and 1.6 per, Duncan avged .9 and 4.0.  Playoff P100P:  Malone 31.9, 19.4, 1.9, 1.8, 2.4  Duncan 30.6, 19.1, 6.6, .8, 4.1  Both historic performances but Duncan's assist and blocks really pop out, esp because his blocks often led to a change of possession rather than just going OOB.  Duncan also has superior BPM, VORP, and *double* the win shares that playoff run -- 2.8 for Malone, *5.9* for Duncan.  5.94 win shares in a playoff run is absolutely ridiculous.  It's the highest ever recorded, with 2012 LeBron James checking in at #2 with 5.82.  There are only *5* playoff runs in history with win shares over 5, and Duncan almost hit 6 that season."
"&gt;who TF thought LeBron was going into semi retirement  That was a very common remark from Laker-haters from July 2, 2018 until October 2020.  They were fond of claiming that the only reason James signed with Los Angeles -- who were not a contender at that time -- was to work on his post-basketball career(s)."
"&gt;lebron was the best player in the league and viewed as such   Rightly or wrongly, James has not won an MVP since 2013, so that's debatable at best.  I think he's the best player in the league, but to claim that he's ""viewed as such"" does not have much support.  &gt;when he left the cavs. He just had an all time dominant playoff run.  The Cavaliers were swept in the Finals, and lost 10 playoff games in total.  While that certainly wasn't James' fault, it's impossible to call that ""all time dominant"" with a straight face.  &gt; Most people had the bucks, clippers, lakers over the nets to start the season.    That's irrelevant, because that was a completely different Brooklyn roster.  &gt;The only reason that AD is in Los Angeles is because he refused to resign anywhere else. If he was traded based on the value of the package, he would be playing in Boston right now.   This is both wrong, and irrelevant.   &gt;Davis, [speaking to reporters](https://twitter.com/TimBontemps/status/1096800664951369733) as part of his All-Star media availability, confirmed the previously reported list of [Milwaukee Bucks](http://bleacherreport.com/milwaukee-bucks), [Los Angeles Lakers](http://bleacherreport.com/los-angeles-lakers), [Los Angeles Clippers](http://bleacherreport.com/los-angeles-clippers) and [New York Knicks](http://bleacherreport.com/new-york-knicks) is ""true."" When asked specifically about the Boston Celtics, though, Davis made it clear they are a contender for his services.   &gt;   &gt;""They [are on my list](https://twitter.com/TimBontemps/status/1096802063315546112)...I never said Boston wasn‚Äôt on my list,"" Davis [told reporters](https://twitter.com/VinceGoodwill/status/1096802751617646594), before repeating the latter sentence when asked for clarification.      &gt;   &gt;""All 29 other teams are on my list,"" Davis later [said](https://twitter.com/NBATV/status/1096810453437538305) on NBATV. ""I don't have a preferred destination. I just want to win. Big market, small market, I don't care. I want to win.""    &gt;   &gt;[https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2821089-anthony-davis-i-never-said-celtics-werent-on-list-of-preferred-trade-spots](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2821089-anthony-davis-i-never-said-celtics-werent-on-list-of-preferred-trade-spots)  &amp;#x200B;  Davis was a Laker in 2020 because they were the only team willing to trade as much as they did for a one-year rental.  Davis is a Laker right now, because they signed him as an unrestricted free agent five months ago.  &gt; Ingram, Zo, hart is a really mediocre group of players  It's not, first of all, and that's less than half of the players involved in that trade, and again, this is utterly beyond irrelevant.  If you want to spout nonsense, do so in another conversation.  Davis was the most expensive single-season rental in NBA history, and maybe in all of sports history.  &gt;, which would make sense because they were the core of a lottery team when combined with lebron.   Your complete ignorance is tiresome.  Everyone on that team except Caldwell-Pope was injured and missed significant time.  &gt; Pelicans got robbed with that package.   Again, Davis was the most expensive rental in NBA history, and by significant margin.  Houston got far less for two years of Harden.  &gt; getting harden for 7 pick package + JA+ Levert isn‚Äôt really that much different   For two years of Harden, which is a completely different story.  And there's no All-star in that package, and no young player who was a #2 overall, and most of those ""picks"" are swap rights that are liable to be worthless.  &gt; The nets took more risk than the lakers   No, they didn't.  The Lakers traded a decade of assets for one season of one player.  The Nets did not.  And even when the Nets did make a trade, they already had two stars signed.  &gt;and ended up with a seemingly better team.   That remains to be seen.  Was not the case a couple nights ago.  &gt;This isn‚Äôt any more unfair than the lakers.   From the perspective of small market teams, signing two marquee free agents is quite demonstrably less fair than a team signing one.  All free agents have to sign somewhere -- exactly like James did -- but they do not have to team up, like Durant and Irving did."
"This story blows my mind and most hardcore NBA fans don't know it   https://youtu.be/-oay7-en5Ow  Jordan before playing in the NBA played for team USA. This team was all college players at the time. Team use played 8 exhibition games against team NBA to get there legs under them. Team NBA had Larry Bird, magic, Isiah, McHale, bill Walton, Danny ainge, Robert parish, James worthy, Clyde Drexler etc etc.. a very very good NBA team   Team USA won all 8 games , game 6 the NBA team were visibly getting annoying and did everything they could to win. Team USA had the best player on the court and mi finished with 27 haha   You had team NBA already calling Jordan one of the best NBA players and the couch Bobby knight calling Jordan the best player in the NBA before he even played a game there. Imagine a player finishing college now and smacking up a team with LeBron, curry, Durant, ad etc for 8 straight games while being the best player on the court, seems nearly impossible for it to happen but that's what Jordan did"
when lebron was drafted Darius Miles was one of those cavs players who welcomed him saying to media that there were already better players than James in Cavs roster.  Just to give the idea.
"They would have to go through lebron james and hes never lost to a non top 5 player in his prime. The heat were an outlier and got waxed in the finals. Its been 17 years since the pistons did it and they had an all time great defense. Its not impossible for them to get there, but like I said its unlikely"
Everything you‚Äôre saying is splitting hairs and downplaying the gravity of signing LeBron James into your organization
"""Its not a debate"" really? There is no argument Lebron James is a better scorer than kyrie, none at all? Christ"
Ah yes his sole playoff series win before linking up with lebron james. And embiid was good in that series

Most buzzer beaters in nba history : Michael Jordan Kobe Bryant Joe Johnson Lebron James Paul Pierce
"The thing with Bosh on that team was there were definitely some diminishing returns offensively playing next to Lebron and Wade. Yeah he spaced the floor well and rebounded but you normally want a guy that big and talented to be close to the basket, except when those post touches are going to Lebron James. It's similar to what happened to Kevin Love in Cleveland who basically became a glorified Ryan Anderson at times. Klay on the other hand is the ultimate plug and play switchable wing. But again I think prime Bosh was a better player individually"
Harden couldn't close the Warriors after KD went down. 2017 I'll give u that one. But by that same token Wade would've had one in 2011 but LeBron didn't step up. Also ur complaining about officiating when ur talking about James Harden? The guy has made more free throws than field goals in his career lmao. Also defensively it's not even close between the two. Harden is an all-time offensive player and SG. But he's not better than Wade
"I know you said so far, so I'm not attacking you or anything, but we gotta stop talking about how good/bad players are who have been to the playoffs like 2-4 times. The sample size is incredibly small. People bring up Ben's playoff history all the time like he's James Harden or some shit, dude has played in four playoff series, let's chill. I've also seen some other young players described as clutch in the playoffs and it boggles my mind. I mean sure they had a good run in the bubble but they're being talked about like they're LeBron.   This is currently Embiid's fifth season, he's been to the playoffs the last three years and will obviously go again this year. Three playoff runs is not nearly enough to be a good or bad playoff performer unless you do something like win a championship."
"It makes little sense at its face. Internal long-term marketing strategy no doubt.

This was also true for the immediately preceding reporting period [during the bubble](https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/2032429)."
You know who‚Äôs playing at Giannis‚Äôs peak? LEBRON JAMES. KD. Steph. Kawhi. Scrubs smh
"And if they had signed like Robin Lopez instead of drafting James Wiseman they'd have a much better record than that.  Doesn't seem like people are appreciating the extra degree of difficulty of winning with a high school center on the roster. None of the recent ""carry jobs"" have had to do anything like that except LeBron who went 28-27 with a lot of young teammates in 2018-2019 in LA (and those guys were a lot more NBA ready than Wiseman)."
*Exactly. Say what you want about LeBron James but he actually puts his money where his mouth is.*      Except for China
LeBron James and Anthony Davis for Luka and salary filler.
Are you crazy? Who‚Äôs the first person the media runs to outside of LeBron James when it comes to social issues? Gregg Popovich. It‚Äôs not because of how he coaches it‚Äôs because he gives good sound bites to use. He is probably known more now for his social takes rather than coaching because since Leonard left the Spurs are irrelevant.
&gt; Say what you want about LeBron James but he actually puts his money where his mouth is.  LeBron refuses to take a public stance on either Hong Kong or vaccines for fear that it'll hurt his bottom line. He hasn't espoused a single public position that would put him at risk of financial losses.
"I think KD Kyrie vs AD LeBron would have been a competitive and exhilarating finals, and I would still have given the nets the edge with Jaret Allen and Spencer Dinwiddie, Caris LaVert  James Harden quitting his way to Brooklyn lopsided the matchup by a mile  &amp;#x200B;  KD doesn't want to compete"
"No one's saying Curry is a non existent playmaker, or questioning his gravity. But with that logic you can make arguments that MJ was a better playmaker than Magic, which is silly.  Here are 2 articles by the most popular NBA journals   1) https://www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2020/6/15/21290999/top-5-nba-playmakers-lebron-james  2) https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2929584-who-are-the-nbas-best-playmakers-right-now.amp.html  Not everyone is crazy that they don't have Curry in their top 5 playmakers. Curry is a very good playmaker but he's not an all-time passing threat."
"You can take it a step further - historically if you don't finish at least 2 seed, you aren't going to be MVP. In the last twenty years only Steve Nash in 2006 won as a 3rd seed. 14/20 MVPs have been top seed, 4/20 have been second seeds (Lebron, Durant, Nash, Duncan), 1/20 has been 3rd seed (Nash), and then Westbrook won.  That said, this year's admittedly weird - Jazz, Suns, and Clippers don't REALLY have an MVP candidate. No one wants to vote for James Harden. Embiid has missed a lot of games, and no one wants to vote for Giannis again."
Oscars Robertson- 131-50(72%)  Magic Johnson- 108-30(78%)  Jason Kidd- 76-31(71%)  LeBron James- 76-23(77%)  Wilt Chamberlain- 69-9(88%)  Russell wins 75% of his Triple-double games which is similar to the rest of them(Wilt being the exception)

"Last year when fully healthy in the first and second round you guys looked unbeatable, then the Hayward and Kemba injuries happened, and 3 out of the 4 Heat games were lost by only 3+ points.    The year before that was the Kyrie debacle, and the years before that you ran into Lebron James with injuries to the team. I don't blame Brad. I blame Lebron James and injuries"
"I have an issue with calling Luka the future GOAT because I consider GOATs to be elite on both ends. LeBron and Jordan are both two of the best scorers in NBA history while being All-Defensive Team members. The fact that Lukas a polished player combined with the fact that I never see him becoming an elite defender make me hesitant to call him future GOAT. I still think he‚Äôs definitely going to be a Hall of Famer, but he‚Äôs going to be more comparable to Chris Paul or James Harden all-time rather than LeBron and Jordan. And that‚Äôs still great company to be in"
and the Celtics have been ravaged by fluke injuries and still made it to the ECF's while facing Lebron James one of the greatest players of all time
"&gt;Since Lebron James left 6 years ago, the Miami Heat and Spoelstra have only made the playoffs three times. One second round lose, one first round lose, and last years lose in the finals  Lets just ignore the fact that they were paying Chris Bosh a max deal for multiple years while he was out with blood clots. Spoelstra should have simply coached harder while they were the only team using 25% of their cap on a player who could not play."
"It‚Äôs stupid cause when James Harden averages 40ppg he gets immediate comparisons to Jordan and Kobe as a SG  But Curry doesn‚Äôt get those comparisons to other all time PGs like Magic or Stockton, even when I‚Äôd take him over those PGs  Between him and Magic it‚Äôs debatable, but since Lebron exist I‚Äôd take him at my SF position and have Curry as my PG on a all time team"

"If u only look at box score stats and never watch the game then sure ur right. In Steph currys 2016 MVP year, he was an equal tier of playmaker to TJ McConnell (both 6.6 APG). In lebron James 2013 MVP season, he was obviously a worse playmaker than Jeff Teague  (6.7 APG to 6.3). You‚Äôve obviously cracked a secret of basketball no one else ever has"
The best 3 players in the NBA are a 6‚Äô2‚Äù pg with unlimited range. A 6‚Äô10‚Äù center that runs the offense from the top of the key and lebron James who is somewhere between them. Crazy how the NBA be. Also I‚Äôll fight anyone that says these 3 couldn‚Äôt play in any generation.
"Lebron ""Hurt his feelings"" James"
"That was the luckiest shot I have ever seen, the guy is a horrendously bad 3 point shooter shooting 30.1% during the regular season. He's also a very poor free throw shooter, not as quite as bad as Lebron James but he's getting there.   - Skip Bayless Probably"
"&gt; When people see 77, they will remember Luka.  They absolutely will not. I've followed the NBA daily throughout Luka's career and had no recollection of his number. 77 is an ugly number.  &gt;Ain't nobody remembers 23 as Draymond Green.  No because Michael Jordan and Lebron James fucking wore it. Is that a serious example?"
"&gt;Your argument about minutes was an argument about the intensity of the game for players today, wasn't it? Because everything you said to elaborate on that point was about the intensity of NBA play.  Quantity and intensity of minutes are two separate issues.  I did not discuss the latter at all, except to point out that the pace has slowed.  &gt; Data? No. I don't even know what data you would use to prove that.    Well then I have to suggest you not write things like ""(1) because conditioning is objectively, provably better..."" when nothing could be further from the truth.  &gt;But we know what daily life and in-season preparation looked like for players then and can easily conclude that it would lead to worse conditioning than what that looks like today...   We can assume that, but that's wildly different from it being objectively provable.  Are some players today in spectacular condition?  Yes, of course.  Are some not?  Yes, as well.  Do players lift more weights today and carry more muscle mass?  Definitely yes.  Is that better ""conditioning"" for basketball?  Maybe, maybe not.  The point being, the question ""Is the median player today in significantly better basketball condition than 50 years ago?"" does not have an easy answer, and is far from objectively provable.  &gt;We know that players didn't dedicate themselves to basketball year round because their salaries didn't allow them to.   On the other hand, they needed to stay in shape to literally feed their families.  Today even a rookie contract feels like 'set for life' money to most.  Are some players more motivated by huge paychecks?  Yes.  Are some players less motivated after the first couple checks clear?  Yes as well.  &gt; We know that certain technologies and medical practices that extend the careers of players today didn't exist. Even as recently as a few decades ago injuries that today might not even be season ending would be career ending.   That's true, but I'm didn't take issue with the medical science part.  &gt; If you don't believe that working out 10 months out of the year with the most highly trained experts in the world and a near infinite amount money to spend has led to better conditioning, I really don't know what to tell you.   You're assuming that everyone is LeBron James.  They are not.  Some are Marc Gasol and Andre Drummond."
"Yep, it's in the CBA that you can't sign a guy to a 4 or 5 year deal that extends past age 38 (the over-38 rule). So I guess they're limited to 3 year deals or under. It used to be 36 but they just changed it.  https://www.insider.com/lebron-james-contracts-limited-by-obscure-nba-age-rule-2020-12"
That‚Äôs not relevant to my comment at all ‚Äúm8‚Äù because how do people idolize Lebron James but hate black people? That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm referring to. M8
LeBron James. I think people really understate how wide the GOAT gap is.
LeBron James and Stephen Curry are two on the top of my head right now. Their crazy shots never fail to amaze me.
"Michael ""Jordan-Kareem-Lebron"" James"
Look at what playing on a LeBron James team does to people.
Mike ‚ÄúJordan Lebron‚Äù James does have a nice running hook.  Reminds me of Magic‚Äôs more though.
Can't believe we got michael jordan + lebron james + kareem in one player
"I too, would put my money on a team that has LeBron James and Anthony Davis"
"I suggest you to just follow the best player, Lebron James, that's what I did years ago. Right now he's injured, so you can watch some other superstar like Curry, Irving or Doncic. Their playstyle is marvelous, it WILL be fun to watch!"
"They absolutely 100% were a super team... they had 3 all stars and practically the deepest bench in the league and went to back to back finals winning one of them and only losing the second because they played a historically great Lebron James led team. They were a homegrown super team, but a super team nonetheless."
"Bruh Jokic is great, but I wouldn't put him here for a few reasons. (and this is also the argument for why Hakeem should be there instead.  \#1: **He's just not as good as the best centers of all time.**  Hakeem Olajuwon (when at his best) is the greatest center of all time for my money. He carried two EXTREMELY mediocre teams to back-to-back titles. Wilt was mind-numbingly athletic, and Bill Russel has a case for the greatest defensive player ever (consider fit with this lineup).  \#2: **He is a playmaking/offensive specialist.**  His playmaking really loses value when you also have LeBron James and Stephen Curry in your lineup. His greatest value is on the offensive side of the ball, where MJ is the best ever, and Steph + KD are right on his heels.  \#3: **His defense does not come even close to stacking up to Hakeem.**  I will say that his defense is actually criminally underrated, as he's a very smart and talented defensive player. However, being above average, is not peak Hakeem (arguably the GOAT defender).  Jokic is the only guy here who hasn't played in multiple finals and won championships. Yes he's **capable** of being the best player on a championship team, but all these other guys have **been** the greatest player on a championship team multiple times.  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: Oh fuck it's the best offensive lineup, and I can't read."
"Lol why are you limiting historic to the past three seasons??   This year Lamelo has been:  1.	‚Å†The youngest player to record a triple double. 2.	‚Å†The youngest player to make 7 threes in a game. 3.	‚Å†One of three rookies to make 7 threes and dish 10 assists in a game 4.	‚Å†Only rookie in the last 60 years to lead all rookies in points, rebounds, assists, and steals heading into the all-star break. 5.	‚Å†One of three NBA players age 20 or younger to have multiple 20/10/5 games (the other two being Lebron James and Luka Doncic). 6.	‚Å†One of three rookies to record 7 threes and 10 assists in a game (the other two being Steph Curry and Jason Kid). 7.	‚Å†One of two rookies to average 15/5/5 and 2 threes (the other rookie being Luka Doncic). 8.	‚Å†Per 36, one of two rookies to post 18/6/6 for a season (the other being a Oscar Robertson; less impressive if he doesn‚Äôt play again this year).  That is literally the definition of historic my guy lmfao.   [This article does a pretty good job putting his season into perspective](https://www.google.com/amp/s/fansided.com/2021/03/03/nylon-calculus-comparing-lamelo-ball-greatest-nba-rookies-ever/amp/)  I know u want your guy to win but saying Lamelo wasn‚Äôt having a historic season? Come on now lol"
"Look man there were three guys in this race all season. Two of them missed (or are still missing) considerable time due to injury. Once Embiid and James went down Nuggets fans (not saying you, cause I'm not about to do that whole ""you speak for every dude in your fanbase and every dude in your fanbase has one mind and one opinion"" thing that is done on this sub) immediately and correctly pointed out that because of this Jokic will win the MVP.   He's winning it, you can believe if these guys never got hurt he would still win it, that's your choice. I don't believe that, but it makes so little difference it's not worth debating. The thing that matters is he will win. It doesn't matter what LeBron, Embiid, or even Jokic do at this point it's already over.   If you're a Nuggets/Jokic fan congratulations and I hope to see you in the Finals."
"People do say the Thunder may have won in a rematch all the time?? The Rockets and Harden never had a 3-1 lead over the Dubs idk where you got that.  The 2020 Heat are worse than that team, just by virtue of having LeBron James.  The 2018 Cavs is debateable considering the argument is just a better LeBron.   2019 Warriors is arguable, the Cavs had the way better depth. The Warriors were starting or playing guys that would be out of the league or end-of-bench players the following year in huge minutes (Livingston, Bogut, Boogie, Cook, McKinnie, etc.). They also were missing Klay for 1.25 games."
"Lol that dude is trolling you. Most people would say the GOAT is Michael Jordan. Some would say it's Lebron James.   Other players come up sometimes, but not as much as those 2.  Edit: if you don't know what team to support. The Sixers are pretty cool (no bias)"
"Back in 2007, Delonte West and his son, LeBron James led the Cavs to the NBA Finals. I bet delonte was very proud of his son."
"""I watch him work out before every single game. I know Carmelo Anthony, Lebron James, and Dwayne Wade are going to be great, but I'm going to go out on a limb and tell you this kid is going to be a special player."" -Doc Rivers on Darko during game 3 of the Pistons Finals back when he was a commentator for a year."

"&gt;""I got to this point by playing this game a certain way, (I'm) getting back to loving the game and having fun with the game,"" James said in an interview with ESPN's Rachel Nichols.  &gt; ""I play the game fun, joyful, and I let my game do all of the talking and I got away from that. That's what I lost last year. Going through my first seven years in the NBA I was always the ""liked one"" and to be on the other side -- they call it the dark side or the villain or whatever they call it -- it was definitely challenging for myself. It was a situation I had never been in before, and it took awhile ... it took a long time to adjust to it.""  &gt; The first six weeks or so he was in Miami, James was a shell of his normal self. The booing was part of it. The jabs his peers were taking at him were a part of it. The expectations were a part of it. Living in a different place for the first time in his life was part of it, too.  &gt; ""It basically turned me into somebody I wasn't,"" James said. ""You start to hear 'the villain,' now you have to be the villain, you know, and I started to buy into it. I started to play the game of basketball at a level, or at a mind state that I've never played at before ... meaning, angry. And that's mentally. That's not the way I play the game of basketball.""  &gt; It was a pure coping mechanism. He tried to stick with it for a while, tried to force himself into acceptance. It didn't last. James soon stopped answering questions about this newly declared role and within a few weeks had abandoned the position altogether.  &gt; But worrying about playing a role the fans want has lost some importance for James. He'd still love to recapture the cheers that used to greet him at nearly every stop. He's been explaining and apologizing for ""The Decision"" show for months now.  &gt; Here's the latest: ""The fact of having the whole TV special and people getting the opportunity to watch me make a decision on where I'm going to play, I would probably change that. Because I can see now if the shoe was on the other foot and I was a fan and I was very passionate about one player and he decided to leave, you know, I would be upset too by the way that he handled it.""  In his own words. [Lebron did very poorly in the ""villain"" role.](https://www.espn.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/story/_/id/7322299/lebron-james-miami-heat-says-done-villain-role)"
"I'd be mad because Steve Nash didn't deserve the MVP at all. Let alone 2 of them. He is not in the top 50 players of all time.  Let's look at who has won the MVP 2 (or more) times and see if they are top 50 players of all time:  Giannis (Time will tell, still early)  Steph Curry (Yes)  Lebron James (yes)  Tim Duncan (Yes)  Karl Malone (Yes)   Michael Jordan (Yes)  Magic Johnson (yes)  Larry Bird (yes)  Moses Malone (yes)  Kareem (Yes)  Wilt Chamberlain (Yes)  Bill Russell (Yes)  Bob Pettit (???)    So aside from Bob Pettit and Giannis (still early) every one who has won 2x MVP are top 50 players all time."
"The TWolves have made the playoffs once since Kevin Garnett, when Jimmy dragged em.  When they played the Rockets in the first round, Jimmy was the best player on the Wolves, not KAT.  When the Embiid/Simmons Sixers made their best run and barely lost to the Raptors, Jimmy was the best Sixer.  The Heat were a 5 seed last year, they beat teams with much more talent because of Jimmy, and the only way they stopped him from dragging one of the most mediocre finals rosters ever to a chip with the 2nd and 3rd best players injured was because there was a LeBron on the other side.  He played up to LeBron James level, stole 2 wins, and was damn near as good at LBJ that series.  This narrative around championships defining a winning player is stupid as fuck.  Jimmy not happening to have the right teammates and never joining a super team is why he doesn‚Äôt have a championship, not because he doesn‚Äôt ball the fuck out in big games and compete with the best ever."
LeBron James flowchart as to whether he should speak his mind...   - is it basketball related?  Yes? Then yes. No? Then no.
I'm gonna try to say this without too much sass: the worst version of Lebron James is better at almost all aspects of basketball than current Ben Simmons.
The Hawks don't have Lebron James...
"Well for one how bout the fact he's played 22 games in a 72 game season. There was a lot of talk about Davis carrying the Lakers to allow Lebron to rest and it turned out the exact opposite.  He came into the year with him and Vogel saying he was going to bring his 3pt attempts up to around 6, he's at 2.5 per game at a pretty much career low .293 excluding years he really didn't shoot any. By all metrics he's had a pretty shitty year with numerous games where he's been outplayed by mid level guys even in wins. If he hadn't won a chip and his name was Paul George or James Harden he'd be getting absolutely killed in the media.  He's just ruined my fantasy team and made me further consider why I even play it every year."
"I'm definitely of the unpopular opinion but I don't think either of them should have been MVP.  But then again I think we place too much value on winning in the MVP discussion.  KG, Dirk, Tim Duncan and LeBron James were all more valuable.  KG led the league in rebounds, led his team in 4/5 categories, led the league in PER, BPM, VORP, win shares, tied in win shares per 48, and if you take him off that squad they're a lottery team.  Shaq can get the fuck out with his saltiness about the MVP that year.  Amare Stoudamire had a better season than he did.  He wanted credit for ""turning around"" the Heat and increasing their win total.  Well Nash did the same but better with the Suns, and DWade coming into his own did half of the work for Shaq.  Shaq didn't have the statistics, the narrative, the wins, there's just no real justification for him except that he had the second best narrative with the whole ""winning without Kobe"" bullshit.  He literally found himself the best Kobe substitute in the NBA.  Not taking away from Shaq's prime.  He might have been the most dominant force in NBA history for a few years there.  He phoned it in regular season and still dominated, and in the playoffs he just couldn't be stopped.  But someone needs to shut him down on his MVP whining.  If he wanted to win MVPs, a regular season award, maybe he should have tried during the regular season instead of playing himself into shape for half the season every year."
"At the very least, Lebron James is a decent human being and I think Klutch will look after his family financially. It doesn't help them with the loss of their teenage son/brother/grandson/nephew/friend, but it's something."
"I can only make it down to 10.  Who's tradeable among:  Curry  Lebron  Anthony Davis  Giannis  Lillard  Jokic  Durant  Doncic  Embiid  Kevin ""James Harden"" Porter Jr."
"The NBA is better off when LeBron James only talks about the Lakers.   Honestly sick of his social justice comments, his Antisemitic comments, his horrible take on Morey's ""Free Hong Kong"" controversy, his tampering comments, his comments about players under contract with other teams but are Klutch clients and his general foot in mouth approach.   You would think after The Decision, he'd see the damage his mouth does,  but no, he just doubles down and keeps doing anything possible to make everything all about him."
A pretty ridiculous courtesy for a sub 70% FT shooter. Bet your ass it wouldn‚Äôt fly with any other player in the league outside of maybe Lebron James.
"I got you. I‚Äôll go by the positions they are playing this year.   PG: Stephen Curry, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Damian Lillard, CP3  SG: Paul George, Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell   SF: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Julius Randle   C: Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, KAT   Top 10 in order:  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Stephen Curry  5. James Harden  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Nikola Jokic   8. Luka Doncic   9. Anthony Davis   10. Damian Lillard"
"After LeBron James, Rajon Rondo, Danny Green, and Jared Dudley made the 2020 NBA Finals the streak reached its 37th year."
"The obviously wouldn‚Äôt unless Lebron signed off on it. He‚Äôs Lebron James, and though he wasn‚Äôt there long, he LeGMed getting Anthony Davis to join and then won a title, and is poised to do it again this year. Spurs also wouldn‚Äôt have ever traded Duncan, or Mavs with Dirk, unless those players specifically signed off on it."
Fuck Lebron James.
"There is a reason he prefers Khris. When everyone talks about GOAT conversations between James and Jordan, everyone thinks it is about that scrub LeBron. ^(/s)"
"Lebron not sticking by what he said? He said ""You're next!"" Regarding the Columbus cop. I want a long and detailed conversation from Lebron James explaining what he was looking to achieve with that tweet. He wanted to be involved and he is now."
https://www.polygon.com/2013/9/13/4724598/nba-2k14-lebron-james-path-to-greatness-mode-preview
the most important factor here is LeBron James.
"By most accounts, LeBron planned on going to the Knicks in 2010 but Dolan was just too big of a fucking weasle/moron and didn't even have a presentation planned when James' visited the facilities."
Lebron James wanted so desperately to team up with AD. That says all you need to know.        KD considers him the most talented big man ever.        Random redditors dont know more about basketball than these two
As a Lebron Sexual I always have to remember 2 things. 1.) Jordan Fans 2.) Him daddy dicking the East and sending everyone packing from the west lmfao. LeThanos is real! When Harden high tailed it out and sloppily forced his way out to Brooklyn... I became fully aware of how terrified dudes are of him. It has to be emasculating. I have no doubt Way Off P is kinda glad he wasn‚Äôt beat by Lebron again. If Lebron wins 2 more... the pure undiluted hate that will spew out of people‚Äôs mouths constantly is going to be hilarious. 7 chips.... boy. They might let him into the hall of fame early lmfao. We will have a new black Jesus. Then if his kids are even half the player their daddy is... you will never stop hearing the name James as long as you live basketball lmfao.
"There is just about nothing LeBron James could do to lose endorsements, get real."

LeBron James is a racist
The whole fucking league is. Our entire country is. This isn‚Äôt limited to Lebron James.
"If your MVP:  -Played less games than LeBron James, who's been injured for a month  -Can't hit full court buzzer beaters (Jokic def would've hit that SMH LeEmbiid)  -Has a better supporting cast than almost every other MVP candidate  -Went through a Mickey Mouse rebuild   Your MVP is Joel Embiid"
"Yeah Duncan Robinson, Miami Heat shooter as well as Lebron James PR agent..."
"[Remember back when the big rumor about Lebron signing with the knicks, the he ended up singing with Miami](https://www.insider.com/lebron-james-new-york-knicks-instead-of-miami-heat-2010-2020-6)"
Chris Paul &gt; Nikola Jokic &gt; Westbrook &gt; Trae Young(never watched) = Ben Simmons(never watched) = LaMelo(never watched) &gt; Lebron James.
"&gt;how many run ins with police has Lebron James had where he‚Äôs treated as a second class citizen?  I have no clue but if we are comparing to Lohan, I will give Lebron more credibility on this topic. I get the wider point you are making though."
1. Dion Waiters  2. Lebron James  3. Luke Walton   4. Shaq  5. Dennis Rodman  6. Yao Ming  7. Wally Szczerbiak  8. Austin Rivers  9. Drew Gooden  10. Michael Jordan
And that kid? He grew up to become none other than Lebron James
Lebron James in that Powerade commercial
"I mean... sure, but how many run ins with police has Lebron James had where he‚Äôs treated as a second class citizen? I‚Äôm not saying it never happened, but it would‚Äôve had to have been before he turned 14, because I doubt there was a single cop in Akron who wasn‚Äôt aware of this dude by high school."
"LeBron playoff averages: 28/9/7 with 1.7 steals and 1.0 blocks  MJ Playoff averages: 33/6/5 with 2.1 steals and 0.9 blocks  MJ has *5* more ppg and is better on defense in the playoffs while LeBron is a better playmaker and rebounder. Michael Jordan has better playoff numbers overall than LeBron James.  And sorry, but LeBron has been on way too many stacked teams to not have as many championships as MJ now. Keep in mind, he has a whole *2* less championships.   MJ &gt; LeBron"
"Has it really though...the NBA knows it went through some dark times in the 70s and 80s.  Basically you had players hitting the league who from a urban under-class that has experienced massive job loss and deindustrialization.  It was a heavy shift in terms the culture of the league. Combine that with the rise of drug culture/violence in many large American cities.  I don't think the NBA ever ran away from that. Its just that more NBA players are like Magic Johnson, middle class, living in middle class conditions versus Allen Iverson.  More guys are like Dwade, not LeBron James."
"Too bad basketball isn‚Äôt played on an excel spreadsheet.  Riddle me this: if say, next year, Lebron, KD, Steph, Kawhi, Jokic, Embiid, and James Harden decide to team up and play on the same team (obviously I know it‚Äôs impossible but humor the hypothetical), and James Harden puts up great stats and leads the league in PER and in WS/48, in your eyes does he deserve the MVP?    Even if his co stars are all MVP type players in their own capacity?  It‚Äôs clear what the answer is."
"oh i agree. one plays with guys like lebron james, kevin durant, james harden, etc. the other.. doesnt.  trapping kyrie in those cases just doesnt make sense."
"Thats kind of unfair, the man literally opened a school in Ohio that promises university tuition for graduates.

"Lebron ""I do my homework"" James"
"Ah yes, LeBron James. The man who Reddit devoutly stood behind during his Hong Kong comments."
"I've been saying for a while now, the only social cause LeBron James supports is his own pocket book."
"There absolutely are grounds to sue though, which is why people are shitting on you. LeBron James is a public figure who posted a picture of another person with a threatening caption. That is absolutely grounds for a lawsuit. It might not win, but it's a legitimate case either way. He threatened that man's life, whether he meant to or not."
I don't know what's harder to defend. The Spurs completely giving up after halftime or lebron james threatening a police officer for saving a woman from being stabbed. I don't even know why I watch this team lose.
" ""I'm so damn tired of officers saving children from being stabbed with a butcher knife"" - lebron james"
"LeBron James is an idiot. Take his God given size/athleticism from him and he's your run of the mill moron that posts to social media. The first problem is those gifts give him a huge platform to speak from. The second problem is that too many people will listen to an idiot because said idiot is famous. That's how you get the society we currently live in where its difficult to determine right from wrong. Trust God, not celebrities."
Lebron James is such a dooshbag. I would sue the piss out of him if I was that officer. Who‚Äôs a hero by the way.
Lebron James is a phony piece of shit.
"LeBron ""I speak when it's easy but oopsie"" James."
"People are fallible and especially emotional about police brutality. I'm sure 90% of people reacted before watching the video. LeBron James isn't any different. I realize he's held to higher standard, but it shouldn't be surprising he'd tweet this. Glad he at least deleted. Be nice if he'd address the mistake."
Can the Police Officer sue Lebron James now?
"Oh we would be hearing about it for sure.  ""So this racist police officer who was sworn to protect and serve let this beautiful black queen get stabbed! Man, I am so upset right now!!! Why does this keep happening to us? But don't worry, we won't stop fighting and will hold them ACCOUNTABLE."" #striveforgreatness #zerodarkthirty #BLM #LobosTequila  -LeBron James"
Fuck Lebron James. I hope this makes people realize how uninformed he really is. What a clown
"‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get into a word or sentence feud with Lebron James, but I believe he wasn‚Äôt educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke, and so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically. Emotionally. Spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say, and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too"
"He spent more time tweeting about this shit than actually watching the video in which he would have realized that the police officer legitimately stopped a girl from getting stabbed. People are saying that the girl who had the knife was defending herself. Uhm, police officers are at the scene. You have zero reason to be lunging at someone with a knife once police officers show up. People need to call LeBron James out for this bullshit."
"Lebron said Curry is the MVP in 2016.  &gt;‚ÄúLook at Steph‚Äôs numbers,‚Äù James said. ‚ÄúHe averaged 30, he led the league in steals, he was 90-50-40 [shooting percentages from the free throw line, field and three-pointers], and they won 73 [games].

I‚Äôm not angry. Nobody should. This person was about to stab someone. That‚Äôs what happens when cops see someone about to try to kill someone.   If you‚Äôre angry be angry that this kid didn‚Äôt put the knife down when the cops got there. Be angry that many people don‚Äôt listen or respect cops.   Be angry that a police officer did the right thing and is being called horrible names on Twitter and has someone like LeBron James spreading stupidity to 60 million people.   It‚Äôs tragic a kid dies like that. No doubt. Nobody wants that. But you play stupid games you win stupid prizes and this needs to be a teaching moment for others.
"&gt;Black on black crime isn't even a blip on his radar.  What kind of bullshit is this? How are you even upvoted? Here's about 1 minute of research with some examples refuting this:  1  &gt;Lebron‚Äôs Foundation began the After-School All-Stars for the children of his hometown, Akron. The Foundation has raised money and donated to the charity for many years. It began as a bike-a-thon, ‚ÄúWheels For Education‚Äù to raise money for children in Akron to have help with education and a place to go after school. It developed into a program to help ‚Äúat risk‚Äù children of Akron in a variety of ways. The program provides mentoring and help with education as well as extracurricular activities. The goal is to keep kids in school and encourage them to graduate. It begins in the third grade when students need to reach state standards to move up to the fourth grade.  &gt;The program provides reading and math help for children who need the mentoring and discourages them from dropping out of school before graduating. Overall, Lebron‚Äôs Foundation has raised over $40 million for the program. Recently, Lebon teamed with the University of Akron to provide scholarships. The children must participate in the program and parents are encouraged to participate. Lebron is very involved with the program. When he cannot be there, he connects with the children via social media. The program currently sponsors over 800 children. The first graduating class will be in 2021. The scholarship covers $9500 annual college tuition for each student. Lebron hopes to extend the program throughout the state of Ohio.  2  &gt;Lebron James designated $2.5 million of the proceeds from ESPN‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Decision‚Äù special to Boys and Girls Clubs of America. While in Miami, Lebron was very involved in Miami‚Äôs club. The club helps give all children equal opportunities and provides after school mentoring and activities. Lebron and his wife designed and donated furniture to the Miami club through Home Court Furniture. They replaced the roof and fixed up the children‚Äôs work space. They donated 1000 new computers to 59 Boys and Girls Clubs throughout America.  3  &gt;The Children‚Äôs Defense Fund started in 1973. Its purpose is to be a voice for children‚Äôs rights and make sure that all children are treated equally and fairly. Lebron James‚Äô Foundation is a major contributor to the non profit organization. As with the After-School All-Stars, the program focuses on ‚Äúat risk‚Äù children who come from poor backgrounds and helps these children complete their education.  4  &gt;ONEXONE also focuses on the support of children. Their mission includes taking care of children by helping them with the 5 pillars: hunger, health, education, water and play. Like After-School All-Stars, the organization uses donations to provide help to those children who need it and encourages them by giving them hope and a sense of pride. The program provides healthy breakfasts in schools, water, medical help, educational help and after school activities. As with most of Lebron‚Äôs charitable causes, he especially gives back to the children. His Foundation is a major donator to ONEXONE. Clearly, Lebron James never forgot the humble beginnings he came from. Without the help and encouragement of mentors like his mother and the Waller family, Lebron may not have had the opportunity to achieve the success he has. His talent as a basketball player and his humanitarian spirit have inspired Lebron to give back. He never let his ego get in the way of giving back to those who inspired him and to the children.  Eternally sick of the deflection to ""well you don't care about black on black crime so your opinion on *x* issue is hypocritical.""  Y'all fail to understand that at least half the black folk you throw that bullshit excuse on, especially when it comes to professional sports players, literally lived in the environments you're claiming they don't care about, and constantly donate money/start orgs to help improve them. Then again, you don't actually care about those issues so it makes sense that you only bust it out when it's convenient for your shitty arguments."
"&gt;I really hope that police officer files a civil suit against James for defamation.  &gt;This is pretty much a legal homerun as LeBron posted his face for his 50 million followers to ""hold him accountable"", advocating for mob rule, even though a justice system exists and he is INNOCENT until PROVEN GUILTY in a court of law.  &gt;This could easily affect his ability to gain employment in the future, should he no longer desire to remain on the force, or cause him to encounter a violent confrontation (in which case there would be very strong grounds for a CRIMINAL suit as well).   lol, this subreddit is hilarious."
Can you show me a comment saying Lebron wants this cop dead?  It's also obvious that LeBron James didn't watch the video since he deleted the tweet.

LeBron James is an ignorant piece of shit.
"During the span of games that Noah or Boozer were out, the Bulls still outscored opponents with Rose on the bench (try again)  Edit: 2011 Hollinger article - ‚ÄúAnd finally, there's the idea of his indispensability -- it's the ""they're nothing without him"" approach. If that's the case, the Bulls should perform much worse when he's off the court than they do. Certainly, it's the case with most other stars. The Heat are 10.49 points per 100 possessions worse without LeBron James this season; the Mavs, 16.68 points worse without Dirk Nowitzki; the Magic, 6.95 worse without Howard, and the Lakers, 6.20 worse without Bryant.  Rose's Bulls? They lose just 1.49 points per 100 possessions. When he's off the court, they still outscore opponents by 6.78 per 100, which roughly translates to a 55-win team.‚Äù"
"It would be quite meaningful for him to apologize. And he absolutely should. And I expect him to.  Or man, maybe LeBron James just doesn't care deeply about Hong Kong. And that is probably compounded by the fact that he faces business pressure to not talk bout China and he makes lots of money from China. There is certainly some rationalization going on.  Whataboutism is not a strong argument. Nobody could get anything done if they had to care equally about every tragedy.  Though his most recent tweets are better, but not great."
"Pretty sure that LeBron James has lived in the real world. I am pretty sure he was relatively poor growing up and raised by a single mother.  Im not saying he is perfect, and he clearly got this wrong, but he wasnt born with a silver spoon in his mouth."
How about he talks about how Lebron James stood quiet about the European Super League

"An American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Widely considered one of the greatest NBA players in history, James is frequently compared to Michael Jordan in debates over the greatest basketball player of all time. Playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers, Miami Heat, and Los Angeles Lakers, James is the only player in NBA history to have won NBA championships with three franchises as Finals MVP. He has competed in ten NBA Finals, including eight consecutive with the Heat and Cavaliers from 2011 through 2018. His accomplishments include four NBA championships, four NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, four Finals MVP Awards, and two Olympic gold medals. During his 17-year career, James holds the record for all-time playoffs points, is third in all-time points, and eighth in career assists. James has been selected to the All-NBA First Team a record 13 times, made the All-Defensive First Team five times, and has been named an All-Star 17 times, including three All-Star MVP selections.  James played basketball for St. Vincent‚ÄìSt. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, where he was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar. A prep-to-pro, he was selected by Cleveland with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2003‚Äì04 NBA Rookie of the Year, he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, winning the NBA MVP Award in 2009 and 2010. After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 to sign as a free agent with Miami. This move was announced in an ESPN special titled The Decision, and is one of the most controversial free agent decisions in sports history.  James won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these years, he also earned league MVP and Finals MVP. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract to re-sign with the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals by coming back from a 3‚Äì1 deficit, delivering the franchise's first championship and ending Cleveland's 52-year professional sports title drought. In 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers to sign with the Lakers, where he won the 2020 championship and was awarded his fourth Finals MVP.  Off the court, James has accumulated additional wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning a Sports Emmy Award for a documentary as an executive producer), and television commercials, and has hosted the ESPY Awards (including winning 19 ESPY Awards in his own right) and Saturday Night Live. In 2015, he appeared in the film Trainwreck. James is also a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011, with the club winning the 2018‚Äì2019 UEFA Champions League and 2019‚Äì2020 Premier League.  Having become more involved in philanthropic and activist pursuits later in his career, James's charitable organization, the LeBron James Family Foundation, helped open a school, housing complex, and community center and retail plaza in his hometown of Akron"

"[League data shows the player injury rate this season is down about 6%, even though several marquee players ‚Äî including LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, James Harden and most recently Jamal Murray ‚Äî have dealt with injuries in recent weeks.](https://www.nba.com/news/nba-says-injury-rate-down-slightly-from-normal)"
"&gt;Do you not realize that the examples you gave were guys who contributed nothing to their team‚Äôs championship?  If you are going to mock a ""take"", educate yourself first.  You are dead wrong in one case.  &gt;We‚Äôre talking about AD here, the guy who was the anchor of the Laker‚Äôs defense and their 2nd best player offensively, and who was a matchup nightmare for opposing teams.  And the guy who couldn't win a damn thing in New Orleans.  &gt;Ingram and Ball would not have replicated that value, especially since there‚Äôs no guarantee how much they would improve alongside LeBron, and also b/c they have their own injury histories.   Ingram and Ball are only a mere fraction of what the Lakers traded for Davis, so this is a ""hilariously bad take"" by a completely uninformed person.  &gt;Also, AD is having a bad year now, b/c of injuries and a short offseason, but he‚Äôs also going to be in LA for a long time and will likely go back to his previous level of play once he can actually get a full offseason.   Do you know anything about the topic at hand?  The league took a six-month vacation last year.  No player has played an unusually high amount of games over the past 12 months.  If Davis cannot handle that, the fact that he'll be in Los Angeles for a long time -- at $40M per year -- is a quite bad news for Laker fans.  &gt; It‚Äôs not a one season rental like you keep insisting.   Learn thing one about the topic before continuing to waste my time.  Davis was an unrestricted free agent in December.  He could have walked, leaving the Laker organization in shambles.  And this was known at the time of the trade.     &gt;Rich Paul, Davis's agent, [told](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/rich-paul-klutch-sports-group-lakers-pelicans-lebron-james-anthony-davis)*Sports Illustrated*'s S.L.

He has a year, he has to play.

‚ÄúLebron James requests a trade to the Brooklyn Nets‚Äù
"James Harden is a f-ing BEAST. I knew he put up crazy stats but he almost single-handedly makes this team into a juggernaut. I'm not saying he's better than Lebron, but at Lebron's age and the way Harden's been playing, I wouldn't automatically put him as better than Harden at this point."
Sure Jamal Murray is good but we are comparing him to LeBron fucken James
"well let‚Äôs see.   steph played with 2, maybe 3 hall of famers in their prime    james harden is on a bullshit 2k team that‚Äôs gonna sleepwalk to a title  lebron has had his fair share of help  kd literally has not won a championship without being on a super team   kawhi got his first ring on one of the greatest sports dynasties ever.   and what has giannis played with? khris middleton and jute holiday? hm."
"If we are going by GameScore, here are the top 10 in NBA history. Note obviously gamescore gives higher points to volume scorers with decent efficiency but it‚Äôs a decent metric. Shout out to Jimmy Butler for making the top 10, Shaq for being a beast and Lebron for making 3/10 spots   2000 - Shaquille O'Neal 30.6  2017 - Kevin Durant 30.3  2002 - Shaquille O'Neal 30.1  1993 - Michael Jordan 29.6   2017 - LeBron James 29.6  1991 - Michael Jordan 29.4  1987 - Magic Johnson 28.3  2018 - Lebron James 28.3  2020 - JIMMY BUTLER 27.7  2020 - Lebron James 27.5"
Holding it against AD that he's not the best player on a team with LeBron James?    Literally any team in this league for the last 10yrs gets lebron and their best player gets demoted to second best because of it...
No he's still not better then giannis. What hurts him is that he's a second option to LeBron James
Because Lebron James and Anthony Davis are on the same team. It should almost illegal for a duo like that or Curry and Durant to happen.
"For the very first time, there are those that are starting to doubt whether or not Lebron James is the guy anymore. people are starting to circle as if he's starting to go belly up. That's a long long ways away Skip Bayless.  I want you to mark this day down Skip, this is not April 1st, this is June 9th 2021. When Lebron steps on the court.... I want you to remember this. All the ones that were talking, everybody was kekekeing and GIDDY. ""Oh look at Giannis, look at KD"". Everybody has passed Lebron by. Well we gonna have a conversation. Now I want everyone to have that same energy come post season, about the demise of Lebron James. Cause Imma be here sitting pretty."
"Injured forward Anthony Davis yelled, ‚ÄúThere you go!‚Äù Sharpshooter KCP gave a look of pleasant surprise. Center Marc Gasol belted, ‚ÄúWe got an \[expletive\] squad now.‚Äù And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-Parks&amp;Rec star Rob Pelinka hugged him &amp; said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù"
Imagine blowing out the Suns and then adding LeBron fucking James and Schroeder. This place is going to have a meltdown when the Lakers cruise through the postseason again.
doubting lebron james has worked for me multiple times before. I won a bet about the lakers not making the playoffs in 2019.
doubting LeBron James. LUL.  you new?
Lebron James
And we beat you when you had LeBron James. Crazy that one game doesn't determine everything.
Y'all boys are getting swept. No doubt in my mind üòÇ. Were missing lebron james and dicking you down
"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that crazy actually. Hakeem had a better peak, but short lived. I‚Äôd say Bird had a better peak too. MJ as well. Shaq had an insane peak, Magic has an argument.

In fact I found this article from 2016 that had Lebron at #5:  https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/nba/2016/02/08/michael-jordan-lebron-james-stephen-curry-nba-greatest"
"Last I checked LeBron James and Anthony Davis won a championship last year. You're severely downplaying the injury troubles the Lakers have had. It's not all relative, stop being a homer."
"Are you serious? LeBron James and Anthony Davis, two top 10 players from the defending NBA champions, isn't insanely bad injury luck to you? You're either trolling or a hater."
Lakers are designed to have Lebron James healthy. This means nothing.
yall seriously saying lebron fucking james doesn‚Äôt bitch at refs lmao
LeBron James Harden
"I honestly think a lot of his detractors are Bulls fans. There's still a vocal minority of Bulls fans who hated that he said he wanted to be able to walk at his son's graduation. I was at Rose's first game back at the UC after he was traded and half the stadium booed him.   For me the case for him is simple. Every MVP is in the HOF, he was the youngest to ever win it, and he beat out LeBron James for the award in LeBron's absolute prime. As Bill Simmons puts it, that's a 20lb MVP trophy. He's basketball history."
"Yes, because we totally didn't see another [player unintentionally injure Lebron on live television](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7B-STuMV7Q). But I guess the doctors are also playing into the conspiracy by [mis-diagnosing Lebron's injury as well.](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/03/25/lebron-james-reportedly-to-miss-4-6-weeks-with-high-ankle-sprain/)"
Donovan Mitchel I understand but do you genuinely believe Conley has even close to as big of an impact for the Jazz as either Lebron James or Anthony Davis? Lose Gobert and see how your winning percentage gets affected. Plus isn't Conley an injury prone player LOL. AD has won more championships during his lakers tenure than the jazz have won in their entire history. Enjoy the regular season accolades because they sure as hell won't translate into the playoffs.
Jordan was too SCARED to ever play in the Big Apple! Along with that COWARD LeBron James!! Guys like JULIUS RANDLE are just built different!!!
LeBron James 2016. He led in every statistical category
"For the Lakers I would say  Lebron James  Anthony Davis  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  &amp;#x200B;  I have multiple favorite teams, don‚Äôt judge"
"1. There's a ton, but I always reccomend [Thinking Basketball.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3HPbvB6f58X_7SMIp6OPYw) They've got some good content for all types of fans looking for deeper, non hot take NBA content.  2. When starting off, a lot of people make the mistake of only watching the player with the ball. However, off-ball movement and defense is one of the greatest skills of the game, and helps you appreciate just how much mental energy goes into the game from the players.  3. Really, that's up to you. Teams in the NBA are pretty volatile and can change identities and status through a single player joining or leaving. For example, when LeBron James joined the lakers, they went from a lottery team to a championship in just 2 years! As such, there isn't a *ton* in the way of underdogs outside of perennial losers. There are some fun young teams with bright futures though, like the Charlotte Hornets, New Orleans Pelicans, and the Memphis Grizzles. All in all, though, any choice is a good one.  4. Just have fun! Once things open back up again, playing a bit can really help you appreciate the skill these guys have, and Basketball is always more fun if you've got people to discuss and debate it with."
Brother i will let you answer for us:  do you really think the voters are going to keep Lebron James and James Harden off the All-NBA lists..
But he was losing.  He needed Kyrie. Obviously not more than Kyrie needed him but he couldn't have done that without him.  Maybe we should criticize Lebron for losing the 2015 finals then instead of giving him a pass. I mean he did shoot the ball terribly after all.  We should probably criticize Lebron in 2018 too. It's fine to lose against that team but he got swept. James Harden took them to 7 games.
"Drummond also never had KD and James Harden as team mates, he's barely even played with LeBron yet. Westbrook is the definition of ego over winning"
LeBron James needs to stop takin HGH   His hairline fucked up from the HGH   Went from one hair band to like 88
"They're pretty good, but I'm partial to LeBron and James  edit: Kevin and Durant were also great."
"Both were the 2 seed in their respective conference also. But in all fairness, 2012-13 was PEAK LeBron James. He was elite on offense and defense. He ran shit (and unfortunately still does)"
Did I miss something?  Did Lebron James suddenly not exist?  What is this take.
LeBron James
LeBron James would clamp him
Playoffs performance  Lebron game 1-2018 finals Regular season performance That james harden game where he had like a 50 pt triple double. Best playoff series Philly vs raptors 2019 2nd round.
"They really didn't do typical half-court offense though is the thing       Because the Warriors ran motion so much, in their default offense, Steph and Draymond had the ball the most. Everyone else made quick decision type stuff, like spot-up then up to 2 dribbles then pass/shoot/cut.       And if you take Steph out of the picture, Draymond as a playmaker loses a lot of value in PnRs and DHOs. And at this point in their careers, Livingston and Iguodala weren't initiators of offense, really just good connectors.       Players like KD, Kawhi, PG, a lot of wings that can't just run 40 PnRs every game need someone else to start half-court offense, otherwise it can get super iso-heavy. Even someone like Kyrie falls into this group. He's only really tried to be a proper PG once in his career, in Boston, and was way more natural alongside LeBron and Harden because he can't really be a ball-pounding PG.       Nets without Harden AND Dinwiddie have been relying on a replacement level player in Mike James. Clippers last year looked way worse than the players they had, but this year look so much better with Reggie Jackson and Rondo instead of Beverly       This is also part of why the 1 ball stuff for the Nets is nonsense. With Harden, all 3 can play their ideal roles in an offense. And why Harden + 1 works better than Kyrie + KD. But I would argue that if Dinwiddie was healthy, this absence of Harden would not be felt as hard"
TMac was on the 2013 Spurs roster that lost the finals to ~~Ray Allen~~ ~~LeBron James~~ James Jones

Just tell them it‚Äôs Curry vs. LeBron. Even then they might not know what the heck a play in is but there‚Äôs a good chance they‚Äôll check out a game with LeBron James and Stephen Curry facing off.
"It's fucking ridiculous how the absolute dipshits in this sub underrate him. If you replace ""Russell Westbrook"" with ""LeBron James"" in the title we would not hear the end of it. The disrespect is wild. Where people rank Russ in comparison to LeBron is absolutely insane. He's avg'd triple doubles multiple seasons, now will hold the record and by a longshot when it is all said and done."
Ok please now...Lebron James put up better stats and went to the NBA finals at this age. I'm sure there are others. Luka is good but he doesn't belong in the same sentence as Jordan yet.
So LeBron James performed subpar and the team lost. Wow it‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôve been saying that this whole fucking time! Jesus Christ dude thanks for finally saying it.   I‚Äôve never once said anything about Steph Curry. You‚Äôre the one that‚Äôs dick riding him this whole time. I‚Äôve been on the ‚ÄúLeBron averaged those stats in order to win‚Äù train this whole time. So once again you show you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre arguing.   Holy shit dude back with the hypothetical? You don‚Äôt win arguments with fucking hypotheticals. Let‚Äôs say LeBron plays better and the other team still out performs him and they lose. Let‚Äôs say he plays worse and the Cavs still win. It‚Äôs a fucking hypothetical with no basis. I‚Äôm done taking to you if all you have is fucking hypotheticals.   Once again not talking hypotheticals anymore.   You‚Äôre something else. I never said every star player would have to average those stats in order to win. You literally just made an entire argument out of you getting butt hurt over some wording. Steve Nash could have averaged 20/5/15 in order to win and that would have been what his team needed. Curry could average 35/5/5 in order to win because that‚Äôs what the team needs from him. The Cavs needed LeBron to get those stats because that‚Äôs what the team fucking needed from him. Holy shit I can‚Äôt believe you based your entire fucking argument over your own misinterpretation lmao this is fucking cute  I go through accounts frequently because people start recognizing the name and start arguments over nothing. I don‚Äôt care if you think I‚Äôm a bandwagon fan. It‚Äôs funny actually seeing as Kobe is my favorite player ever and I‚Äôve been a Lakers fan since 1997. But yea I was Cavs fan according to you lol. I swear you warriors bandwagon fans are something else‚Äôs no wonder people hate you guys   Again I‚Äôm not talking hypotheticals  There‚Äôs a difference between a series being easy and a series not being easy. The Cavs having 2 close games doesn‚Äôt mean it was an easy series. It was a semi competitive series‚Äôs. An easy series would a series where there is nothing but blowouts.  And yea dude I started watching basketball last month according to you. Great detective skills buddy. You‚Äôre the next Batman.   Holy shit I didn‚Äôt say anything about team built because we were talking about the fucking Cavs you decided to try to bring in the warriors. Holy shit dude come on you can‚Äôt be that dense.   The proof you‚Äôre a warriors bandwagon fan is in your name. Like I said we don‚Äôt want you back   You really are something else
"&gt;but apparently we have to temper that by specifically mentioning ""for his time"" or some shit.  Yes, you do. Unless you're suggesting that Bradley Beal (31.1 ppg) is a better scorer than prime Shaq (29.7 ppg), Carmelo Anthony (28.9 ppg) and Vince Carter (27.6 ppg), and is on the same level as prime Allen Iverson (31.4 ppg), LeBron James (31.4 ppg), and Karl Malone (31.0 ppg).  This isn't randomly taking away stats from old players, this is noting the irrefutable fact that the game has changed throughout the years and that changes in pace and rules can inflate or deflate stats. Old numbers that look impossible to replicate in the modern game are probably the result of the game being much different back then more than they are the result of basketball demigods descending upon the earth to play basketball at a level so far above even the greatest modern players that the comparison is laughable."
"If it was that easy who does Wade clearly push out of this top 20 list I hastily assembled in two minutes?Nash, Chris Paul, Harden, Barkley, Robinson and others didn't even make the cut...   * Michael Jordan * LeBron James * Kareem * Magic Johnson * Larry Bird * Tim Duncan * Wilt Chamberlain * Shaq * Kobe Bryant * Oscar Robertson * Hakeem Olajowun * Kevin Durant * Bill Russell * Julius Erving * Stephen Curry * Dirk Nowitzki * Kevin Garnett * Moses Malone * Kawhi Leonard * Karl Malone"
lebron james would have averaged like 40/12/12 in the jordan era
or if you are missing Lebron James and your starting point guard and your backup point guard and you nearly beat a fully healthy Blazer team that probably is worth noting you are doing something right.
"Yeah I didnt see the ""series he played in"" qualification my bad.   ["" One George-to-Cleveland deal fell apart when the Cavs declined to make a future first-round pick unprotected, a concession they felt they couldn‚Äôt make without assurances from James. It is unlikely that the Cavaliers would‚Äôve traded Kyrie Irving with James and George together on the Cleveland roster.""](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/06/29/report-cavaliers-wouldve-traded-kevin-love-for-paul-george-if-lebron-james-committed-long-term-last-summer/)."
He was billed as literally the next LeBron James. I don‚Äôt see him carrying a team to multiple finals appearances.
He is still Lebron James
"Yeah in 2014 ... not in 2018. How are you confused about this? It's well documented here: https://theathletic.com/660104/2018/11/19/lebron-james-cavaliers-trading-of-kyrie-irving-was-beginning-of-the-end-of-everything/  He explicitly did not pick the 2018 Cavs, he was under contract and had no choice but to play with them."
"He was, but that's definitely one of the greatest examples of great numbers on a bad team, so he goes from not even getting close to the playoffs to being the third option on a team that's expected to contend right away but not just that he's playing in the LeBron James system so his performance was going to diminish anyways did it diminish maybe a little bit more than we thought it would? Sure but I expected it"
"I think James wisemans underdevelopment is all Steve Kerr's fault. Wiseman has a lack of experience but Kerr punishes him when he makes mistakes, how else is he supposed to learn? Also I think the argument that he costs them games is futile because the chances of warriors sniffing the wcf is a pipe dream. Who cares if you guys are losing games, if you developed Wiseman well this year he could have been a great piece for a championship run next year and further into the future.   Also I think Steph is easily the best PG ever  I believe LeBron is by far the goat"
"&gt;you just look at their accolades?  LeBron, four MVPs, four rings, finals mvp all four times, I think about five or six all-defensive teams, all the all-nba teams and All Star appearances  &gt;you just look at their stats?  Probably James Harden, when you take his time over the past five or six years I'd say he's been the best regular-season player overall during that stretch  &gt;you just look at how they play on the court?  Either Kevin Durant or Steph Curry , Kevin Durand because it's just so effortless , he's 7 ft tall with a 7-6 wingspan and all that other stuff Stephen A Smith says, nobody can block his shot and sometimes when you're just not paying attention the motherfuker got you 33 points on 12 shots or some crazy efficiency like that, Steph Curry because of the distance and how effortless he makes that look, the handle, the arrogance in which he plays with and I can't think of another guard his size that's had to be guarded the way he has"
"Least favorites:  Chris Paul, Lebron James, James Harden"
"Because he has been better recently and because the evidence against Kyrie Irving being a good playoff performer is literally one series. If you think the 2019 semifinals is indicative of the type of postseason player Kyrie Irving actually is without LeBron James, you're just an idiot."
Bill Russell  Wilt Chamberlain  LeBron James
"This is true. Lakers didn't like purposely injure other players so it isn't their fault but they got a relatively easy ticket to the finals in a weird western conference. The Blazers put Carmelo and Gary Trent on LeBron James because they didn't have anyone to guard him. (Both LeBron and AD shot over 50% in that series, while Portland's stars shot under 50% and got doubled). They didn't have defense or any other options in attack that weren't isos with Dame, CJ or Melo or Nurkic posting up. The Rockets were a science lab project gone wrong. PJ Tucker simply can't guard AD or LeBron. A 6'5 center is not a good idea against one of the tallest teams in the league. Harden did what he could and Westbrook was innefective and injured. The Nuggets were a young team that was beaten up by two 7 game series against tough teams and went up against a Lakers team that had coasted through Houston. So that was pretty easy."
Bill Russell   James Harden   LeBron james
Yeah lmfao the nerds making these posts always compare his 2020 playoff numbers to his regular season numbers and not his other playoff numbers because it doesn‚Äôt help their narrative as much   2015 playoffs: 54%  2018 playoffs: 53%  2020 playoffs: 60%  Gee I wonder if you start playing with Lebron James then an all time great player would get 6% better shooting %???   Nah must be a fluke.
"Always fun to take an quantifiable, objective approach to this based on statistics, advanced statistics, individisl accolades, team achievements, etc.   I did a similar excercise about a year ago as well. Came up with  **231.4** - Michael Jordan  **224.5** - Lebron James  **213.3** - Wilt Chamberlain  **213.1** - Magic Johnson  **212.1** - Tim Duncan  **211.9** - Bill Russell  **208.9** - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  **206.7** - Kobe Bryant  **206.2** - Larry Bird  **206.2** - Shaquille O'Neal"
The other guy also all either made the playoffs or were LeBron James
True.  But what you DO get is Lebron James and Anthony Davis in the first round. Good luck.
"Even if you think they're the favorite to win the West, Miami was supposed to be like an automatic 3peat when he went there.  The way people reacted about KD, Lebron going to Miami was way worse.  [Osama Bin Laden's translator even chimed in saying the way Lebron left Cleveland was kinda messed up, that's how big it was.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/osama-bin-ladens-translator-wanted-lebron-james-to-apologize-to-cleveland/)  And then he choked."
Imagine bragging about winning with lebron James LOLOL
Soemthing something lebron James counter something
Jimmy Butler has outplayed LeBron fucking James in a Finals game. That's his legacy forever. Even if we never sniff the Finals ever again Jimmy's a Heat icon because of that run.
"The ones that you needed lebron James for? Lol alright man, you‚Äôve definitely convinced me you‚Äôre not mad"
It's not like I brought up LeBron James that carried Steph's hype during the warriors vs Cavs era. Lol. Stop being salty. Conversation's about PGs.
"Why are you bringing up things that has nothing to do with Op's question? Kevin Durant's 2012 run was simply better than Steph Curry 2015 run, Kevin Durant would have beat the Heat to if Wade and Bosh were injured in the Finals. I don't care for what happened in 2016 because it has nothing to do with OP's question. KD faced the better teams, had better stats, better efficiency and only lost to Lebron James at his peak with his Superteam."
"how can he be low on the list though? he was internationally one of the most famous players ever lol  [he was ranked the most popular athlete in china in 2016, well past his prime](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/15833269/nba-kobe-bryant-remains-no-1-athlete-china-ahead-messi-ronaldo-lebron-james)  quote from lebron in 2008: ‚ÄúI thought I was famous until I got [to China] with Kobe.""  and from [this 2012 article:](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1300916-kobe-bryant-and-the-10-most-nba-popular-stars-outside-the-usa)  &gt; Bryant not only has the best-selling jersey internationally, but it's the best-selling jersey in each individual region, leading in Europe, Latin America and China, the three biggest international markets the NBA chases.  could go on and on. kobes influence on the popularity of the league is second to only MJ. and his influence on this next generation of basketball players speaks for itself.   better basketball players during his time like duncan, lebron, shaq, etc dont even touch his influence, and thats saying something. and im not even a real lakers fan fyi, if i seemed too biased."
Because your team has a very great facilitator that makes it look effortless and conceals his weaknesses. You should know him. Goes by the name LeBron James

LeBron James has bled onto AD
"the warriors definitely did crush the west better than lebron james, i forget which year but there was a year where gsw went undefeated in the playoffs until the finals, and lebron only lost one game until the finals."
lebron looks like brony James
Lebron James and Gordon Hayward are the same player tbh
"Ok, and do you think MJ could carry those scrubs to the finals in 2007 and beat the dynasty prime Spurs team. How about in 2016, which might be possible. 2017,2018? Against a team with Steph, KD, Klay and Draymond. Ray Allen made that shot but who got the points to have it be a 3 point game before he made that shot, Lebron James, helping erase the 10-pt deficit and scored 12 that half."
"you could also say the lakers get a 36 year old back off a high ankle sprain and the team had been shite without him  also heres the thing, the lakers cant shoot. even with lebron james. they cant fucking shoot. the only reason i fear the clippers is because the clippers can shoot  its 2021, you have to shoot, thats it"
"He‚Äôs not an overwhelmingly stupid human being.  The piece that a lot of casual or newer fans should be told is that all of the really elite players are **seriously** smart.  And a lot of them are genius level.  Guys like LeBron James, Draymond Green and Chris Paul are the smartest people you will meet in any walk of life.  They think and make mental adjustments quickly.  They see what every player is doing simultaneously and think on a larger level strategically and direct other players where to go to counter strategies as a team and they tell people what to do on offense to take advantage of what they see on defense all while performing their own role at a star level.  Drummond isn‚Äôt a complete moron, he‚Äôs a normal guy.  And next to a bunch of really sharp people he‚Äôs basically playing with a handicap, and he also has some issues with coordination.  That being said, if he‚Äôs managed closely by one of the greatest floor generals ever (LeBron) then he can be used to great effect.  He‚Äôs probably the second best rebounder ever and he‚Äôs the strongest player in the NBA.  The problem is when he‚Äôs out there unsupervised.  Lakers fans feel entitled to championships every year and so even though Drummond hasn‚Äôt been bad for them, since he‚Äôs kind of an overrated player in general and didn‚Äôt just dominate for them, they‚Äôre just being waaaaaaaay over the top venomous towards him.  But Drummond will be mostly fine for them.  He‚Äôll be a solid role player, he‚Äôs just not a star like people thought he might evolve into for a long time."
" Whoever came up with that shit needs to be fired!  ‚Äì LeBron James, May 3  I believe I wasn't educated on the situation at hand, and I spoke.  ‚Äì  Lebron James, May 7"
No because their FMVP LeBron James is not playing.
"Which one. The one he won with Anthony Davis? Or the one he won with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love? Or was it either of the ones he won with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh?  Replace Jimmy Butler with any player, even a clone of Lebron James, in that final against the Lakers and you think that player would win the finals against a Lakers team of Lebron James + Anthony Davis lmao?"
1. Lebron James  2. Stephen Curry  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo  4. James Harden  5. Kevin Durant  6. Kawhi Leonard  7. Joel Embiid  8. Nikola Jokic  9. Luka Doncic  10. Damian Lillard  this is the objective list. you cannot disagree with me
Your team employs Lebron James.
"&gt;LeBron James has missed 23 games this season, (65% of total games so far).   &gt;Anthony Davis has missed 35 games this season (47% of total games so far).  Your math needs work lol"
Andre Drummond is a fraud. Might be a nice person irl but he‚Äôs a basketball fraud. His stats are worthless. He looks like he‚Äôd be good but he sucks. His floater is ugly. He has kwame brown hands. Can‚Äôt play d. I don‚Äôt think even lebron James can make him look good. I wish him well in a different jersey next season.
"He also played alongside playoff LeBron James, one of the best ever in the playoffs. He controls the game and absolutely demands insane amounts of attention  This isn't a fluke"
[34pts 11rb 7.5ast](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/5/25/17395268/lebron-james-elimination-game-stats-playoffs)
"We're talking about playoffs. He's ALWAYS shot better from distance in the playoffs versus regular season. Every damn year, just [look at his numbers](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/davisan02.html). He buckles down with his shot selection in the postseason, doesn't force as much as does during the regular season, and picks and chooses his spots depending on each matchup. The Warriors are smaller up front? Can try to force more action at the rim. The Rockets didn't have big guys to match up? More opportunities to force inside. Mix it up with mid-range looks to keep them honest. The Nuggets have Jokic and other bigs to bang down low? Face-up in no-man's land from 16 extended and take advantage of the space.   The looks he got with the Lakers were very different from what he had to work with in any playoff series with the Pelicans. He was hot, but it wasn't some extreme outlier that was unprecedented given that he was playing with the best postseason team he's ever had on a contender with LeBron James as the focal point. The fact that he was making difficult looks? Fair. His overall efficiency? Not really. LeBron James is a damn good player that soaps up a lot of defensive attention and makes things easier for a guy like Anthony Davis."
"He‚Äôs Lebron James, it‚Äôs really that simple."
"I‚Äôd say to stay in LA and get treatment but since it‚Äôs not for medical reasons, my guess is because he‚Äôs LeBron James and does pretty much what he wants at this stage of his career. Maybe Bronny has an AAU game tonight?"
"Yeah, he had LeBron James as a teammate this time around. Less defensive pressure as the 2nd option, more opportunities to face-up in a 1-on-1 scenario, and he's just become a much better perimeter shooter over the years. It make sense that he'd be able to put up one of his best postseason performances playing alongside the best team he's ever had."
"Yeah, how are people missing this entirely? AD was already a great playoff performer in the limited games we saw of him with the Pelicans. Stick him on a team alongside LeBron James and it's not so ridiculous that he'd be even better with the best spacing of his career AND having improved in two years. He's one of the most talented two way players in the league, how is it unthinkable that he'd be able to take his game to another level when healthy AND playing alongside one of the greatest of all time?   Unless he's literally playing in the same exact circumstances, you can't just go off a spreadsheet when making a conclusion like the OP. Anthony Davis shot incredibly well throughout the postseason, but it's not like it was some extreme outlier ala Jamal Murray for the Nuggets."
Lebron James?  More like ‚ÄúLebron Misses Games‚Äù. Got‚Äôem.
Have you not been watching Lebron James the passed decade?  You know what I mean though. Players who‚Äôs individual brilliance immediately means whatever team their on is a title contender.
"Lebron James is pretty divisive with all his political takes.  From China to the ""You're Next!"" stuff.  I think he pushes a lot more people away than you think.  The NBA is for sure better with him in it, but he's not the pure ratings draw you seem to think he is."
"He is better than Wade. In fact, Wade was nothing without help of Shaquille O'neal, Jermaine O'neal and LeBron James."
"Having Stephen Curry on your team inherently skews the Warriors percentage to be higher than what it is.  Both the 15 Rockets and the 07 Cavs have better defensive ratings then this Warriors team  Harden was not doubled full court constantly like Curry was that's just a straight up false statement   Ahh yes the same Larry Hughes who shot 37% from 3 in 06 and had teams guard his 3 point shot instead of sagging off him and doubling LeBron full court all game, if you watched the league back then you'd know that teams actually guarded Larry and he wasn't just some bum ass player you can leave open.   The Rockets argument is an actual joke 2015 Rockets where ranked #1 in 3 point attempts because guess what, James had shooters around him and Dwight.   the Rockets Teams aren't even comparable to this Warriors team, the Cavs ones are the closest and that happened in a time before the 3 point revolution and LeBron was strong enough and fast enough to get to the rim and finish through contact anyhow, it's just not comparable at all."
"Grizzlies could have the most difficult finals run of all time, having to go through Steph Curry, Donovan Mitchell + Rudy Gobert, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, Lebron James and Anthony Davis, to meet up against potentially James Harden, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.  The West is fucking nuts."
"Carrying the team doesn't mean you have to be selfish and shoot the winning ball. He is a PG/SG and passing the ball to wide open teammate at the last moment is a correct decision instead of shooting a contested three when you have 2 defenders man marking you. That pass to Green would have won them the game 80% of the time. He is Steph Curry, not Lebron James or Kobe Bryant.   Lebron and Curry are both great players and there is no need to slander Curry just because it happened to Lebron before."
"Warriors have been overrated for some time now... Curry is obviously great but, he's basically in the position Lebron James was in with Cleveland at the beginning of his career."
"i just think the risks of the play-in tournament make it potentially destructive to the playoffs as a product.  the Lakers were the 7th seed this season because of injury. because of the play-in tournament, there was a two game difference between LeBron James making the playoffs and missing it. imagine if the defending champions and the face of the league missed the playoffs because of a piss-take of two play-in games (and there was a high likelihood that could've happened).  i don't think anybody is gonna dispute that the Lakers deserved to be in the playoffs, but it nearly didn't happen. if the Lakers missed the playoffs after earning their spot because the other play-in team got hot as fuck for one game, that would be complete bullshit.  as a Spurs fan (grueling schedule aside), that team was way too gassed/bad to be given the opportunity to make the Playoffs - and we only lost to the now-eighth seed by 4 points.  there is a huge element of luck involved in the play-in tournament. in future seasons, i think people are gonna see how much of a piss-take it is because teams are gonna be eliminated because of unlucky circumstances.  if there is a close-enough race for the 8th seed in near the end of the regular season, there will be a race. it's happened before and those games were always entertaining. we don't need a play-in tournament in spite of that."
I'm convinced that you can drop a healthy Lebron James on any team in NBA history and he will drag their corpse to a conference championship and finals appearance. If he can take the 2007 Cavs to the finals there is legit NO team too heavy for him to carry.
"The Lakers were only one buzzer beater better and they have Lebron James and Anthony Davis, two of the three best players in NBA history (by career regular season PER).   The Nets spent a zillion dollars and only got one third team all nba player on their roster"
"Average is a surprisingly high bar in the NBA. I feel like I can name 15 better passers than Steph. In no particular order (mostly going by team record this year), Mike Conley, Chris Paul, Ben Simmons, James Harden, Jokic/Lebron if they count, Trae Young, Doncic, Lillard, Morant, Westbrook, Rubio, Lamelo, Lowry, Vanvleet and Wall is 16. I‚Äôd probably put Derozan as well but idk if I‚Äôd call him a point guard."
I have a lot of republican friends and none of them have lebron James shoes. Maybe 1 in Ohio. Also China is a bigger more fickle and more patriotic market then the US and only getting bigger. It would be a mistake from a business perspective to get on the bad side of the Chinese government if he wants to be tapping into that market.
The Warriors committed the cardinal sin of not having a player named LeBron James on their team.
"How neither Julius Randle or Trae Young makes this list when both are leading new teams to the playoffs for the first time is baffling to me.  A great playoff performance by either of them could spell something huge for the East but no it‚Äôs super interesting how Lebron James, a known factor performs?"
The Warriors should give Andrew Wiggins special goggles that makes every player on the opposing team look like LeBron James. Then they would get the best out of him every game.
Can't believe noted Warrior Stan Lebron James argued against the play-in.
*Lebron James disliked then liked this post*
the lebron james experience
LeBron James and the 2000s Cavaliers
"&gt;  but he also played his best years in a significantly harder league (defensively speaking)  His best year that you (maybe it was others I don't remember or care) cited was the year notorious for inflated scoring due to laxed rules. Mike James dropped 20ppg, and hilariously was more efficient shooting than Kobe's best year.  It's not just efficiency. On/off numbers too. But yea you can argue that the stats that show how good you are at scoring are not good enough.  &gt;He‚Äôd undoubtedly have been much more efficient in today‚Äôs era with today‚Äôs rules and today‚Äôs trends.  That's not a given at all. For example, LeBron James from 2008-2010 has the exact same True Shooting as 2019-2021.  &gt;I don‚Äôt have a problem with you saying Stephs peak is better, but all things considered, i think it‚Äôs completely unreasonable to say it‚Äôs not close.  Statistically it isn't. If you want to bring in defense which is simply not as important for a PG compared to a wing, that can make it closer. Similar to saying how Dwight Howard was a better defender than Kobe. Yes, but that's also because it's more important for big men to be better defenders.  Way better offense when offense is more important than defense? I'm extremely confident in that."
I got one: Lebron James   Last game took a shit ton out of their sails and Memphis is looking for revenge for the last game of the season.
Found it. It was KG.  https://www.stack.com/a/why-lebron-james-and-other-nba-players-block-shots-after-the-whistle
"Flagrant doesn't require a windup. Its usually always a flagrant if there is a windup.  I feel like you have issue with understanding simple logic like this, which is concerning if you actually graduated with a STEM degree.  &gt; Unnecessary contact would be LeBron James two-hand shoving Joel Embiid in mid-air.  But two hands to the face, knocking LeBron off-balance mid-air, with no play on the ball is ok? I'll remind you intent to make a play on the ball and making a play on the ball are two different things, and intent is again not required for a flagrant."
‚Äúworkers of the world unite‚Äù - LeBron James (circa 2010)
"I agree it's not an argument. That's why it wasn't ruled a flagrant foul. Draymond made a snap decision to prevent James from getting an easy layup/dunk and there happened to be contact on the head. There was no wind-up or shove. No, Green wasn't completely vertical, but when someone is coming into you the body's natural tendency is to curl forward. It's unfortunate that there was contact to James head but it wasn't a flagrant.  Unnecessary contact would be LeBron James two-hand shoving Joel Embiid in mid-air."
&gt;Just because there's contact to the head doesn't automatically make it a flagrant  It's not a flagrant if its a play on the ball and inadvertent contact is made on the head or if Draymond is vertical. Neither of these happen.  &gt;Draymond was just trying to prevent James from getting an easy basket but wasn't able to get as high as LeBron  A flagrant doesn't require intent.
"Just because there's contact to the head doesn't automatically make it a flagrant. There was no wind-up. It looked like Draymond was just trying to prevent James from getting an easy basket but wasn't able to get as high as LeBron, so he got him in the head.  A play that would warrant an ejection would be more like what LeBron did to Embiid earlier in the season."

Something like breaking protocol if he isn‚Äôt vaxxed is something that could confirm this, but Bron was photographed at a party where a photographer stated everyone there was tested and vaccinated. We could call a bluff on that and say ‚Äòthey‚Äôre not gonna turn down LeBron James‚Äô which isn‚Äôt super hard to believe but also is a claim with no evidence so I don‚Äôt feel comfortable just assuming that."

I love Lebron and I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs just playing with people or not. But I highly doubt Lebron James would be kicked out of a party for any reason anywhere even if he wasn‚Äôt vaccinated.

lol please don't tell me you honestly think that matters? It's Lebron James.
"Pentagon confirmed UFOs and they will be releasing a hearing on June 1st that will give more info.   No one talks about it, but lebron James being vaccinated or not is news  Now I know I‚Äôm on r/nba, but I‚Äôve seen numerous articles on lebron and this garbage"
He's LeBron fuckin James. I can't imagine anybody would just come up and tell him yo we can't hangout you're not vaccinated I'm scared of covid. Especially considering the rich ass people he hangs with would get top notch medical treatment the moment they feel a little ill.
Nobody‚Äôs turning Lebron James from a party because he isn‚Äôt vaccinated lmfao
"Literally not a single soul is going to get the vaccination because LeBron got it. I‚Äôve seen this sentiment on here for a while, especially when talking/implying about the black community‚Äôs skepticism in getting the vaccine, but I just find it funny  Why does Reddit keep implying people, especially black people, are waiting with bated breath to see whether or not Bron gets the vaccine in order to get it? Based on the way you nerds talk about it yall make it seem like black people are a bunch of uneducated creatures who obey the word of their stereotypical idols (basketball players, rappers, etc).   LeBron getting the vaccine holds no weight; all the family and friends I know who know LeBron James couldn‚Äôt give a fuck whether he gets the vaccine or not because it had no bearing on whether or not they do"
"You are not LeBron James, nobody gives a shit about you.   Lebron is one of the most popular people in the world, and him supporting vaccination would definitely carry some sway.  There is no logical reason for someone who loves to tout himself as a humanitarian to pass up on a chance for easy PR and positive influence like this."

lebron james and anthony davis. enough said.
"yea but the discussion was being had still.. this isnt a new random thing that the nba made out of the blue lol.  [LeBron James on NBA play-in tournament idea: 'That's wack' (Mar. 21, 2018)](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2018/03/21/lebron-james-nba-play-tournament-idea-thats-wack/446952002/)  &gt;The idea, which stems from an ESPN report and wouldn‚Äôt be adopted until 2020 or 2021, if at all, calls for a four-team tournament between seeds 7-10 to determine the final two playoff seeds in each conference.   &gt;Either way, James isn't for any sort of tournament.  &gt;‚ÄúEven if my record is better than yours?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNah, that‚Äôs wack.‚Äù"
"&gt; Can you folks not read the question? Who declined at the end of their careers?   That's quite literally not what the OP has asked in this post. Learn to read.  &gt; What star players had the most **notable decline** at the end of their career?  &gt; **Some players‚Äô games age well as they hit the backend of their career (I.E. LeBron James and Chris Paul)**, but unfortunately, most take a noticeable decline.  &gt; **Which players seemingly went from All-Star to washed over night?**  And just looking at Duncan's drop in PPG (and his drop in fantasy performance) from his age 38 to 39 seasons is laughably idiotic. He was a plus player right up until he retired. In 2015-16, he was 3rd on his team in VORP, 2nd in BPM (1st in DBPM), and 5th in WS."
"&gt;That‚Äôs just referring to playing normal defense. It‚Äôs even listed under ‚ÄúGuarding an Opponent‚Äù and has nothing to do with charge/blocks.   You are inventing some mythical distinction here that simply does not exist.  James is ""guarding"" Toscano-Anderson on this play.  &gt;I mean, they even gave an example as in post play or when double-teaming in pressing tactics.  Look up the word ""example"".  Read an occasional book -- the rulebook would be a good start -- and learn something.  &gt;This is what this rule is referring to: https://youtu.be/4BQTLtMYoo8?t=34. 2 Celtics players are jumping up and down and have their hands above their shoulders when defending Odom.  No, the rule is referring exactly to any time a player defends another player -- your imaginary distinction simply does not exist.  &gt;lmao, you‚Äôre not even in the correct rule. Again, this is referring to normal guarding position like if a player was just guarding an opponent. This is just regular guarding rules.  There is still no such distinction in the rulebook, which you desperately need to read.  &gt;Lebron wasn‚Äôt guarding JTA. Lebron was there to try to draw an offensive foul which is a charge/block rule and has nothing to do with ""‚ÄúGuarding an Opponent‚Äù rule.  You are talking completely out of your asshole.  If James was only there to draw a charge, he would not have jumped.  He jumped precisely because he was defending Toscano-Anderson.  &gt;I‚Äôm face palming so hard right now.   Maybe if you stop hitting yourself in the head, you won't struggle so terribly to understand?  &gt;Your understanding of these rules are so bad, it actually hurts.  I suspect you often suffer from headaches when you try to learn, but luckily for you, I guess, you do that extremely rarely.  Read the damn rules.  Learn thing one before continuing."
"Skip Bayless: ""My turn! No! LeBron James is not a clutch player. Let me tell you why. 2011 NBA Finals the Heat came up short against Dirk Nowitzki and the Mavericks. LeBron scored an average of 17.8 points in that series, is that clutch? How about Game 1 of the 2018 NBA Finals? With 8 seconds left, the tiny Steph Curry was guarding him but instead of shooting the ball, he passed it to George Hill? Michael Jeffrey Jordan would never. Do I have to remind you of his free throw percentage at crunch time where the Chosen One becomes the Frozen one. The shot he made against the Warriors the other night didn't count, the score was tied, he knew if he missed it he could go to overtime, that's not clutch."""
I hate the 30-11 argument so much. He also went 11-30.   He has absolutely underperformed all but one year in his entire coaching career. Two rings with LeBron James and Dwyane Wade? LOL!
"Lebron James (Cheap, fake rings don‚Äôt count)."
Cleveland cavaliers any year they have no players called lebron james
"He didn't debunk my points, he disregarded the key metric of basketball so that he could cherry pick and craft a false narrative for stans and nephews like you. It's truly an insane comment.  Let's do a little exercise shall we?  &amp;#x200B;  ||Single Season VORP|Single Season BPM|Single Season PER|WS/48 Single Season|RAPM Career|DBPM|TS%|BPM Career|WS/48 Career|Player Efficiency|VORP Career| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Michael Jordan|1st|2nd|4th|6th|1st|23rd|104th|1st|1st|1st|2nd| |Lebron James|2nd|1st|5th|5th|2nd|37th|46th|2nd|6th|2nd|1st| |Kobe Bryant|84th|155th|59th|250+|30th|250+|238th|30th|61st|27th|12th|  &amp;#x200B;  So we're just gonna throw all that out, huh? You look at these stat metrics and guys like MJ, Lebron, Magic, Kareem, Wilt, Bird, Duncan, Erving are top 10 in nearly every category. But, no...Let's just look at 10 years or so when Kobe played with a HoF center and ignore all other metrics. The fuck outta here."
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. ‚Äî Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn‚Äôs Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown‚Äôs defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. ‚Äî Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we‚Äôve created. ‚Äî James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De‚ÄôAaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox‚Äôs ability to put pressure on the rim ‚Äî as well as finish when he gets there ‚Äî would open up more room for Miami‚Äôs shooters. ‚Äî Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he‚Äôs inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. ‚Äî Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard ‚Äî it‚Äôs their greatest position of need ‚Äî and Lowry is the best available. He‚Äôd slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton‚Äôs minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn‚Äôt long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. ‚Äî Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I‚Äôm just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn‚Äôt have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He‚Äôll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That‚Äôs fierce. ‚Äî Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he‚Äôd fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. ‚Äî Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? ‚Äî Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet‚Äôs efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he‚Äôs still a bad man. He‚Äôd fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they‚Äôd be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. ‚Äî Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who‚Äôs their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. ‚Äî Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray‚Äôs absence somehow and although Rozier isn‚Äôt the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that‚Äôll play alongside Nikola Jokic. ‚Äî Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don‚Äôt really have weaknesses, so it‚Äôd be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. ‚Äî Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that‚Äôs what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  ‚Äî Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns‚Äô biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there‚Äôs no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. ‚Äî Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I‚Äôm not sure, which is why I‚Äôm bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I‚Äôm going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
"&gt; Juan Toscano-Anderson bumped LeBron James on the shoulder and told him something  ""Thursday is the optimal day to consume tacos."""
"&gt; As the both teams were headed to their benches, Juan Toscano-Anderson bumped LeBron James on the shoulder and told him something. A few minutes before that, he went right at James in transition and scored.  &gt; In Toscano-Anderson‚Äôs mind, there was clearly something brewing between him and James in the first half, but James didn‚Äôt seem to be aware of it until he said something. Following that interaction, James was clearly more energized, and that energy became infectious for his teammates in the second half of their comeback win.   Do people really believe the narrative that LeBron is mentally weak so you should talk shit to him? Do people realize that when this guy is on a mission, he becomes a freight train?"

"I mean, we've had 3 blowouts, a game that started as a blowout but got somewhat interesting in the end, and then an actual entertaining game. But that was only that way because of LeBron James and Stephen Curry played in it, which probably wouldn't have happened in any normal year. So far every team that was the higher seed has won so it almost made this whole thing pointless."

"I'm curious the influence of Bots on this. I believe LBJ has more controversy than curry around: China, BLM/Racial Justice, Police accountability, women's sports, trump, etc etc.  We all know bots are rampant on reddit and SM in general. They often are triggered to comment/post by key words, and I'd be hard pressed to believe 'LeBron' and 'LeBron James' are not part of a few bots' word bank.  This does not change the raw number of positive/negative highlights, but could influence comments sentiment."
"&gt;Link me the rule where it states that a defender can jump while trying to draw a charge.  If you cannot find the rulebook on your own, you are well beyond your depth here.  Equally easy to find is the section describing offensive fouls.  Read the rules.  &gt;Also, this argument is moot since Lebron didn't even get there in time so it was a block regardless.  Nonsense. James is waiting there long enough precisely to have time to jump vertically.  More to the point, again per the NBA rules, he does not even need to be stationary in order to draw a charge.  All he needs to be is in a legal guarding position, and that includes some situations where the defender is in motion.  The most famous example of these is probably the classic Dennis Rodman charge, where he's running sideways but still deemed to have ""beaten his opponent to the spot"".  Many of those were called incorrectly after he established his reputation, but the theory comports with the rulebook."
The road from LeBron James to George Mikan goes through Bill Walton!
When you get so easily gameplanned out of a playoff series you are the problem. Try to game plan Lebron James out of a playoff series.
Jimmy Butler won 2 games against the Lakers when his two best teamates were hurt. Putting up a 40 point triple double while guarding Lebron James. This was after Lebron James talked shit the game before. Jimmy did this with a hurt ankle.  I'd shut up if I was the owner. This is not a guy you want to play in the first round. Nor someone you want to irritate in any way before a playoff match up.
"Well according to BB ref's rate stats: https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01.html   In fact this season was somewhere between 3rd and 6th best season for him. So yeah, he does have an impressive season, but not that impressive for his standards. What's funny is that during a season where he played better (in 2019 say), according to many adv stats people had him 4th to 6th in their best player list. Now that he is carrying they have him 2nd, despite *actually* playing worse than a lot of the rest of his seasons. Merely his counting numbers are bigger because he takes more offense on himself.  And yeah, he is an eff god. That's Curry we are talking about. Still people's reaction to his season makes it look as if they forgot what Curry can do and by this point are kind of overrating his impact (yeah he played in a bad team outside of him, but so did LeBron James when AD was not around and had them 2nd , not 8th)"
For Lakers legends it only takes 5 players to get from Bud Grant to LeBron James.
"&gt;That was def not a charge in the slightest. Lebron literally jumped and flopped mid air.  Read the rulebook.  There is nothing about being airborne preventing a defender from drawing a charge.  The defender must be in a ""legal guarding position"", and as most of us -- maybe not you -- know, that includes jumping vertically.  As long as James was outside the restricted area -- which he was by a couple feet -- that play could precisely have been correctly called a charge, per the NBA rulebook.  There's no way to correctly call that play a foul on James, per the NBA Rules.  Ironically, the officials got the call right live, and then blew it upon review."
"I would just turn on the TV and see which teams you like to watch. After that I believe there‚Äôs a database somewhere not sure of the link but you can look up some players.  Here‚Äôs a couple I would HIGHLY recommend watching because they are all stars and all time greats at the moment 1) LeBron James and the Lakers 2) Steph Curry and the Warriors(they will make a comeback next year) 3) Kevin Durant + Kyrie on the Nets 4) Giannis Antetokoumpo and the Bucks(he‚Äôs just fun to watch dunking too lol) 5) Some extra all stars - Westbrook, Beal, Jokic, Embid, Simmons, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell  Anyhow those are some all stars the first 3 points are hall of fame level (except Kyrie), then you can learn about each player on your favorite team.  Hope that helped"
"But ""defense doesn't matter a lick when your team is more efficient at scoring than LeBron James"""
The Answer to your first question is LeBron James
"I took it away passing comment, and your correction is wrong anyway. Kyrie, Admiral, James Worthy &amp; Kevin McHale were the supporting stars to LeBron, Duncan, Magic &amp; Kareem, and Larry Bird"
"one player can turn around a franchise if they are named lebron james, nobody else has that level of impact.  it wasn't kyrie that brought the cavs to the finals over and over again, they still sucked until lebron came back  how many recent champions actually built their roster through tanking.. basically none.   you can say the lakers maybe, but I would say lebron signing there in free agency had a bigger impact than drafting lonzo ball  competitive teams like milwaukee and toronto during their championship run weren't built through tanking.   GSW didn't tank.  miami never tanks.    and the teams that do tank usually do it over and over again forever, like the timberwolves or kings or pelicans  even the knicks now if we are becoming a respectable team again, it wasn't because of the shit seasons and the tanking, it was free agents and a new coach"
Did you stop watching basketball like 10 years ago? The game has moved past PGs always being the primary playmakers.   Jokic is a prime example. Kawhi and PG at the Clippers. Lebron James.
"Steph Curry, Dame Lilliard, Giannis Antman, LeBron James, Nikola Jokic."
2003: 1st overall Lebron James  2003: Second overall: Darko (Pistons)   These are both not on your list?   Magic Johnson in 1979 was drafted first overall and then won 5 titles and went to 9 finals in like a 13 year career?  These other players account for over 70% of the championships. Why wouldn‚Äôt teams go for the strategy that accounts for over 70% of the titles won????
"This is literally so fucking cool.   I did Joe Johnson &amp; Lebron James, Terry Rozier &amp; Larry Bird, and Dominique Wilkins and Trae Young. The UI layout is incredibly intuitive. 100/100, ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
I've discovered that Brian Scalabrine is connected to both Lebron James and Larry Bird through some guy named Lucious Harris.   What you do with this powerful information is up to you.

"Why do I call myself a basketball fan?  Bc I watch a lot of basketball. Do you?   If you did, you‚Äôd know the definition of a flagrant &amp; that wasn‚Äôt a flagrant foul. Which is also why it wasn‚Äôt even discussed as one.  If you did watch a lot of basketball, you‚Äôd remember [this play](https://youtu.be/E09VpwYrPBc) from the playoffs, CLE vs GSW 2018 finals - which wasn‚Äôt a flagrant then either.   Which was worse? Last night‚Äôs with Green jumping straight up (‚Äúverticality‚Äù) and making illegal contact (aka a common foul) or 2018 when Green‚Äôs hand was forward and pokes James in the eye?  Lebron James has great basketball IQ, physical attributes and vision - and he‚Äôs still a huge flopping fish and a crybaby. More than one thing can be true.   (Want me to link the James flop, where he throws himself head-first into a cameraman and busts open his own head for no reason? Or do you watch enough basketball to remember that on your own?)"

"The slide tackle was still nowhere as bad because some could argue it was intentional, but there is a play where LeBron knees Steph in the groin 100% intentionally when he was out of the play. Fuck LeKaren James"
More important than Lebron? James?  What the fuck
"I am aware that people score on him, but that was a close game getting late in the 4th quarter, and a stop would've put Utah in a much better position, and it was on a shot that wasn't really that hard to defend compared to many shots that he does defend easily, that's the point. And the crazy lay's were crazy because the amount of finesse and agility required to make them was very high and done perfectly by a player who was not seen as an amazing player prior t on that time. Mario Hezonja was able to stop LeBron James rather easily, but Gobert can't stop Murray, people make mistakes which I get, but of all the times he doesn't make mistakes, the one time he does it was not ideal. Another part of the reason is the fact that I'm a heat fan and will always try to argue that Bam is better than him, and the final reason is that I love Donovan Mitchell and to see them lose because his best teammate cant do what he does best once made me irate"

"Hey Marv, do you think Neto reminds you a little bit of LeBron James?  Marv: yep"
"&gt;Certainly advanced stats have never been kind to Kobe,   There's a lot more to advanced stats than a bunch of box-score composites. prime/peak Kobe was significantly better than what his box-score advanced stats show, and his +/- numbers seem to agree with that. He didn't lead the league in a single advanced stat over his prime, and yet had the best offensive +/- numbers in the ten year study (02-11) and his minute-adjusted +/- look better than anybody on the list outside of LeBron and Duncan. He was higher than Wade, Nash, CP3, Dirk, Duncan, etc.   https://sites.google.com/site/rapmstats/10-year-rapm   Offensive +/-: Kobe: +6.6   LBJ: +6.6   Wade: +6.2   Nash: 5.5   Paul: 5.2   Essentially/virtually tied for #3 overall and the guy ahead by .1 (Wade) isn't even remotely close in terms of minutes played (Kobe played 29783 min over this sample. Wade? 20540. A difference of nearly ten thousand!).   So he's #3 overall, and only KG and LeBron are ahead. He's ahead of Duncan, Dirk, CP3, Nash, etc.   He's #1 in ORAPM (tied with LBJ...except Bryant played more than 4200+ more minutes over this sample)   Again, here he's ahead of Dirk, Nash, Wade, CP3, Duncan, etc.   He has the third best two year Offensive APM (behind only Nash and LeBron, and he's .1 behind LBJ) Kobe: +6.0 http://www.backpicks.com   That 2002-2011 study does basically cover Bryant's prime and that's why it's the one to use BUT it doesn't even include his remarkable 2001 season.   Here's the RAPM from that season (playoffs and reg season included) https://www.dropbox.com/sh/11181n4avq5wefk/AABLySVPmcZXb0uiGPEk53fpa/2001.txt?dl=0   He's #2 among all stars/superstars behind only Duncan. He's #2 in minute-adjusted RAPM overall/among all players(williams (lol) played 1800+ less min and wasn't in Bryant's universe anyway, and Stockton played nearly 1000 less min)...he's ahead of freaking peak Shaq   Duncan: 5.52   Bryant: 4.39   Shaq: 4.37   His 2001 run WOWY score is among the very highest recorded. It ranks #13 on the list (out of 1591 recorded player seasons) at 5.9, and is ahead of any single season from Duncan, Bill Ruseell, KG, Jerry west, Oscar, Shaq, Hakeem, Drexler, Ewing, Bird, etc. That Lakers teams had a 14.2 SRS with Kobe IN, a SRS change of 10.8! from the games he missed.   Now let's look at what is widely regarded as his peak (2008)   In 08 Bryant was very widely regarded as the best player in the game despite the measly 24 PER and ""advanced stats"" that pale in comparison to LBJ/CP3, and yet he put up better offensive +/- than anybody in game outside of Nash (who played a ton less minutes) and in fact had the best minute-adjusted numbers in the entire league along with KG.   Nash: +7.26   Kobe: +6.29 https://www.dropbox.com/sh/teutg7zvxudqnlw/AACIF1UxAphVjODbTtO57\_mia/2008.txt?dl=0   Kobe (24 PER): +6.29   LBJ (30 PER): +5.07   CP3 (30 PER): +3.41 https://www.dropbox.com/sh/teutg7zvxudqnlw/AACIF1UxAphVjODbTtO57\_mia/2008.txt?dl=0   Offensive and Defensive Adjusted Plus/Minus : 2007-08 Bryant was#2 in Off Adj +/- Rating   Bryant #1 in Adj +/- Rating https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qgxs2bv40jBt6GD7txEUcnItyvax\_zUfbTbnx1YXsL4/pub http://www.countthebasket.com/blog/2008/06/03/offensive-and-defensive-adjusted-plus-minus/   SWAgR Wins (minute-adjusted RAPM, first available in 2008): #1 in 2008 http://www.gotbuckets.com/   Over on the PC Board a poster completed a study that measured how well a team did when their star missed games.   It's called WOWY (with and without you)   In other words, if you looked at all of the activity of players moving in and out lineups over the years, whose team changed the most based on a given player‚Äôs presence?   Kobe (prime) had one of the highest scores recorded at +6.5.   He's higher than Russell, Wilt, Chamverlain, Duncan, Shaq, Bird, KG, Dr J, Karl Malone, Barkley, Durant, and many other great players.   His prime WOWYR is among the highest ever recroded at +6.5, and he's at +4.9 for carreer. To put that into perspective, Shaq is at 6.7 for career, and 5.2 for career.   The answer? Regression, the same statistical method used on play-by-play data in the last few years to create irreplaceable impact metrics like RAPM (Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus). Since comprehensive play-by-play does not exist before the late ‚Äô90‚Äôs, WOWYR instead regresses WOWY data, or game-by-game plus-minus data. (It‚Äôs better than WOWY, so it‚Äôs ‚Äúwowier,‚Äù and stands for ‚ÄúWith or Without You Regressed.‚Äù)   https://backpicks.com/2017/11/17/part-iv-historical-impact-multiple-wowyr-studies/   http://www.backpicks.com/2016/09/06/ii-historical-impact-introducing-wowyr/ http://www.backpicks.com/metrics/wowyr/ http://www.backpicks.com/2016/09/28/iii-historical-impact-wowyr-60-years-of-plus-minus/   Basically all the impact numbers tell us that peak/prime Bryant was having astronomical impact that went well beyond the box-score.   And what's particularly impressive about Bryant is that he made astronomical impact on great teams and next to some other stars. It's easy for a superstar to take a horrible team and get them to mediocrity, or turning a decent team into a good one, but making HUGE impact on amazing teams/ strong contenders is much more impressive, and so the fact that this his impact is at this level while playing with Shaq from 02-04 (on teams that weren't built/around him and while playing with another superstar whose biggest strength was also scoring, so certainly not the ideal situation to make maximum impact) and then anchoring the contending teams of 2008-2011 (the 08 were one of the strongest non-champion in history and GOAT level with Pau, and the 09 Lakers were one of the best teams in history and statistically one of the strongest champions ever, and obviously the 2010 Lakers were the champs) is extremely impressive   2000-2003 RAPM:   Tim Duncan: 6.653076648712158   Kevin Garnett: 5.877338886260986   Dirk Nowitzki: 5.492855072021484   Kobe Bryant: 5.319833278656006   Ray Allen: 4.893278121948242   Shaquille O'Neal: 4.781240940093994   Vlade Divac: 4.614269256591797   Eddie Jones: 4.310861587524414   David Robinson: 4.280535697937012   John Stockton: 4.192468166351318   Top-10 from 2000-2007 using this data (no priors other than the ridge penalty):   0 (Tim Duncan). 6.500221252441406   1 (Kevin Garnett). 5.95599889755249   2 (Dirk Nowitzki). 5.492483615875244   3 (Kobe Bryant). 5.328146934509277   4 (Manu Ginobili). 5.262575149536133   5 (Paul Pierce). 4.795802116394043   6 (Rasheed Wallace). 4.647972106933594 7 (Ray Allen). 4.319425582885742   8 (Shaquille O'Neal). 4.274540424346924   9 (Andrei Kirilenko). 4.141995906829834   Here's 2006-2010:   0 (LeBron James). 6.657414436340332   1 (Kobe Bryant). 6.563058853149414   2 (Vince Carter). 6.485203742980957   3 (Manu Ginobili). 6.1238603591918945   4 (Dwight Howard). 5.78971529006958   5 (Tim Duncan). 5.780171871185303   6 (Kevin Garnett). 5.3996477127075195   7 (Dwyane Wade). 5.073834419250488   8 (Steve Nash). 4.619450569152832   9 (Baron Davis). 4.204566478729248   2004-2009 APM:   Tim Duncan: 7.90   LeBron James: 7.27   Kobe Bryant: 6.95   Glenn Robinson: 6.84   Kevin Garnett: 6.68"

"&gt; Like last night LeBron had a triple double with only one turnover and the game winning shot, so in a sense that was a great game from an NBA player, but that wasn't an example of LeBron being great.   Because it wasn't a great game, He scored 22 with way below average efficency. He had a great second half after AD and him having awful first half. Overall it was a good game.   &gt; He got a bunch of free throws, so his TS%  Wel yeah, that's the best shot in the league. Getting FTs is a good thing, don't understand why you are phrasing it as a negative thing.   &gt; but he was only average from 3 (37%)  He averaged 37.8% for the series when the playoffs average was 36%. Also the average % of assisted shots in the playoffs was 81%, Harden averaged only 33% assisted 3s. So he was more efficient than catch and shoots while ISOing and creating his 3s.  &gt; and was well below his scoring average in a series that wasn't terribly competitive with his team losing 4 straight games by increasingly larger margins.  His high usage teammate guard averaged 20ppg on 48% TS%. Kind of difficult winning against LeBron James and AD like that. LeBron had a great series in 2018, sometimes having subpar teammates is a very important issue. The team wasn't the same between the playoffs and regular season.  &gt; If you were making a list of the best playoff series in Harden's career, that wouldn't be on it.  How many players in the history of the game averaged 30ppg on 65% TS while playing against a top 3 defense? And he was being doubled."
"Kyle Kuzma on Lebron James: ‚ÄúHis attention to detail. He‚Äôs just smart. Knows what we want him to do. Always in the right place at the right tine. He just makes plays. Some in the box score, some don‚Äôt. (Tonight they did).‚Äù"

"&gt;Yea I wanted the Warriors to beat he Jazz but now I want the Jazz to win becaue all the bitching the Warriors fans are doing  This happens to me every time the Warriors are even partially relevant -- so for roughly five years every five decades.  I don't dislike the team, per se, but especially right now, they have the least-knowledgeable and most insufferable fanbase -- even including the traveling troupe of LeBron James fans."
"I swear, I hardly play basketball, but even I know that in most of anything past JV, it‚Äôs a game of putting your head down and worrying about the next possession no matter the score. You trust the coaching to guide you, and, unless you‚Äôre some fucking high IQ superstar, you try your best to execute.  Somehow many fans don‚Äôt understand that, even when the stats about how teams play are right in front of them. Even when star players haven‚Äôt played in weeks, they manage to shut their brains off for the first two quarters and forget that it‚Äôs Lebron James and Anthony Davis.  Like, guy, give these guys some time to warm up. It‚Äôs a joke that you can‚Äôt wrap your head around those simple facts."

It‚Äôs really best to make predictions based on a specific game with specific players and announcers.  You can try something you know will happen but won‚Äôt kill you.  Every time James Harden hits a step-back three.  Every time LeBron James makes a skip pass.  Every time Giannis misses a foul shot.  Every time you can hear Tom Thibodeau yelling at his players.  You get the idea.

"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father. I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know. I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people. and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s. I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better. he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?"" and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league? I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now..... until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible.. edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass."

Here‚Äôs a Kleenex bro  Sorry you predicted that LeBron fucking James would lose in 5 in the first round  better luck next time
LeBron James and Anthony Davis complement each other really well.
"Randle was 24 / 10 / 6 in 71 Games.     Embiid was 28.5/ 10.5 / 3 in 51 Games.   James was 25/ 7.5/ 7.5 in 45 Games.     Yes, Lebron played at a higher level, but missed 27 games, and played 26 less James.  Embiid missed slightly less than 1/3rd of the season, Lebron missed over 1/3rd of the season. Randle played over **1000** more minutes than Lebron.  Embiid will likely get 2nd team All NBA C.  The competition at C is far weaker than the competition at F."
"Curry deserves all the credit more so than KD, because Curry and Draymond were the LEADERS of that team, leadership men‚Äôs s a lot outside of the stat line. Also Curry and Kyrie were the last great All star guards to be on the finals, besides Lowry of course who is also a great leader. Before that we have to go back to Tony Parker and Jason Kidd, this goes to show how‚Äôs difficult is to make it to the final when led by a small guard as your best player. Nash couldn‚Äôt do it, AI almost did. Kobe is a big guard who can play forward, as is Dwayne. This is why Curry and Dame get a pass more so than KD, Lebron, Giannis or Embiid. Also Dame loses series where he is expected to lose, he has also won when he wasn‚Äôt suppose to.  The player who doesn‚Äôt get enough criticism in my book is Porzingis who has fell off which can be chalked up to injuries, but still. Demand Derozan use to be talked about with Klay, PG and Jimmy. Jimmy redeemed himself from losing that series up 2-0 on the Celtics after rondo got hurt, thanks to his finals run, but now his performance this series another disappointment, even as the underdog. Kawhis leadership in the clutch, as well as James Harden. Russ Westbrook only gets triple double in the regular season has made 1 second round appearance since KD departure. Brandon Brandon Ingram with a third straight season of leading his team to the lottery. Jayson Tatum is #1, Jaylen Brown is second fiddle, that convo is over."

"Theoretically any team is LeBron James away from being title contenders. Other than that you could insert a guy like Giannis, Curry, Harden, Luka or Jokic into most teams that have like one and a half All-Stars on their squad and they'd become title contenders. Most teams lack a premier offensive, playmaking superstar which has been the mold of championship DNA ever since the Big 3 Heat stepped on the court for the first time. Without double-checking I'd say 15-20 teams lack one of these guys to be contenders. Single player impact is incredibly high in Basketball but even higher in the NBA."

"I think Jared Dudley ""do your research' has received more attention than Jokic.  Also, the fact that Lebron James wanted Steph Curry to win the MVP is laughable.  The guy is a joke, fucking that flop against the grizzlies was so unreal."
"I would have to go with yes to both! ROTY, multiple scoring titles, An MVP and a finals appearance in OKC before getting to the Warriors. Say what you want about KD's time in GSW, he was clearly the best player on that team, hit big shots in the finals, beat LeBron James and won 2 finals MVPs with them having a good chance of winning a third championship  if he was healthy and in Brooklyn he's shown himself to still be an elite player in the league, we'll see what happens this year but KD has had an all time great career when you look at what's he's done on the court."
"HeAt CuLtUrE   Don't get me wrong, they had a great run last year - but even in the finals, they basically traded Butler and Dragic for prime LeBron James, and that wasn't enough. It really fooled them into thinking they were close to a championship."
"&gt;By virtue of being a huge market they‚Äôre able to attract players like Lebron and AD without necessarily putting in the same work and consistently good decision making  Bullshit copout. Not one impactful free agent wanted to come to the Lakers after Kobe got the legacy contract post-achilles. Plus there was owner instability, and a shitty GM in Kupchak.  It took an ownership change, a front office overhaul, and the tanking capabilities of Byron Scott in order to get the Lakers attractive enough for LeBron James. Reports said his wife wanted LA, but would LeBron have come if if was still Jim Buss and Mitch Kupchak spending more Mozgov Money?  Same with New York, they had to overpay for bad ones. Now they have Steve Mills and World Wide Wes in their, Thibs coaching, and now it's an attractive destination again.  People act like big market automatically gets the FAs. Sure it takes less work, but they still need to work for it.  And not rfed is not the goat anymore. Rafa has the same number of slams and has the record for most slams in one tournament. Since Roland Garros coming up he about to have one more than Fed."
Except embiid and giannis don't play with some dude named lebron james.
facts on facts on facts. Never understood the Herro thing. He had one good game in the post season and after one lame snarl at Lebron James it was downhill from there.  &amp;#x200B;  Where's the snarl now bruh?
Top 3 in career playoff box plus/minus (min. 1K minutes)  1. Michael Jordan (11.1) 2. LeBron James (10.2) 3. Nikola Jokic (9.5)  And he has leaped this season. Could be close to 10 after this postseason run is over.
"I‚Äôd assume more people would tune in to see a LeBron James finals the same week he releases the biggest movie of the year, as opposed to tuning in to a Ja Morant vs Trae Young finals. The NBA is a business. Businesses exist to make money."
Yea I‚Äôm gonna trust your anecdote over the actual professional athlete out there   He‚Äôs not ever going to look like Kawhi or Lebron or Giannis. And that body shape hasn‚Äôt dont anything to James Harden...who happens to be what age?
"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father. I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know. I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people. and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s. I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better. he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?"" and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league? I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now..... until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible.. edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass."
"Fucking hated the comments that were like oh ya 6' Chris Paul is gonna hurt 6'8 LeBron James. Like obviously LeBron is bigger than cp3 but any grown man, and athlete, has the strength to hurt another player. It's such an asinine argument. If you undercut someone and have the leverage to yank on their arm, the size difference only matters so much."
"Lebron James load manages in game. Watch the 4th quarter again, Dennis Schroeder handled the ball until the last 10 seconds every possession. He did the same last year whenever Rondo was in the game. Lebron just sat in the corner. This allows him to stay sharp and still not have to exert 100% while also being in a position to take control whenever."

"Willis Reed, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Moses Malone, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaquille O'Neal, Tim Duncan, LeBron James.  Those 10 players are the only ones to win Finals MVP and regular season MVP in the same year. Considering the limitations of Jokic's squad you'd have to think he would he in the top half of that company if he accomplished it this year, maybe even top 3 (just for his single season resume, not all time obviously)."
"&gt;I mean not as bad as other superstars of his caliber. When Lebron plays bad we get 2-3 days of lewashed.   That's because he's compared to Jordan so he's going to get wild takes. LeBron James losing in his 18th season takes away nothing from Lebron's accomplishments but Hot take artists will do that.   In regards to kawhi, his slander is he's not a top 10 player. Some People really believe this for some reason. Even after the 45 point game, you'd see comments like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nsmu7z/kawhi_with_a_legendary_performance_tonight_4563/h0nu1bc/) When he performs bad which is not often, people like this come out the woodwork."

Kawhi Leonard and lebron James. I joke he definitely made the adjustments down the stretch. Going with Morris from the start was the right move.
"Not really. Luka's style is similar to Lebron's. Trae's style is similar to Curry's. I don't see what the gap between Lebron-Steph and Luka-Curry has anything to do with this analogy.     If Trae goes the James Harden route later down the road, this is all a moot point. At that point, I'd have to revise the post to see if you'd trade Lebron for James Harden and prime Trevor Ariza."
He needs the offense to feature him more or he doesn't give you much. There's a lot of shooting on Dallas and I'd rather Hardaway or Finney Smith shootin 3s than him  This James Harden offense does not work in the playoffs. LeBron at his peak is the only person who could pull this off
&gt;How can I make this about LeBron James?  Lmao.
....I don't know what's so hard to understand. OP connected these Finals by the least amount of players possible. You can include James Jones over LeBron if you want. It doesn't matter

"Mavs supporting cast are never going to be able to consistently step up because their offense isn't built that way.  It's like asking why no one on the James Harden Rockets stepped up or the Westbrook Thunder, or the Lebron Cavs."
Don't care if he had a reason or not to stay. The idea that LeBron James could carry that dumpster fire franchise to a championship is what made me like LeBron early in his career. The fact that that he decided to give up on the challenge made me lose interest.

"&gt;Just saying that if he were to re-sign with LA, he'll have to accept his role as he isn't exactly the greatest fit next to Bron.  There's actually almost no one who would be a better fit.  They need someone to break their ass defensively, and distribute the ball, and score a little.  Those type of players are few, and far between, and rarely cheap.  &gt;That being said, considering the latter's age and health, you do bring up a good point in that they need another playmaker so our offense doesn't turn into the living embodiment of a stone wall anytime LeBron sits (or at least allow him to take plays off on-court).  What they need is not to replace Schroder, they need a coach who can come up with more offensive ideas than simply isolating James or Davis or Harrell, and watching them do something."
"Manu was more of a shooting guard though, would‚Äôve picked him if i picked Lebron James as my MVP player"
"idk Giannis James Harden, the list goes on, always get criticized if their team is knocked out early even if they play great. LeBron is old now and just won his 4th title and has been in 12/13 NBA finals so it makes sense he gets some slack for this but still, if he beat PHX and scored 60 the goat talk would be back yet again."
You know YOU are getting old when Lebron James is talking about getting old.

"Man Bucks D coulda been better just was hitting shots. Killed em. major loss considering no James Harden and they pretty much quit w 4min left. Middleton &amp; Greek have step up challenge of guarding KD as Pelicans fan Jrue Holiday is always guarding people way bigger than him because he's so gifted on ball. But He can't be guarding Lebron, Joker, &amp; KD when you have guys that big and good on Defense. Khris, Greek, PJ, &amp; Lopez all should be able hold they own. Jrue if given Kyrie can keep him in check for 20-25pts."
u guys had fucking mike 'lebron' james out there who cares about ur role players lol
"The problem was that Schr√∂der decided he needed to be a starter to secure the bag. If he‚Äôd stuck to his role off the bench I think he‚Äôd have been way more useful. He could come in, alleviate a lot of the playmaking for James and get to be aggressive and look stellar against opposing teams second units; he‚Äôd get the bag for sure.  I still think a relatively healthy James/AD could‚Äôve taken this team to the WCF.  What I will say though is that this years team had a lot more of a ‚Äúme‚Äù mentality than a ‚Äúwe‚Äù mentality. Last year guys were pretty much written off; Dwight was a cancer, Rondo didn‚Äôt have the best reputation, McGee was dumb, Bradley had lost a step etc etc. It‚Äôs only after they gelled and showed up to ball out the narrative changed to well shit, obviously they‚Äôre good‚Ä¶  This year with Trez, Schr√∂der and Drummond they were just not the same. The BB IQ took a hit and most of them are still trying to be more than just the team compared to Dwight/McGee and Rondo.  I‚Äôm curious to see what Rob does this off season. His options are limited so it‚Äôll be an interesting puzzle.  I agree with the BroLo thing, he was *the ideal* center for this team. Him and Dwight/McGee for C‚Äôs would give AD his wish of not playing that position, BroLo can space the floor and the other two could rim run/catch lobs from Lebron.  I‚Äôm happy he‚Äôs doing well in Milwaukee, he‚Äôs a stand up dude."

"I don't know what you mean by professional, but the average ball fan 100% knows that LeBron James is good at basketball. Again, he's widely regarded as a top 2 player of all time.  I have no idea why you care about the opinions of those people, but you do you!"
The name of that man?  LeBron James.
I read this as lebron james shows support to lebron james and i wasn't even surprised
"James wiseman. He needs a different system, not the read and react one we run. I also can‚Äôt stand him being on our team as Curry deserves better.   Imagine developing rookies next to Lebron, KD, and Giannis. It‚Äôs ridiculous."

"I told you that head coaches are fired because they are usually the scapegoat. Also, coaches can still be evaluated even if they don't have the talent to win it all. You can see how the team plays and decide that a coach is not working due to his schemes and plays. Not hard to understand. And no, nobody should be solely responsible for losing, but they are responsible for their individual play/coaching. Terry Stotts is not responsible for the team winning or losing, he is responsible for schemes and plays though. If his schemes and plays are bad, then he will get fired. If Lebron james loses, it doesn't mean it's his fault. If he plays bad, it does mean it's his fault. You don't seem to realize that losing and individual performance is different."

Saw him roll towards the basket several times while Lebron was penetrating  ending up with James against 3 defenders and limited angles for a kick out pass.

"&gt;I just told you how he did it, he handles the ball a lot and passes at the end of the clock.  You said that, and you're still wrong.  He did not handle the ball a lot, for a starting point guard, exactly because he played with LeBron James.  When he did have the ball in his hands, he was usually playing with Kuzma, Caldwell-Pope, Morris, Matthews, and Gasol... four of whom are not very conducive to racking up assists.  &gt;He struggles to hit AD in any kind of roll situation, which is the telltale sign of a poor playmaker.  He never played a single regular season game with a Davis who cared.  And he only played 800 minutes with Davis, total, or the equivalent of about 23 games for starters.  The Davis that Schroder played with mainly wanted to shoot threes, and rarely rolled at all.  So again, totally wrong."
Mike Lebron James Harden
He's like MJ and LeBron put together. Mike James.
Jesus. This is just pathetic. Especially since you delete all your own comments.   You‚Äôre following me around crying *bc I don‚Äôt like Lebron James*. Think about that. Like really just *think* about it. How deep Lebron‚Äôs dick must be down your throat to think *someone else* must have issues simply bc they don‚Äôt like Lebron lmaoooo. . You‚Äôre upset and targeting me *bc I don‚Äôt like someone you like*. *You‚Äôve* got some serious issues lol  And if calling the dude a self absorbed diva is an insult then sure I‚Äôm insulting him lol. Not like he hasn‚Äôt done anything to lead ppl to believe that or anything.
"Lebron James had 7 pts at the half G6 and 14 pts at the half in game G7 with his team down nearly 30 pts at these points in both games.  He stat stuffed in garbage time during blowouts, get the fuck out of here giving me statlines to a game you clearly didnt watch."
"He‚Äôs supposed to play behind LeBron fucking James.  Our championship team was LeBron running the point with KCP and DG starting on the wings.  In hindsight Schroder would have been much better remaining in his sixth man role, and I‚Äôd rather we started Kuzma who clearly sucks coming off the bench."
"You‚Äôre wrong  He thought about retiring but didn‚Äôt because he wanted to threepeat, it wasn‚Äôt until his dad was murderd until he decided to do so ‚ÄúShaken and disillusioned by the murder of his father and an NBA investigation into allegations of illegal betting (of which he was eventually cleared), Jordan announced his retirement from basketball in 1993.‚Äù   And the ‚Äúyou lose some hunger and some edge‚Äùquote, he is saying that he was so dominant that there wasn‚Äôt really any competition, he went on to play another sport because he wasn‚Äôt afraid of the challenge. Also he came and threepeated a second time( and somehow he‚Äôs not a competitor?). Also also many people believed that the bulls would have won 8 consecutive times had he not retire, so there‚Äôs that.   We all know how great defensively Scottie was and Rodman being a rebound machine... let‚Äôs start off with pippin, he came in after Jordan was establishing himself, Scottie was Jordan‚Äôs sidekick and a pretty great one at that...Lebron was dwayne wades sidekick, wade had already won a ring, bronny boy had to ‚Äúlearn to become a champion‚Äù... Jordan learned by doing it, hence why he was finals MVP for all six finals.... as for Rodman? He came in after Jordan already threepeated.  Do you really want to talk about which guy cried the most when Jordan was in a era where you could clothesline a guy for a block, while queen James cries every damn time he goes to the rim and doesn‚Äôt get a call because someone barely touches him... also do we you need to see a video compilation of all the terrible flops Lebron does?   When did Jordan get swept in the finals? I missed it... also you comparing MJ in the toughest conference for his whole career, making it to the playoffs his first 3 years in which the second year he got hurt and the team that beat him twice went on to win those finals. Yet he still managed to get 6 rings...to Lebron playing in the softest conference almost his entire career, lost to to Washington his fist year and they didn‚Äôt go to the finals, 2nd year got swept his fist time against the Spurs and loses to Boston twice and the Magic‚Äôs, had to leave town because he couldn‚Äôt handle losing and ran to daddy wades arms to save his career..and only managing 3 rings and 6 finals loses?  Again... he joined the lakers in 2019 yes, and the plan was waiting for AD to leave New Orleans, hell he even tried to recruit kawhi leonard, to further stack his team.  You telling me during the 2018-2020 years AD wasn‚Äôt in the talks of being a top 5 player?  Me calling Lebron a bitch, is me calling him out on how he acts... which is like a bitch.  Again questioning MJs mental toughness?  How does that quote make him weak? Because he shared how he felt after criticism about his gambling? (not criticism as a player or his skill or he‚Äôs decision as a player)... even then, any criticism against him he uses it as fuel to become better and to be as great as as he is. So yeah, that‚Äôs being mentally tough. Lebron sees his team losing and he walks out of the game with time still on the board... blames his team when shit hits the fan...plays half ass defense... not shaking hands with the suns after getting knocked out of the playoffs...constantly making excuses to make himself look good.   Yeah you try to control the narrative, and have such a terrible take by saying Jordan isn‚Äôt mentally tough and competitive... even In The Last Dance you see him playing the security guard quarters until he was able to beat him and dominate him. When he couldn‚Äôt beat Detroit, he worked his ass off to become tougher so that he could beat them...which he did. Lebron went against  KD and the warriors and failed and the next time he went against them failed again with his second finals sweep."
Roy Hobert is by far the greatest defensive center in NBA history. He was so good that LeBron James begged the commissioner to change the rules.
"&gt;they're akin to Westbrooks stats.  You're going to have to sell that garbage elsewhere.  Westbrook took a bad team to the playoffs with those stats.  The Lakers also would not have made the playoffs without Schroder.  &gt;If you watched schroeder play he CANNOT run an offense without Lebron or AD on the floor, our second squad looks LOST out there  Because Vogel's only offensive ideas are to isolate James or Davis, and watch them do something.  No player is going to thrive playing with Wesley Matthews, Markieff Morris, Marc Gasol, and Talen Horton-Tucker, when all are simply freelancing with no plan.  Even Schroder's most frequent teammate Caldwell-Pope routinely lost his confidence and was generally streaky as usual.  &gt;, if they're paying $84 MM they need a 1 who can create offense through any set of players on the floor,  No such player exists.  Harden couldn't do that.  &gt;Schroeder is not staying in LA.  He might, but he absolutely should."
"I made it a personal goal to see LeBron James play in person, just so I can say I've seen LeBron James play in person.  He's a living GOAT, and I'm so glad that in 20 years I can say ""Yeah, I saw him play in person.""  That being said, I'm happy to watch him lose.  It's kind of the point of sports.  Rooting for underdogs is normal."
"Wikipedia is ridiculously strict about paid representatives of a company/individual/etc. making even the most benign, factual, rock-solidly-sourced edits / corrections to the client's page. Unless the paid rep stealth-edits the entry (which is ironically the sort of behavior that fuels Wiki's obsession with not seeming biased), then they're at the mercy of kind strangers to fix things. No big deal if you're LeBron James; if you go on there and edit the page to say he was raised in Thailand, some other passerby will fix it in 2 seconds, but if you're Steve Clifford, then it's tough shit."
he didn‚Äôt call fans uneducated or misinformed. he said morey was uneducated or misinformed on the nba‚Äôs relationship with china. he was also against players discussing the matter at all until reporters in america wouldn‚Äôt stop asking him about it.

"&gt;so, if schroder was passing to, idk, wiggins and oubre instead of lebron and AD how many assists would he have?  He rarely passed to James and Davis.  They missed a lot of games, as you may have heard, and even when they did play, their offense was almost exclusively either ""Give James the ball and watch"" or ""Give Davis the ball and watch""."

Are you trying to say something here? That LeBron James has passionate and irrational haters?
"I‚Äôll start this as I‚Äôm not a big fan of Lebron James, but I still respect his skill and what he has done for the game. Seeing pictures of him or any athlete after losing is crushing to me and makes me connect with them on a more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù level. As a kid losing was always such a crushing feeling. Just because lebron or other professional athletes have made it to the big time doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt still humans and doesn‚Äôt mean they magically don‚Äôt feel crushed when losing.   The playoffs this year have really brought out the shittiness in a lot of the fans. Spitting on athletes, throwing popcorn on them, throwing water bottles at them. What the fuck is so wrong with someone to think it‚Äôs okay to do that to someone? The guys are lucky they didn‚Äôt get the old Ron Artest treatment."
"I‚Äôm a relatively new comer to basketball (after decades of time away from it) and while I agree with everything you say I just wanted to comment on the arrogant and classless part: This is really the image I have of him. The stupid shit he put out there 4 years ago and how he has this ‚ÄúKing James‚Äù thing going for him, that really makes me dislike him. I love dominant athletes in every sport, LeBron would be a no brainer for me to be a fan of but this whole thing about him just leaves me disliking him immensely.  How he left his team out to dry is something I can‚Äôt make sense of. He literally has to do just one small thing to boost the morale of everyone in that team and win over millions of haters at the same time. Instead he does things for LeBron."
"Mate, Clyde averaged 21/7/4 with 50% shooting that season as a Rocket, and he made All-NBA team. Similar to Kevin Love? Who barely made All-stars because multiple selectees were injured. Are you kidding me?  Why is this even a conversation, are you trying to compare 1995 Magic to 2018 GSW? Like.. what?  Check you stats before ranting random shits, Jae Crowder played 107 games for Jazz. He had third most attempted shots in both of seasons with Jazz, plenty of chances.  Yeah of course, he is Lebron James, but true fans would always remember The Block, The Shot, and the Stop. How many fans do you think know that Pau Gasol was actually the most impactful player on the both ends for 2009-2010 Lakers? Kerr won a game for Bulls with that shot, do you think people mention that more than MJ's last shot?"
With LeBron James the Cleveland Cavaliers are arguably the worst franchise in NBA History
We ain't talking about LeBron James
"&gt;Lol, the sole goal of the NBA is to reach the playoffs?  For small market teams it basically is lol. You can argue about whether or not the Magic are a small market team but only 1/30 teams can win a championship each year. Even harder if you can't just sign Lebron James because you're in a big city after having a failure of a rebuild."
"Tom Brady was the face of the NFL. I wasn‚Äôt getting bombarded with what he was eating for dinner. NFL is even the bigger league here. So again wrong. It‚Äôs literally just Lebron.  Patrick mahomes is currently the face same deal.   What do I need to know the question for? I heard Lebron say ‚Äúmoreys comments were uneducated‚Äù ‚Äúthey were selfish‚Äù ‚Äúthey hurt people financially‚Äù comments only someone extremely uneducated and selfish would make?    But just for arguments sake here‚Äôs Lebron doubling down on his stupid ass comments.  When asked why he thinks Morey wasn't properly informed about the unrest in Hong Kong before he tweeted support for protesters, James said it is ""just my belief."""
How good are the Nets this year?  My goodness they haven't even had a hard opponent in the playoffs yet and you are talking like they are some unstoppable force.  And you are laughably dismissing how easy the Lakers cut through nearly every team in the league last season.   That was because of Lebron James and Anthony Davis.  Healthy.
"Personally, I like seeing him fail because of how egotistical, arrogant, selfish, and down right stupid he is.  From Hong Kong, to ‚Äúreading mao,‚Äù pouting and giving up on his team, several super teams, and many, many more, I absolutely love to see him fail.  The only thing he‚Äôs done that I appreciate are his schools. Outside of that, fuck LeBron James."
"[Charania] Anthony Edwards has been fined $50,000 for tampering due to his Instagram comments regarding LeBron James."
"I love all the armchair sports psychologists being like ""he quit on his team, it affects everyone, accountability starts at the top, he always has bad body language and it hurts his teams"" as if anyone on Earth knows more about leading a basketball team to success than fucking LeBron James."
"You've never seen so many people happy that an athlete failed?  Just off the top of my head, Tom Brady, Brad Marchand, pretty much the entire Toronto Maple Leafs, Kobe Bryant, Alex Rodriguez and Roger Clemens all have a MUCH higher ratio of hatred:supporter than LeBron James does."
"I mean that's not really what the quote is about though, he specifically says that he wanted to give the Suns a ton of credit, and that without Davis they didn't have a chance. That's pretty high praise, to say that even with James playing, the Suns were the better team.    I think it's fair to say that if Davis was healthy, the Lakers would've been the favorites. It's a criticism of LeBron more than anything, pretty deserved in my opinion."
"Yeah that‚Äôs what I just said. And nobody is a superstar when they come into the league, unless we‚Äôre talking about from a marketing perspective because Lebron James and Zion Williamson were definitely ‚Äúsuperstars‚Äù before they ever suited up professionally. Paul George is a perennial all star who has had one MVP caliber season. That doesn‚Äôt make him a superstar. Especially since ‚Äúreal‚Äù superstars are made in the offseason"
"The Nuggets are starting to feel like the Raptors from 2015-18 when they would compile great regular seasons and then always get to a point (Lebron James) they couldn‚Äôt get over. Murray‚Äôs a big piece, but I have a hard time reconciling the team I saw beat Portland with the team that just got swept. They‚Äôre going to need to make some kind of move to be taken as a serious threat in the west next season."
"I think it really shows the difference between a player like lebron James and Chris Paul. I love lebron but stats like this really display the passing control and offensive control between him and the greatest point guards to ever play. Chris Paul is just on a different level, his passing is methodical."
"Is Jokic really top 3? I know he won MVP, but is he really better than Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Lebron James, Joel Embiid, and Luka Doncic? I know I will get downvoted to hell for calling this out, but come on."
"&gt;If you think Rich Paul would leave LeBron high and dry you‚Äôre either naive or stupid.  As we have seen, James is not actually indestructible.  If he had, say, popped his Achilles last year like Bryant, Durant, Thompson, and others have, Davis was gone.  Paul wasn't leaving Davis in LA to play with Wesley Matthews and Ben McLemore, and Davis would've fired him the instant he tried.  Speaking of which, the instant Davis realizes that Paul is prioritizing another client over him is the instant before Paul gets fired by Davis.  &gt;Davis‚Äôs ‚Äúagent‚Äù is Lebron‚Äôs agent.  Then why didn't Davis, or Paul, or anyone, come out and say ""AD will only play for the Lakers""?  That would've tanked his trade value, and the Lakers would not have had to decimate their roster to rent him.  Which would have obviously been for the best for James, and Davis as well.  In fact, the opposite occurred, and Davis told anyone who would listen that he would play anywhere except New Orleans... which inflated his trade value beyond all reason and caused him to be roughly twice as expensive as James Harden.  Why?"
Have you heard of this guy named LeBron James
"Denver was 13-3 before the playoffs and looked like a juggernaut WITHOUT MURRAY. they beat a good Denver team fair and square which just beat a healthy Portland Trailblazer team. Dwnver had a good team when they faced the suns, especially when they picked up Aaron Gordon. They were beaten an AVERAGE of 18 ppg in 3 straight playoff games With MVP Jokic balling out.   Monty just outcoached them and together with James Jones, put together a COMPLETE roster that could run his offensive and defensive schemes.   7 Straight playoff games is also an unreal streak. At some point in time, youre going to have to respect the style of basketball they have been putting on the floor, both offense and defense, against anybody, whether it be Lebron and AD, who they beat fair and square in Game 1, or against MVP Jokic who they swept (Jokic flagrant came in the 3rd qtr... He made a mental mistake and shouldn't have tried winding up to swipe the ball in the first place... So he should be also faulted for putting himself in a positon to be thrown out of the game). The type of basketball they play is beautiful and that is something that demands our respect. Go Suns!!!"
LeBron James lol
"Ask yourselves this, would they have ejected LeBron James, Steph Curry?"
Did he really drag this team? Murray got hurt late in the season. I wouldn‚Äôt really say he dragged them anywhere. They played like the last 12 games without him and played a Blazers team that could‚Äôve played in the play in had it not been for the Lakers injuries but I digress. If I had to choose I would say the most valuable player is the player who can elevate players. I think it‚Äôs one of the reasons why KD has never been seen as a better player than Lebron. He doesn‚Äôt elevate players. I‚Äôm going to seem like a Lebron superfan here but IMO Lebron covers all three of those categories(he is a system within himself). I think that it‚Äôs been pretty easy to tell who‚Äôs the best player in the leagues only because the anomaly that is Lebron James. I also think players can tell too. I guess I just don‚Äôt like that in some way the MVP to a lot casuals and analyst means best player. I think it really hurts guys like Giannis who win then go to the playoffs and underperform and people call him trash. It‚Äôs like the playoffs are a different beast and some of these guys game in the regular season is really easy to nullify in the playoffs. We really will have a hard time determining who is the best player after this season. I think it‚Äôll become more categorized rather than a single player. The NBA is so skilled now you really can‚Äôt separate these guys anymore. Anyways I‚Äôm just ranting at this point

"&gt;If you think Schroder is a better fit for the Lakers next year than Lowry would be, I‚Äôd say 90% of fans would disagree with you.  I would agree with your estimation.  It's also true that 90% of fans have no idea what they are talking about, and I'm not in that cohort.  The fact is that Schroder is exactly the fit they need.  It'd be nice if he could shoot better, but with respect to spacing, that's irrelevant, because teams don't slack off him to any meaningful extent -- which is exactly why he blows by so many defenders for layups.  &gt;Remember the game against the Raptors this year when Lowry absolutely killed us? Schroder is not capable of producing a game like that.  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201803200UTA.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201803200UTA.html)  41/7 on 16 for 28 shooting against Gobert and the Jazz.  &gt;The fact is, in the playoffs, Lebron is the ball handler for 36 minutes a game and Schroder is not a floor spacer.  The fact is, they got Schroder precisely so that James would not have to handle the ball for 36 minutes every game.  And they traded 40% career shooter Danny Green to do it, exactly because the former was a higher priority than alleged spacing.  &gt; Id rather have Caruso, KCP, Kuz/Matthews, and AD out there with Bron.   Schroder had a better offensive rating than all of those players except Davis and James.  And if you think Matthews is an NBA caliber player, you are quite a bit dumber than I even previously thought.  &gt;And if i don‚Äôt want him out there in crunch time he sure as shit ain‚Äôt worth 20m a year.  Luckily for everyone concerned, your opinion on that matter is irrelevant.  Before forming such opinions, you need to equip yourself with the facts of the situation.  Almost every claim you have made is demonstrably wrong, and not surprisingly therefore, so are your conclusions."
Just one article.  https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/2020-21-nba-mvp-rankings-where-lebron-james-steph-curry-stack  Shut it.
"In what world is Luka above these names? Last years MVP, this years MVP runner up, Curry, Kawhi, Harden and freaking Lebron James.  Jesus people are seriously jumping the gun on this one."
"I‚Äôm aware - Harrell + Caruso S&amp;T + 1st round pick works. Exchange either of those for Kuzma and it works too.  Bro they are the Lakers. They can afford to be the deepest tax team in the league. And if they wouldn‚Äôt, then they are dumb as shit for penny pinching while they have Lebron fucking James  &gt;Knicks are more likely  Lowry has a better chance to win with the Lakers"
Morris is what Lebron James would look like if he wasn't given the super soldier serum
Say that to the NBA MVP and LeBron James lol
"Lebron James carried a Cavs team ALONE before his prime. I don‚Äôt even like LBJ that much, but the best in the world can carry a team, and certainly don‚Äôt shoot 0-4 in the 4th with no fight. Dont get me wrong KD is still one of the best players in the league, but people have been trying to claim his as best in the world for a while when he‚Äôs had a stacked supporting cast."
He never had the full team against the Bucks it was him &amp; Kyrie kicking their ass now it‚Äôs him without Harden or Kyrie. Bucks still have Middleton &amp; Jrue with Giannas. If Giannas lost them two y‚Äôall wouldn‚Äôt be saying this nonsense. Lebron wasn‚Äôt expected to beat better teams with less talent only idiots like Skip Bayless criticized him for losing to GS. The better team will win the series. KD is a better player than Giannas that isn‚Äôt up for debate. But if he‚Äôs out there with Mike James and Jeff Green while the Bucks have Middleton and Jrue it‚Äôs not an indictment on KD. Now if Harden returns it‚Äôs balanced. Kyrie had a boot on he‚Äôs probably done.
And James had a 29 year old six time all star who gave them 20/11. It's like you Lebron boys always conviently forget Love was a top 15 player when he joined the cavs and the you fucking asked him to go stand in the corner because that was the only way Lebron knows how to play.
&gt;Compare this team with 2018 Warriors when they lost Klay and Durant against the Raptors.  Incredible how the Warriors lost to the Raptors in 2018 while also sweeping LeBron James and the Cavs that year in the finals as well....  Truly an all time great team to pull off such a feat.
"The Bucks are a super team.  Middleton is an All-Star, Holiday is ranked as a top-25 player (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2021/5/4/22416337/top-25-nba-player-ranking-lebron-james-nikola-jokic), and Giannis is one of the best playing right now.  A healthy Nets is on a different level, but you can‚Äôt compare the Bucks to the Raptors teams LeBron used to dominate."
"please answer the question: did you watch all 48 minutes of all six games? Because I did (other than the garbage time in game five), and as someone who's watched LeBron James play basketball a lot over the last three years I promise you that he was not at 100% in that series"

Has LeBron James always been cloned in his commercials? Looks like there's at least 5 LeBrons doing different things simultaneously in a LeBron-led commercial.
"&gt;. Ingram and Ball couldn‚Äôt even make the playoffs with Zion.  So you are saying Williamson, who literally stood and watched on defense, is nearly as good as LeBron James?"
"All flop team:  C - Joel Embiid, PF - Lebron James, SF - James Harden, SG - Marcus Smart, PG - Trae Young, 6th Man - Kyle Lowry. Team goes 16-0 in the playoffs."
"Ben Taylor, the creator of Thinking Basketball, has a metric called PlayVal, which is described as ""Playmaking value, an estimate of a player‚Äôs points per 100 impact from playmaking only.""

"Reddit has consistently placed Spo in their top 5 NBA coaches since 2012...so Reddit thought much of Spo.  He completely misses the playoffs (in the weak East) the season immediately following Lebron's departure. And again, I know you guys are going to say ""well, Bosh got sick!!!"" Which is true...but Spo, on the date that Bosh announced he was sick and out for the season, the Miami Heat was 10 games under .500 more than half way thru the season.  That is pathetic.  And remember now, in that last Lebron Finals, Spo got blown the fuck out by the Spurs and that series was not even competitive.  And what series are you referring that he won with a bad team? Because, again, he only has won one series, outside of Lebron James and last year's bubble run. One.  I will give Spo credit for his 2020 run. That was impressive. But that is literally the only impressive run he has ever had save maybe 2012.  And Ty Lue's 2018 run was as impressive as anything Spo has ever done including 2020."
"&gt;No, winning a championship is an automatic success.  No.  Simply put, you are one-hundred percent wrong.  A team can lose a trade -- badly -- and still win a title in the same season.  Not only has been done, but the Lakers have done it in the past.  That you are ignorant of basic basketball history does not bode well for you in this conversation.  &gt;A championship wasn't even in sight prior to that lol.  They are the Lakers, a championship is always in sight.  &gt;You're forgetting how suboptimal LeBron's fit was with that core.  And you're forgetting that we are talking about LeBron James -- who had already won with lesser teams.  &gt;Even for them to have remotely a chance of competing, Ingram would have to be an all-star level 2nd option. It's easy to look back with hindsight, but Ingram doesn't develop into an all-star staying on the Lakers.  You don't know that at all.  Maybe he learns from James and is even better.  &gt; We wouldn't have had Zubac regardless.  Yes, they would have.  They traded Zubac to make financial room for Davis.  &gt;No guarantee Green would sign with that roster. Or Howard even.  Green would've been on the bench anyway, behind better players.  Howard, too.  There's also no guarantee better players don't sign with the Lakers, seeing an opportunity that didn't exist alongside Davis.  &gt;They're definitely not getting past that Clippers squad with that roster.   They didn't even play the Clippers.  What the hell are you talking about?  Please learn thing one about the topic at hand.  &gt;Suboptimal fit and talent (despite your depth claim, Ingram and Lonzo wouldn't have been reliable and were largely inconsistent the previous season).   Ingram and Ball both would've been the best shooters on that team from the arc -- with obvious benefits to all of their teammates including James.  &gt;Couldn't have defended nearly as well either without Davis helping create that identity.   Their defense would not have been as good -- but their offense and bench would've been miles better.  Ingram alone replaces Davis' offensive production.  Zubac is much better than McGee and Howard, and Ball is miles better than Green.  &gt;Ingram and Lonzo wouldn't have been reliable and were largely inconsistent the previous season  Inconsistent?  Like Davis, you mean?  Who took to firing up threes at 33% last year, and 26% this season?  &gt;2016 Cle were not only more talented with bonafide 2nd option all-stars (with Bosh being a reliable 3rd option and Love being a somewhat reliable 3rd option)  Two or even three players does not make a team.  That Cleveland team featured Irving shooting 32% from three that season, and Love at 36%.  Neither played a lick of defense.  They were playing Matthew Dellevedova half of each game, and Mozgov started more than half of their games.  You need to do much better getting simple facts correct, before you move on to theories.  &gt;, they also had a much, much better fit (especially with people who could actually hit 3's  See above regarding Cleveland's shooting.  And again, Ball and Ingram last year would've been the two best shooters on that Laker roster, so you are talking utter nonsense here.  &gt;3). James was also younger and didn't have to defer nearly as much as he needs to now to a reliable 2nd option (which Ingram wouldn't have been against contenders).  You've no way to know that, but even if so, they could've had Jimmy Butler for a pittance, compared to what they blew to rent Davis -- as I already mentioned.  &gt;I invite you to rewatch their 2018-2019 season in its entirety.  Should not take long, since the relevant players rarely played together.  It's almost like that may have mattered?  &gt;The issues were so conceptually and fundamentally wrong, and that roster would've matched up so poorly against the other contenders, it makes me question how much you actually understand the actual sport.  Clearly the answer is, ""Far better than you do"".  &gt;It doesn't work like that lol. Having a 6 month break before those 29 games doesn't suddenly mean you won't need notable time to rest before the next season.  It precisely does work like that.  NBA players in the bubble were as-rested as any of them will be, until they retire.  That six-month vacation -- with almost no organized basketball available -- was for most, the only time in their lives between about the ages of about 10 and 35 where they will be healthy, and not balling.  There is absolutely no reason that any of them should have been worn out after playing at-most 29 games.  Any that were worn-out can not handle a full NBA season -- which has been the case throughout Davis' career.  &gt; Especially when you're playing at the highest level with the shortest time in between games. And especially especially when you're dealing with an achilles problem after the playoffs.  Sounds like we're talking about an injury-prone player, and maybe one you don't want to trade 7 players, 3 picks, and a swap for.  &gt;The last time injuries kept him out for a substantial amount of games was the 2015-16 season. The injury-prone tag is overblown.  Davis has played over 68 games only twice so far in his career, and never more than 75.  &gt;If you mean before the Davis trade, they weren't.   Look, if you cannot do simple arithmetic, discontinue wasting my time.  5 Championships in 20 years is exactly 2.5 per decade.  &gt;Even if the wolves wanted to lend us a hand, that's a starting 5 with even worse shooting.  Look, learn thing one about the topic, or again, discontinue this nonsense.  Butler was not in Minnesota.  You are embarrassing yourself here.  &gt;No, it looks great. They won the chip and would've had a great chance at repeating if not for freak injuries.   Davis suffering an injury is not a freak occurrence.  The freak occurrence was 2020 when he didn't.  &gt;Need them? Nah, their window to compete is now. Wouldn't matter later on.  This is so fantastically ignorant that I'm almost speechless.  The Lakers don't win one title and call it a day.  Other franchises would love to, but the Lakers' standard is miles higher than that.  They fired a GM who won 5 rings for them, which is unprecedented ( and probably a mistake ).  &gt;Except if you actually watched Deng the year prior, you would absolutely know that that was outrageous. I like how you mention ""all-star"" too as if that was even somehow relevant to the time of the signing lol.  Again, these are the risks one has to take in order to build through free-agency.  I'm sure I just explained this, so I don't know why you couldn't read it.  This is precisely also the problem with spending a decade of draft assets to rent Davis -- it will force the Lakers to take more risks of this nature, and some will backfire like the Deng contract did.  &gt;Only if you have other options. Which they didn't.  For the final time, learn thing one about the topic at hand.  Jimmy Butler was traded the very same day, for almost nothing.  One additional point.  Learn how to use reddit.  One does not copy unrelated comments into one gigantic pile.  If you cannot even figure that out, once again, please discontinue here.  Respond in the appropriate threads."
"&gt;100% agree that he fills the role for the Lakers, but you do realize that role is needed when lebron is off the floor.  Again, what are you babbling about?  They need to defend all the time, not just when James sits.  Also, much of the point of acquiring Schroder was to let him run plays with James off the ball -- not off the court.  If you are capable of googling, you can find many quotes from Laker personnel on this very topic.  With James' and Davis' contracts, the Lakers are not going to be in a position to pay bench players $16m anytime soon.  Anyone making that much is going to need to start, and play 30+ minutes."
"&gt;It might be. We won't really know for a decade or so, when we know more about how much, exactly, they gave up to rent one player for one season.  No, winning a championship is an automatic success. Davis could've walked away in free agency after the chip and it still would've been worth it. A championship wasn't even in sight prior to that lol.  &gt;The Lakers quite likely would've won last year even without overpaying for Davis... James/Ball/Ingram/Kuzma/Zubac with Hart, Caldwell-Pope, Caruso, Green, Howard, McGee, Rondo, Hunter, and Wagner is by-far the deepest team last year  You're forgetting how suboptimal LeBron's fit was with that core. Even for them to have remotely a chance of competing, Ingram would have to be an all-star level 2nd option. It's easy to look back with hindsight, but Ingram doesn't develop into an all-star staying on the Lakers. We wouldn't have had Zubac regardless. No guarantee Green would sign with that roster. Or Howard even. They're definitely not getting past that Clippers squad with that roster. Suboptimal fit and talent (despite your depth claim, Ingram and Lonzo wouldn't have been reliable and were largely inconsistent the previous season). Couldn't have defended nearly as well either without Davis helping create that identity. Not having LeBron as the PG also gives him more offensive responsibilities and leaves even lesser energy for defense than normal. I could go on. The Davis signing was such a catalyst for so many of that 2020 team's success.  &gt;You're wrong.  No, they were right.   &gt;James has won with less.  No, he hasn't. 2012-13 Mia and 2016 Cle were not only more talented with bonafide 2nd option all-stars (with Bosh being a reliable 3rd option and Love being a somewhat reliable 3rd option), they also had a much, much better fit (especially with people who could actually hit 3's, that 18-19 squad was awful with the 3). James was also younger and didn't have to defer nearly as much as he needs to now to a reliable 2nd option (which Ingram _wouldn't_ have been against contenders).  &gt;I invite you to research the above statements before replying. If necessary, search my comment history, as I've covered these topics repeatedly for other similarly-uninformed people.  I invite you to rewatch their 2018-2019 season in its entirety. The claim that they would've been contenders with a high chance of winning with your suggested roster is absolute hogwash and uninformed; it _absolutely_ ignores the fundamental issues they had that season. The issues were so conceptually and fundamentally wrong, and that roster would've matched up so poorly against the other contenders, it makes me question how much you actually understand the actual sport.   &gt; And while the offseason was short, it was preceded 29 games earlier by a six-month vacation  It doesn't work like that lol. Having a 6 month break before those 29 games doesn't suddenly mean you won't need notable time to rest before the next season. Especially when you're playing at the highest level with the shortest time in between games. And especially especially when you're dealing with an achilles problem after the playoffs.  &gt;""Dude"" has been injured almost every season.   The last time injuries kept him out for a substantial amount of games was the 2015-16 season. The injury-prone tag is overblown.   &gt;The point which just zoomed over your head is that if you trade every young player because they haven't accomplished anything yet, you will be sorry.  You *might be sorry. Good thing they won though.  &gt;More to the point, even before 2020, they were exactly on their historic pace of 2.5 Rings per decade in this century. So, you are talking absolute nonsense.  If you mean before the Davis trade, they weren't. At all. But now with him, they have a real chance to achieve that 2.5 average. Good on them.  &gt;Not only that, but they could've traded for, say, Jimmy Butler instead of Davis. Butler was traded for peanuts, in comparison, and James/Ball/Butler/Ingram/Zubac and some of that bench wins easily in 2020. In this case, the Lakers retain substantially all of the assets they spent to rent Davis.  Even _if_ the wolves wanted to lend us a hand, that's a starting 5 with even worse shooting. Zubac wouldn't have been there, either.  &gt; It already looks very questionable, and can only get worse. Some of those first-round picks are still years away -- exactly when the Lakers will need them, by the way.  No, it looks great. They won the chip and would've had a great chance at repeating if not for freak injuries. Need them? Nah, their window to compete is now. Wouldn't matter later on.  &gt;And a questionable motor, to boot.  Not really. I hope you're not basing that on this injury-riddled year and post-season lol. Cause that would be too ridiculous. Even with the post-season he was getting back to his dominant self in games 2 and 3.  &gt;That said, Deng was a 31 year-old 2-time All-star. 4 x $16m was not at all outrageous.   Except if you actually watched Deng the year prior, you would absolutely know that that was outrageous. I like how you mention ""all-star"" too as if that was even somehow relevant to the time of the signing lol.  &gt;that's probably too much to spend for one ring.  Only if you have other options. Which they didn't. That roster you that claimed would be a favorited contender (that was supposedly even better than some of James' past championship teams) is nonsense. You could literally do a multi-part video series on how they'd be picked apart by the other contenders in the playoffs."
LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard.  Arguably the 2 greatest small forward of the post Jordan Era.  Another thing about playoff wins is that you usually have to have long series to accumulate those wins.  And did I say that Lue was a bad coach.  No I just said he was getting outcoached in this series.  Also I love how you go to my team like that's relevant in a conversation between the Jazz and Clippers.  Sit down.  Butthurt fan.
"&gt;I don't even know what point your trying to make with the assist because he clearly plays better with lebron off the floor   The point is that Schroder is one of the better point guards in the league, and the ones who are clearly better cost far more, and far more than the Lakers could hope to afford.  They few they could afford are not on the market anyway.  &gt;which is evident in his increase in assist.  This happens because he handles the ball more.  I cannot believe I just had to explain that.  When James and Davis are on the floor, they often isolate, which is not conducive to anyone else being credited with an assist.  &gt; With lebron, hes gonna have the ball less and he can't space the floor.   There are multiple ways to space the floor -- shooting threes is not the only one.  Schroder stresses defenses with his quickness, which forces defenders to help, and creates space for drive-and-dish layups, which are among the best plays in basketball.  &gt;Its really not that deep.  Maybe you're understanding is just a little too shallow."
"I only know LeBron James and the Lakers. I don't know anything else about basketball. They put it in for people like me. I thought, ""oh wow playing the finals. Are the yellow purple guys gonna win?"" And boom, got my answer."
"&gt;why are you asking questions if you don't care about the answers?  Because hella ppl keep claiming that the warriors were saved by the CP3 injury when theres hella evidence against CP3.  I agree Iggy isn't as important as Paul. But you can't ignore his impact in the playoffs. We were up 2-1 before he went down. Games 4 and 5 were hella close and if he played, I bet we win at least one of those games and very possibly take both and finish 4-1. Not to mention he held James and CP to an awful 1/40 efficiency in the 1st 3 games. And we saw how he balled against the rockets in 2019: the warriors also needed a historic game from Iggy to close out the Rockets in game 6 in 2019 which is further evidence of how crucial he is. Luc has never shown the kind of playoff impact that Iggy has.   You're mentioning that players change from year to year, but you ignore that players can change from game to game too. It's very likely Paul chokes in games 6 and 7 even if he plays given the Rockets and his history of coming up short in the playoffs especially against the Warriors. When you can't beat a KD-less warriors in your home floor where you're favored by 6.5 pts, how can anyone expect you to beat a locked in warriors team WITH KD?   Players and teams do have up and down years, but a true championship type player/team will usually make up for a down regular season in the playoffs (like the warriors, lebron led teams, kobe lakers, chicago bulls, pop spurs, etc have). The rockets have utterly failed in that regard."

Make it longer with LeBron ‚ÄúKing‚Äù James and the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lebron just wants to recruit everyone on his team.   It‚Äôs just annoying seeing this era of ‚Äúplayer empowerment‚Äù where it‚Äôs become more about the player than the team.  It wasn‚Äôt the Cavs - it was just Lebron James and friends. That‚Äôs not even a team - it was just a placeholder for Lebron to play.   I miss the days when the team and team work was more important than any one player. Now it‚Äôs all about feeding these huge egos these stars have and not hurting their feelings etc.
Jerry West is more like Lebron James entire Cle career &amp; CP3 is nowhere near that level.

"That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt respect any of James hardens, Chris Paul‚Äôs, lebron James games at all. And all the new stars. Their iq is off the charts but to me they play with no sportsmanship at all and are always looking to exploit rules. Yesterday Paul drew a foul on jokic and when jokic did the same thing right back next play he was whining and complaining to the refs. So even he knows that a bull shit it seems why do it. I know it‚Äôs gamesmanship but the way these stars play I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good sportsmanship."
Why Compare to Lebron James in the 2000s?
"When it comes to being a one man offense, James harden‚Äôs only competition is lebron james. And when it comes to being an iso scorer, again his only competition is Jordan, james, Kobe, and like Durant."
"One of the ways is obviously through time, he‚Äôs a top 2 player of all time who has been playing forever so he‚Äôll get a lot of it from just experience.   Said to have a photographic memory.   Plenty of stories of him calling out opponents plays. Huge one was a player (think someone on the Raptors) wasn‚Äôt in his spot and Lebron told him where he needed to be. They say he studies every player and knows everything about them, whether its the superstar or the last guy on the bench.   Gets praise about his IQ not only from all the coaches he‚Äôs played for, but from opposing coaches! And it‚Äôs not uncommon for him at all.   One of his biggest strengths on defense is his ability to play ‚Äúfree safety‚Äù, huge part Bc of his defensive IQ. Knows where to rotate, when to help, who is where, etc.   Being able to still be a top 3 player in the league at his age is also largely Bc of his basketball IQ.   And that‚Äôs mostly just defense. We can clearly see what he does on offense.   Just googling ‚ÄúLebron James basketball IQ‚Äù brings up so many articles Bc it‚Äôs been discussed so much. Pretty sure it‚Äôs widely accepted by the majority that he has the best basketball IQ of all time (even the haters have said it). The comment above is honestly the only time I‚Äôve ever seen anyone say/imply that someone else has a higher basketball IQ than bron, but in threads in this sub, everyone usually tends to lean on whatever side the OP is on.    &amp; I say all of this while not even being a Bron fan.  Anything you can say about cp3s basketball IQ. The same can be said for Bron and more. Only thing I‚Äôd put CP3 over Bron is leadership, but I wouldn‚Äôt consider that basketball IQ."
"""I think Lebron James is gonna have a great game and the Lakers are gonna pull this one out"" - Charles Barkley"
His very first sentence says he's the best floor raiser not named LeBron James. He's literally mentioned in the first sentence of the post.
"IMO, he‚Äôs a better floor general than LeBron( he just lacks the size to impose his will the same way James does. Unlike James, Paul‚Äôs teammates actually develop because the ball moves and they are allowed to do more than shoot corner 3‚Äôs. Look no further than OKC and now Phoenix.   James had a promising crop of young talent and noped them out of LA. Had those guys had an opportunity to develop, they‚Äôd have been in far better shape going forward"
"The best at elevating his team in NBA history other than LeBron James? Look, the guy is an excellent player but that's an absurd take. He's 35 years old and the only time he's gotten out of the second round, he wasn't even the best player on his team."
"That‚Äôs the difference between reports and analysts like Tim Legler, Jalen rose and mike Prada and Skip bayless.  Skip will say Lebron James is overrated for not driving to the basket each and every play. But a seasoned reporter/analyst with basketball knowledge will say ‚Äúwhen the Suns have all their eyes on Lebron and have 5 sitting in the paint to take away the paint from Lebron because they know the Lakers don‚Äôt have reliable three point shooters or anyone who can create off the dribble.‚Äù  This is why you can‚Äôt listen to clowns like Skip"

But until seeing his performance in the 2016 finals, I didn't know the game could be played at such a high level.      He's mad corny and unnecessarily theatrical, but god damn if he is not the greatest player I've ever seen. I'll stan him to the end."
"interesting...  I think your second round seems right to me, but that means:  \- Suns have LeBron and Jokic  \- Clippers have Luka and I think Gobert (over Ja)  \- Sixers have Beal and Trae (over Randle)  \- Nets have Tatum and Giannis  I say the Suns and Nets win. So my WCF champ would be the suns:  C Nikola Jokic  PF LeBron James  SF Kawhi Leonard  SG Devin Booker  PG Chris Paul  vs the ECF Champ, the Nets  C Joel Embiid  PF Giannis Antetokounmpo  SF Kevin Durant  SG James Harden  PG Kyrie Irving  6th man: Jayson Tatum  &amp;#x200B;  I think the Suns actually win with their playmaking, but thats a clash of the titans - especially with the the front court scoring and back court defense of the Nets."
Thinking LeBron James and a random usher should make the same amount is braindead. You think that? Lmfao.

I know these playoffs are fast and good but I feel like we arent appreciating the randomness of Jae Crowder of all people to out play LeBron James and finally take him out first round while salsa dancing to taunt him
Breaking: LeBron James drafted 1st overall in 2003 NBA draft
"The point is that the challenges are as  close to ""normie"" as possible to reach a wider audience. Here we have world class top of his field athlete LeBron James getting beat in one of the challenges by his very average wife. I think that's the whole point"
"It really isn‚Äôt. If you were as good at basketball as you are at hating, you‚Äôd be lebron James."
"""I watch him work out before every single game. I know Carmelo Anthony, Lebron James, and Dwayne Wade are going to be great, but I'm going to go out on a limb and tell you this kid is going to be a special player"" - Doc Rivers  This was in his rookie year during the finals when Darko was the youngest player in the league."
"Can LeBron James catch up to Trae Young in the GOAT rankings, or is it too late?"
"The Celtics played more than 60 games without Kyrie over the 2 years he was in Boston, they had a better record without him than with him and they made a deeper playoff run the year he was hurt than when he was healthy.  Prior to that, he was in Cleveland where the Cavs were a dumpster fire before LeBron came home.  Some of that isn't on Kyrie but he was the #1 overall pick, if he's a superstar then he should be able to get some results, they never won more than 33 games in a season before LeBron came back.  Last season with Brooklyn, the Nets were 8-12 with Kyrie and 27-25 without him.  How many seasons of data do you need?  What's he done without LeBron James or Kevin Durant as a teammate?"

Also I find it interesting that of the people you named, you got most of the top in the league but missed a few.

Steph Curry has had a bigger influence on basketball than LeBron James
"Wow so much to say  1) The most vibrant outfit is Devonte Graham dressed all in black wearing a bright  puffy vest...how is that the most vibrant outfit in the NBA? I see fucking middle aged suburban women rocking that shit daily  2) The freshest pregame outfit is Blake Griffin in a pair of sweat shorts with a black long sleve shirt and some Joradans on. Meanwhile Deni Avdija's worst outfit is...shorts and a t-shirt with a pair of white sneakers. So apparently the voters in this poll are both impressed and offended by the most basic shit you can wear pregame? Talk about schizophrenic.  3) Meanwhile one of the hardest to pull off outfits is...Deandre Ayton in...a denim jacket and jeans with a black shirt. Dudes come on that shit is so basic how can you not pull that off.  Or Cedi Osman in...a white jacket with a hoodie and skinny jeans. Like what?  4) Apparently LeBron James wearing a denim jacket and black jeans is...edgy? Ummm ok. Seems pretty basic to me.   5) Back to vibrancy. Josh Jackson is the most vibrant in the NBA rocking....a flannel shirt, beanie, black tee and black skinny jeans. Have these people ever been to Portland or Seattle or Brooklyn? Or like..any rural area? Jeans, tee, flannel and beanie isn't vibrant it's fucking basic fall clothing. Also apparently just wearing a bright hoodie with black pants makes you vibrant?   I gotta stop now but this shit is wack dudes."
"Lebron James, I know he's out of the playoffs now but in 4 years when he's 40 and hitting his 11th prime. Guys gonna be a problem."
"Lebron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard are all better so no. I would say Jokic is better too. Joel Embiid and Luka Doncic have a great argument too."
"&gt; Kyrie - first overall pick who was already an all star at 22.   And Clyde was a still-excellent star who could also play defense.    &gt;The fact that he couldn‚Äôt carry the cavs doesn‚Äôt really matter, because neither could James.  At 21 LeBron led a garbage team to 50-32, and at 22 took his team to the finals.  What the fuck are you talking about?    &gt; Already addressed kuzma elsewhere. Lebron was actually looking for kawhi, who was a young finals mvp in 2018.  ""Player hopes his team can land other good players: news at 11!""  &gt; Lol Karl Malone was 40 on the lakers  And put up 20/8/5 the year before at age 39.   Ray Allen was nearly that old and Mike Miller couldn't walk.  Why you looking so hard to make excuses for other situations that you would criticize LeBron for?  &gt; In every example I used they ‚Äúall came from different teams,‚Äù In none of those instances were any of the 2 players already together.   By your previous standards LeBron and Kuzma (rofl) were ""already together"" before AD joined.    &gt; Lebron was years younger when he went back to CLE, and years before that he already had made ‚Äúthe decision‚Äù to go to MIA. Years in the NBA is intentionally misleading or being obtuse.  Years in the league doesn't matter?   Okay...  &gt; Players don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúonly play for the team they were drafted to‚Äù, and you obviously know this.   Your opinion seems to be that if the master doesn't make it happen it's bad.   Master tells me what to do = natural order of things.  I choose to change jobs = unnatural and evil.   &gt;hit up that banana boat because you‚Äôre afraid to compete   Ah, so you are one of those people."
"I think he does have that potential though. And people aren't going and like putting Luka above Jokic/Lebron/Harden/Curry/KD etc. He's being compared to comparable players.   Dame has definitely been better so far this year, but Luka was probably more impactful and played better in the playoffs last year. It's definitely an argument on who you'd rather have going forward this season in the playoffs.  Considering that lots of people still would take Lillard over Luka, I feel like both guys overall are getting the respect from fans and the media. Jalen Rose was rating Lillard over Curry in the preseason.  EDIT: On the other hand, James Harden is playing insanely efficient basketball while still having tremendous numbers and Beal/Irving gets voted in as a starter over him, and no one bats an eye. Harden is one of the 5 best players in the league right now."
Nah there's stories about LeBron getting rejected from clubs first cleveland stint  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/12/30/16833586/lebron-james-rejected-club

Have you ever watched this guy named lebron james play?
Joel Embiid  Damian Lillard  Nikola Jokic  Stephen Curry  LeBron James/Kawhi Leonard
"Who you gonna call?!  Rajon Rondo!  Now being serious: imagine the quality of a basketball discussion between LeBron James and Rajon Rondo  Off the charts. I never read anything directly about it, but I believe LeBron must have the utmost respect for Rondo. Such a great mind of the game."
"Well, the offense was LeBron James.  Dude has no weapons.  Yes I know that the he needs more help meme, but this is a top heavy Laker team."
"1980‚Äôs were the single most difficult era to play basketball. Every team was stacked. There were many many super teams at any one time. You had the Lakers and the Celtics who just kicked the crap out of everyone with Hall of Famers or all stars at almost every position. Then you had the Sixers and the Bucks at the beginning of the decade who were again, full of Hall of Fame and All-Star talent. Towards the end of the decade, the Bulls, Pistons, Knicks, Rockets, Jazz, Hawks, Pacers, Cavs, and Mavs were on the rise. It was a far more talent rich league than it was when Lebron entered the league. Right now, I would say the talent pool is fairly close to where it was then, but that‚Äôs only a fairly recent development. During the expansion era, the league got significantly watered down.   The rules were also different. A flagrant 2 now would be a common foul. Guys would maul the crap out of Lebron to send a message, especially if he entered the league then with the type of hype he entered the league in our timeline. Hand checking was allowed, zone D was forbidden, and ISO basketball wasn‚Äôt as prevalent.   Here‚Äôs a list of players Bird usually had to match up with  Magic Johnson: HOF  Dr. J: HOF  Adrian Dantley: HOF  Dominique Wilkins: HOF  Alex English: HOF  Charles Barkley: HOF  James Worthy: HOF  Bernard King: HOF  Bobby Jones: HOF  Marques Johnson: Should be in the HOF  Who has Lebron had to guard who was that level? KD, Paul Pierce, and Kawhi? Maybe Prime T-Mac early on? Come on man. Bird was a phenomenal player and so is Lebron, but to say the era Bird played in was bad is just revisionist history."
"Drummond isnt on anywhere close to the same level as AD  Also its a volatile situation between the League and Dan Gilbert with the latter a constant threat to the entire operation. They push him to hard, he will go to press with evidence of everything from fixing games, to the CP3-Lakers situation, and of course the LeBron James saga. The NBA will become the WWE overnight. Andre Drummond isn‚Äôt worth that"
So a team with Anthony Davis and Lebron James fresh off winning a title ain‚Äôt a favorite?
"Other end on the block,    Hustles back to the action,    Doesn't give up on the play,    With his eye on the prize,    Gets back into the picture,    Comes up with the exclamation mark,    Says to Lebron James ""Not on my watch.""   Mamma, there goes that man,    Big time De-fensive play BY BAM"

That‚Äôs because one is draymond green and the other is Lebron James
because lakers have ad and lebron james
If you have Lebron James you are a very good team
If you think they are going to go winless with AD out you are out of your mind. They still have Lebron James. They are good enough to beat the crappy teams in the league.
It‚Äôs clearly going to be Embiid because he‚Äôs clearly the best player (or in a near tie with Jokic) and his team has a good record.  LeBron James is just not the best regular season player in the NBA anymore.

Imagine not giving LeBron james the ball with a full shot clock and only down 2. Like actually who else on earth would you want to have the ball in that situation? All you need is to hand it to him and he walk it to the rim. Nobody can stop him doing that...

Bernard King  I know that people are going to ask me about Scottie Pippen, so I‚Äôll just say that I think Pippen is one of the more overrated players in NBA history. Pippen is probably somewhere around 15th, as I consider Kawhi, James Worthy, Paul Pierce, Nique, and a few others to have been significantly better players in their respective eras than Pippen was. Pippen got boosted up by being Jordan‚Äôs second option. Great defender and an efficient scorer, but could never be the lead guy on a great team."

"I love Steph, but KD was the best player on that team. He was better than everyone in the league not named LeBron James."
Maybe he just constantly gets fouled at the rim because he‚Äôs Lebron James?
"Most people know this. They choose to ignore it whenever it suits them. MVP is not some quantum physics problem that needs to be solved. Everyone knows what MVP is in the NBA it's the same thing as it always has been, the same thing as it is in the other four sports.   In the NFL the last time the MVP won the SB was Kurt Warner in 1999. No one ever says Brady should win the MVP every year and he's actually been more successful than LeBron James."
"Do I think that he has been the best player over the last eight years cumulatively? Absolutely.   Do I think he has been the best player every single won of the past eight years? And thus deserved MVP every year but didn't get it because of ""voter fatigue"" (again quoting them, not making shit up) absolutely not.   There has not been one MVP that was awarded over the last eight years that was undeserved imo. If the Sixers and the Lakers play and Kuzma drops a game high 45 points he's the player of the game. Doesn't mean he is better than James, Davis, Embiid, Simmons etc. Just means he was the best player in that game.   Giannis was the best last year, Steph was the best during his MVP seasons, Rose had a better claim to the MVP when he won it, but no one, not even Rose, would tell you that he was a better player than Heat LeBron.   So SVG says he has been the best player in the league the past eight years and that has to be true the was he says it, because if the answer is just one player it's definitely LeBron. But then he talks about him winning MVP every year if not for voter fatigue and it makes you think he meant Bron was the best player every single year and everyone else who won are frauds."
"We have tons of players with that mentality, like Lebron James, Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, Brad Wanamaker, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, ect ect."

"I see Larry Bird's best comp as LeBron James, except you have to turn the athleticism way up on Bird, and the shooting way up on James.  Other than that they played pretty similarly."
"It's a good question, but if LeBron plays every game, that's a huge advantage for him. I'm just refuting the point that it would be ""a LeBron James memorial award"" or something, like he wouldn't deserve it. Players missing games, players not being high enough seeded have always been factors in awards like these."
"That would matter if they were basing things based on things that are happening this year. They are not. LeBron James isn't going to get less old, nor will he be less great over the past eight years. The only real hope is that the Lakers fall out of the top three in the West. Which is possible considering the injury to Davis."

"I really think that Reddit sub for some reason reached some mental level of delusion about this subject. I don't even know what is the problem with actual play of LeBron James, cause they are not saying it. Like... he's playing great guys? I don't even get it at which point it's being disagreed with. Which part is he doing badly at? All I hear precisely is just that ""he has media support"" and ""Embiid is clearly better"" (ok thanks for the elaboration)."
If you read the headline Lebron James and Steph Curry together which is true. The NBA twitter feed mentions Western and Eastern in that post which is a starter pool from both conferences. I did not say at any point that it is a West and East thing. Thank you for correction if anything.
"Joel Embiid leads LeBron James in all major statistical categories except, obviously, for assists. Embiid is shooting better from all areas of the court including the free throw line. James' Lakers are 22-8 second seed in the West, Embiid's Sixers are 20-10 first in the East. Embiid beat James head to head on ESPN in their only meeting to date. Embiid has missed six games this season, James none.   Surely, there must be something I missed."
....so lebron james?
Change his name to Lebron James.
"That's *exactly* what it is. Windhorst: The narrative (that me and my co-workers started weeks ago) might be too strong to not give it to LeBron. It's been going on all year and it's crazy. They're basically gaslighting the entire NBA community into making us believe what we're seeing isn't actually what's happening. James' stats are not close to his best or close to better than Embiid, Jokic, Durant, Curry, or Leonard's. But his name is always brought up first and many times only in regards to the award."
‚ÄúLeBron James intends to eat Kyrie Irving and absorb his powers‚Äù      -Kristaps Porzingis
"Brain Windhorst, the author of this article, already said on The Jump that he was voting for LeBron purely for narrative reasons. Here, he is again using the biggest sports platform in the world to declare that LeBron should win, again primarily for narrative reasons.   After people on this sub told me I was seeing things or had a victim complex or whatever; I appreciate the fact that he is not only not hiding his desire to see James win the MVP and influence others in his field to vote for him as well, but more importantly that he specifically lists the ""narrative"" as the primary reason he is and others should do so."
"Hopefully his back gets better and better as we get farther removed from the *hard foul* he took in the Lakers game. He's still going to miss some games for rest because he's not 6'8"" LeBron James he's 7'2"" 280 lbs. Joel Embiid. Honestly, James at 36 should probably not be playing every game either.   But on a broader point, in a year where there is a condensed schedule, and players are missing games for reasons largely out of their control, if a player is significantly ahead of the pack in terms of MVP and his team is a top two seed missed games (as long as it's not too many) should not be held against anyone as much as it would be in a regular season. Whether or not Embiid is far ahead of James statically is a matter of personal opinion."
"That is not stacked  Stacked is  MVP LeBron James  FMVP Dwyane Wade  AllNBA Chris Bosh  Ray Allen  ALL NBA Kevin Love  Kyrie Irving  Tristan Thompson  Jr Smith  Kyle Korver  MVP AND DPOY CANDIDATE /ALLNBA Anthony Davis  Kyle Kuzma  Rajon Rondo  KCP  Former DPOY Marc Gasol  6MOY CAN DENNIS  6MOY MONTREZL  Caruso  Etc  Vs   Patrick Bev, EG, Danuel House, PJ Tucker, Ryan Anderson... lol.

"I actually finished control last night great atmosphere if you're into the SCP foundation terrible game tho. You need to finish the DLC to actually see the ending and idc I'm not playing another second.     1. How can you slander him for his game 4 performance when 2 days prior he had 45 points on 22 shots? Hell he had 3 less rebounds then Dwight Howard that game. Harden definitely stunk it up in game 5, but no Rocket player outside of Harden scored more then 20 at any point in that series so it was pretty much guaranteed to happen. Especially considering the Warriors built a super team on their coaching staff that year.    The following series Lebron went 13-33 with 6 turnovers in the series clinching game 6, but he gets a pass because the warriors had a better roster?    2.  &gt; Most of his tenure in Rockets, he had the team completely designed to his strengths as a ball handler with a coach that made him the center of the offense unlike any other player in the history of the league thus far.     And thats what elevates him so much in my eyes. Every trip up the floor you know its a Harden isolation coming, but you cant do anything to stop it. Hes literally a playshot in 2K only in real life against the greatest players on the planet.     He scored 30 in 32 straight games (28 in the game that broke the streak after coming back from an injury against an Atlanta team that seemed determinedto end the streak) with this playstyle. The story of MJ telling guys what he was going to do them before hand is basically what Harden did during this streak and it didn't matter. They went 21-11 during that run with him playing like this.   3. If high level versatility doesn't make you great what does? Thats like saying the Model S isn't a great car when it has a higher top speed, acceleration, horsepower and features then just about every other car out there.   He has one of the most complete offensive games ever, the only thing missing is a post up game, but thats redundant with his current play style.    I'm not disagreeing with you about playoff success, but im also not blinding screaming ""Ringz Chuck "" like I'm Shaq. Everyone you mentioned had at least 2 team mates better then James Hardens best team mate ( 2018 CP3?) This is the first year since he's become a starter, that his team is truly a contender and its not a case of the team going as far as he drags them kicking and screaming. Over the next 3 or 4 years we'll get to see who Harden really is the post season when he's not able to he double and triple teamed every trip down the floor."
Dwight was a monster. 3 time DPOY and the sole engine on that Magic team. Really really tough question.  I think Dwight was a better defender by far and more unstoppable in the post. But he can't shoot free throws or anything outside like 6 feet.   I'm going to give it to Dwight because he beat a Lebron James led team in the conference finals and went to the finals.  If Embiid wins or makes a finals I think he moves up.
Is brendan Hayward LeBron James?
damn regular season james harden balled the fuck out the last couple of years     the playoffs is insane tho just fucking michael jordan and lebron james everywhere lol
it means lebron james is on your basketball team
We can believe in them all we want. Does the team have a player named Lebron James? Well unfortunately every team with the player named Lebron James has made the finals 10/11 years.
"In person: I was there for LeBron James [getting his chin above the rim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-kolNcY53s).  He also scored 20 points in the first quarter vs. the Blazers in this game, put it in cruise control after and finished with 41/11/8 or something like that.   On TV: Game 6 of the 2008 NBA Finals.  The Celtics beat the Lakers like a rented mule and rampaged to the championship. ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE!!!!"
"Well if Embiid misses time from LeBron injuring him, it seems z bit fucked to give James the MVP"
"Based off comments like this and others, any reasonable person from the outside looking in would think Lebron James is coasting entirely off reputation and his team isn't competitive whatsoever.   Yet Lebron is putting up 26/8/8 on the 2nd best team record wise in the league. You people make it seem like it's entirely political. Its entirely the media! /s. You guys are no different than the people saying its clearly Lebron whose MVP.   The reality is that it's a close race with Embiid in the lead and guys like Lebron, KD and Dame falling closely behind.   Why do people gotta be so extreme with their takes. Either its CLEARLY Embiid or its CLEARLY Lebron and anything else is fake news."
basketball is dumb if you don't have lebron james tbh
"&gt;I mean I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre throwing LeBron in here now.  Nah I meant to type Dame. Harden/James/Dame got it mixed up. Didn't mean Lebron.  &gt;Curry doesn‚Äôt fit that mold at all and the average fan is unsure of how to assess him because of it.  I think this is true for the people who are stanning him too, though, because they will talk about all the positives of his off ball movement while completely neglecting how it can be detrimental to not have your best player with the ball in his hands. This is what the Warriors flairs were going on about to start the season when there was no Draymond. Overall it has worked great for him but he's also had all time great teammates that fit him perfectly, hence the emphasis of talking about.  I can't think of a single person that would prefer Lillard or Harden or anyone of that caliber *not* have the ball in his hands. Harden is on a team with KD and Kyrie on it, yet everyone including KD and Kyrie want him to have the ball in his hands. There's a reason for that.  I don't think it's a gap. I never said it was a gap. What I said was that, in reference to what Chris Haynes said, I think that guys who are especially dominant on ball will have a harder time getting more efficient shots which makes what Dame and Harden are doing all the more amazing. That paired with how much they create for their team and punish defenses rather than have a Draymond do it is more impressive.  &amp;#x200B;  As for the playoff bit, Dame never had the same situation as Curry. It's not fair to look at him being ""shut down"" and use that as a reason. If you put Dame on a team with Klay, Draymond, Andre, etc and obviously the KD iteration of the Warriors, that doesn't happen. And that's another annoying thing about talking about Steph is the team gets discredited **so** frequently; it sounds like people argue that Steph did it all on his own or something.  &amp;#x200B;  The game the other night where Dray had 16 assists and 1 turnover was completely washed away by Curry stanning"

"‚Äú I got a goal, and it's a huge goal, and that's to bring an NBA championship here to Cleveland, and I won't stop until I get it.‚Äù  - LeBron James before leaving Cleveland for the first time.   These quotes aren‚Äôt a big deal. They‚Äôre competitive people."
How dare Danny send him to play with LeBron James instead of paying him $100+ million and crippling the team financially
"&gt;	That isn't at all what's happening though, and I could just as easily say that maneuvering off ball isn't the holy grail of defensive attention. There are massive benefits to having your superstar be on ball and whether or not you want to admit it there are also disadvantages to being so heavily offball.  Come on, man. No one argues for off ball movement as the holy grail. Modern basketball has focused on and favored the wing sized player that dictates the game, basically what you‚Äôre arguing. MJ, Kobe, LeBron. Those are the prototypical players that most fans are used to. Curry doesn‚Äôt fit that mold at all and the average fan is unsure of how to assess him because of it.   &gt;	And the point of all this is to highlight how guys like Harden and James are just as efficient while ALSO doing the Draymond role of controlling the offebse.  I mean I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre throwing LeBron in here now. He‚Äôs in his own tier. He‚Äôs the only one that legitimately does a better version of what Draymond does as a passer/facilitator on top of being a scorer. Harden does not do what Draymond does at all. Harden facilitates out of isolation and ball screens and he‚Äôs an all time great at it. Draymond is basically a 6‚Äô5‚Äù post offense passing big with almost no scoring ability. I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre conflating the two because that‚Äôs not even the point of this.   I‚Äôll just leave it at this because there are different things being argued here, but clearly there are people who view Stephs work off ball as this wholly dependent thing.  It‚Äôs a feature, not a gap in his game. The final year of Mjax‚Äôs tenure on the Warriors, Steph averaged 8.5 assists in an isolation and ball screen heavy offense. Kerr got hired the next year, got Steph off the ball more and made use of guys like Bogut and Draymond to be the hub of the offense and they became an all time team because of it.   Look what happens to guys like Dame when they come up against good defenses in the playoffs. They get him to give up the ball early and force the others around him to make decisions. Yeah, Dame can split a double and hit deep shots but those options become limited against the best teams."
LeBron James literally said he would win 7 championships with the Heat.
"Are you dense? Find me some LeBron James championship guarantees, or Kobe, or Timmy, or Steph.   Or, or, or, or, or....."
Lakers LeBron James without any other context: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a huge food truck guy.‚Äù Says he rushed home from practice to watch the premier of Chef.
"&gt;Kyrie makes it a thing and now we got to talk about it.

Shaq, Webber, Blake Griffin, Giannis, and Cousins didn't take tech free throws."
Because he is kinda disappointing he was a number 1 pick with the tools to become the next lebron james and has become instead supercharged draymond green

Does Shannon forget that LeBron has some of the best playoff clutch stats of all time and constantly raves about GOAT JAMES
"Sprite, because my name is Lebron James xD"
"Because he wants to.  According to Tom Haberstroh, LeBron stopped taking most technical free throws [after getting laughed at for missing one](http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/page/presents19409872/fifteen-feet-trouble) in a game against Charlotte in December 2016.  &gt; There are better options available to the Cavs -- like, for example, four-time All-Star Kevin Love, a career 82 percent free throw shooter. &gt;  &gt; But this is alpha dog territory, and James has flexed his superstar status in moments like this before. Consider the 2010-11 Heat, which many consider the most alpha dog team ever. That season James, a career 74 percent free throw shooter at the time, shot 15 T's, while Dwyane Wade (77 percent) took one and Chris Bosh (80 percent) took zero. James made just 10 of the 15. &gt;  &gt; Hornets fans should be delighted to see James at the line. When he shoots technical free throws, his accuracy gets markedly worse. In fact, among the 104 shooters since 1996 with at least 100 technical attempts to their name, James ranks as the worst, converting just 67 percent of his 248 tries, per NylonCalculus.com tracking. &gt;  &gt; Even still, Love does what so many of James' teammates have done before: He steps aside and lets James take a crack at it. The referee passes LeBron the ball, and he begins his elaborate routine. He places the ball on his left hip and blows into his right fist as if to reignite a dimming ember. Then he lines up his toes on the line, dribbles three times, spins the ball in his left hand, steps backward with his left foot, rocks back, rocks forward, plants his left foot back on the line. He bends his knees. He looks up at the rim. He shoots. &gt;  &gt; The shot falls short, bouncing off the front rim with a thud, the ball plopping right in front of James. He slaps it away while the Charlotte crowd collectively cheers and laughs at him. Few things electrify a crowd like an opposing star's missed technical free throw. &gt;  &gt; James seems oddly rattled at the line this night. Earlier, in the first quarter, he had actually tripped in the middle of his free throw routine during that same unorthodox step-back, planting his foot too early and knocking himself off balance. &gt;  &gt; Which helps to explain why James, in this moment, is visibly frustrated. This is his seventh technical free throw of the season, almost halfway to his career average of 18 per season -- and this one apparently cuts deep. No one knows it at the time, but with 50 games remaining, it will mark the last technical free throw that James will take in the 2016-17 season. &gt;  &gt; James, like never before, has given up."
"Yeah I can. Firstly, I‚Äôm sorry every nba prospect isn‚Äôt lebron James, and some guys take time to develop. He‚Äôs a good defender and showed signs of being able to guard the perimeter at a high level. He has shown flashes of being able to play make for himself and others - I‚Äôll admit his shooting wasn‚Äôt great but he played 7 games. If you judged billups on his first 7 games, according to you he‚Äôs a bust too, give the young guys some time before you jump to conclusions"
"Saying he had the tools to be the best ever is very different from expecting the stars to align in his favor to be the best ever. Anyone saying they expected 17 year old Lebron James to be the greatest basketball player ever was delusional, not prophetic."
"I can think of an excuse. It's called LeBron James and Anthony Davis. The Jazz can reach their full potential but it probably won't matter when they're up against two superstars in a 7-game series. If you don't like what I'm saying, I don't either. But take it up with history."
"Ernie: ""You got your eyes on LeBron."" Shaq: ""No, I got my eyes on James"""
The annual Lebron James teams mid year slump   It's like fucking clockwork
"I usually see it as someone who's capable to doing quick cuts to the basket and finishing at a high rate. James Worthy was a great slasher and worked beautifully with Magic. Other great slashers that I remember: Marion, Dwade (2011-2013 with Lebron) and the list goes on. It's usually a wing player who doesn't need the ball that much to get buckets."
"Ja Morant, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Zion Williamson, Lebron James"
"First of all I didn‚Äôt realize marc gasol was gonna be an all star this year. And no Kd is not better at Lebron at almost everything stop being so stupid please. Lebron is a better finisher, passer, defender, rebounder and literally everything I can think of other than shooter (which Kd is a fair amount ahead of Lebron)  And u wouldn‚Äôt want Lebron James passing the ball in a pick and roll lmao. At this point u just proved to me ur either a troll or just beyond stupid. Lebron u could argue is the best pick and roll passer ever (not saying he‚Äôs the best passer but his scoring threat opens up more passes than players like magic and stockton)  And yes I agree that the Kd Curry pick and roll would be unstoppable and a lethal offensive go to. But Lebron Curry pick and roll would even surpass that and would be the best pick and roll ever and by a wide margin  And ya I‚Äôm not surprised at this point u think Kd is better than Lebron lmao"
"So ignoring all the arbitrary statlines, the only point they made that was actually meaningful was this,  &gt;With 901 career playoff points in 44 games, Tatum was tied with LeBron James for second place on the list of most postseason points by a player before his 23rd birthday. Kobe Bryant ranks first with 1,264 points.  Now instead of looking at totals, let's look at it on a per game basis. By 23, Tatum was averaging 20.5 points a game in the playoffs. LeBron was averaging 27.5 in a slower era, does that seem close to you?   How about instead of all these cherrypicked statlines, we look at LeBron and Tatum's numbers per game at age Tatum is now, and then we'll judge how comparable they really are."
"I was asking about the GOAT Lakers, I was more asking like which player peaked the highest while on the Lakers. I‚Äôd argue LeBron James peak is Miami for sure."
"Any combo? Okay. Here‚Äôs three lineups I‚Äôm confident could win  Offense:  Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Kevin Durant, Oscar Robertson  Defense:  Tim Duncan, Michael Jordan, Gary Payton  Modern:  Anthony Davis(uninjured), LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo"
Could Lebron and Jordan take on James and Michael?
It's this ESPN article from 2011:  https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/25570/how-lebron-james-and-dwyane-wade-run
"I mean, it's LeBron damn James. I don't know if they're ""3rd"", to me it's more like there's that upper tier of the Jazz, Clippers and Lakers that all occupy the same space, even if some have better records than others. Come playoffs, we'll see who is better at turning on the jets and playing at that highest level, and I don't think anything is for certain there yet."
You telling me 36 years old Lebron james like most hated sports figure for about a decade got his feelings hurt because of one line He prolly forgot now lol
"Lebron ""Despite the Loss"" James"
"The Millenial generation has been blessed with watching Tom Brady, Kobe Bryant, and Lebron James go from drafted kids to legacy HOF players."
"The lakers are coming off the shortest post season of all time. Calm down. People complain about Stepha A but act like him. And James harden can no longer claim he is from La , let lebron chase his ass out the west . He literally got chased out . Type of shit is this"
"Everyone‚Äôs job is optional. Nobody HAS to do their job. Most NBA players aren‚Äôt LeBron James. Some really need the minimum contracts they‚Äôre getting now and in the next few years. If they don‚Äôt go into work they don‚Äôt get paid. They are entertaining a hundreds of millions of people around the world. What they do is important and they can‚Äôt just stay home.  Do they deserve to get it before frontline heathcare workers, no! But to dismiss them compared to so many other people that are now eligible for it but aren‚Äôt in the same work conditions they‚Äôre in is what confuses me.   People that are working from home are less of a health risk to others and to themselves...cause they‚Äôre at home and not traveling. Just cause they‚Äôre rich there‚Äôs this bias against them I think."
"&gt; If Damian Lillard or James Harden was averaging 25ppg/8apg on 59% TS on the 3rd seed he would be getting 0 MVP consideration.  Hmm.  **Dame averaged 27ppg/7apg on 59% TS on the 3rd seed in 2018 and got MVP consideration.**  **PG averaged 28ppg/4apg on 58% TS on the *6th seed* and got MVP consideration in 2019.**  Meanwhile, Lebron is not the MVP favorite.  It seems like this entire comment was pulled straight out of your ass. All of this data is publicly available and yet you still go with the narrative you prefer."
Not as good as LeBron James Harden would be
"I'll put it this way.     If Damian Lillard or James Harden was averaging 25ppg/8apg on 59% TS on the 3rd seed he would be getting 0 MVP consideration. If you said they should be MVP you'd get laughed at. But for Lebron, those same numbers will make him MVP favorite."
"Knicks somehow steal the East. Take the Lakers all the way before they hit massive foul trouble in game 7 of the finals. With seconds left Randle reverts to type and runs into a LeBron / AD double team. He somehow manages to kick it out, Elfrid Payton is open for the game winning 3. It's an air ball. In the soulsearching aftermath, James Dolan offers the entire team, every future draft pick and the Rangers for the wrong Antetokoumpo brother. Fin."
"If LeBron James wins 6 championships and has those numbers, the overwhelming majority will say undisputed GOAT. Theres nothing left to chase at that point.  There are still some that say Tom Brady isn't the GOAT.....does that mean he isn't? Of course not lolol, guy has 7 fucking rings he's without question the undisputed GOAT."
Is it wrong to say lebron james is still the best player in the world?
"Magic is better than Steph if you're relying on each of them to be your primary ball handler, bring the ball up, initiate the offense.  But with an all time team why would you use Magic to do that when you can use LeBron James instead? With this kind of talent, you're really looking at what value players can provide when they *don't* have the ball in their hands. And there are probably no two players who can do that more effectively than Steph running around off screens behind the arc or Shaq getting position in the low post to receive an entry pass"
"Slightly different interpretation, I don‚Äôt think anyone considers year 17 Lebron James a ‚Äútalent‚Äù, that‚Äôs usually a word for discussing promising young players with potential. Plus it‚Äôs been 2 years since they played together and it was a pretty forgettable season (results wise at least)."
"Bruh the Nets are in their own tier right now from everyone else come playoff time lol. Rn I‚Äôm questioning the Lakers‚Äô health, chemistry, and size even with LeBron there AD has been underperforming this year on top of all that, the Bucks and Sixers are routine frauds, I don‚Äôt trust PG to not become Pandemic P come playoff time. Utah right now is the closest thing to them because their shooting and star power (playoff Mitchell is a monster) but I just don‚Äôt see a team beating a trio of Kevin Durant-James Harden-Kyrie Irving in a 7 game series with their defense actually tightening up finally."
"Yeah, these people are actually INSANE if they think that LeBron James would be playing the same way if this was a playoff game. It could be Rudy Gobert, Dikembe Mutombo, Hakeem Olajuwon, you name it, LeBron would be driving and getting points if this was a playoff game.  Also Rudy is really good, might win DPOY this year again, but we've seen Anthony Davis absolutely ABUSE him on defense just this past year, so it's kinda weird to talk about how he should be DPOY after last night's game when he didn't even go against the guy that has routinely obliterated him everytime they face off.  The Jazz are cute, their fans will downvote me to oblivion, but we all know that their season ends in the 2nd round the same way it happened to the 2018 Raptors and the 2020 Bucks. The Jazz could win 60 of their 72 games and there are zero people outside of Utah that would pick them to beat the Clippers, Lakers and the Nets/Sixers in consecutive playoff series."
"They're a championship favorite because they have Lebron James. It's really that simple.  If these issues still happen late into the seas, then it'll be concerning. And then they'll still have Lebron James, so they still have a chance.   We do this every year."
"Lebron James himself said he‚Äôs never flopped, so it must be true!"
"No offense to lebron, but he‚Äôs better at most of those when it comes to size. If he was lebrons size and athleticism, just shut the league down. To be on another level passing and shooting than fckin lebron James is Insane, defense idk if we can predict so easily but CP3 is a monster on defense at 6 foot....who else in history is?"
"2018 Cavs  &gt; Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give LeBron James and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, ‚ÄúThere you go! There you go.‚Äù Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard J.R. Smith yelled out, ‚ÄúWe got an [expletive] squad now.‚Äù And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù  &gt; ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, I like being around guys that want to win and work hard,‚Äù James said. ‚ÄúI know I demand a lot of excellence in my teammates. I demand it out of myself, too. On the road, we are going to play as well as we can and put ourselves in contention to compete for another championship. And that‚Äôs my mindset.‚Äù  After making these 3 trades on Feb 8, 2018:  * Traded Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat for a 2024 2nd round draft pick. (Pick is heavily protected and not expected to convey.)  * Traded Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas and a 2018 1st round draft pick (Moritz Wagner was later selected) to the Los Angeles Lakers for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr..  * As part of a 3-team trade, the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Jae Crowder, Derrick Rose and a 2024 2nd round draft pick to the Utah Jazz; the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Dimitrios Agravanis, Iman Shumpert, $2.1M cash and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Sacramento Kings; the Sacramento Kings traded Art≈´ras Gudaitis and George Hill to the Cleveland Cavaliers; the Utah Jazz traded Rodney Hood to the Cleveland Cavaliers; and the Utah Jazz traded Joe Johnson and $1.1M cash to the Sacramento Kings. (UTA receives right to exchange 2024 second-round pick with CLE.) (SAC receives MIA 2020 second-round pick from CLE.)"
"Idk why this is a talking point bruh not only would none of these 4 reach this level of success sharing the same court, they would def not playing with an aging LeBron James wanting to contend"

"What about this one:  Who's going to win:  37-year-old Tim Duncan &amp; Tony Parker  Prime LeBron James &amp; Dwyane Wade  People need to realize that every player on a team matters, not just the superstars."
"They still remind me of the 2015 Hawks. Also, I wouldn't say the 2015 Hawks folded in the Playoffs. They did make it to the ECF only to lose to Lebron James. Everyone in the East lost to Lebron James for 8 years straight."

"Dude if models dated only LeBron james, it would be a very large line. And I dont think she cares about his money or his jumper."
"See that's also an oversimplification.   Yes, ideally Tatum needs to be more efficient. I'm not going to argue there.    However, the mistake you're making is assuming players should be compared to league averages and not team averages. I would love for Tatum to defer his shots to LeBron James more frequently, but unfortunately, we don't have LeBron James on the team.   Tatum often can't pass out of a bad shot because if he passes out we get an even worse shot. He can't defer to Jeff Teague, Semi Ojeleye and Grant Williams.   Kyrie on the other hand, had: Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Morris and Terry Rozier. There were guys he could have deferred to. Instead, he took shots away from them to focus on his own volume stats.  There is an argument to be said that Tatum could offload a couple of extra scoring attempts (and I've been wary of his low assist numbers and poor body language lately), but we really need him scoring ~20-25ppg at least, even at this efficiency because we can't get those points in a more efficient way.   &gt;Does that mean you'd rather have Deandre Jordan as a scorer than Tatum?  No.   Because as much as Tatum has struggled recently:  1. His efficiency isn't bad for a perimeter player (TS% is warped by highly efficient bigs on low volume) 2. His efficiency needs to be seen in the context of the team, not the league."
ESPN highlight reel: Here‚Äôs LeBron James. And here‚Äôs some more LeBron.
&gt;**Lebron James has a 38-35 record as a Laker in games Anthony Davis doesn't play**  So LeBron has a 52% win percentage without his #2.  Michael Jordan had a 193‚Äì187 record without Pippen. A 50.7% win percentage. What a hack.
"Without Anthony Davis, is LeBron James just an Akron Andrew Wiggins?"
"‚ÄúI see lebron James, Draymond green, Candace Parker, and other prominent figures about how book got snubbed.‚Äù  Yet I will continue on and say that terry rozier and Gordon Hayward are better than him.

"Star power, their two best players are not top 10 players like Anthony Davis and Lebron James."
I've been in a thai prison since 2003 and I guess this is that LeBron James kid that got drafted to the cavs? Looks like he didn't live up to the hype and became a journeyman it seems. Big shame.
All it took was Mormons and Minivans to defeat LeBron James.
The classic Lebron James System
Where is Lebron James?
Lebron james has more than proven his ability to turn it on when its go time
Avoiding LeBron James for as long as you can tends to be the best option in the playoffs.
He's going to fall of a cliff  LeBron James is just about done
AD causes LeBron to try on defense. AD will get in James' ear and no one else is doing shit cause they don't wanna get shipped. This is ADs team going forward at least in the regular season.
"LeBron James, Draymond Green, Chris Paul, CJ McCollum, Ricky Rubio, Jusuf Nurkic, Jared Dudley, DeMarre Carroll, Jamal Crawford, Reggie Miller and other NBA/former NBA players disagree with you"
"Didn't claim it was a hot take haha.  I just sent my Dad to this game tonight with the pitch ""LeBron James is in SLC!"" and it's not as close as I expected.  I have the Lakers to win it all man.  Much as I hate it."
"If the lifelong underdog LeBron James defeats the top dog Jazz team without Anthony Davis on the road, is he the GOAT?"
&gt;Those talking points included that Leonard would have a ‚Äú**great life as a Clipper**‚Äù and would be joining a Clippers roster with ‚Äú**a great deal of upside**‚Äù that would compete hard with LeBron James and the Lakers    If these were the only talking points that this guy could provide then Ballmer owes $2.5 million to half of this sub.
"Well if you're going by advanced stats, which the advocates against James' MVP campaign are, LeBron is killing it defensively and is on the #1 rated defense all while missing an apparent DPOY level player for large stretches."
"Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic own advanced metrics, but the ~~LeBron James~~ Media narrative is pushed down people's throats. FTFY"
Lebron James narrative has literally been more powerful than anything else in the MVP race
ah yes i forgot the nba was played on basketball-reference.com and my own eyes lied to me when i saw lebron james thoroughly outplay james harden on both sides of the court during last year's playoffs
"Skip has more ammo now when sees how high Mike is and LeBron cant be seen. Then when Shannon raises the points by 'James' last name, Skip wil reply LeBron got carried."
"Legacy wise, there's a case that Tony Parker is greater than James Harden. Which is why legacy is a pretty silly thing to look at. Aside from LeBron and Hakeem, there's probably nobody who's willed a team alone to the finals, and even those two had a very hefty amount of help."

Same thing with Minnesota who KAT is their best player, but Anthony Edwards has played more. Then you start having All Star nods becoming meaningless as guys like Herro would have All Star nods over James Harden."
&gt; You put lebron james on any team in the league preseason and they will be a top 3 seed. And that is why he is the best player in the league.  Oh like the 2018-2019 Lakers?
My logic doesnt make sense? But your bringing up a hypothetical scenario where lebron james gets traded mid season during a mvp campaign OK. You put lebron james on any team in the league preseason and they will be a top 3 seed. And that is why he is the best player in the league.

Can't tell you how frustrated I am about missing the twilight prime of Lebron James simply because it's inconvenient as all hell with league pass. I find other ways to view games but I miss a lot more than I'd like to. I'd also love to watch more Utah Jazz games.

this is because hes played the most games out of the high usage stars. James harden is leading the league in mins right now around 38. Lebron is tied with gordon hayward for 17th in mpg. Part of this is the lakers scheduling and a lot of guys have had covid etc. Hes still among the top but i dont think is quite as accurate description of how much hes played relative to the league. Other guys are also playing a bunch

"Well, no, I‚Äôm not. Those experiences I had are the most influential, but things like LeBron James bashing Morey over standing up for this suffering in Hong Kong, or Desean Jackson purposefully sharing Hitler quotes and getting defended, Malcolm Jenkins telling the media the Jews aren‚Äôt black people‚Äôs problems, random black people attacking random Asian people for no reason and very few people standing up for them, these events and more have also affected my opinion of BLM.   If BLM was a true equality movement like I initially thought it was, then BLM would have acted out against Desean Jackson instead of defending him, would openly ridicule Farrakhan for his evil views, would have spoken against LeBron for openly working against the freedoms of HKers, would have scolded Jenkins for telling people that Black people shouldn‚Äôt be distracted by the problems Jews face, and would be more critical of the fact that Asian people are innocent victims of random crimes.   But BLM is silent on this. BLM and it‚Äôs followers don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs not their problem, it‚Äôs a distraction to them."
"If he changed his name to lebron James, ESPN and NBA.com would hype him up"
"&gt; the championship season 10 years ago mostly due to Dirk  Yes, defending LeBron James was 100% Dirk's responsibility. Definitely. Makes complete sense."

"JJ Redick covered this in his most recent podcast with Kevin Love.  He said that the wine culture developed when the teams started staying the night in other cities after a game instead of immediately leaving right after the game. This led to the team‚Äôs having dinner and gave them a place to drink wine.  He said Popovich, Lebron James, and Jimmy Butler were the initial guys to really get into wine and start getting the rest of the league into it."
"Lmao no it wouldn‚Äôt be. Curry and KD were literally on the same level and nobody could determine who was actually the more valuable player. With LeBron and Wade, literally every single statistic and metric showed LeBron James was the superior player in that year. LBJ led the league in every single all-in-one advanced metric: PER, gamescore, bpm, VORP.   How the hell is that comparable to curry and KD? Hahahaha you‚Äôre delusional"
"No?  My issue is clearly against the hypocrisy of Mr Lebron Muhammad Ali James.  I have no issue with him, or anyone else fights against the injustice they received.    Lebron actually tried to get Morey fired.  Do you know how absurd it is?  Because it was clear that injustice was not more important than money.  Do you not understand how big of a difference it makes if he speaks up against China instead?  Fans of his will understand a whole lot more about the tragedy happening to the Urghurs and people in Hong Kong, and how China is the threat to humanity globally."

"Yeah he should try to take teams to the promised land in the NBA finals.  I know that the roster is not complete for a finals contending team, still need a solid rim protector, a bench unit, and a playmaker.  But even so, guys like Jason Kidd, and Lebron James or even Jimmy Butler has done more with much less or a bit less.     Not saying that Tatum is like those three, but sometimes the best way to bring players into the team is by elevating your game, that's why Brooklyn had attracted the attention of Kyrie, KD and Harden"

"This is gonna get long but the deal would have been perfect if Oladipo was playing like his pre-injury self.  But the problem is that he isn‚Äôt.  So the Simmons deal was higher floor/ lower ceiling, while the Brooklyn deal was higher ceiling/ lower floor.  There are a few ways (most of which involve the Nets becoming bad) that the Brooklyn deal pays off:  1. The Brooklyn Nets‚Äô big three breakup and join new teams which can happen at the end of next season.  2.  Harden, KD, and Kyrie age horribly and cap out the Nets down the road  3. Brooklyn‚Äôs roster bottoms out due to injury   4. Some combination of all the above  5.  Houston uses those picks in future trades for star level players.  If any of those things happen this trade is a success, and whether or not it‚Äôs better than Simmons boils down to how high or low you are on him and who they eventually get in return alternatively.  Now it‚Äôs hard to speculate on these things.  The prevailing attitude seems to be that Harden, KD, and Kyrie will all age like fine wine, get along well and retire together in Brooklyn leaving all those picks to be in the 20s.  However even successful super teams can be short lived, and injuries can tank even the best of franchises-case in point Miami Heat with LeBron and the KD era Warriors.    But even if they get along well and even retire together, they will get older in years 2026 and 2027, Kyrie will be 34-35, Harden will be 36-37, and KD will be 37-38.  It‚Äôs difficult to say how good these players will be at those ages.  Just for perspective Lebron James and Carmelo Anthony are both 36 years old right now, while Dwight Howard and CP3 are both 35 years old.  DWade also retired at age 37 not too long ago.  So it‚Äôs very possible that by then Kyrie and Harden could be both be on bloated contracts and KD could be retired and still have no depth making for a very decent chance at at least two lottery selections there, although it‚Äôs tough to say how much carrying those guys will be capable of at that age.  So the best realistic case scenario for Houston is probably a combination of #2 and #5 where they trade most of those picks (excluding years 2026-2027) for young star caliber players (ie MPJ and or John Collins) while hitting big on their own picks and while still having 2 very valuable lottery selections in years 2026-2027  TLDR: We don‚Äôt know yet, it really depends on what happens with those picks/what Houston does with them. So time will tell"

"Lakers should run it back!  - Schroeder, KCP, James, AD and Gasol is a juicy lineup, the problem is that they didn't play too much together. Lebron and AD were hurt most of the time and Gasol was send to the shadow realm when Drummond came. If this team had a healthy season the playoffs would be very different now.  - Also, not a lot of options to change the team, they can't sign FAs due to cap space. Maybe do some sign and trades.   On another note, I'm curious to see what the Wizards do to improve for next season, and who the Celtics will bring to be the PG."
"LeBron already plays point guard, why do people say shit like this  They need another ball handler, 37 year old Lebron James as your only reliable ball handler is not gonna cut it   They need Schroeder, he was good in the regular season"
"If you'd told me after the 2016 Finals that Klay Thompson would co-star in a Lebron James Space Jam, I wouldn't believe it."
LeBron James
"Jordan's scoring package is really almost unmatched by anyone in history, AND the rules + refs really favored him.   He had GOAT-level athleticism, and really great fundamentals. Early on, his explosive first step, great handles, and huge hands meant he could simply drive to the rim and finish above/around anyone better than literally everyone in NBA history except LeBron James; as he got older and relied more on his midrange his strength, fundamentals, and footwork allowed him to create a ton of separation to sink fadeaways from midrange (where his only peers are like, Dirk, KD, and Steph - other all-time level shooters), or get to the bucket with a bunch of up and unders.   The nephews here saying ""he'd get a boost from the spacing in today's league"" clearly didn't watch when the Bulls would just put 4 players on the other side of the court, let Jordan 1v1 and defenders wouldn't be able to do anything lest they be called for illegal defense. So while yes, he'd get a boost, he had something to that effect already helping him."
"Indeed and still there were more voters who thought James deserved it more than Curry. Stepth wasn't even outvoted by his teammate but by the loser too. Stepth simply wasn't the best in that series (LJ was) and Iggy slowed the best player of the other team, it's that simple. I don't know how one can argue that Stepth was robbed because he was the best player of his team but not the best player of the series. Both giving the award to the ""LeBron stopper"" and giving the award to the best player of the winning team and not the best player in the finals are two subjective opinions. So it's a fact that Curry was not the best player that series overall and that he didn't fit the narrative so... Not robbed.  No, I'm stating that without Iggy (and fatigue) the Warriors might have been surprised, that series should have never gone to six in the first place."
It's always interesting to see people lay out the reasons why Michael Jordan's level of competition was lower and reasons why he's not as complete of a player as Lebron James and then rather drawing the logical conclusion that Lebron is better than Jordan they say that if you assume Jordan is better than he actually was he becomes greater than Lebron.  The basic premise of your argument here is that if Jordan were better than Jordan he'd also be better than Lebron.
"Literally you‚Äôre delusional. You call randomly bringing up James Harden in a postgame interview to describe himself as not just a scorer ‚Äúadding humour‚Äù? That was clearly a salty/bitch move. If LeBron in a postgame loss randomly said I‚Äôm no KD, I‚Äôm not just a scorer, he would definitely get killed for that quote"
"Really not true.   It‚Äôs the same perception as calling players in bad teams ‚Äúgood stats bad team‚Äù. You think any coach can make an adjustment when he was the Hawks against a Lebron James, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love championship Cavs? How about the fact if they beat the Raptors in 2019 they likely beat the Warriors as well (assuming everything else is equal).   You can‚Äôt say ‚ÄúBud actively puts his team at a disadvantage‚Äù when he has consistently had his team completely but in to every role that they have been assigned, and they are favourited to win it all this year."
"LeBron James isn't even the 2nd greatest player of all time. His status is the product of years of media hype, calculated manipulation of his team situation (jumping to the best situation to win more than once), recency bias (i.e. people want to believe their generations players are best), and a purposeful league mandate to make offense easier.  He's still a great player but probably in the 10-20 range for me."
"I think what bothers me the most is that we don't need them. This probably applies to marketing at large but anything I want to hear from a player I could get directly from their mouth with their own social media. I imagine this is why a lot of players have started their own podcast/channels and don't particularly like reporters.  So the fact that nearly all their content is spent on regurgitating or flat out contradicting comments coming straight from the player irks me. And without fail every time a player decides he doesn't want to talk to the media they spend hours talking about how the players need the media. Fuck that. Especially when the topics are *always* a combination of Lebron, Brady, Rodgers, Cowboys.  **Every** ***single*** **employee at ESPN and FS1 needs to give Lebron James and Tom Brady half their paycheck. Period**"
"Stop. ""Reporters"" have literally made their career based on bashing LeBron for not beating far superior teams in the Finals. People were hating on KD this year for not carrying the Ghost of James Harden and...Joe Harris?...to the ECF and Finals. Giannis is a 2x MVP in his prime. Actually, he's so young still he may still be entering his prime. Yeah, at that point, nothing matters but postseason success. Nothing. Last postseason, his #1 seed team lost in five in the second round...and the only game they won was when he was out."
"That Kevin Durant joining the Warriors was anything like Lebron James joining the Heat.     KD had a once in a lifetime free agent opportunity where a star player could leave his team and go to a better team without leaving money on the table. Everyone on the team got paid and they didn't have to gut the roster to add him. No ones done it before because they didn't have the option.       Lebron, Wade, and Bosh took significant pay cuts to all play together. It literally was an unfair competitive advantage.  After getting 4 straight trips to the Finals  they put out that they weren't going to do that again because it set a bad precedent for the league. Basically, f\*\*\* you I got mine now we care about parity.     That being said, Lebron did back it up by continuing to go to the Finals after leaving the Heat and Durant is involved in the whole Harden forcing his was to the Net fiasco so... it all evens out."
"The Spurs didn‚Äôt tank for Tim Duncan. They lost one of the best players in NBA history to a season-ending injury, had a shitty year, and got lucky.   The Lakers signed Lebron James and Anthony Davis wanted to play with him. Neither of those teams were on the Sam Hinkie blueprint."
"It‚Äôs so frustrating! I‚Äôm a big baseball guy and I hate how they NEVER talk about baseball but regurgitate the exact same Aaron Rodgers, Lebron James, Tom Brady, Patrick Mahomes and  Dak Prescott/ Dallas Cowboys takes EVERY SINGLE DAY ON EVERY SINGLE SHOW! And what pisses me off even more is that when Max Kellerman and Stephen A talk about baseball, they actually know their shit and Max usually gets really excited."
How about being 6'4 with a wingspan longer than Lebron James which is over 7 ft.
"i really hope Masai trades for him.   but to your point, if a guy is 8-26 or 5-23 then Ben did his job.   If the eye test looks off it's maybe b/c you don't know what you are looking at.   Trae is a PnR savant.  nobody shuts it down.  But forcing him to do things he might not want to do like rushing floaters from his non preferred spots made it a hard time.     small guards are his weakest areas, b/c dude is 6-11.   but for the most part he hangs with them just fine and causes problems.   https://thesixersense.com/2021/03/01/philadelphia-76ers-ben-simmons-best-defensive-games/  &gt;Dec. 29, Sixers vs. Raptors ‚Äî Pascal Siakam Siakam Stats ‚Äì 7:02 mins | 7 pts |  3-11 FG |  0-0 FT | 0 ast | 1 TO  Simmons Stats ‚Äì 1 stl | 1 blk  Siakam had some success against other Sixers‚Äô defenders but couldn‚Äôt do much against Simmons. Six of Siakam‚Äôs field goal attempts against Simmons were 3s, most of which were Siakam settling instead of trying to attack the rim. Siakam had very little success the few times he tried to drive on Simmons as well. Ben is one of the few defenders in the NBA who has both the size and speed to cover Siakam, and it showed in this game.  maybe you prefer a homer article showing how much trouble he gives your squad's best player  https://www.raptorshq.com/2020/2/27/21155484/pascal-siakam-defense-stoppers-giannis-antetokounmpo-ben-simmons-bam-adebayo  or maybe you want to see more about him vs other star wings  https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/76ers/ben-simmons-nba-all-star-game-2020-analysis  &gt;While those numbers are all mighty impressive, the job he‚Äôs done just manning people up has been nothing short of stellar. When you look at the All-Star caliber players Simmons has defended this season, he‚Äôs kept them all in check. Jimmy Butler (3 of 12), Jayson Tatum (3 of 11), Pascal Siakam (5 of 19), Bradley Beal (6 of 14), LeBron James (2 of 9), Russell Westbrook (4 of 13) and James Harden (3 of 9) have shot a combined 26 of 87. That‚Äôs a combined field goal percentage of 29.8."
"I‚Äôll probably get downvoted to hell for this.  I think Lebron James only knows how to play in one style of offense: one that centers around him. If a player happens to be one that gets in the way of him playing his style, they‚Äôre cast out (as we‚Äôve seen time and time again). Last one: everyone says he makes the players around him ‚Äúbetter‚Äù but he doesn‚Äôt actually develop players to be better. He only makes players around him better by attracting more defenders.  He‚Äôs never taken a shitty team and groomed them into winners, the way we‚Äôve clearly seen Jordan do, and we‚Äôve clearly seen Kobe do."
"Not sure if this is unpopular or not yet, but imo LeBron James isn't close to Michael Jordan and never was, not because he isn't as good or better than everyone else, but because the difference between Jordan to the 2nd greatest player was bigger than the difference between No.2 and No.11  To me, LeBron is far greater than Kareem was, Kareem played in the weakest era in the history of the game and managed very little success, most of Kareem's lore comes from the most points scored, which was only possible due to his durability and him playing half of his career with the greatest point guard ever and the other half in a league with diluted talent."
Ah yes just easily acquire 4 league average shooters that aren‚Äôt complete liabilities on defense. Super easy to do.   It sounds like you‚Äôve confused Ben Simmons with LeBron James
Could the Portland Trail Blazers actually land LeBron James if he forced a trade?
"Tanking is not a way to winning any NBA titles, even if you draft well you then need to figure out how to trade and recruit other stars to the team.   This was a bizarre NBA season and we're never going to see one like this again. Injuries, going out with COVID, the favorites falling behind and losing, role players becoming heroes in lieu of stars going down. Enjoy this, one can not imagine how this current playoffs isn't a result of making players play so many games in such short time.   The window is closing on KD, Steph, Lebron, Paul George, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Damian Lillard. The rise of guys like Ayton, Embiid, Jokic, Young, Doncic, etc will eventually catch up.  Ben Simmons is a small ball 5.   Because Giannis can go to the basket consistently and make great plays in the paint which lead to scoring, He doesn't need a three pointer. Adding a consistent 3 pointer isn't gonna do as much as you hope it would because which guys actually going to respect it? the layup is still the most effective shot at the basket.  Giannis not being able to shoot free throws is an achilles heel, it's not only can he not shoot them but he even airballs them. Get that man shooting granny style, this is a bigger deal than not being able to shoot.  If Trae Young is indeed injured a bit at his ankle, the series is over. All that does is make it harder to go the basket and therefore easier for Jrue to guard you and score. That will be hard to overcome and I'm not sure it's possible."
"Literally nobody's floor is all star. Floor means the worst case scenario.  I'm excluding Oden here, because injuries are a different discussion entirely, but a guy like Wiggins is a perfect example.  Hell, even LeBron James wasn't an all-star year 1."
"The NBA should get rid of max contracts. Give teams X amount of money and pay players whatever you want. If you want to give LeBron James 95% of the cap, go for it. If you want to spread it around to a few lesser talented guys, do that. It would allow small market teams the ability to sign whatever free agent they wanted because they could just offer them a ton of money, rather than just offering the same Mac contract every other team can offer and would make team building a lot more interesting. You‚Äôd have well built teams and teams with one really big name rather than super teams. You‚Äôd have a lot more parity that way."
"Lebron James is the only player who has the benefit of the modern day stat lines yet is somehow evaluated as if he isn‚Äôt a modern day player.  Luka, Russ, etc do it and its ‚Äústat padding‚Äù."
"NBA players and coaches should shut up about social issues for the most part. With the exception of a few, the vast majority of them aren‚Äôt intelligent enough or informed enough to comment on social/political issues. Lebron James is nowhere near the erudition and wisdom of Kareem."
"Lebron James vs the pistons, game 5 of the 2007 ECF.  Warriors vs Cavs Christmas Day 2016. 2011 finals game 6. 2013 finals game 6.   These are some pretty good ones that come to mind. As u can tell I‚Äôm a huge Lebron fan lmao"
Yeah how dare they trade him to play with LeBron James on the team that was in the NBA finals 1 year earlier? If the Celtics gave him a max contract it would be the stupidest GM move in NBA history. This take sucks.
You're being downvoted but that is an absolute truth. James Harden and LeBron James are two all-time greats on the offensive end of the floor.
"Nah, it just doesn't fit the narrative that you're looking for. There is no denying that Kyrie was amazing in the series, but trying to paint it as some 2nd option with limited touches going off is not true. Kyrie was getting up 23 shots a game on 31% usage (LeBron 33.4%) against the Warriors. To put that in perspective he was shooting more per minute than James, had a higher usage rate &amp; 30 more shots in the series than Steph Curry, + more than Dwyane Wade ever had in a finals series during that Heat run."
James Gandolfini did a short video as Tony Soprano to try and get Lebron to come to the Knicks apparently.
"Joe Harris, Harden, Mike James, Tyler Johnson. All these guys can hit open 3‚Äôs.   And it would only be 2 minutes a half. KD had enough energy for 48 minutes. If they rested him 2 minutes a half he still would have something left in OT. With your reasoning Lebron would never come out of the game or Luka."
One of my greatest memories as a fan was the game where Josh Smith turned into LeBron James in the fourth quarter and the Rockets came back from like 20 down in a closeout game for the Clippers. The announcers were visibly upset the Clippers lost. They all sounded like they were covering a funeral. It was awesome.
"OK, sure. Then let's use their shooting splits against the Warriors since they had the same opponents and both series went 7. Similar sample size.   Cavaliers  |Player|FG%|3P%| |:-|:-|:-| |LeBron James|49.4|37.1| |Kyrie Irving|46.8|40.5| |J.R. Smith|40.0|35.6| |Tristan Thompson|63.6|0| |Richard Jefferson|51.6|16.7| |Kevin Love|30.4|26.7| |Iman Shumpert|26.3|16.7|  OKC  |Player||| |:-|:-|:-| |Kevin Durant|42.3|28.6| |Russell Westbrook|39.5|31.7| |Serge Ibaka|47.2|34.4| |Dion Waiters|35.8|31.8| |Andre Roberson|52.0|44.4| |Steven Adams|53.3|0| |Enes Kanter|48.6|0|"
Lebron James is the best player in the trade. Bradley Beal is the best piece. Beal has many many many more years to play compared to Lebron.
"I think the biggest thing holding Jimmer back was his own ego, dude thought he could walk into NBA teams and be the man like he was at BYU  Well that works... If you're say a LeBron James.... Doesn't work so well when one isn't though.  JJ Redick realized early on that maybe he wasn't gonna be a star like he was at Duke, and learned how to perfect his role as a flamethrowing 3pt threat."
Even as a Clips fan gotta put some respect on that 2011 Dirk run.  Portland -&gt; Kobe Championship Laker -&gt; Young Okc with 3 future MVP and to beat Lebron fucking James Heat in the finals.  Our playoff run may be spectacular but  no where close to the difficulty Dirk had to face.  Took us 7 games to beat Luka and 4 bricks. Down 0-2 to an overrated Jazz team. And now were going through another 7 game series against the Suns.   Compare to the legends Dirk had to face that year. Most impressive play off run still to date.
"I agree with you that the wizards aren‚Äôt doing this, but I think you must‚Äôve missed that LeBron James is in this trade."
"OKC as a team has horrible spacing. They were just not very well put together. They did do very well because of their two stars but ultimately wouldn't be enough.  Let's look at their rotation and shooting in the playoffs by order of minutes played.  |Player|FG%|3P%| |:-|:-|:-| |Kevin Durant|43.0|28.2| |Russell Westbrook|40.5|32.4| |Serge Ibaka|52.1|44.9| |Steven Adams|61.3|0| |Dion Waiters|41.7|37.5| |Andre Roberson|46.5|32.4| |Enes Kanter|55.1|14.3|  The only ones with respectable shooting was Ibaka and Waiters. You could argue that shooting wasn't as important then as it is now, sure. But compare it to the Cavs squad in the playoffs.   |Player|FG%|3P%| |:-|:-|:-| |LeBron James|52.5|34.0| |Kyrie Irving|47,5|44.0| |J.R. Smith|43.6|43.0| |Kevin Love|38.5|41.4| |Tristan Thompson|52.7|0| |Richard Jefferson|52.4|39.3| |Iman Shumpert|41.7|38.2| |Channing Frye|59.4|56.5|"
"Because Dirk's number 2 was Jason Terry. That's a huge drop off in talent, and yet he was able to sweep the defending champion Lakers (Kobe, Pau, Phil), almost sweep Russ, KD, and Harden, who would go on to go to the Finals the following year, and LeBron James, DWade, and CB4, who owned the NBA for the next couple of years. The level of talent they overcame is much more impressive than the teams the Clippers have beaten, injury or not. Dirk's run is the stuff of legends and this wouldn't reach that threshold."
"I'll start the list:  LeBron James, Shaquille O'Neal, and Kareem are all somewhere in the top 75 ahead of PG  Anyone else got contributions?"
"I‚Äôm a pretty big fan of the prestigious 800 game, 13.5 PPG, 5.9 RPG, 1.4 Steals, 49% fg, 30% 3pt club which includes the all time greats, Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Larry Bird, Thaddeus Young, and Magic Johnson"
Nobody is picked on more than LeBron James period
If you consider wise very high cieling then yes. I think a trade could be made with what warriors have to.offer.  It just pisses me off when fans ask for like next LeBron james lol. Happens to thunder fans too.
"So all it took was 3 words and an abbreviation for you to make yourself look foolish. ‚ÄúKawhi is a little overrated‚Äù followed by your reply being statistics are useless. LeBron James at the absolute peak in Miami watched Kawhi check into a game in the 4th quarter of the finals and said ‚Äúfuck‚Äù out loud while at the free throw line. But please tell us with all of your basketball knowledge how he‚Äôs overrated, beyond respected by Bron and he hadn‚Äôt even established himself as an offensive threat. That‚Äôs not stats either. What‚Äôs not a useless statistic is W and Ls and Kawhi directly helps his team get more Ws then Ls, and it‚Äôs been that way his career. Can his team survive without him for a brief period? Sure but so can any team in the NBA during a one game sample size that is the regular season."
"Chris Paul is also know as, lebron james.."
I mean LeBron James famously said 2 points is not 2 points so you tell me.
Two things the clippers don‚Äôt have: Hakeem Olajuwon or Lebron James
PG was battling against peak Lebron James and the Heatles
LeBron James flair  lol

I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a better player than he was in Indiana. Pacers Paul George was a worthy rival to Heat LeBron James for multiple years. His game is just different now.
"To everyone who says DeMar DeRozan isnt the greatest nba player of all time, he would have 3 rings if LeBron didnt exist. His last 3 playoff series L in Toronto was in the hands of LeBron James."
"Personally I like vorp when comparing the two.  Jordan leads in that regard.  When I say lead I mean their peak seasons. They played in different eras and are very different players.  So to me it's about how much better than the competition vs raw numbers.  LeBron James played much longer, so comparing career totals is fundamentally flawed.  So I go with advanced stats comparing peak to peak.  In my mind jordan comes ahead by a hair."
No it's Lebron James
I didn't know Paul Pierce changed his name to Lebron James
"Wow üò°üò°, why y'all always gotta compare üëë James to everyone else that's goddam disrespectful to LeBron given the numbe rkf trips he's made to the finals plus we gotta admit the playoffs kinda don't feel the same without LeBron facts"
"&gt;	When he was a better basketball player than LeBron James, which we've yet to see. Time's kinda running out.  For LeBron to be the goat, he has to beat the goat... LeBron James. Makes sense"
They had LeBron James
&gt; Always be wary of a guy with two first names.  wow fuck me! paul george and chris paul and lebron james and michael jordan and tim duncan damn theres a lot. n shit my dumbass cousin named his kid birdie a couple months ago so add larry in there
Space Purge with LeBron James
Is everyone excited to see LeBron James star in Space Jam this summer?
Paul George is LeBron James in these refs eyes
~~ben simmons~~ lebron james
Does anyone else find it weird Lebron James is not relevant this late in the season?
"The clips tanked to avoid the matchups we got and suddenly we have the easier path? 2 super teams, lebron James and mvp jokic?"
