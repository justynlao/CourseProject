Is Chuma Okeke this bad? He was supposed to be a great modern stretch four coming out of Auburn
But more importantly Chuma Okeke career high 10 points in a half
"Fultz out for the year, Fourier just came back after missing weeks,MCW has been out for weeks, Chuma Okeke has been out for weeks..."
"Yeah.  Fultz (From DC and under contract he's injured so he helps the tank) Fournier (starting 2 guard and expiring)  Mo Bamba, Chuma Okeke and 3 first round picks/swap (Even with Beal we may still be bad if Vuc drops off.)  Wouldn't trade Gordon or Isaac because we need then to have a good defense."
chuma okeke
"Team: Magic  Rookies: Cole Anthony, Chuma Okeke  Cole Anthony has been looking rough. He‚Äôs not very efficient and isn‚Äôt a great defender  As for Chuma Okeke, I haven‚Äôt really seen him play that much so idk"
Your kinda like presti just that presti drafts all these athletic wings with no jumper and you pick them up from everywhere and at all positions.  But tbf you are missing my favourite College player from the 2018/19 college year in chuma okeke. If he finally stays healthy he will definetly help with your offense.  If i were you tho i'd look into trading Gordon for a smaller more 3 and D aligned Wing. His most valuable assett besides defense is his ball handling for you but that can and should be picked up by other guys aswell.
"nah, they need to continue building their future, not around vuc lol. build around markelle/isaac/cole anthony/chuma okeke, hope you hit the developmental lottery."
Chuma Okeke
Chuma Okeke aggravated his knee as well. Magic can't catch a break
"Protected: Nikola Vucevic, Markelle Fultz, Terrence Ross, Aaron Gordon, Chuma Okeke, Cole Anthony, Jonathan Isaac  Best Available: Evan Fournier, Khem Birch, Michael Carter Williams"
1. Voooooch  2. Jonathan issac   3. Markelle fultz   4. Coke Anthony   5. Chuma okeke   6. Aaron Gordon   7. Terrance Ross

"Surely it's tempting to hope you stay in the lottery to somehow pick up Jalen Green?      **Starters:** Markelle Fultz, Jalen Green, Jonathan Isaac, Aaron Gordon, Nikola Vucevic.    **Bench:** Cole Anthony, Dwayne Bacon, Terrence Ross, Chuma Okeke, Mo Bamba."
I think Chuma Okeke
"Chuma Okeke, 16th pick in the draft, drafted because of his very high 3 and D potential"

I swear I see a random Chuma Okeke highlight video posted in every basketball on reddit at least twice a week.
"It's complicated because to be honest, we're not a bad team on paper when healthy. The reason we always seem to get off to a hot start and then suddenly cool off is because all of a sudden our rotation gets decimated. We've just had shit luck in regards to freak injuries for like 4 years now, but I genuinely believe that we're one elite scorer from being a team that could make a lot of noise in the playoffs when healthy sort of like the Bubble Heat. Assuming Fournier leaves this year via trade or free agency, a healthy Magic team has (guaranteed) Fultz, Isaac, Gordon, and Vucevic as starters, with Cole Anthony, Terrance Ross, Chuma Okeke, and Al-Farouq Aminu off the bench. That's a pretty good core, but obviously right now we're running MCW, Gary Clark, Dwayne Bacon and James Ennis. If we could get that elite scorer, we would be idiots to trade players like Vucevic and Gordon to tank.  You also have to remember that Orlando isn't gonna pull many big names through trades or free agency any time soon, as we haven't had any real success in a decade. Pretty much any offer we get for Vucevic would be a bad trade on our part for us. Unfortunately for Celtics fans, we're not trading Vuc for Romeo Langford, Payton Pritchard and a couple seconds.  Finally, right now the East is too wide open to tank. While Fultz and Isaac are gone, Gordon and Anthony should return, and Steve Clifford and our FO wouldn't commit to tanking unless we had no shot at the playoffs, and we're only a couple games out."
I‚Äôm just here for Chuma Okeke
"Anyone catch the postgame interview? ü§£  Vucevic on Chuma Okeke: ‚ÄúWell, he had huge Bs. Oh. I can say balls. He had huge balls‚Äù  Vuc also forgot who the Magic played two day ago. Epic interview, epic performance from player and team. Vucevic is an Allstar"
Vucevic is an all star. Also chuma okeke is a stud.
chuma OKEKE!!!!
Name of the day: Chuma Okeke!
i love chuma okeke
"Orlando running an 8 man rotation of Vucevic, Terrence Ross, Michael Carter-Williams, Mo Bamba, Dwayne Bacon, Gary Clark, Chuma Okeke, and Khem Birch..."
I mean he‚Äôs hurt right now but Bamba doesn‚Äôt deserve minutes over Aaron Gordon and won‚Äôt deserve minutes over Isaac when he‚Äôs back next year. And then they‚Äôre playing guys like Chuma Okeke and Khem Burch over him. You have to think they‚Äôre seeing something in practice we‚Äôre not. There‚Äôs most likely a reason he isn‚Äôt getting minutes.
Chuma Okeke!!!

"Chuma Okeke 21-22 MIP, Book it!"
"Since the Magic gutted their roster and gave him the opportunity, Chuma Okeke is averaging 16.3/5.9/3.0 with 1.3 steals 0.7 blocks and only 1.3 TOV on .524/.467/.923 shooting splits.   Should be an absolutely perfect fit with Isaac going forward as well."
Chuma okeke
Markelle Fultz / Cole Anthony   Jalen Green / RJ Hampton  Jonathan Isaac / Terrence Ross or Gary Harris (trade one?)  Chuma Okeke / maybe bring back Ennis?  Wendell Carter Jr / Mo Bamba
Chuma Okeke has a chance if he keeps up his play for the rest of the year (can't see why he wouldn't on this tanking team)

I like Chuma Okeke. The roster construction on Orlando doesn't look pretty.
"Especially when you consider that he had arguably the best game of his rookie season literally this past Monday lol. Like it's perfectly fine to talk about legitimate criticisms, but people are way too trigger happy with labeling 19-year old rookies as busts. Some rookies, like Jaden McDaniels and Chuma Okeke, have started showing promise out of nowhere within the past week itself despite being completely unknown to 99% of this sub until now."
chuma okeke goodness gracious
"Drafted because of length? That's called drafting for potential and intangibles. That was a good pick. Chuma was picked because of his advanced stats by the AI we are using not because hes ""cheap"". By sitting out a year he actually gets paid more. That was the whole reason he agreed to it. Anthony is also doing fine just got injured. And it's easy to say Bamba is a fireable offense in hindsight but after trae and Luka were picked he was consensus best prospect available at the time. Many others would have done the same.  All in all it's too early to say any of these picks have been bad except maybe Bamba, and frankly most of these look pretty damn good. Okeke averaging 18 since you posted this"

chuma okeke but tross isn‚Äôt even playing
Chuma Okeke breakout game.
Chuma Okeke
"Almost all their decent young players are out with injury.   They won't be ""meh"" next year when they use those draft picks and Isaac, Fultz and Anthony are all back.  However, as currently situated, they are ""meh"" unless you consider Chuma Okeke, Wendell Carter Jr. and Mo Bamba to be exciting. Maybe Chuma is but Wendell and Bamba have largely done nothing in the NBA."
Chuma Okeke
"what keeps me hopeful for the future:  * hoping the DeVos family sells the team  * understanding we made the playoffs last two years with healthier squads  * adding a potential top 5 pick in the draft and getting JI and Fultz back next season  * Vucevic continuing to improve his game  * Chuma Okeke and Cole Anthony  it ain't much, but that's what we've got to work with. we need to continue our pattern of lucking into a generational talent in the draft and then failing to build a good team around them, so hopefully we can get our guy this year."
"&gt; is it worth it to run it back with this same team and essentially top out as like a 5-6 seed   No reason that 5-6 is our ceiling to be honest. We have 4 real vets on our roster. Vuc, Fournier, Ross, Gordon. One of gordon and Fournier will be moved for luxury tax reasons. That means next year our 9 man rotation will have 6 players 24 and under.  Fultz, Cole Anthony, chuma okeke, Jonathan Isaac, mo Bamba, and our pick this season. We will likely get another young player in a trade involving gordon or Fournier.   The reason to sell vucevic for picks and young players would be is if we were in need of those things, and we aren‚Äôt. If we trade vucevic essentially our entire team will be young players and we resign ourselves to multiple years of being terrible. Magic fans and ownership would much rather we be competitive with room for growth than engaging another hard reset. The minute we trade Vuc we will go looking for a stretch 5 to open the lane for our young guys because Bamba isn‚Äôt ready to start. Seems kind of ridiculous to do so when we have an elite on already on the roster.  &gt; Vuc when is value is sky high and getting back potentially some nice draft picks and young talent.  The other part is that his value isn‚Äôt going to radically change in the next year. If we‚Äôre underperforming next season we can move him at the deadline, he will still have 1.5 years left on his deal at that point."
Chuma okeke is the guy you're looking for
 Chuma Okeke
Chuma Okeke fit the bill for Orlando
"My only deal is I‚Äôd be adding him to a team that already has Anthony Edwards, Caris LeVert, Andrew Wiggins, Chuma Okeke and Devin Vassell at wing üòÖ"
chuma okeke
"i could barely watch when mcw was starting for us lol he made me so angry cause he was just so awful, chuma okeke is the only reason i watch now lol. it sucks cause it would be way more fun to watch if isaac and markelle were leading the team but they both are out for the season so it‚Äôs eh"
Future MVP Chuma Okeke gives me hope

"@joshuabrobbins: The Magic will start Cole Anthony, Gary Harris, Dwayne Bacon, Chuma Okeke and Mo Bamba tonight against the Pelicans in Orlando. Wendell Carter Jr., Michael Carter-Williams, James Ennis, Otto Porter Jr. and Terrence Ross will not play."
"I think he has; how many guys taken after Garland would you take over him? The only ones with a case are Coby White, Rui Hachimura, Cam Johnson, PJ Washington, Tyler Herro, Chuma Okeke, Nickeil Alexander Walker, Matisse Thybulle, Brandon Clarke, and Lu Dort. I'd personally take Garland over all those guys except maybe Dort."
"Why is Chuma Okeke not getting any love? Even though he was drafted in 2019, he's still a rookie because he didn't play last year. He's impressed me a lot this year."
They really forgot about chuma okeke
Gary Harris and Chuma Okeke for co-dpoy‚Äôs
Chuma Okeke
Maybe chuma okeke for the Magic. Also Wendall Carter JR has shown some promise since coming across
Chuma okeke
Chuma Okeke
Chuma Okeke.
the disrespect to jonathan isaac and chuma okeke
we've got jared  chuma okeke  and that guy bryce brooooooooooooown  shootin' that thing from way downtooooooooown
"Yeah, we did that this year. We likely have 2 top 10 picks. I am not sure if we will tank hard again next year or not, I have to see what the FO does this summer and of course how we compete the first half of the season.  In terms of young gems we just got RJ hampton who won rookie of the month, we have Fultz, JI, Wendell Carter, Cole Anthony, Chuma Okeke and Bamba.   So you add those picks to that mix and its a super young team. So I think full rebuild is already in effect. Plus we can sign 2 max players in 2022 if we want, so there is a lot of flexibility to get things moving in a couple of years."
My body is ready for Chuma Okeke.
Chuma Okeke era is amongst us üòà

"The crazy thing is, chuma okeke would be a great fit with Lebron.  Long 3 and d guy.  Robert horray type"
I think Chuma Okeke is going to make a big leap next year if he can stay healthy.
Idk if I‚Äôd pick anyone of those guys before Chuma Okeke but hey
Chuma Okeke? Where is he? I think he would go 4-6th
"You can say this about literally every player  Maybe Wiseman turns it around, he's young and has potential. But if you're considering Dwight Howard as a realistic possibility for him then I'm gonna say Chuma Okeke could be Carmelo Anthony"
Show Chuma some respect! Okeke might end up being the best or at least more well rounded out of all those guys.
markelle fultz  cole anthony  rj hampton  chuma okeke  jonathan isaac  mo bamba  wendell carter jr  top picks coming  very exciting to me
I don‚Äôt see Chuma Okeke so it‚Äôs a no from me
Chuma Okeke
Chuma Okeke.
"a pretty big selection of young guys to develop and try building around, on top of 2 top 10 picks this year along with all their picks + the bulls pick coming up  young players with potential: markelle fultz, jonathan isaac, cole anthony, chuma okeke, rj hampton, wendell carter jr, mo bamba. not a bad start"
Chuma okeke missed like 6 weeks with a bone bruise in his knee this year
"Chuma Okeke has looked great for us in Orlando, both his parents are Nigerian."
Everyone is sleeping on Chuma Okeke
Here's something that may make you feel better: CHUMA OKEKE
"Good shout on the Magic.   Cade Cunningham, Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Jonathan Isaac, Wendell Carter Jr.   Markelle Fultz, RJ Hampton, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke and Mo Bamba.   That's a really promising team, and I do wonder if they then see what they can get for the likes of Ross and Harris."
"I like the Dwight finals team. Vucevic is nice for us.   I've always supported Wendell and hope he's good for them.   Shaq and Penny was cool.   Everything else is whatever.  Also I knew Chuma Okeke would be good. Don't care for Cole Anthony. Terrance Ross would be more interesting on another team, kinda like Khem Birch."
Chuma Okeke has a great name
"No, Chuma Okeke is Big Chungus"
Not sure the guy we just drafted at 5th overall is underrated.   I personally would‚Äôve put Chuma Okeke. He‚Äôs going to be a really solid player for a long time in the league and not many know about him.
Probably Chuma Okeke
"I believe the Magic used proprietary AI to decide who to pick in the 2019 and 2020 draft which landed us with Cole Anthony, who I think will be a stud sooner rather than later, and Chuma Okeke."
"Lauri Markkanen, Aaron Nesmith, Aleksej Pokusevski, Jordan Poole, Chuma Okeke, Robert Williams, Tyrese Maxey."
"Chuma Okeke can score at every level, great defense, top tier BBIQ, Good passing. Just needs to develop his handle a little bit to become a better shot creator. BIASED AF as a Auburn/Magic fan but I see no faults in the kids game."
Derrick White and Chuma Okeke
Chuma Okeke
Chuma Okeke
Chuma Okeke
Chuma Okeke. Want to say Jonathan Isaac too but that is more main stream with people talking about his dpoty potential when healthy.   Why are people saying Ben Simmons? Is he not already an all star and all defensive talent? Lmao
May not be the most underrated but most people don‚Äôt really know who Chuma Okeke is and I really think he‚Äôll be the next prototypical 3 &amp; D like Crowder
That‚Äôs Chuma Okeke
"It's so true, a young player like Chuma Okeke gets talked about way more than a young player like THT."
"Hey we already have Chuma ""chumbucket"" Okeke"
I guess he can back up Chuma Okeke
Chuma okeke
"Orlando Magic another big winner so far with their young rotation:  **PG:** Jalen Suggs, Markelle Fultz, Cole Anthony.   **SG:** RJ Hampton.  **SF:** Franz Wagner.  **PF:** Chuma Okeke.   **C:** Wendell Carter Jr, Mo Bamba.   Got some fairly moveable guys too with Harris and Ross."
CHUMA OKEKE
"Their last drafts have been fine.   Cole Anthony, Chuma Okeke, Jonathan Isaac were all good picks. Bamba, maybe not."
"Our fanbase thinks jon isaac, chuma okeke, and markelle fultz are all untouchable. We have 0 untouchable players."
"PG: Curry SG: SGA SF: Kyle Anderson PF: Giannis C: Boucher  Bench: Haliburton, TJ McConnell, PJ Tucker, Aron Baynes, Trevor Ariza, Reggie Jackson, Jordan Poole, Maurice Harkless, Chuma Okeke, Willy Hernangomez"
"Just to add:  Isaac Okoro - Cavs,  Chinezie Metu- Sac,  Chuma Okeke - Orl,  Onyeka Okongwu - Atl,  Zeke Nnaji - Denver,  Udoka Azubuike - Jazz,  Desmond Bane - Mem,  Jordan Nwora - Bucks,  Daniel Oturu - Clips  Monte Morris - Den"
"Since they‚Äôve had access to this they‚Äôve drafted Chuma Okeke, Cole Anthony, and basically rj hampton (organization wanted him, ended up trading for him). All good picks, all probably outperformed their draft position. Early to tell for sure but I‚Äôm pretty happy as a fan"
"Hey! It was Sabonis and Oladipo for Ibaka! Also that was 100% the last GM. These guys have been using this system, pretty sure it was how they drafted Chuma Okeke"
Chuma Okeke to average 42 ppg this season.   Bamba averaging over 2 blocks per game with WCJ averaging a double/double.  So many options.
"In the full article they have him at 24, behind Terence Davis, Naz Reid, and Chuma Okeke"
"For the Magic, it's Chuma Okeke. I don't think he's going to make an all-star leap or anything, but he has a very well rounded game, pretty decent shooting, and he put together some really fantastic games last year.  He might not start, so I don't know if he qualifies, but he's good enough that I think nba fans should watch him. Dude is an absolute blast to root for."
Chuma Okeke
Chuma Okeke
what about 2020 Chuma Okeke???
"If it were up to me‚Ä¶  PG-Jalen Suggs/SG-RJ Hampton/SF-Chuma Okeke/PF-Jonathan Isaac/C-Wendell Carter, Jr.  With Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Franz Wagner and Mo Bamba off the bench. I really don‚Äôt know where Gary Harris fits in, he‚Äôs a good veteran leader for the young guys and I don‚Äôt want to take any long term salary by trading him but I also don‚Äôt want him playing over any young guards. I think he likely gets bought out later on.   When Fultz is healthy then things get interesting."
"I like Suggs. Issac was always a favorite, we‚Äôll see how he‚Äôs recovered. RJ Hampton, Chuma Okeke, and Cole Anthony could be solid. NBA people love Wagner. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
It's early but I think Chuma Okeke could have a breakout season next year.
"Nope. Next you gonna ask me if I know a Chuma Okeke too, right"
Ya I‚Äôm excited. Other notable one is Chuma Okeke but I didn‚Äôt mention him in that comment cause he‚Äôs gonna be a really good shooter.  First time in a while I‚Äôve been optimistic about our future. This will be a fun year of development and the 22 draft is absolutely stacked.
Jonathan Isaac  Mo Bamba Wendell Carter Jr Markelle Fultz  Cole Anthony  RJ Hampton  Jalen Suggs  Franz Wagner  Chuma Okeke
Chuma Okeke
Chuma Okeke is definitely gonna be atleast an all-star in 5 years. MARK MY WORDS DOWN
what about chuma okeke
Chuma Okeke. I think he has the potential to be a great two way player.
Did Chuma Okeke die or something?
Chuma Okeke should be back soon and than JI should be back by Dec.  I would have signed Nate Hinton or Tyler Bey but I guess he is a 27 who can fill in if needed.
"The only healthy wing defenders we have right now are Gary Harris and Franz Wagner. This was Gary Harris' first game of the season because he's been injured so I think we didn't wanna ride him too hard, and Franz was coming off playing nearly 40 minutes in the first half of the B2B so same deal.  Ideally Chuma Okeke or Jonathan Isaac would be on Jimmy but both are out atm."
"Yep.. Isaac and Fultz are obvious, Gary Harris was supposed to start the season as our starting 2, and Chuma Okeke would probably be starting over Franz"
Fultz and Chuma (Chum Bucket) Okeke
Add Chuma Okeke and Franz Wagner to the mix
"Mo Bamba might lead the league in blocks this yr, Jonathan Isaac is a DPOY player when healthy, WCJ is a really good defender, Franz Wagner at 6'10 and Chuma Okeke at 6'8 are long and tall wing defenders. Jalen Suggs is also a really good defender Magic have all the makings of being an elite defensive team."

"You‚Äôve posted on Suggs, Fultz, Bomba and Okeke.  You are with the Magic.  Love Suggs and hope Fultz can reach his potential.  Chuma has upside.  Truth is - 11 of the Magic‚Äôs 15 players are 24 or younger which is not how you win in the NBA.  Vegas has your wins total at 22.5."
"WCJ has shown he is a starting level center and is still only 22 with expanding range, Chuma Okeke averaged 8 ppg 4 rpg 2.2 apg 1.1 spg 0.5 bpg and shot 35% from three in his rookie season last yr and Franz Wagner will be a really good glue guy. Cole Anthony is a 6th man type of player and RJ Hampton has all the physical tools to be a really good player. JI has shown when healthy he is a top 5 defender in the NBA and is still only 24.   I agree we don't have that true superstar yet but we have really good depth and if we get a top 5 pick like Banchero, Chet, Adrian Griffin JR or Hardy that is a really good core. We can even trade some of these young guys and package them with the 1st rd picks and 2nd rd picks we have gotten from the Vuc and AG trades for a superstar or star down the line."
Chuma Okeke?  GTFO with that bullshit.
"i mean i guess thats interesting but theres just more interesting ""will they develop"" guys than.. fuckin chuma okeke and OG Anunoby. and I know THT was just thrown in there cuz of lakers but like jesus man."
"The Chuma Okeke agenda begins, lfg baby"
Chuma Okeke is the greatest basketball player to ever grace a court.
Chuma Okeke over Jordan Poole??
if chuma okeke had 10 rings we would be talking about him as the goat
Everyone who isn't a Magic fan is sleeping on Chuma Okeke.

"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
