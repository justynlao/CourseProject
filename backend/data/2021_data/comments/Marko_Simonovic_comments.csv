This thread will be hilarious to look back on after Marko Simonovic wins his 15th consecutive MVP
"Ayo and Marko Simonovic (21 y o Euro pro we drafted in the second round in 2020) were already known to have signed with the Bulls, but we could only sign 1 of the 2 for more than 2 guaranteed years, via the remainder of the MLE after Caruso.   So, Ayo got 2 years at the minimum through the minimum salary exception, and Simonovic almost certainly get 3-4 years guaranteed, with the first year at $1.861m (0 experience min salary plus our remaining $936k of MLE money), and we'll have full bird rights over Simonovic and early bird rights for Ayo in 2 years."
"....Vooch?  Heck, he'll likely be their best overall player  Not just their ""Big 4"" either.  Pat Williams's growth is going to be exciting, and they have Caruso &amp; Coby coming off the bench, which projects to be pure fireworks  They've also got Troy Brown Jr, Tony Bradley, Jevonte Green, Dosunmu, possibly Markkenen, and this new Montenegren kid that Karnisovas took with last year's 2nd rounder Marko Simonovic, who is very tall &amp; very talented  Heck of a turnout job by Karnisovas &amp; Eversley, mopping up Paxson's disgusting mess of a roster/organization.  In less than 2 yrs, nearly everyone from the old Uncle Jerry/Paxson guard are goners"
There's a guy in the Bulls subreddit who made a thread saying Marko Simonovic already looks better than Lauri ever did because he put up 13 points yesterday
&gt; Marko Simonovic  Ding ding!  I think we have a winner--thank you!
Marko Simonovic  He's a draft and stash 2nd round pick from last year's draft.
"1)  Gafford sucks.  You could put a broomstick in there with Westbrook, and if it can catch lobs at a respectable clip, Russ will make said broomstick look like Moses Malone.  Chicago moved him for Troy Brown Jr, who has considerably higher upside &amp; is a much more adequate fit for the contemporary NBA, on both sides of the ball  2) Chicago's defense will be fine.  It wasn't that bad last yr, and they shored up their perimeter D big time over the off-season.  Their overall D won't be stellar or anything, but it won't be terrible either.   Maybe actually go look up the stats/evidence before commenting?  The Bulls biggest weaknesses last season by far were ball distribution, turnovers, &amp; free throw attempts.  Both issues have been addressed &amp; subsequently remedied  They've also acquired Tony Bradley, who is a young, serviceable big body down low, and have a 21 yr old 7-footer from Montenegro, Marko Simonovic, that they've recently brought on board, who was their second rd draft pick last yr &amp; is already at the advocate centre practicing with Billy D &amp; their 2nd rd pick from this yr, Ayo Dosunmu, who also looks to be a solid NBA perimeter defender"
"Our current depth chart:   PG: Lonzo Ball / Alex Caruso / Ayo Dosunmu   SG: Zach Lavine / Coby White / Javonte Green(?)  SF: DeMar DeRozan / Troy Brown Jr.   PF: Patrick Williams / Lauri Markannen(?)   C: Nikola Vucevic / Tony Bradley / Marko Simonovic   I doubt Lauri is on the team, hopefully he’s traded for some defensive bigs because we’re in a bad position if we don’t get any rim protection. Javonte Green is a nice bench piece and should be coming back on the QO."
The league ain't ready. The Bulls are about to make noise as a dangerous playoff team this year:  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * DeMar DeRozan * Lonzo Ball * Coby White * Patrick Williams * Alex Caruso * Troy Brown * Marko Simonovic * Ayo Dosunmu
yeah we really could use a defensive big. If Vooch gets injured then we are absolutely fucked right now. All we have is a european rookie who is not a defender in Marko Simonovic.
Marko Simonovic
"you only get hardcapped when you do 3 things:  1) use a bi-annual exception (impossible for lakers because they didn't have 1 this year)  2) use more than the taxpayer midlevel exception amount of your non-taxpayer midlevel exception (impossible for lakers because they, being taxpayers, did not have a non-taxpayer midlevel exception; bulls are hardcapped for using as much of their MLE as they did on caruso+marko simonovic)  3) receive a Free Agent via sign-and-trade trade (heat are hardcapped for getting lowry, bulls are also hardcapped for getting lonzo)  they just did a normal trade for russ because he was a pre-existing contract and not a free agent."
