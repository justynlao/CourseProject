"&gt;2 Remaining Spots between Trae Young, Tobias Harris, Malcolm Brogden, Gordon Hayward, Jrue Holliday, Kyrie Irving, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Zach LaVine &amp; Collin Sexton.  Brutal how do you even pick?"
That's just straight up not true.      I made a comment about Tobias Harris' competition but Ben Simmons is also no chance. There are 8 guards in the East (only a maximum of 6 can make the team) that are having a better season than Simmons.      |Player|Pos|Conf|Tm|G|PTS▼|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|3P|FG%|3P%|FT%| :--|:--|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Jaylen Brown|G|E|BOS|18|27.1|5.4|3.5|1.4|0.6|2.6|0.531|0.443|0.756| |James Harden|G|E|BRK|16|24.5|6.4|11.1|1.0|0.7|3.1|0.463|0.371|0.880| |Trae Young|G|E|ATL|19|26.9|4.2|9.0|0.7|0.2|2.3|0.422|0.364|0.887| |Kyrie Irving|G|E|BRK|14|27.6|4.8|6.0|1.0|0.7|2.9|0.525|0.421|0.945| |Zach LaVine|G|E|CHI|19|26.6|5.3|5.1|1.3|0.6|3.5|0.510|0.419|0.881| |Bradley Beal|G|E|WAS|15|34.9|5.1|4.7|1.3|0.6|2.4|0.479|0.340|0.891| |Collin Sexton|G|E|CLE|16|24.1|2.6|4.1|1.0|0.2|1.7|0.498|0.435|0.824| |Malcolm Brogdon|G|E|IND|20|22.9|4.3|7.0|1.4|0.3|3.0|0.457|0.404|0.896|.
He’s balling out.   Kyrie or Zach Lavine have the most aesthetically pleasing game in the league right now. Smooth and looks like they’re not exerting much effort

Man my half awake ass read Zach Lowe as Zach Lavine and was surprised for a second.
It's crazy how similar our two games were (minus the very end). Both had huge comebacks capped off with a Zach Lavine dagger from the top of the key. Difference of course is that Lillard went god mode
"Look at the thread you're responding in then look at the comment chain  &gt;Zach Lavine was once referred to as a negative player on here and empty stats guy  I read what you said and I'm sticking to the topic. Which is high volume scorers like Lavine always getting called empty stats guys because they are on bad teams. This isn't just about low efficiency scorers. Those guys just aren't good, it's not 'empty' stats, we see the stats and they poor.   You mentioned basic stats   &gt;The base counting stats are empty in that they are a byproduct of purely taking lots of shots rather than actually playing efficient winning basketball. You don't need to use VORP or BPM to tell you these things.  You don't see ts% when you open up a box score. You can clearly see fg%, 3pt%, and ft% in the basic stats for the box score so I don't see the point you were trying to make that the 'base counting stats are empty'."
"Bradley Beal is literally not better at any facet of the game than Kyrie. Not one. How tf is he ahead of him and what has he done in his career to be considered a better player than Kyrie? Kyrie has accomplished way more than him and deserves some damn respect.  Trae young last year was insane scorer in a bad situation. Zach Lavine is an insane scorer in a bad situation. There are plenty of great scorers in bad situations, I understand they’re not averaging 34 PPG but weight does that hold when the Wizards are the worst team in the league? You think Beal would average that if he was on a contending team with another superstar?"
LaVine is averaging 0.3 less points on almost 10% better efficiency. I think Zach was 50/40/90 for the entirety of last month.  Trae is dishing out dimes with the best of them though can't argue that.
"Jaylen Brown definitely got some new tricks. Jerami Grant ring a bell for you? Wiggins got a huge boost in consistency. Zach Lavine seems levelled up. there's tons of guys that are bringing new or drastically improved skills, in spite of the lack of any off-season to speak of"
"For real. Like I was watching the Bulls/Knicks game tonight and two players *clearly* were fighting for possession of the ball. A jump ball would be the obvious and correct call that anyone with a passing knowledge of basketball could make. They called a **foul** on the Bulls instead. There was literary no contact. Just two guys with their hands on the ball trying to yank it from each other.  Keep in mind the refs called an obvious intentional foul on Zach Lavine a jump ball the other night. That jump ball led to a Damian Lillard game winner. How the fuck do you fail to blow the whistle are two, **TWO** players internationally fouling another player?  Like, this shit is impossible to excuse. I can’t believe they are actually this bad at their jobs, so I tend to think they’re corrupt, malicious, or both."
"WOOOO! Fire up the Taltz, Skyrizi, and Cosentyx cause my man Zach Lavine has Scoreiasis! WOOOOO!!!"
Zach Lavine.
Did someone say Skyrizi!? WOOOOO!!!! Load it up for Zach Lavine! He's got Scoreiasis!!!
"""WOOOO! Load up the Taltz for my man Zach Lavine! He's got Scoreiasis!"""
"&gt; Zach is scoring and defending significantly better than Trae.  There's no doubt about that.  But (and I say this as a Bulls fan who believes LaVine deserves to get that last all-star spot) the difference in playmaking between the two of them is *huge*. Zach is getting incrementally better every year, but Trae is a premier playmaker. 8.6 ast with just 4.1 TO vs 5.2 ast with 4.4 TO. That's a big gap.  Zach is my guy, and I think he's a better overall player, but there's nothing wrong with being honest and admitting that Young is in a totally different category as a playmaker."
"Zach is scoring and defending significantly better than Trae. His playmaking has been really good in its own right and I don’t think the gap between them as playmakers covers the gap in efficiency and defensive impact that LaVine has had. Team records are in the same range, I can see the Bulls going on an extended win streak after they clean up late game execution. They’re much better than their record right now."
"Bradley Beal, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic, CJ McCollum, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, James Harden, Collin Sexton, Zion Williamson, Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward, Devin Booker, Malcolm Brogdon, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Anthony Davis, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, De'Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell (Bam Adebayo, DeMar DeRozan, and Pascal Siakam are all above 19.5).   How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
trading them for zach lavine
Zach LaVine with 4.4 turnovers a game isn’t as bad as it sounds. I think you kind of get a pass when you are balling out of your mind despite being surrounded by arguably the shittiest team in the NBA.
This is another what if moment for the wolves. I really wanted a chance to see a Rubio/Lavine/Butler/Bjelica/KAT lineup out there... Gives you the chance to give Jimmy the max he wanted and probably outperforms our starting five from the Butler season.   Too bad Thibs played Zach a million minutes leading to the ACL tear. Think he was leading the league or close to it when he went down....
"Zach Lavine was once referred to as a negative player on here and empty stats guy  He’s got one of the most visually satisfying games in the league, he reminds me of kyrie as a sg"
"Westbrook vs Nets , Dame vs Bulls, Zach Lavine vs Hornets, Mcgrady vs Spurs, Kobe vs Suns... 4 more?"
You think you can get 3 1sts on top of the steal of the 1st round this past draft for Zach lavine? I guess you guys are keeping him
"East is loaded though. You still have Harden, Kyrie, Trae, Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Collin Sexton is improving quickly.  Not saying RJ has no chance, but good chance is a little optimistic imo  Though the Knicks do have a ton of fans so it’s possible he gets voted in"
Zach LaVine acquired by the Knicks.
"Lavine and Simmons are totally different players. Lavine is 1 yr older than Simmons while being miles ahead as a scorer. Simmons is a better primary ballhandler and defender. I don't think the Bulls would want to restart and build around Simmons. Simmons is the type of player you want when you already have a top 3 big like Embiid, a secondary scorer in Tobias, and shooters like Green and Seth.   Bulls, Wizards, and 76ers fans are all homers, so we will all disagree on the value of each of our players. My take is that Lavine is as good of a scorer in NBA outside of Harden/KD/Dame/Steph. He has never had an allstar teammate on the Bulls, so it's unfair to assert what he would play like if he had a top 10 player in Embiid and another polished scorer in Tobias. I like Simmons, but if Bulls traded Zach for him, I wouldn't be super excited tbh. I can nvr picture Simmons carrying a team offensively - mostly because he hasnt developed a jumpshot and teams are letting him shoot. Again these are my honest unfiltered opinions, and I definitely respect any disagreement, but this is sort of how most of the Bulls subreddit sees Simmons"
"Ref in the corner was in a bad spot to call the foul. One of the other two should have gotten it.  Then again, how does Zach ""46 inch vert"" LaVine lose that jump ball?"
"Zach LaVine and Beal both deserve to be all stars, yet probably won’t make it because of their teams record."
Lol Zach Lavine lost the jump ball???
zach lavine should just leave atp
"&gt; Lavigne  I like to imagine Zach Lavine holds a massive grudge against Avril Lavigne, just based off how many people have misspelled his name because of her."
GTJ wrapped the ball up on Zach LaVine and then somehow won the jump ball against him.
Blake is the whitest looking light skin guy I’ve ever seen other than Zach LaVine
"How does Zach LaVine lose a jump ball to Gary Trent, Jr.?!?"
"I don't think he can make it with the amount of games he's missed.       These players should all make it before him for the final team:  |East|Pos|Team| :--|:--|:--| |Kyrie Irving|G|BRK|.   |Bradley Beal|G|WAS| |Kevin Durant|F|BRK| |Joel Embiid|F|PHI| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|F|MIL| |Trae Young|G|ATL| |James Harden|G|BRK| |Jayson Tatum|F|BOS| |Khris Middleton|F|MIL| |Domantans Sabonis|F|IND| |Zach LaVine|WC|CHI| |Jaylen Brown|WC|BOS|.

Zach Lavine lost a jump contest?!?! WHAT?
Zach lavine boutta marry a stripper
"Back to Back Threes, Game winning buzzer beater, Step Back Dagger. Dame time breaks hearts and franchises.   Zach Lavine on trade watch after this game."
"""its a bad shot""  -zach lavine"
Bruh that draft was so bad lol   Also could’ve had Zach Lavine
"Huh, I didn't know Zach Lavine was shooting that well."
"That's fair. Just comparing the two it looks like it'll be close especially since they're likely both competing for the wild card spots:      |Player|Tm|G|MP|FG%|3P|3P%|FT%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|PTSV|WL Record| |:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Zach LaVine|CHI|17|35.6|.502|3.4|.397|.876|5.2|5.3|1.3|0.6|27.0|7-10| |Bam Adebayo|MIA|16|32.6|.579|0.1|.400|.859|9.1|5.6|0.8|0.8|20.1|6-12|.      ----      Ingram as a West selection is interesting, there isn't a tremendous amount of great front court players in the West that he's competing with so he might sneak in with a bottom 5 record. If the Pels do get an All star I wouldn't be surprised if its Zion."
Zach lavine
"Miles Bridges, Zach Lavine and Bradley Beal"
"I know this is probably a joke, but I was watching the jump 2 days ago, And Matt barnes and Kendrick perkins both said this exact thing. They said we'd have to trade for Zach Lavine or Bradley Beal to be looked at as contenders"
ZACH LAVINE
Zach Lavine
The youre kidding on zach lavine?
Dont feel bad at all for empty stats. At least thats what people say when zach lavine balls and bulls lose. Keep the same energy :).
Bro what about Zach Lavine ? That’s who people are saying is better
I'm long Zach Lavine
"if we get people to post on reddit and social media, we might actually be able to. Also Zach LaVine needs to be an allstar too"
"Yeah I think the guard position has less depth.  Kyrie, Harden, Jaylen and Beal  (hot take) Zach Lavine will get in as one of the other positionless spots"
"don't forget blake griffin, zach lavine, aaron gordon and pretty much all nba dunk champion"
"&gt; while Lavine is a bit more efficient   ""a bit"" lol...lavine's true shooting % is 7% higher. Only SG's who have more assists per game than Lavine is Harden, Paul George, VanVleet. He is the better defender and the Bulls have had the 10th hardest Stength of Schedule so far, while the Hawks have the 21st. Trae is a special talent and will be great for many years, but that doesn't mean he's having a better yr than Zach, Sexton, or Brogdon right now"
Zach Lavine
"Zach Lavine is a reserve, end of question"
"I feel you, and while I don’t necessarily think record should play a role in all star spots, it always does. See: Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal, etc"
"Zach Lavine should probably make it this year 27 points per game on a .642 true shooting percentage, to go along with 5 rebound and 5 assists a game."
His style honestly reminds me of James Harden but he won’t be as good obviously. I think he could be a tier B star like victor oladipo pre injury. I’m not worried about his shooting splits. Zach LaVine for instance had god awful ones and was regarded to be one of the worst players in the nba his rookie year. Edwards has a good stroke so I’m not that concerned. His shot selection will improve. He shoots decent from the line.  Right now he gets absolutely hammered driving to the rack and is learning to just play into the contact instead of using his insane athleticism to go around it and put up a bad shot. He’s still learning what works and doesn’t in the nba as he’s been a player so athletically gifted that college scrubs couldn’t impede him. I think his big question will be can he put it all together.
"&gt;I mean, he has been playing well for a few years now but it hasn't translated to wins  It has when he's had a decent supporting cast. They made it out of the first round a couple times and had 5+ 40 wins season.  This isn't a Zach Lavine situation per say (not that Lavine has a ton of help either).  Beal is out there doing everything he can with what he has. If he changed up his game or didn't play, Washington would be winless."
"At this rate, by the year 2022, every player will wear a different jersey color. It will be madness! JTOs (Jersey Turn Overs) will be a new stat for when you accidentally pass to someone on the other team because of their jersey. The league leaders in JTOs will be James Harden, Zach LaVine, and the colorblind."
"If some people were wondering about the presence of outliers, I've created a sorted table using interquartile range (IQR) as a measure of consistency.    |**Rk**|**PLAYER**|**TEAM**|**PPG**|**PPG SDev**|**PPG IQR**| --:|:--|:--|--:|:--|:--| |12|Jayson Tatum|BOS|26.6|±6.3|±6.0| |22|Christian Wood|HOU|23.5|±4.0|±6.0| |18|Jerami Grant|DET|24.3|±6.3|±6.0| |16|LeBron James|LAL|25.2|±6.8|±6.75| |2|Kevin Durant|BKN|30.4|±5.9|±7.0| |17|Collin Sexton|CLE|24.8|±7.5|±7.5| |11|CJ McCollum|POR|26.7|±7.4|±8.0| |21|Paul George|LAC|23.9|±6.8|±8.5| |1|Bradley Beal|WAS|34.4|±9.1|±8.75| |25|Donovan Mitchell|UTA|23.4|±6.7|±9.0| |22|Nikola Vucevic|ORL|23.5|±7.7|±9.8| |14|Kawhi Leonard|LAC|25.9|±6.1|±10.0| |15|Nikola Jokic|DEN|25.4|±6.7|±10.5| |24|Zion Williamson|NOP|23.4|±7.5|±10.8| |7|Jaylen Brown|BOS|27.3|±7.4|±11.5| |9|Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|27|±8.4|±12.0| |3|Damian Lillard|POR|28.7|±8.9|±13.5| |7|Luka Doncic|DAL|27.3|±8.5|±13.8| |9|Zach LaVine|CHI|27|±9.5|±14.5| |4|Stephen Curry|GSW|28.4|±11.7|±15.5| |20|James Harden|BKN|24|±11.5|±17.5| |19|Gordon Hayward|CHA|24.1|±10.0|±18.0| |5|Kyrie Irving|BKN|28.1|±7.3|±18.3| |6|Joel Embiid|PHI|27.7|±10.7|±18.3| |13|Trae Young|ATL|26.1|±11.5|±19.8|  What is interesting to note is the prevalence of high volume three point shooters at the bottom (LaVine, Curry, Harden, Irving, Young).  As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."
"Honestly Chicago Bulls. This team lacks of primary playmaker and also Ben should play point forward he can defend all 5 positions can switch to everybody. Chicago Bulls starting 5 is full of shooting specialists.   He can play 4 with Markkanen at the 5 and can cover Markkanen's lack of post defending and also he can play point guard for them and they can let White to be microwave scorer.  Garrett Temple, Zach Lavine, Patrick Williams/Otto Porter Jr, Ben Simmons, Lauri Markkanen five is balanced can be effective on both sides."
Wow he is so overrated youd take him over Dbook? Zach Lavine is better than Donovan Mitchell. If Dbook or Lavine played with Gobert they would be seen as way better. He puts a blanket over Mitchell’s problems which makes him seem sm better than he is
"Ahead of Luka Doncic, Zach LaVine, Kawhi Leonard, and Anthony Davis as a top 25 offensive player. Biased media never giving Lakers or ex-Lakers their fair shake. Sad!"
Donovan Mitchell. He’s as good as guys like Zach Lavine but Mitchell gets treated by everybody like he’s the next elite pg and the face of his team. He isn’t even the face of the team and if Lavine had a guy like Gobert to cover his flaws then he would be touted higher than Mitchell
Bah! Hilarious.  I guess Zach Lavine is practically top 10 then as well.

Zach LaVine
I feel like Bulls are just missing an amazing player. In my mind Zach Lavine is a good #2. Imagine he had a Lebron type player and he could the kyrie.
Zach Lavine to Pelicans   Ingram to Bulls   Whos says no?
"Zach lavine seems to have taken a leap too since his days in minnesota, though part of that might just be the normal development of a player going through their early 20s"
One thing I’ll always remember about Zach Lavine is how upset he looked when the Wolves drafted him lol
Lavine took it as a language elective in hs but the rest of story needs no other context.   https://www.theguardian.com/personal-investments/ng-interactive/2017/feb/14/zach-lavine-nba-deaf-school-timberwolves-signlanguage
i like zach lavine
"Just a random heads up - do you know that the god awful bulls are actually better without lavine on the court?   I like Zach, seems like a top guy, but his impact is nowhere near what his raw numbers look like"
I’m a Blazers fan but now I love Zach Lavine.
"I feel like the Twolves has the one of worst scouting and player development in the NBA. I can't think of any draft pick outside of Zach Lavine or Towns who worked out for the Twolves. Unlike Miami, OKC, Utah who develops late 1st round and 2nd round picks to decent rotation players and starters.  TLDR: Twolves Management is poopoo 💩"
Is zach lavine our new favorite guy on r/nba
"I felt I generally could relate to him and being a laker fan I didn’t like how everyone treated him. Like irl his game fits mine I’m not super athletic or can shoot but I can play make and defend. Honestly my top 5 favorites wouldn’t even sound like I watch basketball  Lonzo, Kobe, Jr Smith, Klay Drose/Zach Lavine tied at 5th spot. Not to mention he’s really fucking solid like who doesn’t like a PG with IQ that isn’t ball dominant and is pass 1st like what’s he averaging rn 12/7/7? Who couldn’t use that on their team rn? People call him a bum and he’s far from it"
Zach LaVine just seems like a genuine person
"My takes on LaVine have always ended up right because I’ve been around this game for long enough to know a special player when I see one. This goes back to before we matched his offer sheet and 50%+ of yall cried about it.   Coaches around the league know Zach is an All Star since last year, only thing that matters now is being a 10th seed or better to get him in."
Welp guess I'm a Zach LaVine fan now
Zach LaVine is the man. I asked him if we could take a picture one time and if we could make the picture look like we are talking about something important and he was down 😂  https://imgur.com/a/q6SrbJb
"People still think Booker &gt; Lavine? But yeah I agree, Zach might not be top 20 this season, but I don't care really. He's great to watch so far."
"Yep.   Zach LaVine deserves a lot of props for helping out that Greek reporter.   Meanwhile Kyrie calls the media ""pawns""."
Bleacher Report: Three trades that could make Zach Lavine a Greek reporter.
ZACH LAVINE
"Homie’s journal be like   “I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Zach LaVine. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Zach. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.”"
"It's Christos Tsaltas, he works for SDNA and [here's his last article](https://www.sdna.gr/mpasket/802389_zak-labin-o-apolytos-igetis-ton-fetinon-mpoyls) about the bulls and Zach Lavine. It's in Greek obviously"
"So, yes, while the commercial breaks are the same, we could be watching tip off at 8pm eastern time that fits really well into our daily schedule, but in Greece, it’s 7 hours ahead, meaning the same game is happening 3am their time. I could get a beer and watch the game with friends no problem, but watching and interviewing at 3am takes serious dedication. It was a zoom call, so the guy interviewing likely had stayed up solely to do the interview, and it would’ve really sucked to do all that and not even get your question answered.   I don’t know if he was left for last because he was doing so from Europe, but I do know that it shows thoughtfulness from Zach Lavine to still make sure the question got answered. It doesn’t mean anyone who DIDN’T do so is an asshole, but anyone who DID do what Zach did, did something nice that perhaps the majority of people would not have done."
That's because Zach LaVine is a fucking real one
Zach lavine did it last week https://mobile.twitter.com/chicagobulls/status/1367280078615420930
"I legit think that if Aaron Gordon won, he would've given a speech challenging Zach Lavine to run it back next season. Good GOD Wade really robbed us of what could've been the GOAT dunk contest rivalry."
Bargain bin Zach Lavine in general. Like if Zach never figured out how to shoot.
"It’s an absolute beast of a dunk, but like Kenny(?) said there was a viral video of Zach Lavine doing this dunk a week ago"
Yeah it's unsustainable.  He's not among the best midrange shooters of all time.  Frankly I think the no fans is having a big affect on shooting in general.  So many guys putting up percentages that don't make sense.  Zach Lavine is at 65% TS right now lol.  That number used to just be Curry and some dunk-only big guys.
"yep. I really dont want Oladipo either.   To be fair, Oladipo was at least very good at one point, while Wiggins has never been anything besides an average starter who gets too many shots   The ceiling on Dipo is higher, but we also dont know if he's washed, so the floor is much lower. I wanted Zach Lavine before the season. I dont want these low efficiency/high ppg real hooper guys"
Yes and it’s not even close. Also this was the weakest dunk contest in recent memory. Maybe 2 impressive dunks and one was stolen from Zach LaVine who did it better duro be layup lines?
"It was so boring. I don’t think any dunk was prepared besides simons grab off of the circle which wasn’t really so impressive. The only two that really impressed me were toppins last two, one of which he stole from Zach Lavine"
I mean it was pretty good just a few years ago with Zach Lavine and Aaron Gordon. And Derrick Jones jr. this year was just a weird one that not even kids would find entertaining I think. For all the old heads out there.. sorry nothing is going to top dunks like Jordan and VC. Cuz they did it first . But don’t cancel it the kids still like it and it’s still better than nothing
"the problem is more that none of the best players compete anymore, much like the 3 point contest. it's become a competition of specialists, not the actual best players. zach lavine is the only dunk contest participant in recent years who was also a good player in other areas."
"The Golden State Warriors reportedly have interest in a trade for Victor Oladipo, according to Kevin O'Connor of The Ringer.  O'Connor noted this shows the team's plans to add another ball-handler in the mold of Andre Iguodala or Shaun Livingston, who each played key roles during the team's three NBA titles.  Oladipo has appeared in 15 games with the Houston Rockets since coming over in a January trade from the Indiana Pacers, averaging 19.9 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.7 assists with his new team.  The 28-year-old is set to become a free agent in the offseason.  Several big names have already changed teams this season, including James Harden heading to the Brooklyn Nets as part of a blockbuster four-team deal and Derrick Rose returning to the New York Knicks from the Detroit Pistons.   The Pistons are keeping Blake Griffin on the bench for the time being as they continue to explore trade opportunities for the six-time All-Star. The Cleveland Cavaliers are also holding Andre Drummond out of games in hopes of dealing him.   Teams will try to pursue other impact players such as Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine ahead of the March 25 deadline, while a young playmaker like Lonzo Ball or veteran role players like JJ Redick, George Hill and P.J. Tucker could all be on the move to help contenders.  For more NBA coverage, check out B/R's surprise landing spots for the league's top trade targets.

DJJ has the bargain bin Zach Lavine dunk package.
the craziest part of all this is someone in the NBA saying they looked up to Zach Lavine looking back at his rookie days
"Zach Lavine is beyond ass, no wonder chicago are where they are."
Of course we’ve seen it before. We’ve seen them all before. I honestly think I could jump over somebody and dunk a basketball I’ve seen it done so many times but that’s not the point. What’s wrong with a new take on an old classic?  There’s only so many dunks you can do so I think the aesthetic is an important component. It’s funny he mentions Zach Lavine because I feel like part of what made his dunks so special were how flawless and smooth they were. Like poetry in flight. Ha!
"Kawhi and Beal did in the end, but Zach Lavine already did too much damage being ass."
"Guys like Mitchell, Zach Lavine, Jayson Tatum really are still miles away from the superstar group, when you put them together like this it’s so obvious."
"They're still pretty stacked. Dudes just aren't playing. Zach Lavine shoulda been running the fast break as much as he was out there, trying to get dunks....instead hes just shooting everything.   Did Kawhi even score at all?   Beal airballed his first shot."
"Zach Lavine is beyond ass, no wonder chicago are where they are."
Zach Lavine is beyond ass.
We need a Zach Lavine dunk
"The way I rank dunks....if it ain't Jordan Kilganon-esque I'm not impressed. This year's contest was the worst I've ever seen, the best dunk imo was the one where Kenny said ""if Zach Lavine didn't already do it in a layup line it would be a 50"". It shoulda been a 50 because it was different.    Maybe the NBA should change the contest to an invitational where you have the best dunkers in the world, against the best dunkers the NBA has to offer."
That was bad...surely they couldve let zach lavine make a cameo dunk. Dudes really out here kissing the rim
"Yeah, but Josh Smith gave Steph's contest winning shot an 8, so Zach Lavine actually won."
its a crime zach lavine has not gotten a lob dunk yet
"Everybody won't be as athletic or flexible as AG or Zach LaVine so why expect that every year? Question what were you gonna do in those 30 mins? Yes the dunk contest wasn't the best but it was by no means bad, people will compare things and will always be disappointed that what they are comparing will most likely never live up to what they expect from whole new players"
So I’m an nba casual. Don’t know much. Why didn’t they have aaron gordon or Zach lavine back? I’ve never heard of these dudes and their dunks were pretty whelming
"Was quite a bit inside free throw line though, zach lavine did it way better"
I don’t wanna see a dunk contest without Aaron Gordon or Zach Lavine ever again in my life
Those were pretty lame dunks... everyone sitting on the bench could do that. He was right to say no one was hyped. Aaron Gordon and Zach Lavine was special.
Aaron Gordon and Zach lavine really spoiled us and it shows
Zach Collins and Dejounte Murray got some good bone structure. Zach Lavine could steal my girl too
Zach Lavine&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Kenny. “It would’ve been a 50... if Zach Lavine didn’t do it last week”
get zach lavine in
Aaron Gordon and Zach Lavine really set the bar way too high lol
Zach Lavine literally did it in the layup lines a couple weeks ago
"Zach Lavine, Lebron, A Gordon, Kevin Durant, Embiid. Need these guys in the next one to save this shit event."
Did Aaron Gordon &amp; Zach Lavine really kinda ruin this competition by being so good
"This mid af, zach lavine probably so disappointed"
Either Aaron gordon or zach lavine have to be in it or it's automatically a trash contest
Zach lavine did that dunk
Zach Lavine
Zach Lavine and Aaron Gordon put the dunk contest standard to the moon lmao
"""*Yawn.*"" - Zach Lavine"
If that was Zach lavine wouldve been a 50. Don't think this dunk was worse than the other 2...
Imagine Zach lavine just getting up and throwing one down
"Suck my dick no one cares about Zach Lavine, Jaylen’s better"
Proper spelling: Zach LaVine
zach lavine is the most underrated superstar in the league
I just want to see one amazing dunk from Zach LaVine
Zach Lavine better win most improved player
Zach Lavine is the version of a player every basketball kid/adult daydreams of being.
Zach Lavine is so underrated
"Zach Lavine, let’s gooooo"
"Zach LaVine was the better dunker than Gordon, he just made it all look effortless which is why he doesn't get the credit he deserves"
Zach Lavine looks like one of those filler characters that they make for the MyCareer story mode
"zach lavine is someone who can win the dunk contest, 3 point contest, and all star game mvp."
Future Piston Zach LaVine
“Feel like I’ve been playing at this level for years now”  Zach Lavine is a cocky fuck with a big ego
sheesh zach lavine is looking FRESH
Y'all bow down to your lord and savior Zach Lavine
Zach Lavine is handsome
Zach Lavine is so likeable
"Lavine has also been forced into a PG like role at times because the Bulls haven't had a good pass-first PG since he's been here, and he's worse at it than Booker. Turns the ball over too much when asked to be the primary ballhandler. That being said I think his insane scoring efficiency this year probably puts him over Booker, the Bulls have relied on Zach to carry the offense late in games."
"&gt;""Trae Young is the 19th most popular player in the league"" is hardly a flex.  I would say being top 20 without being on a playoff team counts as pretty popular.   &gt;Also, last year, he had 2.8m votes on a team that was outside the playoffs.   Yeah, that's hard to do. Last year was his breakout and his team was complete garbage, this year he had a better supporting cast and was held more accountable for their underperformance.   &gt;His popularity is declining as a result of all the controversy with his playstyle.  This is a fun narrative, but I don't think it's actually true from a fan perspective.   He plays on a mid-market team that's performing poorly, and his stats aren't better than last year. His conference also got more competition at the Guard spot, with Kyrie being healthy, Brad Beal leading the league in scoring(and having snub sympathy from last year), Zach Lavine and Jaylen Brown breaking out, and James Harden joining the conference.   If you somehow put Trae Young's perception from last year in a time capsule, and open it up this year, he still gets way less votes.  If the Hawks were where the Knicks are Trae makes the All-Star team pretty easily."
"Considering his team was solidly out of playoff position at the time of the vote, and there were breakout players like Jaylen Brown and Zach Lavine, I think that qualifies as popular.   It's really hard to make the All-Star team from a bottom team, especially as a backcourt player. Brad Beal had to get snubbed last year and lead the league in scoring this year to do it."
"Yes Book was only able to put up point guard esque assist:to numbers next to rubio who is less ball dominant, not the on ball creator that Paul is. Book is playing the same role as Lavine and Zach is just on a different level of efficiency."
"This season wise, individually I think Zach is already better than both of them. But team success does have its space when we rate individual players and he's the least successful out of all those guys so far. If Lavine starts winning playoff series as the #1 option, I'd probably put him over them."
&gt;zach lavine is putting up better numbers  I mean Lavine has been shooting like Curry this whole year tho. I agree with you tho
It took Zach lavine and Julius Randle 7yrs to become an all-star. Kawhi became one in his 5th season. You can't write each one of them off because not every player is placed in a good situation after getting drafted. Not every one of them gets adequate amount of time or resources to develop themselves into a better player.   Some might be busts and you can see that right away but saying timberwolves and warriors will regret not picking lamelo is dumb.
is he? zach lavine is putting up better numbers and kyrie has struggled pretty badly over the last 6 games Hes having a great year but i woudlnt say mvp.
Okay if we're going to say not all top nine records are equal then we can also say not all statistical accumulations are equal to right? If you're not going to reward a guy for being by far the best player on one of the record-wise best teams in the NBA why should we reward someone like Zach LaVine or Zion for putting up awesome numbers on a struggling team (these guys have been great I'm not taking a shot of them I'm just arguing towards the validity of an all-star birth in conjunction with the concept of that it's supposed to also be related to team success as well). If you say the Spurs not blowing guys out should take away from their record then I could equally argue that some of the guys putting up awesome numbers but their teams losing should not be given as much credence as guys putting up awesome numbers and their teams winning. In regards to demars plus and minus he assured the floor a lot with two of the spurs most promising young prospects in Johnson and Walker. Both of them are also currently a huge work in progress defensively but pop has for the most part allowed them to play through a lot of their mistakes with the idea of the end result being worth the growing pains. It feels really weird that this subreddit always turns me into a huge DeMar DeRozan defender because I could have never imagined that a year or two ago. And I respect where you're coming from man No hard feelings or anything. But I truly believe he has become quite frankly the most underappreciated player in the NBA.
oooooo we got a three way - wait who is tha **BY GOD IT'S ZACH LAVINE FROM THE TOP ROPE**
"My understanding is that alot of these stats like matchup difficulty and dFG% at the rim arent incorporated into your latest metric LEBRON correct? Is that something you guys are considering doing at some point and are just trying to figure out how or is it something you've found doesnt actually help improve your model and make it more predictive year to year by incorporating that? I know ESPN RPM has tried incorporating tracking data in recent years and its led to uhhh some rather bizarre data  One thing Ive noticed also comparing EPM to LEBRON is that some of these defensive guards like Zach LaVine and Bradley Beal seem to be more penalized for their defense by your metric than EPM. Any thoughts on that, do you think guys like LaVine and Beal are as detrimental on that end as your models say or are they overly penalized due to factors like who their teammates are."
So you think that Aaron Gordon and Zach Lavine shouldn’t have ever been in the contest?
We really coulda made a fire comeback but the truth is that Zach Lavine was just incredibly clutch in the 4th. Every time we shrunk the lead a bit Lavine would hit some damn shot to keep them ahead

most people wouldn't even recognize zach lavine in a lineup
"Man, to see what Zach Lavine is doing as a volume shooter and the #1 focal point of an offense, is sensational. I don’t think people realise how hard it is to do what Zach is doing right now."
"I agree, Zach Lavine would be a good return."
"Nah, Lavine-Gordon could have gone either way and no one should be mad Zach won, as well as no one would have the right to complain if AG won. That being said, he was robbed against DJJ and it's not even up for debate."
I’m not saying you guys should trade him I meant that media will probably push Zach Lavine trade thing like they did with Beal
If you read Bleacher Report Zach Lavine is available for a Mountain Dew and tin of Skoal.
"**Scenario Example:**  *You have O'Neal and Gobert back on defense. Gobert is already retreating under the rim, arms up, ready.*  Say you are the Kings; with Fox, Barnes, and Heild running the floor. Heild sprints to the corner 3, while Fox and Barnes attack. Fox is stopped by O'Neal--pass to Barnes-- who meets Gobert at the block.   Were still on a 3-2 fastbreak. Should Barnes take this contested layup or should he pass it out to Buddy Heild for a wide open 3?   What if its Jamal Murray? What if its Zach LaVine? Is Jimmy Butler hitting a trailing Duncan Robinson for a wide open 3pt still a bad shot?   **CONTEXT**"
"As a Bulls fan, I think about this with Zach LaVine. Realistically, the sides will never meet. Bulls would probably ask for at least 2 firsts and a young player, but probably 3 firsts. Problem is you can’t trade away too many first in a row, but would wants 3 first spread over 6 years if you’re really trying to rebuild (Sam Presti is the obvious exception to the rule)."
Well Zach LaVine and Aaron Gordon were pretty good.
"Zach LaVine could do both 3 point and slam. I wonder if anyone else has or could, legitimately"
Zach lavine
My money's on Zach LaVine
"I thought the Timberwolves would be competing for a title by 2020 when they had Wiggins and KAT win back to back ROTYs and had Zach Lavine as well.  In 2018, when boston got to the ECF without Kyrie and Hayward, I thought they were about to go to the finals next year vs GSW. Then Kawhi moved to the east in the offseason and Boston had a bunch of issues."
bet Zach Lavine to win this
"Interestingly, the dunk contest has a history of catching a lot of players before their true ascent into super stardom, so it creates this perpetual cycle where it feels like there’s no stars entering each year only to look back in hindsight and realize there’s names everywhere.   Just in the last 10 years or so, all-star caliber contestants have included Dwight Howard, Zach LaVine, Victor Oladipo, Donovan Mitchell, Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Giannis Antetokounmpo, John Wall, Mason Plumlee, Damian Lillard, Paul George, Serge Ibaka, and Blake Griffin."
"Zach LaVine is not on the trade block.  Lauri Markkanen is not on the trade block.  The second best player on the Bulls is Thaddeus Young, even though he's coming off the bench.  He may not be starting, but he's playing in the fourth quarter.  And he often plays just under 30 minutes per game, particularly in close games.    However, the Bulls are listening to offers for Young and may well trade him.  Or they may hold onto him in the hopes of getting the team some playoff experience. They really can't lose either way."
Draymond and Zach Lavine.
Doubt they can get Zach Lavine.
Tbf there is merit in holding assets if you're waiting for a real top player to become available. Like if you're hoping someone like Harden (obvs not actually him but he's the most recent player of that caliber to be available) to become available it's much more worth than blowing your load on a zach lavine.
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d’anglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don’t think there’s ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
"&gt;Compare this season with LaVine.  Not a fair comparison, Zach's the first scoring option, Jamal is the second. Also Jamal was injured at the beginning of the season, he literally played the most minutes in the bubble and got very little time to recover which Zach didn't have to go through. I agree with you that the Nuggets don't have valuable assets to trade other than Jamal and MPJ.  Anyways recently  Jamal and Zach's stats are nearly identical.  Zach's last 10: 31/5/4 on 54 FG%/48 3PT%/ 82 FT%  Jamal's last 10: 29/5/4 on 55 FG%/50 3PT%/90 FT%  &gt;and Porter has off the court issues and is just as bad defensively if not worse.  MPJ has matured a bit this season and has improved both defensively and offensively he's literally only 22."
Adding today’s game Duncan moves up to ties with Zach Lavine

A lot of Despite the Loss players out there. Zach LaVine is a Perennial Despite the Loss All-Star up to this point.
Are you gonna give me a choice? No shit I would take him in a league where there is a salary cap. But if I have to pick between players on similar contracts like Zach Lavine I'd take Zach 10/10
How is Zach LaVine not even mentioned under MIP?
They actually don't have similar playstyles. Jaylen Brown plays nothing like Donovan Mitchell or Zach Lavine. So on top of not being a SG.. he doesn't belong here lol
Would you take LaMelo over somebody like Zach LaVine for example?
"I'm assuming this is from that other thread, so I'll just throw my own two cents for discussion.   First of all, imo saying Lavine/Trae are a level higher is not an insult to Murray, it's just recognizing roles.   With similar stats, I would always consider the players that have less help, face more defensive attention, and are the primary player on their team a level higher. You can't dismiss playing yearly on a contender with an MVP caliber player versus playing on a bottom tier team where defenses absolutely key in on you. It's not discrediting Murray's numbers, it's providing context.   Lavine has put up the same splits as Murray is recently all year without any help before the Vucevic trade. Murray is stile an elite scorer, but we don't and can't know how he would fare with very little help and without multiple scoring threats around him.   Trae literally carries an entire offense on his shoulders, he's responsible for a ridiculous amount of their scoring through points and assists. Lavine isn't a great playmaker but is scoring on insane splits for his volume. Trae and Zach are slightly over 30% usage versus Murray at 25% and are dealing with much more defensive attention. There's so many intangible impacts that come from the difference in roles that can't be captured by stats only (fatigue, adapting to opponent gameplan, defensive effort, spacing from teammates, etc)   If it makes the argument any better, I'm not saying Jamal ISN'T on their tier, it's more that we don't know that he's on that tier yet because he hasn't had to be. So based only on what we've seen and what we know, I'd argue Trae and Lavine are one tier up.   One thing to add: I'd say at his hottest, he's easily on these guys' level, maybe even higher at times like the playoffs. But consistency matters, 25 game stretches don't indicate a full player"
"Just wait for the outrage when people realize that 4 of Donovan Mitchell, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Kyrie Irving, Zach LaVine and Bradley Beal wont even make an All NBA team this year. Have no idea which 2 even should of that group"
"Cut Zach Lavine.   He is a really good scorer, but the other two are better imo"
"Hell, why not Zach LaVine? He's only 5 months older than Porzingis. Come to think of it, LeBron is pretty good too. What even is this list"
"Zach Lavine is what people think Devin Booker is. But then again, I'm biased as a Bulls fan"

"I'm with you. I also think about Kawhi's high release when I'm in the midrange. Yeah the guy is so strong idk how he shoots the same way from deep. Looks like the ball is made of cement when he shoots but not in a bad way.  I definitely can't keep the same form for threes. I'll think about Zach Lavine, cause of his strong legs, with a lower release. I think Evan Fournier actually has a very sweet stroke. I can't get my release so high like so many nba guys, so trying to copy Fournier works for me."
Going from Aaron Gordon to Zach Lavine has to be one of the biggest differentials of all time.   What an upgrade for Nikola Vucevic
"But you failed to mention the countless other teams that probably thought the same as you and ended up with egg on their face.   The goal is to play well and potentially move up because 4 and 5 which is there for the taking. Are you're telling me you have no confidence in beating the Heat, Hawks, Charlotte, Boston, Indiana, etc? Are you really a fan? Yes, you're probably a mediocre team but so is the rest of the Eastern Conference outside the top three. You might get lucky with an injury? Maybe Zach LaVine catches ultimate fire in the playoffs?"
"Well what other explanation is it lol  This happens to Steph Curry, kyrie irving, and Zach lavine  It happened to derrick rose.  Some players get way less calls than they deserve   Are you saying that it's a conspiracy? Because I'm saying it's a simple answer. Refs are biased toward certain players."
"Scoring title is just about total points, not offensive value. For example Zach lavine scores more points then nikola jokic, but jokic is more valuable offensively. But I agree about DPOY."
"1-10  Steph Curry, D Rose, Joakim Noah, Jimmy Butler, Klay Thompson, Scottie Pippen, Michael Jordan,  Zach Lavine,  Russel Westbrook, Dennis Rodman"
zach lavine cannot be stopped
"Thanks for the answer.   I checked out the RAPTOR info, some interesting names nearby Wiseman on the graph for rookie seasons like Sexton, Zach Lavine, and Poku"
This reminds me of people who state don't worry about rookies having a lot of interceptions because Peyton Manning did his rookie year. Ya but his team was terrible and he still had almost 3800 yards which was a lot at the time and he was improving as the season went on. With Anthony Edwards he is on a bad team but I wouldn't compare him to Lebron man that is just going to open up for criticism. I would look at Zach Lavine and Booker who were inefficient at the start and became very efficient later on.
Zach Lavine
"Id say its 75% scouting, 25% development.  The example i always use is to look at all the timberwolves busts they've draft.  Now name 1 who went on to do anything significant after leaving the Wolves?  And don't tell me Lavine.  Zach was putting up 18 ppg on the wolves in his third season before he tore his ACL  The wolves can't identify talent , thats their problem.  Look at Jarrett culver.  This guy was drafted 6th two years ago and he'll be lucky to be in the league 3 years from now"
"&gt;You don’t even have a point  Kyrie Irving - 28 on 61 TS  Luka Doncic - 29 on 60 TS  Dame Lillard - 30 on 62 TS  Giannis - 29 on 63 TS  Jokic - 26 on 65 TS  Embiid - 30 on 65 TS  Zach Lavine - 28 on 64 TS  Beal - 31 on 60 TS  Curry - 29 on 64 TS  &amp;#x200B;  Okay, there's the point. He is statistically not a top 5 scorer in the league."
"Zach Lavine said in an interview that Wiggins works as hard as him.  And honestly I rather have Wiggins defense and offense (2 way Wiggins), than Lavine offense and bad defense!"
I knew I’d be missing an obvious one. Zach LaVine as well if we want to count that
"More like will love to see Zach Lavine, vc and Aaron Gordon together in a dunk contest. All in their prime and with proper judges"

Jordan Clarkson. I felt like he had that bounce like an all star. Thought he could’ve gotten to that Zach Lavine level.
Gordon Hayward Jerami Grant Zach Lavine Vucci Mane are the few i could think of
"If only he even had a shred of Zach Lavine’s work ethic....  Strange now to think how differently their potentials were hyped up as teammates in Minnesota.  Lavine has gotten better every year, and is physically unrecognizable from his early dunk champ years.  Man works his butt off for sure.  Wiggins is a massive disappointment after getting paid."
Zach Lavine treats the Nets like United treats it’s customers
"I mean listen to any of the now-retired players. LeBron in his first few seasons traveled and double-dribbled all the time. You got guys like KCP, Zach LaVine, Rondae, hell Jaylen Brown had zero handles. So many guys in the last 10 years entered the league without at least passable dribbling or handles. Yeah you learn it over time or teams mask it but it was hilariously obvious in about 2014-2016 period where all the older players kept getting young players to foul, travel and turn it over without them realizing what had happened.   I remember one of the older refs, Joey or Dick Bavetta, talking about having to teach a player what double-dribble even was in the middle of a game, because he thought a pump fake was illegal"
Can we start referring to the Lavine-Vucevic duo as “Zach LaVuc”?
Zach and Lavine
One Zach Lavine for Furkan Korkmaz pls
ZACH LAVINE
Zach Lavine 😂
&gt;	Not a single player in history has ever come back from a serious injury and looked the same  Russ? Nique? Zach Lavine?
Off the top of my head I can think of Zach Lavine who tore his ACL and came back better
1st Team-  PG: Damian Lillard  SG: James Harden  SF: Giannis Antetokounmpo   PF: Zion Williamson  C: Nikola Jokic  ---------------------  2nd Team-  PG: Steph Curry  SG: Bradley Beal  SF: Zach LaVine  PF: Julius Randle  C: Nikola Vucevic
"Most of these examples are right except for Zach Lavine.   Lavine was mainly a spot-up shooter off the bench for UCLA. The fact that he already had a jumper along with an insane vertical is what led to Lavine being taken in the lottery despite having fairly mediocre stats.   The main things Zach improved to become the player he is today is his handles and situational awareness where he isn't overly settling for jumpers and instead uses his athleticism to drive to the rim more in half-court situations.  Kinda pedantic I know and doesn't go against your overall argument or anything, I just find it strange how often I see the narrative that Lavine didn't have a jumper appears."
Jamal Murray. Nugs are a bottom 10 team without Jokic but since Jokic is on the team Murray is seen as one of the leaders of a championship contending team. Without playing next to Jokic hed be seen as good but still worse than a Zach Lavine or devin booker and def wouldn’t have been paid a max deal and probably traded multiple times for being an idiot
"Damn, Zach LaVine is as close to making 0 shots in the paint as he is to Mt. Zion’s total.  Giannis is an outlier himself, but then Zion out-outliers Giannis, crazy.   Zion’s touch around the rim is comparable to Kyrie’s, but Zion has 6 inches and 100+ lbs on Kyrie. And he’ll continue to improve his finishing as he gets closer to his prime. (in theory anyways, development curves aren’t always the same player to player.)   Zion has the potential to be the 2020’s version of Shaq for paint dominance. Giannis is near the same echelon, but no one has dominated the paint like this since Prime Shaq. I’m excited to see how much more Zion can develop and where he ends up peaking. Is 32ppg/10rpg/4apg doable for Zion in the future?"
Zach lavine has been Injured
"Bulls fan here. I watch almost every game. Vuc and this team are gonna be fine. He and Zach both look a little shaky lately but they’ll find it. It takes time to gel and it’s not like Vuc is the only new piece. The offense has been pretty solid (mostly thanks to Thad, honestly) lately but the defense is awful. Unfortunately I don’t think Vuc and Lavine are gonna grow a ton on that side of the ball but the team as a whole has to figure it out."
I’m with you on that move too. But I’m just setting a floor for what I would consider a winning move   Ideally we get Zach Lavine. But I would take brogdon and Turner before I get stuck with year 3 of wiseman
Based on your title I’ll say Zach Lavine and 14 Lebrons.
"&gt; I think there’s less and less stars that seem to be in situations that would lead to a trade demand &gt;  &gt;   Nah people say this all the time and then stars still demand out. Just look at the stars on struggling teams and it's unlikely they'll want to stay, and the teams might just prefer to trade them away if the stars don't sign their extensions.  Watch out for Zach Lavine (extension eligible this offseason) and Sabonis."
Pretty much a guessing game but I'll go with Zach Lavine
"LMAO nice examples of good recent dunk contest, Dwight Howard from 13 years ago I guess fits in the recent category. Name some good dunk contest outside of Aaron Gordon and Zach Lavine in the last like 10 years. You can’t because the dunk contest has been absolute garbage because no name or fringe all star players compete in it. The dunk contest has been trash for years it became a joke when the jazz’s 13th man off the bench won it."
Forever the dunk contest outside of like 2 instances has been shit for years. We really forgetting Jeremy Evans winning the dunk contest. Outside of Aaron Gordon and Zach Lavine the entire thing has been pretty much trash. You can tell your like 20 years old because the dunk contest has been trash for years.

"I mean fair, sure, but full strength Zach Lavine and Vucevic are a .500 team at best.  They need another major piece if they have any dreams of getting past the first round of the playoffs."
"Our last 3 draft picks ( Lauri, WCJ and coby) have all turned out to be bad or below expectations. Right now Lavine is having his best season and If we still don't make the playoffs, he's gonna leave in FA.  We're in a similar kind of situation as the bucks with giannis. They had to push for jrue, we had to push for a second star.   Draft picks outside the top 5 are overrated anyways and we're too good to tank but still bad to make the playoffs. So we had to make a move.   The other important factor is the ability to attract FAs. Chicago is a big market but have failed to attract FAs due to the dumpster fire of a FO. Now that we have AKME who are looking to build a winning culture, we might be able to attract FAs to help Zach and Vuc."
"Vuc is in his prime, and he has the type of game that will age well, he easily has another 4-5 years of playing at a high level left in him.  Lavine has never been to the playoffs, a team making moves to build around him and bet on him to be the centerpiece of a playoff team could definitely be enough to convince him to stay.  Its not about how far we can make it with this team alone, its about making sure we can keep building on what we have. Zach is not going to stick around for us building through the draft and keep missing the playoffs, this way we can attract more free agents and possibly contend in a few years if we can show that we got something cooking.  Remember that the teams who landed top free agents were teams in the playoff picture like Nets and Clippers, not young non playoff teams."
&gt; Zach Lavine wasn’t dedicated enough to the way of the cool dunk.  Dude won two straight then figured he'd spend time actually becoming better at basketball.  Can't knock that.
Man deserves a lifetime achievement award for how long he’s stayed in the “cool dunks” game. Zach Lavine wasn’t dedicated enough to the way of the cool dunk.
"**Jimmy Butler Trades:**  - Jimmy Butler, Justin Patton(CHI) FOR Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn, Lauri Markkanen(MIN)  - Jimmy Butler, Justin Patton(MIN) FOR Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric and a 2022 2nd round pick  The Wolves came in with good intentions but came out worse with both Butler trades"
Zach Lavine so smooth.
Zach Lavine Donte DiVi Thanasis Antentkunmpo Mo Wagner..     You're right.
He's low key built like zach lavine.. looking athletic
go with the bulls! led by slamdunk legend zach lavine... hilights every game. watch the last dance in netflix for the team's lineage
"Not saying either loss. Both accomplished what they were trying to do. Bulls realized Lavine was the real deal and their guy for the future, and committed to building around him with proven talent instead of developing young guys. I don't knock them for it.   Bulls will be better next season even if they don't make the playoffs, having a full off season to build around Vooch and Zach should do them good."
Zach Lavine isn't horrible on defense. Mainly in 1-1 situations. He's useless at team Defense and it shows
"Lol you’re hilarious. You said Kyrie without Lebron is as successful as Lavine is, when that’s clearly not true. Zach has never been to the playoffs, Kyrie has more all star appearance then Lavine which is success, accolades are success. Cry"
"Zach Lavine has never made the playoffs. You really can’t just admit that Kyrie has a better career than Zach even if you exclude Lebron? Also nice of you to nitpick at the all star game mvp, I’m naming off their accolades to date, and Kyrie wins that argument clearly."
Kyrie without Lebron  5 x all star  All star game mvp  All nba second team  Rookie of the year  3pt contest champ  Zach Lavine:   1x all star  All nba rookie 2nd team  2x slam dunk champion  Kyrie’s career is decisively better than Zach’s.....
"Kyrie without LeBron to piggyback off of is as successful in the NBA as Zach Lavine is.  During his years with the Celtics, Boston was as good with him off the floor as they were when he played, and their best playoff run was the year he was out with a knee injury.  Nice that you respond with personal insults when you get called on misconstruing what I said, real classy."
"Trae Young probably won’t get all nba this year, for 1 it’s rare you get an all nba team without making all star(same reason Bradley put up 30 last season and was ignored), Devin Booker has inferior stats to Kyrie. While games played do matter many people have missed lots of time and still gotten in. Zach Lavine and Kyrie also have pretty even stats, the second factor is Kyrie plays on a winning team"

Nikola Jokic - 94 (59.2% TS) 6. Chris Paul - 87 (59.0% TS) 7. Jerami Grant - 83 (57.2% TS) 8. Joel Embiid - 80 (65.3% TS) 9. DeMar DeRozan - 74 (61.0% TS) 10. LeBron James - 74 (55.6% TS)
I feel better than I did at the beginning of the season but worse then I was expecting after the trade deadline.   Favorite thing has hands down been watching Zach LaVine take another step towards greatness and Patrick Willams doing P Will things.   Most disappointing is the Bulls not living up to expectations and losing very winnable games. Most frustrating thing is Lauri Markkanen.   I’m hoping in the next couple of months we make some moves to make a splash next season and maybe taste the playoffs.   Personally very happy with our rookies. Sad to see Gafford go and WCJ but hopefully they thrive in a new environment.
"This Michael Jackson guy might not even be top 5. Don’t sleep on Zach LaVine, might pass him soon."
Zach LaVine is pretty lethal off the dribble
When Zach Lavine gets healthy again (his ankle heals) I'll be curious to see what that team looks like.
Different context: The Knicks don't have to woo their franchise player. If Zach LaVine leaves the bulls would fade into the basement of the standings for a few years. Knicks have no playoff expectations and this is a surprise for them.
"Wiggins would be who he is wherever. Zach LaVine and KAT were improving and developing right alongside him and both turned out fine. Wiggins just doesn't care about basketball the same way most stars do and fits better as a role player who can put in a shift, use his athletic gifts, and be as far away from leadership responsibility as possible."
Remember when Facu's late game defense on Zach LaVine lead to us beating the Bulls a few games back?
"Based on what? He puts up 4 ppg more than LaVine on notably lower efficiency. LaVine is putting up 27.5 ppg on 64.2% TS, to Beal’s 31.3 ppg on 60.0% TS. Beal takes 3.4 more shots per game than Zach. Both are elite scorers, but no way Beal is “clearly better” than Zach who shoots a better percentage than Beal from both inside and outside the arc."
"He’s an awesome player but it’s hard to not deny that going from Cliff who is a wizard at putting bigs in a position to succeed defensively to Billy Donovan isn’t a major downgrade.  I think Billy can do great stuff for him on the offensive side in scenarios with Zach Lavine, but Zach needs to be healthy first."
"he literally plays because he's annoying as fk lmao the other day he annoyed trae young, now simmons, zach lavine"
"Yes, but outside of the top 30 or so players in the league I think fit/defense/versatility/contract become more important than having 1 or two star qualities. Kind of like a Klay Thompson vs Zach Lavine situation, Zach is probably a better “best” player on a team, but 9/10 teams would take Klay to build their team with  Edit: Kings, Magic, Rockets, Wolves, Knicks, Spurs, maybe more maybe less"
"Not Zach Lavine... More like, Prime Dwight and Kawhi on the same team."
"It's not blasphemy, it's just an awful comparison basketball-wise. Kobe was in the discussion for the best defensive guard in the league during the 3peat; Zach Lavine will most likely never even come close to that discussion in his entire career."
&gt; How did Hayward not make the all star team?   Kevin Durant  Domatas Sabonis  Julius Randle  James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons  Joel Embiid  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Nikola Vucevic  Zach Lavine  Bradley Beal
I’m one of the biggest Kobe haters on this sub and even I want to smack you for comparing him to Zach Lavine.
If you had to compare them to any modern pair of players (even not playing on the same team) who would you say they look like?  I would say Kobe was a Zach LaVine and Shaq was a more dominant Giannis  (There ain't nobody like prime Diesel)
*Zach LaVine has entered the chat*
"It’s not impossible at least for single seasons. Look at Zach Lavine. His jump in efficiency this season has been immense.   Lavine two seasons ago at the same age had roughly the same numbers Ingram has now, though less efficient.   Now whether they can string several seasons like that together like KD is obviously another matter, but that’s what makes KD what he is."
&gt;Do the bulls give it to him? How would this impact the bulls future if at all?  I think they made their big trades to figure exactly this out.  It was going to be tough to determine if Zach Lavine is a franchise caliber player while he was waiting for the rest of the roster to develop around him.  Making the trade for Vucevic and Theis puts them in solid contention for a playoff spot in the East where the new management can properly assess LaVine's contributions in that crucible.  Vucevic's deal goes for one extra year to LaVine's but can easily be traded in that final year to a contender should the new brass ultimately decide LaVine is not going to be their franchise cornerstone moving forward.
Zach Lavine?
He's really going to let this the define his entire career. Zach LaVine and Derek Jones Jr must be laughing at this clown
"&gt; Everyone would (still) like to remind Aaron Gordon that they don't give a shit.  Seriously though, he probably did win the first one against Zach LaVine; it was close, but I suppose you *could* say he was robbed. But he most certainly was not robbed in the second one against Derrick Jones Jr."
"Go through the list yourself then, once you get to 20 it gets incredibly difficult. You got zach lavine over zion? I dont"
Zach and Vuc surrounded by a decent supporting cast should be enough to rip 2 straight. Lavine just hurt rn and Vuc is trying to adapt to a new team
it's tough to be 0.500 if you build team around zach lavine
"man if they had three almost-twins that came as part of the trade with these slightly fucked up versions of their own names, that'd be the best package. Jared Allen would probably be less athletic than Jarrett but Springer Dinwiddie might have Zach Lavine hops compared to Spencer. lmao I take that package over a bunch of question mark firsts and Olynyk and Bradley"
"In that case, wouldn't Luka be more valuable? Even Lavine prior to the trade will be more valuable. I don't think we win 5 games without Zach."
Zach Lavine
This is why Zach Lavine is better than Andrew Wiggins offensively
"&gt; I look, and he actually has goosebumps. I’m a big KG guy and I’m like “Yeah, I’m with you man. This is how we gotta play.” He’s like “right, Zach. You feel me Wiggs?”  &gt; Andrew Wiggins says “I don’t know even know what ‘Gladiator’ is, I’ve never heard of this movie.” The look on his face was like perplexed. Not anger, but just like get out of my face. So he just looks at us and says, “Y’all go get ready for the game, man.”   the virgin tryhard zach lavine vs the chad two way wiggs"
"Damn, Zach Lavine was about to gain some respect from KG and with one line Wiggins fucked it up."
As a dire hard wolves fan. This explains a lot about Andrew Wiggins and even more Zach Lavine..... i miss Zach :(

I don't think Zach Lavine has ever even been on a 35 win team in his 7 years.
"The Timberwolves are seriously spooky. KAT, Andrew Wiggins, Ricky Rubio, Zach LaVine. They're going to be crazy good in a few years"
On some level it's actually hilarious that Zach LaVine eventually became the kind of player that could seek a max contract
You're really gonna compare Zach LaVine to the 🐐?? Gtfo
"I have to say I thought Hanlen was just another all flash no substance trainer, but the dude's clients are Barrett, Zach Lavine, Tatum, Beal, Embiid, and Jordan Clarkson. They're all absolute beasts this year who have improved their games a lot in the last couple of years so he must be doing something right."
Top of that list would be Zach Lavine however I could see it being Sabonis as well. His lady likes warmer weather and frankly I'm a little jaded after Paul George and Victor Oladipo
More like Zach Lavine may not seek a max *with* Chicago lol
Zach Lavine
"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine  As well as front court players like:  -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  This was from a week ago so even if he's eclipsed some of these players since then, the point still stands."
"&gt;Dame   &gt;Luka  &gt;Steph   These 3 will be 1st and 2nd team.   &gt;Jimmy  Will likely go in as a forward  &gt;Russ  I really hope he's not considered. If he had done what he's done in the last 10 games all season then he'd be a lock, but I think people are forgetting how much worse he was in the first 2/3 of the season  &gt;CP3  He has him over CP3 but it's close  &gt;Simmons   &gt;Zach   &gt;Beal  &gt;Booker  Has him over all 4 of these. Beal and Booker we're strong contenders. I'm also surprised you didn't mention Mitchell or SGA since you've got Lavine   He actually has two names on that you didn't mention in Irving and Harden. His criteria doesn't feature games played very strongly apart from meeting a threshold (like half the season), and these two have been excellent"
"did I say scoring isn't important? I said it's dumb to use as an argument in a vacuum that one player is better than another. is Dame better than Giannis because he scores more PPG? Is Zach Lavine better than Kawhi? it's asinine. Scoring is just one part of each players multi-faceted skill set. if ""he score more points"" is the crux of your argument for why he deserves all-nba then your argument probably sucks ass."

I feel that Zach Lavine vs Aaron Gordon dunk contest will still be seen a few decades later. It won't be as famous as either the Vince Carter or Dwight Howard one but still will be in top 3 best dunk contests.
Paul George Kawhi Leonard John Wall Dwight Howard Al Horford Kyrie Irving / Uncle Drew  Zach Lavine Donovan Mitchell Ben Simmons  Kemba Walker
Zach Lavine
"Going by this year’s All-Star game:   - Zach LaVine - Nikola Vucevic - Domantas Sabonis - Mike Conley Jr.  My hottest take is that **Paul George** is going to be forgotten in the future, at least how good he was."
In terms of defense Ant = Zach Lavine
Zach Lavine. Makes everything look so effortless.
"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine  As well as front court players like:  -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  This was from 9 days ago, so maybe he's eclipsed some of these players since then but my point still stands."
"Curry could be a free agent next summer.   Chris Paul, Zach Lavine, and Bradley Beal are also guys coming up for free agency in the near future too I believe.   Russ, Nets Big 3, and Jimmy Butler will be up in 2023"
My fav is Zach Lavine but I play like cp3 but next year my big is changing teams so imma have to score more and post up

Zach LaVine missed 11 games during that span..
your title made it seem like zach lavine posted that picture in response to that redditor and i was like damn he really cared that much about it
This is your reminder that Zach LaVine could do this every possession and simply chooses not to out of the kindness of his heart.
"Yeah I guess so, but there are plenty of guys who score efficiently but they don't have much help so they are the only one who can score well, it doesn't mean the stats are empty, cuz someone needs to score points. Guys like Kelly olynyk, jerami grant, Collin sexton, Shai gilgeous Alexander, Zach Lavine, KAT. They all score efficiently and in bunches but their teams are below average or bottom feeders, but they aren't empty scorers. I think jerami is for sure not more than a 3rd option on a championship team but he is with us and helps keep the team from getting blown out every night"
"Im a raptors fan but I love watching Zach Lavine, he has the ability to just pop off at any random time"
"Zach Lavine just gets buckets, shame about the Bulls being kinda ass in spite of his efforts"
"Whole lotta guys that blow our minds today, there won't be room in the history books for them. Anyone really gonna talk about Jimmy Butler? He's so godlike that the nba-viewing world collectively apologized last year for not treating him like a god. It'd take a quality documentary or else I predict that whole episode gets forgotten. On the other hand, he can and should do great things post-career. I trust him more than any other NBA player to have himself a strong second half.  I'm having a hard time envisioning a future where people spend any time talking about Zach LaVine, Bradley Beal, or KAT. But they have time left to change that. Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell are currently getting themselves off that list, so it's a thing that can be done."
"His size is worrisome. He looks tiny out there, very slight of frame and looks shorter than his listed 6'5.  His closest comparable is Zach Lavine and Zach is amazing but I just don't like that archetype of player. A playmaking wing with size like Cade is far easier to build around."
"Nah, klay got 14... In three quarters LOL Steph is tied with Zach lavine for second most 3s at 13.  Hes also tied with Kobe and someone else I don't remember at 3rd with 12 threes, and then has tied with himself like a bajillion times at 4th place with 11 threes cuz he's Stephen fucking curry."
"Off the top of my head I’d say Zach Lavine. They’re very similar as in they’re both shot creators, both can score from all three levels. Green definitely needs to work on his 3pt shot &amp; playmaking but those can be worked on"
"Yeah, the person who watches every Timberwolves game is talking out of his ass with an unbiased opinion of Ant's bounce.  His vertical is very good. But ""elite"" is traditionally reserved for the top 5-10 dudes in the league. I don't think he's THAT good of a vertical leaper (it's hard to be when you're 230 at 6'4"").  When I think ""elite"" I think Derrick Jones Jr, Zach Lavine, Dennis Smith Jr., etc."
I should have clarified I’d prefer Zach lavine on the bulls and even the sixers. I’m just saying there’s at least an argument.
"I'd wait until the summer to truly judge his trade value.  I know as a Bulls fan, if Zach Lavine doesn't sign an extension this summer and says he wants to be traded to a contender, I would be more than happy to get Wiseman in a package for him. It's hard to judge trade value when no big name players are asking out."
Honestly the only one with any argument is Zach Lavine. The argument revolves entirely around the fact the bulls aren’t winning.

"Thibs is a great coach, he stepped on his dick with the VP/GM title and bringing in a bunch of washed bulls. The dude traded Zach Lavine instead of Andrew Wiggins. If you want to shit on the team, cool, but at least know what you’re talking about first."
"Yeah, like I don't understand Wolves fans, they are saying that they'd rather take Lavine over Jimmy. Jimmy took them to thier only playoff appearance in recent history, so they'd rather be out of playoff with Zach than be in playoffs with Jimmy. Like, if your out of playoffs your season is over, but if you in playoffs, then anything can happen, like last year Nuggets, who could have thought that they would take Cliooers to 7 games and then WIN the series. All I'm saying is, Jimmy hate is unwarranted, he exposed the Wolves franchise and now they all salty as fuck"
Idk why your here saying this when yall 1-1 vs us and we literally gave you your franchise guy. All love for zach lavine tho thats the boy
Id gladly trade in that one measly playoff appearance for Zach lavine back lmao
Drummond is like Zach Lavine in that it doesn't make sense for such a good athlete to be such a shit defender
ZACH MOTHERFUCKING LAVINE
To show Zach Lavine you're serious about building a winning team around him so he doesn't leave in FA? 100% yes.  If the Bulls don't make the playoffs and they don't have Vuce no way he's staying.
"Then they get more upvotes than the person who was making a sound argument.  ""\*insert player\* has to be better at shooting"" \[CHI\] Zach Lavine - 5 upvotes  ""lol make the playoffs"" - 70 upvotes"
Hornets Killer Zach Lavine
"I think Zach Lowe has touched on this multiple times on podcasts, including recently with David Thorpe and Howard Beck, but I do think it's interesting to define what really is the *most improved.*   G-league/bench player to NBA starter? Ex: someone like Donovan Graham last year  Negative player to All-Star? Ex: maybe Trae Young rookie to sophomore year, or Julius Randle/Zach LaVine this year  All-Star to best player on a championship team? Jokic this year"
"A lot of studs in this league were drafted in that 10-15 range, Giannis, kawhi, booker, Mitchell, SGA, Zach Lavine,etc, I’m not bothered by drafting late lottery because the Spurs have been drafting very well lately and I’m sure they’ll find their guy sooner rather than later"

"I literally almost specifically excluded Zach Lavine because I think he’s clearly on the outside of the great young guards lmao.  Guys like Lamelo, Luka, Morant, Murray and Trae Young are reading and playing the game at an insanely high level that we’ve never really seen before. At least, not this much talent clustered in one generation of players. They’re still young and don’t necessarily know how to win yet, so they shouldn’t be on any all-time list yet of course. But in their primes they’ll just be way more advanced than anyone who’s prime occurred pre-2012 or so.  I’m not arguing we should reconfigure out GOAT lists or whatever, because how good guys were *in their era* is important. And I would assume that if AI was a rookie in 2018 and played out his career over the next 10+ years he’d end up a way more skilled player than he was in the early 2000s.  I’m just generally of the belief that if aliens challenged humans to a “Fate Of The World” basketball game and offered us a time machine to select any player from any year we wanted, something like 95% of the team should be current guys. Given his passing, shooting and athleticism, peak Paul George is probably a good deal better than like peak Scottie pippen or Clyde or whatever. That doesn’t mean we should rank him higher all time, just that if the world depended on it I’d pick him over almost anyone from the 90s. And I think PG is at best like the 9th best player of the past 5ish years."
"Sure, but I'm never gonna argue that Zach Lavine is better then AI. Harden, Curry, and Kyrie are not era players. They are all time players that can be great whenever they play."
"Love this post.   I think Zach lavine and Brandon Ingram are other great examples this year.   Hyper efficient scorers who don’t seem to elevate their teams as much as you’d think (obviously neither are close to KD in impact incase anyone thinks that’s the point I’m making).  I think it stems from an inability to truly warp defences how guys like curry, harden, lebron and jokic etc do.   It’s why I’m so high on Zion, because he’s shown that immense defence warping offensive ability, and has shown a knack for being able to find the open man and find lapses in the defence with the occasional slick pass."
"I think its just an experience thing too, knowing how to show the ball or open yourself up to the contact so its an obvious foul. Some players who are acrobatic/finesse finishers (like Kyrie Irving or Zach Lavine) have trouble accepting physical contact but Ant is a power finisher who's gonna draw a lot of calls in his prime.  Bradley Beal went through the same issues but now he's like a FT magnet."
"I agree with everything you said (especially the part about not even Luka's biggest advocates thinking he would be this good) but its still unforgivable in my opinion for the following reasons  1- If it was about not taking away ball handling duties from Fox...then why did they extend an offer sheet to Zach Lavine? Did they think Lavine was going to be a spot up shooter?  2- They were not the team to get creative with their pick. The spurs, the heat, Danny Ainge etc can afford to make a big balls move and break from consensus. If you have just missed the playoffs for 85 consecutive seasons and your FO is known as a clown show...why would you be the ones to go against what 99% of people are telling you to do?  3- Did they really have to telegraph their interest in Bagley so bad that a montj before the draft everyone knew what they were going to do? Couldnt they have moved down in the draft and still got Bagley and other assets??"
I’ve had sex with a 10 every time Zach Lavine went to the playoffs.
"He's one  person. There are 3 other people who we don't know if they were vaccinated or not. Again, saying it isn't a sure fire block is great so there are fewer people like Zach Lavine who go out and get it far before their incubation period, even after that period as well. It's still better to mask up even after you're all incubated up as you can still get it, however unlikely that may be."
When I got the notification it cut off at ret... So I thought it said Zach LaVine plans on retiring
"&gt; Thibedeoux hiring was panned last off-season.  Thibs' ""failures"" in Minnesota were mostly at the feet of the owner; however, Thibs' front office moves weren't great either (paying Dieng that level of bank and then signing Taj, for starters).  For had Wiggins been dealt for Butler instead of Zach Lavine, the whole Wolves' timeline is markedly different and Thibs probably would have been here a bit longer. That is 100% Glen Taylor's fault and thank god the old man is finally selling this damn team.  Thibs is a very good coach. Just not a good FO executive."
"I think the most underrated player depends on how you get your sports news and updates.   Zion seems to be flying under the radar this year despite being a Top 10 scorer, similarly to Zach Lavine and Kyrie Irving.  I also don't hear much about Mitchell, Fox, or Sexton.   Marcus Morris, Bryn Forbes, and Michael Porter Jr. have all been lights out from three this year."
Not in a order: Steph curry Bradley beal Nikola jokic Joel embiid Damian lillard Luka doncic Zach lavine Giannis antetokounmpo Zion williamson Trae young Jayson tatum Kyrie erving Idk
Suite life of Zach (Lavine) and Coby (White)  Anthony Davis is a Chicago Native  I think he is coming to Toronto
"Those guys are all far better playmakers tho, and each as capable of dropping 50 in a playoff game as Zach. And I fucking love Zach. But those guys have legit pnr manipulation skills while Zach basically plays offense at 2 speeds. And it works, because he’s Uber athletic and can shoot the lights out. But the same can be said about these guys, too. I’d take Murray over Lavine as well."
"I believe in that too. I've been a fan ever since the Kevin Love days. KLove is a wolves legend, we just couldn't win. If we made the playoffs or had that suprise season like we did in 2004 with Love, i think he couldve won MVP. But he didn't. The thing is this franchise has failed to build around KAT. Adding DLo and Ant help. Same thing happens with many other stars like Zach Lavine."
**Zach LaVine**  He’s definitely gone after his contract is up. He can become a superstar in the future with his potential   Lonzo Ball this year even though he’s not a star
"with all the respect, but Bulls are really shit for some years, and I don't see them improving in the next years. the main difference is that in Chicago Zach is the main star, but he won't be in New York.   he would add so much value to this young roster, really solid shooting skills, so it would be nice if he lands in New York.   i know that Lavine is a fan of D Rose, so this pair should work fine for Knicks :D"
&gt;LaVine isn’t an allstar.   https://www.nba.com/bulls/features/zach-lavine-gets-well-deserved-all-star-nod
"No you’re good, but I think that no matter what team you should at least get hype over easily one of the hypest things in basketball, imagine if the hornets commentator went “And Zach Lavine for his nth three point shot....and he makes it, that’s 49 points for Lavine” with the same enthusiasm as this game winner"
What do the lakers have to trade that amounts to Zach Lavine
"I didn’t say unnecessarily. Reading is hard.   You don’t treat those guys as being *untouchable* which is how the Mavs FO acts. If there’s a Zach Lavine, Aaron Gordon, etc. type out there then you can’t be afraid to give up solid players to make your team better. Dallas’ FO over the years has chosen to stand pat when they’ve had opportunities to improve their team, primarily because they, like you, overvalue their current players."
The Lavine one is insane.  The bulls scored like 15 points In 45 seconds and Zach makes a crazy shot for his 13th three  “oh NO YOURE KIDDING!” Is iconic
Zach is the best LaVine. Adam is the best Levine. Avril is the best Lavigne.
Well obviously I’d say Zach is the most athletic Lavine
Also the Saric pick was a total tank move because they knew he wasn't gonna come over that year. They could've had freaking Zach Lavine lol
He'd be third after Michael Jordan and Zach lavine
"Oh absolutely.  Theoretically speaking, if Zach Lavine doesn't work out for another 2 years (ala Derozan scenario), a trade for Giannis opens up.  Knowing full well Giannis doesn't intend to stay (but with aspirations to compete and coax the guy anyway), Chicago trades Lavine for Giannis anyway.    Giannis plays his ass off, goes and wins a championship, and then leaves.  Knowing his intentions from the beginning, would you still be salty?  (And you're free to feel any way you feel.  For me the good would outweight the bad, and the man was transparent from the start.)"
"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine   As well as front court players like:   -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  But hey, keep shouting nonsense into the wind. We need more jokes around here."
"Unless they get someone like Kawhi or Zach Lavine or something crazy, they should do it. Mavs already have the superstar player, they need complimentary pieces, not more stars. To me Conley, CP3 or Lowry would be perfect."
"zach lavine is the much better shooter, which is nice and gives RJ and randle more room to work inside, which is nice. i don’t think it’s quite ideal still, as they’d be a bit lacking in playmaking still, but i imagine RJ, randle, and lavine can at least do a serviceable job at it by committee"

No there wasn't any news that he wasn't gonna resign. I don't think the sixers have a good offer for lavine personally unless they include simmons which they wont.  Honestly u guys should just wait Zach out. If the bulls fuck up getting a point guard again we're gonna be horrible again so if he's smart Zach should just leave.  Theres probably not a better place for him to be stylistically than philly tbh. You guys would be set up for a dynasty if u had Zach.
"I’d like to see another Shai video  MPJ, Zach Lavine, and Brad Beal would be dope too"
what are you talking about. There a bunch of solid FA options. We dont need to address a star this year as long as we build upon our success and guys like RJ and Randle improve stars will come to us   **2021 Free Agency**  * Kyle Lowry  * Mike Conley * CP3 (PO) * Kawhi Leonard(PO)   **2022 Free Agency**  * Zach Lavine * James Harden (PO) * Jimmy Butler (PO) * Bradley Beal(PO)
Zach Lavine with great playmaking
" He still is 20 though 🤷🏻‍♂️. But tbh, i see him to develop as a zach lavine or another harden lite type player"
The odds are slim to non that he’s James Harden. I think a more realistic ceiling is a Zach lavine level player
Zach Lavine is an underrated choice for this
Zach Lavine needs to be on the MVP conversartion
"He's been fighting ""empty stats"" labels since year 2. Other players praise him, but a lot of fans viewed him how a lot of people currently view Zach Lavine or Bradley Beal: guys who supposedly get numbers but don't contribute to winning basketball. And while it's true Booker's time on our team has been a very rough patch, it's clearer now than ever that it was mostly about the team around him and the front office and the culture. Get a good team around him and Booker is still lighting it up, but now with added bonus of winning games."
"LaVine/Simmons needs to happen at some point, whether on the bulls or otherwise. Their games are just perfect complements of each other. Zach brings elite shooting and scoring but lacks in playmaking and defense, while Simmons has the exact opposite skillset"
If you don’t think that Trae was better than Zach Lavine then that’s your loss for being blind. That’s rly the only complaint I had with your comment.
Agreeing with you here. Vince combined the technical ability of Zach Lavine with the ferociousness of Westbrook. His in-game dunks are otherworldly (ex. he literally jumped over a 7 footer in-game in the Olympics).
"I got Zach LaVine as best dunker purely off of aesthetic, and in game dunker I got my boy LeBron to be honest"
So was Zach Lavine (allegedly) when he got put into into quarantine protocol—dude missed  like 2-3 weeks
"Zach Lavine put up 27/5/5 on 51/42/85 shooting splits and he probably wouldn't even make the All-NBA 6th team, if there was one. The guard talent is insane"
"I feel like it’s more common for young guys to tear their ACL and end up fine (Zach Lavine, Dejounte Murray, etc) but even then they’re garbage when they return and spend the greater part of a season getting back to where they once were, only then do they start improving again."
"I'm hoping that CP3 got a false positive test, but based on the fact that we haven't heard anything else, it seems like he has covid.   the real question is if he is vaccinated or not. people keep saying that the chance of getting covid after vaccination is very low (which it is), but it still happens. I know someone who got it about a month after being fully vaxxed. It would really be disappointing if he isn't vaccinated. the dude is the players association president and one of the biggest role models in the league.   I'm hoping more information will come out soon, but it might not. as a bulls fan, this feels very similar to the Zach lavine covid situation a couple months ago. he went into covid protocol and we didn't even know if he had covid or was exposed to someone with covid until like 10 days later. turns out he did have covid and it took a couple weeks for him to get back to his regular stamina and strength.  really bad news, but I guess it's better than him getting a season ending injury or something"
Excuse me but Zach Lavine was born with what???
When Zach Lavine was still on the Wolves he tore his ACL with 7:30 left in the 3rd quarter and finished out the game. I'm not even sure if they caught it that night or if it took another day or two before Lavine realized how bad it was.
"Based on their listed positions, you have Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Zach Lavine, and Jrue Holiday contending for the two spots in a hypothetical 5th team. One of those players is going to be relegated to the 8th team All-NBA. The guard talent in the NBA is insane right now."
Zach LaVine tested positive in between his first and second shot and was out for like 2 weeks.
Couldn’t he be in between shots too? That happened to Zach Lavine where he caught it in between his vaccination shots
"Not trying to poke holes in your comment, but I think there could be a couple of reasons:  A) the testing section of the protocol was vague, it says no daily POC testing or off day testing (yes I realize the suns are on an off day, but I would think it is in the nbas best interest to test during playoff off-days) maybe their protocols are different in the playoffs, I haven’t seen anything about it tho  B) maybe Chris Paul is in between vaccines, that’s what happened to Zach lavine earlier this season. People assumed he skipped the vaccine.  C) CP3 is completely unvaccinated (but I would wait to hear from him personally before people badger he about not being vaccinated"
"Zach Lavine didnt make the playoffs i understand all that,but he had a better season numbers wise than most show zach some damn love"
"Terrible front office. Their core players used to be KAT, Zach Lavine, Andrew Wiggins and Ricky Rubio. Zach Lavine (post Achilles tear season) and Andrew Wiggins both improved tremendously almost instantly after leaving Minny and iirc Ricky did as well although can’t remember for sure. Says something about their coaching and roster construction if players all improve after leaving. There’s a reason SPOOKY wolves became a copypasta, the potential has always been there but wolves just can’t put it together."
or even the most hottest game in a first half this year on Zach Lavine vs the Hawks.
"Jayson Tatum over Paul George is the only thing I would DEFINITELY change. Otherwise I think its a great list. I think the toughest spot is the last two guard spots, Bradley Beal + Zach Lavine would've been my pick to be completely honest, but I think it definitely comes down Beal/Irving/Mitchell/Lavine/Booker and even James Harden despite his limited action was incredible."
"Wow aren't you so smarter than me   The point is if we had a 2nd creator, even if it was someone like Zach LaVine, we would be better off than we are now with Simmons and Tobi. Because then Joel wouldn't have to carry the whole load"
Tatum.   Booker and Zach Lavine are the destined ones to be pitted against each other until retirement
He’s not getting the MAX probably close like what Zach Lavine got off his rookie contract but 1yr of being a very good 3&amp;D guy doesn’t get you a max deal imo
"""Eye test is a thing""  I've watched Thybulle absolutely son the likes of Kemba Walker, Zach LaVine, Devin Booker, and DeAaron Fox"
Devin Booker had an off year statistically this year while Zach Lavine had a career year. Zach Lavine was better this year but we shall see if he will regress to mean or if this is the new Zach Lavine. Devin Booker has played better this playoffs than he has all season.
Zach Lavine having a super deep voice.
"This post is pretty dumb and he is not getting traded, but for the sake of arguing, let me see if I can take a stab at naming some players that may be similarly valued...don't bite my head off if you disagree.  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Bam Adebayo  Donovan Mitchell (maybe a little more valuable)  Christian Wood  Zach LaVine"
MPJ defense makes Zach Lavine defense look elite
"I think you’d get some baseline star players trying to go, the Bradley Beal or Zach LaVine type (great player on a bad to 8 seed type team)"
LMFAOO. “Masked Zach LaVine”😂😂😂
I don't know the Nets players on the court now 24 (I think?) and 4(?) look like failed clones of Jimmy Butler and Zach LaVine
https://bdasports.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Luka-Doncic-Zach-LaVine-1.jpg
Additional context...Vlade claimed they didnt draft Luka because they didnt want to take ball handling responsibility out of Deaaron's hands...then they made this offer sheet to Zach Lavine
Trade his ass and a few others for Zach Lavine
"Yeah, but is Joel Embiid more valuable on the Bulls than Zach Lavine plus X player (joe Harris, Dinwiddie, Aaron Gordon, Tim Hardaway) is on the Bulls"
Wherever Bradley Beal and Zach Lavine are ranked probably just put him right above them I guess  His prime is pretty weird cause he looked promising in Toronto early on then fell off then looked promising in new jersey and again fell off
"This is a really easy fallacy to fall into because core stats aren't as scalable as impact metrics, but ultimately even if Zach is paid like a high end 6 man/ 3 and D Starter instead of an all star, the major all-NBA players in the league typically have impacts that are even higher than their max contracts (hence why the max exists, so there isn't a speculation war over if Lebron is worth 50 million or 70 million etc and you dont have a star surrounded by 10 PJ Tuckers).  Zach is on a relatively cheap contract but you have to pair that cheapness with oppurtunity cost of not having a higher paid but bonafide star. So if Joel Embiid makes $30 million and Zach makes 18 Million, the question youre asking is with Zach plus whichever player you can buy for $12 million = Joel Embiid. So is Zach Lavine plus Jae Crowder or plus Spencer Dinwiddie or plus Joe Harris better than Joel Embiid (no, but the Zach + Joe Harris seems close). Ultimately, no matter how much else you can buy due to Zachs cheaper contract, it will never equal 1 Joel Embiid, or Jokic, or Giannis or Harden or Lebron because their impact is scalable.  Also the impact metrics are still out on Levine as a primary ball handler and as a defender. This year was a revelation just shooting wise and the contract he gets will make this one look cheap, but, simultaneously, the contract he gets will over pay him for his impact"
Nowhere in my post did I mention Zach Lavine or say he cooled down in any way shape or form
If there was a 95 year old r/nba user his favorite layer would be Bird and Doncic and claim Porzingis is better than KD and Jokic better than Lebron. At least he would he a half hearted Zach Lavine fan.
"if they don't, they wind up losing Zach LaVine in free agency as well as the 2023 lottery pick LOL"
"The 13th pick is always an interesting one, too. Karl Malone (1985), Jalen Rose (1994), Kobe (1996), Zach LaVine (2014), Devin Booker (2015), and Donovan Mitchell (2017).   Also some recent guys with decent careers so far, from Ed Davis (2010) to Markieff Morris (2011) to Kelly Olynyk (2013) to Tyler Herro (2019).  Fair share of duds though, with Papagiannis (2016), Kendall Marshall (2012), Jerome Robinson (2018), and most of the 2000s picks save Richard Jefferson and Thabo."
Zach Lavine ain’t good enough a teammate to make the 10th seed in the east?
"It's not just you, it's 100% true  Fans are idiots that think that only winning means you are good otherwise empty stats which makes no sense if a player is efficient, the hate Devin Booker, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Beal etc have gotten despite being amazing players recently just shows you   It's a 5v5 game at the end of the day not everyone is a LeBron that can carry a team like that"
Zach Lavine snubbed for mvp
Championship UNC team tho. A guy like Zach lavine came off the bench too at UCLA
Zach Lavine is a ghost he doesn't exist
AKA lets bring in Zach Lavine 😈😈
And Zach Lavine obv
"It's not that he just forgets. Teams in the playoffs extensively scout and know exactly what the Bucks like to run.   -  The Bucks need a creator at guard. The more I've watched, the more convinced I am that a Giannis team NEEDS a Chris Paul type to create on offense when stuff slows down. He'll, even a Zach Lavine type. Giannis is too limited to do it. Middleton tries, but that's not his strength, Holiday can't do it"
he has nothing to prove while Booker should still be consistent in order to surpass Zach Lavine in this league.
"*Zach LaVine, De'Aaron Fox, and KAT raise their hands*"
"Paul George and Zach Lavine playing together is interesting, but we really need a point guard"
Protect  -Patrick Williams  -Coby White  -Thaddeus Young  -Zach Lavine  -Nikola Vucevic   -Daniel Theis  -Troy Brown JR  - Tomas Satoransky
"There are quite a few Seattle area guys in the league.  George Karl helped create the high level AAU scene in the early 90s, and the area has been creating NBA guys regularly ever since.  Murray, Zach Lavine, Avery Bradley, Kevin Porter, Matisse Thybulle, Jaden McDaniels."
"Bulls taking over the league next year with our big 3: Zach lavine, nikola vucevic, and Troy brown Jr."
"Vince, Shannon Brown, Gerald Green, Zach Lavine, Aaron Gordon,"
"It doesn't, because you can just sign UFA's and make it appealing for them to come to you with a long term plan. So in 2022 you have Kawhi, Curry, CP3, Julius Randle, and Zach Lavine. CP3 is older, but probably a realistic option especially when you bundle him with a Randle or Kawhi. Kawhi isn't shy about changing teams.  Now I'm not saying Randle is a super star, nor Lavine, but it's a start to attract other and better players."
I feel like Zach LaVine deserves to be in here but I’m not sure who I would remove.
Don’t sleep on 2 time dunk champion Zach Lavine
"I agree, I thought about it and the NBA body I'd want the most would be Zach Lavine. 6'5 is a great height but not stupendously tall, and he has a good build - not too skinny, not too yoked. And his insane athleticism and talent would be great too.  Could have a nice NBA career, then not worry about big man health issues later on. And you don't always stand out in the crowd like a center does"
"Looking back at the 2014 Draft and 2014/2015 Rookie Class.  \#1 Draft Pick - Andrew Wiggins  Rookie of the Year - Andrew Wiggins  All Stars - Joel Embiid (2018-2021), Nikola Jokic (2019-2021), Zach LaVine (2021), Julius Randle (2021)  MVP - Nikola Jokic (2021)"
"* Zach Lavine $19m a year. * Lu Dort $1.4m a year. * Brogdon $20m a year. * Myles Turner $17m a year. * Sabonis $19m a year. * Capela $18m a year. * DRose $7m a year. * Nerlens Noel $5m a year. * Monte Morris $9m a year. * Royce O’Neal $8.5m a year. * Maxi Kleber $8m a year. * Dorian Finney-Smith $4m a year. * Serge Ibaka $9m a year.  Bogdan is a better player than some of these guys, but that doesn’t mean his contract is a better value."
Zach Lavine is making 19M/year
"Kat was born in NJ, he’s eligible to play for the USA. Also all those other players I listed I think are better center options than Drummond. I see you put demar in there which I’d probably put Zion there. Also you could put ja into one of those lineups I assume or Mitchell or Zach lavine"
Trae young  Donovan mitchell Devin Booker  Joel embiid  Nikola jokic  Stephen curry  Klay Thompson Zion Williamson  Pascal Siakim Lebron james  Karl Anthony towns  Julius randle  Bradley Beal  Jaylen brown Tatum  Kyrie Irving Kevin Durant  Bam Adebayo James harden Jimmy butler De’aron Fox  Cp3  Jrue Holiday  Jamal Murray  Dame  Luka  AD Giannis  Kawhi  Ja morant  Brandon Ingram  Russell Westbrook  Ben Simmons  Zach Lavine  Jaylen Brown
This is a wildly hot take. Giannis is a legit #1 option and a top-five player at worst. But he needs a guy who can really open up the offense by creating his own shot. That’s not Middleton. He needs someone like Zach LaVine or anyone with a similar playstyle.  Milwaukee’s roster construction is way too focused on off-ball.
"As a Bulls fan I gotta say that Lavine would probably be a 30 ppg scorer if he had spacing (which has been a problem with our inconsistency and roster changes every week or so) and capable playmaking. Zach is limited in defense and isn't the best playmaker but he's elite at scoring from anywhere. It's amazing he even puts up his numbers with the quality of the shots he takes. Gladly our FO is making moves to help take the load off him. Vucevic and Theis have been great giving us capable interior scorers instead of whatever WCJ and Markkanen are (I love them but come on guys stop regressing), Troy Brown Jr. being the defensive spark plug swiss army knife that every team would love and Javonte Green being... well actually decent for us."
Also relatively meaningless in actuality. Zach Lavine winning a ring in Chicago on 3 years would be just as impressive as Kawhi winning a ring as a Clipper.
"I think Zach Lavine, Indiana PG and Kawhi have similar in game dunk packages to Jordan"
&gt; Ben Gordon  The Bulls have cornered the market in unsuccessful franchise players since the MJ era:  Elton Brand  Tyson Chandler  Eddy Curry  Derrick Rose (no fault of his own)  Jimmy Butler  Zach LaVine
"Zach Lavine, Patrick Williams, Lauri Markkanen, Coby White, Lebron James  Lebron instead of Vucevic cuz Vuc has proven he can be a championship number 1, Lebron can’t anymore needs AD"
says the fan of the team whose entire fanbase begged for zach lavine... LOL
Middleton is nowhere near those players in terms of value.  Middleton is a hell of a lot closer to get a CJ McCollum than a Zach LaVine (though Middleton is ultimately better than CJ).
"So many of these contending teams could be put over the top if they could get Zach LaVine. With him being a free agent in 2022, it'll be interesting to see if any of them target him. Put him on the Bucks or 76ers and they are equal to the Nets."
"as a fellow bulls fan who watched most of our games I would have to agree. there were a few games and many moments throughout games where this bulls team looked really, really good. like borderline contender good. however, they are still way too inconsistent. some games only Zach shows up to play. also the most hot and cold shooting team I have ever watched. they gotta smooth out their game.  to me, next season will be won or lost on the shoulders of Coby white and Patrick Williams. we know lavine and vooch are gonna ball, but we really need Coby and pat to step up and contribute on both ends of the floor. obviously getting a PG will really help, but we need more from some of our current players too."
It's crazy. If Zach Lavine was on the Knicks he'd be talked about like a Top 5 guard in the league - and Chicago isn't even a small market.
What about Zach Lavine?
"nah bro, you haven't been watching. Lavine is a high efficiency scorer, not a high volume scorer. this is the thing that so many people don't understand about Lavine. he doesnt take as many shots as you would assume with his points per game. The only reason Zach was less productive at times after the trade was because he was injured and also had to recover from covid.   vooch was very consistent after the trade and didn't take shots from lavine at all.  so why weren't they successful? because the bulls have really bad team defense and they have no true playmaker to tie the pieces together. if they work on fundamental defense and get a PG in free agency then this team could be really nice."
"Hey totally random question, is Zach Lavine coming off a rookie contract and will be a restricted free agent or will he be non-restricted?"
"imo, they should really go with some of the young up-and-coming stars like Ja, Zion, Tatum, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Bam, Devin Booker, Zach Lavine, and other young guys.   Of course, if it's Dame Time and he wants to play, he should play too, but I have a feeling some of the young guys who have never been to the Olympics before would be more likely to go and play hard.   But goddamn, imagine watching Zion and Bam dunking lobs from Trae and Ja... good stuff"
Zach Lavine
idgaf zach lavine is every bit as good as devin booker and nothing will change my mind about that.
Why are people in this thread acting like Jerami Grant is Zach Lavine or something lmao. As soon as grant lands on a decent team again where he’s the third option or whatever his numbers will instantly go back to what they were in Denver.
"Tyler Herro is an elite scoring talent, it's like saying Devin Booker or Zach Lavine can't be your #1 scorer on a championship level team."
Maybe 4 Years ago someone like PG  But now really theres no better choice than Zach lavine.
"Zach LaVine, get a defensive Center like Myles Turner, resign THJ"
1. Trade Porzingis 2. Resign THJ and Brunson 3. Somehow get Zach Lavine or  Bradley Beal 4. Sign Norman Powell or Evan Fournier 5. Sign more veteran centers
And he did that’s why it went to 7....?   I’m not a Luka fan boy. My favorite player in the league is Giannis. I’ll actually just post my 10 favorite players to watch:   1. Giannis   2. Zach LaVine   3. Zion   4. Ja   5. LBJ  6. Russell Westbrook   7. Jokic   8. Dame  9. Luka   10. Kyrie
Now we just need to see Zach Lavine
If that’s the case someone needs to get him in touch with Zach LaVine.
"Zach Lavine- ""I took that personally"""
"you can mention like 20 players in the league and then you go ""hang the fuck on, Zach LaVine and Jayson Tatum can drop 50 on any given night and they're not in there?"""
Bradley Beal  Devin Booker  Donovan Mitchell  Zach LaVine  Jaylen Brown (count him as a SF though)
"You gotta look at how star players view guys. KD has shown so much respect to book and Tatum. And not just recently but for years.   When KD and LeBron were drafting players for the all star game Ben Simmons went 14th overall (4th off the bench) to LeBron’s team. And KD said “damn I wanted Ben”. Yes it’s just an all star game, but I know this sub would probably tell you Ben Simmons isn’t a top 25 player. But clearly to star players, and the coaches who vote in the bench all star players, view him in higher regard  In that same all star draft I remember KD saying I’m excited about this next pick, Zach Lavine. People call him a good stats bad team guy. Absurd. This dude is an absolute monster and totally gets disrespected because his team hasn’t had success. Players definitely don’t view him that way. They see a true baller  I respect their opinions more tbh"
"From what I've heard recently (from Ian Begley), we seem to be targetting Kendrick Nunn then its Lonzo and Devontae Graham.   All year I've heard that Knicks were super interested in Myles Turner. I'd imagine we'd be swapping the younger and cheaper Mitchell Robinson+something else for Turner.  Lastly, Knicks seem to be just waiting for that 1 disgruntled star (like Harden this season).  Maybe Wizards decide to trade Beal and Westbrook next season b4 they lose them in free agency. Maybe Zach Lavine becomes disgruntled (doubt it). Heck, maybe Clippers move to Seattle and Kawhi asks out this offseason lol.  Honestly, i have only recently started thinking about the Knicks offseason so I'll probably change my mind a lot until August 3rd."
How does Vuc only count before the trade when he was traded to the team Zach Lavine is on
"For sure allonzo trier, Zach Lavine, dejounte Murray, MPJ, Matisse thybull, IT, etc etc  Anyone who spent time around  around Seattle is welcome. Even klay going to WSU haha"
Get Zach Lavine?
"they need to give up about 3 first round picks and half the roster, then try and get Zach Lavine"
"I love watching Zach Lavine. He is so shifty, like a cat. He looks like he's about to pounce to new location on the court every second and he has a clean shooting form."
"They should go for Zach LaVine or just a solid 4/5. McCollum is not good enough to be a 2nd option on a true contender, it would be like Portland 2.0  I think Sabonis would also work decently well but they need some good defenders to cover those 2."
"WOJ: ""Zach Lavine HAS AGREED to a deal with the Los Angeles Lakers"""
Lmao mans said Zach LaVine and Jaylen Brown
Zach Lavine.
"players are right, he's one of the best SGs in the league  you have harden above him and then who else?   bradley beal I guess, maybe zach lavine"
"I agree, I think Beal is the best of the bunch.  Lavine, Mitch, Book and Brown are all very close and similar in a way. I think SGA is last and that's no knock on him, he's super young and definitely going to be a beast. Lavine and Book is interchangeable for me. Both similar on defense with Zach being the better finisher around the rim and 3pt shooter. While book is better at mid range. My list would probably go Beal, Mitchell, Lavine = Book, Brown, SGA. Watch out for my boy Jaylen, he's coming for that 2nd best SG title next year."
"You’re definitely mistaking me for someone who gives a fuck lol. But dude that’s cool man, I hope you continue with your weird obsession with Zach lavine. I hope him and his finance know you’re going to bat for him and his integrity on an online message board and I hope your biography on him sells some copies"
I mean clearly you kind of care what he does with his personal life. You knew or at least looked up all this shit just to defend him. I don’t care how public his information is the amount of information you know or looked up regarding Zach lavine life is not normal lol
Bro wtf are you his best friend or something? The confidence like you know zach Lavine lmao
"Don't think it's about vaccinations - the protocol after a positive test is the same regardless - you can't leave isolation until 10 days after the positive test. It's what you can do otherwise that differs depending on vaccination.  Lavine was probably deemed a close contact of someone and isn't positive so far. I could be wrong though, but that's the only way it makes sense to me, especially since the matches start soon (unless they delayed releasing this information and Zach was in isolation already)."
Why would he be in the protocols for 2 weeks if he didn’t have it? Either I’m missing something or that doesn’t make sense.  Edit: Lavine had covid. He was just asymptomatic.   https://hoopshype.com/rumor/zach-lavine-was-covid-19-positive-felt-fine/
"When Beal got it he fully dropped off the team. But USA ""hopes Lavine will join later this week."" So Lavine must be asymptomatic.  Anyone know if Zach is vaxxed ?"
"""And fuck Zach LaVine specifically""  -SARS-CoV-2"
"Don't know if this counts, but I started to get into the NBA around 2003-2004. Zach LaVine reminds me a little of Tracy McGrady. Zach is a high-flying player, can create his own shot, can shoot over anyone. TMac was a similar player, but his game was a little less rigid than Zach. Talent wise Tmac was a lot better though, and often got compared to Kobe skill-wise."
"Tier 3 with KAT, Ben Simmons, Jrue Holliday, Zach Lavine, Pascal Siakam, etc.  The all star bench level"
Zach Lavine will go down as the best SG in Chicago Bulls history
Get up or get out the way Zach LaVine 👏🏼
"when Zach Lavine is on, he's unstoppable. I feel like he always scores 40-50 against us"
Most comparisons I’ve seen for Green have him as Zach Lavine   For Mobley Chris Bosh and Anthony Davis are the two names thrown around the most
"I am optimistic since the decision makers for the Bulls are entirely new.  I expect Zach Lavine, Nikola Vucevic, Pat Williams and *maybe* Coby White to still be on the team next season, but outside of those four, it could easily be a brand new squad."
"Hmm I did some research on this before and I don’t think the numbers are accurate. The bulls have less space than I used to think bc half of Sato’s contract is guaranteed. And realistically, it’s unlikely Thad gets cut due to 1) his veteran leadership that Zach Lavine praises him for and 2) the fact that the only real big on the roster is Vuc."
"Kobe scored on below league average efficiency in every single series in 2002 except the Finals where the Lakers just collectively rolled over the Nets.  His playmaking was also overrated: 4.6 apg and 2.8 TO is not bad for a Playoff run especially in the early 00's, but also not anything to write home about. The Lakers played primarily through Shaq, using his inside gravity to create space outside the paint. They didn't use Kobe as a primary facilitator, he just attacked the space and shot, while occasionally passing. The rest did the same, that's why the most important Laker players at the time all had similar AST/TO numbers and low volume assist totals.  I'm looking at efficiency relative to the league average at that time... And Kobe shot worse than league average and worse than he did during the RS in the 2002 Playoffs...   Gasol/Odom/Ariza or MWP + whenever Bynum player was easily the best frontcourt in the league at the time, and one of the best frontcourts from 2000 to 2010... Fisher was worse than early 00s but it didn't matter, he still could do most of what he always did, shoot threes and defend. And it's not like the early 00s Lakers had some godlike guard depth either.  Gasol's postseason run from 2008-2010 was immaculate. Dude only had like 2 bad series and both came first half-year he was there against the Spurs and Celtics defense, two of the best teams in the league at the time outside LA. Even then, Gasol played better than Kobe in the 2008 Finals...   Young Melo was overrated. Couldn't do shit before and after Chauncey during that era... If he was one of the best players in the league at that time, he would be able to have more PS success with those Nuggets teams... He had AI/Chauncey, JR Smith, Camby, Nene, Kenyon Martin, Birdman, Afflalo, Ty Lawson, Kleiza at various points from 2007-2010... Melo was a great scorer but absolutely terrible defensively and weak playmaker as well... Isolation merchant. Man was equivalent to modern day Zach LaVine, but a worse playmaker and playing a more important position defensively...  Spurs were clearly in limbo after Duncan's prime. They needed some time to adjust and refresh the team. They were still a good team in 2008, but Chris Paul almost took them out by himself... 2005-2007 and 2012-2016 Spurs were the peak Spurs under Pop era... Kobe managed to get Pau during the right timeframe in between which allowed him to capitalize on Spurs down years.  Not really. I just think Pau from '08-'10 was more consist than Kobe during '00-'02...   If i had to rank their level of impact during these runs it would be:  01 Kobe 10 Pau 09 Pau  02 Kobe/08 Pau 00 Kobe  Like i said. Pau was more consistent. You knew kind of what to expect from him. Kobe's impact was moreso rooted in his ability to get hot from the floor... In 2001 he found his zone and dominated, every other surrounding year he was a dice roll to an extent."
"Edwards is definitely thicker than Kobe was, but somewhere in-between him and Zach Lavine sounds right to me. maybe not QUITE Zach's hops but if you Gogeta them together I think they land on Kobe's athleticism."
"Relative to actual freak athletes in the league. He doesn't have elite athleticism. I'm not saying kobe isn't athletic. I just don't put him in a category with LeBron, Jordan, or Zach Lavine."
Zach LaVine and Mikal Bridges join Anthony Davis on the Lakers to form a superteam  At least one team gets relocated  Trae Young wins MVP  Kings don't make the playoffs and hit a 20 year streak  Klay Thompson retires  LaMelo becomes a top 3 PG   Embiid wins an MVP  The NBA expands by two teams  The Nets don't win a championship  *Champions:*  2021- Bucks  2022- Nuggets  2023- 76ers  2024- Lakers  2025- Lakers
Perfect. Kuzma for Zach Lavine confirmed!
I mean he’s gotten his team to the playoffs a couple times in his career with little to no help. More than you can say about a guy like Zach Lavine or KAT for example.
Zach Lavine. And I’m a Bulls fan.
"Have you seen Mobley play? Have you seen Turner play?   Turner is a spot up shooter that anchors a team’s defense at the rim. Mobley is a Garnett/Adebayo-type of do-it-all big that can easily be switched and a wing/transition scorer like Anthony Davis on offense. These are diametrically opposed skill sets and I really don’t know what similarities you’re seeing.   I’m not saying Mobley is a one man offense like Cade, but Green certainly isn’t that either, and neither is Zach LaVine. The Bulls were 21st on offense. Scoring matters, but combining that scoring with playmaking is what gives you guys like Harden and Doncic (and Cade) who can essentially make teams top offenses just with their presence.   And I’m really high on Green, but his “floor” being Zach LaVine has yet to be seen. You can say they’re similar enough stylistically but that doesn’t mean they’ll have the same levels of success. LaVine just put up 27/5/5 on 63% TS. Crowning Green as being capable of doing that as his “floor” seems really premature. Especially when you account for the fact that LaVine was a really late bloomer and had some of the most unusual skill development in a player ever.   Mobley’s scoring was slightly below Cade’s while being the best defensive player in college basketball. That projects really damn well if you’re in the business of building a contender.   I can’t definitively prove one thing or another, shit, maybe Vrenz Bleijenbergh ends up being the best player in the draft and we both look silly- but there are more reasonable indicators of future success with Mobley than there are with Green, and that’s exactly why almost every scout and draft expert who has looked at both guys has Mobley in the same tier as Cade, and Green third or fourth.  Ultimately that’s what I look for. Reasonable indicators of future success. Doesn’t definitively mean anything will happen, I missed on Fultz and DSJ, but I’ve also hit on Trae, Tatum, Doncic and Shai.   If a guy can score at a high level, and another guy does a variety of things at a high level, including scoring, I’ll probably take the second player. Using that as a general philosophy when it comes to these things will usually net you more hits than misses."
Like I said Zach lavine is the floor that is the worst case scenario. With Mobley the worst case scenario is Myles Turner. That is Mobley’s floor in my eyes. I don’t know where you get the idea he was this outstanding scorer that can lead an offense on his own that’s not the kind of player Evan. He’s not gonna be initiating offense at this level and to be fair kpj is certainly good enough to get him in the right spots. Also I know we were the worst defense in the league last year. We were also the worst offense. We need everything we can possibly get on that end as well. The Rockets have three dudes on the roster that have double digit scoring potential. Threee!!!! Listen I love Mobley and green and I think they’ll both be all stars for years to come but defense is a skill that can much easier be learned. I just have more faith in Greens ability to become a good perimeter defender than Mobley’s ability to become a reliable scorer as a primary option. Also Wood is nigh untouchable. Unless you’re giving us an all star caliber player or a pick better than any of our current ones I’m hanging up every time.
"You guys were literally ranked dead last in terms of defense. You need defense.   You couldn’t win twenty games. You need the best player available and at 2, that’s Mobley. He was arguably the best player in college ball last season and was an amazing scorer. To put it into context, let’s compare him to Cunningham. Cade put up 31 points per 100, Mobley wasn’t far behind with 28/per100 and was his team’s anchor defensively.   I know the potential of a Zach LaVine type player is tantalizing, but Green has serious holes in his game. I think in time he’ll work them out and be great, but I don’t really ever see him being the generational talent Mobley or Cade can be. And losing out on someone who can be Kevin Garnett because you wanted Zach LaVine is the exact type of move that’ll have you winning 43 games a year languishing in mediocrity.   And I’m not a fan of twin towers either, even if they’re both lights out shooters as that can be wonky on defense. That’s why I’d move Wood for picks or young players without hesitation if I was Houston."
Yeah but scoring is what we need most of all and Green provides us that in bunches. I’m not super high on Mobley’s scoring chops tbh he seems like one of those one and done guys that get lost after their initial move doesn’t work. Think he’ll wind up being Myles Turner on roids so I won’t necessarily be mad if we select him just kinda wondering what could’ve been. Cause for me Greens floor is Zach Lavine and I don’t even know what his ceiling is. Also just not a fan of twin towers unless one of your bigs is a 40% shooter from deep which neither wood nor Mobley will ever be. Mobley’s shot is slower than Kyle Anderson stg.
ehh Zach Lavine is arguably better than CJ and Vucevic is a solid center.... wait a second this reminds me EXACTLY of the trailblazers roster lmao
"yeah it is pretty risky to sell the farm for a 31 year old, even if he is one of the best players in the entire league  crazy idea would be to ship randle for dame since randle is on only one more year and approaching his next contract is going to be really tricky considering his regular season accolades but then totally shitting the bed in the playoffs.  he was on pace to be a max player and now.. well who knows how much he should be making on his next deal  zach lavine might be gettable in 2022 if the bulls dont show any improvement this year  can't assume we will get luka or zion or ja any time in the next 5 years, I wont say never but I wouldn't plan around it in the short term"
"the players left (as I read it are)  Jayson Tatum, Dame, Draymond Green, KD, Bam, and Zach LaVine"
"I don't wish injury on any player, and I don't want anyone to get beat up too badly . . .   But someone needs to *shake the shit out of Bradley Beal &amp; Zach LaVine* until they realize that they're way too fucking good for these ""happy with the 8th seed"" franchises."
"LeBron is a part of the team, but if your argument is that the TEAM is good, then the team shouldn't fall apart without him.  &gt; We were the fourth seed on Christmas Day when Lebron got injured and were consistently rising in the standings before everyone got injured  Chicago was the 6th seed on Feb 24th and had been steadily rising for 3 weeks. Zach LaVine then proceeded to miss 15 games down the stretch and the Bulls slipped to 11th and missed the playoffs altogether. Would you say that Chicago was a ""solid playoff team"" that just got unlucky with injuries? Of course not.   They were a bad team who couldn't make up for the loss of their best player, just like the 2018/19 Lakers were a bad team who couldn't make up for the loss of their best player."
"If y’all traded for Dame, y’all would probably be banking on some other star joining Dame and Randle later on. I could see a scenario where Zach Lavine joined y’all in free agency and forms a big 3."
Lmao you have a chance to represent your country. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity for many you never know. It's every 4 years that most pro players don't even get to participate in. A very select few get to go just to say they went that's an insane opportunity. To be a little child because you didn't get picked initially is such an immature thing to do. Put that in contrast to zach lavine who's obviously more of an all star than ja morant jumping in excitement that he got invited. That's the kind of attitude you want when you send a representative of your country.
Zach Lavine had a monster year and really doesn’t belong in the same discussion as Kevin Love.
Zach Lavine if the Bulls decide to rank and are high on THT
(For worse)  The idea that Trae Young or Ja Morant couldn't help this team more than Zach Lavine and Kevin Love is just insane to me.
o no what will Kevin Durant Damian Lillard Devin Booker Jayson Tatum and Zach Lavine do without offensive help
He's more Zach Lavine than anything.
He was essentially Zach LaVine 15 years early
"Yeah I think this thread is majorly overthinking it, a team with Dame+KD+Tatum+Bam can beat anyone in the NBA, Europe, whatever.  But if the ball is going to be in Dame's hands at the start of each possession you want players who are good at basketball *when their teammates are initiating the possession*.  Adding some other PG that's 90% as good as Dame adds diminishing returns on value, you want guys who can *receive* the ball, not necessarily distribute it.  Robinson has trained his entire career to figure out how to get open on offensive possessions, when Dame is driving to the basket you want someone who knows exactly where to go for the kickout, not someone who's just gonna chill on the wing and then bail out the possession with a contested jumper.  In theory Zach Lavine is one of the best off ball shooters of all time, if Pop can get him into actions where he feels comfortable being that guy then the team can go far.  Duncan gives you 90% of that skill plus the confidence to know he's comfortable in that role within the context of the team, so he's a good option too.  A great rim protector would surely help too but there aren't any available that I think bring significantly more value to the table than Robinson, especially when the team is probably fine going small for stretches"
"[Miami reportedly open to James Harden trade; Tyler Herro not untouchable](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/12/12/miami-reportedly-open-to-james-harden-trade-tyler-herro-not-untouchable/#:~:text=The%20Heat%20would%20have%20interest,in%20granting%20his%20trade%20request%E2%80%A6&amp;text=But%20the%20source%20disputed%20any,untouchable)  Had no draft picks to trade at the time so luckily we dodged the Frauden bullet. Bradley Beal Damian Lillard or Zach Lavine will be requesting a trade here any day now btw 😁"
"Kris Dunn's last Bulls season was a great example of this. One of the best defenders in the game, but I think was dead last in open 3pt % above a certain number of attempts.   So teams would just clog the paint to prevent Zach LaVine drives when Kris Dunn was on the floor."
I just dont really buy in situations like these that teams will find better ways to spend that $30+ mil. There are just very few teams who keeping as much cap space for 2022 FA is really a rational move. If you are trading for him you are a believer that he can still improve alot and maybe follow a Zach LaVine path as a higher end outcome as an ex. And even if he doesnt the way you want these types of players who put up high PPG tend to be tradeable D'Angelo Russell has been overvalued multiple times on the market now.  It really is just a question of the luxury tax for your owner. Which if your owner wont pay it you arent really that serious about wanting to win a title anyway and in that case you are probably not a huge market team and hence dont need to be saving cap space for FA.
"Steph Curry, Lebron, Zach Lavine just a few that come to mind"
ZACH LAVINE TOP OF MY WISHLIST
"Okay, here are some examples of what I mean all from USA vs Nigeria.  https://mobile.twitter.com/Tim_NBA/status/1414771791361462276?s=20  And here is Zach LaVine having to learn what a travel is.   https://mobile.twitter.com/BasketNews_com/status/1411293788740460549?s=20  This is the type of stuff that I'm talking about. Particularly the first link, I watched that full game and the way it was reffed was miles better than the way the NBA is reffed. The refs in this finals game alone messed up so many calls that it was unbelievable."
It's about time we got to see Zach Lavine in a playoff series. He can score in so many ways so it would be intriguing to see how he handles different defensive schemes in a series.
"Completely agree. It's also interesting because during the pandemic, Seattle was highlighted for semi-uniquely having the collectivist European mindset despite being in the United States. You could reasonably stretch that down to the Bay, I know SF did a really good job too, and if you look at the reputations of players from Seattle/Portland/the Bay, it tracks.  Klay grew up in Portland and played for Wazzu, unselfish and very mellow. Dame, Oakland, unselfish and very mellow. Zach Lavine, very unselfish and mellow, Matisse Thybulle, the Lopez twins spent a couple of years up here and then the rest in Fresno but close enough; basically every guy in the League from the Land of Hella is a notoriously well liked and unselfish teammate, with Spencer Hawes and Kevin Love basically being the only two exceptions, throughout 30+ guys. And Kevin Love, there's an argument that a lot of it was him having the classic PNW introversion, that may have made things more difficult for him.  If you want to get into MLB, Blake Snell also has this same reputation of being super mellow and a little weird, as does Timmy Lincecum. Really fascinating."
I hope the Lakers get Zach Lavine.
"Well, they might have Zach Lavine"
Zach Lavine
I would love to see Philly trade Simmons for Zach Lavine

zach lavine needs to hurry up and adopt a kid so he can get in on that next level recruitment strategy...
"Jrue is also older now, and not the same defender or offensive player. Idk who they could have got honestly. Zach Lavine would have made more sense and that would definitely be possible with the picks they had"

"Because they aren’t used to the rule. Hell, Zach lavine had to get a FIBA player to teach him how to rework his footwork to avoid getting called for travels all the time."
Zach LaVine has never had a relevant moment in the NBA. Jesus
no one's winning any rings with zach lavine as their #1
"Teams are betting on Jalen green’s ceiling. He’s literally a Zach Lavine prototype with better handles and better slashing abilities.  For a young team like Detroit, you really can’t go wrong with either guy imo."
It’s gonna be Zach Lavine
"Zach Lavine:  Lakers, Sixers, Mavs fans: is for me???"
Im surprised they’re surprised at the lack of calls given that video with Zach Lavine talking to an international player about what is and isn’t a travel. I would imagine they discussed fouling too?
What would the Bulls have that the 76ers want?  I can’t see the Bulls giving up Zach LaVine
"I do, super athletic scorer who can create off the dribble and shoot efficiently. Could easily be the next Zach Lavine/Devin Booker type player."
"We have a disease of more dilemma right now , the other countries are playing team basketball with defined roles and running smoothly as a unit while we iso it up and run PnR to oblivion. We’re so predictable because there’s too much ego for anyone to accept roles.For example there is no reason KD shouldn’t be averaging 30 a game because Zach Lavine wants to get some shots up"
"Zach Lavine is actually useless on this team. Not only is his skill set completely redundant and strictly dominated by a few other players (like a Bradley Beal), but he also plays no defense. They would have been better off taking literally any player over him. Heck someone like Lonzo Ball, even if he’s not the better player in a vaccum, would be a way better fit for this team."
"nah it's cool.  cj is the obvious one with a package being something like cj and covington for ben and seth.  another one i've seen which i don't think is realistic is zach lavine. maybe if his reps let it be known he doesn't intend to re-sign in CHI, but he would in Philly with Embiid, CHI decides to sneakily do it on a friday news dump after letting out a few rumors lavine doesn't intend to re-sign. simmons would work with vucevic but it'd be a tough sell for sure.  gordon hayward and rozier + pick. this one is ngl kind of intriguing although it forces hayward to play the 3 and i'm not sure he and tobias can fit together.  the other one would be d'lo + whatever from MN but personally i think d'lo is a losing player and want nothing to do with him on the sixers i think he'd make embiid demand a trade. i'd legit question my fandom if this type of trade happened and i trust morey not to do it.  tobias i think is more or less a market value contract to slightly overpaid, but at least with him you know you're getting the prime of his career for 3 more seasons."
y’all seen that video of Zach lavine training wit the euroleague player it’s basically a whole new game to them right now they learning how to play &amp; most of the team is use to getting star calls they aren’t getting
Smells like a Zach LaVine supermax extension
"Stephen Noh (former Bulls writer for The Athletic) put together a really good video on Zach Lavine's defense a couple months ago. The TLDR, is that Lavine is no longer a turnstile. He's about league average on defense https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUf_DFd6W8 is"
"Can't wait for lockdown defenders Brad Beal, Zach LaVine and Dame Lillard to turn it on in the olympics 😤💯"
Even lonzo is a better fit than Zach lavine. Maybe they can grab Jaxson Hayes if it's not too late
without watching the game id say zach lavine is not a good fit.
"I get your point that it's not really accurate to suggest it's NBA talent vs a whole bunch of not NBA talent, but Patty Mills, Joe Ingles, Aron Baynes, Dante Exum, Matthew Dellavedova, Matisse Thybull, and Josh Green vs Damien Lillard, Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal, Jarami Grant, Kevin Love, Draymond Green, Zach LaVine, and Jayson Tatum isn't exactly close in individual talent."
"&gt; Avril Lavigne &gt; Zach Lavine  This is true. Only time it was the other way around was between '14 and '17 LOL  Nowadays, it's Avril number 1 in my heart !"
He did not in fact have to choose 1. We got Zach Lavine and Bradley Beal bringing nothing but scoring. You think if Steph was down to go they're leaving Dame at home?
Channing Tatum &gt; Jayson Tatum   Avril Lavigne &gt; Zach Lavine   NBA Youngboy &gt; NBA
Defensive stopper Zach Lavine
"How is Klay at 70% one of the best defenders in the league lol. That would definitely not work out imo. 2 undersized/defensive-liability point guards as your backcourt...At least one of them is going to get picked apart on defense. Imagine Curry trying to defend Zach Lavine, Jaylen Brown, Devin Booker, etc lmao yeah right"
Zach Lavine
Am I super biased or did Pop run up to Zach LaVine after he passed up that buzzer beater shot to tell him to shoot that?
I don’t think we could. We’d need someone like Bradley Beal/Zach LaVine to come to the Lakers in 2022 free agency.
"My breakout list is...  Tyrese Maxey, Tyrese Haliburton, Johnathan Isaac.  &amp;#x200B;  My fall off list is...  Russell Westbrook, Zach Lavine, Nikola Vucevic."
"Zach Lavine missed a full year, DRose missed more than a full year, Jabari Parker missed 11 months the 1st time, pretty much a full year the 2nd time, KP missed a year and 8 months. It’s an 11+ month injury nearly every time.   Organisation’s aren’t gonna risk their player’s future to rush them back, especially the Nuggets who have invested $170M in Murray."

"Zach Lavine - A hard worker who has a chip on his shoulder, comes back better after every off-season, and is capable of balling out any given night. I think he'd be great for creating a culture."
"Coby White.   I think now he’ll be in a position that suits him much better. He shouldn’t be the main facilitator, he’s a great scorer, so talented offensively and shows flashes of being a good playmaker. He’s gotten some hate from our fanbase but he’s still only 21 and the talent is obviously there, he’s just not a PG. (Right now at least, especially not sharing the backcourt with Lavine).  When he gets back, I see him lighting some second units up next to Caruso. Some games he can get as hot as Zach. Depending on how quickly he gets back, he could be a dark horse for 6MOTY."
It’s crazy how Zach Lavine basically did that for a whole season
"I was hoping one of y'all would post this because what most of you view as an epic Zach LaVine highlight,  I see as an epic Eric Collins highlight 😎"
"Julius Randle played like a top 20 guy last year (All Star) which is how they catapulted to the 4 seed. Zach LaVine you can also argue is top 20 and surrounding him with better talent (Lonzo, DeRozan, a full year of Vucevic) you can make the case that he’ll be more efficient and have a better year.  I hear you, I’m just saying I won’t be surprised one way or the other."
"""Zach LaVine night""? Fournier specified the result was a win.   ^^^^sorry ^^^^Bulls ^^^^fans ^^^^I ^^^^had ^^^^to"
"Younger Westbrook, Rose, Wall  Zach lavine, Donovan Mitchell, maybe Fox   Malik monk, DSJ and any other recent guard dunk contest participants"
"Nah bro, his head was at the rim so I'm going with Zach Lavine"
So the Corey Brewer special or a Zach LaVine Night? Mmm give me the Zach LaVine night because that means I got hops now.
Isn't that basically zach lavine though lol
Zach LaVine leaving must be imminent then considering he's been in the league 3 years longer than Tatum and Tatum has more ECF than Zach has playoff appearances
"Honorable mention to Zach Lavine.  He didn’t drive an offensive engine like the guys mentioned here, but some games he pretty much had to score all our points."
Zach LaVine has tremendous potential to win most improved. For the first time in his NBA career he is playing full season with good vetaren players.  He made good improvement past season in scoring and defense. He is coming from a decent Olympic campaign as well.  I don't think we have seen his peak just yet.🚀🚀🚀🐂
"Current league, no Warriors:  PG: Jamal Murray  SG:  Zach Lavine  SF: MPJ/ Middleton PF: Giannis Antetokounpo C: Nikola Jokic   For all time: PG:  Steve Nash SG: Kobe Bryant/ Ray Allen SF: Scottie Pippen PF: Kevin Garnett C: Tim Duncan"

"Smart is the Celtics all time 3 point single game record. Only Kobe, Donvell Marshall, Steph Curry, Zach Lavine, and Klay Thompson have made more 3s in one game. The guy isn't a great shooter, but he is streaky. When he gets hot he will make 9/12 but when he is cold he will go 2/13..."
"Harden shoots 1% better than Luka's last season from 3 and no one is clamouring to call him a top 5 shooter in the league. He's just a good shooter and is extremely good at creating his own shot/separation so he can increase the volume without a dropoff in efficiency. Harden's 3pt% has barely changed season to season whether in OKC or Houston or Brooklyn whether he shoots 3 a game or 13. He's not a better shooter than Steph, KD, Dame, Kyrie, Middleton, Paul George for sure and there are others I would pick to be better that are just coming into their roles such as Zach Lavine who I think will have many seasons of shooting 40+ from 3 on high volume that aren't pure catch and shoot guys like Klay, MPJ or Joe Harris.   If Harden suddenly shot 40%+ from 3 in Brooklyn or had shot that in OKC on lower volume catch and shoot type shots you would have a point but he never has and most likely never will. He's an amazing player and excellent at creating his own shot from behind the line consistently, but he's a not a top shooter in the league. He's a way better passer/playmaker than he is a shooter and that's where a lot of his value on the court comes from."
"His beard looks like pubes, Give him a few years. Zach Lavine used to be the same but he got a nice beard now"
Idk zach lavine curry rj barret or embiid are my guesses though
"Gilbert Arenas is why I was skeptical of players like Devin Booker or Zach LaVine actually being franchise caliber players (until this last season) for most of their careers.  I watched Arenas drop 40 on guys quite a bit but it never translated in to success in the playoffs.   Guys like him are in *every* NBA generation, where they are a walking bucket but just do not get the wins despite their scoring prowess and I would argue this most recent generation's example of that is Melo, I'm curious who this upcoming generation's example will be."
"They did suck, but having watched those teams, they weren't just bad, they were maddeningly bad.  We had Byron Scott who had been regarded as a pretty good coach.  He coached the Nets to the Finals in the early 2000's, coached CP3 on the Hornets to some really good years, was on the Cavs when Lebron was in Miami, and then came back to LA to lead an aging Kobe and Pau with random pieces.  He was the Tank Commander for a reason, his schemes and rotations made little sense for a coach who wasn't some newbie like Luke Walton was.  For someone who had success, it is more likely he sucked on purpose rather than on accident given the disparity in effort, though of course there's no way to prove that.  However, we won 27 games during those years bottoming out at 17, we didn't just suck, we historically sucked.  Its hard to say that even with bad players, we couldn't have swung a trade or gotten a free agent to make us at least competitive.    And Kobe being on the team proves my point.  He was our one star for years, it would have been disrespectful to not try to at least let him end his career with some dignity instead of 17 win shit team.  We gave him $50m for essentially sitting out, just because people still cared about him.  It would have taken almost no effort to pair him up with some more vets and tried to do something (like Jim Buss tried to do with Deng and Mozgov), but instead that was the last gasp of a guy being forced out of his team.  We barely tried because we didn't want to.  And another thing that proves my point: the Lakers' salary during the tank years.  You can say Byron sucked and our players sucked, but you cannot say our Front Office kept trying to put together a winning product.  [In 2012-2013](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/los_angeles_lakers/2012-2013/), we had the highest salary in the league at $100m.  When we started tanking the next year, we dropped only to #4 in the league but shaved off $25m.  The next year we dropped to #9 in the league, and the following year in 2015-2016 we dropped to #19.  This is not the salary of a team who's trying.  The next 3 years we were #19, #21, and #27 in league salary.  Why didn't we sign more Mozgov's and Deng's if we wanted to win?  There are plenty of vets we could throw a big contract to if we really wanted to go for it every year.  We could have at least maintained a top #10 ranking in salary if we wanted to compete, the Lakers' name plus the money would have gotten free agents to join, right?    The salary, more than anything, should be proof we didn't try.  We could give anyone money, who would turn down a fat check from the Lakers?  At the time Carmelo was bouncing around the league and Kobe was gone, we could have said to him ""Hey, here's $25m, come start for the Lakers and be the face of the franchise for a few years"".  Other than Melo, there were plenty of guys past their prime or guys good enough to make a team competitive that we could have thrown money at during the lean years.  Guys like Horford, Whiteside, Dion Waiters, Pau, Harrison Barnes, Gordon Hayward, Millsap, JJ Redick, Gallinari, Taj Gibson, Olynyk, Rudy Gay, Aaron Gordon, Zach Lavine, Derrick Favors, DeAndre Jordan, etc.  I'm sure not all of them would have come, and some of them were never going to leave their team, but if the Lakers came calling with a blank check, I've no doubt we could have gotten a few of those guys as our starters.  Other people who derisively talk about the Lakers brand would have to admit that in this case, it would support the argument that the Lakers didn't get them because they didn't try, not because they couldn't, which is evidence enough for me that we were taking on purpose and not on accident.  And yes, thank you for this discussion, its rare people can disagree without insults.  Kinda nice! 😁"
"Zach Lavine? Bulls might be nice this year tho, but before this year oof"
"1.	Robert Covington, Klay Thompson, Joe Harris, OG Anunoby, and Mikal Bridges are both better 3 point shooters and better defenders than Lonzo 2.	He has never impacted the defense like an elite option has before. Sure, hes a good defender, but Jrue Holiday is so many tiers above him and didn’t get a defensive award in 2020. Why would the Pels get such a terrible defensive rating on the perimeter if Lonzo was actually “elite”. 3.	He is not an elite playmaker in the half court. In fact, he his below average for a point guard. There’s a reason he was relegated to 3&amp;D over fucking Eric Bledsoe. He doesn’t have handles and cannot create his own shot. He was the secondary playmaker when Jrue started as SG. 4.	please tell me how he’ll be better than Zach Lavine, DeRozan, Lowry, Kyrie, Simmons, Beal, LaMelo, Trae, Harden, Butler, Garland, Sexton, etc to get an all star vote. Especially since he’s the 4th best player on his team"
"Ah yes, because choosing between who you want to take a game winner is how you decide who the best player is  Who would you rather take a game winner? Giannis or Zach LaVine?"
I think the Mavs are gonna find a taker for Porzingis even if they have to attach a draft pick. Then Dallas will sign Zach LaVine. Both LaVine and Luka share the same agent. Bill Duffy will engineer this move.
"Off of the dome:  Draymond at the 5, player who averages less that 11 per game. I don’t need to explain how much Draymond impacts a basketball game. But ill give the short version. Elite game changing defender, and elite playmaker on offense  Desmond Bane at the 3, player who has never been a consistent starter. Elite shooter, solid defender. Smart player who is very often in the right spot on both sides of the ball. Absolute steamer of a shooter.  Ja Morant at the 1, not an all star in the last 4 years (or yet so far in general). Elite playmaking point guard who can run the offense.  Zach Lavine at the 2, never been to a game 7. This was also a best player available situation at this point. Lavine someone else who can spread the floor at an elite level and take some scoring load off of Ingram and Ja. and is a solid wing and guard defender."
Jrue Holiday   Draymond Green  Zach LaVine   Cam Johnson
Zach lavine and g Leaguers would probably win 5 at least.
"Yes!   Because the backlash of an expensive front office, who they just brought to be the miracle worker of the Bulls franchise, just can't fail. The pressure to have ""some success"" is really great. And if the Bulls lost Zach after an organization haul, everything will just crumble.   The Bulls franchise right now is Zach LaVine. And Bulls situation is worst than just being capped out. If Zach manage to sneak in to an all NBA Team and demand a supermax... It's gonna be more complicated."
"&gt; and keep LaVine  Yes!   This was the main reason why AKME throw everything they could. And very few people realize this. To be coming from a Spurs fan(and not a Bulls fan) is something I was surprised at.   I keep saying that Bulls give up two firsts and two seconds, because Thad Young is a walking late first round pick. Every contender would pay a late first for him. And I agree that's hell expensive just to acquire DeMar in free agency.   The plan was indeed to extend Zach. But they need to achieve it while building DeRozan's value. Because I expect AKME to sell DeRozan, right after Zach inks his extension. Donovan will have that challenge on how he uses DeRozan to succeed. Because the only way Bulls can get out of that DeRozan signing, is to build DeRozan's value and get back what they lost in that S&amp;T for him."
Donovan Mitchell or Zach Lavine are my weird picks.  The solo stars like Giannis Jokic and Steph are probably most likely tho
"I’m pretty sure that Rozier could have signed more next off-season. It’s the same reason that Zach LaVine hasn’t signed a contract extension with the Bulls yet. If LaVine and Rozier wait till free agency, then they can sign a new contract using bird rights. A new contract would not have the same limits as a contract extension (I think it’s current salary * 1.25 or something), because Bird Rights basically means a team can re-sign a player to any contract, no matter their salary cap situation.   You may be thinking of the situation that Reggie Jackson and Cam Payne were just in this off-season. They had to negotiate a contract extension, instead of a new contract, because the Clippers and Suns didn’t have Bird Rights for the players. If Reggie Jackson and Cam Payne had played for those teams for at least 3 seasons, then those teams could have offered as much money as they wanted (up to the Max of course).   The NBA Cap Rules are confusing as shit."
I would say someone who’s big enough to drive through contact and can handle the ball. So maybe someone like Zach Lavine would be the lower end of guarantee. He’s not MVP caliber but he’s a top tier 3 point shooter with elite athleticism who can handle the ball.   If we’re going bigger - KAT isn’t an MVP but he’s certainly talented enough at all 3 levels of scoring to not be hacked and can score from anywhere while also being physically imposing enough to just body college dudes and also offer enough rim protection. He can also distribute well.  Basically a decent enough wing/big enough guard/scoring big.
"We live in the modern era of medicine. ACL injuries don’t mean what they used to, it was a career ended before and now multiple players have recovered from it continued to get even better like Zach Lavine. The same thing is happening with the Achilles injury.   Awww did LeBrons big ego hurt you with his shoulder comments? And damn you brought his dick up for no reason. Sounds like you’re projecting hella here, he’ll love you back one day.   Imagine comparing a guy who had 2 years of recovery vs barely 2 months for a sever injury. Nephews are crazy."
"There aren’t any good free agents next season and the cap is increasing, so there’s actually a chance that some team would throw more money at him.   Here’s the top 2021 unrestricted free agents:   1.	James Harden 2.	Bradley Beal 3.	Kyrie Irving  4.	Zach LaVine  -	Terrry Rozier -	Aaron Gordon -	Jusuf Nurkic -	TJ Warren -	Gary Harris -	Collin Sexton (He’s a RFA though, so you’d likely have to offer a max or figure out a sign and trade)   It’s pretty darn likely that Harden, Irving, and LaVine all re-sign with their current teams. As a result, Terry Rozier is arguably one of the best UFA’s available next season. His only real competition is Beal (obviously better), Aaron Gordon, Jusuf Nurkic, TJ Warren, and Gary Harris. I might pick Rozier over almost all of those dude other than Beal."
"I wouldn’t be so sure about that. There aren’t many good free agents available and the projected cap increase is going to mean that teams have money.   I just looked at available 2022 free agents and outside of James Harden (PO), Bradley Beal (PO), Kyrie Irving (PO), and Zach LaVine, Terry Rozier might arguably be the best unrestricted free agent available. The only guys he’s really competing with is Aaron Gordon. It’s a pretty empty free agent class. Everyone is just re-signing with their original teams.   **TL,DR:** There aren’t many good free agents next year. Outside of Harden, Beal, Irving, and LaVine, Terry Rozier might be the best UFA available. His only real competition is Aaron Gordon."
"&gt;all-star g-league roster and put on 2 servicable/good players who can potentially have a monster game, like Eric Gordon and Zach Lavine  Yup this has been tested, the bulls won more than one game sadly"
"I'd just take an all-star g-league roster and put on 2 servicable/good players who can potentially have a monster game, like Eric Gordon and Zach Lavine. I feel like with a bad enough roster, you need both Zach Lavine to drop like 50, Eric Gordon to have like 80% three shooting, and the other team to have an unremarkable night. If the stars align, maybe they a team with a defense poor enough as to where the g-leaguers can maybe contribute, like the Kings.  Edit: Against a top-heavy team like the Mavs, maybe you can have one of your g-leaguers Cobra-Kai the other team's best player and just take the suspension."
Zach LaVine
"SGA averaged 24 and 6. Sexton 24 and 4.   None of these guys ( including fox ) will make an all star game without some more team success I think, or unless they take another step forward a la Zach Lavine"
$1 says you see Zach Lavine on this in a year.

He certainly is now. Regardless of how the pelicans used him he’s still a PG. unless you think Chicago is paying him 80mil to backup Zach Lavine?
I thought it was Vince Carter for the longest time but it  gotta be Zach Lavine or Blake Griffin.
Zach Lavine is first team all-attractive and thats facts
The fact that Zach Lavine isn't on Team Good Looking is the biggest god damn snub I've ever seen.
They said the same thing about Zach Lavine and Jimmy Butler in Minnesota. Then Zach tore his acl and jimmy had a meniscus tear.   Love Thibs as a person but he never learns.
He could’ve been Zach Lavine at least
"1. lead the league in assists and assist% on a lower usage rate than guys like Zach Lavine, De'Aron Fox, and Devin Booker 2. 8th point guard in scoring 3. 6th in rebounds, and one of two guys under 6'10"" in the top 20  you can't honestly look at those numbers and tell me there's 30 players in the league better than that. He's the 4th or 5th best pg in the game depending on where you put Harden. Some of yall are straight up on crack"
"In the last few years Minnesota has turned Kevin Love, Zach Lavine, and 4 lottery picks into D-LO, Malik Beasley, ~~Ricky Rubio~~ Taurean Prince, and ~~Jarret Culver~~ Pat Bev."
"I imagine we must have very different definitions of household names then. All-Star, All-NBA, six straight years of 20 points or more, peaked at close to 27 a night, career-high or 57, Milwaukee’s fifth leading scorer in franchise history, Olympic gold medalist - that’s the makings of a household name to me.   To put it another way, if you were an NBA fan at the time and you *didn’t* know who Micheal Redd was, I’d have lots of questions. If you weren’t quite sure what Dan Gadzuric was all about, okay, couldn’t blame ya much. But Michael Redd? A dude finishing as a top-10 scoring leader for half the decade? I’d have just as many concerns as a basketball fan being unfamiliar with Zach LaVine in today’s game."
Isaiah  Thomas did it just fine at 5’8. I think his ceiling is Zach Lavine and floor is Jordan Clarkson
DeMar Derozan is not better than Zach Lavine.
Ben Simmons?  Rudy Gobert?  Zach Lavine?  Blake Griffin(in DETROIT?) D'Angelo Russel? ANDRE DRUMMOND? John Wall?  Demarcus Cousins?  De'Andre Jordan?  Melo?  Isiah Thomas? Kevin Love? Demar Derozan? Lamarcus Aldridge?
"I mean in no particular order: LeBron, Giannis, Luka, KD, Curry, Harden, Kawhi, Embiid, Jokic, AD, Dame, Trae Young, PG-13, Tatum, Booker, CP3, Mitchell, Jimmy Butler, and potentially Westbrook, Beal, Klay, Zach LaVine, KAT as well, too.  Give Beal/LaVine/KAT 4 seasons of apex LeBron as a teammate &amp; they absolutely can win a chip."
"In my opinion Booker is overrated, while Zach LaVine is underrated."
Zach Lavine is the most underrated player in the league imo. He has an argument for being a top 10 player.
Zach Lavine  It took me a while as a Bills fan to but him the gut but I love his drive and his improved defense.
"Zach LaVine &gt;&gt;&gt; Donovan Mitchell   Now that Mitchell hasnt really played defense in two years of playoffs in a row and is just trying to show his scoring prowess, I really think you could flip these two and Jazz do better while Bulls do worse.   Donovan is a slightly less efficient scorer with a great team around him. Zach scored with no one around him and really needs a Gobert to protect him."
Nobody in their right mind would view that 2nd team all-nba as anything but a reward for being the leading scorer on a team that was stacked with young talent. Zach Lavine has put up better numbers without even making all-star for crying out loud.
Zach Lavine??
"Look at the top scorers on lottery winners the past few years:   2021 draft: Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Collin Sexton, Pascal Siakam  2020 draft: Andrew Wiggins, Eric Paschall (WTF?), Devonte Graham, Zach Lavine  2019 draft: Julius Randle, Mike Conley, Kevin Knox (also WTF), Lebron James  Well, if you go by that list being eligible players, then I guess it's Lebron... Well, this was a huge waste of time."
Zach Lavine unless he gets some real playoff success
Zach Lavine &gt; Devin Booker. Zach does everything Booker does but is a better scorer inside and more athletic. Could have had the same success Booker did if their roles were switched and he was on the Suns this year.
"Zach Lavine &gt; Booker: More efficient, 3-lvl scorer and ppl will finally see how good he is now that the bulls have some talent around him."
Zach Lavine &gt; Bradley Beal
Zach LaVine &gt;&gt;&gt; D Book
Zach lavine is on the level of devin Booker maybe even a better defender
"Zach Lavine is poised to take a leap. He got a good squad around him and he really impressed me in the Olympics, especially his defence."
"Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Zach Lavine, etc...  they need to make a championship run or have some exceptional games like harden or lilliard to be not forgotten."
"Lavine &gt; Trae   if zach had the supporting cast that trae does i could easily see him making a deep playoff run, i guess we'll see in a year"
Zach Lavine IMO
Zach LaVine Talen Horten Tucker Fultz
As a Raptor fan how can you say that about Derozan lol. Sure he wasn't excellent in the playoffs against Lebron but he always played well in the regular season with the Raptors. We aren't even talking about top-end talent like Zach Lavine who i'm sure if you made a poll most people would rank above Pascal Siakam.
"Zach Lavine, not really a bold take from the scoring he’s been able to do. This year will be interesting to see how the bulls do with a lot of help around him."
Zach Lavine is a guy I was deff wrong about (thought he would suck)  Royce white didnt play but he was LBJ esque in college
Zach LaVine too LMAO
"Zach LaVine, dude is a baller."
Zach Lavine
"No, they got great value for Butler. Even though Dunn and Markanen didn’t work out they got two chances on high potential guys and got Zach Lavine"
Zach Lavine will sign as a free agent with Dallas next season. This means the Bulls don’t have a really successful season this year and the Mavs can open up a max salary slot by moving Porzingis for expiring contracts.
"They got Zach Lavine now, who's an insanely talented player so I don't think they're losing any sleep over butler"
Zach LaVine could probably beat it.
"Doc Rivers, De’Aaron Fox, Rajon Rondo, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kelly Oubre, Steve Nash, DeMarcus Cousins, Kevin Durant, Jaylen Brown, Lou Williams,  Chris Paul, John Wall, Ja Morant, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Draymond Green, Jayson Tatum, JJ Redick, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, and Udonis Haslem have all been guests on their podcast.   Obviously not all of these people are going to be anti-Semitic (one would hope), but just the fact that Jackson’s podcast has access to such a wide variety of NBA talent that hasn’t been disrupted despite Jackson’s track record shows that the hate being shown towards Meyers Leonard is partially insincere and probably coming from people who aren’t actually Jewish themselves."
"1st rounders:  Guards: Marcus Smart, Zach Lavine  Wings: Wiggins, Randle Center: Embiid  2nd rounders:  Guards: Dinwiddie, Clarkson Wings: Joe Harris, Jerami Grant Center: Jokic    I think the first rounders are a title favorite. Seconds rounders are probably a 3/4 seed in the west"
Jalen Green - Bradley Beal/Zach Lavine  Anthony Edwards - Bigger Donovan Mitchell  Cade Cunningham - Khris Middleton/SGA  Ja Morant - John Wall  Jonathon Kuminga - Raw Paul George  Tyrese Haliburton - Malcolm Brogdan
Zach lavine. If he didn't get hurt bulls would've been a 6-8 seed and only because he put them on his back.
Zach Lavine has the potential to be a defensive force/stopper this season.

Harden's strength is ironically his weakness. He's only dominant because he played on the Rockets and was given free reign to play his game. Which is a shady foul drawing game. Other than that he's a good point guard/shooting guard. Take away the foul drawing and given free reign of a team and he's no different than any other good point/shooting guard in the NBA. Put Damian Lillard or Zach Lavine or Jamal Murray in his position and they'll put up just as impressive if not mbetter numbers.   See 2021 playoffs.
"Bruh, in the finals… and I never said I thought he was an ALL TIME GREAT we’re literally comparing him to ZACH LAVINE"
"Empty-stats losers?  Zach Lavine is better than D Book, he just didn’t play with CP3 and Ayton.  The bulls will be positive this year and your take will be completely wrong."
"He got a big contract from a team that has staked its future on empty-stats losers like Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic and DeMar DeRozan. Plus Lonzo Ball, who doesn't even have the empty stats.  Believe me, the sadness is real. I'm from Chicago and I care about the Bulls as much as the Pelicans. This offseason I was overjoyed at the thought of the Pels getting rid of Ball so their good young guards would get to play.  But then Ball went to the other team I care about. Major bummer."
"Zach is actually very good off ball and will be okay with less touches.  I also think they’ll probably stagger DeRozan and Vucevic to play with the bench more.  They’re the oldest on the starting lineup so I think they’ll generally get subbed first.  Lonzo’s big and Donovan loves his 3 guard lineups so I think we’ll see a lot of Caruso, Lavine, Lonzo, or Coby, Lavine, Lonzo lineups and either one of those can run and gun."
You gotta admit Zach Lavine is a cool name
Embiid’s health is a ticking time bomb at this point. They need to go all in this year and next because I guarantee he won’t be the same after the next couple injuries.  I’d try to trade Simmons for someone like Paul George or Zach Lavine who would slot in nicely next to Embiid. Maybe flip Maxey and Thybulle for Lillard as a complementary piece too.  A bit three of Lillard/PG13/Embiid gets it done I think.

Mavericks gonna pay Zach lavine to leave.
"LOLwut.  Uhh, again, do you live under a rock...?  You realize Klutch/Paul are literally conspiring with AKME to overtake Chicago &amp; bring them back to relevancy....right?  Klutch just forced one of their most well-known clients into Chicago &amp; then subsequently signed a player that was already on the team.  The Klutch announcement when they signed ZLV was essentially a Bulls promo, not a  Zach LaVine promo.     Your comments are so bizarre, can anyone translate this for me?"
"3 way trade between lonzo, ben simmons, and terry rozier to get the ball brothers all in charlotte. Ben in chicago and rozier in philly. Liangelo ball becomes the next seth curry being the ignition off the bench. Ben and zach lavine have amazing chemistry"
"Ignoring the lack of obvious nuance in your comment, every time he is traded, the team that traded him suffers and ends up losing from it. The timber wolves are still garbage, the bulls might finally benefit from the the move getting zach Lavine and building around him (good on them actually, they were smart) and the sixers missed a Jimmy like player in 2020 and choked hard in 2021.  You can demonise Jimmy all you want, but everywhere he goes, the team just seems to do better. Like when the bulls were competitive, the timberwolves weren’t a cesspool of hot garbage, the sixers were one shot to beating the champions and the heat have returned to relevancy"
"I always think of this play when people are trying to rate NBA players as athletes but conveniently ignore anyone outside the top 50-100 players.  There are few guys stuck at the end of the bench/g-league ([like DJ Stephens, though he's in France now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WKb_j3acH8) who can outjump people like Zach Lavine or Aaron Gordon with ease- they just aren't good enough at basketball to get on the floor very often."
"The reports I read earlier this year sounded like Zach was ready to sign a contract extension this offseason. Sounds like the Bulls decided to keep salary cap flexibility to sign Derozan and Ball this offseason and roll the dice with Lavine after the season.   It may have been the right decision to field as strong a team as possible this year, but when your star player has been talking about respect, you do have to wonder. Zach came  back from an ACL injury, so I'm sure he wants to secure the bag even if it means leaving some money on the table. On the Bulls not extending him this offseason, he said ""It's business...I have a lot of different motivations in my life I try to use on the court."""
I mean we did that with Zach Lavine and it worked perfectly for us (!)
honestly fuck the clippers they just don’t play basketball the right way with their trash talking and thuggishness on the court 🤬🤬🤬🤬 They should fucking trade pg13 (DAE CHEATED ON GF???) for better guys like gordon hayward and one half of zach lavine. Only when we get them and have zubac and kennard leading the team can we truly be a good team that plays basketball the right way!!!!
"De'Aaron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Zach Lavine, Anthony Edwards, Ja Morant come to my mind."
i hope you guys are ready for Zach Lavine to become a top 10 player this season
"Zach Lavine averaged 27.4 points on 63.4% TS last season.   &gt; stat-padding, chucking loser  Lmao."
How did y’all forget Zach Lavine smh
zach lavine average starter
"Obviously Kyrie is more proven and has the better career. That’s not debatable. I was just referring to them as players right now.  I also never said Zach is the clear-cut best 2-guard, I just said he has a case for it. This season will be his chance to prove it IMO. Right now, I think the conversation is between Booker, Mitchell, Irving, and LaVine. In terms of talent and production, they’re all right there. I think any of the four has a case for best SG. I just like LaVine, so I’m picking him lol."
"For years now, I've been telling my friends that Zach Lavine is the real deal. He's been stuck on some really bad teams, but it seems like he's got a decent squad this year. I'm excited to see what he can do"
Did y'all mention Zach Lavine?
"This is a pretty accurate list imo... theyre usually out there... only one i may swap, is beal to 14, Butler off the list, and Zach Lavine at 15... but, i will admit bias in this statement, cuz I'm a Bulls Stan."
Don't think anyone has mentioned him yet so I'll go with Zach Lavine
Zach LaVine
Zach LaVine
Zach LaVine
Zach LaVine
They put Beal at 11 and CJ McCollum over Zach Lavine and Jonas Valanciunas in the 90s. The list does not make sense
"Are there rules by trying to spell in the lowest number of players possible? Otherwise you could do something like this..or even more ridiculous   Pels  zach lavi**NE**  zion **W**illiamson  &amp;#x200B;  paul ge**OR**ge  **LE**bron james  dami**AN** lillard  **S**teph curry  &amp;#x200B;  giannis antetokoum**P**o  jo**EL** embiid  luka donc**I**c  pas**CA**l siakam  john colli**NS**  &amp;#x200B;  PG: Steph, D-Lil  SG: Luka, Lavine  SF: Lebron, PG13  PF: Giannis, Zion, Siakam  C: Embiid, Collins"
"Zach Lavine. Think they got some got some decent guys in the off season, wanna see him lead a team to the post season.   Ja Morant. I want to see Ja develop on consistent jumper, he’d be nasty.  James Wiseman. Wanna see him be the piece to help the warriors back into the playoffs. He has potential."
"&gt; So Rich Paul can't win either way.  Sure he can, he can just do his fucking job.  &gt;You guys trying to discredit him for 1 client. Yet ignore the group of clients he put together.  [Here's the list](https://hoopshype.com/reps/rich-paul/). It's full of completely unremarkable players, making exactly the salary you'd expect players in their role to make.  However, as an agent, he has a fiduciary duty to **all** of his clients, not just *most of them*. And assuming these allegations are correct, he fucked up so badly that he will unquestionably lose the lawsuit, and potentially his agent's license.  &gt;Zach Lavine was the hottest FA on the market. He chose Rich Paul.  He sure did. And hopefully Rich isn't going to fuck him over, but we'll known that in a year.  &gt;Klutch still winning.  Dumb shit like this makes you sound like either an edgy 12 year old kid or Charlie Sheen on cocaine. Those two things are generally quite similar, and neither is a good look.   Also - this has never been about whether Klutch is ""winning"" or not. They're associated with the biggest player in the game, so of course they're winning from a financial point of view.  As far as actually being agents, all indications are that they're pretty fucking mediocre in any negotiation where they don't have LeBron's weight to hold over the front office."
So Rich Paul can't win either way.  You guys trying to discredit him for 1 client. Yet ignore the group of clients he put together.  Zach Lavine was the hottest FA on the market. He chose Rich Paul.  Klutch still winning.
"No, a trade will happen if he holds out. Unless you believe Morey is okay with losing in the 1st round or not making the playoffs with the false hope of raising simmons value.  also a year ago zach lavine or Harden for ben simmons was very realistic. Now he cant even get Halliburton."
"&gt;Notice that it says best players, not best players on the best teams.  I'm well aware, looked at that definition earlier today. Still, it's pretty clear that the best players are usually guys who contribute the most to winning, and therefore are on teams that win. I'm not trying to advocate for team success being more important than individual, but you're saying it shouldn't matter at all.   It's often easier for players to put up good numbers on a bad team because someone has to score, look at Jerami Grant or Zach LaVine this year. Making that translate into winning basketball is a lot more difficult. Again, if you get great stats but you don't win, what's the point? Would you advocate for LaVine making All-NBA this year? He's at least in the ballpark of Beal stats-wise but he got one 3rd team vote.  &gt;As for Beal being better this year, his stats are nearly identical. He averaged 30.5 last year vs 31.3 this year. His PER was actually better last year than this year (23.2 last year vs 22.7 this year). TS was .58 last year vs .59 this year.  Yeah, his stats were nearly identical after adding another high scorer in Westbrook, that's not easy to do. Often times players lose some of their production when they're joined by another good player.  Not a totally fair comparison but Harden's PPG dropped about 10 points from last year now that he plays with KD/Kyrie.  &gt;Ben clearly didn’t deserve All-NBA over him  Then why do you think 43 media members voted for him as compared to just 26 for Beal? The voters aren't perfect and frankly I think some of them are idiots, but they are paid to cover basketball as a career so presumably they know at least something about what's going on. Simmons got more 2nd team votes than Beal and more 3rd team votes too."
"I mean he's not good looking like Curry, Zach Lavine, Chandler Parsons, others, but facial features aren't everything in determining attractiveness, right?   The guy is tall and in great shape, something that people can work at (as opposed to facial features which can't really be changed unless you get a surgery)."
Zach Lavine
"wrong sport but carson palmer, jason kelce, chris harris jr in football zach lavine is another one. his fg% went down but his hops were back right away"
"I am so on the Zach LaVine train.   I had the pleasure of watching a few Bulls game this year - I love his game! Such a versatile scorer.  Kinds of reminds me of a prime Jason Richardson. Very athletic, and has the tools to score from every single inch of the court."
"&gt;He was on pace to be remembered as a good stats, bad team guy until he was rescued.   You're treating him like a towns or Zach Lavine when he won MVP lol"
"Heel will for sure be Nets overall with a side of Lakers. Baby face probably Bulls or Mavs. For players heel, Trae Young. Baby face Zach Lavine."
"Zach LaVine, average starter... I'm going to burn Nate Silver to the ground.  (In case the fbi is reading this, this is a joke)"
Billy Donovan is defensive minded coach it will be main task for him this season but Bulls is in the top 20 defense for years even with worse defensive rosters.  Bulls really had trouble last year with defending rival ballhandlers in both half court. Transition defense was terrible because of Coby just can't defend anyone. Now we have Ball and Caruso in the roster both of them can defend main ballhandler in perimeter. Lavine's defensive improvements were one of the least talked storylines of the last season as well. And also Bulls are loaded with one-way defensive wings in the bench unit. Perimeter defense won't be problem as long as Derozan don't defend the main perimeter threat.   Bulls defense having troubles in the post since they lost Robin Lopez as well. Giving rival teams most offensive rebounds in the league didn't helped them as well. But Vucevic is one of the better rebounders in the league without Markkanen and Carter Jr's rebounding problems and having Ball and Derozan gonna help them as well about rebounding. Bulls won't be great defensive team or anything but until playoffs I don't think they will be bottom 10 teams. If Donovan cover Vucevic's post defense with drop defense and use Patrick Williams and Zach Lavine as help defender atleast they can limit the pain.
Zach Lavine (I'm from Chicago)
Zach lavine should be all star
For us it's Zach Lavine. I don't think he was a *bust* but people were disregarding him and basically thought he'd be out of the league after his injury.
"[Here's Rich's client list](https://hoopshype.com/reps/rich-paul/).  LeBron and AD aren't signing with the Sixers anyway, and I don't think Zach LaVine is on their shortlist.  Beyond that, he doesn't have any clients they would be interested in."
Zach Lavine is gonna get his respect this year
"It’s gonna be Zach for sure. Bulls were going to make the playoffs this year if healthy. Now they added DeMar, Lonzo, Caruso and got another year under their belt  Bulls might be able to win a playoff series this year and that’ll help people’s perception of/exposure to LaVine"
*Stares angrily in Zach Lavine*
Austin Rivers and Evan Turner became a lot more respected Zach Lavine Steph Curry to an extent
"The Chicago Bulls may have recently brought in a lot of elite new talent (DeMar DeRozan, Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso) to the already promising squad of Zach LaVine, Patrick Williams and Nikola Vučevič, but I think it will take some time for them to establish chemistry and flow well together. Also, we need a good Center. I wanna be hopeful for their upcoming season but I also have to be realistic."
Stephen Curry  Bradley Beal  Jerami Grant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Myles Turner   With a bench of  Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine  Bojan Bogdanovic
"PG: De'Aaron Fox, John Wall  SG: Paul George (AS), Zach Lavine (AS), Marcus Smart  SF: Kawhi Leonard (SS), Nicholas Batum, Jae Crowder  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (SS), John Collins  C: Myles Turner, Serge Ibaka"
Just wait. He’s had to survive being the sole focuses of defenses for like 3 seasons now with little help. He’s not going to regress with the defense being able to help less. Also in your numbers you should factor in Zach &amp; shoot percentages which have always been amazing and this is without any real PG/creator for this time.     People sleep on Lavine harder than they know.
Zach Lavine. He's gonna be a lob threat all game long with Ball and Derozan on the team. Plus he's just hella fun to watch as an elite level shooter and iso player
Zach Lavine.   He has shown improvement every single year and is now becoming a much better defender. combine that with the fact that the Bulls are probably a playoff team and you have yourself a bonafide super star in the making
Zach lavine. I really think he will score 28 ppg and bulls will be top 5 in East.
Barnes isn’t as good as Suggs and Green can’t be mentioned in MVP talks imo because he is too one dimensional. Still obv a top 3 pick/player but Zach LaVine averaged 27 on +6 efficiency and nobody is putting him in mvp talks bc all he can does is the scoring. Green &gt; Suggs tho
"Joining the league in 1990 the Minnesota Timberwolves drafted all time great Kevin Garnett in 1996 and proceeded to have this legend of the sport for his best years until 2007 at which they were able to draft Kevin Love in the 2008 NBA draft who proceeded to give his best All NBA years to the Timberwolves up until 2014 at which point they traded him for the #1 pick in the 2014 draft, Andrew Wiggins as well as selecting future All Star Zach LaVine in the same draft. In the next year Minnesota would proceed to solidify their young core taking the greatest shooting big man of all time Karl Anthony Towns at #1 in the 2015 draft to add to their young core. To provide leadership to this team Minnesota brought on former coach of the year Tom Thibodeau and then traded Zach LaVine for perennial 2 way All Star Jimmy Butler. As the Butler situation soured in early 2019 Minnesota still had their young superstar center and had traded Andrew Wiggins for the young Brooklyn All Star DAngelo Russell. Immediately that 2020 draft Minnesota had the option to draft LaMelo Ball but opted for the young stud Anthony Edwards to create a new star studded young core.   Minnesota Timberwolves all time record: .394 win rate and 9 playoff appearances in 31 seasons."
Honestly a current NBA player that is similar to him is Zach Lavine. Zach has a little more athleticism but I think their game is similar or Beal maybe a better comp.
"I love me some Zach Lavine, but this contest should have had two winners, to not go in Gordon got robbed territory."
Zach Lavine for MJ? In a heartbeat
"what situation does he need? he's been on how many teams? he's been the same player his entire career. he's just slightly more efficient now, but still below league average TS.  there's plenty of guys in the ""same situation"" as d'lo but have been much more efficient. Zach LaVine. Booker for years.  he's a good player who thinks he's a great player. he's proven he cannot lead a winning team. he needs to fit into a 6th man role and play 25mpg. if he accepts that role and then fine. but he can't be a 34mpg 1st/2nd option on a winner."
Zach LaVine
"Zach Lavine for MJ, yes please!"
"Lavine for Jordan. Sorry Zach, you understand."
I love Zach LaVine to pieces but he's not the GOAT.
Zach Lavine for Michael Jordan? Idk man pretty tough
The original comment said “if he could create his own shot just a little bit”.  There’s also the matter of sample size. It’s entirely possible that the second half of last season was a super hot streak of games for MPJ. Guys who have been doing it for a longer period of team get more benefit of the doubt. For example Zach Lavine put up better regular season numbers than both Kawhi and Harden this past season yet nobody considers him a better scorer than either.
This is one of the wildest comments I’ve ever seen on this sub  Those bad teams have no use for all time greats?  You wouldn’t trade Christian Wood for Hakeem right now?  The Bulls wouldn’t trade Zach Lavine for Michael Jordan?
Lavine is not a great defender but he is 100% a notch above Donovan and Book. They all have their own strengths on offense and can all go off at any time on that end. If Zach can have a similar kind of year that he had last year the guy above you could be right.
Zach Lavine
"It’s a team sport so why are you judging Klay as an individual bc of something his team did? People always refuse to give Kyrie enough credit bc he’s only ever won with Lebron ahead of him and has failed to win on his own, but this logic doesn’t extend to Klay for some reason? If he fits well as a #2 and #3 on a great team that’s cool but that doesn’t mean he’s better than the guy leading a 50 win team as the #1 or 1a bc there’s different levels of responsibility and defensive attention garnered in those situations. Do you want me to say DeAndre Ayton is better than KAT bc he fits on the Suns better than Zach Lavine would? No you wouldn’t"
"Has to be someone who jumps really high, while also doing tons of good shit while lacking in some areas; Zach Lavine maybe?"
Is he still the only guy still to win dunk contest and 3 point contest? I feel Zach Lavine could definitely do that as long as Klay and Steph don't participate.
Zach lavine
"Zach LaVine draft night - ""Fuck Me!"""
Zach LaVine has career averages of .458/.385/.824 and hit .507/.419/.849 last season
Nah I think Zach Lavine has become properly rated at this point
"This team is constructed to resign Zach Lavine. This in no way resembles the  ""signed only to put butt's in seats""  Bulls with Dwayne Wade."
"What I’m saying is Klay is a player with many weaknesses in his game that he’s had the luxury of having masked by the all-time talent around him thats why I’m talking about their capabilities as a #1 bc that’s as close to a vacuum as we can get….Klay Thompson needs a Steph Curry to create for him and make up for him nights where his shot isn’t falling since he can’t get to the rim or line at a high level, he needs a Draymond/Iggy to get the ball to him and make up for his poor team defense that drags down his defensive value….also Zach Lavine can’t lead a team to a title in his current form but he’s better than Klay ever was, but I wouldn’t be surprised if many would rather have Klay as a #2…if you need a superstar and DPOTY ahead of you to be more valuable then you’re not the better player, you’re just in a better situation for your skillset."
Zach Lavine and Deaaron Fox
Zach Lavine
"It’s also innate though. I’m pretty sure I’ve seen videos of Zach Lavine doing plyometrics but even without them, he’d still be a top 1% leaper off of one leg. You don’t get to be in the top .01% without at least some sort of physical gifts."
Ben Simmons   Zach LaVine   Khris Middleton   Paul George  Anthony Davis  I wanted to make a team specifically catered towards Ben Simmons strengths. Also this jumbo team is pretty awesome.  PS op you should decrease the 30.
Imma cheat a bit and use players out of position  PG: Kyrie Irving  SG: Zach Lavine  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Ben Simmons  No one is beating this
"I have said like ten times in this thread that three teams have max cap space and two can get there with more work. You are the person who said "" Im sure the more you looked at it there’s more that could get close.""  It's not true. It won't be true. The Knicks aren't dumping the three first round picks necessary to dump more than 30 million in salary. They ran their off-season to have contracts to trade for a star under an existing long term contract, not to get off of money in 22.  ""The Bulls renting their 20mil from Lavine walking for picks, and the Bulls taking back salary and picks for Lavine is the same thing. ""  It's not the same thing. 29 million is nine million more than 20 million. How do you think the nine million dollar difference doesn't matter to the Bulls? Why would they approach the luxury tax for a team that's going to take a step back by losing in LaVine. I never said the pick would be better. I think the picks could get from trading Zach in a S&amp;T or using their cap space to pick up assets are largely the same.  If a good team acquires Zach, their pick is going to be in the twenties. If a good team is dumping salary like the Jazz did in trading Favors to the Thunder this past offseason to lessen their tax bill, the pick is going to be in the twenties. And because of the cap space crunch and how many teams they are going to be way above the luxury tax next season, the Bulls will have the same opportunity to rent their space. The Thunder got a first rounder for taking on ten million of Favors, not even 20 million. And there would be more opportunities in your absurd scenario where the Knicks get one of the 3 to 5 cap space teams to eat all of their money.  Eager for your next post where you explain 20 million dollars and 29 million dollars are the same thing because you love arguing and playing word games,  just because you don't understand next year's free agent market and want to believe moving 30 million is no big deal. And that the Bulls would take on 29 million in contracts when they are taking a step back when they could get a similar asset for 20 million or even lower."
Zach LaVine or Damian Lillard
"Really cause based on [this article wrote by the Washington Post,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/03/25/bobby-portis-says-hes-always-been-seen-villain-even-before-he-broke-teammates-face/?outputType=amp) Zach Lavine said that Portis ""was not at fault""."
"The Bulls aren't paying players worse than LaVine 29 million dollars next season. You also presuppose that the Thunder and Pistons are going to tie up 30 million in cap room but the Bulls won't be able to rent out their 20 million. That makes no sense. You are really having to strain to justify your original opinion that all these teams out there could get cap space, forcing the Bulls to do something they don't want to do, instead of just admitting its clearly a difficult market and its unlikely Zach would get to somewhere he wants in a sign and trade."
then noone would be a dark horse. zach lavine winning it would be a suprise in every scenario
Zach LaVine after he leads the Bulls to the best record in the league
"I feel confident the Bulls will be a playoff team this year. My only concern is that they sacrificed draft picks and cap flexibility to win now with 32-year-old DeMar DeRozan and 30-year-old Nikola Vucevic, who are fine players but aren’t LeBron and AD or Durant and Harden.   They are gambling hard on major improvements from 26-year-old Zach LaVine, 23-year-old Lonzo Ball and 20-year-old Patrick Williams. It sounds to me like a playoff team, maybe even a second round playoff team, but not an Eastern Conference Finals team."
"I don't have to look at it. I have a cap sheet with the whole league. I was only expanding it with an open mind to prove the point. The Kings/Knicks/Timberwolves tier of cap space teams literally are thirty million away, which isn't close or could get close.  It's absurdly far. It's a quarter of the cap. If I looked at it more, I would see the next closest is the Wizards and Rockets -- who are at the cap already. So no, there aren't more that could get close.   No one has gotten rid of $30 million in cap space in a single season and they certainly haven't done it in a cap environment like this one. It's never happened as far as I know. This summer and next aren't any comparison. It's way more limited. The Bulls just had to give up a first to dump Aminu and that's when there was way more cap room in the league.  Next season with no space and all of the cap space teams having a point guard, who in the league is taking on Derrick Rose for $14 million without a real first? And then when whoever does that, that's one less team that can take on Nerlens Noel's 10 million for a first. And then whoever does that, that's one less team that can take on Alec Burks for 10 million, also probably for a first. These are negative value inflated contracts that the Knicks signed so they could use in a talent for talent trade.  The Knicks are hoping for Zion or Dame, but are going to three first rounders pre-emptively for the right to bid on Zach LaVine?  And please answer why it's in the Bulls best interest to take on $29 million to facilitate a sign and trade and get a bad first when if they let Zach walk, they could have $20 million and sell that space for a first.  Even in the situation where Zach is attempting to force a sign and trade, it'd make more sense to just let him go and use the flexibility for the same type of asset while not spending the same amount of money."
If Zach lavine was playing next to The MVP Joker I would imagine him going off   as well. This is not a slight to Murray he is absolutely a great player but his team has pretty much always been than Lavines. If Murray hadn't gone on that tear two years ago no casual on this sub would know about him I stg
"I can’t buy the Mitchell hype personally. People are anointing him far beyond what he’s proven himself to be imo. He is drastically less efficient than Zach with way better support. I know he’s had some good playoff performances which seem to make up people’s minds on him as a superstar but imo he’s one of the more overrated young players in the league. He’s certainly a very good player don’t get me wrong, but personally I have zero doubt the Jazz would have been as good or better if you replaced Mitchell with Lavine.   Personally I believe that Gobert, not Mitchell, is the reason the Jazz were a 1 seed and are currently a playoff lock every season."
Zach Lavine &gt; Devin Booker Go Bulls!
These aren’t the worst but pretty much any Zach LaVine trade proposal
Zach Lavine &gt; Devin Booker
"It's really splitting hairs IMO. Lavine is a bucket-getter no doubt. 3 level scorer. Booker, maybe, has a bigger ""bag"" but he's a very slightly worse scorer overall than Zach Lavine perhaps. Booker, I would say, however, was a pretty serviceable defender last season on a night-to-night basis. Not impressive by any means but in the 50th percentile range, give or take. Lavine, comparatively, was in the 30-40th percentile on any given night based on the eye test. Certainly better than previous seasons and not terribly egregious, but to say he was even average would be generous. If this coming season, Lavine can continue to improve and be an average to above average defender of guards and smaller wings, as he flashed in Tokyo, while Booker has similar output to 2020, Lavine should be considered one of the best 20 or so players in the league ahead of Booker."
"Love how upvotes could mean you might actually be making people think about it and agree, or they're just not that hot of a take to begin with.  Also homer takes getting downvoted, as they should be. Nobody needs to hear how Zach Lavine is better than Donovan Mitchell or Jayson Tatum coming from a Bulls fan."
Zach Lavine &gt; Devin Booker
jaylen brown is better than donovan mitchell and zach lavine (and sometimes dbook)
Whoever trades for Ben needs to already have a team w a bunch of solid shooters to make up for him being a non threat and that limits his takers. The bulls won’t want to give up Lavine an excellent shooter for Ben Simmons alone. I see Zach as being more valuable overall too.
"Trade Sexton, Lauri, some of their rookie contract people like Wade to make salaries match, and a couple picks for Simmons.  Now what? Well, you're at the salary cap, so your ability to sign free agents is limited. You don't have any players that are above average half-court playmakers, so your offense will be painful and come in bits and spurts. And now you're missing picks. Cleveland would be signing up for ""fringe playoff team for 4 years."" People would rather tank and hope than sign up willingly to win 35 games.   There are always players that are fringe all-star players on bad teams. Beal just went 35-38 with Russel Westbrook. Curry just missed the playoffs. Zach Lavine is on a pretty bad team. Fans are not happy to do that if you're giving away your 2-3 best players and draft picks."
bro im telling you zach lavine is actually good now.
*Zach LaVine prepares The Shot III*
"The ol' Zach Lavine, huh?"
"Lavine was basically thought of as a dunker at the time too. Crazy how it’s turned out, if you asked anyone who would be the better player between Zach and Wiggins 10/10 picked Wiggins"
"Zach LaVine didn't particularly want to be in Chicago when he signed an offer sheet from the Kings, but it turns out that getting paid solves a lot, and winning solves even more.  So if NOLA thought Zo was the best fit for their team and would help them win, they shoud've paid him and used the next 4 years to fix the relationship, not let him walk for negative return on investment."
Zach lavine
What about Zach Lavine? Does he belong in this convo?
"Zach ""Luol Deng"" Lavine"
Coby White and Zach Lavine are literally the only players still on the roster from the GarPax era. The GarPax regime has ended and the AK-Eversley Regime has begun!
"Why does he keep trying to play thru his injuries? It's early in the season, just take the time off to heal up.  Same for Zach Lavine."
to zach lavine right? (hopefully this thumb aint too bad)
zach lavine breakout year on a national scale (like booker and trae last year) on the WAY
I have Lavine on my team too and I dont feel pretty good about it lol. Zach is pretty stubborn and forces himself to play through injuries (he played for a stretch with a sprained ankle and did poorly) so while he can play he may produce a little bit off depending on how much it obthers him
"His playmaking is improving but it’s just not as good as these guys, particularly Mitchell and Murray, who seem to have elite court vision, feel for manipulating defenses with in-between game, and the ability to hit difficult passing angles. Both probably have a slightly tighter handle than Lavine as well. Mitchell’s supremely long arms and massive shoulders allow him to sling some wild passes Zach literally is not physically capable of."
"If by playoffs he means play-in, I think they absolutely can stay in the playoff race without Lavine, for the time being at least. Zo, Derozan, and Vucci is a play-in team at the very least on it's own imo. With Zach I think the Bulls are a top 4 seed. Vucci is a professional at dragging his team to the 8th-9th seed, Derozan has always been a great player in general but especially in the regular season. Zo is one of the best complementary pieces you can have that isn't an All-Star.    Do you really think it's that unreasonable to say this current iteration of the Bulls can reach the playoffs without Lavine?"
"I don’t get the love for Zach Lavine. In my opinion, he doesn’t contribute to winning at all and is the epitome of “someone has to score” for every team. I think he’s a good player but nothing special."
"As a huge Chicago Bulls fan and Zach Lavine fan, I hope it heals as quickly as possible!"
"Rated LaVine, Booker, Mitchell, Brown in that order in the middle of last season, got many negative replies. Didn't age well since Zach missed playoffs and Booker was in Finals."
Disagree about Towns being better...I don't think you understand how good Zach is. You listed defence and passing when KAT is objectively worse than Lavine at both those things. Lavine's scoring last season was near Curry level efficiency at 50/42/85 while basically being double and triple teamed because his next best player on the team was Thad Young (prior to Vuc arriving)
So Zach Lavine is healthier because he didn’t get injured last year. Even though he’s never played an entire season and hasn’t played over 60 games since his sophmore year. r/nba logic lol.
Zach Lavine and Jimmy Butler were both better than prime D Rose from an effiency / skill standpoint
"i'm sure some of them do still. i bet jaylen brown does, he kinda has a cohesive style. ditto with zach lavine"
Zach Lavine
Ahem... ZACH LAVINE
Zach Lavine stinks
Zach Lavine is better than Devin Booker
"they're each still better players than zach because of playmaking. he turns it over too much, and doesn't have nearly the vision, pnr feel/in-between game, and passing bag that all these guys have.  but as a secondary scorer attacking rotating defenses, hes better than all of them. no guard in the league has his combination of spot up shooting, pull up shooting, and slashing as zach.  just look at the comparison of last season. booker played on an amazing team, where he got to be the second guard/playmaker behind chris paul, on an amazing, coherent team offense. lavine basically had to pound the rock on a shit team with shit teammates, with defenses concerned literally only about him. he scored more points on higher efficiency. it's lowkey one of the more ludacris scoring seasons the league saw last year, given the context.  [https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm\_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player\_id1=lavinza01&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;player\_id2=bookede01&amp;p2yrfrom=2021](https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=lavinza01&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;player_id2=bookede01&amp;p2yrfrom=2021)  booker 2020-21 (age 24 season): 25.6 ppg, 48.4% FG on 19.2 attempts per game, 34% 3PT on 5.5 attempts, 86.7% FT on 5.9 attempts, 4.3 assists, 3.1 turnovers  lavine 2020-21 (age 25 season): 27.4 ppg, 50.7% FG on 19.4 attempts per game, 41.9% 3PT on 8.2 attempts, 84.9% FT on 5.1 attempts, 4.9 assists, 3.5 turnovers"
"1) Lavine’s between the legs free-throw line dunk was better than Aaron Gordon’s over the mascot. Aaron couldn’t have done Lavine’s but Lavine def could’ve done Gordon’s.  2) Zach Lavine is the best player out of Booker and Mitchell and I really don’t think it’s close.   And yes, I am a biased homer whose favorite player is Lavine"
"Allen Iverson is not a Top 50 player in NBA history, and in today's NBA he's no better than Zach Lavine or Bradley Beal (particularly since he such was a poor 3-pt shooter, but in fairness that wasn't as necessary in his era).  Elite durability, elite toughness, elite stamina, an amazing player for his size. But his entire offense was built on isolation scoring, so while he would score 30+ points per game, his offenses were regularly in the bottom 10.   The counter argument to that is that he never had good players around him, so he had to do it all himself on offense. My counter to that counter: the only way to win with Iverson was to build the offense around giving him the ball every single time, and he was so bad on defense that you HAD to surround him with defense-heavy players like Eric Snow, Theo Ratliff, Dikembe Mutombo, etc.  The majority of AI's legacy is due to his off-court persona and his one Finals run, and more specifically beating the Lakers in one game, and even more specifically than *that* the moment where he stepped over Tyronn Lue. Without the Finals run, Iverson never got past the 2nd round of the playoffs.  Even that one Finals run was overrated IMO. They beat a bad Pacers team (ok fine, it's round 1), then they barely escaped the 5-seed Raptors at the buzzer of game 7, then they beat the Bucks in 7 in a series that I 100% believe was rigged, and then lost to the Lakers in 5.   Basically I think that Iverson's career played out **exactly** as it had to play out to build his legacy. He has a coach that allows him to take every shot, he has a franchise that surrounds him with defenders and low-usage players to maximize AI's talents on offense, he has a single Finals run through some very lucky circumstances, and then he has an iconic moment in NBA history stepping over Lue. Without all of that, he's another high volume, low efficiency scorer that never could advance in the playoffs.  People just dismiss it as ""you didn't see him play"" -- I'm 35, those were my prime viewing years. And my best friend was an AI fanboy so I definitely watched him a *ton*."
Who out of these 30 are you taking Gobert over? Serious question  Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Joel Embiid  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Bradley Beal  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Kyrie Irving  Trae Young  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Karl-Anthony Towns  Bam Adebayo  Jaylen Brown  Jrue Holiday  Zach LaVine  Deandre Ayton   Ja Morant  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
Zach Lavine for all three. He has really turned himself into one of the most efficient scorers in the league.
Zach LaVine 1000%
Zach Lavine is better than Dbook and donovan mitchell
Zach lavine is better than Bradley Beal
"Yeah, people seem to spend a *lot* of time concentrating on what Demar doesn't do - he's a bad defender, he likes to be The Man on iso ball, he shoots from 15 feet in an era where nobody in the league does that unless they have 2 seconds to shoot - and as a result they don't get into what he *can* do. I think as a result of that DDR is lowkey one of the more underrated players in the league.  I've been absolutely loving what he's been in Chicago so far. Last night the Bulls were just getting destroyed by the Raptors' fullcourt press and in a way that looked sickeningly familiar, in spite of Lavine and Pat Williams being the only holdovers from last year (also Coby White but he's injured) - guys trying to do too much, playing too fast, getting weirdly frantic. Then Derozan was just like ""okay, give me the ball"", calmly walked the shot clock down to 8 seconds like it was still 2001, and got a couple of daggers with isolation. It was exactly what the team needed and exactly what they didn't have last season in situations like that.  Demar reminds me a *lot* of late-career Kobe Bryant. Kobe was a much better defender in his prime although TBH by the time he was doing the things that remind me of him when I watch Derozan he wasn't doing much on that end anymore. But Kobe even when he was young had this thing where he'd try to break you down and sometimes you could do your job against him and keep him in the midrange and force him into a fallaway jumper... and he'd *still* manage to hit that, and not only hit the shot but since you knew he was going to hit it you had to still chase after him and when you chase after a guy falling away you're probably going to draw a foul doing it.  I'm sure there will be a time or two when Derozan goes iso-ball late and doesn't hit a shot and everyone, probably including me, will demand that he pass to Zach more. But at least last night, a little bit of calm, Kobe-style ball was just what was needed."
"You've got Zach Lavine this would be like telling him his dunks are just showing off, he can just lay it in because that wouldve worked just fine... but if you got it flaunt it I guess 🤣"
Would you rather have Zach Lavine or KG?
"Zach Lavine is an elite offensive option as well, just great everywhere on the court. He’s entering his prime too."
"Dont forget ""Zach Lavine spent most of his career jacking low percentage shots while playing poor defense""."
I would argue that Zach Lavine/Donovan Mitchell archetype isn’t as good as Anthony Davis/ Bam Adebayo archetype
Or like a dunk contest Zach Lavine maybe?
followed by Zach LaVine played under Jim Boylen
That’s just synonymous with “Zach LaVine played on the Timberwolves.”
&gt;This is first time Zach LaVine has won four straight NBA games  ok thats a wild stat
"He has gotten worse from 3 in recent years. But he's not overrated. And no way in HELL is zach LaVine ""way better""."
Zach lavine!!! MORE 3s THAN MJ  100 TO GO TO BEAT SCOTTIE.
"It's just nice to see the Bulls not have to rely on Zach LaVine carrying true entire offense to win, even if it's against a Raptors team that's not good. What are you do hurt for?"
I really like watching PG and Zach Lavine hoop.. they play so smoothly.
Zach Lavine but does it count if he used to play for my team?
Yup. Team record is probably why Miles got the nod over KD or Julius Randle too. I thought Zach Lavine had a good shot for the East this week.
Fringe all star/all star. Everyone just had a louder reaction to it because he was a kid. He was probably on the level of Zach Lavine.
"The real amazing thing about this record is how close we've come to breaking it relatively recently. Guys jacking up (and making) 10+ threes was a novelty only like 12 years ago, but in the last few years we've had Zach LaVine hit 13 (and 10 or more a few extra times) and Fred's absolutely bonkers 11-14 3PT game."
This reminds me of the zach Lavine and devin Booker argument
"Zach LaVine is literally an All Star, not having ONE post or highlight is highly suspect and worthy of criticism"
"Zach Lavine: he almost seems to glide with his movements. And every finish of his seems to be reminding everyone of his athleticism.  Kawhi Leonard: its just something about his jumper that makes you almost picture the path of the ball from his hand to the basket. His shot is like one of those oddly satisfying videos on the internet, you just know that everything will fall in place.  Jamal Murray: that man can almost walk on air with his layup package."
I don’t think anything will ever top Aaron Gordon vs Zach Lavine
So.... Zach Lavine?
People say Zach Lavine but I see a 6’6 Westbrook with a jumper (minus the playmaking)
Zach lavine? I thought this is his normal standard?
Yeah it's more likely KPJ gets traded and magically the Rockets take off because a more pass first playmaker next to Green fits better.  Green already is a lethal off ball player and with someone who can get him the rock on point he could be Zach Lavine like
former all star Zach Lavine with the breakout season
Honest question - is Zach Lavine on a Hall of Fame trajectory stat-wise?
Zach Lavine will be the MVP this year.
"Also fun fact, as told in one of Javale McGees YouTube vlogs, Zach Lavine has never won 4 games straight in his NBA career, like ever. We are on the brink of history."
"Now that is just an exaggeration. D'angelo Russell is just as smooth with everything he does, same with Zach Lavine and SGA."
Zach LaVine
There is no other right answer other than Zach Lavine
"zach lavine had one of the most aesthetically pleasing games, in my opinion."
Zach Lavine
Zach lavine
"Then you get to really fantasize about if Chicago had done Wiggins for Jimmy straight up. Rubio/LaVine/Butler/Millsap/KAT becomes an actual possibility.  Clearly it's just me rosterbating at this point since Zach was still recovering from the ACL, but man that team would have been fun."
"Also D Rose had a huge aversion to hanging on the rim. Like his dunks were exclusively violent but quick hammers.   Imo if he grabbed rim and just hung for a second to kill his momentum earlier in his career, his knees would've taken less of a beating, on top of not landing on his toes and locking his knees. Look at Zach Lavine, I noticed after he recovered from the ACL tear, he started hanging after dunks a lot."
"Easy answer Trea. Maybe lamelo in a few years. A harder choice would be like trea, Zach lavine, or Gianninis"
Zach Lavine
"Your reasoning is so stupid it practically drools. By that logic Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal, and KAT aren't good players. None of these guys, Trae included, are winning jackity shit on the Thunder. Have you seen the rest of that roster?  Also, are you suggesting total shooting is somehow a flawed stat? I can't make heads or tails of that comment."
That Zach Lavine vs. Aaron Gordon dunk off was GOAT.
"Go back and read our conversation—I’m not sure where your aggression is coming from, but I think you’ll be pretty embarrassed to realize that you’re completely overreacting to my benign comments.  It is my understanding that 538 is a literal real-time projection that becomes more accurate as the season progresses. Again, I’m not an expert, but I thought that it was widely agreed upon that those projections cannot be used as an indication of the postseason until at least a few weeks into the season. I think that such projections can be useful, I am not disregarding 538, but it is my understanding that there aren’t enough data for the projections to reflect reality just yet.  I said that it wasn’t crazy to assume the Bulls will get sixth seed in the East, which is literally what the Vegas odds you listed project, so I’m not sure where the disagreement there is.  The media is definitely not overrating the Bulls from what I’ve seen—if you can point to some overhyped TV segments or articles, I’d be surprised. I disagree with you about Zach LaVine—I mean, look where Devin Booker was without CP3. And look where Bradley Beal is (and has been) for years. But regardless, basketball teams are generally improved by adding very good players. The Bulls have done that, and we literally have only three people on our team that were there at the beginning of last season. This is not the Bulls team that people are familiar with—they are an exciting, fast-paced, fun to watch team that makes a real efforts on both ends. They have multiple guaranteed scoring options with some killer perimeter defenders. Our bench isn’t particularly deep, but it is better than bad with a few truly good players and prospects. Again, I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised where we’re at in a few months! Feel free to rub it in my face if I’m wrong."
I had a guy tell me Green’s floor was Zach LaVine.   That remains to be seen. LaVine is a phenomenal player and among the best outcomes for a prospect like Green.   I love JG but he’s undeniably a worse prospect than both Mobley and Cade. I had him in the same tier as Suggs and Barnes.
"Jaylen Green looks like an early Zach Lavine with no consistent jumpshots. Upside are crazy athleticism and elite first step but the weakness are glaring too: shaky handle, slim frame and non existent defence. In three years this may go down as another case of passing Doncic for Bagley"
"Games like the opener are the ones the Bulls did lose last year because they didn't have any supporting cast for Zach.  They had that five-game losing streak in April where they lost to the Wolves, Magic and Grizzlies twice in that span. Not needing a LaVine 30-burger every night is huge.   They were 11th in defensive rating last season while only 19th offensively. The offense is immensely better and they added two perimeter destoyers. They don't need to be an elite team, but this is a very good one and you should be excited about it."
The silhouette of the Dew'd up Zach Lavine playing 2K with a chubby Zion on the couch will become the new NBA logo replacing Jerry West.
I been sayin Bulls are scary and LaVine is lowkey one of the best in the game. Been getting clowned for it harddddd  I hope Them Bulls win 50+ games and Zach get his name in MVP convos so i can take pride in my predictions
"Nikola Vucevic yelled, “There you go!” DeMar DeRozan gave a look of pleasant surprise. Lonzo Ball belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Alex Caruso hit the locker room door, NBA star Zach Lavine hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"Zach LaVine makes his 555th 3-pointer and ties Michael Jordan for #4 career 3-point FGs in Bulls history. Just over 100 to go to tie Scottie Pippen (664) for the 3rd spot. It might take him the rest of the season to take the #1 career spot, held by Kirk Hinrich (1049).   Breaking records even on his down nights."
Zach Lavine... kid is a ball player!
Zach lavine... i need you to have a bad game so my guys can win
Don’t you know that he’s already clearly undeniably better than guys like Devin Booker and Zach Lavine???

"Giannas and Zach lavine are the obvious choices.   Low key sleepers is anthony edwards, mikal bridges, Andrew Wiggins"
Zach Lavine
"spending assets to build around a LaVine entering his prime with complementary players is mortgaging the future?  Zach is the future, baby"
"Zach Lavine. Idk, just don’t like his play style I guess. He also strikes me as a very cocky person, maybe because he’s always smirking"
I went to the game last night and had a huge smile on my face the entire time.  We literally can get away with having Zach Lavine sit in a corner waiting for a 3 AND have him open.  Our defense and ball movement is beautiful. I'm so fucking excited.
* Scottie Barnes ROY * Zach Lavine/Julia Randle Co-MVP * Lakers 9th seed * Celtics miss the playoffs * Miles Bridges MIP * Wes Unseld Jr. COY
Close but nah. Beal just stakes more shots than Lavine. Zach is a better scorer from everywhere on the court.
Zach Lavine is quickly becoming overrated
Harden is easily a better scorer than Zach Lavine imo
Zach LaVine is our James Harden 😢  what's up with the third list?
"I can excuse missing the sarcasm, but this dude definitely needs his morning coffee if he thinks Porzinigis and Wall are on the same level as Zach Lavine."

Zach Lavine is in but all his scores are cut in half. He still wins.
"Zach Lavine, DeMar DeRozan, and Derrick Jones Jr are all on the same team. Doesnt quite fit your criteria, but it's a pretty good mix of players that have won/participated in the dunk contest."
Its honestly close  Jokic  Embiid  Clint Capela  Julius Randle  Jerami Grant  Marcus Smart  Jusef Nurkic  Zach Lavine  Could possibly make an argument for:  Dinwiddie  Bogdan  Jordan Clarkson
https://youtu.be/FJ9pnTcGwxs  Bingo. Lol. Particularly the last 30 seconds or so but the whole vid is good.   Literally the top result for a YouTube search of “Zach Lavine Hornets” lol
That’s the part people are missing. It was absolutely no secret he and Zach Lavine wanted to play together. Lonzo wanted to be on the Bulls and nothing was going to make him stay in NO.
"Just like how Devin Booker, Zach Lavine, KAT, and AD were not good enough a few years back right?"
"I adore every highlight with Stacey getting hyped over it, but in the Zach Lavine era, there’s a grand total of ONE Bulls highlight where I actually prefer the opposing team’s broadcast.   And I think you can probably guess which one I’m talking about lol"
"This year is just like Book's year was last year for Zach. The Bulls were pretty good last year, but not quite a playoff team (partly because Zach caught COVID at the worst possible time and came back and couldnt find his range for a bit).  The year before last, the Suns were not very good, but then they were the Bubble darlings. Then they got CP3 and Ayton matured and they got Jae Crowder and everything fell into place, and they had a very fortunate playoff run. Not taking away from their accomplishment, but that's a fact. I am *not* saying they wouldnt have made the Finals if Jamal Murray / Kawhi / AD/Bron were healthy. I am just saying they took advantage of that.  This year the Bulls are on a similar path so far in terms of... They might not go to the Finals, but they're a really, really damn good team with a ton of weapons and options, and Zach and DeMar are clearly the head of the spear, just as Book and CP3 are for the Suns. Vuc+Caruso+Lonzo makes for a really good supporting cast around those two, just as the Suns supporting cast works really well for CP3/Book.   If you just compare the stats head to head it's really not that close between LaVine and Book, and Book did nothing before CP3 arrived in PHX.  Last year:  Player A: 27, 5, and 5 on 51/42/85, .8 steals, .5 blocks.  Player B: 26, 4, and 4 on 48/34/87, .8 steals, .2 blocks.  this year:  Player A: 25, 5, 4 on 48/39/87, .5 steals, .3 blocks.  Player B: 24, 5, 4 on 45/41/85, 1 steal, .3 blocks.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Player A is Zach. Objectively the better shooter/scorer, objectively the better athlete. His team was worse last year but he was the better player."
Zach LaVine &gt; Book
"Zach LaVine. Maybe Booker but I think Zach is better. Better shooter from most areas, better athlete, better passer."
"&gt; screw zach lavine for going up for a dunk   he was fine dribbling it out until the hornets started pressing him lmfao, he only attacked when the hornets showed they were still trying to play   &gt; i am glad kelly went up and clattered him   being glad your team dangerously fouls a player with 0 chance of blocking the shot 😍😍😍😍  is there any other franchise in the nba owned by two bulls shooting guards? y’all got jordan and lavine as your owners kinda cool imo"
The refs tried their best to ruin the game for both fans smh    Also screw Zach lavine for going up for a dunk while up 14 with less than a minute left and it’s clear the game is dead. I am glad Kelly went up and clattered him. Shit play  Also Cody Martin please come back
"Zach ""Suck a fuck, block this bitch"" LaVine"
Zach Lavine for the guard
zach lavine sorta fits in the first as well
2 words.   Zach Lavine   Mans a complete beast but been playing on a questionable bulls team. I think w the recent additions were gonna see a lot more appreciation for the guy.
Zach Lavine is just really cool
Zach Lavine is lowkey one of my favorite players
Zach LaVine is who Jayson Tatum thinks he is.
Zach Lavine feels your pain too
"Literally nobody claimed we were only good because of hardens passing.. what? The guy you replied to already said Chris Paul is the better passer. I don’t even know what you’re arguing  The rockets didn’t have a reliable secondary ball handler besides the short period chris was healthy. It was all harden. To imply his passing “isn’t remotely the reason we were that good” is fucking hilarious, plop Bradley Beal or Zach Lavine into that role and tell me hardens passing didn’t mean much   He ran point for a full season and put up 29/8/11 in houston and then in Brooklyn he put up 25/9/11 last year. I don’t know why you’re using this season as your only example lol?   Also, yes, Chris Paul is the more efficient playmaker, but not all turnovers are from passes. Peak harden was also giving you 30+ with those 10+ assists so 4-5 turnovers is justified"

"We have Zach Lavine and Demar DeRozen, get to midrange draw the double and find the open man . If they don’t double score 50+ .   Put derozen or Caruso as primary ball handler, Zach , coby, vuch and the next best  big shooter we have out there 5 out, fill the hashes and corners and work whatever weak part of the zone there is ( top elbows for 2-3 corners for 3-2 etc) have derozen or Caruso attack the paint or midrange until they are forced to help   Or run the offense thru vuch let him eat until they double team and extra 2-3 passes and wide open 3s .   I could Litterally tell you maybe 10 ways to beat regular zones with the bulls roster .   I get your point but this team and or basically all NBA teams don’t have excuses when they can all shoot and are professionals that are supposed to have more basketball knowledge then some random guy on Reddit lmao"
"It goes both ways, Bulls drew some charges too. I noticed Zach Lavine sometimes clears out/ pushes off on drives. Not always easy to establish position and get hammered."
"There were a few bad calls but regardless zach lavine has to be better,derozan took ill advised 3s ,vucevic still isn't good enough and the bulls 3pt defense continues to be a problem for us,overall good game congratulations to the heat for getting the win"
Zach Lavine and Devin Booker
"It’s about accumulation of Playoffs experience you bozo. Finals or not, it’s about the body of work of battle tested in Playoffs. Lowry, Butler, Tucker, Spolestra been thru way more than the likes of Derozan, Lavine, Lonzo, Caruso and Billy Donovan.. that’s my point  Also don’t even bring the Bucks into this. They have multiple All Star caliber players and they have a multiple MVP. Can’t fucking compare last year Bucks to this year Bulls.  Giannis himself gone thru multiple years of Playoffs before he breaks thru and so did Middleton and Holiday and Brook Lopez and they had PJ Tucker, Zach Lavine has never even sniffed the Playoffs yet, same with Lonzo, Vucevic had a handful of Playoffs series maybe 2? Or 3? DeMar a choker. Can’t compare that"
Zach LaVine.
"James Harden,Bradley Beal,Zach Lavine and Deandre Ayton  You never said realistic"
lonzo ball   zach lavine   demar   caruso   vucevic
zach lavine is really good though
"Here's the thing: Jaylen Brown can be the 2nd best player on a title team. Jayson Tatum has the allure of a star, but is really a hyped up Zach LaVine."
"His athleticism is obviously exciting, incredible athlete who’s so elastic and explosive.   However, Zach lavine is also an incredible athlete and is nowhere near being a top 10 player.   I’m looking at his feel for the game, which doesn’t seem to be amazing. I doubt he’ll ever be an elite playmaker or defender, which will limit his impact moving forward.  Again these are projections and I could be so off, but I see more Zach lavine/Bradley Beal in his game than I’d like to see from a guy people want to project as the best of his class. And that isn’t a guy you can win with as the best player on a team unless you’re stacked from 2-7."
"Having watched both teams as a neutral, green doesn’t show half the Iq that Cunningham does imo.   If cades jumper continues to be poor all season, then I’d start getting worried next year, but he shows a really good feel for the game on par with mobley and Barnes (if not more than Barnes imo).   Green on the other hand doesn’t excite me as much. I think this draft class would have to severely underperform for him to be the best player from it - because he seems to be of that Zach lavine mould of a future elite scorer who doesn’t bring much else to the table, let alone letting him be the offensive engine to a contender."
Well no we haven’t because we traded fucking Zach LaVine and a better draft pick for him before he forced his way out
"fuck zach lavine, marry donavan, kill dbook  edit: I read the entire post but my gay subconscious seemed to take over"
"I don't tolerate any Donovan slander  Start Zach, bench book, cut Spida  Only because I think the first two have more to prove right now with Lavine having a breakthrough season and Book wanting to maintain his position as a budding superstar."
"It's really not close. Don's best season is worse than Lavine and Books average season and Dons been a worse defender in high stakes situations than both Book and Zach. No matter who's starting or on the bench, Mitchell is getting cut."
He’s been a lot better recently.  Definitely has realistic Zach Lavine potential and if he reaches his ceiling he will be even better.
/u/visible-top-4977 :  &gt; Well I think Zach lavine is better than giannis so we will see  Only the dumbest fish will bite on this
"Zach Lavine, signed 4 year offer sheet with Kings, now in his last year with the Bulls, seems pretty dedicated to re-signing this summer"
"Fully agree Zach Lavine can shoot and score inside, and Giannis doesn't even guard the other teams best player. Plus the bulls are the three seed, bucks aren't even top 5."
Well I think Zach lavine is better than giannis so we will see
"He didn't say that the unanimous MVP was one of the best accomplishments of all time. He said that the season i.e. Curry's performance was one of the best accomplishments of all time.  You are just factually wrong that Jordan's 1988 season is ""miles better"" than Curry's 2016. Statistically they are roughly comparable (basically nuclear offensive seasons with Jordan being a better defender with DPOY and Curry being a more efficient scorer with the probably the most efficient scoring in a season from a guard ever), but Jordan led his team to 50 wins while Curry led his to the most wins ever in NBA history.   Both seasons (Jordan's and Curry's) are better than any season that Big O ever put up, and both were just preludes to their sustained greatness playing at the same level year after year, which is part of the reason why it's already reasonable to acknowledge that Curry is better than Oscar.  By the way, would you like to know what the top all time highest true shooting percentages are in a single season by a guard who scored at least 25 points per game (i.e. who have been the most efficient guards who carried the primary scoring loads for their team)? They are:  1. Steph Curry, 2017-18, 67.5% TS 2. Steph Curry, 2015-16, 66.9% TS 3. Steph Curry, 2020-21, 65.5% TS 4. Steph Curry, 2018-2019, 64.1% TS 5. Zach LaVine, 2020-21, 63.4% TS  When you score more points per attempt than your opponent, then you usually win games. No guard in history has been better at this than Steph."
Classic trap game against an exasperated rockets who were playing with a lot of intensity.   Coach Silas made adjustment from running a 2 big lineup with 2 non shooters starting to starting Wood at the 5 for the first time this season and we looked like a different team tbh. Zach Lavine scares me when he has the ball
What do you mean...Zach Lavine and Bradley Beal..who are known for all defensive type of defense.  Dame and Steph will be building another Empire state with all those bricks smh.  I'll be surprised if they even get 5 shots off.
Zach LaVine should be the 3rd team guard over CP3

"&gt;They maxed wiggins, who was playing like shit, over Butler, who brought them to the playoffs.  Don't spout shit when you think you know shit and are just blatantly wrong.   [They traded for Jimmy in June of 2017.](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2646262-jimmy-butler-traded-to-timberwolves-for-zach-lavine-kris-dunn-no-7-pick.amp.html)  [They agreed to max Wiggins in October of 2017.](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2722896-andrew-wiggins-timberwolves-agree-to-5-year-148-million-contract-extension.amp.html)  [They offered Butler the max the next summer of 2018.

Look at the timeline. Wolves maxed Wiggins Oct. 11, 2017 and the season started October 17. Jimmy hadn't even played a SINGLE minute in a Wolves uniform when they maxed Wiggins, guy.  Get your facts straight."
"I'm obviously biased but neither Tatum nor Brown would have ever sniffed the playoffs if they played on the same teams Zach has had to. Maybe in Minnesota with KAT but that was obviously cut short due to injury. You say they've won 5 playoff series, but DeRozan who has won 4 playoff series in the span of 3 years sucks in the playoff. DeRozan has a 22-22 record in the playoffs as the best player on his team against non-LeBron led teams. So it's really just not true that he's sucked.  Meanwhile Tatum and Brown have had a better supporting cast than either Zach or DeMar have had their entire careers, and now we're seeing what Boston looks like now that their team isn't all that great on paper. And now that LaVine and DeRozan have a solid supporting cast they're obviously playing up to their potential.  At the end of the day, I think most people would (and should) pick Tatum/Brown because of their perceived potential. But that's also assuming there's substantial growth to be had, because in my biased opinion LaVine and DeRozan are clearly the better duo and both in the MVP convo for good reason. But I don't blame you for picking your guys either, everyone wants their players to succeed."
"DeMar ""[Dubious Starter](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-player-projections/demar-derozan/)"" Derozen and Zach ""[Average Starter](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-player-projections/zach-lavine/)"" Lavine."
"It will be interesting to see where Zach Lavine ends up, I could see the nets trading for him if Kyrie leaves."
Anthony Edwards’ dunk last year was pretty crazy: https://youtu.be/iODDxjp936A  Zach Lavine had a 360 dunk last week: https://youtu.be/l_EwrGCvtwc
"right now? James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joel Embiid, Devin Booker, Anthony Davis, Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal,  Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, Karl Anthony Towns, arguably Demar Derozan"
"Nothing but the truth from Caruso. Lakers need to humble down.  Lakers as a whole are stuck in a shell, everything is about themselves in that shell. I usually check the comments after the Bulls' games on this subreddit, when Caruso or/and Zo had a decent game, the comments are filled with Laker flairs telling how great Caruso(again, and/or Zo) is and how much they miss him and meanwhile, Zach&amp;Deebo dropped 30 casually.  And when the Lakers game came, Caruso didn't score a single point(while still being so efficient) so I wondered what would comments look like. It was about nothing but the Lakers from Laker flairs. It's either ""Bron out doesn't count"" or ""Davis ejected doesn't count"" or ""Does count but THT good"". Even their respects were shit and full of LA ego like ""DeRozan? Compton."", ""Lavine? UCLA."" ""The coach that outplayed your team? Who?""."
"That insane comeback in Charlotte led by Zach LaVine and his 49 points. I lost my shit when Zach won the game at the buzzer after all that. Dude gave no fucks, didn’t wanna go for the tie just said fuck it I either win right now or I go home"
"The absolute leg strength he showed in the last shot is bananas. Jumping away from the hoop but he still rises up as cashes it in. Fucking incredible shot.  But about the previous game, why did Boylen bench Lavine and was it for the whole game? Like did he just tell Zach to not suit up at all even though he was healthy? That seems like an insane coaching decision lol."
"Zach LaVine has beautiful lips  EDIT: ok wait i thought it said ""prettiest take""..."
Probably not  Especially if he also got Zach Lavine like he wanted lol  Fucking twilight zone over here
"That's A reason but it's not THE reason. It's fair to wish for your team to luck into a #1 pick to instantly turn things around but let's not act like it's impossible to build a decent franchise without one.  Brooklyn was a laughing stock for giving away a generation of picks and yet (even before KD and Kyrie signed) they managed to turn the franchise around by signing a quality coach and developing a bunch of role players into a 42-40 team.  The Jazz went from a 25-57 team to a perennial contender in the west by building around Hayward, Gobert, Mitchell and Ingles, none of whom were drafted higher than 9th overall, and hiring a good coach (Snyder). They didn't have a top draft pick nor did they sign any major FAs to turn the franchise around.  The Bulls went from 11th in the east a year ago to 2nd right now by surrounding Zach LaVine (a player r/nba has clowned for not being a winner for years) with players with talent and playoff experience that other teams didn't want. Arguably they overpaid for Vucevic, DeRozan, Caruso and Ball but those overpays, along with hiring a decent coach in Billy Donovan, have taken Chicago from 22-43 two years ago to 12-6 this year.  None of those teams had a #1 pick. None of them had a LeBron choose to sign with a crap team for nostalgia. The best player on the Nets was Russell who the Lakers gave away in a salary dump. The Jazz got Hayward 9th overall. Chicago got LaVine as a consolation prize in the Butler trade after they couldn't get Wiggins.  If those teams can do it, there's no excuse for the Kings to have been consistently terrible for 16+ years."
"DD never had Zach Lavine level player with the Raps. So I'm willing to go out on a limb and say Bulls will be fine if DD reverts back to playoff DD.   They can be 1a and 1b options scoring wise (or have Zach as 1 and DD as option 2), which puts a lot of pressure off DD."

"Ja small smaller guys, Zach Lavine for mid size and Giannis for big guys"
"&gt;Zach Lavine averaged 27 ppg last season on 50/40/90 and 67% TS. Only other players to do that in NBA history are Durant, Curry, and Larry Bird.  This just isn't true lol. He didn't average 50/40/90 and his actual TS% was 63%. Why the fuck are you lying about his stats?  &gt;The only guy you listed who avg more ppg this season than Lavine is Giannis. Who cannot create for himself or shoot the three ball better than Lavine.  Giannis does create for himself lmfao. What are you on about. You ever seen that man drive to the basket? Also fuck 3-point shooting lol. Giannis requires 2x the defensive attention of Lavine. Call me when Lavine drops 50 in the finals.  Jokic is also easily a better scorer than Lavine. Jokic scores 40 points per 100 possession compared to Lavines 36.6 AND is 7% more efficient than Lavine.  And like I said, Embiid will also overtake him once he starts playing again. He averaged 44 points per 100 on 64%. All-time shit.  Also shout out to Zion &amp; Kawhi for being injured.  So no Lavine is really not a top 5 scorer."
"Definitely not...curry, giannis, dame, Luca, jokic, kd....some others I like, embiid, Zach lavine..."
Zach Lavine. Body control and balance are insane
I feel like if you had to pick one nba player to compete in every sport it would be giannis. Maybe zach lavine or ja if you were concerned about his size
"Zach Lavine averaged 27 ppg last season on 50/40/90 and 67% TS.  Before last nights game he was 4th in ppg and within the top 10 ppg players he was 3rd in TS. Like I said, underrated. He’s got a serious argument for 3rd best scorer in the league. He’s the best scorer at all three levels beyond Curry and Durant.   And you are making this about superstar. I specified scoring. Zach is without a doubt a top 5 scorer in the league. Serious argument for 3rd behind Curry and Durant"
"In what world is Lavine a better scorer than Giannis or Jokíc? Embiid is also pretty much garuanteed to overtake him once he comes back.  Scoring is also the only thing Zach does at a star level. All the true superstars are great at other things besides scoring.  They play great defence (e.g. Giannis, Embiid) or are star playmakers (e.g. Curry, Jokic). You have to be a true all-time great to be a superstar on just scoring alone."

"I don't follow the Kings much but as a Bulls fan I can say they had foresight in trying to sign Zach Lavine in RFA. Of course the Bulls ended up matching.  Right now that contract seems like a no-brainer, but at the time was seen by many as an overpay. We have learned in the years since that they were right to go after him!"
I wish Zach Lavine would be reffed like how the all-star Kemba Walker is reffed
Zach Lavine is such a beautiful man. Wow.
Um I know it doesn't really matter but is Zach Lavine white?
Zach Lavine genuinely gets more fired up and aggressive when he’s pissed off at the refs vs anything else.  Love it
People who put up stats on non winning teams because it’s easy to blame them for losses  Bobby Portis  Zach Lavine  Devin Booker  Dwight   Wiggins  TJ Warren
"Puts up good stats but doesn’t win, so people think the player isn’t that good   Most of the time though it’s just the team around said player is that bad. Examples being trae Young and Zach Lavine"
"He’s quite literally the only star nba player that plays off ball other than PG13. Then you have to get down to like Zach Lavine, Kris Middleton to find really good players that consistently play off ball."
"That’s a good thread. Some of my favourites:  &gt;Or we can just play the waiting game instead of throwing 20 mil a year at a recently injured guard whose ceiling is what, fourth best player on a championship team, maybe?   &gt;I would much rather have Smart than Lavine.  Not even close.  &gt;DO NOT MATCH THAT OFFER, CHICAGO. You can find another damned one-dimensional shooting guard for less money than that. I like watching Zach play, he's fast and can jump really high. He also can't defend, or pass, or otherwise show any kind of on-court awareness. Let him go.  &gt;For the love of god please do not match this Garpax  &gt;Why the fuck would you offer that and how fucking stupid do you have to be to match it? Zach is a decent player but a $20 mil a year player? That's one of those classic awful contracts.  &gt;Bulls match this and you no longer have to worry about them. Lavine isn't good and there isn't a single metric that says otherwise.  &gt;I'd let him walk. He's not that good and chances are slim he suddenly becomes a much smarter player... or his knees magically get better. Dude is 23 and seems to have issues with his knees and he's a guy living of his athleticism. Worst case scenario he's a less talented Derrick Rose who will be hampered by injuries. He hasn't played 82 games in two seasons combined lately… Also, his numbers just aren't outstanding in any way. I don't know what you expect to win with him being paid 20 mil on your roster. To me, he's a 10 mil SG, getting you athleticism off the bench for some 20 minutes or so. Could hype guys up with some nasty dunk and shit, but 20 mil? No way, not if you wanna win."
Zach Lavine is putting up 27/6/4 on almost 50/40/90 efficiency for less than $20M/Yr.
Zach Lavine
"Why are we calling Harden a point guard in this but both Zach Lavine and Demar Derozan, on the same team, are shooting guards"
"Zach Lavine can be a #1 player on a Finals contending team.  I really like Zach's game but I was not quite sure if he was better off as a #2 option behind a legit super star like Giannis or Embiid or if he actually belonged in that class of player on his own right.  The change in roster helped cement the feeling that the Bulls are Zach's team and his play, particularly on the defensive end, has assuaged a lot of my concerns about his super star potential."
"Herb is the man. Never seen a rookie get the defensive assignments he does. He's guarding Trae Young, Paul George, Zach Lavine, Julius Randle.  In the hilarious stat category: The 3-14 Pelicans are +37 in Herb's 349 minutes. No other player on the team has a positive plus minus"
"Zach “The Catheter” LaVine  I dunno guys… I think that’s a piss poor nickname, but in this context…"
"People consistently get this wrong about Lamelo. Everyone thinks he dominates the ball, but no, he doesn’t. His usage is around 26% which is the same as Jordan Poole and averages about 4 seconds per touch which is the same as Zach Lavine. He completely plays within the offense.   So he would be able to do his thing in Minnesota, especially so having a big man as talented as KAT where he can consistently pick n pop with or set him up for rim attacks, and he would look amazing in Golden State where he could also be a back door cutter or set Steph and Draymond up for those same looks (he also plays well off ball).   This kid is versatile and flexible and he shares the ball which bodes well for him wherever he would’ve landed. He would’ve been the same player or even better in both situations. Watch his games and that becomes evident."
"&gt;	 He doesn’t do windmills and shit like LaVine (although he has at least a couple of times) but he’s got guys like that beat by an absolute country mile on volume and degree of difficulty.    This is legitimately one of, if not the worst, take I’ve ever seen on this subreddit.   For one, Zach has had a higher volume of dunks than Lebron for at least 3 seasons.    Degree of difficulty argument almost makes me think you’re trolling bc Lebron takes some of the least difficult vanilla dunks there are, how is the degree of difficult for that higher than a windmill or 360? That’s just flat out an absurd claim.   Second Lebron has Zach beat by 4 inches in height &amp; wingspan &amp; 50 lbs in weight. In what world are dunks harder for a guy whose taller, stronger &amp; has longer arms? That is a patently absurd claim that defies basic logic to simp for Lebron."
Zach Lavine was interested in championships at a very young age

"No zach lavine isn't injury prone, far as I know the only injuries he's had was his acl in 2017 and the thumb injury he is currently dealing with"
Zach Lavine went off
He’s the best scorer on the team lol. Demar is great but Zach is playing with a torn thumb. He’s 4th in the league in ppg and 2nd in the league in TS%.  Lavine has a strong case for top three scorer in the league behind Durant and Curry
Zach lavine year to year improvement on offensive end does not talk about enough
"The game looked visually pleasing to watch. Crisp red jerseys against crisp blue jerseys just looked nice.   Also, tough shot? Doesnt matter — zach lavine."

I would buy Zach LaVine vs Aaron Gordon dunk rematch on PPV.
Zach Lavine? The one who has played for 1 team with over 30 wins? And Lowry played in fucking Canada and took his team to the playoffs every year. And his contract is expiring. You could possibly resign him for less
Nugs not saying no to a perennial All Star in Zach Lavine
"Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Zach LaVine, Michael Porter Jr, Sabonis, Bam Adebayo, SGA all picked past 10. Nowadays with all the young talent coming in, drafts are deep. This isn’t 2001"
We've got the same thing going with LaVine. We have 4 super close losses and I think he's missed a last possession shot in 3 of them. Most Bulls fans aren't really holding it against him though like what might happen with Siakam because Zach has been so good elsewise.
We need a go to scorer. Bradley Beal or Zach LaVine would elevate this team so much.
"I'm 6'4"" without shoes. That means I am taller than...  - Steph Curry - Kyrie Irving - Russell Westbrook - Donovan Mitchell - John Wall - Kemba Walker - Kyle Lowry - Fred VanVleet  ... among others, and three inches or less shorter than:  - Kawhi Leonard - Jimmy Butler - DeMar DeRozan - Zach LaVine - OG Anunoby - Draymond Green  - Klay Thompson  ... yet I am the complete opposite of an athlete lol"
"I mean we dont draft well , thats the main problem.  KAT and Zach Lavine are the only 2 picks in the last decade I can say were solid picks.  And we traded Lavine away after 2 years"
"Don’t bother posting here haha. R/nba just shitting on clippers. Sorry, but Zach Lavine and Steph are two of the best scorers in the league and if they are hot and making contested threes off the bounce, then no defense is stopping that. Bulls were amazing on offense yesterday (if you watched they were making contested floaters, threes and tough shots) and Clippers still won.  They switched their lineup to remove playing three defensive liabilities at once (RJ, Luke, and Lou) and are only playing one now. Also, Kawhi is averaging career high in 3pt% and assists. But hey, it’s cool to shit on the clippers."
"Uhh you're really saying DLO is on the same level as multi time all stars?  Even though he is much more inefficient?  Ja Morant is better, healthy john wall, Zach Lavine, Jamal Murray, Malcom Brogdon. Sorry bro DLO is like 20-30 range for starting PGs.  He is not worth that contract in any way."
Basically any iso scorer in the league KD Kawhi Cj Trae Zach Lavine Caris Levert

"Zach ""Despite the Loss"" LaVine"
"&gt; I wanted to draft him back then and was so glad he was traded to us.  Same man. It was the meme between me and my friend who I always used to play MyLeague with, I'd be the Bulls in our files and I'd always end up trading for LaVine somehow in like 2k15 because I like him so much  When we traded Butler i was hanging out with him that night and i was basically an inconsolable mess, but when I heard the return was Zach LaVine I was like ""HOLY SHIT"""
"i love lavine but he’s not close to a superstar unless there are 15+ superstars in the league (and there aren’t)   i think a good rule of thumb is asking if a casual fan would know his name (lebron, curry, durant the easiest examples). for zach i say no"
Yup look at Zach Lavine
"Idk, he's not super pretty but I think he's pretty good looking next to either of Paul George or Zach LaVine lmfao"
"&gt;Despite the loss, Zach LaVine...  His Bulls career in a nutshell"
If people who are actually good like Zach Lavine and Brad Beal are missing out on all star selections there's no way Jerami Grant gets selected either
"To be fair, you lost you $1000, not Zach Lavine."
who y'all taking: Zach LaVine or Ben Simmons?
"Zach ""Despite the loss"" Lavine"
"""because of Zach Lavine putting up 32+""  FTFY OP.  The mans should not be the primary scorer.  But ain't no one else gonna help on this team.  Edit: at least we still have the cubbies HAHAHAHA JUST KIDDING A WILD RICKETTS APPEARS. kill me."
Hope they start winning games. I don’t want him to become a Zach Lavine or Bradley Beal type where he puts up a show but it all gets wasted with no postseason appearances.
"Alright, but what about a Michael Jordan face inside a Zach Lavine on a Jordan crying face"
I was telling everyone that I would throw the max at Zach Lavine and everyone called me crazy.

Great defence from Paul George against Zach Lavine there. He's been incredible this season. I really hope he can keep this up in the playoffs.
"Y’all better stop sleeping on Zach Lavine, dude has take a BIG step this season"
I always just believed the Zach Lavine is an empty stat padder narrative. Even Zach Lowe and other respectable nba people have spread it. I never watched enough Bulls games to form my own opinion but this season I did.  He looks like an absolute stud. Is this another case of light skinned player hate?

"Last season had a lot of players make it for the first time, it seems unlikely to have a bunch more again  But actually projecting, not just based on season so far  West:   Projected: None  Contenders: CJ McCollum, Zion, Murray, Wood  CJ has been playing really well, but I'm not highly confident that at 29 he'll suddenly maintain the kind of shooting he's had so far. Zion has been playing well, but will need to be even better to have a chance, especially with Ingram on his team. Murray has also been playing really well, but guards have a lot of competition and I'm just not sure if it's enough, especially with another better all-star player on his team. Wood has the numbers, and if Harden leaves he has a good chance, but if he's still there I wouldn't bet on it   East:   Projected: Jaylen Brown, Malcolm Brogdon  Jaylen is playing fantastically, and without Kemba I think he'll get a lot of credit. Brogdon is also playing very well on the new Pacers, who are also playing very well. Jaylen is a much more clear pick than Brogdon  Contenders: Julius Randle, Zach Lavine, Jerami Grant  I think all three (especially Randle) are playing above their weight at the moment, the Knicks won't maintain anything like the 6th seed, and the Pistons suck. But it is the east and there seem like clear spots to be won, and they all have great 3 number splits so I could easily see at least one of them getting a spot"
"Actually yeah that makes sense, because then we can do this:  - Bradley Beal - Jrue Holiday - Klay Thompson - DeMar DeRozan - James Harden - Zach LaVine"
Zach LaVine
SG is pretty loaded tbh  - James Harden - Bradley Beal - Klay Thompson - DeMar DeRozan - ??? - Zach LaVine  No idea who'd play the 5 though.
Incoming 50 point + game winner from Zach Lavine
"Harrell actually played great last night defensively. Wendell eating was more a result of doubling/ trapping Zach Lavine because he was cooking, leaving Wendell vs a smaller weak side rotation defender."
"It's pretty crazy how Harrell and Gasol can only be used depending on the matchup. Marc was getting cooked by Chicago's undersized athletic big men while Harrell was able to hold his own, but when the Lakers are going against traditional, lumbering 5s, Harrell can't seem to stay on the floor while Marc knows how to exploit their weaknesses.  Also, Zach Lavine is so good, and he just keeps getting better every season. Chicago needs to figure out how to build around him, before he leaves for greener pastures."
"same reason they don't care about zach lavine, etc (obviously beal is better). fantastic offensive player on a bad team. he would get respect if his team won, but his team doesn't win."
"This guy looks like the best player on the bulls next to Zach lavine for some years to come, in the games I've seen from him this season anyway"
Is there a way to select a video's poster screen? Cos the title says Zach Lavine but it shows Wesley Matthews.

Read the thread. We were talking about Zach Lavine. Getting defensive for no reason.

"2014 in hindsight turned to be such a dud class, the ONLY lottery pick that turned into an All-Star 6 years on was Joel Embiid (who missed his first 2 seasons). The other All-Star in that class was some fat Serbian kid taken in the 2nd round.  The best player not named Embiid taken in the lottery is either one of Marcus Smart, Zach Lavine, TJ Warren or Julius Randle.   The rest have been varying degrees of underwhelming (Wiggins, Gordon, Payton, McDermott), ruined by injuries (Parker, Exum) or straight-up out of the league (Stauskas, Vonleh)"
I started watching during the Roy era in Portland and 10+ years later it was the worse decision I’ve made. And would like to mention this team is currently fucking with my mental health. Zach Lavine go fuck yourself.
I think Zach Lavine could do it.  He had 21 in the first quarter the other day and his offensive game is diverse enough that he doesn’t have to rely on just one way of scoring.
Dont forget Zach Lavine
"Im not gonna lie, it’ll take a while for them to regain form - but they will! ACL injuries aren’t what they used to be, look at Zach Lavine. As a spurs fan that dealt with Dejounte’s ACL tear, it was frustrating to lose him for the year and see him struggle at times last year but he looks great so far this year. It’ll be a bumpy road but you still have 2 great talents on your squad, and you’ll continue to have them once they’re healthy again."
"2014 is one of the weirdest drafts Ive seen yes it got wildly hyped and tbh the top 10 is one of the worst we've had looking back in many years. You can make a legitimate case the non lottery picks from that year are a better collection of players than the lottery   lottery: Embiid, Aaron Gordon, Wiggins, Jabari, Saric, Zach LaVine, Marcus Smart, Julius Randle, Exum, McDermott   non lottery: Nurkic, TJ Warren, Jokic, Jerami Grant, Spencer Dinwiddie, Gary Harris, Clint Capela, Kyle Anderson, Rodney Hood, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Joe Harris, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson"
One is a hall of famer and the other is Zach Lavine.
"A buddy of mine who owns a restaurant out in Chicago said Zach Lavine is a regular. He comes in with his fiancé and they’re always so down to earth. He really is a great example for these young guys coming out of college, he even goes out of his way to take some kids from less fortunate areas out to eat around town. Apparently the biggest lesson he teaches those young kids is how to post up the waiters as they walk by and fadeaway meatballs into women’s cleavage."

Zach LaVine
Chicago Bulls and Charlotte Hornets with a great game from Zach Lavine but the picture is Kawhi?
"I know it sounds like a homer call now, but as one of the poor souls that watches nearly every Bulls game, it’s extremely clear that this Zach LaVine is not the same player from before the bubble. I know you’re a little shook right now but I don’t hold it against you since you clearly haven’t watched him dribble a basketball since 2019. Just be prepared to clean up your comment history by the end of the season.."
Zach Lavine is averaging 27 ppg on 64% TS and no one cares
"Sure, he could be a good role player, but his stats (and like you said contract) are way different than his actual value on a basketball floor.  He suffers from the Zach Lavine or Andrew Wiggins affect where his contract dictates that he should be a first option, but he’s more of a good third option and his contract gets in the way of fulfilling this."
Zach Lavine is that mf dude
Zach Lavine.
Zach Lavine
"Ingles had double digit assists 4 times last season. Conley has done it twice this season. Mitchell has done it once over 3+ seasons. He has the ball all the time. It shouldn't just be ignored; he clearly isn't good at (or chooses not to), setting teammates up. Ingles had an assist rate more than double Donovan's last year. He gets assists at a rate similar to Zach LaVine or KAT.  The jazz offense doesn't have a high usage scorer when Clarkson is off the floor, and Mitchell thrives in that role, but he isn't doing much else at a high level.   Obviously stats aren't the whole story, but he was 60th in PER last year despite having an efficient, high usage game that PER usually likes, and he was 197th in RPM. He shouldn't be considered a superstar unless scoring is all that matters."
"The question didn't make much sense, but their discussion was based on Donovan mostly being a scorer and not affecting the game in other ways, e.g. he only bas 1 career double digit assist game and 1 career double digit rebounding game.  I think there is some truth to this. He is currently 168th in the NBA in assist rate, even below Zach LaVine. He actually has improved a bit compared to previous years. Last year he was 185th.  Usually superstars have more than one high level NBA skill."
"Players near that level that dont seem guaranteed to stay on their team are  Zach Lavine &amp; Bradley Beal  \---  Some ""big names"" that may move:  John Collins  Kyle Lowry  Victor Oladipo  Lonzo Ball  Marvin Bagley        \---  No major issue/fit, but could see teams asking about;  Lamarcus Aldridge  Devin Booker  Pascal Siakam  Buddy Hield  \---       Doubtful, but could see being surprising moves given team outlooks of assets/health/success:  KAT  Curry/Klay"
"I'm surprised this is regarded as news. Why would anyone trade a player at this point in their career, where there is little to no doubt that he'll improve on one side but is still underrated by many and therefore is ""worth"" much less than his true potential value? In a years time we'll be talking about all-star Zach LaVine and hopefully some of his teammates keep developing, and with the right FO moves the Bulls could finally make decent run in the playoffs. Then trade talks could begin."
"You obviously don’t/haven’t watched our games if you think we havent made any progress anywhere. “Everyone’s watching LaVine score and likely hurt Coby’s development” lol LaVine scores a lot because he’s a good scorer and that’s his role. I don’t see how he’s hurting his development, it’s not like Zach is some black hole who just shoots and does nothing else. He plays defense, grabs boards and distributes as well"
"We're in the ""figuring how to close out games"" stage of the rebuild rn  Zach LaVine needs some respek put on his name. Also, Lauri returning to form (aka not being forced to be a spot-up shooter) is big.  Billy Donovan is a godsend compared to Jim Boylen.  Patrick Williams is a dark horse ROTY candidate"

"Who said the player next to you had to be better - they just need to be competent. Look at all the top scoring guards I mentioned - they all have allstar teammates. Look at the Bulls roster - youngest starting lineup in NBA with no allstars, let alone players that complement Zach on both ends of floor.   Lavine is def a star, at least based on NBA fans' qualifications. The guy has been putting up top 10 scoring numbers over the last 2 seasons at pretty nice efficiency. He was 4th in unassisted 3pt% last season (39.9%). The 4 others in the top 5 were Tatum, Lillard, Paul George, and CP3. In terms of skilled scoring, Zach is a star"
"the problem with this argument is that a player's contract is an inescapable reality and it's very much tied to ""empty stats."" If you put Zach Lavine and his contract on the Lakers, what are you taking off? That version of the team is certainly worse than the current version because you're inevitably removing crucial defense and depth for added scoring, which the Lakers don't need. they have *more efficient* offensive options already on the team. This is the problem with Lavine. He can't be a third option. The only very good skill he has - volume scoring - combined with his huge contract necessitates that he be the first option. And that's why the Bulls just aren't going to be very good with him on the team unless they hit draft gold."
Zach Lavine
"On a championship team, include the full quote.  He’s the first option on this utah team which isn’t a real championship contender, like Zach Lavine is the first option on the bulls but if he went to a team like the nets or lakers who are championship contenders he’s third or fourth option."

"Lmao.   You know people can enjoy watching individual players and have favorite teams at the same team, right? I watch almost every game throughout the regular season with favorite players across the board — Trae, Giannis, Luka, Mitchell, LeBron, Lillard, Zach Lavine, shit, I have a favorite player on each team but that doesn't mean I'm bandwagoning other teams, he can still be a die-hard Nets fan and enjoy watching basketball, this shit is dumb.   I'll never understand those that criticize people for **enjoying basketball** even if it's a team they dislike. I fucking hate the Warriors, but you can bet I'm going to watch Steph jack up shots from the logo because it's beautiful basketball, hell, I even admired their talent and organic building (before KD) and despite being pissed, respected the talent across the board despite our injuries before we got the chip. Same with Lillard and his shooting. I hate the Clippers, dislike Kawhi, but still watch him and root for PG every night because I like a competitive league and want to see the Lakers and them battle it out. Even with the Nets being stupid stacked and me not fucking with Kyrie for how he handled his business in Cleveland and Boston, I still hope to see him have a successful career, also hope to see Harden get a ring even if it means it takes from LeBron's accomplishments (who is my favorite player since I've been a Cavs fan for 25 years, because the dude deserves it. What the hell is with people dropping *bandwagon* every chance they get like they're superior for being deeply invested in one team? Why not be deeply invested in basketball generally?  Fuck off with your bullshit man."
"For me, it might be Zach Lavine"
Empty stats for the most part. Do you also think Zach Lavine is better than prime Kobe because he's averaging 27 ppg on 50% shooting?
All I know is Zach LaVine is an All Star and should’ve been one last year too.
"Early 2000s pace was slow as fuck, like the 2001 Lakers played at a 91.7 pace which put them about middle of the pack back then. The fastest-paced team was the Pistons who played at a 94.7 pace.   The current slowest team in the league pace-wise, the Knicks at 96.0, would probably be considered a run-and-gun team 20 years back.  Looking at points per 100 possessions (to help equalize the pace factor), between 2000-2005 Kobe scored about 33-37ish points per 100 poss. Thats about the same as what Zach Lavine is currently doing per 100 possessions (35 points). So players are scoring at the same rate as they have always been, just deflated by the slow pace for the 2001 guys.  The increase of 3pt shooting is directly related to the increased efficiency of scoring compare to back then, the early 2000s had so many long 2s being taken it would give Daryl Morey an aneurysm. I highly doubt efficiency would drop by much considered the increased skill level at shooting 3s"
oh my god Zach Lavine has been in the NBA for seven years. I legit had to look this up because of how unbelievable it was to me
"Zach hasn't played a single meaningful season yet.   First two years, he was playing as a third option behind Wiggins and KAT. LaVine was finally having a breakout season in third year, but sadly got tore his ACL.   He got traded to the Bulls. He returned when Bulls are tanking. And he was just recovering from ACL. LaVine's first real season was supposedly last year. But Jim Boylen happened. Then the season got cut off because of Covid-19.   Now LaVine is just picking up where he left off.    People are counting LaVine out, because they think LaVine already played for too long. Dude hasn't played a lot of meaningful games yet. His mileage is so low. People just simply can't accept that this dude is just scratching his potential. He's a bit old turning 26 this March. But Jimmy is around the same age, when he started to come around. And LaVine has a better upside because of his athleticism."
"As a Bulls fan who’s seen Lavine play live several times, and been in the stadium to hear Fan reactions with him, and also suffered through the post Jordan Bulls and the Rose injury, they need to keep Zach and max him and treat him like a king.  He’s a great player to watch and is improving his game.  The Bulls do not draw prime free agents anymore.  Zach is their franchise."
"I can understand wanting to trade Lavine because his value is high, but a bad fit with Coby I don't think is a good reason. Coby has shown some potential, but not as a guy that we construct a team around. If anything if Coby doesn't develop well as a starting PG we move him to a 6th man scorer role and try to get a playmaking PG to start with Zach. Also Zach is still only 25, we can sign him to a 4 year max after his current deal and he'd be in his prime years throughout the contract."
"because we’re in a thread talking about guys who are good enough at offence that it makes up for their defence.  guys like booker and lavine. and for some reason you bring up an example of a dude who isn’t good enough at offence for it to make up for his defence, like you’re making some sort of point lol.   yes, this player exists? congrats i guess? good thing he is not zach lavine or devin booker. 2 dudes who defensive deficiencies can be made up for.   but hey maybe you know better than every single coach in the nba rn."
Do you think that Zach Lavine could be a second option on a championship contender?
Last season was the first year Zach LaVine consistently had a positive impact on a team. He spent his first five years in the league earning that reputation.
"Zach LaVine will be this year's Bradley Beal where he's snubbed.   I doubt the Heat have 0 All-Stars, one of them will make it, probably Bam.   The rest I agree with."
Put him on the Lakers as the third option and ain’t nobody gonna say shit about him being an empty stats guy.   I don’t think people realize without Lavine we’re easily the worst team in the league. I got the Warriors minus Steph and Klay over us without Zach.
"&gt; really efficient  Except that's not what this chain is implying.  The claim was that it's only empty stats if it's inefficient, and then this guy responded by saying that this is the first year Zach Lavine has been efficient, which means that, to him, he was inefficient every other year.  I'm not saying he hasn't jumped in efficiency this year.  But if we accept league average efficient to be *average efficiency*, then he wasn't inefficient before this year.  That's all I'm getting at."
Maybe Zach LaVine is in fact above the Grant Line! He could easily be too good to fall on the line.
The disrespect to Zach Lavine here.
Put it all on Zach Lavine 😎
Zach lavine
"Exactly. Bulls fans who are not against trading Zach don't think he's a bad player, just don't think he's a true #1 due to his poor defense and decision making as a play maker.   People bring up Booker, who was always a bit better of a passer than LaVine, and point to the Suns now being good. Well yeah, they added arguably the best point guard of all time to their team haha. CP3 can turn anyone into a playoff team – we saw it with OKC last year.   I would have loved the Bulls to get him. So, our doubts are more about trying to get the superstar winning player like a CP3 to pair with Zach. If we can't bring that guy in, or develop one of our young guys to be that soon, then maybe trading him and trying to land a Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Evan Mobley type potential two way superstar is our best option.   I trust AKME to make smart decisions."
"Not gonna lie...same. I mean I knew what college they played for but still    Unlike Zach Lavine who I rarely seen him talk, I thought the Lopez brothers weren’ t American because of their voice"
"man i love Zach Lavine, but i don’t think he’s a max contract guy. i hate that teams have to throw that around to keep tier two players.   he’s currently value. if he gets maxed out, he’s no longer that. i don’t know if you can put a contender around a team with a maxed out Lavine"
Timberwolves could really use Zach Lavine right about now....
"I think the criticism is that the FO had Lavine and Wiggins in house and came away from that thinking Wiggins is the one to max when they had time to evaluate not just their talent but their work ethics and trajectories. Even before the knee injury, Lavine had already added a great 3pt shot to his game and was a near 20 ppg scorer on good efficiency. Don't get me wrong Wiggins was also putting up stats, but the team probably should have been able to realize Lavine's trajectory looked more promising than Wiggins. I think they felt they had to keep Wiggins since he was a #1 pick and Zach was only a #13 pick."
James Harden   Bradley Beal   Trae Young   Zach Lavine  Kevin Durant   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Jayson Tatum   Domantas Sabonis  Joel Embiid   Nikola Vucevic  Jaylen Brown   Bam Adebayo  My tiebreakers were based on winning and stuff like whether they actually show up to work.
"Shoutout to Zach Lavine. Always knew that the dude is an underrated beast  Off topic, but for some reason, I always thought that he was French. Blew my mind few days ago when I found out that he was born in Washington"
imo Zach LaVine is the most underrated player in basketball rn. He's only 25 and has gotten better every single year of his career so far. Not to mention suffered a season ending ACL injury a couple years back as well.   Really hope he makes all-star this year
"I was so hyped when Wiggins was first traded to the Warriors, the guy always had the talent but was just surrounded by bad culture in Minnesota. There’s a reason why Zach Lavine is thriving elsewhere. Why Wiggins is thriving in Goldenstate and it’s not just because “they’ve improved” but it’s a whole culture change as well.   Minnesota has literally made the playoffs 3 times in the last 2 decades. How much longer can a team rebuild?"
"Zach Lavine, Jerami Grant and a couple others are also better."
Coby White and Zach Lavine
We need the Hornets guy that called Zach LaVine and SGA’s game winners vs Charlotte to be paired with the depressed Pelicans commentator who called the Derrick Rose game-winner last year
Zach Lavine has been killer this season
Embiid if Philly don’t make the Finals  Giannis if Bucks still miss the finals  Zach Lavine  Beal
"Zach Lavine this year IS better than Jrue Holiday. Hot take?? Maybe, by the end of the season, still maybe lol. I am a Zach Lavine stan tho."
"Well yeah, it is my first time following the NBA. How the fuck am I supposed to follow it multiple times?  The Rockets took what they thought was a better deal for them... and that ended up being the Nets package.  Just because you think Philly (and apparently Denver?) had a better offer doesn’t make it objectively true. The Rockets wanted picks, the Nets gave them picks. Philly reportedly only offered two picks. So yes, the Rockets took the “better package.” The Lakers can offer all the picks they have and that will get matched and outbid player wise  Zach Lavine will not have much input on where he goes. He isn’t a superstar, he won’t get superstar treatment. Even hypothetically if the Bulls wanted to send him to his preferred destination, there is no indication that it would be the Lakers other than him thinking LeBron is a cool guy"
He said the Lakers have the best package for zach lavine
Again lol. Is scoring your only argument. Well i guess that means that Zach Lavine is way better than Jrue Holiday.
Stockton I get but Zach Lavine for Washington?  For real?  And no Reggie Miller or Ray Allen for California?
"But the ones you think of all the time are in the 40s.  That's a pretty big gulf.  Jason Richardson, Zach LaVine, Spud Webb - 46 inches  Jordan, Wilt - 46/48 inches (conflicting reports for Jordan)  Oladipo, Donte DiVincenzo - 42 inches  Muggsy Bogues, Pat Connaughton - 44 inches"
Zach Lavine kinda?
Praying my Bulls don’t give up on Zach Lavine this trade deadline 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
That’s Zach Lavine and Ryan Ardickianio.
"It’s all about usage.   If LaVine is utilized in a way, where he is in the position to attack. He plays efficiently. But if LaVine is put in a position, where he needs to create. He will dribble down the clock, trying to figure out how to create for his teammates. He will then force up a shot, which is mostly contested. The same can be applied to Coby as well.    What made Zach played efficient last night, is he is picking up his spot. Every time he is not in the spot to score and gives up the ball, good things happen. Especially with Lauri on the floor.   Right now it’s just a matter of identifying a good shot from a bad one for Zach.   With Lauri back, his efficiency and Coby will just hey better."
How do you feel about Zach LaVine on a legitimately good team? He’s no doubt a really talented scorer but I don’t think you can have him averaging 25 PPG on a contender and his defence is not good.
"Zach LaVine was another one I was thinking. To be clear I dont really mean it as a negative either, if LaVine and Sabonis were to not improve but sustain like &gt;90% this level of play so far this year the next several years I think both fanbases should be quite happy."
Lavine? The fuck?  Zach is having a great year but KD is putting up better stats with much better defense and a better record.  Honestly the only guy you mentioned putting up better numbers than KD undebateably is Jokic. But his team record would currently take him out of consideration.
Agreed. Here's who I'd have on the East team right now (no particular order):  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * Khris Middleton * Kevin Durant * Joel Embiid * Malcolm Brogdon * Jaylen Brown * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Julius Randle * Jrue Holiday * Bradley Beal
"If GS is willing to give up its draft capital, than you could probably get your pick of player from any of the non-playoff teams this year.  That wolves pick has crazy high value, if I was a rebuilding team that’s had some struggles, I’d be willing to give up a ton for it (wizards, Bulls, Kings)    Some basic trade ideas would be like   Hield for Wiggins and two firsts (maybe or maybe not the wolves first)  Oubre + a first for Eric Bledsoe   Oubre + Smailegic + wolves first + 2023 first for Zach Lavine   List goes on etc..."
"my man, i started watching the nba when i was 12, i'm turning 14 in march. time is flying but at least we're here to watch zach lavine become the greatest player of all time!! 💯😙👌"
"It's why dallas needs a second ball-handler, akin to Zach Lavine to take that next step as a contender in the West"
Zach Lavine will never be an allstar in the NBA
Zach Lavine is 25. So they both are young pieces that can become all stars I guess
"Zach handled the double, we got dribble penetration, moved the ball, crisp passing and a great look for Lauri. It was so nice to see a crunch time possession that wasn't a LaVine iso"
Zach Lavine flying to the moon
Zach Lavine
Him &amp; zach Lavine make the same moneys
Zach Lavine with quiet 33/7/4
"The one thing that makes me really respect, but also question Zach Lavine is that he doesn’t play for fouls. It’s like he has too much personal pride for it. With his athleticism he could easily get to the line 12 times a game, but he plays straight up. He could probably averaging 32 points a game if he got to the line a little more."
He is gonna suck on defense.       But Zach Lavine is one of best shooters in the league imo.  His potential is more than people see   Hard worker
"We also wouldve had Zach lavine and whoever we draft in 2017 - maybe lauri or maybe someone else.    Obviously that's a offense-heavy team, but those are great assets to trade for defensive-minded players who actually fit the timeline   And anyways, getting destroyed in the first rd would be a massive improvement compared to where thibs left us .  I mean we got destroyed in the first rd anyway in 2018"
"1st time All Stars should be De'Aaron Fox, Zion Williamson, Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Julius Randle, Zach Lavine in no particular order off the top of my head"
I agree with this.   Maybe Nikola Vucevic over Zach LaVine—it depends on who has the better team record. Both deserve the nod.
**Eastern Conference:**   STARTERS:  G - James Harden  G - Kyrie Irving  FC - Giannis Antetokounmpo  FC - Kevin Durant  FC - Joel Embiid  BENCH:  G - Trae Young  G - Bradley Beal  F - Jayson Tatum  F - Jaylen Brown  F - Khris Middleton  WC: Zach Lavine  WC: Domantas Sabonis  **Western Conference:**   STARTERS:   G - Luka Doncic  G - Stephen Curry  FC - Lebron James  FC - Kawhi Leonard  FC - Anthony Davis  BENCH:   G - Damian Lillard  G - Devin Booker  FC - Paul George  FC - Nikola Jokic  FC - Zion Williamson  WC: Donovan Mitchell  WC: CJ McCollum  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  This is what I'm predicting to happen though I think KAT and Ingram both will deserve it over couple of the people mentioned
"Definitely would have benefited from having Luka when he was tired as opposed to fresh. However great job Lavine.   The guy has been a stud offensively, and heading into last season [he said he wanted to focus more of the defensive side of the game](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2858060-bulls-zach-lavine-im-just-tired-of-people-talking-s-t-about-my-defense).   Definitely a player who gets hated on a lot for the situation he has been put in, but it’s great to see the bulls improving and getting better coaching."
The Zach LaVine disrespect is disgusting
Don’t forget 1st team “Despite the loss” member Zach Lavine
he was supposed to be zach lavine 2021 but he's stuck back in 2019
Jokic joining Zach Lavine and Beal at the we need some fucking help brunch.
Zach Lavine doesn’t deserve an all star appearance till his team starts winning. Same treatment Beal got last season
Well Lavine Lauri two man game was solid this game and i don't blame Zach about Lauri in general i think both Lauri and Wendell needs better playmaker than Coby tho
Zach Lavine snubbed again. If Trae Young keeps playing the way he is then he doesn’t deserve to make the team.
"The Bulls wouldn't give up an uprotected 1st AND LaVine for Simmons. The Bulls are rebuilding, if they trade Zach they'll trade him for assets, not give up assets to get a better player. They are not giving up a lottery pick in a stacked draft."
How’s my guy Zach Lavine playing?
"Zach LaVine plays defense like /r/nba thinks Devin Booker plays defense. I don't think I've ever seen a more eager/active player on both ends try to make the right basketball play with a lower IQ. His decision making on both ends is just so fucking poor! I think he's a starter on a good team, but I feel like I owe this sub an apology for arguing for years that you can't put up inconsequential stats on good efficiency, because watching this guy play over the last few years honestly makes me feel like a fraud."
I’m thinking Danny green and Tony Bradley for Zach Lavine. Who’s says no? /s
Before the game thread gets heated I just want to say I love Zach Lavine and Coby White and think Patrick Williams is going to be a stud
"In my opinion, Jalen Green is going to be great in the NBA. A player that he reminds me of is Zach Lavine."
"Total homer take here as well but something I just thought was interesting since Zach’s ppg almost cost him off this list. Is the dude gets no foul calls. Especially as someone who drives a ton.  Per basketball reference of free throws attempted per game out of every player in the NBA:  1.Joel Embiid at 11.7  2. Giannis at 10.56  5. Beal at 8.14  9. Dame Dollar at 7.53  23. Steph at 5.53  28. Lavine 5.29  While it may not seem like a ton, Zach gets his buckets at the rim way more then Curry and gets very little calls. Those extra 2-3 ppg from free throws put him as a top scorer in the league.  Again no real analysis here towards the post other than comparing to these players, but Zach finished at the rim just as much as anyone and isnt getting recognized even as much as he should because he’s getting no calls.  Edit: mobile formatting sux nuts."
Shoutout to Zach Lavine
Yup Zach LaVine starts to take over in the 4th. Eye test i can tell too

&gt; Zach Lavine and surprisingly Giannis are the only ones whose 4th quarter scoring stays in line with the rest of their game  Coffee is for closers.
Isn't Zach Lavine 6'5?  Edit: where is Booker btw
"This is actually a really good answer. We know what Zach LaVine is. We don’t know what they are, but we think they’ll be good. If they reach Zach LaVine production, they’re good picks. If they don’t reach Zach LaVine production, they’re disappointing."
Zach LaVine
"Look at Zach LaVine man, so inspirational"
"People were mad at him for not being able to guard Damian Lillard or Zach Lavine, which *hey!* No one can."
I don't know what I did in a previous life to be born into this world so dedicated to this team.   I watched the Bulls game where Luke assigned Cory Joseph to Zach Lavine for 36 minutes.
I mean Zach Lavine was doing that too but okay.
"Because versatility is a big part in being a great scorer.  Have you not seen what has happened to Giannis in the playoffs for the last two years?  Zion is extremely efficient but he can't do anything aside from finishing at the rim.  Those other guys can shoot it from 3, shoot it from mid range, and finish at the rim pretty well.  Also don't know why that guy included Zach Lavine as he's on another level this season.   29 on comparable TS as Zion with a shit ton of versatility."
See: Trading Zach LaVine for Jimmy Butler
Hands down it would be Zach Lavine
those are good answers but have you considered Zach Lavine?
Zach Lavine and Zach Lavine
Nono I’ll help you out:  “How many times has Zach Lavine been in his four?”  That one :)
Definitely. Hell I think even just someone like Zach Lavine would be a perennial MVP candidate  I can almost guarantee you that whichever team had him would be a top 3 offense. They'd be shaq levels of game warping - to the point that teams would start acquiring players solely to slow that one guy down  Those immobile 7 footers like Eaton would just get PnR'd to death
"Na I really think a car is.   Once they've been drafted, their value from then on is like a stock. But look at the way people value picks next year once the draft is closer  They'll be like ""Zach Lavine isn't worth the #4 pick no way"" despite the fact that the odds of the #4 pick being anywhere close to as good as lavine are quite low. But if you're like patrick williams or Lavine, they'd all rather have lavine.   People fetishize the value of what a pick *could* be rather than what the expected outcome is."
Exactly.   The PGs nowadays frankly are just leagues better than guards back in the day offensively  Wouldn't even have to be curry. Someone like Zach Lavine would be a top 5 offensive player in the entire league and be seen as the Steph of his era - he would be gamebreaking compared to the other guards back then.
Zach lavine is alreaady better than vince Carti
Vince Carter put terror into teams eyes from like 99-03. I almost crapped myself as a first grader when he took that three over Tyrone Hill in game 7 of the 2000-01 ECSF. I think the sheer ugliness of Tyrone Hill scared VC into missing that shot.  Zach Lavine doesn’t scare me.
Zach Lavine by far imo
Zach lavine is the only answer
Zach Lavine
Zach Lavine is gonna be an MVP contender next season. He’s got the attibutes and the work ethic. Smoothest J in the game.
The second best player Zach has ever played with is Thaddeus Young.   Zach Lavine is a much better player than Demar.  Does everything better.
pacers fan but dunk off winning zach lavine from free throw line would make a beautiful silhouette

"Bradley Beal was inefficient in college, as was Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, and Zach Lavine. I’m obviously not saying he’s going to be close to those guys, but he’s going to be more efficient then he is now. How efficient, I don’t know and neither do you. It’s incredibly ignorant to say Ant is the next Andrew Wiggins this early into his career. Just let him atleast finish the season before saying he’s a bust"
"In no particular order.   1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. James Harden   5. Giannis   6. Nikola Jokic   7. Luka Doncic   8. Stephen Curry   9. Damian Lillard   10. Joel Embiid   11. Paul George   12. Kyrie Irving   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Jayson Tatum   15. Trae Young  16. Anthony Davis   17. KAT   18. Rudy Gobert   19. Zach Lavine   20. Bradley Beal   21. CJ Mccollum   22. Chris Paul   23. Donovan Mitchell   24. Domantas Sabonis   Those are 24 guys that are better. I think Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton and some others are better too but that’s an opinion."
*All-Star Zach Lavine
"C: Nikola Jokic / Joel Embiid  PF: LeBron James / Giannis   SF: Kawhi Leonard / Kevin Durant  SG: Luka Dončić  / Bradley Beal  PG: Steph Curry / Trae Young  6: Damian Lillard / Nikola Vucevic  7: DeMar DeRozan / Jaylen Brown  8: Christian Wood / Kyle Lowry  9: SGA / Zach LaVine  10: Chris Paul / Sexton  11: Donovan Mitchell / Jerami Grant   12: De'Aaron Fox / Sabonis  13: Zion Williamson / Randle  14: Ja Morant / Jimmy Butler  15: KAT / Hayward  &amp;#x200B;  All things considered it's not a horrible idea, each team has an All Star caliber player on it's roster, but the problem is injuries and all star players underperforming . Like in Miami's case, Butler is their clear cut all star but he's missed games, does Tyler Herro become their representative? Same thing with Minnesota who KAT is their best player, but Anthony Edwards has played more. Then you start having All Star nods becoming meaningless as guys like Herro would have All Star nods over James Harden."
"this means don joined the list that zach lavine joined yesterday (all star, dunk and 3point appearances)  i saw that thread yesterday and was like, 'i wonder if donovan will do the 3 point competition and join that group'"
"He’s definitely better then Trae just all around game wise, not by a mile or anything but he’s better.  Zach Lavine is harder. If you are starting a team you always take Jayson just because age and potential and stuff but currently it’s close.  I’d probably still pick Jayson but I can definitely understand arguments for Lavine. They are around the same level playmaking wise, Jayson is a better defender, but Lavine is just soooo efficient."
"Not saying he's bad or that he won't be a great player, but Jason Tatum is viewed as a second-tier superstar and before the season started people saw him in the 10-15 range. I fail to see how he's considered that much better than players like Trae Young or Zach Lavine."
"We're not leaving defense out, East guards are just ridiculously competitive when you add in Harden to the conference and Kyrie being healthy this year. Zach Lavine is having an absolute historic year and well that really just leaves Beal who is also deserving imo."
"No, you just have to be a DPOY candidate on a winning team for it to matter. You think FVV's defense makes up for the 9 more points per game that Zach Lavine scores or the 5 more points per game and equal defense that Jaylen Brown brings? Harden's scoring 5 more points and dishing 5 more assists per game than FVV too. Fred's defense isn't even that valuable based on just about every advanced defensive metric.   Just because you like him doesn't mean he deserves anything. There's a massive gap between the All-Stars and the Snubs this year and then there's an even larger gap between legitimate snubs like Sabonis and Booker and whatever FVV is this year."
"Picks 1-5: Jokic, Embiid, Zach Lavine, Julius Randle, Marcus Smart"
     Giannis (26)  Luka (21) wtf this dudes only 21...  \---  Embiid (26)  Jokic (26)  AD (27)  \---       Players that could age well and keep pace:  Trae Young (22)  Bam Adebayo (23)  Bradley Beal (27)  \---  Zach Lavine (25)  Donovan Mitchell (24)  Sabonis (24)  Jayson Tatum (22)  Jaylen Brown (24)
"All of these are so well deserved. And I am so happy that not only Jaylen got considered, ZACH LAVINE IS AN ALLSTAR FINALLY!"
"Yeah LeBron you’s a baller, but Zach LaVine is your father"
Zach Lavine
Zach Lavine has a better record and better stats across the board except assists per game.
"There’s  some crazy shooting spilts this season. Joe Harris, Zach Lavine, PG. Joel and jokic are like 4-5 percent  away on free throws from a 50-40-90 seasons as bigs lol"
"Man, imagine a team of Karl-Anthony Towns and Zach Lavine, along with a player like Wiggins"
Seeing Murray thrive is my 2nd favorite thing to Zach Lavine getting his allstar spot. Murray has been fantastic these last 8 or so games.
Zach LaVine but I don't want to give up Timmy if that's what it takes
"What makes it even more ridiculous (especially with the media) is that apparently Bradley Beal, playing for the 11-17 Wizards, deserves to start ahead of Zach LaVine (who's also setting milestones for Chicago that were unheard of since Jordan last played for them in 1998; Chicago is also 8th right now and not 13th) and James Harden (whereas having been traded during the season somehow ""lessens"" his viability as an All-Star starter)."
"I mean Jokic, Curry, and Luka all get MVP buzz with mediocre team records (even if they aren't front runners). I feel like Giannis isn't getting any attention. Not even from an MVP standpoint, just in general. I feel like even Bradley Beal and Zach Lavine have more people talking about them"
"“Hear me out Russillo, who have the bulls beaten recently? I’ll rattle them off to you, and you tell me whether or not you think they’re a contender. Rockets, Kings, Pistons, Pelicans, Magic. None of those teams are winning a championship, so the bulls don’t have any real wins. They’re winning games nobody cares about besides bulls fans, nobody cares! I still just think Zach Lavine doesn’t contribute to real winning basketball”"
"1) AS selections are DEFINITELY record based. Several players have been snubbed in the past based on team record, most notably Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Devin Booker and Mike Conley. Middle of the pack records are often not rewarded with multiple selections even if they have good candidates.  2) Every team has had to deal with missing players, injuries, covid issues, rescheduling etc. That is now an excuse. Pacers didn't have Oladipo for a while, traded him, then lost Levert who they traded for. They still don't have Warren and lose Lamb too often. For that matter is mostly been Sabonis anchoring the team to a revised higher than the Celtics. 3) Sabonis is absolutely a player with All Star worthy stats. 21.5/11.6/5.7 is very much comparable to what Brown and Tatum are averaging. I like Brown and Tatum and I think they're having great years, but you're just stanning lol."
"Then going by your cherry picked stat, Nikola Vucevic (-11.8), Zach Lavine  (-6.7), Chris Paul (-.5), and Donovan Mitchell (-7.8), are all garbage and should not be included either since they make their teams worse. And this means that Michael Carter-Williams is the MVP of the league this year with an incredible +22.3. He improves his team more than anyone!  Sabonis is one of 3 players averaging 20/10/5  on 50% FG%. The others are Jokic and Giannis. He is the only player to ever average 20/10/5 and not make the All Star game. He is carrying the Pacers while they are down TJ Warren and Caris Levert. Saying he isn't very good is just not correct. And remains the dumbest fucking thing I've ever read."
LaVine. Zach LaVine.
FUCK YEAH ZACH LAVINE
"[Woj]: The East is lasering in on James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic for the all star reserves."
i’m more of a person who follows players rather than teams (i’m more of a Giannis fan than Bucks fan) and i just have to say i’ve been LOVING Zach Lavine lately. he’s probably my number 2 player rn. really really fun to watch and this is well-deserved!
Love we got a couple first time All Stars with Julius Randle and Zach LaVine.
ZACH LAVINE FINALLY FUCKING GETTING IT.   Long overdue and incredibly deserving. So happy for him.
"He is in the conversation. A conversation which will be the following:  ""Zach Lavine has MVP worthy scoring numbers, but there is of course exactly 0 chance he becomes MVP and rightfully so"""
ZACH FUCKIN LAVINE! 💙🐺
"Glad LaVine got in there, was worried about the Zach Lowe hate keeping him out."
"Trae Young this season: 26.9 ppg, .439 FG%, .379 3P%, .506 eFG%, 10.3 FTA, 3.9 trb, 9.5 ast, 0.9 stl, 4.3 turnovers a game.   Zach Lavine this season: 28.6 ppg, .518 fg%, .434 3p%, .607 eFG%, 5.4 fta, 5.4 trb, 5.1 ast, 1.1 stl, 3.8 tov.   And the bulls have a better record. So what’s your argument?"
His reasons: zach is the best scorer this year. Uhm. Clown take. Team record. Bulls are one game ahead. Clown take. Lavine 10x better defender? Hes terrible too. Clown take
Where’s the clown take? You don’t think Zach Lavine deserves to be in?
Wtf are zach lavine and julius randle doin here. And nikola every god damn year.
ZACH LAVINE FANS GET IN HERE 🕺
Zach Lavine - All-Star
Zach lavine is my father
"Good for Zach Lavine, man. Dude absolutely deserves it. Kinda surprised Simmons got in but maybe his recent surge left a lasting impact?"

"[Charania] Sources: The East are tantalised by James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic. And the West are enamoured with Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis"
"West: Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis   East: James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic  Just a feeling I have"
ZACH FUCKIN LAVINE!
Zach Lavine is an All-Star. Look at his numbers buddy
"But what are your arguments for zach lavine being better than drose? So far you've given an elite shooting club that he isnt in(given he is having a very good shooting year) and stats that can be compared to drose, drose also led his team to a 60 wins, and the surrounding pieces around him weren't even that much better than lavine surrounding pieces"
Saying team record is irrelevant to how good youre playing is just incorrect. Let's say zach lavine in one universe was leading his team to a 20 win season and in another universe hes leading his team to a 60 win season(82 game season) and they both are the same player with same stats but one is leading his team to a 60 win team and one is leading his team to a 20 win season. So I ask you who is having the better season between these two zach lavines?
Zach Lavine &amp; Ja Morant
"Because it’s not all about the stats. Ben Simmons is by far the better defender.  On off is so stupid. Zach Lavine is a super negative player based on it. Completely a team thing, not player"
"Lol there was some ridiculous stat where Zach Lavine is second in 45 points scored in Bulls history with 4 games, only behind MJ who scored 45 points in 73 games."
Zach LaVine
"Oh I know who cares about downvotes, same shit with Zach Lavine stans if you dare bring up any of his flaws and don’t just worship his ppg. Or if you question Kobe Bryant’s number of all defense team selections, because at no point once Andre iguodala entered the league was Kobe better at defense."
"&gt; it’s players who have been in the league for a while that get numbers but don’t impact winning at all (guys like Drummond, Whiteside, DLO)  DLO has been in the league less time than Zach Lavine.  I'm not saying Zach is an empty stats player, but arguing that it's too early to call him an empty stats player after 7 years, or it's too early to call Beal empty-stats after 9 years is nonsense."
Zach LaVine: Second Greatest Chicago Bull of All Time
Hope my fellow Bothell-lite Zach Lavine is next to make the leap.
"Kids out here who screams ""empty stats"" don't even know the real meaning of it..  Just stupid fucks  &gt;  Booker and Lavine are offensive superstars. Complete machine. Even when their team is/was shit.. and the front office is/was shit.. these two still kept the fans going. Kept on giving them hope for the future  &gt;  Lavine's massive offensive growth (from just being the flying DUNK KING) has been one of the most underrated, and yet tremendous masterclass..  Imagine him on the Lakers beside LeBron and AD, instead of Kuzma..   Zach Lavine's name would have been popping off 24/7"
"This is my prediction for the East All-Stars to provide some examples as to why the Raptors don't get in.      |PLAYER|TEAM|Conference|Position| :--|:--|:--|:--| |Joel Embiid|PHI|E|F| |Kevin Durant|BKN|E|F| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|E|F| |Bradley Beal|WAS|E|G| |Kyrie Irving|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Jayson Tatum|BOS|E|F| |Domantas Sabonis|IND|E|F| |Julius Randle|NYK|E|F| |Jaylen Brown|BOS|E|G| |James Harden|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Zach LaVine|CHI|E|G| |Trae Young|ATL|E|G| ||||| |Nikola Vucevic|ORL|*Unlucky Miss|F| |Bam Adebayo|MIA|*Unlucky Miss|F|       The Raptors two best chances for a spot are FVV, who I don't think is better than any of the 4 guards I listed in addition to the starters revealed. Then for Siakam I don't think he's better than Vuc or Bam who I think are going to be an unlucky miss among the forwards."
"I sat down and did this exercise before starters got announced:   I’d have:    EAST STARTERS G - James Harden G - Jaylen Brown F - Giannis Antetekounmpo F - Kevin Durant F - Joel Embiid  EAST RESERVES 1 - Kyrie Irving 2 - Jason Tatum 3 - Bam Adebayo 4 - Nikola Vucevic 5 - Ben Simmons 6 - Bradley Beal 7 - Domantas Sabonis ————— 1st OUT - Jimmy Butler 2nd OUT - Zach LaVine 3rd OUT - Trae Young 4th OUT - Julius Randle 5th OUT -  Khris Middleton 6th OUT - Fred Vanvleet 7th OUT - Jerami Grant 8th OUT - Gordon Hayward 9th OUT - Jrue Holiday 10th OUT - Tobias Harris 11th OUT - Malcom Brogdan  I could see reasonable arguments for all the guys listed there and the high scoring bad team guys are admittedly the toughest to deal with.  Hell, there are probably a few omissions there too -  but IMO all these guys are having the kind of seasons where a ton of players will get shafted.   Each has a great cases depending on your own personal criteria."
Zach Lavine with the cool +36  You love to see it from a guy who makes his team worse
who's this michael jordan guy u guys keep comparing zach lavine to?

"Yo bulls Zach lavine is one of the most exciting players I've seen, can we trade him for Bazemore and future picks?"
They're most definitely almost 1:1   Zach lavine is more efficient but shoots 3 less FGA but at the same time shoots 2.5 more 3PA with a 10% 3P% they also average the same assists and rebounds. Looking at advanced stats also shows just how close these two players are. The only real surprise for me was that Beal actually has a higher usage%   https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=bealbr01&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;player_id2=lavinza01&amp;p2yrfrom=2021  If you're able to find anything that clearly shows one is ahead of the other than please show me. The only real separation should be standings I would think
ZACH LAVINE.
Well Zach Lavine isn't close to the 11th best player either so its a moot point.
Zach Lavine
Zach Collins for Zach Lavine.
Kinda surprised no one has said current Zach Lavine
"this is what every fan says about their fav player/team when they start having a good season, especially when they're having a good offensive year. Zach Lavine? Suddenly, he's he's actually way better on defense now! (nope). There's just so little solid defensive data/understanding that defense has become a game of perception and reputation."
"He played one underwhelming losing game with an injured Zach Lavine so there’s not much to be said, but I am extremely high on him. We are universally pumped."
"Unfortunately for him, the Knicks are trying to develop R.J. Barrett and the Bulls have Zach LaVine. Not sure they have an opening. Unless someone think's he's a one in which case, I have a nice timeshare I'm looking to sell."
"Can we stop saying Trae is one of the worst defenders in the league. He is the worst defender. Even clueless guys like Zach LaVine are at least large enough to potentially get in someone’s way. Trae has absolutely zero use on defense, he doesn’t even get the cheap “I’m a small guard so I can slap you until I get the steal” steals (steal percentage is 1.2)"
after zach lavine
"Yeah I’m not ending up in one of those throwback threads, looking like an idiot. In saying that though the Bulls will run the 2020’s when Patrick Williams and Zach Lavine both average triple doubles and become the first ever dual MVP’s."
They also traded Zach lavine who looks like a top 20 player
"He was great, but being great is something that sometimes happens to other players too, and doesn't make a historic story and a top subject of the day every day for the whole season.   It's not related to how he played, there was just a treatment of a triple-double as some incredible, most genius achievement of basketball wizardry in every possible aspect (for these people, points/rebounds/assists per game of a guy is every aspect of basketball).   10 years ago, *every single* triple-double in a game was deemed noteworthy. It really was something outstanding about a game, it was widely talked about. Let's say the season 2009-10: LeBron had 4 triple-doubles, Kidd and Rondo had 2, and a list of players had one in the whole season. It was such an achievement to havde one - an idea of somebody making it regular was such a sensation. No matter what the other circumstances. It had to be like that.   In terms of the NBA boxscore kaballah, it would be the same if somebody just started averaging 50 points scored per game next season. Let's say Zach LaVine or Bradley Beal would just score 50 points every game. Something that seems not possible before it happens."
"Die hard. Die hard Lakers.   Then I follow KD, Harden, Anthony Edwards, and Zach Lavine."

Zach Lavine with better passing
Edwards reminds me of Zach lavine
I'll try just for shits:  Durant Embiid Harden Kyrie Curry Lebron AD Jokic Luka Dame Jimmy Butler Beal Booker Mitchell Kawhi Paul George Giannis Gobert Zach Lavine Zion Bam CP3  I do think that simmons is arguably in there somewhere.
"why isnt zach lavine as good as MJ? same height, same hops, same position, same team, the fucks this kid doing out there?"
We have a discount discount Curry on the team right now in Zach Lavine.  I’d rather have AD for our team
&gt;he has unreal bounce for a guy his size  He has unreal bounce period! He was tested at a 45 inch vertical. Only 3 inches lower than the highest ever recorded and the same as Zach Lavine
"Elite numbers? Kawhi puts up about the same stats at Jason Tatum, Zach Lavine, Kyrie, and Donavan Mitchell. That's not top 5 level.  And then players like Luka, Steph, and Dame put up MUCH better numbers than Kawhi.  In terms of playoffs, all he led his team to last year was blowing a 3-1 lead in the second round. And Luka lit him up in the first round as well."
I love that Steve Alford started his son over Zach Lavine
Zach Lavine.   More efficient than Curry on nearly the same attempts. He is having an unreal season.
Zach Lavine is the one true god
Zach Lavine or [Kobe Bryant?](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/kobe-bryant-describes-shooting-practice-routine-2013-2%3famp)
Zach LaVine.
Might've been Zach Lavine who said he doesn't leave the gym til 400 makes

"A few off the top of my head, Brandon Roy, Jamal Crawford, Jason Terry, Spencer Hawes, Nate Robinson, Martell Webster, Dejounte Murray, Zach LaVine, Peyton Siva, Doug Christie, Jon Brockman"
"They need a true #1 option. Zach LaVine or Bradley Beal fit the bill imo, but acquiring either would absolutely gut the Knicks roster. So well, I suppose just focusing on RJ Barrett’s overall development is the way to go."
Zach Lavine. A young star who’s capable of having big scoring performances night in and night out. They’ve already got defense
Zach lavine?
Zach “Empty Calories” Lavine
Happens when you have Zach Lavine +36 on the other team during nearly all of his minutes
What was that stat line? Zach Lavine first Bulls player (since MJ in '93) to score 40+ in less than 31ish minutes? *Niiiiice.*
His dribbling and shooting form is equivalent in smoothness to Zach LaVine dunking
"Just for reference, he’s nearly the exact same age as Zach Lavine"
Zach lavine is from bothell too and Payton Pritchard is hopefully going to be the next best player out of Oregon.
"So...nobody is going to say Zach LaVine???     Like, I know he's shooting more often these days but he still has his bounce."
This man is making more money than Zach Lavine
Zach Lavine gotta be in there somewhere
"Get better dunkers to participate. Zach Lavine didn't do any trick dunks or use props to win, he won because of how fluid his dunks looked."
"It’s been really exciting to watch the growth of Zach LaVine. He’s always been fun to watch and now it’s finally contributing to winning. High key love the players you guys draft too. White, Carter Jr, Markkanen and even Williams have all given signs of being helpful players on winning teams. Still plenty young too with lots of room to grow. Happy to see it"
Zach Lavine has improved substantially he isn't in the same universe as trae young either.
"Blake, Zach Lavine, even LeBron have all been great in game dunkers post Vince.  Also Derrick Jones Jr. sometimes"
Wolves Zach Lavine out of your list.   Dude was a good shooter and could dunk from the FT line with ease
"Clippers would not have max contract space. They've locked up Beverly, Kennard, and Zubac for 34.5m. Along with Paul George (40m) that leaves ~35m, minus roster holds. That's less than the max even before considering rosters holds. The Clippers could maybe bring in a borderline max guy (Julius Randle, Zach Lavine) but the true max guys aren't going to take a pay cut to go play with PG13, Beverly, and Luke Kennard."
"He can't play defense or run the rim, but he's a great shooter. Having a good year, although when he plays really well Zach LaVine seems to take the backseat"
"You're not wrong that hes put up disappointing stats overall, but also realize that with rookies especially you need to put more emphasis on the ""eye test"" than with more established players.  Some of these guys enter the league into a total shitshow (like Edwards.    Check out Zach Lavine stats his rookie year, Colin Sexton , RJ Barrett.  These are guys who looked solid on the eye test and it took a little bit for their actual on court production to catch up to that"
Zach lavine is absolutely ridiculous
Go watch Zach Lavine and DeMar
Have you never watched Zach LaVine?
Zach LaVine was inefficient too
"Zach Lavine, so happy he is an all star"
Not much you can do when Zach LaVine explodes for 15 and the Bulls shoot a lights out 27% from three.
"1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Stephen Curry   5. James Harden  6. Giannis Antetounkounmpo   7. Nikola Jokic   8. Damian Lillard   9. Luka Doncic   10. Joel Embiid   11. Jimmy Butler   12. Jayson Tatum   13. Bradley Beal   14. KAT   15. Bam Adebayo  16. Kyrie Irving   17. Paul George   18. Rudy Gobert   19. Anthony Davis   20. Chris Paul   21. Klay Thompson   22. Jaylen Brown   23. Devin Booker   24. Trae Young   25. Zach Lavine  Named 25 players I’d rather have, just for you champ. There’s more too."
Wolves got their next Zach lavine
The Wolves traded Zach Lavine and Lauri Markkanen for this dude and 1 season of Jimmy Butler.
Zach LaVine
"So was Zach lavine in his first two years, pg takes the longest to develop in the nba. It’s too early to decide that he’s not worth the time."
"Hes better than most if not all of the ""snubs"" people were crying about.   &amp;#x200B;  Hell I'd take him over guys like Zach Lavine as an overall twoway player.   &amp;#x200B;  As much hype as Jamal Murray gets SGA is the best Canadian player in the league."
Only if Zach Lavine asks to go to a contender
Zach Lavine
Zach Lavine 😬
Obvious: Zach Lavine  Hot takes: Jaylen Brown or Anfernee Simons.  -Simons already won the dunk contest (controversy aside) and is a great shooter. Still young and should improve.  -Jaylen Brown has been a great shooter the last 2 years (and trending up) and is crazy athletic  Skills challenge is a crapshoot
Zach Lavine imo
"Zach fucking Lavine, man."
"Its been a really annoying past couple years as a Bulls fan having to convince everyone of our players value from people who never watch us but have strong opinions on our players ability.   Bobby Portis, Zach Lavine, Tony Snell, Justin Holiday, Jimmy Butler if you go back far enough. The list goes on on separate accounts I've taken mad flak for just saying they're not the trash this sub acts like they are.    It really killed my engagement on here. Everyone just assumes you're a homer &amp; writes you off. Whats the point of discussing my team if somehow /r/NBA always knows better?   I wish there was a sub where we could regulate who could comment based on some way to validate if they were watching games and what games they were. They would still be able to comment but you could easily check &amp; see ""Oh they've only been verified as watching 1 Nets game this season, their opinion on them is probably malinformed &amp; can be written off."" Its authoritarian but I think the discussion &amp; content that would arise from such a thing would be really unique &amp; insightful instead of just ESPN on reddit."
1. I think the overall 3pt% improvement is due to players perceive the rim better with a static background behind it instead of a wave of fans.   2. The players on this this list with the highest % of 3 pointers -unassisted- are:  1. Zach Lavine (48.8% UA)  2. Mike Conley (41.7 UA) 3. CJ McCollum (39.7% 3PUA) 4. Kevin Durant (38.8% 3PUA) 5. Paul George (35.7% 3PUA)  Lavine really stands out here with almost half of his 3s coming unassisted. CJ’s larger volume also means he’s hitting a higher total amount of unassisted 3s in total (hitting 1.9 per game vs Lavine’s 1.7)  To me these are the most impressive shooters on the list. The ability to spot up from 3 unassisted is the most lethal skill out there and you can feel it when those players have the ball.
And herro is Zach lavine on the timberwolves level of bad on that end.
It is in the east. See Zach Lavine
"- Warriors get: Elfrid Payton  - Knicks get: Brad Wanamaker, Eric Paschall + 2nd round pick  ....... next trade  - Bulls get: Obi Toppin, Kevin Knox, Reggie Bullock, Frank Ntilikina + 2 1st round picks  - Knicks get: Zach Lavine, Tomas Satoransky"
"Trade Zach LaVine, Wendell Carter, and 2 1sts for Cody Zeller and Bismack Biyombo, then fire myself"
Trade Zach lavine and picks for oladipo...
Trade Zach LaVine for Oladipo
I would trade zach Lavine for andre drummond
Superteam boi hoping for the sixers to all get covid while the nets get Zach Lavine and bradley Beal at the trade deadline smh
"There are a bunch of players still on rookie contracts that are better contracts. And if you don't want to count rookie contracts then you have guys like Zach Lavine, Seth Curry, Clarkson and several more"
Fuck the Bulls  Zach Lavine a beast tho
"Hot take but I'm gonna say Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine, KAT, DBook or whoever in the next generation of stars wants to come here   I think the current crop of big stars don't care about us but our chance is with the next generation"
Is giving him a 100 game suspension and million dollar fine for the games he missed a slap on the wrist? Even that would have been better than what they did. And you know what a slap on the wrist is? Trading him to another team where he gets to instantly play a ton of minutes anyways.  Maybe he isn't a Luka yet but he easily has Zach Lavine type talent. Had what's probably a top 10 rookie season last year better than their #5 overall pick along with tremendous athletic upside. And is likely an all star caliber player within a couple years.
"The wolves problem has far and away been in IDENTIFYING talent, not in failing to develop it.    Who left Minnesota and really blew up? Zach Lavine is probably the best example you can give, but he was putting up 18 ppg on great efficiency during the 2016/17 season (his third in the league) with MN before he tore his ACL and was traded for Jimmy Butler.    The problem with the Wolves is talent identification, they take players in the lottery who simply are not particularly good.  What did Derrick Williams do after his couple seasons in MN? What did Wes Johnson do? What about Johnny Flynn?  Rashad McCants? Shabazz Muhammad? Kris Dunn? And soon you'll be able to add Jarrett Culver to that list.    Ita stuff like passing on Lamelo that keeps the wolves franchise down, its really that simple"
Yeah I’d say really.  We have guys like Zach Lavine averaging 29 5 and 5.  Triple doubles almost every night from random players.  Dudes dropping 40 like it’s nothing.  It’s really watered everything down.  What is even impressive now?
"Here's a list you could argue for being ahead of him: (IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER)  1. Luka 2. LeBron 3. Giannis 4. Steph 5. Jokic 6. Embiid 7. Kawhi 8. Paul George 9. Kyrie 10. Lillard 11. Harden 12. Durant 13. Anthony Davis 14. Beal 15. Gobert 16. Butler 17. Chris Paul 18. Ben Simmons 19. Devin Booker 20. Karl Anthony Towns 21. Zach Lavine  &amp;#x200B;  That's all I could come up with. I think I would personally put Tatum ahead of 3-5 guys on this list, so he'd be in the 15-17 range for me."
"I'm too lazy to list like 20 players but id put players like Zach Lavine, Donavan Mitchell, and Paul George over him. Even players like Sabonis and Vucevic can have a case being ranked above him."
I know I’m in the extreme minority on this but Zach Lavine. I’m still not convinced his actual impact is even close to what his box score numbers would suggest. I’m not tied to the advanced/impact numbers but they do tend to agree with that.

Zach LaVine in my opinion. He’s on an affordable contract and the Bulls are going nowhere. Matching salaries/young players plus picks and pick swaps could get something done.
Zach Lavine is about to be traded for Hassan Whiteside
not really - Zach Lavine played nearly a quarter of a game AFTER tearing his ACL
"Teams want him because he's been playing really well, is a vet, and on a teamfriendly contract. Bulls aren't trading him because he is very close with Zach Lavine (Lavine was his rookie back in Minnesota), and wants to help him get to the playoffs."
Dame dolla Zach lavine The Klaw Blake griffin Jokic
"Ah but I bet you think Zach Lavine is right? Imagine making a trade for an all-star and your team gets worse. Oh wait, you don't have to because you're a Bulls fan."
And what for? Are the Cavs going to win now by trading for an all star?  Bulls are doing it because Zach Lavine is hitting his prime and they are looking to build a good team around him to make deep playoff runs.   Cavs are more in the blow it up and fade for cade territory. It's better for them if they can tank a few years and get good picks to build around rather than trade for a semi star and lose in the first round.
"It's worth remembering that the HS protocols aren't there for his safety, they're to protect the health and safety of others that he would come into contact with.  Of course he's frustrated. As a Bulls fan I'd love to see him out there. But people's wellbeing is more important than Zach LaVine getting to compete for 10th place in the east."
Im sincerely hoping maybe zach lavine can get one. I mean if he stays with the bulls this offseason. And honestly how bad can the bulls be for the next 7 years?
Zach LaVine 2.0 coming
Honestly the dunk contest isn’t the same without Aaron Gordon and Zach Lavine
It takes only a single year to go from dumpster fire to not dumpster fire. I dunno why u are acting like im saying superstars dont go to big markets. They go to big market teams that arent dumpster fires. This knicks finally arent a dumpster fire so im sure a big name will demand a trade to the knicks (Zach Lavine?).
Zach LaVine. Cristiano Felicio. Theo Pinson
ACL tear are almost nothing nowadays. There have been a lot of players to tear their ACL and end up coming back and playing better. Zach Lavine for example.
Zach Lavine
"If Zach LaVine becomes MJ lite and Coby White becomes MVP Rose, the Bulls are winning 6 championships"
"100%. Fortunately our window is still open because our core was just 25/23/22/25 to start the season, which is insane coming off a WCF appearance. Hopefully Jamal is talking to Zach Lavine"
"At the core of your post, you're right, the difference is nothing and the ""efficiency"" argument that I see thrown around in this discussion is hilariously off base. You're already getting several comments in this thread that are bending over backwards trying to justify it.  I do want to point out that neither of them were inefficient, in fact 55% TS was pretty above average in their eras. Duncan posted 111 and 109 TS+ in his two MVP seasons, which is on par with say, Zach Lavine (63 TS%, 111 TS+) in 2021. Era adjusted efficiency isn't one to one though so don't read that as ""Tim Duncan had the equivalent of a 63 TS%."" And then ultimately, people just hadn't really connected the dots at that point in time that the mid range shot is terrible, a shot Tim Duncan lived off of."
Damn Zach Lavine doesn’t even get mentioned despite putting up a significantly better season than everyone on that list not named Beal or Kyrie
"1 on 1 pickup, you or Zach Lavine?"
Zach Lavine
"Yeah no disrespect to the Hawks, as we saw that glorious day in February, you guys could easily make us look like a high school team. That's the problem with the Celtics though, especially this year: Will Tatum lay his nuts out on the table and go blow-for-blow with Steph Curry to the tune of 44 points on 16-25 shooting, or will he go 3-17 against the Bulls without Zach LaVine? Will they handle Jokic as well as any team has all year and force him to take himself out of the game, or will they let Saddiq Bey go 7-7 from 3? There's just no fucking way to tell what team is going to show up this year. We had just won 7 of 10 against some really good teams, and handled some bad teams, and then yesterday we got blown the fuck out by a Hornets team missing their best two players while we are at full health minus Rob Williams.   This has been an insane season to follow the Celtics closely."
"Randle was already putting up some good numbers prior to this season, he just wasn’t winning at all.   Minus the 3 point percentage and free throws I would say these numbers would’ve shocked anyone  With that said Zach Lavine"
As a Bulls fan I would definitely trade Zach Lavine (and Vucevic) for Wiseman and a treasure chest of picks. I think these guys probably fit better for a win now system with Curry while we can actually restock for a proper AK rebuild.
So Collin Sexton and Zach LaVine are also busts? /s
"He says all the right things. I got to say though, hes been bad enough on deffenze that im legit worried. He can look really great on ball somtimes, but there are lapses so frequently that im worried we have a Zach Lavine on our hands, which is great but 100% does not fit the KAT timeline."
It’s very sad to keep flaunting your 25 year old trophies when your biggest accomplishment since then was losing to LeBron repeatedly tbh. But you seem like someone who gets excited about high school reunions too so glad you had your glory days. Hopefully Zach Lavine doesn’t get too bored. Enjoy chasing the Wizards
"You guys remember when the TWolves had Zach Lavine, KAT and Wiggins???  Scary team"
Cough Zach Lavine cough cough
I was today years old when I learned Zach Lavine is actually 26 lol wtf
"Zach Lavine was so bad he basically broke some of those catch-all metrics like RPM.  But given the huge leap he made in Year 2, we can definitively say that was largely a result of him being played out of position as a rookie"
&gt; zach lavine (who has documented gripes with valentine’s hero complex)   lmao link???
"i feel like a lot of people are gonna miss the full context of this clip  - the bulls have been down as much as 22 this game. it has been a complete shutout since the first quarter  - the bulls resident bucket getter, zach lavine (who has documented gripes with valentine’s hero complex) is on the bench tonight  - miami cannot miss from 3 apparently, with duncan alone putting up 6 in the first half and jimmy playing extremely well  - they have been chipping at this lead for the entire 4th quarter, and miami is still scoring every couple possessions during their slump  - miami has used 2 timeouts in a span of like 3 minutes because the bulls are HOT, namely coby n vooch scoring at will on a strict miami defense  - denzel valentine gets the ball down 5 points and pulls up from the hash, and all of that work went down the drain. you could feel the optimism just die for the bulls fanbase"
A ton of mocks had Dunn going to Minnesota. It was trendy to believe they needed an athletic PG and it's important to remember that they already had a very young Zach Lavine at SG back then.
budget zach lavine
Players like Devin Booker and Zach Lavine are borderline all stars.  18 and 7 were borderline all star numbers like 10 years ago.
"The guy himself has literally been preaching patience to the warriors fanbase and still there are people like you who complain about his championship window.  They won't win a championship with 35 million sitting injured on the bench AND they won't win a championship with this salary fucked team without a bit of lucky development from young talented players. A Bradley beal or a Zach lavine doesn't move  them into that contender status, considering how much they'd have to give up. Wiseman is raw, yes, but his freak athleticism, size and skillset is undeniable. The sky is the limit for that guy and he has the motivation to reach his potential. IF Wiseman can realise his potential and guys like Jordan Poole and the dubs' Minnesota pick can all become solid bench guys to contribute in the playoffs, the warriors could contend for a championship again. Yes, Steph would be about 36, but you're not winning shit with 34 year old Steph, klay, beal, draymond and a corpse of a bench."
remind me when has zach lavine won an mvp?
"I saw a perfect example of this with Patrick Beverley contesting a Zach lavine 3 point jumper.  It's as if the defender has a disruptive gravity where danger of getting injured is the force applied.   Like when your playing defense and you know, okay I can't reach in because my face will get to close and my nose will get bashed.  Offensive players know like okay I can elevate in this crowded space because I might get hurt.  But the defensive players can feed on it.  It's a, ""make em think they might get hurt, and then they won't pull that move anymore.""  So Zach lavine elevated for the jumper, and Patrick Beverly ran up like he was going to get underneath his landing space.  Zach saw this out of the corner of his eye and gave an oh fuck hesitation and then double clutched the shot. Still a close shot but fuckes his rhythm.   Patrick k Beverly was no where near blocking the shot. His entire defense was startling Zach by making him think he was going to sprain an ankle when he came down if he attempted a clean shot without correction."
Look at Zach LaVine tamper on behalf of the Bulls.  Cute.
honorable mention zach lavine... ur not real... no chance...
"Jalen Green is a monster. His offensive skillset is larger than most NBA players let alone rookies. Think Bradley Beal with Zach Lavine athleticism. He’s 100% gonna win at least one scoring title, and his defence is very solid too. I really really hope we (Pistons) draft him.   Evan Mobley is also someone you should keep an eye on, he averaged nearly 4 blocks a game in college, his defensive presence &amp; IQ is off the charts. He’s also shown some playmaking, midrange, and three; along with posterizing dunk after posterizing dunk. A very very tall long defender that can make an impact right away.   Every single one of this year’s top 5 would go #1 last year, it’s a loaded class"
"&gt; In his prime, Kobe was only 2% more efficient than the league average OF HIS TIME. Today, Curry is shooting 10% above league average of THIS SEASON.   I've already made a post about why this is completely misleading way to compare players across specific eras. It was harder for players to be efficient in the 2000's specifically. Everyone, including superstars. Unless you think 2017 Isaiah Thomas is dropping roughly 30 on 59% TS in 2003, or Zach Lavine is a better scorer than peak Dirk, then its pretty clear that Kobe would be significantly above league average efficiency in today's game. Derozan had a higher rTS% than Kobe ever had last year, and you expect me to believe Kobe, who led the league in post up efficiency as a 34 year old, isn't going to take advantage of the spacing inherent in the league now.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Literally everyone who comes up with that excuse in these conversations, how today’s stars’ stats are ‘inflated’ because of reasons. But even when taking all that into account, Harden and Curry are still supremely efficient.   they literally are inflated- compared to previous eras. The same way the 80's was inflated compared to the 90's. And the 60's is inflated compared to any other era. Acknowledging that isn't complaining. It's not an excuse, it's just a fact of the game.....obviously Curry and Harden are still very efficient.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; So why even bring up the 3 point excuse then? If Kobe was a good shooter, he couldve shot more, like many guys of his era did. Instead, he chose to shoot midrange fade-away shots instead.   You just completely missed the point of the comment.........you brought up possessions and I simply explained why their possessions had more value, Kobe was already ahead of time in terms of being a high (higher than most) volume 3 point shooter. Harden and Curry take 10+ a game so no shit their possessions are going be more valuable. You couldn't get away with that back then. And I'm not going to keep replying to this, its pretty simple to understand that every era has benefactors of the defensive quality and rules of the time. Dantley, Jordan, Harden, Curry, and so forth. This should be common sense. Curry in an era with more physicality is less efficient than per rTS%, Kobe in an era like now or the 80's is more efficient."
"Ya they work hard they put in work, its just people rather watch Gianni or Zach lavine posterize someone instead of using skill to get a clean easy layup. Their work should be appreciated people praise Giannis for improving as much as he has since he entered the league but in sure breana Stewart has worked just as hard    Plus the WNBA season starts right at the beginning of the NBA playoffs and the WNBA Playoffs start the same say as the NFL.  Its hard to grow and draw ratings when two bigger leagues are playing right during the WNBA season."
"Still, it's important to show Zach they're committed to building something if they want him to stay. He's never been to the playoffs, so while fans might prefer to tank for a draft pick, you can be sure that LaVine wants to play in games that count."
"I got you. I’ll go by the positions they are playing this year.   PG: Stephen Curry, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Damian Lillard, CP3  SG: Paul George, Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell   SF: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Julius Randle   C: Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, KAT   Top 10 in order:  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Stephen Curry  5. James Harden  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Nikola Jokic   8. Luka Doncic   9. Anthony Davis   10. Damian Lillard"
"That’s exactly what it is. We don’t have a facilitator. Coby White isn’t one and Zach LaVine isn’t one either. Other than we have some bench guys, but they’re bench guys for a reason."
"¨Are you putting Payton on Kawhi(230), Lebron(260), Butler(230)?¨ No because they all small forwards . Would you put Anthony Davis and Jokic on Zach Lavine or Marcus Smart? No. Kawhi and PG are bigger and longer but I didnt say he was going to be similar to them I said he would be in their category in defense impact  and ability. Although Kawhi and Gary actually do defend in the same sort of way/style IMO."
"They’re probably not going to turn into much though, and when judging a trade you have to judge the process. If you trade like Zach Lavine for a second rounder and that second rounder turns into Jokic, it was still a terrible trade because you don’t know that second rounder will become Jokic"
Zach lavine
Zach Lavine without a jumper
They didn't trade for Vucevic to tank. And there's rumors of Zach Lavine leaving in FA this offseason.
"Also definitely better than Ingram, derozan or CJ. Arguably better than zach lavine too."
"Yeah all those Bulls players. And even when they didn’t have major injuries guys like Joakim Noah dealt with minor injuries and soreness come playoff time from all the heavy minutes.  Even in Minnesota, Jimmy Butler and Zach LaVine both played very heavy minutes and got injured."
"The 2 games prior to this they were moving the ball beautifully, then tonight was awful. The team just seems super inconsistent. They haven't had a steady rotation all season, personnel keeps changing, guys get hot and cold at random. LaVine and Thad had been the only steady players and now Zach is out. I really like Vuc, but I just don't know what the identity of this team is, or will be next year."
Zach Lavine?
"**PG:** fuck Fred VanVleet, marry Malcolm Brogdon, kill Collin Sexton   **SG:** fuck Devin Booker, marry Donovan Mitchell, kill Zach Lavine   **SF:** fuck Jimmy Butler, marry Jayston Tatum, kill Paul George   **PF:** fuck Jerami Grant, marry Zion Williamson, kill Julius Randle   **C:** fuck Nikola Jokic, marry Joel Embiid, kill Anthony Davis    I really didn't want to kill Julius Randle but I guess them's the breaks. Fun exercise OP, thanks for posting."
"I'm hoping we take a swing at Zach LaVine if he becomes available.  Other than that?  Kawhi is going to re-sign.  Maybe KAT?  Is he unhappy?  Would he even *want* to play for Thibs again?  Zion is not available AT ALL, so that's not even a discussion.  We're just gonna have to keep drafting well.  Stock up on good young players, build up our depth, and go from there.  I'm looking at the Grizz,  they're so deep with young talent.  Those guys are doing things the right way over there."
"Zach LaVine. Maybe Chicago won't want to because they've just committed to an attempt at contending by trading a bunch of pieces for Vuc, but Zach might not give them the option if he makes it clear he wants out. I though I heard rumors that he's not going to extend and rather hit the FA market, but maybe I'm misremembering"
"Are any of those guys top 30 though?   Semi ordered ranking:   1. LeBron James  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Nikola Jokic  5. Anthony Davis 6. James Harden  7. Steph Curry  8. Kevin Durant  9. Luka Doncic 10. Joel Embiid 11. Damian Lillard  12. Jimmy Butler 13. Jayson Tatum 14. Chris Paul  15. Paul George  16. Bradley Beal 17. Karl-Anthony Towns 18. Devin Booker  19. Bam Adebayo 20. Donovan Mitchell  21. Kyrie Irving 22. Ben Simmons 23. Rudy Gobert  24.  Jamal Murray  25. Zion Williamson  26. Trae Young  27. Zach LaVine 28. Russell Westbrook  29. Khris Middleton   30. Jaylen Brown   Then you've got guys like Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porziņģis, Nikola Vucevic, Malcolm Brogdon, Domas Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, CJ McCollum, Kyle Lowry, Brandon Ingram, DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, Christian Wood that you could argue for the next 10 spots or maybe as high as 25-30th?"

"Celtics needed this win and it looks like it got in their heads a little bit, but honestly the lack of bench shooting is way too big a hole for a legit playoff team to overcome. Nesmith is still too raw, and as a Knicks fan trust me when I say Luke Kornet is not the answer (how has he not retired?).  I don't buy in to the narrative that the Jays can't play together because they are too similar (I think that when you have two players with that much talent you just work hard and make it happen), but I do think they would be better served with George Hill than Kemba Walker at this point. I love Kemba but the team can't benefit from his handling and shooting with so few spot up guys around him. Having a better defender and rebounder at that position would be worth the offensive downgrade at this point.  I feel that Boston lacks an identity, which is unusual given their pedigree, Steven's apparent quality as a head coach, and their recent success. Is this team a slashing/cutting team? An offensive rebounding team? Is it a team that scores so efficiently you can't keep up? I don't see how the iso-heavy style becomes a workable game plan in the playoffs unless you truly believe Tatum can 1v1 his way to the ECF.  The Bulls, on the other hand, have a group I really respect defensively and came to play with Lavine hurt. Given Vuc led the team to a win 2 out of 3 without Zach around, and the team struggles with both on the court, it's pretty clear that the Lavine-Vucevic chemistry isn't quite there yet. But hopefully next season they can figure out a two man game that works because they clearly both have the talent. If so, the defense provided by Young, William, and Temple should provide enough well-roundedness to get them into the play in next year. Some upgrades to the bench in the draft and free agency will be necessary to achieve that, but in the playoffs you only need the top 8 guys the Bulls have already.  If Markkanen isn't starting right now, it may be time to trade him before his value declines too much. His skillset is valued around the league and the Bulls have enough players to try to actively build rather than develop. They need a little bit of everything, so it's hard to trade a guy with a decent ceiling, but I personally would rather sell high and try to upgrade my bench scoring and ball handling,"
Not if they can get Zach Lavine
Without Zach Lavine too
"I think Orlando takes Suggs and Chicago takes Green. I have Suggs slightly higher than Green, but also Suggs-&gt; Orlando and Green -&gt; Chicago is a much better fit. Cole Anthony is more of a SG and Zach Lavine is a ball handler now  Wagner to Spurs is such a predictable outcome lol"
Kyrie  PG13  Beal  Devin Booker  Zach Lavine
"Man if there’s anything this season has taught me it’s  the NBA is just run by narratives from assholes like Windhorst and Bill Simmons and these people spout bullshit so often that it becomes reality.   The Heat have been title contenders this entire season for no discernible reason.   Jaylen Brown and Tatum are both all stars and Young isn’t despite being more successful.  Zach Lavine has been an “empty stats guy” his entire career and now suddenly he’s an all NBA level talent that the bulls should build around even though their record is still hot garbage.  The knicks being mediocre will save the NBA despite just being another giant market for young stars to go after their rookie contract expires.   Lamelo Ball is better than SGA, Trae Young, Ja Morant, Jason Tatum, and Dearon Fox.  I could go on and on"
"I’d say yes   They’ve shown a lot of improvement   If I’m Zach LaVine, I would sign there"
Unbiased take:  1. Malik Beasley 2. Anthony Edwards 3. Jaylen Nowell 4. Zach LaVine 5. Malik Beasley again
1. Paul George   2. Kyrie Irving  3. Bradley Beal  4. Zach Lavine   5. Jaylen Brown
I would love to have Zach LaVine but he is 2022 iirc?

To suggest a quick return to play and a condensed schedule has had no effect on the NBA product or the health and safety of the NBA's marquee athletes is willful ignorance."
"Honestly, you never know. Durant has come back better than ever. Zach LaVine tore his ACL and is explosive AF. Don't get me wrong, LaMelo is great, but I think if Wiseman can improve, he would go a long way in filling out the roster."
Most 10+ 3pm games in NBA history  * Steph Curry 20 * Klay Thompson 5 * James Harden 3 * Damian Lillard 3 * JR Smith 3 * Zach Lavine 2 * Rest of the league combined 5
The best they’ll get is a Zach Lavine type. I’d do it if I’m Philly and I lose in the first round
Jesus lmfao do you not know who Michael Jordan is? Did you ever watch him play? Do you think he just slowly walked to the paint for layups against 6’1 150lb guys or something? MJ’s Wizards years were after the Zone Defense rule change when he came out of retirement at 39 years old and was still 7th in the league in scoring right behind Kobe and Duncan who won MVP that year. AND THIS WAS AT NEARLY 40 YEARS OLD AFTER NOT PLAYING THE SPORT FOR 2 YEARS.     How do you honestly believe that Michael Jordan wouldn’t find a way to score as much as fucking Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine?
And Zach LaVine isn't a former MVP on a maximum contract. We're just in that part in the WB cycle where people who skipped math class in High School marvel at the triple doubles.
"Zach LaVine hasn’t exactly been on a deep team either and he hasn’t played with anyone nearly as good as Beal, and has had very comparable success actually winning games this season."
Tim Hardaway jr. and Zach Lavine
"Like saying Zach Lavine isn't that good, the team is two players deep."
Zach LaVine
"I mean there is something important to be taken from the fact that, say, Khris Middleton's teams consistently win a lot of games while Zach LaVine and Nikola Vucevic don't. Khris Middleton provides a bigger impact on winning games than guys like that, on/off based stats reveal it. Plus RAPTOR etc. all try to isolate teammate effect so not all good players on bad teams are rated as average, Towns is rated very well"
Both in a vacuum are better than Klay. I'd say Beal is better than Lavine just based off productivity. Feels like this is the first year Zach been getting bucket buckets
Future laker zach lavine?
"2022:  If Kemba accepts his player option, listening to months of “Kemba Walker for Zach LaVine S&amp;T” until we don’t get him and then the articles of how Ainge “almost” made a deal for LaVine  If Kemba doesn’t accept his option and signs somewhere else for nothing, another round of “the Celtics can’t keep any of their star players”  Just going to go ahead and stay off the internet that off-season."
"Zach LaVine is the best a player can be without being a star. He is not a leader, he doesn’t demand anything of others. He should be the guy but he doesn’t know how to create an identity of the team. The bulls have no identity. No leaders. Just players. Zach is the best of those players."
Of course. But that doesn't mean young players don't want to play with him. Especially since Zach Lavine literally said he wants to play with Lebron last year.
"I can already hear Stephen A talking about it: ""I don't know this for a fact, I haven't spoken to anyone yet, but Max, imagine if Zach Lavine in the New York Knicks jersey, playing in the Madison Square Garden, with a rising star in Julius Randle, under Tom Thibodeau. Oh my lord can you imagine that!?!?"""
&gt; Zach LaVine Says LeBron James Is His Dream Teammate in 'First Take' Interview   -Circa February 2020
"That 2014 draft has been quite the roller coaster.  A lot of hype early on, and then injuries and bad situations kind of tamped down expectations. But, now, a lot of those players have carved out really solid careers.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2014.html  Embiid, Julius Randle, Zach Lavine, Marcus Smart, and Aaron Gordon are the top 5 players from that lottery, and the 2nd round had Jokic, Jerami Grant, &amp; Spencer Dinwiddie...  So, potentially, the top 2 MVP candidates, and 4 all stars total from that draft this season. Pretty impressive. Just not who we expected them to be coming out...  Just goes to show you have to wait several years before truly judging a draft. But, we’ll still judge anyway... 😒"
"I'm still trying to figure out why you brought up Krause in the first place, he retired in 2003. He has absolutely nothing at all to do with why Gar Foreman and John Paxon's front office was hated by Bulls fans and free agents alike.  https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/bulls/ct-chicago-bulls-zach-lavine-fire-garpax-espn-20200214-k7eh6rpcivb23mrisxwpbtydmu-story.html  Did you just watch the last dance or something? Krause hasn't been relevant in years."
Zach Lavine and Julius Randle were also in that draft class but it took them some time to become the players they are now.
I'm going Zach Lavine or Trae Young.  Those streaky shooters on teams who may need them to launch threes as part of a comeback are always a good bet.
Hey man sorry about the Bulls rn. Always love watching Zach Lavine play and with the Vucevic addition I bet you guys are pretty excited. But damn there’s been some tough losses since the trade and I’m rooting for you guys lol
"&gt;	RAPTOR ranks Alex Caruso as the 47th best player in the NBA over Kristaps Porzingis, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vuecevic, Bam Adebeyo, Devin Booker, Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal, Domantas Sabonis, Gordon Hayward.   this really does speak volumes, perhaps not about what you think"
Zach Lavine is only 4 months older than Kuzma. Siakim being older than Giannis. Steven Adams feels like he should be older than 27.
"Yeah in terms of the players specifically mentioned, Zach LaVine has scored 12 less points total in 73 less minutes. Tatum has about forty minutes less and 60 points less but he also has 6 games less than Fox and was clearly affected by the end of games coming back from covid. Fox is very impressive but idk why these two players were specifically singled out"
"Lots of people here clearly don’t watch the bulls. Zach lavine and vucevic have been good, their weakness on defense hasn’t been our problem. Vucevic, Theis, and Troy Brown jr have all been great pickups. Our problems are due to the fact that five players on our roster (Markkanen, Coby White, Thad young, satoransky, and Patrick Williams) have been absolutely useless when they had been decent or good earlier in the season"

Assuming you mean basic counting/box score stats. Better: Gobert Worse: Zach Lavine.
"I don't think we will ever see another ridiculous shooter like Steph ever...  It's hilarious looking back just last year when people were quick to call Dame the better shooter than Steph bc Dame extended his range.. but clearly Dame was never on the same level, and of all young guys not Trae Young, not Zach Lavine can come close to this level"
"Calling it now, Simmons for LaVine trade will happen this summer. Hope Zach likes Philly"
"Bulls have the best chance to get out. They are the biggest market and they have Zach Lavine and Vucevic.  If they can have a good offseason, they can def be a playoff team next year  They have the assets to make a big trade this summer"
"people are definitely overlooking how good Mitchell has been, that being said the way Utah plays &amp; operates is not designed to have a player win MVP.  Their style is so egalitarian and they have so many contributing players the narrative that Mitchell is essential to everything they do &amp; therefore the most valuable isn't as viable.  Also there's a legit argument to be made about whether or not he's even the best guy on his own team.  I think you could hot swap a handful of players (Lillard, Luka, Beal, Booker, Tatum, even maybe Zach LaVine) into Mitchell's role on the Jazz &amp; they'd be just as good if not better as a team.  I don't think there's anyone in the NBA you can swap Jokic with and expect the Nuggets to be as good."
"1. Stephen Curry: Literally the reason I got into basketball was Curry during the 2014-15 run. Then at the beginning of 2015-16 I became a massive fan of the Warriors solely cuz of Curry. I still watch almost every Warriors game cuz of Curry, and he is the reason I care about basketball tbh. Watching the 35 ft game winner live is one of my most cherished memories, I literally ran throughout my house screaming for a minute straight when it went in. 2. Kobe Bryant: My dad used to be a Laker fan back in the Magic era and until basically they sucked (not his fault he stopped watching, my mom refused to watch the Lakers get trashed often at some point lol). I could only watch him near the end of the his career, but he was my favorite player back when I didn't know much about basketball. 3. Klay Thompson: I will never forget Game 6 vs OKC, that was one of the greatest performances in NBA history imo. He is the quintissential 3 point shooter imo, his three point shot is the most perfect form I have ever seen. 4. Damian Lillard: Dame is very similar to Curry in play-style. I just love his ""Logo Lillard"" shots and overall clutch-ness. 5. Zach Lavine: Between his athleticism and his shooting, his game is so asthetically pleasing to me. I really hope he and Vuc have a fruitful career together in Chicago and maybe even win a ring, two of my fav players in the league rn. 6. Kyrie Irving: Off the court he is pretty stupid, but his game is super asthetically pleasing imo. His handles are literally insane, I love when he fakes defenders really badly. 7. Ja Morant: His athleticism is INSANE!!! I hope he develops a 3 point shot to improve. 8. Nikola Vučević: Overall as you can probably tell from this list, I'm not a big fan of most forwards/centers. I like Vucevic because he doesn't just play bully ball and flop around in the post like a lot of other players, his game is so smooth imo. 9. Lamelo Ball: The flashiness! His passing is so cool, I hope he blossoms into a superstar. 10. Kemba Walker: I always loved Kemba with the Hornets. I know he wasn't ever particularly efficient, but to me his game is pretty asthetically pleasing as well.  HM: De'Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Kevin Durant, Vince Carter, Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore, Donovan Mitchell, Tony Parker, Pau Gasol, Rajon Rondo, David West, Wilt Chamberlain (or the idea of him, I obv didn't watch him play but the mystery about him is so interesting to me. Also I think he would literally be a god-level player in today's league)  So overall, I love shooters and explosive guards more than any other types of players. I'd love to discuss this more to, if you have any questions feel free to ask!"
"Bulls need to focus on making the playoffs, they're in win-now mode since they traded for Vuc.   Zach Lavine's gonna be a free agent next offseason, if they're still a lottery team he's gone.   Especially with how differently people view Booker now that he's doing stuff in the postseason, Lavine's in a similar position. Great player who hasn't shown much because he's never played in the postseason. I imagine that frustrates him. I think a Kemba, Lavine, Vucevic team would be solid enough to make the postseason."
"They don’t have a single top 10 player on their roster, lol. What stars? Khris Middleton or Zach Lavine level “stars” if anything."
"Yeah it was awkward while he was GM because he can't even say ""Zach LaVine is a good player"" without being penalized for tampering. Maybe once he's untethered he can talk whatever shit he wants."
We need an offensive coordinator and Bradley Beal. This needs to happen. Or Zach Lavine to compete with the nets next year.
Zach LaVine
It will be a volume scorer on a shit team because he will need to play the whole game since the rest of the team is trash.   So probably Trae Young or Zach Lavine
"Neither PG or Kawhi are options. I expect the Lakers to sell out their bench and young talent to get a talent like Jaylen Brown, not him specifically but that level of player. If he's available, I could see a Zach Lavine going to the Lakers. Someone like that. Next season is likely Brons last season as a top 3 player in the league, so he's gonna go all out for the ring, full LeGM and LeCoach mode."
Zach Lavine
"The UConn alumn in me wants us to draft James Bouknight so bad.  Free agent wise, there's not much that I think can push us over the edge, mostly because I believe Kawhi stays in LA. I can see us going after Lonzo but that wouldn't be enough. Unless we try and make a big trade, I don't think there's enough to get us there next year. Gotta pray for someone like Zach Lavine in 2022."
Get a player like Kyle Lowry or a scorer like Zach LaVine
"I think that's harder to do nowadays with social media. If someone is playing incredibly they'll usually get their piece, but tbf jrue holiday and zach lavine didn't get much discussion last year when they should have."
"Damian Lillard. Degree of difficulty on his triples is insane, I think only Steph throws up more ridiculous threes and hits them as consistently.  I’d like to shoutout Zach LaVine though. He’s not on that leaderboard, but he did shoot 40+% from deep on a fuckton of attempts per game, has a 13 three game to his name, and regularly creates for himself on the perimeter. He’s elite elite but the lack of regular season success for the Bulls clouds people’s judgment of him imo."
"I don't know that adding Zach Lavine turns a team that got swept in the first round into a top team, but definitely would make the Heat a fringe contender.  It's just extremely hard to win a title without a top-5 player like Harden."
"Bam and Butler have proven to be an elite core. If we can get another all star for relatively cheap through trades, or this offseason with our close to 30mil in cap space, we can compete for a title. All we need is a walking bucket like Zach Lavine or something. Add an efficient 25ppg scorer to this team and we can be one of the best teams in the NBA"
"Lmaaaaaooooo this is such a shitty take.   2015-2017: WHY ARENT THE CS TRADING FOR BOOGIE TO BECOME 2ND ROUND EXITS???  2017: Celtics trade for Kyrie Irving   2017-2019: OHMYGOD THE CELTICS CANT STAY HEALTHY. THEY SHOULD TRADE THEIR FUTURE PIECES FOR A YEAR LONG RENTAL.   Irving leaves, Hayward breaks his legs, horford leaves, etc etc etc....  That was all freak luck. When you break it down, Ainge provided the Celtics an amazing championship window from 2017-2020 but it fell short. You can't blame him for not trading for Kawhi. I would rather have Jaylen brown. Ask any C's fan.   The only bad, unjustifiable moves that have happened have been from late 2019-now, when he signed panic signed Kemba. In hindsight he should've kept Terry and have him start but he the Charlotte contract at the time was huge.   ALSO, everyone keeps bringing up: OHMYGOD AINGE COULSVE HAD MYKES TURNER BUT HE ASKED FOR TOO MUCH!!!!   No. No. That's not what fucking happened. Hayward was asking for too much money to sign and trade and Ainge was asking for those players becuase they needed to be included to make a deal work. Then MJ swooped in with the bag and killed the deal. Long story short, Indy didn't want Hayward for the price MJ was offering becuase they didn't have the fucking cap space to make it work without sending over someone like McDermott with Turner.   Rant over. You're being way too harsh in Ainge, especially coming from a goddamn Bulls fan. What has your gm done besides land Zach Lavine and an aging Vuc?"
Lavine won't sign the extension we can offer this offseason because the maximum we can offer him is 100mil/4yrs because of some rule.   So we would have to wait for the 2022 offseason where we can offer him 30+mil/yr. Also your trade package is extremely garbage for someone like Zach. We would ideally like a extremely good young prospect who would fit right in and help us make the playoffs.   Picks won't move the needle because we just gave up 2 FRPs for Vuc. Why would we again trade our best player for picks somewhere down the line from a top tier FA destination which is unlikely to be bad.
Lol you’re stone cold crazy if you think we’re gonna take Schroeder and a pu-pu platter of bench players/late 1sts for Zach Lavine
With what assets? Schroeder doesn't get zach Lavine straight up.
"They won't have any cap space, but keep an eye on them taking on Schroder in a possible trade for Zach LaVine if LaVine tells them he's not planning on signing an extension with them this summer and that he wants out."
"Well this year's pick is already set, it'll be 22nd in the draft, and the 2027 or 2028 pick really could be anything as those are so far away. Those picks definitely would have some value. KCP and Kuzma are both in their primes, and are on very reasonable contracts. Schroder's value will naturally depend on what various teams have him at and what it takes to sign him, and someone like THT has real upside due to him only being 20 years old (which is why there's been talk of teams possibly making him $80 million offers this summer).   The reality is that this will only really happen if some star out there wants to force his way to the Lakers. It's not like the Lakers can just offer all or some of this for an All Star and the other team would prefer it. However, if some star player *wants* to go to the Lakers, then the Lakers have pieces they can offer in return. Like as a purely hypothetical example, if Zach LaVine told Chicago that he won't sign an extension with them this summer and that he wants them to trade him to the Lakers or else he'll leave in free agency next summer, would the Bulls call his bluff? It could make for an interesting scenario. That's all I'm saying. Don't ever just write the Lakers off, not when they actually have the pieces there to make the mechanics of a trade work."
"This is probably an outside shot, but someone to keep an eye on is Zach LaVine. LaVine is extension eligible this summer, so if talks don't go well and/or LaVine simply would prefer to get traded to the Lakers, then it's possible he could be a target. The Lakers would have to give up a lot to get him, but THT is from Chicago and might want to be signed and traded there, along with possibly 1-2 of KCP, Kuzma, Schroder and one or both of the Lakers 2021 1st round pick and their unprotected 2027 or 2028 1st round pick. But that would all hinge on LaVine specifically wanting out of Chicago, which of course is totally unknowable."
"no not just zach lavine. It was zach lavine, our #7 pick and Dunn who was our previous 5th overall pick. I never said or implied it would bring a championship lol, but clearly a future of Lavine, and a #7 pick was a lot better then what we got back a single year later. And that was our future at the time, as we didn’t have any high picks and literally after trading them towns was the only player on our roster we drafted. We had setup to win now and got rid of our younger players, not sure how you can say we didn’t trade our entire future. Maybe you just didn’t remeber but the season after butler our best young players other then towns were rookie Okogie, Tyus Jones, and Bates-diop...so at that point we had no young players and placed 11th lmao. I’d love to know what part of our future was still there considering 4 years later only 3 players remain. I’m not blaming butler for this part as obviously our FO sucks major balls, but you can’t deny we throw our entire future at him."
I’m genuinely curious on who you guys would want on the team. Is Zach lavine a feasible option for you guys?
Ben Simmons for Zach LaVine. Who says no?
"wouldn't mind it but I don't want to give more than 2 year deals to either of em.  I dont think that puts us in championship contention  we need a real big impact player like luka or zion or kawhi to really push us into contender teir.   not that i'm expecting to get any of them, just that's the caliber of player we would need  hoping we make an offer to bradley beal and then next year zach lavine"
S&amp;T Shroder or THT &amp; Kuz to Chicago for Zach Lavine.  Shroder - gets his money THT - hometown team &amp; development Kuz - big market for brand &amp; 14+ fg att/g Zach - contending with LeBron &amp; AD
"""our entire future"" aka Zach Lavine, which to suggest having him as part of the core would result in future championships is a stretch at very best"
"Zach LaVine for KCP, Kuzma, picks   I think that’s the best return for the Lakers"
Why rightfully so?  He gave them their only playoff appearance in a decade. They should be mad at their management from those years. They traded Zach Lavine for Butler and then gave someone much worse the bag.
"They shouldnt rush the process, look at the Wolves when they traded for Butler and got rid of a young All-Star sitting on there team in Zach Lavine."
Zach Lavine kinda underrated in these comments lol
Before? Zach Lavine would have been a perfect target. Now he’s worth too much.
"Out of Jamal Murray, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach Lavine and SGA that always get compared to each people usually say something like Murray &gt; SGA &gt; Mitchell &gt; Booker = Lavine on defense."
"Put your hindsight aside. *Context matters.*  ATL was 11th in the East before the ASG.   Also, if you want Trae in, pick one of these guards to substitute at the time of the All Star Game.  - Ben Simmons - Jaylen Brown - James Harden - Zach Lavine - Kyrie Irving - Bradley Beal  Personally, I'd have swapped Jaylen for Trae. But that would've been incredibly unpopular before March 8th LOL."
and i love zach lavine and wish the vooch trade led to success sooner
I always thought the Mavericks should have traded for Zach Lavine over Porzingis oh well.
Yeah he's no Zach Lavine
I would trade my left nut for Zach LaVine right now.
"coaches don’t vote, they just select the reserves from the list. and the players took zach lavine, vanvleet and brogdon over young. i can’t really put much stock into that"
Lmao the two people I was gonna say were Beal or Klay Thompson depending on if you wanted the shot creator scorer vs 3 and d stereotype. Maybe also like Zach Lavine?
Ok look at the stats and tell me Donavon Mitchell had a better year than Zach LaVine. I don’t think either should be on the All-NBA team but come on
They were a young team on the rise before jimmy came   They had the best young core everybody still thought KAT and Wiggins were the next best thing Zach lavine just average 19 so it was looking real good but then The trade happened they made the playoffs but nothing was ever the same since
Zach Lavine
Zach Lavine
"he is currently a 3 level scorer. He is averaging 3.5 assists as a 3rd or 4th playmaking option. Give him 2 years and he’ll be a very, very solid player. Like zach lavine if you swapped out his athleticism for finesse... oh wait that’s just Beal or McCollum. Not saying he’ll hit that ceiling but their skill sets are extremely similar. He’s putting up numbers in his second season that are pretty close to beal’s third, although his 3p% is admittedly lower. If he return’s to last year’s shooting form though? come on, let the kid develop"
And hopefully Zach Lavine will sniff the post season in the near future
"&gt;Dame taking shots off the dribble doesn’t instantly make them harder than Klay who is sprinting off a screen and taking off-balance bombs over a good contest.  Damian's also the first option on offense. Klay's efficiency plummets with Curry off the court, and it's not because he's as good as Damian at making tough 3s.      &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Sure, Harris might be taking more per game now  No he isn't, but Duncan Robinson did last season, with better 3PT%, without Curry/Durant.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Additionally, Harris cannot score nearly the way Klay does.  Klay cannot score nearly the way Ray Allen/Zach Lavine/Damian Lillard/Larry Bird/Steve Nash and others do.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;The Warriors are desperate for any offense and we got OP and a bunch of other randos acting like Klay wouldn’t be taking 10 threes per game.  Instead of assuming he maintains his elite efficiency with increased attention and 20% more 3 point attempts like you do?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;but this year is a whacky whacky stats year.  Doesn't explain the Ray Allen, Kyle Korver, J.J. Redick seasons.     &gt;This is full of fallacies.   Evidently not any more than yours."
Zach Lavine being better than Damian Lilliard on step back 3s is a huge surprise to me
1. Steph Curry ......... 47.2%   2. Zach LaVine ........ 36.9   3. Jamal Murray .......36.9   4. James Harden ..... 36.8   5. Dame Lillard .........36.0   6. Luka Doncic ......... 35.7   7. Jayson Tatum ....... 34.6   8. Jordan Clarkson ... 33.3
"&gt;Compared to the dozens of top FA lining up to sign in Seattle  They cannot lineup with no franchise.  That said, Zach LaVine, Dejounte Murray, and Kevin Porter, Jr are all from Washington.  Any two of those three might be a real decent backcourt.  &gt;They have a better shot of recruiting players in LA than Seattle, this is common sense  In 20 years of Sonics' basketball during the UFA era, their record was not that much worse than the Clippers' record in 32 years.  The Sonics signed Terry Cummings, Vernon Maxwell, and Chuck Person, among others.  And that was without Ballmer's nearly bottomless funds."
"It doesn’t even have to be a megastar, someone like Zach Lavine would make the Mavs legit title contenders"
But I already bought a custom zach lavine sixer jersey and tattooed his face on top of my face. What the hell am I supposed to do now?
I stopped watching the dunk contest when Zach Lavine won it over Aaron Gordon's insanity by doing the same exact dunk over and over
"Bulls ain't got any lockdown dudes anyway, but we do have one Zach Lavine  Give my man the ball for the winning shot"
"You're dogging Siakam cuz he got carried to a Championship, yet your buddy Wayoff P can't even make it there.     Game 7 against the Nuggets. 4-16. 0 points in the 4th quarter. 3-1 lead blown  Game 6 against Utah. 2-16 with 5 points  Game 4 against Cleveland. 5-21   Fuckin dude won one playoff series in 6 years and that was last year without KP and Morris cheap shotted Donic lmao.  You call ME stupid, when you're the same MF'er that said Zach Lavine is better than MJ? you are a stupid ass troll. Go mine some salt in the Clipper sub you fuckin PG simp lmao."
Okay but imagine if he decided to play with ELITE STARS like Zach Lavine and Nikola Vucevic 👀👀
"He shot 68.1 on 326 attempts this season. So even with covid bringing down his numbers, he’s been impressive.   Some guys with more attempts, lower percentage include  Zach Lavine: 65.5 on 388 attempts  Simmons: 65.7 on 364 attempts  Dame: 61 on 359 attempts  ——————————————  Less attempts, lower percentage:  Butler - 67.4 on 307 attempts  KAT - 67.8 on 289  Kyrie - 60.4 on 255  Steph - 64.6 on 268  Harden - 63.2 on 212  Steven Adams: 67.7 on 220  Ingram: 66.1 on 177  ——————————————   Close percentage wise on less attempts:   Doncic - 68.9 on 283 attempts   Embiid - 68.9 on 238 attempts"
Zach Lavine somewhere wondering why his back hurts.
Zach Lavine 100% not staying on the bulls
Just like Zach Lavine
Zach Lavine has the record for most points in first half with 39. Correct me if I'm wrong.

"It's amazing that UCLA has produced two of the most explosive players today, in Zach Lavine and Russell Westbrook--as well as Kyle."
Honestly I think it’d still be between Zach Lavine and Zion. Statistically their leaps are still the highest. Incredible verticals!
if you can't start on a team with zach lavine and vooch what makes you think you can start next to luka
Zach Lavine
Him and DBook showing out and shedding the empty stats moniker today.  If only Zach LaVine had the team to do the same...
"Trae if he gets really hot + a high FTA game, and my homer pick has to be Zach Lavine, idk he just has that vibe of having one hot shoot at will game"
"Its pretty simple - Any team that doesn't have championship aspirations will have players who take it seriously, it might be their only chance to gain a national spotlight that season and engage their fanbase. The games will sell more tickets than a normal regular season game with 0 stakes.  Dame wouldn't rest. Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal would not rest. Zach Lavine wouldn't, Julius Randle wouldn't. Zion, Lamelo etc all these dudes on non-contenders will go out and hoop with that spotlight on them. It might help some of these guys with All-Star voting too if it takes place before February"
Dude you're the one not getting it. You can say that to someone who hasn't decided yet on what to do like Zach lavine has an option to stay to Chicago or go somewhere else. But Carmelo Anthony has decided at that time to go to New York. Going back to sign with Denver is not an option for him. Okay?
"My comment wasn't about whether he was good offensively; It was about whether he can control the offense and be the main facilitator the way players like Lebron, harden and chris paul can, and the answer is he can't. He is one of the best offensive players without a doubt, but that factor is missing from him.   also, offensive rating is impacted greatly by the player's team. Reggie jackson has an offensive rating of 116.8, and zach lavine has an offensive rating of 114.9. Does that mean Reggie jackson is better than zach lavine offensively?  Moreover, offenses have shot up a mile since even 2017, with teams recording highest offensive ratings in the history of the nba. That inflation explains how his offensive rating has improved throughout the years."
"Beal's morale is up now and is unlikely to be traded unless the Wizards haven't made any progress by the deadline. Same with Zach Lavine, who I see getting traded if the team keeps sucking by the deadline.  Siakam is the only guy yall could get right now, and honestly he's a decent fit. Maybe Jimmy Butler is the absolute best *if* the usual reports about his drama with the team lead to a trade, but I doubt it."
Only star I can think of that could be on the market is Zach lavine.
ill ride this to ask an acl expert: why such a world of difference between Zach Lavine and Derrick Rose post-injury?
"It might get deleted since the Athletic will reach out to the mods if an article is copy/pasted, but here’s just the lists without the blurb included:  - Wizards: KAT - Celtics: Zach LaVine - Warriors/Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram - Heat: De’Aaron Fox - Hawks: LaMelo - Knicks: Lowry - Lakers: Siakam - Blazers: Jerami Grant - Mavs: Vucevic - Bucks: Fred VanVleet - Clippers: DeRozan - Nuggets: Terry Rozier - Nets: Harrison Barnes - Sixers: D’Angelo Russell - Suns: Christian Wood - Jazz: Collin Sexton"
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
The Zach LaVine special
"There's a flaw in your logic. You're basically saying curry is more valuable because without him, the warriors would have won 10 games, whereas without jokic the nuggets would have won more than 10 games.   This would, based on the criteria you're setting, make curry more valuable if the nuggets and warriors had the same record, but they don't. The warriors won 39 games so let's say curry added these 29 wins.   &amp;#x200B;  Say the nuggets win 20 games without jokic, but in reality they won 47 games, so jokic added 27 wins. Now it's not so clear that curry is more valuable.   &amp;#x200B;  What I'm saying is you need to be more nuanced than saying who had the worst supporting cast is automatically more valuable. Zach Lavine had the worse roster than embiid, but no one's saying lavine is more valuable, because obviously the sixers were much more successful, it's a comparable concept with the nuggets and warriors. Yes jokic had more help, but he also won more games with it"
"Play-in tournament could have been a lot better in the East had the Raptors not tanked, had Zach Lavine not gotten injured, or even not changing the teams, had Hayward not gotten injured and had Levert not went into the Covid protocols. (Not to mention other Pacers injuries)."
"You realize that’s just one example right, I see him do little mistakes and brain farts like this all the time, it like Zach Lavine is the true Vet of the team he always performs under pressure unlike Thad. I had higher expectations for Thad, he did not meet them."
"Again, I must state the following:  Seeing how this game is going makes me want to build a time machine to go back and prevent whatever got Zach LaVine sick from COVID, just so these games can actually be close for once!"
zach lavine to the knicks confirmed
"Might take a look at what Zach Lavine does before talking shit. I'm trying to find his playoff stats, but it's coming up blank. Weird."

"2 problems I see with that  1. If a team is genuinely bad, I doubt they would ever win the tournament and just be stuck as a late lottery team for a very long time until they get lucky and find a Zach Lavine or a Devin Booker at 13.  2. Unless the pay day incentive is huge, I doubt most players would be to eager to bring in a 19 year old kid who might take away their minutes, lessen their role, take away their touches, and possibly hurt their next big contract.  The current system isn't perfect but it's fine the way it is"
"Easy play-in would have been better if Zach Lavine didn’t get injured or if the Raptors didn’t tank their way out of it. Or just Hayward not getting injured. Once Hayward was out, we needed Charlotte to drop out:  The Boston versus Wizards matchup couldn’t be fixed. Boston just outclassed the other teams in this environment. They have the GOAT March Madness coach and have been to the conference finals multiple times, much more experienced at winning in the playoffs than the other teams."
They gave up Zach Lavine and a high draft pick to get him
"Who would make them a clear cut favorite?   I think Zach LaVine would make them favorites, they wouldn’t be the 2017-19 Warriors, but they’d be better than the 2014-16 Warriors"
Julius Randle is better than Zach Lavine and Zion Williamson. And u forgot some people that I’m sure u probably just forgot about but otherwise it’s a pretty good list imo. Great job
"Our fans want to believe in anyone with a pulse who can score.  They will defend them at all costs. Unless they are Zach Lavine, somehow he is fair game for blame."
I’ll never forget the shit Zach Lavine got on here the offseason he got 4 yrs/$78M. Bertans is a constant reminder.
Zach lavine and Devin booker
Zach LaVine and Vucevic going off for 50 woulda been something. What coulda been...
Not sure if this is supposed to be a dig but we would’ve made it had Zach Lavine not had to sit up for such a long stretch of games due to health &amp; safety. Not that it’s an excuse we definitely lost some games that would’ve put us in a better position.   We took a risk with a trade and it didn’t work out this season. We’ll be fine next year  Edit: I also think we would’ve put up a stronger fight tonight than y’all did.
"Full list of everyone who qualifies for these filters (i.e. everyone who has made more than 50 pull-up threes since the ASB):  Steph Curry - 93/229 (40.6%)  Damian Lillard - 95/245 (38.8%)  Anthony Edwards - 55/142 (38.7%)  Buddy Hield - 53/139 (38.1%)  Jayson Tatum - 65/178 (36.5%)  Luka Doncic - 90/262 (34.4%)  CJ McCollum - 59/175 (33.7%)  Lowering the threshold to 40 adds Jrue Holiday (43/103, 41.7%), Joe Ingles (47/119, 39.5%), Donovan Mitchell (50/129, 38.8%), Zach LaVine (48/137, 35.0%), Kemba Walker (42/126, 33.3%), and Jordan Clarkson (49/175, 28.0%)."
Fun fact: the Bulls traded up in the 2014 draft to take Doug McDermott. Zach Lavine was taken two picks later.
"No but you know how it is with sports fans and these sorry orgs that waste young men's time.  ""He needs to just wait it out 4 more years!""  God Bless Zach Lavine and all these young guys that be getting buckets on these trash ass teams and still only winning 24 games a year because everyone else from the coach to the Others suck.  Then they go to playoffs with the dream of stealing a game or two and fans act like that shit is progress when that man spent 5 years hitting 25 pts a game and got the fucking 8th seed out of it in the end.  Prayers up for Zach's career."

"I guess yes technically. But the only way is if were saying his ceiling is Kobe/MJ. Realistically, he’s gonna be more of a Zach Lavine, Anthony Edwards type player if he pans out, which I think he will. I think Cade’s realistic ceiling is higher than those guys just cuz he’s of the 6’8 playmaker/scorer type. So yes technically, no realistically, imo"
"The only guys off the top of my head that are top 30 players that have played in 1 place beyond the initial rookie deal and then 2nd contract (usually players will take the max and I think are UFA for these second contracts) are Dame and Giannis. Steph too but he’s won. I think every other player had been traded or left in FA. I think that’s why everyone though Giannis was leaving when Milwaukee hadn’t won yet, and why you’re hearing talks of Lillard wanting out, Beal might want out, this report about Donovan Mitchell, I’m sure by the end of the year we’ll hear about Zach LaVine if Chicago is struggling. It’s so rare, almost non-existent that guys stay on 1 team their whole career anymore especially if they haven’t won.  I think it’s pretty foolish to think star players are going to stick around unless they have won within those first 6-9 years (depending on contracts and extension lengths). Even if they’re loyal, teams banging their heads against a wall for nearly a decade if it’s not working and they’ll ship them off and hit the reset button."
zach lavine contract ends next season.  I look for Zach to start entertaining others on the olympic team to form a super team.  lavine/bam/dame/jimmy with the heat?
Zach Lavine. Honestly he should learn to whine/protest more.
Give me zach lavine all day
He's gonna be the next Zach lavine
"hes not a superstar lol. I can't believe I'm being dowvoted for this, it's not even a controversial take. If Zach Lavine is a superstar then there's damn near 25 superstars in the NBA. He hasn't even played in a playoff game how can he be a superstar?"
"&gt; I’d trade Ben for Dame, Beal, or Lavine, anyone lesser I’ll take my chances with Ben again  You stay away from Zach!"
"KD, Dame Lillard, Zach Lavine, Brad Beal and Devin Booker don’t do it for you?"
"Steph Curry, Beal, Westbrook, Zach lavine, Shai, zion, Ben Simmons, KAT"
Zach Lavine
&gt;Step-Back 3P% (Min. 100 3PA)   1. Steph Curry ......... 47.2%   2. Zach LaVine ........ 36.9%    Geez steph
"While it’s true that ACL’s aren’t that big of a deal anymore, having one right after an Achilles (which usually are a big deal) makes it more likely he’ll come back diminished. ACL’s also have some history of leading to shot disruptions early on (for instance, Zach Lavine who is a career 39% shooter from 3 shot only 34% his first half-season back and 37% the year after).   You also have to consider that he’ll have not played NBA basketball in close to 2.5 years and will be 31 (turning 32 mid season). Most non-elite players start to decline when they hit 30. Throw in tons of rust and a pair of very serious injuries, and I’d be worried Klay may struggle. I don’t think he’s done for, but I wouldn’t be surprised if he is only 80% of the guy we got before."
Isn’t zach lavine there as well? He can run a team as well
"Over the last FIVE SEASONS Zach Lavine averaged 19, 17, 24, 25, and 27. So no, it wasn’t just “the last two years” he’s always been close to his career average something you didn’t notice. Thank you for proving my point that he’s underrated."
Derrick Rose/Jerry Sloan/Jimmy Butler/Luol Deng/Artis Gilmore  Bench: Kirk Hinrich/Ben Gordon/Zach Lavine/Elton Brand/Joakim Noah
PG: Derrick Rose  SG: Zach Lavine SF: Luol Deng PF: Pau Gasol C: Elton Brand
"I've had this thought as well when I watch him. Give him Hakeem's footwork and he wouldn't need a jumper. With that said, he doesn't need a jumper. Current trajectory has him right there with Hakeem.  I think about this with Zach LaVine as well. If he could get Kobe's back to the basket game...  But footwork is a hard thing to master. As hard as these guys work to improve their games, I don't think footwork is one of the things they work on. Footwork is like a multiplier, however. It makes all the skills you have that much more dangerous. It's like being a great ball handler, you can do more things and the things you currently do become more effective."
Yup. Zach Lavine?
ZACH LAVINE JUST DUNKED FROM THE LOGO!!!! - Bulls Twitter   New Bulls logo extends to the baseline
"I saw this proposed for both Ben Simmons and Zach Lavine as well.    Not each, LA would get both…"
"I hope Dame stays fr but if he wants out and we don't have a choice, I want to see someone like Zach LaVine and maybe Markkanen, or possibly KAT, we need someone who's young and can still lead a team because we have a solid squad to build around, we just need to move some pieces. I just hope if those pieces have to include Dame, we get someone worth trading for."
"Time for LaVine to sell Chicago to Dame during the Olympics. Agent Zach, do it!"
"I will try my best for this bulls fans. Sorry I’m advance if this is shit. Pat Williams, Zach LaVine, Alfarouq Aminu, 2025 bulls 1st unprotected, Bulls 2022 1st rounder unprotected, and bulls 2027 first top 4 protected, Coby White and bulls 2nd rounder this year for Dame and CJ Elleby."
Something about how the Lakers end up with both Zach LaVine &amp; Ben Simmons while keeping Bron &amp; AD too lol.
Ok itd be like saying Zach lavine was better than Tatum 10 years from now because pj Tucker said Zach lavine was harder to guard for him lmao
People definitely thought that ... also a lot of people you mentioned didn’t get a chance cuz they missed mad time ... guaranteed if you went back to 2009 and asked would you rather have wade rn or prime Kobe ... Kobe wins by an absolute landslide ... it’d be like asking people in 10 years  2021 Zach lavine or prime jimmy butler  Like on paper it looks good and is comparable but let’s get fuckin real ourselves
kyrie zach lavine and lamelo
If the best players played for small markets I would watch. I don’t want to see slightly better Zach Lavine in the finals because of a complete fluke
Zach LaVine according to Lakers fans
"I'll go for a recent one- Zach Lavine on the T-wolves. That really sucked and was probably a big reason they traded him instead of Wiggy. I knew Zach was gonna be really good, but darn it."
"Zach Lavine is the last hope for Chicago, But man, the dude can ball."
Harden and CP3 but they don’t really count  I like watching Zach Lavine
"Green is not a better defender than Zach Lavine, stop"
I personally see Zach Lavine with better defense. Hes capable of averaging 20 points next year.
Zach LaVine tries to force his way out to LA but gets traded to the Raptors instead
Sixers fans are turning down trades for Zach Lavine.  They will laugh at Ben for Lowry.  Go to our sub it's literally Dame or bust.🤦🏾‍♂️
"Look kid, I don’t know how subtle you think you’re being, but it’s pretty clear you’re a die hard Luka fan and I’ve gotten you pretty flustered.   “Bu- but.. L-Luka shot 1% better this y-year”   We are discussing who the better overall shooter was.  Again, if your argument is that Luka shooting *1%* better this year equates to him being a better overall shooter, ill let you be deluded in peace (you are embarrassing yourself lol) there are so many more variables to take into account. Talk about grasping at straws. At first it was the better overall shooter, then you move the goal posts upon getting proved wrong? Laughable. You sir are fanboy with tunnel vision   Zach Lavine shot a higher % overall from 3, AND a higher % from 25+ feet, on MORE volume than Irving, Heild, Harden, Young, Doncic, Bogdanonvic, Tatum, Hardaway. Who in their right mind would say Zach is a better shooter than everyone on that list? Maybe like 3 of them?. This is why you don’t go by a single season. If we went by this season alone, we would have to conclude that CJ and Kyrie are better shooters than Dame.   It’s a little sad that you have to hyper fixate in on a **1%** difference in a single season, because the stats show Trae is the better shooter for his career.  Trae shoots better for his career by almost every metric you can find. Sorry dude, but that’s checkmate."
Sixers fans turning down Zach Lavine trade offers bro. They will trash this.   They think Dame Lillard is the only fair trade for Simmons.  Honestly I'm ashamed that I'm a Sixers fan. They have unrealistic expectations for Simmons.
No. The better scorer is the guy who would be better no matter his teammates or the system.  Zach Lavine was more efficient and scored more than Harden this year but he’s not a better scorer.
They gotta draft James Bouknight he's gonna be the next Zach Lavine/Devin Booker style player who's a late lottery steal
"Steph Curry could. He's still in the league.  Kevin Durant. Still in the league(also putting up his best numbers).  Lebron James was a force of nature in scoring, is Trae right behind him?  Kobe was a far more versatile scorer than Trae. Jordan was better than Kobe.  The list goes on. 22 year old Trae young is nowhere near these guys in their prime. The scoring is inflated, it really shouldn't be hard to see just by cross-comparing with stars that play now and also did 7 years ago.   Zach Lavine was putting up Curry-esque numbers."
Zach LaVine exists
"I'm shocked no one has said the bulls. The players we drafted in our rebuild are not what we expected (still too early to tell with Patrick Williams). We have vucevic who is 31, Zach lavine is a free agent next year. If we don't show that the team is good enough to compete next season he could very well choose to leave, sending us back 4 years. Id be lying if I said this doesn't keep me up at night."
Three-way trade that brings Zach LaVine to Rich Paul’s favorite two clients.
&gt; And five more: Bam Adebayo (No. 14 in 2017); Domantas Sabonis (No. 11 in 2016); Pascal Siakam (No. 27 in 2016); Nikola Vucevic (No. 16 in 2011); Zach LaVine (No. 13 in 2014).  I feel like Brogdon was a bigger steal than Sabonis.
Give me Zach Lavine
Zach Lavine?
How is a #1 seed team a mess?  As long as Embiid is on the team Philly will always be a threat.   Our only issue is Simmons. Watch Morey trade him for Zach Lavine and shut all the haters up.  I'm tired of this Philly slander. I want smoke wit all you!💨  Philly vs Everybody!
"Zach Lavine is a player far and above Simmons, hence the pick compensation. I don’t think Morey is scared to send Simmons to CHI, they aren’t even a playoff team."
Zach LaVine shoots 37% from midrange. Kinda slouch.
"Ben Simmons, a hurt kyrie and possibly Zach lavine"
Zach lavine and K Love. Wolves represent
Empty stats narrative usually quiets down when the team makes the playoffs. The narrative dies if said player wins a playoff series as the lead guy. Booker and Trae killed that narrative this season.   Julius Randle gets an acknowledgement of growth.   Zach Lavine still has that narrative.
Apparently he has to be better than Zach Lavine and Ben Simmons... 🙄
The disrespect to Zach Lavine
Zach Lavine
"Zach Lavine didn’t get drafted at 1 either. We’ll see how he turns out, but jaw dropping highlights doesn’t always mean the best basketball player"
"Jalen Green should be considered tbh, i don't see a world where he doesn't end up being a great scorer. He's the next Zach Lavine except coming into the league more polished."
Zach Lavine salivating at the thought.
"Or Jrue holiday, Zach lavine, jerami grant, Kevin love, draymond green"
Damian Lillard / Jrue Holiday  Bradley Beal / Zach LaVine / Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum / Khris Middleton  Kevin Durant / Jerami Grant  Bam Adebayo / Draymond Green / Kevin Love  Kind of an odd roster but they're so good it should still be a pretty easy job to get gold.
"Unfortunately, you invalidate yourself with your examples: they all have to do with one team...and that's exactly the problem with the league. Aside from the same teams and players they've been talking about the league had been largely top heavy the last six or so years.   Are the other good players in the league? Sure, but nor many and they were all young and thusly unrefined and on bad teams until recently; we're talking about Trae Young MUCH more now and in a different tone and context than we were even 4 months ago...but we don't talk about the Bulls because they're a bad team; we don't talk about Zach Lavine because his team is doing bad. Tree media is justified in this regard  Where they're not I'd how often they imply or straight up suggest that players good players LIKE Zach Lavine need to not only move to other teams but team up with other stars which is 1 of a few ways we got this top heavy league to begin with. If they were to instead talk about how there are very scarcely any player worth mentioning in the league then they're be hounded for that too. But these are the realities of the league right now."
"well considering it's called THE PROCESS you evaluate the best possible avenue for your team to compete for a championship and go from there.   whether or not you reach your goal is irrelevant to some extent. you need to evaluate your options and determine what you would have done differently if you fail. of course that's a part of any business or goal you set for yourself. but you do not solely look at the results and scream about how you failed despite having a sound process.  it's a numbers game. what chance does any team really have to win a championship? it's all about increasing your odds to have the best chance to win a championship. do you think the sixers are better off or worse because of the process? because right now the sixers were in a better position to win a championship than they have been the past 19 years.  how does that make the process a failure? does the fact that zach lavine went into COVID protocol mean that the vucevic trade was a failure? or is that an unforeseen circumstance (such as the NBA stepping in and buttfucking the franchise with the colonjellos) which impacts the results but does not invalidate your thought process.  if you stop at a stop sign and get rear ended by someone not paying attention, do you roll through the stop sign the next time? or do you say ""i should still stop here"" and ignore past result because your process was correct?"
Cade is more of a all around player than a pure scorer. Not to say he wont be a good scorer.   Jalen Green is similar to a Anthony Edwards or Zach Lavine. He will be an elite scorer.
"I think we can get better than what the cavs have to offer. Ben has value despite his historically poor showing in the playoffs. Ben can be the center of a trade for like a DeAaron Fox or a Zach Lavine. He won’t get you a Dame or a steph or a Beal though. It would probably be like Ben, shake Milton, plus 2-3 firsts"
Same I want Green as well I don’t think ppl actually realize how good that kid is gonna be mannn (his floor is Jaylen Brown type production imo at minimum and his ceiling could be crazy) I see a lot of Zach Lavine in him. KPJ Green and wood are a phenomenal young core to structure this rebuild around and they have a great young supporting cast as well in Tate and Marin Jr
"Zach Lavine, Nikola Vucevic, and Coby White."

2022: Nikola Vucevic   2023: Zach Lavine   2024: Lauri Markkanen   2025: Coby White   2026: Patrick Williams
Zach Lavine is averaging 28 points on $19.5M annually
bruh get Zach lavine on the team
"Pretty sick that Zach Lavine just had a 28 PPG 50/40/85 season and won’t make the team but washed curmudgeonly dipshit Kevin Love will. It is good, to me"
Lavine is the level of player Booker is. 27/5/5 on 63.4% TS for Zach vs 25/4/4 on 58.7% TS this season. Lavine was also ahead of Book in every single advanced stat I saw. Lavine is absolutely the same level as book.
Zach Lavine was also the 13th pick. Three of the best young shooting guards.
 Zach Lavine too
"Should’ve traded him years ago but, we got downvoted and screamed on when we said it. You don’t trade someone when everyone knows they’re trash. You trade them when they have value. You might’ve seriously got Devin Booker or Zach Lavine for Simmons a few years ago. Now, you gotta beg a team to take him. It’s too late."
"This past year … the [top 3](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/isolation/?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PPP&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=POSS*GE*100 ) were DeMar, KD and [surprise!!] Zach Lavine"
"Yes, players are rated better and play better when they are surrounded by other good players, I don’t know what’s confroversial about that.  No shit Lavine would be seen as more effective and more desirable when they get another costar who signals that the Bulls org is all in on Zach.  Same thing happened with DBook and CP3.  His team gets better, he gets better.  Totally different from making that same connection to Devin Booker, who’s only real similarity to Lavine is their position and that people sometimes say they have “empty stats”.  Lavine takes twice as many 3’s, shoots 7% better from 3, and also utilizes vastly superior explosiveness in his game.  It’s like comparing Larry Bird to Lebron as similar because they put up similar statlines but don’t play that similarly at all."
"Lmao GM’s don’t base their trades off of fucking “perception” you knobheads, they base it off of production and their workouts/meetings/system fit.  NBA players are not meme stocks where when GME goes up AMC also does, if someone wants Zach Lavine they’ll do it because he’s an efficient scorer not because a player on a different team made the WCF.  You all act like these GM’s of multibillion dollar organizations think like randos on a forum."
The disrespect to Zach Lavine is unreal no way they trade him for Simmons
Inject Zach Lavine in my veins
I checked on him this morning he on a flight to Chicago. Zach Lavine on his way to Philly.
Y'all are crazy if you think teams still don't view Simmons as a key piece anymore.  He want get us a star like Dame or Beal. But he can still get back a good player if we add picks and other assets.  Don't be shocked if Morey made a move for Zach Lavine.
We will get Zach Lavine once he tells Chicago he wants out.  Simmons/Maxey/picks watch Morey make magic!
"John Wall and Zach Lavine are closers but Middleton, who was 2 game winners this playoffs, isn’t?"
There is not a snowball’s chance in hell they get Zach Lavine for Ben Simmons. That would be one of the stupidest trades in NBA history
"CJ hasn't done terribly when Dame has been out and he's been the point guard. He has the passing ability and handles, he's just never really been in that role where his job was to completely run the offense.   I think he's more than capable of doing so.   Like it might not be his first instinct, but that's also the case for Zach Lavine, but he's playing point and doing okay, the team around him just sucks.   Pairing CJ with Harris and Embiid and some 3 and D wings makes sense to me. I just don't know if Ben Simmons for CJ makes sense for Portland."
"When you eliminate context from the player it’s easy to be fooled so easily. Porzingis had no inside or post game in NY either. He had these same weaknesses. He was just #1 option. If Luka leaves, Porzingis will average the same on the Mavs as he did in that ONE “max worthy” season on the Knicks (already injury prone back then btw).  Kemba walker is a similar scenario.  My bet is the next guy to end up like this is Zach Lavine. When he has to actually contribute on a contending team, their stats will suffer and guys like you will ask “what happened?”"
CHI largely didn’t make the playoffs because Lavine was out for 11 games towards the end of the season.  I don’t think Zach will sit back and blame anyone else for that.
"Hornets are trending up with LaMelo and probably make the playoffs next year if they don't screw up their off-season or get screwed by injuries. Simmons is one of the worst-fitting players you could put next to Zion. I don't think the Wolves have anything that could help the Sixers win in the playoffs, tbh.  I think you're right that teams in that tier should be interested by Simmons. I think the Bulls are good candidates for a Simmons trade because they seem to want to make the playoffs, they have some spacing on the roster, they need perimeter defenders, their FO doesn't like their current PF prospect, and some of their players can be valuable role players which should draw the Sixers' interest.   At this point, I don't think the Sixers will have enough to make it happen, but I think Zach LaVine would be a very good fit in Philly. Simmons for LaVine could be the start of a very interesting package."
"There’s only two reasons the Bulls would trade zach lavine right now: either to blow everything up and rebuild, or to get another franchise player. I can’t see simmons fitting into either of those trades"
"I mean if the bulls were able to get Ben simmons or anyone who has the caliber to be a DPOY runner up while also being able to average at least 7 or 8 assists per game (which on my book is a star player) for a few role players, of course the bulls would say yes. Of course they would be happy to add another star player to LaVine and Vucevic. Someone to up their defense and playmaking.  Though I like Coby...I prefer Maxey.  https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=whiteco01&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;player_id2=maxeyty01  When you compare per 36 and per 100 possessions, Maxey is actually better than Coby. So why would we want to replace Maxey who can potentially put up similar numbers or potentially even better next year if he gets around the same numbers?  Sorry but this trade is awful for the bulls. I hope you guys can fleece another team for a star to make a deep playoff run or you guys will end up blowing it all up within the next year or so anyway and Zach will leave regardless. Glad to see you guys pushing though. I want the bulls to be a contender again even if it's a few years down the line."
"Lavine is the reason we would want Simmons so he’s off the table.  Probably Thaddeus Young, Coby White, and then anyone else not named Zach, Vucevic, or Williams to make the salaries match.  If you guys really wanted we could try and make a sign and trade with Lauri work too.  Bulls take it to pair a 3rd star with Lavine and to address holes in playmaking and defense.  Its not the best haul for the 76ers, but Thad just had a career year and Coby is already an excellent scorer on a rookie deal. I don’t think thats enough to get it done, but thats the hypothetical."
2014 Zach LaVine instead of Randle  2015 Devin Booker instead of Russell   2016 Ingram was fine  2017 Jayson Tatum instead of Lonzo Ball   2018 Gary Trent Jr instead of Mo Wagner
I always thought book was like Zach Lavine and would never go deep in the playoffs
"I will keep doing it for at least 5 years, the same amount of time I had to hear that Booker was worse than Zach Lavine"
Yeah for Zach Lavine LMAO
"Then what are you selling Zach on during his Free Agency? The 2023 FA class?  I think the Bulls can build around Lavine, but its going to be pretty tricky. If you're not bringing back Vuc.... then what's the point of trading two lottery picks for him?"
"Great execution by Nigeria. Play was a double baseline/curl screen for Lavine and the defense didn't bite at all. #9 stayed on the 3 point line and switched as soon as Zach came around.  I blame Pierce for assuming that Nigeria would be dumb enough to play tight man defense when they know US needs a 3. A double screen or elevator screen only works if you can get defenders bunched together.  Since no one asked, I would have KD inbound the ball to Lillard and then had Tatum set a little off-ball screen for KD before sliding to the corner. Option 1 is KD catch and shoot from Dame, option 2 is 1 dribble then kick to Tatum in the corner, and last option is iso for Dame at top of the key."
Lavine is fine. It might actually be good for him so that he can play off ball and playmake more. Also Zach and Vuc PnR is deadly  Lauri is useless but he wasn't going anywhere either. He doesn't have a single good NBA skill aside from being a decent 3 point shooter for a big and even then stretch 4s are becoming redundant in the modern NBA
they ain't making the playoffs or play-ins with zach lavine and vucevic
Zach Lavine dunking
It's confusing who was supposed to get the final shot. Zach LaVine?
Lloyd Pierce is a garbage coach ffs. Zach Lavine is the worst player on the court yet he gets the ball?     What's more shocking is that he even got on the Olympic team like did he blackmail the coaching staff?
"Kobe, hands down.  If Jordan was the Beethoven of basketball, Kobe would've been Miles Davis. Every single thing he did on the court, he did with such grace, so smooth that it looked effortless, like he was dancing. It was perfection in and of motion.  I feel a similar way watching Kyrie dribble through traffic or KD pull up for a jumper, or rewatching those Zach Lavine dunk contest dunks, but nobody's brought it to every facet of the game the way Kobe did."
For current players (because most comments in this thread are retired all-timers) I’d have to go with Zach Lavine. So damn smooth.
"Hot Take: Zach Lavine is the most AESTHETICALLY pleasing player to watch. His jumpshot flows, and when his feet leave the ground, he makes it look effortless. His dunks are not amazing because of the power behind them, but because of the finesse. While Kobe and MJ's dunks are like rifles, his are like a silenced pistol."
The only reason why people played for team usa was to tamper and recruit each other (Zach Lavine said it).
"&gt;  we acknowledge that he's sacrificed his stats and role  Ok, let's say we accept this.  &gt;This is the first year that Zach has ever posted a better individual season than Booker  Zach's stats this season are not just better than Booker's this season. They're better than Booker's every season, even in those where it wasn't required for him to sacrifice.  Zach this season has higher PPG than Booker's best season, higher TS% (63.4, while booker has only cracked 60% once in his career). If you're telling me that Booker sacrificed for his team - can I acknowledge that? Maybe. Can I agree that Booker would reach 27.4ppg on 63.4 TS% if he played the role of Lavine? No, because it wouldn't make sense for you to be more efficient if you played more selfishly.  &gt;in his age-24 season where he's still clearly on the upswing  Once again, don't see how this is decisive. Lavine could have very plausibly improved more than Booker did.  &gt;Let's also not pretend that Zach has demonstrated either the ability or willingness to sacrifice his game  If Booker sacrifices his game, he has Ayton, CP3, and a bunch of great roleplayers to carry the load. Lavine cannot do that, because his supporting cast is crap. It's not like Lavine has been put in this position and refused to sacrifice, so you can't say he's unwilling."
Deport zach lavine
Zach lavine hates America
What is Zach Lavine doing the last possession before the foul...
Zach Lavine
Zach LaVine is an awful defender lol
zach lavine cant be taking shots like this with this team.  this aint the bulls.
James Harden has a better chance of being a defensive stopper with his matador defense than Zach LaVine.
“I think zach lavine can be a defensive stopper for this team”  Jesus Christ
"- LaVine has made 2 leaps since joining the Bulls and could easily make another, especially with this Team USA experience. I always say: Whether or not the Bulls get a championship window from this rebuild depends on if Zach can step up and be a legit no1 option. All signs point to yes. - Dunn didn't work out at all - WCJ netted us Vuc. He did get injured constantly and didn't develop much though.  - Lauri didn't work out - we will see if he nets us anything in a S&amp;T - Coby has developed quite a bit. His rebounding and paint scoring took a leap this year. And towards the end when Zach had Covid, his facilitating was legit. Hopefully he improves his off-the-dribble 3 next season.  - PWill is the most promising pick we've had all rebuild. I could easily see him both improving his paint scoring and pull-up 3pt shooting in the next couple years. Kid already has an all-time highlight blocking that oop to Ayton. Disgusting. Hopefully this Olympic training will help him.   Nothing gaudy, but not that bad. GarPax and Boylen did stunt development. Next season will be a good litmus test for how Billy and the new FO are on that front (this year we were kind of flying by the seat of our pants due to the condensed schedule. You could tell it was rough on a young team that had struggled to have continuity for a few years.)"
"&gt;He screwed Zach Lavine out of the dunk contest  Wrong dunk contest lol, which just speaks to how little people actually cared about that. People stopped caring and let it become a meme like a week after it happened.   &gt;disrespected Dirk with the cough in the 2011 playoffs  Nobody outside of Reddit/some Mavs fans ever brings that up.  He's pretty much universally loved outside of Reddit besides some Mavs fans. I can't think of a more popular player that's as universally well liked."
"Beloved? He screwed Zach Lavine out of the dunk contest, disrespected Dirk with the cough in the 2011 playoffs"
so no hate for screwing Zach Lavine in the dunk contest?
"I wish your candidates list was full of actual candidates, most of those players have no chance of getting traded(Lebron James? Really?). To answer your question, I think Zach Lavine has a good chance of getting moved, maaaaaybe Bradley Beal as well, but that one's a little more sus."
"2016 Warriors were a hell of a lot better than 2020 Bulls... +/- ain’t a super valuable metric to compare here. IMO it’s really only good for players on the same team.  Steph was all around better, don’t get me wrong, but Zach Lavine is the truth and he needs some respek on his name."
"Sure. Booker had superior stats every year of their careers in comparison, and this year, in his age-24 season where he's still clearly on the upswing, he posted an inferior statistical season than he did the year before. Either we believe that Booker has regressed just as he enters his prime, or we acknowledge that he's sacrificed his stats and role for the greater good of a championship contender. Please pick a side, either of them, and we can go from there.   This is the first year that Zach has ever posted a better individual season than Booker, and that his team has played better when LaVine is on the court. If you're ready to crown his ass, crown him, I'm just saying that Booker has been the better scorer and playmaker every season otherwise.. except for this year when he's 2 games from an NBA championship. Coincidence? Let me know."
Zach Lavine
Zach Lavine again
I would definitely trade Middleton for Zach LaVine in a second.
Zach Lavine was in that trade
He's the next Zach Lavine for sure
"Derozan not better than Zach Lavine, Or De’Aaron Fox"
Zach LaVine should move up a tier with Russ moving down a tier imo
Give me Zach Lavine or Kyle Lowrey!
Can Zach Lavine come with the jersey?
I'll give you a Zach Lavine jersey
Fine. Give us Zach Lavine
"If play in counts as playoffs then Zach Lavine, if not Curry for the Lakers."
I was watching a John Hollinger video yesterday and one thing he said kind of struck me; Zach LaVine might be the most suitable trade target for Ben Simmons.  Zach's an expiring and Chicago would have to give up all of their cap room for him so there wouldn't be much room for roster improvement after that. Ben's a guy that's locked into a contract for the next few years and Vooch is a much better fit next to him as one of the best stretch 5's in the league.
"My lord, you have the reading comprehension of a toddler. Booker never deserved the label of ‘empty stats guy’. And it is true people have turned the corner and are finally giving him his long over due credit now that the Suns are winning. He’s not only a good player but he just seems to have that ‘it factor’. He’s a superstar.   But what you are saying about Lavine since he’s on a bad/mediocre team is the same shit people said about Booker the past few years. How do you not see how hypocritical you are being. You don’t need to tear down Zach just cuz people did the same to Book."
Zach Lavine is a good looking dude too
I’m actually Zach Lavine so I go alright myself mate.
zach lavine
 Here are my predictions:  **Western Conference**  *Starters*  G- Stephen Curry   G- Luka Doncic   F- LeBron James  F- Zion Williamson   F- Nikola Jokic   *Bench*  G- Devin Booker  G- Donovan Mitchell   F- Kawhi Leonard  F- Paul George   F- Anthony Davis   WC- Damian Lillard  WC- Deandre Ayton  ——————————————-  **Eastern Conference**  *Starters*  G- Trae Young  G- James Harden  F- Kevin Durant   F- Giannis Antetokounmpo   F- Joel Embiid   *Bench*   G- Kyrie Irving   G- Bradley Beal  F- Jayson Tatum  F- Julius Randle   F- Bam Adebayo   WC- LaMelo Ball  WC- Zach LaVine   —————————-

God damn Zach Lavine is so smooth. I love the bulls because of him &amp; Vucevic
Zach Lavine. We go pretty damn far if everything else stays the same with injuries to Brooklyn
Did Zach Lavine got bigger? He looks massive
Is Zach Lavine that guy? Absolutely.
Zach Lavine just glides man
Zach Lavine looked like a 7 footer from the angle in this clip. camera must have been on the ground or something.
They look good!  Zach Lavine may get called for travel in the olympics with that drive.
"I wouldn’t trust OG to guard Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, De’Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, DeAndre Ayton, or Nikola Vucevic for an entire game (not just a switch).  I’d trust Ben to do that for any of those players.  O.G. is a better asset but not the better defender.  Simmons is faster, stronger, and smarter."
"i dont have a strong take on Sexton either way, Im not as high on him as others right now but I could also see him improving alot and maybe following the Zach LaVine trajectory. It's TBD. What I do think is really stupid though is trading Sexton because you dont want to pay him but then turning around and giving Jarrett Allen huge $$"
Zach Lavine reaction when he got drafted to Minnesota it was like “wtf did I do to deserve this shit?!”
"Booker’s low assists are one thing. The issue is that hes consistently has a turnover problem in the past that hasn’t gone away despite not being the main playmaker. The only guy with at least 2.75 turnovers per game (he has 3.1) and the same or fewer assists per game is Embiid.   It’s just untrue to say all the things KAT’s better at is due to him being a center. Booker’s significantly worse from 3 for example and has been for years.  His advanced stats don’t just look bad compared to KAT’s or centers’, they look bad in general.   He has a negative bpm. Some of the guards above him who played enough to qualify for the leaderboard: Sexton, Reggie Jackson, Brunson, both Murrays, Devonte Graham, Haliburton, Clarkson, Fox, Brogdon, T.J., both Ball brothers, Kemba, Terry, Delon Wright, FVV, Jaylen, Westbrook, Beal, CJ, Mitchell, Jrue, and Conley.  His win shares per 48 is worse than qualifying  guards like CP3, Conley, Mitchell, Jrue, Trae, Brunson, CJ, PG, LaVine, Beal, Jamal, Lowry, TJ, Seth, Delon Wright, Jaylen, Reggie Jackson, Kemba, Clarkson, Connaughton, KCP, Rozier, Hardaway Jr., Brogdon, Campazzo and FVV.   Guys who played fewer games and still have a higher vorp include Kyrie, Russ, Zach, Beal, Jrue, Mitchell, Conley, Jaylen, CJ, Terry, FVV, Brogdon, Fox, Shai, Jamal, both Ball brothers, Kemba, Haliburton, Lowry, Cam Payne, and Thybulle.  There is no reason for Booker to do so poorly in advanced stats across the board on such a good team where other guys do well in advanced stats. Not to mention his advanced stats were still incredibly low when he was a first option."
You wish Zach Lavine was Booker so fucking bad lmao
the dude that pick out these tweets for them to read must hate zach lavine
if I want to win a title I will take Mikal Bridges over Zach LaVine.
"Completely agree. Klay hasn't played in the last two years, which is why he isn't currently a top 5 SG in the league. Zach LaVine has played, and he's done incredibly. I'm not debating all time, only rn"
"Yes, but current Zach Lavine averaging 27.4/5/4.9 on 63.4 TS% is better than current Klay."
"Bulls are up there...  This is their current guaranteed roster:  Nikola Vucevic ($24,000,000) Zach LaVine ($19,500,000) Al-Farouq Aminu ($10,183,800) Patrick Williams ($7,422,000) Thaddeus Young ($6,000,000) Coby White ($5,837,760) Troy Brown ($5,170,564) Tomas Satoransky ($5,000,000)  And then Lauri Markkanen ($9,026,852 qualifying offer / $20,194,524 cap hold)  That’s basically the cap and they went 12-17 after the Vuc trade. He’s 30 and they have him on the books for two more years. They traded what became the 8th pick for him, along with Wendell Carter Jr., and their 2023 pick.  What do they do to get better? How do they become a high caliber team? Maybe Lauri and Lavine make a leap. I sure hope so, I’m rooting for them."
"What do you mean they gave up? They tried to win every game, only reason they didn’t make the play in was Zach Lavine was in COVID protocols"
Trade Zach Lavine for Ben Simmons
"I think he's gonna be good too. I don't think he's gonna be a guaranteed superstar though. people feel like he's gonna be Kobe, but I think Zach Lavine is a good high end comparison right now. I think you take that as the no.2 pick, he's amazing, I just feel like the other two are capable of just as much if not more.   honestly, all three are great but idk why Suggs doesn't get enough credit. dudes got stones on him, and I think he's just as capable as Green is, even if he is less athletic."
Zach LaVine. ACL and a Jim Boylen really hampered him so hes growing late
"Figures. Inferiority complex lol   And btw, ppl in this thread think Zach Lavine is better than Jason Tatum."
"Interestingly, Zach Lavine ranks 4th out of qualified shooting guards in PER according to Hollinger!   Not really sure how he qualifies it tho cause he has SGA as shooting guard even tho he was more so the PG for OKC this season  http://insider.espn.com/nba/hollinger/statistics/_/position/sg"
"Zach Lavine: 27.5/5/4.9 on .507/.419/.849 splits   Jayson Tatum: 26.4/7.4/4.3 on .459/.386/.868 splits.  Nothing there that says Tatum is better than Lavine, unless you value a couple extra rebounds over more scoring, passing and much better efficiency"
Zach Lavine is NOT better than Tatum lol I'll give you Dame and BB.
"&gt;who do you take out?  Zach LaVine.   I mean, even Conley made it in sooo..."
"Bulls, if you like sexy zach lavine and horrible fourth quarter collapses"
Bro you think Prime Kobe really averaging 25ppg in today’s league with Zach Lavine at 27? Do you mean he only plays 3 quarters?
Trying to find the best combination of dope name and actual skill/talent. Here's my starting 5:  PG - Russell Westbrook  SG - Zach LaVine  SF - DeMar DeRozan  PF - Zion Williamson  C - Bam Adebayo
"Ja Morant, Zach Lavine, and Anfernee Simons have crazy jumps."
Zach LaVine and John Wall.  I play them on 2K and they’re very good together lol
"Gotta compare career avg. or at least 2018-19 2019. KAT was injured A Ton of games this season so his numbers are pretty bad. But Zach is a close second for sure. I root for all 3 guys, but Zach is a big what if in Wolves mythology. Wiggs was just never lived up to his contract or the task of the needs of our admittedly shabby teams  I think KAT is better at what he's asked to do. I also think we never have seen KAT lead a good team like weve seen frpm Lavine. This was KATs chance to lead a good team this year, but he got injured right away.   Honestly, once KAT leaves Minny, we'll be talking about him like Anthony Davis. He'll win a chip and people will appreciatw hos talent so much."

Zach Lavine is only making 20 mil this season
"Zach LaVine, Julius Randle, Marcus Smart, Christian Wood, Royce ONeale, Seth Curry"
"Young Kobe was crazy athletic had a lot of highlight dunks and throughout his career was a great defender 8 time first team all-defense. Both Booker and Lavine emulate Kobe in their games. I just think Zach Lavine's athleticism, physical tools and defensive potential make him slightly more Kobe than Booker."
"I would say it's Zach Lavine. Young Kobe was crazy athletic had a lot of highlight dunks and throughout his career was a great defender 8 time first team all-defense. Both Booker and Lavine emulate Kobe in their games. I just think Zach Lavine's athleticism, physical tools and defensive potential make him slightly more Kobe than Booker."
"Zach Lavine for me, it’s so effortless and smooth it’s incredible to watch"
"like people don't get that ""empty stats"" describes Antoine Walker putting up 20/9 on 47% TS and terrible defense as the leading scorer on the 13-69 Hawks, not Zach LaVine averaging 27 points on 63% TS on a Bulls team that barely missed the play-in"
"i mean that's because they're usually considered to be stars, while role players are literally role players. Obviously you'll be more mad if Zach Lavine has a bad game vs Mikal Bridges having an off shooting night"
"Zach Lavine, LBJ and Anthony Edwards, just how high they jump. It is unbelievable. I would have put Ja too but most of the time he misses of them."
"When the Lakers manage to trade Kuzma and THT for James Harden, Kevin Durant and Zach Lavine"
Dominique for power Zach Lavine for grace.....Donovan Mitchell gets a nod from me because I never expect him to boom on people and he always does
All time... Vince Carter. Today... Zach LaVine.
&gt; You know that video of Zach Lavine learning how to not travel on the front page right now?   nah man haven't seen it
"Beal has all the leverage there too where he can say “trade me to Boston or I’m opting out” if he wants to play with Tatum, and I’m sure Washington will want something instead of nothing, so maybe I’m delusional but I think Fournier or Smart, Horford, 2 young players (basically whoever they want between Pritchard, Langford, Nesmith, Grant, Rob) and picks is enough to get it done, since that would match the $37M option almost exactly and if the agreement is to Boston (kind of like how Harden said trade me to Brooklyn or Philadelphia), it kind of forces Washington to buy low with the PO. Technically he can opt in and Washington can trade him elsewhere, but the risk in the modern NBA of organizations doing their franchise players dirty and reports coming out afterwards is not worth the bad PR. Look at how Boston is still recouping their image from the IT/Kyrie trade, with the whole AD’s dad thing, all the stuff this year. It just doesn’t send the right message to free agents or the rest of your own players when everyone becomes tradable, and doesn’t handle it like OKC has.  If Washington says no and Beal opts out, I think we can still trade guys we have/not pick up team options to clear the cap to outright sign him, although a trade would be more ideal to retain our own guys, and maybe the target would be someone else like Zach LaVine since his max would be cheaper than Beal’s. Either way, I think there’s a path and hopefully a plan next summer to get a max guy here to have a Big 3"
Pretty insane LaVine isn't the majority of the answers in this. Zach Lavine looks like he's gliding in the air every time. Smooth af.
Zach Lavine
I like Brogdon but he is an injury risk. Plus I don’t know if he takes you up to championship team level. I think the type of player philly needs is jimmy butler whom they are not getting. So the next best thing is demare derozan or kyle lowry. If they could get zach lavine he would be a good fit as well (like murray-joker pair). I don’t think you can win with sexton or the other names out there. It will be hard to convince people to trade a young asset for an old one but they may get draft picks and young players with derozan or lowry packages.
"Gerald Green, Zach Lavine, Russ"
Vince Carter and Zach Lavine. Miles Bridges is moving up the list
Zach Lavine easy his tomahawks and even the way he jumps are so clean
"Vince, McGrady, Paul George when he chooses to dunk, and Zach Lavine."
"I am speaking as a Bulls fan but we lost Lavine to COVID this season and had roughly the same win percentage as the Suns last year. How can a fan not be inspired by the Suns? We don’t have to win a chip next season but can’t wait to see the team compete. Other than giving us a top 4 pick in this draft (which isn’t happening) the Bulls have doubled down on Zach (and rightfully so, the guy is a scoring machine)"
"Both are athletic freaks, but Ant is a bit more of a power/explosive thicker body type and Green is leaner/lighter on his feet, looks more effortless like Zach LaVine.  IMO There's no reason KAT shouldn't get something like the Anthony Davis package. He's a top 3 center and really young who I think will look so much better on a winning team next to another superstar."
Which stat backs up Harden being important?  Kd literally led the Nets in on/off bro. The Nets had a higher offensive rating with Durant on the court than with harden. It’s 2021 and people still act like all Kd can do is score like he’s some Zach Lavine….Jesus fuck man.  Kd was also way more Important than Curry in the playoffs because of defense. Regular season is different
The Bulls were on-track to make the playoffs until Zach Lavine got into a late Health and safety protocol. They will have one full off-season with Billy Donovan (new coach last season) and also some time to gel with Vucevic who arrived with 1/3rd of the quarter left. The Bulls will potentially be rolling out a line up of Lonzo/Lavine/Patrick Williams/Thad/Vucevic as their starting 5. That's better than the Pacers and Knicks on paper.
"idk, as a bulls fan I think Lavine and Coby don't pass to him as much because he is really terrible at getting open along the perimeter. he often gets the ball 1-2 steps behind the 3 point line to get open and then just shoots from there. he is a good three point shooter, but I'd much rather have both Zach and Coby taking those downtown shots.   I think he can also be a really good player, but he really needs to adjust his game and take advantage of his size and strength more often. he is too big to be just a spot up shooter"
"&gt; They adapted this game, but this team wasn't tge same level as the French defense.  This is a bit much. They were up like 7 with a couple minutes to go and we wouldnt even be talking about this if they could hit one of like 2-3 wiiiiiiiiiiiide open looks at the end.  They definitely werent getting *easy* looks, but they got plenty of open-enough looks from behind the arc. It really wasnt as though they were being hounded most of the time, they were just missing. They also seemed really in their heads trying to ""move the ball"" that guys like Dame and Lavine who could easily break off do some work and drive just plain didnt. I mean, I cant even remember a non-Jrue drive. And those guys have more or less said as much.   France played very well but the US was just obviously out of rhythm and ice cold.   In any case I completely understand that there are differences with the games, but I think a bit much is being made within the specific contexts of the US playing. You may not see the specific ripping-type fouls or the 'stop and let the trailer run into you Trae Young special' fouls, but like 70% of the fouls are pretty similar. For God's sakes, its not as though this is the first time Americans have played under FIBA rules and it was hardly 1992 in 2016.   And again, I still dont see much reason why, with more physicality in the lane, bombing threes from whatever distance isnt a completely valid strategy to open things up. Guys like Dame, KD, Tatum, Zach have had zero problem taking shots from 5 feet even behind the NBA line. Heck KD doesnt even need to be 'open' to open."
"Yeah, people don't realize how much better we were looking after Vuc and LaVine started to gel. Then Zach had to go into covid protocol and that tanked our season."
Zach Randolph? Zach Lavine? Zyndrus Illgauskas? Zaza Pachulia? Zach Collins? Zan Tabak?
"Zach LaVine...  Is this bait, what the fuck"
"Plus/minus is not at all a consistent metric for defining one single player's impact when they're on the court.   Using that logic we can conclude that Bradley Beal, De'Aaron Fox, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Victor Oladipo, LaMelo Ball, Russell Westbrook, Buddy Hield and Zach LaVine are not NBA caliber talent, correct? After all, they all have a negative +/- on the season"
"yeah the obvious solution is for them to rely on being the best defensive team in the tournament, which I believe they should be despite their lack of size inside. they did a much better job in the second half of denying easy entries into post mismatches and mucking up the passing lanes in general, and I think that's their ticket to winning every game no matter what's going on from a half court offense perspective. give the US a live ball turnover and its 2 or 3 points almost every time.   why it's taking Zach Lavine of all people on that roster to fire them up defensively is beyond me, but if they keep that energy going they'll be in good shape. 👍  gonna be interesting to see how they defend Luka if they meet Slovenia... almost certainly they'll need to send doubles at him, and as you said the trust in guys to make their rotations properly will be key and that's probably the hardest thing to get working in such a short amount of time together."
"Right, so KD is going to bounce from Brooklyn after 3 years to play with Zach LaVine instead of Kyrie and Harden?"
"I wasn’t able to watch the whole game but in the 4th the announcers said that Zach Lavine was upset going into halftime and told everyone he’s going to up the intensity on defense and it seems like players players off that.   They also made it seem like the first half was more Pop’a coaching and 2nd half more reactionary. With the report that players want to play more reactionary rather than systematically I think that might’ve been a difference.   However, you need the established system and first half in order to play reactionary. If you know and trust everyone on the court and where they’re supposed to be then you can really play up to your own abilities."
Zach Lavine pumpfake never misses no matter what
that zach lavine three was hilarious lmao
Less athletic Zach Lavine
Playing like Zach Lavine out there
"Jalen Green is not quite as dynamite a prospect as I think people assume and is a much riskier prospect than Cade/Suggs/Mobley/Barnes.  First, players his size (under 200 pounds, SG height/length) are seldom superstars unless they are high PnR players.  Tough for traditional SGs (off ball scorers) to become superstars.  So his offensive upside isn't quite as high as guys with primary playmaker potential.  Second, he has kinda bad physical tools for becoming a high level defender - small, skinny, gonna be tough for him to navigate screens or defend big wings.  And physical strength is also hugely important on offense.  And Green low-key has a pretty good defensive motor for a pure scorer, his issues are not effort based on defense imo.  Third, G League stats can be a bit fool's gold, I think people overrate the quality of the league.  I think he is a really good prospect, but it is tough for players of his build and archetype to get that much better than Zach LaVine, even if Green is clearly better than LaVine was at the same age.  And LaVine is clearly not a guy you want as your best offensive player, teams like that have had issues on offense.  Given I don't think he will be a superstar based solely on offensive contributions, I'd take one of the two-way players who have the potential at least to create significant value for their team on both ends of the court.  My other unpopular opinion is that Davion Mitchell's game won't really translate and he'll fall out of fashion in Sacramento."
"Yeah you’re wrong, respectfully. Wiseman isn’t currently as valuable as Vuc or Lavine just bc of his draft position… he’s currently a neutral-to-negative asset with some upside for sure but doesn’t project to be better than EITHER of those players.. then you said Zach is worth a collection of draft picks and Wiggins contract to match… also wrong. You could MAYBE get one of those players for that package. there’s no universe where you get both."
"There are worse situations than starting with assets from trading a superstar and a 2nd overall pick in one of the best draft classes in recent memory.   Take my Bulls and AK, for example. A treasure trove of ill fitting 7th picks and Zach Lavine. The best luck the Bulls have had in the lottery since Rose was last years 4th pick in a draft where the top tier was made up of 3 guys.   They've done a great job but I've got no tears for this man."
All I know is that there are a lot of people over Zach Lavine who should not be.
"Coby is a terrible point guard, he’s much more of a shooting guard, Sato is likely getting traded, Archi is probably not getting re-signed, Lavine is a pure SG that we want to play offball more, Temple plays 2/3 for us, and Valentine is absolute garbage and he’s definitely not getting re-signed.  That leaves us with Zach Coby and Temple. No point guards and one of the weakest backcourt rotations in the league"
booker have some experience with FIBA rules because he was part of the 2016 select team. i think he should have been called before zach lavine or beal
"Yeah, one of the best pick and roll players in the world and a natural distributor definitely wouldn't have been a fit for the TEN FUCKING ISO PLAYERS they chose instead. ""You don't just go because you're good""...ok, then why is Zach LaVine there? Tatum? Booker? These guys are just slightly different versions of one another, all young as well. Let's just call it like it is: Team USA did a shitty job building the roster, and the only way they get around it is if these guys all buy in to playing completely differently than they have ever been asked to do to this point in their careers because they don't have any specialists or role players."
"Lonzo Ball, Zach Lavine, Luka Doncic.   This must happen. It is inedible."
The guy looks like if Zach LaVine and Donovan Mitchell had a son
"I think Zach Lavine is the one. He might not be as deep a scorer as Lavine yet, but dude has potential for much better playmaking and defense."
"Kobe but if Kobe grew up shooting 3s has long been the comparison for Jalen. Obviously Jalen doesn't really have Kobe's mentality (not to say he doesn't love the game or work hard but he's not straight sociopath like Kobe or MJ).   I also like upgraded Zach Lavine, which is a very scary prospect."
Lol. He actually reminds of Zach Lavine a little bit.
Bouknight the saddest looking draftee since Zach Lavine lol
"Zach Lavine and Vucevic for Wiggins, Wiseman, 7th, 14th, and 3 future 1sts. Lets do it!"
That was a Zach Lavine-esque reaction by Suggs
"What if, when they did their player comparisons, they would show the NBA player when that guy was coming out of the draft? For example, Jalen Green was compared to Zach Lavine. Personally, I would think it would be cool if, instead of the Zach Lavine we see now putting up 26 a game, we saw clips of Lavine when he was at UCLA. Thoughts?"
Zach Lavine is extremely far from being the baseline for an average offensive player is getting paid. It’s clear that your perceptions of player values is just extremely off so I will not continue to reply to you.
"He’s got a non existent anything but in the paint game, and he’s horrific from the foul line. I would baseline Zach lavine as a player getting paid who is on the average side. The bulls wouldn’t trade lavine for Simmons idt. Even with Simmons on a huge defensive advantage"
"""Zach LaVine on possible extension with Bulls: 'I want to be here long term'"" https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/zach-lavine-on-possible-extension-with-bulls-i-want-to-be-here-long-term/amp/"
"Alright here’s a fun, never gonna happen but would be cool hot take: The Bulls, no matter what off-season they have, will not come out of the east this year with the nets, bucks, 6ers, heat, etc built the way they are this year. I love em but it’s just not happening. Knowing and accepting this opens a crazy door.   Bulls receive:  4th OVR (TOR)  7th OVR (GSW)  James Wiseman  Gary Trent (S&amp;T)  Raptors receive:  Zach Lavine Andrew Wiggins 14th OVR (GSW)  Warriors receive: OG Anunoby Nicola Vucevic  This gives the bulls the perfect opportunity to start a super charged rebuild featuring White, Trent jr, PAW and wiseman + the 4th and 7th pick  This gives the Raptors a bonafide chance to compete in the east (this is where I’ll take the most hate), but FVV, Lavine, Wiggins, Siakam coached by Nick Nurse has a chance to compete in the east IMO. 14 is also a nice compensation all considered.   For the warriors it is the perfect last chance at the classic dynasty to compete. OG is the perfect wing in that offence and VUC is the perfect centre. They’d be well over the luxury tax but that team will still make money if competing.   Thank you for coming to my Ted talk."
"I actually think he’s really valuable these days precisely because he’s good at everything except initiating the offense.  He won’t take touches away from guys like Zach Lavine, Tatum, Luka or lebron.  Instead, he’ll defend point guards well, hit open shots, move the ball along quickly and intelligently, and periodically give you freebie transition buckets.  He’s not a liability at really anything anymore because of the strides he has taken with his spot up shooting and free throws.    Edit:  Not needing the basketball to have an impact is incredibly valuable in the nba today."
"We got back Zach Lavine, meanwhile Butler spent 1 season in Minnesota and burned the house down on his way out to Philly"
"I was curious, so I looked up how many teams have been able to draft an all-star outside the top ten picks of the draft since 2013. Here's the complete list.  Denver - Jokic and potentially MPJ  LAC - SGA  Miami - Bam and maybe Herro  Milwaukie - Giannis  Minnesota - Zach Lavine  OKC - Sabonis  Phoenix - Booker  Toronto - Siakam  Utah - Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert  Honorable mentions  Atlanta - No but John Collins is close  Kings - Potentially Haliburton in the future  That's an average of a little more than one all-star per year. Again, I'm intending to defend Neil Olshey here, but so many blazers fans have it in their head that we were ""just a good pick"" away from contending, as though any team is able to consistently find all-stars at the back half of the draft."
He literally said he would take Zach LaVine over Giannis but go on.
Honestly though which team is better?  2020 US Olympics team vs 2020 US players not participating  2020 Team:  Bam Adebayo  Devin Booker  Keldon Johnson  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Draymond Green  Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine  Damien Lilaird  Javalle McGee  Khris Middleton  Jayson Tatum    NOT PARTICIPATING:  Lebron James  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Steph Curry  Chris Paul  Bradley Beal  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Julius Randle  Russell Westbrook
Zach Lavine
"Luka gets to play his game on his national team. Of course he’s going to look like his usual self when he is the leader of the team.   You really think someone like KD wouldn’t put up monster numbers if he didn’t have to worry about Zach LaVine or Jaysom Tatum getting shots? Same thing could apply to any of the offensive stars on USA.   My point is, none of these guys need to foul-bait to score. They do it because they know that’s how it’s called.   It’s gonna be hilarious when the USA still wins gold and everyone will conveniently forget they said shit like “USA needs to foul-bait to win!”"
I legit can see Zach Lavine averaging 30/6/5 on 50/40/90 5th seed bulls and winning mvp
Zach Lavine is the only one with a chance.
pls all i want is one Zach Lavine :(
I'm worried for the safety of Zach LAVINE vs Iran
Remember also when the Kings offered Zach Lavine 80 million over 4 years and everyone was saying it was way too much?
"It actually makes a ton of sense. For a teams with one player that is clearly the best, they have the ability to run a pretty traditional offense. Star play gets fed the ball, everyone else plays their role. Problem with team USA is you they have a bunch of dudes who are the stars for their team. It's a lot harder to tell Devin Booker or Zach Lavine that their role is to defend and space the floor."
Hope they liked that one appearance as an 8th seed seeing as it cost them prime Zach LaVine
Can’t lead an offense.  Very much like a second Zach lavine
Zach LaVine for 2022 free agency purposes.
"My 6’6” Line up can run with anybody PG - Zach LaVine, SG - Klay Thompson, SF - Jaylen Brown, PF - DeMar DeRozen, C - Draymond Green"
"&gt;That said, any metric that ranks the KAT pick better than the Giannis and George selections is a broken metric.  I don't think it's fair to call the metric broken just because one funny result. Any quantitative measure will produce a couple weird results, but in this case, I think 99% of the scores are very reasonable.  The reason KAT has a high score is because he's a great player and the players drafted after him (the alternatives) sucked. The reason he isn't actually that great of a draft pick is because he was a *consensus* \#1 pick, and thus it didn't really take any ""skill"" to draft KAT. For example, if Anthony Bennett turned out great, it would be fair for him to have a great score despite being #1 overall since Cleveland took a huge chance drafting him.   It's a fair issue with the methodology--one that I'm aware of, but haven't thought of a good way to correct. The best way would likely to be measure the level of ""consensus"" on every draft pick, and discount draft scores that are widely agreed upon. I haven't yet figured out how to do that well.  &gt;You need to somehow incorporate a comparison to the average value at each draft slot, AND maybe some sort of overall adjustment for the draft classes themselves.  I disagree that this is a good solution. It would pretty much undermine the entire methodology.  It doesn't matter how good the average 10th overall pick is, because you don't have the option to draft an average 10th overall pick. You can only draft the players available that year at that position. Even adding a modifier for draft strength doesn't solve this, since draft strength can be top-heavy or bottom-heavy (it doesn't matter if the draft was strong in the 1-5 range if you're drafting 10th, right?).  &gt;Likewise, all the picks that came before someone like Jokic, a historical anomaly in the draft, should not be rated poorly.  They aren't? This methodology was specifically designed to go easy on 2nd round picks that miss good players. The draft picks before him receive a pretty small penalty for missing out on Jokic. The 38th and 39th overall picks (Jokic went 41st) actually still achieve good draft scores.  &gt;For example, Zach Lavine at 14 that year should still be considered a smart pick, though I suspect it is rated pretty poorly by this metric.  LaVine receives basically zero penalty for missing out on Jokic since Jokic was drafted so far away from him."
"Thanks, good luck.  I want to see a team of Zach LaVine and Vuc succeed honestly.  I think both guys are pretty underrated.  Vuc taking a game from the bucks as an 8th seed was awesome.  He’s got a higher ceiling than a lot seem to think."
"Interesting concept and some compelling results. Jokic, Giannis, and George track as some of the very best picks of the decade. That said, any metric that ranks the KAT pick better than the Giannis and George selections is a broken metric. That rating makes me pretty skeptical about all the conclusions drawn about each team honestly.   You need to somehow incorporate a comparison to the average value at each draft slot, AND maybe some sort of overall adjustment for the draft classes themselves.   The KAT pick shouldn’t be rated as an elite selection solely because he was in an awful draft class and no one taken after him is any good. Give them some credit for that, but not that much credit.   Likewise, all the picks that came before someone like Jokic, a historical anomaly in the draft, should not be rated poorly. For example, Zach Lavine at 14 that year should still be considered a smart pick, though I suspect it is rated pretty poorly by this metric."
"or because fournier played 13 minutes more than kd? (more than an entire quarter more), and because KD has other scoring options on his team such as Zach Lavine, Bam, Lillard, Tatum, Booker, Holiday? Frances second top score was gobert"
Idk. Would you not have traded Zach Lavine for Zion?
"&gt; on a trash team.   Why do people say this like it makes said player *better*? If anything it adds more question marks. Obviously the only shooting option star player is going to be, yknow, the only one scoring points. Same shit happened with Tobias Harris and Zach LaVine up until recently for example.   SGA is for sure an excellent player and the trade makes no sense to me, to be clear"
"Relax man. I’m not personally insulting you or saying that booker lost the suns both games.   the degree of difficulty of bookers shot making is insane and it’s really difficult to be efficient consistently with the way he plays. Also hard to make long twos draw help and start defensive rotations which leads to the really valuable outside shooting from teammates. I’m not saying he’s not good, but I am saying I don’t think he’s a top 10-15 player. I would have him much closer to brad Beale/ Zach Lavine than luka, Kd, etc."
"Rotation needs to be cut down by a lot. No need to be playing Keldon Johnson 9 mins. KD was in a bit of foul trouble vs France which can explain why he only played 20 mins, but he needs to be playing 30+ in important games going forward. One of Bam/Draymond needs to be on the floor at all times in any important game. I really don’t see the need for Lavine to be starting or even playing at all. Middleton, Holiday, and Booker are strictly better and should take over all of his minutes by the elimination stage.   The next two games for Team USA should be easy to win, so Pop should use those 2 games to get a fixed gameplay/style of play and to find the right number of players in the shortened rotation. The biggest problem is there is no identity with this team. It’s not even the lack of chemistry - it’s not like Luka played with Mike Tobey prior to the Olympic Qualifying Tournament. Matisse Thybulle never played with Australia prior to the Olympics. The Nigeria team that beat Team USA in the exhibition had even fewer reps playing with each other than the US team did. It’s just that guys like Mike Tobey and Matisse Thybulle know their role.   Players like Jayson Tatum, Zach Lavine, Devin Booker, etc. don’t know their role on this team - it needs to be made clear to them they play defense and play more of a 3rd/4th option to KD/Lillard on offense or they get benched. That’s why it’s easier for Jrue Holiday to adjust - he already played this role with the Bucks, unlike the other stars who were #1 options on their teams. And if you don’t want to bench or threaten to bench Jayson Tatum or Zach Lavine for the entire game because they are “too good” be benched, well that’s why they won’t win."
Zach LaVine is a very good shooter and shot extremely efficiently this season
I'd rather have Zach Lavine than Kawhi Leonard
"Pop needs to actually just tell the players that KD is the #1 option, Lillard is the #2 option and everyone else play like role players. That means Jayson Tatum will only be spacing the floor/spotting  up/playing defense from now on. Zach Lavine will only be taking open jump shots/focusing on defense…etc. The only issue is I only see Draymond, Bam, Jrue Holiday, and possibly Middleton understanding this concept though (I guess Keldon and Jeremi Grant might but they just aren’t good enough).   This next game (since the USA is guaranteed to win) would be a good time to practice this concept in the first few quarters where Durant clearly is the lead dog and everyone else plays more specialized roles. Look how Luka played with Slovenia last night. This is how Team USA should structure their team, with clearly a pecking order. And it’s not like Luka had much “chemistry” with guys like Mike Tobey beforehand so this isn’t some chemistry issue that doesn’t affect other teams (Nigeria beat Team USA and their team is even newer than the one USA has). Otherwise players like Lavine and possibly even Tatum, despite how good he might be, should get benched imo since they don’t offer anything extra of value."
"This is such a weird way to ask the simple question: Has medicine, technology, training/resting methods, and analytics improved from the 1960s-1990s vs today so that if you take the same player from an earlier era but give him all the benefits of 2010s-2020s knowledge/technology, would he be a better player today? And the answer of course is yes.   I mean this is true literally in any sport and in any field. People were still sending physical letters in the 1980s and now it’s email/instant messaging. Today you can create a new vaccine for an unknown disease within a year whereas it probably would never be made with 1980s technology. You can potentially see humans flying to Mars soon when just 60 years ago, people hadn’t even flown to the moon…etc.   But I have no idea why you need to involve Zach Lavine and MJ."
"OP just stop, don't ever post a thread here again.  Don't ever mention Zach Lavine in the same breath as Michael Jordan."
NBA has better competition now but that doesn't mean Zach LaVine is equal or better than MJ.
Clint Capela and Zach Lavine
Ah yes the Zach Lavine route of averaging 27.5/5/5 on 51/42/85 splits I would hate that so much…
SGA. They're hyping him up to be some All-NBA player when I just see him going the Zach Lavine route and certainly not the player I'd build a championship team with.
Why you delete your Zach Lavine post?
I don't get the Zach Lavine thirst. He looks like a corpse imo.
Zach Lavine fa sho
Zach Lavine
I would honestly take Ingram over maybe zach lavine or jeremi grant or another redundant 2 guard for the Olympic squad; homie long as fuck and can handle + shoot + stay quick on his feet. Idk I really can't tell what this USA team needs
"I think one problem that I hear no one talking about is what’s the point of Zach Lavine. Don’t get me wrong he deserves to be an Olympian but his play style doesn’t match what the team needs. So let’s assume USA continue to play this quick motion 5 out iso style, why would I give lavine the iso when I could give it to KD or lillard. I remember during the exhibition games USA got a rebound and the ball was swinging but the moment it went to lavine at the top he just dribbled and went iso against 2 defenders in help when he could’ve swung it to the wing where the baseline was empty. I just think a better option was to bring a point guard who’s maybe not an all star but still a point guard over lavine. Idk just thoughts"
"Lakers Twitter after seeing this:  Dennis Schroder sign-and-trade for Zach LaVine might be a bit of an overpay, but if we want him, we can have him."
Is that a Zach Lavine issue or are the Bulls just not a good team/organization?
zach lavine is in tokyo not seattle
"Jamal Crawford's ProAm league he hosts in Seattle. A lot of Seattle/Washington-based players like to go there like Isaiah Thomas, Zach Lavine, etc which brings in non-Seattle/Washington-based players like Poole. There was even a game between KPJ and Dejounte Murray there yesterday: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9hDy7cgAAs"
"Lavine ain't leaving tho. There have been multiple reports suggesting he wants to stay and sign the max. He hasn't even played a full season with vuc yet.   Unless we absolutely shit the bed and are in the bottom 3 by ASB and Zach is seriously unhappy, I don't us trading him or Zach requesting a trade ."
Jalen Green either be Zach Lavine or Dahntay Jones
Zach Lavine
"Lavine 2022 if we are not talking about pipe dream. same agent, next year being FA, in prime, fit mold as 2nd star even as 1B player, bucket getter.  pls Bill Duffy, get both of them in same room and make them kiss  also cmon zach, no disrespect to bulls and their players. But, do you want spend your prime with Zo and Vuc, rather than Luka? cmon brah."
"The One-Two Punch Bulls dynasty, following the big 3 who can't shoots 3s after hiring a run and gun coach in Hoiberg era. Then followed by a brief Markkanen finna make Porzingis look like tingus pingus era, followed by the ""look, I'm not saying Playoff Rondo is a real thing, but playoff rondo is a real thing"" era, followed by the ""we would have won that series if Rondo didn't get hurt era"", into the egghead fuck it's boylen time era, to now, the ""zach lavine looks like a fuckboy who takes selfies squinting biting his lower lip but I love him"" era"
"More times than the amount of points that Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Zach LaVine and Jrue Holiday combined for today (47)."
"How was it debunked? There isn't a bizarre lack of effort because, like I have mentioned multiple times now, there were two offensive rebounds before that last shot, so arguing about not hustling enough for offensive rebounds seems like a fairly idiotic statement. And on the last shot Zach LaVine is in offensive rebounding position. If the shot misses it is most likely to bounce right in his area."
"As a Bulls fan, I always get a mini heart attack every time Zach Lowe is mentioned here. I always read it as Zach Lavine"
"I agree but I mean that is relative to their athleticism. My thinking is, because they dont jump very high anyway they naturally have a lower jump. My thinking is, that Giannis should allow himself to jump more on his as it creates that dip and sway for *his* body. Hence why I think Jordan, Kobe, and Ray Allen jumped so high. I dont think it was a conscious choice, I think its just what came naturally to them. Hell, look at Zach Lavine, he gets a decent amount of hang time, which makes sense considering his vert."
Lol. Again. Literally haven't even mentioned Zach Lavine. But you seem to be a fan boy...so really no sense in arguing with that.
I think Zach LaVine can lead the league in scoring on great efficiency and bring the bulls to the playoffs
Choose the bulls we have zach lavine he’s so cool
"Washington State:  PG: Dejounte Murray  SG: Avery Bradley  SF: Zach Lavine  PF: Michael Porter Jr  C: Jaden McDaniels  Reserves:  Jaden McDaniels, Kevin Porter, Malachi Flynn, CJ Elleby, Jaylen Nowell, Joe Harris, Isaiah Thomas, Corey Kispert, Robert Franks, Paolo Banchero (Need some size).   Notes:  Michael Porter Jr only played senior year in Seattle so not sure if he really counts.   Avery Bradley played his senior year in Vegas but was at a prep school so I don’t really count it."
"To be fair I would expect a lineup with KD, Dame, Devin Booker and Zach Lavine to be able to make something. Not like they put scrubs out there instead of Middleton"
How many All-NBA players are on Team USA this year? 3.5 (if you count that KD makes it playing all year). Out of 10/11 Americans on the All NBA teams.  I don't think this Team USA says very much about the NBA's best stars because they're generally not a part of it.  Zach Lavine and Devin Booker would be like the equivalents of Mitch Richmond and Glen Rice. I see no reason to compare them to Jordan and Pippen.
"Missed the original broadcast, and I just started the replay...Team USA looking very disorganized to start and Zach Lavine looking kind of useless"
"Firstly, it's three consecutive seasons of serious injury issues. Doesn't have to be season ending to have injury affect play.  **Players definitively better than Westbrook (23)**  Embiid, Harden, Kyrie, KD, Giannis, Middleton, Trae Young, Tatum, Butler, Beal, Gobert, Mitchell, Chris Paul, Booker, Jokic, Kawhi, Paul George, Luka, Lillard, LeBron, AD, Curry, KAT,  If you disagree with any player on this list, we just have fundamental differences in how we understand basketball.  **Players that rank around where Westbrook is (15)**  Simmons, Holiday, Randle, Bam, Jaylen Brown,  Sabonis, Brogdon, Zach Lavine, Kyle Lowry, Siakam, CJ McCollum, Ja Morant, Demar Derozan, Zion, Dearon Fox.  Notable omissions from this list include Jamal Murray and Klay Thompson.  I personally have him behind pretty much everyone except McCollum, and DeRozan which puts him number 37.  If just half the guys on the second list are better (ranking them is splitting hairs), Westbrook is in that 30-45 range that I have him at.  If you list the players like that it really isn't that outrageous  or disrespectful to have Westbrook where I have him.   If you have him better than everyone on the second list, which puts him at 24, I'll just think you're a biased fan."
Zach Lavine doesn’t flop.
"These are the guys that are getting around 20 million a year. W/o even going into how the good ones aren't easily available, one of these guys + the 4th pick is straight up worse than Simmons. Realistically that 20 million isn't going to get you more than two decent role players, I'd still take Simmons  Nikola Vucevic, C	Chicago Bulls	$24,000,000  Julius Randle, PF	New York Knicks	$21,780,000  Malcolm Brogdon, PG	Indiana Pacers	$21,700,000  Gary Harris, SG	Orlando Magic	$20,482,143  Danilo Gallinari, PF	Atlanta Hawks	$20,475,000  Jerami Grant, SF	Detroit Pistons	$20,002,500  Domantas Sabonis, PF	Indiana Pacers	$19,800,000  Fred VanVleet, SG	Toronto Raptors	$19,675,926  Zach LaVine, SG	Chicago Bulls	$19,500,000  Goran Dragic, PG"
"Guys, I think Kevin Durant, Zach LaVine and Devin Booker each had more fouls than field-goals vs France."
"There are a few for me actually. I like watching the Spurs, Hornets, Jazz, Bulls. Spurs because of their game, Hornets because of Hayward and recently LaMelo, Jazz because of Mitchell, and Bulls because of Zach LaVine."
bruh. our offense is atrocious but you're right about second part. Kemba is a worse playmaker than zach lavine and zach is a shooting guard  our defense is okay. our offense is bad.
"Terance Mann is a consistent 3 away from being PatBev 2.0. They had him guard Zach Lavine the other day.  He gets a ton of boards for a guard, but his 3 is just not there yet."
"Not sure why you’re getting downvoted. Lavine is a good player. But he’s never going to be any better than the third best player on a team if they want to have championship aspirations.   The league is too talented now. You can’t just be good at one thing to really impact winning. Zach is a good scorer and that’s really it. He’s not a good defender, he’s not a good passer, he’s not a special rebounder. He’s a very good scorer and that is fine but idk why we gotta try and make players into something they’re not."
I really find it hard to believe that Zach LaVine has more than Troy Hudson but he does
Yea thats how bad I think this bulls roster would be without lavine. I doubt we even win 10 games without Zach tbh. He pretty much is the whole team.
Yea it says he has a bad team.  The bulls arent bad because of Zach. The bulls are bad because they have no talent around him. Also please don't use on/off stats for lavine. Our bench with lavine is so much better than our actual starters with lavine lol. We just start our young guys rather then having them come off the bench.  Pretty clear you don't watch the bulls if you think lavine has empty stats. Sorry.
*Wheres* the complaint?   &gt;I'm not here to say anything other than Zach Lavine is indeed leading his team in rebounds.
Zach Lavine leads the bulls in rebounding. Thats a fact. You can easily look it up.  And if you're mistaking it for rebounds per game then you need to actually read what people write because you're assuming things that aren't true.
I think a lot of it comes down to Lauri too. His first season or 2 it looked like him and Zach were gonna be a great duo and I remember they had a game where they both scored 35 and the future looked bright. Then Lauri started getting injured and when he does play he's nothing like what he looked like he could have been. Coby Lavine and a good Lauri would be a really solid core that could hopefully attract free agents now that we have a real coach and FO
"*Averages arent totals*. He didn't say he leads the team in average rebounds, he said he leads the team in rebounds. Injured players are on the team, but with less total rebounds. I'm not here to say anything other than Zach Lavine is indeed leading his team in rebounds."
Zach LaVine.
"Ibaka, Blake Griffin, Zach Lavine, Pascal Siakam. I’m sure there are some more I’m forgetting. I think Rondo has come along way too. You can’t disrespect him and play off like people used to."
"Beal is definitely fun to watch, and is a great player, but I think it's funny we give him a pass on not being able to carry a team. We don't hold him to the same standard as the top tier guys in the league. Imagine if Harden, Kawhi, Dame, or even Jokic or Paul George didn't even come close to making the playoffs 3 years in a row. I used to think he was entering top 15-20 player status, but I'm starting to think he's closer to Zach Lavine than Dame Lillard."
"I feel that a lot of the NBA journalists have a negative bias towards Lavine for some reason, Nick Friedell argued that Chicago has no players with all star potential just last week. I don’t understand how they can all accept that Beal is a superstar, but can’t even acknowledge that Zach is an all star."
I’m saying it’s not like it was a Zach Lavine situation where he was putting good stats and nothing was happening no he got the team to the playoffs that deserved some all nba consideration
"Zach Lowe said LaVine was worse than FVV, certified clown indeed"
Zach Lavine played like five mins with an acl
I'd say that Zach Lavine is the only notable example of a player drastically improving with the Wolves recently.  Outside of that KAT turned himself into a 40% high volume 3 point shooter after his rookie season but it's hard to say if the Wolves played any part in that.  If we want to go further back KLove and Garnett improved drastically when playing with the Wolves but again it's hard to give credit to the Wolves when maybe those players would've been great regardless.
"Players in top 20 in scoring and TS%:  Steph Curry, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Paul George, Zach LaVine.  that’s it. Insane how disrespected he is"
"In Zach's podcast, they have a big Lavine-Trae debate.  Zach says its close but the deciding factor is that Trae is just on another level from a playmaking standpoint. They're both great scorers and really bad defensive players, but Trae consistently creates more for his teammates, by a solid margin."
How about Zach Lavine. IMO he’s better than trae right now
"With the exception of Joe Harris, Steph Curry and Buddy Hield (reigning 3pt champ); Terry Rozier must be looking pretty likely to be invited to the 3pt shootout over the all star break. He’s a bloody flamethrower right now.  There are 4 other spots remaining, I’d assume Zach Lavine, Paul George and Damian Lillard get in but there is a hell of a lot of competition for that last spot e.g. Beasley, Mitchell, Vucevic, Bogdanovic, Middleton, Robinson, Trent Jr, Hardaway Jr etc."
"Also, Harden has won MVP. What does this guy want? Curry’s more popular than Harden so he generally gets better press but this dude is acting like he gets treated like Zach Lavine.   Nobody’s going to blow Harden in the media cause until last year he was shooting barely 40% from the field and 30% from 3 in the playoffs as the head of his team."
"I just don’t think ingram is good enough to be the best player on a good team.  He’s sort of like the wing version of Zach Lavine. Good scorer on solid efficiency, but doesn’t do anything else well.  Zion is so unique that I don’t know what he can be, but I know that his upside his much higher and yes, he should be the first option for the Pelicans."
Zach LaVine!
Zach Lavine is pretty cute. Same with Monté Morris. Daniel Gafford is alright too. Luka would look even better if he lost a bit of weight.

"I like to watch Zach LaVine highlights... he’s got a good shooting form, and a high flyer."
That was like Zach LaVine of the day. I love when shooters are shooting well.
"Hyperbole. He doesn't have the hops that compare to the Zach Lavine and DJJ, at this point."
Fake all star Kmid. Give me Zach Lavine!
"The bulls were also missing 3 starters, not that the clippers aren’t far better.   It’s crazy that Zach Lavine took 21 shots and scored 26 but didn’t get a single fta.   Just like when he scored 46 the other day with only 3 ftas. That’s ridiculous."
"Everyone plays Pelicans then gets into a crazy hot streak the next few games. De'Aaron Fox, Zach Lavine, now KP. lol"
he’ got zach lavine and andrew wiggins mix. Also Kuminga gotta be the #2 prospect in this draft
He's got Zach Lavine vibes in him
I wouldn’t call him good yet but Zach LaVine is in the process of becoming a good defender
"Really interesting how certain picks have huge bumps in value when compared to neighboring picks. 7th, 9th, 10th, 13th, 18th, 21st, 23rd, 24th. 7th was no surprise to me given Steph (even though the chart's from 2014), but also has guys like Luol Deng, Eric Gordon, Rip Hamilton, Chris Mullin. 9th is loaded with Dirk, Amar'e, Shawn Marion, DeMar, Iggy, Kemba. 10th has Paul Pierce, Paul George, Joe Johnson, CJ McCollum, Brook Lopez. 13th already looks good recently given Herro and Booker, but also has Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine and of course Kobe. Good spot to draft a SG I guess.  18th, 21st, 23rd, and 24th seem a bit random. 18th has above-average role players/1-time All-Stars with BJ Armstrong, David West, JR Smith, Eric Bledsoe. 21st has Michael Finley and Rajon Rondo, and I like Brandon Clarke and Tyrese Maxey from recent classes. 23rd is represented mostly by Tayshaun Prince. 24th has Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Serge Ibaka, and Derek Fisher.  I wonder if there's actually added value to holding these specific picks in that they are often the beneficiary of teams above them passing on certain types of talent. The ones towards the end of the 1st could also benefit from being typically selected by the league's better teams, meaning those picks go into higher-functioning organizations that are able to properly support their draft picks, and also likely have specific holes for their 1st round pick to fill in a mostly constructed roster.  It's also possibly that there's simply not enough compiled league data to truly draw conclusions about any of these outliers. They could possibly all fall back to the mean given like 50 more years of the NBA."
I can start Zach Lavine or Donovan Mitchell in fantasy today who should I start?
And Zach Lavine continues to be disrespected despite putting up just as good numbers despite having a way worse supporting cast
Those are Zach LaVine numbers!
"One of the worst defenders in the league and these bozos are saying he's at the top 😂    Embiid is the best, then there's a slew of other guys like PG, Kawhi, Conley, and Butler.     The fact that people are saying KD and Zach Lavine and Jayson Tatum speaks volumes to the state of this sub"
"The maximum-impact title (if it fits) would be something like:  ""Six players have multiple games with 10+ threes.  Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, JR Smith, James Harden, and Zach LaVine have 16 combined.  Steph Curry has 17."""
Zach Lavine's numbers are virtually indistinguishable from Curry's. Zach Lavine MVP!
"Damn, those are Zach LaVine type numbers"
"I'd also have Zach at 5, but behind Mitchell.  For me it's Harden &gt; Brown &gt; Beal &gt; Mitchell &gt; LaVine &gt; Booker &gt; Holiday &gt; McCollum &gt; SGA.  I'm not including injured players (Klay) or guys that Bball ref lists as SGs who don't really play that role (Van Vleet).  If you consider Paul George a SG then slot him in at #2"
KD  BI  MPJ  Zach Lavine?  Kyrie?
"He's like Zach Lavine last year, great numbers, but team is not winning at all, and he is way too low down the totem pole for him to get in"
Curry has much better advanced stats than Zach Lavine and its not even close. Almost doubles him in BPM and VORP and is 50% higher in win shares per 48.  Saying their stats are the same is insanely incorrect.
"Zach Lavine and Kyrie's stats look vert similar to his so people assume they're equal lol no disrespect to both player though, they're elite ballers"
"Hm? The guy I was responding to was doing a hypothetical without Curry. Currently they're just missing Klay and Curry is that PG/playmaker for the team. Yes they still need one of the bench, but just removing Curry would obviously crush the team.  Lakers without AD and Lebron are probably a 15-20 team too. Most teams without their two best players are not gonna that great, regardless of supporting cast.   Point is Curry has been phenomenal and yes they need him, but even with the unreal stats that alone doesn't make him a MVP, which is what this thread was about. As someone else mentioned, those are Zach Lavine numbers. I don't think Lavine would be a MVP candidate if he had a .500 record either, so there's no real reason for Curry to be either. That doesn't mean they don't deserve credit or that they're teams underperforming is their fault, it just means they're not in contention for MVP."
"The last time bradley beal was in the playoffs, the wizards had a starting lineup of John Wall, Beal, markieff morris and Marcin gortat with Kelly oubre coming off the bench.   None of the bulls teams Lavine has played on have been even close to that. Minny Zach is a completely different player than 2021 Zach."
"man, I've loved LaVine for a long time. I was a big fan and def didn't think he'd get to this level, but even then, I wanted us to trade Wiggins in the JB deal instead of Zach. I don't know if the Wolves would be a lot better with a Zach/KAT combo (would DLo be on the team in this alternate universe? who knows), but I'll tell ya they'd be more fun"
"Oh my, an actual professional, so impressive.  It’s really impressive that you know about an analysis that’s done for every regression statistic except basketball stats, and in doing so let’s you absolve any stat of having meaning, so you can simply use your eye test as a better indicator.  What does a western conference player - who btw is currently the leading scoring on 15-9 team that beat the bucks yesterday - have to do with Zach Lavine making it in the East?"
"Extending Wiggins and then trading away the Markannen pick and Zach Lavine for Jimmy Butler fucked them over.  And then trading up for culver when they could have stayed put and got pj washington, brandon clarke, or tyler herro."
"Lmfao “explain post estimation testing” how far are you reaching here to try to prove, what exactly? That you’re a college student in a statistics class so you think you’re smart, yet your arguments are:  1. Counting stats  2. Everyone who doesn’t think your team is awesome is dumb  3. A guy points out Lavine has awful catch all stats, so that guy must prove he can explain exactly why the stat is good to make the argument that a player isn’t as good as someone else thinks.  Really great takes here.  I’m not a statistics student - and I haven’t been in college for years, but I do know that these statistical amalgamations are much better indicators of player skill than counting stats, that in 2021 are almost entirely worthless.  Zach Lavine averages more PPG than lebron, so wHy WoUlD I EvEr TrUsT tHaT  You love Zach Lavine, think the bulls who are heading towards another .300 season are awesome, and anyone who disagrees isn’t a fan and is stupid. Got it, when he doesn’t make the all star team no one smart bats at an eye at it, have fun being upset."
"Oh great... another stat geek who probably hasn’t attended a single econometrics class in his life is citing a bunch catch-all stats without post estimation test results. Cool.  And RAPTOR WAR, seriously? That thing currently has FVV, Jerami Grant, and John Collins to be above Kevin Durant and Giannis btw. A really solid stat from 538.   And fyi, Booker and Lavine are ranked at exactly same spot — 76. So going by RAPTOR WAR, if Zach and Booker were to switch teams, the Suns and the Bulls would still be at the same spot record-wise. So if the currently 15-9 Suns has Zach instead of Booker, would that make Zach an all star?"
"Hey, at least you guys have Zach LaVine right now. I'm also high on Patrick Williams, things are looking up in the post-Boylen era."
Almost as sad as believing Trae young is “nowhere near” Zach Lavine
Replace cp3 with Mitchell and probably add devin booker  Simmons is not making it this year put someone like trae young or Zach Lavine instead   I’m a wizards fan but Russell Westbrook probably won’t make it unless he steps it up these next few games
"Raptor isn’t a perfect stat, I’m not arguing that.  I’m arguing that FVV - who’s played a more pivotal role in helping his team win, and is by far rated higher than Zach Lavine in all the impact metrics, has had a better season than Zach Lavine.  I never said raptor was a substitute for player rankings or that FVV is better than the guys you named.   None of those guys rank in the 100+ range of the impact metrics like Lavine does."
damn that kid is putting up zach lavine numbers
"&gt; Zach Lavine is in the East. These are Western selections.  Whoops my bad haha  &gt; there's more deserving guards than forwards this year  True, then you can just flip b/w Luka and Dame. I'd give it to Dame by a hair"
I'm fine keeping PG as a front court reserve. There's a limited number of spots for backcourt and there's more deserving guards than forwards this year.   Zach Lavine is in the East. These are Western selections.
"Honestly, you could start PG at the guard spot.  I feel like Zach LaVine should be an all-star, the man has improved so much.  But I agree with everything else"
"I don’t need to read anything slowly - Zach Lavine is a fine scorer, whose sheer statistical production in losing situations makes fans think he is better than he actually is.  How does he hold up in any of the catch all stats?  Raptor - 76  RPM - 136  LEBRON (new version of PIPM) - 239  Almost like all the stats designed to measure such things tell you he isn’t as good as you think."
How is this one of the highest voted posts? It is an empty post that has literally no purpose yet Zach Lavine goes off and gets less love. Big markets suck.
Zach Lavine never flops
“I’m a bulls fan who loves the players on a team that loses 55 plus games every year and I think we’re magically going to be contending soon behind Zach Lavine”
Zach a Lavine
"Lol, I’m not a fan because I think Booker and Mitchell are better than Lavine. Got it. It must be fun being a homer.  Hey honest question - what is the bulls trajectory? Where is this going? They keep drafting players, adding players, I keep hearing how good Zach Lavine is, yet the team never gets any better"
Lmaooo I said that Barrett is better at everything but scoring. Seeing that scoring is the most important skill in basketball Lavine is a better player rn. He’s also 5 yrs older than RJ. My point was that if RJ continues to improve his scoring ability every year then when he’s 25 he can be a more valuable player than Zach because he does everything well. RJ could also end up not improving to that point but I believe he can. His biggest flaw rn is shooting. The fact that he bumped his ft up 15% higher shows how hard he works and that he’s developing shooting touch. You have been parading around hating on a 20 yr old kid and telling other people they are immature and just being straight up a dick. Obviously RJ has flaws at his craft. We all do and if I had thousands of people hating on me for not being great at my job I wouldn’t be able to handle it tbh. The Knicks are my favorite team and always will be but sometimes we forget the human aspects of the game. I’ve done it too (looking at my Elfrid Payton comments lol ). You can be critical but you have to give them props when it’s due. Hope you have a good day Vyper.
"I am a bulls fan, I’m just not a blind homer.  Bulls fans overrate their players so much with this current core. He’s worse than Booker and Mitchell, too.  Mitchell has been the leading scorer on a playoff team every year he’s been in the league.   Last season the bulls were supposed to contend for an 8 seed, and instead were terrible.  This year, they won’t make the play in games.   Zach Lavine is worse than those other guys, and his production would go down if he was JJ either of those other situations"
ZACH LAVINE WITH NO REGARD FOR OFFENSIVE REBOUNDS

"You're right. [Per 40 min, he averaged 3.5 3PA and 4.3 2PA per game at UCLA.](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/zach-lavine-1.html)"
All-star Zach LaVine. Best believe it.
"Zach lavine was pretty good last year, I think Christian Wood gets it - or grant either one is deserving"
"Or just get a proper SG who isn’t hot fire in certain quarters, ice cold is most others.  Zach Lavine don’t wanna be in Chicago. What for? He’s $$$ with that contract tho. But he would be a better fit then another small imho"
MINNY MISSES YOU ZACH LAVINE
Zach Lavine? Averaging 28.2/5.3/5.3 on 43/59/86. .64 TS% that's some MIP stuff. If he leads this team to the playoffs that would be something
"I say this with all due respect, but fuck Zach Lavine and Coby White"
"if Zach Lavine is in the situation to get to the finals, there's probably someone better on the team than him."
Zach LaVine has been great and probably should be an All-Star this year. I’m unconvinced on Coby White being our starting point guard though. He had a great game tonight and I’m tired of tanking but I’d loooove to see us get lucky with the lottery and draft Cade Cunningham. Also Patrick Williams is actually developing really well
"You can go check out their sub if you don't believe me, they think THJ is some sort of borderline all star guard.  [This](https://np.reddit.com/r/Mavericks/comments/jkas7f/hypothetical_what_would_a_trade_package_for_zach/gai4ru3) guy said the mavs would say no to a THJ for Lavine straight up swap. Yes I'm that petty  Is it kinda old? Sure. I would've said hell no to this last year and when Zach had a torn ACL"
PROTECT ZACH LAVINE AT ALL COSTS
"Zach LaVine is the smoothest basketball player I've ever watched. How he moves and how he shot those jump shots, its just buttery smooth."
We got bullied by the bulls. And daddied by Zach Lavine.
"Fuckers telling me, always in the barber shop  ""Zach Lavine ain't 'bout this, Lavine ain't 'bout that""  My boy an Allstar on fucking MJ and them  He, he, they say that guy don't be putting in no work  Shut the fuck up, y'all ain't know shit  All y'all motherfuckers talkin' about ""Zach Lavine ain't no hitter, Zach Lavine ain't this, Zach Lavine  a fake""  Shut the fuck up, y'all don't live with that man  Y'all know that man got caught with a 40 piece  Shootin' at the Pelicans and shit  Man been on a tear since fuckin' I don't know when  Motherfucker, stop fuckin' playin' him like that  Them boys savages out there  If I catch another motherfucker talking sweet about  Zach Lavine  I'm fucking beatin' they ass, I'm not fucking playin' no more Know them Bulls roll with Pat Will and them  (Young Thaddeus on the beat)"

Vote Zach Lavine for All-star man
We fookin won! Zach lavine is a monster
Zach Lavine = All Star
Good I was worried we forgot how to perform 2nd half collapses for a second Lol  But Congrats to Lavine and Coby though. They cooked us (especially Zach)
ZACH LAVINE. IS. AN. ALL. STAR.
Zach LaVine is a flame thrower.
&gt; what does zach lavine have to do with anything?  I presume it's because he has an impressive scoring average but is far from a top player in the NBA.
Zach Lavine is so good.  Feels like every time I see him he is popping off.
"Imagine being Zach Lavine, drops 27 on super efficiency in the half and down 8."
"It seems the league just isn't high on Lonzo. Bulls have struggled to get big free agents and after taking a risk on Lavine, Zo story is similar so it seems like a good risk for them. Worst case keep the ball in Derozan and Zach hand and let Lonzo play the role he did here."
This is Zach Lavine slander
"Such a interesting question. Jordan was an Unstoppable scorer, the best player ever with 6 championships. However he was a unstoppable scorer that shot 50% from the field for his career. He took fade aways and didn't necessarily make his teammates better.  Lauri on the other hand, he's more than unstoppable scorer. He's a player that makes everyone around him into unstoppable scorers. Lauri is a player that will probably shoot 60% for his career and make everyone around him shoot 50%+. We are already seeing the results, Zach Lavine is the number one shooting guard for shooting percentage. The Bulls already have a better Offense than the Warriors (with KD, Curry, Thompson and Draymond) while Lauri only plays 30 mpg. With Lauri you are pretty much guaranteed the best offense in the NBA for his entire career and Lauri could have a 20 year career when it's all said and done.  Jordan just didn't make his teammates better, he had to wait until he got a superstar coach. Lauri doesn't have to wait, he just needs to be given the ball and given minutes. The rest will take care of itself.  In all honesty this question is way too early. However after Lauri's 5th year, (when he averaged a triple-double, wins MVP, and takes the Bulls to the Western Conference Finals,) I could see question even being taken seriously on /r/NBA.  For me I've always been fine with getting a bit ahead of myself and predicting the future even when it's not popular. I definitely wouldn't have said this after Lauri's last season but after his this season seeing his historic improvement, I would take Lauri over Jordan to start my franchise."
"Not famous or the best but I think Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine combined would be an MJ archetype plus a 3-pt shot.  But to answer OP's question, it's Durant-Westbrook for me. It's basically Giannis who can shoot anywhere."
"Calling Zach Lavine a good but not great player is highly questionable.  Anybody who watched Zach Lavine play last year knows that he's a bonafide superstar now. He takes over games on a regular basis.  The dude averaged 27, 5, and 5 on 50% FG and 42% 3PT. The bulls second best player was Thaddeus Young for most of the season. Think about that. Lavine would have been in the MVP conversation if he was surrounded with better talent last season."
"I agree with 2 but completely disagree with 3, i feel aa though Zach Lavine can turn into that guy, especially now that he has the right pieces"
You haven't watched much lavine if you still go by outdated take that lavine doesn't buy in defense.. i understand putting others first because zach has much to prove with a winning team but him not buying in defensively is bullshit take
They’re wrong. Zach Lavine is a near-superstar.
\- Klay Thompson is better than Kyrie Irving as a 3rd star of a superteam  \-Zach Lavine is the best dunker in NBA history  \- Chris Bosh was a superstar before joining the Big 3. He is a better fit than Melo ever would have been for the Big 3.  \- Prime Kawhi (16-17) is better than any Durant season
"Zach Lavine is a prime example of empty stats player. He got injured late last season and the Bulls started winning more. When the Bulls disappoint relative to expectations, nobody should be pointing fingers at Billy Donovan."
"Agree w/ the Bulls being overrated. Zach Lavine is miscast as a no1 option. They put themselves in position to make the playoffs and thats it.  Disagree with the G League point. NCAA has alot of cultural momentum, but I think a minor league system is a great way to get kids paid and in the NBA out of high school. Theres already been a couple of kids who went overseas bypassing college. Brandon Jennings, Lamelo Ball, Jalen Green. I think its great to give the kids options, and anything that can stick it to the NCAA is ok in my book."
"Kobe said good things about his friend so what? T-Mac wasn’t the first or last player who wasn’t as good as his numbers. Bradley Beal is basically the new Mcgrady. Or Zach Lavine. Or some other guys. Pretty numbers are just pretty numbers, Kobe has jewelry. Mcgrady wasn’t even as sucessful as Iverson, facts are he was nowhere near Kobe. 5 rings vs 0 playoff series wins lmao. If you give Kobe Yao it doesn’t matter who else is on the team Kobe and Yao are winning the series."
"Idk I guess it’s hard to explain the dynamic. He’s more of a draymond green type where if he was your number one, your team wouldn’t be very good. But let’s imagine a hypothetical team with both draymond and zach lavine. Zach lavine is definitely better than draymond, but adding draymond to a team led by zach lavine would massively increase the amount of games they wound win, in a way that’s disproportionate to draymond’s individual abilities. I feel like it’s the same with lowry. They’re better “ceiling-raisers” than “floor-raisers”"
Zach Lavine is overrated
Zach LaVine is a superstar.
"Jayson Tatum, DBook, Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown, Zach Lavine have already peaked. I can’t see any more upward trajectory due to the fact that all of their games offensively are predictable and sometimes one-dimensional"
Unpopular opinions? Let’s go!   1. Lakers will go back to lottery when Lebron retires if AD is the best player on the team.   2. AD is the most elite beta in the NBA!   3. Suns will also fall off a cliff when CP3 retires/moves away from team.   4. Zach LaVine will never win anything significant if he’s the best player on your team.   5. Miami Heat will be pretty mediocre again despite offseason moves and Jimmy Butler is borderline washed.  6. Warriors will win another 2 rings with Steph still on roster.
"I respectfully disagree with almost everything you said, lol. I liked the crazy walk out. Especially the town crier announcing McLemore. I thought it was pretty funny.   My issue is that he used the crazy walk out to cover for the fact that the dunk was super boring. He basically just went straight up in the Air Jordan pose. That’s not fancy at all, especially since a person sitting down isn’t even that high.   If Zach LaVine had a town crier come out and announce him as the “reigning dunk champion” before he does a 360, between the legs, windmill, then I’d think that was pretty awesome."
Zach LaVine isn't that good. Suns will not make it back to the finals and will regret maxing out their core players. Lillard is nothing more than a scorer and is not a true #1.
"u/19evol61 :   &gt; Player A: 14/3/3 statline with 44/37/82 shooting his whole career, plays sub-par defense, poor court vision Player B: 14/3/3 statline with 44/34/81 shooting his whole career, plays sub-par defense, poor court vision  &gt;The other player gets high praise with his work ethic and upside blah blah despite his injury history, and despite only having higher PPG due to his inefficient volume shooting. Gets $78m for 4 years.  &gt;The other is condemned by the NBA public for his apparently horrendous basketball play, has no risk of injury history, but his $50m/4y contract is considered an albatross.  &gt;One player is Zach Lavine, the other is Jordan Clarkson.  &gt;Bulls have lost this one."
Zach Lavine is the best player ever. Coming in at a close 2nd is Patrick Williams
There were once threads debating whether Kris Dunn or Zach Lavine would be better
Zach Lavine in 2018 can be viewed as a similar player as Kelly Oubre Jr is now
"u/IMDATBOY (Kings)   &gt;Exactly. People are really sleeping on Zach. We’re fine with Bogi and Buddy but Zach is better than either and has a higher ceiling  *****  u/tamazingg (Bulls)   &gt;He's 23. Put up 20 a game at 21. Getting at best a protected future 1st rounder from okc who just got PG to commit for taking on Melo is not a better use of our cap space than betting on Lavine.    &gt;The hope was to sign him around 16 a year, so yeah 20 is a bit of an overpay, but it's not like he's Deng or Mozgov signing for that contract. He's an exciting 23 year old shooting guard who looked like a future star before his injury.    &gt;I don't get why people think we should have just let him walk for nothing. He had a pretty poor half season last year coming back, but he was playing on a team in the thick of a shameless tank. Minnesota fans know what's up. Lavine is nice  *****  u/360Angel90 (WAS)   &gt;The Bulls got Otto Porter'd lol.  My favorite part about this comment is that Otto got notably more than Zach."
"maybe she was like ""marry a role player? lmao 😂  not for anything less than Zach Lavine"""
"Both things are true: The Bulls matched what was rightfully at the time seen as an overpay and Zach LaVine, well known for a real life 'legendary work ethic badge' improved well beyond his expectable outcome and is now in a great value deal."
“Zach Lavine ranks 430th in RBPM”
"Zach Lavine, stat wise"
"Lavine is actually better offball.. him, Vuc, Lonzo, and a little bit PWill can all shoot, so DDR doesn’t have to. Demar gets a lot of FT attempts and is a strong primary creator, all things the rest of the roster lacks. Defense won’t be good but with Lonzo and PWill on help d, Lavine and Vuc below average ish defense will be ok. If anything the Bulls (with the help of Zach recruiting) have built around Zach and this should make him want to stay next season, assuming this doesn’t fail completely, which it shouldn’t unless injury."
Don’t understand this at all. No shooting no defense and he needs the ball over Lavine. Only positive I can see is that it’ll get Lavine to further develop his off-ball game? Or maybe this is insurance for Zach not signing an extension.
"What was the biggest tell that I am a nephew? Was it:    * Tobias is better than Lavine take * My username * My inability to spell a weird European name * The fact that I think Zach Lavine is Stephen Marbury 2.0  In all seriousness, I wish I had a do over. Because I still think there is interesting conversation about  what the Bulls have done since last years deadline. Unfortunately it was masked by my disdain of Bulls fans overeating Lavine and my Tobias Harris take. Could have worded it a lot better, instead I posted the most toxic thread of the day on this sub. Guess that counts for something? Ehh whatever. We can chalk it up as Bulls are the 7th best team in the East and some guy was baked on the internet."
"I think it made a lot of sense for them to get Lonzo, and his contract will age well. I also think Caruso made a lot of sense for them as a point of attack defender.   I do question how much they can improve the defense because only one will play at a time and they're going to be playing next to Zach Lavine.  The main thing that bugs me about their moves is that they have to put out a bad defensive lineup to get their best players on the court.   Between having DeMar at the 3 who can't guard any position, Vucevic at the rim who is pretty much only good in drop coverage because of how bad he is in space, and Lavine, who tries but has never been an effective defender, there are just too many places to attack in a playoff series, and they're asking for a ton from Patrick Williams."

Zach Lavine and Giannis Antentokumpo are not on the same planet. Miss me with this take.
There is no narrative that Zach Lavine stinks. This sub has him pegged as a top 10 player in the league for some strange reason
Clearly haven't watched Zach Lavine play and just relying on narratives
"Ok, so next time just title your post ""Zach LaVine Stinks"""
"Nobody is. But it's become rather apparent this was a thinly disguised ""Zach LaVine hate post"""
"Maybe, but they need Lonzo to run the point and Lavine to be willing to take a step back. Derozan needs to be the leader. Zach needs to catch and shoot and not let his massive ego convince himself he is Kobe Bryant"
Mortgaging your future to make Zach Lavine happy is a fucking joke
The hard on people have for Zach Lavine is incredible. You'd think he was steph curry the way he is praised
"&gt; I would even argue that Tobias Harris is better than any player on the Bulls.  This is a really bad take. I'm not saying Zach LaVine is going to go out and win you a Championship, but come on, Harris is like the 3rd (at one point, 4th) best player on the 76ers who can't even make the Conference Finals. Before bouncing around about 10 different teams and made the Playoffs once, on a team that got swept in the first round where he was still probably the third best player (with a closer gap)."
"How in the world is Khris Middleton not better than Zach Lavine? Better defender, passer, rebounder and is almost 50/40/90 every season.   You don't think Khris Middleton could give a bad team an empty 25 a night???"
No one on planet earth would give up Jaylen Brown for Zach Lavine
"Zach is absolutely better than Holiday and Middleton lol this is a homer take. I don't think anyone is expecting us to immediately win a ring, but we got significantly better and have assets and salary to trade if a top 5 player were to become available.  no team goes from lottery to contending overnight, you have to acquire talent somehow. what do you want us to do, flip lavine in hopes of getting.......someone almost as good as lavine? he's gotta be the most underrated all-star at this point, now that there's talent around him y'all are in for a surprise lol"
I fucking hate when people can’t tell that Zach Lavine is a significantly better basketball player than Tobias Harris just because Lavine’s team has always been shit. Too many people like u out here talking about basketball when u have no business talking about it
You are seriously undervaluing Zach Lavine
"I feel like that Lavine take only really makes sense if you haven’t followed the Bulls when we’ve been bad.   I know I’m biased but gods honest truth Lavine has a narrative going against him (One that I fully bought into when he was on the Wolves) but just as a fan of the game Lavine has been very impressive from the jump. He is/was a LOT better than I thought he was. If you’ve watched our team the past couple years it was really apparent we weren’t doing him any favors. For example, Zach is very good at catch and shoot situations. Yet we haven’t really had a good ball-handler/playmaker until hopefully this year. Also Boylen. Also just a lack of offensive creation outside of him.    At the same time, I think forcing Lavine to do things he wasn’t stereotypically good at &amp; having to be “The man” has been very good for him &amp; he’s blossomed in that role. He gets noticeably better at everything every year.    For example, specifically in the mid-range one thing Zach has gotten really good at as the man is his timing on his jumps. He can get high in the air very quickly and is also a penetration threat. He’s become very good at making defenders drive with him, then leaping to basically get an open shot in the mid-range before a defender can even react, much less elevate. It really opens the floor for him.   I don’t think its an outlier as much as were finally starting to use him right/he still hasn’t stopped growing. Take me with a grain of salt because I’m a Bulls fan. But just as a fan of the game Zach is a very special player &amp; I’m glad we have him. I think he’s going to keep proving a lot of people wrong."
"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
Aint no way Ja and Conley are better than Zach Lavine
"i’m sure zach lavine is better than giannis on something, just not basketball"
Idek how much he understands the game given how much wild shit he says. Literally said last yr Zach lavine was better than Giannis lmao.
I feel like the talking heads didn't want to make MJ/Kobe comps for him for some reason so they went with....Zach Lavine and Beal.
I feel like his game is more similar to them than the Zach lavine/Beal comp tbh
Zach LaVine
Zach Lavine was the only shot creator but he can score from anywhere and catch shoot. Lavine can be plugged into any system.
Will he really though? I don't remember Zach Lavine getting his 20 field goal attempts per game on catch and shoots. I will be surprised if this works because the Bulls will be needing Demar to have less offensive responsibility than he has ever had and I don't see him adding much value when he isn't handling it.
"1. DeRozan. You should know him as a Raptors fan. Was a four time all-star in the East, and honestly had an argument for it last year over Conley. Has improved quite significantly as a playmaker since leaving the Raptors.  2. Zach LaVine. All-star last year. Lethal from everywhere on the floor.   3. Vuce. All-star last year. Definitely in the top 5-10 centres in the league.   We are developing players. OG, Trent, Barnes, Flynn…need I say more. The Hornets are getting better but still in that developing stage. The Wizards I honestly don’t know what they’re doing, but I seriously doubt they are better than the Knicks, Celtics, Bulls, Hawks, Sixers or Heat. Pacers in a similar boat. But they could be a playoff team. Cavs, Orlando, Pistons are all developing.   If I had to take a guess, I say we’re in the same tier as the Pacers, Hornets and Wizards. Likely, not in the playoffs."
No clue. He plays some type of sport. He’s no Zach Lavine that’s for sure
"Lavines said multiple times he wants to stay long term and there are reports that he’s wants to win in Chicago. Who more reliable, Lavine and reporters in the know or some random person on Reddit?  Y’all worry about Zion who’s camp already leaked he’s not happy and might want out soon. Zions looking to get out after 2 seasons whereas Zach has said he wants to stay after being in Chicago 4 years.   Also DeMar is a guy people want to play with and Lonzo is a tradable piece if a superstar wants out. We’ve made ourselves an attractive place because of what we’ve added the last year and we have pieces to be able to pull off a trade. We have a FO who’s showed they want to win and and will make moves to make that happen. We now have 3 all stars (2 who were all stars last year), a quality starting PG, and a young player with a ton of talent. What do y’all have? Zion, who’s unhappy, and a bunch mediocre players and an FO that try’s to figure shit out on the fly.  Have fun wasting the first few years of another great player who will be gone in a couple of years."

Your team is gonna look real awkward when you’re stuck paying DeMar DeRozan and Lonzo Ball $160 million after Zach LaVine asks out
There was a story a while ago of the guy who had a Zach Lavine? Kings jersey which had been misprinted or something

Zach lavine owns us
IT Zach Lavine Dejounte Murray Jamal Crawford KPJ  all guards but oh well lol
"Seattle will have the True Hoopers Elite team. IT, Jordan Crawford, Nate Robinson, Zach LaVine, and Dejounte Murray. I’m sure that there’s an actual starting 5 with people over 6’6  you could put together but those are the guys I have off the top of my head and I don’t feel like doing more research."
"Currently, it's Zach Lavine. His moveset is flashy but smooth, such visually aesthetic basketball.  I also root for Lonzo Ball, partly due to the influence of my friend group and our clowning of his old release. It's been great seeing his improvement over the years.  I hope Chicago can make some noise this year."
"Ever: Dr.J, Jordan, Magic, Kobe from 2007-2010, and a very young Vince Carter.  Now: Kevin Durant, Zach Lavine, and Luka."
**Smoothness/Aesthetics:**  1. Kyrie  2. Paul George  3. Zach LaVine  **Excitement/Holy Shit He's Going Off:**  1. Steph  2. Dame   **Floor Generals/Heliocentric Players**  1. Harden  2. Luka  3. Lebron
"I'm aware of Tony Bradley from his stint in Philadelphia and I don't think he's moving the needle. I saw ayo dosunmu play and I like his game I don't think he's going to see a lot of minutes and now that they have Lonzo Ball it should open up Coby Whites game up he's a pretty good three level scorer and can give you points coming off the bench or in a small ball lineup which I think we're going to see a lot of.  And I think you missed the point about the bulls needing a inside shot blocking presence that Gafford would have given them.  Because they are not getting any of that from Troy brown while he may have a higher upside than Gafford but how does that help them when you have a log jam at perimeter wing players with Patrick Williams, and Zach lavine, DeMar DeRozan there only so many minutes and how many can they find for him 12 to 15 a game tops?"
"I mean him being 2 inches shorter than he says certainly changes his role. I get that you’re a Pistons fan but it’s delusional to think that his height being 2 inches shorter than it really is doesn’t matter in any way.   To me his comp goes from Jayson Tatum and Luka Doncic to Zach Lavine and Jaylen Brown.   That’s not a bad thing, those two players are amazing, they just aren’t as amazing as the freaks of nature that are Jayson and Luka."
Lakers vs suns rematch with lebron and ad healthy (self explanatory)   ~~Finally get battle for LA with the clippers vs lakers~~ nvm forgot kawhi was out for most of next season  Hawks vs Bulls (Trae Young vs Zach Lavine both with good supporting casts)  Pelicans vs Mavs (Zion vs Luka)
"I bet ""Zach LaVine has a agreed to a max contract"" will be reported 20s into free agency 2022.  ""max?""  ""k""  ""k"""
Zach LaVine has never been worse than Ben Simmons
"I mean its hyperbole but I'd be disappointed if Jalen Green didn't average 27+ for at least like 5 seasons. His game is so similar to Devin Booker, Zach Lavine, and Bradley Beal. Just unreal shotmaking."
"JG looking crazy good, still think he’s the best player in the draft. The more I see him play, the less I get the Zach Lavine comp"
They'll revoke the bird rights to Zach Lavine
It’s my preference that you throw in Zach Lavine
"A gaurd as athletic as Jordan?? Pure athleticism, Zach Lavine comes damn close, the man doesn’t even look like he’s trying when he takes off for dunks. He literally glides through the air. He’s not as good a player, but the athleticism is there."
Salaries don't work. Lavine makes just under 20M while Ben makes 30M.  Plus Chicago seems deadset building around Zach.
Harper is the play here. Either that or slip a note to Gilbert in 2011 saying “Kyrie and Kawhi in 2011; Giannis Antetokounmpo 2013; Zach LaVine and Nicola Jokic 2014”
Zach Lavine will take another one with actually playmakers on his team. Probably will see insane levels of efficiency.
"I feel the same way about Zach Lavine.  I’ve been waiting for the Bulls to put some winning basketball around him.  Still am, matter of fact."
I seriously can’t tell if you are trolling.  Your reasoning means that Zach Lavine is a better scorer than Michael Jordan because Lavine is way more efficient than Jordan ever was.  So I ask you again. Are you trolling?
"What are you talking about? Firstly, the Czech game was Booker’s 3rd game, 2nd as a starter.  Also, Booker started 5 games not 4. Booker scored more in 2 of the 5 (by 2 and by 11) vs Tatum in 3 of the 5 (by 4, by 17, and by 22). Box scores are online so you can see for yourself.   It sounds like you’re calling Booker the team’s best defender and their best playmaker. If so, that’s a pretty outlandish claim. I personally feel that more than a few other players were better defensively because even if they didn’t have as many of the great defensive plays, they also had far fewer plays where they gambled or picked up fouls. But at the very very least, Jrue has to be ahead of him.  Similar thing with playmaking. My eye test didn’t match yours and there are multiple other players I think were better. And stats wise, Booker’s 11 assists and 7 turnovers total pale in comparison to KD’s 22 assists and 5 turnovers, Jrue’s 23 and 12, Zach Lavine’s 20 and 4, and even Dame’s 19 and 8. Bam had the same number of assists and one less turnover. And he and Zach Lavine were also getting the ball much less and played less minutes overall and they still managed to set players up as much or more than Booker did. I think you’re overestimating how good Booker did and/or underestimating how good other players did."
Zach Lavine type beat
"He's recruiting Zach Lavine. That's our long game. He stood next to him on the podium and hung his medal around his neck.   Why do you think we sent Derozan to Chicago? He's our double agent, that's why. Mark it down, Lavine will be a Spur."
"jimmy  thank god for zach lavine now, but that trade was ass. zach jus decided to make it kinda nice. love that dude. plus garpax basically forced jimmy out of town for years at that point  most bulls fans would probably say derrick of a recent trade but that was less dumb and more just sad, albeit inevitable"
Zach lavine and Tatum off the bench lmao
Zach LaVine making a fancy move that will be shown on highlights even though the move did nothing to help his team win.  What does he think this is? The regular season?
"A lot of our fanbase doesn’t believe in Vucevic for some reason, but imo he is probably going to be our best player a lot of days.  This is coming from a huge Zach Lavine fan.   Vucc during that Bucks Magic series was a monster."
How can you look at Zach Lavine and Jrue Holiday's beautiful faces and not have them 1 and 2 smh the blasphemy
zach lavine is such a beast. like my God he just glides into this insane dunk like he's just going through the layup line
How does he make it look so casual? I'm a Zach Lavine stan after these olympics.
According to most betting sites  MIP Top 5 next season is  SGA  Zion  Michael Porter Jr  Kevin Porter Jr  Zach Lavine
"Exactly. There is no cap space for a normal signing (and even if there was, there will be teams who can offer more).    S&amp;T would require both LaVine forcing his way to Boston specifically and trading away at least one of Smart or Timelord. And I think the former is not likely and the latter is not necessarily the best course for the team.   Basically, I don't see Zach (or Beal) playing for Cs any time soon."
You can tell the national media hasn't been paying attention to Chicago. Lavine did the recruiting. AKME didn't just sign them. Zach was a big part of this. He's not gonna give up on this thing after one year.
So do you. There is no way Zach Lavine is better than Jayson Tatum. Ask any GM or anyone or maybe the janitor on your 3rd grader if who will they pick between JT or Zach. I bet your ass no one would even think twice on picking Jayson Tatum. Straight answer JT every fucking time.
All NBA voting was so shitty back then  You'd have people like Mitch Richmond (great player) on the second team while his team won 25 games lol.   Meanwhile. Reggies teams would be in the ECF lol  Be like putting putting Zach Lavine over Chris Paul last year. Just crazy.
"Well, not according to the author of the OP's article or cap experts. Maybe it happens, but after seeing the way the Pelicans got played this summer as part of Lowry's effort to get to Miami, I don't know how eager other teams with no real shot at Beal will want to madly try to open up space for him just so they can be used as leverage so he can go to Boston. Maybe someone does it, but it's certainly not close to 100% chance of that happening. Also, when there really isn't anyone with space, it's tough for a team to consolidate the space that's out there all onto one team.   However, since you're such a believer in this, how do you feel about the odds that new Klutch client Zach LaVine pulls the same play to get to the Lakers? I feel like a lot of people here think that Beal can force his way to the Celtics easy peasy, but LaVine doing the same with the Lakers is impossible even though it's literally the exact same scenario. What do you think?"
"Finals MVP Zach LaVine, after averaged 63 for the entire Finals"
"&gt; My whole point was that signing Smart, Timelord and JRich wasn't hedging but enhancing their hand.   Except it isn't. The reality is that the Celtics don't know what Beal is going to do. If they knew 100% he wanted to sign with them then the best thing they could have done was build in the flexibility to create $50 million in cap space for next summer so they could just sign him. But they don't know if he'll even be a free agent by then (like I said, he's eligible to sign an extension soon), so rather than dump everything to create space they may have no need for, they did the right thing by hedging and keeping everyone.   Really Beal to the Celtics hinges almost entirely on two things: Beal wanting to go there above all else and Washington being amenable to making that trade. Nobody knows about the first part (although if Beal doesn't sign that extension then that's a good indicator for you), but the second part will come down to what circumstances are created to make Washington willing to trade Beal. If they can be convinced he's leaving no matter what, then that will help. But given the cap space scenario, both with Boston and around the league, it's more likely that Washington will be motivated simply by a good trade package from Boston. Like I said, Smart, Williams, a couple unprotected 1sts and one of the young guys will probably get it done.   And just so you don't think I'm just a Laker fan dumping on the Celtics, honestly the Lakers very possibly could be in this exact same scenario with Zach LaVine and the Bulls next summer. LaVine recently signed with Klutch, which some might take as an indicator that he wants to force his way to the Lakers. But that would hinge on the same two things Beal getting to Boston does: LaVine would have to prioritize getting to the Lakers above all else, and Chicago being willing to help trade him there. The exact same circumstances would have to manifest for that to even be a possibility."
"Empty stats is just an antiquated term for inefficient volume scorers on bad teams. In the past people would've said Zach LaVine put up empty stats this year, but I haven't seen anyone saying that now."
What? How Zach lavine?
He’s hot but he’s not as hot as Zach LaVine
"And I don't think anyone really wants to shed salary cause there's no real need to have a bunch of cap space. Next year's free agency class is going to be incredibly thin. Right now it's pretty much Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine, and we don't even know if either guy will really be available. Beal could sign an extension next month."
He looks like a zach lavine.. but got a feeling he will be better.. seems to have a good head on the shoulders as well as can accept a challenge
better Zach Lavine
Between Michael Jordan and Dion Waiters  I’m hoping for a better Bradley Beal or Zach Lavine
"Fairly simple, he has to prove his worth. Until he leads his team to a meaningful playoff run its juat empty stats. And don't give me that bullshit about a small market as he is in exactly the same boat as his former teammate Zach Lavine."
"Lol k, simple Reddit search and...  &gt;[\[Charania\] Team USA's 12-man roster for the Tokyo Olympics: Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Zach LaVine, Kevin Love, Bam Adebayo, Draymond Green, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, Jerami Grant](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/o6jsxw/charania_team_usas_12man_roster_for_the_tokyo/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)  Oh, there's an announcement of the roster... is Love's name...

Rockets got both the next Zach Lavine and the next Nikola Jokic in the same draft!
"This is something that needs to be brought up more. As a Wolves fan, I don’t like Jimmy that much, but i understand.  It was Thibs fault Jimmy was brought here in the first place, and then he did absolutely zero coaching. Our offense looked terrible besides the two All-NBA players (even though it was above league average). Our defense looked even worse. And on top of that, Thibs did shit all to manage players’ personalities, conflicts, or work ethic.   I hate Thibs for trading away Zach LaVine, and I hate him on top of that for fumbling the team that he fucking built himself."
That Zach LaVine is the lovechild of Michael Jordan and Steve Kerr
"Vince made less all nba teams in his career than Gilbert Arenas, Jermaine O'Neal,  DeAndre Jordan, and Amare Stoudemire.  And when you take away his 8 seasons averaging &lt;10ppg he is not even a top 30 scorer. Which is really the only thing he was elite at for a short period of time.  Never sniffed an MVP (unlike Blake who finished 3rd), never made the finals, missed the playoffs for the majority of his prime.  Vince was basically a more popular Zach Lavine. If Lavine plays for 22 years as a bench player would he be a hall of famer to you as well?"
"&gt;MPJ, Ayton, Ingram, Lamelo and Lavine have a decent chance since the top tier forwards in the west are getting older or a bit injury prone  Lamelo and Zach are in the East."
"How do people come up with these scenarios....  What's the better team?  Luke Ridnour, Aaron Afflalo, Tracy McGrady, Lamar Odom, Ronny Turiaf  Earl Boykins, CJ McCollum, Zach Lavine, Leon Powe, Enes Kanter"
"Luka. He and Jason Kidd will feud, Kidd's assistants (also former teammates) will side with him and Doncic will request a trade. He'll get moved to Chicago for Zach LaVine and picks."
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vučević Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
Zach Lavine
Demar Derozan earned a 2nd team all-nba in 2017-18 with a line of 23/3.9/5.2 on exactly league average TS.  Your first instinct might be ok those are not great numbers for a 2nd team considering his awful defense. And you would be right.   You might then think but wait they won 59 games so even though Zach Lavine has put up almost identical numbers (2019-20) and NOT EVEN MADE ALL-STAR much less All-NBA that hw must have been indispensable on the court.   Wrong again. Demar had a negative on/off even this season and the NBA roster featured a whopping 10 PLAYERS who are significant rotation players even now 4 years later.  Here is the list:  OG Anunoby Demar Derozan Serge Ibaka Kyle Lowry Jakob Poeltl Norman Powell Pascal Siakam Jonas Valanciunas  Fred Vanvleet Delon Wright  Of course this team was one of the best in the NBA with a 10 man rotation like that!
"you were just complaining about how ben simmons wasnt committed to getting better. so the fact that you are completely willing to ignore anthony edwards being completely unchanged during the time that hes supposed to be undergoing the most amount of mental development is pretty telling to how much youre committed to understanding the situation  and youre acting like ants decision making isnt a *weakness* when it really is. most all-nba players, even when they are 19, are not as bad as ant is. and the only reason it looked like he was a better decision maker down the stretch of the season is because of how god damn easy it is for him to capitalize on his gravity (which is why its so frustrating that he isnt better). he can make the simplest of reads and make things happen, similar to zach lavine, but the value these have is limited and until he can prove that he can do more than just swing the ball when defenses start to commit (which he hasnt really)   i know that its popular to hate on ben simmons, which is why you do, but it kills me inside whenever people try to pretend like they know so much when they absolutely do not. i know that you guys lack some pretty fundamental knowledge, but just come on, use your brains, ben simmons has made 3 consecutive all star teams and the only reason he wouldnt make another is because of the public perception of him, not that his impact is lacking. you know this and still maintain that a guy whos realisitc ceiling is as a all-star completely eclipses his value  honestly, give me an example of a person going from being an absolutely awful to good decision maker? the only one i can think of is jaylen brown, and i *know* that jaylen brown works 10x harder than anthont edwards does"
Zach Lavine not being a total defensive liability.
"I feel sorry for the Wolves fans man. That Joe Smith scandal fucked you up for decades. You had talent post KG, too. Aside from the obvious like KAT and DLo. Y’all also had prime KLove, a still good version of Kevin Martin, Zach Lavine and Jimmy Buckets. Shame that your GMs never built the proper support cast around those talents. Not to mention 2 chances to snag Steph in the 09 draft"
so Zach LaVine？
"Keep sleeping 😴 doubt he ever makes an allstar team, but with his skillset assuming he stays healthy I think he can be a high level starting combo guard and I love the fit with him next to Suggs despite neither projecting to be true point guards.   Aside from the whole unable to make 3s and weird free throw stuff (that he’s actually gotten better at) Markelle fultz has a lot of talent especially on offense. When watching him his athleticism, pace he plays at, ability to change speeds, ball handling/control, ability to get to rim, ability to finish at the rim at a very high level, pull up game, in-between game and passing IQ make his offensive game more complete than people seem to think. His few main downsides on that end are his FTr, FT%, 3 pointer (which will all skew his TS% for his career assuming they all stay stagnant) and he also needs to become a better PnR player.   Outside of that I’m not sure what else to say. I’m not too worried about the torn ACL I’ve seen young athletic guards like Zach Lavine and Dejounte Murray tear it and come back not only the same player but better and I think the same will happen with Markelle. I don’t expect him to play amazing this upcoming season just due to the fact that he is coming off an injury but once he’s 100% in 2022-2023 I think he’ll see the emergence of Markelle Fultz."
"with the magnitude that were talking about? its so much fucking polish lmao. hes really underdeveloped and if you honestly think that him being as good of a player as simmons is right now is a sure thing youve got another thing coming  anthony edwards, even if he starts to actually start making his shots on anywhere even close to a consistent basis, is still so undeveloped as a decision maker that his impact is capped super low on any team looking to compete in exactly the same way as in zach lavine is, but more so  anthony edwards is still struggling with the same issues he has been for years, and considering how vocally disinterested he is in basketball, i dont really understand why you guys are so certain that hes going to be better than ben simmons"
"That was crazy. Like Rose, Shump was never the same after that. Rose was able to mold his game and reinvent himself as a perennial 6th man candidate, but Shump didn’t have the same skill set to do something like that.  It’s also crazy how much medicine improved in a short time after this. Zach Lavine tore his ACL and you’d never know it by watching him. He came back as a better player and sometimes looks more athletic than he did pre-injury."
"&gt;Do you think using up your cap space and draft picks for this team, which I objectively view as second round fodder, was worth all those years of rebuilding? I also see this team has zero superstars on it.  Absolutely. Also, Zach LaVine is a superstar. He averaged 27/5/5 on elite efficiency."
"I get your point but I don't see how giving up a good prospect and tying up the salary cap for a guy who can't and then won't shoot is going to make anyone happy. Obviously, if he turns it around and plays really well, that's great but i don't like the risk reward. The Nets got Dlo, who had been so so so best, for just taking Mozgov off the Lakers books, right? That's a risk v. reward that I like. If they get Simmons the wolves won't be able to take advantage of something like that, should it show up    Plus, what if McDaniels ends up being an all star? I already have to watch Zach LaVine on the Olympic team and that was for an available all star and didn't work out."
"Damian Lillard, Zach Lavine, Caris LeVert, Kawhi Leonard and Brook Lopez.  Edit: I didn’t read the post correct and they’re not in order"
"Harden and KD won’t play enough games and I’d be surprised if the warriors ask Steph to do what he did last year.   I’m going to guess Luka, Zach Lavine  or Bradley Beal"
Zach Lavine would be his contract and become an All-Star.
"So would you say the same thing about someone like Rudy Gobert or Zach LaVine? Gobert's game is basically just rim running, setting screens and defense. LaVine's game is basically just 3 level scoring."
"Zach Lavine will not be on the Bulls this time next year. The Bulls have improved as a roster but so has the East, Chicago might also be terrible on D.  If the Bulls have underwhelmed at the trade deadline I could see them trading LaVine because they can’t afford to lose him for nothing as a free agent. One possible trade could be with the TWolves for DeAngelo Russell who has a longer contract.  As a free agent I could see LaVine signing with Dallas if they can rid themselves of Porzingiz contract) because other stars will want to play with Luka.  I think Timberwolves head coach Chris Finch is gonna turn KAT into a league leading star. Really excited to see what he can do with the big man, he’s really developed several of them into stars already.  Brooklyn will win the championship and won’t lose a game in the play-offs if their entire roster is healthy."
"LOL wait...this comment is like, sarcasm or irony...?  ...right...??  LMAO.  Chicago just had one of the best off-seasons in contemporary NBA history.  AKME are literally rebuilding the NBAs greatest brand &amp; are receiving global accolades for their efforts...what in gods name are you talking about ROFL  Also, are you seriously comparing ZLV with damian freaking lillard....?  Or Portland's FO to AKME.....?  Zach LaVine is small potatoes compared to where AKME are about to take Chicago.  Klutch/Paul are literally teaming up with AKME right now, have you been living under a freaking rock for the past month.....?  Klutch literally tampered to get one of their most popular &amp; well-known clients in Lonzo Ball into Chicago, and just signed his running mate.  The Zach LaVine clutch announcement was extremely Bulls-centric.  Klutch/Paul are planning to take over Chicago &amp; make it the biggest brand in the world once again  Srsly, what even is this comment, smfh hahah"
Also Zach LaVine
From what I’ve seen I’d probably say Zach Lavine. In your opinion who’s more athletic between Luka and Dame?
"who would you say is more athletic, Dario saric or Zach lavine?"
"Thats a really good analogy. I'd add not only LaVine joining the Warriors as a 6th man, but also developing into an elite perimeter defender.    People sleep on how good Ron Harper was. Zach LaVine can probably score better than Ron...but Ron was a better rebounder, defender, and facilitator than LaVine.    He was a really good player that people only seem to remember as a background dancer on The Michael Jordan Show."
lmao zach lavine is nothing like t-mac did you watch him play live at all?
"I'm sure they wanted Ron Harper for more than him being taller and more athletic than BJ. Harper was for years a 20 ppg scorer that could defend before he joined the Bulls, him joining Chicago at the time was like if Zach LaVine left Chicago today and settled to a sixth man role behind Steph and  Klay."
"It’s nobodies fault you faced u fortunate injuries.   T Mac def was Kobe/Lebron level but that was as a non winner. Is Zach Lavine the current version of TMac in that he’s an athletic monster who can get a jumpshot off, puts up nicely rounded numbers. But just doesn’t win  I think Mac is one of the more over rated greats. Given it was such a short run in comparison."
"You would undoubtedly have seen that already imo if LaVine was in Utah in Mitchell’s place. Playing next to some legitimate NBA point guards (Rubio, Conley) and shooters over the years on a team with a perennial DPOY candidate center, I’m extremely confident that an alpha scorer as efficient as Zach would consistently have that team in the playoffs. I’m hesitant to say he would “lead” them to the playoffs because I’m hesitant to say Mitchell “leads” Utah to the playoffs. He’s undoubtedly their lead man offensively but Rudy Gobert is the guy who drastically raises the floor of the team and makes them as a playoff lock.   I’d like to see Donovan Mitchell lead Lauri Markkanen, Wendell Carter Jr, and Denzel Valentine to the playoffs."
"Lavine,Mitchell,booker,Beal...Zach Nd Mitchell can impact the game on both ends and rebounds with there athleticism’s alone on top of giving you a easy 40 (I feel they both can be better on the play making end)...booker and Beal I feel just can score."
"Lonzo 26 Zach Lavine 26 Demar Derozan 32 Patrick Williams 20 Nikola Vucivec 30  Bench  Alex Caruso 27 Coby white 21 Troy Brown Jr 22 Derrick Jones Jr 24  Tony Bradley 23  Ayo, marko simmonovic, devon dotson, javonte green"
"&gt;1.	⁠KD has declined.   He just had a year as good or arguably better than the ones he had in Golden State.    &gt;He just plays a different  role as a PF now  He’s literally playing the same exact role he has for the rest of his entire career   &gt;who moves less so it's less noticed  Player movement tracking has him moving at the same rate he was at before injury.   &gt;but you see him unable to have that quick first step anymore as he struggled to blow by slow ass Brook Lopez.  This is just a flat out lie   &gt; He's just the most unique player ever so he can shoot over everyone  So he’s apparently declined, but still has the ability to shoot over anyone and get a bucket whenever he wants at the highest of levels? Make that make sense   &gt;2.	⁠Klay is not KD  He’s not, but he’s a perimeter based player whose game is based off skill not brute strength/ athleticism. His leg injuries aren’t going to hamper his game once he gets back into game shape.  &gt;has had worse injuries.   ACL injures don’t concern me at all. I’ve recently seen 2 athleticism based guards in Zach Lavine and Dejounte Murray both come back from a torn ACL and not only retain their previous athleticism but become even better basketball players afterwards. The Achilles injury is more worrisome than the ACL injury but just like KD, klay is a skill based player and perimeter player. His body isn’t going to get beat up like Boogie and Kobe’s did simply based on playstyle.   &gt;Klay is top 5 in miles traveled and plays a lot of tough defensive assignments  He’ll be load managed his first year so that won’t be a problem, and when talking about the defensive side this is the main reason they traded Dlo for Wiggins. Wiggins came into his own as a defender last season and more likely than not Dray and Wiggins will be the primary defenders.  &gt;I think GSW will be fine enough tho if they slide him to SF full time; 6'6"" is a good height for a SF and he fits better guarding those type of guys as he gets older nowadays anyway.  I don’t see them putting him at the 3 or guarding bigger more athletic 3s whatsoever I think doing so would increase his chance for another injury. They spent the last 2 years adding wings and forwards like Wiggins, Porter jr, Iggy, Kuminga and Moody for this very reason."
I'm surprised Zach Lavine and Aaron Gordon haven't tried. Or Paul George either.
"As unlikely as it may seem right now, the Sixers path to success is for Zach Lavine to inform the Bulls he won't re-sign despite the moves they made, and for him and Rich Paul to see his best chance at a ring with fellow Klutch client Ben Simmons in Philadelphia.  Winning a chip or coming close with the Sixers dramatically increases the value of three Klutch Sports properties (Simmons, Lavine, Maxey).   Meanwhile, I'm not sure Demar Derozan and Lonzo Ball fit all that well around Lavine.  Is Derozan gonna bury 3pt shots after Lavine drives and kicks it?  I dont think so.  Is Lavine going to cede the #1 scoring role to Derozan and wait for kickouts?  I don't think so.  With all of them together, I still don't think they're better than Atlanta or Boston.   Besides that, the Bulls lost Thaddeus Young and Otto Portert and Lauri Markkanen, but just took Portland's FRP instead of Larry Nance Jr.  I suspect they signed Derozan to a marquee contract and Lonzo Ball to carry the weight after Lavine leaves instead of seriously thinking those guys can make the conference finals in the East.    Because he was in a contract year and had say in where he was going, the Bucks got Jrue Holiday for has-been Eric Bledsoe and picks.  Also in his contract year, the Sixers got Jimmy Butler for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.  It's a players league.  Zach Lavine and Rich Paul have the power.   **Ben Simmons, Zach Lavine, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid**  **Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Andre Drummond**"
I think that people have standards far too high for many players. He has a role to fill and he did that. His role isn’t on as large of a scale has say Zach LaVine. But it still contributes to winning.
Zach LaVine tough shot in the clutch that at first you wonder why he took it
"Calling Giannis the best is like the Celtics saying bird is better than magic. And the lakers saying magic is better than bird.    It’s not like the bulls saying Zach Lavine better than KD.  Fan is short of fanatic, it did mean that until social media."
Read on another post about shaking Chicago for Lavine. I think this move is great for both teams and is honestly the closest the 6ers are going to get with regards to Star player return. Zach is better than CJ and I think his offensive firepower along Embiid could be devastating. Chicago it finally gives them a star defensive presence and facilitator.
"No one before him either. He’s the GOAT dunker.  For my money, young Zach Lavine came the closest."
"I think Zach Lavine makes the most sense…  Lavine has indicated he’s not happy in Chicago and as his contract is expiring there’s a lot of stuff swirling saying they may not resign him.  If you’re Chicago, wouldn’t you rather get something back rather than letting him walk?  Also the Chicago team right now is too offensive, and has zero defense. However if you swap Lavine for Simmons, you have Lonzo, Vucevic, Simmons and Derozan in your line-up. Which is a really solid core, and Simmons helps fix up that defense gap.   Also Lavine fits perfectly with the Sixers. Yes he’s not Dame or Beal, but he can really shoot. And he can facilitate. If you pair him with Embiid and Harris, that’s a solid line-up.   Both teams get better…"
"Simmons for Derrick White and Thad Young is interesting. SAS might have to throw in some future assets.   Simmons for Gordon Hayward would be interesting if you knew Hayward would be healthy.   Simmons for Jaylen Brown makes Boston a better team, but then the 6ers need a point guard. If they can do that while getting a PG somewhere else, I think they are better. A three way trade loosely built around Horford to Cleveland, Brown and Rubio to the Sixers, and Simmons and Osman to the Celtics works on the trade machine. Guessing picks would have to go to Cleveland for taking on Horfords salary.   If Zach LaVine tells Chicago he won't re-sign, a Simmons for LaVine + stuff package would be good for both teams."
Glad Zach Lavine is the exception for my bulls. He is definitely a solid defender now. /s
That's what I don't understand about why people have this narrative that Rich Paul is making players do things they don't want to do. It's pretty obvious that AD hired Rich Paul in September of 2018 because he was looking to make his way to the Lakers and Paul was the obvious choice to help make that happen. It'll be the same thing if Zach LaVine ends up on the Lakers in the next year: we'll look back and think that's why he signed with Klutch. Rich Paul isn't making these guys do anything they don't want to do.
I've heard Bulls fans say Zach Lavine is good on defense and it makes me belly laugh
"Zach Lavine wants respect, so this must automatically mean he hates the Chicago front office, ignoring the entire relationship Zach and the front office have together.  Respect in Zach's case is about being questioned as he recovered from ACL surgery, always being doubted, having to take a low salary due to the perceptions that he could never be a star, working his ass off, becoming an All Star, becoming the 2nd best player on a Gold medal Olympic team, and being paid only 19 million because of the disrespect the prior Bulls office and other GMs around the league gave Zach. Jarrett Allen is earning more than Zach, as one example.  Respect is Zach being recognized for the player he is. Conclusion... Bulls will be paying him max money to stay in Chicago. He is going nowhere else not will he request a trade."
I was gonna say this he’s definitely good but he’s by no means the superstar he’s made out to be. Kind of like Zach Lavine but Zach plays a position where he can get by without being a good defender. opposed to Zion who plays a position where you need to play defense in order to be a superstar.
Bulls fans with Zach LaVine [lol](https://media4.giphy.com/media/8UHRIemymPn5SzJbqr/giphy.webp?cid=6c09b9523718a25d8d35fc606025bf5f7a80c9aff41d3d7a&amp;rid=giphy.webp&amp;ct=g)
Zach Lavine
"Do u really think devin booker and zach lavine weigh more than him, also it just doesnt align with what we know about tatum's past"
"He'd be irresponsible to say otherwise, it's his job to consider all options.  But there's a difference between a Giannis-level star and someone like Zach Lavine.  I'm not saying we ride or die with our group over getting an MVP-type player, but those cases are very rare and they would still need to be a decent fit with Trae (non-primary ball handler)."
Tobias Harris for Zach LaVine? I feel like that's a fantastic trade because the Sixers can clear lots of cap space by getting rid of that contract and they get Zach LaVine!
"Zach Lavine signed with Klutch yesterday even after Noel case. Paul still has the reputation to sign all stars. It's your weekly hate train on r/nba. Ride it, Simmons and Paul are the targets currently."
"How the hell are SGA, Zion, Zach Lavine, dearron fox and jaylen brown most improved candidates? They all took leaps LAST year."
Bro what the fuck are you on about? Why did your boy Zach Lavine just hire him if he’s a bad agent? You think Zach’s a dumbass?
That zach lavine wont win 6 straight fmvps starting this year
"I'm sorry, what?! Your original argument was that Paul clearly does what's best for his players and when I point out a recent time when he didn't, you immediately back away from your argument entirely and switch to saying ""other agents do it too""? That's pathetic.   We've gone from ""he obviously acts in his vlients best interest"" to ""a lot of agents do this"" to ""a star player hired him, so he must be amazing"".  Do you not understand that there might be a difference between the way Klutch treats max players and other players? Is that seriously such a tough concept?  Rich Paul might be a great agent for LeBron, and he might be a great agent for Zach Lavine, but that doesn't mean he always acts in his client's best interest.  You said that he clearly does, and when people disagree, you wildly move the goalposts.  Clearly you have no intention of actually engaging in any sort of real discussion on this topic, so I'm out."
"Did Schroders agent do what was best for Dennis?   Did Oladipos agent do what was best for him?   Shit happens… Nerlens Noel is a grown man. If he didn’t think he could get a better contract, he should have taken the deal on the table. Why did Zach Lavine just hire Rich Paul if he’s so terrible?"
No answer? Why is Zach Lavine hiring him?
So why did Zach Lavine just hire him?
Zach Lavine is way undervalued on this!!
"Nah, let’s blame Rich Paul. Maxey has absolutely no say on his career. It’s all Rich Paul. It’s actually why Zach Lavine, a budding star, signed with Klutch and Rich Paul, cause he wants Paul to do everything without having any say.  /s"
"It's harder than I thought, I have 28 names right now.  (IN NO ORDER)  Lebron James  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Giannis  Damian Lillard  Steph Curry  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Trae Young  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Jrue Holliday  Jamal Murray  Klay Thompson  Anthony Davis  Russell Westbrook  Kawhi Leonard  Paul George  Jayson Tatum  Kyle Lowry  Pascal Siakam  Jimmy Butler  Zach Lavine  Luka Doncic  Ja Morant  Kyrie Irving  Bradley Beal"
"I have a question I have for everyone who seems to think getting better is always worse—  Is there *one example*... one *single example* in NBA history.... of a superstar wanting to come to a city, desiring to come to that city, and being unable to because of cap? Particularly in this era?   In the past half of a decade, we have seen a team that was ‘too fringe to ever win’ trade quite literally the player we are discussing— DeMar DeRozan— for one of the players you list and they won a Title.   So I guess why is a good team an albatross? People say that but how often is it true? Why would Giannis or Kawhi or AD or any of the players you list later in their career prefer to go to a Bulls team with Zach LaVine and bad role players over a team with LaVine and Ball and Vooch and DeRozan where they may be able to pick and choose players to play with?   I agree with you that the Bulls have gotten better and aren’t a true contender right now. But are we saying that the only way to move forward when you can’t instantly make a title contender to lose every year where regardless you have to compete with a *lottery system.*.   So yeah I just don’t think this team construction notion that you’re either a true contender, a tanker, or an idiot realistically makes any sense. Despite the fact that so many fans seem to have it."
"Agreed, but the dunk contest with Aaron Gordon and Zach Lavine is definitely hands down the best dunk contest ever.   Prove me wrong.   I loved J Rich and Vince and all, but dayum."
"Carmelo Anthony, Demar Derozan, Zach Lavine, Manu Ginobli and Kobe"
zach lavine is an average starter   ok then
I want Zach LaVine
"Zach Lavine. Everything about him is beautiful. His jumper, his face, the way he just glides in the air. Fuuuuck watching him gets me going."
I was amazed with Zach LaVine too. He is crazy smooth
1. James Harden  2. Klay Thompson  3. Donovan Mitchell  4. Devin Booker  5. Zach LaVine  6. Bradley Beal  7. Jaylen Brown  8. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  9. Colin Sexton  10. CJ McCollum

That's cap. Zach Lavine also has a lot of stories of him being incredibly humble and nice. Maybe your friends are inconsiderate assholes.
From Chicago and bunch of close friends said Jimmy Butler was an ass to them. Also Zach Lavine is a douche.
"No it makes you a good shot creator, they are good shooters but not elite or great. Guys like Steph, Dame, Kyrie, Khris Middleton, Paul George, Zach Lavine and KD are elite 3pt shooters off the dribble. Chucking loads of 3s at below league average efficiency doesn't make someone a great shooter just because they chose to take a more difficult shot. It can be a great tool to open up other parts of their games like their driving and passing, but it doesn't make them elite or great shooters."
I think Zach Lavine unfortunately doesn't raise enough eyebrows and neither does Vucevic. I hope they're getting a fair shot at weekday ESPN or tnt games
Zach Lavine. (Although I respect those sayin Gnannis and Westbrook.)
&gt;Assuming Murray is back in true form  it often takes 18 months for a player to get back to 100% after ACL surgery.  Zach LaVine is often looked at as a best case scenario and even he took close to 18 months to get to full strength.
Zach lavine
Zach lavine is the probably the most obvious one. His one the best SG offensively right now who’s don’t get paid and doesn’t get respect and backup from his own franchise..  Put him and embid in 76es and then people get a clue to how much this guy is talented.

"I mean it's an extremely rare occurrence to stop most stars unless they weren't built for the moment anyways especially in the playoffs. The point is that we have defenders who can atleast make things hard for Zach and stop him from torching us every night, and if he does end up doing so it's because he's Zach Lavine and great offense&gt; great defense."
Zach Lavine finals MVP in his first playoffs appearance
I saw Zach Lavine do an in-between the legs VC dunk live at my local gym. Made it look so effortless and casual. Entire gym erupted with cheering after watching  him glide through the air.
"Four years or something ago someone said ""NBA great Zach Lavine"""
Zach LaVine
Zach Lavine
zach lavine baby  insert everyone else’s young stars here
Zach Lavine (with his new posse)
"In no particular order:    1. Lebron James   2. Steph Curry   3. Kevin Durant   4. James Harden   5. Kawhi Leonard   6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Anthony Davis   8. Nikola Jokic   9.

Draymond Green   29. Khris Middelton   30. Russel Westbrook   These are the guys I can think of that I would say have an argument over Gobert right now.  As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."
&gt; google  obv this guy will know better what he thinks is the perfect form than if I google Zach Lavine 2014
"almost unrelated but my favorite shot form of all time was Zach Lavine his first two years in the league before he tightened it up. The slightly unnecessary movement he had made his shot look like the bow and arrow celebration, shit was so dope."
"That's actually a really good point, because, as a Thunder fan, even though I didn't like that trade, I didn't see it as terrible at the time.   Pretty much everyone knew one of our four stars had to go because the entire ownership net worth was in oil and we were still coming out of the GFC. There was just no chance of paying luxury tax anytime soon.   KD was safe. Obviously. Casual Thunder fans thought it was between Russ and Harden. But, more serious fans knew the insane athleticism and motor Russ had was just way too much potential.   The real question was Ibaka or Harden; and while Harden had just had a great playoffs, he completely disappeared in the Finals. Whereas Ibaka was leading the league in blocked shots AND hitting open jumpers and 3's at an insane clip. He was also young and it was thought he would continue to develop (little did we know his age must have been more exaggerated than expected...).  Harden, on the other hand, didn't play defense and looked to be more of a really good scorer on a bad team type of player (like a DeAngelo Russel or a Zach Lavine)."
Zach lavine&gt; Eric gordon
It depends on the seed we get and matchups honestly but zach lavine isn't better than Donovan Mitchell or kyrie irving
FAXX zach lavine &gt;dwade bulls are the 3 seed
"Vuc’s defence is like Jokic but without jokic’s few strengths. He’s bad in the pick and roll cause he’s laterally slow and can’t guard shooters or ball handlers when he’s switched on to them. He doesn’t deter shots at the rim. He’s not athletic. Generally Orlando has had exceptional defensive personnel that have helped hide him. It doesn’t mean much in respect to him. Other examples include Pau Gasol with the spurs, valancunis with the Grizzlies or, well, Sabonis on some of the past pacers teams.   And the bulls defence also improved because Zach Lavine played in like half of the games vuc did due to injury, and ofc its a very small sample overall.  He’s not like the Trae young of C’s but he’s in the bottom 5 of starting C defenders"
"I’m going full kool-aid here because fuck it I love Zach Lavine:   I think he finishes the season in everyone’s top 10 considerations and is in the mvp conversation.   Save this for an agedlikewine or agedlikemilk post, idc. I’m buying it.   I’ve watched 75% of every bulls game for the past 7 years. Last year was almost 100%. Zach Lavine is a fucking problem. His speed and agility are still slept on (somehow). The dude can just effortlessly glide across the court when he wants. Hops out the gym, shoots with the best, attacks viciously.   His three big flaws last season: inconsistent defense, ball control and occasionally questionable late game decisions.   All three of which can be solved by one thing: better teammates that he can rely on. Not having to be primary ball handler with guys like Lonzo, Caruso and Demar all taking that mantle for him will reduce the frequency of turnovers and energy expenditure, which will lead to more focused defense, less focus drop offs when handling the ball, and less needing to force the issue late in the game. Not to mention, defenses can’t key in on him and run him around the court or force him into double teams."
I will fully admit Zach Lavine as been different guy the last few years.  I wasn’t on high on him but he has won me over. He’s a machine on offense
"LeBron, Curry, Harden, Kawhi, KD, Luka, Giannis, Jokic, Embiid, Dame, AD, Kyrie, Beal, Tatum.  That's 14. All of those but Beal are pretty clear cut better.  Then, guys like Booker/Butler/Mitchell/Zion/Lavine/KAT/Trae hover around that area.  Sure, you may make an argument for Zach being top 20, but you could make one against that. Both takes are pretty reasonable."

ZACH LAVINE
I wish Zach Lavine would take it easier on his damn knees. But damn it's hype to watch him play.
Kemp and Nique easy.   Let's not underestimate Lavine. Probably the greatest contest dunker in history in terms of difficulty. Obviously Jordan and Vince expanded what was possible but Zach raised the bar in my opinion.
"I'm happy Zach LaVine finally has an actual team that can do some damage. The dude has just been destroying the league on his dogshit team, with no real hope until they got Vuv. These new pieces are gonna be dangerous"
man zach lavine can fuckin fly
The league really let Zach Lavine have a competitive team
"Where would he be without his connection to LeBron? There’s no evidence that he’s good at his job when it doesn’t involve helping out a team or friend of Lebron’s. See Tristan Thompson, KCP and Anthony Davis. See Ben Simmons and Nerlens Noel, even his client Zach lavine is unhappy with his pay. Rich Paul has only been able to use the “pay my guy or lebron might leave” move"
"not to mention now that he's got talent around him the other's team defense can't just be ""defend Zach Lavine"". like last season before we got vuc who only played like 10 games with Zach, the other team's whole defense was focused around limiting Zach. Now if they do that they let Demar, Lonzo, Vuc score freely. That's gonna be huge for Zach this season"
Watching Zach LaVine realize he has help in this clip is beautiful
Zach LaVine is going to win league MVP
Zach Lavine is one of the GOAT dunkers.
That Zach LaVine guy is pretty good huh
"bro you left zach lavine off the list lmao, arguably the best dunker in the league"
"Top 15?  Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jimmy Butler, Jokic, KAT, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Chris Paul  These are all players I would rather have. Honorable mentions (aka: players I would still rather have, but aren't as good as the above) - Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, Draymond Green, Pascal Siakam, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Zach Lavine, Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell."
"zach lavine leave....?  you mean Chicago trade him because he's a career loser who isn't worth investing into?  This comment is confusing.  ZLV needs Chicago, they don't need him"
Who cares about history. Book is better than Kyrie right now. He's basically a top 10 player.  Do you also put Dwight Howard over Zach Lavine because of career accomplishments?
"You clearly don't even watch the Celtics because Brown has been straight up decent at best on defense since taking on a bigger offensive load. LaVine is on the level of Tatum already, with Zach being the better offensive player and Tatum being better on defense. Their BPM, VORP, and Win Shares/48 were identical last season.   If LaVine was on the Hawks he'd easily be your best player lmao."
I don't see how the Knicks or pacers are better than Chicago and the bulls had the 12th ranked defense I think derozans playmaking in the half court will allow zach lavine to give more effort on defense and get easier shots    I doubt the Raptors will be the 9th or tenth seed pascal siakam is a 3rd option at best fred vanvleet is solid but I don't think he can get much better and if I'm not mistaken Barnes is a project player who's raw so I don't see him adding much
Zach Lavine
 Chris Paul (I just feel like he can play at a mid to high level for a very long time.)  Zach Lavine  OG Anunoby  Bam Adebayo   Andre Drummond
"Zach Lavine, Lonzo, and Demar"
"Zach Lavine, he has a decent team now so we can finally watch him in the playoffs. Also Ben Simmons, nothing else needs to be said"
"Zach lavine and deebo damnnn, now if bulls can tighten up their defense"
Westbrook: has to prove he can extend his range  Simmons: has to prove he's playable in 4th quarters  Zach Collins: Has to prove whatever potential we saw is still there  CJ McCollum: Has to prove he's good enough to be the second best player on a contender  Porzingis: Has to prove he's good enough to be a second best player on a contender  Rudy Gobert: Has to prove he can abuse mismatches  Zach Lavine: Has to show why he wants to be 'respected' by the Bulls  LeBron James: has to prove he wakes up before Skip Bayless to work out /S.  Check Skip's insta posts of about 3 weeks ago
Under the radar bets for me:       Steven Adams   Boogie Cousins     Grayson Allen   Zach Lavine
Since when is Zach Lavine just “Zach”?
Zach Lavine is 6’6 lol. Jesus Zion.
"Big named centers not named Anthony Davis(Jokic, Kat, Embiid, Bam), Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal, Westbrook, and CJ McCollum  Center position is just a valuable position anymore. The rest are just players I don't think do well in playoff series on a championship team."
"I saw Wiggins play really well in the back half of his rookie season, and then stall .    And also people don't realize how stacked the guard position is.  Zach Lavine just made his first All Star game , and the way I see it is if Ant becomes as good as Lavine id be thrilled.  But that seems to be what a lot of peoples baseline expectation is"
"That’s the 2K code for cheese. That’s why it tries to hard to nerf players like Zach Lavine now. A player that can shoot, handle, and attack the basket is basically unstoppable."
Any team that has Zach Lavine
"Ok but Kuzma actually did spend four years in college and graduated with a degree. It's part of the reason he looked like he could hang with Ingram and Lonzo his first few years in the league - he was significantly older than them.  Kyle Kuzma is older than Aaron Gordon, and a few months younger than Zach LaVine and Andrew Wiggins, they were one-and-doners and he did four years at Utah."
I think Zach LaVine is considered one of the best case scenarios for ACL recovery and even he took like a year and a half to get to full strength.  I'd be really surprised if Kawhi came back before the beginning of next season if the plan is to be cautious.
"Watching him in the playoffs, I came away thinking he was kind of inconsistent. If he could work on that and improving his scoring in general and/or work on his defense, then he could be top 15.   I have him at 20  11.Damien Lillard   12.Jayson Tatum  13.Donovan Mitchell   14.Kyrie Irving   15.Chris Paul   16.Jimmy Butler  17.Trae Young  18.Paul George   19.Zach Lavine   20.Devin Booker  21.Bradley Beal   And you could even make the case that Beal is better than him. I don’t think he’s better than anyone in the top 15 personally. Even if you think he’s better than Chris Paul, there are still the players from 16-19 that have a case to be over him."
"I just don't get why Beal would want out now. Everything Beal has done has indicated he wants the Supermax. If he's traded he's a rental.  Portland has no reason to move Dame at the deadline, moving him in the off-season is way better for them.  LaVine would be a rental. No guarantee he'd want to re-sign with Philly. You have to imagine the 76ers want to get more than half a season of Zach LaVine in exchange for Ben Simmons."
"I'm still mad at Thibs for breaking up one of the most fun lineups, regardless of record, that I've ever watched:   1- A healthy and quick Rubio  2- Zach Lavine  3- An interested Wiggins  4- (Insert anyone)  5- KAT   Watching those young guys run was amazing. Watching them beat the 72-9 Warriors at Oracle was crazy.   I still think Flip Saunders (RIP) was a legend for putting together Wiggins, Lavine and KAT, even though it didn't work out in the end. I would have loved to see that core grow together."
“Zach Lavine is a better basketball player than Giannis and it’s not even close. Zach Lavine is the definition of a pure hooper!”   Lmfao.
"Let’s say instead, Philly drafted the player that was immediately picked after their pick. Would this be a better team? Ben McLemore Steven Adams Aaron Gordon Zach Lavine Kristaps Porzingis Brandon Ingram London Ball"
"Really the worst pick is Saric. They already had 2 bigs and Zach Lavine went right after.    With Okafor the only other option was another big in Porzingis, ofc you could hope Porzingis could stretch the floor more but the only other non-bigs worth taking were Justice Winslow and Mudiay. You can’t fault them for not taking a guy like Booker.    With MCW it really shows incompetence for a GM to draft a player then 1 year later don’t believe in him. THEN the fact you only get 1 first for the ROY. Can’t really fault the pick since he was the ROY and no one could’ve predicted Giannis. But they really botched that situation."
"He would absolutely have more trade value just because of his age (20 compared to 27 for Caruso), and also his crazy body, with that giant wingspan and enormous hands, along with just how solid he is (last year he was the heaviest player in the league for someone his height or shorter). I don't know if the Lakers will make a big mid-season trade though, unless Zach LaVine tells the Bulls he wants to get traded to the Lakers. Without trading one of their big three the Lakers would have trouble putting together the salaries to match on max salary players, but LaVine is only making $19 million this year, so the Lakers could match that with THT and Nunn (plus picks, of course)."
"they were 12th in defensive rating, but it was a three way tie, so they were actually tied in 10th place technically.   I totally agree. People say the fit is bad because of Derozan. But they don't realize that this is actually the ideal roster for a player like Derozan. On the Bulls he is surrounded by really good three point shooters and two other elite offensive threats in Zach and Vooch.   I think the other reason people are skeptical is because they think Zach, Demar, and Lonzo are all ball dominant and won't be able to get as many touches as they need. This isn't really true though. Lavine is one of the most efficient scorers in the league which means he doesn't need a lot of touches to score a lot of points. And Lonzo is more of a facilitator than scorer, so his touches should be turning into points for his teammates. The only true ball dominant player is Derozan.   Also we see year after year super teams form with multiple ""ball dominant"" players and do just fine. Good players figure out how to play together."
"My biggest question mark is who's going to be the primary ballhandler? Zach Lavine is easily their best player, but we've seen how Lonzo is without the ball and Demar is also at his best when he has the ball in his hand. I'm not too worried about their shooting considering that Lonzo, Zach, and Vuc can all shoot 3s. Also gotta see improvements from coby and patrick. They are a playoff team there is no doubt about that, but imo you need a good coach to create a system that has all these ball handlers."
Yes. I have been watching this same franchise use picks for the last 5 years and the result has been...a worse record every year.  The draft is *not* the way to build around Zach Lavine at this stage in Zach's career.
"100%. And this could be exactly why Bulls want him. Zach LaVine actually plays solid 1-on-1 defense, and his major defensive weakness is dodging screens. In the Olympic team, they can always switch with the mobility of Bam and Draymond, but Bulls cannot do that with Vucevic. Caruso would be their best defender on guards good at pick and rolls."
Or Zach Lavine
"It’s Zach Lavine and Lamelo with everything but his jumper for me, but PG definitely in that top 5. Dude is SMOOTH.   But best believe I’m gonna be back on that Wayoff P train once the playoffs come in or if they’re playing the Lakers."
Zach Lavine for me. The Bulls essentially built a win-now team around him even though he's a 1x all star with an unproven playoff record
Zach Lavine is pretty good looking
Yeah but Zach Lavine is easier on the eyes if you catch my drift
"zach boutta put the comparison to rest this season. Booker is a really great player and will be an all-star for a long time, but Lavine is just another level. He has slightly better shooting along with much better iso scoring. Plus he is just more fun to watch imo."
Zach Lavine is better than Devin Booker. Don’t @ me
I get this feeling that Chicago public school products Nunn and THT are probably somehow going to be worked into a S+T for the other recent Klutch Sport signee Zach Lavine in a season? I'll also bet that NBA is going to have to investigate Klutch Sports if that happens.
"Zach Lavine meets the requirements for the 30% max but not the 35%, he *can’t* be eligible for the 35% until he makes all-nba or has 10 years of service. Nothing is stopping the Bulls from signing this extension (until the season starts).  Super max criteria requires he make all-nba, MVP, or DPOY.  **General Max Rules**: 7-9 years — A player that has completed at least 7 years and no more than 9 years of service can be paid the greater of (i) 30% of the salary cap, or (ii) 105% of the player’s salary for the prior season."
"Can you cite that? I don’t think that’s correct. They shouldn’t have needed cap space to sign guys to an extension. They just have to be extension eligible, which he was. Unless that’s changed since then.  With Zach Lavine it’s a matter of him making all-nba to get the supermax. Nothing to do with salary cap."
Yes. Bird rights are different than extension rights. It’s the same situation the Bulls are in with Zach Lavine now
"&gt; Jimmy butler has the option to bring the ball up the court and create plays from the wing, which to be fair he is really good at  Agreed, I didn't want to get in to things like ""passing ability"" and ""dribbling"" because they were as unfairly slanted towards Jimmy as blocks and rebounds are to KAT so I tried to stick to universal ""skills"" to pose the question of whether a skillset is superior to an impact on winning.  Taking the same question with a more equitable comparison might be something like Devin Booker vs Zach LaVine where the skill set is relatively close so you'd probably have to give the nod to Booker right now for going to the Finals and having a bigger impact on winning."
"This post just exemplifies r/nba imo, it gives off ""Wow Zach Lavine had a crazy season last year, if he repeats it again where does he rank all time for SGs"" vibes"
You guys think my list is valid? 1) serge ibaka  2) kelly oubre  3) paul george  4) jayson tatum  5) gordon hayward  6) Sga  7) Kawhi leonard  8) zach lavine  9) dillon “chad” brooks  10) kyrie irving
"Murray should be back by the playoffs, but he probably won't be at 100% until next season.  A torn ACL is a big deal.  If you look at Zach LaVine, for example, he was off for 11 months but looked pretty rough when he returned.  If Murray is at the same level LaVine was in the playoffs, he's not going to get many meaningful minutes."
Zach LaVine plays w/ his dick out
Kelly Oubre Jr. (KPJ)  Zach Lavine (0G)  PJ Tucker (Tate)  i have no idea (Theis)  John Henson (Cwood)
"Zach Lavine is the best SG out of Mitchell, Booker and Beal and once he gets on a winning team, he’ll prove it. Similarly, Beal is the worst player out of those four. Beal is the least efficient, arguably the worst defender and racks up big points on worse efficiency simply because he’s on a worse team."
Zach LaVine apparently
"Ja was one of my favorite college players ever and I think he can be a top PG in the league,   but he is definitely one of the most overrated players right now. dude got ranked several spots higher than Zach LaVine on both SI and ESPN’s rankings, which is honestly insane"
"That wouldn't solve anything here, and is just a bad idea in general. The problem is Simmons will def not give up a dime, so a clause to exit his contract is irrelevant. He would probably get what like....Zach lavine is worth on market, not what he signed for.  Plus at will usually is in reference to the employer having rights to fire at will, not for player to leave. So if there was a mutual termination clause, fine, but no chance players get the ability to just up and leave a team, that's ridiculous. These guys get paid so much money you can't apply normal employment standards to them, and no one should have much sympathy for that.   The minimum salary for NBA players is like 2.6 mil, average lifetime earnings for American with Bachelor degree is 1.8 mil.   This is simply a unique case of a guy who thinks he is way better than he has ever shown he is and the whole situation all about ego, not basketball skill. The player has every right to not want to be with the team, but if you sign a contract too bad, you can't have long term security and flexibility, same reason I can't have a fixed rate mortgage at the same rate of a variable rate mortgage, it's just economics. The team should have no obligation to facilitate your nonsense when literally no one in or around the NBA thinks he is as good as he thinks. There was no shortage of offers for harden, Leonard, AD....funny how that works."
Zach Lavine isn't a guaranteed thing either. We'll see what he and the Bulls are made of. There's no excuses for them not to make the playoffs.
Anthony Edwards is already pulling his weight on the team. We don't need to wait for him. And the fact that he's playing well already speaks to how good he is going to be when fully developed. Rather keep him around than throw away a good thing for a temporary low playoff seed like the Timberwolves already did with Zach Lavine.
"Zach Lavine. Lots of highlights. Creates his own shot. Can't win.  Yes, because of bad teammates, or because too iso or because cares too much about stats. Whatever the reasons, results are about the same."
"There is no melo hate. He just wasn't that good. Like he was fine. But he's the equivalent of a zach LaVine. A little bit better due to the era he played in, but let's not act like he was actually some sort of crazy elite scorer that should be considered top 25 player of all time. He'd be very lucky to be top 75 all time. And it's currently debatable whether he's top 100 all time."
"Two words:  LONZO BALL, DEMAR DEROZAN, ZACH LAVINE, NIKOLA VUCEVIC, ALEX CARUSO. MUST SEE TV"
"Actually, Lavine has Lillard beat on efficiency last year. FG% from both 2 point and 3 point, EFG% and TS% all went to Zach last year, most of which handily. The only one that was tight was was TS%, and that's just largely that Zach gets less free throw attempts per shot then Dame."
Zach Lavine is Nba 2k9 JR Smith in real life.
They really threw him into the fire! This was the first real game he got minutes and it was to cover Zach Lavine.  Love his playmaking/defense though. I feel like with a bit more experience under his belt he can be a bit of a stud.
"Lavine made 3.4 threes on 41.9% last year. Thompson his last healthy season made 3.1 threes on 40.2% shooting. It is not nearly as bad of a comparison as you think. It should be noted that through their careers Thompson has been much better at 3s than Zach, but Zach is also only 26 so there is no reason to think he will regress. Zach also has a top 5 highest level of difficulty on his threes along with Curry, Trae, Dame, and Luka imo. Defensively though the comparison is unwarranted."
A lot of people questioned why the Bulls would pair Demar with Zach. If you have watched either over the years you could see exactly how they could compliment each other. Zach is incredible playing off ball while Demar has molded himself into a great half court playmaker. He makes everything easier for Zach. Lavine being able to play off ball more has made him godly efficient over these first 2 games. Something like 60/50/90.
"My boy and I was bored and decided to go in-person, I don't know what the hell happened to Zach LaVine at the end of the second quarter but it was like a switch was flipped, can't wait to see this man at the All-Star Game this year ha, great energy at UC tonight, I'm thinking top 4 seed in the conference"
"Nikola Vucevic yelled, “There you go!” Lonzo Ball gave a look of pleasant surprise. Alex Caruso belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Zach Lavine hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Felicio hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"Just got out of Thai prison, is Zach Lavine the best player in the world?"
Zach Lavine
Because he isn't Lonzo Ball or Zach LaVine.
Also Zach lavine
"It's 2021. Joakim's college coach is now HC of the Bulls, except Phil Jackson gave Joakim 72/4 and both are now out of the league. The Bulls are the most exciting they've been since trading Jimmy Buckets, largely because of Zach Lavine. Also, the Cubs won the penant in 2016. Andy Dalton, that very average QB from the Bengals, now starts for the Bears. This guy named Mitch Trubisky gave Chicagoans some hope, but everybody else laughed at them. Also that fat pig from the Apprentice became president."
Zach Lavine &gt; Michael Jordan. Pretty good upgrade.
McGrady put up lots of garbage points. His teams were never good and he never could make it out of the 1st round in his prime. He’s the 2000s version of Zach Lavine
"I'm gonna say something unpopular. I think top to bottom, the Eastern conference is more fun to watch than the West right now. Atlanta is so much fun to watch. The Knicks are fun to watch and have an electric crowd nightly. The Bulls have Zach Lavine and a competent roster now. Charlotte has LaMelo, Milwaukee has Giannis. Philly has Embiid who is 100% shenanigans all the time."
"You just need another player to lower their value to the same as Simmons. Like if Zach Lavine decided to only shoot underhanded, or if Chris Paul came out as a Nazi. Then you could make a trade for one of those guys."
"I wasn't sure from memory if it was that frequent, but I just rewatched the highlights and Jackson was on LaVine all night aside from about 3 buckets. I don't know why Casey didn't try to switch it up. I get the logic that if you put your best defender on LaVine then there's a chance that it sets up DeRozan and Lonzo to get easy looks, but wouldn't you rather take a chance with those guys rather than just letting Zach cook all night long?"
"Heh?  He wasn't even close last year and even a sizable step forward might barely put him in the running for the last spot, which is usually highly competitive.  The last guard in on the East last year was realistically Zach Lavine, who put up a 29/5/5 pre all-star break."
"There was some good some bad, as expected being the first game of the season along with having a mosty new squad.  Overall, we had soo many unforced turnovers, we have to take care of the ball. I think those really took us out of our offensive rhythm early. Also a lot of missed layups you expect will go in as the season progresses.   Defensively, Vuc was getting exposed in the PnR, gotta find ways to adjust to help cover, there was some weak side help issues too, guys being too slow to rotate. I like what I saw from Caruso/Ball. We have some really good on-ball defenders (Lavine included) we just need to key in on help d and rotations.   **Zach**: looked amazing, kept us in the game while others shots weren’t falling.  **Demar**: mostly good, took some awkward forced shots around the rim that he might’ve been able to get a better look or kick out but he had some big midrange shots down the stretch. Didn’t key onto his defense enough to comment.  **Vuc**: still looking for his shot. Glad he got a 3 to go in cause that’s a huge plus to our offensive weapons.   **Ayo**: solid minutes. He gets buckets. If that 3 following his back to back layups went in I was ready to jump outta my seat. A few jitters but I’m liking what I’m seeing, he should be good for a spark here and there.   It was fairly sloppy, but a W is a W and it’s on to the next one!"
"We can really run any of our guards (Zach, Zo, DD) in a two man game with Vuc, in fact I think there was a stretch where LaVine/Vuc kept running a pick and roll and scored 4 straight buckets"

Putting Pete Maravich and West on the same tier is like putting Zach Lavine and Curry on the same tier.
Zach LaVine is something else man. I'm officially on his MVP campaign
"Detroit looked good my man. They’re still young and will have you learn to play in crunch time, but they did a great job holding our offense more most of the game. Zach Lavine just does Zach Lavine stuff tho."
Zach Lavine is Spanish for Zach the Vine
"As a Bulls fan, I truly don’t even see Booker being talked about in the same breath as Lavine. I’m sorry if this comes across as me being ignorant but Zach Lavine is without a doubt a better player then Devin Booker. If anyone can enlighten me, I’d appreciate it but from where I’ve been sitting the last 2 years its straight up highway robbery to say Devin Booker is better then Zach Lavine.   I’m sorry but Zach Lavine ain’t the same player he was 2-3 years ago. Everyone get your heads out of your asses and realize this man is top 15 in the league. Top 20 even if 15 is too hard a pill to swallow. Is Devin Booker top 15? Top 20? I just don’t see it. Please tell me I’m wrong."
When did Zach Lavine become this type of player
"Zach Lavine has put up numbers but until he can do it for a consistent winner in high stakes games, I don’t think you can call him a superstar. He’s not a top 10 player in the league. I get that he’s an all star. But I’ll ask you a question here: how far can a team with him as the best player go? If you say first round of the playoffs, I’ll say that’s not that intriguing and he ain’t a superstar."
"Zach ""Despite the ... *checks notes* win?"" Lavine"
"Uh, his name is Zach Lavine and he was an All-Star last season and the 7th best player in PPG with 27.4. maybe you should watch some games, league pass is free for the week. Then maybe you'll see it"
Zach Lavine is good at putting the ball in the hoop.
Zach Lavine I love you
Zach Lavine I love you
And the team is still Zach Lavine and some fucking stiffs
This dude moves like Zach LaVine in Derrick Henry’s body
That’s a weird way to spell Zach Lavine
"The Bulls are First Team All ""Oh Yeah... That Guy"". I would love it if they were good but they're currently struggling against the Pistons and they have a collection of players who are all either complete fucking nobodies or dudes who've only ever put up empty stats on bad teams.  And Zach Lavine, who at least puts up *good* stats on bad teams, but has never played on a team that wasn't bad."
"Once, just once, I want to see Zach Lavine on a good team."
Saw the commercial with Zach Lavine and almost didn’t recognize him.
"Nikola Vucevic, Patrick Williams, Demar Derozan, Zach LaVine, Lonzo Ball  Vs.   Joakim Noah, Carlos Boozer, Rip Hamilton, Luol Deng, Derrick Rose.   I think it’d be a close game but I’d give the edge to the 11/12 Bulls. They were the first overall seed for a reason."
"?? I literally gave you an exact definition. The Bulls have no top 20 players on their team. Zach Lavine is not a top 20 player in the league until he proves it. He very well could prove it this year, but I, and I would say most people, do not have him there yet. Just checked a few lists, they all have him hovering in the 25-30 range."
I saw him in that commercial with Zach Lavine and all I could think is “Man did Zion get BIGGER??”
Zach Lavine was literally an Olympian last year.
"Zach Lavine: ""Wow, I can't believe Mountain Dew gave me all this money to be in a commercial.""  Zion: ""Wow, I can't believe Mountain Dew gave me all this Mountain Dew to be in a commercial."""
I swear it was Zach Lavine not Tatum
"[This isn't just a picture, its a whole commercial feat. Zach LaVine. Doesn't help that they advertised fuckin' Mountain Dew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl7WKJWhRNw)"
They acquired some good talent in the off-season. High bb IQ and passing ability alone should have us seeing some flashy pyrotechnics. Also Zach Lavine is outstanding
7ft Zach Lavine = KD with insane athleticism.   League fucked.
Zach Lavine is underrated.  And I'm taking Lebron and Steph over Giannis sorry (not sorry).
Zach LaVine
"Sports medicine has a big impact on sports. Training, rehab, skill development, etc. Think about how back in the day an ACL tear was a massive deal but now you have players like Zach LaVine not losing a step after it. It even the Achilles tear which was a career ending injury but now you have KD bouncing back from it like nothing happened. This also applies to training, Michael Jordan doing weight training after running into the Bad Boys was some revolutionary thing while now it's just regular thing. On top of that thanks to improvements in technology and medicine athletes are better able to train effectively as well as recover more quickly. These are basic facts that other sports acknowledge except for nephews such as yourself refuse to."
"True CP3 was a huge factor in a Finals berth, but wasn't really the difference between Booker missing the playoffs like Zach did though, the team was half a game out the year before with a league-average PG in the stronger conference. LaVine will need to sacrifice some stats too if he wants to see postseason success"
Zach Lavine &gt; Booker. Mfs still ridin that 70 point wave🤦🏾‍♂️
Zach Lavine wins MVP.
A little bit ago I had to defend my comment that devin booker is better than Zach Lavine and it became a heated debate so yeah
Zach Lavine = MVP
Zach Lavine MVP. The bulls take the 2 seed in the East and Lavine gets MVP Lonzo gets MIP. Lavine will average 30/6/4   Lonzo will average 18/9/8
The Butler trade did net the Bulls Zach LaVine though.
"Yeah, he doesn't do Aaron Gordon/Zach LaVine type dunks, but those aren't even feasible in game. Giannis cleared an entire 6'6'' person while dunking. That's exciting"
"Re: the recent Draft --  This year's draft will likely go down as one full of moderate hits, one or two grand slams, and big misses. The moderate hits will be Cade and Green, each of whom will likely be all stars at some point. Neither will have the massive impact of a genuine superstar, however, like Kawhi or Jokic etc. Sengun and Giddey are both more promising superstars than Green and Cade because while they have lower floors, they both also have higher ceilings. Sengun is likely to have a high percentile outcome and Giddey's home run outcomes are considerably better than Cade or Green's 75th percentile outcomes.  Barnes was likely the best draft pick after Mobley and has as good odds of being the best player of the group in 5-6 years as anyone in the draft. Mitchell tops out as a good starter and Kuminga was a high risk pick. That said, Barnes' defense is overrated and his shooting was underrated.  Non-draft related hot takes:  Volume scorers with small builds aren't worth building a franchise around outside of rare exceptions (e.g. Curry), so Devin Booker, Zach Lavine, etc. are all low or mid-tier all stars and likely always will be. The Bulls will not make the conference finals without significant help from injuries and if they do make it there, they won't get more than 1 win."
Zach lavine is getting mvp
"Created a toxic locker room lmao.  Dude look at your organization.  How toxic is the Knicks locker room hmmm?  How toxic was the bulls locker room when they were dominating the East.  You just don’t want to admit you organizations’ own failings.  The locker room was toxic because KAT and Wiggins don’t have a winning mentality.  Secondly Zach lavine and your teams composition might not have allowed Murray to thrive like that. He came in as a shooting guard remember.  Even then that doesn’t negate my argument.  He has made mistakes yes,  but he also does a lot of really good shit.  What’s so hard about admitting things aren’t black and white and people are complicated.  Grow up"

"I'd argue he's one of the only empty stats guys. Most people who put up big stats on a weak team would still be good on a good team (DBook, KAT, Trae, Zach Lavine, all guys accused of being empty stats at one point or another). I'm not sure if Drummond is all that good."
"Suppose so. Idk, no one's heard of pat mccaw but they may have heard of kemba walker or Zach Lavine"
"I thought Divincenzo would become a starting quality player   On the other hand, I was not a Poole believer  But then again, I thought Embiid would get healthy and wreck the league, which he has  On the other hand, I thought Giannis hype had no substance for a long time   But then again, I thought Zach Lavine would turn into an all star when he was traded to Chicago   I guess I’ve had so many hot takes that some were bound to be true lol  I was huge on Luka before he was even being discussed as a big time prospect though, which I’m proud of"
"First no MJ would not have been a 40% 3pt shooter. That's just ridiculous. KD isn't a consistent 40% 3pt shooter. He oscillates between about 42% and 36% from 3 with this year being a major exception.   2ndly probably only one player in the league has the kind of vertical Burst MJ had and is a great 3pt shooter. Zach LaVine and even then he's not as athletic after his acl injury, he's only had 1 season shooting above 40% from 3 (also reports says he works relentlessly in the gym so it isn't just hard work). Also MJs shooting form was 2 motion. Again that's very unlikely to allow you to shoot consistently from 3, but is generally necessary to control your power when shooting. Again zach LaVine is pretty much the only volume 3pt shooter without a 1 motion shot.  It's such a bullshit argument to say MJ would be a 40% 3pt shooter. There were other players in MJs era who didn't shoot from 3 with high volume but were still precise. Guys who made their livings taking similar shots to MJ jjst not getting bailed out as much by the refs. Mullin, Reggie etc.  Now I still think MJ is 1 or 2 all time. I can't decide but let's not act like he was some flawless demigod. Like he'd maybe end up with a respectable 3pt shot like LeBron but to claim he'd go any further in that area is just madness because that wasn't one of his skills and you can't project that."
"LaVine best 2 Guard in the game. Don’t gimme no Book, no Mitchell, no World B Flat. It’s that dude Zach  Y’all got Vuc comin back healthy and he mad underrated. He a top-tier big  Good additions in Derozan (playmaking), Ball (versatility, perimeter D) and Caruso (Defense + intangibles/doing the right thing)  Last year yall basically only had LaVine, who was hurt, and a bunch of scrubs and yall barely missed out on playoffs..  Healthy LaVine + Healthy Vuc + 3 wonderful additions … yall scary af and anyone who aint fearin the Bulls next year gon get they asses mopped on the floor"
Zach LaVine is going to be an unrestricted free agent next off-season. It sure looks like the Bulls have minimal interest in signing him.
"Uhhh, that's easily the MVP.  Edit: Wait, this is about Zach Lavine? Nvm then. Empty stats garbage player."
That honestly sounds like zach lavine lmao
Zach Lavine did not shoot 90% from the FT line last year
"I see Rudy Gobert as a liability in key playoff games, he's almost unplayable at times. He's a good player, great defender, but I just have no idea why anyone would build a franchise around Rudy Gobert instead of guys like Zion or Zach Lavine.   &gt; Rudy's arguably the most important player on a team that had the point differential of a 74 win team  This kinda cherry picked nonsense is boring, they didn't win 74 games even if they had the ""point differential of one"", they definitely didn't play like one. And no, Mitchell is very obviously their best player, he has to save their ass every time in the playoffs and whatever he does still isn't enough as they get eliminated."
I guess some Laker fans just don't read because where did I say AD should or shouldn't leave? No one said Zach Lavine is better than Lebron. I just feel like he would be a better fit in a trio with Lavine and Vucevic than Russ and Lebron. They already have to figure it out. AD would adapt easier in that Bulls trio. Leave all those make believe narratives in your subreddit.
Last time I checked it was the preseason. But I guess they should just blow it up Bc they lost in the preseason. Zach Lavine all of a sudden better than lebron lmao.
"I have no idea why anyone would rank Rudy Gobert over guys like Zion, Jrue Holiday, Zach Lavine, etc."
And yet him and his agency still signs major clients like Zach LaVine. He must be doing something right if his major clients haven’t abandoned him and he still continues to sign new ones
My favorite part of that HORSE game was seeing all of the players' backyards. Zach Lavine looks like has basically has a whole sports complex behind his house.
Zach Lavine who never led a team to the playoffs.  Vince Carter is one of the top 20 scorers in history.  He's top in games played.  Plus 2000 and 01 Vince is better than any Lavine season ever.  That's just stupid.
Dwight making it for sure.  No way loser Vince should make it. Zach LaVine and Donovan Mitchell have already peaked higher lmao
"**High:** Anthony Edwards, not saying hes already reached his potential but I always believed in his Superstar upside despite the massive critics.  **Wrong:** Zach Lavine, always thought he had star potential on the Wolves but I never thought hed reach it due to the huge injury risk and him tearing his ACL made me lose faith."
"There are a few ways player can fall into this category. You have players who stats don't reflect their actual value, you have players that put up great numbers but only do so because they're on a bad team, and then you have guys that actively hurt their team in their quest for numbers. Drummond has fallen between 1 and 3 throughout his career. It doesn't mean he's a bad player, it's just he's taking on a role offensively that doesn't lead to a good offense.  The middle group is really interesting and I think we are seeing a lot more players in that group. These would be guys like Zach Lavine and Collin Sexton. I know initially that sounds ridiculous and it's not saying they're bad players. Quite the opposite, all are great players and could contribute to contending teams. They're just not going to put up those numbers on good teams. They're great scorers and carried their team's offense, but they were on bad teams. I really think Lavine will be a much better player this year by getting to play off the ball more and not be responsible for playmaking, but his stats will likely take a bit of a dip despite being more impactful in the winning department."
"Right: Luka, Trae, MPJ, Zach Lavine  Wrong: Lonzo, Dennis Smith Jr, Mo Bamba, Jarrett Culver"

"""They need a go to scorer besides Jimmy""  This is the #1 weakness of the Heat, they don't have an elite or dynamic scorer on that team. If they had someone like Zach Lavine, they would easily be contenders"
"It's because Luke sucks absolute ass. It doesn't matter that Buddy Hield is the 3rd best shooter in the league because Luke has him running sets as the primary ball handler giving up lobs to Damion Jones instead of shooting and having someone distribute to him. He puts Cory Joseph in at an average of 24 minutes a game last season and put him up against Zach Lavine for 36 minutes and literally gives him career highlights.   Like I said ***on paper*** the kings are better outside of their 2 best players 1:1. But in practice they are not.   The options right now on the kings are:  1. Fox 2. Haliburton 3. Hield 4. Barnes  Those are the top scoring/playing options on the Kings at the moment. Luke will find a way to fuck this up.   Basketball is complex in it's simplicity and you are just playing for inches at a time. The fit and playstyle of the kings doesn't fit with the roster. They are one of the slowest in pace with the fastest player in the league. Luke plays free dribble basketball and ONLY plays man to man defense. Literally high school level coaching shit. The team just isn't fit well together and doesn't have the stopping power needed on defense to make any kind of serious run. We'll see how it works this season with the roster change, but I don't have any hopes really. We were 9-10th in scoring last season and dead last in defense. Blazers made it to the playoffs with 12th scoring and 25th defense. So realistically if we just had literally average or even just below average by all metrics we should make the playoffs. But somehow, some way, Luke will try to make this into a Might Ducks feelgood movie moment and play our 15th man at a crucial point in the game to try to create some kind of heartfelt breakout moment or some shit. I just know it. He'll sub Fox out for like Justin James or some shit."
Zach Lavine
"Lavine and Booker have remarkable similar stats that would help indicate how much of a ball hog a player is.  &amp;#x200B;  ||Lavine|Booker| |:-|:-|:-| |FGA|19.4|19.2| |APG|4.9|4.3| |TOV|3.5|3.1| |AST/TOV|1.4|1.39| |USG%|31.0|32.7|  I don't think its fair to call one of these players a ball hog while saying the other isn't. Zach takes mores shots, and gets more assists while turning the ball over more Booker (they have essentially the same Ast/Tov ratio). He has a lower USG% than Book. But differences in any of these categories is pretty minimal."
He's going to be his own Zach LaVine story
Zach Lavine was 51/42/85 last season? 63TS% to Booker's 59% (48/34/87).  He's literally been a more efficient scorer since Booker entered the league.
"&gt;Lol. I absolutely know that.   Im sure you ""absolutely"" knew Miami was making the finals in the bubble, and that Hawks would make the ECF last year, and that Bucks was winning it all vs Suns in the finals. Every single year we see teams surprisingly overperform/underperform and its impossible to know how a season is going to play out.   &gt;What, is Zach Lavine good enough to lead a championship team that features a defense that couldn't defend my grandmother?  Yawn. How many times can this be repeated? We were ranked 12th defensively last year and if anything we upgraded our roster defensively, our worst defender this year in Derozan will be replacing Lauri Markkanen who was also one of the worst defenders in the league. Everything so far indicates that we will be atleast average defensively."
"I, a biased fan, am very excited to see Zach this year. I think with all the weapons we will have on the court, he will get the best looks of his life. He's already a ridiculous 3 level scorer and I can't imagine what his efficiency could be this year. Lavine could sneak into a 3rd team if things go really really well. But we will see!"
* Bulls being better off with Zach Lavine being the first option instead of Lauri Markkanen. * Terry Rozier being good in Charlotte  * Hawks beating the Sixers  * Heat being good immediately after the Jimmy Butler trade.
"Lol. I absolutely know that. If you're one of those guys who thinks every year that a ton of teams compete for the championship, then you need to think harder because basketball is incredibly top heavy. What, is Zach Lavine good enough to lead a championship team that features a defense that couldn't defend my grandmother?"
And Zach Lavine if the T Wolves gave up Wiggins instead
Zach Lavine top 5 in MVP voting Lakers have a mediocre regular season  Jordan Poole MIP  Jalen Green 22/3/4
Zach Lavine
"I strongly disagree with this take (it's Vince or Nique, full stop), but I would like to say that while I was watching the Summer Olympics I had the thought that Zach LaVine would have made an incredible volleyball player.  Height, length, effortless bounce and incredible hang-time are all there, you could easily imagine LaVine skying to spike the shit out of the ball on some poor saps.  He's a great basketball player but in an alternate universe it feels like he could've been the GOAT volleyball player."
"I don't think many people realize the situation he inherited in Minnesota:   1. His dad Flip drafted KAT and Zach Lavine, traded for Andrew Wiggins and built a very solid young core. Go watch highlights of some of our games from Flips last year + Sam Mitchell's year (the season after Flip died) and there was a lot of potential there. We beat the Warriors at Oracle during their 73-9 season and you could just tell something was clicking. Wolves fans had **never** experienced what it was like to have a promising ""Big 3"" like that before. I still would take that core over Dlo/Edwards/KAT today.   2. Thibs came in and blew it all up. He traded Lavine, restructured the roster, the environment, brought in Jimmy, changed Wiggins' role (Flip was very open and calculated in his development of Wiggins, and I think he knew that he had to use Wiggs in a very specific way) and Thibs basically just put Wiggs in the corner and had Jimmy run point forward.   3. After the Thibs + Jimmy experiment, things are blown up again. Wiggins' confidence is shot, he was a completely different player before Thibs. KAT is no longer the younger confident guy, his head is starting to get bigger and he's starting to get treated like the cornerstone of the franchis. Ryan was handed the keys to a very unstable and unremarkable roster and overall situation.   4. I still think the blowing up of the original 3 of KAT-Wiggins-Lavine + Rubio was a mistake and one good season under Thibs doesn't erase that. Once Thibs and Jimmy left, we really didn't have anything positive to work with. Ryan was never going to win a lot of games with that roster.   Lastly, I don't think Ryan is a championship coach, but he's not a bad coach. Players in both MN and DC have all said amazing things about him. KG has always loved him. He's not great but he's also not an inept ""daddy's boy"" that only got the job due to nepotism."
"This opinion may change if they start to gel better but right now Zach Lavine. Love him as a player and person, but man, he can single handedly shoot us out of a game. I know he’s had to do it for so long, but he’s gotta trust the others to help him now that they actually have a team. I’m all for him proving me wrong too!"
Zach Lavine does
"ZLV has always been a juiced up/glorified Kevin Martin/Monta Ellis.  Literally, throughout his entire career as a basketball player (HS, college, pros, whatever), his team has \*always\*, always, been much better when he is on the bench.  The same rings true today     He is an offensive dynamo &amp; a brilliant individual scorer, but as a \*basketball player\*, he is dumber than a bag of moldy bird sh\*t.  Seriously, one of the dumber players that you will ever see, relative to his stats     He's a mediocre ball handler, a poor passer, a poor defender, and overall has cringey BBiQ.  There are stretches throughout the season, where Zach LaVine resembles Charlie Kelly in ""The Gang Gives Back"" episode, where Charlie is hammerfaced-drunk &amp; reffing the park district kiddie basketball game.  This embarrassingly low BBiQ is magnified because ZLV has such sky-high usage     He is very lucky that the Bulls chose to keep him around, despite him being one of the last remnants of the Paxson Plague, and he should be thanking his lucky stars if he does not get traded over the off-season &amp; AKME decide to make him a part of future plans, because ZLV desperately needs the Chicago Bulls, they do not need him; aside from being a career-loser, he also doesn't put butts in seats.  The fact that someone with his outlier athleticism &amp; ability to score the ball is \*still\* unable to be a money draw while playing for the biggest freaking sports brand in the history of organized athletics, is beyond pathetic.  Kirk g0dd@mn Hinrich brought more people out to the Madhouse than this wet noodle"
"I mean i will vote for him. And i never liked kyrie whatsoever. But the meme and the fact of the joke that the nba is basketball second and entertainment first makes this a logical choice.  Gonna be something like Ben Simmons, Kurie Irving, Zach Lavine, Demar Derozan (if hes coonted as a big) and Embiid."

"He's never been that guy though. Not with the Lakers, not with the Pels, and not now. He's timid when it comes to attacking the rim. There's a reason his career average is only 1.2 free throw attempts per game, with the highest ever being only 1.4 FTA/gm in his rookie year. I remember that season people were shitting on his FT% and my response was always that his attempts were so low it was tough to tell how real his percentage is. This is Lonzo's fifth year in the league and he's only taken 256 FTs total for his entire career. For a comparison, Zach LaVine took 298 FTs last year despite only playing in 58 games and DeRozan took 440 in only 61 games.   Lonzo would be a much better player if he attacked the rim, but he's just not that guy, and I suspect he may never be."
"I mean it just wasn’t a smart pick, Jalen Green can maybe turn into Zach Lavine where as Mobley can be AD without the injury issues."
"In their next game, against the Sixers, Zach Lavine had zero fouls in 38 minutes.  Lavine should get some defensive pointers from Caruso in exchange for some offensive skills tutoring"
Holy shit zach lavine has been in Chicago 5 years where has time gone
"Well yes, I’m just saying we can’t really blame the olympics for Tatum’s slow start. Maybe Durant’s not the best example because he’s the best player in the NBA right now, but Zach LaVine also looks fine.  Maybe it’s a combination of everything? Honestly I can’t say for sure."
Uhh Zach Lavine?
"Zach LaVine has had 10+ blocks in every game this season besides 8. So if you just ignore those 8 games and act like they didnt happen then he would probably be the leader too, just like Myles."
"I think he’s a better lateral athlete than Zach. He can create so much space with step backs laterally as well as pull back dribbles. I also think he explodes with more force around the basket than Zach does. Not saying he’s bouncier, but he just seems less floaty and more powerful in the air even though they’re both super skinny and Jalen is bad at finishing through contact right now.   But he doesn’t have the same type of pure stroke that Zach has. Zach has incredible balance, form, and lift on his shot. He’s similar to dame in that way, where he can elevate over you with his normal form while staying on balance while also creating great separation.   They being said Jalen is way more refined at the same age. He’s been better as player at 18yo than pretty much any current gen star SG including Beal, Booker, jaylen, and Lavine."
"It's not easy to be as good of a shooter as Zach Lavine, the athleticism and explosiveness is there for sure, though."
"I think he'll get to where Zach LaVine is *faster* than LaVine did, but I'm not sure if he'll be better. I hope so, obviously."
"he'll be like Zach LaVine, but Jalen will be better imo"
filipino zach lavine
Zach Lavine clone in the making. Needs the ball more tbh. I still believe him and KPJ can be a duo just needs time.
"I think Zach should be the first option thru the game, he’s the more efficient and volume scorer (even tho demar is underrated there) but in crunch time share the ball 1a 1b with derozan, cuz honestly derozan might be your best option to just get a bucket  Also, no disrespect to demar, but we’ve seen his potential as a lead scorer in the playoffs, and it’s not superstar level. Lavine really could get there, so it’s worth letting him handle things"
DeRozan is bigger than Lavine   Thybulle is a shut down defender but DeMar was able to move the furniture when Matisse was on him which Zach can’t do  Edit: DeMar has 20 lbs on Thybulle so he can’t get bullied
"Watching Zach Lavine play, it’s not even close in terms of “missed calls”. Lavine should’ve gone to the line at least 5-6 more times last night"
"a lot of factors contributed to it, and zach lavine could have done better with the turnovers and better shot selection (the bulls been struggling with shot selection the last few games), but the thing is, this situation is entirely new to him. Hes been having to carry the bulls the last few years, and he’s still not out of the habits caused by that it seems. I dont blame him, this team is new, and weve exceeded expectations thus far, and itll only get better with more playtime as a team.   Not to mention, he has an injured thumb, which surely has affected his ball handling and apparently his 3 game.   Side note: when coby gets back itll add some much need scoring from the bench, which will help."
"The Chicago Bulls of Los Angeles  Lonzo Ball - UCLA + Chino Hills CA  Alex Caruso - Lakers Champion  DeMar Derozan - USC + Compton, CA  Zach Lavine - UCLA  Nikola Vucevic - USC"
"&gt; you could see how quickly he attacked anytime we had curry, maxey or kork on him  Well yeah. That’s what the best scorers in the NBA do. Zach is elite at attacking mismatches. I do think Zach was frustrated cause even in these highlights he straight up missed some rhythm threes and other shots. That will def frustrate a guy like Zach. Not necessarily cause of Thybulle. They both got theirs vs each other with Thybulle having the block and Zach just getting his as he does vs anyone.   I didn’t walk away from this game thinking Thybulle had locked up DeRozan or Lavine. (Though Thybulle played a great game). In fact pretty sure every Thybulle foul happened when he was on Zach.  I did walk away thinking the Sixers are nightmares to play in how they attack the passing lanes and press up on us whenever we screen knowing we didn’t have many answers offensively for when Embiid was in the paint.   Our off ball movement was really bad in the 4th. Need to improve on that for Saturday. Should be a fun game, both coaches brought out great game plans. Really liked how Billy just sat Vuc outside to force Embiid out there whenever possible."
"Zach LaVine when guarded by Matisse Thybulle: 3-11 FG (27.3% FG%), 1-4 3PT ( 25% 3P% ) and 4 Turnovers."
By your logic the only reason Zach Lavine is making the playoffs is because DeRozan is carrying them there?  It's such reductive reasoning.
iF zAcH laViNE iS sO gOOd whY haSn'T hE maDE The plAYofFs?
Zach LaVine asked for help and accidentally became the second best player on his team
Zach Lavine is an amazing athlete and scorer but God damn is his tunnel vision frustrating to watch. He watches 3-4 defenders collapse on him going downhill off a screen and almost never passes back to the wide open screener. He needs to learn a pick and pop game badly
FUCK ZACH Lavine /s  THIS DEMAR TEAM NOW
Philly is playing very good nice game to see as a first for the season ahahahaha Zach lavine is very good too!
"&gt;Seriously, why are people in this sub so eager to proclaim brand new players as either busts or future HOF guys? He's coming in totally cold because he didn't get a chance to ramp up due to an injury. Let's wait a while before acting like this is what is to be expected of him.  To be fair, Deadspin would do this every year back in the day lol. They'd always release some article around Nov.-Dec. ""All of these NBA Players are Butt."" ROFL.   On a hilarious note, they were largely right but one year Zach Lavine was on it hahahaha"
"Personally not a huge fan of green, but that’s because I like to look for top 10 potential in prospects, and I don’t see it.   However, I can see a better version of Zach lavine as his ceiling, which is still a great player, just not a player archetype I’m overly high on. Very slight frame, poor playmaker who doesn’t project to ever be an offensive engine, I’d rather gamble on two way prospects like Suggs, Barnes, mobley or take the risk on giddey"
"I'd take Lamelo before. Guard rotation in the east: Lamelo, Harden, Jalen Brown, Trae Young, Zach Lavine, Beal, Holiday. Front court: Durant, Butler, DeRozan, Randell, Embid, Giannis, Tatum. To get to 15 I'd take Bam, Sabonis and maybe then Herro"
"A real superstar would be able to carry his team to an eighth seed in the east after five years… but sure, Zach Lavine sUpeRstARd lol.  Do you know how crazy you sound the way you cite some advanced stats like they’re the gospel over ACTUAL RESULTS?  And then using that as evidence that your brain is on another level? Its fucking hilarious. Thank you for making my day."
"you're joking..of course Mitch gets traded for prime Kareem. If you posted right now in the Knicks subreddit ""hey for some reason Denver wants to trade Jokic for Mitchell Robinson"" no shit every single person is going to say yes  a Tyler Herro for Lowry trade is one that Toronto wins, same goes when trading RJ Barrett for prime Jordan or Zach Lavine"
"I think that's fair.   I tend to be very strict when it comes to these labels and that's mostly me being a choosy asshole more than anything else.  You can certainly make an argument for the rest of the top 10 players in the league and it'd be very difficult for me to argue against it. Luka, Dame, Jokic, and Embiid certainly are must watch players.  I feel pretty confident in saying that Tatum isn't a superstar yet though. He's comfortably in the same category as players like Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Jaylen Green, KAT, and Zach LaVine (I'm probably missing a few guys here). Each of these guys certainly have upwards projections."
"2 recent ones for the wolves:      1.) The trade that sent Zach Lavine to chicago in return for Jimmy Butler was originally going to send Andrew Wiggins instead, until Glen Taylor decided to get involved, and forced thibs to trade lavine instead.      2.) When Kyrie was requesting a trade from the cavs in 2017, he had 4 listed preferred landing spots. One of these four, believe it or not, was Minnesota"
Kings could have signed Zach Lavine while he was an RFA (Bulls matched) and drafted Luka in the same offseason.   PG: Fox  SG: LaVine  SF: Luka  PF: Literally anyone  C: Holmes
"Pretty recent, that was December 8, 2018. Just under 3 years ago. I know the team has gone through some changes recently, but holy hell, Zach Lavine is the only remaining player from that squad. Donovan brought in his own coaching staff and then there's AKME.   Forget ""the bulls"", the fourth quarter fire we saw last night must fall squarely on the shoulders of Lavine and equipment manager John Ligmanowski."
"So far this year the Bulls have used Derozan a lot with the 2nd team, where he kind of plays the 4, sort of, except that DJJ or Troy Brown covers the better of the forwards, leaving Derozan to do what he does. In crunch time, yes, absolutely, he plays the ""4"" and they do some really big-time positionless basketball out there. I've seen Lonzo Ball covering a team's top forward in that situation - he was lined up on Julius Randle down the stretch vs. the Knicks, for instance. Zach Lavine has also kind of lowkey started playing good solid defense himself and so, again, Derozan gets to cover the least effective player 2-4 there (Caruso handles the 1 / point of attack although even there the Bulls have not been afraid of doing some ""blue"" coverage of him on bigs, by which I mean putting him in between the ballhandler and the big man when the big is in the post to deny him the ball).  I will say that part of positionless ball is that very often it's the guy who plays the ""4"" who is the less effective of a team's 2 forwards offensively because the other guy is a wing. So in that respect, sure, if you were to log his defensive matchups you'd probably see like 50% of those going to whoever is considered the 4 on the court. And of course, this is mostly what he did last year with the Spurs as well: basketball-reference lists him as 69% ""PF"" last year, though the same positionless caveats apply."
"Hes the cp3 of yall team. Zach lavine is still devin booker but in the clutch, leading the team and making the plays, its still derozan as the mvp. Controversial to say given its been zachs team and he scores more and hits 3s but derozan still seems to be the best guy there. Lavine has a higher ceiling though"
"And you know Tatum isn't on the level of these guys either, and yet he's not sharing the ball. Meanwhile, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, and Zach Lavine who are more in Tatum's tier have no problem deferring and using their skill to open up opportunities for their teammates."
"If the bulls are winning, and just need to last a possession or two longer to ice the game, then I like it with Demar. His steady presence and care for the ball is preferable over Lavine.  But down a couple/few points in the last couple minutes? You just have to go to Zach. Truly one of the best scorers in the league. DeMar really needs favorable mismatches to get his best stuff on offense I think"
"east all stars right now: starters - Zach Lavine, Lamelo Ball, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Durant, Giannis bench - Demar Derozan, Julius Randle, Trae Young, Brad Beal, Miles Bridges, Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid  after that there’s still guys like OG, Harden, Middleton, etc... who’ll be in the running. Depending on injuries I can maybe see Brown making it."
"Alright we can go through the East to see why  Durant Harden Kyrie Beal Trae Giannis Joel Tatum Butler  9 guys in my opinion are definitely better  The guys Lavine is competing with   Khris Brown  Randle Bam Sabonis Demar Lamelo  I think Lavine should be an allstar but the East is full of talented players. 12 guys will make the team and Zach probably falls in the bottom 4-5 players of that list.   It’s not an unreasonable take to say he’s borderline. If he misses a couple games or his stats dip, he won’t make it."
"Last night Zach Lavine had 4 or 5 straight shots that were literally half way down and rattled out, I wonder if that had to do with the new ball"
And Zach Lavine has been playing with a bad thumb for the past 3-4 games.
"I feel like on the other side of the universe reading this.   Zach LaVine was criticized in GarPax era for his lack of play making. And my narrative has always been. ""Who would Zach pass the ball to(back then)?"" Bulls roster in GarPax era was so bad. The rest of the four players playing with Zach refused to shoot the ball.    Now that Zach has DeMar, Vooch and teammates who can either shoot threes or finish at the rim. He is averaging almost 5 assists per game. 7 assists tonight."
"Zach Lavine has always been that dude, now you add a big baller and dekobe debryant? wrap it up boys the bulls run the east."
"It can work if one player sacrifices. Look at my Bulls right now. People didn’t think Lavine and DeRozan could play together, but they can. Lavine shifted more to playing off-ball and DeMar gets touches in the half court. They defer to whomever has the hottest hand. If DeMar is cooking, Zach makes sure he gets the ball and vice versa.   This is what Brown and Tatum must do. Tatum in particular needs to play off ball to hopefully be more efficient."
The most Kobe like player today is Zach Lavine.
Zach lavine and Alex Caruso 😤
"The guy embodied the team's culture. Work hard, and it'll pay off. The man came from UCLA with a bad jumper. He left as the team's leading scorer, and had Zach LaVine level efficency."
"Zach Lavine baby, and great team defense/effort"
Zach Lavine looks like the son of a villian in a 90s action movie  I've heard him speak but a russian accent would fit him
"I mean these are just going to come down to some really subjective measures. Like what weighs more heavily? Current playoff success,potential for the future/how much longer they will be around,team success,individual stats etc? But anyway ill give it a shot. Ill be upfront and say Playoff success/performance with the note that if you play in the playoffs enough times you will eventually shit the bed. Past playoff success and potential success weigh pretty high for me though. Team leadship,future potential/current level also matter to me. So here goes my ranking...with obvious bias. Amount of playoff performances/their experience in the post season definitely impact my rankings though.   PG=Butler&gt;Booker&gt;Mitchell&gt;Beal=Tatum&gt;Ja&gt;Lavine  PG and Butler teams had many battles with Lebron in the East during his prime and I would argue both were his biggest rivals. Bulls,Pacers,Heat/Cav’s games/series in both the regular season and the playoffs were absolutely great to watch. Honestly I consider them pretty equal...i mean Kawhi was open to team with either of them. Also Jimmy has been to the finals and won the East before PG did it lol.   Booker is still growing and last year was his first playoff series/great regular season. I think he has a very high ceiling though and will eventually surpass PG and Butler on an individual level though. Plus he’s been to the finals. Mitchell is in a similar boat he’s a star and definitely can surpass PG and Butler with a few more post season runs.  Than i have Beal and Tatum as equals. Beal is usually a better individual player in the regular season but hasn’t gotten past the second round yet. Tatum can put up some good stats as well less flashy than Beal but i say it evens out since Tatum has been to the Conference finals twice in four years and was part of the team that took the Lebron led Cav’s to 7 games. Had to deal with Kyrie the next year,than took the Heat to six in the ECF and lost to the Nets last season.  My rankings hurt JA because he has less playoff experience than the other players on the list but again his potential is high and i can see the Grizzlies being a team that will stay competitive in the West for a long time. He just needs more experience and his rank will rise.   Again...Zach is hurt since I am rating these players using their playoff experience along with their regular season performance.    Basically...PG and Butler have been around longer and have more post and even regular season experience than the other players.    To put it another way  S-Tier-most experience in the league which is valuable. Mostly were rivals to Lebron in the regular and Postseason. Both are equal. Lebron/injuries are usually these guys worst enemies.   Jimmy PG  A-Tier-High potential and will likely join S tier after a few more seasons/postseasons of greatness. Booker is at the top because he’s made it to the finals.   Booker Mitchell Tatum  Beal  B-Tier-Have shown great talent at an individual level and in the regular season but are inexperienced in the playoffs.   Ja Zach   Just my personal ratings. I consider losing or getting embarrassed/playing like trash in the playoffs to be more valuable in this case than having none.  Also none of these guys have won a championship so it’s fair to weigh the amount of times they have been in the playoffs and how far they have gotten.  Experience is basically what separates S and A tier for me."
"Zach Lavine, Coby White, Lonzo Ball, Demar, Vuc.  Get to keep pretty much our starting lineup while also being able to continue the hopefully future core of Lavine, Ball, White"
"I gotta go with Mike Conley.   He gets spoken about like a top 5 pg alot back then in the grit and grind era. He gets paid like devin Booker Zach lavine level. He got put into the the all star game last season for being being ""snub"" all those years.   Half his accomplishments will be broken by ja morant by 5 seasons.   Then kemba walker. He shoots below average and he's only been able to go to the playoffs I think twice in that decade.  Then mike D toni  as a coach. Other than doc rivers which is obvious for many reasons has been soooo lucky to be put in opportunities to coach stacked teams.   Gifted Melo knicks. Turned out bad. Linsanity was talked the most about.   Gifted the super stack 2012 lakers. Turned out bad and kobe gets injured trying to carry.   Gifted the rockets. Couldn't even beat the warriors that one year and had harden with super star after superstar."
"I know that this is a controversial opinion thread, but I feel like the Bulls are the least likely of the unexpectedly good teams to be 'frauds'  They have Zach Lavine, DeMar DeRozen, and Nikola Vucevic. Three full blown stars. DeRozen was never a 2nd option before, and he's a 2nd/3rd option on this team. Nik was never not the best best player on his team... until he came to the Bulls. Not only that, but they have some insane hustlers in Lonzo and Caruso. Not to mention, they don't even have Coby White back yet, who would boost their bench  Again, I know that this is a controversial opinion thread, but I just cannot see the Bulls being frauds."
"White is not a ball handler. He is a 6th Man of the Year type guy. Right now the team is staggering Lavine and Derozan. When White comes back it’s going to open up the floor even more. White’s scoring ability is what is going to help this team reach the next level. Right now Lavine is injured but if Coby was healthy, Zach would be able to rest."
I feel like it's been lost in the Ayton stuff that letting guys go into RFA is a perfectly legitimate strategy. Worked out well with Zach Lavine and the Bulls
"So Zach Lavine has been great so I'm not necessarily saying anyone is definitely better than him, but he has a lot of pieces of similar skill around him.  Their Big 4 has all been great."
This will age like the Zach lavine thing. Zach’s great scorer beneficial of a bad team. Gets good team around him still keeps improving his game.
Zach didn't score in the first quarter like 2-3 games and vooch has been pretty cold with some spurts. It shows how good our defense is to keep the game within reach and how well lonzo is able to push the pace and Lavine/Derozan are at scoring
"In order I’d say:        1. Heat: the defense is definitely top 3 at worst and guys like Herro and Bam are looking like they’re in for career years. Lowry hasn’t found his footing yet but he will so that’ll only help more. I’m not entirely sold on their offense quite yet but they’re certainly much improved overall and will put up a fight against anyone.      2. Knicks: I’m biased cause I was high on NY coming into the year but I really like what they’re doing so far. Randle is wildly effective and they might be the deepest team in the East, the bench has made the difference in some games and that’s been without Noel. Also looks like RJ Barrett has taken another step so maybe he’ll finally start getting the credit he deserves.      3. Bulls: I’ll start off by saying I think Zach Lavine is an elite scorer and does not get nearly enough credit for how good he is. After that you have some nice additions in Lonzo and Caruso which can give any guards in the nba a tough time. I’m very biased on Demar as well, I just don’t see it with him. He’s a very mediocre playoff performer and gets tunnel vision sometimes. They’ve played a fairly easy schedule so far so hard to gauge but Utah was a nice win and they were right there with NY. My biggest concern with them is their big man depth. Vucci mane is rock solid but he’s not a difference maker defensively and there’s not a whole lot after him. When it comes down to it how do they stop Giannis, Embiid, KD, etc?       4. Wizards: I’m not particularly high on the Wizards. Not a bad team and I think they’ll make the playoffs but clearly below the other 3 teams listed here imo. I like the bench, seems like the Westbrook trade was a huge win. My issue with Washington is I’m not sure Beal or Dinwiddie are good enough to carry them. Yesterday was a really good example of how their ceiling is capped with those two mostly looking to score first as opposed to spreading the ball around. I will be interested to see how they look whenever Rui comes back and Gafford gets healthy."

"&gt; You take rookie Zach Lavine first in every draft if you know for a fact that he'll become what he is now.  I mean maybe. But that's never a certainty.   And even then, I still might take a 5% chance at KG over a 100% chance of Blake Griffin."
"The biggest misconception from basketball media types who just look at stats is that Vuc is a bad rim protector just because he doesn't get blocks. But the reality is he does a great job of getting in position to put his hands straight up and not foul, and it makes people miss. It doesn't give you a block stat, but it protects the rim.  He is above average at forcing misses at the rim. Combo that with his above average defensive rebounding, and what do you know... you have a good interior defender. The issue is that he is too slow to defend on the perimeter, but now that he has such ravenous defense on the perimeter around him, he is able to drop back and stick to what he does best.  On the flipside, the main things that I deem **legitimate** concern about this year's Bulls defense is the following:  1) Demar DeRozan. He is infamously bad at defense. You can make a legitimate argument that he is the worst defender among All-Star caliber players during the duration of his career. Its perfectly reasonable to expect him to tank the team's defense, especially against playoff-quality offenses.  2) Zach Lavine. He hasn't been very good at defense in years past, but the Olympics have shown is that part of the reason is due to his offensive workload in Chicago being too heavy to have energy to play defense. Now that he has people to share the load with (along with him improving year after year), he is no longer the liability he once was.  3) Losing Thad/Theis. I still think this is and will be a problem, especially with Pat out for season. They were great defenders at the 4/5 last year, and we didn't really do anything to replace them.  I don't think THIS level of defense is sustainable. I think they are still taking teams by surprise at this point, as they haven't had the time to scout them out yet. I suspect they will still be a top 15 defense though."
"Can we just appreciate for a second how much Zach Lavine has stepped up his game on defense? The man can completely hold his own out there this season. He still isn't warm shooting tbh, but his game is still growing in front of our eyes"
Need more Donovan Mitchell vs Zach LaVine
"I'm glad the Bulls have a squad this year, I think alot of people (myself included) are gonna realize how fun Zach LaVine is to watch"
"The first game of a back-to-back against a very improved Chicago squad that is looking to make noise this season in the Eastern Conference. So far, Zach Lavine has had a strong start and is once again one of the hottest shooters in the NBA. Will be an exciting game to watch !"
"He was.... Never comped to Kobe, dude. You take rookie Zach Lavine first in every draft if you know for a fact that he'll become what he is now."

Jalen Green was never gonna turn into Kobe lol  Likely ceiling is like a 2 way Zach Lavine who's easily a superstar but wtf
"When people make draft day comparisons, they aren’t talking about they are now, that’s silly. He got the Giannis/Simmons/Draymond/Magic comparisons not because he’s going to be that good his rookie year obviously, but because for a 20 year old to have the size and strength he does along with literally being a PG in college and a primary playmaker there, you can see how he can fall into that archetype.  It’s like if I went and made a post saying “Jalen green is averaging 14 points and shooting 34% from the field, why does he get Zach LaVine comparisons?”"
"He’s been fine. He’s shooting 41% from the field on high volume, which is terrible. But he’s get fouled a lot and doesn’t turn it over, which is great, especially for this bulls team that desperately needs a steady presence on offense. When he’s guarded by slower defenders he can reach deep in his bag and get off his shots, but he has no burst and hardly ever blows by guys. I’m not saying he’s terrible. It’s just, after a few games, it’s pretty clear the bulls could be better if they just surrounded Zach and Lonzo with shooter/athlete types, or, more importantly,  a PG who can consistently create separation in the pick and roll. He’s just a slow, methodical player who can keep an offense above water, but keeps it from ever being truly dynamic. A bummer when Lonzo is a dynamic shooter and passer, and Lavine is one of the most dynamic guards in the league period."
I think DeMar’s offense will hold up much better as a second option compared to back when he was a first option in Toronto.          DeMar’s scoring is about creating space to get off his midrange shots and attack the paint. As a first option teams can double him and pack the paint to shut him down but that would be much harder to do with Zach LaVine around.

"Zach ""Avril"" LaVine is complicated, frustrated"
Can you post Giannis's playoff stats against the Raptors and then restate your post. Btw where was Zach Lavine at 24? Was he and the rest of the Bulls watching the game in Cancun?
Respect to the bulls. I love Caruso and Lonzo is real impressive on D. Also lowkey wish we had Zach Lavine. Crazy how timber wolves let him go
"Looking at the play. I think it was intended for Vuc to stretch out to the corner, Demar to hand back to Lavine, then cut to the rim. But Zach was doubled and Demar improvised…a bad shot."
LonZo mikael brook for Zach Lavine
FWIW we're all part Bulls fans because of Zach Lavine. Super happy for him
"Zach LaVine 2.0, effortless hops and strides"
Probably Zach LaVine. His steps are so shifty and he pounces suddenly from one spot to the next like a cat.
Zach Lavine and Javonte Green have had an amazing last 2 minutes.
"I mentioned Book and Kobe because they were the highest point totals, but you're right they were the least likely to get to 100. Now that I've had some time, I looked up the 60 point games in the least minutes played (note this is total minutes played in the game, not fastest to 60) and those I think show that it is breakable:    * Klay 60 - 29 min  * Harden 60 - 31 min  * Gervin 63 - 33 min  * Kobe 62 - 33 min  * Steph 62 - 36 min  * Kobe 61 - 36 min  * Harden 61 - 37 min  * Carmelo 62 - 38 min  * Bradley Beal 61 - 38 min  * Add in Lillard x2, Kobe x2, Iverson, LeBron all with 60 in just over 40 min.   From the above, none were trying to break the record. They sat out a lot of time because the game was won and they didn't want an injury. We also have so many 20 point quarters these days, it's ridiculous:   * Klay, Iverson, Zach Lavine each have 10 20 point quarters  * Westbrook and McGrady have have 12  * Booker and Anthony have 14  * Lillard has 19  * LeBron has 20  * Harden has 25  * Steph has 34   * Kobe has 36  Fuck man, Klay got 37 in just one quarter. I'm not saying it's easy or a shoe-in, but it is not unbreakable. You just need someone like these guys to string a few quarters together and WANT it badly enough. Get 60 in the first half and don't sit. Three pointers have helped tremendously in the accessibility of this record.   Imagine Curry goes absolutely bonkers beyond bonkers. He has like 10 games with 11 3s made and again, sits out the 4th in a number of those. What's to really stop him from making 22 one day, then driving for 10 layups as the try to stop the 3, and foul him enough to get 14 FTs."
This is basically exactly what happened in the Zach Lavine incident a few years ago
"If you told me at the beginning of last season that the bulls would have 2 players in the mvp ladder I wouldn't believe you, if you told me one I would believe you because of Lavine but to have another player in the race and be ahead of Zach is crazy to me."
Ye Zach Lavine gonna bust all over his facee
"Lol plenty of teams have benefitted though.   * Indiana got two All-Stars out of the Paul George trade in Oladipo and Sabonis.   * Chicago got an All-Star in Zach LaVine.   * Oklahoma got a future All-Star in SGA from the Paul George trade.  * etc etc.   The difference is, those teams actually made conscious efforts to trade their stars once a request went through and kept a cordial relationship with the star player in question.   &gt; It was either disastrous half the time like Vince Carter  Oh you mean an example of a team that sat on their hands after a trade request until the situation got so toxic they couldn't get any serious return at all?   From 2004:  * After months of biting his lip, Raptors guard Vince Carter says he wants out of Toronto.   According to Thursday's Toronto Star, Carter has discussed his feelings with Raptors general manager Rob Babcock and first-year coach Sam Mitchell, saying ""it's just time for me to look after me.""   Carter, rumoured to be on the move since the end of last season, added he went public because he's frustrated Babcock hasn't moved quickly enough to send him elsewhere.   Babcock on Thursday told the Associated Press that Carter won't be moved.   ""He's under contract with our team,"" he said. ""We expect him to fulfil all obligations of the contract.""   Numerous reports over the summer claimed Carter was unhappy with the direction of the NBA team and with not being consulted in major Raptor decisions such as the hiring of Babcock and Mitchell.   Babcock acknowledged the trade demand is an ""issue"" for the franchise, but he said ""it's not really an issue"" because he's under contract.   ""Is it the ideal way going to camp? No,"" Babcock said. ""But it's really not the nightmare that other people think it is.""   https://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/vince-carter-demands-trade-report-1.490041    Because the trade request was ignored he would go on to fake injuries and actively tank his trade value. Leading to one of the worst trades in Toronto history.  This should sound familiar because this is exactly how the 76ers' situation is playing out right now."

That being said you're also probably not getting a 1 for 1 trade for Simmons with the current situation. So I guess you hold out and hope the situation improves"

"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
"I got the kings just cause they're the kings.   The timber pups are a funny organization. They had Zach lavine Wiggins and Kat.   Let go of Zach to get a Jimmy butler rental.   To then draft anthony edwards to hope he becomes Zach lavine lmao.  Gave up a high draft pick to get d Angelo Russell with their gm not knowing this draft class was loaded. The warriors get a freeby with kuminga, and Wiggins.   Somehow decided to extend the contract of a player smashing scottie pippens wife ."
Steven Curry is a FRAUD riding on the coattails of the GREAT Klay Thompson and Zach LaVine!  !!
"Three way tie with 1 game between Zach Lavine, Steph, and Klay"
Dejounte Murray is the next breakout all star like Zach lavine  Spurs roster is garbage tho
Magic shaq is quick asf. I think he would basically be a giannas or taller zion. The game changes base off generational players.   Shaq is one of the main reasons people started shooting jumpshots and not wanting to play center.   Defense just make him a on the best help defenders. Play a zone defense.   A modern day shaq team would be like.   Lonzo-  zach lavine - Robert covington-  Marcus Morris- Shaq   Ricky rubio- Paul George- Harrison Barnes- Bobby Portis- Shaq   Last Deaaron fox- Duncan Robinson- kawhi- joe ingles- Shaq
Remember when people thought Zach Lavine could eventually leave to go to LA? Especially with the Klutch signing?   Feels so good that we ended up taking Demar and Caruso away
"God I loved watching Lavine develop into the star he is today, I remember how in Game of Zones they violated Zach by saying he can only do cool dunks lol"
26 points while shooting 6/13 being an off night means Zach Lavine is better than curry when healthy huh
"I just said something similar higher up in the thread. Someone was saying “AD is soft and couldn’t even post up Zach Lavine”. That’s because he was getting double teamed, triple teamed and sometimes even quadruple teamed as soon as he touched the ball. It’s amazing he got 20 points with the entire team only focused on him, and he got ejected in the 3rd quarter."
He went from having Dejounte Murray &amp; Derrick White being the best players on the roster besides him to Zach Lavine &amp; Lonzo Ball. Defenses were ecstatic when pretty much anybody besides DeMar tried to score in the half court especially in crunch time last year but you can't do that with the Bulls cause they're just far more talented.
"An argument can be made that Tatum has not been better than a LaVine for a second of their careers. Since Tatum has joined the league, Zach has averaged 25/5/4 on 58% TS to Tatum's 19/6/3 on 56% TS.  Zach has had the misfortune of playing for terrible teams for literally his entire career while Tatum was drafted by a 53-win team that also acquired Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward before he ever played an NBA game."
"They did, but both times that they did they were either just pieces on a well rounded team (2018) or had way more help than Zach or DeRozan ever had (2020).  On the hierarchy of wing duos i would say that Tatum and Brown as a pair are behind LaVine/DeRozan and PG/Kawhi. They don't have the playmaking ability that both of the other duos have and while they might be better defenders than LaVine and DeRozan, they are less efficient.  I mean, they are averaging 5.9 assists as a duo and they aren't elite perimeter defenders (like PG and Kawhi) or incredibly efficient (like Zach and DeMar) to make up for it."
"Hey fam, just stopping by, wanted to let you know word on the street is that you think Ray Allen was better than Zach LaVine. Idk if it's true that's just what people are saying. Do you care to comment"
ESPN: BREAKING NEWS: Zach Lavine revealed to be Jim Boylen in disguise
"DeBallZachRuso  Caruso is just as important as those 3 guys, weird as it is to say. He is the oil that keeps that engine running. His absurdly good defense combined with Ball's allows Lavine and Demar to take a load off and really is what making this whole thing work. Those two guys are both so good defensively that it allows Donovan to kinda do whatever he wants with the rotations and stuff. Demar and Zach aren't exactly defensive liabilities but they arent amazing defenders."
"Zach has been averaging 25-5-5 for years now, all that while shooting 40+% from 3 and having insane athleticism, people just glossed over him because he played on some of the worst teams in the league.  For example, there's no statistical argument that supports Jayson Tatum or Donovan Mitchell being substantially better than LaVine in the last three seasons, yet 99% of this sub would've said so before this year just because they played in better teams."
"DeRozan and LaVine as a duo are what Boston fans and media hoped that Tatum and Brown eventually became.  Funny thing is that if you told someone before this year that Zach LaVine is better than guys like Tatum and Mitchell, most people would've laughed in your face. Funny how finally having decent teammates changes things.  If Vucevic can learn how to shoot again, the Bulls will be a legit threat to the Bucks and the Nets and i don't care what anybody says."
Steph as always but tyler herro or zach lavine
"DeMar is a fucking professional and can  honestly compliment most players. Now, Zach LaVine… is something special. Dude is certified baller."
Zach Lavine has never been over .500 for a stretch longer than 2 games before this season.
Is Zach Lavine sexier in person 🥵 (in a basketball way)
zach lavine is so good man
Zach L. and Zachary Lavine.
How come we never talk about how Zach Lavine is the top 3 most handsome man in the league?
Wym? Zach Lavine is in the show
"Great game. Clippers / pg got hacked a bit at the end, but the bulls also kept responding. Zach Lavine is a killer"
I mean they have a much better team built around them. I know we make fun DeRozan for his playoff performances but playing alongside with Zach LaVine is going to help him tremendously. And have you seen their defense and how Jimmy Butler is playing like an MVP candidate.
MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD! Do not reveal the spoilers if you haven't finished watching Squid Game.  &gt;! Zach Lavine would win the Squid Games but it would be close between him and DeRozan !&lt;
"It does matter, but sustained production in the regular season has minimal impact on these top top players winning a championship. In fact resting and coasting in the regular season could be argued as increasing the chances of winning a championship. The bubble helped Lebron so much since he was able to come in fresh for the playoffs.  Like this year it is likely that someone like Zach Lavine has better regular season production then Lebron, but most people would not say he is a better player since when it comes down to a game that actually matters Lebron is going to be better. Sustained production is more important for lesser players in my opinion."
"“Sup y’all. It’s Zach LaVine, aka light-skinned but still black chocolate!”"
&gt; Zach Lavine: White chocolate  Uh... pretty sure a caveat to this nickname starts at actually being white...
I’m renaming three.    Giannis: will now be known as “Spell Check” (Afflalo)   Zach Lavine: White chocolate   Westbrook: Bean Burrito
"It’s Zach LaVine.   I love Demar’s game. His midrange ability is impeccable, can’t be pecc’d. His isolation game is great. His off-ball offensive ability leaves a lot to be desired tho.   Zach has a flawless offensive game, in terms of his skill set. He can hit any shot, from any angle, from anywhere on the floor. He is one of the best finishers in the game. His one weakness is that he avoids contact purposely because he’s focused on finishing the play rather than selling to get a foul call. I actually love that about him, but Demar really takes on contact and makes it obvious that he was fouled, which leads to more opportunities at the line. It also leads to turnovers for Zach because the contact makes him lose the ball, but he doesn’t sell it enough to get the call.   Demar is dope, but Zach is nonsensically talented and is without a doubt the best basketball player on the team."
"The Bulls wanted to do Butler for Wiggins straight up but the T-Wolves said no so the Bulls eventually settled for Zach Lavine, Kris Dunn, and a pick swap (7 for 16)"
"I don't think the Lakers necessarily look at themselves like they're in a short championship window. LeBron and Westbrook only have this year and next year under contract, and after that the only guys the Lakers have on the books beyond next season are AD and THT. Beyond that they are looking at $70 million in cap space, and for the Lakers that could mean an incredible free agent signing or two. The other option is LeBron keeps being LeBron and the Lakers keep this going.   I think if the Lakers could trade THT for a legit win now star, they'd absolutely do it, but the only player like that that the Lakers could salary match on this season is Zach LaVine, and I'm guessing the Bulls won't trade him unless LaVine specifically demands it. Other than that, maybe someone becomes available next summer, but I don't see the Lakers flipping THT for some older role player. If they wanted to go that route they'd have just kept Caruso."
"This Bulls team is full of players who have something to prove and it shows on the court  Zach ""empty stats"" Lavine  Lonzo ""overrated"" Ball  DeMar ""got traded then the Raptors won a title"" DeRozan  Nikola ""who?"" Vucevic  Alex ""not worth 7M a year"" Caruso"
#Zach Lavine is Spanish for Zach the Vine
Zach Lavine makes basketball just so much more enjoyable to watch. So effortlessly making super difficult shots
Damn Zach Lavine is good.
Paul George misses a wide open 3 on a 3-2 fast break.    Zach Lavine takes a two dribble pull up 3 and swish.
Zach Lavine has 1 freethrow off of a technical. Is it more likely that he just isn't getting fouled at all or did the refs miss a few calls? The answer is the latter
Good job Zach lavine
Zach Lavine and his fiancee have been together since high school
"for the millionth time  The vast majority of players would have been better off if they'd accepted cap smoothing.  The CBA still requires that 51% of basketball-related revenue, minimum, goes to the players. If the NBPA had accepted smoothing, the excess would have been distributed evenly across the players.  #Almost every player in the NBA would have received more money if they'd voted for cap smoothing.  Instead, the spike allowed KD to go to the Warriors, and the rest of the extra money got loaded into a few contracts that became albatrosses for various teams and multiple other players to get lower contracts because various teams were capped.  If you're an NBA player who wasn't a free agent in 2016, specifically, that decision absolutely fucked your income. Zach Lavine is underpaid for how good he is but nobody could have afforded to pay him what he's worth when his contract came up.  So blame Chris Paul and the rest of the NBPA leadership for ""ruining the league"". Shortsighted greed made it so they made sure Timofey Mozgov got paid, and anyone else who wasn't already a franchise-player-grade superstar got screwed."

Zach Lavine is still pretty underrated.
zach lavine is goin off tonight yessir
Zach Lavine for sure an all star this season right?
Zach LaVine is HIM
Yo Andrew I hear Zach Lavine said he thinks your daughter is only middling cute
"I wish Dray would just be like, Zach Lavine is good at basketball and should be more confident in his abilities. His quotes are like reading James Joyce translated to Esperanto."
I think the Bulls might be a good choice for you. Team that's on the rise and Zach Lavine is on his way to superstardom. You can get on at the bottom floor and enjoy the rise to the top
Cory Joseph is one of the worst possible players the Kings have ever had. During his tenure on the Kings luke was playing him like 23-28 minutes a night against the other team and he'd just get hunted like a motherfucker. Luke played him 36 minutes against Zach lavine and Lavine put up his career highs on Joseph.
"sometimes i dream, that he is me, like zach lavine 🥺"
"This is a great read for Bulls and Warriors fans (or just Zach or Draymond fans), and Devin Booker even makes a cameo as another wine afficionado.  Some stuff I thought was great:  We drank a lot of burgundy,” Green said. “He (LaVine) had no clue. He had no idea about anything when it came to wine. And it was good just to see him start trying wine. Before you knew it, Zach was coming up to the lounge, like ‘Hey, man, we drinking some wine tonight?’ ”  LaVine returned to the States a bonafide wine drinker.  “Big time now after messing with him,” LaVine said. “I’ve been donating to the vineyards already.”  ***** “He was the best teammate you could have for a guy in our situation,” LaVine said. “He was the leader of the team. Obviously, we know KD (Kevin Durant) was the best player. But without Dray, we wouldn’t have won. He’s the one who had everything (together) in every practice, watching film with the guys, making adjustments, giving guys confidence to come and play their game and just keeping everybody engaged.  “You can really see why the Warriors are so good. He’s the glue guy. He’s the one who makes everything run. At least that’s my opinion. He looks out for everybody else before himself.”  ***** Green has been watching LaVine closely this season, equal parts proud and excited. He watches every game. He listens to his interviews. He follows how LaVine is growing his brand, even how he dresses. He can see the difference, the superstar blossoming. His demeanor. How he carries himself. Green said he even notices that LaVine walks on the court differently.  “You are becoming exactly the Zach LaVine you’re supposed to be,” Green said, “and that’s a beautiful thing.” *****  “Greatness doesn’t just happen on the floor,” Green said. “ Greatness is in how you carry yourself. Greatness is how you interview. Greatness is how people deal with you. It’s not just you can score 30 points on the basketball court. Greatness is how everybody else responds to your greatness, and if you don’t require people to respond to your greatness, they won’t.”"
*Kevin Love leaves minny*  Kevin Love wins a championship  *Wiggins leaves Minny*  Wiggins averages career highs in offensive efficiency and becomes an elite defender  *Zach Lavine leaves Minny*  Lavine turns into a legit star on a playoff team  Thank god Minny didn't draft Steph or pushed for the Klay trade. We could've seen those two's careers end up in the dumpster.
Zach LaVine was never the ugly chick -- he was the secretly hot chick who had glasses. And a ponytail. And paint on her overalls!  Z's all that.
I always hated that we traded him :( Zach LaVine rules
"Wiggins vs. Lavine was a legit debate for a number of years, but it’s not even close now.   As a Wolves fan/hostage, I’m glad to see Zach out here thriving. Both he and Wigs could be making deep playoff runs this year."
He's saying Zach Lavine was the ugly chick in high school. After a summer she came back looking hot with a fat ass and some C cups but she hasn't realized she's a 10 now.
"Go watch a Jimmy high roller video on YouTube where he breaks down the stats and numbers for you in a funny entertaining way.   Play 2k on allstar( that's the base difficulty online ) and just shoot around to practice the sticks.   Play around with the sport and go to my league and just see who's the best at what. Like for dunking you will know giannas, zion, ja morant and Zach lavine are the best at their postions. Shooting will be curry lol, then durant etc..."
"I was just about to mention this, it's kinda like a Devin Booker scenario where you add a few vets to the team, you guys get better and a lot more people really start to see who a Zach Lavine is like they did with Booker. Obviously different players, but both are Kobe disciples so both just want to hoop and get better."
Zach LaVine or Kelly Oubre being faces of the NBA would do wonders for the league. Shame their talent is not quite there.  Imagine the rivalry..
comparing Zach Lavine and Collin Sexton.  especially in an inflated era
dude got MVP with Zach lavine and Collin Sexton type numbers. they just didn't wanna give it to Lebron cause he joined Miami
Kevin Martin - Zach Lavine?   Take athleticism out of the equation and you’ve got two talented scorers (who can light it up on all three levels) and subpar defense
"Lol...  Wall - a guy that is already 30, coming off a Torn ACL and Torn Achilles, who has started off hot, but has lingering long term health issues meanwhile the team is stuck paying him max money for the next 3 years.  Boogie - Really? The guy who has played a grand total of 17, 48, 30, and 3 games across the last four seasons? The same dude who busted his ACL and Achilles as well? There is a reason was no one was lining up to pay him. Meanwhile he is shooting 40% from the field and 33% from 3. Ouch...  Wood has looked nice, but he can’t play defense to save his life, and can’t shoot the 3 (27%)   You don’t have 4 all stars, the only one who will actually make the all star team on that roster is Harden and that is if he stays on the team...  You’re team is also 12th in the West standings with a negative record...so no, you probably won’t be going to the playoffs at this rate.   And Harden isn’t gonna “stay” the Rockets aren’t gonna let him walk for nothing, he will be moved at one point.   And no one knows Zach Lavine?...lol, no one knows a 25 PPG scorer, but they know Christian Wood? Mmmmm that’s funny.  And we actually have a lot of solid young guys still developing. Most of our team is 23 years or younger so there is growing pains. Markkanen, Carter, White, and Williams are all making strides.   Also...you go ahead and tell the Thunder that picks mean nothing lol...they licking their chops ready to use the ones you gave up all for one year of Westbrook.  And you see your whole “you just gotta hope to draft a super star” isn’t that easy...and doesn’t work if you DON’T HAVE PICKS. Which y’all don’t have because y’all traded them. There is only so much a GM can do with no picks.  And my team of “nobodies” is 4-4 and higher in the standings than your team full of “4 all stars”  I know you’re probably like 15 or 16, but educate yourself on the sport before you start running your mouth. The NBA isn’t as black and white as your young mind believes and it severely shows with the way you speak."
"Yea at least our guys are into the game. The ones who just treat big plays like they're watching a game of scrabble are the worst. Like whoever was commentating that Zach Lavine dagger, from his voice you wouldn't know anything interesting had happened at all smh"
"i can tell you why they hate lavine. impact metrics are so broad they basically describe nothing that you can't get from just watching the player play. zach was primary ballhandler, a role that as of last year he wasn't meant for, to an abysmal offense."
"I think the biggest thing for the bulls is the backcourt dynamic between white and lavine. Both are more of scorers so it’s absolutely integral to our offense that one of them operates as more of a playmaker at any given time when both are on court. Tonight was an excellent example of how that can lead to success. Zach didn’t have it going and he was really looking to create for others. Coby started slow but once he heated up, you could tell that Zach was trying to get him shots. Now the goal for the coming games is that when Zach is inevitably hitting his shots, Coby takes that playmaking role so Zach can get more easy looks instead of having to create for himself. I think if we can consistently have that dynamic working, where those two are always playing to complement each other, then we can be a playoff team this year. Down the line I think a Coby/Lavine backcourt is going to look a lot like the backcourt we just beat in Portland. Two guys who can get a bucket at will, but who know how to work with each other to stagger their scoring/playmaking duties."
"???? tf we have wall, boogie, and wood. it doesnt look like harden is going to leave. we're gonna make the playoffs cause we have like four all stars on our team.  your team. nobody knows how tf zach lavine is and after that, no one knows who else is on your team. you can have all the picks you want but your team still trash and have no all stars to build a good team with. you just gotta hope to draft a super star. hoping that we dont do good in the future with less good picks is stupid, thats why a gm exists. your team is a bunch of nobodies and isnt getting nowhere in the standings."
"I know im just gonna get attacked cause of my flair but the bulls look bad. I watched the second half of those games vs Dallas and Portland and the only thing I thought was ""God dallas/Portland look uninspired and shitty""    Zach Lavine is the talent. Lauri has either been injured or not used right but idk if he will be in Chicago long. Colby white is a good shooter, and getting better as a 1, but like, Immanuel Quickly is better already. Wendell is alright, whats his ceiling even? Pat is cool.    I've been high on Chicago for a long time but im getting off the train. They have like 5 talented young guys and it really feels like 2 of them don't even want to be on the team. And they the two best ones"

"Man I've watched every single game he's played in a Bulls shirts. All I've learned is that if it ain't on the box score then 99% of NBA ""fans"" dont have a clue what they're on about.  Bulls fans are by far the worst for it. LaVine has been great since the start of his second season at that was in spite of the players next to him and the coaching lunacy. If Zach was used properly these past 3 years I think he probably would have went off for 60 by now, Zach has almost never been played to his strengths and usually is left to go cold for quarters at a time, under Boylen it wouldnt be an odd experience to watch LaVine put up less than 3 shots in the 2nd and 3rd quarter combined. Boylen would only let LaVine start shooting in the 4th when we're already down by 20, LaVine would go off and we'd lose by 10, still the opinion was LaVine is shit and arrogant.   The funny part? LaVine is one of the humblest players I've witnessed at his level, he plays for a shit team and never thinks about anything but the team, nothing but the young guys, he even offered to pay a fine for Boylen because he got ejected defending the team, LaVine is a top fucking guy. People get too lost in the patchy IQ and dunk contest and assumed he was arrogant and being absolutely wrong.  And btw Zach isnt and wasnt a horrendous defender, not for the Bulls at least apart from his ACL returning season. After that his defence was grossly exagerrated, he wasnt even an average defender but he just wasn't piss poor or worst in the league that people were making out, thats just the stats you get when having to defend with players like Blakeney, TLC and Felicio on the court. He's got better and better but even in his second year you could see the effort, he just slipped up at times. I'm glad I've seen his whole career at the Bulls."
Made $500 off of $50. I was literally ready to give Zach Lavine my life when he drained the 3.
"Oh alright so did Boylen bench Lavine just for low effort or something like that? Also, in general, how much appreciation do Bulls fans have for Zach? Is he generally loved or is there a faction of those who really want his traded?"
Kanter is actually pretty good in spot minutes bench vs bench. You just can't leave him on the floor when guys like Curry or apparently Zach Lavine check back in.
Zach LaVine!
"""We just want our respect. Arturas wants his respect, coach Donovan wants his respect, Jerry Reinsdorf deserves no respect, Bulls fans want their respect and I want my damn respect too.""  - Zach Lavine"
locked up by zach lavine of all people lol
Point god Zach Lavine with the clutch stepback 3 to bring the bulls back .500 territory.   Feels good man.
I would put Zach LaVine in that category.
who is Zach LaVine?🙄🤭🤔🥱   in math: my solution ➗☺️   in history: my king👑😣   in art: my canvas 🎨🥳   in science: my oxygen 💨😝   in geography: my world 🌎🤯
I will fucking fist fight anyone who disrespects Zach lavine
"Legend has it, Zach Lavine wears the number 8 to bring awareness about the 8 symptoms of Scoreiasis that people should talk to their doctor about if they notice themselves or a loved one exhibiting.  1. Liking hot sauce.  2. Pressing all the buttons on the elevator because you want to go higher.  3. Doing it to 'em, even though you have been advised not to.  4. Driving home safely and beeping twice in rapid succession.  5. Turning on the poster machine.  6. Pausing it right there on the Telestrator, then rolling it, then freezing it, then rolling it again.  7. Ostensibly offering the massage, but giving a facial instead.  8. Jeff Vukovich."
I would trade everyone just to get Zach LaVine on my team lol
Fucking zach Lavine holy shit make a shot
Zach Lavine my boy 60 pts 10 assist 7 rebound

Okay you play without Zach Lavine and tell me how well your team does.
"Sure, let's say our guys were soft, and they didn't play defense. But is it also their fault that he basically filled up the whole roster with old Bulls who he signed for too much, was involved in negotiating Wiggins' contract hamstringing the rest of the team, traded Ricky Rubio for Jeff fucking Teague, and traded away Zach Lavine and Lauri Markkanen for one half-healthy volatile season with Jimmy? Nah. Fuck Tom Thibodeau"
Also Zach Lavine popping the fuck off. And Coby White scoring 21 in the second half
"That’s stupid imo. Lowry is 35, while Dennis fits ADs timeline being 27.  The lakers may be able to trade for Zach Lavine at the deadline with a package like that (highly unlikely)"
"More like should've traded Wiggins instead of LaVine for Butler. But I guess I understood the thinking, with Zach tearing his ACL and all"
Zach LaVine. Dude is just building off of the last two seasons. He deserves an All-Star nod.
"Richaun Holmes, Dario saric, Jerami grant, Zach Lavine, Markelle Fultz, tj McConnell, kristaps porzingis, devonte graham, Roco, Ja, nerlens noel"
"Watching this game was like watching old people fuck, except halfway through the video Zach lavine said ""no this is how you do it "", and then Colby built off that energy and started stroking it. Hot take: the mavs are dog shit without Luka and KP"

"It's about time. Was wondering where Zach ""Borderline All-Star"" Lavine has been this season."
"I don't understand this complaint of r/NBA.  Advanced stats are very well accepted here.  People still go crazy over box score numbers (as they should) but there really isn't any pushback to things like RPM, RAPTOR, PIPM or even WS, where Draymond's value generally shows up.  People only attack Draymond because they don't like him personally.  But people here are definitely willing to accept a low box score stats player on a great team, probably even moreso than a great box score stats player on a bad team.  The hate Draymond receives is purely because of his personality.  He gets more respect (deservedly so) than say Zach Lavine."
Zach Lavine All Star 2021.
Zach LaVine is a top 5 shooting guard in the NBA and I'm tried of pretending he's not
Zach lavine
zach lavine is insane
WOOO! Someone get some Cosentyx™ for my man Zach Lavine! He has a bad case of Scoreiasis!
"Zach ""Not an All Star"" Lavine"
"Wow, those are Zach Lavine numbers."
What the fuck is Zach Lavine
"Zach Lavine is developing pretty well, on his way to be an all-star soon.  You guys are technically better than Wizards so there is that as well."
Lauri markken and Zach Lavine
"In no particular order: Brogdan, Oladipo, Sexton, Trae Young, Kyrie, Kemba, Jrue Holiday, Goran Dragic, Zach Lavine, Lowry, Beal, and Russ are all better   And that’s not even including guys with higher ceilings like Garland or Fultz.   He’s not a top 5 guard in the east. Sorry"
Zach Lavine will become a respectful defender.
Zach Lavine
Yeah but the question wasn't is Zach Lavine an elite shooter this season.
"There’s a lot of people deliberating acting like the term doesn’t exist so they can justify stupid takes like “Curry is just Dame with a good supporting cast”. The reality is that some players like Klay and Draymond have great value to championship contenders, but would be garbage if they had to be no 1 options on mediocre teams (hence ceiling vs floor). Zach LaVine is clearly better at “carrying” a team than someone like Klay, but many contenders would prefer Klay if they could choose between them."
But Zach LaVine wasn’t that good because he wasn’t winning right? Why would it ever be the coaches fault???? If it’s not their fault and they’re great players they’ll win! /s
"No he isn't, he is a 34% 3-PT shooter, he ain't even in the same universe as the best shooters in the NBA.  Trae is alot of great things: great passer/playmaker, great FT shooter and scorer, but he ain't even a Top 30 shooter and a couple of half court 3-PT attempts every game doesn't change that. Zach LaVine shot considerably better than Trae last season in comparable attempts and there isn't a soul on earth that thinks LaVine is a Top 15 shooter, just stop it."

You’re right! That pick could be anything too.. maybe even a future Zach Lavine
"Best I have ever played was in 2015. I was making every three imaginable, even banked a corner three lol. Guys on the sidelines were trying to make me leave my friends team for theirs.   In 2017 or 16 Zach Lavine came to the gym with 2-3 friends and we hopped a bit. This was the summer before his torn acl.  Rodney Stuckey also lives around my area and I have played with him at 24 hour.  There was a guy who I think played D2 or 1 on the East Coast. He was super in shape. Every dribble was super tight, like Messi when he has the ball. He even had the Curry sequence against the clippers one time, munis the three though lol."
Zach Lavine is invisible I guess
Zach Lavine
u put him above  Zach Lavine Jaylen Brown Bradley Beal Oladipo Levert etc  you are the reason that people shit on heat fans lmao
"They got Bradley Beal on 30ppg, Russ in 20ppg (however inefficient he is) as well as Bryant &amp; Hachimura each on 17ppg. Their offense isn't great (Russ has over 5 turnovers a game) but its not bad  Their defense however is a fucking joke, how tf do you give up 133 points to my Bulls? Zach Lavine even had an awful game going 1/7 from 3."
"I disagree.  Take some time to look through who the wolves have drafted with their first rd picks , and let me know which ones went on to improve significantly after being let go.  Zach Lavine is the best example, although he was great for the Wolves during 2016 before he tore his ACL (better than Wiggins imo) and was then traded for Jimmy butler.  Kris Dunn developed as a defender, but we traded him after his rookie season, some improvement would be expected obviously.  Rubio improved his 3pt shooting, but ultimately had a similar impact on the court in Utah and Phx compared with his time in Minnesota   I see this argument youre making very often, but I dont see the evidence in favor of it.  Our draft history is littered with guys who we selected, then traded after 2 or 3 years, and they didn't do anything on any other team.  To me, that is a sign youre choosing the wrong guys"
"I’ll always laugh at the fans that sold themselves the idea that Zach lavine is a quality #1 player, the dude couldn’t stop a nosebleed on defense."
"They really are better blowing it up, starting with Zach LaVine. The player culture seems to be toxic as a result of Boylen, and I dont know if that can ever get fixed."
I don't think this applies to Zach Lavine though...he's doin work man...maybe get him some help.
Zach “despite the loss” LaVine needs to be free!
Unpopular opinion: Swap Jordan for LaVine on those 3 peat bulls teams and nothing changes.  Zach would average 9 threes a game playing with a shortened 3 point line
"Probably get Zach Lavine in there, atleast over VanFleet.  And for my money McCollum is #1 on this list with how hes playing."
Zach LaVine
Zach Lavine at least top 3
I would literally trade anyone on the bulls not named Zach Lavine for Simmons. But the 6ers don’t want anyone not named Lavine huh?
76ers need to make a move for zach lavine
Zach Lavine is obviously the best choice for outside hitter
"No, Zach Lavine is"
The fucking zach lavine dissresepct is so real i feel so bad for him. I dont want him to leave but id love for him to have some siccess elsewhere. Especially with him pickong up his defense this year
Zach Lavine
"Ehhh superstar is a massive reach. Lebron is a superstar, Kawhi, KD, etc... Zach Lavine is not close to that tier. He's a borderline all star lol"
"Zach Lavine, superstar player on a supershit team"
"Zach ""despite the loss"" Lavine for you, peasant!!"
"Zach Lavine, Coby White, Otto Porter Jr, Wendell Carter Junior, Denzel Valentine, Tomas Satoransky, Patrick William, Gafford (idk his first name)"
I dont think you should be guaranteed all star or All Nba player but you should atleast get a Zach Lavine level player
Zach lavine
"In that trade they got 8 picks, and the expiring they now have is Victor Oladipo (which they got for trading away Levert, who is not an expiring and is considered great value on his contract). Not really the same as Otto Porter  I'd prefer the rights to 2 Nets picks than 2 sixers picks, so the only real asset you end up with is 2 frp from one of those teams. Especially because it appears that a large motivation for the Rockets was to get under the tax, which it's not clear that your deal would do  Why are you assuming that Lavine can be swapped for 2 picks?  So your logic is that through multiple assumptions, Simmons must have been offered for expirings and a couple first round picks, which you're assuming that those teams turned down. And since you're assuming that Lavine could be acquired for 2 picks, that therefore means that Simmons is a fair trade for Lavine?  That's a lot to build an argument on. My argument is that multiple of your assumptions are likely not true (and only one needs to be for your argument to not make sense), and that Ben Simmons is better than Zach Lavine at basketball while being on a better contract  You heard of Occam's razor?"
I’d trade Ben Simmons for Zach LaVine straight up
Zach Lavine looks like a volleyball player
"Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Vucevic All NBA “Despite the loss” club"
A lot of people mention Kyrie and KD but I'll throw another one in there: Zach Lavine. His dunks in the [2016 contest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0ExyH-FjPQ) were jello but just his overall play looks very smooth. I think it's because he's lanky and he has a nice [shooting form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9l4K8RHzJU).
zach lavine?
hey everyone’s just now coming around to zach lavine. vuc up next.
I had some fucking clown on this sub last year legitimately tell me Zach LaVine is not a better player than Richaun Holmes. Saying zach aint a top 50 player in the league. Too lazy to find that convo and that guy but fuck that guy.
"I really want the bulls to pull off a trade for Ben Simmons and somehow keep Zach. I’m think Coby, Lauri, and hella picks. I’d through in WCJ too, if that’s what the sixers wanted.   Simmons-Lavine-OPJ-Thad-Gafford"
Zach lavine
If you swapped Turner with Gobert the Jazz would probably be an 7-8th seed. They are not close in defensive impact and ability.   That’s like saying Zach LaVine is as good a scorer as Kevin Durant
"&gt; they would rather go play with zach lavine and the chicago bulls!  Yeah, at least that way they will get some shots. See: Jeremy Grant, who wanted to play with Blake Griffin."
yeah man these nba players definitely don’t want to play on a team with two guys who have won mvp and are some of the best scorers in nba history for the chance to win a title in new york. they would rather go play with zach lavine and the chicago bulls!
"Nobody knows if they would win with him instead of LaVine but not only are you replacing a PF/C with a SG you’re also acting like AD is just any regular 2nd option rather than arguably the 2nd best player in the world, so I wouldn’t exactly call that a fair comparison. Also Zach has improved defensively so I don’t think you’re giving him enough credit"

"I don’t know about that. A Luka run offense is one of the best in history, why take the ball out of his hands? He is a better playmaker than scorer.          I think Bradley Beal/Zach LaVine would be a great complimentary piece. Luka would feed them so many open looks."
MPJ has the potential to be anything! Even Zach Lavine!

These the same 6ers that are gonna get Zach Lavine for roles players and a late 1st?
Zach Lavine
"not to mention these are just tons of assets HOU can flip if they feel they are fringe competitors in 2-3 years. Sort of like how every single trade/offseason people mentioned Celtics/Danny Ainge as a possibility.  They could theoretically move Wall/Boogie/Tucker for more assets and then play with tons of assets/cap space and build a good team around Wood who is only 25 (if he maintains his current success).       2021 is a bad FA class, but in 2022 it opens back up with Kawhii (UFA), Beal (PO), Curry (UFA), Zach Lavine (UFA), Julius Randle (UFA), Marcus Smart, JV  Technically Trae/Luka/Sexton/SGA/Jaren Jackson, etc all become RFA       Could build a respectable team in 2 years and then have 45 first round picks to trade for a superstar"
"Well Heat and 76ers could probably use one of Oladipo, Lowry or Beal. Maybe Zach Lavine is also on that list.  Oladipo has openly said he wants to play for the Heat so maybe he'll buy into their culture and play hard.   I'm not sure if Toronto wants Lowry to retire there and Beal is uncertain because he says he loves Washington so unless he demands a trade I doubt he gets moved."
"They'll always have the best player on the floor in Zach Lavine, which gives them a fighting chance in every game."
"In the season opener they actually put PJ on Dame Lillard for a couple of key poss at the end of the 4th and OT. Last poss [of that game he looks pretty good on here doing it](https://go.nba.com/hl3q).   Hou has asked him to play as a big the last 2 years but in 2019 googling his matchup tab here are the guys he spent the most time guarding: Paul George, LeBron, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard. If you go down youll see him having games of guarding 2's like Victor Oladipo, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine etc for 8-10 poss a game they really had him do it 2-5.  His best matchups are probably 3s and 4s. Every one of those wings I mentioned above I would trust to put on him unless he were to suddenly start showing his age over night."
Zach Lavine is who Donovan Mitchell thinks he is
Zach Lavine shouldn’t be mentioned with these group of guys
"he's another example to me of a guys ceiling is what you make it. he's clearly good at basketball but this dudes out here knocking down threes off the dribble and doing super impressive shit. I'm not saying just anyone can do that shit, but I do think being treated like a high pick and being treated like you're expected to be the fuckin man helps push dudes to actually TRY to get there.   i think if Lonnie Walker played on some trash team, he'd look like something in the middle of Zach Lavine and Collin Sexton but he's always been  given a short leash having his minutes fucked with and all this shit. let dudes play, let em grow and get better, and you might be surprised who makes shit happen."
Zach Lavine is also 25.  25 is still very young. Lots of room to improve  Beal is 27 and still improving  Y’all love to act like 20-23 year old players are the only ones who can improve their games.
"zach lavine to golden state for oubre, looney, 2022 warriors lottery protected first"
Zach lavine for James Harden
Bro give us Zach Lavine for Harden please
"I don't see why we would trade Zach Lavine unless he wants out. If we're bad enough that Lavine doesn't stay, then trading him for James Harden or Bradley Beal probably just leads to them asking out now.  If we were going for a trade, I'd trade him for future draft assets. On that note, the Pelicans, Warriors, and Thunder become the instant trade partners to look at. I think the Warriors have the most prime draft asset with the Minnesota pick, so I'd go after that.  The most reasonable trade is probably something like Kelly Oubre, Kevon Looney, Damion Lee, the 2021 Minnesota pick, 2026 Golden State pick (converts to 2nd if it conveys to Memphis), and 2028 Golden State pick, and maybe a pick swap or two for good measure."
Zach Lavine for Kyrie Irving?
"Thats the difference a playmaker and a scorer has on the team. There are plenty of roles in basketball and can you honestly name a scenario where an out and out scorer has ever improved his team more than a team who has a playmaker who's on exactly the same level. For every LaVine you get a Kemba Walker, Kemba walker is more important to winning and can affect the whole team more through his plays, but LaVine's role isn't an uneeded one, I've never seen a team thats come close to contending that hasn't had a 25+ PPG scorer a night on their team. Undoutbedly the Bulls will need someone better than LaVine to be in automatic contention for a ring but LaVine fills a gap we need and we'd be stupid if we think there's anyone in the league we could realistically replace him with.  Coby White has the potential to be a scorer as good as LaVine IMHO but you'd be literally throwing away Zach on the hopes that White is just as good, that doesn't make sense to me. Zach needs to improve his playmaking and defence a slight more and he could definitely be on a contending team, however it would take a stupid offer to even get talks going, we won't be able to replicate what LaVine brings to the table so easily."
"He should have been an all star now for me twice already, the second season I can understand but even then he was on a much lower usage coming up to the all star break simply because Markkanen had came back from injury. At the same time for the past 2 seasons he was used incorrectly.  I think thats why we're currently forcing the issue with Coby at PG simply because Zach is better when playing the majority of his offensive game off ball. Zach's highest efficency was always shooting in under 2 dribbles or less. He can definitely play with the ball in his hands too but this should be a smaller proportion of his game than off ball, if you put a top playmaker next to LaVine he's going off for 40 most nights IMO. LaVine on the open 3 is pretty automatic now and even in contested and difficult scenarios it pretty automatic too. If teams start to double team Zach then cool, we just gotta hope the rest of the team can cover the offensive load, I've seen it happen before to him, he's used to most scenarios that come his way, just needs to improve on certain reads on the game but apart from that his scoring game is pretty stellar."
"Dude I can show you high school players doing the exact same move as James Harden, making the same pass as Lebron, or that jump higher than Zach Lavine. That doesnt mean that when someone posts a highlight of Player X making a nice play that its less impressive. Get yall snotty heads outta ya non-hoopin asses lol and just appreciate a nice basketball play"
Zach LaVine
**2020:** Anthony Edwards with the 1st pick.   **2019:** Jarrett Culver with the 6th pick.   **2017:** Lauri Markkanen with the 7th pick (traded to the Bulls).   **2016:** Kris Dunn with the 5th pick.   **2015:** Karl-Anthony Towns with the 1st pick.   **2014:** Zach LaVine with the 13th pick.   **2013:** Trey Burke with the 9th pick (traded to the Jazz).   **2011:** Derrick Williams with the 2nd pick.   **2010:** Wesley Johnson with the 4th pick.  **2009:** Ricky Rubio with the 5th pick *and* Jonny Flynn with the 6th pick.   **2008:** OJ Mayo with the 3rd pick (traded to the Grizzlies).  **2007:** Corey Brewer with the 7th pick.   **2006:** Brandon Roy with the 6th pick (traded to the Blazers).
There's a difference between playing the Bulls and the Raptors - notably the Bulls help defenders on a lot of those Embiid post ups were Zach Lavine and Coby White lol. what are they gonna do? The Raptors have excellent defenders all over the floor that they send at guys.
Pretty good. We lose too many close games but still we showed we are playing for the playoffs. Zach Lavine is unreal. I hope we won't see more Lauri and Wendell injuries this season.
I’m gonna be completely honest here. I forgot Zach Lavine was on the team.
This is true. Sometimes good players on bad teams get criticized for not leading their teams to good records by themselves. When in reality there are 2-3 (maybe) players in the league at one time who could do that and are usually all time greats. It’s not a great criticism so say someone like Zach Lavine or brad Beal is no Lebron James. Lol no way....
"As a Bulls fan that has watched Zach Lavine these last couple years, this is true."

This thread is sleeping on Zach Lavine
"i've always like the two-motion shooters with high releases. melo, kobe, jr smith. zach lavine has that kind of a shot and i think it's very aesthetically pleasing. book does too, but it looks better from midrange than from three imo. he really elevates around the ft line, his three is a little more set. terrance ross also has a good looking jumper to me.   sidenote but i've always found klay's a little too ""mechanical"" to really say it's the best looking. it's picture perfect form, but a little too perfect. melo and jr had some sauce on it."
"Yep or when Zach Lavine got raked on the neck by Josh Jackson, spoke to jackson, jackson swiped the ball from Lavine on a deadball situation and it was a double technical..."
"Bro if everybody in the league sees that Kemba sucks rn, how in the fuck would the Celtics get Zach Lavine?"
“Kemba sucks!!!!” “Can we trade him for Zach Lavine” like wtf lol
Zach Lavine was “just a sixth man” as well.
"I have to admit im very surprised with how good the defense is. But the offense being 20th is a bit of a mirage.  Steph is 1st overall in offensive EPM and RPM. He's top 4 in total BPM, behind only Jokic, Embiid, and Doncic. He's only Warrior with a positive OBPM, and one of only two with a positive BPM, period (the other is Bazemore). This is a 30th overall offense carried by one player (who might be the best offensive player in the league).  Everything points to this season being a massive, 2006-Lakers level carry-job by Steph. Granted, the defense is for real, but like the 2001 Sixers (another massive carry) Steph's offensive genius allows Kerr to play very defensively slanted lineups.  I'm glad they're competitive so far, but they're basically .500 because Steph is playing MVP-level basketball with a bunch of low-to-medium talent guys who play hard. Wiseman has not made any impact. They're .500 because of Steph, Dray, and then a bevy of overachieving role players. That's a very fun team to root for, but i dont feel any different about my concerns in this post.  Steph is 33. Wiseman may be 2-3 years away. The Minnesota pick might convey to 2022. If Klay comes back clearly diminished--which is not impossible--there is no clear path to contention for this team. I was advocating trading picks to get Zach Lavine. I still wish we would do that, though he's probably been so good he's no longer on the market"
"As a certified Zach LaVine skeptic before this season, I’ve enjoyed eating my crow this season. He’s an all star imo. Over randle/sabonis/hayward"
"Zach LaVine: 4 years, $78,000,000   Buddy Hield: 4 years, $94,000,000"
I think both book and Mitchell are better passers than Lavine. Though Zach has more of an explosive scoring ability than either. He’s also (especially this year) a better 3 pt shooter than both.
"Facts, Zach Lavine is better imo"
I wonder when all these media people like Zach Lowe will apologize for hating on Lavine all these years
"Lavine was coming off an ACL tear though, so I’m pretty sure the general consensus was we needed Wiggins. I’m so happy we have Zach though, man is fucking dog."
"Sure if all you care about is a ring this very year. I care about Zach Lavine getting to experience the playoffs for the first time, and so are other young teams. Even the 76ers, if they dont win the east their star duo is still under 27."
someone needs to get zach lavine to a playoff contender
"Bulls are playing incredibly fun but inconsistent basketball coming out of a few terrible rebuild years with an awful coach. New coach, new front office, and a dedicated group of young players (including imminent All Star Zach Lavine and the youngest player in the league Patrick Williams), and one of the best veteran-led benches in the league. We still suck in crunch time (look at our record this year and note how many losses were lost by less than 6pts), but we are very quickly getting way better. Add this to the fact that Zach is about to make us a very attractive spot for FAs in the next few years, and we have a great many things to look forward to. We won’t be winning a chip any time soon, but we are poised to make a few deep playoff runs (prob not this year, tho we might make a brief appearance). Also, we have the best announcers in the league by far. Good announcers can make games so much more exciting. So yeah, that’s my bid for the Bulls—a bad and fun team that is about to be a good and fun team."
Swear to god I had a clown here maybe 2-1.5 years ago trying to tell me Richaun Holmes does more to help a team win than Zach LaVine. And also that Zach LaVine isn’t a top 50 player in the nba. Wish I remembered that accounts name because that guy deserves to be clowned
"So what you what you will, but I am more impress by a little guy who can dunk and still pull off a trick than I am of someone who is 6'6. Unless it's Aaron Gordon and Zach lavine."
"Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, Miles Bridges for sure.  Others I'd love to see: Ja Morant, Jaylen Brown, Zach Lavine (Again)"
"I kinda like these tiers.  Destroyer Class: Lebron, KD, Kawhi, Steph, Harden  Wrecking Crew: Bradley Beal, Zach LaVine, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, Devin Booker"
"He does it for the opposing team too, he's disaapointed, but still hype he's witnessing it. [Like when Zach Lavine shat all over us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncXFk74dMfc) for the comeback win."
"Honestly, I can see putting Mitchell over Zach, but I cannot understand how you can put Booker over Zach this season.   Zach’s stats are without a doubt much better than Booker’s this season, and he’s scoring at a much better efficiency on much more volume, when he’s the entire focus of the opposing defense, getting doubled every other time he touches the ball.   Beal said it himself, when you’re facing the Bulls, the entire gameplan is STOP ZACH LAVINE. And he hasn’t been stopped, lol.  People say it’s because of wins, but Booker was never on a winning team either until they picked up one of the greatest point guards of all time.   The Bulls, on the other hand, have been missing WCJ, Lauri, and OPJ (3 out of our 4 best players) nearly all season, and they have still lost 7 games by within 4 points, and a few off of some heartbreaking buzzer beaters. I know it’s not reality, but just a few points difference and the Bulls are the 5th seed or higher, and the perception around Zach would be totally different.   In the past, Booker and Mitch have both easily been better than Zach, but he’s taken an insane leap this season. If you replace Booker with Zach on the Suns, they’re unstoppable imo."
Except it isn't....Zach Lavine isn't the only star playing on teams that don't have a better scorer. Basically what they're implying is once again that Lavine is just a looter in a riot (star only doing well on a bad team)
Is it the Zach Lavine game???  “OHNOoooooo”
"Tatum, and it’s not really that close to be honest. LaVine is having a great year, and he’s awesome, I don’t mean to take anything away from him, he’s vaulted his game to a new level for him and it’s beyond impressive.  That being said, Tatum is almost exactly 3 years younger and has shown the drive and work ethic to develop all parts of his game, so 3 years from now I’m excited to see where his game is at. He’s also more versatile and a way better defender than Zach is.   Tatum has also shown great strides as a playmaker this year, which was missing before this season. Now, he’ll never be a natural playmaker that you run your whole offense through, but it’s a good tertiary skill after scoring and defense. He can play point forward and initiate the offense against 2nd units and should carve them up. LaVine also turns the ball over way more than Tatum, and Tatum’s AST/TO is above average whereas LaVine’s is downright bad averaging 5 APG and 4 TO’s.   So LaVine is a better shooter and slightly better scorer, but Tatum is a good and versatile defender, which LaVine is not. Tatum is a good playmaker for his position and LaVine is not. Tatum also has 3 more years to develop than LaVine, so his finished product should, in theory, be more polished and a better player.  LaVine is this era’s Scottie Pippen. They’re both 6-8 and 210 lbs, exactly the same. Pippen’s 4th season he was at 18 ppg 7 rpg and 6 apg, compared to Tatum’s 26 ppg 7 rpg and 5 apg. They both have 56% true shooting and they both have a PER of 21. Maybe the Tatum/Pippen thing sounded outlandish at first, but as you can see they’re basically identical players in their 3rd season. Pip ended up being an all-time great defender, which I think Tatum will just get to a very good defender, but regardless it’s scary how comparable they are."
"Tatum, but Lavine is having a stellar year. Tatum is just a much better defender while also being a similar scorer and playmaker. I really wanna see Zach in the playoffs, though. Dudes a killer."
"Zach Lavine has never had a loss to the pistons or magic in the 1980-90’s. Dude hasn’t even lost a single finals game, perfection"
This man don't miss.  At least not how I miss Zach LaVine.
Lol MJ who? 1-9 in the playoffs before Pippen while Zach Lavine undefeated in the playoffs on the same team.
"He’s been better than Beal. Zach has been better by almost every measurable statistic + more wins.  Lavine is at 29/6/5 on 52/44/85   Brad Beal is averaging 4 more points than lavine, but on 6 more shots, 5% worse shooting, 10% worse from 3, less assists, less rebounds, and less wins.  Literally all Beal has on him is 4 more points on 6 more shots. Zach has every other counting stat + more wins"
"I've been a huge LaVine fan since the day he was drafted. When we had originally traded Jimmy I was devastated but took small consolation in being able to say ""Hey, at least we got LaVine, a guy that I really like...""  I was just telling my friend the same thing - I always believed in Zach but I can't believe what we're witnessing him doing right now."
"However when Coby sits LaVine is +9.3. When they both on it is -9. Apparently it just mean we should have a playmaker instead of 2 shooting guards. It definitely does not imply Zach hurts the team, whoever reads it this way is biased"
"Props to the Kings. The whole game was pretty much just both teams exchanging punches at each other. Unfortunately for them, Zach Lavine -- despite coming off of a 28 FGA game last night -- has mamba mentality in him and was just absolutely relentless at driving to the rim.   Coby was also finally hitting his open looks again. Thank god. He really should play more of an SG role.  Finally, Halliburton has crazy play making poise for a rookie. Dude has shades of CP3 in him. damn."
"Fuckers telling me, always in the barber shop  ""Zach Lavine ain't 'bout this, Lavine ain't 'bout that""  My boy an Allstar on fucking MJ and them  He, he, they say that guy don't be putting in no work  Shut the fuck up, y'all ain't know shit  All y'all motherfuckers talkin' about ""Zach Lavine ain't no hitter, Zach Lavine ain't this, Zach Lavine a fake""  Shut the fuck up, y'all don't live with that man  Y'all know that man got caught with a 40 piece  Shootin' at the Pelicans and shit  Man been on a tear since fuckin' I don't know when  Motherfucker, stop fuckin' playin' him like that  Them boys savages out there  If I catch another motherfucker talking sweet about Zach Lavine  I'm fucking beatin' they ass, I'm not fucking playin' no more Know them Bulls roll with Pat Will and them  (Young Thaddeus on the beat)"
Zach Lavine
ZACH LAVINE IS THE GREATEST BULL OF ALL TIME
ZACH LAVINE IS THE GREATEST BULL OF ALL TIME
Fuck allstar ZACH LAVINE for MVP
**ZACH LAVINE IS A FUCKING ALL STAR.**  Cold-blooded assassin
Zach Lavine put up 38 points on 15/20 FGs and 3/6 3PTs tonight. He has been putting up similar number on same efficiency throughout the season  It'll be a real tragedy if he is not selected to be a All Star this season
Zach Lavine is so good
"yeah absolutely like the other version was just ""oh he got it we lost lol who cares"" it was really lame for the warriors commentators to do like i understand the pain but FOR EXAMPLE   eric collins on the zach lavine game winner against the hornets last year still made it awesome for bulls fans"
zach lavine has really good analytics now though
I didn’t watch I had money on that shit show of a game Toronto and Minny played so I’ll take your word for it. Zach Lavine has been playing at an all star level this season.
Lonzo ball  Zach Lavine   Evan Fournier  Nikola Vucevic   Deaaron fox  Just to name a few
Zach Lavine saw it live tho
"Analytics sucks the joy out of watching the game.  Two of my favorite players the past decade are, of course, Derrick Rose and Zach Lavine.  And I have to listen to idiots tell me they suck instead of just watching beautiful basketball"
aint no party-pooper but the off-arm. that's some BG's dunks. i see zach lavine and others who dont used that off-arm.  but insane dunk and def on the DotY
"Thats literally right up there with Zach LaVine on Alex Len, LeBron on Nurkic, Vince Carter on that french dude.. jesus christ, thats a legit poster none of that side dunk shit, he faced him and dunked on his fucking head"
Ok so let's say you win those two games that got fucked by the refs. You're now a .500 team. Is that what you want to be? Do you think you have the pieces moving forward to be a competitive team? I'm honestly not trying to hate. I like lavine white and Lauri a bunch. I'm honestly looking for good basketball discussion here. What do you see as the teams ceiling? What do you want your gm to do moving forward? I legit don't know what y'all's vision is. Zach is sick as fuck this year though so that's fun to watch.
"Harden/Jaylen/LaVine/Trae battling for the final 3 guard spots. Out of curiosity, who do folks like? Personally, I have Harden Jaylen and Zach"
It not that bad we're 12-16 and 9th in the east. If Bradley beal is a starter with a shit record zach lavine is definitely gonna be an all star.
&gt; They need to surround him with a second option that can help win a championship  And you think Zach LaVine whose never made the playoffs is that guy...?
True. I could see luka joining them. Zach Lavine is trending up lately too! Maybe durant falling out due to sharing with kyrie and harden. I don't trust Embiid to stay there.  If all those things happen it's back at 6 guys. Definitely in play!
Not just saying this because of the matchup but I've long (2-3 hours) thought Zach LaVine would be a nice fit on the Sixers.
"He was written off a few years ago, and since he's been on bad teams (and please don't look up and down the Bulls roster and tell me the Bulls have been a ""Zach LaVine just being better"" away from being some sort of threat), people are too stubborn to change their preconceived beliefs.  He's gonna be a big time free agent in a couple years. Assuming he switches teams, it's gonna be a big addition for somebody."
"Zach LaVine, RJ Barrett from the Knicks,  any big man"
"Zach got 3rd (ties with Harden) in players voting, so I truly wish coaches think similarly with their players.   It concerns me that we have not played many eastern teams yet, so hopefully those coaches have watched some of bulls games this season, instead of judging LaVine using the media narratives."
Bro im not trying to be a dick or anything but I just can't take u seriously after what you've said so far about Zach lol.  Maybe ur a great guy or whatever but when it comes to basketball I just can't keep talking to a dude who said the bulls are better without lavine and that you don't want to deal with his contract lmao. Sorry for coming off as dick but I just can't take u seriously lol
"Honestly bro if you still fail to see how great Zach Lavine is you should just stop watching basketball. I'm going to explain to you right now why those stupid on/off stats you're referencing are skewed but just know that in the future, so you don't get embarrassed the way I'm about to embarrass you right now, please use stats WITH CONTEXT.  If you're trying to use on/off stats for lavine to prove your point, I hope you realize that billy starts lavine with the young guys not the vets, which is why his on/off numbers are like that. Just look at his net rating when he doesn't play with Coby White, +9.3 lmao.  If you would have seen our most recent game you could literally see it for yourself.  First half billy starts lavine along with the young guys. Coby, pat, and wendell. They trail by 18 at halftime.  Before the second half begins he benches coby pat and wendell and starts thadd sato and denzel with lavine and temple to begin the 3rd quarter. Bulls outscore the pistons by 21 the rest of the game.  See?? Is that too hard for you to understand buddy? Next time use stats with context cuz you look really stupid right now. All of this coulda been avoided if you would have just watched our most recent game because it literally proves my point lol. U clearly dont watch basketball much less the bulls or zach.   People like you that base your entire opinions over stats without context are just pathetic. If u don't know how good lavine is on ur own, then you'll never truly know and thats a shame."
Zach LaVine is Jordan with hops confirmed
"Lavine shooting .437 from 3, Beal is .337 from 3. Zach is a full 10% higher and is taking 8 threes per game. To me, Lavine is a better three-level scorer. Also Lavine's net rating is +9.3 when Coby is off the floor, and surprisingly his defensive rtg with Coby off the floor is in the top 40 percentile. I would label Zach as the better defender, since we also know that Beal had the 2nd worst Real Plus-Minus in NBA last season and hasn't improved much"
Yes I’m a total fan boy of the bulls with my Celtics flair.  I’m watched like 3 Bulls game. It is pretty clear Zach Lavine is not accurately represented by those stats. And it’s pretty clear you haven’t watched Bulls games. Get a life.
"I'd say Steph, Giannis and sneakily Zach Lavine. But Zion seems really good. Shout out to Boban"
I do watch the bulls -  The bulls are +7.3 when Coby white plays and Zach Lavine doesn’t.  They are +6.8 when Zach Lavine just doesn’t play.  No impact metric has Lavine close to being ahead of brown or Trae young either
The bulls are +7.3 when Coby white plays and Zach Lavine doesn’t lol
"Where are you getting that data from?  Also, it’s not impressive that he’s -9 with Coby white. Coby white can’t be tanking you that much if Zach Lavine is as good as you say he is.  I can cherry pick Trae’s stats as well and come up with ways his plus minus should be better too, the fact is Trae plays positive basketball, Zach doesn’t. LaZy TaKe"
LaVine has Brown beat in every counting stat + efficiency iirc. And the C's are only 1.5 games ahead of the Bulls and Zach has been starting next to a group younger than many college squads.  He's that dude.
"Keep that same energy when talking about Luka, Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine"
Just like i said you obviously haven’t been watching the games but I don’t have anything to prove to a nobody. There’s been games where we were one shot away from winning and Zach Lavine ends up taking the most suspect ass shot without even trying to get open and then the other team holds the ball and runs the time out. You a dumbass little bitch
He's a better player than Zach Lavine every year.
"Zach Lavine is all-NBA too then right? 28.5-5.5-5.2 on 52.0% FG, 43.7% 3pt, 84.7% FT"
"On my team? Lavine. Bulls aren’t competing for championship rn, and subbing PG for Zach won’t change that. PG is the better player but he’s 5 years older, and honestly I just don’t really care for the guy.  As a rebuilding team, I’ll take the younger, more entertaining player. I think Lavine is also well-liked around the league and can maybe attract another star"
I’d put Patrick Williams in the mix somewhere as well. It’s mainly Zach Lavine showing up but they’re technically 2 games behind 4th while sitting in 9th currently. If Williams can improve his defense and continue to make his shots when he’s called he can turn into that missing piece they’ve been missing in that position in a few years.
I mean if u think vuc deserves to be an all star over zach lavine then I hate to be that guy but I'd rather just stop the conversation there.  I could list every shooting stat or answer any questions u may have about Zach but If you don't understand how good Zach is at this point on your own then I don't think you'll ever truly understand.
"Patrick Williams didn't start in college, neither did Zach Lavine. Donte was really good in college and has easily outperformed his draft expectation. Half the players outside the lottery don't make it in the league."
"Oh I mean Lavine is still avging over 5 assists per game. And with the injuries the Bulls have had this season, he has to score. And Lavine draws so much attention that it helps the rest of the offense. Opposing teams always blitz picknroll, which leads to Zach getting many hockey assists each game, which I assume Trae gets as well. The real deciding factor here is that Lavine is the better scorer and it's not even debatable. Lavine's efficiency is ridiculous - 43.7% from 3 on over 8 attempts per game is insane for a guy whose threes are mostly off the dribble/unassisted. Not to mention Lavine is the better defender as well. Bulls have a slightly better record and overall net rating than the hawks so far, so it's not really anything going in Trae's favor other than playmaking"
"&gt;Yea but the east is so close right now u can say that about any team.  Absolutely. My point was more that I feel like the Magic should have separated themselves from the pack. They have no right to be just a bit behind those other teams, while I think the Magic should be hanging out with the Pistons at the bottom  &gt;Plus I'm pretty sure the magic only started sucking cuz all their guards got hurt.  Yeah that's what I meant. They've had almost no guards and still been not total shit, and now have literally no guards but still not quite as bad as I'd expect  &gt;Nobody has vuc making it because he doesn't deserve to make it over guys like Zach  Fair enough. I just think Vuc is a more deserving player than Lavine"
Yea but the east is so close right now u can say that about any team. For all u know lavine gets hurt and the bulls bottom out as the worst team in the east.  Bulls aren't exactly killing it with talent either lol. Plus I'm pretty sure the magic only started sucking cuz all their guards got hurt. I think MCW is back idk about cole tho.  Either way if u genuinely think vuc deserves that spot over lavine thats just wrong imo. Nobody has vuc making it because he doesn't deserve to make it over guys like Zach. And its not a slight on vuc its just the truth this year. People like u gotta realize that if ur gonna put a player like vuc in ur gonna leave a way more deserving player like Zach out. And thats just even more messed up.
"Lavine is a shooting guard...not a point guard. He also doesn't have a legit pg on his team, which is causing him to play out of position amd carry the load. As of a week ago, Lavine still had a higher assist/TO ratio than Booker.   Trae is a point guard, his role is to create for teammates. But when his shot isn't falling, the hawks can go through cold stretches offensively. There is higher variance in Trae's performance, while Zach has been fairly consistent relative to all scorers."
"Lavine's net rating with Coby off the floor is +9.3. Any analytics you might see that portrays Lavine as a bad defender should be taken with a grain of salt. Lavine has been an avg defender, if not better, on ball. Any non-casual fan who watches bulls games this year can see Lavine passes the eye test. Last yr Zach used to get burned, but this yr I know for a fact he has become much better. Stats without coby below:  https://www.nba.com/stats/impact/advanced/#!?LineupIDs=203897&amp;VsLineupIDs=1629632&amp;TeamID=1610612741&amp;VsTeamID=1610612741"
"Bro how are you gonna say that without knowing the Bulls? Wendell Carter missed most of the start of the season. Lauri Markannen is out 4 weeks right now. Don't talk out your ass and make shit up to make a point.  Zach Lavine is in the same situation Trae is and is performing better, deal with it lol"
"So Lavine should lose his spot because Trae has an inconvenient situation and chooses to take deep 3s? Bad coaching and bad teammates for Trae mean that Zach Lavine should lose his spot?  By the way, who's the best player Zach Lavine has played with on the Bulls?"
It would truly be a shame if the bulls didn’t have Zach Lavine to carry them to 11-16. What would their future be?
"That's just false this year. Trae may be involved on more points than Lavine, but his splits are so much worse.  FG/3P/FT lavine: 52/43.7/84.7 Trae: 42.9/36.9/88.7  Trae is technically involved in more points, but is not even close in efficiency. Shooting 50/40 on 28.5 ppg is insane.  Zach also leads the league in 4th Q points and ""clutch"" points, while Trae's Hawks have been one of the worst 4Q teams in the league this year.  The all star cases aren't really close"
What about Zach Lavine
Look at lavines on/off numbers when he doesn't play with coby white. He has a net rating of +9.3 without coby lmao.  Using on/off stats to prove your braindead take on Zach lavine without context is embarrassing.  You don't even need to use these stats if you simply just watch him play. Embarrassing argument from you. You clearly don't watch Zach LaVine or the Bulls.
"Dame cheat code or not, Zach LaVine fucking daggered the Blazers with that step back with like ten seconds left the first game they played. It was vicious."
"Harden and Jayson Tatum look like locks for reserves. Zach LaVine has been playing his way into the ASG as of late. Jimmy Butler, though he's missed a lot of games, should be in due to his value to the Heat. Sabonis putting up good enough numbers to be in. Jaylen Brown will probably join Tatum. As a Knicks fan, I'll go with Julius Randle for the last spot."
Better than LaVine according to Zach Lowe
"All time?  Derrick Rose, Kobe Bryant, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan  *(I started watching basketball in the 2000s)*  Current: Damian Lillard, Zach Lavine, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Joel Embiid"
"Jalen green wouldn’t be a good fit on the warriors, he’s an elite scoring, and nothing else prospect. Kinda like young Zach lavine."
Chris Paul is making it over him IMO. And even after that there's Zach Lavine

"Zach Lavine needs help. It's really unfortunate that all throughout his career so far he's been surrounded by a bunch of young talent that just hasn't panned out. I don't know how he's managed to stay so focused and just get better and better, but if I were him I'd be at a breaking point right now. He's legit one of the best players in the league and no one else on that team shows up on most nights other than Thad Young."
I would do:  Jaylen Brown + three FRPs for Zach LaVine.
"exactly... they would be trading zach lavine for picks or young guys... just to PRAY that one of those players turns into zach lavine lol. i'd rather play the odds hoping he wants to stay long term, considering everything seems to be going well and progressing along his timetable so far... i don't see why he would want to jump ship now"
I think Lavine is 100% better than KAT this year. Two years ago yea I’m taking KAT every day of the week but Zach has gotten so much better and KATs defense has regressed horribly which is a big deal at a 5.
"Thank you! “Give me guys you lead teams” yet lists Devin Booker who has never made the playoffs, Zach Lavine who has never made the playoffs, and Beal who debatably has never been the best player on a playoff team over Kyrie who was the 2nd best player on a championship team."
"So underrated, instead of 20 threads of Zach Lavine and Dame being called underrated we should talk about him"
"Duh, their team is not performing well.The league, its fans, and tv networks like exciting players on good, big market teams.  Anything else is meh.   Wonder why you dont get a lot of Bulls games? Zach Lavine is exciting but the Bulls are not good. Same for Curry and the Warriors, same for Lillard and the Blazers (sorry Blazers fans), Vucevic is good, but Orlando is not.   On the flip side, the Jazz and Nuggets are really good teams but their players are not that exciting. (I love Jokic but tv networks, casual fans, and the league like athleticism which Jokic lacks, Mitchell is not at that level, plus Utah is a small market team and its fan are notoriously racist, just google it). Same for the Suns, team is great but no one player stands out, despite Booker being great."
"Really? Im not good at finding specific stats for advanced stuff like this, but I swore that Dame was so dominant in the clutch statistically &amp; via the eye test that it's not even close.  [https://ca.nba.com/news/stat-just-happened-damian-lillard-has-taken-dame-time-to-another-stratosphere/qsbaren5il201qs1dqk70ieqg](https://ca.nba.com/news/stat-just-happened-damian-lillard-has-taken-dame-time-to-another-stratosphere/qsbaren5il201qs1dqk70ieqg)  I think he's leading the league in clutch scoring along with guys like Zach Lavine with an 80 TS percentage... which is insane. Correct me if Im wrong tho"
even if he won he would still be criticized for not being on the same level as Zach Lavine or Aaron Gordon
https://twitter.com/KevinMcC973/status/1363555930483400706  &gt; Zach LaVine shot 2-16 (16.7%) when guarded by Matisse Thybulle on Friday night.  interested to see this matchup again
"Feel like no one here watched rookie Zach lavine , he was historically bad.  His name never gets brought up as a shitty rookie player.   But he made a huge step in Year 2 and 3 before he tore his acl"
What the fuck you think you can trade for Zach Lavine
"And khris Middleton, Steph curry, Zach lavine, Kyrie Irving, Kevin durant, Paul George are also close"
"He's been exclusively a SG this year. Not in the past, but even he and Nash have said so.  I would also include Booker, Jaylen Brown, Zach Lavine, Donovan Mitchell and Shai Gilgeous Alexander"
Hot take. Zach Lavine is the best of the Minnesota young big 3 they were building around and they gave him up first.
"I came in here expecting Perkins to have trashed him. Luka getting the same treatment Giannis gets. Win. Prove you're a winner. Same as any superstar on a losing team. DeMarcus Cousins, AD, Kyrie, Russell the Muscle, Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, all have had or have similar criticisms. This ain't hating."
"What he's saying is he will take proven players (e.g. Jimmy butler) over unproven guys (e.g. Zach Lavine) .  Forget about the timeline and what not, just get him good players period ."
Zach Lavine is the best comp here and its not close
"in the 2020-2021 season, Zach LaVine is a far better scorer than Devin Booker"
Zach Lavine has 50%+ more qualifying FGA than almost everyone else.   Only person closer than that is LBJ. Lavine still has 25% more attempts than LeBron.
"He hated on Devin Booker for years and changes his tune only last season   He’s hated on Zach Lavine for years and only changed his tune this season   During the redraftables series he drafted Javale McGee too early and his reason was that he played minutes on those warriors teams   He thinks Trae Young sucks even though he’s objectively one of the best offensive players in the league   He doesn’t have to spell it out for me, I’ve been listening for long enough lol"
Zach Lavine!
"yeah somehow the bottom part of this thread turned into lavine v booker. i think a bulls fan will say zach and a suns fan will say devin, all i’m saying is that zach is a better scorer."
"the big point were the absolute numbers. i’m not a professional statician but i’m all ears to anyone with a different opinion. also tatum doesn’t do it as often as zach, and since the celtics have numerous threats aside from tatum, he doesn’t get guarded as much whereas lavine has had 3 guys on him at once before."
"Zach Lavine is great and I have defended him on this sub before but making a 30 game sample size argument and using rebound and assist numbers is not the way to do it.   First off, Book has CP3. He averages almost 9 assists a game. Lavine doesn't have anyone close on his team that produces like CP3. That detracts away from assists.  Secondly, Book has Ayton. Ayton take 11 rebounds a game. But regardless, rebounding isn't necessarily a focal role for a shooting guard. Also the Bulls don't have anyone averaging 8+ rebounds. In the end why does it matter that Lavine gets more uncontested defensive rebounds than Book? Super irrelevant.  Lavine is great but once he's on a team with another primary ball handler those stats will dip. Your comparing apples and oranges when context of roles and roster construction matters"
"&gt;I added up the average assists per game of the other four starters and the highest bench assists guy on the Suns, Celtics, and Bulls:  Not really a great way of doing it because it doesn't factor in the roles of the players you're actually looking at.  1. Marcus Smart assisting Robert Williams doesn't impact how Tatum plays the game 2. You're counting guys who haven't played half the games so far    &gt;4.6 from Kemba...6.1 from Marcus Smart   Your stat makes it look like we've had 2 PGs, we've only had 2 PGs for 5 games out of 36.   Marcus got hurt right as Kemba was coming back from injury. So you're counting these as two separate players but they should really only count as one aggregate player. It hasn't been Smart **and** Walker, it's been Smart **or** Walker.     &gt;Zach is putting up those numbers WITHOUT a true point guard.  And Tatum often runs his offence on his own. We use him in a similar way to how GSW used Durant. GSW would play to their system and then pull Curry/Klay and let KD carry the bench on his own.   We run Tatum + Bench a lot. It's been a running theme for our team for about 2-ish years now, Tatum's been the only star who can consistently carry our bench.    ***  A better way to find what you're looking for is to just look at assisted v unassisted shots [\(example link here\)](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1628369/shooting/).     Player| Assited FGM| Unassisted FGM| % Unassisted ---|---|----|--- Tatum| 103 | 176| 63.1 Booker| 126 |158| 55.6 LaVine| 136| 214| 61.1  Tatum is creating for himself at a higher rate than either of the other two."
"zach lavine &gt; devin booker. it’s okay to have different opinions, but you cant deny zach is doing things booker has never done. ever"
"i see that argument but: even if zach comes down in the second half and is on par with booker he’s still more athletic and has for assists and rebounds per game. also i don’t think he’s gonna come down, i’d take lavine over booker if i were drafting a team"
"He is good. He’s taken a huge step up this year while Tatum has played poorly. I still take booker over Lavine because Zach has really only this year where he’s upped his efficiency, shooting, and passing. I personally doubt that Lavine is just a 44% 3 pt shooter on super high volume. That would be curry levels of shooting. But even if he can keep it around 40% that’s very very good. If he keeps this up though... Tatum is good and also brings good defense just I think he gets overvalued often. I don’t think he can be the single first option on a great team yet. His efficiency needs to go up for me to trust him more."
Zach Lavine isn't better than Booker lol
"Zach Lavine is better than Booker in every facet of the game. I’ve started to watch a lot of Suns games and Booker has a lot of flaws, especially in his pick and roll w Ayton. Also Booker can’t be trusted in the clutch like Lavine or CP3."

Daily Discussion Thread : [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/wiki/rules#wiki_daily_discussion_thread)"
"Happy Birthday, Zach Lavine!! He just turns 26 today. Two years away from his prime. It is going to be several nice years for the bulls."
"6th seed, might as well take on the Lakers.   The Bulls in this hypothetical scenario of being in the West will either die another victim to LeBron or somehow cause a major upset.   And Zach Lavine making his playoff bow against the biggest name in the NBA is exactly what I want to see, a chance to cement himself as a star in the league"
"I’m not trying to hate on Randle, and I think he’s closer to too 30, but since I already did 19 players I’ll keep going:  Curry, KD, LeBron, Harden, Giannis, Dame, AD, Kawhi, George, Embiid, Jokic, Butler, Simmons, Gobert, Booker, Paul, Kyrie, Beal, Vucevic, KAT, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zion, Zach Lavine, Trae Young, SGA, Luka,  Bam Adebayo  That’s 28, there’s probably some players that are slipping my mind right now. But that puts him right around top 30, like I said. Idk about 36th though, unless we start counting guys that are out like Klay Thompson, Nurkic, CJ, etc."
Early results look good but Zach Lavine should be a bit higher
"Tatum's not really on that tier as a scorer this year, more of a rounded contributor.  Zach Lowe can think what he likes and make whatever incredulous noises he likes about comparing LaVine to Tatum, but the simple fact is that LaVine has been really damn good."
"Lavine is literally still being called an empty stats player, idk where that he gets a pass shit from. Lavine, Trae Toung, and Booker were. You can literally go to any previous season and check our postgame threads.  And Kenna Walker is a better player than Lavine? Something that isn’t even disputed. Your point?  Also, that team that should get us 8th Seed, you do know that Porter Jr, and Markannen have been out the vast majority of this season to injury right? So... a team of Lavine, Thaddeus Young, Coby White is supposed to get us to the playoffs.   Zach and Stephen Curry’s current numbers are nearly identical. Outside of literally turning into Lebron or 2018-2019 Harden, he can only do so much."
Zach Lavine is not better than Ben Simmons.
"Tatum &gt; Simmons &gt; Brown &gt; Mitchell &gt; Booker &gt; LaVine No disrepect to any though because as you rightly point out it is a very tightly contested group. Tatum, Simmons, &amp; Brown are much better defenders than the other 3. Tatum is a proven go to scorer in the clutch so he's #1 imo. Mitchell is proven in the playoffs so he's &gt; Book, Zach. Zach is least proven out of all 6."
Zach Lavine would like a word.
"I think Zach LaVine was just horribly unlucky,  He was drafted into a Minnesota team that clearly has the inability to develop star players and get them the right coaching and support to succeed. Minnesota has proven to be unable to develop good players, and even with KAT it’s clear that they haven’t optimized him to his potential.  He then got traded to Chicago and had to deal with the shitshow of the Boylen years, and an organization with no clear direction or approach to winning. However he finally got a good coach, and a group of dudes who can help him out and look what happened. It just proves how much the team you’re drafted into matters.  People said the same thing about Booker, until Monty Williams came along and really started to build for success. It’s just that LaVine got unlucky twice."
"The differences Ts% between Tatum and Booker, who both average 24.9 points, is less than the difference between Booker and LaVine. Tatum is 54.7 booker 59.7 and LaVine 65.3.He is also averaging 28.7 points. Zach should be in a tier of his own tbh."

"See my edit on last comment for percent of FGA by distance, not as good as a shot chart but it's something.  Last Year: 0-3ft 37.4%, 3-10% 8.3%, 10-16 4.8%, 16-3P 9.3%, 3P+ 40.4%  This Year: 0-3ft 32.1%, 3-10% 10.3%, 10-16 5.5%, 16-3P 10.6%, 3P+ 41.4%  Here is FGA frequency by nearest defender distance:  Last year:0-2 ft 12.6%, 2-4 ft 39.5%, 4-6 ft 33.2%, 6ft+ 14.7%  This year: 0-2 ft 9.5%, 2-4 ft 41.1%, 4-6 ft 36.0%, 6ft+ 13.5%.  Seems to be slightly more open this year, I'm going down a Zach LaVine rabbit hole."
Lowe hates lavine because he’s the better Zach.
"I just googled it, and those numbers seem to just be plucked from nowhere.  I honestly seriously doubt he even has a 40"" standing vert, the highest ever recorded in the NBA combine is 38""  Aaron Gordon's standing vert is 32.5""  Zach Lavine did a max vertical of 41.5"" in the combine"
I’m sure Zach LaVine is thrilled to finally have Simmons approval.  Bet that was keeping him up at night
"Any ball dominant guard? Zach LaVine, Trae, SGA would all be in completely different roles on the warriors that wouldn’t fit them very well"
You seriously can’t be asking this question right?   You actually think KD’s career would be different with an average point guard?   Zach Lavine and Bradley Beal are averaging 29+ PPG on bad teams with no point guard &amp; they’re worse players than KD in every aspect   KD is a 7ft marksman that creates his shot at will from anywhere &amp; finishes 70%+ at the rim.  He doesn’t rely on anyone to score. His stats actually see little drop off with Westbrook or Curry off the floor if you don’t include 1 anomaly post season. Check u/SilentGenuis comment. Ben doesn’t really like KD &amp; is critical of his game. KD’s one of the better offensive engines in the game lol.
Is Zach Lavine gonna win an mvp in the next 5 years on the bulls?
Nba combine is 2 step for max vertical. That is why their numbers are so much lower than when they do team workouts and post realistic numbers. Zach Lavine for example at the Lakers draft workout vs combine
"Zach Lavine. Don't get me wrong, he is a great player. But looking at his stats, you would think he is Kevin Durant or Michael Jordan."
"""The key here ... is patience.""  See Derrick Rose.  He went down with an ACL injury in his left knee in the 2012 playoffs.  He was heavily criticized for refusing to come back after nine months when the team doctors cleared him.    But despite taking a cautious approach and sitting out an entire season, in November of 2013, the season he did return, he tore the meniscus in his *right* knee.  While that seems like a horrible coincidence, when returning from an injury there's a danger of overcompensation leading to other seemingly-unrelated injuries.  Surgeons tried to repair the meniscus tear instead of removing it, meaning he took another season off recovering and rehabbing.  But then in February of 2015, he tore his meniscus again, and this time it had to be removed.  During that time between his initial ACL tear and his second meniscus tear, he also suffered a series of brief injuries such as sprained ankles, sore knees, and sore or strained hamstrings.  Each soreness was treated cautiously because of his injury history, and yet he was unable to avoid further serious knee injuries.  It may be that Rose, whose game depended a lot on his athleticism, just never learned how to land properly, and didn't have or couldn't develop a fallback game when he became cautious about putting pressure on his knees.    Chris Paul had his meniscus removed in 2010 and admits that he did not take rehab seriously enough.  But he's been able to compensate for whatever athleticism he lost.    Zach LaVine tore his ACL in February 2017 and seems to have recovered nicely, even retaining his athleticism.  However, the injury, rehab, and recovery doubtless delayed his development and accounts for some of the surprise at the player he's become this season, three and a half years after his injury.  I don't think it's fair to expect Murray to return to form the first year he returns.  It may be two years before he returns to form, and three years before he takes another leap -- and that may be optimistic.  I wish him the best, but I wouldn't count on him being a factor for the Nuggets for quite a while.  And yes, injuries suck."
"Zach Lavine  For the 50 pointers, going to the All Star game and making the Bulls watchable…again"
"I’m picking Magic, we already have discount Steph Curry in Zach Lavine. It’s easier to put shooters around Magic than a good big man around Curry."
"I think most guys are physically fine after about 9-10 months but considering he’s a big part of their future and they’d want to make sure he’s 110%, they’ll probably wait 12. Pretty sure Zach Lavine took 12 months. Plus it’ll take him some time to actually get back into rhythm."
"Khris Middleton last year, Tobias Harris, Chris Paul, Jokic, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Zach Lavine, Mikal Bridges, John Collins were all pretty close-very close"
Zach Lavine any day!
"Just wanted to highlight a magnificent season from Zach Lavine. The Bulls ended up not making the playoffs and hence the national media may not report on this, but that should not take away from Lavine’s historic feat and it should be widespread knowledge around the league."
"2014 was a weird draft class. Wiggins 1st, Jabari Parker 2nd.    Embiid at 3rd, Aaron Gordon 4th and Marcus Smart 6th were the only top ten picks that weren't total busts imo. Remember Dante Exum and Nic Stauskas? Yeah me neither but they sound kind of familiar. Elfrid Payton, to whom I've frequently heard Knicks fans refer as the devil himself, rounds it off at number 10.    Zach Lavine went 13th, and Jokic didnt get taken until the 2nd round. Crazy huh?    CBS sports ranks it as the 5th worst draft class of the last two decades: https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-draft-looking-back-and-ranking-the-five-worst-draft-classes-since-2000/"
"As a Bulls fan looking for a PG to fit alongside Zach Lavine and Nikola Vucevic I would go with:  1 Malcolm Brogdon  2 Spencer Dinwiddie  3 Fred VanVleet  Brogdon *slightly* edges out the others in some more advanced stats like TS% or PER but it's very slight.  Dinwiddie is the best facilitator of the group, but again it's only a slight edge.  For the Bulls it'd come down to the best on ball defender as that's currently a weakness on the roster in guarding other elite PGs in the NBA."
You keep saying this like it’s some kind of gotcha but the clear answer is the option that shows Lavine we are serious about building around him. What good is having picks and cap space when you don’t have a star? Why refuse to build around the star we currently have on the off chance that one of those picks turns into a star?  Zach and vucevic are a great fit together and we still have pieces to move around this offseason. Just because it hasn’t worked in the second half of a single season that included a stretch where Zach was out for like 15 games doesn’t mean it WONT work.   $20 mil in cap space also doesn’t mean shit if no players want to come here
"Giannis, Zach LaVine, Vucevic, Thad Young, Ryan Arcidicano"
Free Zach LaVine
Lol every time someone says Zach lavine is good these threads amuse me. Stat padder that will never be a leader of a good team
Zach Lavine kind of. Never looked like a bust but people definitely did not imagine him to become this good lol.
zach lavine was out for like 12 games
Could Ben be traded for Zach Lavine?
"Books been pretty consistent over the last 4 season in efficiency as well. Zach was league average until this year when he blew up and was hyper efficient.   If he keeps it up next year they're probably in the same tier of player. Only reason I give Booker the nod right now is its been a few years of this level of efficiency. (At least offensively)   It seems like a lot of the guys that worked with Hanlan are really taking off though. Booker, Beal, Lavine, Embiid, and Tatum. Guy is training the entire next generation of superstars."
"All-star sub. No All-nba.   Donovan Mitchell/Zach Lavine better.   You're all nephews."
All-star sub. No All-nba.   Donovan Mitchell/Zach Lavine better.   You're all nephews.
"Indeed it does. Not claiming hes a Jokic, but he's not exactly Zach Lavine either. His shots all rhythm and one short fluid motion, he's not exploding off the jump. With his touch I bet he can hit that shot 9/10 times without leaving his feet"
"&gt;	ACL injuries are nothing these days.  Why do people keep saying this? Can you list the players who had an ACL and came back just as good?    Zach Lavine is the only guy who has had an ACL injury in recent memory that came back just as good (and he was already in the top tier of athleticism). Everyone else I can think of had their career take a turn for the worse — Porzingis, Jabari Parker, Brandon Knight, Rondo, D.Rose, etc. It’s another reason I’m not optimistic about Klay (ACL *and* Achilles? Yikes)."
zach lavine is my personal  dream but here is the list   https://www.spotrac.com/nba/free-agents/2022/
"I remember seeing him in the dunk contest in 2015 and being like  ""This kid sucks.""  Cause he missed all of his first round dunks and the second round one was mediocre. And Zach Lavine was throwing up Vince level dunks between Mason Plumlee and Victor Oladipo."
Because Kevin Fucking Durant made history. It’s not like Zach Lavine was out there carrying the Nets
"yeah, Beverly sounds like that 8th seed shit was a long time ago. that was 2 years ago.  Zach LaVine hasn't even made it to the playoffs and he's been in the league 7 years."
If a team had Zach lavine as their 3rd option they definitely would not be 7-8 seed lmfao wtf
Bruh if Zach lavine had the same amount of help that Booker has right now they would definitely be a winning team
Agree. A few years ago I wasn’t convinced about Zach Lavine but the last couple years on the bulls the guy has been a legit star
Whiteside and Bummond. Zach Lavine is not an “empty stats” player wtf
Im sorry I really cant answer this question if you have prime Zach Lavine starting in front of prime Derrick Rose haha
"List was definitely not exhaustive. I'm a big Bam fan, Middleton is really good, maybe siakam has a big bounce-back season, zach lavine. The league really is stacked right now and it's great to see"
"If he were to play off a high level pullup shooter like Steph, Trae, Lillard, Luka, or harden. Probably even someone like Tatum or Zach Lavine would help him out   He can be used as a screener for them and get the ball rolling down hill and have a 4on3 advantage. Basically the draymond role in Golden state"
Tier 1:   1) Kyrie   2) DBook   3) Ice Trae   4) Mitchell   Tier 2:   5) Pandemic P  6) Beal   Tier 3:  7) Zach LaVine  8) Jaylen Brown   9) Old man Cliff
"&gt; This isn't true. Every star traded from 2016-2018 were sent out for trade packages that were worse, when the warriors were on top you could get a star for cheap  &gt; The Kawhi trade was worse  I disagree, Kawhi was worse than Harden and desperately wanted out, lowering his value in the first place (and Kawhi only had one year), and then they still got an all-star, a young role player, who's now one of their better players, and a pick  &gt; Demarcus Cousins was traded for Tyreke Evans, Buddy Hield and a first  Factoring in the value difference between Boogie and Harden makes it not that bad, but fine, this one was pretty bad at the time  &gt;Butler was traded for a first and Zach Lavine who was a bench player at the time  SEVERELY disagree with this. Firstly, they also got Dunn who was seen as a productive high potential guy, but Lavine definitely had a lot of value. No one thought he'd be THIS good, but he had value, especially before the injury. And it wasn't just any first, it was the #7 pick in a pretty decent draft year. Obviously in hindsight you could even say the Bulls won, but even at the time, it doesn't come close to as bad as the Harden return.   &gt;Besides, the Rockets objective is clearly to tank, Simmons gets you more wins while still leaving you well outside the playoffs. But the time they are good again, Simmons will be at the end of his contract  Simmons wouldn't get them more than 25 wins. You cant raise a floor that much without offense. So yeah they wanted to tank, but Simmons wouldn't have ruined that. Just would've brought them from best odds at the #1 pick to maybe 6th or 7th, which is still over 30% chance at a top 4 pick"
Anyone know If Zach Lavine has been invited or committed to joining the team?
"&gt;But that rockets trade was one of the worst returns in recent history  This isn't true. Every star traded from 2016-2018 were sent out for trade packages that were worse, when the warriors were on top you could get a star for cheap  -The Kawhi trade was worse  -Demarcus Cousins was traded for Tyreke Evans, Buddy Hield and a first  -Butler was traded for a first and Zach Lavine who was a bench player at the time    &gt;They could've got Simmons and firsts (and at a point when Simmons was seen as a budding star, not an unplayable max player)  He was seen by some as that, but there were plenty who understood his limitations. Maybe the Rockets were some of those people  Besides, the Rockets objective is clearly to tank, Simmons gets you more wins while still leaving you well outside the playoffs. But the time they are good again, Simmons will be at the end of his contract"
De'Aaron Fox  Zach Lavine  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Bradley Beal  in that order
"I think all of these guys have that potential. as to who will do it first, my guess is Zach lavine. I expect the Bulls to be a lot better next season even with minimal roster changes, although they really need a better PG. Lavine has improved drastically every year and I still think he's the most underrated player in the league.   The Bulls are either making a playoff run next season or they suck in which case Lavine will leave and join a contender. either way I think Lavine will be an MVP candidate in two years"
"Zach Lavine. The bulls are built very similar to PHO. Star scoring guard, scoring big man, 3-D young player on the wing, and is looking for a PG that could lead them."

I draw NBA players in anime/comic style. Some of favorite drawings:  [LeBron](https://www.instagram.com/p/CD_nNdbArkf/?utm_medium=copy_link)  [Zach LaVine](https://www.instagram.com/p/COiplVttDJ5/?utm_medium=copy_link)  [Russell Westbrook](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-mzQF2Ayla/?utm_medium=copy_link)  [Ben and Joel as Jojo Characters](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8g8BA1A0R7/?utm_medium=copy_link)
"Tf u mean lmao in game 5 Dame put up 55/11 yet all his teammates went 2/19 in the clutch. That includes CJ who went 7/22  Also his TS for the regular season is only 57% so thats not exactly jaw dropping. For comparison, Zach Lavine this year averaged 27 on 64% TS"
"Ya that is pretty good considering he is a guard. Think of how many guards you have being all star snubs every year. Even in the east this year we have Bradley Beal, Malcolm Brogdon, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine. Guards have always been NBA's deepest position."
"It's not their worst move ever, but still an error and when you look at the FO decision process as a whole and indicative of the trend of mismanaging the roster and misjudging the team's outlook.  We can get into the Jason Thompson trade, taking Stauskas over Zach LaVine, drafting Jimmer Fredette (pre-Vivek but still), firing Michael Malone for no good reason, hiring Luke Walton in the first place and more if you want, the point is that they consistently make bad decisions, doing nothing with Bogdanovic fits the trend."
"In a pretty random order and from the top of my head I’d say:  Derrick Rose   Luka  Brad Beal  Kelly Oubre  Gordon Hayward  Kevin Love  Steven Adams  Zach LaVine  D’lo  Kemba Walker  Russ (despite my flare this isn’t biased I swear, I’m just attracted to that man, his body and overall intensity is 🔥👌🏻)"
"Zach LaVine, too (he's still waiting on good coaching &amp; good teammates)"
"Any bottom half team like the Bulls needs to take notes from what the Hawks did. They need to build around a strong core; Zach Lavine and Nikola Vucevic, this doesn’t mean bringing in another scorer, but rather, bring in several veteran scorers who are accustomed to winning and are comfortable with coming off the bench. There’s no need to tank especially after so many years."
"Zach himself may decide he wants out at some point, though he seems like a pretty loyal guy. The Bulls fans sure as hell aren't clamoring to trade him and neither is the new front office. In fact it's just the opposite, AKME went all in on LaVine when they traded for Vucevic and Bulls fans are sick to death of rebuilds."
&gt;You know that video of Zach Lavine learning how to not travel on the front page right now  This is that post :p
Missing Zach Lavine who really stepped up this year and for whatever reason Kevin Love...
"So intentional fouling on fast breaks is illegal in Euroleague, so either the fast break works or the defense gets a stop. I don't watch a ton of Euroleague, but from what I've seen this isn't a call that gets made often because it's simply not in the playbook to stop a fast break with a foul (the reason we see it so much in the NBA is because it's a known easy way to stop the fast break).   I don't want to give the impression Euroleague referees are better or anything though. If y'all think NBA refs suck y'all are in for a real show during these Olympics.   You know that video of Zach Lavine learning how to not travel on the front page right now? He's doing that because international refs fucking LOOOOOOOOVE to call travels. Hand check? Moving screen? They don't give a shit about that. All they care about is that sweet sweet travel call.   I'm barely even exaggerating."
"&gt;As a sixers fan, I obviously really want Zach but I'm genuinely curious on Bulls fans' opinions on their team right now.  Are you that Sixers fan who thinks they should sign Zach LaVine for 20 million a year. Dude must eat paste for suggesting shit like that"
"No it doesn't. I could see the bulls being interested in Simmons but we're not trading Lavine for him. If Zach does make it clear that he wants out next season, which is a big if, we'd be able to get an offer that sets the team up far better for the future than that."
I hope Jordan Lawley releases the full workouts. I’m tryna on my Zach Lavine shit
"Hey that’s JLaw the trainer, nice to see him putting in work w Zach LaVine"
"I mean it was the only way they could keep Zach Lavine which might not work anyway he could ask to leave if things go bad this season. I would love to see John Wall on this team not sure if the money would work, but that be a fun team"
"Yep, I've seen too many of these ""rumors"" that were just click-baits. There were even worse cases like Zach LaVine said on a podcast about ""I guess XXX player would be a good fit to YYY team"" and the next day you saw all the posts referring to Zach."
There was a video of Zach Lavine working with a Turkish Pro player and learning what is allowed because of the travel calls. Really cool to see it being enforced
The article lists:  1. Zion Williamson 2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Karl Anthony Towns 4. De’Aaron Fox 5. Zach Lavine
For me it's Moody (really doubt Presti takes him based on his MO in the draft though)  Bouknight is interesting though. More of a Presti pick than Moody but not as much as Kuminga and Barnes  I think he is a project too in his own way (playmaking and shot selection is less than ideal for a guard) but athleticism/shot creation gives me some Zach Lavine/Devin Booker vibes  Moreover it's easier for me to project him as a go to option in today's guard driven league than it is a guy like Barnes--whose ceiling assuming his shooting doesn't magically improve suggest a high end role player ceiling like a current Ben Simmons or Draymond (who is really good but I doubt we are talking about him as a star if he doesn't have three of the greatest shooters ever around him) rather than a 1st/2nd/even 3rd scoring option in today's superteam era on a championship team
"Agree with this one... Nowadays i am too looking forward more to the 3 point shoot out and not that lame dunk contest..  Note: when i am still a kid up to college days, my fave NBa all star event is the Slam dunk contest but since entering 2010's the only exciting dunk contest i have watched are the Aaron Gordon vs Zach Lavine and the other Aaron Gordon dunk where d wade gave him a 9 score"
"I hate these stupid takes. If anything this season has shown it has shown that it’s very possible for once overlooked talent to show dramatic improvement at age 25 or 26. As a Warriors fan you should automatically agree to this after a year of Wiggins, but there’s also Julius Randle, Zach LaVine (he’s been balling for a while now but this year was undeniable), Christian Wood, Chris Boucher, Jerami Grant, etc."
He shouldn’t get a MAX no I’d do something similar to what Zach Lavine got from the bulls after his rookie contract he got 19 annual JC could have a start of 18-19 and have it increase season by season like most contract do but no if it where me I wouldn’t will he get the MAX? Probably
Anybody member when Zach Lavine dropped 50 on Atlanta earlier this year?    Yea. I member.
"I wanna see Booker just so I don't have to hear another shitty take about how a guy like Zach Lavine is better than him.  (No disrespect to Lavine, he's just not as good as Booker)"
Zach lavine-like
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
"I’ve said this before on other threads and got downvoted, but besides Zach Lavine there’s no real track history for someone tearing their ACL and coming back just as good/better, especially in their late 20s and beyond.  There are some successful cases in players in their teens/early 20s, but not many as his age. Also there are some successful cases in other sports, but not basketball.   I’m not trying to be doom n gloom, just realistic. He heavily relies on his athleticism and can’t shoot… outlook not bright in my opinion.   But at least he secured the bag"
"[https://www.nba.com/timberwolves/zach-lavine-surgery-update-0/](https://www.nba.com/timberwolves/zach-lavine-surgery-update-0/) lol you fucking mug  The fact is you started your first comment with ""if its a complete tear"" and the point is, a complete tear = surgery = recovery and your phrasing implies a partial tear is more likely to lead to full recovery, which isn't true.   Partial or full tears, either way ACLs don't have enough blood flow to heal on their own. ""Recovery"" from partial tears is just physio so you can rely on surrounding joints and muscle in lieu of a working ACL. *That* is where you see players failing to recover and getting reinjured."
Zach lavine dumbass
Yeah as can zach lavine
"I don’t know. Jabari didn’t look like he lost much athleticism after that first ACL tear, and KD and Zach Lavine proved that anything is possible."
"Lavine is a lot smaller, so he puts less weight on his knee than Giannis.  And also, after his injury Zach has  really worked om his shooting, which is a good way to not depend as much on athleticism."
Zach LaVine played another 6 or so minutes after tearing his ACL with the Wolves in  2017.
Zach lavine played 6 minutes with a torn acl.
"If it makes you feel better, ACL tears have become a lot less damaging recently, especially with young guys. Zach Lavine is probably the best example. The shittiest part of an ACL tear would be that the bucks would lose out on a chance this year and next year because of how late into the year this happened"
Zach Lavine has an extra ACL tho tbf he just lucky af
"Plenty of people have walked off the court, and several have actually kept playing after tearing their ACL.  Namely Zach Lavine and Rajon Rondo.  Him walking off unfortunately doesn't rule at a tear in the slightest."
Zach Lavine continued playing for several minutes after tearing his ACL
"Before anyone says, ""it cant be a tear because at least he can put weight on it/walk""  It is pretty common for patients to be able to put weight or walk with an ACL tear.  We've seen with athletes such as Carson Wentz and within basketball, Zach Lavine played 7 min iirc after he tore his ACL"
It's really just the 4 all stars and maybe Clarkson depending on how you see him vs Wiggins. All 6 are also the 6 with the most career points scored in the draft.  Highest career scorers of the 2014 draft  Wiggins 10263 (525 games)  Nikola Jokic 8360 (453 games)  Jordan Clarkson 7950 (521 games)  Zach LaVine 7831 (411 games)  Julius Randle 7744 (446 games)  Joel Embiid 6456 (250 games)
Zach Lavine was a first round pick based on nothing but projection. He did basically nothing at UCLA. You want your reasoning here it is.
"Bulls get:   * Andrew Wiggins  * James Wiseman   * 7, 14 picks this year   Warriors get:  * Nikola Vucevic   * Thad Young  The Warriors do it to go win now, swapping project players for established contributors. We re-sign Oubre in this scenario and run Steph/Klay/Oubre/Dray/Vucevic with Poole/Juan/Thad/Looney off the bench. Just need one more guard in free agency and we’re set to contend. Austin rivers with the MLE maybe?  The Bulls do it to rapidly build around Lavine. I think a team with Lavine/Vucevic as it’s core isn’t going to do anything, so they need to pivot to really take a step forward. The Warriors assets move them in that direction. Let’s say they sign and trade Markkanen for a PG, maybe Rubio. They can compete with Rubio/Zach/Wiggins/PatWil/Theis while developing Coby, Wiseman, and the 7th/14th picks"
I mean Zach lavine is on the roster damn
"He was one of the most efficient 20 PPG scorers in the NBA. The dude just turned 23 and put up almost 24 ppg on 50-40? 8 players have put up close to those numbers before the age of 25 while taking at least 2 threes per game. Kevin Durant, KAT, Kawhi, Reggie Miller, Zach Lavine, John Collins, Shai and Chris Webber. So yeah he's not a role player."
"He’s the one who tells them what to do and he’s the one that picked this garbage roster.   Jermari Grant, Zach LaVine, Draymond Green, JaVale McGee, and Keldon Johnson over Ja Morant, Trae Young, Julius Randle, Russell Westbrook, and Zion Williamson??? Oh yeah, big brain time for sure."
zach lavine open ...
"The world HAS improved and the NBA players don’t get the calls they used to. When you combine those two things, its tough.   On top of that, they are a thin team. I thought Jrue Holiday was our best player today. You know, the guy that got there YESTERDAY??  Also, the team sounds good when you say their names but when you watch em play- Tatum was shit today. Lillard wasnt good. Durant was in foul trouble and wasnt great.   That means youre depending on matchups like Zach LaVine vs Evan Fournier, which isnt THAT lopsided."
"It is has less to do with the quality of the Team USA stars and more to do with how good the rest of the world has gotten. Mostly as a result of the NBA players playing in the Olympics. This is what the NBA wanted when it starting sending players and is what made basketball a truly international story.   In 1992, there were 23 international players in the NBA. Think about that, it was less than one per team. Now there are something like 107, that is 4 times as many and nearly a quarter of the league (three of the top four MVP finalists where non-Americans). I can find the number from '92 for NBA players on other teams, but there are something like 65 present or former NBA guys on other teams. The guys range from MVP candidates (Doncic) to guy who couldn't get off the bench in the NBA (Vincent Poirier).   Now that the talent disparity isn't close to what it was in 1992, the issue that caught up with Team USA when it was college players are back. The rules are slightly different, but the international players are used to the Olympic rules. The refs are different and the FIBA refs don't give calls to stars the way the NBA refs do. The biggest difference however, and the thing that caused the college players lose in 1988, is that the other teams play a lot more games together over the course of the year. A team of All-stars who are not used to playing together, vs a team of NBA to borderline NBA players who are used to playing together is not a recipe for guaranteed success.  Watch the end of the France-USA game from today. France ran the basic play under the basic to get Batum and Fournier back-to-back open looks from the corner. Both times, team USA (I believe some combination of Adebayo and Lavine) screwed up switching on a screen and left a guy open. Three of the players just got to Tokyo.   Final note, I think Pop had a terrible game. How in the world when you need a stop is Zach LaVine on the court?"
NBA All-Stars?   Devin Booker  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Zach LaVine  JaVale McGee  Jrue Holiday  Bam Adebayo  Khris Middleton  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Draymond Green  Keldon Johnson  There are no better players in USA than these? Only one I even know is Kevin Durant.
"Lol word i dont know why they put zach lavine into the game. should've kept a lineup of dame, kd, tatum bam dray for maximal defense from tatum and bam and efficient scoring from dame and kd  kd cannot get into foul trouble anymore. best player has to be on the floor for this team, can't get 4 fouls in 10 mins"
Zach Lavine our best player? What?
"They need to be more aggressive. PERIOD. There are very few people in the NBA that can even really D up Zach LaVine and most of them are from the US...LaVine is like the 5th best scorer on this roster. They should be steamrolling teams offensively, there's really no excuse for it."
lots of ppl couldnt buy a basket and Zach Lavine was treated like he is Marcus Smart or Keith Bogans. Thats on Pop.
think khris midleton should play over lavine tbh he has that defensive ability while giving what zach gives offensively anyways
Well when all you do is shoot 3s and/or expect fouls called this is the result. Zach Lavine played way too much.
Zach lavine &gt; tatum. fight me.
Zach Lavine and Dame standing around while Jrue Holiday cuts up the D. Bizarre but acceptable
Most defense I’ve seen Zach Lavine play in my life 😂
Zach Lavine is on the court. That is all.
##FREE ZACH LAVINE
"They call Zach LaVine Zach LeVine on french TV and it's disturbing me a lot, like wtf"
"When Zach LaVine gets more shots, it'll be an indication of better ball movement b/c he's certainly not sniffing out his shot. He's playing team ball and he's lethal, but players aren't looking for him."
"Sure feels like it. Announcer mistakenly called Devin Booker ""Zach Lavine."""
Did they get Marvs international cousin commentating? Calling Booker Zach Lavine SMH
Zach lavine he reckons…
"Cade will become the player everyone expects him to be and the pistons will sign Zach Lavine in 2022 creating a big 3 of Cade, Jerami and Zach + solid vets and our rookies(Saddiq, Stew, Killian)  Mark my words, Pistons 2023 NBA champs"
Zach Lavine dunking on youtube
Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine (Jalen Green in the future that dude is cute as fuck)  Matisse Thybulle  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Serge Ibaka  Best defense in the league.. I'll take Kyrie off the bench for some insta offense he p cute
Zach lavine hitting 49 points and 13 threes and the cold blooded buzzer beater in charlotte in 2019
Lol she said Zach Lavine took the pic too 😂
Who Zach or KD? Kd has never been married. Looked it up and neither has Lavine.
Zach Lavine better have on Kevlar... cause he bouta be catching strays
I honestly think he'd be great in Chicago with Lavine. Would give them the defense they need and Zach doesn't always need to be on the ball either. Vucevic can shoot it and give space for him to get into the lane too. I just don't know what the Bulls would have that the Sixers would want back. I'm guessing they'd need a third team involved which may be true for any trade the Sixers make with him.
This is me when people compare jalen green to Zach Lavine.   I’m like “Nah I want YOU” towards Kobe comparisons
KG played with both Terry Porter and Zach Lavine  Also Vince Carter's ridiculously long career allowed him to play full seasons with both Hakeem and Trae Young
Zach Lavine. I though he was just a dunker and one of the many failures for the Wolves. Glad he grew up into an all star caliber player.
"I’m curious what happens with Chicago.  They only have three players under contract after this next season: Vucevic (22M), Patrick Williams (7.5M), Coby White (7.5M).  (Note: That might change if they resign Markannen or Thad this off-season) They can max Zach LaVine and still have money available, but they would essentially be paying more money for the same team they have now.   I’m sure they’re not anywhere close to trading Zach, but if the beginning of the season goes badly, I think they would have to seriously consider where they are headed as a franchise and consider trading LaVine and Vucevic for all the assets they can get."
Zach LaVine needing to bum off KD's phone just might end up being the best thing at these olympics if stuff like this keeps up.
The same people who think the Bulls would trade Zach Lavine
Bulls are dumb enough to spend max dollars on Zach fucking Lavine.
Cade  But sleeper pick Jaylen Brown/Zach Lavine👀
oh no KD is recruiting Zach Lavine
"Zach lavine made it to olympics team before KAT, 2017-18 season me would have never guessed that."
Zach Lavine going to put up 30/5/5 next season
Zach Lavine for Dinwiddie S&amp;T
"But they’d get cooked on the perimeter. Zach lavine isn’t a good defender, Aaron Gordon’s solid, Randle is eh, Jokic bad (don’t get me wrong I love Jokic but some harsh truths must be said), Embiid decent but would be more of a post defender"
Had to be an ego hit to Zach Lavine lol
You mean the time Vlade extended an offer sheet to Zach Lavine but didnt draft Luka because he would have taken the ball out of Deaaron's hands??? Man im still salty
Would love a front court player like Siakam or Aaron Gordon. Would not be surprised if Zach LaVine or Sabonis were part of Discussions. I think Siakam is the most likely acquisition
I freely admit I was skeptical at the time that you could build a contender around Zach and Gar Pax had not exactly earned the confidence of the fan base in their previous roster moves.  I thought the price was *ok* but was worried LaVine might be an empty calories scorer on bad teams but he worked his ass off an proved me wrong.
Zach Lavine needs Google Fi. I used when I was in Japan a couple of years ago &amp; it was clutch. Helped that the hotel gave me a hotspot as well.
"And? Point is, do we think Zach LaVine, the 7 year vet who is the centerpiece of his own franchise, is in need of being taken under the wing of a ""senior"" guy?"
"""Zach LaVine is rich, but the mf signing his check is *wealthy*"""
I think at the same  age he’s a much more polished than Lavine and had an even better first step coming into the league than Zach which is a testament to how insane of an athlete green is
"Zach Lavine grew up rich, I read his family's fridge was always stocked with red Gatorade"
It ain't like none of that. You know Zach Lavine didn't grow up poor right? In this clip the dude who was the most prepared out of the two (KD) was the one who grew up the poorest (watch his MVP speech)  It's just a matter of preparation. If you plan on going overseas and you plan on having a phone then look up and see how that's gonna work before you get over there  If anything that's the sign of someone who never grew up poor because he probably just thinks all of that shit should just work since it probably worked in most of the places he traveled too
"Zach Lavine grew up rich. His dad played in the NFL. Their family house is quite the compound, it had a basketball court in the backyard and batting cages."
"Of all the young guys, it seems to me like JT &amp; Lavine are already pretty polished. Zach needs to add defense to his game and JT I can’t really say what his weakness is, the guy is already All-NBA level.  Bam Adebayo is the guy who’s got the most room to grow for me. He needs to learn how to get buckets, point blank. No better place than Tokyo to learn that."
"Zach LaVine is 26, with 7 years experience in the league. Do we still consider him a younger guy? He's younger than KD, sure, but so is Jrue Holiday."
"I read this as Kevin Durant confirming that Billy Donavan was going to be playing some defense for them, but Zach LaVine wanted it to be surprise."
"Michael Jordan, Zach Lavine, Ray Allen, Stephon Marbury, Tyler Hansboro, Emeka Okafor, Mario Chalmers, Paul Pierce, Dwight Howard, Klay Thompson."
"**Players better than him:** Lebron, Kawhi, Giannis, KD, Curry, CP3, Booker, Mitchell, Jokic, Dame, Luka, Harden, Trae, PG13, AD, (healthy) Kyrie, Beal, Butler, Embiid, Tatum, Westbrook, KAT     **Players he is better than:** Jamal, Blake, Lowry, Porzingis, Tobias, Draymond, Collins, Van Vleet, Brooks, Simmons, Holiday, Randle, Wall, Oladipo, Sabonis, Vucevic, Shai, Lamelo Ball, etc. etc.     **Players he is more or less on the same level with:** Jaylen Brown, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Brandon Ingram, CJ McCollum, Ja Morant, Pascal Siakam, Deangelo Russell, Zach Lavine, Demar Derozan"
2k15 Zach Lavine was built different
"I wouldn't HATE taking on Love's contract to get Sexton, even if it would eat up a bunch of our cap for 2022. I feel like missing out on Sexton to try and gamble on free agents next year might not work out for us. And we could still get one big 2022 free agent potentially, like Zach LaVine.  Sexton - LaVine - Barrett - Randle - Mitchell Robinson is a great starting lineup  ??? - Quickley - ??? - Love - Noel (I pray) could be a great bench"
KD is going to come to Seattle in free agency with Zach Lavine and they’re going to bring a championship it’ll be his Lebron back to Cleveland moment.
Some people just really don’t follow sports at all. If I showed my sister a picture of Zach LaVine or Khalil Mack she would have no clue who they are.
"Zach don't want none of that loser vibe rubbing on him. I bet the moment he sees Devin approaching, he be lavine."
Zach LaVine

"Bobby portis gets a ring before Zach Lavine, Bobby&gt; Zach confirmed"
Time to relegate Booker back to the Zach Lavine star tier where he belongs.
Zach Lavine.
"3% above league average is not ""way more efficient"", it's just strong efficiency. Steph was nearly 12% above position average this year. Zach Lavine was 8% above position average. That is being way more efficient. And yes, being double teamed all the time is going to drag down his numbers, but that doesn't really bypass the fact that he has to have better ways of leveraging those situations than run into a difficult shot half of the time. He has to make up for strong but not elite efficiency with high volume to go to 30 ppg. Also, 34.9% from beyond the arc is nowhere near ""way more efficient"" either, just another thing to point out."
I mean it's not like we're tanking or something. Zach is by far the most untouchable asset we have. No point in tanking to try to get a guy who has a very low chance of being as good as LaVine currently is
Oh Zach lavine... you a spicy boi

"Sure, he drastically improved his playmaking though in 2016, what does zach lavine have to do with anything? Derozen was 5th in scoring in 2017     Lavine is barely even top 10   Luka, Dame, Curry, Embied, KD, Kyrie, Beal, Jokic all are averaging more and Giannis at 10 is only .1 ppg behind him."
"White men can’t jump. There are tons of examples, such as Zach Lavine, Aaron Gordon, Blake Griffin, and Tyler Johnson /s"
"Defense in the NBA nowadays is a complete joke, you know there's a problem when Zach Lavine is averaging 27ppg on Steph Curry efficiency."
"Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis   Damian Lillard, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo   Then honestly take your pick for the last two spots out of:  Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, Khris Middleton, Trae Young, Myles Turner, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, DeMar DeRozan, Zion Williamson... etc etc..."
"How is he so slow but so good. Him and Kyle Anderson make no sense to me.  Fun fact: Kyle Anderson was the starting PG in college over Zach Lavine, who was drafted many places above Kyle Anderson."
"That whole season was amazing. Curry going supernova in the regular season and the Warriors break MJ's 72-10 record. Kobe's final season, scoring 60 points in the final game. OKC taking down a 67 win Spurs team in the WCSF, warriors comeback against OKC in the WCF down 3-1, only to have the same thing done to them against the Cavs in the finals. On top of that, probably the greatest dunk contest in recent history between Aaron Gordon and Zach Lavine. 2016 was just a good year in general."
"among active players, those with most rs games ando yet zero playoffs experience are:  1. Alex Len, 484 games 2. Elfrid Payton, 413 3. Julius Randle, 401 4. Zach LaVine, 376 5. Wilie Cauley-Stein, 372  **6) Devin Booker, 361**"
"Right now, I think the ratio is about 1 all star to every 5 players in the dataset, so that would be an improvement.  If I filter further, I will definitely post more results.  &amp;#x200B;  I also thought about that, and if you check out my team vs the top 20 scorers, it's not really close. Notable top PPG guys who aren't in my all star list: Zach LaVine, Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Donovan Mitchell, Jerami Grant, CJ McCollum, Kyrie Irving. It selected a lot of people who are really valuable under advanced statistics but don't put up huge numbers instead."
Here are all the guys people will want to mention ranked in my opinion. Lot of these guys are really close to one another. Especially in the range of Holiday to Murray.  1. Stephen Curry 2. James Harden 3. Damian Lillard 4. Kyrie Irving 5. Bradley Beal 6. Chris Paul 7. Trae Young 8. Demar Derozan 9. Kyle Lowry 10. Donovan Mitchell 11. Devin Booker 12. CJ McCollum 13. Jrue Holiday 14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Ja Morant 16. Zach Lavine 17. Mike Conley 18. Jamal Murray 19. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 20. Fred Van Vleet 21. Malcolm Brogdon 22. Kemba Walker 23. Russell Westbrook 24. Collin Sexton 25. Marcus Smart
Zach Lavine pushes Joe Ingles off of him and makes a game winning shot in the finals
"Jaylen Brown &amp; Devin Booker are ahead of  several of the guys on your list so let's include them.  I'd also say SGA, CJ McCollum, Siakam, Kyrie, Gordon Hayward, Ingram and Middleton are all better.  Julius Randle &amp; Ben Simmons are probably where the line is, so that's another 8-11 guys at least (I am probably forgetting some).  It's interesting to name the guys, something we almost never do, as a result there are 12 top 5 players in the league at any given time.  EDIT: I forgot De'Aaron Fox, Ja Morant and Zach Lavine, would take them over Murray comfortably."
 &gt;Bulls trade Zach LaVine to the Pelicans for Lonzo Ball and two first-round picks  LMFAOOOOOOOO
"&gt;  the Nuggets should go all in. They control all of their first-round picks, so they could make a Brooklyn-esque type of offer  that's like...not true, they gave up a 2023 first for grant with protections that make 2025 untradeable too  &gt; Celtics send their unprotected first-round pick in 2021 to the Mavericks for Tim Hardaway Jr.  what the fuck  &gt; Bulls trade Zach LaVine to the Pelicans for Lonzo Ball and two first-round picks   is this article satire"
Ya because all us Bulls fans want the 10 pick over 25 year old 27ppg improving at everything Zach Lavine.   Any idiot that says he should be traded watches a couple highlights and repeats what national media says.    You know how many years it will take to draft and develop or trade for or sign a player of Lavine’s caliber in free agency?    Slightly less than infinity.
Zach Lavine on the Knicks would be hype af. The Garden having a great scorer once again would be great for the league. You guys are finally on the right path again either way though. I haven't watched a ton of Knicks games but they're fun to watch and Randle is a seriously good player now.

"I mean, he was an efficiency god, he was just a mediocre defender and sub par passer/rebounder. He would probably put up Zach Lavine numbers today"
Everything about him reminds me of Zach Lavine
I think Zach Lavine is going to find success in his career. He's now a consistent 30 PPG scorer at age 25. Idk we see flashes in younger guys but they don't sustain it like this guy. I think he just needs the right situation and he's a primary option on a perennial conference contender
Zach Lavine really just doesn’t pass in half court offense no matter what
"which time?? In the last 12 years they've had the up and coming spooky teams of:   * 2007-2009: Al Jefferson, Sebastian Telfair, Corey Brewer * 2010-2014: Kevin Love, Derrick Williams and Ricky Rubio * 2015-2019: Andrew Wiggins, KAT, Zach Lavine * 2020-Present: KAT, D'lo Russell, Anthony Edwards"
Exactly. So with Pat Bev and Lou together they could bring back around $26m in salary. How do you do that in a way that improves the team?  Victor Oladipo? Buddy Hield? Harrison Barnes? Malcolm Borgden? Zach Lavine?  It seems like only if Houston's cash-squeezed is there any reason to think a deal of one of those guys for Bev/Lou makes any sense for the other team.
"Zach is ninth in the entire league in PPG and 3PG.  I think a better answer for overrated is Coby White. You're asking Zach Lavine to do things out of his position by asking him to be more of a playmaker (he's up almost a full assist on the season). Steph Curry only averages around 6 assists assists a year. Zach obviously isn't Steph, but that just gives you an example of playing to a player's strengths. Zach is not a great defender (although he's not awful at 1-on-1 defense), but I think Coby White has been an even worse defender.  Coby has got little t-rex arms, gets turned around a lot, and disappears/makes boneheaded plays. He also seems to struggle to run the offense (causing Zach to have to do more). I don't hate Coby White and he's young, but with the way he's playing right now, he doesn't look like an NBA starting level PG. Maybe a good 6th man type."
&gt; Zach LaVine is a 27 PPG scorer on .645 TS% and people aren't sure if that's enough to be an Eastern Conference All Star.  Because of the Bulls record.  Not because of Zach in a vacuum.  If he was putting that up on a team that was like the 6th seed he would be an all star (unless he got squeezed out cause of other players)
maybe... the other day Zach Lavine put up 39 and it seemed normal/unnoteworthy. Too many 50+ point games by the other players.
Even doing it on elite efficiency isn't even much anymore. Zach LaVine is a 27 PPG scorer on .645 TS% and people aren't sure if that's enough to be an Eastern Conference All Star. Bradley Beal is a 33.2 PPG scorer on .586 TS% and his team has the worst record in the NBA.
"**Underrated Bulls Player: Thaddeus Young**  After underperforming last year, mostly due to bad coaching, 32-year-old Bulls veteran Thaddeus Young has a true shooting percentage of .601 this year. He's not being asked to spend all his time at the three point line, and instead getting in the middle of the floor and deciding whether to pop out for a shot or attack the basket based on the defense.   Young is also excellent at passing out of double teams.  He's a decent rebounder.  And Young is Chicago's best defender.    I'm not saying he's an All Star, but Young is a man of many talents, a veteran, and a glue guy who is in his happy place once again.  I think he's been overlooked, understandably because he's scoring 11 points per game on a bad team, and he's not even one of the young guns who fans hope to see develop.  But he's doing his job, and doing it well.  **Overrated Bulls Player: Zach LaVine**  Don't get me wrong, Zach LaVine is an All Star candidate for the Bulls, no question.  He's having his best season, and he's underpaid.  He's a scoring machine, even with all the defenses focused on stopping him.  He really is the Bulls' best overall player this year because of his fantastic scoring.    But LaVine still struggles to do anything but score.  People who say he's improved as a passer are ignoring his turnover rate. Yes, LaVine is making 5.3 assists per game, a career high.  But he's also turning over the ball 3.9 times a game, also a career high.  And that ratio of turnovers to assists is not good.  So yes, his scoring is better than ever, it's eye catching (27 points per game) and it's efficient, too (.645 TS%).  But LaVine still struggles as a passer, and he's still a below-average defender. LaVine is the Bulls' MVP, but the Bulls are not a good team, and LaVine is not quite as valuable as his scoring makes him look."

"Ceiling: conference finals  Floor: first round exit  Imo people are underrating them. They have 4 great 3 point shooters to space the floor for DeRozan.

Zach Lavine with the thru the legs dunk tho

SICK VICTORY DUNK FROM OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST ZACH LAVINE
The calming presence of Zach Lavine put kd at ease for those free throws
OLYMPIC LEGEND ZACH LAVINE TWISTING THE KNIFE
Zach Lavine lowkey been boss
$100 Zach Lavine goes for 69 this half and bangs Gobert’s mom after the game.
Zach Lavine looks lost
IDK if that's true even.  International play has Zach Lavine dominating dudes on defense like a 90s power forward.
Zach LaVine statement game for gold incoming
zach lavine will clear a body this game much live vince had done year 2000
So is our whole plan to shoot a bunch of 3's? Because my man Zach Lavine is pretty good at that. Put him in coach!
Olympic LEGEND Zach Lavine about to win the gold medal for us 😤
Zach Lavine is going to jump over Gobert from the free throw line tonight
Zach Lavine will be demanding a trade to the Los Angeles Lakers during the 21-22 NBA season.
"They decided to go all in on LaVines window. This is the cycle. Plenty of teams “mortgage their future” for less than a top 10 guy.  If they decide to blow it up and rebuild for the future, they will get first round picks by trading all these guys. Especially if Lonzo develops. He’s young. Maybe they eventually trade LaVine for a kings ransom and build around somebody else. For now, they’re doing whatever they can to win with Zach and I’m all about it. I think it makes sense."
"Let me get this straight....the Bulls have 6 39% 3 point shooters. Zach Lavine averaging 28/5/5 on 50/42/85, Vucevic who shoots 40% from 3 averaging 24/12, DeMar who averages 22/4/7...they added 2 great 3 and D perimeter players and they're going to be the 9th seed behind Hornets...? Fuck outta here."
He will be in the Zach Lavine trade package in Janurary.
"I think it would be more fun to just 3 players from the A Team rather than a B Team. We send our best swimmers to multiple events in the Olympics. Would've loved to see Kevin Durant, Zach LaVine, and Draymond Green this year, for example."
I want Zach Lavine to at least get some playoff games in.  If we go to 7 games in the first round I will be a happy camper
hey they had zach lavine too
Giannis Middleton Jrue KD Harden Kyrie Trae Lebron AD Butler Tatum Steph Klay? Randle Beal Lillard Embiid Kawhi PG CP3 Booker Jokic Derozan? Luka Zion Jaylen Brown? Sabonis? Fox? Adebayo? Ayton? Donovan Mitchell John Collins? Jamal Murray? Zach Lavine? Lowry?   That’s 25 guys if you don’t include any of the question marks. 36 including question marks that I’m not sure are better but are close at this point in his career.
**G:** DeJounte Murray   **G:** Trae Young   **F:** LaMelo Ball  **F:** Zach LaVine   **C:** Malcolm Brogdon   **Bench:** TJ McConnell / Jalen Brunson / DAngelo Russell / Jamal Murray / Cam Payne
"Volume stats don't tell the whole story lol. There's a reason we don't say Zach Lavine is a better scorer than KD, even though he averaged half a point more per game this year."
Zach Lavine came back from tearing his ACL and KD tore his Achilles. They still balling. Apparently Khris Middleton had a similar injury and he's a champion now
"Damn, Zach Lavine is pretty."
"What free agent class?  f Brooklyn's big three extends this off-season, Zach Lavine will be the only top tier free agent available and Chicago can offer more money, a better market and a comparable winning situation.  The next tier sucks. It's pretty much Aaron Gordon, TJ Warren, Jusuf Nurkic and Marcus Smart with Michael Porter Jr, Colin Sexton and Jaren Jackson Jr. as restricted free agents that would almost certainly get matched."
"Yes but it's going to be extremely hard to outvalue 7 solid players for $20 million.   For reference here's some guys who are making about $20 million:  Buddy Hield, Malcolm Brogdon, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jerami Grant, Julius Randle, FVV, Zach Lavine, Goran Dragic, Clint Capela, Bojan Bogdonovic, Domatas Sabonis, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe"
"I always consider a wing to be someone who plays the 2/3, meaning they’re on either wing. A forward is someone who plays the 3/4, so they might be on the wing or they might be on the block. Zach Lavine is a wing, KD is a forward. But that’s just how I’ve always thought about it"
"Wade, Luka, Jimmy and most recently, Zach LaVine.. he has a very smooth offensive game."
High on Valanciunas and Zach Lavine. Their efficiencies are hard to ignore and I believe JV is a main reason Memphis has been above board the past couple of seasons  Low on Lamelo Ball. I still think he is a brilliant player but he is not all star ready as people in here think.
OLYMPIC LEGEND ZACH LAVINE
High on Zach Lavine. Feel he got lot of criticism for not being on a winning team like Booker on my own Suns but hopefully the Bulls get a 3rd/4th seed and he has his own good playoff games worth remembering like Bookers 47 point game or 40 point triple double  Low on Michael Porter JR. I rate him but I really felt the takes of him being better than Murray were egregious and he hasnt really created his own shots off the dribble.  He was getting hunted by CP3 on defense everytime whenever we played the Nuggets and I really really dont get the KD comparisons. A fine third option once Murray is back though
This must have been made before the All-Star Game last year.  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/zach-lavine-career-win-percentage

"Wow, that’s all you need to know about Zach Lavine when you start listening to a Lavine stan on here. That’s so sad…"
Zach LaVine and Glue Holiday played some mega lockdown D on him
I've been a Zach Lavine Fan since 2014 and I can't fucking believe this stat. I'm dead bruh
Wow. So I get it about Zach LaVine now. Man is straight-up beautiful.
So Zach Lavine is not a good player?
"Absolutely insane stat. In his NBA career he's had only 9 3 game win streaks, 4 of which happened this past year. His best run has been winning 5 of 6, which I think he's only done 3 times so far.  He only has 131 wins in a 7 year career so far, 411 games. The last 3 years Zach has 55 30pt games and only 61 wins. He's only played on a team that has won 30 games twice, and each time it was 31.  For reference the 15-16 Warriors had 8  separate win streaks of 4 games or more and that's counting winning 24 in a row as one streak. From 14-16 GSW won 140 games, 9 more than Lavine in 247 less games.  Just a stunning combination of bad teams, bad luck, and a career that started kind of meh. But he's turned in to a legit player and I'd bet he has multiple 4 game runs this year."
"Zach Lavine, Shareef Abdul Rahim and Nikola Vucevic are probably all up there."
LaVine was pissed at him for screaming lol let the man have some fun Zach haha
Zach Lavine has some of the most incredible vertical pop I've ever seen. he floats through the airin a way that other dudes just don't
Really enjoyed those Zach Lavine dunks in the 4th quarter.  That is all.
"Australia just didn't have the athletes nor the depth to keep pace. If the US plays with the pace they did in the 2nd half, they can run anyone off the court. KD with the hard carry in the 1st half. Also, I love you Zach LaVine."
Zach Lavine early favorite for the Olympic dunk contest
"When Zach Lavine scores I say ""yes""  When Zach Lavine doesn't score I say nothing because Zach Lavine always scores"
"DBook, Zach LaVine, and KD had incredible games."
I'm always gonna love watching Zach LaVine catch a lob.  Beautiful
That's a weird looking Zach LaVine dunk
I still don’t know how does a human being jump like that and dunk the basketball like he does when I see Zach Lavine. It’s unnecessarily effortless
ZACH LAVINE!!!
Zach Lavine has underrated handsomeness
Zach Lavine DAMN SON
ZACH LAVINE
Zach dunkin lavine
Zach Lavine looking good on defense this whole Olympic run actually
#2022 MVP ZACH LAVINE
I want Australia to win but if we lose at the hands of Zach Lavine I'm ok with it.
"Our current depth chart:   PG: Lonzo Ball / Alex Caruso / Ayo Dosunmu   SG: Zach Lavine / Coby White / Javonte Green(?)  SF: DeMar DeRozan / Troy Brown Jr.   PF: Patrick Williams / Lauri Markannen(?)   C: Nikola Vucevic / Tony Bradley / Marko Simonovic   I doubt Lauri is on the team, hopefully he’s traded for some defensive bigs because we’re in a bad position if we don’t get any rim protection. Javonte Green is a nice bench piece and should be coming back on the QO."
zach lavine looking like the fourth best player on the Bulls right now
"I just don’t see how a team built around Zach Lavine can go past the second round, and I paid real money to watch that guy playing live numerous times."
"For real, it has to be tough to watch the Bulls breaking the bank for Zach Lavine and the Blazers can't be bothered to shake up a roster that clearly overachieved making the conference finals a few years ago."
"I agree about the dunking thing but how does “Booker can score from everywhere” make sense? So can Zach. Lavine is a better 3pt shooter by a big margin and is better at/around the rim. Lavine is quicker and and is a good midrange shooter. Both tough shot makers.   One point I’ll give to Booker is strength because if you watch Booker, you see he’s very strong and knows how to use his size to his advantage. He’d kill Lavine with his post moves.   So Lavine has more range, they’re pretty much equal mid range, and Lavine is better at getting to and finishing at the rim."
you still not gonna answer how Zach was in the playoffs???? im confused. you sure had a lot to say about booker in the playoffs (30 ppg on great efficiency btw) why are you so quiet about lavine?!?!
Zach lavine got traded to the bulls in 2017 and they haven't even sniffed the playoffs. Portland has been consistently making it every year.
Zach LaVine considering he’s the better player currently.
"Nothing says elite basketball like Zach Lavine, DeMar DeRozen and Lonzo Ball. Nobody in Chicago has even cared about the Bulls since Nate Robinson was option 1 in a playoff series against the Heat."
What has Zach LaVine?
"That’s shifting goal posts.   “We had one of the top 3 point shooting teams the season before and he still couldn't drive.”  So you didn’t have a top 3 shooting team the season before. Regardless of that, it was all J.J. Redick. He carried your team from the three point line. It was an anomaly.   Now if you want to say that J.J. Redick is anywhere close to Zach LaVine, then I have some land to sell you."
"lol believe me I want to!  I'd *love* for him to prove me wrong.  It's not like Bulls have 0 plus defenders.  Lonzo is excellent off the ball, Caruso is pretty good on &amp; off, Patrick Williams has room to grow into one of the best defenders in the Association, and Zach LaVine is slightly above average on D nowadays."
"The biggest winner is Zach LaVine. He's been improving year over year and just needed a franchise to believe that he was a number one guy.   Now he's coming back from an Olympic run where he has been featured heavily and will rejoin a Bulls team that has a wealth of talent. He has an older All Star he can learn from, a playmaking PG that he an grow with, a current All Star center and a young future All Star in P-Will.   Zach must be feeling pretty loved right now."
The theoretical fit with high usage guards is really  nice. He does all of the stuff that a guy like Zach Lavine doesn’t and can hit catch and shoot 3s
who under-delivered? The team that entered last year with a starting lineup of Coby White-Zach LaVine-Patrick Williams-Lauri Markkanen-Wendell Carter?
"Lonzo is such a good defender that Coby White averaged 27 points against us, Zach LaVine averaged 40 against us, De’Aaron Fox averaged a whopping 41 points against us over 3 games.   He cannot fight over a screen to save his life. He is good at attacking passing lanes but other than that he’s massively overrated and you’re about to find that out.  Good luck with the Lonzo stans though!"
The league ain't ready. The Bulls are about to make noise as a dangerous playoff team this year:  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * DeMar DeRozan * Lonzo Ball * Coby White * Patrick Williams * Alex Caruso * Troy Brown * Marko Simonovic * Ayo Dosunmu
"**Offensively, they are a superb fit.**   Zach doesn't need the ball in his hands to do his thing, and for a lot of last season he did not because the Bulls were desperately trying to make PG Coby White work (it did not). When it wasn't Coby, the ball was often in Thaddeus Young's hands to be a playmaker. There is a reason why Bulls fans were so desperate for a PG.  You have to actually watch Lonzo to realise this, but Lonzo isn't a great point guard. He has great vision, but his subpar handle makes him struggle to playmake in the half court and in pick and roll. DeMar can do all of that at a high level. I don't see why you think the offence would stagnate with the ball in DeMar's hands - he's not a scorer that passes sometimes, he's legitimately a good primary playmaker. Lavine is someone who fits in the former category and the ball is definitely better in DeMar's hands for a team offense.   Caruso will be backup PG alongside Coby White, letting him go back to his natural role as a scorer and end the terrible PG experiment. They fit well together. Is 8m or whatever Caruso got too much for a backup PG? Maybe, but that's what they needed with Sato gone.   * Lonzo will thrive when he doesn't have to be the primary playmaker, and he can act as an elite glue guy offensively.  * Lavine will thrive going from 0 playmaking around him to 3-4 playmakers in the starting unit, and the best spacing he's ever had. * DeMar with thrive with 4 shooters around him, giving him space to operate. * Patrick Williams is a guy who can fit anywhere on any team, but we will see how improved he is next season. * Vuc will play with guys who can really collapse a defense and draw attention away from him for the first time in his career. He won't be getting doubled in the post with the shooting around him.  4/5 guys are very efficient offensive players, and I feel like each one of their starters is going into the best situation of their career.  Their bench is a little dicey atm and we need to see what moves they have planned, but I think the Caruso/Coby back court is a great fit.  **Defensively, they will be bad**  Chicago had really poor defensive schemes last year. Vucevic was a neutral defender in Orlando, mostly because Clifford's excellent defensive schemes and our mostly decent perimeter defenders were able to limit situations that were bad for him (i.e. Vuc was rarely caught out in an island guarding a small). Wendell Carter Jr was called a horrible defender by Chicago fans pre-trade, but the situations flipped after the trade. Wendell seemed like a pretty solid defender, if a little small, and Vuc was seen as a horrible defender. The difference is not in the players, but that the schemes in Chicago basically sacrifice the big because their perimeter defense was so bad. Rudy Gobert would be a neutral defender at best on last years Bulls. Lonzo and Caruso were upgrades, but I think they need a new defensive coordinator or something because a couple of good but not great guys aren't gonna fix it. DeMar and Lavine are bad defenders too.  Also to your point about 1on1 defenders, you are right but I think Patrick Williams can be that lockdown guy. He was decent but not great on defense, but that's to be expected for rookies. He has the tools to be a monster on that end.  I expect the Bulls to have one of the best offences in the league, especially if they can shore up their bench (maybe via S&amp;T for Lauri). Their defense will be bad, worse if they keep doing what they were doing last year. We will see I suppose."
Zach Lavine
"&gt;directly into winning 40-50 games  They won 31 games in a 71 game season (would’ve won 35 in an 82 game season) with Lavine missing 11, him and Vuc only playing a handful and having no actual starting PG. The addition of Lonzo and a full season of Zach and Vuc together would win them 40 games alone. Then you add Derozan as a 3rd scoring option and a secondary playmaker to Lonzo, offensively they’re gonna be good. Defensively, unless Zach stays consistent, then they’re probably gonna be mediocre at best. They’re still gonna win more than 40 games."
"exactly man. fuck bottoming out. we've done it before. we acquired assets from bottoming out and kept the great ones (LaVine, P Will,) flipped the ones we didn't care for to put us in a better position to win (Vucevic) and now we're going fucking ham on free agency.  going into this free agency i speculated that, following the vuc trade, we're gonna find out how aggressive this FO really is this offseason. and we found out. it turns out they are EXTREMELY fucking aggressive. i'm personally all for it.   no better time to seize the opportunity than when zach lavine is approaching his prime."
And Zach Lavine
"zach lavine = one of the best scorers in the NBA  demar derozan = gives us some desperately needed playmaking and provides another wing who can relentlessly attack the basket   vucevic = big guy who scores from anywhere  like yeah derozan isn't going to help us much defensively but as i've said before, we have moves left to make and i'm not too worried about it for everything he's going to help us with offensively. these guys should play really nicely together"
In one year the cap goes up $5M and we get rid of Deng’s dead money. That’s $10M gained.  In two years both LeBron and Westbrook’s contracts expire and the cap goes up again. That’s almost $80M gained in cap space.  The Lakers are trying to retain maximum talent in 1-year windows. And I think it makes a ton of sense.   After the 2022-2023 season we build a bit more long-term by trying to find AD someone his age that’s a star and Westbrook and LeBron have the option of hanging on and retiring Lakers or LeBron can go play with his kid (if we don’t manage to draft him) / Westbrook can go chase money like Chris Paul and maybe land on another contender.  But my guess is there’s someone out there who’s want to play in L.A. with AD in their 30s. Maybe it’s Zach Lavine or maybe Tatum. NBA rosters and free agency destinations are harder to predict than champions.
Nick Madrigal is Zach LaVine? I'm down.
"You have a top level offensive shooting center, a pf with a good shot, and Zach fucking Lavine. Their spacing will be beyond fine"
"that’s 3 picks, one of which was the 8th pick, one of which is very likely gonna be a late first round pick and the one in 2025 which is rumored to be protected. we also have a young player with potential in pat williams and a young all star in zach lavine. care to explain now how exactly we have 0 future for the next 5+ years ?  &gt; garpax had us contending for a decade before blowing it up and bringing in lavine( a great move)   LMFAO we were serious contenders for like two years and even in those two years the heat were much better than us. GarPax made great moves such has handing out a massive contract to luol deng so we didn’t have the cap space to bring in wade, bron and bosh when they literally wanted to be here, trade the picks used to draft nurkic and harris for doug mcdermott and bring in wade and rondo when they were washed when we had prime jimmy butler to build around. oh and the only reason the butler trade even semi worked out for us is because the timberwolves were idiots and chose to move zach over wiggins - garpax wanted wiggins lmfao. they were one of the worst front offices in the league wasting away a mvp in rose and an all nba player in butler and if you are sitting here trying to defend them i can’t expect you to have an actual decent take on basketball"
"Honestly depends on how you define superstar. If Devin Booker is a superstar, so is Zach LaVine. If superstar means top five in the world, then obviously neither of them are current contenders."
"Lavine, Derozan, Coby White, Caruso, Lonzo  That's a loaded back-court. I guess Zach/Demar can play some small forward, but still. Will be interesting to see how it plays out."
"1. he was in the playoffs two years ago, in 2019. all playoff games are meaningful. 2. he is not one dimensional on offense he had 7 assists a game. that was 11th in the league. ~~On a 3.5 assist to turnover ratio, which was #1 among those 11 players~~ (EDIT: I should have said, 2.0 turnovers a game, which was lowest in the top 11 for assists.)  they are a large market they cannot just suck forever. their brand has been damaged by years of penny-pinching, including literally being so cheap they ruined perhaps the most iconic dynasty of all time.  getting to mediocrity is the first step to attracting free agents and rebuilding your brand. you could draft in the top ten for ten years and not get a player as good as zach lavine.  they committed to trying to win now with the vooch acquisition. a 2025 first round pick and a couple seconds to add DDR to fully commit to that strategy is nothing. if it doesn't work, yeah that's bad. but you can bounce back faster than you think. look at brooklyn (even before they got KD/Kyrie).  so no, you dont' have to be ""brain dead"" to disagree with this article."
"This right here. Plus people forget one huge thing about the DeRozen signing.  We didn’t have fucking anybody that can create their own shot outside of Lavine.   Maybe Coby can a little, but he’s got a long ways to go with his handles and efficiency. We at least know DeMar is a bucket. When the defense clamps down, he gives us another guy that can make a shot or get to the line. That’s huge for the team and takes a burden off Zach. It seemed like every damn night he had to go apeshit in the clutch just to keep the score close."
"Zach Lavine but with AKME, it's just a matter of when. Sure Chitown will be a contender in 2 or 3 years"
"Same but Giannis, which has made the last few years nice  Round out my list with Jokic and Zach LaVine"
"Even if that's true, they're getting uncomfortable because you're bringing it up... out of nowhere... with no good reason... and looking like a dumbass while doing it.  A bi racial guy can be ugly and have it not be because of his race it's okay bud lmao  Do you think people on this sub just think every bi racial player is ugly or something?  Do you see people talking about Ben Simmons?  Shall I name some more?  Blake Griffin, Steph Curry, The Ball brothers, Michael Porter Jr, Zach Lavine, if we go a little farther back Jason Kidd and Kris Humphries.  You see anyone saying they're goofy looking or ugly?"
The same could have been said about Zach Lavine after his ACL tear
"Also Bulls team looking real spooky this season. Zach Lavine with that ALL-NBA ceiling, 2x All Star-Orlando Magic franchise piece Big Vooch, and DeRozan being a walking bucket from mid-range...spooky stuff, didn't even mention Lonzo damn"
Trae young &gt; Zach lavine &gt; magic Johnson
"Not sure if it counts as he made his first all star last year but Zach Lavine now with squad and poised to make the playoffs will make the leap. Playoff Lavine will be a thing, dude is already considered a top talent but this year he’s going from great to amazing. For the next 2-3 years expect him to be in the top 5 mvp voting"
Zach Lavine
"I can't predict the future to tell you all the various moves that will be made between now and the first week of free agency next year. All I know is that the landscape is going to transform in drastic ways no one can imagine. People like you always make this same mistake every year where you guys say ""that will be impossible"" but then one or two things happen and in retrospect it looks obvious.   All I'm going to say is this: *if* Zach LaVine wants to get to the Lakers, he'll have absolutely zero problems making that happen. If there's one thing that should be readily apparent by now, it's that unrestricted free agents can get to the location they want to get to, one way or another. Hell, *signed players* can often get to where they want to go to if they're good enough! Stay in denial if you want to, but just think back on this exchange a year from now.   If LaVine makes it clear to the Bulls that he's not going to re-sign with them and puts it out there that he will only go to the Lakers, then Chicago might move him this year before the deadline. They could trade him straight up this year for THT, Kendrick Nunn and a first round pick. Acting like the cap mechanics to get it done is the stumbling block is silly. It's a question of what LaVine wants. For all we know he wants to stay in Chicago, who knows? But if his goal is to get to the Lakers, then that's where he's going to end up. Watch and see."
"&gt;The difference here (and player agents as a whole) is RP manages different players with different interests across different teams. RP is prominent because of Lebron.  I'm not sure how that makes Rich Paul different than any other agent. How many people without looking it up can tell you who Steph Curry's agent is? Why does everyone care so much about LeBron's agent?   &gt;I care because I love the league/basketball. Even if its Joe McNobody, as I said in the previous comments, IF THE ALLEGATIONS ARE PROVEN TO BE TRUE, it has pretty shitty implications with the agents.  I don't see how it has ""shitty implications with the agents"". I'm not even sure what that means, to be honest.    &gt;My main point is x agent (COULD LITERALLY BE ANYBODY) is not acting on the best interest of his client.   *If* that is true, then it's not the first time something like that has happened in sports or entertainment, nor will it be the last. It won't even be close to the worst stuff agents have done to their clients. Go look at what happened with Tim Duncan or Kareem or Britney Spears and you'll see this pales in comparison. People only know or care about this specific incident because they already know who Rich Paul is and because a lot of people want to see him taken down.   &gt;Once investigations start, who knows what the hell they find.   I think you should prepare yourself for something here: there almost surely will not be any kind of ""investigation"". There will probably be some out of court settlement between the parties with non disclosure agreements signed on both sides and we'll never know any of the specifics. That's part of why I am not too worked up about any of this.   &gt;Like jesus man, take a second to critically think what it boils down to (agent not acting in the best interest of a player) and realise that has league wide implications.  None of this has ""league wide implications"". Nobody is going to strip Rich Paul of his ability to be an agent, none of that. Maybe it ends up hurting Rich Paul's business because word among players spreads that he's not good at his job, but judging by this Zach LaVine news that doesn't seem to be happening. But if it did, so what? There's a line of agents waiting to take his place if he finds that nobody wants to hire him.   This is why, again, I don't care about what happens with Rich Paul and Nerlens Noel. It'll resolve itself one way or another and the league will roll on either way. This is just like if the league's most prominent accountant suddenly couldn't find business anymore, I wouldn't care about that either."
that first game we didn't have zach lavine
"Marcus Morris didn’t fire him, Rich Paul had to separate from him after he reneged on the San Antonio deal to go to the Knicks because of the optics. Zach Lavine just signed with him so your reality you made in your head isn’t real."
"LaVine was never taking an extension. It gets more money not extending.  We could've renegotiated this summer, but then we would've used our cap on Zach instead of all these new players.  The FO is already clearly building around him. He's gonna get as big of a contract as he can get next summer."
"i get what you're saying but these guys rn havent seen anyone as athletic, skilled, and tactical as mj since. thats a 100% guarantee.  if theyre giving up 20+ to zach lavine and they cant touch mj, he would lay waste to them.  they would have to wall off the paint like giannis and he was a mid range master who also mastered using screens and the low block.   theres just no way to stop him w/out deliberately fouling every play"
"I hope so. I'm from Chicago and still like the Bulls.  But to me it seems they've mortgaged their future without lifting their ceiling. All those moves, and their best player is still Zach LaVine."
Is he? Why hasnt he gotten an extension yet? And why is he making statements like this https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10009410-bulls-zach-lavine-i-outplayed-my-contract-i-just-want-my-respect ?
Zach Lavine just announced Klutch will be his new representation so it’s not stopping anytime soon.  What will probably happen is he’ll lose mid tier players and just be all in on the stars.  Which still is a great deal for Klutch
The worst agent that just had Zach Lavine leave and join him and the many other stars he represents? Clown
Cue Zach Lavine signing with Klutch... There is no justice in this world
"I see someone downvoted you for this, because clearly people around here hate this idea for some reason. I've seen the same weird thing with Kawhi and people saying he's only doing what Uncle Dennis tells him. Like no, these guys are grown men who have their own wants and desires and they tell their agents where they want to go.   I think a lot of people want to feel like the game was just fine before these agents came along, and they want to be able to still like the players, so they just dump all the blame for the choices they made that fans don't like onto someone else. Anthony Davis hired Rich Paul because he wanted to go to the Lakers and he hired the guy best qualified to get him there. If Zach LaVine does the same thing, that's because that's what he wants, not because LeBron or Rich Paul hypnotized him or are blackmailing him or whatever.   People need to take a closer look at exactly why they blame Rich Paul for whatever stuff that's gone on in the NBA that they don't like. He's not the Boogeyman, he's just an agent. He works for his clients, not the other way around. They can fire him if they don't like how he's representing them. None of us knows the conversations that are taking place between these agents and the players. It's quite frankly absurd that any of us act like we're privy to that information."
Anthony Davis won with Lebron. Completely laughable to think Zach Lavine of all players would be a lure for AD
"&gt;But you gotta admit, failing to act in the best interest of your players is a very shitty thing to do.  If that's actually what he did then sure. But none of us knows the truth there, there's just allegations. I didn't witness any of it so I have no clue how true any of it is. I'm guessing if it was that cut and dry then he wouldn't be apparently on the verge of signing another high profile player, but maybe I'm wrong. If he fucked up, he should pay him.   &gt;But we both know you are somehow working a deeper reason (I'll bet $5 I know what it is) despite the legit criticism he gets.  I know you think it's just cause I'm a Laker fan, but I promise you that's not it, or not in the way that you think it is, anyway. Honestly I just think all the criticism around here in recent days is insincere. I don't think people here hate Rich Paul cause of doing a poor job of representing Nerlens Noel, I think they hated him before this all came out. I think most people here are happy this happened because they want to see RP taken down, and that happiness has absolutely nothing to do with Noel. I don't think people here give a shit about Nerlens Noel, they just want reasons to hate Rich Paul.   I think a lot of people have hated him for a bunch of reasons which aren't the kinds of things that would upset me. Some people hate him because of his connection to LeBron and see hating him as an extension of hating LeBron. Some people hate him because they see him as helping the Lakers, and they hate the Lakers. Some people probably hate him because of his politics (again, more of an extension for why they hate LeBron). And unfortunately some people probably hate him because they don't like that a black man without a college degree is one of the most powerful agents in sports.   None of these things are upsetting to me, so I don't have the same motivations to hate him that a lot of other people do. That's probably why it seems like I'm ""defending"" him when really I'm just not joining in in attacking him. For me finding out that some player's agent may have made mistake while representing him has the same impact as if I'd found out that Noel's accountant had misfiled his taxes. That's not my business so I don't really give a shit. And that's why my reaction to everyone going crazy over this makes me want to just say that I wish people were honest about *why* they were so ""upset"" rather than this ""poor Noel"" concern trolling that's going on.   Finally, I'll just say that in regards to this thread, if Zach LaVine is going to hire Rich Paul because he wants to end up on the Lakers, that's not Rich Paul's fault or his doing. That's cause Zach LaVine wanted to do that. People tried to act like Anthony Davis wanted to stay in New Orleans until Rich Paul and LeBron lured him away, but we're talking about grown men making their own decisions, not young children being lured into a van with candy by sinister older men. If there's a problem with player movement or player empowerment, then it's nothing that Rich Paul created, nor will it go away if he does. Blaming him for all the perceived problems with how the business of the NBA works is silly, IMO."
still other type of endorsements rich paul has connections to that zach lavine probably wants in on
Zach LaVine about to make more money than Avril Lavigne
Alright looking forward to Zach Lavine signing with the Knicks for 4 years and 10 million total.
Zach Lavine conveniently joins Klutch and leaves his first agent right before a guaranteed payday and PR fallout for Klutch? I’ll bet this was cooking for months especially with the Zo to the Bulls connection. Rich Paul isn’t a stranger to tampering.
1. Zach Lavine will make All-NBA in years to come 2. The Chicago Bulls will win the NBA championship in 2023
He plays and moves nothing like Zach Lavine. He is pretty herky jerky. I see some Jamal Crawford with some Iverson swagger in his game.
"Those ""Zach Lavine says his dream teammate is LeBron"" articles from early last year are about to make a comeback"
"Zach Lavine, DJJ, Caruso on the same team? Idk how good the Bulls will be this year but they're going to be very fun to watch"
"steph, ja, lamelo, zach lavine, luka, zion, and giannis"
Zach Lavine about to win 5 games in a row.
So like Zach lavine
"Zach Lavine for sure, ceiling wise he can be better though."
"I watched a lot of Wolves games during the KAT/Lavine/Wiggs years and Lavine seemed to be the best shot creator/natural offensive talent out of all of them. (Yes, even KAT)   Flip was a genius for drafting him. He put him at backup PG for his entire rookie year and it drove the fanbase crazy but IMO Zach wouldn't be the player he is today without that experience running a team and learning how to control an offense."
People say Zach LaVine and I don’t see it through play style but potential production wise I get it.
"Luka, Curry, Hot Honey, Trae, BI, Zach Lavine"
"I've always thought Cleveland intentionally didn't grab a MCW, Oladipo, Zeller (some of the other top guys from that class) becuse they wanted to rebuild for another year and get a top player from the next class.   Such as Andrew Wiggins, Jabari Parker, Joel Embiid, Zach Lavine, Julius Randle, Aaron Gordon, Marcus Smart, Dante Exum etc.   I said it back then that the Cavs were trying to play a long game and have LeBron come back and try to coach up Kyrie and one of those guys since many of them are ""LeBron-Type"" players (Wing-fowards who can handle play post and guard multiple positions.)  They just so happened to get Bron back the next year and they drafted Andrew Wiggins, however they traded him away for Love almost immediately. But for a brief moment l felt like l was correct."
"Haven't you heard? Ben Simmons has limitless potential, he could be ANYTHING. He could even be a Zach Lavine!"
"Ja Morant Zach Lavigne Russell Westbrook.  Ja maront is ahead of his time Lavine plays like young Westbrook, without the shooting. Current Westbrook is absolute shite but his playmaking is elite, he is transitioning into moredern Derrick Rose Territory."
"I'm not saying he is explosive but man...of the newer gen players Zach Lavine is an underrated athlete. He is quick, jumps so effortlessly, literally looks like he glides through the air, and has an effortless looking jumpshot."
And Zach Lavine is the best SG in bulls history!
"Of the draft lottery picks only 3 have become All-Stars - 2 for the first time last season.  1. Andrew Wiggins   2. Jabari Parker   3. Joel Embiid   4. Aaron Gordon   5. Dante Exum   6. Marcus Smart   7. Julius Randle   8. Nik Stauskas   9. Noah Vonleh   10. Elfrid Payton   11. Doug McDermott   12. Dario Šarić   13. Zach LaVine   14. T. J. Warren  Of that lottery draft class who do you put above him? Obviously Embiid, LaVine, and Randle but thats pretty much it. Maybe a case could be made for Marcus Smart ... realistically I can't be consider him a bust if he is the 4th most successful player in the lottery."
"ideally-   a true lead playmaking point guard that can shoot. i.e Kyle Lowry   wings- one wing that can shot create and shoot, one wing that is a good catch and shoot threat on volume. i.e: Zach Lavine and Bojan Bogdanovic   center- kristaps porzingis or (if we’re trying to make the cap work) jaren jackson jr. dario saric or kelly olynyk off the bench.   that gives him ample spacing, competent defense and other guys that can shoulder on ball creation loads. don’t think that’s like a tile team but that team would “maximize” ben simmons.  they would struggle on the boards"
Guards and wings aren’t mutually exclusive.   Zach Lavine is a guard and a wing.   Cam Reddish is a guard and a wing  Anthony Edwards is a guard and a wing
"interesting facts i know:  lillard once outrebounded prime deandre jordan in a game  steve nash once fouled out in 6 minutes of playing time  zach lavine got his first 4 game winning streak with team usa since he was in ucla  prior to last season, trae young never had a 3 game winning streak at all. and he made the ecf last season"
Kobe was an inefficient chucker  All Shaq did was dunk on people  Zach Lavine is a slasher like WB  Saying any role player is trash and the reasoning being a hole in their game that if they had would make them a star player as if anyone who isn't a star is trash  John Stockton and Larry Bird were bad defenders  Saying a player with high mpg has a lot of stamina and can play the entire game meanwhile that player doesn't play defense half the time or sits on the 3 point line walking up and down the court for consecutive plays (think Bron or Harden)  Saying a complete one sided trade
Derrick Rose  Zach Lavine  Andrew Wiggins  Jimmy Butler  Kevin Love.    Nice little small ball lineup with 4 all stars and Wiggins
"Umm the East this year is deeper than the West was last year… Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson and Steven Adams just missed the play-in tournament in the West last year… why do we think Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso, Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan and Nikola Vucevic are a sure thing for the playoffs? They SHOULD be a sure thing for the play-in tournament, but anything beyond that is absolutely no sure thing."
I'm excited for you and for Zach Lavine.  This is the first time he's been surrounded by so much talent that wasn't located inside of a strip club.
"All it would take to be an absolute disaster is for Zach LaVine to sign elsewhere. They have literally traded every pick they can trade for this team, they are all in on this group. If LaVine leaves then they're totally screwed. The bad news is that even if he stays, Chicago is probably only about a 6th seed at best."
"Plenty of them like Jimmy Butler, Zach Lavine, Steph,  and, Harden have incredible work ethic  However nobody has matched Kobe or likely ever will. Only MJ"
"Easily Kwame Brown, though that Zach Lavine guy is pretty good too"
"Serena Williams is one the GOATs of tennis, but she doesn't even hold a candle competitively to make tennis stars. I'm not really a fan of her but I have a lot of respect for women who work their asses off to the top of their field. There are definitely female athletes who put in as much as it more than their peers, but anatomically and biologically, men are just stronger.  Deanna Nolan, a WNBA, has the highest vert in the WNBA, at 34 inches. Zach Lavine has a vert of 46. Zach Lavine, at 6'5"", is 7 inches taller than her. Shaq could jump to 32 at 7'1"". Dwight Howard has a vert of 40 and a height of 6'10"". As of now, we haven't any WNBA players with both the right height and vertical to consistently make dunks."
"The truth is if Lowry was talking to them at all and giving indicators that he had interest in the Pelicans, it was just because he needed them to create the leverage to make Toronto trade him to where he really wanted to go. Miami didn't have the cap space to just sign him outright without losing a bunch of key pieces, so Lowry had to make Toronto feel like he was leaving them one way or another: they could either trade him where he wanted and get something in return, or he'd go to New Orleans as a free agent and they'd get nothing.  That anonymous GM is right: David Griffin made moves (which included trading down in the draft and giving up a future 1st round pick) mainly so they could be big players in free agency. But instead all it got them is being used as leverage so Miami could get Lowry. Griff got played. Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine may try this same maneuver next summer to force a sign and trade to someplace they prefer to go to. I wonder if teams with no realistic shot at them will similarly get suckered into clearing out max cap space only to get left at the altar as a leverage play."
yup here you go  PG: Point Vucevic  SG: Zach LaVine  SF: Lonzo Ball  PF: PWill  C: Rudy Gobert  DeRozan 6th man
Off the top of my head these are guards that I can confidently say are more athletic/explosive at this point...  Zach Lavine  Donovan mitchell  Ja morant.     Am I missing more? I don’t think there are that many.
"Assuming no injuries and maintaining current trajectories, our next line up might look like:  -Trae Young/LaMelo/Fox -Donovan Mitchell/SGA/Zach LaVine -Jayson Tatum/Michael Porter/Brandon Ingram/Jaylen Brown -Anthony Davis/Zion Williamson -Bam/Jarret Allen/Christian wood  That's not a dream team but it's still all star loaded, and on paper with preparation should be a 5-10 pt favorite over every other matchup if not more."
Wiggins fans out here acting like he’s Ja Morrant or Zach Lavine levels of unimpeachable athleticism.
"He's played 25 games with D'lo these past 2 seasons, Zach Lavine only got good in Chicago and Wiggins was a horrible #2 and #3 in his time here.  This is revisionist history where you are trying you put down KAT simply because by every available metric he is a more efficient and better scorer. In his last healthy season he put up 26/11 on 64% TS while sharing the floor with Wiggins,Teague,Covington and Okogie. That is efficiency AD can only dream of."
"Let’s not act like Zach Lavine, DLo, and Wiggins, and Jimmy Butler were trash offensively. They drew their share of attention too. Sure, AD’s got Bron. Before that, Prime Boogie and to some degree, Jrue Holiday. I think the shot selection comes down to just the skill and the IQ of it. Don’t act like KAT was getting double and triple teamed all the time."
"Top 8 imo.. The biggest problems: Defense and sharing the ball. Defense: Vucevic: horrible defending.. Derozan: Absolutely no defending.. Lonzo: Individual defense is good even not elite but if team not defending well, he just concedes. Caruso: Good perimeter defender. Zach: not a good defender..  I expect them to be worst 5 or 10 defence in NBA tbh.  Sharing the ball: Zach LaVine wants to play with the ball, Lonzo too, Demar too.. Who will be the PG, who will handle the more more?  I believe Bulls just wasted all of their resources for bringing 5+ individually good players which will create a very bad and unharmonic team while playing together.. Also who pays Demar that much!?"
The Bulls have Zach LaVine
"I mean if it makes you feel better, the other name floating around on twitter/in celtics podcasts is Zach Lavine :)"
De’Aaron Fox  KAT  Zach Lavine   Rui  Garland too can’t forget him
"Oh then we agree, I shouldn't put Vucevic and Demar like they are the same : Vuc at least can fit with anybody.  Demar I just hate it, because he's really bad defensively. And yeah he's a better passer than Lavine so you can argue him having the ball with Zach off ball isn't a problem, but a Demar Derozan offense will always struggle in the playoffs, while I really think Lavine can still improve as a on ball guy, and if Demar declines it's an absolute disaster"
Zach lavine has is a better player than trae young and will show it this year when he has a good team around him
"I actually see this team being sort off a bubble Miami-esque team. Idk but it could definitely work. Zach Lavine was a straight up bucket last year and who knows, maybe with some actual talent surrounding him with an actual facilitator in Lonzo they might be able to cook something up"
"This is an interesting post, but I think going back 20 years is a BIT too far since the criteria in the 2000s was entirely different than the criteria in the 2010s. In the 2000s, the award generally favored guys that were drafted mid-late first round or in the 2nd round. Basically they were given to guys who weren't really expected to be good coming into the league but ended up breaking out. Players like Bobby Simmons, Aaron Brooks, Boris Diaw, etc all fit that bold - guys who were drafted outside of the lottery who had an amazing season for their standards.   If we're looking at the past 10 seasons, every winner for the award was either a first time all star/all NBA or played a very key role on a playoff team. The only winners that didn't make an all star team/all NBA the team were Ryan Anderson, CJ and Pascal Siakam.   Ryan Anderson was a typical 2000s MIP, 21st pick who reached a career high in scoring (at that time) and played a critical role in his team's success. However, if we were to pick the award based on today's criteria I'd wager that Andrew Bynum most likely would've gotten the nod over him. CJ despite being a lottery pick increased his PPG from 6 to 20, and Siakam went from a stiff to a 2nd option on a championship level team despite not making an all star team that year.   If I'm a betting man looking at next year's potential winner based on the pattern for the past decade, it's going to be someone that either makes their first all star/all NBA team or someone that plays a huge role on a playoff level team whose numbers improved tremendously.   Zion/Zach - I'm going to write these guys off because they're already too good, and have already made an all star team. I don't think we've ever had an all star level player get the MIP even if they made a jump to a MVP worthy season. Steph Curry didn't get it, Derrick Rose didn't get it, I don't see the case for Zion or Zach Lavine.   Shai - He's already putting up 24/5/6 on great efficiency, basically numbers that Brandon Ingram put up when he won it. He can obviously get better, but how much better can he even get at this point to get MIP? The opportunity is there, but it just feels so unlikely that he improves SO much from last season that he wins it IMO.   MPJ - Probably has the best odds to make it IMO. He has the talent and most importantly the opportunity with Jamal Murray out for most of the season. If he can take on more of the scoring load and put up around 25PPG on similar efficiency &amp; improve his defense while making the all star/all NBA team the award is as good as his.   I'm not going to bet on any of the sophomores, because historically you need to see a HUGE improvement to win MIP as a sophomore. Improvements from lottery picks like Edwards/Williams would be expected, and Bane would have to average 20PPG which I don't see happening given his role.   Guys like JJJ/Garland/other top 5 picks would really have to get their first all star selection in order to be in the conversation for MIP. I just don't really see it for those guys right now. Injuries aside, I just don't see JJJ make the all star team this upcoming season over Ja, and I DEFINITELY don't see the Grizzlies have more than one all star player.   I really like OG at those odds, he just fits the criteria the NBA is looking for in their MIPs IMO. The only things he really needs to be a good offensive player at this point are tighter handles which he has reportedly been working on all summer. It's really hard to judge the Raptors right now because their season in Tampa was so unorthodox, nobody knows how much playing away from Toronto has affected their player. If the Raptors look good before all star break and OG is putting up 20PPG + great defense, he could very well sneak into an all star game and end the season on an all defense team. +5000 odds I feel like this is a no brainer.  In regards to NAW, I love NAW but I just don't see opportunity for him to take a huge leap like that. The Pelicans already have two stars in Zion &amp; Ingram, how many minutes/shots are realistically going to be available for NAW? I guess not having Bledsoe/Lonzo on the team anymore helps his case, but we also have to consider that they also brought in JV who's going to command a LOT more touches than Adams. I feel like the minutes might be there, but the opportunity might not necessarily be there. But then again, his PER 36 stats do look good so at +3000 it's still pretty good.   Anyways, my picks for MIP so far is probably MPJ/OG/NAW."
"Then I'm crazy then. The competition in the 90s for the Eastern guard spots were weak af. Outside of Jordan all you had was Tim Hardaway, Joe Dumars and Penny Hardaway.   Reggie was an above average player who benefited from being on great teams. He would be the equivalent to Zach LaVine in terms of ranking today."
1. Steph Curry 2. Michael Jordan 3. Jimmy Butler 4. Zach Lavine 5. Draymond Green
I’m picking Mitchell since he showed some really incredible shit in the playoffs but Booker is close. Zach Lavine is also an honorable mansion.
"0. Steph Curry  1. Luka Doncic  2. Steve Nash  3. Klay Thompson  4. Ray Allen  Honorable Mentions: Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Zach Lavine, Kobe Bryant"
"That’s a fair argument from a “ranking” perspective I suppose but Zach doesn’t have the benefit of playing with a great supporting cast and the best defensive center in the NBA guaranteeing him a playoff berth every year to get those opportunities. Zach has been substantially more efficient than Mitchell with a worse supporting cast, I have a hard time thinking they wouldn’t be viewed differently if they switched places for the past couple seasons. Obviously I have some bias and it’s not like it means Mitchell isn’t a great young player himself, I’m just very high on LaVine. Hopefully we’ll get to see what he’s made of in the playoffs this year."
"If you’re team has to bench you at the end of a playoff game because you literally refuse to shoot the ball you’re not a top 25 nba player.   This list is not in an exact order, it’s just players who are better than Simmons.   Ben Simmons sucks  1. Lebron  2. Curry  3. Giannins  4. Kd  5. Jokic 6. Ad 7. Kawhi  8. Westbrook  9. Lilliard 10. Embiid 11. Luka  12. Harden 13. Kyrie  14. Tatum  15. Beal 16. Paul George  17. Trae young 18. Jaylen brown  19. Jamal murray 20. Devin booker 21. Chris paul 22. Kris Middleton  23. Jrue holiday  24. Zach lavine 25. Pascal siakam"
"As a Lavine stan, this feels high.   There’s so many talented dudes in the NBA. Like, how do you rank him against Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Jaylen Brown, etc? Cause those are guys all outside of the top 15 who play a similar position to Zach."
You make it seem like Jaylen Brown isnt a great offensive player though.  He was very strong as a scorer last year for Boston and his mid range shooting was really good.  Zach Lavine shot and made a bunch of tough three point shots off the dribble.  It's a lot closer than you think it is.
We blew y'all out once and the other games we won by 11 and 12 with one of them being a 50 PT Zach Lavine game although to be fair Lavine didn't play one game. Trae absolutely carved up your defense every time we played too though. It might not be the same outcome now that y'all got better but we were clearly the better team in every game we played.
I think I value the defense of Brown more than the playmaking of Lavine.  Lavine is a better scorer but he's also the first option.  We dont know about Jaylen Brown's scalability but as a second option I'd much rather have him than Zach as a first.
"I recommend you watch the nba lane commercial on the nba yt channel. You will get a good sense of all the players of impact the past 75 years since it's the nba 75th anniversary this season.   Then nba is going to have the ceremony on I think opening night this season to show you the greatest 75 players the past 75 years as well as the 10 coaches and 10 most important teams.   So your lucky makes your life easier lol. Now you know who's important by names, the coaches and teams. Now you go on yt and find out what they did.  Root for your favorite player that you feel influences your persona is the best way.   I like giannas, zach lavine, Ben simmons, Donovan Mitchell, and Michael Port Jr are my top 5 fav and kobe being my favorite of all time."
"Are the Bulls going to run line-ups of Lonzo Ball - Alex Caruso - Zach LaVine - DeMar DeRozan - Nikola Vucevic this season?  And if so, can we have all minutes of that lineup posted to this subreddit somehow? Because that lineup sounds like a blast."
I’m gonna go out on a limb and say either MPJ or Zach Lavine.
I don't understand how people still think Jaylen Brown is better that Zach Lavine
"Zach looked like a more talented scorer this past year.  He had virtually no help. Defenses could pretty much cater their schemes to Zach because no one was left to make them pay. And what did he do? Put up 27 PPG on 63% TS. In the few games I watched , he took some tough shots and made those tough shots. can score from anywhere really, like Kyrie   The guy can just get a bucket. Maybe it was a really hot year. But now he has help, and we’ll really get to see if LaVine can separate himself from the pack. excited for this year"
"Mine is that Zach LaVine deserved his first dunk title  What's your pick on Zach/Kyrie? I think I go Zach, but his performance this year will really form my opinion on the comparison of the two last year. I think both of them are pretty soundly ""1b's"" in the conversation of those four, though it feels weird to say they're ""definitely"" that close haha"
"They gonna prove it real soon.   With a great surrounding players, Zach Lavine is going to take the bulls to the next level. I feel like DeRozan will also contribute greatly and show that he's still got a lot of worth left in him and show his value. Lonzo already became a great 3 pt shooter in NOLA and he's going to show teams how great of an impact he can be. Caruso may not be a aggressive shooter type of player, but there's a reason many know him and I'm sure he's going to show the NBA why he got that bag."
"Currently, it’s Zach LaVine and Kyrie Irving. Obviously Kyrie has had a much better career. But if we’re basing it off their 2020-21 seasons, I think they’re remarkably close. LaVine, Booker, Mitchell, and Kyrie are all deserving of being considered the best SGs in the league IMO.  All-time, I would have to pick Timmy and Kobe. I’ve seen quite a few people on here put Duncan like 10 spots ahead of Kobe in their all-time rankings. I’ve also seen some people take Kobe over Duncan “easily,” whatever that means. I think it’s hilarious to have one ranked much higher than the other given they basically held hands and dominated an entire decade together, albeit in different ways. They are, personally, interchangeable at my 7th and 8th greatest-of-all-time spots.  Oh, also: Back in the day, me and my friends used to have arguments about Tim Hardaway and Kevin Johnson. They all loved Hardaway and thought he was miles ahead of KJ, and I would argue with them for hours. I personally preferred KJ, but not by a lot."
"Ok let's start this fun little debate then  Trae vs Zo - Okay maybe a tiny sample size, (literally one game) but Trae dropped 30 and 12 on Lonzo in their matchup during last season. I know it's a one game sample, but come on in reality the Bulls vs Hawks matchup is gonna be only 4 games per season anyways, one game vs four games is a big difference to compare two said players, but we have no choice. Also to think that you said that Zo creates better for his teammates. Are you being forreal right now? Just not in that train at all. Ain't really that geek on stats but Lonzo is like a one dimensional game by game player. What I mean by that is he is inconsistent in shooting the three. Month by month during last season: 29 percent - Jan 34 percent - Feb 46 percent - March 35 - April 34 - May And then next month surprised me a lot by how inconsistent he actually is He never really shoots the threes Trae does, yet it's just inconsistent as hell, especially with the gravity Zion and Ingram gives the Pelicans, all his threes should be like 70 percent open One game - 1-9 Next game - 7-13 Next game - 4-13 And then 4-11 And then just takes 2 three point attempts next game in his 34 minutes of playing time?!!?!?!? Like bruh, you act like Lonzo is an actual sharpshooter, in reality it was only for one month. Lonzo wins on defense, only an idiotic Hawks fan would argue there too be honest, although his height and wingspan help him a ton, i would still give him it but here's the thing. You act like basketball is a one on one sport, which could be (iso), but it's still 5 v 5, Trae ain't iso-ing everytime he faces against Lonzo ball. Capela is a hard hitting screener, Vucevic is weaker compared to Capela to say the least. Collins is a hard hitting screener, well PWill is a dawg as well I guess. But Hunter is imho a good screener actually, Derozan is getting older and older so his athleticism and speed will likely decline in the long run this season, but Trae got some big guys. Off the bench they are weaker going to Gallo, Gorgui, and K'von, but they are irrelevant to this tbh.  Besides if Trae doesn't score, as I said prior, it's a team game. So??? yeah Trae - Scoring Imho percentages are not the whole thing so Three point shooting - draw Lonzo - Defense Lonzo - Defense IQ Trae - Offensive IQ - give the slight edge to trae, usually ball's assists are just pick and roll passes to zion, or like a three from ingram, i wanna see him actually be a free point guard, to actually be the one setting the actual play Trae - playmaking (sorry lonzo) Trae - leadership Trae - clutch Trae - intangibles So Trae &gt; Lonzo I'm gonna keep this short for the next players now  Bogi vs Lavine It's not a question too be honest Bogi's three point shooting has gone another level this season shooting 44 percent, should be atleast 45-46 too be honest, but he played terrible with El Pee's game plan. His shots are easier I guess, but he's been hitting some step backs Really rarely see him playmake Might be a better defender than Zach So overall, I'm gonna give it to Lavine easily without a doubt  Hunter vs Derozan Hunter better defender by a mile too be honest, haven't watched Prime Derozan too be honest during his Raptor days, only times I've watched him is through the playoffs. Oh and by the way, his main flaw is choking in the playoffs plus couldn't get pass LBJ. Derozan's regular season runs are overrated as he just cannot survive in the playoffs His mid range shot is top 4 in the league behind paul ,kd, and kawhi, in no order. Hunter is a better three point shooter by a mile, at least he takes the three pointer unlike Derozan. Well maybe he'd change because of a different system but highly doubt it too be honest. But just because of veteran presence I'd give it Derozan, but maybe along the mid-season they could be equal tbh, and I could see Hunter pass Derozan during the next off-season  Collins vs PWill - Collins would eat PWill in the post, Collins rarely spots up from three now since we have reliable shooters in our squad, at least our 3rd best shooter ain't vince carter no more. PWill is a good perimeter defender, in fact an underrated one as well, should be in dpoy convos imho. But he ain't gonna win in the post vs collins down low, he has a sweet jab melo mid-range type game as well, and is really athletic, might see a poster as well, and you really think vucevic gonna bother a collins layup/dunk, highly doubt it. gonna give it to john the baptist  Capela vs Vucevic - Capela for defense by a mile so let's get that out of the way, Vucevic to offense by a mile as well, Capela a better rebounder, plus here's the thing for Capela as well, Vooch once had a 4-20 game i think against the bucks earlier, yes no lavine i know i think, but Capela's game is never inconsistent, since Vooch relies on offense he might have some stinker of games. Plus not that much playoff experience.  I'd actually give it to Capela.   1. Trae &gt; Lonzo  2. Zach &gt; Bogy  3. Derozan &gt; Hunter  4. Collins &gt; Williams  5. Capela &gt; Vooch  Now on to the bench  As of right now Lou Will is declining but gimme a combined LouWill and Delon Wright for Caruso. If one's not showing up then the other will be there. Besides wright and caruso is literally the same side of a coin, similar games, one's just older, and has more veteran presence. Gimme my point guard Shooting guards are k'von to coby white - i'd say it's a draw, just depends on who has an off-night, well actually coby gets more off nights but then again his scoring load will be lower now. gimme reddish over troy brown or djj, whoever the hell your sf's are gimme gallo over who the hell your pf is i'd even take gorgui dieng over tony bradley, moreover okongwu Easily deeper, solomon hill would probably play your backup pf minutes lol, hill easily gonna be a great veteran for us or play for injuries heck i didn't even mention our rookies lol. Plus if you wanna talk about shortening the rotation, that's just cowardness if you wanna compare teams. you'd shorten the rotation, that just proves my point that we're deeper lol  Besides as a hawks fan, i've watched trae play all the time but you cannot contain him imho. the only way to stop him is himself, a: shooting dumb threes b: overthinking and throwing interceptions c: his floater just not going in and it's not really because of the defender, but maybe that's just a homer take lol. And if you wanna talk  about scorers and willing passers - says the guy with having derrick jones jr as a backup 4 and tony bradley as  a backup 5 lol, easily you guys are gonna get fatigued  Scoring wise - by depth we win, i mean we had 11 players scoring double digits per game last season lol altho by true skill we cannot know that yet till the regular season lol Defense - Ball, Caruso, plus an injured PWill over hunter, Reddish, Capela, and even Delon, sheesh, gimme us lol Bulls are an inconsistent team, i could see them as the 5th seed or the 9th seed. So yeah, this is the paper  Edit: formatting"
step 1: be zach lavine  step 2: don't not be zach lavine
"Basically Zach LaVine built himself into an all-star with no coaching, mentors, or veteran support. He just keeps getting thrust into new conditions and improving in spite of the instability."
I’d like to be taught to be Zach Lavine
"Oh. No not really! Not any more than other teams do, I don't think. LaVine is the only one I can think of in my time watching the NBA. Wiggins found his role in GSW, but that role isn't what you needed out of him and it sure isn't superstardom. Jimmy was better in Chicago and you can make the case that he's more or less the same player before and after his time in Minnesota.  Zach LaVine would have been literally perfect for KAT, but you couldn't have known. At the time I wanted Wiggins from the trade."
"Twolves, Pacers, Bulls, Nuggets and Magic all have 5s who shoot.   Trades could be:  Twolves - Beasley + Russell + Pick   Pacers - Brogdon when he’s allowed to be traded  Bulls - idk I wish Zach Lavine was worse so it could happen   Nuggets - probably no deal here unless they wanna sell low on MPJ and the Sixers want 2 guys with injury problems   Magic - Jonathan Isaac and cole Anthony? Idk"
"lonzo skipped the combine so he has no official measurement for that. he would be a zach lavine type of high flyer if he had that type of vert lmao. do you think lonzo is anything like zach lavine going to the rim??????  and like ive said multiple times, the thread was talking about his inability to go strong to the rim. he could have a 50 inch vertical for all i care in practice or at his home. in game that has never translated to be true when hes going to the rim, so it is irrelevant.  meanwhile Lamelo has shown he can attack the rim with consistency and definitely has more hops when doing so in game"
"Zach Lavine is in a shooting slump rn and dealing with an injury to his left hand, but I’d def watch for him."
"That’s zach LaVine too, now we have 2 Steph currys with 40 inch verticals"

They only seem to have 1-2 rotational players that were drafted by them. Zach Lavine has only been on the Bulls one year longer than Lebron on the Lakers. As built by trades and signings as most other teams.
"GET MAD ZACH LAVINE, GET MAD! 😤  *Zach gets a tech*  Okay, not *that* mad, hold on now 😳"
I love seeing Zach lavine dunk
Announcer lol   GET MAD ZACH LAVINE  Whoawhoawhoa now don't get a technical
Zach “Kevin Durant” Lavine
This Zach Lavine guy is a pretty good dunker. They should get him into the Dunk Contest.
"I am not a basketball fan, honestly cannot tell you that I’ve watched a full game in the past 5 years. The only player that I follow is Zach LaVine. I caught a bunch of his older dunk videos and I, like everyone else, was blown away but what he could do.  Anyways it’s awesome seeing how far he’s made it and I’m rooting for whatever team he’s on."
"Idk, we sure a better title doesn’t get us better memes and get more Lavine dunks like this?  ‘Zach Lavine DESTROYS the rim with a CRISP 360 dunk, as he EXPLODES past defenders while they gaze HELPLESSLY DEFEATED; is this the end for KP in Dallas?’"
"Do you have to pay the cleaners extra to clean up cum? Because I am pretty sure the entire arena simultaneously came because of that sequence of events. Caruso Steal, Lonzo Full Court Pass, and a Zach Lavine 360 Dunk. The only thing missing from this is the camera panning to the 2nd round rookie you lot love so much"
"Nah man you got it wrong, at least with me. I loved Jimmy and I hold no ill will towards him for wanting out. I wish we would have kept LaVine and traded Wiggins instead, which is exactly what my gut was *screaming* at me when we made the trade. LaVine’s just got it, and Wiggins doesn’t. It was evident during their time with us.  Butler is a stud. Dude dragged us to our only playoff win without KG and I’ll always be grateful for that. I just miss Zach."
Zach LaVine is real cute
One Zach LaVine for one playoff win is not a trade I would make again
"I mean what else are they gonna do?   They've sucked, got lucky in the draft by getting the 1st pick, and still can't put together a top 10 seeded team:  \#1 Ant Edwards, #6 Jarret Culver, #12 Dario Saric, #5 Kris Dunn, #13 Zach LaVine, KAT #1, traded for Wiggins #1, Rubio #5, Wesley Johnson #4, Derrick Williams #2, Kevin Love #5   Out of all their lottery picks ones that have ""hit"" are Ant Edwards (likely), Lavine who they traded for Jimmy, KAT, and Love who they traded. Wiggins and Saric are also decent NBA players but they traded those guys too."
Zach LaVine is the best looking player in the league
Zach Lavine for Devin Booker
Donovan Mitchell and Zach Lavine and probably bare minimum like 5 other really good guards would like a word
"Yes and no.  There is absolutely room for an Iverson-sized player in the league dominating, but the *how* would be different as the game is different now. The year he won the MVP, he averaged 4 three point attempts, 21 two point attempts, and 10 free throw attempts per game.   He got the shit knocked out of his average American sized body. Many of the minors here on reddit are perfectly correct to point out that he was not an efficient player. Replace him on that team with a modern guy like, I dunno, Zach Lavine, and the Sixers win like 30 games.   Allen Iverson was fucking incredible."
"I always did perform DeMar slander when I saw people who just look at amount of points per game call him Toronto's leader, best player etc.   But now I am saying he really developed a lot in Spurs and now also seems to be in fantastic form. He's shooting crazy good for his standards, passing and making plays better every year, and even for some reason Bulls don't concede points so far when he plays. Hell, I have an impression that Zach LaVine might learn a bit from him and also develop into a winning player."
"&gt; top 25 player  In my perspective, a Top 25-30 player are players who are good enough to be the #1 option of any team so in my eyes a Top 30 player is someone more or less of a shooter. Think Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis etc. I don't think Dray scores enough to warrant him a Top 30 seal but okay.  Dray is in the 31-40 range coz he is a stellar 2nd most important player on the team guy."
"PPG Leaders:  Kevin Durant: 29.5 66% TS  Steph Curry: 27.6- 62% TS  Giannis: 27.3- 60% TS  Paul George: 27- 58% TS  DeMar DeRozan: 26.9- 60% TS  Zach Lavine: 26.2- 60% TS  Ja Morant: 26- 57% TS  Donovan Mitchell 25.8- 53% TS  Jaylen Brown: 25.6- 60% TS  Nikola Jokic: 25.6- 69% TS  &amp;#x200B;  He's the 3rd most efficient volume scorer by a good bit, and on the 2nd highest volume. What a gross misrepresentation. KD and Jokic on smth tho lmao."
"Models are built on assumptions, and they make a lot of bad assumptions. How is the number one player comparison for Steph Curry this year 2011 Chauncey Billups? They have Zach Lavine and Julius Randle as “average starters” and DeMar DeRozan as a “dubious starter” lol.       They keep building models on a flawed foundation. More data isn’t going to fix the models, you have to re-examine the underlying assumptions and methodology."
"&gt; Coby is just straight up better than Ross,  Bias talking   &gt; Coby won’t be our 9th man though, I feel like you’re underrating his value to this team as a scoring punch off the bench  Lonzo, Lavine, Demar, Vuc, Bradley, Caruso, DJJ, Green. That’s 8 players I’m more confident in.  &gt; he’s literally the only shot creator we have besides Zach and Demar.  And I’m saying he’s never proven himself to be a good shot creator, and you’re already all-in, you should leave your 2-3 allstar team i n the hands of a guy that hasn’t proven he can even score at a league average efficiency.  If I told you a random team that was 7-3 and a contender is relying on a 21 year old whose best year is scoring on 54% TS for a lottery team, you’d say that team should improve on them to increase your playoff odds.  If you were able to acquire someone like Jerami Grant or Harrison Barnes, and you went into the playoffs with a Lonzo-Lavine-Demar-Grant/Barnes-Vuc with Caruso/Green/Bradley rotating in and Lavine/Demar playing 40+ minutes staggered, that bench scoring punch you talk about becomes soooo much less important"
"Only semi relevant but anyone else feel like NBA journalism has gotten worse with more coverage?   Like I listen to Zach Lowe, Ringer, Bill Simmons, LockedOn, a lot really.    It feels like they’re all only watching mostly the same few teams every year (Although the teams change). A lot of their takes about the less watchable teams are always the same and you can kind of tell they’re not really watching them.    Like when the Bulls were dreadful I don’t blame anyone for not watching but you would see the same takes that weren’t really true anymore sometimes seemingly stuck in limbo just because no one was really paying attention to it.    Lavine being solid is a really good example. People act like he just jumped one year. Year after year he was at the top of most overrated players &amp; got trashed for the same stuff. No he’s been getting steadily better year after year having to carry horrible Bulls teams. I don’t blame you for not believing in Zach but some of the takes on specific parts of his game were just way off to the point it was like, I know you’re regurgitating that or not watching.     I know the Bulls aren’t alone in this its any of the unwatchable teams. I just wish these media companies had more of a “Not-as-watched teams” guy because listening to these podcasts it’s continually the “unfun” teams where you see their questionable takes/opinions."
Zach Lavine has a very handsome face.
"I just watched Zach lavine put up 32 on him. Show me these advanced stats dude, you act like Nate Silver has pronounced him the GOAT"
zach lavine is a bucket
Zach Lavine robbed but that was expected
"For real, a better question is like does FVV help his team more than Zach Lavine"
"Hes only 23 and has room to grow but yeah I think a duo of Lavine and Lonzo could be pretty deadly. Especially with Zach doing more on the defensive end they'd be strong on both sides of the court. Zo isn't being utilized very well in NOLA, so maybe something happens but hes a good shooter who can pass and play defense so idk why they would trade him."
Honestly its so weird because everyone is putting up MVP numbers. Zach Lavine is having a MVP season too just that his team isnt winning. Awards this season will eventually come down to narrative and popularity
"Nice! I especially liked the second half of the large comeback, the part when my favorite team was heavily outscoring their opponent.  Shout out to Jerami Grant (43 points) and Zach LaVine (37 points)"
The Pistons have been playing really aggressive basketball this year. This was the first team in a while to give it right back. I have a lot of respect for the Bulls after that big comeback. Zach looked fantastic. Of course the Pistons followed up their best half with the sloppiest quarter all year but that late fourth quarter battle between Lavine and Grant was some of the best Wednesday night entertainment you could have asked for.
"I love Jokic, I've been supporting him and the Nuggets since \~the 2017 season, but I feel like this shows how we shouldn't ever use ""empty stats"" again to describe a guy who is putting up both volume and efficiency.  If this were Zach LaVine or Bradley Beal a lot of yall would be yelling empty stats, but when Jokic has good games while catching a lot of Ls it's all praise and ""get this man some help""  Praise the Jokic, praise the LaVine, let's just be consistent"
"False Equivalency.  There's only 6 guard spots in All NBA selections if the offensive numbers are close to equal then defense has to be a deciding factor as well as win totals  the years WB made All NBA he was averaging 25+ pts, 8+ Reb and 8+ assists on teams that were the 6th seed and up  Kyrie has only made one 2nd team allnba and one 3rd, in 2015 he was third team all nba with similar stats to Lavine this year except he was on a 53 win team and his 2nd all nba placement was 2019 where he avgd 24/7/5 on a 49 win team  Again there are 6 guard spots in the All NBA  who of this list is Zach Lavine Replacing?  Steph Curry  Luka Doncic  Dame Lillard  James Harden  Lebron James (yes he's a guard now)  Donnovan Mitchell  Bradley Beal   I just listed 7 guards above Lavine just incase you wanted to die on the Lebron hill  that's not even arguing he should squeak in as the last spot on the 3rd team  the dude I responded to actually said 2ND TEAM ALL NBA as in he's a top 4 guard this year  explain it to me."
"Kukoc that year: 10/4/3 on 43/27/74 Started 8 games.  Kerr: 9 points on 50/40/90 Started 0 games. Took 7 shots a game  Longley: played 27 games total that year.  Less than 20 minutes a game. Gave you 8/5/2 on 52% true shooting as a center.   The reason why getting gasol is a bad comparison is because gasol is worth more than the sum of these players' parts that first season.   They lost Horace Grant, Paxson, Scott Williams, and BJ Armstrong that year.  You might make fun of Scott Williams, but in 93-94 he and Luc Longley had nearly identical numbers, and you called Luc Longley a key piece in replacing michael jordan earlier, so hopefully you grant me Scott Williams  In regards to the mvp argument, if Paul george carried on his dpoy level team and individual defense on 1-4 while averaging his numbers on his insane efficiency that year, then we would call him Kawhi Leonard. The only reason he doesn't have an argument similar to kawhi leonard for a top 3 spot is because he couldn't keep it going. That's not the fault of the mvp award, that's the fault of Paul george. If he had the exact same season for ten seasons straight he'd be consensus 3rd.  The reason why Scottie Pippen's mvp voting fell off is bc the team was gutted and they couldn't win in the mid 50s. If he had just kept Horace Grant the team would've won much more.  No one will read this far in my comment so I can give the super hot take that if Zach lavine was a good on ball defender this year he'd be no different than michael jordan   When Michael came back he had a worse PER than Scottie while taking a million shots on 43% efg.  27 points on 43% efg is like Monte Ellis numbers. It was worse true shooting than the Luc Longley I made fun of earlier, with worse offensive win shares than either of his years on the wizards, and worse defensive win shares than either year on the wizards. **you could literally put Jordan from the 2000s after retiring twice on this team and they still probably go 13-4.  If not, the stats would suggest they would do better.  This is not a testament to michael jordan, it is a testament to how depleted the team was, that even a slightly above average scorer could break the ceiling.** You can follow the logic here and blame HORACE GRANT for scottie only ranking 7th in mvp voting that year.   Either way, you can't defend Michael by saying ""he saved the team that had neRly a .500 record and made them a strong playoff team!"" But also hide behind ""of course he'd get knocked out first round! He was rusty!!! It's not a fair comparison!!!!""  Either he was washed that year or he carried a sinking ship, but you can't have both."
"Anyone who thinks he's an empty stat guy (Hi Bill Simmons) just isn't watching. I have no doubt at this point that he could make up a ""super friend"" group and internally rank them however you want (like Kyrie technically being a ""third option"" or Anthony Davis being a ""second option"" or whatever). But look at the Bulls.. who are the other ""super friend"" guys? Coby White has been ass. Patrick Williams is a rookie who has struggled... Thaddeus Young is a nice player but he's a 25 MPG role player.  The Bulls aren't a ""Zach LaVine just being better"" away from being a contender...  I'm not overly invested in LaVine since I'm about 85 % sure he will likely leave for a better team in free agency so he can be part of a super friend team, it's just amusing how consistently bad takes are on him. You don't score 28.8 PPG on .649 TS% (without even the benefit of superstar officiating) by being some empty stat guy. Any team would be lucky to ad him as a free agent in a couple years."
Coby white  Zach lavine  Patrick williams  Zion  Wendell Carter jr
Coby white Zach lavine Patrick williams Zion Wendell carter jr
"Bro I love Coby but he’s going to hopefully develop into a sixth man role. He’s really bad on the floor with Zach because he’s a poor man’s Zach. LaVine and Markannen as a one-two punch I feel, but I have way more confidence in Pat Will being a 15ppg+ guy on good efficiency than I do in Coby."
Zach Lavine already got out once. You're suggesting he's been on two teams who can't maximize his talent? Maybe he's just not as good as people think.

I grew up playing basketball with Zach Lavine
"Zach Lavine and KAT, get them out"
"You raise a good point about his shot selection, but the dude has good IQ and vision. He’s a willing passer and is making impact plays. Part of his inefficiency is the offensive scheme, part of it is shooting lots of 3’s where he isn’t at league average yet. But he runs to the rim and shoots open shots for the most part. Zach LaVine was far worse as a rookie with decision making. I don’t fear a JR Smith like result, I am thinking he’s on a Lavine development path."
Meanwhile Zach LaVine gets his neck literally gashed and only like 2 foul calls on 22 shots. Unbelievably shitty officiating these days
Trade Duncan Robinson and Nunn and a few first to get a guy like Zach Lavine. Add Rondae Hollis Jefferson since Jae crowder was a bigger void than expected.
"I wish both. I’ll give the nod to Zach 1) because I’m a homer and 2) because I see Grant in a similar spot as lavine last season (breakout season, but not quite enough to put him ahead of other worthy choices)"
Zach LaVine. ALL STAR
&gt;Imagine thinking Zach Lavine isn’t an All-Star  If you don’t watch the games it’s pretty easy to imagine. Still so many people think he’s putting up empty numbers.
"Imagine thinking Zach Lavine isn't an All-Star this year. Even if he's gotta be voted in by the coaches, how can his performances this year go unnoticed? Considering how competitive the Bulls have been against a large handful of teams this year.."
"Zach ""Diet Water"" LaVine"
Zach lavine for all star reserve
Zach Lavine better be an all-star
But can Zach Lavine be the 12th option on a contender?
"ZACH ""EMPTY CALORIES"" LAVINE JUST FORCED THIS TEAM TO THE WIN"
"zach ""dragging us to victory"" lavine"
they're gonna be saying the same thing about Zach LaVine in 20 years when it's all said and done
"If you still think Zach Lavine is just a ""good stats bad team guy"" then I'm embarrassed for you because you are stupid and you should feel bad"
Zach Lavine is tough but Jerami is going crazy
Zach Lavine vs Jerami Grant was the matchup I never knew I needed
good one. I was thinking Zach Lavine.
"Certainly not the best, but I think the 15-16 Wolves have a surprisingly good entry. Prime Andre Miller - Zach LaVine - Taysean Prince - KG - KAT. Could also replace Prince with prime Wiggins or Kevin Martin"
"1. Sign and trades are a thing, the players are usually notified beforehand. And most teams arent high on trading a player, so if they do its either because theyre a bad team fit (Al Horford, Josh Richardson) or the player themselves is disgruntled as has asked to be traded (Anthony Davis, KG, Ray Allen). And if a player has not asked to be traded, their careers are giving a better chance to succeed like we saw in the James Harden, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Lowry, Zach LaVine, etc. trades.   2. Rookie caps are (afaik) to protect teams ~~like the Timberwolves and Pistons~~ from making Joe Smith, Aaron Gordon, Harrison Barnes ass contracts. It sucks dick that players cant immediately choose their team, but as stated earlier they can demand a trade or even sit out games much like Jimmy Butler until they get traded or trades/signings are made to improve their team. I wouldnt mind if rookie caps are repealed, though. They are scaled depending on where in the draft you were taken, so theres that.   3. The fact players cant immediately cant choose their team is that it also gives small market teans (like the Cavaliers and Warriors) a chance to grow their status. If Lebron left Cleveland for somewhere like LA or Boston immediately on draft night the Cavs likely wouldnt be a franchise as of right now.  4. And I'm not entirely sure on this but I believe its possible to get a contract raise if youre already on a contract? I remember Dirk willingly taking pay cuts in order to improve his team but I'm not entirely sure on the other way around.   TL;DR theres a lot of ***nuance*** in these decisions made that make more sense if you look at them beyond face value."
"Trade any one of the mvp contenders to the Bulls for Zach Lavine, and then watch them not lead the team to a winning record.  So I sort of agree."
"&gt;A Zach Lavine to Raptors trade: Raptors sell everything they've got left  I'm sorry dude, but this is never happening lol. The Raptors core is perfectly fine and it doesn't make sense to give up everything for 1 player. The only guy we see moving is Lowry since his contract is coming up, but the Bulls wouldn't take an expiring vet for a young superstar."
"How is Lavine's team absolutely horrendous? We're the 9 seed at 11-15...  And Zach isn't a volume scorer, he's 51% FG and 43% 3pt while clearly being the only scoring threat for most of his minutes. I don't see the argument that his stats get much worse on a better team, maybe his overall numbers, but I'd guess that his percentages improve with less defensive attention, and his turnovers decrease if he's not forced to playmake. And being on a good defensive team makes your defense look much better, look at Booker once CP3 was added.  Mitchell's team is winning, but that's also largely in part due to Mike Conley re-emerging as a star, and of course Gobert's defensive presence. Spida has 3-4 players on his roster that would immediately be the 2nd best players with Beal or Lavine (Gobert, Conley, Bogdanovic)"
"Lavine is clearly better than Trae this year, and I know I sound like a homer.  Lavine is currently 4% FT out of the 40/50/90 club, leads the bulls in rebounds, near the team lead in assists, and 28ppg. Trae has a very respectable 26/9 i think, but is shooting like 42% from the field and 36% from 3, while lavine is shooting 51% and 43%. I believe Zach also leads the league in 4th Q scoring and had 2 gamewinners erased by Dame time and a Damien Lee 3pt  I haven't followed the hawks injuries, but my initial feel is that they have a better overall roster, considering the bulls second best consistent player has been like Thad Young.   Bulls are also tied with the hawks in record rn. Usually recent performance also factors into ASG, and Lavine is averaging around 31 ppg this month"
"&gt; Beal has never made the playoff without Wall (who has a better record than Beal) ......Trae doesnt fit your logic but ....""you've seen him play and in your OPINION, he is better???"" You haven't referenced any stats but winning stats and your logic is still inconsistent. hahaha  Ok, a few things. This is wasn't initially a Beal or Trae Vs. Lavine. It was discussing if ""Lavine is a winning player"" was a fair criticism. If you want to switch it to running down the numbers between Lavine and all those players go at it.   Anyways, I said argument that Lavine's numbers are bit inflated is fair because a) he hasn't been on a winning team b) the on/off numbers c) where he ranks in RPM, VORP, WS, WS/48, and BPM d) citing what I have seen in the games I've watched e) citing what other people who are paid to break down the game have seen. That's 5 points. One of those points on its own isn't worth much, but when you add it all together you have a case. You have literally just brought up his box score numbers and said he's better at defense from you've watched. I've explained why PPG/APG/RPG can be misleading.  I've explained using stats and eye test from myself and others. This isn't some baseless conclusion you want it to be.  &gt;no bro I'm a data scientist, that's why I'm annoyed with how very little factual data you use to form opinions and base those opinions as truths,  Cool job. And as an educator I'm annoyed by the lack understand and critical thinking on your end. Again, there are 5 things I used to form my opinion of Zach Lavine. You're using his per game stats. You then take those per game stats and form the opinion that's what makes him a good player. I'm taking those per game stats and using the other 5 points previously discussed to form the opinion that Lavine is a good player but isn't an all-NBA caliber at this time. All data needs context to make sense, but you know that already.   So maybe you're just trolling and I got sucked into it, but I don't think so."
If Zach lavine carried these bulls to a chip then he’s indisputably top 3. Argument for best in the league but against Lebron its a tough argument
"I just can't follow this logic man. He has had a slew of shit games, his team isn't winning. By this logic then Zach Lavine and Bradley Beal should be front runners for MVP as well."

"Players who are top 20 in both qualified PPG and TS%:  Steph Curry, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Zach LaVine. That’s it."
"My thinking would be that the absolute locks are:  1. Giannis 2. KD 3. Emiid 4. Tatum 5. Beal 6. Kyrie 7. Harden  I'm genuinely not convinced Harden deserves it, but we all know he's going to get in so I'll chalk him up as a lock.   Then I assume Zach LaVine, Trae Young and Jaylen Brown gets the nod so we're down to two spots left. Lots of competition for those two spots, and at the moment, that's only 1 player from each of the top two teams. Usually they find a way to shoe-horn in two players from the top teams. Middleton is easy, but 76ers is a tougher call.   It'll be interesting to see."
goddamn i love Zach LaVine  it's good to be a bulls fan again!
Most Heat fans have cooled off on Beal talk  Theyre focused on Zach Lavine now 😂
"Randle is currently 14th in the league in Win Shares, 23rd in BPM, 12th in VORP, and 10th in RAPTOR WAR.  He's putting up career high points, rebounds, and assists (22.4/11.1/5.6). He hasn't missed a game this season and leads the league in minutes played.  I think he should be considered a lock for the all-star team if you're looking at stats, both traditional and advanced. He has a stronger statistical argument than guys like Trae Young, Khris Middleton, Bradley Beal, Bam Adebayo, Kyrie Irving, Zach Lavine, Domantas Sabonis, and Ben Simmons.  You can make individual arguments here and there, Kyrie/Beal/Trae/Lavine's scoring numbers, Bam and Simmons' defense, playmaking, team record, etc. But take the overall package and compare Randle to each, and I think Randle deserves a spot more than most of those guys."
I know they are different positions but if Randle makes the all star game before Zach Lavine... That would be ridiculous. Lavine has been balling out for years now  But I am a huge fan of Randle
Call him Zach Lavine
"He’s having a great year, but the 2020-21 season is not comparable to anything. Everybody is shooting the lights out.  Zach Lavine is averaging 28 on 53/43/86! Paul George is averaging 25 on 51/48/91! Kyrie is averaging 28 on 54/44/87!  Turns out NBA players are insane shooters with no fans."
i would say everybody but dbook &amp; zach lavine and maybe cj mccollum. i wouldn’t trade him if i was jazz though cuz i feel like he’s a perfect fit for this team because they built around him for him.
saying Zach Lavine is having a better season is different than saying the jazz would get better if we traded him.
Zach Lavine was good last season too. At this point he belongs in that tier.
Zach Lavine is better than Randle lol
"Zach LaVine is averaging 28/5/5 on good shooting percentages. Kinda think he gets in over Goblin Hogwarts in the east, in spite of the Hornets winning two more games than the Bulls."
Where is Zach Lavine
Lavine. Middleton has the reigning MVP with him. I wake up everyday imagining how different lavine's game could be if he had another top 50 player with him. Our second best player is Thaddeus young. No disrespect I love Thad but Zach simply can't be snubbed because of his record if he doesn't have a good team in the first place
"I get your argument but comparing him to Zach Lavine is a bad comparison.  I'm not sure how much you watched him, but as a rookie, the game was slow for him. Never felt rushed and never truly looked like a rookie.   He's an efficient scorer with excellent vision and at times can be pretty crafty on defense. If he plays a long career I definitely think he can make 2 all-star games, especially playing in a market as large as Houston."
"No one can ""easily be a multi-time all-star.""  He's definitely talented but you have dudes like Zach Lavine-level talent who have never made an all-star game.  It's really hard to be a mult-time all star in the league and I'd be very surprised of KPJ becomes one."
"I think he's worthy, the question is: who are you kicking off this list?   Giannis  KD  Harden  Kyrie  Embiid  Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Trae Young  Bam  Beal  Khris Middleton  Zach Lavine   And that's without mentioning Gordon Hayward, Sabonis/Turner from Indy, FVV/Lowry/Siakam or Vucevic plus whoever else I am forgetting (and I am undoubtedly forgetting some good candidates).  All-Star is no joke this year in either conference."
"No it’s not, only the starters get a fan vote and now the fan vote is only 50% of the overall selection vote. Ja isn’t a starter, and coaches pick the reserves.  And let’s see: Giannis Embiid Beal KD Irving Tatum Jaylen Brown Sabonis Harden Randle Trae  Zach Lavine  Honorable mention: Middleton, Tobias Harris, Vucevic, Jerami Grant, Lowry, Sexton, Siakam, Simmons, Terry Rozier, Gordon Hayward, Brogdon  So right now, I’d say bam doesn’t make it"
He's that Zach Lavine/Donovan Mitchell/Anthony Edwards type of SG. Probably a top 5 pick in this draft.   Athletic high volume scorer who can shoot and slash.  Biggest questions will be defense and efficiency in the NBA.
"I don't understand the people who are exclusively fans of individual players. There was a recent post in /r/chicagobulls from a Zach Lavine fan (???) who thought the Bulls should trade him to a contender since they're ""not going anywhere""."
Coby white just isn’t a playmaker and Zach Lavine can’t do everything
I watch basketball religiously. I have literally no clue if Andre Drummond is now or has ever been good because he’s only ever played on bad teams and I’ve barely seen him play. Same with Zach LaVine.
"What would the All Empty Calorie Team be?  Clearly:  C - Drummond  PG - Westbrook  For the rest, how about:     SF - Andrew Wiggins  PF - John Collins  SG - Zach Lavine"
Zach Lavine is def better than Gordon Hayward lmao
"I agree this isn’t a high ceiling team, and to truly construct a team with championship aspirations,  the bulls probably should have tanked another year to hopefully draft superstar talent in high lottery.    As currently constructed, the best player on the team is a somewhat flawed scorer that will command close to the max.  I doubt a team with Zach lavine as it’s best player ever wins a title, and hopefully most bulls fans can see that.  But, Signing relevant players is a quantum leap for the bulls in FA.  No one has wanted to come here in ages.  This team can win 45-50 games and probably even get to the 2nd round.  For a bulls fan like me, that is enough.  In a few years, who knows?  Maybe the bulls can attract a top level talent, but at least the bulls are on the way to legitimacy again.  Yes, this roster doesn’t look like a title contender, but it looks like a team that can make some noise in the east.  It’s a win."
"Nikola Vucevic yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Zach LaVine gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Alex Caruso yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before DeRozan hit the locker room door, former NBA great Joakim Noah hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"

"Overpay… but im happy that ill watch a somewhat competent team playing basketball, rather than Zach Lavine carrying the team just to lose the game"
superstar? is zach lavine ever going to be top 5 or even top 10? that’s a ridiculous stretch he’s pretty close to his peak
"sure anything is possible, i guess it better than being bottomfeeders and completely wasting the talents of zach lavine."
"Friendly reminder to everyone we had Jimmy and Rose, then traded them both when we didn’t have to and the only player left from all that is Zach Lavine. (Lauri too, but he’s on extremely borrowed time)."
[Our city edition Jersey's from a couple years ago were blue.](https://shop.bulls.com/mens-nike-zach-lavine-blue-chicago-bulls-2019/20-finished-city-edition-swingman-jersey/p-36377330237977+z-9311-602535505) I don't think they make them any more though.  Also I'm bad at formatting so I apologize if that link doesn't work correctly.
Damn Bulls got Zach Lavine an ass load of help
"seems solid to me, easily a playoff team  should make lavine happy and getting these deals done first puts them in position to give zach a megadeal now that they have the rest of the squad locked down  bulls really came out like bandits in free agency this year"
"I can see the bulls flipping Lauri and Coby White for a big now too. Lotta guards on the roster   (Lonzo Ball, Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan, Alex Caruso, Coby White, Ayo Dosunmu, Devon Dotson)"
You have Luka but no team that fits in with him. They have people who would fit nicely with Luka but no star. One of Lukas nicknames is The Matador. I'm pretty sure Zach LaVine can jump over and even outrun a horse.   This all tells me you should go the SunKings route and merge teams. You'd be unstoppable!
Zach LaVine DeMar DeRozan Nikola Vucevic Lonzo Ball Alex Caruso   Damn
He also wore red and black for most of his games but nowadays players who do that top out around Zach Lavine level.
"LaVine is a top 25 player (top 5-10 scorer in the league) and he’s gonna go off this season with who we are adding. Zach isn’t fringe anything, he’s a star."
"Dame, Booker and Bam have been underwhelming in that starting lineup...it looks like they still havent adjusted to the Fiba rule differences and continue to hunt for fouls. KD is honestly singlehandedly keeping that starting line up in games, although Jrue has been awesome as well.   I think Pop needs to find more mins for Dray and Jayson Tatum...Dray has been so much better than Bam in every facet and Tatum has been the only other reliable scorer.. just not getting a ton of mins. Zach Lavine has also looked decent (albeit limited run compared to Booker)"
"He's not even a flop. He's a super talented young guard whose role on our team is questionable because we have Zach LaVine.  If he's down to forever play the 6th man role for us, I'm down to keep him. I consider that unlikely though because he's bound to continue to improve and want a bigger role than what he's going to get if he's sharing a roster with LaVine and Ball."
We got Zach lavine
The french Zach Lavine aka TLC
Get Zach Lavine or Derozan ffs
Zach Lavine is no longer the highest flyer in Chicago
Zach Lavine? Wiggins?
2 time Nba Dunk Champion Zach Lavine
Zach Lavine wouldn’t even be good in a top tier Euro league with the way he plays
LOL zach lavine just bricks open 3s.
Zach Lavine low-key better than Lillard
"Maybe a hot take, but Zach Lavine is not built for the Olympics lol"
Can someone tell me how Zach Lavine is above Jayson Tatum on the depth chart?
"Their perimeter defense is going to be stifling…wait I forgot they have Zach Lavine, take back what I just said."
"Lakers players always get shit on. And I like Lonzo next to dynamic players like Zion and Lavine.  Plus, he's gonna develop in his half court aspect most likely, and he's already a good fast break player and shooter. Those 2 are good fits for him seeing as he doesn't have to orchestrate the offense entirely, he can give the ball up to Zach and Vuc or BI and Zion and play a bit off ball. If the build play at a high pace Lonzo will be very good."
Zach LaVine
Dillon Brooks Julius Randle Zach LaVine Marcus Smart Christian Wood
"Play a bigger role in a backcourt w/ Zach Lavine, Lonzo Ball, &amp; Cody White? Unless they run a lot of 3 guard line ups, Carusos not getting more than 20 mpg, barring major injuries. MLE is about right for that kind of back up, but its the same role he had in LA."
DADDY ZO X ZACH LAVINE
"My fried brain read this as Zach Lavine, and then John Collins lol. I legitimately forgot Zach Collins existed."
Yeaaaaaaaaaah buddy! Shout out to Lonzo!!! From UCLA to a 4 year huge deal with the Bulls! Get to play with fellow Bruin Zach Lavine who I also got to watch play in college. I'm super happy for him!
bc he fits very very well next to Zach Lavine  at least imo but im biased
"These aren't robots. The assumption that Leonard will be 100% and ready to contend in 6 months is crazy.  &amp;#x200B;  Zach Lavine took 11 months.  &amp;#x200B;  Klay Thompson tore it during the finals and was by all reports ready to go after missing one season. That's more than a year (a whole NBA season plus 2 off-seasons).  &amp;#x200B;  Yes, there have been players who return after 6 months, but generally they struggle to get back to peak or even good performance, and who here thinks that Leonard will return early? He has shown throughout his career a reticence to play when he isn't 100%."
"Most common comps I've seen for him are Brad Beal and/or Zach LaVine.  Green's bigger than Monk, a better defender, ball handler, and passer, and not as good a shooter. I think Green's coming into the league more NBA ready than Monk was."
"That's cause almost all of the important player's contracts are still from before the cap spike. People compare 20M of a Zach Lavine $20M to Gary Harris $20M.  As the time passes and new contracts are signed with everybody else, the perception catches up."
Zach Lavine is on another planet compared to John Collins.
"There’s a lot of different things you could do for parity that the league doesn’t do currently.  One of the more interesting ones would be to remove the max contract.  There’s typically two kinds of players who get max contracts:  -	Obvious superstars like lebron who are clearly worth more than the max. In an open market, they would make significantly more. But this would also hamper their team construction. Right now you can get 3 max players but that’s about it. You’re seeing the Lakers having to look at filling out with vet minimums. But what if lebron had signed his LA deal for well above the max - which he easily could have commanded in his last free agency run? That would put a squeeze on their cap and options. Sure, he *could* take less, but players rarely do - which leads us into point 2 -	players who aren’t worth the max, but get paid like it in the hope that they turn into a max player or because the team can’t afford to lose them. Wiggins is the poster child here. Though this also applies to super max players in small markets (like Gobert). In this case, the mere presence of an upper-bound like a max or a super max is artificially setting the market price for these players. You’re hearing Zach lavine talk about how he wants to be shown “respect” with his contract negotiations. These sub-max players are still NBA players, many of which are all-star caliber. Of course they are going to think they are worth the max. But in an organic environment free of a max salary upper bound, the only real market barometers available are usually what other players have signed for (think about how the NFL works where you hear about a guy “resetting the market” for his position group).  (There’s a third group of guys that are basically worth right at that max level, but that’s not super relevant to the conversation).  So back to the first two buckets of players. The obvious superstars are providing significantly extra value against the cap than their contract would suggest. This is probably applicable to about the top dozen or so guys in the league. Your true tier 1 and tier 2 guys. After that, you have guys providing either at their value, or below their value because teams were basically forced into a max to keep them.   This is only going to exacerbate the top-heavy nature of the NBA because those top stars are providing extra value against the cap in addition to just simply being the best players on the floor. It’s easier to build around them. Perhaps, though, this is what the NBA wants. We know it loves to market it’s big stars, especially big stars in big markets. Perhaps they want things to be as too heavy as possible. Maybe they like it to be more predictable (if not the champion, at least who the likely contenders will be) rather than a league like the NFL which has a bit more parity."
I think he should take it even if he requests a trade because Zach on a max contract is still positive value so the Bulls would fetch a great return for a guy with 4 years of control in his prime.  Personally I would give the Bulls 10 first round picks and Dort for Lavine but I’m not sure other Thunder fans would be ready to agree.
Imagine if Zach Lavine is paired up with....
"Okay Kawhi, you wanna play with Zach Lavine and team? Okay then."
"People can't keep up with the inflating cap. To be fair, this is what we matched for Zach Lavine when he was RFA, and Zach was definitely better than Lonzo"
"zach lavine, booker, trae young, luka (ironically), tatum all looking incredulously at the ref for getting called with a flopping tech every single game."
"Shit, Zach LaVine probably close to making it"
