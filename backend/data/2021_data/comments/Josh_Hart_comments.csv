They might as well trade for Lonzo and Josh Hart if that's the case bolster up their defense. Don't  know how people in the sub take Perk's anaylst serious half the time though.

Josh Hart is the first player in history to pick his nose during the second quarter and get fouled exactly 5.3 seconds after that while the aliens in the galaxy Unga-Bunga are having lunch
"You know what's interesting. One of the other 9 guards was Bruce Brown who accomplished the same feat on Jan 13, 2021. You already have your josh hart!"
Josh Hart
I want a Josh Hart Jersey lmao
"Thank god we have our rebounding god, 6'5 SG Josh Hart."
"Man if only we had good individual defenders like Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, Brandon Ingram, or that Josh Hart! Maybe we could add in a great help defender like Steven Adams!  Then you know what we could do? Give them more than 18 games to judge whether or not its gonna work."
"RAPTOR has CJ 7th with Capela, ahead of Lebron, AD, Gobert, KD. It also has Jordan Clarkson and Fred VanVleet as the 15th and 16th most impactful players, above Steph and Beal. It also has Patty Mills ahead of Giannis, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, and Lillard. What an accurate statistic! Advanced stats are meaningless, just use your eyes and you can see Lebron is clearly the most impactful player in the league  edit: Not to mention Shake Milton, Delon Wright, Terry Rozier, Bobby Portis, and Monte Morris have a higher RAPTOR than Donovan Mitchell despite him playing with Conley like you said. Since RAPTOR is such a good stat, Utah's GM should have been fired yesterday for giving 82nd best player in the NBA a max contract when he's no better than Josh Hart."
"I mean I wasn’t trying to create the perfect team or anything lol. I was just interested in seeing how a team of good young talent featuring ofc my man josh hart might do. Chose Mikal bc Villanova and friends with Hart, Mitchell bc star young guard with two way potential, also friends with Josh lmao.   And then Bam and KAT because they’re two very highly regarded young big men with different skill sets"
"I think Mikal and BAM are great Defenders. Donovan is undersized and has always been a net negative Defender. He's got a high motor though so it's not like he doesn't try or never chains together some good defensive sequences. Josh Hart is okay or slightly above average for the most time, but yet another undersized position. With these guys I think defending the perimeter should work pretty well but Bam and KAT will have a lot trouble defending the rim together. If they play against a lineup with size they will be in big trouble.  I'll say that ""not a lot of defense"" was hyperbole though in retrospect. I think they even out to an overall average defense. Spread p'n'r, Drive and Kicks as well as having point forward-type player create at the elbow are staples in today's offenses and these are all things this lineup would struggle with when facing elite competition. Jokic would eat this squad, so would AD and LeBron, Embiid and Giannis would feast as well.  They're probably decently matched up against the Clippers but that's it out of the elite teams imo"
"lets look at it in order  * why the fuck would you put spida on the pg position? he’s score first priority   * mikal bridges and donovan, while good talents, its just bad synergy  * who tf puts josh hart @ sf? is it because of his rebounding?  * bam and kat, while good talents, its just bad synergy even if they should get along on paper (bam is a defensive playmaking big and kat is purely offensive elite stretch 5 big but no effort in defending)  to sum it all up, nice collection of talent but horrible synergy. A good coach and a good system could probably make this work"
"Weak Forward combination. Josh Hart is undersized SF, should be at PG. Bam is  low post threat but not a stretch 4"
"In a vacuum Dlo is a better player, but I would rather have Josh Hart at 3.5mil/yr than have to build around Dlo at 30mil/yr"
"Josh Hart. D'Lo is probably the better player in a vacuum   i don't see D'lo's role on a championship team really... like is he good enough to be my third guy? i don't think so.. and if he's my fourth guy, kinda diminishes what he can do because he won't have the ball as much..  with Hart atleast i see a guy who could be a good 5th starter"
"As a Grizzlies fan, I say josh hart we could use more wings anyway plus we’re set in terms of future pint guards"
"From a practical standpoint, Josh Hart all day as a value bench guy."
As a Lakers fan I think Josh Hart would fit better than D’lo. Why would you want the ball in D’lo’s hands when you have Lebron? Also a considerably worse defender than Schroder
D'lo. But if my team has 2 or 3 stars i would rather have Josh Hart.
Josh Hart for the missed high fives.
"Josh Hart for us, easily"
For the Jazz I think Josh Hart would be a better fit and on a better contract.
"&gt;Also just because Alex Len is taller than Harrell doesn't make him better or ""more of a center"".  Yeah, it actually does.  Josh Hart is one of the best rebounding guards in the whole league -- averaging almost 8 per game -- for example, but he's not a center because he just is not tall enough.  &gt;Len was waived for a reason.  Obviously this is true.  He was also picked up by Washington, who was very early in the waiver order, for a reason.  And he also posted 9/9 in half a game for them two days ago.  He was also once a #5 overall pick, so it's not like he's just some guy from a local Y.  The best coach that Len ever played more than 10 games for might be Luke Walton -- and while I like Walton as a coach, that's damning with pretty faint praise.  Of course he's a reclamation project, but that's about all the Lakers have the option to acquire, at the moment, so a probably-undercoached guy with physical tools is probably as high as their sights can be set.  A couple months ago, most people thought Harrell was an awful defender.  Turns out, he's at least competent -- with proper coaching, and matched up against players he can handle.  &gt;I'm pretty sure if we signed him you'd be complaining on threads about how shit he is too, just like you are with Harrell/Gasol right now.  It would behoove you to learn how to read.  I never said Gasol or Harrell are shit.  They both have played fairly well -- but one is not an NBA center, and the other can only play about 15 effective minutes a game, and only against some specific matchups.  Gasol is also 36 years old, and the list of guys his size who were not injury risks at that age, is very short.  What if Gasol, say, sprains an ankle, and loses another step once he recovers?  Who can he guard then?  He's already averaging just 4.4 rebounds, and more than twice as many turnovers as assists."
"Josh hart is a well above average defender and rebounder though. One of the best 6’5 and under rebounders we’ve seen, and capable of bodying up bigs in the post.   Also above average as a finisher in transition as well"
Players are just more stronger now. Arenas really put it into perspective for me when he mentioned pippen weighted like 220 as a SF during his era whereas now you see a guy like Josh hart weighing 225 as a 6’5 guard
I think Josh Hart may be a good pick for this. Single digit points and around league average percentages
&gt;	It’s probably because he’s playing with Adams  Josh Hart too. He’s averaging 7.5 rpg
Josh hart needs to take notes
Not my player. My player is josh hart
in the words of the great Kendrick Perkins 'trade kyrie for jj redick and josh hart'
"We play so much better when Bledsoe, Josh Hart, and Lonzo hit their shots."
"Lmao Josh Hart, washed Reddick and Lonzo for the NBA's leading scorer who says no?   Though I do think you guys could offer a good package with NAW, Kira, Hayes and a bunch of picks."
throw in maybe like Josh Hart or Redick into the trade and maybe.

And then someone (maybe Josh Hart?) was on the ground and reached out for help up and LeBron turned the other way that same season after the speech.

Gobert made sure Josh Hart and his posterity remember that block for a thousand years
Josh hart legit just won't pass to zion on the fastbreak?
Caruso is what Laker fans wanted Josh Hart to be.
Lonzo Josh Hart Melli Bledsoe and Hill for Jrue Holiday
I think they can have one of Bledsoe or Zo.  Having a really good defensive guard when your forwards suck on defense is a luxury.  But Adams didn't make sense when they traded for him and while the fit isn't awful it could be way better with a stretch big.  Also Josh Hart is right there as a pseudo 3 and d guard.
"Lonzo/Kira Lewis Jr, NAW/Josh Hart, Ingram/,  Zion/Melli, Adams/Hayes.  Once Bledsoe and JJ Reddick are sold to contenders, I want this team to pick up the pace, look at getting more of a floor spacing defensive Center (Myles Turner), and most importantly the point of this season and even next season is to stay healthy and grow together."
"Brandon and Zion need reliable shooters who can space the floor for them. Zion's grabbing 30 [in a crowded room](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsMjrnxXYAclbMn?format=jpg&amp;name=large), I think BI looks exhausted by late quarters after driving through like [four guys](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsJP2jfUwAQuGlx?format=jpg&amp;name=large) at a time all game.  People just don't see Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, or Eric Bledsoe as threats and they feel free to leave them unguarded and go crowd the #1 guys.  During the Lakers game, Schroder guarded the shit outta Nickeil Alexander-Walker though because he'd had a 37pt game against the Clips. I think Nickeil could be a good starter for us at SG if they let him get minutes.  BI and Zion are actually pretty good at creating looks for others, and our rookie PG seems pretty good at creating looks too. Just need dudes to stop bricking 'em."
"&gt;It's Griffin's first season with the team, give him a bit of time.  People are pissed about the shooting but I don't think they foresaw how bad the covid shooting slumps would be. Every single dude on the roster went cold as ice (even J.J. Reddick) and I'm not sure he could have quite foreseen that. I think he expected Josh Hart, Lonzo Ball, and Nicolo Melli to be above avg. on 3's and J.J. to be superb on shooting.  But now that it's happening we better get some damn shooters."
"Out of the three, Josh Hart was definitely one of them"
I mean defense isn’t something that usually drops much. Are you mad that we said Josh Hart was really good at rebounding and a pretty good 3Pter and that BI was an All Star and that Randle  had a lot of potential?  Cherry Picking Lonzo and his faults and lack of improvement is pretty fuckin petty when pretty much every Laker that has left has lived up to the expectations or even exceed them from their time on the Lakers.
"Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram Josh Hart, Lance Stephenson."
"Yeah, you can really see the difference when it's Josh Hart that has to make the rotation."
"LEBRON JAMES' ARRIVAL in July 2018 upended Ingram's role, as it did for every Laker. Ingram would play more off the ball. The Davis trade rumors overwhelmed the team starting in December. Ingram knew he would be part of any Davis deal. Even so, he averaged 18 points before the discovery of a blood clot in his right arm ended his season in March 2019.  ""The [trade rumors] were tough on him,"" said Josh Hart, Ingram's teammate in both L.A. and New Orleans. ""Before LeBron got there, he had been given the keys. And then people in L.A. were killing him: He's not as good anymore. He's not a great No 2. pick. The rumors became part of our lives, all year. Thank god I don't have to deal with that s--- anymore.""  Ingram and Stackhouse discussed how Ingram might fit in New Orleans months before the trade. When it happened, Stackhouse predicted Ingram would excel. ""You're in a place that fits you -- more similar to where you grew up,"" Stackhouse said. ""He was collateral damage, but in a good way. I was ecstatic.""  Ingram's father feels no resentment toward the Lakers, or regret about his son's path.  ""If we went back to draft day, I wouldn't have it any other way,"" Donald Ingram said. ""The L.A. experience helped him become a man.""  On Ingram's first day in New Orleans, Fred Vinson, an assistant with expertise in shooting mechanics, introduced himself and went right into a lecture. He said he knew Ingram was entering a contract year, and warned the organization would hold his poor shooting -- about 33% on 3s, 66% at the line -- against him. Vinson said he would be in the Pelicans' gym the next morning if Ingram wished to work.  Ingram showed up. Vinson told Ingram he was pointing his right foot inward upon his release, sapping power from his legs and throwing his body out of alignment -- another voice offering to repair Ingram's game. Vinson slapped tape onto the floor and would not let Ingram shoot unless his toes were straight across the tape. Vinson stood behind Ingram, reaching his arms up, warning Ingram not to bring the ball back so far as to hit him.  Ingram and the other young players then left for some summer time away from the team. He asked Vinson for notes and drills to do. Vinson emailed them.  When Ingram returned in September 2019, his jumper looked so good, Vinson pulled aside Trajan Langdon, the Pelicans' GM, and asked if Ingram had played some sort of trick on him, officials recalled.  On road trips, Ingram asked Vinson to arrange for a gym to be ready for him to shoot when the Pelicans landed. Ball started joining them. In 5-on-5 portions of practice, Ingram sometimes refuses to be subbed out. ""He'll tell me to f--- off and get someone else,"" Hart said.  Ingram tripled his 3-point attempts last season. He hit 39% from deep, and 85% at the line. Vinson wants more: at least seven 3s per game, and more pull-up 3s. Ingram is 12-of-33 on pull-up triples after making just 19 last season. If that becomes a reliable shot, there will be no foolproof scheme for Ingram on the pick-and-roll.  It would help to get Ingram the ball on the move so he is not operating from a standstill. That has been slow going, as Ingram and new teammates hammer out timing. ""He's still a slight player,"" Griffin said. ""If he gets the ball at a dead stop, it doesn't take a lot to keep him from getting momentum.""  Ingram has a nascent post game for use when smaller guys switch onto him, though he needs more force there, too. His defense has improved, in part because the Pelicans have him guarding wings instead of power forwards who can bulldoze him.  Two weeks ago, Stackhouse texted Ingram after one game and suggested he could get lower in his stance. Ingram replied that he agreed, even if he will always be more of an upright defender who makes up ground with length and speed. The Pelicans are on Ingram to stop peeking behind for oncoming screens, and to always find someone to box out.  Quiet by nature, Ingram is easing into a leadership role after showing deference to Jrue Holiday last season. Another 3-on-3 game with special rules required Ingram to shout the name of every teammate he passed to -- a method of bringing out his voice.  ""It helped me get comfortable,"" Ingram said.  Ingram is popular in the locker room, and coaches last season began using him as a conduit to deliver messages to Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Jaxson Hayes, and other young players. If they heard it from Ingram, it might carry more weight.  A more outgoing Ingram said he might one day accept more endorsements. His representatives wish he would. ""He's got a beautiful smile, but he's not about that stuff,"" Stackhouse said. ""He just wants to hoop.""  There is still a huge gap between the present and where Ingram thinks he and New Orleans can go one day. Other confidantes have heard Ingram state similarly lofty goals to the one he once told Redick. ""It's almost eerie to hear a kid say, 'I want to be the best ever,'"" Stackhouse said.  The Pelicans are 5-7, their roster a bit of a mish-mash. But Ingram's belief is unwavering.  ""I know,"" Ingram said, ""that we are building something special here."""
Josh Hart and Thomas Bryant as well.  Still probably just a low-tier playoff team at best really.
"despite you saying this, I'm pretty sure Josh hart actually busts his ass trying to get better at basketball all the time. lol"
"Maybe can we give Josh Hart some high 5s now.  [I mean, seriously ](https://youtu.be/SXzlZOFcOcE)"
"It's like that time David West realized he should retire b/c he couldn't move Josh Hart. Except Josh Hart is super strong, much stronger than he looks (guy's lower body strength is incredible). And Duncan Robinson is no Josh Hart in terms of strength."

I really like these Josh Hart at the 4 lineups

Its crazy how all the young lakers who have been traded in the past 4 years were constantly talked about on this sub. Now you only hear about like Ingram here and there if he has a big game. Lonzo used to have 3 posts on the front page about him a day. I havent seen a fucking Josh Hart posts since he got traded lol
How's Josh Hart doing? I liked him on the Lakers.
Lol Josh Hart
"It was based off salary. BI was number 2 pick, and got paid way more than Kuzma who was the 27th pick. There was no way the Lakers could have kept BI or Lonzo and had the cap space to go after Kawhi at the time. Only Kuzma or Josh Hart could have stayed on the Lakers."
"Pelican received Lonzo, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, the draft rights to De'andre Hunter and 3 unprotected first round picks. That's a decent haul considering AD refused to play and let it be known that he only wanted to go to the Lakers."
"Josh Hart is cute and thicc, I fap to him sometime"
&gt;Josh hart about to feast  On what? Zions fat drippings aka sweat?
Someone contact Josh Hart and tell him he just need 2 more assists and that'll help me out bigly.
My bois really doing great tonight  Brandon Ingram is unstoppable  Josh Hart is now a legit 3 and D guy  Lonzo
Was josh hart wearing the headband this whole time?
"Josh Hart MAYBE fouling a shooter, lol. Which is still no change. Dude never got the benefit of the doubt."
Josh Hart fouling a shooter. Some things never change
Josh hart has more jumpers made in this game than his last 4 months as a laker
Is Zion playing?  Josh hart about to feast
"Then why doesn't Ayton rebound like Drummond? Don't get me wrong, Ayton is a good rebounder. But Drummond gets 26.1% of all missed shots when he's on the court, Ayton gets 20.8%. The difference between Drummond and Ayton is the same as the difference between Ayton and Josh Hart. Drummond is that much better than any other non-shooting big."
"The Lakers fanbase keeps shitting on Kuz. But how many 27th picks get to play for the champs? Josh Hart was pick no. 30, Thomas Bryant 49th, Svi 47th. Lakers really drafted well."
"Also  &gt;The Lakers traded Lonzo, Ingram, Josh Hart, and multiple unprotected 1st rounders for AD and everyone loved the trade and instantly had the Lakers as a sure-thing for season champs.  Lmao no. The Clippers were heavy favorites. Everyone shat on the Lakers for overpaying for Day-to-Davis. And he was 5 years younger than Harden."
You keep saying winning one title at the cost of losing multiple titles like you have some sort of crystal ball and you know for a FACT the Lakers would have won multiple titles and that’s just not the case. If you can definitively prove to me that LA would have won multiple titles without the trade (which you can’t) then you’ll be correct.   I like Ingram I was hoping the Lakers would Keep him instead of Kuzma but he’s not going to be an all star and average 25 a game on the Lakers. I love Lonzo but he is injury prone Josh Hart is a regular player those draft picks are nothing right now. The Lakers pre AD were good enough to make the playoffs and are finals contenders because of LeBron and LeBron only. People didn’t think LeBron and AD would be the Clippers would you have been more confident with LeBron and Ingram?  Also please tell me what year LeBron won a title with less talent than what the Lakers would have been cus I wasn’t here for it  And your lottery analogy is not at all on par the lottery is 100% random luck and lottery tickets are what? 2 dollars? I don’t see how that compares at all here
"In other news, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, and Lonzo Ball are not suiting up for the Lakers tonight."
You mean Josh Hart being allowed to play 1 vs. 2 while BI gets triple-teamed can't win you games?
"Anthony Edwards, Kyrie, Caruso, Kawhi.  If there is a bench unit, Harden and Josh Hart have good onscreen chemistry."
"Jalen Brunson, Mikal Bridges, Donte Divincenzo, Josh Hart, Eric Paschall."
William Lou hosts a Raptors podcast with a guy named Josh Hart. It's very confusing.
Silver giving Josh Hart superstar treatment by banning high fives and fist bumps for everyone
The players will then do their best Josh Hart impressions. [context](https://youtu.be/xSFERudIy54)
This post made me make the same face Josh Hart made when Harden hit himself in the face with the ball
Josh Hart too
"This is why I love sports on Reddit.  When you least expect it, bam!  Suddenly there's a stat on how many times Josh Hart has high-fived himself."
*Josh Hart smiles*
"Pump the breaks. Josh Hart is in another league in terms of the missed high fives and fist bumps. Luka is obviously the better player, but Josh's commitment to the joke is truly exceptional. Man's fucking hilarious. He also adds a sad, disappointed face that really sells the bit."
"Clarkson, Nance, Zubac, Kuzma, Josh Hart, Thomas Bryant, Moe Wagner, Svi, THT, and picked up Caruso from the OKC Thunder G-League."
Josh Hart to LeBron: “First time?”
Luka and Josh Hart should be friends so they can ignore each other’s high fives and fist bumps.
The Josh Hart Phenomenon
someone in my stream chat just said 'Josh Hart looking like a biscuit'  what this mean?
"I understand that because I feel the same way about Josh Hart.  But reasonably, when you're at the Pelicans and Cavs level, you're still in the gathering assets phase and guys like that should never be entirely off the table if you can get guys or assets that will help you move closer to a deep playoff team or enable future moves."
"I'd recommend the Pels as one. Not just because they're the team I support.  Do you like big comebacks, well if you watch the Pels, you'll see it happen at least once a week as the team blows a 20+ point lead.  You like young players? Zion &amp; Ingram are right there.   You like ""funny"" players? Adams is a well-known one, but Josh ""6'5 Center"" Hart and Willy Hernangomez are both incredibly underrated on that front.   And they aren't contenders, but the team still has a chance to make the play-in, so the games do still matter."
Josh Hart is an elite role player
Josh Hart will be an important player on a contender one day. He can shoot the 3 but he guards and he rebounds like crazy for his size
Mabye if it's Lonzo + Josh Hart....Just tossing out ideas.
"I think the SVG hiring was a bad move and the roster construction is very poor. Zion today had 14 in the first quarter when no one on the pels could make a shot to save their lives. He drew 6 fouls in that time as well. Then for the next 2 quarters he has 2FGA. It's absolutely absurd. Then they start giving him the ball in the 4th and pels cut our lead from 17 to 2 with the help of Jaxson Hayes and josh hart.    If he has the right team around him, he can be easily be a 28/10 guy given his efficiency. Defensively he's often caught ball watching but he's hasn't even completed a full regular season yet. I think under a competent coach and on a roster built to neutralize his weaknesses, I would pick zion.   Nothing against Tatum but I believe Zion has the potential to become a superstar"
"honestly your team - Danny Green + a late 1st. But I love Josh Hart and would love to plug him into the Sixers starting lineup at the 3, and would trade a late 1st for him straight up even without the other two. Also, even though JJ looks washed this year if you're gonna have a shooter off the bench I'd still rather it be JJ than Green. Also some sentimentality with JJ if I'm being honest."
Josh hart and Redick
Why josh hart sound like Patrick mahomes
Dem fortnite Josh hart fans be wild
The cut to Harden storming off to the locker room after getting the full Josh Hart reaction makes it even funnier. Peak Shaqtin’ moment.
I’m not going to argue with you about this but Nicolo Melli and Jaxson Hayes are not better defenders than Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart...
I just realized Josh Hart kinda looks like Murray
Butler is averaging 20/8/8 and I feel like that's pretty reflective of his impact lol  G: Conley  G: Mikal Bridges  F: Josh Hart  F: Draymond Green  C: Rudy Gobert
My favorite reaction is Josh hart when harden slammed the ball into his own face.
I don't wanna break up the band. I hope he and Josh Hart stay.
"The power to fire a coach of a franchise lies entirely on the owner. No player in the league has that power. Do they possess the power of influence? Perhaps, but that's a case by case basis. Josh Hart can't influence a coach to be fired as much as an Anthony Davis. But that's not because their judgement should be trusted more. It's because they ultimately feel that the star player asset brings in more money than the coaching asset."
Everyone’s always casually forgetting about Josh Hart lol
"I love how agressive he is being, I just hope by the end of the year he will take a more LeBron approach; get your guys involved first and turn it on when they start to slump. After watching the NOL/UTH I really liked how Zion was crushing in the post, late in the fourth to give that energy to the other guys, which got them going, like Josh Hart. This may be me but I feel like Danny and Seth are suffering more now because Ben has been scoring first. This is just how I feel after watching Ben after the UTH game to now. I think once he find balance he will unlock another level , then its over for you suckheads."
"You know I have always been a Gary Harris stan, not so much Thrill. They just can't stay healthy. I would love to see what Josh Hart would do with us though. I think he would be a perfect fit. We have to move on from one of Harris or Barton."
"I'm wondering what the extension deal looked like with the Pelicans. I think they're being very paranoid/careful about who they pay and who they put around Zion. Which, I kind of get. But I'll be sad if we can't keep Josh Hart because of it. Really felt like we could have extended him early too."
"I mean, hasn’t that been normal? Outside of JOSH HART and Willy and JJ we don’t really have a bench"
"It starts with Steven Adams who is not a good defender either in PnR or at protecting the rim.  Teams are shooting 68% in the restricted area against the Pelicans which is 2nd only to the Nuggets this year (70%).  Adams gives up 1.42 points per poss in PnR which is the worst mark among all players that have defended &gt; 20 PnR possessions this season.  SVG doesnt even trust him to finish games anymore bcuz he knows teams target him on PnR or switches, instead they go small by inserting Josh Hart in and playing Zion at the 5.  They need a long-term starting center, which is probably a problem bcuz they've already committed $65 million to Adams through 2023."
I think 4/80 for a small market team is not that nuts compared to bigger markets. I don't think we can keep him and Josh Hart both though and that makes me sad.
Josh Hart was involved in that too!
You can tell he's a real real nephew because he said Josh Hart is the Pelicans best defender
I would die for Josh Hart you hear me
Thanasis bit on that Josh Hart pump fake like Zion bites into food
God I hope josh hart becomes an Allstar
May Josh Hart guide Giannis on his quest
You want Adams or Hernangomez guarding him on the perimeter? Josh Hart is still tough
I LOVE JOSH HUSTLE HARD HART
"Zion, BI, Ball, Adams is a great first 4.   Our weak link is that Josh Hart isnt consistent enough to be the 5th over Bledsoe, and Bledsoe is terrible. We need a solid 3 &amp; D SG/SF and this is a line up that can be a 3-5 seed. I mean, we've already lost 5 games on the last few possessions, after being up big in the 4th, where a reliable 3&amp;D might have saved us, giving us a 19-12 record."
"Literally couldnt play any guards last week lol  Lost Jrue and Dejounte Murray to covid protocols, Simmons was a GTD to OUT for a bunch of games, picked up TJ McConnell and the Pacers immediately were PPD'd along w me losing Sabonis.   I had less than a handful of games from Powell and late week acquisition starts from Jingles and Josh Hart against the guy in 1st (im 2nd)"
"If it weren't for Josh Hart in the underrated category, Lonzo Ball would somehow be both the most overrated and underrated player on the Pelicans. There are some people on r/NOLAPelicans who think Ball is the most important and valuable player on the team and then there are some who think you couldn't even get a protected second round pick for the guy."
I'm not sure he looks for hype either. Or BI really.  J.J. Redick and Josh Hart are like our only dudes who seem into the spotlight.
so philly sends over their 2021 FRP. but losing green leaves them pretty short at sf. maybe flip thybulle for josh hart?  edit: nvm. salaries dont work out by a mere $2K
"Would you trade Maxey for a Ring?  Like you did with Josh Hart, Lonzo AND Ingram who is now an All Star?  Sure that was for AD but if you think its going to give you a good chance to take the Finals, you do it.  If you don't think Lowry is a difference maker on the Sixers then that's where we disagree, but Lowry is the best available solution for the Sixers right now. Disgruntled 26 year old stars don't just appear when you need them."
The new Josh Hart
Josh hart is heartbroken somewhere too.
"It's a win trade considering the situation. Pop wasn't gonna give the Lakers another Superstar, and again, their offer for Kawhi at the time wasn't close to his value, specially after looking what they sent for AD. The best value of the trade was BI. Lonzo doesn't do much for us. We have enough guards. Josh Hart really isn't as valuable either.  &gt; Ingram at 21  Would have been nice, but Derozan has done his job as the first offensive option. The sole reason we struggled so much last year was having two of the worst defenders in the entire league taking so many minutes alongside Derozan, and we had lost DJ for a season. Plus, Ingram isn't a stud on defense as well. Derozan's job is offense and to facilitate, and he does that well. His defense struggle can be hidden by playing him as a Forward while he's alongside good defensive players. He has bought into the team, and it's also an awesome presence for our young unit. Derozan has saved us many games. He's far from perfect, but he isn't the main issue with our team.   &gt;Lonzo/1st round pick   Why have Lonzo when we have Derrick White and Dejounte? We got a first round pick from Toronto that turned into Big Body, and Jak fills that very much needed defensive anchor as Lamarcus has regressed a lot.  &gt; While giving away D Green  Danny was sent to match salary, and the dude was coming off a bad year. So you can very well say it was Danny for Jakob and Keldon, and both have turned out incredibly well. May not have been that good because we gave up our perimeter defense, but seeing how the team is with Keldon and Jakob, I'd say it was worth it in hindsight.  &gt;  Just doesn’t make any sense at the time and now  It made sense at the time. Kawhi tanked his value, and with the mystery surrounding his injury, no team was gonna give anything for a year rental. Lakers offered, but for a player like Kawhi, and them being conference rivals, it wasn't worth it. No matter what the team would have done, we would have been clowned, either for not falling for the ""godsend"" offer, or because we gifted the Lakers a free superteam In both situations, we were getting fleeced. People talk about how we could have gotten an AD-like haul or a PG-like, but that type of deal was never offered in the first place for us. Toronto was the team with the best offer, since Pop really wasn't gonna spend his last years in a rebuild, so we took that one. Toronto made the gamble with Kawhi and it paid off. We did made the playoffs with Derozan on his first year, and pushed the second seed Nuggets to 7, but last year we went to shit thanks to Marco and Bryn Forbes playing so goddam much. This season we are in a much better position for now. We were expected to be under 30 games for the season."
"josh hart exists, the one man 6'5"" center"
"The spurs have played 3 less games than the pelicans. No idea why people are acting like the spurs haven't played this whole month.   Keldon and Lonnie are both negative defenders right now. Derrick White has played 8 games all year and missed training camp because of injuries. I would say he's the spurs best perimeter defender. Dejounte has been better this year on defense than last year but still gambles too much imo, he's definitely a plus defender though. Patty Mills works hard to stay in front of guys but if his man gets the ball it's bad. Rudy Gay mostly plays 4 now and struggles to keep up with wings. Devin Vassell has been great for a rookie, definitely an above average defender already. The main reason our defense isn't bottom 10 is because of Jakob Poeltl, Devin, and Dejounte.  The pelicans do not have a bad roster at all, especially defensively. Eric Bledsoe was all defense last year and has been a good driving threat most of his career. Sure his defense probably didn't warrant that selection but he's a good defender. Lonzo Ball is a good spot up shooter and defender. Josh Hart is a great defender. Steven Adams is a reliable center. I'd say in terms of wing defense, the pels and spurs have been pretty similar.  Conley could definitely see a spot. He's been very impactful to the jazz and it shows in their lineup stats. His basic stats are basically worse across the board compared to DeMar's though so I think either of them deserve it over Zion."
Interesting JJ redick posted a video of him hanging out with Josh Hart in someone’s house (I think it was Josh’s house). Josh hart was drinking a Smirnoff ice and jj was mocking him. This was only two days ago or so
JOSH HART
"But why is it that every single prospect has to leave the Lakers to either flourish and/or drastically improve every single one. Randle, Clarkson, D-Lo, Ingram, Josh Hart, Lonzo, Zubac, Larry Nance. Sure some of them are excusable at some point you have to notice a common theme."
Josh Hart will carry on the tradition next year
"I mean, context matters. Comparing Josh Hart and Booker isn't the same as comparing CP3 and Booker, especially since they're on the same team and both guards which means it's actually the difference in impact they have on the team."
"Exactly. Since Booker has a VORP of .4, you really trying to tell me that he is on the same level as fucking Josh Hart.   People need to GTFO with citing advanced stats. 99/100 people don't even understand the math behind them"
Give Josh Hart lifetime contract.
"&gt;*but would you think Lakers would still trade for AD THIS year, given the team has THIS season’s iteration of Hart, Lonzo, and BI?*  Lakers with Julius, Kuz, Lonzo, Hart, BI or Lebron/Kuz/Zo/Hart/BI is very different.  I really like where Brandon/Zo/Josh are at, but I think they're still too young even now to fit on Bron's timeline. They can't hold off guys like Kawhi/Giannis/All of the Nets. Also, Bron's not great for *their* timeline. I like seeing Brandon get touches at running point, and having the pressure to carry a team with Zion--he needs those reps. He's *too good* to be a roleplayer for Bron.  The Pelicans without AD I guess would end up in the lottery 2020 draft and hit on Edwards, Wiseman, Ball, or Patrick Williams. Or we end up in a trade with the Celtics and we get a different young core to build off of and probably end up lottery after that first year anyway."
Josh Hart ~3/40 Alex Caruso ~ 2/25 Lonzo Ball ~4/80 Lauri ~ 4/80 JA- 5/105
Would you want someone like Josh Hart who can be an upgrade at bench wing over like a twin long term?
"I wouldn't mind if they were ACTUALLY CLOSE.  But they weren't.  2 of 3 of those were obvious and the refs kept fucking it up.  Like the Josh Hart out of bounds.  The ref literally couldn't have been closer to the play and he still fucked up an obvious call!!  At least with that one they didn't wait 2 hours and call in Steve Javvie or whoever the fuck.  They got in, saw it, and overturned it.  But it never should have had to be reviewed.  stupid."
"And though I hate to admit it, Lonzo Ball is a good on ball defender. And yesterday even Josh Hart seemed like one"
"Josh Hart, Willy Hernangomez and Ron Baker"
I think you mean Josh Hart
*Josh Hart
I dont know why people say this about some players like Fred or even Trae or Harden. When factoring the volume and shot difficulty they are nowhere near average shooters.  Josh Hart is an average shot. Fred is on a different  level than that
"An NBA outdoor game would have a final score of about 20 to 18, if there was even a wisp of a breeze.  Some guard like Westbrook or Josh Hart would probably break Chamberlain's record of 55 rebounds, tracking down all those wind-blown missed threes.  The Lakers and the Heat just missed 52 threes indoors, for Christ's sake."
I don’t understand how mark jones was able to see that the ball was off Kemba while he was in the booth and the refs though it was off josh hart while he was literally right beside him. And of course they had to review it and waste time.
Josh Hart is Alex Caruso if Josh Hart wasn’t traded.
"Doris talked Josh Hart tf up about defending Tatum, yet Tatum dropped 32 on him lmfao"

josh hart was great
"S/O Josh Hart, miss u bb"
Fuck dusty ass Doris Burke and her stupid homer ass piece of shit commentary.   Fuck these absolutely unbelievably shit refs for the unbelievable bias they showed in this game today (literally called a foul because he thought Kemba was gunna shoot and wanted to give him 3 free throws even though there was no contact at all).   And fuck Celtics fans just in general.   Zion is a fucking beast. BI redeemed hisself today with his great clutch plays. And Josh Hart deserves all the money he’s gunna get this off-season he does everything every team wants. If he was 2 inches taller he’d be getting $20mil+.
"The young core went from wanting to get to the showers early to suddenly showing urgency   Good to see some fight and a switch flipped  Lonzo was a fucking hound on D, Josh Hart is the only guy on the team who doesnt second guess driving to the basket, someone let Zion know he was shooting 20% and BI looked much more rounded   Also when i call for nikola mirotic to be re-signed, svg goes on ahead and plays melli for 17 mins straight   Coincidence? I think not"
WE DID IT FOR JJ! HOLY SHIT WHAT A COMEBACK! Big shoutout to Josh Hart with the double double. What a turnaround for the Pels after a shit first half.   ###[YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS!!!](https://youtu.be/3SQa48DcX1E)

JOSH HART GODDAMN
He gets eaten by Josh Hart.  The rockets have a much worse defensive record after wood's injury. He can't keep up.
Thank you for pointing this out. Josh Hart and JJ Redick were the only 2 players who looked like they gave a damn in the bubble. Fans tried to blame everything on Gentry as if Zion didn’t come into the bubble weighing 300 pounds. Also Gentry is older and if his mind wasn’t fully there dealing with the Covid situation I can’t even say I would blame him or any of the players for that matter not being fully invested
in my opinion if they let him go they are stupid. If you watch the games they are  usually winning when he gets a break and then they start to fall behind.   &amp;#x200B;  I also dont understand why josh hart  gets so much time. It looks to me like he is horrible alot of nights on defense. He has his good spots but on bad nights he still gets 20 to 30 mins.   &amp;#x200B;  Im a lakers fan I watched lonzo since he played there and he has been good at defense since then in my opinion so the are stupid if they trade him. Hard get that good defenders that can pass like he does. And him and zion are made for each other.
Josh hart to. The pels really got a good package for ad. The lakers also wasted a lot of good talent that is killing it elsewhere.
"Kind of crazy, tbh. On paper Lonzon,Ingram, and Josh Hart should be plus defenders and Van gundy is a defensive coach."
jj Reddick and josh hart might be two of the worst defenders
"BI, their best offensive player, Josh Hart, their best defensive player"
"You’re not wrong, Josh Hart can fit on any team to be honest but not sure how I feel about BI staying with Zion long term. You need a facilitator and stronger 3pt shooters, the ones on the team currently who are supposed to be able to shoot are average imo."
"Cmon bruh BI, NAW, Kira and Josh Hart are all out. We’ve been great offensively when healthy, just got to figure it out defensively."
"NAW helped me secure some wins on my fantasy team while KD was out. So I know that kid's got game.  Get well soon to both BI, NAW, and Josh Hart as well. Hart has been playing so well before he got injured."
"Nova products have been great lately. Mikal Bridges, Jalen Brunson, Eric Paschall, Donte Divencenzo, Josh Hart, Omare Spellman’s played some fair minutes, Saddiq Bey, Arcidiacano’s in the Bulls rotation.   All players from 2016-2020"
"No joke, IT actually improved our defense. Lonzo and Bledsoe both played better when paired with IT then with each other. Maybe it's because both have played with him before, or maybe it's because IT has slid into the Josh Hart role of 6th man energizer."
Josh Hart is the definition that of a glue guy
Skip Bayless said he will be the next Josh Hart.😂
People always say this until someone like Josh Hart is up for his 2nd contract and is already 26.  I like Hart and think he's a useful player but it's gonna be hard for Pelicans to find a contract that works for both sides.
"Yeah, we don't. But to get an assist, the receiving player has to hit his shot. So getting assists isn't as easy if your 3pt shootng pass receivers are 32.6% Josh Hart and 19.6% Nicolo Melli. Or Eric Bledsoe who does at least hit 36%."
Dubs probably asked for two picks and other Josh Hart to be thrown in?
"Yeah. That trade is looking worse and worse as these young guys start growing into All-Stars. Sure, the Lakers got their ring, but Lonzo, BI, Randle, hell, even Josh Hart has been playing at a high level. In a few years when the Pels are a perennial WCF type of team and the Lakers are treading water with Day-to-Davis and a bunch of bums, the trade will look even worse. Plus, the Pels got SO MANY of their draft picks."
"Not gonna happen. Griff is going to pay the man. Zion, BI, Ingram, and Josh Hart are the core of the Pelicans. Which will be great when they are a perennial WCF type team in a few years and the Lakers are treading water with Day-to-Davis and a bunch of bums. Hope that Disney ring was worth it."
"Josh Hart, Mikal Bridges. Donte, Larry Nance,"
Aye Brodie I don’t know if you noticed but the pelicans didn’t have BI Zion or josh hart
"I told you, they should of traded him at the deadline. Dave missed his window.   Now it depends how ballsy Dave want's to be with his job. If I were him, I do not believe Lonzo is going to eclipse Brandon or Zion. I'd let him walk at this point or pray someone will give a 2nd in a sign and trade.   Same with Josh Hart. It's fear of loss. He needs to find a way to remain flexible until he has a top 10 player and then figure out what pieces fit around him.   We see they every couple of years with small market teams where the belief is, ""well we cannot lose him for nothing"" and then they are absolutely fucked when they finally have a star. Let the role players walk and just take the L.   Lakers drafted Magic, Worthy and West, and traded for a mid teen first rounder in Kobe. Let's be real about the Lakers. They also had to convince a top 3 player to take an L the first year to sign with them.   The Lakers may sign the best players, but historically, they put the best players around those acquisitions. It's not just about signing the guy. You have to put a team around them as well."
Ah yes the Josh Hart special
"Damn I wish the lakers had kept all their young stars, really they drafted so well. Lonzo, Dangelo, BI, Jordan Clarkson, Nance, Julius, Josh Hart, Zubac, Kuzma. They really could’ve turned into an insane squad organically. No patience at all 😭"
Jalen Suggs is an overglorified Josh Hart
So bummed his season is over. Gonna miss watching Josh Hart.  He also said like right before the news broke out that he was going to be fighting to play with an injured thumb and riot in the lockerroom if they tried to stop him lol. But this is a bit too major.
Lonzo has been out for a bit with an injury. I think he's been out since before the trade deadline. I think Josh Hart got injured last night. Zion has missed the last couple of games with an injury. I don't know what's going on with Ingram though.
"The combined people out from both teams would make a playoff team.  Trae Young, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williams, John Collins, Danillo Gallinari, Cameron Reddish, Deandre Hunter, Josh Hart, Kris Dunn."
Josh Hart to the Nuggets as Barton`s replacement
"Hawks chance of winning (injured players) is out  EDIT:  &gt;Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart have all been ruled out for tonight's game vs Atlanta, per the Pelicans. (twitter.com)  any chance of me viewing this game is out"
Love this dude. Such a total hardass—just like his game. Josh Hart is the kind of dude you want to go to war with.

"I saw one worse against MPJ like 2 games ago vs the pels, Josh Hart just threw him to the ground as he attempted a transition dunk, no call, pels ball outside.   This is just every other game for us at this point."
"Just because it was the de facto Jordan strategy and it ultimately was more positive than negative does not mean it was the ideal way of playing defense.   SG's weren't asked to be rim protectors just like Josh Hart or Marcus Smart aren't, but that doesn't mean that it wouldn't be very helpful if a SG had the size and knowledge to make a quick rotation and elevate for a great contest. That's in fact a reason why Jordan had more defensive value than smaller guards, because he could do that to a better degree than other guards with less vertical pop and size.   There are massive differences in schemes, but I think you're not looking at his defense vs. others with close enough of an eye. Lebron was not only able to take on more defensive responsibilities Jordan simply can't, but he also orchestrated the defense and played in some incredibly complex schemes that required far more communication than in Jordan's time. That to me is a clear step up from what Jordan did."
Josh Hart is worth an honorable mention imo
Josh Hart and his rebounds man
Tonight Josh Hart takes the reins
Josh Hart is better than Marcus Smart
"Shame Josh Hart has not even been mentioned. Even though we're not contenders, Josh Hart has proven to not only be tied for best rebounder off the bench but by doing it as an under-sized 6""4-6""5 forward. He should at least be in the conversation moving forward. Mans has three 15 rebound games this season off the bench- pretty sure has not been done either ever or for a long time. And I have not even talked about how he's usually tasked with defending the opponent's best or 2nd best player(if they're a wing) when he's on the floor"
You know any game when someone goes off they adjust the defense to them.  Let Josh Hart hit 3 stepbacks and he's gonna see a double team.
"Reminds me too much of Josh Hart. That looks like his floor to me, only a better facilitator. Not a plus scorer. He definitely looks like a football player playing basketball, which is fine I just wouldn’t get too excited about the ceiling. Wing span a bit concerning in terms of finishing at the rim."
Who do you like more between him and josh hart?
"Lmao, still not as bad as [this one](https://youtu.be/fjKTm3Ml-Xc) on Josh Hart. I’m not sure why the NBA hasn’t changed the way this is called. It’s ridiculous"
"It is a biased opinion yes, but it’s a shared view throughout fans of the NBA. As you can see from some of the comments here share what I’m saying, nothing to do with the Lakers, but feels good to say it, huh? And to say Laker fans expect success is a bit ironic, unless you’ve been following the NBA just the past couple years. The Lakers were a lottery team for about 7 years, And we only had lonzo, bi, and josh hart before LBJ came to LA. We literally had a meme team. Not sure where your getting the idea we were this amazing team for a long time, when in reality we were terrible for years. And yes those franchises would be happy because they never make the play offs, so having doc would give them a good chance, of course they’d be happy. The laker fans would be mad though because we know about his 3-1 history and his lack of coaching the whole team during late play off series, Picking favorites, etc"
"It’s weird. First of all, JJ making $13M and Hart making less than $4M. And if it’s true that he’s actually staying on a couch, then JJ should get no sympathy because it is a choice. Think about how easy it would be for Redick to drop $50K on a one-year lease for a high end furnished luxury condo in downtown New Orleans. maybe he doesn’t want to live alone? Or it’s mutual between he and Josh, they motivate one-another to put in work and stay on goal. Either way, it’s a choice."
"i mean josh hart said [""that was just so low man""](https://twitter.com/joshhart/status/1375163405351464966)  we have pretty good reason to believe JJ was done dirty, but yeah there are two sides to every story."
Josh Hart too and he's a RFA this year.
"you underplay it but josh hart even tweeted [""that was just so low man""](https://twitter.com/joshhart/status/1375163405351464966).  players won't be as likely to sign team friendly deals, free agents less likely to come, and overall a more negative front office image is never good. players (and the agents they work with) factor stuff like this in"
"In any other year I’d agree and be pissed off at jj for wanting to ring chase. But I think covid has changed things. JJ had plans to fly to Brooklyn on off days and spend it with his family, but can’t do that due to covid protocols. He didn’t expect this when he signed here. JJ has been sleeping on josh harts couch this year, not what a man in his 30s with a family wants. I am worried how this will affect the Pelicans young core. Josh hart was obviously close to him, and is hitting his restricted free agency this summer. This will likely make negotiations harder"
Kawhi in the last 2 years hasnt nearly been the defender he was in SA or Tdot.   Underrated id say someone like Josh Hart.
I'm sure that Josh Hart is more worried about being a pawn in a dispute between his agent and management.  He's not such a hot commodity that he want to be fighting with anyone and this next contract is probably his one and only chance to get a biggish contract.
There are more free agents in the NBA besides major free agents.  Josh Hart subtweeted right after the trade that it was low to do that and he has the same agent as JJ.  You don't think that'll be in his mind when he comes to the table?
"yes in pretty much any business that involves stuff like this relationships are huge, especially with agents. JJ is represented by Aaron Mintz who has like 20 players under his belt. Including RFA Josh Hart, you think this won’t effect those negotiations?"
"Archie wasn’t even supposed to make the league so yea he’s doing pretty good. He’s actually been solid.   Spellman is out of the league cuz he was bad, he’s a sleazy dude. That story about him looking for broke women to move in him with and not have to pay rent in exchange for sex and the story about how josh Hart told the Lakers not to draft him have always stuck with me. Who wants to watch that guy play basketball."
"My fave story after this game was that Josh Hart was giving huddle speeches to his younger teammates so they can win, and that BI was mad Josh stole all his rebounds lol"
"Jimmy still has a slightly better per 36 then Zion and that’s also not accounting for the Heat being 28th in Pace and the the Pelicans being 18th in Pace. You can go to BBRef and look at the lineups that Zion plays with.  Their top rebounders in Hernangomez, Steven Adams and Josh Hart spend either half or more of their minutes on the court with Zion. Same goes for Ingram and Lonzo playing alongside him. They surround him with rebounders to make up for his lack.  Jimmy Butler is the 3rd best rebounder on his team behind Bam and Precious. And Precious plays most of his minutes without Jimmy anyways.  You can claim stats are flawed without context, but it’s pretty easy to look into the context. There is really no argument for Zion being at Jimmy’s level at this point in their careers."
"Holy shit, this article is so poorly written.  It's actually funny. While I can understand guys like Dray and Bam not making the top five while their teams wallow in mediocrity (I am looking at you though Pacers), the fact that the **next** five on their list hidden at the bottom are Matisse Thybulle, Fred VanVleet, Chris Paul, Jakob Poeltl, and Josh Hart leads me to believe whoever wrote this doesn't know a basketball from a hockey puck."
"Except they traded away Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram, and picks for one of those players. Those three are all 1st rounders and two of em are top lottery picks.  But ya, if Lebron joins any team that team is now a contender and needs to push some chips in. Fortunate that LA got Bron, Bron could join half the teams in the NBA and those teams would automatically become a contender if they weren't before."
That’s why they call him Josh Hart and not Josh Hate
Um that’s josh hart thank you

"""We actually were this close to signing Josh Hart""  -Danny Ainge after Hart signs with Charlottw"
Josh Hart did this
Josh hart with 15 points and 15 boards. Play him at the 5 van gundy you coward
Josh Hart only rebounding specialist guard in the league.
"Was sorting by new with all the Westbrook posts and I thought Josh Hart had a 30+20 too, then I realize it was for 2 games.  Jokes aside, 73% TS is great efficiency. Pels have had all the big names catch the headlines so haven't heard about his performances much, but it looks like he's been doing OK."
"Scal routinely praised Zion, Josh Hart, Kira Lewis..he says all the time he LOVES Lonzo. You guys are just pissed he doesn’t think Ingram can grow into a superstar. Jesus Christ, people can’t have opinions..."
"&gt;  just sucking off the Cs and discounting the away team nonstop.  lmao this isn't at all what he does wtf, he's constantly praising opponents, today he was always talking about how good Zion is and how the Pelicans are better than their record, how Josh Hart is a good player and how engaged Ingram looked on defense FOH with that bullshit  And I don't even like Scal that much."
Good win. Plenty for SVG to address though. Not just free-throws. Where has this Bledsoe been all season? He had another solid game. Maybe he just has better chemistry with NAW than Lonzo.             Ingram coming up in the clutch to save the game ought to shut some of *that* criticism down. We definitely need to keep Josh Hart.
Finally our roleplayers (Zion and BI) are helping Kira Lewis Jr. and Josh Hart.
Josh Hart vs Luke Kornet tonight.
Josh Hart &gt; *
*JOSH HART THREES?*
Imagine if Josh Hart was still on the Lakers
Josh Hart is better than Isaac Allen and White
Watch out or Zion’s going to kick it out to  *checks notes*  Josh Hart!
"For the Pelicans, paying Lonzo an excess of 20mil is an overpay. They have Ingram already maxed, also have Josh Hart to pay, and decisions to pay a number of young guys in the next few years.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/players.html  Go look at what guards are paid 13-25mil and tell me where you would put Lonzo on that list. How many guys on that list would you rather have?"
"We had the 30th pick also, so more like we got josh hart, but that's maybe up for debate"

"Lakers gave up a top 5 pick, Lonzo, Ingram to get AD (plus Josh Hart and 2 future firsts). They gave up D'Lo to get Kuzma. They gave up Larry Nance and Jordan Clarkson in a way that cleared cap space for LeBron. Lakers have given up a lot of talent to get their dudes.   It's not like Dion Waiters was essential in their playoff run last year. Drummond would be their biggest buyout acquisition by far. What'd the Nets give up to get Harden+Kyrie+KD+Griffin+LMA?

"Someone explain to my why you'd play Adams against that super small Blazers lineup down the stretch when you can either throw out a NAW that's cookin from 3 or swiss army knife Josh Hart. You KNOW they're gonna put just spread it out and attack Adams in the PnR, ESPECIALLY without Collins or Nurk available. Just doesn't make any sense to me"
Josh Hart for us Pellies easily
Josh Hart would like very nice in a Nuggets jersey tbh
You called Josh Hart a better pure scorer than Kyle Lowry I think this deserves a 24 hour ban tbh.
Sheriff Josh Hart
f'rill. Bonafide Josh hart fanboi right here
Man I love Josh Hart
Josh Hart is a defensive god
Okay so in all seriousness I could see NOP being the third team because Myles + Zion is a dream pairing.  I could see JJ being the bulk of the salary filler. From there it would be either 2 firsts like you said and salary filler (probably Melli) or either a young prospect (i.e. Josh Hart or NAW) and a 1st.
"Because they're betting the talent is there, and they just need a guy like lowry to teach them how to win.  I doubt we'd send him there unless he's ok with it. I like the potential return though. Even without lonzo, they have NAW and Josh Hart as potential pieces."
"What about AD for lonzo, BI, and Josh Hart?"
Straight up Lonzo Ball and Josh hart and a future 1st for Lowry
Josh Hart
A Theis for Josh Hart trade would be a steal for the Celtics.  I like the idea of Theis as a budget stretch 5 next to Zion a lot. Those types of players are limited.
I'm not a jazz fan i'm a josh hart fan how many times do i have to say it smh. I do catch every(good team's) games from time to time though.   Gobert's not a great one on one center defender but he does create a good team defense. I don't think he's the best defender in the NBA but I think he's better than Simmons
I go with josh hart then
"JJ Reddick, Josh Hart, Lonzo. Obviously not all three, but all would be more useful then carrying three true centers + grant Williams"
“Josh Hart is better than Paul George”
"Steven Adams, Josh Hart, and a 1st round pick  Zach Collins, Gary Trent Jr, and a 1st round pick  Robert Williams, Pritchard, and a second round pick"
"Not because, I think that's just the icing on his Josh Hart cake"
Josh Hart
See Josh Hart
Always loved Josh Hart. I know he's a streaker shooter but man hustles
Josh hart is making 2 million a year with like the exact same “rebounding and hustle” production as Kuz
yes but that doesn't fit their narrative  Josh Hart was gonna stay and Kuz shipped
"Ya but Josh Hart isn't a must include, Ball and Ingram were"
"Alright man, think what you want, but I'd bet the market for JJ was a lot hotter at the beginning of the season when he first asked to be traded.  I don't think Griff is some magician for taking a guy who averaged 15 PPG on 45% from 3 and flipping him for a second round pick, and now having that same player publicly bash his organization, but to each their own.  We'll see how it shakes out for you but I think it was a bad move for the organization. [Josh Hart](https://twitter.com/joshhart/status/1375163405351464966) seems to think so, and I'm assuming he's not the only one."
"I wouldn't argue that, Steven Adams is a beast at boxing out and setting picks for his temmates. However just to be devil's advocate, he played with Westbrook who averages about 6 rebounds more per game than the average point guard. And the pelicans have some solid rebounders including josh hart, zion, lonzo, BI"
Josh Hart with moonboots on
Josh Hart 2.0 👀
"Westbrook gets almost 3 contested rebounds per game, which leads all guards by a decent margin. Josh Hart and Oshae Brissett are the only other players &gt;2 per game."
He’s averaging almost 3 contested rebounds a game and there’s no guards close to him besides josh hart off the top of my head. As a team that is more successful pushing the pace id definitely prefer Westbrook getting easy defensive rebounds.
"Resign Lonzo if you can, trade Bledsoe to a tanking team giving up as little as possible.  I don't think moving Adams is practical, and I do think he can be alright next to Zion as long as the 1-3 can shoot. See what the lottery brings this year, there are a bunch of guys who should be available in the 10-13 range who could seriously contribute. Next year start Josh Hart at the 2, you need his defense and his 3-point shot can still improve. Rely on Zion more and BI less in crunch time."
"Try to turn Bledsoe, Lonzo, Adams into:  Myles Turner, Kyle Lowry  Maybe a sign and trade featuring Lonzo/Adams to get Lowry this offseason, and then whatever you need try to get Myles turner while also getting rid of Bledsoe. Gonna have to throw some picks in to get him.   Ideally that turns your starting lineup in New Orleans into:  Kyle Lowry, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson, Myles Turner  That is certainly a playoff caliber starting 5, maybe even a team that can get home court advantage. At that point you need to fill in the bench. I'm not educated enough on their bench pieces now to know who is worth keeping, but Lowry and Turner would be my Plan A."
"Have Bledsoe, Adams &amp; Van Gundy’s bags packed at the door  Put Josh Hart &amp; Jackson Hayes on the trade block  Have a goal to resign Lonzo as the top priority  Bring in vets and role players that fit Zo &amp; Zions play style  Trade Ingram (He needs his own team) for draft capital &amp; a B-C+ level star that can instantly be a 3rd option  Hire a younger coach that can fit the timeline"
I’d just like to add that before he got injured at 6’5 Josh Hart was pulling down 8.0 a game coming off the bench this season too. He’s listed as a guard by the team though he definitely played a lot of three.
And the Lakers still have Josh Hart and like 3 more first rounders probably.
"nah a lot of these younger NBA players are low-key ""nerds""  into gaming and anime and other fantasy/sci fi stuff.   James Harden? Probably never. But I bet someone like Josh Hart (who already streams on Twitch) would be into it. I Don't think you would get stars but up and coming players or role players in the NBA for sure.   Who knows, maybe a guy like Kawhi would be into it too"
"Your missing Josh Hart, Svi And what’s his name the center that went to the wizards I believe. Oh and Zubac"
Did Josh Hart suffer from a season-ending injury? What happened to him?
The one where Josh Hart is visibly confused at Harden's ability to walk it off? I can picture Hart's face so vividly lmao
Also with Harden bouncing the ball into his own face with Josh Hart being shook by it
"I agree with you. Josh Hart doesn't have that level of athleticism but he goes all out and he's averaging 10.1 rebounds per 36 mins as a guard. It's no comparison but just saying it's not inconceivable to see another point guard like Russ again. We get athletic freaks of nature from time to time, guys like Lebron, Giannis, Zion.. we'll eventually see another Russ, maybe in the next decade or 2."
By this logic we should have never traded for pau or   Kareem . Never signed Shaq or Lebron.  Yeah keep building around and develop smush Parker and Brian cook lmao  Oh how I wish we were still an under 500 team with Lonzo bust and josh hart .
"Lakers scouting is crazy (thank u jesse buss), we had dozier on the summer league team a few years back w/ josh hart, moe wagner, isaac bonga and thomas bryant (all ex-lakers on other teams now).  As Lakers scouting is good, our development is trash so im happy he's shining with you guys."
"&gt;Haha now you somehow know that they'd be able to get butler while keeping ball/Ingram/hart  Please, for the love of god, learn one thing about the topic at hand or stop wasting my time.  Butler was traded for Josh Richardson.  Caldwell-Pope + a pick gets that done with no problem at all."
"I agree, a better search might be something like DBPM &gt; 0, 3PAr &gt; .5 so you can see people who have a positive impact on defense and take the majority of their shots from 3  I can't see the full results on Stathead, but of the 20 players the 10 who show up are Maxi Kleber, Josh Hart, Donte DiVincenzo, Lonzo Ball, Jae Crowder, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Pat Connaughton, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Kevin Huerter so it checks out with OP's list"
"This injury has resulted in more games missed and more time missed, but what I think is leading to your perspective that the 2019 injury lasted longer is because LeBron came back from that injury too quickly and ended up shutting it down again for the rest of the season after giving it a go for a while first.   LeBron's groin injury on Christmas that year probably should have just been season ending, as in the weeks after he got hurt both Lonzo and then Ingram had season ending injuries (Lonzo with a grade 3 ankle sprain and Ingram with the blood clot). In addition to that, Rondo suffered an injury in that same Christmas day game which had him out for weeks and Josh Hart as well had a season ending knee injury shortly thereafter (that he tried playing on for a while first).   The Lakers were totally ravaged by injuries that year, and LeBron tried to come back early from his injury to make a playoff push, but he wasn't fully healthy and few of his teammates were either. It was just a lost season basically."
I made a whole spreadsheet before realizing I forgot to take position into account.  Top 5 scoring teams are as follows if we're playing positionless and/or small-ball:  |*Team MB -  79.9 PPG*|*Team DB -  77.6 PPG*|*Team JH -  76.5 PPG*|*Team BB -  76.1 PPG*|*Team TH -  72.4 PPG* | |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Malcolm Brogdon - 21.2|Devin Booker - 25.4|James Harden - 25.2 |Bradley Beal - 31.3|Tobias Harris - 20| |Malik Beasley - 19.6|Dillon Brooks - 16.7|Jrue Holiday - 17.3 |Bojan Bogdanovic - 15.7|Tim Hardaway Jr. - 16| |Marvin Bagley III - 13.9|Darius Bazley - 13.4|Joe Harris - 14.5 |Bogdan Bogdanovic - 15.2|Tyler Herro - 14.9| |Mikal Bridges - 13.1|Davis Bertans - 11.4|Justin Holiday - 10.3 |Bruce Brown - 8.8|Tyrese Haliburton - 12.8| |Miles Bridges - 12.1|Dwayne Bacon - 10.7|Josh Hart - 9.2|Bismack Biyombo - 5.1|Talen Horton-Tucker - 8.7|
not a single reason lol  We were begging them to give Nickeil Alexander-Walker or Josh Hart more of his minutes all year then they got injured
"&gt; **Pelicans-**  Lonzo-Bledsoe-Ingram-Zion-Randle is just nasty. Randle can help  facilitate alongside Bledsoe, and they have two volume scorers in Ingram  and Zion with less defensive pressure on them   I don't watch many Pelican games but is there any reason to play Bledsoe over someone like Josh Hart?"
josh hart
"i'm not sure that back 3 can all start on a playoff team in the west, maybe if they develop more defensively which isn't out of the question as they've got good size and athleticism and are all very young  looney and djj are cheap free agents that would help fill out a team around towns and edwards, josh hart too"
"it’s not that hard lol, some are just total dickheads.   look at curry, married with kids. lebron, married with kids. hayward, married with kids. deaaron fox is engaged as well. same w josh hart."
That's still not 10 years. Not to mention this article you linked is pointing to Josh Hart as the Lakers best pick since 2013...not sure how great this is.  edit: https://imgur.com/McLpJLM
"Lou Will in 2018 was too good for the Lakers lol, had to trade him for Corey Brewer and a first round pick that eventually became Josh Hart iirc"
"OP:  &gt;LeBron only came to the lakers because they drafted the assets needed to acquire someone like AD.  Me:  &gt;If you guys drafted such great assets, why did you have to trade so many players and throw in so many draft picks for AD? I’ll tell you. Your assets sucked.   &gt;edit  &gt;Since people seem to disagree... Why did they have to package Lonzo with BI and josh hart, 4th overall pick, 2 FRPs, and a pick swap? Is it because AD is just so valuable? Let's take a look at lakers draft picks and what happened... because I think there's a pattern:  &gt;Julius Randle  &gt;-left for nothing because Lakers thought he was worthless  &gt;D'Angelo Russell  &gt;-traded him + mozgov for lopez and the 27th pick  &gt;Larry Nance Jr  &gt;-traded for salary dump  &gt;Jordan Clarkson &gt;-traded for salary dump  &gt;Brandon Ingram  &gt;-traded as disappointing 2nd overall pick  &gt;Ivaca Zubac  &gt;-traded for nothing  &gt;Lonzo Ball  &gt;-disappointing 2nd overall pick  &gt;Moe Wagner  &gt;-5 games with Lakers   &gt;Svi Myhkailuk  &gt;-39 games with Lakers  &gt;Even the players they drafted who eventually became something were absolutely nothing with lakers and dropped for nothing or traded as low value assets."
"OP:  &gt;LeBron only came to the lakers because they drafted the assets needed to acquire someone like AD.  So I said... eh, was it drafting assets? Or were they just bad for a long time and had some shit they were able to package with a shit load of future picks? You come back at me explaining how they really were drafting well this whole time, but what.. they suck at asset management? I'm confused.  &gt;Julius Randle was the Lakers best player in his last season there, averaging 16/8. They let him walk in free agency as he was in a redundant position with LeBron  Huh, so they drafted a great player, he turned into the best player on their team, and they let him for nothing? That sounds like bad asset management. Maybe you're on to something.  &gt;D'Angelo Russell was a good player for the Lakers (15/4/5 at age 20). He allowed them to get out from under Mozgov's contract which was killing them. For better or for worse his weird Snapchat snitching thing with Nick Young made the rest of the locker room turn on him  So DLo was another good player for the Lakers. They did a great job drafting him 2nd overall in your opinion, and he was playing great for them. They new he was a great player, but he offended Swaggy fucking P. So they traded him after two years in a salary dump move. Clearly another example of excellent asset management.   &gt;Nance and Clarkson were definitely salary dumps but they also created the cap space that allowed for LeBron to get signed. Both were decent with loads of potential. They also got a FRP  So another two young players, loads of poential. Traded in salary dump to clear future cap space. They got the 29th draft pick out of it. Another excellent example of drafting and asset management.  &gt;Zubac I have no idea why they traded him, that was a terrible move he was really good for them  Fair  &gt;Ingram was definitely not disappointing. He had a potential career-ending injury his last season with the Lakers but was their second best player his last year there. He got better every year and his potential was obvious  &gt;Lonzo like Ingram couldn't stay healthy. Can't say he was worth the #2 pick but I think most teams would have taken him there  Here's the thing. I personally cannot square the notion that BI and Lonzo were good 2nd overall picks if they had to be packaged with a #4 overall, 2 more FRPs, a FRP swap, and Josh Hart. Look at the value of other top picks *when they actually hit.* Look at how much value young tatum had. Or how much value Ben Simmons had. Or so many other young stars. When guys actually hit, you don't need to have such a massive haul in a trade for a disgruntled star. Cavs were able to trade Wiggins and fucking Anthony Bennett for Kevin Love. And that still doesn't erase all their other fuck ups."
"Because the whole team hated him after the Nick Young incident, and that trade got them out from under the Mozgov contract which directly gave them the space to sign LeBron. They also got a FRP that turned into Josh Hart or Kuzma (can't remember which)."
"Yep. DLo was a great draft pick. They selected him 2nd overall, and after 2 years the lakers thought he sucked so much that they packaged him with mozgov for lopez and the 27th overall pick. He later became an all-star, though, so he was a home run.  BI and Lonzo, two more home run 2nd overall picks. They were such great picks the lakers only had to attach the 4th overall pick, 2 more FRPs, a FRP swap, and Josh Hart to trade them for a disgruntled star demanding a trade to the lakers.  Incredible return on value. How anyone questions the kind of value the lakers finds with draft picks is beyond me. I recant all skepticism."
"TT was a critical piece to a championship lmao. What the fuck do you expect from the 4th overall pick? Dion waiters we traded for Jr Smith and Shumpert, two more huge contibutors in a championship. Bennet and Wiggins we traded for a top 10 player. Sexton and Garland are better than BI was at his same time in development on the lakers, and he's the best draft pick you had in 20 fucking years lmao. We drafted Carlos Boozer the year before Lebron and didn't draft any all stars after that because we were instantly a 40 win team, making the playoffs and then the finals.  You want to clown us for our draft picks yet... You're hanging your hat on drafting a bunch of guys you used in salary dumps and that one time you packaged 2 2nd overall picks + 4th overall pick + 2 more FRPs + a FRP swap + josh hart? Bitch please."
"Ah yes. It must have been immaculate drafting that allowed them to turn... 2 2nd overall picks, a 4th overall pick, 2 more FRPs, a pick swap, and josh hart into AD. Exceptional drafting."
Josh Hart!!!
Trae Young  Dwyane Wade  Lebron James  Rudy Gay  Dwight Howard  Sixth man: Josh Hart
"Wait out Adams and Bledsoe's contracts or try to move them with a pick for some overpaid 3&amp;D role player.   Every player around Zion should be able to D up and hit the 3. Currently just about everyone else can just do one or the other... or neither. They have Zion and BI locked up forever basically, they have time to build patiently and find the right fits, none of whom are currently on the roster with them... maybe Josh Hart? I'd say nuke the rest, spend another year or two in the lottery and acquire good fitting talent. I'm not weighing down a Zion/Ingram duo by paying Lonzo like a 3rd star. Someone else can have that anchor."
Josh Hart ( and anyone else from Nova)
"Yeah, Zion should improve his rebounding as his game develops but regardless being outrebounded by Josh Hart on your team isn't the best look. Although Josh Hart grabbing 8 boards a game is kinda nuts. Steven Adams GOAT box-outter apparently LOL"
"Except Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and Lonzo Ball."
I’d rather pay to keep Josh Hart than Lonzo Ball moving forward...
"They have no idea what they're doing on team defense.  \- They need regular practices to get things down because Zion/BI are both ball-watching, rotating wrong, and then wasting energy on long close-outs on shooters.  \- more shooting. not crazy expensive guys either but Melli/Redick/Lonzo all hit a horrible shooting slump and we were just completely without any reliable shooting majority of this season. We picked up *another* guy and he hit 0 of his open shots. (Nunnally.)   We need just a reliable guy we can ask to c+s on easy open looks.  \- Cut Bledsoe, start Nickeil Alexander-Walker. He's more than earned the start already.  \- Develop more. BI and Zion have finally had their first season playing together and while their defense is struggling, the offensive rating has been very good when our guys were healthy. We were finding our rhythm then Josh Hart/Nickeil went out.  When our backcourt is reliably hitting wide-open looks, we should be able to help Zion/BI exert less energy on generating offense and it'll help *(along with regular defensive practices*) on defense.  Zion and Ingram are very very good. We just need to get reliable/consistent help from the roleplayers around them."
"I like Josh Hart a lot too, but the main issue is he’s not a great 3 point shooter. That’s why I prefer him as the 6th man and he can of course play a lot of minutes and he’ll play the important defensive minutes. If Hart could ever improve his 3PT%, then he’s a great option at SG. But if Lonzo leaves, they can try to make a bid at Duncan Robinson with the cap space, but the problem is Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams’s contracts for the next few years will limit mobility to sign FAs. I think Zion thrives the best when playing with pace and space (so a lot of 3+D guys around him). I think C is a bigger issue than SG though right now. Adams absolutely hurts Zion a lot."
Josh Hart starting is kinda perfect at the 2 because defensively he is versatile enough and his rebounding helps if you have a smaller stretch big.
"You need a C who can play C on defense (protect the rim) but plays the stretch 4 on offense. Someone like Al Horford would be great but he’s too old for a long term solution. So a Myles Tuner-like player would be a valid choice if you want to go younger. Steven Adams absolutely cannot share the floor with Zion. How they can actually trade for Myles Turner is another question, but the Pacers probably are ok trading him if they get the right players back.   Eric Bledsoe also needs to go. They need a SG who can actually space the floor and be a 3+D player. Josh Hart is nice but he’s probably best suited as a 6th man so they need someone else. They could try to get someone like Duncan Robinson and alternate him and Hart offense/defense, but they definitely need a SG who can stretch the floor.   Ingram is fine at SF. They need another alpha scorer who can create his own shot. PG is iffy. I think Lonzo will try to leave, so it’ll be interesting who they replace him with. They have Kira Lewis Jr (their pick from this year), but they also probably get around the 10th pick this year. I like Davion Mitchell a lot, if he can shoot the ball. He’s already an excellent defender and his ability to change directions is elite, but if he can also be a 38% 3PT shooter (big if), I think him as a possible replacement."
"Lebron year, he, Lebron, rondo, and Lonzo all missed near 30 games each. Kuzma missed 12 games and Josh hart more. Our starting center got pneumonia too. It is crazy to say they should have made it regardless lol. You can’t say team had talent and then ignore that the so called talent missed a lot of the season. The team was 4th seed by end of December and had a great win on Christmas Day. Blaming for not winning when they can’t play is a new one.   As for this year, you just have to tune in, the team is just not good enough. It is not about being flawed, the overall roster depends on two guys and the rest are inconsistent. Tonight they missed 15 fts and lost. Blaming individual players for team injuries or bad rosters is stupid. Devin Booker was the biggest victim of this and is now thriving on a good team."
So Anybody doubting that Lonzo and Josh Hart aren't worth the money should just be shown this game on repeat for 6 hours.
"Since people are just throwing names now, I’d say Josh Hart is the MVP runner runner up behind Randle"
S&amp;T for Lonzo? Maybe bring Josh Hart or James Johnson with him.
"No it wasn't. The spurs [asked for](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2018/7/3/17533090/lakers-trade-rumors-spurs-brandon-ingram-josh-hart-kyle-kuzma-kawhi-leonard) Ingram, Kuzma, Hart, 2 picks, and 2 pick swaps and everyone including Magic acted like the ask was ridiculous.   [This](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23935910/san-antonio-spurs-engaged-los-angeles-lakers-boston-celtics-kawhi-leonard-trade-talks) is the only trade offer from the lakers that included Ingram - Ingram and one pick and presumably having to take on a negative contract in Dieng."
The Pelicans needed Josh Hart to match the rebounding.
 Best one:  Put his ass under the jail  \- **Josh Hart**
"Magic Johnson, Kevin Love, Mahomes (football but wtv), Josh Hart, Baron Davis, Natasha Cloud"
Congrats to Yuta too but I 100% agree with you in that the dubs should gurantee JTA into a standard NBA contract. Hustle is something you can’t teach and that was evident in his game against Boston the other day. Reminds me of Josh Hart. Hope dude is ok though after the monitor crashed on his head.
Lol I remember when he shared a highlight (pic?) of him basically deepthroating Josh Hart.
Josh Hart on deck then
&gt;*about playing for Thibs*  I remember Josh Hart once said he was glad he didn't get drafted by the T-Wolves because Coach Thibbs was too much like his hard-ass/defensively-minded coaches at Villanova.   Definitely not a players coach lol.
"Supporting cast is ass. Josh hart was our only real good role player. The rest of the bench is ass. Bledsoe is washed. Adams is meh, Lonzo can only shoot 3s. The team is just Zion, BI, and filler. Everyone else is replaceable as they don’t do much."
Josh Hart? Hayes? NAW? Kira? Lonzo?
Thats a lot better title to a post than you trying to pick out wins like Josh Hart is their best player
"Maybe see what we have with Nickeil Alexander-Walker. Especially in the starting line-up. He's young and has shown out a few times. Ambidextrous finisher, can shoot threes, hit mid-range shots, stepbacks, can be a multi-level scorer and pest on defense at times.  I don't think they'll throw our rookie Kira Lewis Jr. in the fire just yet, but he's crazy fast and seems pretty smart for a rookie. He needs to get to NBA weight and keep learning off the bench probably.  They'll both get more minutes if Bledsoe is gone from the team.  Do we run things back with Josh Hart and Lonzo Ball though?   And please for the love of god sign some shooters who will actually show up and shoot and not drop to 20% when they join the Pelicans.  🙏📿"
Josh hart tho
"Hopefully Griffin learns from his mistakes and gets some shooting, teams are living with trapping Zion and Ingram.   He also needs to get some wings for the bench, James Johnson has been very helpful since he came here and they could have used someone like him all season. Having Josh Hart who should only guard guards and Melli as your 2 options was not a good choice to go.  Trade Bledsoe"
"I'd rather start Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Kira Lewis Jr., Josh Hart, and even Naji Marshall our two-way player over Bledsoe."
Josh Hart
They have 22 million in cap space with Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart being their free agents. They either lose both of them or commit all their salary cap to a team that wont even make the play-in game
Yeah. Why won’t they just sign good players in the FA and trade Josh Hart for Herro or something.
Our guards have put up 0pts. Happened last game too... and I can't use the 'our starters are out' excuse this time. Only missing Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Josh Hart now.
Josh Hart
*Josh Hart vibes*
"I’m sorry it’s just reality. Randle and Ingram today are the same tier of  Tatum and brown. Clarkson DLo Larry nance Zubac Josh Hart and Lonzo are better than smart,  time lord  and the the rest of poor draft picks the Celtics have mistakenly made  Lakers put on a clinic of great drafting"
"Basketball players already do sacrifice some salary to get the team they want (both KD and Bron have done so in the past). But the amount of money we’re talking about some players sacrificing under a hard cap could be more than Sidney Crosby’s entire yearly salary. That’s especially so because it would seem to require several guys to take smaller pay cuts, or for one guy (probably the last guy drafted) to take a huge cut.   To make this all more concrete, let’s use the Pelicans as an example. Assuming a $115M salary cap and current max contract rules, BI is going to command 25% of that, Lonzo at least 15%, and Zion 30%. That leaves $34.5M for the entire rest of the team, meaning a $3M average salary for each of the remaining 11 players. Is that doable? Yes. But it gets much harder when you factor in NAW, Josh Hart, Jaxson Hayes, and the cornucopia of other first round picks they have coming up. (I’m assuming Bledsoe and Adams are long gone.) Even if you assume the hard cap would be higher than the current cap, at least one important young guy (Zion, NAW, or some as-yet-undrafted guy) is going to have to take a big cut or go.  But honestly, as I work through this in more depth, I realize that it’s going to back fire spectacularly if what you want is parity. If star players, who are already underpaid compared to their value, are further expected to take (especially large) pay cuts, they’ll just go ahead and take those pay cuts to play with other stars.   You’d basically need no max contract and a hard cap to prevent that, and there’s absolutely no way the players association would agree to those rules."
"I’d just do what he did in Houston but scale it up a bit. Everyone should be thicc, switchable, able to hit 3s, and good rebounders.  PG: James Harden  SG: Josh Hart  SF: Mikal Bridges  PF: OG Anunoby  C: Anthony Davis"
"We’ve been writing some articles about NBA players using NBA Top Shot, including Terry Rozier, Josh Hart, and Spencer Dinwiddie. This week, we wrote about [Harrison Barnes](https://www.nft-boyz.com/2021/04/heres-how-harrison-barnes-became-nbas.html?m=1), who is the most active NBA player on the platform."
"Josh Hart, Randle, Zubac are good defenders."
I feel like Josh Hart is one of the best bench players in the league.
"Missing a lot of our usual roster right now (Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Josh Hart, Lonzo Ball.)   Our newer guys haven't played with the team before and look a little confused about where to go when Zion gets doubled rn."
Josh Hart
He definitely makes the video lmao. I love Josh Hart
"Josh Hart is the next piston.   Weaver and his dad are good friends, He grew up in DC, Weaver watched him throughout AAU, he went to Nova, and Ryan West (Jerry West's Son, whom drafted him on the Lakers) is our head of scouting.   This isn't unique to the Pistons tho. Agents/players having connections with Front Office Insiders is how most NBA players get jobs."
"Do they really have trade pieces? The only players they can trade that have some value are Ball and Josh Hart, and both are RFAs and would have to be traded in a sign and trade, and you can only do 1 for 1 swaps in a sign and trade so you can't combine them together."
"lol we gave up josh hart bi, lonzo and picks for ad. And that was on a 1 year contract. now hes locked up he and other similar superstars are worth a lot more than just bi, never mind how much better bi has gotten"
Ok cool take Talen. As a Josh Hart Stan.....gonna have to say nah to the Cavs
"You never watch josh hart? He’s a good defender when he’s matched up with people his own size, he grabs like eight boards a game, and is really good at driving to the rim. He can’t create his own shot but on a fast break or a cut, his inside game is pretty solid."
Doe Josh Hart still owe that guy money for the xbox or whatever it was?
"Hart is just a role player who shot 32% from 3, and NAW, who we got in the AD trade, was better than Lonzo when he started. We also got Jaxson Hayes in that trade and more picks in the future.  We could bring back both Lonzo and Josh Hart if we want to, but not bringing them back at all may be better than overpaying for them. They’re both really inconsistent."
Should have kept Josh Hart
"Clarkson going off, love it.  Crazy to think of the Laker's 07 Roster. (I know they got AD for some of these pieces but still)  Lonzo Ball: Max potentially incoming Alex Caruso Josh Hart Brandom Ingram: Max Contract Larry Nance Julius Randle: MIP Jordan Clarkson: 6MOY"
I was thinking of Josh Hart when I read this.
"It seemed like the Pels were on national TV so many times this season, too. Zion and maybe Josh Hart were the only players that were fun to watch. Otherwise they got pretty old"
"John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunoby, Jonathan Isaac, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Derrick White, and if you're feeling generous, Markkanen, Kuzma, Zach Collins, Luke Kennard, and Malik Monk. Oh and Dillon Brooks and Monte Morris in the 2nd round."
"We do t really know. BI wasn't the same BI that he is now. Zubac was a good center, Josh Hart was serviceable. We had potential"
Isn't Josh Hart actually on your team? Cold to leave him off lmfao
I’d take Josh hart over Kuz tbh
Josh Hart Nintendo switch vibes
literally my only objection to that trade is keeping Kuzma over Josh Hart
Where Josh Hart when you need him?
"Depends on the person, really. David West retired in his mid-30s because he couldn’t back down Josh Hart. Blake’s still 32 though"
Him and Josh Hart need a new position name
Him and Josh hart
"Best answer is probably Stephen Adams but...  On offense his shots tend to go in  On defense he tends to get down court for the break, letting bigger men (or Josh Hart) handle the Board"
"You find me a video of luka jumping on dudes’ backs or locking arms like harden did with josh hart, and I’m all ears."
"I mean, look at some of the young guys traded away from the Lakers. BI won that MIP real quick when he got here. D'Lo is a killer, did really well for the nets. Lonzo is looking good a lot of times out there too. And I just love josh Hart idgaf."
"josh hart is a zero? idk maybe i don’t watch the pels enough but he’s at least good for tenacious rebounding, solid d, and transition buckets. would’ve been a massive upgrade to kuzma"
This reminds me of the guy who sold Josh Hart his switch
"hey, I mean I got hate for saying the same thing. during the AD trade I said I might have rather of kept Josh Hart over Kuzma, and Kuz didn't have a place in a contending team next to LeBron and AD.  obvi the Josh Hart part, I wasn't really right about since he's a zero too, but Kuz man, idk what the LA fans were thinking, he's not good. shoulda flip him when he had some hype around his name. I got so much hate for that take"
"&gt;It would be Lebron, Kuzma, Caruso, THT, DLo, Josh Hart, Ingram, Nance, Lonzo, Randle, Clarkson and Thomas Bryant; rest would be guys on the min.  You forgot:  * De'Andre Hunter, the #4 overall pick who they traded for Davis * Ivica Zubac, who they traded to make room for Davis * Moe Wagner, who they traded for Davis * Isaac Bonga, who they traded for Davis * Jemarrio Jones, who they also traded for Davis -- but is a G Leaguer who makes no difference, just mentioning him for completeness  &gt;Very thin on big men  Not so thin when you include Zubac, and to a lesser degree Wagner.  If they somehow had all those players, they'd have the deepest roster in the league by far.  Hunter and Zubac both routinely start for playoff teams, and you didn't even include them.  Their bench would be a playoff team in the East.  The huge challenge would be finding minutes for everyone, and getting all these players to mesh offensively -- both are which are parts of coaching that Frank Vogel struggles terribly with.  Luckily for Vogel, with the most talent in the league, there would probably be many good choices on how to play them, so he might accidentally stumble across a few excellent lineups."
Bro at this point Josh Hart vs Kuz might be a real conversation
"Yes.  This so much.  Olshey had made some great moves and his team is very good at evaluating guard talent, but Portland's forward situation has been abysmal since we lost LMA and Batum.    The 2016 offseason and the 2017 draft are the core reasons for the situation we're in.  The 2017 draft is just crushing.  It isn't his fault that Zach Collins has been perpetually injured, and Collins could have been a good player, but the decision to trade up 2-for-1 for him was questionable at the time.  That was a deep draft and they list of players we missed out on is absurd.  With the 10th pick (we traded 15 and 20 for it) we could have had Donovan Mitchell or Bam Adebayo.  With 15 we could have had John Collins, who many perferred to Zach Collins.  With 20 we could have had Jerrett Allen or OG Anunoby.  WIth 26 we drafted Swanigan when we could have had Kuzma, Derrick White, or Josh Hart.    This was the last draft where we had any serious draft capital.  We got lucky with GTJ in 2018 (again, Olshey's people are good at evaluating guards).  2019 was thin late in the draft (though we might have been able to trade up a few spots for Clarke or Thybulle).  No FRPs in 2020.  Going into 2017 with 3 FRPs and walking away with basically nothing is the biggest source of Portland's problems right now.  Much more than coaching on a team that really only has 2 playable forwards."
"Lakers got rid of Jordan Clarkson, Brandon ingram, Julius randle, Josh hart. Kept Kyle kuzma"
"You're right that he's better/same as Josh Hart, I really only had Ingram, Ball and Kuz in mind when I made my post. Hart was just a throw in from that trade"
"2nd year player averaging 19 pts was undesirable? His trade value was at its all time high around that time, Laker fans were hyped to keep him. At least better than Josh Hart.  Classic goldfish memory"
Lakers need to get Josh Hart back to push Lebron over to the right side of the court.
"I have a trade that works, but I have very bad reasons for the teams wanting to do it.  Celtics get Kevin Love and Josh Hart  Pels get Kemba  Cavs get Ingram  Celtics really do this deal for Hart.  Love probably is a bench player and hopefully happy to just be out of Cleveland.  Pels probably won't resign Lonzo so they'll need a PG. (this is all I have I told you this doesn't Make sense)  Cavs would love to get Ingram Pels only do this because they want Zion to not have any question that he's their dude. (what am I even talking about)"
Lonzo is a good defender wdym?  Josh Hart exists btw.
Harden's face is a magnet for all kinds of commotions. Comically hit himself with the ball and Josh Hart couldn't believe what he just saw lol.
1) Josh Hart  And Im done with this article
Someone gotta step up like Josh Hart did 2 years ago and just push Lebron back to the defensive end.
"Why would guards have to sacrifice defense to get rebounds? Did Jason Kidd have to sacrifice defense to be a good rebounder at the guard position? No, he simply has a good instinct for the ball and where it bounces off to after it hits the rim.   Josh Hart is also a great rebounder for a guard position, and he also doesn't sacrifice defense to ""chase"" rebounds.   Guards are generally not taught box out/rebounding because it's really not their job, but having these skills will definitely prove to be valuable in this 3 point era."
Technically we could have kept Josh Hart over Kuzma.
"Trade Anthony Davis and three firsts to New Orleans for Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart and Brandon Ingram."
"Clarkson just won 6moy, Randle just won MIP, Ingram won MIP last year, Ball has looked good. Josh Hart is a great pick. Kuzma is a great pick. They draft very well"
"This squad is definitely worse than a squad that had BI, Lonzo, and Josh Hart. You could have all of the same guys you have now but add in those guys."
I watched almost every game. Him and josh hart were the only ones who consistently gave effort and had to guard the other teams best players.
"&gt;A shooting guard in a centers body  Can he at least be Josh Hart, then?"
Remember when he posterized Josh Hart and the screenshot he posted on IG was when it looked like his balls were in Hart's face? lol
"By the time LeBron came back (too early, I might add), Lonzo was already done for the season with a grade 3 ankle sprain, and they only got a couple more games from Brandon Ingram before he had that blood clot which ended his season. Josh Hart as well had a season ending knee injury that season. They were a MASH unit."
Josh Hart
"Steven Adams was almost unusable defensively if he had to get out of the paint this year. He rebounded good but much like in years past, he floundered about a quarter of the year in.   Kira wasn’t good most nights, but he gave effort every time he was on the floor. But we’re not talking about Kira. The problem is that you had Josh hart and NAW who outplayed Bledsoe most of the year (hart outplayed him the entire year pre injury) yet Bledsoe consistently got the preferential treatment and SVG would go as far as to COMMEND Eric for his toughness and defense. Yet blast the rest of the team any chance he got. So nah man,...it ain’t just guys being coached too hard. There is absolutely more to it than that. You can’t scream one thing and then allow that same shit to go down for your vets just because they’re vets. He’s always been this guy and always will. He wasn’t the right coach whether he’s as bad a coach as he looked this year or not."
Watch Lonzo win for most improved player and Josh Hart win 6th man of the year next season. Baby Lakers are finally all grown up.
"Larry Nance, Kyle Kuzma, Alex Caruso, Jordan Clarkson, Zubac, Josh Hart, THT"
"I think it has more to do with the way he used them. Not so much hun being a hard coach. By all accounts Ingram is a fan of the hard nosed coaching. But you have to think they didn’t like watching Josh Hart regularly outplay Bledsoe (and the team play much better with him) yet continue to see Eric start and get 30+ mpg a night. Oh hey also probably weren’t too happy about watching Zo stand in the corner waiting for an open look , especially with BI referring to him as a generational passer. Just my guess."
Scapegoat. You think Thibs isn’t holding guys accountable in New York? The players in New Orleans are just soft. So much is said about how Lonzo and Josh Hart are winning players but they have never touched the playoffs. The only guy I trust on New Orleans is Zion and Ingram
bro IT barely played lol. I do remember Josh Hart being a great defender for that squad tho.
"well they had moved on from D'Angelo Russell at that point, who is a trash defender. he's back on the squad now. also Brook Lopez was the center and he's a very solid defender. I completely forgot about Josh Hart tho, imagine he's on this squad too."
We couldn't have done it budgetwise but I never liked Kuzma I wish we kept Josh Hart over him instead. His athleticism and rebounding would help us in situations where AD is playing at C
"Yeah, I think they trade him and get a more balanced core with Ingram, Lonzo, and idk, maybe Josh Hart too"
"Middleton was absolutely trash for me in 2k20, couldn't hit a three to save his life  fucking josh hart was better"
He said the Nets should trade Kyrie for JJ Redick or Josh Hart
Danny Green + Josh Hart = Dillon Brooks  Edit: + Michael Jordan
"Allen's ceiling seems to be Clint Capela and he's not there quite yet so his statement is harsh but accurate. However, in terms of predicting which players will be stars in the future I can think of a handful of other fanbases who are worse. For starters, I'd like to know your original thoughts about Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart and Brandon Ingram and your current thoughts on Talen Horton-Tucker."
"I can't speak to his pre-NBA days, but I thought he did fine given our roster while he was on the Lakers.  We were not a great team.  We had young guys still very raw in development, and to be honest, I felt we were always tanking for a superstar or pieces to get a superstar.  We weren't trying our best because it would have worked against what we wanted to do.  Jeanie learned from her father, LA is a star driven town and you have to be good to win attention.  We weren't going to do it with Ingram, Randle, DLo, Larry Nance, Kuz, or Josh Hart, those guys were pieces in a bigger puzzle unless one of them turns into a superstar.  So I personally believe that Luke wasn't told to try his best.  Once we got Lebron, all bets are off, because Lebron's a very special type of player who requires a very special type of coach.  Through no fault of his own, Luke is a young coach without a lot of experience, that's not going to fly with Lebron who's always in Win Now mode.  And given the whole Magic debacle as President of Basketball Operations, I feel Luke wasn't given a fair shake here.  So while I understand he's young, I also don't entirely blame him for our record at the time.  I think a young team in a place where he doesn't get a lot of media attention like Sacramento is a perfect place for him to grow as a coach.  He's not dumb, Kobe spoke highly of him as a smart player and despite his lack of athleticism, he made a fairly decent bench career in the NBA.  I think he can be a successful coach if he's not fired every 2 years and has to reinvent his whole system.  Just like rookie contracts last more than a handful of years, I think Luke deserves to stay on as coach of the Kings for at least 1 more year if not 2 in order to see what he can really do with guys he understands better, with an improving and emerging future all star like Fox."
Flashbacks of that guy inviting Josh Hart to his wedding
"“Trade Kyrie for a J.J Redick, or a Josh Hart... guys that will buy into their roles”. Lmao"
You love to see it .  Rockets fans were some the worst shit talkers when we we were rebuilding and they had peak Harden drawing fake fouls on josh hart
They're  both road games so sadly we won't see Hernangomez go off for 35 points and Josh Hart poster Kuz
i know that harden one where he misses a 3 at end of a quarter against pels and slams the ball down and it bounces back to hit his face and josh hart watches him like wtf this man doing
I genuinely think Naji Marshall is going to be better than Josh Hart by the end of next year so I’m totally fine with us letting Hart walk away
Which is worse matching a Josh Hart 4 yr $56 mil contract or Lonzo Ball 4 yr $90 mil contract?
"Ok so why not re-sign him? Why give up a package like that for a guy that was labeled a locker room issue and unstable? Look at them right now even lmao not wanting to match an offer for zo, or Josh hart? They're letting every piece they got in each tade walk for nothing"
[Dame: That block by Giannis might have won them the game ](https://twitter.com/Dame_Lillard/status/1415514817868156932)  [Richaun Holmes: That block by Giannis one of the best i ever seen](https://twitter.com/Rich_Holmes22/status/1415514798310133762)  [Dinwiddie: Giannis block was crazy](https://twitter.com/SDinwiddie_25/status/1415515485030944770)  [Josh Hart: If the Bucks win that block is the play of the series](https://twitter.com/joshhart/status/1415516601517068293)  i wouldnt say no love
"probably similar to what we gave up for him in the first place.  \#2 pick, lonzo, Ingram.  Josh Hart."
Remember when everyone clowned on Griffin for saying he wanted Josh Hart instead of Kuzma lmao. Even though Hart is probably gone this off season he’s a far more valuable player.
"I am aware of how the salary cap works actually and while yes, the Pelicans could dip into the tax to re-sign Lonzo and even Josh Hart, why? They’re both solid young players but we weren’t great with them and both have pretty big limitations as basketball players that would — along with their salaries — really prevent the Pelicans with Zion from reaching higher levels.   I agree you shouldn’t let an asset walk, so if anything I think a S&amp;T is the answer because if Zo demands a lot (which Rich Paul has been adamant about) then yes, we could dip into the luxury tax to keep Lonzo Ball or to immediately S&amp;T him for lesser expensive players who can contribute."
If I was a team with money I would overpay Josh Hart on a three year deal! He's a guy i would want on my team.
"Lauri to the Hornets is fun! I also love Frank as a minimum guy on the Warriors, I think he could thrive there off the bench as a spark plug on D.   Josh Hart would be a great glue guy on a contender like the Clippers or Lakers maybe or even Jazz   John Collins on the Hawks is the move but if not him on Dallas would be crazyyy   Lonzo would be cool on the Bulls  Jarrett Allen is likely staying in Cleveland"
"John Collins- Hawks, they’ll likely match whatever, and it’s better to have an asset than not to, some team would trade for his max contract  Lonzo Ball- Chicago, the fit makes a lot of the sense the bulls can sell him the idea of a fresh start and being the lead decision maker instead of sharing the court with Eric Bledsoe lol  Lauri Markkanen- San Antonio, they need a 4 man, spacing and Lauri is European what more is there to say?  Ntilikina- Denver, not sure on their salary situation but they get another bench/ 3rd string  combo guard that can come in, play play defense and compete for minutes with Facu and Dozier while Murray is out.   Malik Monk- Charlotte, the Kentucky fan in me wants to see him with Fox in Sacramento but he’s in a good place playing with LaMelo and Hayward. I think he has another gear to reach especially if they let Graham walk and give him more opportunity.   Zach Collins-Phoenix, The suns have a need for a backup big they took Jalen Smith last year but having options is always good. When healthy (if that’s even a thing) Collins has shown an impactful and versatile skillset on both ends of the floor which is something they were looking to add by looking at the smith pick.   Jarrett Allen- Cleveland, similar to Atlanta Allen is an asset. Even if they draft Mobley holding onto Allen and being able to weight the options between trading him or playing him with Mobley is better than losing him in free agency.    Josh Hart- i would say Detroit but he already laughed that off when asked before. I’ll go Knicks he seems like a thibs guy, can play defense, crash the glass and make a play."
Y’all gonna be shocked when it’s Josh Hart
"KD, fultz, oladipo, Josh hart, and chase young. I’ll take it!"
"My thing is he's so young. Guys like Kuzma, Larry Nance, Josh Hart, Jordan Clarkson etc, basically all our late round picks, those guys all played a long time in college. They were much older and closer to their peaks when they were drafted. THT is only 20. He's far away from even being in his prime yet which is why I have a lot of hope for him."
Lakers fan thought Josh Hart gonna be the next Jimmy Butler and Svi Mykhailiuk gonna be the next Klay Thompson.. I’d like to see what delusional comparison you guys have in mind for THT
same thing lol. You know what they meant. He obviously didn’t mean that he went there and dragged Kuzma and Josh Hart to a ring.   He just played the most pivotal role in turning the franchise around
josh hart in shambles
You should take that $15-20M you’re “reporting” to want to offer Oubre and give it to Josh Hart.
I remember JJ said on his pod that he was living with Josh Hart for a while
"Signing Lowry and Josh Hart.  Lowry was supposedly asking for 2 years, 50 million which we're totally capable of and would solve our PG issue (also gives a great mentor if we look for a long term solution in the draft).    Josh Hart is apparently a guy Thibs went to bat for in the draft and Hart loves him (said it on his podcast where Lowry was conveniently the guest).  Not sure what it would actually take to get him, but he does seem like exactly the type of guy Thibs would love to have."
"Because they got Zion and a lot of help for him in the AD trade. BI, Lonzo, and Josh Hart were all traded to the Pels when AD got traded to the Lakers. And then they got JJ Reddick. And drafted Hayes. I would also say Zion is a superstar."
"Lol fair. Even a pj tucker, or a nick Batum…  someone above 6’7 with strong defensive IQ.  They don’t need to score.  Crowder. Iggy.   These types of player are really valuable I realize…   Josh hart might be enough."
"Spurs didn't want Lonzo because we had Murray, White, and Mills.   Josh Hart is putting up 9PPG on abysmal shooting in New Orleans, so no one wants him.  As I said in a another thread, Lakers apparently weren't making Ingram available to us.  Randle is the only piece we could've gotten that we missed out on...but I'm still okay with the haul we got back (since it kept Kawhi away from the Lakers)"
"That's just silly. For one thing, the Pels couldn't have gone ""all in"" that offseason, keeping Holiday would mean being a capped out team, there was no room for FA additions. I also don't believe that  Jrue-Lonzo-Zion-BI-Turner makes the conference finals, even with the injuries we saw this year, and who the hell are the Pels trading for Turner in that scenario? Josh Hart and a late first? How many firsts? 2? 3? That doesn't make sense for either team.      The Pels didn't have the depth, shooting, or offensive creation the Hawks did. The Pels didn't have the depth, shooting, or creation the Suns did.      He asked for a trade, we did right by him, got 3 picks AND swaps back. You couldn't have asked for more."
"I think a lot of Lakers fans are like me and still love and root for Ingram, Lonzo, Josh Hart, Zubac, and Randall."
"Our deep drafting has been expert. Kuz, Josh Hart, THT."
Lonzo is about to get a $100m contract offered by several different teams and you don't get why he would make a difference for a team? Josh Hart is about to get at least $15m a year offered by multiple different teams and you don't get why he would make a difference? Even if someone was stupid enough to think that both of them aren't good they can be flipped for assets very easily.
"Ingram would be nice, but why would Lonzo and and Josh Hart even make a difference?"
They are going to give Josh Hart the bag and like it
They barely beat the 2017 team in 7.  1. PG - De’Aaron Fox vs. Trae Young 2. SG - Donovan Mitchell vs. Shai Gilgeous Alexander 3. SF - Jayson Tatum vs.  Luka Doncic 4.

"Between picks 21-30 seems like you have maybe a 35% chance on hitting at least a rotation player, and then maybe 10-15% on getting a really legitimate piece.   1/3 might not seem super high, but that’s also at a very low salary that you have a ton of control over.   **2011**  Mirotic (23rd)  Reggie Jackson (24th)  Cory Joseph (29th)  Butler (30th)  **2012**  *no one notable*  **2013**  THJ (24th)  Reggie Bullock (25th)  Roberson (26th)  Gobert (27th)   **2014**  Capela (25th)  Bogdan Bogdanovic (27th)  Kyle Anderson (30th)  **2015**  Bobby Portis (22nd)  RHJ (23rd)  Tyus Jones (24th)  Nance (27th)  Looney (30th)  **2016**  Korkmaz (26th)  Siakam (27th)  Dejounte Murray (30th)  **2017**  Jarrett Allen (22nd)  OG (23rd)  Kuzma (27th)  Derrick White (29th)  Josh Hart (30th)  **2018**  Grayson Allen (21st)  Aaron Holiday (23rd)  Simons (24th)  Shamet (26th)  Robert Williams (27th)  **2019**  Clarke (21st)  Bazley (23rd)  Keldon Johnson (29th)  KPJ (30th)  **2020**  Maxey (21st)  Nnaji (22nd)  Hampton (24th)  Quickley (25th)  Printchard (26th)  Bane (30th)"
"&gt; They traded DLo for Lopez and the Kuzma pick.  Actually we traded him for Brook and Josh Hart, we didnt need to trade DLO to get Kuz"
"I bet it was josh hart, hate that dude"
"Kira Lewis Jr. earned minutes as the season progressed. Used his speed solidly throughout the season and I thought he played his best next to Nickeil, Zion (duh), and Jax. He almost looks like a vet out there with the composure he showed. I’d like to see improvement shooting the ball and using his speed to turn the corner more on defenders and be more aggressive when attacking the basket.  Naji Marshall is probably the reason Josh Hart won’t be returning to the Pels. This guy literally “just plays hard as fuck.” He’s the best on ball defender on our team and makes winning plays.   Lastly, Didi came over late from the NBL, but he showed signs of being a pesky defender. One of his first assignments was Luka Doncic, and he frustrated Luka a bit. Offense is a work in progress."
"Lebron was teammates with lonzo, BI, josh hart too which can come clutch down the line"
"I’m like Josh Hart in pickup.   I get one successful drive every game. It’s magical, I fly through the lane past multiple defenders and hit the layup. And then I’m unable to run for the rest of the night and I miss the rest of my layups."
"Yeah, should have kept Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, and Josh Hart, and traded Lebron James for AD smh"
"I mean not really. Players want to play with LeBron. He could have gone anywhere and attracted free agents, only benefit to the Lakers in that department is the location. Every team has young pieces to trade, Lonzo,  Ingram, Josh Hart isn't that much more than the Sixers could have offered for AD, the Lakers still added in like 3 or 4 first rounders or something. It was a better destination go build a winning team because of the location, not the roster. Simmons was a more valuable trade piece back then over any of the Lakers guys."
"He was drafted and loved the same Lakers scouting department that drafted gems like Kuzma, Thomas Bryant, Zubac, Josh Hart, Julius Randle, and Larry Nance later in the draft. Or the fact that Frank Vogel who is one of the smartest coaches in league love him. Or he’s being developed by Phil Handy the best development coach in the league that has specifically worked with Kawhi, Lebron, Kyrie, Kobe, Kyle Lowry, and Anthony Davis. Or the fact that he rates in the 96th percentile according the Basketball Index in his getting to the rim rating. Or the fact he’s getting personally mentored by Lebron. There’s definitely a chance for the kid to succeed but have fun with your day."
"TBH some of the best 3&amp;D role players in the league have been found outta nowhere. The Jazz already found one in Royce O'Neale. There's also guys like Jae Crowder, Dorian Finney-Smith, Danny Green, Josh Hart etc."
Kawhi - superstar obviously but I feel like he'll just stay home  DeMar - definitely had a career resurgence but I think a huge part of that has been him moving to the 4. If this is a point you'd want to debate though I'd be happy to listen because there definitely is an argument.  Doug McDermott - see above   Otto Porter Jr - high on the guy but extremely injury prone   Norman Powell / Will Barton / Josh Hart - undersized for the 3  Batum - Potentially an option but he's getting up there in years and I think he'll only be motivated on a true contender   Oubre / Fournier - solid players but flawed and really don't get teams like the Blazers over the hump  Iggy / Ariza - Old
Try and get josh hart to lighten the perimeter defensive load on people like Jamal and Morris
"Lakers are a 6th seed and a first round exit with Ingram, Josh Hart and Lonzo"
Celtics for sure I believe (could just me being biased but hear me out) if we traded Jaylen and smart since he’s a FA after this year and will probably be too much to keep them whatver picks or bench guys they want we already improved offensively by a good amount we just lose smarts defense which will be big but we can fill that gap with guys like josh hart Danny green Diallo just a thought tho
"The Harden trade was a terrible return though. Presti got Shai plus a ton of assets for PG-13. The Pelicans got Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, the 4th overall pick, plus two more first round picks. The Rockets really didn't get young talent and most of the picks will probably suck (3 1st from the Nets and one 1st from the Bucks that conveys next year). You may never get equal value because it depends on drafting a superstar but you don't have to lose as bad as the Rockets lost."
"1. Offer Randle the max extension.  I don't think he'd take it (and he probably shouldn't), but it would be 100 million dollars more if we give it to him after next season.  Can lock him up on a steep discount for an at worst borderline All-NBA guy if these stats hold up.  2. Move up in the draft for... somebody.  We have 19, 21, and 32 (and 58, but who cares about that) in the draft and reports show that we could probably get into the top 8 if we packaged all of those.  I don't know who to aim for (not decided), but I do know we should move up and get the guy we want.  3. Offer Lowry a big, short term deal.  Not sure the amount, but probably just 2 years.  Give him that pay day he's looking for while fixing our point guard problem, and it gives whatever potential guard we might get in the draft a guy to learn behind.  Also he's just a winner, and our young guys need that around.  We saw what Chris Paul did for Phoenix, and he's not leaving, so do the same with Lowry.  I like this more than going for Lonzo because in Lonzo's case you have to commit to him being your point guard of the future for the next few years.  4. There's been a lot of rumors around Josh Hart to the Knicks (he adores Thibs), so I'd like to get him too.  Solid defender off the bench, good teammate all around.  5. If we have more than 1 pick in this draft I think we could find a decent Bullock replacement.  Nothing against Bullock, I just think he's a guy you could pretty easily find a younger version of for cheap.  6. Bring back D Rose if possible  7. Qualifying offer for Mitch.  ---  I feel like all of this is pretty realistic, honestly."
I love that he mouths off to the refs. Josh Hart might be good but is he going to be the real team player who gives the refs an earful every game?
"that’s fair, but he could have gotten some amount of initial attention there before that happened that lingered even if the lakers fans no longer like him. also on reddit specifically there was that weird “i sold josh hart a switch” saga a while ago on this sub"
The real question is who cares enough about Josh Hart signing with their team to spend the time photoshopping this
Who fucking cares about Josh Hart? Why is this allowed here wtf
"Ahh, so what you're saying is, they care about Josh Hart ""talking shit"" about their team but commented, ""we don't care""?"
"That's probably the first Josh Hart jersey swap ever posted on twitter, he should be flattered."
Josh Hart gets more Reddit exposure per minutes played than anybody in the league
Maybe that Piston fan was looking for Case instead of Josh Hart?
"Lol exactly. We got Cade, we don't need some scrub named Josh Hart"
https://makeagif.com/gif/james-harden-draws-foul-on-josh-hart-tusGLg
"I'm not in the camp that thinks Griffin should still have a job.  What makes it an overpay in your opinion? Davis was still a top 10 player in the league at the time and they traded a 4th pick in a weak top heavy draft, a young all star in Ingram, bench player in Josh Hart, Lonzo who despite his potential at the time couldn't do a lot besides pass and defend. With 3 other late first round draft picks.   Quantity wise sure it's a lot but when you look at from a quality standpoint it really wasn't an overpay.  Only way it could be an overpay honestly is if they failed to win it all and/or Davia didn't resign with the team."
Josh hart if he goes to anther team
ohhh nooo Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart dont wanna stick around whatever will we doooo
"Lot of them traded to New Orleans to get Anthony Davis - specifically Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, and multiple first round picks."
The closest you can get to this kind of play style is probably Josh Hart. Kawhi would fit this but he’s just an all around superstar so I don’t think that’s what OP is looking for.
"I know it’s not the same thing, but just for fun, the Lakers gave away Randle, Clarkson, Dlo, Nance Jr, Ingram, Lonzo, Josh Hart (fuck him though) &amp; Zubac in a span of 2 seasons."
"I desperately want a big guard than can defend and hit open threes in the Josh Hart / Malcolm Brogdon / George Hill mold. Just talking type, not availability.  The next step for both Tatum and Brown is to be the primary initiator so I don't think our PG needs to be that guy necessarily. They do need to be competent as a secondary ball handler though and - good god this is important - make better decisions than Marcus Smart."
"As an okc fan, we’ll eat the 2 years on Steven Adam’s extension in exchange for the 2022 first rounder, swap picks in 23, pelicans and lakers 1st rounders in 24, a smattering of 2nds, Brandon Ingram, and josh hart  Come on presti, make the magic happen again"
"Oh I know. Just saying, that can’t be good for their development…but who’s to say. It probably doesn’t matter for the top tier guys, but for other younger players around them, I bet it matters.   Look at BI, Lonzo, and Josh Hart. If all of them stay in New Orleans this season, that will be their 4th coach (&amp; 2 organizations) in their short Careers. Just crazy to think about when we look at their careers years from now. The front end is kind of Wasting a lot of their potential. :-/"
"Might go against the flow, but I’m with Zion on this one. He’s a superstar reliant hyper athleticism with an injury history. look at Blake Griffin as an example of a player who fell off quickly and struggled to compete and gain national respect going for low playoff seeds in a midsize market (which I respect BG a ton for, but only diehards were keeping up with that team). Each year is a valuable chance to get experience and etch his name on a championship, and that’s never a given.   It might be different if it appeared the Pels have a favorable plan in place and looked to be going anywhere. But they haven’t developed any sort of system to accentuate Zion’s superstar talents on the floor and have moved him through two coaches in two years. There hasn’t been distinct development for three 1st round picks (Hayes, NAW, and Kira who have had to sit a good bit as well). BI wants to be the No. 1 option and has regressed on D. When role players like Josh Hart want new locations, the team can’t be having fun. I really do think Zion wants to compete, and I think this is probably just a warning to the Pels that they better nail this next coach, but the Pels struggled to succeed with AD and CP3 before they moved on and competed for championships elsewhere. I think NOLA is an awesome and underappreciated sports city who does love the Pels, but consistent mismanagement leads to this, every time"
"This is not a good sign for the league, I'm hoping this is just a way for him to tell the Pelicans to start making some smart moves and that we're still far away from a trade request. Since the AD trade I honestly can't think of a single positive move they've made (other than drafting Zion which was a given). They've drafted poorly, made bad trades that already have them up against the cap, and missed on their coaching hire. (They did well to get multiple picks from the Jrue trade but taking on Bledsoe's contract really hurts the overall return in that trade) And isn't Josh Hart leaving in free agency? He's one of their few positive players.       As of right now, I'm assuming this is just a way for Zion to tell the front office to get it together, but it does seem like it could be laying the foundation for a move to a bigger market later. Zion's star power is really hard to compare to other situations with him already having the NBA's backing, his own signature shoe, etc."
The off season will show what new orleans is all about  especially with lonzo and josh hart in FA.   New Orleans needs to show earlier on that they are trying to be contenders.
Yeah thats 3 out of 15. Bledsoe and Adams are garbage at this point. Josh Hart reportedly wants out and the rest of the players are young with a lot of limitations.
"This is ridiculous. He has a good young PG and all star caliber SF in Lonzo and BI. That’s a really solid core. Throw in some good role players like Steven Adams, and Josh Hart and that’s a solid foundation. They can’t compete within these 2 years anyway with Nets, Bucks, Clippers, Lakers and Philly running the show.   Should stay out and develop the team to be the next home grown super team like the 05 Warriors."
"The reason why I think the Lakers are a good example is because I knew people would look only at Lebron joining.  I'll admit, that was a product of our city and the team's legacy.  But Lebron isn't the product of tanking, AD is.  And its not that AD wanted to join our team, the reason tanking worked is because *we wouldn't have had the assets to trade for AD if we didn't tank*.  That's why tanking is a success story for the Lakers.  Even if you accept everything else about the Lakers drawing power for free agents, we still wouldn't have been able to get AD if we didn't get that #4 pick, or the consecutive years of #2's.  Had we actually tried, we would have been worse off even if Lebron did decide to join us.  As for the Timberwolves, I think you're doing what I said people are doing and making the wrong comparison.  The wrong thing to compare isn't tanking and non-tanking teams.  Ask yourself how good would the Timberwolves be vs. themselves if they didn't suck.  A Timberwolves team that didn't have KAT and had a bunch of middle first round picks.  They couldn't pair that up with Jimmy Butler and go to the playoffs, we've seen them suck for like 10 straight years, there's no reason to think they wouldn't have missed the playoffs for another decade like that.    Same thing with Philly.  Imagine they didn't have Embiid and Simmons and didn't go to the playoffs, but became Kings East.  They could have languished in the #10-15 seed like Detroit has with no future.  Speaking of Detroit, imagine they kept Blake and tried to make the playoffs every year.  We all know he's way past his prime, but could maybe give you a good game once a week.  Instead of Cade, they'd get some random pick in the #11-20 range because they were able to ride Blake and some other vet they traded for to the #9 seed.  And they decided to keep those guys together and try again next year with.  They would be worse off than they'd be sucking for the last few years and getting Cade.  I'll speak on the Lakers again since I know them the most.  In those years, we got guys like D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, and a bunch of random players like Robert Sacre, Chris Kaman, Tarik Black, Lou Williams, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Jordan Clarkson, Marcelo Huertas, Ivica Zubac, Brook Lopez, etc.  Some of these guys are pretty good role players, Brook just showed he isn't dead and helped to win a championship, even played a pivotal role in one of the Finals games.  As pieces, a lot of them can fit into a good team.  Clarkson was just 6th man of the year, Lou Williams has won that a couple of times, Julius Randle just posted a great season and lead the Knicks to the playoffs, D'Angelo Russell has become a more consistent shooter and fun player to watch, Zubac is probably an above average center on a team with championship aspirations.  But is that a championship team?  Can any of those guys realistically even now lead you to a championship?  Remember, without tanking we don't get Brandon Ingram, or Lonzo.  We'd get maybe Thon Maker, or Georgios Papagiannis (the wrong Giannis!), or TJ Leaf, or Frank Ntilikina, or Coby White, Trey Lyles, etc.  Pelicans don't want those guys for AD.  We're not trading Stanley Johnson as the centerpiece in an Anthony Davis trade, we'd be luck to get Ed Davis in a trade!  Yeah, it was pretty brutal to watch for a while, but so what?  The owners are almost all billionaires, I don't shed any tears for them, they'll never be homeless or miss a meal.  Let the arena be empty, let them lose money, this is a long term plan and when you win, the fans will come back, guaranteed.  Or they could mismanage the team for decades and have what the Kings, Wolves, and Magic have right now.  I doubt Philly or the Lakers would trade their team for those players."
"You're misunderstanding how guaranteed and non-guaranteed contracts work. There is always a date during the off-season where a team has to decide whether to guarantee a contract or not (in Hart's case that's June 25th). It's not something that's in limbo all year. There are some players who get camp invites where they are signed and the team can cut them at any time and only pay the prorated portion of their contract, but that's not what this is. In Hart's case the Pelicans have until June 25, 2023 to decide whether to fully guarantee that last year or not, and if they decide to guarantee it, then it's a guaranteed contract where he gets all $12.96 million that year if he also chooses to opt in. If they don't guarantee it, then he becomes an unrestricted free agent and can sign anywhere he wants to. [See for yourself.](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/new-orleans-pelicans/josh-hart-23625/)"
"Fortnite is a ~~first person~~third person shooting game, Josh Hart is emulating one of the ~~emotes~~animations from the game. I think that’s when a character heals or something, I haven’t played the game in a long time."
Jrue Holiday  Josh hart   Zion Williamson   Derrick favours
&gt;	1 Player who hasn’t made an All Star steam in the 4 years  Jonas Valunciunas  &gt;	1 Player who currently doesn’t average more than 11 PPG  Josh Hart  &gt;	1 Player who has never played a series that went to 7 games  Zion Williamson  &gt;	1 Player who has never been a consistent starter  Devonte Graham
Josh Hart is elite at rebounding and not getting high 5s. That's about it.
who the hell thinks josh hart is a 4?
"It’s actually worse than a 1 year “prove it” deal. A 1 year deal has the reward that if you do actually prove it, you can get a larger contract the next year.  If Josh Hart overperforms his contract, the Pels can just lock him in under market with the year 2 team option.  If he underperforms, the Pels decline, and he’s back on the market like any other 1 year deal player.  It’s all the risk of a prove it deal, with none of the actual upside."
Josh Hart getting paid 13 mil and Schroder getting paid 5 mil bro really fumbled the bag 🤦🏽‍♂️
"You can't directly combine them, but with foresight you can. This hypothetical below shows the **financial** ability to make this trade, while clearly not factoring in player value.  * **At some point 2 months before the trade deadline:** * *Pels receive expiring F Thad Young and $3M TPE, Spurs receive $17M TPE*  * **At the trade deadline** * *Pels receive G Bradley Beal, Wizards receive Josh Hart, Thad Young, Wenyen Gabriel, 5 1sts*  *** * Beal salary: $34,502,129 * Minimum outgoing to acquire (25% less - $100k): **$27,501,704** * Hart salary: $12,000,000 * Young salary: $14,190,000 * Gabriel salary: $1,762,796 * Pels Outgoing: **$27,762,796**  ***  Obviously the Pelicans aren't getting Bradley Beal, but the financial ability to do something like this. You just need to wait 2 months after acquiring someone with the TPE to aggregate them with Hart."
All the LAL minimum deals really killed the value of guys on the same talent level as Josh Hart
"Josh Hart is an interesting player. He specializes in rebounding and hustle, but is sort of small to play the position he’s probably best at (the 4), isn’t a great shooter, and isn’t a great defender  Combine all that and there may have not been a lot of interest once the competing teams settled the dust"
Nene walked so Josh Hart could run
"Not really if you understand the context behind why he was signed in the first place. Lonzo, Ingram and Zion were all injured, and then Josh Hart tore his thumb. They needed someone to fill minutes and bring some scoring after they lost their starting PG and their two leading scorers.  Then Lonzo, Ingram and Zion came back and the Pelicans didn't need IT anymore. Plus Hart was pretty much out for the season and NAW just got hurt and looked to be a multi week injury so they needed a wing a lot more than they needed a guard. So they used that spot on Didi Louzada.  Unless he dropped 30/10 after not playing NBA basketball in 14 months, he wasn't getting a 2nd contract from the Pels. He was signed to fill a need, did so, and then was no longer needed."
"Lou Williams wasn't traded for the pick that became Kyle Kuzma. Kuzma was part of the Mozgov/D'Lo trade with Brooklyn. Lou Williams was traded for a pick that was then traded to Utah for the picks that were used on Josh Hart and Thomas Bryant.  Trading Lou Williams was also not a ""tanking"" move. It did make the Lakers worse in the short term, but Lou Williams was much older than the rest of the young core, and was seen at the time as someone they should probably try to get something for before he went downhill with age. Ironically he went on to play probably the best ball of his career after that in his early 30s, but that was unexpected.   That trade was about getting a 1st round pick for Lou while he still had time left on his contract rather than thinking the Lakers were too good with him (they were horribly bad either way). When the Lakers traded Lou they were 19-39 and [had just been trashed by an awful Suns team, losing by 36 points.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201702150PHO.html) At the rate the Lakers were winning with Lou (32% of the time), that put them on a 26 win pace with him. Without him they finished the season with 26 wins, meaning they were no worse without him.   The Lou Williams trade was not done by Mitch and Jim, as they'd just been fired, but rather was the first move from Magic and Pelinka, as they began the process of trying to dig the Lakers out of the hole Mitch and Jim had put the team in. The Lakers were awful and capped out when Mitch and Jim were fired. 18 months later they were a 35 win team with two max cap slots. The Lakers were just really awful under Mitch and Jim, even though they were trying to be good."
"They jump the spurs because they lost essentially all of their vets (mills, derozan, Aldridge, gay) and don't have any one standout player. There are a few decent ballers but no stars imo.  They jump the Pelicans because I don't think zion is capable of pulling a team to the playoffs by himself. They have 3 starting caliber players (zion, Ingram and valanciunas) and there's a pretty big drop-off in talent from there. They also have a ridiculously weak guard lineup so they will likely be starting devonte Graham and Josh hart which is not a recipe for success. Also how will they be defending other teams? There's no above average defenders to speak of on their roster from what I've seen.  They jump the timberwolves because they just have more depth and more defense. They are in a similar tier to me where they will be in the play in, not necessarily getting into the playoffs. I think the wolves have a bit more star power with dlo kat and Edwards but I much prefer the kings supporting cast and depth wins out for me.  I think that questioning the blazers drop is totally understandable. It's hard for me to really explain but my trust in the surrounding pieces for the blazers is super low. Nurkic has had a hard time staying healthy lately and so has CJ. RoCo I think is a bit overrated as a defender because he has had the benefit of playing with great defensive units in the past (76ers and Rockets). He's not bad but he's not this dominant ballstopper that some would tell you he is. Anfernee simons is fine but not great. I just feel like the wheels will fall off this year. I could easily see the blazers in the 7 or 8 but my gut told me to drop them"
"This is basically their depth chart now right?  Devonte' Graham / Tomas Satoransky / Kira Lewis  Nickeil Alexander-Walker / Josh Hart  Brandon Ingram / Garrett Temple / Trey Murphy  Zion Williamson / Wenyen Gabriel  Jonas Valanciunas / Jaxson Hayes / Willy Hernangómez  They could be a play in team but their defense is probably going to be terrible again this next year and their bench is not good. They'll need to have like a top 3 offense to be a decent team.  Considering they have a dude averaging 27 PPG on great efficiency making 10M/year, probably being a below average team in their conference is pretty bad imo."
"A few years ago we had no wings, now we have all the wings.  But in all seriousness Josh Hart probably playing more at the 2 this season. Naji and Trey Murphy gonna be backing up BI"
"The argument about the franchise being shitty and it affecting development of young players usually comes from people who know nothing about Timberwolves. Yes, we are perennial suckers and yes, we frequently draft busts in the lottery. However, with the new management (since 2019) we have drafted (or signed as undrafted FA) and played Naz Reid, Jaylen Nowell, Jaden McDaniels, Anthony Edwards, and Jarrett Culver. [We also drafted Bolmaro but we are yet to see his development in the team]. ALL of them have shown a development to some extend and all of them are way better players/assets than Culver.   Culver was given all the chances in the world. We even started him at PG during the rookie season. He was below average in his first season, however with some promise. He worked hard over the summer and came to the training camp in a decent shape, impressed the fans during the preseason games. He started last season as 6-7 man in the rotation. The team started to suck right away after KAT got injured, and Culver even started for some games. He has shown NOTHING. He cannot shoot, cannot be a playmaker, cannot finish with contact. His defense is mediocre at best, Okogie is a way better defender than him.   Culver reminds me of a poor man version of Josh Hart who has a similar skillset but does everything worse. I feel like Josh Hart is his ceiling if he really works hard and figures it out. At this point, Im very glad Timberwolves dont have to make a decision about picking up his option for the next year - paying 14+ mil to Culver in the next 2 years could have been a problem. I hopes he at least can play in the summer league, but he got injured at the end of the last season and did not recover. Wish him all the best, but not in Timberwolves uniform."
So many wings on the Pelicans roster though. Re-signed Josh Hart and drafted two more this year along with the two stars on the team also being forwards.
Josh can’t but what I’m saying is that Zion/BI can essentially fill the role of a point guard. If you have great playmaking/ball-handling from the 3/4 you don’t necessarily need to have that from the 1 though it would help but not as much as shooting. If Zion/BI is on the floor I would rather have NAW/Hart/Naji out there as the “point guard” than Kira. If I want someone to run the offense while they sit I’m going to Satoransky over Kira. Outside of injuries I just don’t see him getting minutes this season. I really like Kira though and could see him in the starting lineup by his third or fourth season. Don’t hate the pick at all we just have a lot of guards.
"Okay so considering that the Pelicans let Lonzo go for essentially nothing and re-signed Josh Hart, I think it's fair to say that at least one ""GM"" thinks differently..."
"Kuzma, THT, Zubak, Larry Nance, Josh Hart"
You are right forget Josh Hart. Graham having less than half the amount of guaranteed money than Lonzo is enough for me.
"The Lakers had LeBron, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, Lonzo Ball, and more, and managed to not even make the playoffs."
"OK MY BAD LEMME FIX IT  Lonzo has 4/80 + 4million in incentives, 80 million guaranteed   Graham has 4/47.3 with no incentives and 37.5 guaranteed   So Graham has LESS THAN half of Lonzo’s guaranteed money, not half.  Josh Hart details not released yet."
"He also had the same agent as Josh Hart, and also lived with him throughout this season until he got traded. Josh stayed."
"He literally wasn’t the first to report any of this considering the entire article is a compilation of reports. Not to mention he’s wrong on the compensation in the Lonzo Ball three way deal since Josh Hart is still on NO:  &gt; There seems to be legitimate traction on a three-team sign-and-trade framework between Chicago, New Orleans and Charlotte that would likely nullify any of the Bulls' fears of losing out on their preferred point guard target. From conversations with multiple league sources, the framework that would be discussed appears to focus on landing Ball in Chicago, Devonte' Graham in New Orleans and Tomas Satoransky, Josh Hart and draft capital to Charlotte."
"If only you were skilled at drafting and building a roster. If only.  You had Zion, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, and Lonzo Ball and managed to get worse since then."
"Josh Hart was a fan favorite his two years here but then was by far the most unprofessional of the young guns about being traded, bitched about it on podcast etc, then had a couple of really dangerous plays on AD and LeBron that could have resulted in serious injuries."
Josh Hart and Devonte Graham worse than Lonzo COMBINED?? Is this Lavar’s alt account?
Good teams dont pay Josh Hart
That doesn’t mean he was less valuable than Josh Hart lol.
"Josh Hart is getting 3/38, so probably about that much."
"Steal for New Orleans, and almost decent return for Sacramento. I don't like Josh Hart though.   Not a bad trade at all."
Look up “josh hart Nintendo switch”. They removed my comment.
My bad they removed the post but if you look up “josh hart Nintendo switch” the top result will be the Reddit rant the guy went on about it. At the very end he mentions he tried inviting him to his wedding.
Josh Hart just got a better than than Dennis Schroeder. Holy Shit...
Josh Hart got what $13m/yr?  Yea this is a great deal for Boston.
"Sounds kinda like josh hart, who recently got signed by the Pelicans for 3yrs/38m. I'd guess about a 10-14mil annually, 2-4 year contract."
I’m saying josh hart is above average
12 mil or what josh hart got and hopefully we can extend Kevin huerter for around the same
Josh Hart seems like the definition of average player so 3/38
The Josh Hart contract
"I thought the Pelicans were going to trade for him. He even came to our last summer league game and the announcer joked about him wanting to be on our team.  I heard Sacramento is trying to hold onto him and 'chase the dream' i.e. trades like Simmons, Beal, etc.  The package would be Josh Hart, Satoransky, and maybe some 2nds?"
Josh Hart
"It was still never going to happen, it was just wishful thinking by Pels fans.  The deal would've been Kuzma + Harrell, Kuzma is comparable to Hart in value, and Harrell is maybe slightly worse.  We just aren't going to ship him out for Josh Hart, like I said, it was just wishful thinking by Pels fans.  Edit: Plus Buddy is still under contract for several more years, and his contract gets easier to move each (declining salary)."
".... And Josh at his best was better, and has been good for YEARS, not just 5-10 isolated games like Naji was. And if you think Naji was good this summer... Josh was Summer League MVP averaging LeBron James statlines when he was playing in it. There's a reason Naji went undrafted and is only getting paid like $1 million a year now... he has no concrete body of work to back up any of the assumptions you're making about him. He shoots 40% from downtown for an ENTIRE season, defends multiple positions at a high level for an ENTIRE season or more, then sure! You can start talking about how he might make Hart on this contract look superfluous and unneeded. Until then? Nah."
josh hart is the type of player that could help any team
How is Josh Hart at 12 mil a stupid contract. It seems like perfectly fair value.
I don't see much of anything Naji or Kira have done to deserve more minutes than Hart on the Pelicans. Kira specifically is a sophmore yet couldn't even shoot better than 10% in a damn summer league game last night lol; Josh has his flaws a as player but he is an undeniable and proven rotational NBA player unlike either of those guys. 30 year old Sato shouldn't be getting more minutes than him either...
"JJ raised a big fuss when we traded him to Dallas because he requested a trade to the north east to be near his family. But those teams didn't want him so the move didn't get made. JJ made it his personal mission to make us into the enemy, and Josh made some offhanded comments about it. Voiced some frustration. There were rumors that he was upset with the front office because he and JJ were really close (JJ was staying with Hart while he played for us)."
"Josh Hart honestly is a good role player, he really provides a needed spark. Essentially he makes the Pelicans better."
38 million I'd be happy if I was Josh Hart
Dammit man lol. It’s not that I didn’t expect that. Caruso is an average player. The hype surrounding him made him seem better then he was. Just like Josh hart when he was here. I think if Mac breaks the lineup he’ll be overhyped just like Caruso. The hype is from the Lakers marketing machine. You caught my last message. This is everything I was conveying all together.
"The same “meme culture” that marketed THT, Lonzo, Josh Hart, BI, Kuz. Also known as the Lakers PR/Marketing machine."
Yeah I mean not liking ur team trading for a player they don't need is one thing but you're telling me that your team signed a generational talent got a championship out of it and you're thinking about Josh hart? Lmaoo loser mentality
Depends on how annoying I find that teams fan base this year.  Whatever team Josh hart is on I’ll be against I guess.
Closest Josh Hart is getting to a hi-5
"Not that much to be honest.  We gambled a little bit and just checked out some of the other casinos like Resorts World and Circa.  FaZe Clan had an event with Josh Hart, Eric Paschell, and a couple others at a club inside Resorts World which was free but they wouldn't let me in because I had a hoodie so that was kind of a bummer.  We wanted to catch the Raiders/Seahawks preseason game at the new stadium but just ended up watching the Lakers/Pistons game."
Is josh Hart still unsigned??
"Him being a restricted free agent definitely would have impacted the interest other teams had in him though. With an RFA, if you're not willing to make them a huge offer then you probably won't offer something small, because it'll just allow their current team to re-sign them for cheap. If he takes the QO he'll get some offers next summer. Not $20+ million per year offers, but it won't just be crickets for him like this summer has been. Same thing goes for Josh Hart."
He’s not negative value but josh hart isn’t negative value either. weren’t the kings about to accept Kuz and KCP? That should show you that his value isn’t as high as you think it is. Buddy is elite at shooting yes but he’s below average at every other aspect of the game and was causing locker room issues for being benched. Doubt anyone coughs up anything of large value for him.
i'd consider not being a fan of the kings anymore if you only get a josh hart return for buddy hield..
"1) I don’t agree, if Bouknight is better he’s getting more minutes anyway  2) I see Josh Hart as a backup 3 in Borrego’s system with some rotation 2 minutes. When Hayward inevitably gets injured/rested, I would rather have Hart there"
"A lot of teams are still sitting on their MLE. Might as well try using it on Josh Hart, better than just letting the MLE sit around."
Im honestly surprised no one gave Josh Hart a better offer sheet. I would have rather overpaid Hart than Oubre if I were the Hornets.
"I don't really see any of those holding water. JJ's not dumb and the backlash he'd face (and is facing) is worse than anything he'd gain from making this move.   Airing out this dirty laundry was a calculated move, not an off the cuff comment, happened almost a week after the trade. I think it was known around the team what the situation was, you can infer as much with the reports on Zion and tweets like [this](https://twitter.com/joshhart/status/1375163405351464966) from Josh Hart right after the trade happened."
"Credit to OP for the awesome structure and idea.  Starting LineUp:  PG: Kemba Walker 10  SG: James Harden 38  SF: LeBron James 39  PF: Marcus Morris 12  C: Nerlens Noel 8  Bench:  Guards: Grayson Allen 4  Wings: Josh Hart 6  Bigs: Bobby Portis 3  First of all I wanted to say awesome job OP, definitely looks like you worked hard on this list and I like it. Also, side note I think you mistook Troy Brown Jr for Bruce Brown Jr. I probably spent more time than I should’ve at this so I hope you guys enjoy.  Anyways, for my team. I went with the approach that’s been working most for basically the past decade and more now, LeBron plus shooting and playmaking.  Team Reasons:  My strategy was picking up guys who I thought was the best bang for your buck, who I thought were huge steals and honestly I think a lot of these guys are undervalued.  Kemba Walker for 10 is a steal, this is still someone with excellent on ball and off ball guard ability who can average 20ish PPG in that role doing so. He can take pressure off Harden &amp; LeBron.  James Harden is I think the best SG in the game and his scoring and playmaking ability never to someone like LeBron would be amazing like we’ve seen similarly with Chris Paul in the past. He’d make everyone around him better and scores with ease.  LeBron James age may hurt him but I’m a strong believer in him. I think he’ll still be as good as ever and at the very highest a step slower but that’s still a damn good player. His playmaking ability next to this team will be huge.  Marcus Morris for 12 is a huge steal. He averaged 20ish PPG on the Knicks and is an amazing shooter who’s proven he can play with multiple wings as a small ball C or a wing in general.  Nerlens Noel is someone who I think can thrive as a starter especially next to James Harden. His defence is definitely good enough to sustain a starting spot.  Bench:  Grayson Allen I think is someone who you undervalued OP because he was a starter on a playoff team who averaged 11 PPG shooting lights out from 3, 39% making 2 a game. He also has good enough playmaking ability and to do stuff off the dribble.  Bobby Portis per 36 stats last season he was second in the league in points off the bench and first in rebounding for 3 BP is amazing. Good floor spacer too if Nerlens isn’t playing well.  Josh Hart or Terrence Ross I couldn’t decide between. They’re the same price but I’m not sure if Ross as a 6th man is a better fit or Hart as a small ball lineup player. I think id go with Hart because of his rebounding even though TRoss is a bigger name.  I think this team has the perfect amount of playmaking, scoring, floor spacing and just enough defence to help them. I’d honestly say this is the best team anyone can come up with but I do not wanna get ahead of myself."
Has Josh Hart been signed anywhere yet? I haven't heard anything about him but if he wants to be on a contender that's not a bad price for him
"That summer league squad, BI/Zo/Zubac/Kuzma/Caruso and Josh Hart."
"Yeah dude no point in even conversing with you if you’re delusional enough to say the Lakers have made “2 decades of awful personnel moves and would be the worst franchise in history if it didn’t happen to be located near Hollywood”.   I guess that hiring Phil Jackson, trading for Pau, drafting and building the 09-10 championship teams, consistently hitting on draft picks and G-League signings (Randle, Lonzo, BI, Kuz, Josh Hart, Thomas Bryant, Caruso) which allowed us to even have a chance at AD (and now Westbrook) hiring Vogel, and hiring Pelinka just to name a few key, successful moves over the “past 20 years” is classified as “consistently awful”. Not to mention, the Lakers wouldn’t have even been in that drought in the 10’s had Stern and the NBA not completely fucked them over (funny enough New Orleans would’ve been much better off with our package in hindsight).  It’s clear you just have a lot of hatred for the Lakers which is fine, just try not to make it delusional."
Who are the biggest FAs/RFAs left aside from Lauri and Josh Hart?
Josh Hart is like a 6'10 guy in a 6'4 body. Lauri Markkanen is the opposite
"Lonzo, Kuzma and Josh Hart will surely develop into superstars!"
Josh hart is good at this too
"Could be, who knows. But, agents have a lot more power and influence then we might expect sometimes. It's not unusual for a player to not have any part in contract negotiations until it's time to put pen to paper. You have agents who might not outright tell their clients what to do, but they'll definitely lead them down the path the agent wants them to go.   And grudges between organizations/front offices and agents/agencies aren't unusual either.  For a decade, any player repped by Aaron Mintz did not have a long relationship or any a relationship at all for that matter with the Lakers.  I believe it started with Ariza back in 2009 and how that contract negotiation fell apart. You wonder why Carmelo never signed with the Lakers? Why dangelo Russell and Julius Randle didn't last long with the Lakers? Why Paul George and his courting with the Lakers took a turn for the worse? I believe even Josh Hart and Lonzo were clients of Aaron Mintz during their time with the Lakers. How did that turn out.  But, it's amazing how things can come full circle and fences can mended. Both Ariza and Carmelo recently signed with the Lakers. Guess who's still their agent?"
"Agree , Hart is a scrub , how do they go from Simmons to Siakam to freaking josh hart , Kangz"
Josh Hart plays bigger than he is. 6”5/215lbs Shooting Guard and averaging over 8 Rebounds Per Game.  That’s insane
Josh Hart.
there's nobody really left worth using it on except for maybe josh hart but he's probably getting paid more than that
I'm now ready for the Lauri Markannen and the Josh Hart saga
"Jordan Clarkson, Julius randle, Larry Nance Jr, Lonzo, Brandon Ingram, d’Angelo, Josh Hart, Zubac, and Thomas Bryant have all turned out decent to amazing. You’re just talking out of your ass 😂"
"he joins the ranks of lonzo, bi, josh hart, randle, dlo, and caruso. Go forth and prosper"
Josh hart was a highly touted young player for the lakers. Which means he was vastly overated.
"He’s very good. I loved him.   But if you draft/bring in that many wings to develop, you have to develop them and give them minute. If we resign Josh Hart, those guys aren’t getting developed and we’re possibly in another lose-lose situation like last year where we not any good and our young guys aren’t developing."
For real I don’t know what Josh Hart he is watching. The dude is the personification of maximum effort
"Josh Hart still unsigned? Isn’t he, like, not bad??"
"Other than not chucking a shot when an opportunity arises, Josh Hart doesn't really do anything Hield does."
"im not sure how official official it is, sometimes trades get ""finalized"" and then altered because its not official official with the league yet. We saw this with um the AD trade when Hawks and Wizards were added after the deal was already ""finalized"" to allow the Lakers to dump off additional salary post-hoc. I feel like there's always some gray area with this shit, maybe they are looking into altering the deal to getting Buddy Hield back instead of the TPE (with Josh Hart equally the equivalent difference in outgoing.)"
"Buddy is the better player, but I like that deal for both teams. Josh Hart does all of the little things that kings fans are frustrated with Buddy for not doing."
"I feel like he and Josh Hart are pretty similar, Hart went off in the summer league too"
Teams absolutely forget that the draft is for finding role players too. Josh Hart went #30 and it'd take him over the #30 overall pick most years.
"If he means Josh Hart then I don’t know why are always just throwing those stats around. He plays good defence , knows how to cut and will grab the fuck out of any rebound he’s in range of. He’s a complimentary piece to most teams especially if you have a lot of iso plays"
"What’s wrong with Josh Hart, we could use him"
"I know it’d never happen, but I’d happily have Josh Hart back on a minimum contract."
is Josh Hart bad
Josh hart come back... you can blame it all on meeeeee
"To be fair, LA is the market that gets players noise. I mean Josh Hart is arguably more popular than John Collins. Yes he stepped away a bit but I think the biggest factor is him being out of the spotlight."
Josh Hart is the best
Josh hart
"The Lakers *could* have offered Markieff the same contract that Richaun Holmes got from Sacramento, or even what Reggie Jackson got from the Clippers (they had early Bird rights on him, just like with those other guys and their teams), but instead they just passed on him. He seems like he has the same bitterness that Josh Hart had when the Lakers traded him. Some of these guys must really hate it when the chance to be a Laker is taken away from them. I mean, [just look how happy he was to be a part of the team.](https://youtu.be/EdSRV0D-yiE)"
agree  &gt; Did Josh Hart have any alternative offers that were better or equal?  id highly doubt it. i know i was pretty surprised he even got what he got.
"He also shares an agent (and for a while a house) with Josh Hart, who just signed an absurdly team friendly deal with the Pelicans. So maybe he doesn't speak for that entire agency."
Did Josh Hart have any alternative offers that were better or equal? I think what OP is alluding to is that when all conditions are equal then interpersonal relationships come into play and the agent-FO dynamic is a major piece of that. Personally I think that gets overblown a bit but it's undeniable agents have a lot of influence on a player's decisions. Case in point KP's agent purposely kept him from the sixers because they had fucked over a previous client of his
"He also shares the same agency as Josh Hart, who re-signed with the Pelicans"
Bro I remember Perkins suggested trading kyrie for JJ redick and josh hart😭but yeah kd and kyrie have said multiple times they want to create a place where people come to be competitive and just hoop on some chill vibes lmao
"It’s not like it’s entire teams. Josh Hart isn’t actin up like he can dictate terms.  It’s basically a handful of 15 guys, and out of those 15? 10 or so have made their franchise a shit ton of money.   If the Pelicans are that mad at Zion?   Don’t offer the extension. In the last year of his deal, where he’s making way less, bench him a bunch.   Then trade him to Cleveland for a 1st rounder."
No one who had money wanted to spend it on Josh Hart
Surprised Josh Hart didn’t sign somewhere else after all the mess these past two seasons
"Monte Morris, Josh Hart, Otto Porter Jr, Larry Nance, Robin Lopez"
AND Pelinka tried to sign kawhi for whatever reason. Lonzo and probably josh hart could’ve been kept had they not thought they were in the running for that.
"Right like that's like me saying if Josh Hart lives up to his potential we got this... I love J Hart, but with all due respect."
"He's 23 and just repeated his All Star season's numbers with Zion having the most efficient 27ppg season ever. Zion and BI are absolute stars and pillars. I didn't say runnint back the same team. The team made almost all of the changes they needed this year from last.   JV is in every way imaginable upgrade over Steven Adams. Eric Bledsoe shouldn't be in the NBA and is gone. Whoever replaces him starting NAW, Josh Hart or even Trey Murphy would be an instant upgrade. I liked Lonzo a lot, but there's no denying how good of a pick up Devonte Graham is. He was tied for 7 in the league with ast in just his 2nd year in and can shoot the 3. He's  shot 37.4 percent from 3 the last two seasons combined with 65% of his 13.8 fga coming from 3. Trey Murphy looks like the steak of the draft at 17th. He got all summer league avg 16.3/7/2.8 w 1.8stl 1.3blk on 56/44/100 splits and is 1 of 2 players to be 50/40/90 last season and playes great D.  This team is young. Sorry you want that to occur the same way super team rebuilds do. Naji is 23 and looked great us once he made it into rotation the last part of the season avg 9.7/5.8/3.4  his last 25 games. He has good size and can play d. Nickeil Alexander Walker and BI are 23, Zion is 21, Kira Lewis Jr is 21, Rookie Herbert  Jones who is 22 was All Sec first team, Sec DPOY,  and Sec POY and they got him at 35. They have tons of young developing talent and draft picks.  The Pels missed the play in by 2 games. They lost 17 games by 5 or less and 11 by 3 or less. Not having Bledsoe on the team alone last year would of made this team a playoff team. They hired Willie Green a former player for 12 years as a coach this summer. Greeen is highly praised around the league, won championships as an assistant with GSW from 2016-2019 and went to the WCF last year with Phoenix as an assistant and was highly praised by CP3.  So to act like the Pels are meandering, not making moves, are far off from competing, or are dropping the ball is really just not the case in anyway."
"The thing is, they have great pieces and talent. Amazing. It's like a young thunder squad that made it to the finals if you ask me. It had Lonzo, BI, Zion, Steven Adam, Josh Hart, decent role players too like James Johnson, Kyra, etc. It just didn't work for some reason, as much as I would have liked it to"
"Yeah, but how much? For example, Chris Paul signed for '4 years $120 million' earlier this offseason, but only $75 million of that is guaranteed. Josh Hart for '3 years $38 milion' but only $12 million guaranteed."
"Those aren’t correlations, they’re coincidental. Playing against g leaguers fighting for nba contracts and rookies doesn’t show how a player will perform in the nba in any way shape or form.   Ayton is a great defender tf ?  Which areas he excelled in doesn’t make it any less of a small sample so that’s a weird point to mention.   And idk why you’re acting like he dominated when he put up an inefficient 14/11 over a four game sample. Cam Thomas outplayed that. Jalen green. Tre Jones. Omer yurtseven. And while we’re at it let’s look at some past players to further prove my point. 2015-2016, Alan Williams dominated and went on to be a fringe rotational guy and then out of the league. Noah vonleh played extremely well too. Meanwhile all star KAT struggled a lot. The next year? Trey Lyles and Kris Dunn were the summer league stars. What incredible careers they’ve had. 2017-2018? Bryn Forbes dominated. Lonzo ball was electric. Guys like Quinn cook, troy Williams, Wayne selden, Dennis smith jr and Deandre Bembry were all excellent. Meanwhile guys like bam and fox struggled. 2018-2019? Malik monk and josh hart stole the show. Ante zizic dominated too. Cheick diallo was a real standout too. But guys like Trae young were awful. 2019-2020?NAW, anfernee Simons, Tony Bradley and drew Eubanks killed it. Meanwhile RJ Barrett sucked.  Summer league means nothing"
"That's great in theory, except that Dallas won't have cap space either. The article makes the point that it doesn't look like anybody really will:  &gt; On Aug. 15, HoopsHype's [Yossi Gozlan](https://twitter.com/YossiGozlan/status/1426990210735173637?s=19) projected that seven teams would have cap space next offseason. Since then, four of those teams have cut into that space significantly. Boston extended several players, Charlotte extended Terry Rozier and signed Kelly Oubre, New Orleans re-signed Josh Hart and Detroit acquired and waived DeAndre Jordan. The remaining three all have meaningful players whose possible extensions could and likely will cut into their space as well: Memphis has Jaren Jackson, San Antonio has Lonnie Walker and Orlando has Mo Bamba and Wendell Carter.   Now it's always possible some teams could shuffle things around to try to open up space for Beal or LaVine, but until that happens it's not much of a bluff on their part to say ""trade me or I'll walk."""
"Trying to think of teams that could really use Rubio, and what they could potentially trade for him and his $17.8m contract; remembering the Cavs largely need wing depth:   **Boston Celtics:** Would have to be some combination of Richardson and Nesmith/Langford.   **Los Angeles Clippers:** Luke Kennard and maybe Keon Johnson?   **New Orleans Pelicans:** Josh Hart and maybe Trey Murphy?   Hard to find much of a market for him where the other team can give up much."
"Lmao it wasn’t, the lakers were offering Ingram, Ball, and Josh Hart, and multiple first round picks. Pop traded him to Toronto out of spite"
"It's measured it terms of star power, results, or value.   Lakers got the star/best player in the trade.   Lakers already won one chip.   Can you find another AD in the league? Or can you find another BI, Lonzo, or Josh Hart? Those players are almost commonly available. AD is a top 5 or 10 player when healthy. Those are rarely available even for the Lakers. Tho we get them more than anybody else it seems.  We traded away BI and 3 years later we got Westbrook. An upgrade compared to anybody we let go. Even Randle.  Pelicans havent scratched even the play in. Maybe Lonzos got the voodoo. We'll see with Chicago."
"Thats what I thought, but I just checked and of the 1350 minutes Josh Hart played, Steven Adams only played about 480 with him. Thats only like 1/3 of Hart's Minutes"
"I cannot find the original source of what I said about McDermott, sadly, but there was one, really. It's not casual that I remember the Number 9.  If you are talking about the last true young core the Lakers had, I guess tit turned out well: Ingram signed a Max Contract and was an All-Star and Lonzo Ball jsut signed a solid contract with the Bulls and is ready for a solid season with a nice team. Josh Hart is a solid rotational player, same for Kuzma.  I get that everyone overhype their talent, but I'm not talking crazy tbh.  For example Dejounte Murray and Jakob Poeltl are top defender in their position as Ball Index says. HERE is a comment where I talk about this. DJ is a Top 4 Defensive Guard and Jakob a Top 3 Defensive Center. About Keldon, he went to the Olympics and brought the energy and played really good during the exhibition games where he played. He also had a 20-20 game this season. Derrick White sadly missed this season, but if you saw the Bubble, he was exceptioanlly good and played even better than DeMar. Also that 36pts game in the Playoffs against Denver two year ago was fire.  **ABOUT DEJOUNTE MURRAY**  Let's bring to the table the mid-range shot then.  Dejounte Murray shot better from the midrange than KAWHI LEONARD while attempting more shots. I highly doubt Kawhi is criticized for his mid-range abilities, instead he's called as someone who never misses from there, considered as one of the best ones in the league. And rightly lemme say because Kawhi is an extremely good mid-range shooter, but have you ever seen someone saying that DJ is at his level.  Actually, only considering the ones that shot more than 210 mid-range shots, DJ is ranked 8th. Better than him, in order, we find: CP3 (382), Jokic (235), Embiid (285), Booker (346), Ingram (354), Beal (333), DeRozan (331). DJ shot an amazing 45.4% with 302 attempts!  Behind him you can find the rightly considered Mid-Range Master Khris Middleton (just 20 more attempts and 0.3% worse). Also Kawhi, Dame, Curry...  (Worth mentioning Nikola Vucevic: less than 1% worse than DJ but with like 70 more shots. Also Irving and KD are excluded because they didn't shoot much because they didn't play much)  And we gotta say that DJ came to the league as a complete terrible shooter, really, he couldn't shoot at all. So he slowly developed one and he is progressing with the range.  Also let's add the fact that he was injuried for a full season and also played his rookie year mainly in the G-League.  Ja Morant played a total of 4127 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 3rd Season. Dejounte Murray played a total of 5891 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 5th Season. Their age difference is just 2 years too.  So I'm not saying DJ is the shooting maestro, but he's crazy underrated in everything and especially his shooting abilities!"
"Jaylen and Hayward were near all star level that next year, while Lonzo was an average starter and Josh Hart was an average role player. Plus 1 of Brown or Hayward would’ve provided more scoring than Lonzo or Josh Hart."
He didn’t have less value than Josh Hart…
"Brandon Ingram got a max, D'Angelo Russell got a max, randle got a bag, Nance is a great player, Josh Hart is a great bench player, Kuz just got us Russell Westbrook lol  We drafted great players, even our second rounders like Jordan Clarkson hit , Thomas Bryant is starting for the wiz, this idea of disappointing players is garbage   &gt;I highly doubt magic was the dominant factor there, but ya never know I guess.   Literally gave an article with lebron saying why he went to la, and it had nothing to do with the movies or the night life, he could have stayed in Miami if he just wanted the nightlife   &gt;And no, nowhere was I talking about Pelinka specifically there.  That's why it's a garbage statement, lebron and AD were not products of the previous FO, so it's just you saying general statements that have no context   The Lakers were bad for a period of time , what does that have to do with the reason lebron is here now? We had the assets and the cap space and lebron saw that as well"
"How so? We have had super agents do stuff since MJ. Mintz is a hated by the Lakers. Tried to corner them with Ariza (where they signed Artest) during a championship run.   The Lakers tried to sign Paul George, they did sign Ed Davis, Josh Hart, Julius Randle, and DLo. No GM risk even a fringe NBA player because of the agent. You won’t find a good player who doesn’t have an agent do all this stuff.   Rich hasn’t done anything worse than another agent. And even if it was the player that did it, it doesn’t matter. Take Dwight. He left the Lakers which lead to their worst stretch in franchise history. When they had a chance to sign him as a backup center (when most of the league wasn’t interested in him at all) the Lakers signed him. So no, Rich using his leverage won’t ever affect his job."
"They still ended up getting a huge package for AD, not like the Lakers completely ripped them off or something.   They got 2 former # 2 picks, a #4 pick, 2 more unprotected picks, and Josh Hart. How did the Celtics have the better trade package? They'd have to include both Brown and Tatum + picks to beat the Lakers package, and I doubt they were ever considering that.   If anything the Lakers overpaid lmao, Ainge didn't have the balls to go all in on AD given Kyrie's FA status at the time, and AD's unwillingness to sign an extension."
"To put into context for others who think Bam is old, he was in the 2017 draft class which included; Markelle Fultz, Lonzo, Jayson Tatum, De'aaron, Jarret Allen, Kuzma, Josh Hart, Lauri Markkanen, and Frank Nilikina."
"“I can name 15-20 PGs who are better defensively than Curry.”  Then why’d you have to bring in shooting guards?  Some of the people you named are legitimately terrible defenders.  Schroeder is a Celtic so now you’re gonna pretend he’s not one of the worst PG defenders in basketball?  Kyrie is terrible and you had some tired homer bullshit about him being “good when he’s locked in”.  I should stop responding now that it’s clear you’re a serious, serious Celtic homer.  But here are some more who aren’t better than Steph on defense, and I’m just kinda surprised at how random your list seemed to recruit bad defenders from strange places, even the bench.  Fox (dude…), Neto, Dinwiddie (seriously, what lol?), Jevon Carter (you don’t get to say a man who comes in for 12 mins a game and guards backups is an elite defender).  Then you have combo guards like Jrue, Caruso, Kris Dunn etc.  only Jrue can really be considered a point here.  Then you have people like Josh Hart, KCP and Marcus Smart who are absolutely not point guards.  You clearly exaggerated and your weird defensive appraisals here are all over the map and often wrong.  You couldn’t name 15-20 PGs who were better even when you got rookies and shooting guards."
"&gt; he was 3-4 years older than most prospects  Not compared to those picked around him in the first round. He was around the same age as Lydon (pick 24), Pasecniks (25), Derrick White (29), and Josh Hart (30). He went in the late first for the same reason a ton of guys go in the late first. The difference is he became a much better NBA player than most guys in the late first."
"This is a list of guards who're all within 2 inches of Steph and clearly better defenders - Kyle Lowry, FVV, Fox, Cory Joseph, Schroder, Delon Wright, Hali, Beverley, Jrue, Smart, Conley, Neto, Rubio, Jevon Carter, Kris Dunn, Dinwiddie, Rozier, Donte, Caruso, KCP, Brogdon, Josh Hart."
"The two you mentioned + John Collins, Jarrett Allen, Josh Hart, Dillon Brooks, and Monte Morris are the other guys getting significant rotation play"
Lmao Ingram clear cut star Lolol.  Josh hart a 3&amp;D player that shoots 32% from 3?
I can see why some would say Jaylen Brown is better but it is not as one sided as you make it sound.  Lonzo Ball is not mediocre.  He is at the least a good player at his position especially after he fixed his shooting.  Josh Hart is a solid role player who does his job.  I think it was the best package available.  That being said it is almost impossible to get a fair compensation for a top 5-10 player without include another top player.
"They got Brandon Ingram who turned out be an all star player. Lonzo who is a serviceable PG, and Josh Hart whose a good role player. And they got a bunch of draft picks. The Pels got a good return for AD. Their management just sucks at building teams around high level talents, which is why you have ominous signs from Zion and Lonzo skipped town for Chicago."
"I feel like this is revisionist history with the AD trade. At the time, it was seen as a great haul by NO. Brandon Ingram blossomed and became an all star, Lonzo had a rough first year but showed his potential in his second year in NO, Josh Hart has continued to be a quality rotational player, and they got three first round picks including the 4th overall...they fucked up the 4th pick by trading down and not simply taking Deandre Hunter but that's on NO. It was a quality deal, Boston or New York wasn't going to offer more than the Lakers."
That one with Josh Hart was everywhere on this sub crucifying him for it and I’d be a goddamn liar if I said I wasn’t one of those people.
"For sure. Devontes likely starting PG tho, I think the team needs the upgrade from josh hart and then the starting 5 will look real nice"
The Cavs dont need any 4 year commitments. I'll change my mind if its a josh hart type contract
"My guess is this is similar to the Josh Hart where this is kind of a ""fake"" salary number.  I'm more interested in who the Cavs are sending to Chicago."
Josh Hart?
"Dam I feel like I vaguely remember someone posted after this season that they gave Roy Hibbert their PS4/PS3 during the season.  Like they had photos and everything of Hibbert at their house.  I could be having some crazy fever dream and just making stuff up/mixing it up with josh hart not paying someone for their xbox though, but I seem to remember the post so vividly."
"Umm the East this year is deeper than the West was last year… Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson and Steven Adams just missed the play-in tournament in the West last year… why do we think Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso, Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan and Nikola Vucevic are a sure thing for the playoffs? They SHOULD be a sure thing for the play-in tournament, but anything beyond that is absolutely no sure thing."
"Lakers have the young guns baby, we talking lonzo, kuzma, Ingram, josh hart, dangelo, Jordan Clarkson, mf Alex Caruso, randle, who else am I missing?"
"the Josh Hart deal was ridiculous, it’s the most tradeable contract i’ve ever seen"
"I feel like the Pels had a decent off-season. They got rid of 2 terrible contracts, while upgrading one of those positions. They re-signed Josh Hart to a good deal.   The Lonzo Ball deal was bad, but replacing him with Devonte Graham isn't terrible. They also maintain a lot of future flexibility.   Idk, Pels messed up on Lowry, but the off-season as a whole wasn't bad imo and it's not like the gamble left them in a terrible position for the future."
Honestly both of the ones I'm thinkin about are close to dead even for different reasons. Giannis destroying him happened at the perfect moment during the season between two mvp candidates. And then when Harden hit himself + Josh Hart reaction was beyond hilarious. Compelling storyline vs top tier comedy
"This is definitely conspiracy territory here.  You know who else is repped by CAA?  JJ Reddick, who hates the NO front office (if they're trying to appease Zion's agency, why would that have even risked crossing him?).  Also Josh Hart, who supposedly wanted out because he was close to JJ, but re-signed.  &amp;#x200B;  Then if you go across the state line, you'll find Luka Doncic is repped by Bill Duffy.  Same Bill Duffy Cuban literally wrote a blog article trashing a few years back.  There's probably bad blood there, but it's not going to get in the way of 200 million for Doncic.  &amp;#x200B;  Now, if you want to talk agency conspiracies, there was a period of time when the late Dan Fegan basically repped everyone on the Mavs.  Also, there used to be some trivial around that time that I forget the answer to - but there was one agent who's free agents \*never\* signed with the Rockets.  So probably not coincidence  and some agency collusion that does happen.  But it's not on the scale this article would have you believe."
Don’t want to speak for everyone but yes 100% I support all our baby lakers - I would put Josh hart and Clarkson on the list too.  Some baby lakers I love more than others (ball and Caruso) but ultimately it’s up to personal preference and attachment
Yeah I have three opinions on three different things here. Josh Hart fouling: not good. Ref missing an incredibly obvious foul: not good. Harden drawing the foul call he deserved: makes sense. The fact that the only thing people talk about is Harden drawing the foul is ridiculous to me lol
"Ah, Harden tryna replay what he did to Josh Hart, too bad that shit wont work anymore bud"
Do people really think that isn't a foul on Josh Hart? To me that's the most textbook example of a reach in foul I've ever seen
Boban currently has made the most FGs (5/5) among those at 100% FG%. The rest are mostly just 1/1 while two (Josh Hart and Joshua Primo) are at 2/2.
Josh Hart needs to heal up so we never have to play Temple ever again
"Redick: ""Josh Hart has the worst high-five game in the league."""
The firsts became Rodney Hood and Josh Hart. Decent role players for their draft positions but nothing more.
"They traded a top 5-7 player for not a single absolute. AD got two young stars, a solid role player in Josh Hart, AND a ton of picks"
"Josh Hart hustles but man, if we trade this season he’s the first guy to go clearly"
"Yes because we have better players?  Zion,JV,Graham,BI and Josh Hart are the only players on your roster that should be in the NBA currently."
"so you think lonzo, brandon ingram, josh hart and 3 first round draft picks (including #4 overall) were an underpay?  lonzo BI and josh hart are all playing extremely well right now.  the #4 pick was deandre hunter who is playing extremely well, even if the pelicans flipped him for a bad return"
He's been awesome.  I like how you could see he earned Coach Willie Green's trust very early on in summer league and it's now carried on into regular season after Josh Hart went down.  Coach also liked to run some of his old GSW/Draymond Green plays for him in SL.
"Absolutely shameless. ""Yes this is totally a basketball play that Josh Hart is preventing me from accomplishing""."
"man u r just fuckin sad. players like klay thompson, andre iguadola, josh hart, and many other wing players had to play defense with their hands tied behind their ass and they STILL got fouls called on them because of harden's bullshit. he's a disgrace to the game and i can't wait to watch him get exposed"
Josh Hart is really fun to watch because he’s super expressive and always finds himself in weird situations like that one
Knew it was gonna be that before i clicked it. The Josh Hart one should honestly go into the hall of fame of nba memes.
He did this last year in the playoffs against them. I wish we kept zo Randle Ingram Josh hart and the 4th overall pick instead of getting lebron and AD. Zubac was looking like a great prospect as was svi
At the time they traded Lonzo they were not really sad about it and people wanted Kuzma gone for awhile. Josh Hart was good as a rookie and definitely was a big loss but he’s not really a world beater/hasn’t gotten much better. He should get credit for getting LeBron though which is much more important than anything else.
Josh Hart could be an interesting piece as well.
"Expirings, Graham and Josh Hart"
"imagine if the lakers traded ad for zion, ingram, kuzma, lonzo, and josh hart. i think they'd be unstoppable then"
"I mean, if it happens it won't be because Josh Hart got hurt lol"
"Below are some of the players who are gone now, but were on the Laker’s roster the year before LeBron joined them, and during his first season with the team -    Lonzo Ball    De’Andre Hunter  **Was drafted by Lakers but shipped off in the AD trade.    Ivica Zubac    Thomas Bryant    Brandon Ingram    Kyle Kuzma    Josh Hart    Alex Caruso    KCP    Larry Nance    Julius Randle    Reggie Bullock    Jordan Clarkson    Brook Lopez    LeBron James   I wouldn't mind seeing this team in action."
Josh Hart as well.
"&gt; Does Zion have a vet who is going to do that for him?  Ingram not gonna do that, Valanciunas could but doesnt seem like that type of guy, no way Josh Hart saying anything."
This is how I felt about Josh Hart when he was a Laker.
"John Stockton - ton of dishes in stock  Josh Hart - a Sharpshooter  Zion Williamson = Zion, son of William  Paul George - his two favorite Beatles  Jimmy Butler - he stays serving fools  Austin Rivers - where he goes to find peace"
"JOSH HART - epitomizes playing with heart. Scrappy defender, hustle plays, dives into stands for every loose ball."
De’Aron Fox: Is fast and cunning on the court like a fox   Josh Hart: has a lot of heart on defence   Rodney Hood: came from the hood  James Johnson: has a big johnson   Kendrick Nunn: is religious   Derrick Rose: Rose up several times when being down with injuries   Jay Scrubb: is a scrub / relatively unknown player in the NBA   Colin Sexton: has a ton of sex  Justice Winslow: Has never broken the law/his teams total wins are low when he plays for them

Josh Hart
"I said Josh Hart is Jimmy Butler 2.0 and Jrue Holiday's last contract would age badly, now I'm stuck trying to remember a take I was right about"
We were idiots.   It was so long ago that honestly i don’t remember what my thoughts were.    I do remember when we pissed that pick away trading it for Pacekniks when Josh Hart was sitting there to be picked.    We only got Maxey bc Orlando gave us the pick for Fultz and CP3 led OKC actually had it convey when nobody thought it would.   God bless Muscala in the bubble
"I can’t argue with the first 3 points (I don’t mind losing lonzo but we should’ve got a better return) but I disagree with the 4th. First of all the Jrue picks haven’t had the chance to materialise yet, and in time we can use them on players or ideally package them with our remaining picks and some lakers ones for a 3rd star. Then there’s Hayes, NAW and Didi. Both Jaxson and Nickeil have showed good progress at the end of last year and have a lot of promise as players. I believe both will be more important to us than josh hart this year"

"Imo it’s one of those things you only see if you’re watching *a lot* of basketball and paying attention to various players.  I don’t know about Solomon Hill, I’ll be honest I haven’t watched enough of him to comment on leg diving but I’ll bring up a parallel situation with Josh Hart.  I doubt your average NBA fan thinks Josh Hart is dirty or reckless, but watch him on defense and he will throw his whole body into people for a small chance at the ball (I saw some particularly egregious examples in 2019 I think it was when Lakers played Pelicans but it’s consistent against other teams for the most part).  I bring this up because I doubt there’s any record of “Josh Hart reckless defense” either but I know it’s a real thing that I’ve seen."
Josh Hart with the binary statline
"Josh Hart: talks shit about LA but isn’t clear about it, speaking in general terms  Lonzo: Nods in agreement, but then is confused and asks for elaboration  Hart: Makes it clear he’s talking about LA  Lonzo: “oh, I ain’t gonna say anything about that”"

"Aaron Mintz (agent) and the Lakers don't have a good working relationship historically.   &gt;Traded away: D'Angelo Russell, Josh Hart  &gt;Left in FA: Julius Randle, Trevor Ariza  He also represents Paul George who blue balled the Lakers in the past by saying 'do not trade for me' then saying he was disappointed that the Lakers didn't trade for him.   &gt;https://twitter.com/ericpincus/status/1013910550974222337?s=21  &gt;Eric Pincus: The Lakers' relationship with Aaron Mintz of CAA was not a fruitful one - poor mutual experience with D'Angelo Russell, Lakers' prioritized cap room over an extension for Randle, benched him, etc. - George didn't give Lakers a meeting.

Josh Hart and Alex Caruso are better selections   It’s worth noting the other young guys on that list  have not made any impactful Playoffs appearances or any appearance at all.   DLo was a bum in his first and only Playoff debut with the Nets, Kuzma was absolute dogshit against the Suns last year, Randle was legit awful in the Hawks series. Zubac didn’t look too good against the Mavs.. Larry Nance and Jordan Clarkson were not ready and just not that good on that 2018 Cavs run with LeBron leading the way"
Josh Hart
"Willie Green is getting closer to understanding the best players on his roster.  Though he still has Josh Hart (not) guarding Bojan Bogdanovich and, predictably, hemorraghing threes.  Someday the Pelicans might start playing their best players in their best roles. And not playing their worst players in any role."
Him and josh hart have basically identical stats this year except hart is more efficient without demar and lavine to draw away defenders
"I cry every night thinking about what could have been with  * checks notes * Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, and a late first rounder"
"Everyone on the team is being asked to do much more than they are capable of because there is a lack of talent, ball handling, and offense creation available to the team. Josh Hart has played well relative to what is expected of him sure. Same for Herb, but herb is a second round rookie averaging 5 and 4 like let’s be real for a minute."
"I disagree. Josh Hart has not sucked ass and, on defense at least, neither has Herbalife Jones."
"for pelicans fans (there's not much games to choose from) i think our game against the wizards last night was just amazing. so many threes, such beautiful ball movement, and josh hart hitting an **and1 halfcourt buzzer beater** was just the cherry on top"
"BI most talented, but Josh Hart is the best."
Josh Hart is the most underrated player in the NBA
"Just pathetic. And to think the Lakers once had Brandon Ingram, Jordan Clarkson, Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart - all of whom are decent to good players. All traded away."
I root against Josh Hart because he still owes that guy money for buying his xbox
Josh Hart is the very definition of role-player. He’s this generation’s Kent Bazemore.
"1. Zion   2. Ingram  3. JV  4. Herb Jones  5. Josh Hart  6. Graham  7. Murphy   8. Whoever the fuck you think has the most upside out of NAW, Hayes, and Kira"
Josh Hart is going to beat someone up.
"i only remember the zo and bi hate i always had positive interactions on here with people about kuz, jc6, nance and even josh hart until we became real contenders, maybe i just wasn’t on here enough tho  but yeah 100% of our guys get more love soon as they on another team"
"I saw T-Pain at the halftime show of the 2018 California Classic in Golden 1 and it was sick the stage area outside is awesome. Two exhibition games and T-Pain for like $27.  I got to see super young Fox, Bagley, Adabayo, Derrick Jones, Caruso, Josh Hart, and Jimmer was on the Knicks."
"Outside of the big 3, the only role players that would have any value on the trade market are THT, and *maybe* Malik Monk.  They would have to target older role players on bad teams out of playoff contention looking to sell. So maybe THT for Terrence Ross?  Or Daniel House + Nwaba from Houston to improve their defence? Josh Hart from the Pelicans?  I’m curious how Laker fans still value THT. I think his trade value was a lot higher one or two seasons ago."
Josh Hart
Josh Hart. Easily most tradable contract in the league
"Honestly, Josh Hart"
&gt; The Pelicans could make a late push for the Play In when Zion returns but if they don’t I see Josh Hart as a decent Trade piece for them  I am proactively mad at them for not being sellers at the deadline
Josh Hart coming up huge. Can’t get a call apparently
JOSH HART  MOST IMPROVED
Josh Hart. Is awesome. And so is his contract.
Herb Jones and Josh Hart baby
Herb Jones and Josh Hart put PG in lock and key and the rest of the team ran out of gas (aside from Batum hitting a couple of 3s.) Pelicans went on about a 10-0 run at the start of the 3rd.
What did Nick Young and Josh Hart do?
Damn that's really cool OP thanks for the write up. Shit like this shows that some of these guys know this game is more than just basketball. Fuck Nick Young. Fuck Josh Hart
Josh hart isn't a crypto powerforward.
"Dude this is why we only have two wins.  The majority of the season has been missing all star BI, injured starter Josh Hart, and defensive linchpin Herb Jones which has caused NOLA to start players that should have had 0 minutes.  Now that everyone is back in the lineup, the Pels will hopefully start to find some chemistry and get the league off of our back.  Chances are it will still be a dumpster fire until Zion returns, but we haven't really had a fair chance to see what this squad can do."
"In honor of the Staples center name change, here’s the All Ugly-Ass NFT Ape Twitter Avatar Team, or the Right-Click Save-As Superstars.   PG: Steph Curry SG: Seth Curry SF: Tyrese Halliburton  PF: Josh Hart C: Rudy Gobert  GM’ed by Daryl Morey.   All these players have NFT avatars on Twitter.  Obviously this team is incredibly small, but that’s only fitting for such a forward-looking group. I could’ve used Tobias Harris at the 4 but I wanted to take them from all different teams for varieties sake."
Brandon Ingram and Josh Hart are crying rn
Josh Hart is probably begging Griffin to trade him back to LA so he can be able to play in Crypto arena. That dude is obsessed with NFTs and crypto

"After watching Lonzo, Brandon, Josh and Alex today and in previous games this season here is my ranking of the 2017-2019 Lakers ""core""  Brandon Ingram  Kyle Kuzma = Lonzo Ball  Alex Caruso = Josh Hart"
"I thought David Griffin was good, but it’s clear he isn’t. Pelicans are ran like trash, ownership only gives a shit about the Saints. If Josh Hart got his name changed to “Drew Brees”, maybe the ownership would start caring."
"Ah I see another who's been tricked by David Griffin, listen it's gonna be hard to trade Zion, I got him and I'm in a 9 cat league and it's tough even getting Josh Hart for him, it's gonna be long season bud."
Josh Hart back
Josh Hart is dr.pepper neither root beer nor cola. Neither Center nor point guard He just play basketball
Imagine Josh Hart in a Lakers jersey. Sounds crazy
"the lineup numbers for the Pelicans starters have been incredible. Any time JV, Devonte, Josh Hart, and NAW have shared the court the Pelicans have been very good, their issues this season have come when they've had to play Kira Lewis Jr. and Naji Marshall real minutes."
Josh Hart has the weirdest fuckin stat lines
"Because of when they extended JV they literally can’t trade him this year. It sucks cause he’s the only player that’s not really young that would get a decent return on the trade market. Someone like Josh Hart/Devonte Graham probably only gets you some 2nd round picks.  Letting Lonzo go was so dumb. He’s a great fit next to Zion &amp; BI, and they got along great.   Honestly their best bet is to just fill out tank this year (already off to a great start lol) and hope to get Banchero/Holmgren in the draft."
josh hart is a solid two way player too even if he doesn't put up huge scoring stats
"For me it comes from living in New Orleans. Josh hart embraced the city pretty quick, moved in and enjoyed it . Folks see Zion around, and while BI is quite has done a lot for the city. I don’t even know if zo moved to the city. It’s a pretty small city, you notice when you see folks around. There’s also that clip from his reality show before he got traded where he just looked uncomfortable and said the city was too old."
There’s a chance the Pelicans get Banchero and have Zion-BI-Banchero-Josh Hart?!  My goodness
"I understand with Zion and BI back that moves things around but the Pelicans have to have the worst bench in the league.  Kira has been such a disappointment this year. He is just not putting it together.  Trey hasn't replicated his pre-season form but he's a rookie so nbd.  Hayes looked great at the end of last season, this year he has been sporadically spastic. Would like to see him take a 3 per game, and make more of an impact on the defensive end.  Sato should get ZERO minutes. Seriously.  Naji looked like a Josh Hart replacement last year, this year he has looked like a G-Leaguer.  At least Herb brings the energy and discipline."
How did Josh Hart get ejected? Two techs?
"They have developed players though, they just didn't have time to see it through because of injuries + Lebron/AD forcing a trade greatly accelerating the timeline.  BI went from legitimately looking like a bust to averaging 20/6/3 the second half of his final year. Julius put up one of his most efficient years ever (16/8 in 27 minutes). Josh Hart, Larry Nance Jr, and Alex Caruso all became solid rotation players. Other players like DLo and Lonzo just kept getting sidelined by injuries.  Not to mention the Lakers developing two of the rawest prospects ever in Kobe and Andrew Bynum."
"As a spurs fan, I think Pop should move on  Still a great coach, but he should either move to the front office or take a back seat.  Going win-now mode and getting Demar after the Kawhi debacle was a gigantic mistake. We wasted 3 years, didn’t do anything, and he refused to play our young guys and let them figure it out (what we’re doing now).  Especially if Lonzo/BI/Josh Hart was on the table. Honestly, I would’ve been happy with 2 out of the 3 and a pick. BI would have flourished in SA (I think so). Been high on him since his rookie year.  But he knows more basketball than I’ll ever forget. So yeah. Big homer take is that our coach is great, but not good for right now"
"patty mills, maybe andrew bogut at some point.  josh jackson, josh hart, josh richardson, etc etc.."
"Out of curiosity, I wanted to see exactly what return the Pels got in return, so I tried to follow the trades:  - **CP3**: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, al-Farouq Aminu, 2012 Pick (Austin Rivers). Of these players, none re-signed with the Pels. Rivers was later traded along with Russ Smith for Quincy Pondexter (did not play for NOLA, due to injury) and a 2015 2nd (pick 56, Branden Dawson, traded to LAC for $$$). - **Anthony Davis**: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, the 4th overall pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), a 2021 protected first-round pick (did not convert), the right to swap 2023 first-round picks, a 2024 first-round pick, and cash    - **Ball** was sign-and-traded for Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, a 2024 2nd, and cash.   - NOLA would flip the 4th pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), for pick 8 (Jaxson Hayes), pick 17 (Nickeil Alexander-Walker) pick 35 (Didi Louzada) - as well as a protected 2020 pick, which did not appear to convert.  - Christian Wood was waived.  - **Jrue Holiday**: Return was Eric Bledsoe, 2025 &amp; 2027 first round picks, 2024 &amp; 2026 pick swap rights.  - Eric Bledsoe was later traded alongside Steven Adams, Ziaire Williams &amp; rights to Jared Butler in exchange for: Jonas Valančiūnas, and rights to Trey Murphy &amp; Brandon Boston.   - Brandon Boston would later be moved to the Clippers in exchange for Sacramento's 2022 second round pick (protected).   So in exchange for ""this crop"" the Pels got:    - Brandon Ingram - Garrett Temple - Tomas Satoransky - Jaxon Hayes - Nickeil Alexander-Walker - Didi Louzada - Jonas Valančiūnas - Trey Murphy  Draft picks picks picks:    - **From the AD trade**: LAL's 2024 first rounder, and right to swap 2023 first rounders. - **From the Jrue Holiday trade**: Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 firsts, right to swap 2024 &amp; 2026 firsts with Milwaukee, Sacramento's 2022 2nd round pick (protected). - **From the Lonzo Ball trade**: Chicago's 2024 2nd  Out of these, Ingram and Valančiūnas stand out, obviously - but Alexander-Walker is alright, and man that's a lot of firsts."
"Yup you’re absolutely right, however it is intriguing how many great prospects the Lakers have drafted in the last decade that went on to play decent minutes for other teams (obviously in order to trade for players like AD):  Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson, Dangelo Russell, Larry Nance, Ivica Zubac, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Thomas Bryant, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart, Alex Caruso, Mo Wagner, Svi Mykhailiuk"

I think he it did to Josh Hart twice!
Thank you! It was so annoying watching his bitch ass hook player’s arms and then go into his shooting motion to draw a foul. Mfer had Josh Hart playing with his hands behind his back.
Josh Hart somewhere out there smiling.
Josh hart giving him the business tonight
What made you say Josh Hart? Lol
Free Zion and Josh Hart
NGL I could see like josh hart or ja morant choosing to wear some 80s type shorts
"Any examples of a ""LeGM"" trade that ended up being tragic, in which the team sacrificed valuable young players / future assets for a win-now move?  I just reject the premise that keeping Lonzo and Ingram, for example, was the path to a dynasty. ""Yea sure we won a title, but man Josh Hart would be a really nice 3&amp;D piece for the next few years"" is just a mindset I can't fathom lol  The idea that you can plan on a *dynasty* is just not a thing. It's rare enough to be in striking distance of a single title."
"I mean their fans are in a perpetual state of mass delusion. They have so many fans and so many nba voices cater to their fans that they are able to tune out any unpleasant reality they choose. I remember for years being told that kuzma was a future star, that jordan clarkson was a future all star, josh hart was so great, blah blah blah. They are always full of these guys who project to be the role players whose name nobody would know if they weren't lakers but I have to hear about them like they're future all stars. Look at how they've handled their draft picks over the last 10 years and try to argue they aren't a horribly run franchise. The off season debacles they've had in recent years only follows that. The fact that Lebron came to the Lakers and he got AD to demand his way to the lakers is the only reason they've become a winning team again."
Except that’s not at all what roberson did lol  Imagine trying to use something josh hart did 3 years ago for 1 possession as an indication of anything
This game's got all the short rebound kings. Josh Hart has 8
"josh hart is a starter quality player  devonte and NAW should be playing better than this, which falls partially on the coaching.  no real adjustments being made.   kira lewis jr. is a talented player he should be having a better game  and the defense is like 75% bad scheming and bad communication here.   the turnovers are bad coaching.  the lack of being able to get turnovers from GSW is also bad coaching because better teams can do it  like taylor jenkins and the grizzlies coaching staff wouldn't be 1-9 and they would give GSW a good fight in this game.  budenholzer wouldn't be 1-9"
"josh hart is legit, one of the brighter spots on this pelicans team"
Saw your flair and thought it was going to be jason josh hart but this is so much better. Thank you!
"josh hart low key having a great game, would like to see him more involved in the offense though"
"Just wait, honestly. There's nothing else to do. Eventually, Zion and BI will be on the floor with Devonte Graham and Trey Murphy who are both pretty good shooters, and one of NAW, Josh Hart, or Herb Jones, who bring varying levels of slashing, playmaking, and defense.   Our team looks like ass right now because our 6-8 are playing 3-5 right now. The very end of our bench plays significant minutes every game. Hopefully Zion comes back healthy and in shape, and if not, I honestly don't know where they'll go from there."
josh hart gonna be the next process-era laker to break out
josh hart elite transition defense moment
"Woof, Josh Hart with the turnover at the exact moment Fitz is saying how great he is"
Where’s Ingram and Josh Hart?
Josh Hart is right there with you
That's why they paid Josh Hart.
"76ers fans are talking about building packages for MVP or superstar talent and y'all don't seem to comprehend how shit most of your role players are. None of them have superstar potential. None of them quiet frankly have star potential. Look at what AD netted the Pelicans:  Lonzo, Ingram, Josh Hart, two first round picks and de'andre hunter  Lonzo and Ingram were top 5 picks and Ingram became an all-star. Hunter has been serviceable in the league and Lonzo is a really solid point guard. You guys think sending first or second year players drafted in 20s and beyond are going to be stars? Really? Fucking delusional homers."
"What about Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart and 3 firsts? You'd think that's better than a single player, right?"
"I wouldn't consider Westbrook to be a superstar at this stage of his career.   I think the better comparison is Anthony Davis. The Lakers gave up Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, and 3 first round picks.  Then promptly won a title."
"I guess they share an agent, but I don't really see why Reddick would have any idea what Zion's thinking in this regard.  He wasn't reported to be close to Zion or anything.  Just Josh Hart (who he also shares an agent with)."
"Nice list OP!  While not current NBA players, I found this interesting.  Only 10 players in the NBA played in high school in Maine.  All 10 were from the same high school, Maine Central Institute.  Sam Cassell, Caron Butler, Cutino Mobley, and Brad Miller came from that high school.  Since others asked, here's current players who played high school ball in D.C. (in alphabetical order):  Saddiq Bey  Luka Garza  Josh Hart  Jamorko Pickett"
Cole Anthony rebounding like (last year’s) Josh Hart

Rubio did that for an entire series.  Josh Hart did it too.
Please refer me to the rule that allowed for the foul on Josh Hart.
"What a fucking straw-man argument you're making, wow. Nobody is saying Harden ""single-handedly"" controlled the league. They're saying he manipulated the rules to his benefit. You can't watch the clip of Josh Hart getting hooked by Harden and possibly try to argue that he was fouled. That wasn't an isolated incident, either.  Not sure why you're being such a chode about it."
Year one he didn’t play w/ another “Superstar”  Lonzo Ball  Michael Beasley  Isaac Bonga  Reggie Bullock  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  Alex Caruso  Tyson Chandler  Josh Hart  Andre Ingram  Brandon Ingram  Jemerrio Jones  Kyle Kuzma  Scott Machado  JaVale McGee  Mike Muscala  Svi Mykhailiuk  Rajon Rondo  Lance Stephenson  Moritz Wagner  Johnathan Williams  Ivica Zubac
"Larry Nance, Clarkson, Kuzma, Caruso, THT, Josh Hart, Zubac, and Thomas Bryant were all later picks (or undrafted in Caruso's case). That's a pretty good track record."
All the ex-Lakers continue to make me proud 🥲  Except for Josh Hart 😂
"Crazy three team Simmons trade goes down at the deadline.  Portland Receives: Simmons and Josh Hart  Philadelphia Receives: Ingram   New Orleans Receives: CJ McCollum and RoCo, Philadelphia FRP"
Steven Adams must be mistaking Josh Hart for Russ now if he's pulling 7 and a half boards
Ah yes Josh Hart must be statpadding rebounds too I guess
"Are you really trying to compare Josh Hart playing a video game to guys like Bo Jackson, Danny Ainge, and Deion Sanders? Deion played two pro sports on the same day I’m pretty sure, that’s impressive. I’m not sure Josh Hart logging onto Twitch after an NBA game is near the same thing as being a two sport pro athlete."
"If you assume that popularity should be the same as all time rankings, then yeah Steph moves up but Stockton takes a nose dive and Bird moves down. But Dirk probably moves up as does Nash. I could go further down the list but it seems pretty close to a wash. There are also random white players with abnormally large fanbases like Brian Scalabrine or Steve Novak but you also black players like J.R. Smith, Nick Young or even Josh Hart."
"Every Nova boys except Spellman have been excellent role players and some with star potential   Donte, Mikal, Brunson, Paschall, Josh Hart, rookie Saddiq Bey"
"Ingram and Randle.  Dlo is budget steph and josh hart is budget klay.  That team would be spooky, especially if they had 2 quality guards in the bench in lonzo and clarkson, and a quality big man in nance jr."
"The Lakers have missed the playoffs 11 times total since 1947, have been to more finals than any other team, have won more titles than any other team, and have a reputation over decades of taking care of their stars.   If that's not well run, I don't know what the fuck is. The Lakers are probably the most consistently well run sports franchise in America over the last 40 years.   You idiots latch on to the 5 years the team was bad after the team's franchise player had a career-ending injury and they were tanking to judge the franchise lmao, it's hilarious.   Even then, the assets the team acquired while they were bad were all attractive pieces that helped the team get a star. Jordan Clarkson is a rotation player. Brandon ingram is a future star. Josh Hart is good. Lonzo Ball is good. Larry Nance is good. Randle is good. Zubac was good. Moe Wagner is good. Thomas Bryant is good.   Alex Caruso was developed from a g-leaguer to a fantastic rotation player.  Talen-Horton Tucker is good. The Lakers' scouting found all these guys. Is that not part of being well run? Any team could have had any of those guys and used them.  The Lakers drafted well and made good trades to get out from the terrible Mozgov and Deng contracts. They didn't get a single free agent meeting when they were terrible. Only once ownership changed and the team improved did they even have a chance at LeBron. The league is a meritocracy; when the Lakers were bad they couldn't even get a meeting with LaMarcus fucking aldridge of all people.   You guys shat on all the moves Pelinka made last off-season and look what happened? The team won a title and was built extraordinarily well. Then he turns around and makes smart moves *again* to make the team better.   I'm not trying to hear any salty fucking nonsense about the Lakers not being well run. This isn't Mitch Kupchak and Jimmy Buss' regime anymore. The new management has consistently made the right decisions and turned the team around. The scouting department hit on pick after pick after pick. Keep holding on to those 4 or 5 years when the team was bad because you're showing your age. The Lakers have consistently been excellently well run, and it will continue now that Pelinka and Jeanie ousted those fucking bozos."

Pelicans trade for Lowry is interesting...Bledsoe in for money matching. Then probably Jason Hayes and Josh Hart as assets to round out the package. Is that appealing enough?
"Lakers traded him to the rocket for Corey Brewer  and a first.  That first wound up being 28, which the Lakers traded to the jazz for picks 30 and 46.  Selected Josh Hart at 30 and Thomas Bryant at 46.    I don't really care that he once played for the lakers haha.  They have Harrell now so that's who I'm worried about."
"Lou once played for you guys too, ya know.  IIRC you guys even got a 1st round pick for trading him and that 1st round pick turned into Kuzma (or was it Josh Hart?)."
Yeah the game where McConnell assaulted Josh Hart
Josh Hart is a very valuable player. Such a “Glue Guy”. Brings the energy and effort.
"i see a lot of players with a chance honestly   Jarrett Allen and LeVert, Josh Hart, Harrell, Boucher, Dragon, Haliburton, LaMelo, Ingles, Clarkson, Derrick White, Bogdan, Gallo, Bertans"
"&gt; oh hes a clippers fan. I understand now.  Lol reductive comments to the point of flair attacks is pointless and just shows you're not ready to discuss anything at length. I don't call you out on being a Lakers fan despite these absolutely asinine opinions:  &gt; That core plus Kawhi (ignoring that a 2nd star would have come) is better than the current roster the clips have.   Kawhi, BI, Lonzo, and Josh Hart is not better than the current Clippers team. That's just downright stupid... Also, what 2nd star? Any star you would've gotten that offseason if Kawhi signed would've had to be from trades, so bye bye your young core. Maybe understand context better instead of bringing up all these ridiculous possibilities  And how are you going to call Kawhi plus that young core a contender when Bron plus that young core was definitely not a contender.   &gt; And guess who is looking to make a deep playoff run? You guessed it, the Pelicans.  Pels are not looking to make a deep playoff run, they're looking to make the playoffs.  Which goes back to the only argument, which is that Jeanie Buss is being overrated for her contributions to the Lakers organization, when Bron has done all of this."
"&gt;testament to their scouting  Now list Thomas Bryant, Larry Nance Jr., Josh Hart, Zubac, THT, Clarkson, Svi...all starting level to legit rotational pieces in the league picked in the late 1st to 2nd round. Discrediting scouting because of one #2 pick is laughable. Lonzo was also a consensus #2 pick. You can't have it both ways."
6th man  as long shot would be Josh Hart.. He is absolutely ball in in that role so far. Alec Burks too from Knicks
"Lakers FT shooting curse must be real. That team was so fucking bad at free throws: Kuzma, Ingram, Randle, Lonzo, Brook Lopez, Josh Hart, even KCP was under 80% that year. And then they brought in LeBron lmao probably the most famous poor shooting FT super star (non-big).  Luckily AD and KCP broke the curse."
PG: Gilbert Arenas  SG: Kobe Bryant  SF: LeBron James  PF: Draymond Green  C: Hamed Haddadi  6th man: Josh Hart  Head Coach: Scott Brooks  This could work under the cap if the timings with bird rights were on.
"**Josh Hart:** 10 years into his career and finally gets to the NBA finals, champagne everywhere  **high five:** \**missed\**"
"It's 2021, and Josh Hart is still not getting his high fives."
Josh Hart also didn’t get the high-5. All is right in the universe.
Josh Hart has always been underrated.   Just don't sell him a switch.
"Yeah but they've also hit on a few lower picks and got solid players at the bottom. Zubac, Thomas Bryant, Alex Caruso, Josh hart and Kyle kuzma are all guys they've found who have become solid players in the NBA. And that's just from the past few years. Admittedly Josh hart and Thomas Bryant were draft day trades but still. Credit where credit is due, Lakers scouting department is elite."
"The trade may have turned out to be one of the most fair trades ever. Truth is that for it to work out for the Lakers it had to result in a championship or it would’ve been a loss. They got the chip and the peels now have Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, and Josh Hart plus picks to go with Zion. The Pelicans may come out ahead in the long run depending on how good of a job the FO does to keep this squad together and win championships.   Either way it worked out pretty well for both teams"
Josh Hart bullied David West into retirement
Josh hart is a good defensive player in general. If I recall he gave David West problems when West tried posting up on him
He didn’t touch Josh Hart
Man I hope we can keep Josh Hart for the long haul. Dude plays with some Heart . ( see what I did there) but for real tho he needs to stay around a while.
"You mean when he was with Brandon fucking Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Kuzma, Rondo, KCP, and co? They were at least proven NBA players who had couple of seasons under their belt, we are fielding undrafted players, rookies ans G-leaguers, come on man."

"Look Josh Hart doesn't need to do a goddamn thing in this world beyond reacting to a failed beardicide attempt. His legacy is sealed, he is a star forever."
"I've seen possessions where Zion never touches the ball and fucking Jackson Hayes gets a play set up for him by Josh Hart, I see 0 reasons by Reddick shouldn't be given more shots if they wanna fuck around like that"
LeBron with BI and another playmaker like Zo who can play d and make 3s. Josh Hart is also a solid role player.  Can you imagine?
So... Josh Hart
How tf has no one mentioned Josh Hart. Absolutely elite rebounder at the guard position
"I'm a fan of Brunson's for sure. All those Villanova guards and wings can play. Josh Hart is another player I considered, solid defender averaging 7.5 boards in 28 mins as a G/F."
"No lie, Zion is a good rebounder, but he's an unselfish player so he lets guys like Josh Hart get some when he can easily snag two or three more. He's not Westbrook."
I want Josh Hart to be in 6MOY discussions
"Oh I'm sorry I thought Zion was supposed to be a generational talent...now you're telling me he can't get more boards because **Josh Hart** lol?   Rebounding and defense, particularly rim protection,  is something he needs to provide to be great.    Otherwise there will always be spacing issues because it's extremely difficult to find a floor spacing big that rebounds and defends the rim to pair next to Zion."
"What? I'm a Pelicans fan. He has gotten better recently, but he is absolutely one of the worst defenders on the team season wise lol. Dude was and still sometimes is the complete opposite of active. What are you talking about? I don't get how you can write this without even mentioning Josh Hart. You don't watch Zion play."
carrying on the josh hart legacy
"We have Steven Adams who is averaging 9 rebounds and Josh Hart, who is one of, if not, the best rebounding 2 in the league, dude is averaging 8 rebounds off the bench. Zion just doesn't have the opportunity to grab boards because those guys got it covered for the most part"
"Hernangomez is looking pretty good; he’s not as physical as Adams but he can score pretty well.   Also, Josh Hart for 6MOY. he brings so much energy off the bench"
"Those are incomplete numbers for this analysis.  Do the math on available attempts.  Some of those players played with Bryant -- good luck getting more than a couple shots a game in that situation -- and as shown by this very post, the Lakers were deep with young players who need lots of chances to figure out what works for them, and what doesn't.  Ingram: 11.5 FGA in Los Angeles, 17.8 in New Orleans  Clarkson: 12.6 FGA in LA, 13.4 in Utah  Russell:: 12.7 FGA in LA, 17 in Brooklyn, 19 in Golden State, and 17 in Minnesota  Ball: 10.3 in LA, 11.2 in New Orleans  Nance: 5.4 in LA, 7.3 in Cleveland  Randle: 10.6 in LA, 16 in New York  Russell, Nance, Randle, and Ingram have also seen their minutes rise since heading east.  There's only one ball ( lower-case ), and it's tough to develop that many players ( and Thomas Bryant, and Ivica Zubac and Josh Hart and Kyle Kuzma and Mo Wagner ) in such a short span -- especially when you have Bryant and James.  There are recent ex-Lakers all over the league in part because they just drafted so many good players that they had logjams everywhere -- and that probably hurt almost all of them, to so degree or another."
Josh Hart also became the best rebounder of all time
"I'd be curious to see how good an All-""Former Young Lakers Players"" team would look in current day. The lineup would be something like:  PG: D'Angelo Russell/Lonzo Ball  SG: Jordan Clarkson/Josh Hart  SF: Brandon Ingram/David Nwaba  PF: Julius Randle/Larry Nance Jr.  C: Ivaca Zubac/Thomas Bryant"
"Lakers in 2017, the game vs Houston and literally no reason they had a double OT game and it was a good game for sure.  Aside from that, Josh Hart led the lakers past the Clippers dropping like 30 in the last game."
"But Josh Hart is more marketable, right"
If you are or anyone else is interested you might be thinking of josh hart guarding james harden with his hands behind his back
"man please. Josh Hart is 6’5 and he gobbled up 17 boards the other day  even a PJ Brown would be the biggest dude on most teams. guys used to drive into 6’9 beefy guys and now we got tiny little guards shooting floaters and flipping, it’s boating"
I feel bad for teams that don't have Josh Hart on their roster.
JOSH HART
Josh Hart steals rebounds like Taysom Hill steals TDs
"Don't know about often but im sure most guards with solid handles could if they wanted to.. Think the laker was Jordan Clarkson or Josh Hart  E: mb, thats zo2, going blind lol"
"We NEEDED an excellent interior defender. Favors had a foot out the door which meant Josh Hart was our next best rim protection if Jrue left. Our offense is irrelevant if people can just hit practice layups on us with no difficulty at all. Plus, you don't *need* to shoot to space. If Adams is open, he can set an easy screen and get someone else an open look. All that said, yes please give us KP that would be ridiculous"
Why is this a Josh hart impression?
You'll like Josh Hart then
Bruh. Josh Hart doesn’t hold a candle to Kuz lmao
Josh Hart wtf hahahaha
Kuz is tall man way different from josh hart grabbing those boards. Good shit fron kuzma tho. Looked sharper besides the trezz thing
When I think 20/10 I think Josh Hart fuck that Tim Duncan dude
No one in the world looks at 20/10 off the bench and calls it Josh Hart-esque except OP's corny ass
"Combination of Mikal Bridges, Josh Hart, and Eric Paschall. Just some random guys I chose for no reason."
"i think they're pretty small too, position for position  bledsoe is 6'1, zion is short for a 4  josh hart seems to be one of their go to defenders and he's like 6'4   bunch of the other noname guys they run out also looked very small"
"eh idk about clearly, Josh Hart went pretty close to straight up. I say that's good defense."
"Josh Hart the only one to stay for handshakes, I guess coz his own team leaves him hanging lol"
"josh hart doesn't seem to be finding his place on D, I can't tell if he's just getting switched on or flat-out beat but he's always a step behind :("
To stop Josh Hart breaking rebounding records.
"Of course his game's gotten better but I think more importantly Kuz just grew up mentally. He came in rookie year with no pressure and just gunned away. Even when Bron joined up he still had that sort of ""fuck it tunnel vision"" mode for a while. And don't get me wrong he's never gonna become Magic or anything, but the shift was when he decided to focus on a few areas that the team needs. BI and Lonzo were gonna be gone for sure. But between Josh Hart and Kuz, I think Lakers fought to keep him because they realized that while Josh already had the mindset of a role player, he wasn't gonna get particularly better at anything (I know because I've watch NOLA games for nostalgia's sake). Kuz on the other hand could and did focus on his D, rebounding, and 3s to become the far more reliable role player he is today. Just a matter of accepting your role and refining your game along the way.  The contract no doubt helped with settling him down too I think. Good for him."
"Well the Lakers were the 4th seed in the West and were absolutely steamrolling the KD Warriors on Christmas Day until LeBron got hurt in that game (and Rondo did as well). And then Lonzo got hurt and was out for the season. And then Ingram developed a blood clot and was done for the season. And then Josh Hart had knee problems and he was done for the season. Weird that the Lakers didn't keep winning without all those guys around though, huh?  Also, the Lakers are 4-1 this year in games that AD has missed, but I guess his cheering is a big reason why they kept winning without him, huh?"
"They should give Lonzo ball, Brandon Ingram, and Josh Hart a ring too. Those guys had a bigger contribution than Cousins. If it weren’t for those three the Lakers wouldn’t had gotten AD."
Josh Hart inspired him
Whoever was on Josh Hart throughout the game is a total clown. I wouldn't be surprised if it was Eric Gordon (who's never heard of a rebound).
Josh Hart was a part of the only team to deny Lebron a postseason
"I know a lot of people were heaping dirt on this Pelicans team after that terrible road trip, but the fact is that they're extremely young and this season is highly irregular; some streaky-ness is to be expected.  The effort level and defensive consistency has improved tremendously recently. It's really encouraging to see. The ball is flowing a lot more on offense as well and guys seem to trust each other. I think missing training camp and some regularity really derailed the first few weeks for these guys, but everyone seems to be buying in and starting to learn how to play with each other.  Josh Hart is one of the most underappreciated guys on the Pels. He does so many little things well and plays hard all the time. When you add up all of his qualities--three-point shooting, running and attacking the rim in transition, tremendous rebounding, a surprising amount of rim defense, the ability to attack a closeout, and a willing passer--you realize how valuable he is, and how well he would fit into the rotation on any team. It'll be interesting to see what kind of contract it takes to retain him this offseason.  I feel like NAW will be a quality three point shooter in time, despite not showing that in the league so far. If he can get his shot to start dropping, I think he'll play a long time in this league."
"It’s because Josh Hart has a lot of heart.... Ok, I’ll see myself out."
That’s different than what I was saying. The commenter above me said Josh Hart is “Lebron Stopper 2.0”  Jordan Clarkson will never shut down Lebron defensively.
"He doesn’t share a lot of minutes with Adams. And with this game, he mostly shared minutes with Willy. Adams does box out, but Josh Hart legit is a great rebounder"
"Uses to call him Josh ""Charles Barkley"" Hart"

I think you mean Josh Hart is a palindrome for Bill Russell /s
Shit we could use a little Josh Hart on the Nets rn
"isn't josh hart strong as hell too? i think i remember him guarding david west and david west said damn i can't move this guy, its time to retire"
Josh Hart averages more rebounds than most players in the league. It's his job on this team
Josh “Keyboard Man gets paid” Hart
Josh “All Hustle All” Hart
They were going to trade Kuzma but the Pelicans refused unless they added future sixth man of the year Josh Hart.
Rockets made Josh Hart look like Mutombo and made Big Willy Styles look like Mini Zion.
Josh Hart had 17 rebounds. The fuck?
Josh Hart might just be the ultimate hustle guy in the league
Josh Hart is every rebounding bigs nightmare matchup
If Josh Hart was like 6'10 he'd be averaging like 20 boards a game.
Bill Russell  spends his retirement playing Basketball under the pseudonym Josh Hart
This is a Josh Hart appreciation thread
Josh hart might be the best player in the league tbh
Josh Hart with a Joel Embiid stat line! Zion with 20/5/7 in only 21 minutes thanks to the refs. 4 wins in a row baby!  ###[YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS !!!](https://youtu.be/3SQa48DcX1E)
Fun Fact Josh Hart is actually an anagram for Bill Russell.
Josh Hart is the true star on this team
"Josh ""Steven Adams"" Hart"
"K Hustle will always give you quality minutes; the plays that don’t show up on the stat sheet. We have Josh Hart as that guy now, but I still miss Kenny."
Noone ever said Josh Hart would be a superstar. Kuz and Zo yes but stop bullshitting.
"As someone who spends way too much time on lakers boards, **no one** ever said that Josh Hart was a future superstar lmao."
Maybe lonzo. Kuz and josh hart are a strawman lol
"On the other hand, people were convinced that Kuz, Lonzo Ball, and Josh Hart were future superstars just because they were lakers"
Josh Hart
My starting 5 would be: PG: Luka ($1 billion) SG: Hardaway Jr. ($20m) F: Gallinari ($20m) F: Josh Hart ($20m) C: Andre Drummond ($30m)  I like this unlimited cap space idea I’m definitely winning a chip with that lineup
"I take back what I said because this is a team that chose fucking TJ Leaf instead of OG Anunoby, John Collins, Kyle Kuzma, Jarrett Allen, and Josh Hart so they're gonna fuck up the lottery pick too I bet"
I would've gladly taken that High Five even if it injures me - Josh Hart
"We know he had the potential. At least the ones that stuck with the team when they sucked bad. He showed flashes. Then his 2nd and 3rd year he played amazing after the all star break. But both were cut short due to injuries. His current play does not surprise us one bit. Josh Hart, Russell both does not surprise us too.  I'd say the biggest gamble was most probably Lonzo. Mostly due to him getting injured constantly and his shot. But we knew he was a great ball mover, unselfish as fuck and was a great defender. I'm really happy he's figured it out and is showing what he can do. The Lakers under Ryan West did well with the draft."
Finally they start the real MVP Josh Hart over that scrub Zoin
"Prince and Garland are out but, hey, Nance and Love are back on the team! Anyway, so here are the likely lineups for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Confirmed Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (14-22) | [](/NOP)Pelicans (15-22) ---|---   C.

"Garty Trent Jr would require like 2 decent to good first rounders to be traded lol, I also think:   Josh Hart - late first and a second or two,   Lonzo Ball - a first rounder or two,   Collins - a decent, mabye low lottery first   Others I am not really sure, but I think seconds would be enough. Oladipo is a 1 year rental, can't see Fournier being that expensive, Mills is definetely not worth a first at this point and Markkanen is Porzingis-esque injury prone."
"Which playoff team would start him? He is a RFA with probably not much room to grow. Giving up a 1st and either having to pay him or let him walk (for probably nothing) should net a playoff team a very likely starter (or 25+ minutes of the bench), which Josh Hart is just not."
"Josh ""PJ ""Center"" Tucker"" Hart"
Josh Hart with 13 rebounds 👀👀
Josh Hart hustles harder than everyone so he can make an impression at least
Josh Hart was the first name that came to mind for me but only because I watched the comeback they had against the Celtics.
"I think if your ""solution"" is to play Josh Hart 36 minutes per game, then that says a lot"
So would you give Stan a pass on this?   How about him not changing line up and utilize more of Josh Hart? Actually it would make more sense to bring Bledsoe off the bench and have Hart with the starters this entire time to begin
"Yeah it would be a cool idea. Some candidates would be Marcus Smart, Josh Hart, Chris Paul, and Dejounte Murray. Those guys are some leaders on their respective teams"
Josh hart has such a nice game
Josh Hart 🖐🏽✋
Can't wait for a veteran Josh Hart to play 2-3 great years for the Spurs
"Millsap, Hayward, Kanter, Burks, Hood, Exum, Lyles, Prince, Josh Hart, Allen, Dok....yea, we're fighting for the worse team in the league there."
"One thing I absolutely loved about Josh Hart during his stint as a Laker was the effort he gave every minute on the court. His rebounding numbers are just a way to measure how hard he plays, often being undersized but always doing whatever it takes."
Also I’d say Brunson is more of a pure scorer than Josh Hart
At first I thought you said Josh Hart was averaging 2 more rebounds. lmao
Josh (Pj Tucker) Hart
"Yeah, why would any team try to pluck a young, marginalized player away from the Lakers? You'd probably just end up with a fuckin bum like Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, D'Angelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Thomas Bryant, Mo Wagner, Svi Mykhailiuk  or Isaac Bonga.  By the way, how's Semi Ojeleye's development coming along?"
"I have dudes I'd root for whether they leave/get traded or not. Jrue Holiday is definitely one of those guys.  Josh Hart/J.J. Redick -- more involved/vocal with the city/Pels fans than any player has been since CP left in 2011. Like Jrue, I'll be rooting for J.J. to get a ring when he heads out later this year. Lifelong fan of Josh now too.  BI -- as soon as he signed his max, he started coming out of his shell a little and showing his personality. I don't think he's ""quiet"" like people love to say. He has a *big* personality. lmao. Absolute *dawg* and I love it.  Zion -- always came off as super nice. There's not 'a single moment' that sold me on him, I've been sold on him from the jump--but when we were getting blown out in games early this year, I just noticed he doesn't 'give up.' Like Zion doesn't treat garbage time like it's garbage time. He plays very, very hard at all times and tries to will the game to a win if we're losing. I was really impressed seeing that from a guy that young.  It's been nice seeing him come out of his shell too because he and BI are both very smart and very interesting people to learn about. It's been fun getting to see them grow while they're here."
"The youngsters showed flashes but were too inconsistent to win. Lonzo was playing well in the second half of his season with LeBron but he got hurt. BI was growing on schedule. Randle got hurt in his first game his rookie season and missed the rest of the year (that really sucked). D. Russell was let go in favor of Lonzo but there was no denying his talent. Larry Nance was an impact player, as was Thomas Bryant. Zubac, Jordan Clarkson, Josh Hart were all promising. I think the Lakers development team did its job, just that these guys were young."
"Well, why do you think it happened? Maybe because they created a Superteam that didn't pan out correctly.      Now, if you say they collected good assets that led them to AD, you haven't been paying attention, boy. AD said something along the thought of not wanting to re-sign to anywhere else. That makes anyone conscious of trading any assets and making LA the only team with the incentive to do so.      Don't get me wrong BI is good. Lonzo can be good and is already trending to that. Josh Hart is also nice. But almost all the talking heads know that this is an offer that can easily be beaten by other teams that want to. But because it is LA and AD wanted to be there, NO had no other choice than to trade for the only serious suitor for AD.     Now, if it were to be an even playing field, and we had the chance to re-sign AD, then I would not bat an eye trading JB (even if he is my favorite player) to NO.      But again, Geography played a part. LA is Showtime and players, whether you like it or not, loves to play in LA.     So think again, and now use your brain."
"Monte Morris, Sabonis, PJ Dozier, Keldon Johnson, Larry Nance, Garry Tent, Josh Hart.   Role players are not sexy"
"size matters some for sure, but maybe not as much as we would think. players like myles turner and brook lopez def don't get even close to as many rebounds as they should with their size. and then some players like josh hart and westbrook outrebound players their size by an outrageous margin. obviously westbrook may be an outlier with how hard he goes for rebounds, but my point stands. you can be a great or terrible rebounder regardless of your size"
"Rebounding is always an important skill, especially if you can do it well at smaller sizes. Look at Josh Hart, he’s probably the 4th best player on the Pelicans and a lot of it is due to his rebounding"
"He wouldn’t cost Ingram. Josh Hart, Lonzo, Hayes and Bledsoe to match salary, and probably some picks may just do it."
I see a rich man’s Josh hart
"We had Josh Hart fouling every shooter once every three plays or so, Bazemore can't be that much worse, right?"
Damn Josh Hart hasnt been signed. Feels bad man.
"Roster is basically set. Ball/LaVine/DeRozan/Williams/Vuc, Caruso/White/Brown/""Lauri""/Bradley, last 3 spots to Ayo, Simonovic, and Green.   ""Lauri"" is either Lauri, or the guy we S&amp;T him for, or if we're very confident in Simonovic we can send Lauri for picks and sign a guy like Millsap or Josh Hart with the BAE."
"Josh Hart, JJ Redick, Wes Matthews, Paul Milsap, Rondae Hollis Jefferson, Avery Bradley, Etuan moore, Langston Galloway, Frank Nitilinka, Stanley Johnson, etc.   There’s plenty of bodies still out there and they just need to eat up minutes in the regular season."
In what world do you think Josh Hart is better than buddy hield lmfao
Josh Hart is better than Buddy Hield lol
"It's because he's on the Lakers, it's literally that simple. When Lonzo was on the Lakers, twitter would blow up after a bad game. There'd be 30k trending tweets an hour after a game. Same thing with Brandon Ingram, same thing with Danny Green, Julius Randle, same shit with Quinn Cook, Josh Hart too. literally any time a Laker did something bad they would get blown up on social media. Guys on other teams don't have 30k tweets about them every night if they put up a stinker unless they're a superstar. If you're an average roleplayer on the lakers you get as much attention as a star on a small market team."
Another RFA I'm waiting on is Josh Hart
seriously though what's going on with josh hart? haven't seen any articles with teams interested so i'm guessing he's resigning
Kuz and Josh Hart as well
"Ceiling: 44-48 wins, 6th seed and avoiding the play in.   -Zion picks up where he left off last year and gets even more dominant and averages shy of 30 a game with 6 assists and 7-8 boards. Assists go up with sharpshooting from Graham, Hield (hehe), and Nickeil. Jax, Nickeil and Kira take the expected steps forward in development making us one of the most lethal young cores in the league. JV thrives in the dunkers spot. Ingram and Zion both improve on defense and put in the effort and make it personal; team defense is average league wide. Zion lands an All-NBA team spot and signs whatever the big contract extension is next offseason.   Floor: 32-37 wins, 11th seed or get thrashed in the play in. Zion and Ingram don’t improve much on defense; team takes a step back after strong defensive finish last year. JV and Graham don’t mesh well with the rest of the core. Lack of depth behind Zion gets exposed. Injuries pile up.     Where I think we land: I don’t think Griff, Trajan and the FO is done making moves so I believe we add Hield, or maybe one of Ingles or Bogdonavic from Utah and expand on the Memphis trade. There’s also Josh Hart still roaming. Whoever we add + current roster and I think we hit .500 or just a bit over that and at the very least, make the play in. Playoffs are the goal, but I’m hesitant to call us a playoff team; we’ll see."
"He was quite literally the centerpiece of the AD package. Zo and Josh hart were throw ins. The picks were a big part. But BI was viewed as a very valuable piece at the time.  He had just averaged 18ppg as a 21 year old and he was someone everyone expected to make a jump because he averaged like 23 a game over the last 3 months of the season  I think you’re misremembering, or you misunderstood at the time what was happening"
"Letting Lonzo go was probably a mistake. It's gonna be difficult to find replacement level talent on Zion's timeline that wants to come to NOLA. But honestly I'm excited for this season, the roster looks less clumsy and I won't have to watch eric bledsoe dribble the air out of the basketball for 30 mins a night. I think NAW and Hayes should both get big minutes. Also we DESPERATELY need to give Josh Hart his bag. That dude's huge for us"
I think Josh Hart is super underrated too. I'd take Josh hart on the hornets over Kelly Oubre
There is no way I would want Josh Hart over Dennis.  I think this whole Laker contract thing has seriously underrated his value.  Hart is not the same level.
"I mean if it came down to rostering Josh Hart vs Dennis, then you should absolutely pick Josh Hart. I just dont see where you are getting more benefit from rostering a different alternative. Just my 2c"
"Kira Lewis Jr., Josh Hart if he re-signs."
"I wonder if anyone will give Frankie Nicotine a flyer. I think Boogie, JJ and Millsap all have something left in the tank. Biyombo is a solid rim protector as a backup still. Who wins the Lauri Markkanen sweepstakes? Does Josh Hart end up taking the qualifying? These questions and more on next week's episode of NBA off-season"
granpa josh hart
Josh hart for lauri sign and trade?
I'd say Josh Hart is definitely a good spark plug off the bench. Most teams have need for such a guy.
If I'm Riley I'm taking a shot at Josh Hart and Diallo.
The pick trade-down was David Griffin undoing his own mistakes (which is kind of a crazy waste of assets) but I do think Jonas is going to be a *big* upgrade over Steven Adams. Mans averaged 17ppg and sometimes got doubled.  With Devonte' it sounds like we had other plans that fell through to be the trade piece to grab him (Josh Hart for Graham) and then we traded the pick for some cap-related reasons when we couldn't do that.  Neither a great look or inspires a lot of confidence though lol.
"what about the ""josh hart ninetendo switch"" deal. classic"
"IMO Colangelo did a worse job than Billy King during his mutilation of the Nets.  At least King's moves had a somewhat sound logical basis. Colangelo was a total moron selling 2nd round draft picks (he sold the rights to Sterling Brown in 2017), and using 2 first rounders to draft Fultz, one of the biggest busts of the decade. There are reports that Colangelo overrode his staff's concerns when Fultz had terrible workouts.   Also, here are a few players drafted after Pasečņiks (25):  * Kuzma (27) * Derrick White (29) * Josh Hart (30) * Wes Iwundu (33) * Dillon Brooks (45)  In summary, fuck the Colangelos."
"Kinda interesting to think how those young Lakers teams would have developed together. 5 of those guys have all gotten large contracts.   D'Lo, Ball, BI, Randle, Kuzma, Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, Josh Hart is not the worst team build around and they could have landed PG or Kawhi in FA?   They probably pick somewhere around the late teens in the 2018, 2019, and 2020 drafts if they stick together? Could have added someone like Kevin Huerter, Thybulle, or Saddiq Bey. If they pick in that 12-14 range they could have gotten Michael Porter Jr, Tyler Herro, or Tyrese Hailburton in one of those drafts.   Surely not the championship contender they are with LeBron and you can't pay everyone but they could have fun to watch and root for I think."
Everyone except Josh hart lol
Everyone except Josh Hart lol
Everyone except Josh Hart lol
"If you ever wore purple and gold, I gotta root for you no matter what. I want all of those guys to succeed, whether you're Josh Hart, or Thomas Bryant, or Lonzo Ball. I want all those guys to have amazing careers. 💜💛"
"Josh Hart, Wes Iwundu and a pick"
"In short, the reality of the offseason is much better than the perception, but the perception is also pretty bad and it will take the Pelicans being able to take advantage of the considerable flexibility they've afforded themselves to change the minds of many.  After making good moves by recognizing the mistakes of last offseason, overhauling the coaching staff, and clearing the decks with the Memphis trade, they took a shot at the top veteran point guards on the market, made big offers to Lowry and then Paul, and they were turned down. Then they went after guys like THJ and Powell to add more shooting and a solid veteran starter to the lineup and they both chose to stay with their current teams. After doing so, they seem to be set on operating as an above the cap team, which is why they’ve been bringing in guys by sign and trade. Thus it is highly unlikely the book has been written on the Pelicans offseason, but if you stopped the story right now the first few chapters might give you cause for concern.  But, I'm fairly confident they will add several more players with the flexibility that their moves has afforded them, and when the totality of moves are made, things will look far better even if the general consensus of fans has been crystallized by  what has happened solely in the past few days.   That is the gist, but if curious, what follows if much more detailed:  I can understand the disappointment and frustration of many Pelicans fans, and skepticism of fans around the league. I also get the criticism in the media, both the valid and hyperbolic, especially when the media (particularly the hot take variety) has a bias towards larger markets, a desire to see young superstars on “name” teams, as well as the with Pelicans/Hornets past failures to build winners around CP3/AD, and given the mistakes of last offseason and what it cost to undo them this year. It also does not help that their primary target was also the top (reasonably gettable) guy on the market this year, fans got their hopes up, and when they took a big swing for the home run and missed, then followed that up with not matching Lonzo, and then Pels fans only see backups from Chicago and Charlotte coming in and are critical or worried. And If this were the sum total of the Pelicans offseason, I would probably agree with them, especially if there were no more moves made (there will be several). But as it stands now they are in position to be a better performing team this year than last, and have much improved finances/books, hold no bad contracts, and have a ton of flexibility to fill several more spots for this years team.   On Lonzo, they seem to have decided (correctly imo) that he was not worth the price Chicago paid, though even if it were marginally lower they probably don’t match and force Ball to stay. I completely understand the reasoning of why many would disagree and say just match, and I think it was a closer call than the front office did, but ultimately at that number and given Lonzo’s preference to leave (along with the terrible experience of forcing Eric Gordon to stay and underperform years ago) I agree with letting him go. They felt that Lonzo was not the answer at point, and that he’s really more of a 3/D guard and that they could find either a star level veteran floor leader, or a cheaper option that could actually run the half court, drive the ball, and wasn’t afraid to draw fouls. They struck out on the veteran, but were able to acquire Graham on a good deal. There was not a big return on the Lonzo trade because the pelicans were not going to match, Lonzo wanted out, and Chicago had other things cooking with the other players who may have been potentially included, and they were not going give up a first for the right to sign and trade for Ball like they did DeRozan (they also included that FRP to dump Aminu’s contract). Would I have preferred a better return for Lonzo, yes, but I don’t think we were getting a 1st or White, and would have liked Young over Sato, but that’s only marginally better.  Ultimately the value of return in a sign and trade is not equal to the player, but to the relative willingness for the team with RFA rights to match the number. The Pelicans had less desire to match, thus the lower return. This same logic is also why I think giving up the 1st to Charlotte was a slight overpay for Graham, as they have Ball and Rozier, just drafted Bouknight, so were probably less intent to match to prevent the logjam, but given the low number on Graham they may have matched without the 1st, and of course there is also the added value for the Pels of staying in position to operate over the cap.   We also need to keep in mind that with all the space the Pelicans created, including trade exceptions from disparity of incoming/outgoing contracts, and how they have chosen to operate in the transactions they have made, it is clear that there are several more moves coming, likely also by trade, via MLE/BAE, et al. So any grade on this offseason far is very much incomplete. There are probably at least 2, possibly 3 players who will be in the Pels' rotation this fall that are not currently on the roster.   At this point we should take a look at that new roster, because most of the Pelicans' moves have been made via trade, and involve many players, picks, and coaches I think it is important to consider all of what is coming in, going out, and where they currently are situated.   Outgoing: Coach SVG, Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams and their bad contracts, Lonzo Ball, Pelicans’ Lottery protected 2022 1st, Top 10 protected Lakers 22’ 1st, Ziare Williams  Incoming: Willie Green, Mike D’Antoni, Jonas Valanciunas, Devonte Graham, Trey Murphy, Tomas Satoransky, Garrett Temple, 2 second round picks, (Re-signed Didi Louzada)  Unused/TBD: Open cap space, Trade exception, Josh Hart Bird Rights, non-tax MLE, BAE  &amp;#x200B;  Even if there were no further moves (there will be) and they just kept/matched Josh Hart, you can argue that they will be a better team with this roster and coaching staff. I would say the roster is slightly less talented as of now with Lonzo out, but it’s not just Graham replacing Lonzo, it will be what the sign and trade for Graham and not overpaying Lonzo gives you, which is the ability to operate as an over the cap team, preserve and utilize exceptions, and extra space with which to operate, along with Hart’s rights and possibly Sato as a small piece/contract to deal. If they are unable to take advantage of this flexibility, or the open space they have, I would fully agree that this offseason has been if not a failure, but a disappointment and a big missed opportunity. But I fully expect them to take advantage of said flexibility.   By operating as an over the cap team, they can bring in a decent sized salary (20-25M) in a trade from a team looking to avoid the tax, save money, or retool their roster. Obvious examples, but of course not limited these guys are Ingles or Bojan from the Jazz, Barnes or Buddy from the Kings. Then of course you can take on salary in conjunction with assets to recoup some of what you sent out, like maybe Washington pays to dump Bertans and you add more shooting to the rotation as well. These are just a few examples that have been thrown out by those that follow the Pelicans closely, but this type player is what I would expect to add.   You also still have space, as well as the MLE and BAE to add guys still on the market that could either start or provide decent depth along the lines of Reggie Jackson, Paul Millsap, Lauri Markkanen, Kelly Oubre, Schroder, Avery Bradley, etc.  They may also choose to keep Josh Hart, or do a sign and trade with him somewhere for another rotation guy or asset.   Then of all the players they acquired, Satoransky could be on the move, as he’s expendable, has some value, is a nice sized number to work into a trade, and keeping him might block the minutes/development of the young guards they like on the roster (who SVG puzzlingly backburnered in favor of an uninterested and underperforming Bledsoe last year). I like Satoransky as depth, but I can see him being moved for something as well.  So, as we can see, there is likely a good bit more to come, so the grade is incomplete. But if they don’t do anything else, or they don’t have a plan of how to utilize their flexibility I would say that they deserve much of the criticism they’ve received, even if this year’s team outperforms last year’s. "

Naji Marshall and Josh Hart have proven to be better defenders IMO
"It’s only been three days of free agency  That being said- losing lonzo was not ideal, but at the end of the day, he wanted to walk and we weren’t going to pay him that much. We got someone who is statically similar to lonzo for very very cheap. This leaves a lot of cap open to sign some good role players (josh hart, hernangomez, some other veteran forward). It also leaves a possibility to build from a trade.   The front office believes they already have their core. Zion, BI, NAW, Hayes is their young superstar core. By siginging more and more vets to “win now”, you’re forcing out and taking minutes away from the players who are going to help us continue to win.   They offloaded bled and adams and got a great Center, they signed a guy they think can really contribute in graham. They got a respectable vet and a scrappy 3 in the s/t with ball. They had a great draft and got two guys they think can contribute. They signed 3 really great coaches to the staff- so to say they’re doing nothing isn’t true.   They also did offer Lowry, CP3 and Hardaway, but they went elsewhere.   The off-season isn’t over, nor is the Pelicans 21-22 team building phase."
"Rather try to get Josh Hart. If the Pels match, it's not like we wasted time because Oubre will probably still be a FA lmao."
I thought Josh Hart declined Pels offer to become a UFA?
"I wonder what happens with Josh Hart.  Too young to ring chase on a minimum, but his skillset seems to fit best as a 15-20 mpg guy on a playoff team."
"After him, I think Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Josh Hart, and Wes Matthews. Probably holding off for better offers before having to settle."
That'd be great love Josh Hart he really popped when I saw the Pels live.
"I'd love Josh Hart, actually"
Josh Hart would be a good addition
Josh Hart said he wanted out lol.
"Are we sure multiple teams wanted Ball, though? The Ball buzz at the trade deadline was only about the Bulls, and clearly the Bulls were the only ones making a big offer now in free agency. (Pretty clear inference from the deal being done in the first minute of free agency; and probably also why the Pels got so little in the S&amp;T. If other teams were competing for Ball, the Bulls probably have to give up more for him.)  And can I point out that every other move by the Bulls was a grotesque overpay for a mediocre one-dimensional player? They're building around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan as well as Ball - and gave up the farm to do so. There is very little evidence the current Bulls front office knows what they're doing.  Re: the Anthony Davis heist, the Pels still have an age-22 All-Star in Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, Jaxson Hayes, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Didi Louzada, two R1 picks, and two R1 pick swaps from that. They're doing OK there."
"The first is too much, but framing this like we gave up Lonzo and  1st for Graham is wrong. Lonzo was leaving no matter what, we ended uo getting a 2nd and two good bench players for him, which is normally what teams get for an RFA who is leaving regardless.   We also got Graham and unfortunately overpaid for him slightly with the protected pick. Graham will provide most of what Lonzo did for $10 million less and that's great for us.   Same with the draft trade, we moved down 7 slots and gave up a protected '22 pick for Valanciunas and cap space. We also may have gotten a better player at 17 than Memphis did at 10. This draft was wierd and everything from 8 to 18 was seemingly random.   Again the only issue with the offseason so far is giving up the protected 1st for Graham, but maybe that's worth it by the end of the year. There were other moves I wish we'd made, but we haven't made any real mistakes yet.  From here I can see us getting one of Ingles or Hield or Ourbe and have a pretty decent offseason. The whole Josh Hart thing is still an unknown."
And the guy even threw in a free wedding invitation!! Josh Hart could’ve had it all.
I don’t love this list. I’d prob toss Dwight Powell in as a C. Maybe Josh Hart or Mills as guards.
Josh Hart is a fool for not paying that one user from here (r/nba) upfront for his Nintendo Switch  Made him wait like an year  Smh
Josh Hart and Larry Nance bromance continues
I think josh hart to us on a one or two year deal would be pretty cool  I dont want to watch Martwin minutes again next year please.
Are they expected to keep Josh Hart at least?
"You’re entire argument is predicated on other teams doing what your team was supposed to. The only player you paid from that group was Kuzma. Lonzo? Traded him to get a star. BI? Traded to get a star? Kuzma? Paid him then dumped him for a star. Josh Hart? Traded him for a star!  You definitely did dump Kuzma to get a star, you traded him for Westbrook, like what? You fucked over Caruso because you had his bird rights and didn’t even counter the Bulls offer of 4/36 lol.   Yeah all of those other teams paying the players you dumped for nothing is a great look for the Lakers. “We’re so good to our players we won’t pay you, we’ll trade you instead”   The Celtics weren’t paying IT before or after the injury, the Lakers have the least amount of loyalty in the league and will trade any player off for any reason."
"Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, Kyle Kuzma, and now Alex Caruso all we’re done terribly by the Lakers who dumped them the first chance they got to get a star. They probably did Caruso the worst.   Good job ignoring 5 of the 6 players you fucked over though."
We’d probs s&amp;t Josh hart if he’s willing to join you
"We love our players dude, especially the ones that grow with us. AC was A G League to Summer league to NBA Champ for us and did all the right things for us on the floor. Def makes sense for it to hurt.   I still have a soft spot for Josh Hart lol"
Josh Hart?
My projections  *  Kawhi Leonard (LAC) * Demar Derozan (DAL) * Dennis Scrotum (OKC) * Spencer Dinwiddie (WAS) * John Collins (ATL) * Josh Hart (NOP) * Victor Oladipo (BOS) * Danny Green (LAL) * Andre Iguodala (GSW) * Patty Mills (SAS) * Reggie Jackson (LAC)

"&gt; They spent Adams, Bledsoe, Ziare Williams, Jared Butler, Lonzo, the Lakers 2022 FRP, and their 2022 FRP (lottery protected), for Graham, Valunciunas, Trey Murphy III, Brandon Boston Jr, Temple, Satoransky, and a second round pick  I'm going to try to recontextualize because I really think you're overstating ""3 first round picks"" here  That also means they sent ~$60.5 million on the books next year for  Lonzo for ~$41.25 million incoming, which leaves them about $97.22 million on roster currently. They've got a qualifying offer in to Josh Hart, and it'll be interesting to see what happens there, but they can spend almost $40 million extra next year before hitting the luxury tax. They don't have the big moves they need this year, but they could fill that space with some young, high upside guys for now like THT, Bruce Brown, maybe even Ntilikina if they want to gamble, or if they wanna pull the trigger on a larger contract and miss Hart they could go after Kendrick Nunn, Dennis Shroeder, Malik Monk, or potentially even Lauri Markkanen.  **TL;DR they pick swapped two picks, gave a Lakers pick, gave a lotto protected first, and lost Lonzo to make $20,000,000 of cap space, ditch 2 of their worst fits, add Graham and Valunciunas, and flesh out the bench a tiny bit. I don't think that's an awful situation, especially given that Lonzo could have just walked sans sign-and-trade**"
Best remaining players  * Kawhi Leonard * Demar Derozan * Dennis Shroeder * Spencer Dinwiddie * John Collins * Kelly Oubre Jr * Josh Hart * Paul millsap * Victor Oladipo * Danny Green * Justice Winslow * Lou Williams * Andre Iguodala * JJ redick * Patty Mills * Rudy Gay * Lauri Markennan * Malik Monk * Reggie Jackson * Kendrick Nunn * Talen Horton Tucker * Terence Davis  Obviously Kawhi is the big fish but there is still a lot of talent left
"Why is Arcidiacono not on the list? Josh Hart is an intriguing option, and so is Franky Smokes."
"literally undoing the lonzo trade and keeping him. also re-signing josh hart.   Graham-Lonzo-BI-Zion-JV  Kira-NAW-Murphy-Hart-Hayes  Maybe keep james johnson if possible. That's a playoff squad if healthy. And point zion feasts in that. Now we have to find a 3&amp;D that fits lonzo's role. Frustrating because that feels like the missing piece to what would be a solid 7/8 seed with potential for 4/5/6. Then after another year together could return everyone but JV next offseason. Hopefully you bring him back and that chemistry / continuity pays dividends in the form of 5/6 seed basement, 2/3 seed challenger. Maybe you bring in a stud piece.   Instead we've got a gaping hole and a shirt on of bs to figure out."
It's weird that they still haven't upped Josh Hart yet. Considering he's like the only good wing player they have outside of Ingram.

Laker fans will hate this but Caruso was replaceable. He’s the sort of guy that you love having on the cheap but don’t want to be the one paying his salary.   All these /r/NBA have been concern trolling the Lakers all weekend over a lack of spacing. The Lakers swap out Kent Bazemore on a league min deal for Caruso on a $37M deal and they call it a bad move.  Caruso can’t shoot. Bazemore can. The both play solid defense.   The real takeaway is that Caruso is part of a pipeline. He was preceded by Josh Hart and he’ll be followed by another no name we’ve developed into a contributor.

Josh Hart is out there
"For an encyclopedic knowledge, he sure does get basic details wrong. Didn't even mention Josh Hart as part of the AD deal and said the Pelicans gave up two firsts for Cousins instead of one."
Bruh. He couldn't even remember that Josh Hart was part of the return. Completed didn't even mention him.
"Book, McGee and Josh Hart have run trios in Warzone a few times before"
 as in Josh hart?
josh hart/nick young? lmaoo
"&gt; Is that biting you in the ass because it was a bad decision or just unlucky?   Both.  Collins being injured all the time isn't Olshey's fault.  We'd absolutely be a better team if Collins could actually play.    However, going 2-for-1 in a deep draft on a fairly risky pick (Collins wasn't considered an NBA prospect out of HS, didn't start at Gonzaga, and half of his games were against crappy WCC teams).  Its not even clear that we couldn't have snagged Collins at 15, and if not our consolation prizes looked pretty good.    I agree with you that Portland might be 1 move away from being a genuine contender, but that 2017 draft was a massive missed opportunity where Portland could have had Bam, Mitchell, John Collins, Jarrett Allen, and OG.  Any one of those guys would have been a really big deal for us and it didn't happen.    Also there is the 25 pick where we grabbed Swanigan, who is out of the league, who got followed up with Kuzma, Bradley, White, and Josh Hart.    That draft was a complete mess for Portland, and Collins' being constantly turned it into a disaster.  I also think Olshey deserves a ton of criticism for the 2016 offseason where we threw giant contracts at Evan Turner, Meyers Leonard, and Harkless, tying up our money for years.    All said and done, I don't think Olshey is a complete idiot, and there are certainly worse GMs in the league.  I just don't think he's capable of putting together a championship team and there is plenty of criticism that can be launched at him."
"Oh that other trade makes way more sense, I just saw it too. Down as fuck with sato and Josh hart plus draft capital."
I hope Josh Hart doesn't forget his Switch
Our options kind of in order of what I selfishly prefer   Lowry  Powell  Match offer on Lonzo:  -Keep Zo  -S&amp;T to Boston for Smart  -Chicago has nothing other than Thad Young that I’d want back so   Duncan Robinson   Reggie Jackson or Kelly Olynyck or Furkan Korkmaz or JaMychal Green  Dragic  Dinwiddie (meh)  Kemba (kill me)    Most of (except Lowry in the universe where the tempering police veto Lowry to Miami) — if not all — of these can be done while also re-signing Josh Hart and using the MLE.
You take that Josh Hart slander back!
"Kira don't look ready to be the lead guard of an NBA team tbh, especially one trying to make a playoff push in the West  NAW ain't a point guard, he can playmake a little but asking him to run the offense is a bit of a stretch  Josh Hart is a free agent, good luck re-signing him if reports are true that he isn't happy at the front office"
"Their young core turned out to be pretty good, just not on their team. DLo, Randle, and BI were all stars, Lonzo could potentially be an all star and josh hart is a serviceable starter."
"That 2017 draft doesn't just count as one mistake, it was a tremendous failure on multiple fronts. We had 3 first round picks and could've walked away with: John Collins (@ #15), Jarrett Allen/OG Anunoby (@ #20), and Kyle Kuzma/Derrick White/Josh Hart/Dillon Brooks (@ #26).  Or if we still made our trade of #15 + #20 for #10, we could have taken Bam Adebayo or Donovan Mitchell there.  Instead of getting any ONE of those players above, we walked away with Zach Collins and Caleb Swanigan. And even if Zach Collins were healthy, he looks like a serviceable rotation player, not a star, and certainly not someone who would've pushed us to the next level. That draft was nothing short of an unmitigated disaster."
"Phoenix traded for CP3, a better player than Lowry and with only 1 year left on his deal, without having to give up a significant rotation piece.  The Pelicans are about to commit max money to Lowry for multiple seasons and in the process of doing so it is going to cost them Lonzo Ball &amp; Josh Hart, both of whom were key pieces for them last year."
"If Lowry goes to Miami, and CP3 and Conley stay in Phoenix and Utah respectively, then yeah, it'd be surprising if they just let Lonzo walk.  But I suspect that Griffin is starting to feel the desperation creep in, and I don't think there's any reasonable path for the Heat to clear as much cap space as the Pelicans can if they renounce everybody. If the Pels hang on to Josh Hart they'll be roughly even with Miami, but they could still offer more years.  Lowry would have to really believe in the vision Pat Riley is selling because he might be forced to turn down tens of millions of dollars to be a part of it."
"Lakers. Ball, Ingram, Josh Hart, Clarkson, Randle, Thomas Bryant, Kobe Bryant."
"Look at the Lakers non-lottery picks here. THT, Kuz, Hart, Nance, etc. Only 2 out and out bad picks.  46	LAL	Talen Horton-Tucker 25	LAL	Moritz Wagner 39	LAL	Isaac Bonga 47	LAL	Svi Mykhailiuk 27	LAL	Kyle Kuzma 30	LAL	Josh Hart 42	LAL	Thomas Bryant 32	LAL	Ivica Zubac 27	LAL	Larry Nance Jr. 34	LAL	Anthony Brown 46	LAL	Jordan Clarkson"
Josh hart is not better than Lauri lol
"Re-signing josh hart, not signing anyone at all, would be better"
"this is painful for me to write b/c i really think BC squandered a golden opportunity arrogantly waiting for that big free agent to sign.     then he got caught with the burners right before that chance was going to happen with a playoff team so he didn't get to see it through.    But he didn't do anything that was going to kill the team long term.   Nothing to help, but treaded water.    He missed some easy layups like Josh Hart from Nova just sitting there and taking crack version KP instead to stash b/c we had no roster room.   Fultz wasn't really his fault either...but it was fine.   Its the Colangelo leftovers + Brand in 2 years pissed it all away.  Bridges, Butler(good), Tobi(awful), Al, JRich, letting JJ walk, pissing off your franchise player.....  so bad.  so fucking bad.   Daryl hopefully can fix it.   But to your point if Daryl had started where BC did it would have been glorious"
"Josh Hart, he wants to be here"
"Add in Thomas Bryant, Josh Hart and Zubac"
Lol or Josh Hart who's essentially the same player. A lot of flourishing going on there.
what about the dude who sold Josh Hart a switch lol
"We know how this goes. Same people tried to tell us Josh Hart, Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram were garbage and the moment they left it was a mistake. Only Ingram really makes me sad about being gone"
They also got Josh Hart and Thomas Bryant in that draft. Both AFTER Kuz. That's pretty wild.
Lmao Josh Hart left out in the cold again
Josh Hart Nintendo switch type beat
"Thomas Bryant, Moritz Wagner, Josh Hart, I can go on and on and on"
"I get you yeah, I’m imagining staggered minutes but there will probably be times where Davion/Tyrese are gonna be guarding the 3.. not so bad when it’s like Josh Hart or a Norm Powell, but I don’t see how they’re gonna guard Kawhi or DeRozan"
Dammit that’s good for them. Reminds me of Josh Hart kinda
Get away from me Josh Hart
Josh Hart gone
"What are the Lakers giving up? I mean, if I'm the Wizards, the Lakers package won't look appealing almost no matter what it is.  What... Kuzma + THT, maybe picks and/or KCP? Wizards aren't getting a lot of value in return, unless Kuzma develops much better over there, unlike he had been with the Lakers so far. Also, how do Russ and LeBron work together? Are they splitting posessions? Neither of them is great off the ball, so what's the idea there?  Also, trading Westbrook definitely means Beal is out as well. It'll be interesting to see where he goes. He can legitimately get back some picks plus a player that are actually impactful. Maybe NOLA for Lonzo, Josh Hart and some picks? I don't know if it works out tbh, but he gets you a lot more value than Russ. Zion and Beal would definitely make some noise, if NOLA can get a decent PG at some point."
"Lonzo Ball, D'Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, Ivica Zubac.   Jordan Clarkson, Svi Mykhailiuk Josh Hart, Larry Nance Jr, Thomas Bryant."
"From one bias fan to another. These medicore laker players we laker fans  just love to hype up such as jordan clarkson, larry nance, bradon ingram, josh hart, lonzo ball, julius randle and dlo actually do shockingly well on other teams."
"The Great:   -The Davis trade after a really ugly second half to the 18-19 season and basically dealing with NOLA vs the world   -Helping shape a development staff with Gentry to help BI and Zo blossom.   -Naji Marshall UDFA —&gt; contract extension  -The Jrue trade; did right by Jrue and secured a bag of future picks and swaps. To all those people saying they won’t mean shit in five years: LMA and Bosh were all stars five years ago.   -Maxing BI    The good:   -Offloading Solomon Hill’s contract and signing JJ Redick   -Trading second round picks for Derrick Favors at the time   -With Trajan and Swin as well, seems to hit the draft pretty well. Jax, despite recent news (let’s also not mail in the rest of his life for this shit either), Nickeil, Kira, and Naji have all shown signs of a whole bunch of promise and legit talent. Jax was fantastic the second half of last season. Pels probably make the play in if Nickeil starts over Bledsoe. Naji was a fuckin Diamond in the rough.   -Willing to not let open wounds fester and immediately identifies and fixes own mistakes; something a deadbeat VP would not do.   -trading Redick and Melli for James Johnson, Wes Iwundu and a second rounder. Redick and Melli became unplayable and we saved some money for this offseason by offing Melli.       The bad:  -Choosing Melli and Jah over C Wood. Granted there was definitely some behind the scenes stuff with Wood’s attitude, but man Wood would have killed it with Zion.   -SVG  -Way too many guards on the 2019-2020 roster.   -Not enough shooters and defense on this last seasons team.  -Not extending Josh Hart BEFORE last year (this is more TBD/me nitpicking)    The Ugly:   Being the VP of a team who’s best player’s step father is already wanting his son off the team."
2018 Lonzo Ball  2018 Brandon Ingram  2018 Kyle Kuzma  2018 Josh Hart  Whatever year Ryan Hollins
"Yeah, I remember that's what happened when the Lakers traded for AD. IIRC, they only gave up Josh Hart and some 2nd round picks"
Damn Josh Hart to G League ignite?
I really like Josh Hart but I was thinking he’d clear $10M maybe.
Give me Nwaba and Josh Hart!
"Browsing a few old Ringer draft guides...  Tatum was compared to Pierce, Granger, and Rudy Gay. That holds up ok.  Doncic got a lot of Harden comps... I can't think of anyone better to compare him to now so I think that holds up.  Josh Hart got compared to Wesley Matthews and that turned out ok, I think.  Robert Williams was compared to Clint Capela."

"So apparently Hart, AD and Jrue wanted out. That's more than ""only Josh Hart""."
Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com has sources on Josh Hart according to BleacherReport aggregator .com
Josh hart would be a good pick up for gsw  Edit : my bad. Thought we were talking bout pels.
"Only Josh Hart wants out. Lonzo just wants to go wherever he gets paid, but then again he naught be not liked his role as a 3&amp;D player. The Ingram and Zion wanting out rumors were false. If we somehow mess everything up and have a horrible team with a bad future, Ingram and Zion probably would want out in the future though."

"He's done well for a 27th pick. They also picked Nance 27th, Josh Hart 30th, Zubac 32nd, Clarkson 42nd, and Thomas Bryant 46th."
"He doesnt have a 60 win contender around himself anymore because he is a petty asshole.  He could have traded Kawhi to the Lakers - most likely they wouldnt have won a chip with Paul George anyways.  If anything it makes Pop and the Spurs look like the bigger men by shipping Kawhi out (bc even if he was a piece of shit he did win Finals MVP and helped the Spurs bring home a chip) to his destination of choice.  Just like in the Harden deal (where they could have had Ben Simmons), Pop's pettiness cost the Spurs organization wins and most importantly money.  Lonzo is playing great ball to the point where the Lakers are considering bringing him back to play point in LeBron's final push for one last chip.  Josh Hart is a decent bench player, as is Kuzma.  The grandfather deal was Lonzo/Ingram/Kuzma/Hart, probably a pick or two involved as well - and POP TURNED IT DOWN.  He didnt turn it down for a better haul or a player he wanted - nope he turned it down for DeMar DeFrozen when even a new poster to r/NBA would laugh at the idea of Kawhi for DeRozan.  Lonzo/Ingram/Kuzma/Hart is wayyyyyy better than DeFrozen/Poetl and you can thank Pop for that."
"(Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart)"
Pargo was the Josh Hart of the 2000s
"&gt;and if he says he will only resign in Boston  Keep dreaming lol. The BR article about him possibly requesting a trade already said that if he does request a trade he would ""welcome joining teams such as Boston, Golden State, Miami or Philadelphia.""   Even when AD (also on an expiring contract) was sitting out of games and openly trying to get to LA, he got traded for Brandon Ingram (#2 pick a few years earlier), Lonzo (2 years removed from being the #2 pick), Josh Hart, the #4 overall pick, and 2 more future first round picks."
"full text:  #29 NBA teams are poverty franchises right now  As I sit back and watch the aftermath of the 2021 NBA Finals, I can't help but feel pity for the city of Milwaukee and Bucks fans all across the Earth.  The Milwaukee Bucks are a poverty franchise.  Imagine being a dry, parched traveler in the desert of championships, on the quest for gold. Finally, you stumble across a gold nugget. Is this any reason to celebrate? Is this any reason to jump in the streets, shout, and cry?   Winning one championship does not merit celebration. What matters are *dynamics* - a history of SUSTAINED dominance in the NBA! Championship franchises understand this. True fans of the Los Angeles Lakers understand this. Poverty franchises do not.  But what's more, it's become evident that 29 of the current NBA franchises are all poverty franchises. The only exception is the Los Angeles Lakers.  ""But what about the Boston Celtics? They also have 17 championships."" yes, but they frontloaded 11 of their rings in an era with just eight teams. The Celtics have won 1 championship since 1986 - 35 years ago. That is not sustained dominance. That is what we call a fluke.  The Los Angeles Lakers have won in every era. Fast pace, slow pace, high parity, low parity, the Lakers have won it all.   When the Celtics began the trend of artificial superteams 2007, it was Kobe Bryant who stopped them from being remembered as a dynasty.   When the Spurs formed a natural dynastic franchise, it was Shaq and Kobe - and later Kobe - who made sure to knock them out in the playoffs in most of their meetings.  When Larry Bird was looking dominant and won 3 MVPs in a row, it was Magic Johnson who made sure to limit him to only three rings.  When the NBA just started, it was George Mikan who established the Lakers as the premier franchise from the get-go with five rings.  A winner's mentality is about the long-term, not the short run. This is why I'm still adamant that the AD trade was a bad trade - sure we got *one* ring out of it, but we gave up a future GOAT contender in Lonzo Ball, a future 3-time MVP in Brandon Ingram, and a future 5x All-Defensive 1st Team player in Josh Hart. With AD, we get maybe one or two rings. With the aforementioned 3, we get 6 or 7 rings.  But no matter! Bucks fans should be CRYING right now - because the Bucks just won a ring at the expense of the weakest Western Conference Finalist since 1986, since Bucks fans seem so overjoyed, Giannis no longer feels a sense of duty to Milwaukee. He will thus demand a trade to the Lakers by the end of August, and will suit up for the Purple and Gold at the start of the 2021-2022 season alongside LeBron, AD, Dame, and Lonzo, starting an 8-ring Laker dynasty."
You werent here when Josh Hart bought a second hand Switch off a dude on Reddit.
"Play in team in the West. Not sure you saw last years Pels which had Zo, Zion, Jrue and Ingram. Not to mention JJ and Josh Hart too. That team is roughly around the same tier and they fell short of the playoffs."
Josh Hart will be an All-Star next season
You do realize look who running you’re team. Since ad trade griff has only gotten rid of talent jrue left now lonzo about to leave and josh hart as well. Brandon Ingram will be next. Once that happen Zion will look to leave in like 3 years.
"At this point, theres only 2 cap heavy teams left that we haven't covered yet - Dallas and OKC. Theres also one that could open up significant space depending on how they decide to deal with their restricted guards and vets. The best FA left are Kelly Oubre Jr, Tim Hardaway Jr, Josh Hart, Bobby Portis and Otto Porter.    10. I expect Oubre to end up in Dallas as an intriguing two way player. He's supposedly someone they targeted at the deadline, and would be an offensive upgrade over Dorian Finney Smith. I'm also going to make a bold call and say that the Mavs are the best landing spot for Colin Sexton (lets say in a Sexton + Prince package for Josh Richardson, DFS and Cauley Stein...flame shield prepared). Dallas is under the clock to improve before Luka's max kicks in, and this is prohably their best route to add cheap talent while being in a position to pony up for Sexton's extension. All the while keeping flexibility on whether to dump Porzingis (for Kemba?!) or keep him. Let me be clear; I think its a mistake to trade Sexton but Cleveland seems determined to prioritize Garland and lean toward a small guard duo not working out long term. And the market is relatively dry for Sexton based on his salary demands and ability to translate performance into team success. This definitely figures to be a buyers market for Dallas. And I think they'll certainly bring back THJ, seeing quite a bit of success with him in a 6th man role. This positions them with a Doncic/Sexton/Oubre/Porzingis/Kleber starting 5.  11. The Pelicans are losing Lonzo, but I can't see them choosing not to match offers on Hart. He'll probably find a reasonable rate on the open market and fits well with their core. Its too hard to predict what trade target could elevate them to the next step with pick #10, a bunch of 2nds, Bledsoe and Adams (assuming no future picks in play because that would be pretty stupid) so I'm going to say they stay pretty similar. My crazy suggestion here is a Bledsoe for Buddy Hield type swap just based on whos left and readily available. They should just select Josh Giddey at 10 who force feeds Zion the ball and call it a day. By all accounts, Stan was not the right coach for this team, and maybe a fresh voice coupled with an age 25 Ingram, age 22 Zion and Steven Adams snot (correction: shot) can lift them into the playoffs.  12. I refuse to predict the Thunder. They hold all the power and will likely do something crazy to unwind this entire prediction by absorbing some star player who wasn't projected to move while acquiring 3 first round picks in the process. This on top of their 6 existing picks next week. The Thunder are scary, and NBA front offices should be doing everything possible to get Rob Hennigan a summer internship at Chesapeake arena so we can get their leaked whiteboard."
"Lakers trade AD to the Pelicans for Lonzo, Ingram, and Josh Hart."
josh hart is an impressive rebounder
"Lakers fan here hopeful of some big moves. Maybe a 3-team trade involving the pelicans.   Schroeder, Harrell, KCP, THT, and the first pick   For Lonzo, Steven Adams, Josh Hart"
"I'm drafting top 10 in a deep draft. It's not like I don't have a draft pick and have to go searching for veterans as my only option.    I have Zion who's 21 and can create his own shot. Brandon Ingram who's 23 and can create his own shot. NAW who is getting better and better as a combo guard with starting or 6th man potential who can also get his own shot and is 22. Already have a future big in Jaxson Hayes. Also have Lonzo and Josh Hart who are RFAs we can resign. I have no need to draft a guy with a high potential like a Moses Moody or a Keon Johnson or someone one &amp; done that will sit on the bench because he can't utilize a discernible skill right away to get on the court next to Zion or BI or over Hart/NAW/Hayes/Zo.   I'm drafting the highest star role player type I can get. Someone who knows they are a compliment piece to Zion/BI. Someone who's gonna play hard offensively and defensively. Someone who has a discernible skill like shooting or defense to get on the court as soon as possible. If that's Kispert, I go for it. Might be Trey Murphy, might be Franz Wagner.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why are you banking on a rookie being a quality role player?  I'm banking on Kispert to be a quality role player because he's shown 4 years of shooting 40.8% from 3 and the last two being 43.8% and 44% with 5.4 and 6.5 attempts per game. These are going to translate into the NBA right away unless he goes Markelle Fultz on us.   He's been asked to play his role in the NBA for 4 years at Gonzaga already. Court is getting bigger, defense is getting lazier in the regular season, pace is getting faster (not that Gonzaga wasn't already fast af), shooting is a bigger emphasize compared to college.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Build the rest of the roster with vets who have proven they can play in those spots.  Sure you can ALSO do that but I still have a draft pick in the top 10 now. I'll only trade that for Dame or another star player like Bradley Beal.   Phoenix did this same idea with Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson when ""draft experts"" thought there were better players available still. But they ended up getting their guys they wanted to build around Booker and Ayton. Atlanta as well with building around Trae Young with Hunter, Reddish, Huerter, and then went to spend money on Bogdanovic and somewhat overspent on Gallo.   There's no problem with spending on vets. But I still have to utilize this pick for my roster somehow.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;There’s already been reports about Zion’s family not wanting him outta New Orleans. If those are true, then next year has to be the year Zion and his team see some kind of progression within the organization.   Relax those are bluffs. He's literally 21. The probably with the Pelicans isn't the teams talent on the floor but more with ownership and market size. If he wants out after his rookie contract so be it. I think the last time someone led their team to a championship on a rookie contract was Tim Duncan. These things take time to build.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why would you give 23 mins a game to someone like Kispert when you can just Inquire about an Eric Gordon type to play the same role but better?  Because I have a draft pick and need to use it and should get someone to fit into the roster I have already constructed. Everyone is young still. I can go get vets but I still need to draft a player baring a superstar trade like Dame or Beal."
