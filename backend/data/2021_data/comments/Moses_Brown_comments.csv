Is he worth picking up in fantasy? I just gambled and dropped wood for moses brown after his like 2-3 good games. Been waiting for him to bounce back ever since
"Ik this sounds absurd but I see the thunder possibly. I think with their absurd amount of picks, they can draft some high potential players while having a cash cow of picks to trade for those low value, really good players that appear every offseason. I think Sam Presti has the ability to build a great, great team, especially considering he already has some great young pieces on the team like Shai, dort, aleksej, maledon and Moses brown (not sure about maledon and Moses but it’s what I’ve heard)"
"Lol, Moses Brown fucked us up too, but not 20/20 in half."
People think they have it bad before they see Moses Brown have a 20 and 20 first half against us
Imagine how good the Wiseman would be right now if he was sent to the GLeague like KPJ and Moses Brown instead of playing sparse NBA minutes early season.
All this to stop Moses Brown?
Nobody mentioning Poku/ Theo/ Moses Brown. Smh
"Holy shit y’all have this guy, SGA, Dort, Moses Brown, Maledon and about a million picks. I am terrified of what is about to be built over there. Presti’s rebuild was genius"
"I want to preface that I like him but he is extremely frustrating to watch sometimes: Moses Brown is my least favorite player to watch. So many face palm moments with him. I have 0 confidence in his ability to make a contested layup at the rim. A defender breathes on him and he just flails. He’s a ball stopper and when he gets it down low 99% of the time he’ll shoot first and think about the game later. He’s great when there are sets run where the conclusion ends with him getting an open look at the basket but if he has to improvise, it’s ugly."
"Moses Brown looks really young, too"
"I know this is a joke but it just shows how crazy talented NBA players are, even the fringe young ones.  Poku is awkward as hell but basketball IQ and skill are showing.  Theo dropped 33 in an NBA game last week.  Moses Brown had a 20/20 game two weeks ago.  Svi looks okay?  Kenrich is a +/- God on a terrible team.   And they still got crushed by another really young starting 5 vs the Pistons."
"Nah not at all, he has the timing &amp; awareness to make up for it on the defensive end &amp; the spacing n offensive skill on the other end. He reminds me of Ben Wallace - in fact, he’s bigger &amp; better than Big Ben was as a rookie.   But he may struggle against the Embiids of the league, idk how he’ll fare against the elite 7 footers. He eats up 7 footers regularly tho (Moses Brown, Wiseman, Markennen, Wood) so i think as he develops he’ll be able to hold his own against the elite ones. He’s only 19.  The Pistons coaching staff have been training him at the four, so I’d imagine they’re preparing for situations where his height puts the team at a disadvantage at the 5 based on the opposition.  Does he remind you of a young Serge Ibaka ?"
"What happened to Moses Brown, he was shitting on us like a week ago."
Moses “Nikola” Brown
"Should have kept Moses Brown, TJ Leaf is booty"

Is this the same Robert Willaims that Moses Brown dropped 22 points and 24 rebounds on?
"Tanking aside, one could easily argue it's legitimately better for the team to dedicate all the PF/C minutes they can to their many young guys who actually need the PT to develop. And by god, they have so many of them:  1. Developing Poku should be their #1 priority in the frontcourt. Very exciting player. 2. Isiah Robi looks promising   4. Darius Bazley is quickly turning into a potentially great stretch big who can get you 15/10 every night  3. Moses Brown is young and needs minutes 4. They also recently acquired Tony Bradley from Philly, and he's been averaging like 20 MPG over the past 4 games, minutes he needs and certainly wouldn't get with Horford back in the rotation.  Horford is not really much of an asset for the squad, he was traded to OKC as a salary dump for Danny Green. At best, you'd call him ""salary _filler_ for Danny Green"", but even then you'd be disingenuous. The main assets OKC got were Theo Maledon and the future first.  I would argue sitting old man Horford isn't about tanking necessarily, because if OKC didn't even have their pick, they still wouldn't play him much (if at all). Whose young guy from that list would you take away minutes from?"
"I can't laugh - like I said, I haven't watched him. The one game he played against the Sixers, he was matched up with Dakota Mathias due to the Sixers missing most of their roster due to COVID protocol. Mathias is, as far as I can tell, completely out of the league after getting cut by the Sixers in January.  I've actually written a lot about the Age 23 Leap. [This](http://www.busterducks.com/2017/reference-series-age/) is from 2017 and it's been updated a bit by various other articles I wrote, but that's probably still the most succinct breakdowns of it. Hunter was one of the worst players in the league as a 22 year old and may have morphed into a decent or better player as a 23 year old. Such is the power of the Age 23 Leap.  I always make it clear that ultimately, draft projection is just that - projection. I hit on about 60% of my projections, which puts me above literally every national analyst (and most NBA teams), but also means that I miss on about 40% of my projections. A lot of fans think projection is a lot more predictable it is, but there's nothing predictable about it. If I asked you, right now: Will Cam Reddish develop a 3P shot by the time he turns 25? You can make an educated guess, but it's just a guess, and being right about it doesn't make anybody smart or dumb, it's basically just a 50/50 chance right now. If he develops a 3P shot, he's a good or better 3-and-D wing who should be starting. If he doesn't, he's an end of the bench guy. I've found that most fans don't like to accept that there's more random chance involved on a lot of these guys than some sort of magical foresight.  As a result, I have some beautiful hits - I had Moses Brown as a first rounder, when nobody else had him as draftable. I also have some hilarious misses - I had Jeremiah Martin as a first rounder, when nobody else had him as draftable. But the fact that there's ""consensus"" on more than a handful of players is always wild to me, because so much of the draft is pure guesswork that there really shouldn't be agreement on most players."

Moses Brown. His ceiling is a backup center and I’m someone who hates putting ceilings on guys. He just has no offensive package and I don’t see any tools to get a whole lot better than he is right now.
Moses Brown is literally better than Wiseman at every aspect. hes also bigger and faster. why wasn't he drafted #2 overall? dude was undrafted
"It would not necessarily destroy his confidence, it might build him back up. Look at Poole, KPJ, Moses Brown. Front office embarrassment shouldn’t factor in."
I wouldn't trade undrafted Moses Brown for Wiseman
Undrafted Moses Brown &gt; Wiseman
Thunder:  SGA  Hordford  Dort  Kenny Hustle  Mike Muscala  Darius Bazley  Moses Brown  Isaiah Roby  Theo Meldeon   Why TF can't we tank. Lol.
Moses Brown and CJ McCollum
"Moses ""Pants Go All The Way Up"" Brown"
I thought r/NBA agreed to stop using initials for these lesser known players. As a Moses Brown and Tate owner after Horford and Robinson went out/down who is this other potential gem?   And stop using initials unless everyone knows the player
"To be fair Moses Brown appears to be an excellent rebounder (in a small sample, obviously)."
Moses Brown and Svi? How much help does Lu Dort need
"I mean, he did have to play against Moses “Reboundimus Prime” Brown."
"I was fine with the comments calling it an own-goal. But in the replay it was clear that Moses Brown actually [tipped it up and in through Baynes' hands,](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2021/03/31/0022000727/266/fcaf9d03-0b44-f27a-4a82-48a5179d5efb_1280x720.mp4) it most certainly was not an own-goal."
And against a front court of Moses Brown and Isiah Roby. If I put up a performance like that at work today my ass would be fired.
"This is an inane comment for multiple reasons, first of which being: any team comprised mainly of young players needs a veteran presence. Last year we had Chris Paul - who was clearly better than Horford is which in turn contributed to us making the playoffs after trading away the franchise cornerstone along with an MVP candidate.   Second, “players are just better than Presti thought” is doubly asinine since OKC actually has a competent GM, ownership and Front Office. Compare OKC with Minny and you should be able to understand the difference.   Thirdly, “Players are playing better than expected” is only a cogent thought if you think players just _decide_ to be good players, and scouts, coaches and other FO execs are only ever playing lottery with talent and gameplans (as in, “hey we thought he’s gonna be a good player and yay we guessed right, he is!”). Put Svi or Maledon or Moses Brown on the Timberwolves and they’d suck ass as much as any other player on that team."

"Moses ""demigod"" brown exist.   On a real note, Moses brown is Hella a steal, being able to be a consistent scorer and a really good rebounder.   The team also have young players that sometime light up once in a blue moon that contribute them to win games. Playing hard as a team even without any veterans avaible on the floor every night ( I believe Al horford Barely play anymore)"
Moses Brown has been so fun to watch. Really looking forward to seeing his development over the next few years
"Thunder: SGA(or Dort): Canadian Maledon: France Poku: Serbia Moses Brown: USA Svi: Ukraine  Our starting 5 last year had more Canadians than Americans (CP3-US, Dort/SGA-Canada, Gallo-Italy, Adam’s-NZ). Throw in DS17 (Germany) for Dort and that’s 5 countries represented."
Why was Moses Brown undrafted?  Dude is killing it on the boards
"Moses brown is so god damn good, im rooting for the thunders future"
You mean like Moses Brown?
Going for a top 3 every year has brought a lot of pain to franchises. It's not too much of a difference I mean the Pelicans got Zion. Moses Brown looks incredibly legit and seeing what he has is worth winning games.
The Moses Brown effect.
"MOSES ""WILT THE STILT"" BROWN"
Not sure if Moses Brown or Moses Malone.
Moses Brown Raptors killer 😭
Can OKC just give us Moses Brown please? Ya'll got a million 1st round picks in the war chest!
"Funny you say that. My buddies and I are crossing our fingers that scenario happens, while also hoping Portland starts allowing fans before that lol.   My friend’s a Bucks fan first but a Dame fan second, and we wanna visit Portland for a finals game.   And yeah, same to you. Very excited to see what Moses Brown does for you guys, dude looks legit."
"We gotta give credit to OKCs player development staff too.  They are developing young talent really well: Brodie, KD, harden, ibaka, Adams, Jeff green.   And this guy Moses brown. I remember him not being alright in college. Now he’s getting 20 20"
All this to stop Moses Brown. Smh.
Damn. Please let me know if you were able to cash in on the koj or Moses brown sweepstakes atleast.
moses brown too
He didn't draft Moses Brown either
"Moses Brown is a rebounding specialist who just got signed to a 4 year contract. So no, they are definitely not dead."
"Sure, and lebrons contract is also exploitative, in fact if we’re talking relative to actual value his is probably grossly more exploitative than Moses’. Lotta people who didn’t know who Moses Brown was 5 days ago are suddenly up in arms about him being the leagues most underpaid player after they see he had a good game on Reddit."
"SGA 6'6""  Kenrich Williams 6'7""  Poku 7'0""  Muscala 6'10""  Moses Brown 7'2""  Not even a stretch. All of those play/have played those positions."
They are basically doing that this season and already probably won too many games to get as high of pick they wanted.   This team could have fought for the 10th seed if they weren't resting everyone and played rotations that actually made sense.   SGA developed into a fringe all-star. Dort is a solid NBA starter that would be in any teams rotation. And Poku doesn't look completely lost anymore. Theo Maledon looks like steal in the 2nd round. Moses Brown is basically prime Shaq. Only disappointment has been Bazely but he's still only 20 years old.   Difference is OKC has a plan from the top down. The plan is very clear and everyone is on-board from the Owners to Front Office to the Coach to the Players.   I mean fuck Al Horford has been in OKC for 5 months and is already on board with the tank.
The chances that Moses Brown is even in the league for four more years are slim.
ur overrating moses brown and dort man
"Well they are going benefit, it would be crazy seeing sga and cade on the same team with moses brown and dort"
"Draft and develop as many good players as possible, build a team with home grown talent around SGA   Hopefully draft another star to be our #1/#2 or 1a-b type of guy with SGA, surrounded with really good role players like Dort/Bazley/Moses brown (maybe?), Poku, Theo, etc. Maybe one of those guys pans out and is another really solid starter.  When a disgruntled star wants out, who will have the picks to get him? Okc. They'll also have enough picks AND talent to not gut their team to trade for him."

Is Moses Brown the one from that famous gif?
Blazers legend Moses Brown
I wish we hadn't given up Moses Brown.    But hey.  Can't blame Olshey for that either.
"I didn't watch the OKC - Celtics game yesterday because of Vucevic's debut game. I woke up today to ""Moses Brown dropped a 20/20"". I'm really sorry."
"Yes. Ferguson went to the Knicks, Rivers to OKC. The Thunder are waiving Rivers to create a roster spot for Mr. 20-20, Moses Brown."
"Welcome to the full roster, Moses Brown! You’ve earned it!"
THAT IS MOSES BROWN MUSIC!
Moses Brown put this to bed right?
"1. Jokic  2. Donic 3. Ingram  4. Demar(trade pending) 5. Levert 6. KPJ 7. Timelord 8. Moses brown  9. Garland  10. Nance  11. PJ Washington   I’ve made a lot of trades this year, that’s how I got jokic to pair with my luca. 6-11 is pretty interchangeable in terms of value imo. I think KPJ could be one of my better players by end of season tho."
"Moses Brown dropped a 20 point 20 rebound game against a championship caliber team last night. Embiid and D Howard both vouch that we should build around Tony Bradley. Yes, we are tanking but we are winning games and playing competitive basketball, and definitely exploring the roster. I'm okay with letting these young fellas try to prove themselves and earn a paycheck. In fact it is kinda fun."
Moses Brown had 23 rebounds. That’s a lotta roast beef.

"Moses ""Malone"" Brown"
The Blazers had Moses Brown on a 2-way and racked up DNP’s last year. The league already wilted on this front. SMH. /s  This is likely a case of a rebuilding team and the star not complaining to the league? Not sure.
Moses Brown is a BEAST. He's going to be doing that to most teams.
Moses brown had his career night against us and we shipped Wendell out to Orlando. Moses out there tearing up rosters already.
Moses Brown is gonna win so many people their fantasy leagues lmao.
"Gotta let my man Moses Brown pull his shorts up over his velly button and spread his wings. Nope, no sir commissioner, definitely no tanking taking place here."
Moses Brown just had a 20/20 game against them that's why.
"Well hopefully by then sga has become a super star, Dort has become the cooler version of prime draymond, Moses brown has developed into a consistent monster, we’ve drafted another good player and we’ve used a few of our 34 picks from now until 2027 to trade for a superstar. 3 of those things are very likely, and the other two we’ll see in the next couple of years."
"He's been fine. Good passer and floor spacer, not the player he used to be but nowhere near unplayable.   If they had some lotto pick rookie center that needed time instead it'd be one thing, but instead they're just going to keep throwing Moses Brown out there and see what happens."
"If you are watching thunder games this season then A. They aren't on national tv(lol) and B. You would rather watch Poku toss up bricks 9/10 games for the 1 game he pops off and dream about the future. Plus Moses Brown put up a 20 20 game tonight. Young players are fun as fuck to watch not ""bad product"". We know Horford is good but we also know he's not good enough to do anything but make us miss out on the draft."
Moses Brown has been with the Thunder most of the season.
"He was playing behind Moses Brown, who is the best center in the g-league (made first team all-gleague). heat probably went for Yurtseven over Brown because of Yurtseven's spacing"
"In the G-League he was easily a top 5 center in terms of offensive skill, honestly might have even been the third best offensive center behind Bball Paul and his teammate Moses Brown. His defense left a lot to be desired, but definitely worthy of a shot in the nba!"
"They don’t have the worst defense in just the league, they would have the worst defense by 80+ in nba history.  Let’s take the worst team in the league right now, let’s say thunder. How the hell would Curry ever get one stop on defense against Bazely 6’8 Moses Brown 7’2 and poku 7’ starting? One stop, where he stops the opponent from scoring as a 6’3 average defender and manages to actually get the board against centers?  They would never get a stop without fouling, and the opponent could literally just hoist from 3, then get the rebound every time"
"But how does Curry even attempt to guard Bazley and Moses brown on thunder (worst team in the league probably rn)?   There’s no way he would get one stop, these guys are mobile enough on defense, and they would score/get fouled every single possession. They are 6’10 and have 100 pounds on Curry. He would never get a board even after misses"

Moses brown becoming a walking double double hopefully he gets some all-defense love
"You guys literally found Moses Brown out of nowhere.  He’s already a double double threat.  Is he the best defensively, no.  But he’s shown to be a quality center in the league.  Bazley is a quality rotation PF.  And Poli has a ton of potential when he isn’t asked to do so much.  He’s probably never gonna be a star but he is a 7 footer with ball handling ability and interesting help defense tools.  Nvm the fact that Shai is already a top 40 player at worst.  He’s better than anybody on any team in the lottery outside of Towns.  And Dort frankly might be better than anyone not named Towns as well.

"Did they ever say anything about ""accidentally winning""? You can call it blatant tanking all you want, but OKC has made it clear to the league that the organization AND the player agreed that he would sit down because of ""player development"".  We have been playing Moses Brown, Tony Bradley, and Isaiah Roby, who are the young players that we gave a chance. What is the league supposed to do? Force a player to half ass games instead of letting the young guys have minutes?"

"Yes, because we wanted to play Moses Brown, who inked a contract just after the Horford sit down, Tony Bradley, who just got traded to the team, and Roby, who had over achieved in the Center spot all year.  You can call it tanking, the organization called it ""player development"" and we are playing the young players more minutes, aren't we?"
Lmao at Moses Brown trying to walk under Draymond and looking offended when he nearly gets kicked in the head
"Oh boy, here come the posts   [""The fine has more to do with transparency (or lack thereof) from the team""](https://twitter.com/jlew1050/status/1383546493437505542?s=21)  Al Horford decided to sit down because he agreed with the team moving forward with a path toward ""player development"". You can call it tanking all you want and say it's a disgrace to competition or whatever, but I think it's better for everyone that we see Moses Brown or Tony Bradley, two players who have something to prove and is fighting for their literal NBA lives, play than Al Horford half ass games because he's forced to.  Anyone who argues otherwise most likely does not actually watch our games and is just mad we managed to get to third best odds for the draft."
Offensively Mulder is inconsistent unless it's garbage time.  Defensively he might be the worst guard in the league. He doesn't have the strength to keep guys from blowing through him and he has low IQ so he makes terrible reads and times rotations horribly. And he makes unnecessary movements. For example the other night Moses Brown was coming over to set a screen for Ty Jerome and Mulder jumped it prematurely 35 feet from the basket which lead to a wide open 3
"I think he was just trying to land safety. Moses Brown ran directly into his butt while he was hanging there, so he didn't know if someone was under him."
I think it’s because Moses Brown was right under the rim so he had to hang a bit. And refs are more lenient on him
5’5” here and I had to guard Cole Anthony and his crazy explosiveness in practice and also got a million floaters punted out by Moses Brown. Morning practice was a bitch because I’d have to scrim with future NBA players and then proceed to take hard ass classes.
"How many do.  Detroit has Stewart who has proven to be an intriguing prospect and certainly flashes potential as a starting caliber big.  OKC has Moses Brown and his rebounding is a huge weapon.  We have WCJ with his versatile defense and rim running.  Houston has Christian a wood.  Minny has Towns.  Cleveland has Jarrett Allen in restricted free agency.  Every lottery team has a center prospect that they want to either develop or has proven to be capable of playing 25 minutes a night as a starter.  Most teams downsize anyway so it’s not like they need a big man for 35 minutes as their first,second or third option.  I’d rather pay all of those guys 10 million a year going forward than eventually having to give Evan Mobley his rookie extension if he isn’t going to be able to be the best player on a championship team.  If he can be that guy than frankly he should be the clear cut number one pick because Superstar big men are extremely valuable but starting centers or lower tier all star centers are frankly found everywhere in the league.  A team can sign Richaun Holmes and probably get a decent starting center who can switch and run the pick and roll.  Star guards and wings are steal way more valuable for championship teams these days."
Moses brown was dropping on draymond green/curry screens... like wtf. He has to be worst player in NBA? Or their coach is awful telling him to do that?
"Most of these are not really on Dort... second one he got burned, third shot he shouldn’t be cheating off curry that much (which lol he’s right on him but you need to be, like, uncomfortably in his face,) but most of them are the lack of recognition by Moses brown that a screen is coming and he needs to show big time and double... easy action to get curry open if that’s how he’s gonna play it."

"To answer the Al Horford question, it is most likely that he did not get the value that Presti wanted during the trade deadline. Even though people can see him as a negative asset, it will definitely be a lot easier to trade him during the offseason with more time and the remainder of the year off his contract. Will it happen? I am not sure, but I have seen Presti pull magic out of his ass numerous times. If he gets injured during the time period between the deadline and end of season, that little value immediately goes out of the window.  It was stated in the article that the team was going to look for options for him after the season ends, but at this point, the best option for the team is playing Moses Brown, who we recently signed, and see what we can get."

"I thought the most surprised I’d be watching a game this season was when Moses fucking Brown put up 17pts/19reb in the first half against the Celtics, but Russ proved me wrong. Legit thought he might break the assist record"
.... we can’t focus on player development while tanking? We aren’t sacrificing player minutes. You can only argue that about Horford but 1. We would rather give his minutes to players who could stand to benefit from it 2. Teams already know what kind of player horford is and the thunder had him sit out since he can’t really increase his stock any higher and they don’t wanna risk an injury when the plan is to trade him soon 3. The thunder have always looked at the g league and undrafted prospects for hidden gems since last season it’s how we ended up with Moses brown and lu dort.
"I know it's hard for you to understand, but the Thunder really are interested in developing the players that they are testing out right now. That's literally the point of resting Al Horford. He's 100% gone next year, so we might as well see if Moses Brown or Bradley is any good. We would be doing it even if we were in Houston's spot - guaranteed #1 lottery odds. And as Icarpet noted, Bazely, Poku, Maledon, Roby, Kenrich, and Ty Jerome will 100% be back next year and we are using this time to develop them. You haven't been paying attention to the Thunder at all. You just buy into this narrative that everything the Thunder have done is tanking. It's not. Certainly tanking is part of it, but there's a lot more nuance here, just like there is in Detroit. Literally same GM tree.  And keep putting that tinfoil hat on about ""excuses"" with Shai and Dort's injuries. They are real. Just because we are tanking, doesn't mean players can't get hurt."
"You would still be forcing a player to play when he doesn’t want to.   Sure, OKC is not playing good basketball right now, but I rather see players such as Moses Brown and Tony Bradley instead of forcing Al Horford, who doesn’t want to play anymore, to suit up."

"&gt;Regardless like not a single team in the league wouldn’t trade 5 first round drafts picks in a row for a ring.  Would Boston trade Tatum and Brown for one ring?  If Tatum and Brown subsequently went on to win 5 rings for their new team, would you say Boston won or lost that trade?  What you are failing miserably to understand is that some assets are actually worth more than one ring, because they could lead to multiple rings.  The Portland trade, in particular, likely cost that franchise at least several rings -- potentially far more, when you recall that a few years later, Portland drafted Sam Bowie ahead of Michael Jordan, and they never would've if they still had Moses.  Portland almost certainly traded a dynasty for one first round pick, which they blew."
"Heir is a difference between developing young players to be better and putting them in a position to fail so that your pick is maximized.  Moses Brown has proven to be an awesome player  and unless he got hurt in the Pacers game, there was no reason for him to only play 18 minutes.  It’s already a blow out so have him run for 30.  The extra twelve ain’t hurting him.  Dort has improved tremendously yet he got a dnp for an injury that no one is aware of.  Nobody thinks Kenrich Williams is a great difference maker yet he’s clearly the best wing available and yet he doesn’t get over thirty minutes.  That’s hella sketchy.  Same with Ty Jerome.  He’s the best guard you have with SGA out.  He’s nothing special but isn’t it a slap in the face of a player like him trying to make it in the league and get paid to give him a coaches DNP because he’s slightly better than who you have on the court.  Detroit resting dudes is silly but they at least throw out all of their young guys for extended minutes even the good ones like Isiah Stewart who might screw up the tank.  Houston is giving Kevin Porter and Christian Wood all they can eat while they are healthy and if they lose they lose but at least they want to see what two cornerstones can do when healthy so they know who can be put around them.  We have no choice but to play our vets because we are so injured we just gotta play whoever is healthy to field an actually team.  We don’t have DNP luxuries.  I’d wish OkC fans can see why certain other fans find their non transparent tanking methods to be awful for the league."
"Why do you care? Were you watching Thunder games when Horford was playing?   However ""bad"" this may be for the league (btw, it's really not) the Thunder have every right AND incentive to focus on developing young talent rather than play Horford 30 minutes a night. We know what Horford is. He's a solid big man. But he's not even close to being in the plans for what the future of the Thunder holds. And that's what this year has been all about. The future. So the Thunder are giving our young players a look. Moses Brown, Tony Bradley have some potential attached to them. They're seeing if anything is there. That's the strategy."
"Yes, because it was a mutual agreement between him and the organization.   What’s the point of playing Horford when he’s not part of the future when we can play Moses Brown (who was a big part of our G League team), Tony Bradley, and Isaiah Roby (who earned minutes this season)?   If the NBA wants us to suddenly win, it’s easy, just give us the first and fifth pick."

"I mean shai, dort and horford will win you some games. Throw in some great games from poku, theo, moses brown we would probably have had a better record than the raptors if we had not rested shai"
Kind of salty post from r/nba. Literally every other team does it and I never seen anyone complaining. If you don't want to believe SGA and Dort is actually injured then that's your problem. Why would we play Horford when we can develop a young player like Moses Brown. Sixers did it God knows how many years and actually had a slogan. Heck even Knicks have been doing it. I don't want to hear it.
"This was my first time playing fantasy, long time gambling addict and degenerate so I knew a lot but I had some growing pains, especially in an 18 man league. I took KAT, he went down with his wrist, then covid, traded him and Lavine (rip), and Lamarcus Aldridge (dodged a bullet) for Beal, De'Andre Hunter (went down for the entire season pretty much for me) Divencenzo.. eventually I ended up with Giannis and Sabonis which has been huge for me; I've lucked out on a lot of waiver wire players, Moses Brown, Bruce Brown, Diallo had a hot streak for me, etc.  The easiest way to win in fantasy is to punt 4 categories. I try to go for FG%, rebounds, blocks, steals, and then the last one is usually a toss up for assists or t/o's (I have Draymond.. Dray+Sabonis+Giannis has given me so many assists this season)  Next time I'll be able to hone in on that fifth category lol. Sometimes I win ft% even."

"Exactly. If you are tanking you might as well start random young g-league/undrafted talent and see what happens. Sometimes they are complete trash and sometimes you find gems like Robert Covington, Lu Dort, Moses Brown, Christian Wood etc."
"You’re underestimating how bad everyone on our team is outside of SGA/Dort/Horford/Williams. Oubre/Wiggins easily start obviously. Poole/Looney/Lee/Bazemore easily play more than the rest of our team.  Our current rotation with no SGA and Horford, only Dort and Jerome can create decent offense. Dort is also our only plus defender really. Bazley/Poku are brick masters. I know they have potential but they play really bad, but at least Bazley has played great since his return. Roby/Moses Brown are also a horrible rotation. Luckily they’re getting this experience to develop though. I hope Bazley can become RJ Barrett-esque and maybe Moses can be something like young DeAndre Jordan."

"Look all I know is that our 19 year old rookies (Maledon and Poku) are getting like 30 minutes per game of raw NBA experience and they have been so legit exciting to watch since the all star break. (There's been a big improvement in play lately. And there are more positives things than negative every game now).  Like these guys would normally be college freshman in the US (Poku would still be in high school). Their younger than most of the 2020 draft and we get to oversee and micromanage their development. Whatever draft position we do end up with, these current rook's are ending the season on a high note. (Seriously Poku was getting 20 mpg before the G league and it was a fucking nightmare)   Also--our ""development year"" is allowing us to see and put to practice Lu Dort's offensive potential. This undrafted 20 year old got 42 points with us in his second year. I don't think any competitive teams would let Lu Dort shoot 31 times in a game  Also this season has allowed us to discover how tasty of snacks Kenny hustle and Ty Jerome are. Seriously Ty Jerome went from a 28% 3pt shooter to 40%. And we found out about Moses Brown.   So I am still pretty feeling good about what we've found out about the team this season."
Nah Dort is next to Poku and Moses Brown. He’s winning at least 2 finals MVPs by 23.
"We have Looney as our only real 5, and then JTA and Dray filling in lol. I’m scared of Moses Brown"
"They forgot Moses Brown, the next Ibaka though."

"Simons tries and it's getting better. There's only so much you can expect out of a young project guard.  The rest is on Stotts refusing to teach defense and play better defenders. We've got Nassir Little, DJJ and RHJ rotting on the bench. None of them are going to look great camping out on the 3pt line like Stotts wants in this offense, but then even Powell is having issues with that. All 3 are great athletes who could at least help situationally and should be getting a lot of Melo's minutes.   Plus we made a bad call on Moses Brown, who has looked interesting for the Thunder and would give us another option instead of Kanter."
"No he would not. He has no handle or shot creation ability (thinking about it now, he has no offensive ability at all) and if he can’t make open looks next to ben Simmons and Embiid he sure as hell won’t never to Darius fucking Bazley and Moses Brown."
"Most modern well-known?   Probably.  ----------------------------  But the worst owner of all time?  Let me introduce you to John Y. fucking Brown Jr. Welcome to my TED Talk.   ------------------------------------------  * In 1973, he bought majority share and became the owner of the Kentucky Colonels.  * He appointed his wife and 10 other women to be the Board of Directors.   * After hearing this news, the GM of the Colonels resigned as he believed this meant John Y Brown Jr was going to run the team however he wanted, no questions asked.   * At the same time, the Colonels head coach resigned for the same reasons.   ----------------------------  * Then he hired future Hall of Famer Hubie Brown to his first ever professional coaching job, which led to the Colonels winning the championship their first season.  * Even though the Colonels were towards the top in attendance and had just won the championship, John Y Brown Jr claimed he lost hundreds of thousands of dollars.  * How did he make this money back? He fucking sold hometown state hero Dan Issel to another team.  * He fucks around for 2 or 3 years and then when the ABA-NBA merger happens, he refuses to pay 3 million dollars for the Colonels to join, which directly leads to the Pacers joining the NBA.  ----------------------------------  Does it end there? Of fucking course not.  * Months later, after selling the team claiming financial trouble, he buys half-ownership of the Buffalo Braves, AKA the future LA Clippers.   * In his 1st season with the Clippers, he eventually buys the remaining 50% shares and becomes sole owner.  * Before the team had been sold to John Y. Brown Jr, the previous owner of the Buffalo Braves had a handshake deal in place to sell the team for $6,100,000 to hotel owner Irving Cowan, who would then move the team to Miami. The city of Buffalo filed a $10,000,000 damage lawsuit against the team to block the move, which led to the sale eventually falling through. Because of this, the Braves would then sign a 15-year lease for the arena they played in, with a provision that the lease would be voided if the team did not sell more than 5,000 season tickets in any given season.  * John Y. Brown Jr knew of this provision, and knew he could sell the team for a profit if the lease was voided. He intended to tank the Buffalo Braves to the point they were beyond awful, so that less than 5,000 season tickets would be sold and they'd be out of their lease on the arena.  * NBA legend and Hall of Famer Jack Ramsay, the head coach of the Buffalo Braves, caught wind of what John Y. Brown Jr intended to do and resigned, becoming the head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers, where they would go on to win the 1976-77 NBA Championship the following season.  * He trades Bob McAdoo to the New York Knicks for cash and John Gianelli, who was nothing more than a bench center that averaged 7/6 for his career.  * He then traded a 1st round pick in the 1978 NBA draft and $232,000 in cash to the Blazers for Moses Malone (who had just selected him 5 months prior in the ABA supplemental draft, bad luck again for the Blazers).  * 6 days later, John Y. Brown Jr trades Moses Malone to the Houston Rockets for 1977 and 1978 1st round picks.  -----------------------  It has to end there right? Fuck no.   * In 1978 along with co-owner Harry T. Mangurian Jr, they trade franchises with Celtics owner Irv Levin. Irv Levin would then eventually move the Buffalo Braves to San Diego, where they would be rebranded as the San Diego Clippers.  * Two weeks before the franchise swap was made official, John Y. Brown Jr made one final trade as the owner and GM of the Buffalo Braves.  * He traded Nate ""Tiny"" Archibald, Billy Knight, and Marvin Barnes to the Celtics for Freeman Williams, Kevin Kunnert, and Kermit Washington without consulting or even talking to team president and legendary coach Red Auerbach.  * Not wanting to strain the relationship any further with Celtics legend Red Auerbach, John Y. Brown Jr then trades three future 1st round picks (all in 1979) for Bob McAdoo, once again without consulting or even talking to Red Auerbach. Bob McAdoo would play only 20 games with the Celtics.  * The relationship between John Y. Brown Jr and Red Auerbach was so bad that Red Auerbach nearly took a job with the Knicks.  * Shortly afterwards, Harry T. Mangurian Jr bought out John Y. Brown Jr's ownership shares, and in 1979, Harry T. Mangurian Jr officially became the sole owner of the Boston Celtics. Under his ownership, the Celtics would win the 1980-811 NBA Championship, before eventually being forced to sell the team in 1983.  -------------------------------------"

shai dort bazley poku theo  next up would probably be moses brown.
Lmao. You really think Boston gonna want Moses Moody and Wiggins over Jaylen Brown?
"&gt; I think it’s worse to sit healthy players  well, that's a really convenient way to draw your ethical lines isn't it.  gutting your roster is somehow better than sitting a player that you couldn't trade mid-season and will trade in the off-season anyway?  that doesn't make any sense.  it might make sense if Horford was in his prime and OKC forced him to waste a year of his career, but that isn't what happened.  Horford is old and injury prone.  He wants to play for a contender.  Horford sat by mutual agreement.    It benefited both parties because Horford got to rest up until OKC finds a suitable trade partner.  They tried to trade him mid-season but they couldn't find a good landing spot for him.  Would it have been better if they had forced him to use up what's left of his knees in meaningless games for a lottery bound team?  No.  Also, you're making it sound like OKC didn't have young big men they needed to give minutes for development.  That just makes it obvious that you're judging them without even having watched their games.  OKC has two very interesting young players in Pokusevski and Moses Brown who they were able to give major minutes by sitting Horford.  Giving those guys minutes over Horford made sense."
there's only 2 degrees between IT and Moses Brown lol. Hassan Whiteside for Kings/Blazers
lolll did moses brown and moses malone
"I think the Pistons, with Hayes/Bey/Stewart/Sekou/this year's pick are up there. Thunder with SGA/Dort/Bazley/Poku/Maldeon/Ty Jerome/Moses Brown are one of the deepest."
"I think Dort's contact is so long and cheap because he was signed as a 2 way player? OKC also gave a similar contract to Moses Brown. I think 2 way players have limited options and must stick with their team for their first regular contract,  at a much reduced value even compared to rookie scale contracts."
OKC was not resting Horford. They decided to sit him and let our younger big men like Moses Brown and Aleksej Pokusevski get minutes to develop.
"I agree, but Shai hesi drives don't define our season. If we look back on this year we'll remember tanking, developing guys, plumbing the depths of our g league roster for hidden gems. So it makes sense for 'season defining shot' to be a Jaylen Hoard brick, or Moses Brown putback. I'd submit Poku's missed dunk/murder attempt as a pretty good encapsulation of our season. Lots of potential and a long way to go. https://streamable.com/2cz734"

He made Moses Brown look like prime Dikembe out there.
Portland Trailblazers legend Moses Brown coming through in the clutch
I have made a comment somewhere saying Moses Brown was the worst NBA player I’ve seen touch the floor  I don’t stand by that statement
He was matched up vs oturu lol. Moses brown legit sucked all season. Guy has 0 game right now. Def dont want him on raps
"Poku is such an intriguing player.  His shooting and ball handling is really impressive for a guy that size who is only 19.  OKC has so many good young players in addition to a dump truck full of first round picks.  Shai, Dort, Poku, Bazley, Moses Brown.  They could be a really good team in a few years."
Moses Brown is 5th in blocks in a single game for the season.
Wtf did I just watch.  I’ve never seen two teams try to lose before like this. Thankfully Poku and Moses Brown were playing like it was game 1 of the G League finals out there.
"As far as season ending baskets go, that one by Moses Brown was nice"
What about BLAZERS LEGEND MOSES BROWN
Moses Brown has finally contributed for Portland
Who the hell is Moses Brown and why is he so good?!? Exactly who the Raptors need.
"Moses Brown?  more like Moses Malone, amirite?"
"ayo why we up at the half take out moses 7/10, poku (6/7), and Roby (5/8). leave in Theo and Charlie Brown."
"OKC starting lineup is   Theo  Josh Hall, maybe the worst player in the league  Poku, statistically the worst player in the league  Roby   Moses Brown"
Lmao fuck no we can’t   Demarcus cousins might get 20/10 tonight with Moses brown defending him
"Only answer is OKC. They already have an all nba guard in the making in SGA. If they continue to develop to their potential you can picture a pretty good team just based on the prospects on the roster already. They literally had to bench all of their good players so they could lose and land another top pick. This team could’ve easily been in the play in if they tried.  Dort - elite defender, has continued to refine his scoring and shooting. I don’t know if all star is in future but I can see developing similar to how Jaylen Brown came into the league and developed to what he is today.  Poku - wide range of outcomes for him but his ceiling could even be higher than Dort’s  Bazley - athletic wing, if he can get his shot down he can be a killer small ball 4.   Also additional guys like Jerome, Maledon and Moses Brown are solid role players.  Not even to mention the best part, they could potentially have 2 top 5 picks in this draft. Oh and tbh own all of the entire clippers future plus many additional picks.   When horford is traded they’ll have basically of their cap space. Not that it means they’ll get big free agents to come to play in OKC but they can round out their roster with smart signings or use it to take on additional bad contracts to get picks."
Moses Brown really gonna foul out guarding Rudy. Has that ever happened before
"This “put up good numbers against professionals” stuff is hella overblown. I love Green too but we gotta stop pretending like the g league is something it ain’t. For one, there’s 0 rim protection down there, all the centres are 6’8 or smaller. He put up 17 points a game on OK splits in only 16 games, only 1 month of basketball. In that small sample size you’d wanna see better production from someone touted as a generational scorer, I mean Cade scored more &amp; shot better on double the games while being the focal point of the defence  &amp; a much worse supporting cast  Paul Reed, Henry Ellenson, KPJ, Jordan Poole, Jared Harper, Ignas Brazdeikas, Rayjon Tucker, Kobi Simmons, Moses Brown, Mamade Diakate, Jeremiah Martin, Brodric Thomas, BJ Johnson, Reggie Perry, Nik Staukas and Nico Mannion all averaged more points than Green on either similar or better efficiency man. Green’s numbers were just OK."
"1) Roger Brown  Roger Brown is easily the best player to never play in the NBA, he’s an ABA legend who was a huge part of the Pacers dynasty. Mel Daniels would have been the right answer but he apparently played 11 games in the NBA at the end of his career.   2) Andre Miller   Sabonis was solid, but his best days weren’t in the NBA. Andre Miller led the league in assists but didn’t make the All-Star game.   5) Moses Malone/Julius Erving  Both of them are better than Dirk/KG  For 3-4-6-7-8-9-10, I agree with you"
"For two seasons, both of which only featured one bad contract..  I disagree that's there's evidence that he'd overpay 3-4 guys at the same time just for a couple firsts.  So simply, I disagree with your assessment of the strategy.  (P.S. we are not under it. That's why he signed guys like Moses Brown)"
"We literally traded Theis away to give TT/Robert more burn. I don't know how much better Horford is than TT but with his contract, he's gonna be forced into a role anyways. There's also Moses Brown to consider and I'm hopeful they'll actually try to develop him instead of dumping him like Wagner."
"What about... Moses Brown or Christian Wood? I've honestly never really even seen either play, but I took them for prop multi parters (Westbrook to have 10+ asts, Brown to have 9 rebs) a ton because I hate taking the stars because their numbers are so high. Those 2, Garland &amp; Sexton became 4 of my favorite players just from betting player props. But I'm not all that familiar with their actual games. I did notice when I was looking for a theoretical trade partner for CJ for a big or dicking around and trading Embiid instead of Simmons (yeah I know. Just seeing what kind of team I could put together with better value from embiid)... Brown and Wood were 2 of the main guys I kept coming back to"

"Those guys are locked in also what do you mean weird, I guess with the point guards and Hayward’s injury, and the Kemba walker trade for Moses brown and Horford. But they really haven’t touched the young guys,"
You make a good point. We could start him alongside Moses Brown and go undefeated.
"As a blazer fan I don’t like the idea if trading but if we had to I would want. Mpj and Murray and 2 1st for Dame and Nasir little and a 2nd.   Jaylen Brown, smart, moses brown, and 2 first. For dame and other filler players to make it possible  Kat and delo and 2nd for dame and roco.  Beal and 1st for dame  Dame and 1st for tatum."

"One Moses Brown, coming right up"
since they just got rid of horford and moses brown i bet it’s evan mobley
"I think it might be smarter to build around Simmons. The night of that horrific 4th quarter I responded to a few comments and Indy was one of the teams I thought could make this work... but the other way around. If you're trying to shake things up and it's clear this core isn't gonna work, then why not trade Embiid. At this time he should get you a much better return than Simmons, you trade Simmons now and you're probably only getting a player that might be in that tier of players that comes after All Stars/All NBA (like a Brogdon). Embiid is always gonna be 1 injury away from being a Cousins situation. You thought you had one of the best bigs in the game but his legs just aren't holding up into his late 20s-30s. If you can trade Embiid to a team for 2 players that are in the 70 cent range to Embiids dollar, then slide Simmons into a Star 2B slot, like a Bosh situation (Bosh was a far better player, I love Bosh I'm from WNY so was always a fan due to proximity to Tor. Not comparing him to Bosh, just the Mia situation) you'd have a deep, very good team for years. You can win with a team like that. My ""dream"" trade (I don't really care because I'm not a Phi fan) was with Indy, Sabonis &amp; Brogdon for Embiid. Look at the rest of their roster... that's not a bad outcome. Sabonis is still young, Brogdon can be a smaller scorer, still have Toby, still have the depth players. You don't have one of the handful of true nba superstars anymore after trading Embiid, but is Embiid+Brogdon+Toby really gonna win a championship? Embiid for a young big and a scorer that can slot into the 1 or 2. Simmons as your D/passing player. Moses Brown and someone would've worked. Christian Wood and someone could work. Miami *could* work with Bam and someone (Nunn? Idk) if Miami talks itself into trying to relive Jimmy Embiid again only with the Mia... appeal added into the situation.  I wouldn't be shocked if Phi actually tries to trade Embiid instead. Give Simmons a vote of confidence, take scoring pressure off him, spread your scoring around, give them depth, make them younger. I might be the better trade. But of course everyone is so quick to act like Simmons can't even play in the NBA anymore so I'll probably get shit on"
Patrick Beverly Moses Brown MVP race
"Yeah I picked Bey up off the waiver wire. It was awesome. I had so many good waiver wire plays. Being in a deep league is way more fun because you have to watch the 12th man on the bench and injuries more.  Bey, Diallo, Kaminsky had a good run for me, Cam Payne, Bismack had a few decent games, Moses Brown, Kenrich Williams, Saben Lee"
"I've watched Time Lord. He is coordinated. Maybe raw, but coordinated. Moses Brown is THE most uncoordinated player I've seen in watching the NBA for 30 years."
Moses Brown is a future hall of famer.   He averaged 8.9 rebs and 8.6 points on the Thunder. He only averaged 21 minutes.
Let me out my 2k hat on. Gimme capela at center (I thinks that 16mil. Moses brown as back up. Jonathan issac at PF (17 mil?) wand tj warren at sf (14 mil? ). Dinwiddie at pg at 11mil and christian wood could probably be pf and you can take warren out and move issac to sf. then a combination of lu dort and tj McConnell and shake Milton for the back court back ups I guess cause I know they have dirt cheap contracts but can contribute. Thats just off the top of my head while at work so I’m sure I’m missing a bunch of much better options haha.
I came back from camping a couple days after that and happened to look up Moses Brown. That's the path I took to finding out you can already trade players.
"Moses Brown should also sue for robbery. It's not even a rookie deal, but looks like one. Presti is a genius"
"If Moses Brown actually gets a look in Boston I’d think he could reach something like that, he did put up a near 20/20 game at the end of last season after maxing out at 16 prior to then and even less the year before."
"Whatchu all talking about? Kemba, a first and a second was already traded to the Thunder days ago for Horford, Moses Brown and a second round pick. You all talking about him getting traded from the thunder already?"
"Post-lotto mock draft. I'm pretty much going BPA in my opinion, with some subjective considerations, particularly whether I think the team is going for high potential or high floor, and in some cases where multiple players are about the same talent tier, best fit.  1 - Detroit - Cade Cunningham   2 - Houston - Evan Mobley   3 - Cleveland - Jalen Green   4 - Toronto - Jalen Suggs   5 - Orlando - Jon Kuminga   6 - Oklahoma City - Scottie Barnes   7 - Golden State - Moses Moody   8 - Orlando - James Bouknight   9 - Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  10 - New Orleans - Davion Mitchell   11 - Charlotte -  Franz Wagner   12 - San Antonio - Alperen Sengun   13 - Indiana - Josh Giddey   14 - Golden State - Corey Kispert   15 - Washington - Keon Johnson   16 - Oklahoma City - Usman Garuba   17 - Memphis - Ziaire Williams   18 - Oklahoma City - Kai Jones  19 - New York - Cam Thomas  20 - Atlanta - Isaiah Jackson   21 - New York - Sharife Cooper  22 - Los Angeles Lakers - Chris Duarte  23 - Houston - Trey Murphy  24 - Houston - Tre Mann  25 - Los Angeles Clippers - Jaden Springer  26 - Denver - Greg Brown  27 - Brooklyn - Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  28 - Philadelphia - Miles McBride  29 - Phoenix - Day'Ron Sharpe  30 - Ayo Dosunmu"
"Larry Hughes, Shaquille Harrisson, Stephen Jackson,  Charles Oakley, Moses Brown, Isaiah Thomas, Bill Walton, Nikola Vucevic, Bob Cousy, Scottie Barnes, Dennis Johnson, Reggie Jackson..."
"Man it would be a great deal for you, which is why I don’t think it happens. Just last week the “kemba’s value has plummeted” trade occurred. It took Kemba and a first to get horford and Moses brown. Even if Ben tanked his trade value this week, he’s still a 24 yr old DPOY runner up vs. Kemba 31 coming off a horrible season.   Gonna need a third team and a very different player coming back."
You think Moses Brown is better than Romeo and Nesmith?
"Good lawd, Smart, Tatum, Brown, Rob Will, Embiid? Sheesh; plus with Al/TT/Moses as bigs and their young bench that’s a pretty solid lineup. Won’t happen but still"
Moses Brown is probably going to be more impactful at least in the next couple years than whoever we would have drafted at 16 imo
Yup could get some depth like a Moses Brown even
"The major highlight of the trade was taking Al Horford for Kemba, but Celtics also “drafted” Moses Brown with the 16th pick"
"I watched Moses Brown all season. He was mostly a mess. He’s a good kid whose two talents are being tall and hustling. He has bricks for hands, no offensive skill, and terrible defensive IQ. The only reason he played heavy minutes was because OKC was tanking. I like the kid and wish him the best, but I can’t see him playing any rotation minutes on a good team (maybe if you need him to match up with someone like Boban, but that’s about it). I wouldn’t expect the Celtics to get much more out of Moses than they have out of Tacko."
If you actually watched Moses Brown playing you would say he's promising. He's basically poor man's Hassan Whiteside on a &gt;$2 million dollar deal locked up through 2024 who's only 21
If you actually watched Moses Brown playing you wouldn’t say he’s promising. He’s basically poor man’s Hassan Whiteside
"You're joking, right?  James Harden was there, Presti let him leave because they wouldn't take action on an extension with him until the last minute. He was traded for picks (that didn't pan out). Durant left because he's a snake bitch, but also because it's on Presti to have that caliber of players left (and that was back when Westbrook was winning MVP) and do nothing with them. No weapons, didn't make any big moves. Just a slow burn of stashing picks, drafting players that didn't help, and losing.  Spin it however you want it. At the end of the day, Presti had KD, Harden, and Westbrook back when Westbrook was actually good and he squandered it all. By 2016 he'd already torched most of it. It's really easy to get a bunch of draft picks when you have a championship team and send them all away. The Thunder should already have a ring in OKC. The Thunder should have multiple rings. KD never even would have left if Presti had put literally anyone else useful in the roster besides those two, and the cap space situation was also his fault. It's up there among the best teams to never win.  Hell, trading away Moses Brown for the 16th overall pick is statistically idiotic. If the Thunder don't draft three more MVPs (which they won't), Presti is going to be stuck holding the bag again trading everything for lottery tickets which he's already shown he cannot handle even if he does hit the jackpot.  Morey is ten times as capable as Presti. He actually built a team *this* close to beating GSW at their peak off front office moves. The Rockets were only one made three out of 27 straight misses away from going to the championship and beating down the ECC."
"I really don’t think Horford is washed. I was pleasantly surprised with how good he played with the Thunder. Great guy and really showed he can play still. If I had to pick a guy for a game tomorrow I’d choose Horford. If I had to pick a guy for the next couple years it’s Moses Brown. Also Horford helped Moses so much while he sat for the rest of the season. I’m happy for Celtics, Horford, and Brown!"
What are the chances they pick someone as good as Moses brown? I don't really understand this from OKC's side.
"I have a feeling the intent here is to save as much money as possible for the 2022 Free Agency class while filling out a decent bench rather than putting together a championship contender for next season.  Al Horford is a respected veteran that can really help out the young guys and Moses Brown is the type of player we've needed for years now. Moses is 21 signed to an extremely team-friendly contract until after the 2023/2024 season. Al Horford alone saves us a ton of money and makes it easier for us to re-sign Fournier long-term.  I know this might be a ""haha Boston fans think they'll get everyone"" moment, but I have a feeling Bradley Beal's gonna be a huge target next off-season for Boston unless someone else like Steph Curry wants to come here for some reason. Beal's a close friend of Tatum and has a lot of talent, which could be useful when it comes time for Tatum's next extension."
"The Cavs are great for player prop parlays. The online site I use has a section for them but call them ""accumulators"". You can add up to 10, one gets you a few bucks, 3 gets you maybe $5-10, 5 starts getting a bit more and 10 you can win like $800- 1600 on a dollar. Garland was one of my favorite players to add for pts and threes. The star players it gets kind of difficult, like Beal the lowest you might be able to take for a certain game is 24. And even 24 doesn't give you great odds, if you want those really tasty odds you gotta take like 28-32. Which is fucking hard! Lots of games at 24-26. So star players I'd do assists and rebs, those are more easily attainable. Threes as well. Then look for mid tier guys to take their points, someone like Garland at over 18 or 20 seems much better. RJ Barrett in the same range, those kind of guys. Garland and Sexton are so good for those, because they're not an unreasonable level. Jarrett Allen rebounds too. I liked Cleveland for those, someone's gotta score on the team, it's not like GS where Steph may score 46 which made everyone else score significantly less. Until Kevin fucking Love came back and threw a wrench into my low key favorite prop team. Those 3 were so reliable until his return. Moses Brown and Christian Wood too.  As a Cavs fan.. since you're obviously not winning a championship next season if you're looking for something to keep the games interesting, you have a really fun team to take for those kind of bets. And again, it's only a dollar, so you don't have to worry about spending crazy money (although obviously you can always bet more). If I had to guess, I'd say the start of next season might be a great time to take them, before those 3 all have solid numbers for a month and people realize. Kevin love should go away though, leave my guys alone so they can get their stats. Really disappointed with the Moses Brown trade too. I liked him on OKC where everybody could forget that he existed. Christian Wood better not go anywhere"
"Anyone watch Moses Brown this year?  21 and on a cheap contract with great per minute stats this year, but energy bigs can be incredibly deceiving in that regard.  Is he good?"
"it saves the celts about $20 mil for the 2022 stacked free agency class and is a 16th pick for promising young center Moses Brown swap. Not awful, we'll look back on this trade differently depending on 4 things:  1. What do the celts do at the PG spot 2. What do the celts do in next year's free agency with this money 3. Who do the Thunder grab at 16 overall 4. Who do the Thunder trade Kemba to (like cp3) and get  You right though, first glance it don't seem all that great for either"
"Good point here, but the contract is even less for Horford;  Kemba has $36m owed in 2022, and $37m in 2023. Total $73m in two years  Horford has $27m owed in 2022, and $26.5m in 2023, however that is only guaranteed for $14.5m. Total is $53.5m or $41.5m depending on team option.   The difference in salary for Boston is saving $19.5m or $31.5m over two years.   The other factor is Celtics gave up the 16th pick and got Moses Brown, with some future 2nd round picks getting swapped.   I don’t hate this trade for either team. I really like Kemba but his injures derailed a super promising start in Boston and Horford is a really good fit on this team. Kemba could actually be really solid alongside SGA and their other dudes. Just hope Horford and Kemba can stay healthy for their new teams."
Moses Brown
Moses Brown just became the answer to a trivia question.
"You know picks that late *very* rarely translate to anything more than a role player right? Moses Brown is a 7'2"" athletic big that plays with high energy and he's 21 years old, he absolutely has the potential to develop into that or more. He just averaged a double double on 24 minutes per game last season.  This isn't a particularly deep draft either."
"Yeah 100% our luck this will be that year. But I’ll take Moses brown, he’s really good, or at least has shown flashes of being solid."
Moses brown is decent
"I know fuck all about Moses Brown, so don't take this as commentary on this specific situation, but at some point, don't you have to start holding ""promising"" players? Otherwise hoarding draft picks is pointless.  If SGA and Dort are indeed ""irreplaceable"", how long do you continue tanking and fireselling for picks before starting to build?"
Can someone explain why the Celtics made this move? I know there's rumors of bad blood but this seems like the Celtics got robbed unless Moses Brown turns into Moses Malone
Moses Brown is better than anyone you could have drafted at 16?   Maybe right now... but this trade will likely look bad
bruh our last 2 #14 picks couldn't give us anywhere near that. if Moses Brown gives us that next season I'm like this is about as good as we could have drafted there  we're atrocious at drafting outside of the top 3 lol
Horford is owed like $25M &amp; $14M. Over $30M less over two years. Pick is for taking on the extra salary. Moses Brown isn’t half bad either tho
"I mean we’re certainly getting closer than Boston lol if you want to make it about talking shit. Kemba makes more money per year than Horford, so no, it was not about cap room. Kemba was always a small point guard who couldn’t defend, there was always a risk he would fall off quickly and sharply, for whatever reason.   I already acknowledged that it’s hindsight. But don’t act like this is some brilliant move for the Celtics. Call it whatever you want - you just gave up the 16th pick in the draft to dump the player that you signed instead of Al Horford… for Al Horford. If Moses Brown is enough to make you feel good about that then good for you."
"Haha I think Moses Brown was the crown jewel of this trade honestly, he’s gonna be a monster, OKC gonna regret letting go of him"
Moses Brown is a beast though so the Celtics won this
Trade guys for assets just to trade back for them in 3 years Celtics will trade Marcus Smart to OKC for Kemba  Walker and 4 1st round picks but I'm surprised OKC is giving up Moses Brown he's good what's SGA thinking about his team.
Horford has a partially guaranteed contract next season. That’s pretty handy and like I stated earlier. Moses Brown could be a useful piece. At the very least the Cs got someone who won’t be in street clothes most of the season
"We absolutely needed a better player in that trade than moses brown man…  I’d be fine with this trade if we actually got a player back, but he’s our fourth center in rotation, can’t defend and has no offensive game…"
"But we know what this draft is. We know its a very deep draft, so those metrics where “average 16th pick” doesn’t work because those include drafts that are top heavy. Look at the guys projected to fall to us, they are better than moses brown, and can actually fill positions of need and not just “a center”. He can’t defend, has brick hands, and has a very limited offensive game. You don’t take a undrafted guy over the 16th pick because he’s 7’2” and is a body. We should’ve gotten more for that pick. He’s gotta pan out"
I like Moses Brown in 2k so I get it
"The trade was all about dumping Kemba. Kemba is a complete liability and the team was going nowhere if he’s on a max contract. “Moses Brown just isn’t good” - did you watch Moses this past season? The Thunder had to start benching him in the second half because he was spoiling their tank. He’s not an all star, but on his super friendly contract for four years that’s a great asset for a team. He can absolutely provide quality 18 minutes a game down low on a good team.  If you think it’s a “big L” for talent to go from Kemba to Horford again I just don’t think you’ve watched Kemba play basketball since his knees started deteriorating. He’s a huge defensive liability and was horribly inefficient on offense. The team was stuck unless they could dump him. I couldn’t care less about pick 16, Celtics are overloaded with mid round young guys who need a chance to develop.  Personally I like the deal a lot for both teams, but the biggest W is the Celtics freeing up so much cap space and having financial flexibility. Otherwise their team was just going to have a ceiling of second round exits if Kemba ate up that much cap. I can’t help but feel that anyone who thinks this was a loss just hasn’t watched Kemba for two years, but to each their own, time will tell."
"Well, the Celtics lost a first round pick, for starters. Al Horford really isn’t too good, he may bring in veteran leadership but i don’t see him contributing a ton to the team winning games, Moses Brown just isn’t good, he’s over 7 foot and can’t finish. And then they just swapped 2nds. They traded Kemba for Al Horford, which you could call a win if you account for salary but player skill is a big L. Then they traded the number 16 pick for Moses Brown. Big L, the guy is seven foot and his touch around the rim is nonexistent. Then they traded a 25 second for a 23 second, which doesn’t really matter and is just kinda a meh, i guess it’ll depend on what team is worse what year."
NO NO NO NO. I LOVE MOSES BROWN
I'm not arguing good or bad but don't put a lot of hopes into Moses Brown being a 10/10 guy.
if you think Moses Brown is the Celtics future center... you're in for a treat.
Am I missing something or is this Moses brown guy a demon
Moses is 21 and a big body and a tiny contract. He basically was doing everything TT was doing on 1/5th the money and with a longer contract + has time to improve while TT is a finished product.   Maybe your ready to write off a 21 year old kid who has played 40 games but I’m not. We played Grant Williams at center and Taco fall playoff minutes… I’ll take Brown happily rn.
- I honestly haven't been that impressed by Fournier and not sure he's worth dedicating a bunch of cap space towards  - Tristan Thompson's time in Boston should be over if the C's now what's good for them  - Horford and Moses provide what the C's need more than anything- Center depth. Horford/Timelord/Brown/maybe Tacko on a 2-way again should be the rotation next season. Which again means TT should be on the way out.
The Al Horford and Tristan Thompson front court would have been excellent about 5 fucking years ago..  And they have Lob Billy and Moses Brown too. More trades are coming
Are you trying to say Moses Brown isn’t the next Dwight Howard?
"&gt; Jrue was a guy averaging 18/7 on 49% TS on a bad team. He was pretty good, but not a star. A team built around him was never winning a CHAMPIONSHIP which is the ultimate goal here.  But Nerlens Noel is? Even if he lived up the potential, he was never destined to be a franchise changing player. I don't think anyone would argue Jrue Holiday is going to be the best player on a championship team, but he is a very important piece and the point is they didn't have to trade him. They traded him because he made them too good. If a 22 year old makes you too good, you don't trade them.  &gt;And what good is a winning culture for one season if you tear it down the next?   Playoff experience. Players are playing meaningful games. It shows the team isn't just trying throwing these guys out there to lose games.  &gt;Is Shai happy that instead of fighting in the playoffs his team is pissing around in the lottery for the foreseeable future? And just traded their starting caliber center for a washed PG who probably won’t even play for them?   You're saying Kemba is washing but Horford is caliber center? Or Moses Brown? Because Moses Brown doesn't win you any games right now. Kemba makes them better now. I don't know if they hold onto him and Kemba certainly isn't the same player he was, but he makes the Thunder a better team now.   &gt;Other than 2001 the Sixers for the last 30 years either hung around the lottery or limped into the 8th seed just to get smacked by the Pistons or Lebron  But that's the problem. Lots of teams are destined for the forever the 8th seed but they get out of by getting better and making smart moves. In the past decade, Indiana, Toronto, Golden State, Utah, Denver, Miami, Milwaukee, Portland and others have had more or similar success than Philadelphia without becoming awful.   Did it work for Hinkie? Yeah, in a way it has because now they are a contending team. But if Embiid doesn't his foot and gets picked by Cleveland, where does that leave Philly? All the other teams built their teams outside the top picks. If Hinkie is this mastermind like everyone claims he is, he wouldn't have had to throw away 4 seasons to turn the team into a contender."
"Is Bill Simmons raving about the trade because of that? He's exactly the guy who only cares about how X player played against his team, so he probably thinks Moses Brown is the next Dwight Howard."
Why did OKC throw in Moses Brown as a salary dump?? Makes no sense
I liked Moses Brown 😭
"Moses Brown has some real outlier games where he put up monster numbers, but it’s way too early to say if he’s going to be anything or not. Certainly has the size.   Getting a look is probably the right way to put it.   Brown and Williams were probably the two most frustrating fantasy centers in the second half of the season so it is kind of hilarious they’re on the same team now."
"&gt;Celtics free up 9M in salary(roughly) to bring in a FA.  Ehh more about saving ownership a buck than anything else. Celtics only play is still resigning Fournier and using whatever exceptions we can manage; nothing changes on that front. And short of someone like Beal demanding to play in Boston we'd still need a ton to go our way to be players in 22-23's free agency/ offseason.  &gt;I don’t know if Horford is a true starter at this point in his career, but he will definitely be productive in Boston.  The problem here is our Center rotation is back to being bloated af with Robert Williams, Tristan Thompson, Al Horford, and Moses Brown all in play. Until we make another move we've effectively taken a step back in that regard."
"Celtics are set at center now, which they were undermanned at before. Robert Williams/Al Horford/Moses Brown is a really good rotation  I wonder if this is a sign that Brad has faith in Marcus Smart as the starting PG, or if more is to come"
"Unless Moses Brown becomes a superstar somehow, that is a terrible deal. You're trading an all star who is still really good, plus a first rounder, for a former all star who is gonna retire any day now because he stopped being good years ago."
"You did watch Moses Brown play last season, right?"
"Our positive value in return is the salary difference between contracts and Moses Brown. Not some crazy haul, but definitely more valuable to the Cs than pick 16."
"It was. I’d never heard of him until I was watching that game, crying, wondering “who the fuck is Moses Brown??? This guys sounds like a made up 2K player!!!”  Hilariously, I think because of that game, Celtics fans are probably his most ardent defenders because we got fucking torched, we’re the franchise that would value him the most lol (that isn’t OKC)"
Brad Stevens saw Moses brown get 20 rebounds and didn't need to see anything else
Lol you got picks. We got A TPE and Moses Brown
"Didn't know anything about Moses Brown but I see the dude averaged almost 9 rebounds a game in a little over 21 minutes. How's his defense? I'm assuming perimeter defense is weak. As young as he is, seems he's worth the risk for that 16th pick, though his skillset seems pretty similar to RWIII."
"Kemba is not good lmao. On their contracts, horford &gt;&gt; kemba. 16th pick is nice but that’s usually more missed than hit. And they gave up Moses brown who isn’t anything amazing but could maybe develop into a role player."
That Moses Brown and Cole Anthony Archbishop Molloy team was sick
"I get they wanted to get rid of Kemba.. but I don't see how they did really anything to benefit the team.. Al Horford is on his last legs, Who the hell is Moses Brown, and 2nd round picks are almost meaningless. They better hope they can get a big time free agent or they are going to lose a whole lot of games next year."
Moses Brown low key a pickup
"Sure, Moses Brown is all yours"
In no world is moses brown better than a 16th pick in this draft  I’ll have what yall are smoking
"Saves ~10mil. Kemba scores a higher total but Al is slightly more efficient, can 3&amp;D. Celtics had a huge hole to fill after dumping Theis. Also got Moses Brown of the deal who is already about as good as it gets if you were to draft at 16th overall anyway. Rebounding has been a huge issue for the celtics that we've been trying to fix (kanter, tristan)"
"how do celtics fans feel about this? it seems pretty bleak, are they doing it to ship those two off for someone else? i don't see al horford and moses brown pushing the needle..."
oh my god shut up. Moses Brown is trash.
Ucla legend Moses brown
moses brown the best thing here for the celtics too
"On his contract? Yes. Boston was always going to move him at a loss in terms of the on paper trade, if they were able to move him at all. But you're going -9 million in cap commitments and -1 year on your big contract, which is fantastic. Expiring a year earlier is huge, and who knows - best case scenario, he's an expiring contract starting next offseason. Maybe a contender or a team with space will be looking for him.  Horford is also not fully guaranteed in his last year.  And then, basically, you have a first round pick for Moses Brown. This year, you're hoping your middle first round pick becomes Moses Brown..  Any other trade would have forced Boston to give up even more assets to offload Kemba. This is exactly what Boston wanted."

Did Brad Stevens really trade for Moses Brown because he dropped 20 20 against him this year? The new Doc Rivers
"I kind of expect it, but wouldn't be shocked if they don't.  May actually make sense to wait until after the season starts.    Timelord still has to prove he can handle 30 minutes every night and stay healthy, Horford is a very different type of center, and Moses Brown is a young project type.  Let's say you trade TT, and then Timelord has same health issues as this past season and Moses struggles.  You just can't have 35 year old Al Horford being your only reliable big.   Real question is what you do with TT's salary.  If there's not a great option, he probably has more value on the roster."

"First of all, Rob williams &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Moses Brown. You say ‘an ageing josh richardson’ like he is 35, he is 27, he’s going into his prime. Josh richardson&gt;moses brown, i shouldn’t have to say that. Rob Williams is great when healthy, and if he stays healthy, he will probably end up out playing this contract. He had 9 blocks against the best team in the league in the playoffs on one leg. He was 7th in blocks per game, despite playing 18 mpg. That 18 mpg was mainly due to not being healthy. Therefore, if he can stay healthy, its a good contract no doubt."
"I don’t get why they would trade for Moses Brown, who seems like an as good if not better player than Williams and trade him for an aging Josh Richardson, then give Williams basically the contract Richaun Holmes got"
"If we were doing a full on tank/fire sale, we'd have bought out Dragic already. But he'll be a good guard off the bench, maybe even in closing lineups. I think we'll eventually send him to Dallas. Wouldn't be surprised if we make do with Powell and Moses Brown."
Was standing next to Moses Brown during a fan appreciation event when he was a rookie with the Blazers. That guy is TALL.
Yeah it looks like he might’ve played his way off the team. Especially if the Moses Brown + Powell for Dragic reports carry any validity.
Dragic for Powell and Moses Brown is pretty much done. They just have to wait 6 weeks to do it.
"Lol...not sure what this post is  Contracts have to match and Raptors want a someone useful or upside in return  I don't think they are wait on Moses Brown, just haven't been offered something they like yet  There is no hurry for the Raptors. Some point guard will be hurt when the season starts"
 &gt;Raptors do not need another big in Moses Brown. Y'all have enough bigs on your team. What are y'all goin to do with yet another one?  u clearly have no idea of the plan masai has to sign every 6'9 player in the league
"Sometimes yes, sometimes no.  It doesn't always take much, it completely depends on who you're going after and how much that team wants them.  Also keep in mind you have a year to use the TPE, so it doesn't need to be some kind of trade deadline splurge.    So, for example, the Celtics just traded Moses Brown for Josh Richardson using the TPE.  Moses Brown was a throw-in on the Horford deal and a guy the Celtics really had no place for anyways.  Bottom line is it's a good thing to have, because you never know what may open up.  And you don't have to use it."
"If he's waivered, I wouldn't mind us giving a look at him. He showed more tools than Moses Brown on SL so far. WCS will be gone next year, Powell is being offered like a bag of chips and Boban probably will either retire or go back to Europe in 2023."
We only want Moses brown
&gt;Got blocked five times by Moses Brown in the last game of the season  That's quite impressive
"Elite tank commander though. Got blocked five times by Moses Brown in the last game of the season, just as Lue wanted. Takes a special talent!  Don’t think Grizz want his services, but another team might at the deadline."
SGA been on it. Check Moses brown last year too bb. Y'all just playing catch up 😈
Moses Brown is going to surprise some people
"I needed rebounds, blocks and high FG%, and he seemed to fit the bill with Raptors benching everyone else and giving Freddie 30 mins+  But he ended up being worse than Moses Brown at stats padding."
He’s gonna get cut as soon as the Raps can trade for Moses Brown.
"We already had Moses Brown, but I guess we can bring him back alongside Doncic."
Ur getting ej onu Tyrell Terry and Moses brown  Plz watch the mixtape btw
"Moses Brown is also the sole reason the Clips played the Jazz second round instead of the Suns, so I’m a fan of him"
"One of the bigs would probably have to get waived or sent to a 3rd team. Raptors would go from no center depth to too many that all kind of fit the same way with Birch and Powell as the two vets, Boucher in their too situationally, and then too many development pieces Precious, Brown, Gillespie as you said. Just too many guys doing the same role. We need 2 vets and one development guy. And idk what Freddie Gillespie’s contract is like but he could be a two-way contract guy. That leaves out Brown  They need to commit to like one guy as a development piece and I’d rather that be Precious.   Much rather have two 2nd rounders than Moses cuh."
"Are you insane? You'd rather have Moses Brown than Dragic? Brown is all hype, he is not a good player"
"Which is why, for me, it makes no sense that Toronto rather take in Moses Brown as a development project instead of WCS, a low-end starter."
Scottie Barnes-OG-Siakam-Boucher-Moses Brown lineup? Lol
"fwiw, in Portland, Moses Brown was the worst player I've seen, worse than Giorgio Pappagiannis. His first act was to absolutely shit the bed on an inbound pass. At 40 years old and well under 6' tall, I'm extremely confident I could have made a better first outing than his first 5 games while playing Center. I may have died, but it would have been a tighter performance.  Then he got way better for the remainder of the season, and over the past year in OKC, he's vastly improved his per 36.  Am I saying he's good? lol well no. I am saying, he seems capable of sudden improvements. Lord knows he's got room for improvement, but he's also proven he can do that."
Yesterday I argued with a Raptors fan who said they'd rather have Moses Brown than Brunson. Oof.
"I don't think the Raptors even want Brunson. Not that he's not good, but we are set with guards anyway.   Raptors would probably ask for 2nd rounders and or Moses Brown."
"We'd add powell(who i don't mind as veteran presence) and Moses brown to a c lineup of khem birch, precious, and freddie g 😬😬 idk about this"
~~Thunder~~ ~~Celtics~~ ~~Mavs~~ Raptors legend Moses Brown
How tall is Moses Brown.. 6'9?
I'd take Moses Brown.
This would be like the third time moses brown has been traded this offseason
"Brad Stevens is a terrible gm. Much better as a coach. Trading a lot for moses brown (fine) then trading him, a promising center on a cheap deal who was putting up rebounding numbers we haven’t seen since shaq, for an aging Josh Richardson is absolutely insane. He’s neither rebuilding nor surrounding his stars with good pieces, which makes zero sense."
"As a Dallas fan I hope Lauri doesn’t stay with you and comes to us. Our potential bench unit squad would be: Dragic (i have a good feeling that he’s coming), Brunson, Sterling Brown, Markkanen, Kleber.  3 guys which could easily score 15+ points, plus Brown and Kleber as elite 3 point shooters/decent defenders. We also got Moses Brown in the Richardson trade (maybe he could also become a solid bench unit option)."
Moses Brown
"Yeah but there's a difference between us fans saying ""I hope he gets traded for Moses Brown"" (which, yeah you can find that to be a bit crass) and a professional player who's been in the league for as long as he has saying ""I don't wanna be here"" as if he doesn't know trades are part of the business."
"If I were a Mavs fan, I wouldn't chill out after the only highlights of this offseason was acquiring Moses Brown via trade and re-signing Tim Hardaway Jr."
"I think you would have to factor in that a Horford buyout would also probably be less than the full amount. Maybe around 5M?   So 17M, Moses Brown, Danny Green for 2 1sts and a 2nd. Still a good deal though."
"Boban, Moses Brown, Dwight Powell and Nate Hilton"
"&gt;  So they destroyed their cap space for two years for picks they may not even convey all while losing both Al Horford/Kemba and Moses Brown.  This may be the most delusional Celtics fanboy thing I've read on this subreddit lmao. Nice job miscontruding the situation to make yourself feel better about the Kemba trade. You know, both parties *are* allowed to be happy here, right?"
Which they traded for two heavily protected Houston firsts. So they destroyed their cap space for two years for picks they may not even convey all while losing both Al Horford/Kemba and Moses Brown.
"1)  Gafford sucks.  You could put a broomstick in there with Westbrook, and if it can catch lobs at a respectable clip, Russ will make said broomstick look like Moses Malone.  Chicago moved him for Troy Brown Jr, who has considerably higher upside &amp; is a much more adequate fit for the contemporary NBA, on both sides of the ball  2) Chicago's defense will be fine.  It wasn't that bad last yr, and they shored up their perimeter D big time over the off-season.  Their overall D won't be stellar or anything, but it won't be terrible either.   Maybe actually go look up the stats/evidence before commenting?  The Bulls biggest weaknesses last season by far were ball distribution, turnovers, &amp; free throw attempts.  Both issues have been addressed &amp; subsequently remedied  They've also acquired Tony Bradley, who is a young, serviceable big body down low, and have a 21 yr old 7-footer from Montenegro, Marko Simonovic, that they've recently brought on board, who was their second rd draft pick last yr &amp; is already at the advocate centre practicing with Billy D &amp; their 2nd rd pick from this yr, Ayo Dosunmu, who also looks to be a solid NBA perimeter defender"
"People talking about Preston being this super star need to consider this; - Traded Horford, Moses Brown, and a 2nd for Kemba, the 16th pick, and a different 2nd - Bought out Kemba, eating this cost and adding multiple millions in dead cap to the roster (did not sell Kemba for positive assets like people were hoping/speculating) - then traded the 16th pick (Sengun) for two future lottery-protected picks.   Whilst this is all not egregious, it is a lot of fucking around for not much in return. After all that they end with two lottery-protected picks and spending millions (tbd on actual cost)  to get rid of him. Also lost Brown who is now on the Mavs roster who has a long cheap contract.   This of course is just one big transaction, so we’ll see how this plays out but maybe let’s hold off crowning Presto the best GM ever until these picks shake out."
powell? WCS? Moses Brown? best I can do
"I agree with you on both points that you wrote. Depth is key-I think we have couple of guys on the team that just take the roster spot without any real value-Marjanovic, Burke, Josh Green, Tyler Terry and Moses Brown. Yes 3 of them are young players, but we also have to be realistic-I don’t see them getting much opportunity. And secondly-we need much more a back-up PG than another PF."
"Give us Moses Brown, Mavs"
207 was the best version of Westbrook. It was tough for him to follow in the footsteps of Moses Brown.
If rather have Moses Brown
"We develop players probably better than average. Dame and CJ are both homegrown. Gary Trent, Nic Batum, Pat Connaughton, Will Barton, Ed Davis, Moses Brown etc al. Lots of guys got their starts here."
how dare you insult thunder legend moses brown like that
"very controversial, but mario hezonja over moses brown all time. ready for the downvotes"
"He is the smallest and ‘shortest’ 7 footer I have seen. Small because he is so damn skinny, and short because his head is so fucking long that he gets to 7+ feet but his shoulders are way lower than other 7 footers. He is like the reverse of Robert Williams who barely has a neck so he is listed as shorter than he plays.  Seeing Poku next to Moses Brown made Poku seem so tiny."
"You re-signed 2 guys. Didn’t draft anyone, and traded J. Rich for Moses Brown, so you could create extra cap space that you guys have yet to use. The Lakers lost in the first round and improved there whole roster. It’s looking like you’re still a first round exit. West isn’t getting any easier"
Sure trade us Moses Brown.
"There's a reason Presti goes out of his way to take care of players that come through OKC.  Straight up, show me an interview where any player criticizes OKC. They, every single time, talk about how professional and welcoming the organization is.  Presti and the front office are completely aware that Oklahoma City is not a big destination for players, so they put the effort in to take care of our guys. Whenever we make a trade, we send players where they wanted to go. PG chose LA, Russ wanted to join Harden in Houston, CP3 liked the idea of being the floor general for the Suns, Horford wanted to go back to Boston, hell even Kemba ""never played a game for the Thunder"" Walker worked with us so he could go to the Knicks.  On top of that, word is that the young guns that have been going through OKC during our tank have all been positive about it. Why not? OKC is giving them opportunities to play that they wouldn't have gotten elsewhere, and now they've got a foot in the door in the league. Ask Moses Brown how it felt to get real playing time in OKC, and now he's got a guaranteed contract and likely playing time for the Celtics."
We need to send about $14.5 million to salary match Dragic. We would also have to send Willie Cauley-Stein's expiring or Burke's 2 years $6 million and Moses Brown.
Raptors:  Center please.  Maybe they're waiting to finalize the deal so they can scoop up Moses Brown for Dragic?
If having 4 centers protects Timelord then I’m very happy.   Would have been 5 but for some reason the Boston Celtics did not want to confuse Moses Brown with [Moses Brown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Brown)
Pure unadulterated cap. Raptors didn't trade siakam for Paul George and sources say we would move og and siakam for Moses Brown?? 🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢
I don’t think Moses Brown can be included in this trade.
"That’s why I thought the reaction to losing Moses Brown was hilarious. There’s not exactly a dearth of slow footed, rebounding bigs out there."
"Perhpas he meant Powell and a prospect*ive* Mavs package, like Powell, WCS, and a 2nd, Powell, Burke, and Moses Brown, etc.  Our only prospects are Green, Terry, and Moses Brown, but we'd never include Green or Terry for Dragic and Moses Brown doesn't have much value."
Looked better than Moses Brown last season
There have been sources within the Mavs that view Moses Brown as a positive asset and say the Raptors are going to trade OG and Siakam for him.
This. Possibly with the addition of Moses Brown. No way we’re trading Josh Green for a 35yr old Goran Dragic.
"You should have gotten him. Mavs now have both Sterling and Moses Brown, while Nuggets have both JMyke and Jeff Green. Confusing last names are all the rage in the Western Conference this year!"
Clint is a defensive monster. Moses brown is terrible at defense lol
"Moses Brown is not very good, I would much rather trade Powell + Burke + Brown than WCS, who was our best defensive big last year."
"Yeah maybe that is the issue. I mean I have really liked Powell over the years and it would be fitting to send him back to his home town of Toronto. I wouldn't mind giving him up because we still have players like Kleber(who is more of a PF), Boban, KP, and just got Moses Brown from OKC. So it wouldn't be the worst case to happen.  It's either the Mavericks just love the guy or Toronto doesn't want him. Or maybe they are just trying to work out the money side of it who knows.   But you are right about Dragic still having something in the tank. The Mavericks do need a secondary ball handler like that. I just can't imagine them wanting to trade Josh Green(who they just drafted last season) and even more so Brunson. I am super ultra high on Brunson and would honestly rather keep him then get Dragic if that makes sense. But again who knows what the front offices are figuring out right now."
Yall got Moses Brown right?
I like Moses Brown. Dude could be Luka's Clint Capela.
Who exactly is Moses Brown again
"Dragic for dwight powell, i guess we save some money. I’d ask for something like two seconds with that too tho or moses brown he’s definitely intriguing."
"Moses Brown is the perfect example of most of the people here just reading box scores and not actually watching basketball, everybody just looks at his 20/20 game or his game with 8 blocks and thinks he some underrated young talent but the dude is an atrocious defender and is easily run off the floor."
"We can't not have Willie. Then our C depth is what, Moses Brown behind a KP redemption arc? Not gunna happen. He had flashes of being passable last year, but dragic is not worth 20 mil anyway. I would love him off the bench 20 min a game, but not unless Toronto buys him out. Maybe we work something out with Toronto but I don't see why Toronto wants our castoffs."
Sounds like Dragic may be to Dallas for Powel  but I would prefer Moses Brown for Achiuwa  and Dragic for Cameron Payne
GIVE ME MOSES BROWN
This dude prolly thinks Moses Brown is a future 100M player
"It wouldn’t necessarily be into cap space. We can send out Powell, Burke, and Moses Brown to match Dragic’s salary. So we could resign Tim, sign someone else for the remaining amount, use the MLE, and then do this trade in addition."
Any Mavs fan that's been through a pre Luka FA knew this was destiny from the start. We got Moses Brown though!
So we give up 2 of our 4 centers (the other 2 being Boban who only plays situationally and Moses Brown who is a young unproven throw in we didn't want from Boston) for an old past his prime PG who eats up 20 million of our cap and comes off the books the year Luka's extension kicks in and effectively makes that cap space disappear. Nah I think I'm fucking good
"Let me introduce you to a man called John Y. Brown Jr. An owner for the Kentucky Colonels from 1973-76, the Buffalo Braves (future LA Clippers) from 1976-1978, and then Boston Celtics owner from 1978-1979 who ran the front offices of each team, instead of hiring and listening to an actual GM.  --------------------------------------------  **Colonels**   * Traded superstar hometown hero Dan Issel the year after they won the ABA Championship for cash.   * Replaced the entire Board of Directors with his wife and 10 of her friends, leading to the GM and coach to resign.  * Refused to pay $3,000,000 to join the NBA.   ----------------------------------  **Braves**  * Bought 50% of the team months after refusing to pay the $3,000,000 fee for the Colonels to join.  * The previous owner of the Buffalo Braves had a handshake deal in place to sell the team for $6,100,000 to hotel owner Irving Cowan, who would then move the team to Miami. The city of Buffalo filed a $10,000,000 damage lawsuit against the team to block the move, which led to the sale eventually falling through. Because of this, the Braves would then sign a 15-year lease for the arena they played in, with a provision that the lease would be voided if the team did not sell more than 5,000 season tickets in any given season.  * John Y. Brown Jr knew of this provision, and knew he could sell the team for a profit if the lease was voided. He intended to tank the Buffalo Braves to the point they were beyond awful, so that less than 5,000 season tickets would be sold and they'd be out of their lease on the arena.  * NBA HOF Coach Jack Ramsay resigned after he caught wind of the above mentioned scheme, and went to the Blazers where they won the championship the next season.   * Traded rookie Adrian Dantley for 25 games of Billy Knight.  * Traded Bob McAdoo for cash and a career bench player.   * Traded a 1st for Moses Malone, and then 6 days later traded him to Houston.   * After getting bored and wanting to sell the team, he literally traded ownership with the then-Boston Celtics owner, so he was know the owner of the Celtics.  -----------------------------  **Celtics**  * Two weeks before the sale/swap of franchise ownerships became official, he traded as the GM of the Buffalo Braves **to** the Boston Celtics, acting as GM for both teams.   * He did the trade without even consulting or talking to Red Auerbach.  * Not wanting to strain the relationship further, he decided to trade three 1sts for Bob McAdoo, who would play a total of 20 games for the Celtics.  * He also did this trade without consulting or talking to Red Auerbach.  * Poisoned the relationship so badly with Red Auerbach that he almost took a job with the Knicks until the other Celtics owner forced him out and bought out his shares."
I think the Celtics might keep Kornet if Moses Brown is leaving. Need some kind of depth behind Timelord and Al
"&gt;Honorable mentions to Young, KAT and Brown     Damn you really that high on Moses Brown!"
"Mavs will counter with    Boban Marjanović, Kristaps Porziņģis, Willie Cauley-Stein, Moses Brown, Dwight Powell"
We just traded for Moses Brown a 7 footer who averages 8 and 8.
That's still too many bigs. You guys need to trade a couple of those guys. I'd call the Rockets to see if they would swap Danuel House for Moses Brown
Moses Brown burner account I assume?
We are. But idk much about Moses Brown. I don’t follow Celtics’ basketball closely.
"So we have KP, WCS, Moses Brown and Boban as centers? Odd but ok"
Moses brown &gt; WCS 😑
Moses Brown is garbage
Moses Brown truthers have to wait a little longer.
I’m a Mavs fan and Moses Brown didn’t move the needle for me.
Moses brown isn’t promising and Robert Williams is very good
Think you're overrating Moses Brown. He has good energy but there are busloads of similar guys running around the G League if you're desperate for a high energy big with a limited skillset.  He wouldn't ever see the floor behind Horford/Williams. Richardson will help them this year more than Brown would.
Moses Brown sucks wtf are you talking about
We have enough to offer the max after the Moses Brown trade.
Isn't this the guy who said  Celtics weren't sending anything in the Richardsom trade right before they sent Moses Brown? Why are his tweets still allowed?
Man Moses Brown dropped multiple 20/20 games and now he’s getting passed around like a blunt after his rookie year. Wtf man
"There's much worse starting centres than Birch, like Looney, Moses Brown etc"
Birch ended strong. Some worse 5s like looney out there or moses brown if he started.
Moses Brown is expected to average 13.5ppg 11rpg 2.1bpg playing 31mpg next season so he can be a candidate for MIP.
Moses brown “defensive specialist” has some of the worst defensive footwork in the league
"Reggie Bullock, Sterling Brown and Moses Brown were all good signings, and Ntilikina could pan out with the right guidance too. Mavs had an under the radar offseason but really improved their depth and outside shooting."
"Some comments:  * DFS will only play at the 4 in small-ball packages. He will split time at the 3 with THJ and Bullock, probably pending on the matchup;  * I'm fairly sure Sterling Brown is ahead of Green in the chart. To be honest, the Ntilikina sign makes me wonder if we are not prepping a Green trade. He will take Burke's spot in the roster, but his role is basically Green's, except that he already polished his defense;  * Moses is the last C on the depth. WCS should be the usual KP backup, with Powell finding the court (if he's not traded) whenever the opponent fields a smaller 5. Boban will probably play selected matchups, against Embiid and other physical 5. Moses will be a victory cigar at best  In general you are right, our team will be heavily matchup based, or at least it should. We acquired a plethora of versatile and switchable defenders, but we have no idea if Kidd have become a smart cookie.  Our usual lineup will probably be Luka/Bullock/THJ/Maxi/KP, with Brunson/Green-Terry-Ntilikina/DFS/Sterling/WCS, but you will find THJ in the 2nd unit whenever we need firepower (considering we will force Brunson into a point role), or DFS with Bullock against high octane offenses, like the Nets."
Indeed. My projected lineup for them is something like  Luka/ Brunson  THJ/ Frank Bullock/ josh green  DFS/ kleber  KP/ Moses brown
Sterling Brown on the Mavs. He's was a very cheap (3 mil per year) and under the radar move that might make a push for more minutes. Same with Moses Brown
"Technically it could. KP and Powell mount to almost the same of Wall's salary, and the 125% rule would allow us to sign him and keep our TPE. Wall would solve the Luka spell issue and could potentially start alongside him at the 2 in playoff clutch time. Problem is, this would increase the black hole that is our C depth. We would be starting either Moses Brown or WCS, and neither would be less than a gigantic liability on both phases of the game.   So yeah, probably we are not in that front."
Nah we need a moses brown type c
"Same with dudes like Rick Barry, Moses Malone, Artis Gilmore, and the players who never played in the league like Roger Brown or Mel Daniels. David Thompson played 83 games in his rookie year in the ABA and put up 26 PPG, then came into the NBA and put up basically the exact same numbers. The two leagues were pretty much level in quality in the 1970s imo, but the ABA gets totally ignored despite being arguably more influential to today's game than the NBA of the era was."
"I swear we haven’t had a Moses in the league since Moses Malone and now we about to have 3 Moses of Brown, Moody and Wright"
Or the Raptors are waiting until  Moses Brown is able to be traded again
"PG - Luka SG - THJ SF - Reggie Bullock PF - DFS C- KP  Bench:  Guards: Jalen Brunson, Trey Burke  Wings: Sterling Brown, Josh Green  Bigs: Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell, Boban, Moses Brown"
"That's what ticked many of us off last season, easy to blame Melo and Kanter but hey, at least they were on the fucking court lol. Wasting roster spots on Jaylen Hoard, Moses Brown [before the breakout] Klejin Blevins, TJ Leaf knowing full well how injury prone our guys were was genuine muppetry. That's what had them gassed by the time the playoffs rolled around in my opinion."
"Mavs hold up could be that Moses brown can't be traded until October, and Toronto wants him in the trade. Package would be brown, Powell for dragic"
Not too much of an issue but Moses Brown came from Boston to Dallas not from OKC technically
"Intangibles. Cliche as it may sound, they're nothing alike despite their games being perceived as similar.   Like saying Gobert, McGee, and Moses Brown are interchangeable because they block shots, dunk, and miss fts."
"The Book of FURK  1 IN the beginning, there was FURK and he was BAD. He misseth the 3 and the bunny alike, he playeth the defense not. For his body was slender like the willow wand. Thus bullied he was about the court as a leaf is bullied by the wind. His butt was thus gluethed to the bench and there was much rejoicing.  2 IN Year the SECOND, FURK was still BAD. He misseth the 3 and the bunny alike. The defense he playeth not. His butt remainethed glued to the bench and there was much rejoicing. YET there were flashes of goodness. When he hit the 3, his form looketh GOOD. Behind his back did he dribble and maketh he the layup. Yet he playeth the defense not, for slender as the willow wand was he still, and his butt to the bench remaineth glued.  3 AND YEA, FURK spake saying ""Tradeth me, because minutes here I get not!"" But he was still BAD. Laughter ensued. And the fans did grin, and the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats. And his butt to the bench remaineth glued. And there was much rejoicing; for still he misseth the 3 and defense he played not.  4 YET minutes he began to get. Because BROWN stanketh of desperation and in those minutes there were FLASHES. And in the 3, his form looketh good upon occasion and behind his back he did dribble and maketh the layup. And the people did wonder.  5 BUT still he was BAD and BRAND releaseth him, saying ""We needeth your shit not, go thou to free agency!"" And there was much rejoicing. Yet BRAND also stanketh of desperation, and re-signethed him to a 2 year deal and there was much wailing and gnashing of big, pointy teeth. For the fans beleived that Furk was still BAD and despaired.  6 IN Year the THIRD, minutes again he did get, and his 3 form looketh good and behind his back he did dribble. And YEA, BROWN spaketh thus: ""Groweth thou a bombah!"" And the 3 he did hit. And the charge he did take. And he began to play defense. For FURK had worked out; no longer slender as the willow wand was he. And he sidesteppeth before the 3 and it was good. Baby steps took he, yet they added up. And to the bench his butt was glued no longer. Minutes he playeth, yet clutch he was not and he slumpeth, and in the playoffs was NOT GOOD.  7 IN Year the FOURTH. He maketh the 3 and behind he back he did dribble and he taketh the charge and sidesteppeth before the 3 and YEA he draweth the 3 point foul. Baby steps took he, yet steps they were. And there was confusion among the fans. WAS FURK bad or was FURK good? Sayeth the many: trade bait was he. For slumpeth still did he, yet traded he was not and remaineth he a SIXER.  8 THEN the Angel THYBULLE covered FURK with his wings and spake to him thus: ""Stealeth thou the ball, for it is always YOURS and the unbelievers must have it not!"" And FURK hearkened to his words and stole the ball from the unbelievers. And it was GOOD; for at last he playeth the defense. And also he sidesteppeth before the 3, which he maketh, and behind his back he did dribble and the floaters and layups he did make, and he taketh the the charge, and draweth the 3 point foul, and many POINTZZ he did also score.  9 THUS the baby steps did add up to a leap and it was GOOD. And there was much rejoicing. Yet now did the fans question the CONTRACT, saying ""We need FURK!"" and the thought of FURK departing into free agency filled the fans with sorrow.  10 YET FURK is still a SIXER and starting minutes may he get, and POINTZZ he may score and STOCKS he may get and in the PLAYOFFS may be valuable. For he was GOOD and slumpeth no longer and the fans rejoiceth. And forward looked the fans to the SIXERS marching down the STREET of BROAD covered in accolades and glory, bearing the TROPHY of LARRY O’BRIEN.  11 AND the LORD spake to the SIXERS, saying ""in the PLAYOFFS scoreth thou the holy POINTZZ, and playeth thou the defense drawing FOULS and getting STOCKS, and winneth thou the games. And the number of the games thou shalt winneth shall be FOUR times THREE. And it shall be spoken thusly; ""FO FO FO!"" in the manner of the ARCHANGEL MOSES. Three shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three then FO. Five is right out. Once the number FO, being the fourth number, be reached, then, thou winneth the series, thy foes, who, being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it.’  Thus endeth the BOOK of FURK."
"Except if we are set on Moses Brown like some reports say we are, we literally can't make a trade until October 1st. Or if we want to add other salaries onto Dragic in a trade we can't trade him until October 5th."
I coulda sworn it was Moses Brown.
Yeah he's fucking goated in that game. He and Moses brown on a team together make for automatic 50 point blow outs in the games I actually play. Just block the shot and dunk on the other end.  Moses averages like 8-8-2-1-1 as the backup center for me during sims.
Chris Paul  Paul George  Patrick Williams  Anthony Davis  Moses Brown (can't think of a center)
"no roster improvements? we signed guys that can actually hit 3s, Moses Brown is cool, we still have KP, and luka will luka thats good enough for a 4th or 5th seed in my eyes"
Jaylen Brown? Moses Brown?
"Why is Tim Hardaway Jr in that photo in the OP, like he's a new signing? I know he just signed an extension with the Mavs, but he's already been there for 2 1/2 seasons, and isn't a newcomer like Sterling Brown, Moses Brown, and Reggie Bullock."
"Clippers are better than the Knicks, sure.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Utah is better then the Heat  I ruled it as a tie, and I disagree. But, even if we roll with this, the result still doesn't change.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Mavs won both games against the Celtics last season, so no the east isn't better  The Mavericks won by 3 and 5 points respectively.  The Mavericks one key weakness was ballhandling to back up Luka. It's why they lost, Luka got gassed. They didn't fix it. They also replaced Carlisle with JASON KIDD. They did add Bullock and Sterling Brown and.... Moses Brown.  Celtics got versatile Al Horford who backs up the injury prone Williams, Bruno Fernando, Enes Kanter, Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, and most notably, Dennis Schroeder.  I'm takin the C's on this one. So, no, you're wrong."
I like the idea of Moses Brown evolving into 3 different pokemons  JaVale McGee (offense form)  Rudy Gobert (defense form)  DeAndre Jordan (rebound form)
Moses brown and javale McGee are pretty comparable tbf
"Moses Brown, JaVale McGee, Rudy Gobert"
"That statistic is a little bit skewed by using a fairly accurate statistical estimation of the total number of people who are 7'+ but taking player's listed height at face value.     For example, while Nikola Vucevic is listed at 7'0"", he actually measure a touch over 6'10"". If you go by reasonably accurate draft combine measurements, the number of actual 7'+ NBA players plummets (Gobert, Porzingis, Poetl, Bol, Fall, and Moses Brown seem to be it) to 1.4% of American 7'+ males between the ages of 20-40 being NBA players (Moses Brown being the only American born player on the list)."
"* My bold prediction is that Bogdan Bogdanovic will not hold onto the starting spot in Atlanta. Seems like a lot of younger guys are ready to break out for them. * Unsure of the Nets lineup--other than the Big 3 (and KD can play multiple positions), I think we'll see a variety of lineups. They sure have a lot of talent. * I know Charlotte played Rozier at the 2 and Ball at the 1 last year, but I think that will change depending on the matchup given LaMelo's size. * Porzingis at the 4 and Kleber at the 5 is not happening IMO. I see Porzingis at the 5 with Kleber or Finney-Smith at the 4, unless Moses Brown earns the starting center spot. Not sure why teams keep bouncing on that experiment, he had a great season last year. * I think Olynyk will start the season at the 4 for the Pistons, moving Grant to the 3. * I don't see any way Marc Gasol starts for the Lakers. Luckily LeBron can be slotted in almost anywhere, AD has some flexibility, and there are some other role players that can get a shot.  * Sorry, but P.J. Tucker should not be starting for the Heat. Even Markieff Morris would be better, ideal situation is Omer Yurtseven comes in off his hot Summer League and moves Bam out to the 4 for a twin towers effect IMO."
based Poku and Moses Brown.  I wish OKC would've held on to Moses.
Crap. You guys have Sharp? I wanted either Dayron or Moses Brown on the Lakers this season. Ugh.
Who knew OKC would miss Moses Brown this much.
Heard an interesting fact while watching the game last night: Houston is the first team in NBA history to play four teenagers in a game. (Didnt play at the same time just same night.)   First time I'd seen Moses Brown on the Mavricks. He had a great steal and fast break dunk. I'm looking forward to seeing more of him.
"The best part of KP’s inability to stay on the court, is now the Mavericks will get to see what Moses Brown can do."
"I watched most of the game. Few takeaways:  OKC moves the ball so well, except for Bazley. Less sharing when he is on the floor.   OKC needs a rolling big on the second unit. Someone like Moses Brown. Then you can let Poku cook in the p’n’r.   OKC color guy can’t pronounce Bjelica’s name and said that dribbling and kicking out is not his game. What!?"
"To be fair, who else would they start at center? WCS? Moses Brown lol? Kleber can’t start with porzingis"
"Fair fair, glad we got to see Moses Brown tbh."
Give Moses Brown Powell’s minutes and start Reggie. Please
"The calls for Reggie Bullock were not exaggerated. Also, more Moses Brown"
Moses Brown where are you standing buddy
"KP defense looks good this season, if his offense looks like last season, i think there's a chance hornets will call, only real nba center in that roster is plumdog lmao, and they need to get PO with Melon-Miles looks good. hayward can be on the move with rise of Bridges, PJ can take his minutes, and they have enough ballhandlers (Ish, Scary Terry, development of Bouk). Like KP for Hayward + Plumdog. later we call Pels for Jonas, if they need young guys to develop again (lmao), we can send Moses Brown + Josh Green (+Powell expiring) + other filler  Luka - Bullock - DFS - Hayward - Jonas, bench : JB - THJ - S.Brown - Maxi - WCS are not too bad"
Omg they put in moses brown  It's happening
"Kleber. DFS. Powell. Boban. Their 10 mill TPE. Bullock. Cauley Stein. All of these players are on deals between like 5-12 mill and are either role players teams would love to have, or expiring relatively soon and the contracts are easy to eat up. They can combine any number of these players with assets like brunson, Moses brown or their picks.  And the hypothetical part is about how successful they’d be with that new lineup you wrote in. Plus since those moves were separate from this trade, they could’ve had most of those players and THJ and KP.  Right now Dallas is more than likely the better team than the Knicks. If you did a poll more people would like side with Dallas. They were also more impressive last year overall. Dallas owes a large chunk of their success to their secondary and tertiary offensive producers in THJ and KP, who they got directly from that trade. New York’s success had nothing to do with that trade. They could have had the exact same team they had last year but with THJ and Kristaps in addition. So as a result I don’t see how they didn’t win the trade, unless New York finds some legit stars in the 20-30 range"
Let Moses Brown take Powell’s minutes
"Luka MVP, KP All-NBA, Brunson SMOTY, Kidd COTY, 16-0 post season. After the Finals, we get 'Bama.   (nah, for real, max it is overestimating a little bit the impact of Moses Brown and Ntilikina. We just want one series win and the season will be a success)."
"That seems like a meaningless distinction to make, though, and it completely ignores that the point of having young players is to accrue stars, not role players.   The group of Luka, Moses brown, Tyrell Terry, Jalen brunson, Frank and Josh green is likely to see way more success over the next 5 years than the OKC group.   The OKC group is only a better core if your goal is to have a bunch of good players and turn into the Pacers and be a fun team to watch with 0 playoff equity."
"That [trade still haunts me](https://section215.com/2021/10/17/philadelphia-76ers-bridges-wrong/). I felt so bad for the kid getting dealt 15 minutes after being drafted by his hometown squad (and his mother's employer). That draft happened soon after GM Bryan ""Big Collar Brand"" Colangelo's burner account fiasco. Brett Brown was the interim GM/head coach responsible for the [*third*-worst trade](https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/76ers/moses-malone-brad-daugherty-charles-barkley-julius-erving) in Sixers history."
"For the Mavs Boban and Moses Brown put up some insane numbers for the minutes they played, like 30/15 per 36. Dwight Powell too, 27/9 per 36 shooting 76%. Who knows, maybe they're all breaking out."
"To name a few... The evolution of Luka.. The maturing supporting cast, Brunson and KP looking really clean in the pre season... The team overall exudes a swagger it didn't last year.  And for the biased fanboy I am. I think overall chemistry and energy displayed is really positive this year.  Powell and Moses brown dominating the paint on 2nd efforts.. Brown and Bullock to add options at the 3 pts line and the slight increase in defensive effort will be felt.  Not to mention seeing a happy KP and a overall super positive attitude that seems to be linked to the change of coaching might impact the game more than we'd think."
Moses Brown: Can part the sea
"Bruce Brown, Jaylen Brown, Moses Brown, Sterling Brown, Greg Brown III, Troy Brown Jr: they are all actually uh wait a second never mind, I pass, pay no heed to my flair"
"I think he definitely deserved one, maybe two. Depends on how you look at it.  I will say I’m in the “Kobe” camp of folks who think Kobe deserved the 2006 MVP. Anytime someone says Kobe deserved the 2006 MVP, they get labeled a salty Kobe stan, but I think I can make a pretty salient argument for Bryant over Nash without resorting to bogus points.   The main argument for Nash over Kobe (or anyone else for that matter) in 2006 has been that he was more impactful on the offensive end by way of his distribution and playmaking, even if his scoring numbers were way behind. That’s fine and dandy, but I didn’t agree with at the time and many advanced impact metrics don’t agree with it currently.   A lot of people try to discredit Kobe’s 2006 regular season as just a “high-scoring” one but every advanced impact metric (not the box-score derived ones like OBPM or OWS, which actually rate Bryant over Nash as well) I’ve been able to find lists Kobe as more impactful offensively in 2006.  In 2006, Kobe had an ORAPM of 5.9. This was higher than Dirk Nowitzki (4.5), LeBron James (3.9), and Steve Nash (4.5.)  Kobe had an overall RAPM of 4.8, trailing behind Dirk (5.4), but ahead of LeBron (4.7) and Nash (4.5).  Kobe had an On/Off ORTG differential of + 20.56. This was higher than LeBron (+ 13.58), Dirk (+ 12.0), and Nash (+ 8.18). For those of you don’t realize how big the On/Off gap was offensively with Bryant and the 2006 Lakers. Here’s some context. The 2006 Lakers, with Bryant on the floor, had the same exact ORTG as the 2006 Suns led by Nash. The 2006 Lakers with Bryant off the floor had a worse ORTG than the 7-59 2012 Charlotte Bobcats (i.e. one of the 8 worst offenses ever).  Kobe had an On/Off NetRTG differential of + 13.37. This was higher than LeBron (+ 9.93), Dirk (+ 9.99), and Nash (+ 9.33).  But what about team record? Well it’s never stopped anyone from getting MVP before. Moses Malone got an MVP in 1979 for winning 47 games. He also got an MVP in 1982 for winning 46 games in the historically weak 80s West. Westbrook won MVP with 47 games. Kareem won MVP while missing the playoffs. Kobe won 45 games in the 2000s West, which is historically the 2nd toughest conference of all-time. His starting line-up was pathetic and featured the likes of Smush Parker, Luke Walton, *AND* Kwame Brown. Winning 45 games in one of the toughest conferences of all-time with a bad supporting cast isn’t out of the realm of possibility, so there’s no point in excluding him out of the race due to record.  Well what about the narrative? MVPs obviously have a narrative-component. Steve Nash’s narrative in 2006 was “Well, look at what the Suns are capable of doing without Stoudemire.” Thats a pretty good narrative, but Kobe had a great narrative too: a historic season-long scoring tear which proved that a team can still be competitive simply by way of an individual’s scoring dominance and subsequent gravity. In 2006, Kobe averaged 35+ PPG. This was the highest pace-adjusted scoring season besides Jordan’s 87 campaign. He scored 81 points in a game. He out-scored the eventual Western Conference champions across 3 quarters. In January, he averaged 43.4 PPG, which was the highest PPG amount in a month since Wilt in 1963 and the highest pace-adjusted PPG of all time at that point. All those 40-point, 50-point games. He was showing that his scoring prowess alone was capable of dragging a team with such a sorry roster to decent heights. I’d say the historical component of his scoring accomplishments was one hell of a narrative.  TLDR: Kobe had a historic season in 2006 and set a million records. He had the narrative on his side. Among the major MVP candidates, Kobe was 1st in ORAPM, 2nd in RAPM, 1st in ORTG differential, and 1st in NetRTG differential. He has the advanced impact metrics on his side. That team had no business sniffing 45 wins in the loaded West and it was due to Kobe. People have won MVP in the past with worse-performing teams so that’s not an excuse. To act like a guy who averaged an efficient 35/5/5 has no business being in the MVP race is silly and revisionist history. The guy ended up with the 2nd most 1st-place votes for a reason."
"You're comparing to prime DeAndre. At age 22, did DeAndre have any more skill than Moses does? He was pretty much a BBIQ ""dumb"" run and jump and rebound and try to block everything guy then too, who continued to get opportunities because of his physical potential. DeAndre grew smarter and learned to be effective with time and experience. Why can't Brown do the same?"
Because deandre Jordan has some skill. Moses Brown has legitimately no skill at all. He may have had an efficient season but he was always a minus on the floor and never helped the team. Sam presti got rid of him for a reason.
I wish they kept Moses Brown. He seemed like a nice diamond in the rough prospect.
"Covid problems. KP injuried for 15 games or more.  Plus we added Reggie Bullock, Sterling Brown, Moses Brown. Brunson seems to be still developing. Josh Green looks more confident. Omoruyi and Carlik are good grabs in the draft. Kidd bringed our chemestry from 40% to 90% etc."
Sterling and Moses brown went hard
I went all the way to spectrum center too only to see Moses brown and Tim hardaway kill us 💀💀💀
"We swapped out Josh Richardson, JJ Redick, and Melli for Moses Brown, Reggie Bullock, and Sterling Brown. We’re also utilizing KP far more effectively from what we’ve seen thus far."
Moses Brown is a garbage time god.
"I was an on airplane with him and Moses Brown one time. Moses was one of the last ones on the plane and the flight attendant outside looked up at him and said ... ""My god son, I hope you're not in coach?!?"" He broke a smile and said, ""no mam, I'm in first class.""  I always liked seeing Jaylen get some minutes in garbage time and summer league. Not a bad prospect and I hope he gets some a good opportunity in OKC."
"Poole averaged 12ppg in 20mpg last season and he didnt even get any momentum for first half of the season bcs of Wanamaker. No reason to not believe he cant average 18ppg in 30+mins.  Nemanja has always been a solid stretch big just that he didnt get any playing time on the Heat. Iggy is old but his perimeter defense was still good last season with the heat. Agree with the OPJ injury issue which is why I said assuming everyone is healthy bcs if you want to take into account injury theres a high chance Porzingis will be out this season as well. Reggie Bullock is the only good addition. Isnt Bruce Brown with the Nets lol? And Moses Brown is only good if you look at the box score, hes basically Andre Drummond Jr, if you watched enough Thunder games last season you will understand, or maybe you can ask any Thunder fans"
"Its just the preseason. ill trust Poole if he is gonna put this numbers in the regular season.  And adding and old Iggy, Nemanja and an always injuried OPJ doesnt make you a top 4 seed team.  As to Mavs improvements: KP is healthy and with an Kidd system he will look better. We also added depth with Bullock, Sterling Brown and Moses Brown. Brunson may take another step in his development. Luka might be the MVP this season. etc."
"In the 1st game against the Jazz we probably had more post-ups than any game since KP has been here. Didn’t always go great, and a lot of those touches were for Moses Brown but was deff a change of pace over what Carlisle had the team doing."
We have no rookies. Appearently Moses Brown is Moses from the bible incarnate so there is that I guess.
"WE SHOULD HAVE KEPT BARNES! We could’ve resigned he and KP and just been over the cap then trotted out Luka/THJ/DFS/Barnes/KP with Jalen, maxi, Dwight Powell etc off the bench. I guess we don’t get to sign Seth and Delon Wright if we don’t trade Barnes, but those guys got traded for Josh richardson who turned into Moses brown and a trade exception we won’t use and Delon Wright was turned into James Johnson who turned into JJ Redick who turned into nothing. Yay"
"Luka had an early season slump last season, but his bad stats from the perimeter comes more from volume than lack of efficiency. Luka was 9th in 3 pt attempts last season and the majority of those shots were tough ones: doubled, trapped, off the dribble. Only late in the season THJ became a reliable scaping valve for him and drew some attention. Of course, Simmons isn't the guy that will make him not be harassed, but if he manages to scale down his attempts (this was a topic this season, with Bullock and Sterling Brown coming to alleviate the fact that we only had 3 reliable perimeter guys in the roster last year, and all 3 had to start), we'll see some extra efficiency. THJ and Bullock are potential 40%+ guys on good volume (specially if THJ have some better looks) and DFS, Maxi and Sterling are 37-39% on decent volume, both starting and coming off the bench.   I don't think it would work, at least in the regular season, due to sheer rebounding. Luka is a great rebounder for a guard, but neither other player in this 5-out team is a good rebounder. Simmons is decent, Maxi, Bullock and THJ just are not. Without KP (and with, if we are being honest), our best rebounder is Powell (could be Moses Brown, if he develops), and starting Simmons in any package that isn't with him in the 2nd unit as PG or in the starting 5 as small ball C won't cut. Powell at the 4 would just clog the paint, but without the MVP upside of Embiid.   Again, I don't think this would happen. Kidd really likes KP and went out of his way to input confidence in him. Also, no way Morey accepts KP one-on-one. They need creators, not another spacer. Buuuut a decent coach could make this work for regular season (we would be abused in some games, but KP is already abused in those games, so, yeah) and, considering Luka can make any big unplayable in the post season, would be a deadly lineup. We can even put Maxi at PF so he can dunk instead of Simmons."
I was devastated when dipshit Larry Brown drafted Larry Hughes tp the 76er's over Paul Pierce. Drafting Okafor was also maddening. Trading Moses Malone for Jeff Ruland? Fuck now I'm sad
"Bold decision, if you are one of the guys that could get cut. Guess its between Frank / Moses Brown / him.  Mavs still need to cut 1 guy, unless they do a trade."
Where does Moses Brown fit?
"He's just helping with training camp rn. Kidd said they want him to come in a bit during the season, so they'll probably add him full time if he wants it. He's been working with WCS and Moses Brown, and both have been positive about it. I think Rick and Donnie moving on had something to do with him being willing to come back."
"Bro, people like Moses Brown go there and get a 40pt game. No it cannot be competitive."
"Moses Brown is the best fit for the Raptors. We need a young center. He, and whoever else needs to be included to match salaries, would be an ideal return."
"Some Mavs starters may not even be rotation players on other teams. DP, WCS, Moses brown all have started and would have trouble getting minutes.  DFS is good defensively but his offense is not up to par.  Maxi is very much a role player."
"Willie Cauley Stein became our starting center... He was cut by the 20 win Warriors. Our center rotation is legitmately one of the worst I have ever seen.   Houston and Orlando can barely win games but they still have Wendell Carter, Mo Bamba or Christian Wood, Sengun, and Daniel Theis, all who are infinitely infinitely better than Powell, WCS, and Moses Brown. Boban is effective in very specific situations that come about like once every 10 games.   That being said, I think Dorian Finney-Smith definitely gets minutes off the bench for the Suns and Jalen Brunson is one of the best backup point guards in the league. Issue is Brunson is straight up our number 3 option and third best player and Finney Smith is our main perimeter and wing defender, and honestly one our more important shooters with how bad Hardaway/Bullock have been.   Hardaway and Bullock need to get it going so our shooting can at least start to cover deficiencies some games. I think both are capable of being very solid players as we saw from both of them last season."
"yeah but in the interim he's far from their biggest issue.  I actually think he's been pretty solid for them and KP has been playing his best ball in years  just nobody could win with that tissue soft interior defense.   it's one of the biggest things you can control in your defensive scheme and mavs have almost no interior presence.   KP can do a bad center impersonation sometimes but with his injury history and his preference for playing on the outside it's a dodgy proposition.   Even on his best day defensively he'll still get abused on the inside on most possessions and has trouble boxing out  and it only gets worse from him, WCS gets pushed around by a stiff breeze.  dwight powell can barely jump and is clearly better as a wing defender than rim defense.  boban can play 10-15 minutes a game tops.  moses brown is a big question mark because of his lack of playing time but if he was showing in practice that he can lock down the rim then kidd would already be starting him and playing him 25 minutes"
"He was before then too tbh, he was sonning moses brown"
Moses Brown is a center. Sterling Brown is not.
"To all the people begging to play Moses Brown more, well, his play speaks for itself"
We’ll throw in Boucher if you give us Moses Brown
"We do, however it's still waiting until it all clicks together. We miss a solid big, and we lack shooting. I still feel trading Moses Brown was a mistake, as we traded the pick we got for that which became Sengun who might fill those two gaps."
"i'd do unspeakable things to make him come back  god, we can make run in the PO if we play our cards right this midseason trade  i'd start with Powell + Josh Green + Moses Brown + FRP"
"Thanks for the ^disappointing insight! I remember hearing about Lou King when he was at Oregon, then noticed he was on a two-way with the Pistons, but even they let him go, so I figured he wasn't ready at all. Glad to hear he might eventually become something.  I kind of wish the Kings just played these guys more. Screw trying to win, go full 2020-2021 Thunder with their Maledon, Bazley, Poku, Roby, Moses Brown lineups. Stop playing Harkless 20 minutes, keep Harrison Barnes and Buddy Hield fresh in case they might get traded, trade or cut TT (13 MPG), maybe ship out Len (16 MPG), and give big minutes to Metu, Ramsey, Woodard, Queta, and King along with Fox, Haliburton, Mitchell, and Holmes. Go for some big picks in future drafts because this ain't it. Heck, even play Bagley big minutes if he doesn't sit out like Ben Simmons.  They need to find out who might work well with their main young core pieces and if they don't, then they either need to spend some time in the G-league or off the team. Rotate in other G-league guys on temp contracts to see if anyone sticks and flip guys between the NBA and G-league (the Jazz did a few times to get our guys reps). Go full process except without the blatant tanking. It's probably better than what y'all have had to endure these last 15 years."
"Jalen is 100% not worth it.  Turner also have 2 years left on the contract so we shouldnt give everything to get him.  2 1st round picks, DFS, Josh Green and Moses Brown may do it. Specially if Turner doesnt plan to resign."
"Turner will be perfect but idk if we have a good trade package to get him.   Any Pacers fan her will take 2 1st round picks, Moses Brown, Josh Green and Sterling Brown for Turner?"
Maybe Harrell?   Idk but they need an upgrade at that spot. Powell and WCS are almost 3rd string players.  Harrell would be a good idea to replace Powell if Mavs want to continue with their current system. If they want to go back to last year system when everyone could shot from the 3 they should look for a stretch big.  As to the assets i think we have 2 1st round picks and we can also send some mediocre prospects like Josh Green and Moses Brown. Maybe Sterling Brown too who is a decent role players but he doesnt seem to fit on Mavs that well so far.
I didn't realize long arms and FG% was all it took to be a starter in the NBA. Someone get Moses Brown on the phone quick!
CAN MOSES BROWN GET SOME MINUTES
"Don't forget last year second half OKC games. Their first option in a bunch of games (with no Dort, SGA, Kenrich, or Muscala) was one of Maledon, Bazley, Pokusevski, Roby, or Moses Brown."
Dude Moses Brown can’t be worse that WCS
Was really hoping Green and Moses would get some run this game. Think Green matches up well with Phoenix’s wings and Brown could be good against McGee
"More than Moses Brown, so too many"
"Nah we are one two-way wing away  Come back black falcon :(  We can give you Josh Green + Moses Brown Kangz, maybe FRP if Nico want all in"
"Honestly. He should've already been in the g league games.   Mavs just sent down Moses Brown and Josh Green, to get reps, because they were just riding the bench anyways."
we regret it every day. we traded down from seth curry to Moses Brown
"I didn't like the hire but Jason Kidd is not the reason we have looked bad against good teams. His in game rotations have been fine. And except for the 1st game against atlanta, the game plan has been fine. The problem has been the starting unit and players shooting way below their 3 point percentage compared to last year. Doncic has started the season slow. Finney-Smith has been horrible shooting so far this season. Powell should not be a starter on any team hoping to be a playoff team and until 2 of the last 3 games KP has struggled with his shot. Also we have no good big men depth. Powell is not good, Willie just looks lost, Boban is a situational player, Moses Brown is too raw and Maxi is hurt. The only guys that has not struggled with his shooting is Jalen Brunson and Maxi before getting hurt.  I guess the one complaint I would have about Kidd so far is keeping Powell as the starter, but even then removing him from the starting lineup is not going to fix the other starters' struggles. Like I said I didn't like the hire but he hasn't given me much to complain about. The struggles we have had have been shooting wise. Things would be fine offensively if Luka was himself and players  that usually hit their 3 point shots were hitting them."
Talk about diminishing value  2019: Traded for Jimmy Butler  2020: Traded for Seth Curry  2021: Traded for Moses Brown
"I find it hard to complain because I was drinking *hard* the ""Ah, we'll lose elite shooting but we'll get good D. J-Rich is the best partner to Luka, he'll defend and knock down 3s"" kool-aid. We also got fooled from the theory J-Rich vs on court J-Rich.  In the end, we traded Seth for a bad rental, Moses Brown and a TPE that, if we are lucky, we'll use it on Favors. This'll go right to Donnie's Powerpoint presentation when he is having an interview."
Moses Brown is not good we had to give it for the Celtics trade to make it work. Yall just be saying anything about OKC man lol
"It's not all about the quality of players.  Salary and years are more important to teams.  Prioritizing salary and years allows you to take big swings in free agency where you can, theoretically (but not in Dallas), get something big for nothing in return.    Even if the Mavs kept Seth instead of trading him for Richardson, they would have just traded Seth before this season because they needed the cap space to pursue Lowry (and because they didn't want to attach a 1st to Powell to get off his salary, plus they value Maxi too much to dump him for a free agency gamble).  The Mavs expected Richardson to play well enough to opt out of his contract for this season, thus clearing enough space to sign Lowry.  Instead, Richardson opted in and they got Moses Brown back.  So the Mavs chose Tyler Bey, Moses Brown, and a non-zero chance at Kyle Lowry over Seth Curry and no chance at Kyle Lowry.  That's a neutral trade and certainly not one of the worst trades in the last decade."
Why? Moses Brown sucks if you go beyond an enticing box score occasionally.
Whenever someone proposes Moses Brown as a solution it’s obvious they have either never watched the guy play or do not understand basic basketball (like Moses)
You mean the same Moses Brown who can’t even mins on the Mavs is KP out
Time lord is insanely better than Moses brown lol
"Celtics need a big man, should’ve kept Moses Brown"
"I know Moses Brown is pretty raw, but he's gotta be better than WCS."
"I didn't really follow Moses Brown all that much but a lot of OKC fans were suggesting he's a second coming of Andre Drummond. I'm not a fan of Josh Richardson by any means, but the contract he signed was very obviously for salary matching purposes in the future."
"We traded for Moses Brown, who at least has some potential, for Josh Richardson  Gimme Moses Brown on a minimum and let him ride the bench and maybe improve over the year for slightly cheaper"
"Why isn't Moses Brown getting more minutes? Wasn't he getting double doubles last year? Albeit on a terrible OKC team trying to tank, but still..."
Moses Brown has to be better than WCS
"I don't think they did that bad this off-season. They got a bench which is more than they could say last season. I'd probably taken a PG instead of Al Horford but the roster is much better than last year. Whereas the Mavs got Reggie Bullock, Sterling Brown, Moses Brown and that's about it."
"Oh, no doubt. We sometimes think real life is like 2K where you get to move players every other day and expect that from every front office, every off-season.   However, with Powell and KP seemingly regressing, you'd think they'd try to do *something*. Moses Brown ain't it."
"That's what I meant exactly. KP is tall but plays like he's 6'5 - it's not even just core strength, he doesnt even want that smoke going for rebounds or playing physical at all. Boban is huge but not good at much of anything. Moses Brown is talented but extremely raw and young, and liable to get pushed around by real big men (Jokic owned him last year when he played for OKC, not really a fair comp, but still).   I think again aside from their very flawed big men, the biggest problem is also their lack of a real secondary ballhandler. Without that the offense is just too heliocentric."
"The irony is the Mavs have a ton of size. The problem is that size is mostly used up by not-good/flawed players. Boban, Moses Brown, and KP.   I like Brown's potential but you want to start him on a team that wants to make the jump from good playoff team to top 4 seed? Good luck.   They have a ton of wings which is good too, in theory. But none of them are truly that good defensively which is a problem. DFS and Bullock are solid but not great. THJ is bad. Kleber is less a wing than a tweener 4/5, and they sometimes ask him to guard wings which is... no bueno.   Then there's the real issue - they have Brunson who's a fine backup 1, but no real secondary option / ballhandler to ease the load on Luka consistently with the starters at a high level. It's unhealthy for Luka (and for the Mavs offense as a whole) to be doing his best James Harden impression."
Moses Brown looks like he’s wearing smaller shorts than Burke lol
Not used to seeing someone almost as tall as bol bol out there (moses brown)
"He can try Moses Brown out. Or he could have played Boban earlier, Boban has historically been solid against Denver"
"Please give Moses brown some run , looked 🔥 in person the other day"
"It’s Powell or wcs or boban, throw in Moses brown if your feeling Randy"
You watched Moses Brown drop 20/20 and you post this Garbo?
Just go pick up Moses Malone.  I mean Brown. Moses Brown.
no one could stop moses brown - and then there was luke kornet. and he splashed in bacck to back 3s.
Moses “Malone” Brown was right there
Well Moses Brown is the next Wilt so...
Moses Brown or Boban. They are huge!
Sga goes from star to super star. Dort turns into prime Draymond minus the mouth. We draft Cade and he becomes a star. Poku and Moses brown bulk up and develop a barely serviceable jumper. We sign trade for a star power forward using a few of our 34 picks over the next 7 years
Did you see Tacko pat Moses Brown on the head after he dunked?
Moses “Moses Cuh” Brown
"Prolly cause he's actually shooting 27% from 3 over the past 2 seasons. Idk why you're ready to proclaim him as better than Theis after one good night lol.  He's tall, that's a plus. Him being so tall meant he could slow down a guy like Moses Brown who is huge and athletic but still raw, but it's not always gonna be enough"
Moses “Wilt the Stilt” Brown looks pretty damn NBA ready to me. Haircut and all  Presti really looked at him and thought “Yep no need for Horford anymore”.
Moses Brown played like Wilt Chamberlain for the first half and then just stopped
"bruh Moses Brown good but u acting like hes Embiid lmao ""neutralizing"" a 21 year old who dropped 20/20 on the Celtics"
Moses Brown
Moses “**Wilt Chamberlain**” Brown  Great game by the kid but unfortunately his efforts were stifled in the second half by *Luke “White Bill Russell” Kornet*
Have you ever seen Kareem Abdul Jabaar and Moses Brown in the same room
Moses “**Wilt Chamberlain**” Brown
"Tacko at 7-5, Moses Brown at 7-2, and Luke Kornet at 7-2 all played relevant minutes in this game. Is this the tallest game of all time?"
I think everyone needs to clear out and let Kornet and Moses Brown settle this mano a mano.
"Damn, imagine trying to win a title and struggling against Ty Jerome and fuckin' Moses Brown."
Moses Brown &gt;&gt;
Who the hell is Moses Brown??
Kornet is the Moses brown stopper. Brand new sentence.
Moses Brown parting the Cs
Moses Brown is unbelievably efficient apparently.
"Hot take, but I think the Celtics could’ve used a big, maybe even a Moses Brown type."
Moses Brown plays like Whiteside if he gave a damn
Moses Brown has 19 rebounds In a half?!?!
Moses Brown it says in the title
"What the hell is going on today? First Moses Brown gets 17 and 19 in a half, then Mitchell goes off for 28 on 12 shots in a half."
Russell “Moses Brown” Westbrook
Those rebound numbers are Moses Brown-like.
Who in the world is Moses Brown and how does he have 17/19 already
Presti is sitting Horford to give his minutes to Moses Brown and Tony Bradley the rest of the season. Brown has been better than Horford since coming back from the G-League bubble. I really don’t think playing Horford would make the Thunder any better. To each their own.
Moses Brown would have had those rebounds in one quarter
There's only been two 30-30 games in the last 30 or so years - Kevin Love and Dwight Howard.   Moses Brown isn't doing it.
Who is better? Andre Drummond or Moses Brown?
Moses brown more like Moses Malone
are the celtics ok moses brown nearly has a 20/20 game in 15 mins
Trade Vucevic and LaVine for Moses Brown and they will be fine.
Moses Brown should do a 23andme to verify whether he’s a grandson of Wilt “Genghis Khan” Chamberlain
"I literally hadn't heard of Moses Brown until I picked him off waivers in fantasy yesterday, but holy shit 14 rebounds in 11 minutes?????"
Moses Brown is a legit NBA player. OKC can really get those good undrafted free agents can't they
I’m not an OKC fan by any means but I have Moses Brown in fantasy and his numbers (when he starts) are pretty legit.
I play fantasy too bruh but I have Moses brown over Poetl.
Moses brown flashbacks
"Hah you kids clearly never saw the greatest Moses in his prime. Leave your GOAT Moses talks to the adults, okay?  Talk to me when Moses Brown parts a whole sea."
Moses brown played at UCLA right?
Blazers legend Moses Brown
I knew everyone out of the draft or from the Pelicans except Isaiah Roby or Moses Brown. I heard about Moses Brown on a podcast where Hollinger was talking about the best G-League guys but I've never heard of Isaiah Roby in my life.
"I know Moses Brown because he played with Carson Edward’s in College  I know Kenrich because of his haircut  I knew Poku, Jackson and Maledon but that’s about it"
"Hats off to you! Moses Brown has played something like 4 total NBA games with this last one being by far the most notable, so I was expecting him to be the outlier if any"
"The Bramble king, The long mile, 40 years in the desert, The big stretch, Man of the Red Sea...the myth, the legend Moses Brown."
"I’m pretty updated with NBA rosters due to 2K and such, but I thought they put a myplayer on the court for the Thunder. I was shocked as hell when this guy were dropping buckets on us. For real, Moses Brown was reaaaaaalllll nice.  So I now gotta put respect on this kid’s name ✊"
"Fair -- I am a Thunder fan so I know all of the players but it is an interesting bunch. Obviously SGA, Poku, and Theo are all the exceptions. They are probably the core (with Dort and Baze) of the Thunder future. SGA is the core of the Thunder present too ha  Honestly, the rest of the guys have looked quite solid in the past with Moses Brown killing it in the G-league (a few 20-20 games)"
Moses Brown is new to me.
Had no clue who Moses Brown is. Still have no clue.
Only one I never heard of was Moses Brown. Darius Miller is a little fuzzy. I think he played for the Pels right?
"Put some respect on Moses ""Malone"" Brown, dude dropped 20/16 with 5 blocks"
"Follow the nba very closely, but even so, I have no clue who Moses Brown is."

"Ah yes Moses Brown, the guy who, for some reason, lead my 2025 Spurs to a title along with Wendell Carter Jr and Cam Reddish, in NBA 2K16... it wasn't always pretty but it worked."
"It's good to see him playing himself onto a roster. I watched him at UCLA and remember thinking he wasn't anywhere near NBA ready. How is his free throw shooting? In his college days, I remember describing each trip to the line as the ""Moses Brown extreme free throw catapult adventure experience."""
Moses Brown came into the restaurant I bartend at earlier this week and stiffed my homeboy who served him on a $50 bill lol
"Damn, I never could’ve imagined Moses Brown having a 20/10 game in the NBA when I was watching him at UCLA. Good for him."
Who the hell is Moses Brown
Shoutout to Moses brown
Moses Brown though.
"I did not know Moses Brown had gotten drafted lmao, I swear I saw a HS Mixtape of him ages ago"
Big respect to Moses Brown for actually try-  Naw fuck that he got killed lmaooo
Why does Moses brown look so familiar
"Moses Brown, Trail Blazer legend. Instead of calling him up when we had 8 active guys, we said “Uh..fuck it...Tolliver at the 5.”"
Moses is undoubtedly the best Brown in the NBA.

Bazeley over the offseason grew from a teenager to a 20 yr old impersonating a grown ass man with muscle and definition. Poku will hopefully be the same. Moses Brown too.  These men just gotta get proper weight treatment and dieting. Next Oct he's going to get some of that KD muscle going
"Presti after last game: So it seems playing Poku and Moses is finaly helping our tank, let's keep going.   Poku and Brown: We must redeem ourselves in the eyes of sensei!  Presti: No! Why? WHYYYYY?!!!  PS:someone made a coment using this format on a previous thread, I'm just piggybacking off their work"
Is it bad to say the Moses brown looks like a WNBA player? The hair and the shorts idk what it is
Moses brown is so fucking good
Is Moses Brown a real nba player? I’m surprised to see him playing.

Did Moses Brown forget his shorts and have to borrow a teammates pair?
That Moses Brown dude is kinda  nice
"Idk man theo has been really good for us so far despite being drafted in the 2nd round and poku...well poku was seen as a project player anyway so he might take a while. Some of the new young guys on the team too are pretty good and have potential like moses brown, roby, and kenrich williams so personally I’m not too worried when it comes to scouting talent."

"Look at the minutes by Pokusevski,  Maledon, Ty Jerome and Moses Brown"
moses brown is 8ft tall holy cow
Moses Brown seems decent and you guys got some much needed cap space at least
"&gt; Moses Brown  There are plenty of reasons to like this trade in Boston, the monetary flexibility being chief among them.  But Moses Brown is not definitely better than a 16th pick.  He's your classic ""give a guy run on a terrible/tanking team and he's going to have flashes of promise"" guy.  I watched him a lot - he should not be getting minutes on a good team.   But even if Moses Brown never plays a minute for Boston and is out of the league, the trade makes sense for both squads."
"At face value, is this the worst trade of all time? Unless this Moses Brown guy is MJJ"
Shh let them live with their delusions. #16 over moses brown. Pretty sure presti must have been really surprised they included 16.
Everybody gangsta until Moses Brown becomes regular all nba
Yeah im taking that 16th pick over moses brown. Enjoy celtics fans
"Yeah the logic would be that giving up close to a lottery pick in what is essentially a swap of two bad contracts is an overpay, but that ignores a ton of context.  Horford is a much more useful player to us than Kemba at this point, we needed big depth bad and unfortunately Kemba needs the ball to be useful which hurts the J’s.   Horford does not need a lot of touches or minutes to be useful, at bare minimum he (and also Moses Brown) are big bodies we can use to keep Timelord fresh and best case scenario is we utilize him better than his past two teams and he is resurgent after a year of resting a bunch. We can also now re-sign Fournier without a disgusting luxury tax bill as well.   Finally, we don’t really have the roster space or minutes to spend on developing another mid 1st rd pick, so all things considered it’s a fair trade for us"
"OKC fans, what do yall think of moses brown?"
"Ferguson was a 1st round pick by them iirc, so that cancels out the Philly pick. Danny Green minus Moses Brown is about the 16th pick value.  So you're left with a 30 year old guard who's maxed and relies on his quicks but has no knees.   Not as amazing when you break it down like this, but a great job by Presti of keeping the transaction velocity up so he can rotate through players that aren't going to be great until he finds ones worth keeping."
Brad must’ve fallen in love with that first half from Moses Brown during the OKC/BOS game.
Moses Brown will be a steal.  He's 7'2 and active on both ends of the floor - high energy.  He gets to learn from Horford. The Celtics got two big men.
"That's a pretty good haul.   You aren't likely to get a better player than Moses Brown with the 16th pick. That dude was a rebounding phenom this season. I haven't seen him play to be honest, so I can't speak to his defensive game or offensive game (though he seems at least to know enough not to take shots he doesn't have a good chance of making given his FG% is over .500).   Al Horford might be 34 and owed two pricey seasons of salary, but he's the glue guy they've been missing.   They should have never let him go.  It's a shame. Hanging onto Kyrie and letting him walk cost this team so much. They could have just traded him during his last season and got any number of pieces back for him and not lost Scary Terry or Horford along the way."
Uh don't forget Moses Brown who really impressed for a few stretches last year.
I like to imagine Moses Brown is our 16th pick
"plenty of reasons, financial flexibility, getting a guy back who everyone on the team loves and may still be able to have a role on the team, and then Moses Brown might have some upside at a position of need as well.  Paying an undersized, old pg 36 million to play 55 games a year is a great way to waste Jaylen and Tatum's prime."
#FUCK YEAH MOSES BROWN
I've only watched about 10 games Moses Brown has played so I'll take your word for it. He is only 21 so plenty of time left to develop.
"&gt;	I dont think majority of Celtics fans 48 hrs ago wouldve been on board with doing this, alot of revisionist history and rationalizations now to make it seem like this was part of their plan all along and that it's now a win-win.  lol what??? Kemba is a 6’0” 31 year old PG with bad knees and cap hits of $36+ million due the next couple years.  Horford not only creates cap room, but is more productive, more dependable, and actually a positive on defense instead of a liability.  As far as the #16 pick &amp; Moses Brown part of the equation, look at the history of that pick, I’d  rather have Moses than half the dudes picked there."
"Moses Brown, Robert Williams, Tako Fall-- they're building a fucking wall. It's going to be Stan Van Gundy."
I see this as a basically Moses Brown for two first round picks (Kemba will likely be converted to another 1st)  and some 2nd round swaps
"Raw is absolutely the correct term to describe Moses Brown. If you can prove Moses Brown’s 52 career games played isnt raw, then you may have a case."
Very doubtful. Capela actually has hands. Moses brown has bricks.
Exactly why I’m 100% okay with this. Boston has messed up so many mid-firsts over the past few years and Moses Brown already looks like he’ll be better than whoever goes at that spot anyway. Brown+Williams can be a solid center rotation for the next decade
"You’re out of the loop. Kemba sat out the entire first half of the season to rest his knee and still couldn’t play in back to backs when he returned. He’s getting max money to play 50 games a year, tops. Boston frees up enough space to re-sign Fournier, gets Horford back where he had his best years, and gets Moses Brown who will likely be better than whoever gets taken at 16 anyway"
"Good point.   I always struggle with the idea of when you make that switch from the futures bright to let’s try to contend. It’s not any time soon and I don’t think OKC has any pressure yet.   I’m a Celtics fan, so I’m wary of the hey look at all these picks! Some of them end up tatum and Jaylen, most of them did not.   Good work by presti overall though. I’m excited to talk myself into Moses brown. Haha"
Wait. So Boston now have: TimeLord TT Al Horford Moses Brown and... Tacko Fall? That's a lot of Bigs.
"Kemba’s knees are bone on bone and he can’t play back-to-backs anymore, so he’s essentially on a max deal to play 50 games a year. On top of that, it became blindingly evident this season that his play style doesn’t mesh with the Jays at all. On top of that, this saves us enough money to likely be able to re-sign Fournier, brings Horford back to the place where he has the best years of his career, and swaps a 16th pick for Moses Brown who’s probably going to be better than whoever gets picked there anyway"
"If you think Moses Brown is better than the 16th pick in a loaded draft then you’re the nephew.  Moses put up the emptiest stat lines of all time for a team tanking and playing all g leaguers. As an okc fan I’d much rather take a shot on Kai or Garuba or giddey in that ranch. Moses is what he is.   A center who can’t shoot, doesn’t play good d and when teams actually saw him play couldn’t score other than put backs against awful competition"
"I know y’all needed to get rid of Kemba, but I feel like if Boston put a few more pieces in there, they could’ve  gotten an a lot better trade than 35 year old Al Horford who hasn’t played in awhile and Moses Brown. Not dissing Moses Brown, he looks like he could be a good talent if he develops right but I don’t think aging Al Horford was worth it."
Moses Brown is a beast! I was worried we weren’t gonna be able to get rid of Kemba and now we have a guy who has experience w the Celtics and is a better leader. Sure we don’t have a 1st now but we’ve been adding a first rounders to the team for the last 5 years we don’t need anymore young olayers
"Also, Moses could be more useful than Tristan in a lot of packages. Cheap for a 3rd big option, and could turn out into a good trade asset. I call this a win for Boston if they did not eye anyone within this draft.   Pritchard/Smart/Brown/Tatum/Williams, with Fournier and Horford coming off the bench could bring the Celtics back to the ECF, specially if Nesmith develops his shooting."
"You haven't watched enough Moses Brown. He's barely an NBA player. He could become something though, he has potential."
"I can actually answer this- Moses Brown is a likely future Hall of Famer, though not necessarily first ballot  SOURCE: Desperate Celtics who just googled ""Moses Brown highlights"""
Ya I feel crazy reading this sub. Die hard Celtics and kemba fan but id take horford over kemba on their respective contracts 100/100 times. A 16th and Moses brown swap to make that happen doesn’t seem like a steep price to pay.
Great salary dump for the Celtics and nice addition for them in Moses Brown.
"I don't know you if guys have seen Moses Brown hoop but I like that kid's game  A LOT. I can't believe that he went Undrafted.   Trading the 16th Pick for him was a great move. Boston usually has a ton of picks but unless they are picking high (like JB &amp; Tatum) they go to waste because their scouting has been awful &amp; they haven't done a good job of developing players.  I like the Stevens era already, trading picks for proven players that fit what you want to do is a good move."
"We love that deal in Boston. 20M$ economy next year, and Moses Brown who's definitely better than a 16th pick."
"I have bad news for Celtics fans. I watched every Thunder game this season. Moses Brown had one great half (against the Celtics), but he is the most uncoordinated player I’ve ever seen in the NBA. He can rebound and dunk and give a little rim protection, but he’s an absolute liability offensively. Once teams learned how to guard him, he was not effective. I do not think he’s a real NBA rotation player. Time Lord is much better."
"He wasn't even that good in his prime on the Hawks low-key. Definitely like Capela more than I ever liked him and I don't even love Capela. His contract is like 7 mil cheaper than Kembas tho so that is decent, but Kemba is better and they gave up a first rounder. Who is this Moses Brown guy I don't anything about him other than that he's tall af."
"Stevens made a good one on his first trade imo If we got just Moses Brown, this trade would've been fine, horford is there for cap shenanigans and chemistry"
"Don’t worry, it’s all coming together. Now we got Horford and Timelord as our backcourt, Moses Brown and Tristan Thompson as our wings, and Marcus Smart as our center. We’ll be unstoppable"
"I’d say, give Moses Brown some time and minutes and proper coaching guidance. In 3-4 years he can be what? Jarrett Allen?"
I'm honestly surprised OKC are trading Moses Brown. He seems like a really promising young player with size/athleticism and significant potential as a lob threat/rim protector. Not sure what acquiring Kemba Walker does for them at this stage in their rebuild.
Moses Brown and cap space Good trade imo
"Moses Brown shot 60.2% from shots within the 5 ft from the basket.  To contextualize, here are some other OKC players’ number.  Tony Bradly - 74.4  Kenrich Williams - 65.7  Mike Muscala - 64.4  Jaylen Hoard - 63.3  SGA - 61.2  Svi - 60.6  Isaiah Roby - 60.3  All better than the only 7 footer on the team.  Some Celtics Numbers for more comparison  Jabari Parker - 85  Robert Williams - 78.4  Luke Kornet - 77.8  Tacko Fall - 75  Tatum - 65.9  Brown - 62.9  Semi Ojeleye - 62.9  Romeo Langford - 62.5  Aaron Nesmith - 61.7  Kemba - 61.7  Grant Williams - 61.1"
Moses brown is the best player in this trade prove me wrong
"I like Moses brown and al horford but I’m guessing this is just the beginning of many moves to free up cap space for a 3rd star.  Moses brown is a great, young center who can really rebound.  Al is also a great team guy."
moses brown is insanely promising. probably the biggest part of this deal imo. will be fun to see him play alongside timelord.
Moses brown can’t step foot for a playoff team for meaningful minutes lol. What’s the point of this
"He really doesn’t imo. Very slow, doesn’t have the defensive awareness and instincts that comes with being an nba 5. I swear i feel like im going crazy with how people are looking st brown , he had some big games here and there but was awful for the majority of the season. Maybe it’s just Celtics fans trying to rationalize it, or that the only game they watched of him was his best game of his career. Stevens in the doc rivers school of signing every role player that went off against his team. I rather bank on the chance of drafting an og anunoby, gobert, or something than ending up with Moses brown who can’t sniff a playoff rotation"
Surprised Presti didn't love Moses Brown enough to not trade him. Wasn't he a pretty solid prospect this season?
horford and moses brown..?
horford + grant Williams + Moses brown in garbage time isn’t a bad center rotation at all
"All I know is that Moses ""Malone"" Brown got a 20/20 against the Celtics this year"
"I actually really like this for both teams  Kemba's contract is much bigger and prohibiting Boston from making decent trades with him at the moment as his deal expires in 2 years and he has tanked his value as a playoff starter  He also has creates a lot of redundancy with Boston's offensive scheme which isn't great in this context, as Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum should be the primary playmakers for that team. Kemba was just offering average to sub par 3 point shooting and defense at that position while also bringing below-average knees (he missed a ton of games for Celtics, who ultimately could have benefitted from a 1-2 seed bump to make a deeper playoff run)  On top of this, Boston has been desperate for rebounding and shot blocking. Horford has been great in the paint most of his career and Moses Brown is a promising defensive center, so they are replacing a negative asset  doing something they don't need with two that have much more upside, given that all they have to do is help reduce Tristan Thompson's minutes  OKC gets picks and a ball handler to drive the tank"
Shit this could end up being the Moses Brown trade lol
Can’t imagine it helps Moses Brown much either but he sorta fell off a cliff anyway. But not before he put up 20/20 vs me
Moses Brown went hard against the Celtics. Anyone that actually watches games would know who he is.  Edit: Just ran into the stats from the game I’m talking about. 21 points and 23 rebounds. It was kind of hard to ignore the seven footer doing whatever he wanted.
"Your comment makes me think Presti might have a big in this draft he likes, and throwing Moses Brown in a trade makes room for more touches for possibly a more promising big man"
"I like Moses Brown Cuh, he is a fantastic rebounder and raw. He is tall and if he develops a jumpshot, great piece for the Celtics."
Is Moses Brown that good??
"Yup, it was going to be a bad trade for the Celtics no matter what, so at least they got a serviceable Al Horford and a decent prospect in Moses Brown"
The only time I've seen Moses Brown play he dropped  21 pts - 23 reb on us. So I think so?
If you think Moses Brown us better than 2021 #16 you’re smoking some crazy shit.
"Moses brown is nothing more than a project player. He is closer to Tacko fall in terms of ability.  He undeniably cares and puts all his effort into the game. Unless this trade changes him I don't think Celtics fans will ever think he doesn't care.   Unfortunately, that doesn't mean he's good. He will rebound and score open looks, but he is also very poor defensively on anything not one on one coverage.   Definitely a end of the bench guy. He's a piece you put in the trade to have another piece in the trade and it wouldn't really suprise me if this was his only contract in the nba."
"Sure, but the value of a 16th pick when it comes to trading up matters a lot more than Moses brown lol. You can fond guys like him in the gleague, teams don’t value him at all"
Whoa Moses Brown and Time Lord? Boston semi-spicy
"Moses Brown is a good prospect he can split minutes with TimeLord, Horford is expensive but still less expensive then Kemba and his contract is a year shorter. Celtics haven’t gotten much from their mid-1sr round picks recently anyway"
"I like Kemba and wish him the best, I, but I like the move. It gives the Celts flexibility to make moves to improve the team. I'm really excited about Moses Brown. The Celts finally have a legit big! Brown is 7'2"" and only 21. He dominated the Celts back in March with 21 points and 23 rebounds. Horford is back too, but I wouldn't be surprise if he is moved."
Moses is raw. He can develop his game. Statistically he had a better overall season than James Wiseman. He is a black hole for rebounds and an easy lob bucket. I’d rather have Moses than a random #16 pick. #16 pick could be anything. Maybe a Moses Brown.
"I wasn't sure about this until I thought about it some more. Kemba went from being the long-time #1 to a maybe #3 if healthy. In OKC he'll be able to give them some knockoff-CP3 vibes; not enough to drag em to the playoffs, but enough to win a couple games and make the season fun and sell some tickets.  Horford ain't who he was with the Celtics last time he played there but he doesn't need to be, the way Tatum and Brown have developed since. And Moses Brown is a solid, big talent that helps fortify their depth there."
"It’s a shame. Kemba is a great dude by all accounts. He’s also a really solid player when healthy. I don’t know if Brad Steven’s first move as gm should have been to signal to the league that they will continue to be ruthless a la Ainge. Players had made it pretty clear that they didn’t appreciate that approach when it came to free agency. If he had picked up something worthwhile, maybe, but is Al Horford at this age really going to be the game changer? Full disclosure, I don’t know a ton about Moses Brown."
Realistically Moses Brown is probably better than the crapshoot that is the 16th pick.
"Horford is absolutely washed and Moses Brown is a nobody. Brad Stevens got robbed blind, I told every Celtic fan this is what would happen if you let a guy with zero management experience take over the president of basketball operations."
Kemba Walker and a 1st for Al Horford and Moses Brown? Guess Boston really liked Al.
We still have TT and this trade includes Moses brown who is raw but showed a ton of upside.
Bummed Kemba didn’t work out here. How is Moses Brown as a player?
Horford is a solid player still and a forward that they need . They lost theis and really only have Robert Williams . Now they got 2 solid front court players and Moses brown can rebound like a mofo and has great potential
Horford has some health problems too and I don't see how he will significantly improve this celtics roster. His passing is welcome obviously but they still need a legit playmaking PG if they want Tatum/Brown to stop playing iso ball for the whole game.      Also the 16th pick is a very good asset. Much better than moses brown at the very least.
Celtics fans after finding out who Moses Brown is this morning: “The guy is a stud. He’s so underrated.”
"Ty for the answer. So I take you don't see the system changing too much, regardless of what head coach ye get?  Cant say I know much about Moses Brown either, but from following gleaguetv on Instagram, he can get a lot of rebounds at the very least"
"I’m curious if the Celtics make another move with their centers.  They’ve got Horford, TT, Time Lord, and Moses Brown now."
Moses Brown is a future great
The best player in this trade will be Moses Brown Cuh.
Moses Brown will be the best player in this trade in a few years
Moses brown too! LETS GO BRAD
"Come on, Moses Brown has a good contract but he's a replacement level center, he's had some huge games but he's a center who can't shoot or pass, his assist numbers are Whiteside-esqe, he's clearly not worth a 1st"
Absolutely. Our team functions better with a playmaker at the 5. Plus horford knows the system and had really good chemistry with the jays and smart. Moses brown is a nice little piece that I don’t know much about to be honest
Celtics got their center of the future too. Moses Brown is a beast and only 21!
Moses brown the steal
Depends how Moses Brown ends up developing
where's the positive asset you gave up Moses   16 pick is at least equal in value to Moses Brown.  I'd rather have Horfords contract than Kembas.
"Moses Brown is a super solid prospect at the 5 who put up some decent numbers on OKC this season. Honestly, not a bad return considering you're swapping a pick outside of the lottery."
"Celtics got a pretty good return imo. Not sure with their cap situation but Al has a ""cheaper"" contract and Moses Brown looked pretty good. Not to mention, it looks like kemba is washed and does not complement the Jays"
Moses Brown and Time lord. Gonna be nice for Celts
"Maybe I'm just crazy, but I'd 100% trade the 16th pick for Moses Brown."
Moses Brown has a ton of potential.
"Yeah, Kemba is really that bad. Don't give max contracts to undersized point guards on the wrong side of 30. It sucks they had to get off a first, but Moses Brown is a solid prospect and it probably signals that Boston isn't comfortable with Timelord's conditioning.  Ainge had a weird boner for getting a superstar point guard but all in all Kemba's money should've been used for smaller, more tradeable assets."
moses brown and al horford
moses brown lmao stop being a nephew
I would say mavs but we just got Moses brown
"Don’t waste your time then. Every fanbase has some people who say stupid shit so I was keeping an open mind at first. But at this point you’ve given me no reason to believe you. In fact you keep changing the details. Did one of our “nut job fans” make a comment that got upvotes around the 30 to 40 range? Or were there multiple comments made by multiple users which all had upvotes around that range?  And like I said, there is a big difference in thinking Moses Brown specifically is a better player right now than Myles Turner and any of the other things you brought up. I don’t see any argument for Moses &gt; Turner. There are arguments, even if you disagree with them, that Robert Williams &gt; Turner or Turner isn’t *that* good a player, or that the Celtics are better off not tying themselves to Turner salary wise for a number of reasons."
This is the Steph Curry moving circle offensive foul question but actually workable. Porzingis from half court hands off to Moses brown at the 3 line who hands off to Boban for the standing dunk
Blowtics legend Moses Brown
"Lol it doesn’t take long to look up “Moses” in our sub and take a quick scroll, especially if, as you suggest, they were highly upvoted.   Also not sure if this was made clear enough but I was responding only to your reply to the original comment (about Cs fans being excited for Moses) where you said we had highly upvoted comments on our sub claiming Moses was already a better player than Myles.   That was as far as my response went - the supposed comparison of Moses and Myles. Nothing about how Celtics fans have compared Turner to other players or how much value they think he has overall. Thinking Turner is mediocre is not at all the same thing or mutually exclusive to thinking he’s clearly better than Moses Brown."
Moses Brown has been traded twice this offseason lol
He’s not a bad dude but we traded a good player for him and he underperformed on a pretty hefty contract. Even if moses brown is the worst player to ever put on a Mavs jersey he’s making the league minimum.
"They could’ve traded Oubre at the deadline, they didn’t iPad it’s a complete fuck up. Bruce Brown was one example, teams make trades on the margins for useful vets all the time. The Mavs got Moses Brown for free and dumped a bad contract in the process today. Moses Brown would be playing 20+ mins per game for the Warriors, he’s better than Wiseman."
One time I was playing 2k and Moses Brown grabbed 9 offensive rebounds in a row during one possession and scored against me and it pissed me off. So ya good deal Mavs
Moses Brown is good. Good pick up.
"Thanks. Yeah, Curry is pretty clearly the better player at this point. Turned Seth Curry into Moses Brown, not ideal."
"They are taking back Moses Brown though, they are close to $28M in cap space now."
"It’s $28M, Moses Brown has a salary."
You can't possibly watch WCS move and then watch Moses Brown move and tell me that Brown plays better defense and is more athletic than WCS.
"If they have Moses Brown KP Boban and Powell why do they need another center.  That’s 4 centers and KP shouldn’t be playing the 4, although with Kidd he probably will."
"I remember when Celtics fans were saying they'd rather have Moses Brown over a lottery pick, good times"
I have bad news for you but Moses Brown is not an NBA caliber center
"His contract is equal to the 25th pick of this years draft. So ask yourself, would you rather have Moses Brown or Quentin Grimes at 25?? Could make an arguement that Moses is at least an equivalent prospect. In essence, Mavs potentially got themselves the equivalent of a 2021 first rounder in a salary dumb."
lol. Moses Brown is under contract for the next *3* years at 1.8 million per season. He won't be getting paid for a while. His contract was a fucking steal. Also his stats this year were pretty fucking good.
"I truly don’t know what Moses Brown clip you watched last season for OKC, but he is not a good defender. Don’t let some of his nice blocks fool you, the man was a traffic cone on defense."
Moses Brown definitely showed promise and talent last season. I’ll take my chances.
Moses Brown isn’t good…?
"I really like Moses Brown, kid has star potential."
Damn Moses Brown stonks
There was some speculation that Moses Brown would be included. Thank fuck we get to keep him.
"Moses Brown and Bruno Fernando, apparently"
Moses Brown and Al horford
"We also had way too many bigs. Out of Horford, Timelord, Moses Brown, and TT, he's clearly the odd man out."
Huh I completely missed that y'all got Moses Brown too
Al Horford/Robert Williams/Moses Brown/Bruno Fernando
"Timelord, Horford, Moses Brown"
"Horford, Timelord, Moses Brown, and now Fernando rather than TT.  Also Kornet, but lol"
"OKC will continue rebuilding into the 2030s by trading FRPs and eventually assets (SGA, Dort, Poku, etc) for heavily-protected FRPs which will eventually convey after six or seven years as second round picks. Similar to other nobodies who developed a bit like Diallo and Moses Brown, every other lesser player will get traded for picks. OKC won't probably stop until it gets every other team's picks or until it builds a team of tall or athletic players with some playmaking and nil shooting skills for its position-less and ""shooting-less"" basketball.   Imagine all the passes thrown around during possessions that will end up building houses with all the resulting bricks hahaha"
"I’m not that high on Moses Brown. His stats make him look better than he is, but he’s only 21, so he’s got tons of time to get better."
I feel like we haven’t had a Moses since Moses Malone until Moses Brown last year and now we got both Brown and Moody
"I’d take Moses Brown over every C in the draft tonight besides Mobley and Sengun- and that includes the two my own team drafted. I really like him, think he’s a good piece for the Celtics."
OKC turning Al Horford and Moses Brown into 2 firsts is kinda neat lol.
"Moses Brown is one of the least talked about insane value contracts, dude is statistically the best offensive rebounder in basketball and he's on a vet min for 3 years with a team option lol"
"It's a good thing Shai doesn't have to get paid right this minute. Even then, that still doesn't mean he would trade him for a pick. We had to fight to hit the salary floor this past season. How do you think Moses Brown got a NBA deal?"
I'd give whatever Moses Brown got.
There is no farm big enough to include Brown in a CJ trade. Maybe Moses
Moses Brown
"&gt;That didnt involve a draft pick or a player who signed a recent extension  It involved both.  1. The #16 pick in the 2021 draft  2. Moses Brown, who had recently signed an extension (signed in March)"
"- Hell or high water, the Thunder move up and take Mobley, whether it's the Cavs or the Raptors. I just think he fits too well on that roster, and I can't think of any other reason they traded Moses Brown after his semi breakout at the end of the season.  - Warriors swing a trade for either Christian Wood or Siakam using the 7th pick, 14th pick, Wiseman, and matching salaries.  - I feel like the Lakers and Pacers in particular trade their first selections for some veteran role players."
Celtics goofed it by trading Kemba walker and a 1st  this off-season instead of trading him at the deadline next offseason. Feel like Kemba would rehab a full offseason increasing his value progressively therefore getting more value than Al and Moses brown
"you could join Celtics Nation, we got 17 rings but that's the past and also people get mad when I bring that up since they were won back in the day but anyway  currently we have one of the best young duos in the NBA, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Both 25+ PPG scorers with multiple playoff series wins under their belts. As well as these guys, you'll surely love rooting for   Marcus Smart, the heart &amp; Soul of the team who wears his heart on his sleeve and dives for every loose ball.   Al Horford, our steady veteran presence.   Payton Pritchard &amp; Aaron Nesmith, our two terrific sophomore players who can shoot the lights out and make tons of hustle plays    Rob ""Timelord"" Williams, he does cool dunks and blocks and it's awesome  Tacko Fall, he's 7'5 lol(or 228.6 cm)  as well as many other players such as Romeo Langford, Evan Fournier, Carsen Edwards, Grant Williams, Jesusemilore ""Semi"" Talibejesu Ojeleye, Tristan Thompson, Moses Brown, and so many more.   We also have fans who are super passionate about the game and even once cheered ""Let's Go Celtics!"" for 5 minutes even though we were down by 20 in a playoff game, because that is Celtic Pride.   I can fill you in more on the lore of the team if you want, there's a lot though, we're a very historic franchise"
It must be a move to get Moses Brown and move on from an injured Kemba (who has 1+1 player option deal). Horford now has one full year and nom-gyaranteed season.
"Celtics made out LIKE bandits here. It’s not about Horford, but Moses Brown."
Moses brown.
"kemba was garbage in the playoffs, only played like half the regular season, and we got moses brown. plus Als contract is only like $14mil after next year if we don’t make the finals i like kemba but im not upset about this trade"
Moses brown was too old for presti
"The fuck? This trade is trash for the Celtics? Was Kemba that much of a liability that this is the best they can do? Al Horford is another year older. He's 35. Moses Brown is a decent prospect, but Celtics already have Robert Williams who was finally starting to develop at the tail end of the season. You give up the 16th pick in a deep draft. Someone please explain what the fuck is going on?"
"Eh, kembas only going to continue to get washed, and Moses Brown has insane potential on one of the most team friendly deals. I mean clearly OKC is winning this right now, but kembas value will only get lower"
I’m surprised Presti gave up Moses Brown. He showed a lot of promise on defense and rebounding. Great addition for Boston
"Hahahahahahaha they signed that contract two years ago and had to give up the 16th overall to off load it and turned it into Horford, Moses Brown and a second. Watch Kemba get healthy and perform great in OKC."
Moses Brown might surprise some people on a bigger stage!
This makes no sense imo. Getting Kemba still does not make them a playoff team in my opinion and they lose a key need in a big man with Moses Brown.
Moses brown is the best player in this deal
Moses brown is actually promising though I think
This was not something I expected to wake up to.  Honestly I’m excited about Moses Brown. Haven’t watched him a lot but he was a monster against us. Gobbled up a fuck ton of rebounds
"OKC fans, wasn’t Moses brown actually promising?"
