"Some very slim chances that Clippers wins this without him. They heavily relied on him to clutch it past Luka Donricks.

I would love to know why Carlisle had 7'3 Porzingus standing at the perimeter the whole game while the Clippers were defending the Mavs w/Marcus Morris Sr. as their tallest player for large parts of the game. Boban &amp; Porzingus in the game being guarded by 6'8 guys &amp; very few post-ups were called to take advantage of this mismatch. Shit blew my fuckin mind.

And Lukas other son Marcus Morris Sr
"&gt; he’s playing far far superior defense      I would not say it's ""far"" superior.        Here are the defensive numbers for Jokic against players he guarded for more than 5 minutes.    Kanter - 40% (2-5)     Lillard - 46% (12-26)      Nurkic - 41% (12-29)       Average - 43% (26-60)       For Kawhi...     Tim Hardaway Jr - 52.9% (9-17)      Maxi Kleber - 75% (3-4)     Luka Doncic - 38% (9-24)       Kristaps Porzingis - 46% (5-11)      Dorian Finney Smith - 17% (1-6)       Average - 38% (27-72)  For Luka...      Reggie Jackson - 67% (6-9)      Rajon Rondo - 17% (1-6)     Paul George - 29% (2-7)    Nicholas Batum - 38% (3-8)     Marcus Morris Sr - 33% (3-9)     Kawhi Leonard - 50% (7-14)       Average - 42% (22-53)       They are all terrific. Yes, Kawhi has been better on that end. But it's not ""far far"" superior.      &gt; while getting far more attention from the defense than harden/Durant      If we're using this argument, then what about Luka? His three main defenders have been Kawhi (18m), PG (13m), and Batum (13m).     Kawhi's main defender? Maxi Kleber (29m) followed by Dorian Finney-Smith (20m). There's no question Luka has been facing far better defenders.      &gt; against the the pacers in the first round.      You mean the 48-win Pacers? I think there's a difference between a team that's 2 wins from 50 versus a team that's 2 wins from 40."

Can we plz all agree that LeBron is a dirty player? Any other player that’s done as much as him would be called dirty repeatedly. He’s done more dirty plays than Marcus Morris Sr. Lol
"Lakers: missed LeBron, AD, and Shroder for significant time.  Clippers: missed PG and Kawhi for a combined 38 games, before including 31 missed from Ibaka, 35 from Pat Bev, 15 from Marcus Morris Sr. etc.  Nuggets: Murray missed 24 games, Monte Morris missed 25, Dozier missed 22, Millsap missed 15, MPJ missed 11.  The only guys who DIDNT miss double digit games are Jokic.  Lastly, Blazers: Nurk missed 35 games, CJ McCollum missed 25.  Besides Dame, those are practically their only relevant players.  Glad you can talk shit in a 5+ month old deleted thread, when you didn't even comment on it initially.  Real impressive"
"Bron, KD, and the best shooter in the league Marcus Morris Sr. (Just ask him, he'll tell ya lol)"
Even I will take advice from Marcus Morris Sr.
"Yeah unlike Marcus ""Luka with female tendencies Doncic Jr"" Morris Sr"
"That's ***Marcus Morris, Sr*** to you there, buddy"
"&gt;Because just having Kawhi and PG is making a killing in ticket sales and branding.  Is it?  Because Clippers playoff tickets could be had for as little as $30 for game 1.  Not sure how game 2 sales went.  Clippers have no choice but to run it back.  They are well over the cap, so they can't sign any free agents except for vets.  If they try to trade PG it will likely be for cents on the dollar.  And beside, the problem isn't even PG, the problem is Pat ""trick ya'll"" Beverly, Marcus ""Jr"" Morris Sr, and Luke ""DNP"" Kennard.  Nobody wants those trash role players and their trash contracts (Beverly is expiring)."

Marcus Morris Sr. and Beverley should not be starters on any NBA team much less a playoff team.

Definitely. You can see how well it worked for Kennard and Marcus Morris Sr.

Knicks legend Marcus Morris Sr.
"""Good"" is being generous to describe Marcus Morris Sr."
"&gt; I don't think the Clippers have a realistic shot at DeRozan.  Terence Mann, Marcus Morris Sr., Keon Johnson and BJ Boston. Clips can dump a lot of contracts too, to go below the apron.  &gt; Both the Lakers and Clippers are gonna be way over the apron Spurs can absorb a lot of contracts in a trade. It will come down to what the teams will be offering, so Spurs would agree and take those contracts."
Maybe they ought to trade for  Nicolas Batum  Patrick Beverley  Amir Coffey  DeMarcus Cousins  Yogi Ferrell  Paul George  Serge Ibaka  Reggie Jackson  Keon Johnson  Luke Kennard  Kawhi Leonard  Terance Mann  Marcus Morris Sr.  Daniel Oturu  Patrick Patterson  Jason Preston  Rajon Rondo  Jay Scrubb  Ivica Zubac
"If they don’t bring them back, then they have zero chance of bringing back:  Nicolas Batum  Patrick Beverley  Amir Coffey  DeMarcus Cousins  Yogi Ferrell  Paul George  Serge Ibaka  Reggie Jackson  Keon Johnson  Luke Kennard  Kawhi Leonard  Terance Mann  Marcus Morris Sr.  Daniel Oturu  Patrick Patterson  Jason Preston  Rajon Rondo  Jay Scrubb  Ivica Zubac"

They should bring back  Nicolas Batum  Patrick Beverley  Amir Coffey  DeMarcus Cousins  Yogi Ferrell  Paul George  Serge Ibaka  Reggie Jackson  Keon Johnson  Luke Kennard  Kawhi Leonard  Terance Mann  Marcus Morris Sr.  Daniel Oturu  Patrick Patterson  Jason Preston  Rajon Rondo  Jay Scrubb  Ivica Zubac

"""Tim Hardaway Sr."" I can live with, but someone like Marcus Morris having a baby and then calling himself Sr. is wack"
we need to save tobi from this hell. would the sixers be interested in a lightly used marcus morris sr?
"I'm only impressed when you get to the III. It gets exponentially better from N/A -&gt; Sr. --&gt; III --&gt; X   but then loses all marginal gains after 10  edit - Till you hit 100, because then your numeral just looks like your position in the lineup (Marcus Morris C)"
"I feel like Marcus Morris doing that is putting some unbelievable pressure on his kid to make it to the league too.  ""I didn't put Sr. on the back of my jersey for you to dick around on your PS5, now go shoot some low percentage midrange shots in the driveway!"""
"I hate that the NBA allowed Jr and Sr to go on the backs of jerseys. It’s pointless. “Oh that’s Marcus Morris Sr, and not 3 year old Marcus Morris Jr out there on the court? Glad I read the back of his jersey or else I’d be confused.”"
"The Clippers certainly did. Not “any chance they got” but enough for it to be notable. It wasn’t just my eye test either. It got explicitly mentioned in the article from the athletic previewing the bucks/Suns finals:  &gt; Who’s guarding Khris Middleton? No matter who it is — Mikal Bridges likely — the Bucks would be smart to hunt Booker like the Clippers did. Marcus Morris Sr. was cooking in the mid-post against Booker. The Clippers shot 51 of 96 when Booker was defending. That 53.1 percent shooting was 6.2 percent higher than their collective average. No Suns player defended more Clippers attempts than Booker, by design."
We also missed out on ibaka on the first road game and marcus morris sr for both of the portland games. I think all 3 last season add up to 49ppg  so we’re missing out on a shit ton of fire power and still raw dogged them
