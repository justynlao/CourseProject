"This used to be the same with De'Aaron Fox, he used to get zero calls till this year the refs started giving him calls for contact. Maybe Luka has to play another year till the refs give him calls."
Too many guards in the West. De'Aaron Fox is at least 3 players back from making all-star.
"Love how on the recent De'Aaron Fox Allstar thread someone mentioned he wouldn't even be mentioned as a snub, and here we are."
De'Aaron Fox is who De'Aaron Fox thinks he is.

Holy fuck the Pelicans are bad. Getting outscored by De'Aaron Fox in a 4th quarter is inexcusable from Ingram and Zion. What the fuck.   They need to get better. Fast.
De'Aaron Fox.
De'Aaron Fox is a bad bad man

Other way around. Nobody on here says shit about him or the Kings. De'Aaron Fox is very underrated in my opinion
De'Aaron Fox
We're rebuiding around ~~Kevin Martin~~ ~~Tyreke Evans~~ ~~Demarcus Cousins~~ ~~Buddy Hield~~ De'Aaron Fox!
De'Aaron Fox? Yeah he's not a max player imo
De'Aaron Fox
"Well, De'Aaron Fox made the jump in year two where Lonzo Ball didn't. Not saying that means you give up on Lonzo, but Fox had a similar first year and then made the jump the next year. Lonzo didn't.   You're not wrong that Lonzo has had to deal with forces that were outside his control like the trade and some injury issues, but at the same time I don't think I'd sum it up to not having the opportunities. He had chances to prove he'd be an asset to commit to and he just didn't take advantage. Many players get much less opportunity he had."
Perhaps you could say this is who De'Aaron Fox thinks he is?
"1st time All Stars should be De'Aaron Fox, Zion Williamson, Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Julius Randle, Zach Lavine in no particular order off the top of my head"
"Lol, I remember that comment ""Ja Morant is who De'aaron Fox wishes he was""  No knock on Ja, he's fantastic and will probably have a better career than Fox but man, Fox is still a beast"
He should b called Big De'Aaron Fox or Lockdown De'Aaron Fox
The real question here should be:  Will De'Aaron Fox's son be called De'De'Aaron Fox?
"De'Aaron Fox played 39 minutes of excellent basketball and was +18. Unfortunately, the other 9 minutes at the point guard position were given to a mostly sentient chair, who somehow managed to be -23 during that span."
But who's gonna eat De'Aaron Fox ass?
De'Aaron Fox or Myles Turner - both really young players who are constantly overlooked.
"Probably the kings... they got De'Aaron, Hield, uh... Fox... Bagley?"

"He's no De'Aaron Fox, that's for sure."
"Lamelo's numbers aren't concerning at all, low 40s from the field+low 50s true shooting is pretty standard for rookies in a lead ball handling role. Guys like Trae Young, Collin Sexton, De'Aaron Fox all had numbers in that range their rookie year. Learning how to play against NBA level physicality, draw fouls, and finish against hyper athletic shot blockers comes with time, and struggling at those things initially is just par for the course."
Tyrese Maxey really reminds of De'aaron Fox in so many ways. Explosive speed good floater.

Aaron Fox and De'Aaron Fox lol
"Getting to the line is a legitimate skill and can be the difference between a good and a great player. It requires body control, good handles, and the ability to read the defense. It's basically why D'Angelo Russell is an average player while De'Aaron Fox is very good, despite having similar skillsets (defense and athleticism notwithstanding)"

"Yeah, De'Aaron Fox was really bad his rookie year, and he's been on an all-star trajectory since."
In my opinion:  1 - Devin Booker  2 - Trae Young  3 - Jaylen Brown   4 - Donovan Mitchell   5 - Ja Morant  6 - Jamal Murray  7 - De'Aaron Fox
De'Aaron Fox doesnt belong in that group
"For what it's worth Brown was among the next two players I would have listed. Frankly if you believe that Siakam's bad spell of form is more than that you can even put him on the back-end of the top 30.  As mentioned in another reply Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Kemba Walker, Jrue Holiday, Russel Westbrook, Ja Morant, De'Aaron Fox, Kyle Lowry and CJ McCollum would be included in my 30-40 range. range."
"I never subscribed to this claim. Sabonis was a deserved all-star last season. That being said he's got to keep on performing to really establish himself in the top30. There's some big names in the top 30-40 range.  Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Kemba Walker, Jrue Holiday, Russel Westbrook, Ja Morant, De'Aaron Fox, Kyle Lowry, CJ McCollum and others."
"I'm kind of worried that De'Aaron Fox might be this same way to an extent.  2 years ago he looked like a can't miss star, but then he just hasn't really improved all that much since.  I think he will be a good player for a long time, but I'm not so sure he is going to continue to improve an become a star like people thought."

"For the uninitiated, the Kings roster. (Positions could be debated)  PG: De'Aaron Fox | Tyrese Haliburton | Jahmi'us Ramsey  SG: Buddy Hield | Cory Joseph | Kyle Guy | Justin James  SF: Harrison Barnes | DaQuan Jeffries  PF: Marvin Bagley III | Jabari Parker | Nemanja Bjelica  C: Richaun Holmes | Hassan Whiteside (Out) | Norvel Pelle  Whiteside's out for Health and Safety Protocols. Luke Walton's not a good coach, but how the heck is he supposed to win games with that roster? Fox is good, Hield will get his, Barnes is solid, and Bagley/Holmes are not terrible but they're below-average starters. Somehow though, their bench is even more dire. How many of these guys would even start on a good team? I think it's a bit extreme, but only Fox and Hield/Barnes could start for certain teams. I don't think anyone past Bagley/Holmes/Haliburton would crack a rotation, and some of those (like Bagley) would even be questionable."
De'Aaron Fox in his prime maybe?
"C: Nikola Jokic / Joel Embiid  PF: LeBron James / Giannis   SF: Kawhi Leonard / Kevin Durant  SG: Luka Dončić  / Bradley Beal  PG: Steph Curry / Trae Young  6: Damian Lillard / Nikola Vucevic  7: DeMar DeRozan / Jaylen Brown  8: Christian Wood / Kyle Lowry  9: SGA / Zach LaVine  10: Chris Paul / Sexton  11: Donovan Mitchell / Jerami Grant   12: De'Aaron Fox / Sabonis  13: Zion Williamson / Randle  14: Ja Morant / Jimmy Butler  15: KAT / Hayward  &amp;#x200B;  All things considered it's not a horrible idea, each team has an All Star caliber player on it's roster, but the problem is injuries and all star players underperforming . Like in Miami's case, Butler is their clear cut all star but he's missed games, does Tyler Herro become their representative? Same thing with Minnesota who KAT is their best player, but Anthony Edwards has played more. Then you start having All Star nods becoming meaningless as guys like Herro would have All Star nods over James Harden."
All advanced metrics abound with anomalies.  Montrezl and Jarrett Allen are 13th and 14th in the league in win shares.  De'Aaron fox is 140.  *You can't treat any one metric as gospel.*

"Disagree. Shai, De'Aaron, Demar, Middleton, Sabonis, and Young are probably not good enough to be all stars. Neither is CJ or Wood.  Other ones have arguments but it is OK to have snubs. The spots being limited is what gives them value. If you expand them the value is reduced and will eventually cause you to re-examine who might be considered a ""snub"" from the reduced-value all-star selection.  Finally, the strongest argument yet against expanding the selection is that it just doesn't make sense to have a rotation of more than ten guys on each team. It will just take away time from players we actually want to see, in order to what? Get De'Aron Fox and Trae Young minutes?"
fox has 8 dunks this season out of all 112 attempts he's had at the rim.   you need to watch the kings play. de'aaron fox is having a historic season at the rim as a guard. 80% on 4 attempts a game. it's ridiculous. he has a lot of acrobatic finishes as well.   fox is also statistically better in general at the rim for the last few seasons.

"But he gets to the line so little that his sample size is ridiculously low. His free throw totals by season are 71, 48, 76. He took 195 free throws his first three seasons. De'Aaron Fox took that many his first season. Tatum took 213 his first season. He has shot 27 free throws this season. Like can we actually say he is a 74% free throw shooter when he has taken 27 free throws this season?   The reason I feel he didn't drive when he was on the Lakers was four things. He is passive, his handle is mediocre for a point guard, his layup package is terrible (THT has a better layup package), he could never run a half court offense. He might have improved in these areas since he was on the Lakers for all I know though."
"I don't know, maybe stop trying to force feed us Pelican and Mavs games? I mean even if you are promoting Zion and Luka, watching them lose a lot kinda takes the shine off the apple. Meanwhile casuals know absolutely nothing about De'Aaron Fox who is pretty great. Maybe mix in more Hornets. You could never go wrong with more Blazers games either."
Then why did Alex Caruso get more votes than De'Aaron Fox lmao  If Dame was on the Lakers he'd be setting records in fan votes.
"It's the Kings. No one cares about the Kings. Despite how aggressive De'Aaron Fox drives to the hoop, he rarely get free throws.   Refs' respect have to be earned before they look your way, sad but it is the fact of today's NBA officiating."

De'aaron fox is so underrated. Hopefully you guys make him an Allstar this year.
Big markets have a complex about their players. Like if De'aaron Fox played for the Lakers he'd be an all star lock and would have a signature shoe.
Hot take: De'aaron Fox is the best young PG (under 24) not named Luka  MVP:  1. Embiid (needs to stop missing 20% of games or I'll drop him down) 2. Lebron 3. Jokic
"De'aaron Fox is the easy and correct answer, but I do love me some Haliburton."
More proof De'Aaron Fox is an all-star
"Everyone plays Pelicans then gets into a crazy hot streak the next few games. De'Aaron Fox, Zach Lavine, now KP. lol"
"I made a De'Aaron Fox mixtape to Lil Tjay's Calling My Phone, check it out if you want!   [https://youtu.be/K30QA0X8MiI](https://youtu.be/K30QA0X8MiI)"
"Simmons has issues guarding quick waterbug-type players. Terry Rozier, De'Aaron Fox, Dame. Just really hard to deal with Dame's change of pace.  When it comes to the waning minutes, Doc's best bet is probably swapping Curry for Thybulle like he's been doing recently. But Thybulle can get overly aggressive, and I have a bad feeling Dame is gonna frustrate people with some trips to the line."
De'Aaron Fox already has those
How does fucking Alex Caruso have more votes than  De'Aaron Fox? The fuck?
He's having a good year but I hope they give it to someone young like De'Aaron Fox or Zion Williamson. CP3 had made enough all star appearances lol
Mike Conley or De'Aaron Fox. Both cases would be a snub imo it's unfortunate.
The West is too competitive - especially when talking about the guards. De'aaron fox will be the biggest snub out of the guards
"1. De'aaron Fox 2. LaMelo 3. JJJ 4. Herro 5. RJ  &amp;#x200B;  You could put JJJ over LaMelo and I wouldn't mind. I had some trouble with that one mainly, but ultimately it came down to positional value"
Here are all the guys people will want to mention ranked in my opinion. Lot of these guys are really close to one another. Especially in the range of Holiday to Murray.  1. Stephen Curry 2. James Harden 3. Damian Lillard 4. Kyrie Irving 5. Bradley Beal 6. Chris Paul 7. Trae Young 8. Demar Derozan 9. Kyle Lowry 10. Donovan Mitchell 11. Devin Booker 12. CJ McCollum 13. Jrue Holiday 14.

De'Aaron Fox is legit
"Jaylen Brown &amp; Devin Booker are ahead of  several of the guys on your list so let's include them.  I'd also say SGA, CJ McCollum, Siakam, Kyrie, Gordon Hayward, Ingram and Middleton are all better.  Julius Randle &amp; Ben Simmons are probably where the line is, so that's another 8-11 guys at least (I am probably forgetting some).  It's interesting to name the guys, something we almost never do, as a result there are 12 top 5 players in the league at any given time.  EDIT: I forgot De'Aaron Fox, Ja Morant and Zach Lavine, would take them over Murray comfortably."
"I'll give it a stab.  Jaylen Brown,  Zion Williamson, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, KAT (if healthy), Ja Morant, Kyrie, De'Aaron Fox (arguable, but I would say so), Brandon Ingram (same thing), McCollum until he got injured (this season),  Shai (I'm high on Shai), Maybe Kemba, Probably Vucevic, Lavine."
"De'Aaron Fox brought this up in his interview with Zach Lowe. If someone catches it during All-Star weekend, you have to contact trace a good 20 teams. The entire schedule gets crocked. Whereas regular games shouldn't affect more than a couple of teams."
De'Aaron Fox reminds me more of Westbrook but really there's nobody like Westbrook
"I don't think most people think Devin Booker should be an all-star this year. Donovan Mitchell is the best player on the #1 team in the NBA right now, so that adds a lot more weight than just comparing their stats. De'Aaron Fox could be an all-star this year, but it also wouldn't be crazy if he wasn't, he's on the bubble imo."

"But don't you think that has to do with personnel? It's easier to process the game when you have more capable guys like De'Aaron Fox, Buddy Hield and Harrison Barnes playing alongside of you."
De'Aaron Fox is who Dennis Smith Jr. thinks he is.
De'Aaron Fox
"I know this is basically a click bate article but this doesn't make logical sense.     I could argue pretty strongly that Luka and Trae literally last year as sophomores had 2 historically good seasons. So much so that you could argue, 90% of the people on this list at there *very best* will never have an individual season as good as they just had individually.      So someone is going to really have to explain to me how De'Aaron Fox is higher on this list then Trae Young."

He could've been a taller longer slightly less skilled De'Aaron Fox that's way better on defense which would've been incredible for this team.
"You're right I am, but I still stand by they'd have much more success. I'd take his ""De'Aaron Fox year"" + MVP Rose over the last 4 years of Simmons.  For instance, replace Simmons w/ MVP Rose in 2018, the Sixers win the title."

"Everyone is so quick to jump the gun and be worried about losing Tatum and Brown, when they are 23 and 24. Is Miami going to be worried about losing Bam if they lose in the first or second round this year? Is Sacramento worried about losing De'Aaron Fox since he was also just signed to a 5-year max and they can't put help around him? Is Ben Simmons going to demand a trade if they don't make the finals yet again? Same for Donovan Mitchell if the Jazz don't win this year? What about Sabonis or Devin Booker?  All of these guys are the same ages as Tatum/Brown, but I never hear this narrative about them, except maybe Simmons in trade rumors, and they all haven't won a championship yet either.  Everyone said the same thing about Giannis and then he stayed in Milwaukee. I understand where it comes from when it does happen and guys want out, I just don't know what kind of power they have with 3/4 years left on $24M+ deals where any trade to match salary would send them to a bad team or a contender would be losing key pieces to match salary and they'd be in the exact same spot in a different location. Celtics aren't buying them out lol.  They have literally no leverage to demand a trade this offseason and if you make the playoffs 4 years in a row and made it to the ECF in 2/4 of those where you're the main guy(s), why would you want out that bad?  James Harden spent 8 years in Houston. KD spent 9 in OKC. LeBron stuck it out with the Cavs for 7. Paul George in Indiana for 7. AD with the Pelicans for 7. Melo with Denver for 7.5. Lillard has spent his entire career with Portland. Embiid has played 5 season with the Sixers and there's no mention of him jumping ship. Jokic 6 years in Denver and no one is saying he's going to demand a trade. None of these guys won championships with those teams.  Why does everyone act like their window is closed now or very soon after just 4 years when people act like their help (Kemba Walker, 4 time All-Star, coming back from injury/surgery. Marcus Smart, 1st team All Defense, coming back from injury. Evan Fournier, 18 PPG scoring option, 2 games in) is no help at all? This narrative is nonsense."
"Well deserved by Jokic, but shoutout to De'Aaron Fox for what he did in March as well: 29.3 points, 6.6 assists, and 3.6 rebounds over 14 games to lead the Kings to a 9-5 record and an outside chance at the play-in."

"Yeah that's a good point. The MVP fundamentally changed people's expectations of him in a way that isn't really fair. Let's be real, a point guard who can't shoot well is not winning a ring any time soon. But people started to compare him to guys like Harden and Steph which just caused a whole lot of toxic discourse around a guy who realistically, in terms of playoffs basketball impact, in terms of playing with and against teams of the highest level, is closer to De'Aaron Fox than he is to Steph Curry.   I think more people would appreciate him for who he is if he just continued being that electrifying player in OKC that no one really had significant expectations for."

De'Aaron Fox &amp; Keldon Johnson are two of my favorites
Lebron actually locked down guards especially Rose in that infamous Bulls series. Even now for the Lakers he will guard guys like De'Aaron Fox and Kendrick Nunn because no one else on the Lakers can.  Draymond and Lebron both can absolutely get around screens. They just don't usually guard those type of guys but when they've done it they've done it well.

"I think most NBA guys are too tall and not fast enough.  NFL receives have to either be insanely fast, agile or strong.  NBA guys don't train like NFL receivers, so aside from burners like John Wall, De'Aaron Fox, or a young Westbrook, they'd just get bullied at the line."
"Tanking isn't a guarantee of turning the franchise around, the Magic know that from drafting Mario Hezonja 5th overall and Mo Bamba 6th overall. As a fan I'm content being mediocre then overpaying for a star FA when the team's cap and FA opportunity line up (like Charlotte did with Hayward).  Ask Sacramento (just for example) if it's a good idea for a small market to completely depend on the draft. For every top 10 pick that turns into De'Aaron Fox there's many more who turn into Marvin Bagley, Marquese Chriss, Willie Caulie-Stein, etc."
"Appreciate the post, it's quality content!  One thing I have to point out is the years you have used to get your figures.

As an example, most of the following players will be a top 2 player on a playoff team before their career finishes: Trae Young, Brendan Ingram, De'Aaron Fox, Kristaps and Jaren Jackson Jr. I'm sure their are others, these were just the first few that came to mind  Again, awesome post, I really enjoyed it, and would love to see how it looks decade by decade."
"&gt;This is in part a direct result of the premium on shooting: the guys who are great drivers and finishers but can't shoot from deep don't really have a place in the league anymore.  That's just not true didn't we all just witness [Jimmy Butler put up 40 in the Finals without making a 3.](https://www.nba.com/news/jimmy-butler-triple-double-finals) Jimmy was the first player to do that since Shaq did it in 2002. I would argue that there are definitely places for those guys in the league, guys like Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, and Giannis Antetokounmpo have the ability to score but they usually just look and play differently in this area. In this area, those guys have to be a physically dominant point forward type players and are be able to play bully ball in the post and run freely and physically dominant opponents in the halfcourt, or else it's much harder for them to exist. Zion is another good example of this because although he can sometimes shoot the three, he prefers to score mostly in the paint. Another key point to this is being a good free-throw shooter which why I would argue Jimmy Butler is the most prominent and best prototype of this type of scorer in the NBA.   The other type of player that can thrive nowadays without being able to shoot from deep, is a guard, particularly one who is either incredibly athletic and/or skilled whose best skill is usually their vision and passing rather than their ability to score (although most of these players can and do have multiple ways to score but are generally pass-first point guards). Guards like De'Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, Russell Westbrook, Luka Doncic, and to a lesser extent Demar Derozan. As I mentioned before these guards with the exception of Derozan (although he has become a much better playmaker in his Spurs era) are pass-first guards which means that they look to make plays and find their teammates before scoring. It's also to note that when most of these guards do score they score either in the paint or the mid-range because they either have the physical strength like Luka does to body other players and easily get to the paint or the free-throw line or they have the handles, athleticism and quickness like Fox, Morant, and Westbrook do to blow pass their opponents to finish at the rim."
And that is why you don't try that in a real NBA game.  Unless you're De'Aaron Fox.
"De'Aaron Fox, possibly."
"3 for the Kings: De'Aaron Fox, Boogie, and Rudy Gay. 4 if you want to count Kosta Koufos"
De'Aaron Fox
"For all of these cases there was a pretty clear reason why the hate started coming in:  * KD left the Thunder to sign with the 73-win Warriors, i.e. the ""biggest snake move ever"". His move was 10x worse than LeBron's (and also showed that KD is a hypocrite too) so he should've expected it * Curry haters are honestly mostly just general Warriors haters who hated the fact that KD signed with the Warriors and effectively broke the league for the next 3-4 years. Steph, Klay, and the Warriors were pretty likeable from 2014-16 and didn't get too much hate (except when the debate between them and the '96 Bulls happened because of the 73 wins, but that was more of ""you're not the GOAT, you're only 2nd behind the GOAT"" criticism than actual hate in substance I think) * Giannis got laughs because a) there's a lot of immature NBA fans and b) not to hammer Miami, but the 2019 Heat (49-win pace) were the worst team a perceived contender has lost to in a playoff series since arguably the 2007 Mavs lost to the We Believe the Warriors in the first round. The only other possibility is the 2010 Cavs loss to the Celtics, but at least those Celtics had the pedigree of being champions in 2008. When that happens there's going to be some reaction  As for the Knicks, they'll start getting the hate when they do some typical big market flex to move up to real title contenders, something like if let's say De'Aaron Fox forces a trade to the Knicks (or the Knicks just outright sign him in FA). That's basically the point where every big market team gets hated on"
De'Aaron Fox
"I think Leon tries to throw both Mavs picks at someone like De'Aaron Fox; a young PG who fits the thibs mold (athletic, drive and dish type game). This Knicks FO has been around the league long enough to know how the cap works. If they plan on keeping this core (Julius, RJ, Quick, Mitch), this offseason and next are the last chances the Knicks have to add outside talent before extensions use up all the cap space"
"Simple, because I'm a Phoenix Suns fan and I expect the worst.   (By the way, we beat the defending champs with Lebron playing and an ejected Devin Booker, so it's not like it's completely hopeless. And that same ""fully healthy"" Lakers team lost to a Sacramento Kings team without De'Aaron Fox or Harrison Barnes, so calm down a little bit on your hype-up of them.)"
"De'Aaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Golden 1 Center"
"I'm not exactly watching the Grizzlies every night but I think that's a very optimistic view of his progress so far. Point guard is probably the most competitive position in the league, De'Aaron Fox (whom I love as a player) has never made an all-star game and I think it's hard to argue Morant is on a definitively higher trajectory than Fox."
AHT AHT De'Aaron Fox  and rj barrett need to be  on hear they don’t get ANY  love  and you spot on with og Anunoby he the truth
"I love De'Aaron Fox (duh, if you look at my flair), and I think he honestly gets disrespected more than almost any other player at his level.  ... But Westbrook is on a completely different level, always has been. I think Fox has top 5 guard potential in a couple years, but right now he has lots to improve on and Westbrook is *and has been* a top 5 guard for like... 4+ years.  Nobody gets disrespected like Westbrook, and I have no idea why. Cuz he's only really ever been on bad-to-mediocre teams and thus doesn't have much playoff success? That's just bad luck. He seems like an extremely genuine dude and an excellent teammate, so idk where people find so much energy to hate on him."
~~Ja Morant~~ CoJo is who ~~De'Aaron Fox~~ Ja Morant thinks he is.
"Here's some remarks on probably the most unremarkable game of the NBA season (or NBA history, you decide). But hey, I wrote all this shit down so I figured I'd share:  * Early on when Rudy is in the action on D he's comfortable straying away from Poeltl to contest shots. First possession he alters an elbow jumper from Vassell then next possession he leaves Jake Puddle to contest Keldon Johnson's layup. This Spurs bunch doesn't have great passing so they're not looking for JP on lobs or quick interior passes to punish Gobert * CAVEAT TO THE ABOVE POINT: two straight possessions the Jazz guard the Murray/JP PnR with two guys; Gobert stunts to Murray both times and Murray finds JP for two buckets * Trent Forrest Good: puts Vassell in jail on the PnR and hits a nice floater. Trent Forrest Bad: leaves his feet contesting a pretty weak Murray pump fake (on replay Murray may have even been looking to pass?) and fouls the shit out of him. Trent Forrest Good: slips by Murray in screen-the-screener action that Quin loves and gets a wide open dunk (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""That's a big time NBA move."" Uhh, no Craig, the Spurs fucked up the coverage and were all yelling at each other after the play) * Wooofff Rudy Gay just got flat-footed by Bojan on an iso and beat to the rim. Bojan isn't De'Aaron Fox, folks. Maybe it's legs because the Spurs have had a hellacious schedule but that looked pretty bad * Spurs get a couple buckets in the first with Lonnie Walker going at Clarkson. The Jazz need JC in the playoffs but he's going to get attacked, he's dying on every screen (even small/small screens). At least JC is hitting the floater though, 5/6 early for 12 1st quarter points * Dieng is getting cooked in PnR. Like Jordan Clarkson [cooking a grilled cheese cooked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nreFpbJXt30). He gives up a wide open lane to Ingles off a Gobert screen then on a Forrest/Gobert PnR he doubles Forrest (???) and it's an easy lob to Gobert. He's -14 in 6 minutes. Jazz up 22. Cue Drew Eubanks * Oni kinda looks like a guy who can be a good on-ball defender but he's not particularly quick or long or strong or cerebral. Granted he's usually guarding some of the bigger threats. And on offense he'll hit the open corner three and get some offensive rebounds but that's basically it. If he doesn't add something to his game this summer I don't see him sticking. He's like Royce but slightly worse at everything * Pop may be throwing in the towel a bit early tonight? Poeltl hasn't been in since his first stint, logging just seven first half minutes. After going down 22 they're running with Walker/Eubanks/Tre Jones/Bates-Diop/Samanic to close the 2nd quarter. That is, uhh, not an inspiring group. But I don't blame him, the Spurs have been ahead of the game with resting players and I'm sure Pop is trying to save his guys for winnable games and the play-in * Let's talk about Joe Ingles. He's running the point when he's out there w/ Conley/Mitchell out. Everyone says he's ""crafty"" which is kinda just a bullshit lazy white-guy characterization. To me crafty means you have multiple moves, countermoves, variations on those countermoves. LaMelo Ball is crafty, Ja Morant is crafty, Luka Doncic is crafty. Joe has exactly two moves in the PnR: (1) drive left, pass fake and shoot (2) drive left and dump off pass to Gobert/Favors. He's just **really** good at those two moves. Which is hilarious because, as someone who watches the Jazz all the time, you see it coming from a mile away. But Joe times that pass or pass fake so perfectly that it works more often than not * Jazz up 24 at the half. Bojan leading the way with 19 points on 8/9 from the field and getting to the rim at ease against this not-your-father's-Spurs Defense * Addendum to Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: (3) a third defender comes over in the PnR to tag Gobert and Joe whips a lefty pass to the corner for a Bojan three * Watching Royce O'Neale is kinda hilarious because he makes like four buckets a game but he celebrates each one like a cocky eighth grader. He finishes on Poeltl with an admittedly nice lefty scoop shot and looks at his hand as he runs back, then makes a WIDE open three and points to the corner camera while backpedaling. But hey, if you play a thankless role guarding the best guys and being the fifth option on Offensive like O'Neale, go ahead and celebrate big guy * Self-Aggrandizing-Victory-Lap on Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: Joe does move (1) and gets an and-1 on Poeltl (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""CRAFTY!"") * All of the sudden the Jazz are up 36 midway through the third quarter and this game is over. Friendly reminder that there are too many games in the NBA season and to get your COVID Vaccine. Yours truly will now be tuning out and YouTubing Jordan Clarkson cooking grilled cheese"

"""Did you draft De'aaron fox because you thought he was a fox?"""
Whistling past the graveyard.  You lost a 10 pt lead going into the 4th against a team missing its best player (De'Aaron Fox).  I can't wait to see Steph against Lebron in the play in game.  Steph might go for 50 and Lakers are one and done.
"We're on r/nba, you know there are people who will make that claim seriously.   Also, I was curious myself where Rubio would end up.   By the way, I missed on that list:  * Doncic * Trae Young * Isaiah Thomas * Goran Dragic - 50 * Jrue Holiday * De'Aaron Fox * Lowry * Mugsy Bogues * Avery Johnson * Jason Terry * Calderon * Tinsley * Ty Lawson * Bledsoe - 60 * Rafer Alston  So I think Rubio might actually be top 100 all time, even top 70 all time.  He was a starter in the NBA for 10 years, and he might have gotten a better reputation had he played on some good teams."
"i think he's a PG in the league, great handle, explosive off the pnr, really solid vision  he's in the paint constantly, reminds me a little of De'Aaron Fox"
"Looks good, although I think I'd swap Russ out for maybe a player like De'Aaron Fox and Julius Randle or a player on the rise up. Don't get me wrong I think you're right with Russ being underrated but he's already going to be a HoF candidate."
"Like u/ThatBull_cj noted, you're using possessions/game for 48min here rather than possessions played by these players. Luckily [nba.com has possessions played by each player.](https://go.nba.com/tm0a) Using those and the data above, you have the % of possessions played that each of these players is doubled, below.  1 Luka Doncic (DAL)  **38.4%**  2 Trae Young (ATL)  **37.9%**  3 Damian Lillard (POR)  **32.8%**  4 James Harden (BKN)  **30.8%**  5 Chris Paul (PHX)  **35.2%**  6 Bradley Beal (WAS)  **29.1%**  7 De'Aaron Fox (SAC)  **29.8%**  8 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (OKC)  **31.1%**  9 Ja Morant (MEM)   **31.7%**  10 Stephen Curry (GSW)  **28.9%**"
"here's the really interesting counter-factual: what if the Celtics had never made the Kyrie Irving trade at all?  They'd have gone into the 2017-2018 NBA season with IT/Rozier/Smart/Jaylen/Tatum/Hayward/Horford along with the Nets pick still.  Now fast forward to the offseason prior to the 2018 draft, the Celtics could've made a godfather offer to the Kings of Rozier, Nets Pick, Kings Pick + Grizzlies pick for De'Aaron Fox, giving the Celtics a core of Fox + the Jays + Smart + Timelord.  Alternatively, if the Kings say no then the Celtics just take SGA with the last Nets pick."
pass  would you sell tatum right now hoping to eventually land someone like de'aaron fox?
what if you can trade Randle for a collection of assets that can become De'Aaron Fox in a year or two?  He's a Kentucky guy...
"As far as I know, as long as you've been through it, you're free to do it. Though I'm guessing he didn't haze De'Aaron Fox so much, because he was only a couple of years removed himself when Fox came in, and also, he needed him to pass him the ball."
"Defenders. Idea Zion needs floor spacing is a myth, SVG said it best last week ""If De'Aaron Fox played us every game he would win unanimous league MVP"". Nothing is changing until that end of the court improves substantially."
Ja Morant is who De'Aaron Fox wishes he was.
I have no opinion on the MVP race but if De'Aaron fox wants to go on a 13-0 win streak and average 40/10/10 for the rest of the season or Pascal Siakam wants to turn into a KG/Dirk hybrid that would be fun.
"It depends on how you view untradeable but, in my opinion, untradeable guys are the players who teams don't even listen to trade offers on. If someone called the Warriors and asked ""How much would it take to get Steph,"" the answer would be no. If someone called the Celtics to ask ""How much for Tatum,"" the answer might be Steph or Luka but there are trades out there where the Celtics would be getting too much back to say no.  If we live by ""you can't include 'untradeable' players in an outgoing trade offer,"" then slowly a lot of players join the untradeable club. If you can't offer Steph for Tatum and Tatum becomes untradeable then who could you offer for someone like SGA or De'Aaron Fox?"

Didn't even bother including Ben Simmons or Jayson Tatum because BI isn't in the same convo add those two.  I feel like Ingram doesn't have that 2nd skill that you point to when his shot isn't falling. All of the other guys are able to impact the game outside of just scoring. I feel like the hair trigger answer might be Siakam, but I feel like even his scoring ability has more layers than just contested jumpers.

Mike Conley got an allstar spot over De'Aaron Fox 🙂
Getting outplayed by De'Aaron Fox on both ends of the floor shows Luka's destiny for greatness.
The entire Sacramento Kings roster with De'Aaron Fox and Tyrese Haliburton being given a yearlong vacation.
"I used to hate Amin back in the day, grew to like him and now I can't stand him anymore after shit like this and the De'Aaron Fox shit earlier this year.   He's childish and lame as fuck."
"they lose because their pieces suck. That's pretty much all it is. They go like 3 players deep into their bench and the guys on the roster are BARELY roster-able. The kings probably have the shortest bench in the league.  What's more; Buddy is their highest paid player and he sucks. He doesn't want to be there. He can't create his own shot reliably. He's a 2nd class spot up shooter. If he was in a rookies body he wouldn't get minutes (maybe that's a bit too far). De'Aaron Fox has a promising future but honestly, if he was on the Bulls he would be the 3rd best player. He's not at the level to carry a team. Holmes is young and good, but still gets in foul trouble and has to compete for touches.  Haliburton is sooo much better coming off the bench. He's got a good flow with the bench guys. They actually make some buckets when he is running the offense. When he is on the court with Fox he is primarily parked in the corner or directly out from the top of the key, waiting for a pass for the 3pt shot.   Luke Walton is meh but what OP said is 100% true. The team competes even though they suck. Most other coaches would be having the same trouble + the players would be miserable."

"De'aaron ""Rock Lee"" Fox"
"de'aaron fox has been one of my fave players since he got into the league, and i so wanna see him in the playoffs. i wish he was drafted by the lakers or another org that would actually get to the playoffs. honestly tho i think if the kings didnt fire joeger or at least didnt hire luke they might be in the playoffs rn"
I'm sorry but Shai is not better than De'Aaron Fox. At worst they are equals. Fox is a monster in his own right.
"I don't concede that Simmons is worse and I'd bet I've seen a lot more De'Aaron Fox than you. Fox has the higher PPG, but that's about it. Fox does more perimeter shooting to boost his PPG, but it isn't really efficient enough to help the team win. Simmons has fewer points, but better TS% even with his poor FT and perimeter shooting. Simmons is also better as a rebounder, defender, and in basically all advanced stats.   Simmons also fits our roster better. Our scoring is above average, but our defense is literally one of the worst of all time. Buddy, Haliburton, and Barnes are all strong 3pt shooters who would space the floor for Ben and benefit a ton from his drive-and-kick ability. It'd allow us to play a 3-guard offense the way the 76ers do with Simmons/Curry/Green, but we wouldn't lose size on defense, since Ben can guard SF/PF. We're getting wrecked on defense because our tallest starter is 6'9"" and our second best forward is Moe Harkless.  Long story short, I don't think Fox or Simmons is capable of being the #1 scoring option on a contender, so I'd rather have the guy who's a more versatile two-way player, since it allows a higher likelihood of complementing an MVP-caliber guy.  As for the money, Fox gets 96% as much, so not a super impactful difference when we don't even have one other max-level player yet. 1 less year team control is a little scary, but I'm okay with that tradeoff, since Simmons is a year older with a grown man body and more seasoned with playoff experience. He's more of a win-now move anyway, so the acquisition would be based on the idea we believe Simmons / Hali / Bagley / 2021 1st is a legit future core with quality support players in Hield, Barnes, and Holmes."
-De'Aaron Fox
"If you're looking for a serious answer:   **Price:** CoJo wasn't moving the needle either in a season that was already lost. He is way overpaid at $12.5M next season, so we weren't bringing him back regardless, which would mean eating his \~$2.5M buyout. Wright is under contract next year at $8.5M, so we essentially picked up a veteran backup PG for next season at 1yr/$6M (the net of Wright's deal after CoJo's buyout). That's half the price of CoJo. It's not a huge acquisition, but it's unlikely we'd sign a better backup PG in the offseason for less than $6M, given Sac isn't a free agent destination.  **Fit:** It allows our young guys to play off a real NBA PG when De'Aaron is out, rather than a G-League or 2nd round guy. It takes pressure off Haliburton to immediately step in as the only other playmaker on the team if De'Aaron has any injuries. It also leaves 3 legit guards in our rotation if we trade Buddy, giving us extra flexibility even if we don't use our '21 1st on a guard.  **Picks:** The cost was two 2nds. One was the Lakers '21 2nd, which is starting to improve because of their injuries, but will likely still end up in the 50s where the chances of getting an impact player are like 1 in 100 (seriously, look back at the last 10 years of 50-60 picks if you doubt me). The other was the Kings 2024 2nd, which is far enough out that it's hard to know if it'll be a 30-35 or a 50+. In addition to that reasonable cost, we already have 4 2nd round picks from the last two drafts that we don't play (Jahmius Ramsey, Robert Woodard, Justin James, and Kyle Guy), PLUS we have all our own 1sts &amp; 2nds from '21-23 with a bonus 2nd in '22. We just can't develop all those prospects at once while prioritizing Fox, Hali, Bagley, and the '21 1st. So we have to use the extra picks to add cheap value like Wright."

What would you offer in FRPs for De'Aaron Fox?
"1. Stephen Curry: Literally the reason I got into basketball was Curry during the 2014-15 run. Then at the beginning of 2015-16 I became a massive fan of the Warriors solely cuz of Curry. I still watch almost every Warriors game cuz of Curry, and he is the reason I care about basketball tbh. Watching the 35 ft game winner live is one of my most cherished memories, I literally ran throughout my house screaming for a minute straight when it went in. 2. Kobe Bryant: My dad used to be a Laker fan back in the Magic era and until basically they sucked (not his fault he stopped watching, my mom refused to watch the Lakers get trashed often at some point lol). I could only watch him near the end of the his career, but he was my favorite player back when I didn't know much about basketball. 3. Klay Thompson: I will never forget Game 6 vs OKC, that was one of the greatest performances in NBA history imo. He is the quintissential 3 point shooter imo, his three point shot is the most perfect form I have ever seen. 4. Damian Lillard: Dame is very similar to Curry in play-style. I just love his ""Logo Lillard"" shots and overall clutch-ness. 5. Zach Lavine: Between his athleticism and his shooting, his game is so asthetically pleasing to me. I really hope he and Vuc have a fruitful career together in Chicago and maybe even win a ring, two of my fav players in the league rn. 6. Kyrie Irving: Off the court he is pretty stupid, but his game is super asthetically pleasing imo. His handles are literally insane, I love when he fakes defenders really badly. 7. Ja Morant: His athleticism is INSANE!!! I hope he develops a 3 point shot to improve. 8. Nikola Vučević: Overall as you can probably tell from this list, I'm not a big fan of most forwards/centers. I like Vucevic because he doesn't just play bully ball and flop around in the post like a lot of other players, his game is so smooth imo. 9. Lamelo Ball: The flashiness! His passing is so cool, I hope he blossoms into a superstar. 10. Kemba Walker: I always loved Kemba with the Hornets. I know he wasn't ever particularly efficient, but to me his game is pretty asthetically pleasing as well.  HM: De'Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Kevin Durant, Vince Carter, Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore, Donovan Mitchell, Tony Parker, Pau Gasol, Rajon Rondo, David West, Wilt Chamberlain (or the idea of him, I obv didn't watch him play but the mystery about him is so interesting to me. Also I think he would literally be a god-level player in today's league)  So overall, I love shooters and explosive guards more than any other types of players. I'd love to discuss this more to, if you have any questions feel free to ask!"
"De'Aaron Fox for Ben Simmons, Isaiah Joe/Paul Reed and a first round pick in the 2022 draft. Do the kings accept?"
"De'Aaron Fox for Ben Simmons, Isaiah Joe/Paul Reed and a first round pick in the 2021 draft who says no?"
"So, to be clear, you think the team would do better swapping out Giannis for, say, Nikola Vucevic? Domantis Sabonis? To be fair, you did say 'borderline allstar' so maybe that means not quite an allstar. Gordon Hayward? De'Aaron Fox?  The game came down to a free throw game - so you tell me what non all-star you plug in instead of Giannis to re-do the game that you think will win it."
De'Aaron Fox
"&gt;Yea unfortunately owners don’t have years to waste being a shitty team  This is why I really couldn't give less of a shit about player movement. AD was in New Orleans for 7 years and only played next to two other starting caliber players in that entire timespan. Harden Played 8 seasons in Houston and only asked out when the team was imploding around him and would have wasted the back half of his prime. Paul George might actually be the worst of the bunch but when you look at people's sentiments surrounding that trade now most people act like the Thunder made out better than the Clippers, despite being jerked around by George.  Don't want to lose a star player? Put some fucking talent around them so they can't find greener grass.   &gt;let’s a player sit for 2-3 years then trades him at the end.  Ah, the old ""I don't ever want a free agent to sign here again and have any drafted talent finding their way out as soon as possible"" route. You guys seriously act like the Players have an obligation to give their all for a shit team yet won't trash the owners for wasting player's careers by giving them fuck all to work with. It's only been 4 years but I can't wait for De'Aaron Fox to get to play with the rest of the league instead of playing babysitter to the least competent team in North American sports."
"You put it better than I did. There are big contracts that you have to overpay for because you don't just have 2nd team all nba or productive rookies fall out of the sky everyday so you have to give contracts out like Steven Adams or De'Aaron fox or Kristaps because circumstances require you find the best of the bad option, but most mid level players are not on cost effective contracts and the best most teams can do outside the draft or overpaying is rehab a risky/injury-laden career, hope that an inefficient volume scorer can learn defense, or find someone that bursts out of the advanced metrics models and pray they are scalable. These are all 1/10 chances though so it's easier to just give Kemba $30 million and hope for a 6th seed"
You guys remember when Magic picked Lonzo Ball over Jason Tatum De'Aaron fox &amp; Donovan Mitchell... smh Gotta call that out
"Manu eurostep before finishing  Steph 'losing' his handle (creates space/increases %, not used for getting past defender)  Kyrie/Iverson crossover jab step or untucking jersey  De'Aaron Fox not slowing down"
That would be a pretty terrifying team.   Throw in De'Aaron Fox and Marvin Bagley from Sacramento for good measure.
"*Zach LaVine, De'Aaron Fox, and KAT raise their hands*"
"in before ""bu-bu-but, we have young asserts in Buddy Hield and De'Aaron Fox""   no, you don't... gtfo"
So we all just going to pretend De'Aaron Fox doesn't exist?  23 year old averaging 25/7. Don't give me that shit about empty stats. Ya'll said the same shit about Booker and Trae.   Kings need to work the trade market and hopefully not pass up on another Luka/Trae in the draft. GM needs to make some bold moves going forward.
"an interesting counterfactual is on the Boston side.  It's possible that Rozier stays happy if he's for sure the starter in 2017-2018 and sticks with the team.  Or it's possible that the Celtics could have packaged that Nets pick, the future Kings pick and Rozier to the Kings for De'Aaron Fox coming off his rookie year.  Also with no Kyrie to throw that lob to Hayward on opening night, maybe he doesn't break his ankle in gruesome fashion?"
"Shit team, no team with De'Aaron Fox is a total shit team.  Shit owners, absolutely.  But no way is Sacramento a shit market.  People absolutely love that team no matter what"
"&gt;Did you know that only the guys lined up along the lane can enter the paint while a free throw is in mid-air? The shooter and anyone outside the arc has to wait until it hits the rim.  Lol yeah, De'Aaron Fox tied a game last year blatantly [breaking](https://streamable.com/eme95) this rule."
"&gt;secret that Luka isn't the fastest and doesn't rely on athleticism. He has speed but what makes him great is that he's amazing at controlling the tempo of the game and keeping the defender guessing. He gets to his spots and torches defenses with his moves, shot-making, and passing. He definitely has quickness but his talent in breaking down the defense isn't predicted on his speed per se57ReplyGive AwardShareReportSave   &gt;   &gt;level 3GirlsLastTour · 22h Jazz BandwagonLuka isn't De'Aaron Fox, but he's still athletic. He plays a lot like Harden, and I consider Harden to be athletic. They're not jumping  I think Luka is well into the ""good athlete range"" and in particular, he's got a notably quick first step and impressive agility and strength and balance. But because of his build and the fact that he's white and because he almost never dunks, and his dunks are never impressive, people wrongly say he's an average athlete. I would've thought we'd be beyond that point by now, but here we are. Like Gerald Green could jump,, but when I watched him try to guard shifty/fast players, he looked like he was stuck in mud"
Kings should trade De'Aaron Fox.
"KAT and De'Aaron Fox come to mind. If they were with stable, competent organizations with good coaching, they'd be exponentially more hyped."
"exactly, the Celtics need to do what they can to acquire young talent &amp; hope they can hit on some draft picks/marginal moves in the next 2 years so that they can either bolster the supporting cast around the Jays or have enough enticing assets to land another star once Kemba's deal is up (De'Aaron Fox, please)"
How do we start the process of speaking “De'Aaron Fox is the next Phoenix Suns PG after Chris Paul” into existence?
"Luka isn't De'Aaron Fox, but he's still athletic. He plays a lot like Harden, and I consider Harden to be athletic. They're not jumping out of the gym, but they're definitely athletic. Same with Curry.  (At least in the general sense of the word athletic.)"
Would you do Ben Simmons for De'aaron Fox?
De'Aaron Fox  Donovan Mitchell  Dame  Ja
"Because Donovan Mitchell would have made those situations so much better 😂😂😂  I guess De'Aaron Fox is just ""terrible"" as the lone star in Sac"
De'Aaron Fox...
"If you're a Kings fan, that contact could go either way: either no foul, play on (see De'Aaron Fox getting elbowed in the face no call); or flagrant penalty 2 + 3-game suspension. Just depends on what jersey is where.  In reality, I was okay with calling it a common foul. Obviously it was intentional, and he fouled him hard because he wanted to stop the basket, but the contact to the face/neck was extremely minimal and completely incidental. Russ got as high as he could, but Simmons is several inches taller so he couldn't reach the wrist/ball area and just tried to knock his arms away. His hand flopped around and grazed Simmons in the chin area but didn't have any significant impact, no follow-through, and didn't grab around the shoulders or anything like that either. Even just 2-3 years ago we wouldn't even be having this conversation and there wouldn't even have been a review, because that's a totally typical basketball play to try and stop a guy from getting an easy layup/dunk."
That Dennis Smith Jr. &gt; De'Aaron Fox
Why do you hate us De'Aaron Fox?
De'Aaron Fox genuinely deserves a shout imo
"Hey remember when that one lady said ""Ja Morant is who De'Aaron Fox thinks he is""?  [Remember that time Fox posterized Gobert?](https://youtu.be/9ihkOTTeZI8)  No hate on Morant though, he's been playing great in these playoffs. Just got obliterated on this play lol"
&gt;Why doesn't someone like De'Aaron Fox (72% from the ft line) simply ask the ref to throw him and chestpass and step into the ft line shot?  How does this make any sense?  &gt;Get some lift in his legs and momentum for a baby jump shot.  Potential lane violation
Not with De'aaron Fox existing
He's only going to get to the level of being who De'Aaron Fox thinks he is
"jayson tatum, de'aaron fox, jonathan isaac, donovan mitchell, bam adebayo, john collins, jarret allen, og anunoby, derrick white, dillon brooks"
Knicks fans are salty as fuck. They're STILL not over what De'Aaron fox said about them
"There's this weird narrative about Trae being basically the worst defender of all time. And don't get me wrong, *he is pretty bad*.   But he's not even bottom 3 on his team. Not a very high bar, but the whole ""Trae is actually a net negative because the defense is historically bad"" is crazy. He's 169th out of 500+ in DRPM. You know who is lower? De'Aaron Fox. And I'm not hating on Fox, I love him and think he is amazing and fun and a true talent to build around. It's the narrative that is weird to me. Other notable players with lower DRPM than Trae: KAT, Kemba Walker, Bradley Beal, Ja Morant. Even players like Alex Caruso have a lower DRPM than Trae.   So then you say ""DRPM is a flawed stat"" to which I reply ""absolutely"", but it is the stat that gets thrown around to shit on Trae all the time.   Trae's defense isn't special bad. It's just regular bad. If he was a guaranteed bucket every single time, it would be punished a lot more. People just really really hate him."
You thought you was de'aaron fox
Whenever De'Aaron Fox makes the playoffs
De'Aaron Fox
"I got ""player not found"" trying to connect De'Aaron Fox and Jerry West."
"Yes. A couple of the rookie max guys got it last season, I think De'Aaron Fox off the top of my head"
This feels like the Andre Drummond thing to me. Allen is a nice player but he has a very limited skill set. He's NOT winning games for this team. Bad teams like the Cavs should only pay large sums to guys like De'Aaron Fox or Ja Morant type players. Guys you can build around and eventually pick up guys like Allen for less to be a part of your winning culture.
"Active players:  Hoodie Melo  Upside down headband Rondo  De'Aaron Fox and Jarrett Allen's Ninja style headbands.  Black mask LeBron/Kyrie  Steph Curry's mouthpiece.  D Wade's tinted goggles.  idk if he's retired but also JR Smith's Supreme sleeve. I think Oubre wore it too, but JR wore it 1st and then got it tatted and had to cover it up."
"Pretty clear you never watch Kings games. Subpar coaching, defense, and problems with consistency are certainly reasons they ended up with the record they did this year (also injuries) but De'Aaron Fox is a legit all star calibre player, and Halliburton looks extremely promising.   Not even a Kings fan but I tuned into a tonne of their games this year purely because they were so watchable as a neutral who wasn't invested in the result."
"I'd feel bad for the Kings, but De'Aaron Fox wanted to crack jokes about the Knicks so fuck em. Laughed at us about getting the 8th pick and now that 8th pick and the Knicks are going to the playoffs as a fourth seed while Fox and the Kings ain't even make the play-in...down bad."
I remember that clip when Luka and Fox were at the Rising Stars game and Luka was cracking jokes about De'Aaron. I just remember thinking to myself god damn those 2 could have been amazing together.
Dear De'Aaron Fox...
"De'aaron Fox.  He laughed about the Knicks falling to 8th in the lottery last year and then went at fans for going at him (capping it off with a highlight of him dunking in the Garden in a blowout).  So every time something bad happens with the Kings (for example, losing 8 games in a row), people post screenshots of his tweet.  He deleted the tweet earlier this year after we beat them because so many people were pulling it back up.  Edit - https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lsodud/after_the_draft_lottery_deaaron_fox_reacted_to/"
"&gt; Also MVP’s aren’t usually doled the third time so easily.   And that's really the thing right here. If this was De'Aaron Fox or Ja Morant, he would be a lock as MVP. Steph had an MVP season but they don't like to give it to the same guy more than once."
"de'aaron fox, tyrese haliburton, buddy hield, harrison barnes, and richaun holmes should really be enough to get it done within the next five years imo  funny thing is their roster seems better than their record, like bagley isn't trash and he comes off the bench, they've got delon wright and terence davis hanging around there too, you can do much worse than fox for your superstar and the supporting cast are above-average starters. It just all goes awry for them every time because 1) terrible fo 2) bad coaching 3) it's the kings"
"I feel like he's more of a mix of De'Aaron Fox and Russ than CP3 and Russ (of course now hampered by injury). I wasn't bashing Harden at the time for wanting to leave (although I didn't like him avoiding covid protocols while partying), but it's not crazy to think that Harden could carry a team of Wood, Wall, Cousins, and Gordon to an ok record. Obviously that's not what Harden wanted, nor should he have been forced to do that, but it's not that crazy of a take given how hard Harden can carry his teammates."
"*""Did you draft De'aaron Fox because you thought he was a fox?"" -* Vivek to Vlade"
"* Luka Doncic * Devin Booker * SGA * Donovan Mitchell * Jamal Murray * Trae Young * Ja Morant * De'Aaron Fox  Anyone who doesn't put Luka #1 is on crack. SGA's length makes me love him for the defensive aspect of his game more than a few others, even if they're a bit better scorers. It's crazy how Fox is last cuz I think he's also great."
"Randle takes a step back next season, as does the team defense as thibodeau's style starts to wear on players.  They miss out on all of their big name targets and Thibodeau is fired in the offseason.   Ben Simmons is traded to Portland for CJ which ends up benefitting neither team.  Philly and Portland both end up in the play in tournament.   The Chicago Bulls end up with Kyle Lowry and the number 2 offense behind the Brooklyn Nets and end up with a top 4 seed in the east.   De'aaron fox makes his first all star appearance beating out Shai for the final spot.   Myles Turner leads the league in blocks, makes his first all star appearance and wins defensive player of the year.   The Phoenix Suns make their second straight NBA Finals appearance.   Kyrie Irving gets red hot in the NBA finals as defensive attention is given primarily to Durant and Harden and Irving walks away with Finals MVP."
"So the Kings give up De'Aaron Fox, Bagley, and their #9 pick just so they can be the worst team in the league with Ben Simmons?"
"Kevin Porter Jr., Zion, Dlo, Randle, De'aaron Fox, Sabonis"
"If you don't win gold and leave Trae Young, Ja Morant and De'Aaron Fox off, its going to be a bloodbath for Pop."
"Pop choosing his own player in Keldon Johnson over other, better young American guards like Trae Young, De'Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, or even LaMelo Ball is just laughable. Not that I'm surprised after Pop chose Derrick fucking White over Fox for the terrible 2019 FIBA team lol what a joke."
De'Aaron Fox baby
De'Aaron Fox asks for a trade at the deadline  Damien Lillard is a 6er  Ben Simmons + CJ make the playoffs for the trailblazers  KPJ will be an all star
De'Aaron Fox is way too special to give up on. Sacramento Kings might as well give up on the franchise and move to a new city if they are going to ship out a player like Fox at this point in his career.
If Sacramento is desperate to change things up I think the most realistic all star level player we can get is De'aaron Fox. Even then we would probably have to attach other assets
&gt; I want him and Tobi both gone.   I completely agree. I like Tobias until I realized how much money he was making. Ooof. Keep Embid and Maxi and do a rebuild. You'll still make the playoffs next year (if Embid is healthy) and have the chance to be contenders the following year. Not saying this is going to happen but you guys really need a player like Ja Morant or De'Aaron Fox to play with Embid. Someone who can flat out score and create for others.

"De'Aaron Fox, Buddy Hield, and Tyrese Haliburton for Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, and 28 overall."
"I'm not gonna lie, I think the Rockets would be dumb to let KPJ or Christian Wood factor into the decision of who to take at all. You're an awful team at the beginning of a rebuild, caring about fit at this point makes no sense. De'Aaron Fox was better than either of them and we still see how dumb it was for the Kings to let fit affect their decision.   You always take BPA with any top 3 pick."
"Oh but De'aaron Fox is a borderline All-Star, I would take him over Luka anyway!"
"Seen him a few times (Full games) and have been impressed. Only a few times, so I have to ask, do you think De'Aaron Fox and Haliburton can be a solid back-court that can be built around and lead a contender or a perennial play-off team?"
You are totally wrong! This is fucking insane.   Russillo told Bill that one of his differences was that he had Sabonis and Bill did not!! Bill himself never said much of anything about Sabonis. I am an avid Pacers fan and was like yelling at my phone for 20 minutes sure that Sabonis's name would come up and it almost never did. Russillo then continued to be more aggressive about De'Aaron Fox. I completely understand how subtle a top 40 can be for the fringe players... Sabonis is not a fringe top 40.
De'Aaron Fox
All I know is this clown tried to play De'Aaron Fox so I don't care what his opinions are on anything.
Ja Morant and De'Aaron Fox
"Homer pick, but De'Aaron Fox."
"They got Amare but his injuries caught up to him. They also got Tyson Chandler and Jason Kidd so being a destination isn't an issue, it's building a foundation to get them. Also the media and some players like KD and De'aaron Fox turn everything about the Knicks into a joke. It's like shooting at someone that's wounded.  It's a lot tougher to win here and only the best of the best will truly be able to do it."
"I would put Tatum just behind Zion. I wouldn't have a real preference between SGA, De'Aaron Fox, Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, Ben Simmons, and Booker."
"Watch them just draft more garbage  Like in between drafting DeMarcus Cousins in 2010 and De'Aaron Fox in 2017, they whiffed on so many lottery selections it ain't even funny"
De'Aaron Fox wouldn't put those numbers up in 2011. The league is easy af to score in now.
List of point guards who are 100% better than Reggie Jackson (in no particular order):  1. Curry 2. Lillard 3. Kyrie 4. Cp3 5. Trae Young 6. SGA 7. Jamal Murray 8. De'Aaron Fox 9. Jrue Holiday 10. Mike Conley  11. Westbrook 12. Lowry 13. Kemba 14. Brogdon 15. Ja Morant  and that's not even including big guys that technically play PG like  1. LeBron 2. Luka 3. LaMelo 4. Simmons
"""Did you draft De'Aaron Fox because you thought he was a fox?!""  "".....Foxes are smart...."""
Clearly that other player is De'Aaron Fox
No all stars caveat was a problem and by expensive Im assuming he meant &lt;$20 mil. Also felt cheap to include guys like De'Aaron Fox for that. There probably is a better team than this though
"It doesn't even matter if he isn't (he is imo), the going rate for a good young player coming off their rookie deal is the max. Look at Ben Simmons, De'Aaron Fox,  Jamal Murray, Ingram, Siakam. All got the max (or close to it). Ayton is at worst, as good as those guys."
This is how to do it properly by De'Aaron fox      https://youtu.be/rDpM-U7fbG4
The one by De'Aaron Fox was great. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDpM-U7fbG4
He thought [he was De'Aaron Fox.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDpM-U7fbG4)
De'Aaron Fox 💪
"Trade idea:   Raptors get:   * Jimmy Butler  Heat get:   * De'Aaron Fox  * Marvin Bagley  Kings get:   * OG Anunoby  * Tyler Herro  * Precious Achiuwa  * Rodney Hood (filler)  * 2022, 2024, 2026 Raptors 1sts  * 2024, 2026, 2028 Heat 1sts  Let's say the Raptors draft Suggs. They will have a lot of cap space so let's say they sign John Collins or Richaun Holmes. Then they run something like Suggs/Fred/Butler/Siakam/Collins. That's a good playoff team.   Heat pay up to move on from their aging core to get one of the top young players in the game. Fox is a beast, averaging 25/4/7 last season. Plus they get a reclamation project in Bagley, who still has potential. A Fox/Bam duo could be built around for the next decade.  Kings get a a quality young wing, a promising young point guard, a promising young big man, and six 1sts to continue their rebuild.  They can go forward with Haliburton/Hield/Anunoby/Barnes/???, with Herro/(Ninth Pick)/Precious off the bench. That's a solid young core."
"Bagley should be shit on plenty. His issues are all his own. Yeah the org has issues as well but most of that doesn't really have anything to do with Bagley's specific problems. His two main problems I see, aside from the fact his skill level is way below his draft position:  * Constantly injured - how is the org supposed to do anything about that? It's either a genetic predisposition to being injured or a problem with his personal strength/conditioning routines. (Sure the organization has people to help with that but I think the fact that nobody else in years has had injury issues shows that the people they have are fine.)  * Huge ego/personality problems - this is absolutely entirely on Bagley (and his family). From nearly day 1 of his first season he and/or his family have been talking shit about the Kings organization, coaching, and even other players like the objectively better star De'Aaron Fox. Demanding trade requests, or increased role in the offense despite proving to be incapable of handling it, or benching other players to play him instead, etc. A lot of it has technically come out of the mouths of his dad/uncle, but he's never once said anything refuting them and has repeatedly implicitly approved of their statements. He also bailed on the team for a month or more when he injured his hand, not traveling with the team or participating in team activities whatsoever. On top of that, last time he was injured at the end of this season, he tweeted in celebration about ""never having to play in Sac again"" (then quickly deleted it). And just today he's already joining the bandwagon of players deleting all references to their team in all their social media (like Schröder did). *AND* he's also out there liking tweets from trolls about ""getting him out of Sac."" He's a fucking bum and at this point any Kings fan would be ecstatic to ditch him.  But unfortunately no teams fucking want him either, because between all of the issues above and combined with the fact that his work ethic has been depressing at best, organizations know he's a toxic and unpredictable player. Monte tried to trade him before the deadline last season and couldn't even get pennies back for him. He's on a collision course with exiting the NBA at the end of his rookie contract at this rate."
When Cavs were good for like 3 weeks I saw Cavs fans trying to push Sexton&gt;De'Aaron Fox
De'Aaron Fox is pretty good.
"De'Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Jamal Murray"
Kings First Pick past decade  2020 Pick 12 - Tyrese Haliburton  2019 Pick 40 - Justin James  2018 Pick 2 - Marvin Bagley  2017 Pick 5 - De'Aaron Fox  2016 Pick 8 - Marquese Chriss  2015 Pick 6 - Willie Cauley-Stein  2014 Pick 8 - Nik Stauskas  2013 Pick 7 - Ben McLemore  2012 Pick 5 - Thomas Robinson  2011 Pick 7 - Bismack Biyombo
I mean De'Aaron Fox still owns Lonzo. London sits out half the games against him. He scared.
In 2015 the Kings agreed to a 2017 pick swap with the 76ers as part of a salary dump. That year the Kings won the 3rd pick in the lottery and the Sixers got the 5th and executed the pick swap. They then traded that 3rd pick to Boston in a package for the 1st and took Markelle Fultz.  Without the pick swap who knows if they can get the deal done with Boston (Boston probably wouldn't go later than 3 because they were set on Tatum). They stay pat at 5 and potentially end up with De'Aaron Fox instead of Fultz
Kings without De'Aaron Fox beat them 118-34.
"yeah, when I think of De'Aaron Fox, the first thing to come to mind is winning at a high level."
"Unless Jarrett Allen suddenly turns up with a 3-point shot, De'Aaron Fox is gonna tear all his hair out trying to run a pick&amp;roll with Allen and Simmons both being non-shooters"
Joe Ingles with the speed of De'Aaron Fox and the athleticism of Ja Morant
"Can we get De'aaron Fox please, I'll give as many picks as they want. They get an all star and a nice reset with picks and an identity to build around (Haliburton and Simmons), we get an actual point guard"
I really hope the Kings can get out of mediocrity. They are due for a come up. I love De'Aaron Fox as a player and Kings fans have dealt with enough suffering already. Hopefully you guys can make some good moves in the coming offseason.  Edit: What moves are you hoping for in the offseason? Other than firing Walton of course.
"I've been thinking... De'Aaron Fox for Simmons and a pick, maybe. Sacto puts Haliburton at the point and plays Simmons at the 4. I can't think of a setting with less pressure than Sacramento (with a tradeable asset that would help Philly)."
Honestly the only one I think that I would like to redo is draft De'Aaron Fox over Josh Jackson. Jamal Murray over Dragan Bender but ideally I think Fox &gt; Murray.
"The thing is this. Luka and Trae are better than their entire draft class and will be better than a bunch of other guys in the league. I'd put them a tier above Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, De'Aaron Fox, maybe Devin Booker (we'll see) for sure. These guys are gonna be the next LeBron/KD/Harden/Steph/Kawhi of our era."
"The swing of not only no Tatum but Fultz in the middle of and after a mental breakdown was destructive. If they even take De'Aaron Fox with 1, Brett's preferred pick ironically, its not nearly this bad."
Lot of players with the extra 2 letters in their names lmao  DeMarcus Cousins  DeAndre Jordan  Deandre Ayton  De'Andre Hunter  DeAndre' Bembry  Devonte' Graham  De'Aaron Fox  LaMelo Ball  LaMarcus Aldridge  LeBron James  probably more I don't know
De'Aaron Fox  Zach Lavine  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Bradley Beal  in that order
Luka Doncic  Trae Young  Jayson Tatum  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Devin Booker  Ja Morant  Lamelo Ball  De'Aaron Fox
I want De'Aaron Fox so bad but I doubt Sacramento is giving him up unless he straight up demands a trade
"The lolknicks thing is part of it, but also people couldn't look at it like Porzingis was just wanting to force his way to a bigger market. People on here are super forgiving of small market teams, even if they're really poorly run. Like if De'Aaron Fox suddenly demanded a trade from the Kings you can bet people would be like ""this is bad for the league!"" even though it should be perfectly understandable if a player wants to move on from a team that hasn't made the playoffs in 15 years.   The Pelicans have been run like absolute shit for about as long, but were just more fortunate with the draft to land Chris Paul, Anthony Davis and Zion Williamson which helps paper over a lot of awful decisions otherwise. It shouldn't be a surprise that anyone wants to get away from a bad situation, but people around here tend to instead read this as ""nobody wants to play for a small market team."""
"I do not necessary disagree but I am not sure it will be him.  With the Nets now being a superteam the Superstar armrace has begun and a bunch of players realize their not gonna win unless they go team up with at least 2 other stars.  So Id say either 1 or a combination ofall of Dame, Doncic, (probably once they loose) Giannis, Zion, KAT, Lowry, De'Aaron Fox, Sabonis, with possibly Tatum, Brown, beal, Kawahi all wanting to leave and thats gonna piss of their individual franchises."
Vernon Maxwell  - he's instant coffee   BJ Armstrong - he's an arm wrestling champ  Tayshuan Prince - he's a prince   Reggie Miller - he operates a Mill   ML Carr - he's an automobile   De'Aaron Fox - he's a fox
"Some big names he missed:  * Russell Westbrook * James Harden (I'm calling him a point guard he's a guard with 4 seasons averaging 10+ assists and is almost always directing play fight me), Steph Curry and Jrue Holiday all in 2009 and the only player he picked was Ricky Rubio at tier 2 * On top of Kyrie 2011 also produced Kemba Walker and Isaiah Thomas * Damian Lillard * Oladipo is listed as a PG for his first season - does that count? * 2016 had Ben Simmons (kind of remarkable that around all the hype he didn't even rate him good enough to be an all-star) * 2017 continues it's oofness by also missing De'Aaron Fox (also Donovan Mitchell but I don't think he was considered a PG at the time)."
"Woah, De'Aaron Fox is actually getting recognition? What is this?!?"
De'Aaron Fox  De'Andre Hunter  Jaylen Brown
"Don't know why the Kings would trade the guy they just stole at #9.  &gt;Both him and Haliburton are good day in and day out players who are going to be just good enough to take them out of the absolute basement but not much beyond that  Newsflash my dude: The Kings aren't in the basement. They haven't been in the basement since 2009. They have been a mediocre team plagued by bad coaching, hit and miss drafting and being a small market team where you play in the same state as both LA teams and the Warriors, all of whom are big market franchises, two of which (Clips and Warriors) have developed quickly just over the last decade or so.   They have been stuck in the mediocre existence because the big franchises out West seemingly stay relevant for the most part. Some small market teams, a.k.a. the entire Northwest division, end up having really good drafting (Lillard, Mitchell, Jokic) which leads to franchise altering decision making. De'Aaron Fox will hopefully be somewhat similar, but he isn't quite guaranteed to be someone like that. The Kings have actually been a better team when he doesn't play, so that's something to think about. If Mitchell translates just as well as the staff hopes for, then they have an amazing problem to have: Which two of Fox, Haliburton and Mitchell do we keep?"
De'Aaron Fox
Swap Ben for any guard that can attack and exploit Trae Young or Lou Will in a pick and roll and they win that series. I'm not even talking a Dame or CP3 I'm talking De'Aaron Fox and they win
"There's two lists here because OP is ambiguous. First is a set of people who have never made an all-star team, next is a list of players who weren't all-stars last year.  &amp;nbsp;  **Never Been All-Stars:**  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **G:** Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  **F:** OG Anunoby  **F:** Tobias Harris  **C:** Deandre Ayton  **Honourable mentions:** Jamal Murray, Ja Morant, Jerami Grant, Clint Capela   &amp;nbsp;  **Best Non-2021 All-Stars**  **G:** Trae Young  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **F:** Khris Middleton  **F:** Jimmy Butler  **C:** Karl-Anthony Towns  **Honourable Mentions:** Demar DeRozan, Brandon Ingram, Klay Thompson, and everyone mentioned in the list above."
De'aaron Fox at PG
"Trae Young, De'Aaron Fox, SGA, Ja Morant, are all better than Brogdon."
PG: de'aaron fox  SG: SGA  SF: Og anunoby  PF: Tobias Harris  C: Deandre ayton
**G:** De'Aaron Fox  **G:** SGA  **F:** Jerami Grant  **F:** Tobias Harris  **C:** Clint Capela
De'Aaron Fox
"I'm a huge fan of De'Aaron Fox, but no shot I'm giving up 1st round picks and Simmons for Fox.  As far as Embiids prime I think he is just reaching it, but there is time to find a better deal for Simmons.  I would rather see us make a deal from a position of strength."
Someone mentioned Simmons for De'Aaron Fox which I'm beginning to like the sound of.
"Who ""didn't make the team"" that wanted to be there? De'Aaron Fox? The last 3 spots were basically there for anyone that wanted it."
"We don't know what Davion is yet, so hard to define ""better"" fit.   What we do know is that Haliburton's \*floor\* is a perfect fit next to Fox. The real question is whether Haliburton is too good to limit to secondary playmaker behind De'Aaron. Fox is a borderline all star with elite athleticism and a strong work ethic, but hasn't proven he's the kind of franchise player you can build a contender around. He's incredibly good at it, but he's still pretty one-dimensional as an athlete that can get to the rim and score at will. Haliburton has a much more efficient, versatile game to potentially build around if he can develop himself physically and command a higher usage.   Luckily we have time to watch their growth and adjust accordingly. Maybe our 2022 pick is the next Giannis / Jokic and all 3 of our guards end up as elite complementary pieces next to a frontcourt superstar. But for now we just need talent. Last year our opening day roster was 50% G-League call ups, unproven 2nd rounders, and waiver wire vets. Keeping all of our starters while adding quality depth two years in a row via the draft could be a huge upgrade to our long-term potential."
I'm going with De'Aaron Fox also because upon reading OP's post I had no idea he averaged 25 points a game.
"Has to be De'Aaron Fox, yes I'm a homer but they just ranked him alongside RoCo and Seth Curry"

"Sure, agreed, but it's a lot easier to develop consistency with skills you already *have* than it is to develop skills from scratch. De'Aaron Fox is a lot more likely to develop into a good three-point shooter than Ben Simmons is."
"I mean, they put the Pelicans on national TV a ton last year trying to push Zion into the spotlight (which I fully understand).  But overall, yes I agree that they need to showcase their other young and budding stars. Throw the Hornets on national TV and showcase Lamelo. Get Ja more than MLK day to shine. Show off De'Aaron Fox more. Get some more Denver games to show off Jokic/Murray/MPJ. Let's get a Thunder game with SGA showing off his talent.   https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/12/04/lakers-lead-nba-in-national-tv-games-four-way-tie-for-second/  Last year, the top teams for National TV games were Lakers (16), Celtics (14), Mavericks (14), Pelicans (14), Warriors (14), Nets (13), Bucks (12), Clippers (11), Heat (10). That's 118 games between those 9 teams. The rest of the league had 54 total combined national TV games. The bottom 10 teams only had 3 national tv games (1 each for  Hornets, Knicks, TWolves).   How the hell are people going to be fans of teams that aren't on TV?"
"sorry this is the internet and we're strangers, i genuinely didn't think anyone in this entire thread was being hostile at any point, including you and me lol  &gt; And Ja Morant is in a tier above Brogdon and Lonzo and definitely not average   if we say ""above average"" is the top-10 pgs, ""average"" is the 11-20 pgs, and ""below average"" is the 21-30 pgs, that would mean that Ja is a top-10 PG?  so better than three of:  Steph  Dame  Doncic  Kyrie (or Harden)  Chris Paul  Trae Young  Jamal Murray  Jrue Holiday  Conley  Lowry  Ben Simmons  Russell Westbrook  De'Aaron Fox  which three here would you take Ja over for a game today?  i'm not disagreeing or being hostile i'm genuinely curious."
"Ja Morant will be top 5 in 5 years  Jamal Murray won't get back to his old self  Devin Booker peaked this last season  De'Aaron Fox will ask for a trade, he'll become top 10 in 3 years"
"maybe because people don't understand how words work, but how many fans if they sat down and thought about it would say he's better than at least 4 guys on this list:  Steph  Dame  Doncic  Kyrie (or Harden)  Chris Paul  Trae Young  Jamal Murray  Jrue Holiday  Conley  Lowry  Ben Simmons  Russell Westbrook  De'Aaron Fox  Brogdon  Sexton  Lamelo Ball  Lonzo Ball  Ja Morant  I think he is definitely worse than all of these guys, and he would need to be better than three of them to even be ""average""."

"Not a good playmaker. Dude you dumb as rocks, DLo is not only a good playmaker, he's a great (but not elite) playmaker. He's a comparable or better playmaker than Ja Morant, Damian Lillard, De'Aaron Fox, Jrue Holiday, Donovan Mitchell, and Brandon Ingram. Some of these guys benefit from having a more aggressive scoring game and being the clear focal point of their team (Dame, Ja, Fox), and some of these guys numbers are depressed because of the team and system within which they play (according to my eye: Donovan Mitchell for sure, maybe BI)."
"Three-way trade is more likely. Who's the loser here:  Sixers get:   * Dame Lillard  Blazers get:   * De'Aaron Fox  * Harrison Barnes  * Matisse Thybulle  * 3 Sixers 1sts  Kings get:   * Ben Simmons  * CJ McCollum  * Tyrese Maxey   Sixers get their all nba PG to pair with Embiid. Lillard/Curry/Green/Harris/Embiid is filthy. Easy yes to go all in  Blazers actually improve, in my opinion. Fox/Norm/Barnes/RoCo/Nurk plus Thybulle as a young stud off the bench, plus future picks, is pretty damn good and isn't a three-undersized-guards lineup  Kings get players to make the playoffs with. Davion/Haliburton/McCollum/Simmons/Holmes with Maxey, Buddy, Bagley, TT off the bench is a playoff team  Point is, I think there's something here."

Ask De'aaron Fox
"Houston:  De'Aaron Fox  Stephen Jackson  Jimmy Butler  Emeka Okafor  De'Andre Jordan  We also have Justice Winslow, Kelly Oubre, Justin Jackson (Who all played for the Houston Hoops with Fox), TJ Ford, Gerald Green, Carsen Edwards, Quintin Grimes, Joe/Jacob/Michael Young, Jonthan Simmons   Dallas: *where l was born  Marcus Smart  Grant Hill  Julius Randle  Chris Bosh  LaMarcus Aldrige   Also CJ Miles, Isaiah Austin, and some young guys like Cade Cunningham, and RJ Hampton"
"De'aaron Fox. By a margin. 25 ppg, 7 apg, while shooting %48 from the field. He definitely is fucking underrated."
"AD could be healthy (probably not) which would be huge.  Then a few of Zion, Trae, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo, Anthony Edwards, Ja Morant, or De'Aaron Fox could be all-NBA level players by 2024 and that is probably all it would take."
Smh ship this bozo to Sacramento and let De'Aaron Fox get some real burn on a potential contender.
"PG: Lonzo Ball, SG: De'Aaron Fox, SF: OG, PF: Tobias Harris, C: DeAndre Ayton"
"De'Aaron Fox trade incoming I think.    Davion looks incredibly polished as a young talent, Hali is already a better perimeter shooter than him. Simmons at the 4 and Holmes at the 5, deadly high-low action."
"""De'Aaron Fox gets a DUI after winning Finals MVP."""
Mitchell was playing with a bunch of end-of-bench guys too. If you watched the game then you'd know how many times he passed up an ok shot trying to get his team involved which usually lead to a brick or fumbled catch. The weakest parts of his offensive game tonight were free throw shooting and bailout passes. He was *constantly* driving to the rim and getting hacked. He's no De'Aaron Fox on offense but his decision making and ability to accelerate/decelerate/change direction on a dime make him an immediate two-way player in the NBA.
He was signed by the Kings to be a mentor for De'Aaron Fox and immediately got outplayed by Fox within ten games.
De'Aaron Fox and Luka Doncic 🙃
"I want Derozan to go to the Clippers and for my hot take, De'Aaron Fox to be traded for Ben Simmons."
"&gt; Who cares how long they’ve been there? What weirdo appeal to emotion is that.  Because it matters for the fans. Is Kawhi really a Clipper anymore than he was a Spur or a Raptor? He might even leave this year if he feels like it. If the Clippers traded Kawhi and PG for some younger stars (Ja Morant, De'Aaron Fox types) it wouldn't be close to the uproar of the Warriors trading Steph, Klay and Draymond. Kawhi and PG are mercenaries."
"They could also trade PG and Kawhi for legitimate future stars. Obviously not Luka, Trey or Jokic but you could get a Ben Simmons, Ja Morant or De'Aaron Fox type player that moves your timeline way up."
"No kidding, he didn't even mention the De'Aaron Fox winning MVP, Haliburton winning MIP, and Mitchell winning ROY for a #1 seed Kings team."
* Remaining major trades: Siakam to the Warriors and Ben Simmons &lt;--&gt; CJ McCollum  * Pistons make the playoffs without even needing to win a play-in game  * De'Aaron Fox gets traded mid-season  * Paul George wins MVP  * Nets win the Finals (cold take)
"Plus/minus is not at all a consistent metric for defining one single player's impact when they're on the court.   Using that logic we can conclude that Bradley Beal, De'Aaron Fox, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Victor Oladipo, LaMelo Ball, Russell Westbrook, Buddy Hield and Zach LaVine are not NBA caliber talent, correct? After all, they all have a negative +/- on the season"
They're not making a conference Finals any time soon. They need the great spacing for De'Aaron Fox to do what he does best.
"That site has Westbrook as the worst WPA player on the wizards last year lol. Literally the worst.  That list is sorted by total number of shots taken in the clutch, not on efficiency. In fact if you look at the chart the player immediately following him, Chris Paul, is a much more efficient clutch player. And the player after that, Bradley Beal, and the player after that, De'Aaron Fox, and the player after that, Jayson Tatum."
"Great size, great stats, solid playmaker, 3 level scorer. Lots of blocks for a guard. All true. Was definitely not the quickest player in college basketball though, come on. Ever heard of De'Aaron Fox? Fultz was a great, but not freakish athlete. His first step was good but nothing crazy.  His stats were great, but part of that is also being a great player on a shit team where he can dominate the ball more than most other one and done stars. His efficiency was actually pretty average. At the end of the day most #1 picks are supposed to be insane in college as freshmen and have well rounded skillsets combined with elite physical tools or athleticism. Hell even someone like Dennis Smith averaged 18/4/6 and 2 steals as a freshman, shot well from NBA 3pt range, had absolutely incredible highlights, and he only went #9 overall and busted.  If he was a generational can't miss #1 pick who was seen as a massively better prospect than anyone else then there's no way a good NBA GM would have passed on him over a bad workout."
"De'Aaron Fox, come to Butthead."
"i forgot about the rookies Lakers drafted, i think that helps for salary filler, otoh this whole transaction is predicated on schroder wanting to play for the kings and the kings wanting to pay schroder what he wants (while also taking on the other odds and ends) and this seems implausible considering including the rookie they just got they already have 4 PGs (De'Aaron Fox, Delon Wright, Tyrese Halliburton, Davion Mitchell)."
It's de'aaron Fox (#5) season.
De'Aaron Fox is number 5. Fox 5 = F5. Hope he doesn't get traded tonight.
Even the Schroder s&amp;t doesn't make sense. The Kings already have De'Aaron Fox
What are the Kings gonna do with De'Aaron Fox and Schroder lol
"**Fox Sports:**  Fuiltz 1: ""The Sixers made a no-brainer trade for the first pick, and now they'll make the no-brainer choice with the selection.""  Tatum 3: ""Taking the Duke forward with the first pick would have been a reach. Trading down to No. 3 allows Ainge to take the guy he wants without facing a ton of criticism (and while adding another asset down the line).""  **Sports Illustrated**  Fuiltz 1: Mocking this one is like getting extra credit for spelling your name correctly.   Tatum 3: This could be Josh Jackson (who may have greater value in a deal), but the better fit for Boston would be Tatum, thanks to his potential to space the floor, play some power forward and become a go-to scorer down the line.  **Bleacher Report:**  Fuiltz 1: ""Markelle Fultz remains the favorite to go No. 1, even if the Boston Celtics trade the pick.""  Tatum 5: ""The Sacramento Kings won't be happy to see the Phoenix Suns grab De'Aaron Fox. But Fox going top four means Jayson Tatum slips to No. 5, where he stands out as a strong candidate for best player available.""  **Chad Ford:**  Fuiltz 1: ""That all-around style of play would be a welcomed addition alongside Ben Simmons and the 76ers' numerous young big men to help round out the roster and start the organization's ascent up the standings in the Eastern Conference.""  Tatum: 3: ""It will likely come down to the Celtics then picking Jackson sight unseen or going with Tatum, who might wind up fitting better in the long term.""  **CBS Sports:**  Fuiltz 1: ""Is Fultz ""can't-miss""? He's as close as there is to can't-miss as there is in this draft""  Tatum 3: ""It may prove to be the smart decision, seeing that the Celtics have plenty of flexibility in the near future. (If things break the right way, there's a chance the Celtics could have high lottery picks from the Nets and Lakers next season.) ""  Many of these were saying that the biggest issue with Tatum over Jackson was that Jackson refused to meet with the Celtics. It's likely they would have had Jackson over Tatum, if that didn't happen.  When people are saying Fuiltz is ""as close as there is to 'can't-miss'"", ""Sixers will make a no-brainer choice"", and ""Remains the favorite even if Boston trades the pick"" implies that the majority of people and analysts thought Fuiltz was clearly the better talent.  When they are trying to figure out if the C's should take Tatum over Jackson, when Jackson refused to workout with them, then you know the perceived talent disparity between Fuiltz/Tatum is more then the draft positions of 1-3, rather then the opposite argument which you are making.  Just because Ainge Zigged when everyone else Zagged doesn't change that 95% of the people thought Fuiltz had more talent."
"Not a Kings fan nor really care, but asset value isn't  correlated to team performance. There's a lot of factors that go into win/loss record. That doesn't change the fact that De'aaron Fox would fetch a TON of value in trades.  Players like Hield aren't worth as much as their fans might think but it's not due to team performance."
I always forget about De'Aaron Fox. My b.
"If they take Jalen Green, I don't think they will massively regret it because I see them as pretty close prospects with an edge to Green.  Some noteworthy things about Cade:  1. He only averaged 3.5 assists in college playing 36 mpg. He averaged more turnovers than assists at 4.0. Should his team take the blame for it? Maybe.  2. He's not an elite athlete at really anything. He doesn't have the deceleration of Harden, the quickness of Trae Young, the pure speed of De'Aaron Fox, the leaping ability of LeBron, the strength of Luka. He's just a good athlete, not a great one. Not a deal breaker at all but worth noting.  Don't get me wrong, he's an excellent prospect and is deserving of a no.1  pick, I'm just not convinced he's as far ahead of the pack as it seems."
De'Aaron Fox 👀
De'aaron Fox and Lonzo
"If you take De'Aaron Fox, teach him how to dribble with the 60s rules, and teleport him back to the 60s, he would have averaged 50/20/20.    Oscar legit wouldn't be a top 100 player in todays NBA. Stop with this bullshit."
"Fox is by far the best player you can get for Simmons otherwise the option is to just run it back.  Kings can demand a premium for De'Aaron since they're negotiating from a position of strength here, not the Sixers."
Fuck De'Aaron Fox.  (/s)
Yeah De'Aaron Fox should stay loyal to the Kings and work hard and and persevere and he will win a ring one day it's only a matter of time
This thread is a mess. Are y'all gonna give De'Aaron Fox praise if he stays with Sacramento and their FO continues to do what they always do? Or are y'all gonna give him the Devin Booker/Trae Young treatment when they weren't in the playoffs?
De'Aaron Fox has said before that Ben might be faster than him.
Saw a video where De'Aaron Fox was asked to compares himself with other speedy players like John Wall and Donovan Mitchell and he doesn't even give the other options a thought
De'Aaron Fox as of rn I'd say
"De'Aaron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Zach Lavine, Anthony Edwards, Ja Morant come to my mind."
"De'Aaron Fox I think, Ish and Russ probably have lost a bit of pure speed"
I'd take Fox over Trae. I think Trae is great but I really think De'Aaron is just that much better.
"It's literally just making shit up.  ""Here's another thing that could have happened"" let's you say whatever. Another thing that could have happened is they trade Embiid for De'Aaron Fox. A bunch of stuff 'could' have happened. It's meaningless."
"De'Aaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Harrison Barnes, Ben Simmons, Richaun Holmes.   Terence Davis, Louis King, Mo Harkless, Chimezie Metu, Tristan Thompson."
"&gt; Morey is unrealistic with his expectations in a trade.  Look I get that the dude had an awful playoff series but how is it unrealistic to want a good player for a three time all-star and DPOY candidate? Should Morey just accept Malik Beasley or Buddy Hield and call it a day? That would make no sense.  &gt; Dame ain't happening. Neither is Beal.  No team is getting these guys, but there's still plenty of dudes between ""the top guards in the league"" and guys who don't even start. I mean honestly, pull up Ben's resume and say that you shouldn't get an All-Star in return for 4 years of him. Is it really entirely crazy to think that he might be in conversation for a guy like De'Aaron Fox, who has played in exactly 0 meaningful games in his career and has garnered exactly 0 accolades so far?"
"This is going to really backfire on a player someday. De'Aaron Fox or Anthony Edwards will resign with their team, ask for a trade after two horrible years, and either lose two years of salary or suffer through two years of playing for a horrible team"
De'Aaron Fox. Not many acknowledge just how good he is. Legitimate all-star caliber player that's been overlooked because of the team he plays for.
De'Aaron Fox
PG: De'aaron Fox SG: Bradley Beal SF: Lebron PF: Siakam  C: Giannis  Jordan Clarkson Lou Williams Joe Ingles DeAndre Jordan Blake Griffin Buddy Hield Thybulle
"PG: De'Aaron Fox, John Wall  SG: Paul George (AS), Zach Lavine (AS), Marcus Smart  SF: Kawhi Leonard (SS), Nicholas Batum, Jae Crowder  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (SS), John Collins  C: Myles Turner, Serge Ibaka"
De'aaron Fox.
De'Aaron Fox for Chris Webber. Fuck yes. Love Fox but we have too many guards.
1. Jayson Tatum  2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Bam Adebayo  4. De'Aaron Fox  5. John Collins  6. Lonzo Ball  7. Jonathan Isaac  8. OG Anunoby  9. Jarrett Allen  10. Monte Morris  11. Kyle Kuzma  12. Derrick White  13. Lauri Markannen  14. Luke Kennard
I crunched the numbers but then gave a boost to JI (injuries - but eye test says DPOY) and Markkanen (Boylen - but I think he could flourish in the right situation).   1. Bam Adebayo. 2. Jayson Tatum. 3. Donovan Mitchell. 4. OG Anunoby. 5. Jonathan Isaac. 6. Lonzo Ball. 7. John Collins. 8. De'Aaron Fox. 9. Lauri Markkanen. 10. Derrick White.
"If De'Aaron Fox -- who's been getting steadily better every season -- can somehow will the Kings to the play-in or the 8th seed, then at least put that man in the conversation.     Please, us Kings fans just need to feel something again."
De'Aaron Fox never played in the playoffs and that is certainly a knock against his value. You don't know if he would choke/exposed like Julius Randle.
PG - De'Aaron Fox ($3)  SG - Bradley Beal ($8)  SF - Jayson Tatum ($7)  PF - Draymond Green ($3)  C - Joel Embiid ($9)
De'aaron Fox. Jimmy Butler.
"Last I heard, Sac wasn't moving De'Aaron Fox. They were trying to move Buddy Hield + assets.  Colin Sexton gets almost as many turnovers as assists (2.8 vs 4.4). He's a maybe, but he's not as good as Fox or CJ.  D'angelo Russell can't stay healthy. Not a good fit with Embiid, who also has iffy health.  I haven't heard Portland offer up CJ. If CJ were on the table today, Morey should (and probably would) take it."
Most trades I've seen include CJ McCollum or De'Aaron Fox or Colin Sexton or D'Angelo Russell. All players that are starting guards....
De'Aaron Fox &gt; Ben Simmons  Screw you Philly! (Not reading terminal Market though)
"I think the analysis in the Simmons-Embiid situation is off. Every team that takes a player with shooting issues is hoping that the shooting improves. Maybe you get a Kawhi Leonard Chip England miracle. Maybe you get some real steps forward like De'Aaron Fox. Maybe you get a real problem like Simmons.  There is an easy viewpoint where Fultz is healthy and Simmons switches to his right hand, and Simmons, Fultz, and Embiid all shoot threes at a nice clip.  If you want to take shots at the Sixer, aim them at their player development and medical teams ... maybe the community environment that seems to produce high pressure shooting collapses.  For the OP's point ... we might get a better answer to this question with my Kings' Fox, Haliburton, Mitchell backcourt."
De'Aaron Fox is a top 8 PG def  Will become top 5 soon enough as guys like CP3 and Russ start to decline
"I'd enjoy watching a dude break 100 pts in a game, especially Dame, Kyrie, Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan, or De'Aaron Fox (last one is definitely bias on my part). Maybe Steph, but that's a lot of 3s. I wanna see a 3 level scorer who will utilize all 3 levels to get past 100"
"I get that for sure, there's young guys that come in and just take over a team. Like you mentioned Ja, Luka is definitely up there aswell. But there's more to it aswell, I'm certain more young players have that same mentality/leadership aspect to them, they just never really get to show it because their team is ass. Good example imo is De'Aaron Fox."
This is an interesting question. All these players have similar minutes played and games played last season (with Shai playing 35 games as an exception).I took a numeric approach to ranking these players. Opting to assign points to the 5 major counting stats in a fantasy points based system.  &amp;nbsp;    |Pts|Reb|Ast|Stl |Blk| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |1|1.2|1.2|3|3|  &amp;nbsp;           ---  &amp;nbsp;          |**Ja Morant**|**Pts**|**Reb**|**Ast**|**Stl**|**Blk**|**Total**|**Rank**| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |**Actuals**|19.1|4|7.4|0.9|0.2||| |**Final**|19.1|4.8|8.88|2.7|0.6|36.08|5|  &amp;nbsp;    |**De'Aaron Fox**|**Pts**|**Reb**|**Ast**|**Stl**|**Blk**|**Total**|**Rank**| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |**Actuals**|25.2|3.5|7.2|1.5|0.5||| |**Value**|25.2|4.2|8.64|4.5|1.5|44.04|2|  &amp;nbsp;    |**Trae Young**|**Pts**|**Reb**|**Ast**|**Stl**|**Blk**|**Total**|**Rank**| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |**Actuals**|25.3|3.9|9.4|0.8|0.2||| |**Value**|25.3|4.68|11.28|2.4|0.6|44.26|1|  &amp;nbsp;    |**Michael Porter Jr.**|**Pts**|**Reb**|**Ast**|**Stl**|**Blk**|**Total**|**Rank**| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |**Actuals**|19|7.3|1.1|0.7|0.9||| |**Value**|19|8.76|1.32|2.1|2.7|33.88|6|  &amp;nbsp;    |**Shai Gilgeous-Alexander**|**Pts**|**Reb**|**Ast**|**Stl**|**Blk**|**Total**|**Rank**| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |**Actuals**|23.7|4.7|5.9|0.8|0.7||| |**Value**|23.7|5.64|7.08|2.4|2.1|40.92|3|  &amp;nbsp;    |**Lamelo Ball**|**Pts**|**Reb**|**Ast**|**Stl**|**Blk**|**Total**|**Rank**| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |**Actuals**|15.7|5.9|6.1|1.6|0.4||| |**Value**|15.7|7.08|7.32|4.8|1.2|36.1|4|  &amp;nbsp;
"De'Aaron Fox, Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Brandon Ingram, Pascal Siakam, Karl-Anthony (take note, OP) Towns.  The underrated starting 5."
What makes Simmons better than D’angelo Russel or De'Aaron Fox? Personally I would rather have either of them over him.
De'Aaron Fox on r/instagramreality is hilarious
"Team USA could be a powerhouse in soccer if the top guards in the league opted to play soccer over basketball as their main sport as a kid.  Imagine Derrick Rose, Westbrook, Ja Morant, De'Aaron Fox or Anthony Edwards playing soccer."
De'Aaron Fox with a league average organization
"I beleive it's a reference to his dad saying De'Aaron Fox is gonna ""eat Lonzo's ass"" in terms of how much better he's going to be."
More plates More dates needs to do a Natty or not on De'Aaron Fox
"&gt; Lots of freshman and sophomores have had his level of success  Name freshman other than Kevin Durant and Michael Beasley that have.  &gt;By those measurements he was not even top 10 within the year he played  Do you mean players in the country? That basically never happens for freshmen in P5, especially not if you aren't playing on Kentucky/Duke/Gonzaga/a powerhouse school at the time.  &gt;Someone like Zion the next year was an actual all-time dominating force in college  Playing at a powerhouse with pretty much an entire roster better than the 2nd best player on Trae's team.  &gt;Trae is only an all-time talent if you count exclusively by raw point and assist totals and ignore literally everything else.  Yes, volume and situation both actually matter lmao.  The list of players with Trae's intersection of volume, situation, and efficiency is incredibly small.   Zion played on one of the most talented teams in the country under the best college coach of all-time, on a team that cranks out hyperefficient seasons on a regular basis. Zion was a notch above their typical hyperefficiency, but Marvin Bagley was 21/11 on 64.3% TS, and Jahlil Okafor was 17/8.5 on 64.1% TS.  Like you've done multiple times already, you completely miss the significance of the landscape of college basketball.   &gt;58% TS is good but not amazing for college.  27.4ppg on 58.5% TS is absurd lmao, its literally mind-meltingly good. That's why I wanted you to look up all the previous top PG draft picks so you could grasp how much of an outlier Trae's production was.   Lonzo Ball: 14.6ppg  De'Aaron Fox: 16.7ppg  Ben Simmons: 19.2ppg  D'Angelo Russell: 19.3ppg  Marcus Smart(soph): 18ppg  Victor Oladipo(junior): 13.6ppg  Damian Lillard(senior in non-P5): 24.5ppg  Kyrie Irving(11 games): 17.5ppg  John Wall: 16.6ppg  Tyreke Evans(non-P5): 17.1ppg  Steph Curry(junior, non-P5): 28.6ppg  Derrick Rose(non-P5): 14.9ppg  Russell Westbrook: 12.7ppg  The only PG close to Trae's volume was Curry, and he did it as a Sophomore and Junior in a non-P5 conference. Trae doing it on great efficiency on top of it is ridiculous.   Doing what Trae did as a freshman in the P5 on a non-powerhouse is as close as it gets to outright unheard of. The only comparables are Beasley and Durant.    &gt;Many guys are regularly well over 60% even on high volume.  Not Guards, not Freshmen, not on Trae's volume, not in the Power 5, and not at non-powerhouse schools.   &gt;Also, Trae’s TS% was hugely uplifted by shooting a ton of free throws, which is another thing many college guys struggle to bring over to the NBA.  That's the opposite of true. FT attempts are one of the stickiest stats, if not the actual stickiest from college to the NBA. Rim attempts and FT attempts are two of the biggest predictors of NBA success and Trae was elite at both."
"But We do have De'Aaron Fox, He could make a All-Star soon"
"The players also have a tendency to live in some totally random, but totally ordinary places/neighborhoods. Back at the old arena in Natomas, a bunch of players, especially rookies and players who just moved to the area during free agency or from a trade, would just be living in ordinary houses in these ordinary neighborhoods in Natomas since it was close to the arena. Some of the rookies even just lived in the totally plain apartment complex directly across the street (Nik Stauskus).  De'Aaron Fox first lived in Laguna West, which is very suburban and family-oriented neighborhood way at the south end of town. He moved to a much nicer/wealthier in Folsom/El Dorado Hills later on. Willie Cauley-Stein used to live in my family's neighborhood way out sort of in the middle of nowhere, just casually.   I feel like in just about any other NBA city, the players will pretty much always go for whatever wealthy/bougie/gated community is popular in the area but in Sacramento everyone just kind of spreads out into random places, despite us having those aforementioned communities."
"I have visited people in Sacramento and ran into Peja twice just hanging out in Whole foods on his phone eating a box of brownies in his workout clothes. The cashier says he just does that and has become a sort of decoration there. It's really star striking at first, but after a while he just shows up and everyone just says hey. He spends HOURS and HOURS at whole foods just pulling things off the shelves, eating them and then paying for the empty boxes at the register.   According to friends they see Bobby Jackson, Doug Christie and several players downtown at random coffee joints and restaurants all the time. Apparently De'Aaron Fox and Buddy go to this sushi place all the time downtown and they just have a loft area for them to chill on so they're not bothered.   The town LOVES their players and treat them like royalty and EVERYONE knows them even if they are not into basketball."
"&gt; but not otherwordly  But they were otherworldly lol. He was literally the first player in NCAA history in scoring and assists and did it as a freshman, on top of having the highest-scoring freshman season ever at a Power 5 school, and he did it on great efficiency.   &gt;Again, you can look at Steph as a comparion. Steph is small but is actually taller and longer than Trae. And his efficiency and advanced stats in college were significantly better than Trae.  How about looking at De'Aaron Fox, D'Angelo Russell, Victor Oladipo, John Wall, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Mike Conley, etc.  Even if you want to die on the hill of comparing Trae to the college career of the GOAT shooter:  Steph's freshman year he put up 21.5/4.6/2.8 on 61.7% TS in the Southern Conference against a -2.26 rated strength of schedule.  Trae's freshman year he put up 27.4/3.9/8.7 on 58.5% TS in the Big 12 against a 10.56 rated strength of schedule.  Trae's freshman year was still more impressive when you contextualize it.   &gt;but taking a guy like Steph is still a gamble.  This is a moronic take."
"Fuckers in school telling me, always in the barber shop"" Fox ain't 'bout this, Fox ain't 'bout that"" My boy a baller on fucking Lamron and them, they say De'Aaron don't be putting in no work Shut the fuck up"
"Never forget that Lakers would've won in 2026 if De'Aaron Fox was healthy for the finals, don't let Orlando Magic fans tell you otherwise."
De'Aaron Fox always finishes when he gets rimmed
I've been such a huge fan of De'Aaron Fox but holy shit is this insane. Hopefully the Kings put the right team around him because he's gonna be a superstar.
De'Aaron Fox if he doesnt leave Sac
"Earlier today, I saw someone say that De'Aaron Fox is a good defender which gave me a good laugh. They weren't a Kings's fan, so I'm not sure what they were smoking since it wasn't homerism."
"Imo De'Aaron Fox, I don't get the hype surrounding him."
"Curry  Luka  Lillard  Trae   CP3  Kyrie Irving  Fox  Morant  Holiday  Murray  Harden and Shai are both listed as SG's (I know Harden at least is just lying about that label) so if they're counted Harden slots in at 2, and Shai would be ahead of Morant. OP what did De'Aaron Fox ever do to you?"
De'aaron fox. Idk I just don't think a point guard without a consistent 3pt shot can be the best player on a team in today's NBA.
"If we are talking counting stats Fox is the clear winner, if you are looking at things like true shooting% and PIE then the advanced stats are close, but the stuff listed above(BPM, Win Shares, etc.) is based heavily on +/- which is heavily skewed by team success. Like I said defensively Ben Simmons is amazing, its just that the current NBA values offense a lot more, and De'Aaron is simply a much better offensive player."
"&gt; what exactly are you betting on Fox becoming   De'Aaron Fox averaged 25/3.5/7 last year, he doesn't have to become anything, he is already really fucking good, and he is not unplayable in the playoffs.          Their new FO would have the same faith as the last one if they trade Fox for Ben Simmons. Sure, Ben can magically get a jumper I guess, but why the hell would they bet their jobs on that?"
If being friends mattered then Morey wouldn't be asking for De'Aaron Fox from the Kings. Both he and McNair are pretty close as well.
If being friends mattered then Morey wouldn't be asking for De'Aaron Fox from the Kings. He and McNair are close as well.
"Maybe I'm a homer, but I genuinely think Markelle can be way better than that. Warriors Livingston was a role player, and I think Markelle is fully capable of being a borderline All-Star+, even if his shot never returns to his college days.  He's a force in transition, and basically gets to the rim at will. If you sag off, he can still attack and hit the midrange - he's not Ben Simmons. He is an excellent playmaker and ball handler, and has great size. People are way too down on him honestly, 19-20 was basically his rookie year and he was an efficient and effective 4th/5th option. If you look back at any of the gamethreads from 20-21 before he got hurt, they are full of fans from the *opposing team* talking about how good Markelle looks, and saying he looks like 'he's back.'  It's frustrating seeing people shit on him but they have only looked at his stats, and didn't actually *watch* him play. He's only had 1 actual season under his belt, and he's only a few months older than Davion Mitchell, but people act like he's borderline retired and totally washed.  If the shot gets better that will be great, but I really think he can average 20/8 regardless - maybe not this year with having to ease back in from the ACL but the year after. He is imo every bit as talented as a Ja Morant or De'Aaron Fox, he just hasn't had the same opportunity and health. When he gets back healthy, and the offense runs through him, I think a lot of people will be eating crow."
De'Aaron Fox is coming off a season of 25PPG and 7APG. He has way more value in the modern NBA than Simmons.
"Had crazy luck in the playoffs. Nets went out to the 8 seed. Played the Bucks without Giannis. Played the Clippers in the finals and Paul George and Kawhi were both hurt.      Rest of my team is De'aaron Fox, Jaylen Brown, Porzingas, and Douggie Buckets."
"&gt;Just like De'Aaron Fox, Mike Connelly, Chauncey Billups, Kyle Lowry, &amp; Steve Nash you can tell that after a bad first year they are a bust.  ""but look at these 6 examples that worked out after a bad first year after 100's that didn't work out after a bad first year""  think man THINK"
"Just like De'Aaron Fox, Mike Connelly, Chauncey Billups, Kyle Lowry, &amp; Steve Nash you can tell that after a bad first year they are a bust.    You need a player like Brandon Jennings, Michael Carter Williams, or Tyreke Evans; after good rookie years those guys were destined to be stars."
"De'Aaron Fox. I'm just starting my freshman year at his high school, and he has about 5 rafters in the stands, his number on both backboards, and a mural when you enter the hallway inbetween the court and the parking lot."
"He was as quick as De'Aaron Fox, and had an extensive bag of finishes with his right hand in the paint on either the left or right side of the key. He also played pick and roll with Tim Duncan, which helped."

"Assuming they sign the deal today for the next 5 years:  **100% worth it**:  * Lebron (idc how old he is he's still the best player when he plays)  * Jokic  * Giannis (I honestly am not as big on Giannis as most but I would be raked over the coals if I left him off)  * Luka  * Harden  * KD  * Tatum (people might disagree but he's a durable two-way player with a very high floor, so even if he doesn't develop anymore I think it's worth it or almost worth it)  These are guys who are not big injury risks and can be the best player on a championship team.  KD is the biggest injury risk but he is good enough and just durable enough to definitely be worth it.  And none of them are big defensive liabilities.  **99% worth it**:  * Kawhi  * Curry  Great players that can lead their team but may have age/injury risks tied to them.    **I basically think that all of the players below this are unlikely to win a championship if they are on a supermax.**  **Worth it but it's a risk**:  * Embiid (he's the second best big in the league but is a pretty big injury risk)  * Zion  * Jimmy Butler (he's a great all-around player and a winner, but he's not quite as good as everyone above him on this list)  * Paul George (before this postseason run he probably wouldn't have been in this tier)  * Donovan Mitchell (he's a good player, I think the risk is that he never quite reaches superstar potential, but it would likely be a slight overpay rather than a complete waste)  * KAT (young player who's a beast on offense, bad defensively, no success whatsoever)  * Trae Young (he's small and a terrible defender so he will need to become a player almost as good as Curry to be worth it)  * Ja Morant  **Not worth it, but would get it**:  * Lillard (bad defensively, no playoff success)  * Anthony Day-to-Davis (can't stay healthy, has proven he cannot be THE guy)  * Bradley Beal (i don't think this would handicap a team, but i don't think he's quite a superstar)  * Russell Westbrook (no idea if he would get it at this point in his career, but i bet some team would give it to him)  I don't think Devin Booker would get it, but he would probably fall into this list.  Although he's another guy that prob wouldn't handicap a team on a supermax, he just probably wouldn't ever fully live up to it.  And I don't think CP3 would get it today at his age.  ***Might* be worth it, but prob wouldn't get it**:  * Anthony Edwards  * LaMelo Ball  * SGA  * Jamal Murray  * De'Aaron Fox  Did I miss anyone?"
"You're going to see more future All-Stars than ever before with a negative win shares during their rookie seasons. De'Aaron Fox and Brandon Ingram both had negative win shares during their rookie year but both turned out to be All-Star performers. Yeah, Fox hasn't made an All-Star team yet but he's due. Most highly  touted prospects these days only play one year of college ball. Back then, these type of prospects were in college for like 2-3 years, so they are more NBA-ready with them improving on their games before they get into the NBA."
"Zion is gone and obviously Fox, my man De'aaron is an All Star (25 and 7) but nobody gives a fuck because he's in Sacramento."
"Okay, let me clarify what my argument is because you're really not understanding. There are two main things I'm trying to look at.  First, advanced stats are a useful method for determining the value that players add on the court. They do a better job of combining the impact of both volume and efficiency in a way that basic counting stats like a pts/reb/ast cannot capture. That being said, no single advanced statistic is perfect. For example, PER and WS/48 minutes reward efficiency too much. I'm not saying that any person with a higher PER is a better player than anyone else with a lower PER. I am saying that by looking a several different advanced stats, you can get a better sense of a players impact than you can get by looking at just counting stats.  People who are EASILY top 20 players will usually show up in the top 20 of at least one of these advanced stats. Volume scorers like MVP Iverson will usually perform better in things like WS and VORP. High efficiency guys like MVP Dirk usually get rewarded by PER and BPM. They might show up overperforming in different stats depending on the tradeoff between efficiency and volume, but people who are EASILY top 20 players usually show up in the top 20 of at least one category. The fact that 2004 Lebron doesn't show up in ANY category is an indicator that other players in the league had a better on court impact. Hell, he ranked 3rd in win shares on his own team!  Second, I'm trying to give you additional examples of players that put up big counting stats on bad teams with low efficiency. Lebron's 2004 season was very comparable to Collin Sexton or De'Aaron Fox last season. They were all on bad teams and they all had to carry a larger load than should be expected of them. Why is Lebron's 2004 season better than either of them? You've just been ignoring that part.   By Lebron's second season, he was an MVP contender. He finished top 5 in MVP voting every year from 2006 to 2017. So now if we look back and say Sam Cassell &gt; Lebron James it sounds stupid as hell bc we know what Lebron James is now. Your entire argument has been ""We know Lebron James is better than all these people"". And yes, we know that is true bc of the past 18 years. But in 2004, Sam Cassell, in the best season of his entire career, was better than a rookie Lebron."
De'aaron Fox.
"Yeah... and that's also why I didn't give you one specific advanced stat. But you would think that someone who is EASILY a top 20 player would show up somewhere in the top 20 of at least one advanced statistic. A couple of his teammates (who are playing in the exact same context) do show up in the top 20 of advanced stats. Boozer is #16 in PER, #18 in WS, and #16 in ORTG. Big Z is #20 in PER.  Why is 2004 Lebron significantly better than Collin Sexton or De'Aaron Fox this year? They're all on losing teams. They are all putting up good numbers. We would agree that Collin Sexton and De'Aaron Fox are not top 20 players. Why is 2004 Lebron EASILY a top 20 player? Those guys are also putting up volume numbers their teams need them to produce. And they're actually doing it at a better efficiency (even if we adjust for league averages)."
De'Aaron Fox is one of my favorite players. I don't know much about the rest of the roster though.  Sorry but there's no reason to go from being a fan of one futile franchise to another. If I could switch teams I'd become a fan of a superteam or something like this
De'aaron Fox will make an all NBA team at least once in his career.
"Best chance would probably be last year when Simmons was 3rd team All-NBA and the Kings ended up four games out of the 8 seed. The difference between an All-NBA player and De'Aaron Fox could be four wins, I don't think that's super crazy."
"God I love that De'Aaron Fox is legitimately wanting to stay in Sac-Town. Awesome to see a star love that city, and the city love him back."
1. Stephen Curry  2. Damian Lillard 3. Kyrie Irving 4. Trae Young 5. Chris Paul 6. Ja Morant 7. Jrue Holiday 8. De'Aaron Fox 9. Ben Simmons 10. Russell Westbrook  That's their top 10
RemindMe! 5 years  My 2025 top 20 list:  1. Luka Doncic  2. Jayson Tatum  3. Trae Young  4. Giannis Antetokounmpo  5. Nikola Jokic  6. Donovan Mitchell  7. Ja Morant  8. De'Aaron Fox  9.

"Idk man but I'm just tryna think of ways to trick the Kings out of De'Aaron Fox, TEAM JJ TIMEFOX HAS TO HAPPEN YO THAT SHIT IS AN AUTO-BANNER IN A COUPLE YEARS"
Ja Morant and De'Aaron Fox are basically the second coming of John Wall and it won't translate into legitimate playoff success
"The article has De'Aaron Fox at number 8 as well, so several of those people."
1. Steph Curry  2. Damian Lillard  3. Trae Young  4. Chris Paul  5. De'Aaron Fox  6. kyrie/lamelo/simmons
"I think that De'Aaron Fox is most likely to make an all-star team. In my opinion, he's noticeably better than Ja Morant and significantly better than FVV and LaMelo. 25/7.2/3.5 is definitely good enough to eke his way onto an all-star spot."
"yeah russ is a monster when he's on his game but other guys are maybe more complete guards who shoot better and play better defense  they could have gone after dinwiddie or mike conley, or lonzo, or brogdon.   those guys would have been pretty easy to get  a harder thing would be to try and swing a trade for a de'aaron fox kind of player."
"So this trade is talked about (or at least was) a fair bit, but it hasn't been mentioned here and it might be one of the most disasterous trades of all time.  The Dwight Howard - Andrew Bynum trade.  Philly gets: Andrew Bynum - never plays a game for them and two years later is out of the league  Jason Richardson - is mostly hurt during his two years with the team only playing 52 Games  LA gets: Dwight Howard - spends one year with the team that is pretty much an unmitigated disaster, sustains a back injury and is never quite the same player.   Chris Duhon - plays one year with the lakers and then retires  Earl Clark - plays one year for the lakers, shows a little promise but never improves from there and is out of the league by 2015  Denver Gets: Andre Iguodala - While he was able to help the team to over 50 wins, he leaves after the season to go to the Warriors.    Orlando Gets: Nikola Vucevic - Solid all-star level player for many years on bad Magic teams.  Gets traded to the Bulls in 2021  Aaron Afflalo - A good stats on a bad team player for 2 Magic seasons before getting traded for Evan Fornier  Al Harrington - Plays only 10 games with the Magic during his only season before being waived  Moe Harkless - His time in Orlando was not great, even after a promising rookie season.  His playing time declined and he was traded to Portland in 2015  Josh McRoberts - Played one season for the Magic before being traded to the bobcats for Hakim Warrick  Christian Eyenga - Never played a game for the Magic  2013 2nd Rounder from Nuggets - Became Romero Osby who never played in the NBA  2014 1st Rounder from the Sixers - Became Dario Saric, traded back to the Sixers for Elfrid Payton  2017 1st Rounder from the Sixers - Traded back to Sixers in the Elfrid Payton deal.  Then traded to the Kings and became De'Aaron Fox  Protected 1st Rounder from the Lakers - Eventually transfers as two 2nd rounders in 2017.  Magic use the first on Wesley Iwundu, and the second is traded to the Nets and used on Rodions Kurucs in 2018  The Sixers and the Lakers get totally destroyed by this trade.  Both teams end up becoming two of the worst teams in the NBA for years directly following the trade.    The Nuggets were able to have a good year directly following the trade with Iguodala being a large contributor, but he still leaves the next year.  The Magic is a mixed bag,  Vucevic was probably the gem of this trade playing a high level for the Magic for several years.  Afflalo was also a good contributor to this Magic team.  but while the Magic likely expected to be bad right after the trade I don't think they expected to have not made any meaningful progress up the standings a decade later.  A lot of this is bad management (Getting Elfrid Payton when you could have had De'Aaron Fox and Dario Saric is particularly bad), but it is pretty clear they didn't get the pieces they needed to build for the future like they thought they were getting."

"Honestly, it's the exact opposite.   Last year we had horrible depth but Fox put up an all-star worthy performance to prop us up.  This year, we have a much, much deeper bench, but our star players are falling flat.   It's so frustrating because if both could click together we could be a lock for the playoffs.  But we the Kangz so something will always fail. This year it looks to be De'Aaron ""turnover"" Fox. Thank god for HB.   Go Kangz"
"2017: Sacramento loses out on Jayson Tatum, selects De'Aaron Fox (albeit in a timeline where Sacramento has their first Boston probably selects Tatum #1 and Sacramento still takes Fox or even Markelle Fultz)  2019: Boston selects Romeo Langford  Honestly as far as bad trades go, they got off pretty easy."
"De'aaron Fox is hands down the fastest, at least with the ball. Guy can fly."
De'aaron Fox has to be up there.
"Lol, this reminds me of how in like 2k18 i drafted De'Aaron Fox from a custom draft class and he ended up having several seasons averaging 60/50/90 and ~12 assists per game. We very well could end up seeing a player like that, and with the way the league and the pace of the game is trending, I think it's probably only a matter of time.  The Jordan vs Bron arguments are cancerous now, but just wait for the arguments of Steph Curry vs that guy"
PG: De'Aaron Fox  SG: OG Anunoby  SF: Michael Porter Jr.  PF: Tobias Harris  C: Deandre Ayton  Alternate (probably better) lineup is putting MPJ at the 4 and having Mikal Bridges play the 3.
"With all due respect, De'Aaron Fox is no Ja Morant"
I will never forgive you guys for saying De'Aaron Fox is better than Morant 🤣
de'aaron fox
"Perfect example of two things.  1) Superstars in the NBA are so hard to trade. Draft picks aren't nearly as valuable as the NFL. AD got traded for the rights to .... DeAndre Hunter. LOL.  2) The Pelicans rank up there with the Kings and Wolves as the worst run franchises in the entire league. I'll even go a step further and say they are the worst. They lost AD due to horrible mismanagement and will do the same with Zion. At least with the Kings and Wolves they can say ""we lost Andrew Wiggins and De'Aaron Fox."" Players nowhere near the level of AD and Zion."
"You're still hung up on 3 people out of 30 making a specific choice whether they wanted to be contraction, misunderstood the question, or were voting for their own guy. And I'm definitely convinced that they know who moves the fastest with the ball because they have combines specifically for that kind of shit and probably watch significantly more games than we do. Again, it's their job to literally look at this kind of stuff and make evaluations based on it. It's also common knowledge that De'Aaron Fox is one of the fastest guys in the league, and the fact that you're acting like this specific set of data is weird makes me question how qualified you are relative to the men who've spent decades as GM's and are wildly more qualified than your average r/NBA user. And the question is best pure shooter, not best shooter, a GM or two might have considered Steph ineligible because he's much more than just a shooter, similar to how he's not the purest point guard but the best one."

"22-year-old scoring a moderately efficient 24ppg.   47.5% from the field, 37.1% from 3, 57.3 TS%. He's not a chucker by any measure.  It's a very fair request.

If you're in that age bracket and you're in that scoring bracket, it's a no-brainer.  We're not even talking about a 5-year max either."
&gt;you shouldn't give a max contract unless they're a franchise player.  What do you consider a franchise player? Is De'aaron fox for example a franchise player?
"Blowout trade idea of the day. Just made impossible due to Brogdon's extension but I want to get thoughts on it anyway:   **Sixers receive:**   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  **Warriors receive:**  * Domantas Sabonis  * Buddy Hield  **Pacers receive:**  * James Wiseman  * Davion Mitchell  * Marvin Bagley  * Seth Curry  * Kings 1st  **Kings receive:**  * Ben Simmons  * Furkan Korkmaz  Sixers starting 5: Malcolm Brogdon/Danny Green/Andrew Wiggins/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Warriors starting 5 (by playoffs): Steph Curry/Jordan Poole/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/Domantas Sabonis  Pacers starting 5: Seth Curry/Caris Levert/TJ Warren/Marvin Bagley/Myles Turner  Kings starting 5: De'Aaron Fox/Tyrese Haliburton/Harrison Barnes/Ben Simmons/Richaun Holmes  Sixers flip Ben Simmons and Seth Curry into Malcolm Brogdon and Andrew Wiggins, fixing their roster construction. They're a better playoff team than before.   Warriors turn Wiggins and Wiseman into all-star Sabonis and flamethrower Buddy Hield. We'd have Steph/Poole/Hield as guards, Klay/Otto/Kuminga/Moody/Iguodala/Juan as wings, Dray/Bjelica/Looney as our bigs. That's solid top to bottom.   Kings flip two of their excess guards and a failed prospect plus a pick for Ben Simmons and a bench guard, it's a no brainer for them. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Simmons/Holmes is the best lineup they would have put out in a long time  Who says no?"
"Spurs: Probably  Pistons: Probably  Magic: Just signed a center, have Jonathan Isaac.  Thunder: Overwhelmingly likely eying a center in one of the upcoming drafts, just drafted Giddey, signed Shai to a max. Maxing Shai and Ayton would put them in a very awkward rebuild/compete position suddenly which doesn't really make sense with all the long-term moves they've made.   Hornets: Just drafted a center, already have a lot of money to worry about. Hayward, Rozier, going to have to pay Bridges, Lamelo in a couple years.   Knicks: Probably not. Paid but didn't max Randle, going to have to pay Barrett soon, maxing Ayton would pretty much lock them into a Barrett/Randle/Ayton core, which is pretty bad, especially given the draw of the Knicks.   Rockets: Just drafted Sengun and Garuba, who are both bigs that can't shoot. Traded up for Sengun and you can probably never play him and Ayton together. They also already have Christian Wood.   Kings: Just signed Richaun Holmes, paying De'Aaron Fox, you sign Ayton and then try to trade Holmes for? Fox and Ayton also aren't a great fit because Fox can't shoot.   Wizards: Probably  Blazers: Don't have nearly the cap space and not even going to attempt to clear the cap space for Ayton.   Mavericks: Don't think they have the cap space, and, assuming they haven't completely changed how they want to build their team, they want Luka on the floor with 4 shooters as much as possible. Don't see them spending a max slot on a non-shooter.   Celtics: Literally just paid Robert Williams a very team-friendly contract and not worth fucking our cap for Ayton."
"* Haliburton's play falls off a cliff. * Lakers are the 2 seed but a second round exit * Sixers play better with Tyrese Maxey starting at point guard than with Ben * De'Aaron Fox All-Star * Nets don't make it past the ECF, again * Bucks play badly to start the season, end up with the 4th seed but go to the Finals again * The Nuggets make it to the Finals * Jayson Tatum MVP"
"De'Aaron Fox, quick like a fox"
Feels like De'Aaron Fox is the most forgotten good player  Gets some mention in the preseason .......then nothing again
Chicago will be less than the sum of their pieces.   Colin Sexton may get moved.   Terry Rozier's last season was really underrated.   De'Aaron Fox should ask out of Sacramento.   Anthony Edwards is the first time KAT has had a legit co-star for more than a season.   Cole Anthony is really fucking good.
"Sure, the point is he shot 5% below league average.   To be fair, Luka shot 73% and De'Aaron Fox shot 72%. They all should be able to manage better from the FT line than non-shooter wings like Jackson, Okoro, Wiggins, etc."
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
"I think the BIGGEST problem here is Morey.   I'm sure they've gotten any number of offers that would make the Sixers better.   They would have likely beat the Hawks with ANY other starting point guard in the league (and likely some back-up point guards too).   FVV for Simmons. TAKE IT.   De'Aaron Fox for Simmons? TAKE IT.  Darius Garland or Collin Sexton for Simmons? TAKE IT.   They are ALL an improvement on Simmons. HE IS THAT BAD.  People will say ""But his defense.""  HE IS ONLY GOOD ON DEFENSE BECAUSE HE IS SO GOD DAMNED TALL for his position. If he were the same height as every guy he defended, he'd be above average.   I've seen that guy get embarrassed on defense almost every time I've seen him play. He's Gary Payton reincarnated or something. He's just a dude who has a lot of length compared to other point guards. Have him guard a guy his own size in the post and he's FUCKED.   &amp;#x200B;  But Morey thinks he's going to be able to get assets for him at a time when the rest of the league now knows how FUCKING TRASH this guy is."

"&gt;Coming off of the lowest-rated defensive season in Sacramento Kings history, the numbers don’t lie. Despite having a career year and a near All-Star berth, De’Aaron Fox was less than stellar on defense last season.  &gt;When Fox was on the court last season, the Kings’ defensive rating (per 100 possessions) soared to a whopping 118, two points worse than the previously recorded worst in history. When Fox was off the court, the team’s rating was rated 10th overall in the league at 111.8  [Source] (https://www.sactownroyalty.com/2021/9/28/22698636/sacramento-kings-deaaron-fox-more-consistent-defensive-stats). Fox isn't know as a two-way player. Maybe that changes, but I doubt Fox ever reaches Ben Simmons heights as a two-way player. Simmons will never be able to take over games on offense like De'Aaron Fox can, but the Kings have some other offensive weapons. It's the team's defense that holds them back."
"Day after day, Morey seems less and less competent. Actually, the whole Sixers organization deserves a black eye for how this is handled. This should've been dealt with at least months ago. Trade is an agreement between two parties. Yet Morey seems to go at it like he's playing NBA 2K. You don't get to be like, I'm trading Simmons but only if I get Dame Lillard, or CJ, or De'Aaron Fox... etc back. His worth is what the league agrees to pay for him.   And on top of all that, the organization lets his first-year coach (first year with this team, obviously I know he's been around forever) runs his mouth continuously (even let him go earn some imaginary brownie points at MSNBC by talking down the trade subject and drops his value down even more). Does Morey even know how bargaining works?"
Imagine De'Aaron Fox in the Conference Finals and the cowbells reigning down
"The answer should be either a wing or a very athletic guard as rebounding is the key here. That's why guys like Dame and Steph will rarely record a triple-double while, for Luka and LeBron who play as PGs, it's almost too easy. Therefore:  De'Aaron Fox is the first name that came to my mind along with LaMelo Ball. Jokic is an unusual Center who can play like a guard so I'll pick him next. Paul George, this season specifically with the expected high-usage, can be a regular triple-double guy."

Poor man's De'Aaron Fox.
"I don't think you fully understand how  hard it is to add 4 asts per game...there are much better passers than him that don't average 10 asts a game. To really illustrate how hard it is...In Chris Paul's 16 year career...he has only officially averaged 10 or more asts in a season 5 times. Last year's top 10 in asts, only russell westbrook averaged 10 or more and aside from De'Aaron Fox and Ja Morant (7 a piece), everyone else on that list are perennial all-stars...  It's insanely difficult. Simple as that"
"""De'Aaron Fox is the most underrated player in the game"""
"Trae Young 5yr / $207 Biased but 100% worth   Michael Porter Jr. 5yr / $172M Hot take: Will never sign another big deal, but not due to basketball reasons Just from a basketball standpoint I think it's an overpay. He was stupid hot last year and won't keep up the %  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 5yr / $172 Probably worth, right now an okayish max, if he improves definitely worth  Jamal Murray 5yr / 170M Not worth, he can give you 50 on some nights but on average is not worth the max imo  De'Aaron Fox 5yr / $163M Will be worth it  Terry Rozier 4yr / $97M Clowned the Hornets for signing him to 3/57, turned out he's good. Will be the better guard out if him and Lamelo for the majority of the contract and worth it  Aaron Gordon 4yr / $92M Imo slight overpay, but still an okay contract If he improves a bit, especially scoring wise he'll live up to it"
"No, it isn't.  Who do you think is more popular between Lamelo Ball and De'Aaron Fox? Who do you think is better?"
Who on this list (&amp; De'Aaron Fox) is LaMelo better than?
De'Aaron Fox grow the hair back out
"I like the confidence, but he's not quite top 5 yet.  Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, Jrue Holiday, (even) Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic, Jamaal Murray, Steph Curry, Chris Paul and Damian Lillard are all better.  You could argue he is a top 10 PG. He is definitely in direct competition with the likes of De'Aaron Fox and D'Angelo Russell.  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: Forgot Westbrook. Yeah, Morant isn't quite top 10 yet."
Well ya see Ja Morant has an exciting style of play because he's fast and hyper athletic. Meanwhile De'Aaron Fox is -
De'Aaron Fox sucks and his attitude is even worse. Idc if this is the wrong thread
That must be why De'Aaron Fox isn't getting calls either. He's notoriously jacked and strong and can rip everyone in half.

"They always struggle with efficiency. Dug this up from when I looked into this in the past about some guards. This was through their first 27 games, so a bigger sample of bad play and  more time for the guys I'm about to list to actually turn the corner so unfair to the current crop:  Trae Young: 16/3/7 with 4tos on atrocious 38/25/78 splits   DLo: 12/4/4 with 1.5 A:TO on 40/31/71 splits   Lonzo Ball: 9/7/7 on 33/27/49 splits   De'Aaron Fox: 10/3/4 on 41/30/68 splits   Jamal Murray: 10/3/2 on 38/36/83 splits  Throwing in some more guys now through 20 games(\~what today's rookies have played so far):  Darius Garland: 11/2/3 on 48%TS  Ant: 14/3/2 on 47%TS  One-and-Done guards are going to play horribly out the gate. We go through this cycle of being shocked every year. Stop being shocked. The guys who came out the gate notably well in the past like Luka and Ja are not only the exceptions, but also come from a different background one having played pros and other being a sophomore."
"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14. De'Aaron Fox   Honourable mentions (not ranked in order): Deandre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Tyler Herro, Scottie Barnes, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Gary Trent Jr., Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, RJ Barrett, Tyrese Haliburton  It'll be fun to look back on this thread in 5 years"

As a De'Aaron Fox truther it's infuriating to see him play this shittily. I'm not losing faith or anything but hopefully he heats up sooner rather than later.
"Fox was never way better than Ja.  That was a countercirclejerk to some ESPN dumbfuck saying Ja Morant is who De'Aaron Fox thinks he is. Which was definitely offensive and unwarranted, but not completely wrong. Ja's upside was way bigger than Fox's the moment he came into the league."
He's not criticizing the Haliburton pick. He's a huge fan of his. He's criticizing the fact that they picked three point guards. Davion Mitchell is the third point guard. He's not roasting the Kings for picking De'Aaron Fox either.
if cade's ceiling was de'aaron fox why did every team in the league want to draft him at #1???

"here's a crazy counter-factual for you: what if the Celtics didn't trade for Kyrie Irving going into the 2017-2018 NBA season?  They'd have the Nets pick (turned into #8 that season), the Grizzlies pick &amp; the Kings pick along with Smart, Rozier, the Jays etc.  Instead of trading for Kyrie, if the Celtics keep those picks they could've drafted SGA in the 2018 draft or potentially packaged the last Nets pick, the Kings pick &amp; the Grizzlies pick to Sacramento for De'Aaron Fox.  The Celtics then could've had FOx/Brown/Tatum with enough complimentary pieces left over to make some noise immediately"
"People didn't know Luka would be as good as he has been, but I'm pretty sure many people thought he'd be really good and if anything he would be miles better than Bagley.  Fit is important but it's also only something I'd consider for the top tier of players, of which Fox is not. You should not be basing your draft pick based on De'aaron Fox."

"Unpopular opinion but the Lakers would have been better off long term and still won a chip if they would have drafted De'Aaron Fox instead of Lonzo, traded DLo for more and built around Fox and BI instead of signing Lebron and giving away everything for an Anthony Davis to injury prone to continue a dynasty."
"Monk's lack of POA defense has always confused me.  Dude had a higher lane agility score than De'Aaron Fox while they were at Kentucky (if memory serves), has great athleticism generally, and has a decent awareness of where to be off-ball (even if he often tries to cover two defenders, instead of committing to the one more likely to get the ball).  It's almost like he doesn't take the right angles and always ends up on the driver's hip, which puts more pressure on the interior defender."
"&gt; His game is more consistent and reliable with less variance than the other stars you name  That is simply not true.  The numbers do not bear that out in the slightest.  Tatum, Butler, Gobert, Booker, and Brown all have MUCH larger sample sizes of performing at a consistent all-star or all-NBA level.    SGA has about 30 games of being a very efficient guard at about 25/6/6 levels and, outside of that and including all of this season, has simply been a good, not particularly efficient scorer with solid playmaking skills on a very bad team with average defense at best.  Not that different from De'aaron Fox, who honestly has a good argument to be ranked above SGA as well.  SGA doesn't belong in the conversation with Butler, Tatum, Beal, etc.  He belongs in the conversation with De'aaron Fox and Jamal Murray and whatnot.  Just a different tier, and not top 15."
"Walks courtside with a cane. Steps onto the court. Does a full court press on de'aaron fox, grabs the ball, refuses to elaborate."
"&gt;the league has done an extremely poor job of marketing, imo, their most entertaining player   Dude is in almost every NBA advert since his rookie year. Plus you have guys on ESPN saying stupid shit like ""Ja Morant is who De'Aaron Fox thinks he is"". I guess we could get more national TV games but not like they're ignoring him"

"Really???? I thought maybe someone like JB/JT+picks for Lillard. I definitely don't see Boston doing Fox + Holmes. As u said, JB is underrated but De'Aaron Fox is probably one of the most underrated player in the league currently"
What is wrong with De'Aaron Fox so far this season? Is his shot just not falling or did something cause that?
man de'aaron fox is having an absolutely brutal year.
"Kings - wow, we don't have a losing record. De'Aaron Fox needs to fix himself if we want a playoff spot"
Dude De'Aaron Fox has also been cheeks this season so far. It's freaking me the fuck out

"I wouldn't say they're getting snubbed. Like you said, there are so many all-star level players and only so many can make it in.  First player that comes to mind is De'aaron fox. Definitely an all-star caliber player but there are so many great PGs (or just plain guards) in the West"
"He's not better than Barkley's peak, duh. There are certain things he does better now than Barkley ever did, but peak Barkley is better overall than 20 year old Zion.   The scoring efficiency also has less to do with the era. The 4 other players his scoring last year is grouped with are Kevin Mchale 1987, Kareem 1980, Wilt 1967 and Shaq 2005. McHale had the advantage of being the 2nd option to a top 10 player, but the others, including Zion, did it with the defense focused on them. They are outliers. An argument can be made that this era makes it harder because you couldn't quadruple team a driving Kareem like they sometimes did to Zion. But I think that doesn't really matter. These were all massive outlier seasons in the era they played in Zion included.   But back to the Barkley comp.  Is Zion better than Barkley was at 20 and 21? Yes. Is he better than Barkley was through their first 82 NBA games? Yes. Comparing a second year player to the peak of one of the all time greats is pretty disingenuous.  Maybe he doesn't improve at anything from here on out, but it would be shocking if what Zion was last year is his peak. No one else in his tier of players has peaked at 21. But he's had one really concerning injury he already recovered from and a couple of annoying injuries. Maybe he never gets healthy. But that's the only way he doesn't improve.  And no, not every prospect has that 2% chance. Going off the Pelicans roster Kira's peak if he develops what he is good at will still never be Derrick Rose or Russell Westbrook, other super fast point guards. Kira's absolute potential peak is probably around 2nd or 3rd year De'aaron Fox, not even an All-Star.  Jax's ceiling is unusually high for an 8th pick.His floor is also unusually low for an 8th pick. The dude can be special if the game ever clicks for him. Also, and I didn't make this clear at all, even at his 2% peak he'd still be just below AD in terms of tiers and he'd likely never get an MVP vote."
