"PG: Luka, Ja, Trae, De'Aaron Fox, a future player.  SG: Jaylen Brown. Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Donovan Mitchell, Future player  SF: Jayson Tatum, De'Andre Hunter, Keldon Johnson, 2 future players  PF: Giannis, AD, Sabonis, John Collins, Kristaps Porzingis  C: Jokic, Embiid, Bam Adebayo, James Wiseman, a future player"
"Buying- De'Andre Hunter, has been great for the hawks 17/5/2 on 52/36/87 splits. love watching him play.  Selling- Donte Divincenzo, had a good start but has slowed down quite a bit. 9/4/2 on 42/30/83 starting to get salty about the Bogdan trade not working.  Hold- Tyrell Terry. my favorite prospect going into the draft. Hasn't really gotten any playing time since he's behind luka, Brunson and burke."
De'andre Hunter.
Jarrett Culver and De'Andre Hunter are rivals. Hunter's Virginia Cavaliers bested Culver's Texas Tech Red Raiders in the 2019 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game.
"&gt;lauded for it's depth  It's not as deep as 2018 or 2019.  2019 had Zion, Ja, De'andre Hunter, Coby White, Hachimura, Garland, Reddish, Cam Johnson, Herro, NAW, Brandon Clarke, Paschall, THT, Matisse, PJ Washington, Kevin Porter Jr"
"From what I've noticed:   Coby White up to 6-5 from 6-4.  Wendell Carter up to 6-10 from 6-9.  BI up to 6-8 from 6-7.  DMitch down to 6-0 from 6-1.  De'Andre Hunter is now 6-8,   Dwight is back to 6-10,   Ben Simmons up to 6-11.   Shai gained an inch (6-6).    Melo down to 6-7.   Derrick Favors down to 6-8 from 6-9.  Surprisingly, Shaq Harrison stayed at 6-7. Mentioning bc he said that he was 6-4 when asked last year.  Kuzma now at 6-10 from 6-8.  Again, possible that I missed people, I only checked the ones that sounded different to me."
"Pelican received Lonzo, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, the draft rights to De'andre Hunter and 3 unprotected first round picks. That's a decent haul considering AD refused to play and let it be known that he only wanted to go to the Lakers."

De'Andre Hunter has been an absolute monster so far too
"Why would the Sixers ever trade Shake Milton? He's making 10 million less per year than Kennard.   I could see the Hawks trading Rondo, but definitely not for Luke Kennard when they already have...  * Trae Young * Bogdan Bogdanovic  * Kevin Huerter * Cam Reddish  * De'Andre Hunter * Kris Dunn  * Brandon Goodwin   ...to fill out their their ball-handling wing role. Also Rondo makes 10 million less per year as well."
I swear most of this sub doesn’t even watch NBA games. How are you going to name De'Andre Hunter from the Atlanta Hawks? You can make a case that he has been the second best player on the Atlanta Hawks so far.   Embarrassing post.
De'Andre Hunter  He’s not going to continue shooting this well. Cam Reddish already fell back to earth.  Good luck Hawks fans. Be humble next time.
Not sure about Luka but I can see a good chance that the following superstars stay:  * Trae Young * De'Andre Hunter * Cam Reddish * Bruno Fernando * Brandon Knight * Kevin Heurter * John Collins

De'Andre Hunter heard y'all talking shit two days ago
"You're not looking at WHO we've been missing. De'Andre Hunter, Cam Reddish, and Kris Dunn have not played in months except for two games Hunter came back for. Those are our three best perimeter defenders. When we had Hunter and Reddish both healthy and playing we were a top ten defense. Since then we were like 22nd or something the last time I checked. You made the point that you hide a poor defender by surrounding him with good defenders. Well, we have done that. They've just been injured for months lmao."
I made a comment similar to yours down below. This guy linked an article that had Trae as the worst defender in the league last season to argue that Trae wasn't one of the top players in the league. I made the point that Booker was second on that list but anyone who wouldn't call Booker a top player in the league is stupid.   You're absolutely right. We were a top 10 defense at the beginning of the season before De'Andre Hunter went down. We have been missing our THREE best perimeter defenders for months. It'll be no surprise when we have those guys healthy again next season Trae's numbers will improve just like Bookers.
"Every NBA podcast i listen to has done 15+ minutes on how great de'andre hunter is and how he made the jump this year and atlanta found a real one and its such a disaster for the hawks that they lost their star prospect to an injury... which i generally agree with.  Yet almost none of these experts mention RJ even though his stats are basically identical with about 20 more games in a less talented offense while being key to a much better defense, and he's 3 years younger than Hunter, picked 1 spot ahead of him in the draft.  just seems like because he was a highly touted prospect in high school people decided he was a bust when to me he looks like a quality starter and fringe allstar by his age 21 season.  compare his sophmore season to beale's or tatum's.  this guy just seems destined to be an excellent pro who quietly gets better every year."
"I don't see how you could put De'Andre Hunter over Keldon, and I was Hunter's biggest fan at Virginia"
"[De'Andre Hunter, just now in the locker room.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSfpoSrCGsQ)"
De'Andre Hunter is a myth. Invented by Hallmark to sell greeting cards.
"This was my first time playing fantasy, long time gambling addict and degenerate so I knew a lot but I had some growing pains, especially in an 18 man league. I took KAT, he went down with his wrist, then covid, traded him and Lavine (rip), and Lamarcus Aldridge (dodged a bullet) for Beal, De'Andre Hunter (went down for the entire season pretty much for me) Divencenzo.. eventually I ended up with Giannis and Sabonis which has been huge for me; I've lucked out on a lot of waiver wire players, Moses Brown, Bruce Brown, Diallo had a hot streak for me, etc.  The easiest way to win in fantasy is to punt 4 categories. I try to go for FG%, rebounds, blocks, steals, and then the last one is usually a toss up for assists or t/o's (I have Draymond.. Dray+Sabonis+Giannis has given me so many assists this season)  Next time I'll be able to hone in on that fifth category lol. Sometimes I win ft% even."
"We just beat the heat without Trae Young or Capela.   Dont think Coach Nate has ever had our best wing, De'Andre Hunter play under him. Reddish is still out. Kris Dunn doesnt exist."
"Hawks gotta be up there. You're losing Trae, Clint, and JC.  LouWill, Bogi, Gallo, De'Andre Hunter, Nathan ""The Dark"" Knight, Kevin ""So Big It Might"" Huerter, Cam Reddish, Tony Snell, Okongwu all left over. Pick your poison"
"Since Nate Mcmillan took over, March 1st for reference, the hawks are tied for 4th with the Celtics in offense, and we're 14th in defense, Celtics are 21.   That's with de'andre hunter missing all but 2 of those games, he's our best wing on offense and defense. Reddish has missed all of them, he's our 2nd best wing defender. Dunn has missed every game this season, but theoretically he's our best guard defender. Collins has missed 9 games, Trae has missed 4 games, Gallo has missed 4 or 5 games, Capela has missed 2-3 games.  We've been incredibly injured and we're still performing well. I absolutely think we had a good chance against the Celtics if we can manage to get healthy before the end of the season. To call us just the 24th defense when all of our best defenders, other than Capela, have missed that many games is very weird, especially since we've made drastic changes since the start of the season when we ran a different defense under a much worse head coach."
i personally think  De'Andre Hunter  is more important to us than jc but jc is a good big man
"&gt; Bron was the consensus best player in the world at the time.   Not to MVP voters, and not for the better part of a decade.  &gt;Are you really going to argue that AD was fine with Boston?  Your link quotes anonymous sources.  Mine quotes Davis.  Try again.  &gt;, it was understood that it wasn’t a rental.  Rank nonsense.  ""Where he’s going to land? I have no idea,” Paul told SI. “And it don’t matter. We’re going into free agency. Why does it matter to me where he goes? Earth: We’re going into free agency. He has a year, he has to play. But after that, I can’t say it no bigger: WE ARE GOING INTO FREE AGENCY. 2020: ANTHONY DAVIS WILL BE IN FREE AGENCY.” --https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/anthony-davis-free-agency-2020-pelicans-trade-rumors  &gt;I don’t know why people think this...  Well, being as thoroughly stupid as you are, I am sure there's a long list of things that you don't understand, but I haven't the time nor the desire to explain them all to you.  And it wasn't 7 picks, either, which you ought to know, but obviously do not.  &gt;JA and levert are also a lot more valuable than Zo and hart were.  What a pathetic attempt.  You forgot the best player involved, and De'andre Hunter, who are both more valuable than anything Brooklyn traded for two years of Harden."
"You forgot De'Andre Hunter, too.  They'd have a ton of talent, but would require a clever coach to manage it all effectively.  That's a much nicer problem to have versus having insufficient talent, though."
&gt;Other than Zion and Ja I dont think theres anyone in that draft class with more potential than him.   RJ/Okeke/Rui/De'Andre Hunter/Herro are some players off the top of my head that I think has more potential.
"&gt;Agree to disagree.  My understanding is we got Lebron and management realized we had a championship window.  They saw the young core play for a few years and decided that wasn’t their best chance to win a chip, AD was.  I agree that is what happened.  &gt;There may or may not have been some other move to make, but Butler doesn’t compliment Lebron nearly as well as AD does.   Arguably true, but Butler would've cost 1/10th as much to acquire, so really, who cares?  And James can seemingly play with anyone.  &gt;Some people will see it as a bad move I guess, but you’re in the minority.  I obviously am in the minority, but that doesn't mean I'm wrong.  &gt;If we win again this year, are you going to admit it was a good move? Or will you still be on the “hasn’t paid off yet” tip?   First off, whatever the Lakers win in this and subsequent years is really irrelevant.  Davis was a UFA this past December, and could've signed with anyone, Los Angeles included.  There was absolutely no need to spend a decade of assets to acquire him unless you believed the window was just 1 year -- in which case, again, that was way too much to spend for one title.  That said, I would not consider two rings ""paid off"", no.  As I said, historically, the Lakers win 2.3 titles every 10 years.  And they traded an entire decade of assets for Davis.  Two titles would be getting close, but if it winds up being a title last year and this year, followed by 10 years of bad teams, I am calling that no better than a mediocre trade.  There are many variables.  Maybe De'Andre Hunter never makes it back from his leg injury.  Maybe Lonzo Ball never gets any better.  Maybe those 3 first-round picks all wind up being late-twenties picks in shallow drafts.  Those are all possibilities.  On the other hand, Ingram is already an All-star, and putting up better numbers this year than Davis is.  And Ball is still younger than, say, Larry Bird was as a rookie -- not that they compare as players.  And Hunter was posting 17 ppg for Atlanta, and hasn't played a full season yet.  If all three of those guys wind up All-stars, and a couple of the first-round picks are very good players, then that trade looks really quite bad.  &gt;Personally I’m ecstatic that I get to watch Lebron and AD for years to come, calf strain and all.   Hopefully Davis winds up playing more, and not an expensive disabled-player-exception."
"He's been playing *pretty good* defense.   He hasn't been all-defense level.   Both Blazers forwards have been better defenders. Both Suns forwards have been better defenders. Both Clippers wings are better. Harrison Barnes and Lu Dort and OG have all been better. Royce has been better. De'Andre Hunter has been fantastic. Oladipo's been better.   He's playing above average wing defense, that's true. But he is nowhere near a top two defender in the NBA at his position. That's moronic."
"There's been injuries to role players as well, they just don't get nearly as much attention. But Danny Green, KCP, De'Andre Hunter, Donte DiVincenzo, Alex Caruso, Will Barton, Serge Ibaka, etc all have missed time with injuries in these playoffs."
Their no.1 defender is missing. De'andre Hunter made Randle's life miserable and probably stripped him off a max contract.
"&gt;They need to get rid of David Griffin if they want to properly compete with Zion though. Horrible roster construction.  It's weird. I thought Griffin's first few weeks with the team (AD trade, flipping the 4th pick) were masterful...but he hasn't really done much since...and in retrospect, keeping the 4th pick might have been better if they'd have just grabbed De'Andre Hunter."
The Bucks and the Suns are the least injured so it is their championship to lose:   Bucks   * DiVincenzo out  * Bud brain damaged    Nets   * Kyrie sprained ankle  * Harden bad hamstring    Hawks   * De'Andre Hunter out  * Cam Reddish achilles issue  * Trae Young shoulder issue    76ers   * Embiid meniscus  * Simmons shooting stroke     Suns   * CP covid (hopefully he will be out of the protocol by the time they play the next round)    Clippers   * Kawhi knee issue    Jazz   * Conley bad hamstring  * Mitchell bad ankle
Hawks are missing De'Andre Hunter
"Nets.  They're already ahead in the series, they've got the best player left and they'll probably add another all-star level guy or even maybe two, whether it's Kyrie coming back to the lineup or Harden returning to form.  Everybody (even [the Hawks](https://www.ajc.com/sports/atlanta-hawks/after-deandre-hunter-surgery-hawks-expect-recovery-by-training-camp/ERZISRLSVJAF5AYL6R7XRQ6EAA/) lost De'Andre Hunter) have injuries, but the Nets have the most talent and the lead in their series.  I hope i'm wrong, even if it isn't the sixers that take home the LOB trophy but I think the nets are the favorite."
Pretty good coach. Always had bad injury luck in the postseason until now (and even then De'Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish are out).
De'Andre Hunter
Need De'andre Hunter
Does De'Andre Hunter count? I feel like he's already more known than a lot of these guys mentioned but I think he'll be competing for an AS spot in the next season or two
"I've watched maybe 5-10 games of theirs so I can't match that eye test but I would say that while you're right that Cam is more disruptive, more disruptive doesn't always mean a better defender.   The Hawks' defense was [6.9](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/huntede01/on-off/2021) points better per 100 possessions with Hunter on the court versus [4.8](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/reddica01/on-off/2021) points worse with Cam on the court. I'm assuming they usually play with similar guys so that's a pretty big difference.  Also, De'Andre beats Cam in every advanced stat and I think gives you better rim protection so more versatility on the defensive end."
"Why do you even need to bring up how ""casuals won't know that"" the loss of De'Andre Hunter is a major impact on the Hawks? I'm really glad you came up with a new way to feel superior to all the ""nephews"" out there lol"
De'Andre Hunter hurt and Hill pretty good defensively (usually) also can hit 3's (just streaky). He doesnt get starter mins when starting either.
De'Andre Hunter
"*Checks Embiid's stats*  39/9/4 on 12/21 shooting  Doesn't seem injured to me.  Also, De'Andre Hunter was out so the Hawks were the more injured team"
"De'Andre Hunter  not sure if he's unknown, but yall will learn his name soon...."
De'Andre Hunter.
"i swear all of you guys on here do not watch hoops, I work and go to school and still watch every team you guys just go on the internet and say dumbshit. Why the hell would you want De'andre Hunter a guy that was averaging 17/5/2 before his knee injury over fucking solomon hill. Were you born this fucking stupid?"
"&gt;It would be Lebron, Kuzma, Caruso, THT, DLo, Josh Hart, Ingram, Nance, Lonzo, Randle, Clarkson and Thomas Bryant; rest would be guys on the min.  You forgot:  * De'Andre Hunter, the #4 overall pick who they traded for Davis * Ivica Zubac, who they traded to make room for Davis * Moe Wagner, who they traded for Davis * Isaac Bonga, who they traded for Davis * Jemarrio Jones, who they also traded for Davis -- but is a G Leaguer who makes no difference, just mentioning him for completeness  &gt;Very thin on big men  Not so thin when you include Zubac, and to a lesser degree Wagner.  If they somehow had all those players, they'd have the deepest roster in the league by far.  Hunter and Zubac both routinely start for playoff teams, and you didn't even include them.  Their bench would be a playoff team in the East.  The huge challenge would be finding minutes for everyone, and getting all these players to mesh offensively -- both are which are parts of coaching that Frank Vogel struggles terribly with.  Luckily for Vogel, with the most talent in the league, there would probably be many good choices on how to play them, so he might accidentally stumble across a few excellent lineups."
De'andre Hunter about to eat that mans lunch unfortunately
"&gt;Rookies don’t help when you’re in win now mode  That depends on the rookie.  Magic Johnson helped considerably as a rookie.  So did Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  So did Wes Unseld.  Those are three of the most successful rookie campaigns ever, but many other rookies have been impactful.  De'andre Hunter is practically a rookie, and he helped the Hawks win tonight."
"De'Andre Hunter ain't even 100% healthy yet. The guy's going to super solid for years to come. Knicks shouldn't be too down on this, they exceeded the expectations and made most of their fans happy. Smart business moves this off-season and they'll be contending soon"
"I can't be the only one who has to think of ""Everybody Hates Chris"" (Tyler James Williams) when I see De'Andre Hunter"
This additional asset would not have made a difference but OP left out the #4 pick in the 2019 draft which was included in the AD trade. That pick was eventually traded to ATL and turned into De'Andre Hunter.
"&gt;James Lonzo and Butler with Ingram and Zubac is ... not a LeBron team I don't think. Neither Lonzo nor Butler shoot  Ball shot 38% from 3 last year.  Ingram shot 39%.  &gt;You'd have to put Zo on the bench and play Butler at the 2, move Ingram up a position probably and then trade for a 3  James/Ball/Butler/Ingram/Zubac is just fine.  3 shooters, 3 drivers, 3 distributors, 4 at-least-good defenders.  No 2020 team even troubles them on their way to a ring, especially with the ridiculous bench they'd have had.  And they wouldn't be trading for a 3 in any circumstance, since they'd have De'andre Hunter and Kyle Kuzma coming off the bench.  Their only problem would be trying to find minutes for all the players they have."
De'Andre Hunter is a bad man
Any reason why he's talking about De'Andre Hunter or did he mean Jordan? I can't watch the game right now
I drafted De'Andre Hunter in my fantasy league as a sleeper and the dude was killing it until his injury
yeah lol... McMillan hasn't even had who was our best player before his injury -- De'Andre Hunter.  I don't think anyone in the NBA world knows he exists.  I keep reading article after article about how Randle is going to cook John Collins when Hunter will likely be the primary matchup
"Honestly, it took me a while to figure out what you were saying and not because of poor phrasing on your part.  I believe that you're saying that Danilo Gallinari, De'Andre Hunter, Clint Capela should be listed along with Carmelo Anthony and the rest of that group, but the ""third best on their team"" would be either John Collins or Bogdan Bogdanovic."
its spelled Deandre. Jordan is spelled DeAndre. Hunter is spelled De'Andre. Bembry is spelled DeAndre'. Learn.
"Yeah, a big 2-way wing named De'Andre Hunter sized hole."
I got Terry around the sixth too. We had mini awards too so I won another $20 for best trade (I traded Saddiq Bey and De'Andre Hunter (IL) for Draymond Green right before he had like 20 triple doubles) and $10 for best pick for Scary Terry
"Who they would give up to get Beal, though? Probably  - Bogi or Collins to make the salaries work - Reddish - Huerter - De'Andre Hunter - A few picks  So, the team would be Young + one of Bogi or Collins + Beal."
Cam Reddish and De'andre Hunter are without a doubt the best players in the 2019 draft and it's not even close
"The Hawks hit gold in the 2017-2019 drafts.  * John Collins (2017, 19th pick) * Trae Young (2018, 5th pick) * Kevin Huerter (2018, 19th pick) * De'Andre Hunter (2019, 4th pick, moved up by trading up with New Orleans) * Cam Reddish (2019, 10th pick, obtained from Luka Traed) * Onyeka Okongwu (2020, 6th pick, TBD how valuable of a contributor he can be)  Getting Taurean Prince (12th pick) and De'Andre Bembry (21st pick) in 2016 could have gone worse, too. Real minefield in that draft, with Papagiannis (13th), Yabusele (16th), Baldwin (17th), Ellenson (18th), Malachi Richardson (22nd), Zizic (23rd), Brice Johnson (25th) lurking. That doesn't even include Dragan Bender (4th), Kris Dunn (5th), Marquese Chriss (8th), and Thon Maker (10th). Bruno Fernando has been a letdown, but he was the 34th pick, so expectations can't be too high.  And somehow, they have positive draft capital moving forward (i.e. didn't sacrifice their picks unnecessarily).  Having all these guys on rookie deals means they were able to sign or acquire a bunch of vets to fill in their roster holes: Gallinari, Bogdanovic, Capela, Lou Will, and Solo. Their cap also allowed them to act as cap relief for other teams. Schlenk has done wonders for this team since his 2017 arrival. He apparently also scouted Draymond when he was working for the Warriors."
Bogdan has a bad knee and they're missing De'Andre Hunter as well.
The Hawks had their own injuries though. Cam Reddish missed the entire Knicks and Sixers series. De'Andre Hunter has missed the whole playoffs.
"Lakers won a championship with AD while the Pelicans can't make the playoffs even with Zion posting some gaudy scoring &amp; efficiency stats. Lakers will do that trade again every single time, they honestly didn't give up that much.   Pelicans got the headline pieces of Ingram/Ball/Hart/Hunter + 2021, 2023 &amp; 2024 1st rounders. They later flipped De'Andre Hunter for Hayes &amp; NAW  Wizards got a bunch of pointless bench fodder (Wagner, Bonga &amp; Jones) + 2022 2nd round pick to send cash to the Pelicans."
"Just to counter, I don't think we played all that well today. We came out hot from 3 but it's still noticeable how hard Trae has to work to keep the team in the game with Bogi being hampered and without De'Andre to help out. Also our defense has been a step off without Hunter. We're really missing his length on the outside and letting way too many guys get open looks."
"Healthy hawks...they're missing De'Andre Hunter.  Anyways, this is moot. The Suns and Bucks have been the two healthiest teams; that's why it's most likely going to be the finals."
"There's a difference between being fatigued or sore and having a tweaked knee that pulled you out of the second half of a game. Bogdan has very, very obviously been playing much worse ever since it happened. That kind of sudden switch isn't a fatigue thing. Remember the Hawks are also missing our best perimeter defender (who was also putting up 10+ a game against the Knicks before he was listed as out for the year) in De'Andre Hunter. Saying a 100% healthy Hawks are clearly a worse team than the Bucks is just ignorance or favoritism."
"Injuries happen though, that's part of the equation to winning a championship. You not only need to play the best ball, but be the healthiest team as well. Even the teams left have injury issues. Kawhi, donte for the bucks, de'andre hunter for the hawks, cp3 with covid and the shoulder thing, even guys like trae, dbook, and giannis are banged up. Imo this year is one of the harder years to win one with the quick turnaround after the bubble."
"A little of both. We are also missing our second best player, De'Andre Hunter"
"Trae was stuck on a really really bad Hawks team for the last few years. Between Collins and Huerter developing, the signing of Gallinari and Bogdanovic, and the trade for Capela, he finally has a team around him that allows him to be the elite playmaker that he is. With a healthy De'Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish, this team should be a contender for years to come."
"If they play the Hawks, this will also be true (De'Andre Hunter)"
"Bogdan came back from a long injury absence and played incredibly well to close out the season, so that was sort of a change.   But they also lost De'Andre Hunter around the same time, so that kind of evens out in terms of roster assets. It really does just feel like significantly better coaching"
"Now:  1. De'Andre Hunter 2. Bridges 3. Anunoby  Future:  1. De'Andre Hunter 2. Anunoby 3. Bridges  Hunter looks to be the third maybe even second best player on the contending Hawks Team. Bridges is a more efficient scorer than OG, but I think OG has more potential on the defensive end especially now the game is drifting towards a power-forward centric offense."
"Players who have a chance this year that could join this list:   -  DeMarcus Cousins (LAC, 5th overall)  -  Kris Dunn (ATL, 5th overall)  -  Deandre Ayton (PHX, 1st overall)  -  Trae Young (ATL, 5th overall)  - De'Andre Hunter (ATL, 4th overall)  ---  So for this to not change, the Bucks would have to win the 2021 championship"
"If the Sixers win if Embiid is healthy, we definitely win if De'Andre Hunter and Bogi and Cam are also healthy.  Our wing depth is completely devastated right now but no one understands that because they're watching the Hawks for the first time all year... doesn't matter at this point anyways, but hopefully we continue to shock people"
De'Andre Hunter with Kawhi's defense and Kevin Durant's efficiency
"is De'Andre Hunter really your second best player?  I didn't really think so, but shit you watch more Hawks games than me so...."
Why does no one respect the hawks man... We're missing our second best player in De'Andre Hunter and now Bogdanovic is out. This post is infuriating for a hawks fan bc no one seems to have watched us all year...
"And the Hawks were missing their 2nd best player, De'Andre Hunter. Stop making excuses."
Lot of players with the extra 2 letters in their names lmao  DeMarcus Cousins  DeAndre Jordan  Deandre Ayton  De'Andre Hunter  DeAndre' Bembry  Devonte' Graham  De'Aaron Fox  LaMelo Ball  LaMarcus Aldridge  LeBron James  probably more I don't know
"I thought the way he played the AD trade and then later flipped the 4th pick was masterful. In retrospect, he still nailed the AD trade but nearly every move outside of that has been a dud. He would have been better off keeping the player drafted with the pick he traded (De'Andre Hunter). He did nail the Jrue trade as well, but then flopped with the Adams trade and super flopped with the Adams extension. So he's good at leveraging teams with MVP superstars into trading for his own team's stars and not much else."
De'Andre Hunter looks like he is going to be really good!
De'Aaron Fox  De'Andre Hunter  Jaylen Brown
"I joined this Fantasy Football league where you can play against Malcolm Brogdon, George Hill, Ty Jerome, Myles Turner, Garrett Temple, De'Andre Hunter, Justin Anderson, Joe Harris, Anthony Tolliver, Kevin Huerter, Diamond DeShields, and Victoria Vivians. There are still spots but you have to sign up by the 24th. There is a live virtual draft with all the players on the 26th.  https://www.brogdonfamilyfoundation.org/waterbowl"
"I'm not even a hawks fan, but I really want to see De'Andre Hunter (I'm a uva fan) or Cam Reddish break out. Atlanta needs one of their wings to really step up if they want more playoff success, Trae can only do so much. Cam had some really nice moments in this year's playoffs, taking over some points in crucial moments. There's no reason to think he can't make that a normal thing, and if he can then he'd be on a great trajectory for top 10. The hawks core also certainly has the position clearly carved out, just someone needs to step up and fill it"
"De'Andre Hunter, Rui Hachimura, Keldon Johson"
"De'Andre Hunter. If he can take that jump, Hawks could win and he could take FMVP over Young."

"I'm not disputing the fact that they had great offseasons. All of those teams got better, but so did we.   We were one of the most injured teams in the league last year. Honestly we should probably be talking about how we added De'Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish to our roster. Hunter played 23 games and Cam played 26. Even Bogi only played 44 games. We're also coming into the season with much better options at the backup 1 spot. Whatever positives Rondo brought to our team off the court, he was absolutely abysmal on the court. Staring the season with Sweet Lou and Delon Wright coming off the bench is a huge improvement for us.   Also, as others have pointed out we might as well be a completely different team with Nate coaching. I get that you can't just throw out our record under LP, but what we did in the playoffs proved that our regular season record under Nate wasn't some fluke."
KPJ and De'Andre Hunter ?
"Saw that Pacers' Malcolm Brogdon's charity is hosting a fundraiser where you can play fantasy football against NBA and WNBA players. They'll have a live draft event on August 26th. Right now the players are Diamond DeShields, Victoria Vivians, George Hill, Ty Jerome, Myles Turner, Garrett Temple, De'Andre Hunter, Justin Anderson, Joe Harris, Anthony Tolliver, Kevin Huerter, Malcolm Brogdon. https://www.brogdonfamilyfoundation.org/waterbowl"
"You can fill out the bench with Cuttino Mobley, Aaron McKie, Morris twins, De'Andre Hunter, Marc Jackson, and Derrick Jones."
De'Andre Hunter
"I understand the thought, but I think it's gotta be tough, recruiting wise. Like what are you going to do, refuse Devin Booker because you could get a guy like De'Andre Hunter or PJ Tucker?  Team USA has a hard enough time getting its stars to play as it is. Might get worse if you start refusing offensive stars in the league because of fit."
"The Hawks didn't have De'Andre Hunter or Cam Reddish at all, Trae had a shoulder injury, and Bogi had a knee injury that progressed the the point that he could barely play."
* John Collins -23 * Kevin Huerter-22 * De'Andre Hunter-23 * Cam Reddish-21 * Trae Young-22 * Onyeka Okongwu-20 * Jalen Johnson (R)-19 * Sharife Cooper (R)-20 * Skylar Mays (2-Way)-23  Hawks have 9
De'Andre Hunter with his fucking 15 ppg 1.8 apg vs Demar with 21.6 ppg and 6.9 apg? And you think De'Andre is better? U good?
&gt;you guys were a game away from being the 6 seed and losing in the first round if you're playing the if game  That's not even a logical hypothetical because Trae and Giannis' injuries both happened in the other series. Is the premise that they both happen in this first round series too? Is De'Andre Hunter available in this alternate reality?
Is De'Andre Hunter a joke to you?
De'Andre Hunter
"Fr people are blown away that plug and play guy was plug and play. He's 25, Rui and De'Andre Hunter are 23, and everyone else from that lottery is 21 or 22. For context, the last four 11th picks before Cam were Myles Turner, Shai, Malik Monk, and Sabonis. They're all younger than Cam."
"Kevin Huerter, Trae, John Collins and De'Andre Hunter are the players they need to keep at all costs. Reddish is disposal and has been kinda a bust in his tenure with The Hawks."
"The Hawks aren't blowing up their team for Bradley Beal. They're especially not trading De'Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish, who both have star potential"
Assuming De'Andre Hunter is in the top 50 that will be 7 Hawks in the top 100 👀
Give me all of your De'Andre Hunter stock. I think he's gonna be the #2 on a championship-caliber Hawks squad in a few years.
&gt;They are but the bucks were also missing another one of their starters.   Yall hear of De'Andre Hunter?
"I like to see Cam Reddish do well this year. He was okay/good during the playoffs against the Bucks.   De'Andre Hunter too, hope he gets well."
"&gt;Hawks have done pretty decent with late first round picks. We got John Collins, Kevin Huerter, and Jalen Johnson looks like he might be pretty good. If Detroit is rebuilding I think it would be wise to acquire as much firsts as possible and even if they don't want to draft late they can use multiple picks to move up in the draft. That's how we got De'andre Hunter. Jerami grant is good but Cade is so young. By the time he's ready to win I don't know how important grant will be to the team."
2nd team: Morant/Garland/Barrett/Wiseman/JJJ     3rd team: White/Sexton/Pokusevski/Williams/Hayes      A few guys like Hachimura and De'Andre Hunter miss the list because they've already turned 23.
"I like this one too, been thinking the same thing:   * They'll have a full season with McMillan, which will help them gel a bit more. Not only that, but they won 68.4% of their games with Nate last year, that's 56 win pace in a full, 82-game season.  * De'Andre Hunter will be back and healthy, people forget they were missing a starter who played like one of the best 3&amp;D wings to start the season.  * They brought back LouWill, who was a nice bench spark plug last year, drafted Sharife Cooper to give them some backup playmaking, picked up Gorgui Dieng (who's a reliable backup C) and Delon Wright (a really solid defensive guard), and they have a ton of high-potential guys like Cam Reddish/Jalen Johnson/Onkeya Okongwu who could break out."
"I'm not tossing out how bad Trae is on defense, I'm saying the on-court impact of Guard defense isn't close to offense.   Being a +6 on offense and a -4 on defense does not actually play out to only making your team +2 better, because that -4 can be mitigated in ways that offensive production can't be manufactured.  That's why I brought up the fact that Trae is in multiple of the Hawks best defensive rated lineups, and when De'Andre Hunter was healthy, the Hawks were a top half defensive team."
"You couldn't get just Ingram for that offer, let alone Ingram, Lonzo, and Hart, a top 5 draft pick in De'Andre Hunter, two more draft picks, a pick swap, and cash."
I feel personally attacked cause I've been thinking De'Andre Hunter can turn into a Kawhi. Or at least a mini me version.
"Last gm drafted him and with Casey as the couch it was a poor situation; Sekou was a raw prospect but Casey doesn't want to give guys the minutes to develop. Bad team or not, Casey wants to do everything he can to win the game in front of him. Then Jerami Grant, who plays the same position, became the de facto franchise player. Saddiq Bey is older and more developed than Sekou; his skillset is what you want from a role player, so he naturally jumped in the rotation.   Sekou also dealt with random injuries like concussions that kept him out and missed valuable learning minutes because of the pandemic. Remember that between March and December of 2020, he didn't play organized basketball.   His summer league wasn't good. He had a big game but for the most part he blended into the court. You're expecting more from a 3rd year player in summer league. On the other hand, he's still only 20 years old. For comparison: Saddiq Bey (22), Jalen Smith (21),  De'Andre Hunter (23), Brandon Ingram (23), Davion Mitchell (23), Chris Duarte (24), Tey Murphy (21), Ayo Dosunmu (22), Pascal Siakam (27). I don't think it's fair to write him off yet, but if he's going to grow it wasn't going to be in Detroit."

Gotta give credit to bogdanovic and gallinari for sure but you have to give value on at least John Collins and De'andre Hunter.  Collins been solid and has been putting up good numbers and could be a borderline allstar type talent maybe more. Hunter has been injured but prior to his injury he was balling out on both ends of the court. both are young guys with loads of potential
"Mid fantasy season I traded Saddiq Bey and an injured De'Andre Hunter for Draymond Green and it won me Trade of the Year in our league for an extra $50. I don't care what nobody says, this man puts up some insane stats lol"
Herb Jones looking like a young De'Andre Hunter out there.
You only have to assume that the player you're taking when you trade up will be good. The closest trade to that which has come to fruition lately was the De'Andre Hunter pick which appears to be a huge win for Atlanta.
De'Andre Hunter DPOY
"Hey now, give some credit to the packline prophet mr. De'Andre Hunter. He spent all night tucked between Luka's 2nd and 3rd chins."
"it was clear they don't know him when ppl were more aware of the fact Danny Green was injured in our series than De'andre Hunter, who is twice the player DG is at this point."
De'Andre Hunter. He was the Hawks' second best player before his injury last season.
that's reserved for De'Andre Hunter
"Under Nate McMillan, they went 27-11 with the same roster that Pierce went 14-20 with. So I think 50 wins is not unlikely.  Also, McMillan should have been coach of the year on that record disparity alone. On top of it, he didn't even have Cam Reddish or De'Andre Hunter."
East:   Sharife Cooper - Bogdan Bogdanovic - De'Andre Hunter - John Collins - Clint Capela 😈
Yeah and to give him credit he had a nice block on De'andre Hunter in the previous quarter
"Nickeil Alexander-Walker &gt; De'Andre Hunter  Jaxson Hayes &gt; De'Andre Hunter  So, yes.  In that deal Pels also got multiple second-round picks and major salary relief.  BTW, Nickeil Alexander-Walker &gt; Lonzo Ball"
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
Frank-Dennis Smith  Knox-Mikal Bridges  RJ-De'Andre Hunter  Obi-Deni Avdija  Wash on 2017. Both guys underpreform as Knicks  Bridges&gt;&gt;Knox RJ&gt;Hunter Obi&gt;Deni  So about the same.
2016: Taurean Prince ---&gt; Papagiannis                        De'Andre Bembry --&gt; Malachi Richardson  2017: John Collins --&gt; Harry Giles  2018: Trae Young --&gt; Mo Bamba                        Kevin Huerter --&gt; Josh Okogie   2019: De'Andre Hunter --&gt; Darius Garland             Cam Reddish --&gt; Cam Johnson  2020: Onyeka Okongwu --&gt; Killian Hayes   Uhh can we just have our picks lol
And without De'Andre Hunter. Deepest team in the league.
Same. Of course De'Andre Hunter also locked him up that entire game on top of an insane offensive performance which stuck even more in my mind  Edit: also Culver was 5/22 from the field. I remember cause I swear that he only made shots on Hunter's teammates
"if he's ever healthy, De'Andre Hunter.  I know he was the fourth pick but he's got crazy Kawhi-like upside if he can just stay off the injury list for more than a week."
"""Straitjacket"" Herb Jones: another piece in the Pelicans' trade haul for De'Andre Hunter.   Who might be better than Hunter all by himself."
Best - De'Andre Hunter clamping Luka Doncic  Worst - Everything since then
"Yo OP, your tables are a little messed up. If you put --- | --- | --- | --- between the header and the rest of the table, it will change it into a much better looking version:  Player|2021-21|2020-21|Diff ---|---|---|--- Damian Lillard|3.2|7.2|-4 Bradley Beal|4|7.7|-3.7 Trae Young|5.3|8.7|-3.4 Collin Sexton|3.5|6.4|-2.9 James Harden|4.6|7.3|-2.7 De'Andre Hunter|1|3.7|-2.7 Kyle Lowry|1|3.5|-2.5 Kemba Walker|1.2|3.5|-2.3 Donovan Mitchell|3.9|6|-2.1 Joel Embiid|8.6|10.7|-2.1  Well, I had to change the spaces between the numbers into | but it looks better that way, and you can even sort it based on the column"
"Fitz was so heartbroken when De'Andre Hunter had a turnover tonight. He's super-high on Hunter, apparently."
"&gt; Why would i be happy for anyone's team's success at the expense of mine?  As a fan? No reason.  As a commentator?  People bitch endlessly about the Warriors commentators, but they get genuinely hype for great basketball play no matter which team is doing it.  The Warriors commentators will say the Warriors fouled if they fouled, will credit opposing teams for great offensive or defensive play.  If the Warriors lose because an opposing player just went nuclear, they'll appreciate the great skill on display.  Sole exception is James Harden. If he's being a flopping bitch, Bob will complain about the flopping. The one time Harden beat the Warriors by playing great instead of flopping, Bob bitched about how he could be *this good* if he tried but he just flops all the time?  And honestly, I was thinking the same thing.  I can't stand commentary teams that are so homer they can't admit another team's player did something good, that can't just be like, ""Hey, 50 points and 10 assists, that's an amazing game by Steph Curry right there.""  Like earlier in this game Bob Fitzgerald was talking about how great he thinks De'Andre Hunter is and was *really sad about it* when Hunter turned the ball over. It's possible to be a homer commentator and still *appreciate your opponents as skilled basketball players*."
Let De'Andre Hunter cook.

"Sounds like you needed THE De'andre Hunter instead of the ""De'andre"" hunter.   Common mistake."
"76ers fans are talking about building packages for MVP or superstar talent and y'all don't seem to comprehend how shit most of your role players are. None of them have superstar potential. None of them quiet frankly have star potential. Look at what AD netted the Pelicans:  Lonzo, Ingram, Josh Hart, two first round picks and de'andre hunter  Lonzo and Ingram were top 5 picks and Ingram became an all-star. Hunter has been serviceable in the league and Lonzo is a really solid point guard. You guys think sending first or second year players drafted in 20s and beyond are going to be stars? Really? Fucking delusional homers."
They got way better on paper just by having De'Andre Hunter healthy. He missed the entire playoffs and he is one of their best 2 way players.
I may or may not be biased because I was a De'Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish stan when they were coming out of the draft and they've looked great to start the season.
