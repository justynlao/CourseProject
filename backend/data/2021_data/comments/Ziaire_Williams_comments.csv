"Not all lottery teams are rebuilding teams. If you were a team like the Pelicans and you believed Zion/Ingram can be your two future superstars, you would be way better off taking Davion Mitchell than some guy like Ziaire Williams or BJ Boston who easily can be the next Thon Maker."

Anyone but Ziaire Williams. Mocked around 5 rn and from the handful of Stanford games I’ve watched he’s barely a top 5 player on the team.

"I can see us falling back a bit. Its clear the FO feels no immediate urgency to win now. They are going to rely a ton on how JJJ comes back from injuries and how he handles JV's absence. They also are betting on Bane being their sniper of the future over Grayson ""the Apology"" Allen. And they will give time to see how Ziaire Williams complements everyone else.  But OTOH, i dont think they are done making moves, and the Grizz have overachieved every season with Ja, Jenkins, and Kleiman. And I dont expect next year will be any different.   But they can overachieve and still miss the post season. I think they sneak in to the play-in."
"Mixed feelings I suppose. We’re all sad to see jonas go but I personally have somewhat high hopes for steven adams. Ziaire Williams was an odd move over a guy like moody, imo. Other than that, everything is oriented toward long-term development so theres nothing to scream about yet."
"If Ziaire Williams makes it into the league, his stepback jumper would definitely be on my favorites list. Like, how can you not be into [this](https://youtu.be/VuMoCrHuwHA?t=129). Covers so much ground and that high shot arc is hot.   I recently switched to a high arc shooting form and shit is magic. It's also the only shot form that I can consistently hit shots outdoors with (and the indoor courts are closed so...)."
"Man, two top 5 picks should be good enough for a contender. Just gotta hope that JJJ becomes AD lite and Morant is MVP level, with scoring and playmaking all over the place. Not to mention Ziaire Williams: he CAN be that guy next to JJJ and Ja. Grizzlies draft good players, these can be their solid role players. That’s enough for a contender, just gotta hope for everyone to develop nicely.  On the other hand, I’m not too sold on Jenkins but I guess we’ll see. He, too, can also develop for this team. Overall, the Grizzlies are still young and JJJ/Ja are still due for extensions. Still too early to give up on them."
if I had to build an entire team and I had no other pieces I would only just go for players with development. I'd just take a swing on anyone who could become a super star and figure out the rest and just let them play. There's no reason to draft for fit at this stage just figure out what you have  So I would take  G Cade  G Jalen Green  G/F Josh Giddey  F Jonathan Kuminga  C Evan Mobley   Bench   G - Jalen Suggs  G Bones Hyland  G - Josh Primo  F - Scottie Barnes  F Jalen Johnson  F Ziaire Williams   C Alperen Sengun
Just trying to make you feel a little better but I think Ziaire Williams for the grizzlies is slightly more likely to bust out of all the top 10 picks this draft over Kuminga

"&gt; I hope They draft a player who turns into a complete stud.  Like maybe  they draft josh giddey or ziaire Williams and one of them turns into a  BALLER   I hope they draft a player, trade him for scraps, only for him to become a superstar in another team. I also hope he wins multiple championships with his other team preferably the Lakers. I hope Celtics continue to be mediocre for the rest of their existence."
"I’m leaning towards that. They seem to tune him out.  Tatum’s inconsistent effort makes me want to trade him but the fact is that at 22, he has put up some impressive numbers... and he could end up being a top 10 player.  Trading Jaylen probably wouldn’t be a good idea either as he’s only 23 and shoots with great efficiency and he plays hard and plays good D.  We need a coach who lights a fire under these guys and we need to get a player with enough potential to push Tatum to playing harder.  Ziaire Williams, Jared butler, Ayo dosunmu or josh cristopher - could one of these guys excel enough to push the Celtics above mediocrity?  The celts are so predictable on offense and need another guy who can create their own shot.  I’m sick of this shit!"

He has a really good chance to pull a BJ Boston/Ziaire Williams once he gets to college. Probably won’t fall as far as them but he could easily drop out of the top 5 by the time he gets drafted."
No Ziaire Williams in the 1st round?

"Ziaire Williams, Jalen Johnson, BJ Boston, who've seen their draft stock fall in college, possibly could've used the development that the Ignite did in Walnut Creek, which is another factor to consider"
"I just wasnt a fan of the Ziaire Williams pick. Duarte wouldve been a really good fit. Sengun is just plain good, and him next to JJJ wouldve been interestingly fun."
"I think Memphis do this for Ziaire Williams, that's the only thing that makes sense, that they wanted Ziaire in hopes that he would be a great fit alongside Ja who's a special player that you'll be building around. Ja's prime will start in 6 years time, and by then JV will be 35. JV is better than Adams but you don't lose a ton in the short term with Adams at the 5, but in the long term Ziaire could be very valuable and will be approaching his prime just 2 years apart from Ja"
"A lot of what’s puzzling about it is because we’re more competitive then we really oughta be for the age and mission of the team. Intentions of this team are to   1. Build something with well-drafted youth        2. Win  And so a lot of the trade and how it looks for us going to depend a lot on whether Ziaire Williams pans out into the 2 way shot creator he has the potential to be. In the meantime, yeah it looks like a really bad trade for us lol. Honestly just happy JV is feasting."
"Adams was on a two year deal, and JV had a year remaining with a desire to be extended (NO gave him two more years). The Grizz are thought to planning to eventually move Jaren Jackson Jr. to the starting center.  Currently the point is to move more of the frontcourt offensive load to Jackson. Adams was supposed to provide defense and rebounding, and some protection for Jackson. In exchange for taking Adams and Eric Bledsoe, the Grizz moved up seven slots in this year’s draft, publicly saying they had intel that their target Ziaire Williams would be drafted before their pick. They also received the Lakers 2022 first round pick.   Eric Bledsoe lead to a domino effect of trades.   JV was a fan favorite in Memphis, but the org had no long term plans for him (just as they have none with Adams). JV played most of last season without Jackson, just like so far he’s been playing without Zion Williamson.   The true measure of the trade isn’t now; neither team was in the championship hunt. The measure for the Grizz will be years from now and how Williams does and what happens with that Lakers pick. One of the key rotation players for the Grizz, Desmond Bane was the 30th pick in the 2020 draft."
"Nah bro, he's totally a monster and they really made the most out of trading up. Check this out:  10th overall Ziaire Williams, season highs: 11/4/3  13th overall Chris Duarte, averages: 13.1/4.3/2.1"
"Kind of depends on how Ziaire Williams turns out.   If he becomes the high level baller they think he can become, then this trade will look like it's worth it in the long run.   While Jonas is balling, he's already turning 30 soon and doesn't fit into the young grizzlies core."
"It's not a fleece if Ziaire Williams turns out to be special. That's who the Grizzlies made the trade for (or rather, they traded for the draft pick, Williams is just who they picked)."
"The discrepancy between Ziaire Williams and Brandon Boston Jr didn't really make sense, both were highly touted recruits with really disappointing freshman seasons but one guy got taken 10th and one guy got taken 51st.  I'm assuming Jerry West did it again."
It makes sense then if they were trying to package Dillon Brooks and Grayson Allen for a better wing - they need one to pair with Ja for the future.  Ziaire Williams will hopefully be that but he's raw as hell. Memphis traded up in the draft with the JV trade but apparently they were hoping for either Giddey or Wagner.
Ziaire Williams kind of looks like Swae Lee
Ziaire Williams  Floor - the better of Cade Cunningham/jalen green at their peak  Ceiling - if a KD with integrity and a Giannis with a jumper had a kid that turned out to be the second coming of Christ
"His TS% was subpar in two out of his three college seasons and didn't get good until he was older than the rest of his competition, he should not be expected to be an efficient offensive player in the NBA.  But a ton of rookies basically do nada to start their careers.  Of course, most don't amount to that much, but it is hardly unusual for a rookie to have bad efficiency.  Among other lotto picks, Suggs, Kuminga, Ziaire Williams, Moody, Jalen Green all have bad TS% as well and Primo hasn't even gotten playing time."
Ziaire Williams and Devin Vassell come to mind from the last 2 drafts.
Ziaire Williams. He clearly needs time in the gym (and weight room) but that kid has so much potential.

"So long as Ziaire Williams pans out, I see it very realistic that the entire top 10 become productive NBA players. I would have to go through them year by year, but that very rarely happens if it all."
They got 2 first round picks. 2021 10th pick = Ziaire Williams. And Lakers 2022 first round pick (top-10 protected).
"Out of curiosity, I wanted to see exactly what return the Pels got in return, so I tried to follow the trades:  - **CP3**: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, al-Farouq Aminu, 2012 Pick (Austin Rivers). Of these players, none re-signed with the Pels. Rivers was later traded along with Russ Smith for Quincy Pondexter (did not play for NOLA, due to injury) and a 2015 2nd (pick 56, Branden Dawson, traded to LAC for $$$). - **Anthony Davis**: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, the 4th overall pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), a 2021 protected first-round pick (did not convert), the right to swap 2023 first-round picks, a 2024 first-round pick, and cash    - **Ball** was sign-and-traded for Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, a 2024 2nd, and cash.   - NOLA would flip the 4th pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), for pick 8 (Jaxson Hayes), pick 17 (Nickeil Alexander-Walker) pick 35 (Didi Louzada) - as well as a protected 2020 pick, which did not appear to convert.  - Christian Wood was waived.  - **Jrue Holiday**: Return was Eric Bledsoe, 2025 &amp; 2027 first round picks, 2024 &amp; 2026 pick swap rights.  - Eric Bledsoe was later traded alongside Steven Adams, Ziaire Williams &amp; rights to Jared Butler in exchange for: Jonas Valančiūnas, and rights to Trey Murphy &amp; Brandon Boston.   - Brandon Boston would later be moved to the Clippers in exchange for Sacramento's 2022 second round pick (protected).   So in exchange for ""this crop"" the Pels got:    - Brandon Ingram - Garrett Temple - Tomas Satoransky - Jaxon Hayes - Nickeil Alexander-Walker - Didi Louzada - Jonas Valančiūnas - Trey Murphy  Draft picks picks picks:    - **From the AD trade**: LAL's 2024 first rounder, and right to swap 2023 first rounders. - **From the Jrue Holiday trade**: Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 firsts, right to swap 2024 &amp; 2026 firsts with Milwaukee, Sacramento's 2022 2nd round pick (protected). - **From the Lonzo Ball trade**: Chicago's 2024 2nd  Out of these, Ingram and Valančiūnas stand out, obviously - but Alexander-Walker is alright, and man that's a lot of firsts."

"Honestly I wouldn't feel that bad about it, even kinda positive about it tbh. We recently talked about it our sub so I'll leave you down here my thoughts!  I like it, really. What we mainly need is a PF that can play for a couple of years while our prospects at this position (Samanic+Future Picks) develop. Kuzma is good for this! He has a 2+PO Contract; he earns 13M, not that much and in case really tradable; relatively young; played under not that great circumstances; Pop and our development stuff can fix some stuff, Lakers' one is not great and it showed with other young players they traded away. I mean, defintely let's not consider him as a cornerstone of the franchise, he is not, but he can be a great rotational piece for us while better prospects develop! Also, I highly doubt the trade would be just Kuzma, but other stuff will be included. The 22th Pick alone would be awesome, imagine attached to Kuzma too! Also maybe another filler that we can maybe flip for a couple of 2nds, we don't have one in 2022 so...  We are not that trash. With guys like DJ, Derrick, Keldon... we ain't doing what OKC did, we will still try to win games. For example Samanic could start next year, but he is just not ready for that role yet, also we tend to develop prospects slowly in roder to avoid major issues in the future. Also, if we somehow these projects show they deserve more, then just bench Kuz or even trade him, he has a nice contract (13M, 2yrs+PO).  Yeah, I mean, you kinda know my ideas on this team and that I'm really high on basically anyone and I think they all gonna make a major if not a solid jump next year if we finally decide to part away with all our vets. DeMar, as much as I love him, really, I just think that wasn't THAT important on our team if we had Derrick. I mean, we will prolly be a bit worse, but not that much in my opinion. Consider also that defense and size was a big problem last year and without DeMar this will go away, not fully, but still a bit.  Now lemme be the GM for the sake of doing it, you know I like it lmao. So, we will now assume that the [trade](https://imgur.com/qxd8AUj) goes through. LAL get: DeMar DeRozan / SAS get: Kyle Kuzma + Montrezl Harrell + 22th Pick. We then decide to trade Harrell to the Hornets and we get the 57th Pick (via Nets) and the 2022 2nd Round Pick (via Raptors). We do this because we will get a big in the draft and we will play him. We know have the 12th Pick, the 22nd Pick, the 41st Pick, the 57th Pick. (sadly for you lmao) I assume that the player I will choose are available so in order we draft: Alperen Sengun, Ziaire Williams, Isaiah Todd, Ibou Badji. Sengun will immediately play off the bench behind Jakob. I would be surprised tho if Drew played over him at the beginning of the season and they shared minutes. Ziaire Williams had a really inefficient season with Stanford and has ton of things to work on so I wouldn't be surprised if he spent most of his time in the G-League and I'm a fan of it, it went really good for us! Isaiah Todd most definitely will play with Austin, he has things to work on too. Ibou Badji then is my favourite prospect in this draft (I even made [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/od6bo9/ibou_dianko_badji_15_every_highlights_13p_8r_7b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)/[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/odv548/ibou_dianko_badji_15_green_jersey_highlights_23p/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Highlights for the U19 World Cup), he has a crazy high potential for me and taking a gamble with such a low pick is the real deal, all assuming he doesn't withdraw and he is available. He would be a Draft and Stash in Barcelona. If he does withdraw, then idk, maybe ask something else instead to Charlotte or maybe just select someone else.  At the end, as you know I love lmao, here is the final table! I would be kinda excited tbh.  |*Starters*|*Bench Unit*|*Third String*| |:-|:-|:-| |Dejounte Murray|Tre Jones|*Brad Wanamaker*| |Derrick White|Lonnie Walker IV|Wayne Ellington| |Keldon Johnson|Devin Vassell|Ziaire Williams| |Kyle Kuzma|Luka Samanic|Isaiah Todd| |Jakob Poeltl|Alperen Sengun|Drew Eubanks ^(+Ibou Badji (Draft&amp;Stash))|  For minutes I would say the same things I said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)."
"SGA and Dort will be better, but you have to keep in mind who else will get heavy minutes next year.   -	The Thunder currently have 5 draft picks in this draft (likely consolidate to 3 or 4 by draft day). This will probably result in drafting 3 first rounders this year. Rookies VERY rarely play good defense/winning basketball. -	Poku, while hopefully improved, likely won’t contribute to winning basketball for another year or two.  -	Bazley is still a pretty big question mark.  -	There is currently no center on the roster.   So despite Shia and Dort being a little better next year, I think giving Bazley, Poku, Scottie Barnes, Kai Jones, and Ziaire Williams (just throwing out potential draft picks) all significant minutes will bring this team WAY down next year. I really don’t think it’s out of the realm of possibility that this team is worse next year than they were this past year (when Shai was healthy) due to all the “developmental” minutes going around. As long as there’s no major shakeups to the roster, I think this team is back around the 5th or 6th worst record next year (even with Shai healthy all year)."

"Hire Kenny Atkinson.  Draft Ziaire Williams.  Try to keep Lonzo for 18 million a year or sign and trade him.  Try to keep Hart for 8 million a year or less.  Bench Bledsoe.  Try to trade Adams for Horford (Pelicans get a big who can defend and shoot while Celtics lower their cap).  Most importantly, talk to Zion about roster moves and try to make him believe that you can build a contender with him as the star.  If he approves of a Lillard for Ingram trade package, do it."
"If Warriors want a project, I'd rather they take Ziaire Williams at 14."
"Moses Moody at 7 seems like the consensus unless one of the top 5 guys falls out of the first 6. At 14 I think it varies a lot. Some guys want Ziaire Williams, others want someone like Trey Murphy"
"Any one of Moody, Franz Wagner, Jalen Johnson, Sengun, Ziaire Williams or Kai Jones, in that order"
I like Moses Moody and Ziaire Williams. I think that Williams has the potential to be something special after a year or two of development. Moody is a solid day one player.
"I’d love to have Moody at 7th and maybe Kispert Wagner or Ziaire Williams at 14th. I doubt Wagner is at 14th, though  Kispert will be a great fit for the Warriors.   Someone on r/warriors really said Kispert is basically another Mychal Mulder.   So many bums on that subreddit"
"Post-lotto mock draft.

Lebron is talking about Ziaire Williams (Grizzlies 10th pick from this year) not Zaire wade.
"MVP: Ja Morant  ROTY: Ziaire Williams  DPOY: Dillon Brooks  6MOY: Desmond Bane/De'Anthony Melton  MIP: Jaren Jackson Jr.  Champion: Memphis Grizzlies (82-0, 16-0)"
"Yeah he’s 24 years old and was considered one of the more NBA ready high floor players in the draft. Watched him a lot last year he had no business still playing CBB, you look at him vs someone like Ziaire Williams and there was no contest."
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
"Are we talking about general draft prospects or guys who actually showed promise after playing in summer league and preseason? Cuz I really liked Ziaire Williams as a draft guy, but he hasn't shown anything yet. That stepback jumper is too sexy though."
"Low-key underrated bench.  Melton, Bane, Tyus, Tillman, Clarke, Ziaire Williams, Konchar.  Got a strong bench."
Man if we draft Jalen Suggs and Ziaire Williams we're set for the post Curry/Klay/Draymond era

"&gt;Why Memphis would do that? Brooks can help a lot of contenders  Precisely because Brooks and Anderson can help a lot of contenders, and Memphis isn't contending. Brooks isn't getting any better, and if Brooks is Marcus Smart, then you might as well send him to a team that needs him now.  They drafted Ziaire Williams, probably the most raw wing prospect in the draft this year, who they want to feed minutes to. They want a borderline all-star wing. A 3rd banana next to Ja and Jackson. They traded Jonas for Adams precisely so that they could develop Jackson further this year."
Ziaire Williams
"Look, the West is arguably as stacked as ever, but I have the Jazz, Suns, Lakers, Warriors and Nuggets going over .500.  Dallas I think their weakness of not having a reliable secondary ball handler was exposed and more teams will start to play more physical defensively that their offense will suffer. Kidd isn't necessarily one you'd call a defensive coach so their defense probably wouldn't improve either. And honestly, the only guy that can take a significant leap in my eyes is Porzingis because Luka is already putting up historic stats for a player entering his 4th year and he'd have to do put up even more unprecedented stats regardless of age for the Mavs to improve in a way that does not involve Porzingis. Their ""young"" players are already in very specific roles and Brunson is already too efficient that his efficiency will take a back seat even if he manages to get more points.  Portland I think will take a step back largely because they've just replaced a head coach on the longest active playoff streak with a first time HC. Their 3rd-worst all time defense will get better by virtue of getting rid of Melo and Kanter, but their 2nd-best all time offense is not really sustainable either. Stotts has a lot of flaws defensively but offensively I think he utilized them to the best of his abilities because I don't really think Portland has the personnel to run a ball movement-oriented offense.  The Clippers are my favorite team outside of Golden State, but for the obvious reason, Kawhi is probably out for the whole year. PG has also missed about 20 games the last 2 seasons and the year before that he had to injuries in both shoulders, I'm not trusting him to miss &lt;10 games. I don't really trust Reggie Jackson to replicate his playoff run, and although they have a really well-built offensive system, they just don't have enough big-time scorers outside of PG, Morris and Jackson that they'll be good enough to win 40+. They also seriously lack bigs.  Memphis just traded away their 2nd best player in Jonas Valanciunas for Steven Adams, 35-year old Rajon Rondo and Jarrett Culver, and they're going even younger by trading up for Ziaire Williams. For a team that's way ahead of the rebuilding timeline, they also have too many flaws and ultimately Adams is no longer a good enough center on both ends of the floor that his production will be a big enough minus compared to Jonas. Ja Morant will have to take a serious leap or his fellow co-starters Dillon Brooks and Jaren Jackson Jr. will have to be disciplined enough defensively and be a good enough threat from 3.  I have Minnesota making the Play-In but a team on a 26-win pace (in an 82-game scale) probably isn't going to improve by 16 wins, especially when they've underperformed compared to their expectations for basically every year they had expectations (since KG left).   Also, simply put, the West has too many middle-of-the-pack teams that instead of all of them going over .500, they'll balance each other out and fall under it to make a competitive playoff/play-in race.  This probably are opinions that many will disagree with and I'm probably gonna be flooded with downvotes. But this is a controversial opinion thread, and I might as well say it."
"You’re leaving out how we got two second round picks for him. In the last two drafts, all it took was two second round picks for us to trade into the 30th overall spot. Which netted us Bane two years ago.   The organization decided that Bane and Melton should be the main SG over Allen. Saying ownership is cheap is an absurd accusation. Every team has a certain cap they have to work with. Giving a 3/30 million deal to your 3rd best SG is not good cap space management, especially when you’re a small market team. And we just drafted Ziaire Williams, someone had to go or there would have been a log jam."
To say it was for the sake of being cheap is a huge stretch. It’s clear the organization rather invest into Bane over Allen and we already have Melton who was getting DNP’s last season because of the log jam. Add in us drafting Ziaire Williams and the writing was on the wall. Getting two 2nd round picks is a nice return given the circumstances
"Josh Christopher, James Bouknight, Jalen Johnson, Ziaire Williams, Evan Mobley  My thinking was to start with the best player from 21-60, since it's the hardest place to find talent. Then go with Mobley since he's the highest value C and it's the hardest position to fill using this draft. From there, you slot in the BPA for each segment.   For 21-60, I went with Josh Christopher, but I could be sold on Cam Thomas or Miles McBride, maybe even Sharife Cooper. Just the highest ceiling guard in that range (deepest position overall)."
"I would argue that Kyle Anderson is better than Pat Bev. Yves Pons is on an exhibit 10 deal. Sean McDermott is currently on a two-way deal. It would be unreasonable to consider either of those players to be ""on their roster"". Xavier Tillman is mostly a Center, so he's not really a guard/forward.   I'll agree that Pat Bev is better currently than Sam Merrill, John Konchar, and Ziaire Williams, so he's better than 3/10 of the G/Fs currently on the Grizzlies roster. But now we're talking about dudes that are out of the rotation, and if they aren't playing anyway, I'd rather have youth sitting on the bench than a 33 year old dude."
Ziaire Williams
"I gotcha. I think the I would keep my top 4 in that same order, but I’d give all of Wiseman (purely on potential), Patrick Williams, Kuminga, Ziaire, and Bouknight a decent amount of consideration"
I don't get how Sengun even fell to 16. Taking Ziaire Williams at 10 in comparison is a crime
"1. The Grizzlies took on bad salary (Bledsoe) for a future first, and moved up in the draft plus got Adams for JV.     That's a perfect trade for a team like the Grizzlies who aren't going to make a splash in free agency but have a good track record in recent years of drafting well - particularly late in the draft. They got value back for JV (who himself was value for Marc Gasol at 34 years old) who didn't fit the team's style, age or cap situation (he's, slow, clogs the paint, 28 and an expiring contract). They can play Adams less than JV, and he does most of what we relied on JV to do. Set screens and rebound.    2. We also traded Allen for 2 seconds   He's in a contract year and creates a log jam at SG.  3. Drafted Ziaire Williams and Santi Aldama.  I won't throw who we drafted into the discussion as all rookies have bust potential, so it isn't really fair to judge who teams drafted."
"&gt;Charlotte Hornets President of Basketball Operations &amp; General Manager Mitch Kupchak announced today that the team has acquired Wes Iwundu, a protected 2022 first-round draft pick and cash considerations from the New Orleans Pelicans and the draft rights to Tyler Harvey from the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for sending guard Devonte’ Graham to New Orleans as a part of a three-team trade. In the deal, New Orleans also acquired Jonas Valuncianas as well as the draft rights to Trey Murphy and Brandon Boston. Memphis received Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe, the draft rights to Ziaire Williams, the draft rights to Jared Butler and a protected 2022 first-round draft pick from New Orleans (via the Los Angeles Lakers). "
Not strange once you see your rookies Santi Aldama and Ziaire Williams.
"Mobley is behind silver. Ziaire Williams who is next to Mobley was measured at the official NBA combine and was listed at a legitimate is 6’8 without shoes on, Mobley is noticeably taller than him.   When looking at that picture and knowing the 100% accurate heights of some of those guys, the height of Adam silver who is 6’3, and the fact that some of them are behind/ in front of each other you can’t tell me with a straight face that green is actually 6’6"
"&gt;It's Ziaire Williams easily. How many times have we seen the highly-touted HS prospect who disappoints in college but still gets drafted too high based on his ""potential"".  You could apply this same logic to Kuminga"
Ziaire Williams or Franz Wagner.
"It's Ziaire Williams easily. How many times have we seen the highly-touted HS prospect who disappoints in college but still gets drafted too high based on his ""potential"". That's what Ziaire looks like to me. No disrespect intended, I won't be rooting against the kid obviously, but it just feels like we've been here before.  Honourable mention to Josh Giddey, who's only NBA-level skills are court vision and passing."
Scottie Barnes/Ziaire Williams - Bust  Jalen + Cade - ROTY
Ziaire Williams
1. Cade Cunningham 2. Jalen Green 3. Evan Mobley  4. Scottie Barnes  5. Jalen Suggs  6. Josh Giddey  7. Jonathan Kuminga  8. Franz Wagner  9. Davion Mitchell  10. Ziaire Williams
No idea why they picked Mitchell either lol. Could have taken Moses Moody or Ziaire Williams or some other good wing. Kangz I suppose.
"Ziaire Williams over Jaylen Brown, Bam, Jalen Suggs, Ingram, RJ, Chet and Kyrie?"
"Ziaire Williams over Jaylen Brown, Bam, Jalen Suggs, Ingram, RJ and Kyrie?"
"If you think Ziaire Williams is the 10th best prospect in this draft, Idk what to tell you.   Cope however you got to i guess."
Zhaire Smith? Ziaire Williams?
"I literally don’t know who the fuck Ziaire Williams is.  Our #10 pick might magically be Kevin Durant and win ROTY, or he might play 7 minutes per game and average 0/3/1   I have no idea what the hell our new rookie is"
"The Grizzlies weren’t going to re-sign Jonas either though. Trading up for 10 gives theoretically gave the Grizzlies the possibility to be aggressive enough to move up more, way more than 17 ever could’ve, and they were able to net as good of a future 1st as they likely could’ve gotten otherwise by trading JV to a contender.  No moves up past 10 were seemingly possible for a price the Grizz would pay, and otherwise the other guys simply didn’t fall to 10. Trading to 10 did give the Grizzlies a much more realistic chance of moving up deeper into the top 10, and it did basically guarantee a 90+% chance of Williams being there. The Grizzlies clearly preferred Ziaire to Bouknight, Duarte, Moody, and Kispert too if nothing else, and there’s a lot to suggest he wouldn’t have been there at 17. It’s a move the Grizzlies made in hopes of maybe being more aggressive, and the worst case scenario was still getting a guy they want who wouldn’t have been available at 17. Hell, he *may* not have been available past 11 or 12..."
"With Tillie and Porter, I don't understand the Santi pick. If he is better than them then of course that's a good signing, but otherwise I'm a bit hesitant.  Ziaire Williams is a very good upside pick."
picks 6-10 were basically identical value wise so I understand why the Grizz wouldn’t do that.  I actually really think Warriors should have drafted Ziaire Williams over Kuminga too.
"Brandon Boston is wrong, Ziaire Williams is wrong, Isaiah Todd is wrong, Miles McBride is wrong, JT Thor is wrong, Jared Butler is wrong, Greg Brown is wrong, Balsa Kopravica is wrong. I don't think there are many accurate teams on his list lol."
"Woj doesn’t have sources? MTII also:    *They were ready to take Arkansas' Moses Moody at No. 7. But as the whispers suggested, Jonathan Kuminga, once considered a top-five pick, was sliding a bit. When Kuminga fell to the Warriors, they went ahead and jumped on the good fortune. The picks of Josh Primo and Ziaire Williams pushed some of their desire players down the board. Moody fell right to them. Based on their board, they essentially got two top-seven picks.*"
As of today: Zion Williamson (Pels) and Ziaire Williams (drafted by Pels and traded to Magic)
"**PG:** Ja Morant, De'Anthony Melton, Tyus Jones.   **SG:** Dillon Brooks, Desmond Bane, Grayson Allen.   **SF:** Kyle Anderson, Ziaire Williams.  **PF:** Jaren Jackson Jr, Brandon Clarke, Santi Aldama.   **C:** Steven Adams, Xavier Tillman.   That's excluding Bledsoe."
Why does Ziaire Williams get a pass for his college play but BJ Boston doesn’t?
I was excited about Zion Williamson and Ziaire Williams together until they told me he was already traded. Zi Williams x2 for the win
"If Williams fills out his frame and continues to improve as a shooter over the next few years this could be really good for the Grizzlies. There's definitely some real potential downside here though, but luckily Ziaire won't have as much pressure on him to become a super dangerous scorer next to Ja and JJJ."
"Lots of surprises so far. Toronto passing on Suggs, Kuminga to Golden State, Davion Mitchell to Sacramento, and Ziaire Williams going top 10"
Ziaire Williams looks like a skinny Robert Horry

"Yeah i don’t doubt that they’re floating packages of Reddish and 20 to move up, but what I don’t get is Sharpe being the target. I could see someone like Trey Murphy or Ziaire Williams if they don’t think he’ll fall to them, but not a big."
Moses Moody and Ziaire Williams
"Ziaire Williams, Bones Hyland, Trey Murphy III"
"If he goes 14 or below, Ziaire Williams. He just screams ""future 2 way superstar wing"" that fell due to external circumstances."
"If I’m a Magic fan, Ziaire Williams"
"Clarke doesn't even fit the TPE. Warriors would have to throw in players to get him, while Bane fits the TPE (2.5 mil + 100k). The problem with Bane is that the Warriors are super crowded in the backcourt already. They only do this if they don't plan to draft Moody/Bouknight/Duarte or think its a big upgrade from Lee. On paper, it's a nice move, but in the Warriors' context, you'd want a vet to fill that spot. Though getting Wagner with the 10th and like Ziaire Williams/Jalen Johnson at 14 would be really cool."

I never knew you were supposed to use your glutes when you shoot until I watched his video on Ziaire Williams. My shooting form was super inconsistent and now it's the best it has ever been. It also turned me into a good free throw shooter overnight. Went from ~70% to 85%+.
"Thats a long video, what exactly did he say? Because they have had a lot of players workout for them.   &gt;Among likely first-round picks, the Warriors have worked out Florida’s Tre Mann, G League Ignite’s Isaiah Todd, LSU’s Cameron Thomas, Arkansas’ Moses Moody, Duke’s Jalen Johnson, Texas’ Kai Jones and Baylor’s Davion Mitchell.  &gt;On Friday, Tennessee’s Keon Johnson, Oregon’s Chris Duarte, Gonzaga’s Corey Kispert, Virginia’s Trey Murphy III and Stanford’s Ziaire Williams will work out in front of the Warriors brass."
yeah I was mad when we didn't trade our old guys but Im happy with whoever we take as long as it's someone with upside. I trust our development to work on anyone who really wants to succeed. that's why I wouldn't hate trading down with OKC and taking BPA/whoever is sliding and Ziaire Williams for upside.
"Last year definitely looks to be a great draft class, but I think the overall level of players in this years draft is better than last years. You have players like Tre Mann, Ziaire Williams, and Jared Butler mocked in the twenties right now. I guess we'll find out in a couple of years."
So beware ziaire Williams then
"Ziaire Williams will be a top 5 player from the draft when we look back at it in like 7 years. I don't actually believe that, but he has a really pretty jump shot even if it's not all that efficient. I think the added strength and flexibility, along with him growing into his body will cause him to take a leap in year 2 or 3. He's definitely one of the higher upside dudes in the draft."
"Kuminga, Ziaire Williams for instant success."
How have you been looking through the Warriors sub and not have Ziaire Williams as the 14th pick?
