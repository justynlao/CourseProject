Elijah Hughes
"We're up 40 at the half, I can't envision us playing our key rotation too much. The single game record will be in the hands of:  - Elijah Hughes  - Matt Thomas  - Miye Oni"

"For some perspective on just how good NBA guys are compare to college, here is what the roster of the Salt Lake City Stars, a team that is currently 2nd to last in the G-League with a 4-11 record consists of:  Tyler Bey: 1st Team All Pac-12  Trevon Bluiett: Consensus all-American, 1st team all-Big East  Jarrell Brantley: First team all-CAA  Yogi Ferrell: First team all-B1G,   Trent Forrest: 2nd team all-ACC  Romaro Gill: Big East DPOY  Elijah Hughes: 1st team all-ACC  Malcolm Miller: 2nd team all-Patriot League  Trevon Scott: 1st team all-AAC, AAC DPOY  And again, these guys have all improved since they earned these college accolades yet they combined are still the 2nd worst team in the G-League. Now imagine what the best teams in the G-League have. And now imagine what NBA teams have. No college team is coming close to beating an actual NBA team."
Shout out Elijah Hughes for the 1 assist and +/1 of -1
"The Jazz likely protect Mitchell, Gobert, Bogdanovic, O'Neale, Clarkson, Ingles, Favors, and Oni. Niang and Conley aren't under contract next year.  Trent Forrest has played the most minutes outside of those named. Matt Thomas is probably the best bet. Elijah Hughes has huge potential but has barely played and was hurt for part of the season, same with Azubuike."
"When they're all together on the court, they're bad (and that's also because the offense is ran then by a 2nd rd rookie PG who has no reliable outside shot). When one or two of them are playing with 2nd or 1st unit, a few of them look decent. Oni has shown most flashes, Morgan and Brantley could be serviceable in short bursts (although I expected more from Morgan this season after last year's bubble play), I have minimal hope for Forrest progressing into aything more than a 3rd string borderline NBA/G-league point guard.  I really don't see Niang-like story happening with Matt Thomas and I have no clue what to think of Elijah Hughes and Dok in the next two seasons. Dok could be a great 3rd C in short bursts, I feel."
"Not really, I just wanna see our garbage time guys play more. Elijah Hughes has a wet jumper and i wanna see it splash. Also heard there was a dokter appointment tomorrow that is promising some big dunks and spicy blocks (Udoka Azubuike)"
"The only names I recognize on this Jazz roster are Chealey (G-league journeyman), Justin Patton (big fall from grace), and MaCio Teague (2021 Undrafted). I've seen Malik Newman's and Jarell Martin's names before, too. However, the likelihood any of these guys end up in the G-league, let alone the NBA, is slim.  Jazz White has some of our roster guys, including Juwan Morgan (potential stretch 5 and on our main roster), Elijah Hughes (2nd round pick in 2020 and on our main roster), Jarrell Brantley (2nd round pick in 2019 and two-way last season), Udoka Azubuike (1st round pick in 2020, was our 3rd string center but got injured), and Trent Forrest (PG on a two-way with us last season). Other names I recognize include Dakota Mathias (was on the National Team practice squad) and Jawun Evans (played for Clippers a couple years ago). These guys are definitely much closer to being on rosters than the guys on Jazz White.  FYI, the Jazz White squad is playing against the Spurs summer league team now."
"There’s a difference between creating your own shot in college and creating it in the NBA. I prob watched 5-6 Oregon games last year and I agree that he was a great college player. His defense is fine and he prob won’t be liability in the nba, but Oregon played a gimmick zone. Im a Syracuse fan and he feels like a very similar prospect to Elijah Hughes last year—older, skilled shooters who thrived in zone defenses. Duarte was more efficient, but a lot of that was a function of circumstance."
2016: Henry Ellenson becomes Malik Beasley; Michael Gbinijie becomes  Georges Niang  2017: Luke Kennard becomes Donovan Mitchell  2018:  Bruce Brown becomes Justin Jackson; Khyri Thomas becomes Isaac Bonga  2019: Sekou Doumbouya becomes Chuma Okeke; Deividas Sirvydis becomes Daniel Gafford  2020: Killian Hayes becomes Obi Toppin; Isaiah Stewart becomes Aleksej Pokusevski; Saddiq Bey becomes Precious Achiuwa; Saben Lee  becomes Elijah Hughes.  \---  We won as soon as we got Donovan Mitchell.
