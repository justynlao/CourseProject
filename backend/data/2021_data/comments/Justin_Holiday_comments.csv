"His high-school run with his brothers, with him and Lamelo making the NBA (same with Onkeyu-Chino Hills Center and 6th pick in the draft). It’s something a movie can have as it’s plot line. Not a big fan of him personally, but I would love to see two brothers team up and have the Keys to a team. Holiday (Aaron and Justin) and Lopez Bros (last year) are not good enough to get the keys. Giannis is a star and his brothers just on the team cause of him. Would be a unique experience."
"Exactly.  I also didn't include guys like Jeremy Lin, Seth Curry, Bazemore and Justin Holiday as they really didn't get much playing time with us.  We would also have to look at guys who didn't pan out such as James Michael McAdoo, Jordan Bell and Festus Ezili.  I really think Javale is the best example.  Player who wasn't doing well, came here and got some big contracts after he left.  I love Javale, btw!"
Justin Holiday.      He finally came to a good team and has been balling out. He's legit the perfect bench player.      We got him at the 11th hour of free agency last season and got him for 4mil and he averaged 8ppg on 40.5% from 3 with great defense. He then turned down the Lakers (apparently) to stay at Indiana of a 3yr/18mil deal and is averaging 11ppg on 41.5% from 3 with great defnse.
Yeah but really towards us.  We missed free throws but that Justin Holiday call was so stupid.  The most clear foul I’ve ever seen and it was somehow your ball.  So stupid.
"Sabonis, Turner, Brogdan, Lavert, Warren, Justin Holiday, Aaron Holiday, Doug, McConnell, so McConnell off the top of my head, but could be forgetting someone or be off on the actual rotation."
Idk Justin Holiday? TJ McConnell?
"They’re also starting Doug McDermott, Edmond Sumner and Justin Holiday. It’s nowhere near a typical starting lineup"
Aaron and Justin Holiday.  /thread
"Dame, Brogdon, Justin Holiday/Derick Jones Jr, Robert Covington, Sabionis. This team would play so well."
Brogdon can play the 2!  PG: Dame / Aaron Holiday / TJ McConnell  SG: Malcolm Brogdon / Gary Trent Jr. / Nassir Little   SF: DJJ / Justin Holiday / Rodney Hood  PF: RoCo / Doug McDermott / Melo  C: Sabonis / Kanter / Giles   We couldn't anchor the paint to save our lives but hey we can surround Sabonis with shooters.
"A team being significantly better 4-8 makes a world of difference come playoff time, especially considering that the given the chemistry issues and the fit issues that the Nets have with their top 3 (if kyrie doesnt retire, top 2 if he does), the Bucks/Heat/Celtics/76ers are all close enough top end wise that having much better depth would more than make up for the difference  You can hype up the Nets scrubs all you want, but Harris is no better than DiVincenzo, Seth Curry, Duncan Robinson, Justin Holiday, KCP, Bojan Bogdanovic, Mikal Bridges, Trent Jr, etc etc etc  And even if Harris was a hair better than any of those guys, which again he's not, each of those teams are sooo much better 5-8 that it isn't even comparable. Bruce Brown, Shamet, TLC, Chiozza are all players that only see playing time because of how bad the depth is on the Nets. Okay maybe Brown would get bench time on other teams, but even that is stretching  I'm not grasping at anything. I'm literally spitting facts of why the Nets are not title contenders as currently constructed, and I have evidence to back it up considering that they struggled to beat the worst team in the league yesterday  Keep spinning the facts, whatchu got next?"
"We're starting Edmund Sumner, Justin Holiday, and Doug McDermott. You'll be fine"
Justin Holiday is like the best bargain role player in the league
Justin Holiday is getting paid 6 million this year to do what Danny Green and KCP are doing for 2-3x the price
"This also shows just how excellent of an offensive player mcdermott is, his IQ, movement and inside out scoring force EVERY team to try and blow up his option on the play and creates so much for players like Sabonis, Justin Holiday and McConnell"
"Yeah the warriors guys are so annoying. They kept going on and on about myles and Justin holiday not having good 3% and its like bruh they're both high 30s career shooters, maybe stop being so surprised.   And all that while Kelly oubre shot 50% from 3, talk about that miracle instead lol"
"When the Warriors squad had **Festus** Ezeli and Justin **Holiday** on the same team, everyday was like Christmas."
How's Justin Holiday been? Miss his days as a rook with us.
Why would Justin Holiday contest Oubre so tightly? Lmao
"Pardon my ignorance, but is Justin and Aaron Holiday related to Jrue Holiday?"
"Doesn't help we lost Warren so either Aaron or Justin Holiday have to start, McConnell has missed a couple of games in a row due to him having a baby, Goga who is meant to be out backup 5 is injured plus we have Lamb to return from injury to help our bench out."
This was a random play from last night but [this is an obscene pass](https://go.nba.com/2nai) the window here is non existent especially to get it through Justin holiday. Wasn’t a fluke either he saw it the whole way.
shoutout holiday justin for being a great fantasy pickup for me
"Are the results not significantly better too?  It's a small sample size but they have improved from 19th to 4th in Offensive Rating, while only dropping from 6th to 11th in defensive rating, and that's with Aaron Holiday playing a lot more minutes and TJ Warren and Jeremy Lamb, better defenders last season and this one, playing less due to injuries.  All told, the difference in net rating this season is over 7 (good for 4th in the league), while that number last season was under 2, good for only 13th.  Sabonis is having a career year, Brogdon is having a career year, Turner is having a career year, Justin Holiday is having a career year, and Oladipo is playing the best he has since before the injury.  I'm not sure where you are getting these ""11th"" numbers from?  EDIT: I see now that I'm looking at adjusted rating, which takes into account opposing defenses, which to this point, the Pacers have played several of.  Even so, our unadjusted net rating is 6th in the league at over 6, compared 12th in the league at just over 2 last season."
"A stellar performance from Malcolm Brogdon, who is playing like an All Star these last few games. Vic didn't have a great shooting night but he was still aggressive and made the effort on offense. Myles Turner continued his epic defensive run to start the season with 8 blocks, including a clutch collab block with Sabonis in the last minute of the game which helped us seal the win.   The Pacers were able to weather the storm each time the Rockets were able to close the gap after the Pacers had built a lead. John Wall was unstoppable, and he got to the rim with ease all night and was getting basically any layup he wanted. This surely would have been a different game if not for Harden's frankly terrible (by Harden standards) performance. There was no aggression from him and he took very few of those stepback threes you expect to see him take, although he did finish with 12 assists. We had 3 or 4 guys defending him all night, so those different defensive looks may have confused him or disrupted his scoring game, but I think he just didn't have it going for whatever reason last night. The Rockets bench also played very poorly.   The Pacers' biggest issue right now is rebounding. They are not a good rebounding team, and they especially give up way too many offensive boards. That is not sustainable for the season and isn't a playoff-winning formula, so they will have to get that sorted out. The Pacers rebounded better against the Rockets, but they played a team which is also a bad rebounding team, and the Rockets also used a small-ball lineup all night which may have had something to do with the Pacers' better rebounding performance.   All in all, things are going really well for the Pacers at the moment. They're winning games, and they're doing it while still missing some key players in TJ Warren and Jeremy Lamb. Doug McDermott, who has been really productive at times for us, also went out injured on Wednesday. Despite our injuries, our starters are lighting it up with great performances, bolstered by role players stepping up on any given night, like Justin Holiday, who finished with 20 points last night."
"All game he had brogdon-oladipo- Justin holiday on him.  All amazing perimeter defenders and myles turner defending the paint. The way this team is built and playing defense this year harden isn't going to get plenty of good looks like he normally can. He made the right adjustment though and gave his team plenty of opportunities instead, so respect to him there"
justin holiday going off for me so im happy
"Does he dislike Redd and KMart or does he really, really like Justin Holiday and Bullock?"
&gt; Justin Holiday is a current day KMart...  that makes about as much sense as comparing Nikola Vucevic to Shaq
My roomate swears to god Reggie Bullock is what Redd would be in todays league and that Justin Holiday is a current day KMart...
Man Justin holiday is such a good player. How you guys got him for 6 a year is crazy to me. Definitely worth a full MLE. Dude is between a 37 and 41% 3pt shooter and is one of the best wing defenders in the league.

"\*Googles Indiana Pacers stats  Come on Justin Holiday, da fuq."
Former Warrior Justin Holiday.
"We're DEEP too on the bench. We don't have any 6MOTY type guys but Justin Holiday, McDermott, and McConnell have played really well off the bench. Makes it easier for us to weather the storm of TJ Warren being out."
...Justin Holiday?
"Oh right. How could I forget. That's a really strong team. You could have a pretty deep line-up of:  * Coach: Pau * C: Marc/Brook &amp; Robin Lopez/Cody &amp; Tyler Zeller * Wings: Giannis/Marcus &amp; Markieff/Justin Holiday/Thanasis/Kostas/Caleb &amp; Cody Martin * Guards: Steph/Jrue/Lonzo &amp; LaMelo Ball/Seth/Aaron Holiday  Would have to send some of these guys to the G-League affiliate, since it's over 15 now.  This team is definitely a championship caliber team."
Bro they literally had 181 pound Justin Holiday guarding Zion after Sabonis fouled out and they didn’t give it to him once in the final 3 minutes of regulation. Idk what the hell SVG was doing calling straight ISOs for Ingram in the final 3 mins.
We had Justin Holiday (6'6) at C and Doug McDermott (6'7) at PF the other day for a bit
"I was hoping for that as well but unfortunately the loss of TJ Warren is gonna sting and probably cost us a spot or two.   Imo this game is ours if we had him.  We were looking hot out the gate this year and a lot of that was keeping the floor spread, no one could really help on to our other guys off Warren's position. We lost that because, frankly, we have a great bench but still fall off pretty hard after our starting 5. People aren't going to treat Justin/Aaron Holiday the same way.  Hoping he comes back this year, otherwise we might not be running this one back  That and Philly looking scary af"
"Which holiday, though? Justin, Jrue, or Aaron?"
"McDermott + Sabonis is one of the best 2 man games in the league. Add McConnell, Aaron Holiday and Justin Holiday and that's a fun lineup. Although it seems to go bad when you add any other pacers bench player to it or take Sabonis out."
"You should score more than 4 points in 15 minutes in an all star game  What is he, Justin holiday?"
You forgot about Tj McConnell and Justin Holiday
"Curry, Ball, Holiday, Morris, and Lopez brothers would make a pretty dope team.  Steph/Jrue/Zo/Marcus/Brook  Melo/Seth/Justin/Markief/Robin  This could be a top 3 seed in the east"
Jrue and Justin Holiday reunion with Lonzo
"That is what I am wondering. Myles Turner, Justin Holiday, &amp; TJ McConnell grade out great in this stat. They must clamp down hard whenever Sabonis sits, or something crazy is happening."
He's like an expensive Justin Holiday at this point
"I'm loving this thread of people arguing about the NCAA being better than the NBA lmaoooooo. If Justin Holiday played in college today, he'd be defensive player of the year"
"Some context worth considering to explain his surprising net rating: Pacers have basically played the whole season with 2 starters missing. Domas plays most of his minutes with the starting unit. We start every game with 2 guys who wouldn't be on the court if the team was healthy (usually a combination of Aaron/Justin Holiday and McDermott, instead of Warren and LeVert). So the team is undermanned the majority of the minutes that Domas plays.   It's a bit nuancy, but it kind of explains why, even though Domas is having an incredible year, he might be doing badly in this metric."
Lol this is like when Chris Paul busted out the “too small” at “backup 4” Justin holiday in a game this year
KP for Justin Holiday and Aaron Holiday makes sense to me  Pacers win and Mavericks get to watch Pacers win
The name is Justin Holiday and there were plenty of other moves to be made on the margins as well. You can keep coping but so far all the issues that I expressed about the team have born fruit.
I don't see Justin Holiday... Bad list
"Right now? Batum is playing really good defense and hitting 45% of his threes. (Frankly, I cannot believe how much better he looks this year)  Middleton has always been one of those guys.   Royce O'Neale is one of those guys.   KCP  Justin Holiday.   Mikal Bridges  Slowmo Anderson.   Devin Vassell is going to be that guy.  There's plenty of guys who are both a significant plus on defense that can also hit threes at a pretty solid clip.   Gary Trent's defense is not on that level yet."
"He's better defensively than Jamal Crawford and Lou Williams by a huge margin, not that he's good, but at least tries, hence why I said that he's at least ""good"" unlike Crawford when he last won that award. And unlike in recent years there doesn't seem to be a ""low key great role player who doesn't score at all"" ala George Hill/Kleber/Justin Holiday last year. I was talking more generally about the award, this year without digging too much into it Clarkson seem pretty far above the rest"
"Nope, not even the week that he averaged 52/6/6 on 62/48/91 shooting splits.  He got snubbed because the team went 0-3 that week (33pt loss, 3pt loss, 5pt loss).  Suns fans were livid, because those losses had absolutely nothing to do with his play.  He had De'Anthony Melton, Dragan Bender, and 2 Rookies (Ayton &amp; Bridges) starting alongside him.  To give an idea, here are our shooting splits in those games if Booker's stats were removed...  * **at Jazz**: 59pts on 19/34 from the field, 5/8 from 3, 16/17 from FT    * *Rest of Team: 33pts on 12/42 from the field, 2/15 from 3, 7/11 from FT*    * *Booker's matchup was Donovan Mitchell, who scored 10pts on 4/14 shooting* * **vs Wizards**: 50pts on 19/29 from the field, 3/9 from 3, 9/10 from FT    * *Rest of Team: 71pts on 24/57 from the field, 11/29 from 3, 12/16 from FT*    * *Booker's matchup was Bradley Beal, who scored 28 on 11/22 shooting* * **vs Grizz**: 48pts on 19/29 from the field, 3/6 from 3, 7/8 from FT    * *Rest of Team: 67pts on 24/52 from the field, 9/22 from 3, 10/15 from FT*    * *Booker's matchup was Justin Holiday, who scored 14pts on 5/9 shooting*"
Homer take but the Pacers have a very underrated bench when healthy  PG: Brogdon / Aaron Holiday / TJ McConnell   SG: LeVert / Jeremy Lamb  SF: TJ Warren / Justin Holiday  PF: Sabonis / Doug McDermott  C: Turner / Goga  Goga's the only raw guy.
You need Jrue Holiday to beat a garbage tanking team missing 3 rotation players with Justin Jackson and Kenrich Williams starting? Lol
"Role players on non contending teams get underrated.  For example a guy like Richaun Holmes is better than a lot of starting centers in the NBA.  Kyle Anderson is a great defender, a good passer/pnr operator and this year he's even shooting well on decent volume, he'd be a starter on a lot of contenders, but he's on the Grizzlies so nobody cares.  Valanciunas is better than he was on Toronto, but he's not on a contender anymore so nobody cares.  Justin Holiday is an elite 3&amp;D guy, legit one of the best in the NBA.  &amp;#x200B;  On the other end role players on elite teams either get overrated/overhyped (Beverley, Caruso, Horton Tucker, DiVincenzo...) Or some often get overscrutinized  (KCP, Danny Green,...)"
"Underrated:  * Royce O’Neal * Derrick Favors * Jamychal Green * Cam Payne * Justin Holiday * Thad Young * Whatever G-Leaguer the Heat have turned into a 6th man of the year candidate   Overrated:  * Marc Gasol * Lou Williams (maybe less so now) * Carmelo Anthony * Robert Covington * JJ Redick  * Matisse Thybulle * Donte DiVincenzo  * Whatever G-Leaguer the Heat have turned into a 6th man of the year candidate that just signed a big contract  It’s like the other guy says, good or large teams that have a lot of fans and a lot of attention on them will generally have their role players overrated, bad teams and small market teams will generally have their role players go under the radar."
"I think Dray and Wiggins have both been more impactful than their BPM/VoRP would indicate (especially Draymond). But whether i agree with you depends on what you mean here by ""really good."" If you mean Wiggins is a solid starter now, I'm with you. If you think he is a borderline all-star, hell no.  [EPM,](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm) which takes into account plus/minus data and is a lot fairer to defensive players, has Draymond ranked 82nd overall, and Wiggins at 101. (Steph is 5th, and first in offense).    I still think that underrates Dray, though it's impossible to accurately measure Dray when he's currently the only 5ppg 35% shooter in league history to be indispensable to his team's offense.  I do think the ranking is accurate for Wiggs. And it's not a slight on him. Wiggins has turned himself into a top 100 player in the league, which is to say, a solid starter(5 starters x 30 teams, 150 players). This is a major improvement over Minnesota bust Wiggins. Oher players with Wiggins relative impact right now are Jae Crowder, Justin Holiday, Joe Ingles--good role players. That's where Wiggins is, though he's being asked to do more for us because we're so offensively challenged.  If you want to bump him up a little because of his ability to handle second unit scoring responsibilities--albeit inefficiently--I could accept that. That leaves Wiggins as somewhere around the 90-100th best player in the league. If that's what you mean by ""really good,""  I agree with you. Wiggins is no longer a negative on the court and has become a legitimate role player.   He's a good 4th/5th guy on a contending team--think young Harrison Barnes--being asked to be Steph's offensive sidekick. I'm starting to like Wiggins along with the rest of this scrappy team, but Steph is still hard-carrying this shit"
"Love it when the Pacers roll out the White Christmas Lineup: Aaron Holiday, Justin Holiday, TJ McConnell, Doug McDermott, Domantas Sabonis."
"&gt; only real perimeter threat night-in  Doug McDermott and Justin Holiday, two of the best shooters in the league? In the last three TJM has a BPM of +11, and Brogdon's is -58. It's not an end all be all stat, but it isn't nothing either."
"He has modernized the offense, and he has done well utilizing Sabonis as an offensive hub while empowering Myles Turner more as well on the offensive end. He has leaned perhaps too heavily on starters, but it's also forgivable because IND is missing their leading scorer and Bubble God from last season, TJ Warren, and is without who would be the team's, arguably, third best player in Caris LeVert.   Basically, for the Pacers to win most games, they need a consistent outing from Brogdon and Sabonis, a good defensive performance from Turner, and either Justin Holiday or Doug McDoug to go 4-6 from three. IND is missing a lot of offense and a wing defender, so it's been even harder since the Oladipo trade.   LeVert might be back in a month, and Warren might be back in two. The only player to be worse since Nate's takeover has been Aaron Holiday. He has been crazy inconsistent, and I'm not sure how much blame to ascribe to Nate, but the fact Aaron has continually had more playing time than Edmond Sumner is slowly becoming a problem."
"Pacers with Justin holiday and levert, magic with bacon and carter jr, kings with buddy hield and Harrison Barnes"
"I agree, surely some guys are more athletic than others, I'll be crazy to define D'Angelo Russell, Justin Holiday or Bogdanovic as athletic for example, it's just that the word *athleticism* in general encompasses more than just speed and explosiveness. Just as very few players (if any) could match Jordan's first step or Rose's speed, I don't know how many can run around like Curry does all the time (while having his usage rate). I think we can all agree that long distance runners are athletic and you always hear people criticize Harden, Westbrook, LeBron or whoever, for standing around a lot to preserve energy, then why shouldn't we consider *athletic* players that maybe need less rest?  I think other aspects, like strength, could also be more discussed when talking athleticism, without even disturbing things like hand-eye coordination, deceleration or processing speed."
He's not even shooting that well from 3 though. 38.2% is good but not special. Guys like Justin Holiday and Wayne Ellington are making scraps and are shooting better than him.
Peopel act like Caris is Kobe around /r/nba   He is an inefficient chucker. should eh is a lot better than starting Justin Holiday or Doug McDermott but it sn't like he is an all star talent that is going to turn aroudn our team.
"1. Domantas Sabonis (best, not most valuable) 2. Myles Turner 3. Caris LeVert 4. Malcolm Brogdon 5. T.J. McConnell 6. Justin Holiday 7. Doug McDermott 8. **Edmond Sumner** 9. **Goga Bitadze** 10. Jeremy Lamb 11. Aaron Holiday"
"No chance, this squad has a contender level starting 5, not to mention Giannis-Curry is the most talented duo in the league.  This squad has a play-in in the East caliber bench lol. Lamelo/Lonzo/Justin Holiday/Markieff/RoLo is a decent Eastern conference team on it’s own lol, let alone being rotated into that starting lineup."
Eyy he said Jrue Holiday instead of Justin Holiday everyone has to drink
Bjorken also had Justin holiday guarding Westbrook down the stretch which went as you’d expect
Completely ridiculous.  He made Justin Holiday and Robin Lopez return to the Bulls.   They said they wanted to develop the young guys.
The Bulls did exactly this with Lopez and Justin Holiday a few years ago.  The league called Shananigans and made them return to the team. Between that and Garpax signing Sean KilDraftPick it cost the Bulls Luka Doncic.
The year of the Luka Draft Silver sent out a warning to teams that were testing places. Silver told the Bulls they couldn’t rest Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday and Dallas couldn’t rest Harrison Barnes. I think the frustration has to do with not being enforced the same from team to team
Lol how is this allowed? I remember when the NBA warned the bulls for not playing fucking Justin Holiday
wasnt for us when we benched RoLo and justin holiday lol
We forgetting Justin Holiday?
"Whoops, my mix up on Toronto, and actually I meant Justin Holiday (he and Aaron are both in Indy), lol."
"Such a dumb move to sign a C-tier big man instead of a wing, the Celtics would be much better if they went after Justin Holiday or Jae Crowder."
"Ideally yes and Justin Holiday and McDermott will see minutes at forwards, possible Lamb sees minutes there as well."
"Its been a really annoying past couple years as a Bulls fan having to convince everyone of our players value from people who never watch us but have strong opinions on our players ability.   Bobby Portis, Zach Lavine, Tony Snell, Justin Holiday, Jimmy Butler if you go back far enough. The list goes on on separate accounts I've taken mad flak for just saying they're not the trash this sub acts like they are.    It really killed my engagement on here. Everyone just assumes you're a homer &amp; writes you off. Whats the point of discussing my team if somehow /r/NBA always knows better?   I wish there was a sub where we could regulate who could comment based on some way to validate if they were watching games and what games they were. They would still be able to comment but you could easily check &amp; see ""Oh they've only been verified as watching 1 Nets game this season, their opinion on them is probably malinformed &amp; can be written off."" Its authoritarian but I think the discussion &amp; content that would arise from such a thing would be really unique &amp; insightful instead of just ESPN on reddit."
Guys who have a better dFG at the rim than jokic contesting at least 90 shots this year   SGA  Fred Van Vleet  Luka Doncic   Garrett Temple  Justin Holiday   Yes that’s the same fred Van Vleet who isn’t tall enough to be allowed on like half the rides at six flags
"To summarize, our 2nd and 3rd scoring options have missed significant time (LeVert/Oladipo and Warren). This has pushed McDermott and Justin Holiday into the starting lineup which thinned our bench. Also Aaron Holiday’s minutes have increased and he just isn’t good. Sabonis and Brogdon have been playing too many minutes to be effective late in games."
"Big shoutout to Justin Holiday tonight. His stats don't look impressive, but he was everywhere defensively. Gave Paul, Bridges, and Booker lots of trouble at different times."
"He is being forced to be our ""star"" when he was signed to help out Dipo.   He has the balli n his hands way too much but the alternative is Doug McDermott and Justin Holiday. WE just have no one that can score really  (and sabonis isn't nearly as good as r/nba thinks)"
"Oladipo was a decent 3pt shooter in his first year under McMillan at 37% and dealt with knee injuries before the big one in 2019, so it was fair to say that his shot percentages with Indiana were affected.  Warren was a 40%+ shooter in the last two seasons, so that sorta makes him good, you do realize that? He shot 40% under Nate's system, so he was a pretty decent shooter as well  Sabonis was never a 3pt shooter anyway.  Besides, Justin Holiday, and Doug McDermott are excellent shooters under McMillan and Bjorkgren, with Doug being incredibly misused under McMillan"
"He isn't a PG, but Indiana got him to pair with Oladipo. Since both are combo guards, it worked out. We started the year 8-4 with Oladipo, traded him away, and have gone 8-16 since. So the Pacers really need another ball handler w/ the starters, b/c Justin Holiday and McDermott can't dribble the ball."
"Probably just your first part about ""a bunch of good role players"". The rest of what you said is true, but I'd hardly call Sabonis, Oladipo, Brogdon, and Warren role players. Those are All Stars or solid 2nd/3rd options. Role players are guys like Doug McDermott and Justin Holiday."
are we supposed to run plays for Justin Holiday (and I love the dude but...)
Fantastic effort from Justin Holiday there -- just wandering around out by the logo for half of that short play.
thank Justin Holiday first
I still find it hilarious how Indiana’s backup power forwards are often Justin holiday and Doug McDermott
“A three for Justin holiday” bruh what?
Can’t forget our GOAT lineup of   PG: Cam Payne  SG: Denzel Valentine SF: Justin Holiday PF: Paul Zipser C: Cristiano Felicio
Jrue is on the Bucks. We have his brother Justin Holiday.
"You really not know who Justin Holiday is or are you joking? If you’re not joking its Jrues older brother, and he’s a perfect bench player/spot starter. Shoots over 40% from three on high volume and is a good wing defender"
We’re currently starting Justin Holiday and Doug McDermott. Levert and Warren will both start once healthy.
Justin Holiday and Aaron Holiday
"If I look at the 70 players who have played at least 1000 minutes this season, the top 15 in Def RAPTOR are:  Rudy Gobert, myles turner, Robert covington, Luguentz Dort, Fred Vanvleet, Nic Batum,  Kawhi Leonard, Giannis, Julius Randle, Bam adebayo , royce O'Neal, Justin holiday, Ben Simmons, Kelly oubre, DeAndre ayton  This is littered with players who are either great individual defenders, or at least do a great job playing a defensive role in a solid system (FVV, Julius Randle, for example)   Wiggins ranks 25th out of those 70 players for the record - so hes fine enough but I can't buy all this talk that hes elite on that end   Also fair to note that he is ranked 67th out of those 70 players in offensive RAPTOR , right behind Anthony Edwards. So there's that"

TJ McConnell and Justin Holiday are the best backcourt in the NBA
Justin holiday is just a tall Steph curry
"&gt;Justin Holiday, Aaron Holiday, and TJ McConnell... Doug McDermott... Monta Ellis... TJ Warren... Myles Turner  Seriously?  How deep did you expect these guys to take you in the playoffs?  Every team has dealt with injuries.  The Hawks have been ravaged by injuries this year.  Despite that they are 25 - 11 under Nate.  Never underestimate the value of good coaching.  Not saying he is an all time great but it's obvious he did a great job with what he had in Indy."
"It's not about his players, it's about the lack of adjustment that kills him. He doesn't want to draw from his bench like more successful teams do. He does well in the regular season despite injuries because he's forced to use other players, case in point was last year in Indiana when everyone except TJ Warren missed games. He pushed guys like Justin Holiday, Aaron Holiday, and TJ McConnell and the team won more games with their injured roster than in his two other years.  His problem is that when team rotations invariably get tighter in the playoffs, he refuses to adjust. Doug McDermott and Aaron Holiday barely got any run even when the team shat out 8-12 point quarters against Boston. He continued to start the undersized and already on his way out Monta Ellis against the Cavs. Sabonis was killing the Cavs in limited minutes in 2018 and he refused to pull Myles Turner, who was getting dominated by Tristan Thompson in Game 7. In that same game, LeBron sat for a long time in the 4th and he refused to put Oladipo in."
"Getting Oubre involved in any of the trades is tough though because he’s in control of his own destination. The only way to trade him would be for him to agree to the destination and for the team he’s getting traded to to also agree to his contract demands. As a result Oubre is worth a whole lot less as a S&amp;T free agent. Depending on Oubre’s contract demands he might not even be seen as an asset.   Also with Levert, Warren, Lamb, and Justin Holiday all under contract and playing the same position, I don’t think the Pacers really value Oubre like that. Oubre wouldn’t even be a top 2 wing for them.   It would basically be a first + some change for Turner. Not a great offer by any means but it’s an offer. One that another team could probably beat unless it’s the Minny first. I’m also assuming that Turner’s value is higher than last season since he’s had a little of a breakout and is a legit DPOY contender now."
Justin Holiday has a ring and Finals (garbage time) experience from when he was with us. We'll take him back. You can have his ring as compensation.
The Bulls did the exact same thing four years ago and instead of getting Luka we got Wendell Carter Jr because Silver forced the Bulls to bring back Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday.
Did someone say Justin holiday
Another random stat [we havent had a forward play &gt;2000 min and have 0 post up touches in an entire season for a while](https://go.nba.com/mm2m). Justin Holiday is at 1970 min this year and 0 post up touches.
"Before that was BRoy, Spencer Hawes, Martell Webster (from Seattle and was supposed to go to UW before he went pro), IT, Justin Holiday, Terrence Ross, and Dejounte Murray. Most of them were local guys on top of all that. Guess you can also include players like Lavine, Joe Harris, Kevin Porter Jr., etc.  Crazy how we still don’t have a team even when we’re putting out the type of talent that we are here in the PNW."
"Yeah fuck Brogdon, Warren, McDermott, Justin Holiday. Myles Turner never hit a 3 before either, fuck him."
"I have no idea about the Pacers man. I think a portion of it though is that there doesn't seem to be a veteran locker-room leader to keep the guys in order. Thad Young was a big part of that a few years ago. I think our oldest player is Justin Holiday?  I also had no idea that Bjork had an abrasive coaching style though. My homer take is that if everything clicked right we could be a fourth seed and could potentially get to the second round. That's pretty in-line with the ""always competent, never great"" MO of our front office.   I'm willing to give it another season before a definitive conclusion is made though, unfortunately losing TJ Warren at the beginning of this season made everything a wash. Another underrated loss was our defensive wiz assistant coach Dan Burke. He left for Philly and our defense just hasn't been the same.   We fired Nate M. because the FO believes that we have enough talent on the roster to make it past the first round and historically Nate M has not been the coach to do that; he overperforms in the regular season before hitting a brick wall in the playoffs. Also Nate did not run a modern offense at all. As I said, I'm interested to see another season with Nate B where players can continue to get acclimated before I make a real conclusion (I think we've been leading the league in pace lately).  I have no ill-will towards Nate M and I think all Pacers fans are happy to see him succeed on the Hawks. He's doing exactly what he does best; getting the most out of their players and getting them into the playoffs which aligns exactly with their FO's hopes. Hell, they may even stand a chance to get into the second round if they match up against the Knicks."

Justin Holiday
Bulls got forced to bring back Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday costing us Luka
"FWIW, the league has previously threatened to punish teams that sat healthy players at least once (the Bulls in 2018 got warned for resting Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday).  I guess the league doesn't really care anymore."
I made a whole spreadsheet before realizing I forgot to take position into account.  Top 5 scoring teams are as follows if we're playing positionless and/or small-ball:  |*Team MB -  79.9 PPG*|*Team DB -  77.6 PPG*|*Team JH -  76.5 PPG*|*Team BB -  76.1 PPG*|*Team TH -  72.4 PPG* | |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Malcolm Brogdon - 21.2|Devin Booker - 25.4|James Harden - 25.2 |Bradley Beal - 31.3|Tobias Harris - 20| |Malik Beasley - 19.6|Dillon Brooks - 16.7|Jrue Holiday - 17.3 |Bojan Bogdanovic - 15.7|Tim Hardaway Jr. - 16| |Marvin Bagley III - 13.9|Darius Bazley - 13.4|Joe Harris - 14.5 |Bogdan Bogdanovic - 15.2|Tyler Herro - 14.9| |Mikal Bridges - 13.1|Davis Bertans - 11.4|Justin Holiday - 10.3 |Bruce Brown - 8.8|Tyrese Haliburton - 12.8| |Miles Bridges - 12.1|Dwayne Bacon - 10.7|Josh Hart - 9.2|Bismack Biyombo - 5.1|Talen Horton-Tucker - 8.7|
PG: James Harden   SG: Jrue Holiday   SF: Joe Harris   PF: Justin Holiday   C: Jaxon Hayes
I disagree the year Luka was entering the draft Adam Silver was sending memos to the Bulls telling them to not rest Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday. The NBA isnt consistent and doesnt care if small market teams do it
"I still can't believe we told Hutchison (some loser from basketball powerhouse Boise State) that we would take him before the draft....and then still took him in the draft instead of someone like Aaron Holiday, who had clear NBA pedigree with Jrue and Justin already in the league.  And I know 2016 was a shit draft but we took Denzel 14th 😂"
Malcolm Brogdon and Justin Holiday?
Edmond Sumner has been great. Justin Holiday 6-8 3 pointers. Aaron Holiday DNP CD.
the horford thing is so silly considering how they went as us for... robin lopez and justin holiday a few years back
Justin Holiday needs a night off. We've worn him out.
"Justin Holiday will surely lock up their starting 4 this time, right?"
"Dude that’s great for them, they are great role players.  They shouldn’t be the best players on your team.  No one is winning a title with T.J. McConnell and Justin Holiday as the best players on the team, not even prime Phil Jackson."
"Lol the Pacers with the highest RAPTOR this year was T.J. McConnell, and the player with the highest last year was Justin Holiday, the year before, Thad Young.  How are your bench guys and secondary players your best players year after year?  Does this mean that your core is.........shit?  How is anyone expecting these rosters to even make the playoffs, much less go deep in the postseason?"
"They have really good assets just for some reason it’s not working out for them.  Anyways, I feel like sabonis and brogden can net them the most. As they are both really good players and easily fit in today’s game.  Turner could net you a solid starter or maybe a few picks. Same with levert.  I’m not sure about warren. He had a great bubble but he got hurt early this year. Lamb is a bucket but I think he’s coming off acl surgery. But both are on expiring contracts. Both or one could be shipped to a championship cusp team. Justin holiday could be shipped to solidify a teams bench.  All others I would keep as they are cheap players."
Nah you’re right it’s 7.5m that could be 8.2m with incentives. And yeah they could’ve but the lakers liked the idea of getting Dennis who’s a playmaker / scoring guard who can guard than an older rondo + an already packed guard rotation so they decided to use the money somewhere else. Personally I think they should’ve used the money on Justin Holiday / Aron Baynes ( at the time before he went downhill )
"They got Wes Matthews anyway, was Justin Holiday supposed to move the needle?"
"&gt;Rondo was the guy we needed to keep  The way I see it, they should've done 1 of two things:  1. Keep Green, re-sign Rondo with the MLE 2. Trade for Schroder, sign a guy like Justin Holiday with the MLE  Obviously Schroder didn't work out but trading Danny Green away and not getting another 3&amp;D guy in order to have Harrell do absolutely nothing compounded the mostake"
"the 2014-15 warriors. Steph, klay, dray, bogut, barnes, iggy, shaun, barbosa, lee, ezeli, mo buckets, justin holiday...that team was downright scary. the team chemistry was the purest stuff i've ever seen, considering that we had legitimate starters coming off the bench (team was top 2 on D and n.1 on offense). We were clowning most teams and the crowd was in playoffs mode for like the whole season. We had a blowout win like every 3 games lol. Forever as my best basketball moments."
"Roster construction isn’t a factor when we didn’t have a healthy starting unit at all this year - I’m not sure how many games with more than 3 healthy starters we had tbh. Warren out for season. Dipo trade for Caris who then had a tumor removed. Turner spent significant time at the end of the season hurt. Brogdon missed some games. Sabonis missed a few but was really the only healthy player all year. Guys like Justin Holiday, TJ McConnell, and Doug McDermott started for quite a bit of the season and these guys did well but they’re never meant to be 30+min per game kinda guys... That was the biggest factor to our underwhelming year  Secondly, Nate just sucked. He implemented some flat out terrible defensive schemes. He never once adjusted his approach to game plan (the wizards for example average about 140 points per game against us and he never changed how we guarded Westbrook in a single game). So much zone defense half the season, that was abandoned halfway through. Lot of Brogdon and Sabonis two man game - to the point those guys complained and wanted to change the offense up to involve more of the team.   I actually believe the majority of this roster could be a great sum of its parts kind of team but our biggest issue is staying healthy. Year in and year out we lose important players come playoffs and we just crumple once we lose a starter. I imagine guys are available but I doubt we aggressively pursue trades for the sake of trading. Kevin Pritchard has made some damn good trades in his tenure here, we just haven’t had a good draft record so we really need to get this years pick right.   Right now, we lack identity as a team. Are we offensively minded with Sabonis or are we going to lean into defense with Turner (if we even trade one which we might not). Pritchard said a lot about getting back to being a hard defense team so I imagine there’s a priority there to improve on that. Would not be surprised if few moves are made this offseason, would also not be surprised if it’s wildly different next season. Hard to say and our FO never gives any insight about it either."
Porzingis for Myles Turner and Justin Holiday
"that would be above and beyond really, if that's even possibly they should jump all in   i was thinking even lighter than that, like Bullock, Batum, Justin Holiday"
Or when we traded two picks for Justin Holiday🤢
Now they're saying its Justin Holiday
"Furk at 5 million per year isn’t disrespect.     https://www.spotrac.com/nba/free-agents/2020/  Lot of good players like Nerlens, Burks, Justin Holiday sign for that.   It’s a taxpayer exception.     Problem for Furk is that he is worth more than he will get bc he isn’t good enough for a young rebuilding team to think he is a core player and the good teams don’t have cap space or if they do will want to use it on more vet.   One more 2/10 and hits FA at 26 and he could get paid."
This was payback for what Iguodala did to justin holiday
Chris Paul did this to backup “power forward” Justin holiday earlier in the year lol probably my favorite one of these this season
For me it's simple -- I would rather have Justin Holiday and Dwight than Harrell and it's not really close either.
Justin Holiday was an option. Capable wing defender and a good shooter. If we use the MLE on him we likely keep Dwight.
"A lot of the Lakers' issues this year stem from the decision to sign Harrell.  By signing Harrell they lost the opportunity to add more shooting to the roster (like a Justin Holiday), it also cost them Dwight which exposed the need for another athletic big -- leading to the Drummond signing."
"Jrue, Aaron, and Justin Holiday would ball out together"
"I mean Harden, Brogdon, Warren, and one of Turner / Sabonis is an excellent core. Justin Holiday is like our 8th scoring option and Aaron Holiday doesn't even get minutes anymore. We actually had a pretty decent bench this year so you're underrating this hypothetical team. Top 4 team in the east for sure."
big shot justin holiday!
**Starters**  Steph Curry   Jrue Holiday   Justin Holiday   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Brook Lopez    **Bench**    LaMelo Ball   Marcus Morris   Seth Curry   Robin Lopez   Markieff Morris   Thanasis Antetokounmpo   Kostas Antetokounmpo    **Coaching staff**   Mike D'antoni   Dan D'antoni
"I think it's important to note that Jimmy Butler is Bernie Lee's only big client. After him, the next biggest are Justin Holiday, Mike James, and Isaiah Thomas. Not exactly the clientele to benefit from sports reporters or insiders."
So was Justin Holiday
10 Teammates separate the first man to ever score a point in the NBA and the most recent person ever to score a point in the NBA   Ossie schectman (first NBA basket) --&gt; Bud Palmer --&gt; Carl Braun --&gt; Bill Russell --&gt; Don Chaney --&gt; Mychal Thompson --&gt; Byron Scott --&gt; Reggie Miller --&gt; Jermaine O'Neal --&gt; Klay Thompson --&gt; Justin Holiday --&gt; Cassius Stanley (Last points in the IND/WAS game)
Man I love watching Beal play... He reminds me of Justin Holiday with better handles
I don't think Marv could pick Brissett out of a choice of one picture.    He's already called two people who look nothing like him Oshae Brissett in Kelan and Justin Holiday.
Now they're saying Oshae Brisset and Justin Holiday aren't the same person.
I like Justin Holiday more than Aaron Holiday because I prefer longer holidays
"Pacers shooting 46% or better:  Doug McDermott, Oshae Brissett, Justin Holiday, Domantas Sabonis, Malcolm Brogdon, T.J. McConnell, Edmond Sumner  Game MVP:  Terry Rozier"
"And then they allowed teams to tank at an unprecedented level anyways.   Was that Sixers team allowed to send their second best player home, a proven winner, because hey he doesn’t feel like playing for this team right now and we want to “develop players”.   It was a joke this year. Three years ago the Bulls were forced to bring back Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday.   How much better is Horford than those two?   A ton"
"Justin Holiday is pretty good, and Sumner/McConnell are not bad either. But losing Burke was the biggest loss for the Pacers tbh."
"below replacement value players that have been through the Warrior's system and been ""serviceable"":  Ian Clark   James Michael McAdoo   Alonzo McKinnie   Damian Jones   Festus Ezeli   Quinn Cook   Patrick McCaw   Damion Lee   Mychal Mulder   Brandon Rush   Justin Holiday    Others who thrive in the Warriors system that may not look as good somewhere else:  Kevon Looney   Shaun Livingston   Juan T."
"No one in this thread is talking about Justin Holiday, so I will.   At 32-years-old Holiday still improves every single year. He's elite at being whatever a team needs. He can shoot, he can defend, but most importantly he's a chameleon that allows the guys around him to play to their fullest potential. He's not flashy, he's not demanding, he simply knows what and who he is and gets the job done -in every single game, as this list highlights."
Man shout out to Justin Holiday. He was asked to do so much this year. Complete professional. He played out of position so much this year.
Bulls were forced to bring back all time greats Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday by Silver.
Justin Holiday is also at 227
"Did you really just ask how much better Sabonis &amp; Myles Turner are than Oshae Bisette &amp; Goga? How much better Brogdon &amp; TJ Warren are over Justin Holiday &amp; Doug McDermott? lol I know r/NBA doesn’t actually watch basketball or understand it but cmon now, you can at least pretend to understand that starters are better than backups for a reason"
Justin holiday and Levert?
Two of the Holiday brothers would also have rings. (Justin Holiday won with the 2015 Warriors.)
Justin Holiday always values defense
justin holiday is playing really well
"Weird seeing Dillon Brooks in the new unis but surrounded by marc, omri casspi, justin holiday, and chandler parsons (🤮)"
"&gt;Fournier, Joe Harris, RJ Barrett, Danny Green, OG Anunoby, P.J. Tucker, Justin Holiday, Saddiq Bey, Isaac Okoro, Patrick Williams, Kevin Huerter, Cody Martin, Jimmy Butler, Dwayne Bacon, Beal, MPJ, Okogie, Pokusevski, Norm Powell, Bojan Bogdanovic, Mo Harkless, Mikal Bridges, LeBron, Kawhi, Oubre, Dorian Finney-Smith, Jae'Sean Tate, Kyle Anderson, Brandon Ingram, DeRozan  There's ESPN's list of starting SF's in this league. Who can't he guard here? LeBron? If that's the standard to hold people to then noone can defend the 3.   That list is chopped liver. That list is ass^2.   The problem isn't Klay at the 3. It's your other 2 perimeter defenders are too small to guard the 3 and not good enough to defend premiere 1's and 2's. Klay at PG, SG, and SF is a good defensive team. Andre checked the Wing's because he does have more size (fair) but also because Klay was taking their best guard (most often the best player on the opposing team). He didn't get the assignment because the Warriors had another premiere defensive wing so he didn't have to, not because he couldn't."
"In some alternate universe we kept Robin Lopez, brought Kostas in, and have Justin and Aaron Holiday off the bench."
Justin Holiday (Bulls) for MarShon Brooks and Wayne Selden (Grizzlies)
They did! Justin Holiday had a vlog where some of the Pacers players went and played.
Justin and Aaron Holiday going to make sure that doesn't happen.
"Inb4 they win and Robin López, Aaron and Justin Holiday get traded to the lakers or the nets"
It'll happen next year when Justin and Aaron Holiday follow Jrue
"It looks like money wise this works:  Philly gets: CJ McCollum  Indy gets: Ben Simmons  Portland gets: Domantas Sabonis, Justin Holiday"
For a Simmons /Brogdan + 1st to work capwise  the Pacers need to add 8-10 mil in salary.   Either Jeremy Lamb is added of perhaps Justin and Aaron Holiday to make it fit cap wise.  Another possible but unlikely trade could be Simmons for Brogdan and TJ Warren
With Jeremy Lamb or Justin Holiday they do
Justin Holiday
"Looney opts out, we sign him for 10 mil. Trade him, Wise, #14 to Pavers for Turner and Justin Holiday. Dieng for MLE.  Turner, Dray, Wigs, Klay, Steph  Dieng, JTA, Oubre, Justin, Poole"
"Marv be like: “Trevor young passes to bojan, takes the three, no good, rebounded by Gonas, passes to justin holiday, slides into home, it’s a strike!! AND THE FOUL”"
**SAC:** Sabonis and Justin Holiday  **IND:** Harrison Barnes and the 9th pick
"Ok so you’d just stick with a squad of jrue as the best player, Thad young, nick young, Evan turner, j rich, lavoy Allen, spencer hawes, Justin holiday, dorell Wright. I picked the most notable names lol. And then use that cap space to sign someone? Nvm the fact that the biggest free agent signing the sixers signed in years was Elton brand coming off an Achilles tear. That team finished 34-48 so you’d prob be in the late lottery or you make some great free agent signings and make the playoffs and lose your first round pick to the magic. Love the plan so far! Also the sixers didn’t even finish with the worst record in the nba that first year (let alone in nba history lol)"
" Turner, Dray, Wigs, Klay, Steph  Looney, JTA, Oubre, Justin Holiday, Poole"
"Why the Pritchard slander? He got TJ Warren for cash considerations, sign and trade for Brogdon, got Domas on the best contract in the NBA (4 yrs, 77 million), and got LeVert for injured (and unhappy) Oladipo. Not to mention Justin Holiday for 3 years, 18 mil.   His drafting is spotty and he messed up with Bjorkgren, but otherwise he's been excellent."
Make it Justin Holiday instead of Warren and it makes alot more sense.
Why Justin Holiday playing?
"The Holiday brothers...Justin, Aaron, Jrue...too lazy to check if they are related to other NBA players though."
"Only 1 Holiday (Justin), Aaron was traded to WAS to acquire Isaiah Jackson in the draft."
Either TJ McConnell or Justin Holiday.
"Rose Butler Pau/Noah almost beat the Cavs with a hobbled Pau 😭  We had the Justin Holiday, Paul Zipser, Cameron Bairstow era too"
"They were playing Delon Wright, Justin Holiday, Ivan Rabb, Bruno Caboclo and Tyler Dorsey.   They got Ja Morant right after"
"Wingspan and weight are also a huge thing which also complicates the casual fan's viewing.  Justin Holiday is 6'6, which ideally should mean he could play the 3 but he's so light that he's basically a jumbo 2-guard."
"I checked and here are a few they could be interested in for a 2nd rounder or 2:  Augustin, Justin Holiday, Dunn, House"
"The wing rotation is deep, so his minutes will be somewhat limited early.  Unlikely he starts many games, but should be a key part of the rotation.  We have basically 5 shooting guards all about the same size (Levert, Duarte, Sumner, Lamb, Justin Holiday).  Given the dearth of small forwards and power forwards we have, a lot of the smaller wings will get significant play at the 3, sometimes even the 4 when we go with only 1 of sabonis/turner on the floor (warren/brisset/craig i expect to mostly man the 4 this season, with sabonis putting in ~12 mins a game there).  Of the shooting guards, Levert and Duarte are the two biggest and I expect Duarte to be tasked with it more than Levert.  Minutes are crowded with a rotation that is 13 deep - but unless a miracle happens I expect ~80 games missed by the starters and Lamb last year still seemed to be recovering from his ACL injury.  Warren, Turner both coming off season ending injuries.  This first year, I expect Duarte will be ~ the 9th man in the rotation, but I feel this draft pick was made more for the years following that as we have a lot more hit free agency."
"Starters: Jamal Murray (7) (WHAT A STEAL), Tim Hardaway Jr (14), Kyle Anderson (11) , Giannis (40), Nikola Jokic (39)  Bench: Justin Holiday (4) (Absolute Bargain), Grayson Allen (4), Naz Reid (3).  This team should be good enough to win a title. I really like Giannis and Jokic as a pairing as well.Jokic as a pairing as well."
"Always partial to the Pacers:  TJ McConnell, Chris Duarte, Justin Holiday, Jeremy Lamb, OShae Brissett"
Go ahead and grab Jrue and Justin Holiday while you're at it
Need to work a trade out for Justin Holiday.  Also... Barbosa is looking good in the Big 3. He's in-shape. Sign him.
He'll be a good back up for Justin holiday
"Everyone underestimates the Pacers every year, it’s honestly infuriating. Levert, Sabonis, Brogdon and Warren could all go off on any given night. Turner is a defensive beast. Tj McConnell and Justin holiday anchor the bench. Duarte will contribute immediately. Sumner and goga would ball if they got more minutes. Craig was a nice pick up. Don’t under estimate these guys with Rick calling the shots"
Missing Justin holiday
"So they need to move Nukic then. Nurkic+filler for Brogdon, Turner and Justin Holiday may be interesting for both."
"Yeah, the move is another 6'0 washout. We've got 2 rostered, just need 1 more  Who's keeping track from just the past 2 seasons? I am....  Isaiah Thomas, Ish Smith, Raul Neto, Cassius Winston, Chris Chiozza, Justin Robinson, Shabazz Napier, now Aaron Holiday."
Aaron Holiday is to Justin Holiday what Justin Holiday is to Jrue Holiday
"Its not a mystery. OG is more than capable of slotting in at the 4 and Raptors could get one of Justin Holiday, Lamb or even Warren."
"You are way overvaluing Kuzma. Pacers are not gonna pay $13 million a year to a guy who averaged 13 and 6 and brings nothing of value to the Pacers that they don't already have. Plus, he'd come off the bench, so no, that contract is not reasonable for not only a bench player, but a guy who would be fighting for playing time with not only Warren, but also Justin Holiday and Edmond Sumner, at the SF position alone. PLUS, Kuzma has regressed the last 2 years. He averaged 5 point LESS the last 2 years, than he did in 2018.  You can keep him and his contract. No one wants it, especially in Indiana"
Justin Holiday would honestly be a good fit. Play with his brother. Can play tall or small. Can knock down the 3.
"You wanna talk about wasting draft picks? The Timberwolves (along with the Kings) are the true experts in this field that all the other teams bow down to  Selected Brandon Roy in 2006, good job. Immediately trades him to Portland for Randy Foye because reasons.  Drafts a Florida Gator in 2007, sound logic as Florida were back-to-back NCAA champions. But y'all took Corey Brewer and not future DPOY Joakim Noah  The Timberwolves drafts 3 point guards in 2009, none of them were named Steph Curry or even Jrue Holiday  They took forward Wesley Johnson over DeMarcus Cousins in 2010, if they didn't want a big man Gordon Hayward &amp; Paul George were also still available.  Another forward in Derrick Williams in 2011 despite drafting Johnson the previous year.   Acquires Shabazz Muhammad in 2013, a shooting guard that can't shoot or guard anyone. Out of the league in 4 years  Drafts 4-year college player Kris Dunn in 2016, he shits the bed in his rookie season despite being touted as ""NBA-ready"" and ended up being packaged in the Jimmy Butler deal (not that I'm complaining, he was decent for the Bulls)  Drafts Justin Patton in 2017 (John Collins was still on the board), dude gets injured in Summer League and has played a grand total of 296 minutes of NBA basketball since. Last seen on the Rockets"
Nah what I want to see is all of the Ball brothers moving to the Bucks.  Then sign Kostas as well. Lastly sign Aaron and Justin Holiday.  The triple triplets
Pretty sure it was his wife and brother. I want to guess Justin Holiday.
What stater can they get for 28? Like Justin holiday?
"how about lamb, warren, justin holiday and a late future first?"
"There’s more offense with the Ball Brothers, while the Holiday brothers (well at least Jrue and Justin) would bring more defense.   I’ll go with the ball brothers."
til justin holiday won on a ring on the warriors
League warned Bulls not to rest fucking Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday lmao.
"Definitely. There are only a few sets of brothers trios to play in the NBA to start with. I can only think of:  * Will, Caldwell, Major and Charles Jones * Frank, Campy and Walker Russell * Jon, Brent and Drew Barry * Luke, Tyler and Cody Zeller * Jrue, Justin and Aaron Holiday * Giannis, Thanasis, and Kostas Antetokounmpo"
Think that's what Justin Holiday posted here ten years ago...
Jrue Holiday *Justin Holiday *Aaron Holiday
"Far from the best but...  D Rose, Rondo, Jimmy Butler, Bobby Portis, Thad Young  Bench: Cam Payne, Otto Porter, Wendell, Justin Holiday"
Reggie bullock??? Justin holiday? Wtf
Reggie Bullock is 30. He's not breaking out.  Justin Holiday is 32.
Justin holiday??
Justin Holiday is easy if you know what Jrue looks like. Imagine a 10% vertically stretched Jrue Holiday and you're basically there.
Malcolm Brogdon  Chris Duarte  Justin Holiday  Domantas Sabonis  Myles Turner  T.J. McConnell  Goga Bitadze  Oshae Brissett  Jeremy Lamb  Torrey Craig  Isaiah Jackson  Brad Wanamaker  Caris LeVert  DeJon Jarreau  T.J. Warren
"Not the best class, but I instantly thought of Isaiah Thomas in 2011. #60 pick   Besides him, they had Bojan Bogdanovic, Chandler Parsons(before injuries), Etwaun Moore, and Davis Bertrans.   Justin Holiday was undrafted that year too."
I wouldn’t let that stop me. Let’s be real here that the Pacers with the injuries before this one were likely still fighting for a play in spot. This on top of no timeline for Warren or Levert  just doesn’t seem like a good season anyway. Even Justin Holiday I saw was out like wtf is going on
"High: Was a fan of these players before they got drafted and often wondered why they werent picked a bit higher.   Dwyane Wade, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins, Deandre Jordan, Andre Iguodala, Danny Granger, Paul George, Joakim Noah, Roy Hibbert, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, 	   Domantas Sabonis, Tyler Herro, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Tyrese Haliburton.   &amp;#x200B;  Wrong: I thought these players would be pretty good before the draft.  Marcus Williams, Ben McLemore, Rodney Stuckey, Chris Douglas-Roberts, Earl Clark, Wesley Johnson, Kévin Séraphin, Andrew Nicholson, Nerlens Noel, Rashad Vaughn, Justin Patton, Wendell Carter Jr., Goga Bitadze.'Too soon, but I was high on Jalen Smith, Zeke Nnaji."
see that’s the thing our true second unit being some kind of comp of McConnell - Duarte - Justin Holiday - Torrey Craig - Goga/Jackson  with Oshae Brissett and Jeremy Lamb still behind them but in the mix - we’re a DEEP team   however it’s gonna be a mixed bag of injuries as it always is so not sure what the second unit will be
"Simmons-Justin Holiday-Duarte-Sabonis-Turner lineup, running offense through Simmons/Sabonis, with two good shooters and an average one on the floor. Defensively this might be good enough to cover for Sabonis' issues. Does not sound overly exciting, but trying to get somewhere with Brogdon, Levert, and Warren isn't exactly working out right now due to constant injuries."
"Anytime any player plays with these Warriors, being Steph Klay and Dray under Kerr, they have their best most productive seasons. For instance, Javale, Ian Clarke, Barbosa, Livingston, Speights, Cook, Justin Holiday, Chriss, Spellman, those guys had arguably their best years with the Warriors. Maybe not Holiday since he's probably more productive now."
I think at best someone else like Justin Holiday perhaps.
"I mean look at random athletic small forwards drafted in the 2nd round.  Comparisons are  to all-stars not random roleplayers most of the time.  No one out there going ""Ben Simmons best comparison is Justin Holiday with a pinch of Cody Zeller"""
"We were in a basketball tourney with the Holiday brothers (Justin and Jrue) and Campbell Hall. We were a bunch of Mexican kids, but we won our league that year. We lost in the game before playing the Holidays by 20 points. Which was good because the team We lost to, lost to Campbell Hall by 70 points. It wasn't even competitive."
"don't forget stucky, monta, tyreke, lamb  justin holiday needs to run for his life"
Maybe Duarte could do that job? Or Justin Holiday?
Justin Holiday and LeBron were probably cuddling last night
LeBron just had to steal the spotlight from Justin Holiday entering COVID protocols
Justin Holiday has played in 200 consecutive games
justin holiday has become a pretty decent player. if the pacers are out of it i could see a contender trying to nab him at the deadline
"I think it's a bit of both. Ingles and Clarkson are not hustle guys and I'm fine with trading them for a defensive wing like Justin Holiday. However, the whole team needs to play with more effort and run back on defense, Rudy included. We also spend too much time arguing with refs."
"When did I say they didn't? I'm saying if another player was going on the court just to attack another player, irregardless of stardom, that player should be kicked out of the league. If langson Galloway and had a beef with Justin holiday and out of no where in a game straight rocked him in the face galloway should not be in the NBA. Has nothing to do with stardom. That's legit assault."
That's Justin Holiday music!
That's Justin Holliday. Aaron Holiday plays for the Wizards.
Javale might be the only one that moved on and kept it up. Maybe Boucher could count too but probably not. Justin Holiday too.
"PG Elfrid Payton   SG Tim Hardaway Jr.   SF Carmelo Anthony   PF Marcus Morris   C Kristaps Porzingis  Bench: Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott, Bobby Portis, Reggie Bullock, Justin Holiday, Wayne Ellington, DeAndre Jordan, Austin Rivers  I knew we would be bad but yikes"
"He's not bad, but Tobi as the main option is hard to watch. He's got approximately none of the gravity that Embiid has, so him getting that much usage is just Tobias vs. the Pacers. That's easy enough to figure out by collapsing on him because he's likely to try force the shot anyways. We lose any kind of ball movement in his ISOs, and we certainly don't have any inside/out game with Drummond.   Can't really get too upset about these losses though, the team is in a meat grinder right now, and they at least aren't completely giving out in these games. Justin Holiday shot his ass off tonight. TJ is forever a Process hero. We have not shot well the past 3 games, and the wear and tear is setting in."
That was just Reggie Miller wearing a Justin Holiday mask.
Justin Holiday
Simmons + 2 firsts + 3 swaps for Justin Holiday?
Justin Holiday &gt; prime Steph
"He had super high usage last year, and I think he made the best of it, but that was him having to be our offense's #1 option, with a coach who didn't know how to use Myles, and injuries throughout. There's a reason why we didn't have team success despite Domas having a good year.  Again, this isn't me trashing Domas, he's great, he works hard, he's just not as valuable to an NBA team as his numbers suggest.  In terms of playmaking out of the post, he's competent, he's not a turnover machine or an idiot, but he's also a far cry from what someone like Jokic can do to manipulate a defense. Most of his assists last year were teams choosing to leave guys like McDermott, Brogdon, Myles, and Justin Holiday open in favor of doubling on Domas, since we didn't have our best scorers. So he'd have no choice but to pass out of the post, and usually he'll make the right pass, and sometimes we'd make a shot. But when teams actually have to play defense (i.e. not when they played the Pacers last season), they'll just rotate way faster than the limitations of his playmaking ability. Basically, he's a good enough playmaker to see one pass ahead, but not two or three, which is what you have to be in this league to really affect defenses as a high usage player. Hence, guys like Caris make such a difference for us and for Domas, so that Domas can be the 3rd+ option instead of trying to shoulder too heavy of a load.  Modern NBA defense has statistically neutralized back to the basket post ups, which is what makes Jokic so valuable. He's so far beyond the rest of his peers, hell, the rest of NBA history at playmaking from the post... that he is actually still ahead of the evolutions that NBA defenses have made over the past several years.  It's like when some of the last generations great nfl quarterbacks like Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, and Drew Brees started doing what they did with learning and exploiting defenses, audibling at the line, no huddle, 4 and 5 Wide sets, receiving TEs, etc. It took years for defenses to adjust to that, but they have, they've evolved and improved, and now the best quarterbacks also have to be able to throw on the run. Pocket qbs can still be great, they just need better O-lines and running games. Post players can still be great, they just need better ball handlers and shot creators. Except Jokic. He's transcendentally talented and intuitive.  So yeah, you're right, he's being used differently, but for the better. If we use him as a #1 option, we can't keep up with what other teams can do offensively (partially because he's still kind of a defensive liability himself)."
"Hmm, nbot sure why it might have returned that. I think first think I'd check is if you're able to run any player (try with a rookie, they have less games and it'll go quicker). If that returns actual output then I'm not sure what to think.  But I ran Klay's data to check/ for you and got this:  | Rank   | Player    | Assists| |:-----------|------------:|:------------:| | 1 | Stephen Curry | 187 | 2 | David Lee | 169 | 3 | Draymond Green | 162 | 4 | Harrison Barnes | 97 | 5 | Kevin Durant | 81 | 6 | Andrew Bogut | 75 | 7 | Andre Iguodala | 72 | 8 | Marreese Speights | 56 | 9 | Zaza Pachulia | 50 | 10 | David West | 42 | 11 | Shaun Livingston | 40 | 12 | Carl Landry | 38 | 13 | Brandon Rush | 35 | 14 | Festus Ezeli | 30 | 15 | Kevon Looney | 27 | 16 | JaVale McGee | 25 | 17 | DeMarcus Cousins | 20 | 18 | Jeremy Tyler | 14 | 19 | Omri Casspi | 13 | 20 | Nate Robinson | 13 | 21 | Quinn Cook | 12 | 22 | Dorell Wright | 11 | 23 | Jonas Jerebko | 11 | 24 | Jordan Bell | 10 | 25 | Charles Jenkins | 10 | 26 | Jermaine O'Neal | 9 | 27 | Patrick McCaw | 8 | 28 | Dominic McGuire | 8 | 29 | Alfonzo McKinnie | 7 | 30 | Damian Jones | 7 | 31 | Richard Jefferson | 6 | 32 | James Michael McAdoo | 6 | 33 | Jarrett Jack | 6 | 34 | Leandro Barbosa | 6 | 35 | Jordan Crawford | 6 | 36 | Monta Ellis | 5 | 37 | Chris Wright | 4 | 38 | Nick Young | 4 | 39 | Ekpe Udoh | 4 | 40 | Damion Lee | 4 | 41 | Ian Clark | 3 | 42 | Matt Barnes | 3 | 43 | Mickell Gladness | 3 | 44 | Andris Biedriņš | 2 | 45 | Anderson Varejão | 2 | 46 | Justin Holiday | 2 | 47 | Steve Blake | 2 | 48 | Jason Thompson | 2 | 49 | Ish Smith | 2 | 50 | Mikki Moore | 1 | 51 | Hilton Armstrong | 1 | 52 | Kwame Brown | 1"
"We actually played above our talent level, pulled out some wins against good teams with crap lineups. We beat the warriors at the end of the season with Delon Wright, Bruno Caboclo, Ivan Rabb, Tyler Dorsey and Justin Holiday starting."
"Justin Holiday: Please sir, may I have a time out? I have possession of the ball and I'm yelling loudly enough to be heard on the broadcast.  Refs: Lol Fuck you"
How bout Scottie and OG for Justin Holiday?
Justin Holiday is just playing like ass to start the season
"My favorite Pacers team of similar vein came a few years ago when they could have hypothetically run the ""full house"" lineup.  TJ Leaf, TJ Warren, TJ McConnell, Aaron Holiday, and Justin Holiday  I feel like 3 TJ's is way more unlikely."
"Every Knick ever.  Jordan Hill, Justin Holiday, David Lee, DRose, Joakim Noah, Jamal Crawford, Shumpert, JR Smith, Amare, Sasha Vujacic, Alexei Shved, Lou Amundson, Zach Randolph, Sheed, Tyson Chandler, Wilson Chandler, Jason Kidd.  Scrubs to stars after at least one failed season youll always be a knick to us baby"
