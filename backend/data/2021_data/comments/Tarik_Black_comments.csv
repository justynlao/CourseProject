"Bro we went 11 deep that year. Harden, CP3, Ariza, Tucker, Gordon, Capela, LRMAM, Gerald, Ryno, Nene, Iso Joe  And that's not even counting Tarik Black who played 51 games (don't think he saw playoff minutes though)."
over the summer when he first got there he apparently got wrecked by tarik black
"&gt; Faried, Rivers, Green, House, Nene, Shumpert was a better bench than freaking washed Joe Johnson, Tarik Black, Bobby Brown, Ryan Anderson, and whoever else they had.  I don't know where to begin. Faried, Rivers, Green and House were all guys Morey picked up off the streets. Nothing to do with Fertita. Nene was already on the team dating back to 2016. Shumpert was a deal to get under the luxury tax in which we traded Brandon Knight plus a first round pick to acquire. Less than a year earlier we traded Ryno plus a first to acquire Brandon Knight and Chriss. These moves were all made with the objective of getting under the Luxury tax. Let me ask you who that benefits?"
"It's so easy, lazy, and lame to ride the ""Blame Fertitta for everything"" train.   Yes, he should've kept Ariza. Luc Mbah a Moute has been injured for like the last three years though, so I'm not sure how that would've panned out (especially since MDA has such a short leash). Other than that, they actually improved the bench in the next season. Faried, Rivers, Green, House, Nene, Shumpert was a better bench than freaking washed Joe Johnson, Tarik Black, Bobby Brown, Ryan Anderson, and whoever else they had.   Yes, Fertitta cut costs as much as possible, but those teams were always packed with role player talent. If Harden wanted to ship the latest co-star and get a new one, they did it. A lot of this is on Harden and his flawed mentality/lack of heart as well."
"2014 Rockets. Dwight was injured over half the year, centers were Tarik Black and Joey Dorsey. Two other guards are 37 year old Jason Terry and Pablo Prigioni. 14 guys on that roster are no longer in the league. Harden still dragged them to 56 wins and a WCF appearance. Curry with comparable players can't even crack 30 wins, let alone a playoff berth."
Yea that’s the craziest part. We had a like 3/4 season long stint were freaking Nick young was playing above average on ball defense while being backed up by rookies and the shell of Roy jibbers/Tarik black
"Lakers in the bottom 10 in FT and about dead last in 3% currently, yes? Add that to not having AD meaning our defense is also shit.   Turrible basketball is only fun to watch if you have guys like the Catalyst, Tarik Black, LA D-Fenders legend (former name of South Bay Lakers for the newer nephs) Ryan Kelly level players  Not fun watching your GOAT with solid role players on paper underperform as bad as this"
"I'd say your comparison of the two rosters is disingenuous.   First of all, you're comparing Golden State's bench to Houston's starters AND bench. Second, GSW's bench included guys like Iguodala, Livington, Barbosa, Speights, Bogut (I know he technically started but he played bench level minutes). On top of that, they had a starting lineup of 3 All-Stars. That's more all-stars in one season than Harden had in his entire Rockets CAREER.  Now lets take a look at Harden's 2015 roster, which he made the WCF with. Ariza, Howard, Beverley were his best teammates. This was followed by Matiejunas, Tarik Black, Corey Brewer, Isaiah Canaan, Troy Daniels, Prigioni, Josh Smith, Francisco Garcia, Joey Dorsey.  &gt; The true diff between the current Warriors and then Rockets roster, is that the Rockets were aggressive in signing players and acquiring talent to help Harden.  And yet, Steph's 2021 Warriors team is still more talented than a lot of the teams Harden played with, particularly the 2015 and 2016 Rockets."
How I felt about 2015-2019 lakers tbh I used to whoop serious ass in 2k with Jordan Clarkson Ryan Kelly and Tarik black and them. 2018 and 19 especially we were just so fucking bad but god forbid the warriors or a good team came to town we’d ball the fuck out. I think the year before lebron came we went 4-0 again Spurs warriors rockets and okc but lost all to kings and other dogshit team
"For sure there were some good parts about it, none of toxicity or doom &amp; gloom in every game thread because we're losing by a few points in the 2nd quarter. Hell if we were even close in some games it was a cause for celebration. I remember the dumb blind optimism that mostly didn't pan out (Xavier Henry, Mini-Mamba, Tarik Black), but sometimes did (Jordan Clarkson is about to win 6MOTY &amp; only some obcessed Lakers fans wouldve believed that possible half a decade ago)."
I remember seeing a lot of Tarik Black vs Christian Feliciano match up cards
"Lol that’s a load of bullshit, harden made the WCF and was 2nd in the west in 2015 with Trevor ariza, Terrence jones Josh smith, Corey Brewer, patrick beverley, tarik black, Joey dorsey, Jason Terry, 41 games of washed howard, taking up all the minutes lmao  He’s a great fit with green, harden and green screen and roll would be lethal. What a dumb comment"
"He hasn't. And this year will prove it. Harden averaged 40 a game to take James Ennis, Tarik Black, Austin Rivers, and a Washed Melo from the 14th seed to the 3rd seed. This season just confirms it to most people."
"James Harden vs Curry debate will be over. Remember when Harden averaged 40 a game with James Ennis, Austin Rivers,  Gary Clark, washed up Melo, Tarik black, and Brandon Knight? He took them from the 14th seed to the 3rd seed."
Is that a Tarik Black jersey flair?
Tarik Black would've eaten Drummond alive
Jaylen Brown  Jalen Green  Coby White  Michael Redd  Tarik Black  Aaron Gray  Derek Rose  Hassan Whiteside  Cam Reddish  Red Robbins
He even made Tarik Black look playable
It was until they started hacking Tarik Black...
Why did he hate Tarik Black so much? Jfc
"Oh no, that 2015-16 roster was just.... ugh  Kobe  Roy Hibbert  Brandon Bass  Lou Williams  Nick Young  D-Lo  Jordan Clarkson  Julius Randle  Larry Nance Jr  Anthony Brown  Tarik Black (one of my favorite Lakers during the down years)  Marcelo Huertas (the fucking GOAT)  Robert Sacre (the other fucking GOAT)  That's 13 out of 15 I can remember. I'm too lazy to check but I think Metta World Peace was also on it or maybe I'm thinking of 2016-17"
D'Angelo Russell   Jordan Clarkson   Kobe bryant   Luol deng   Roy Hibbert   Larry Nance JR   Tarik Black   Timofey Mozgov   Nick Young   Thomas Bryant   Julius Randle   I know I'm missing like 2-3 guys for sure
"Lol. Well, if you are Tarik Black, sorry for talking shit. 😅 I’m just a random dude who shoots maybe 15% from the field, at best, and that’s when I’m wide open and right under the rim, so my opinion on the performance of any player doesn’t really hold much weight. 😂 Definitely better to have him on the team than not when Capela was out.  If you are Tarik Black, good luck overseas! I looked you up to see who you were playing for and saw you won a championship and got some awards, so you’re clearly playing well!"
I would sit through five more Sacre/Ryan Kelly/Tarik Black/Ellington seasons of it meant a championship in the sixth
Tarik Black must be proud that so many members of his family got good jobs
"The reason why I think the Lakers are a good example is because I knew people would look only at Lebron joining.  I'll admit, that was a product of our city and the team's legacy.  But Lebron isn't the product of tanking, AD is.  And its not that AD wanted to join our team, the reason tanking worked is because *we wouldn't have had the assets to trade for AD if we didn't tank*.  That's why tanking is a success story for the Lakers.  Even if you accept everything else about the Lakers drawing power for free agents, we still wouldn't have been able to get AD if we didn't get that #4 pick, or the consecutive years of #2's.  Had we actually tried, we would have been worse off even if Lebron did decide to join us.  As for the Timberwolves, I think you're doing what I said people are doing and making the wrong comparison.  The wrong thing to compare isn't tanking and non-tanking teams.  Ask yourself how good would the Timberwolves be vs. themselves if they didn't suck.  A Timberwolves team that didn't have KAT and had a bunch of middle first round picks.  They couldn't pair that up with Jimmy Butler and go to the playoffs, we've seen them suck for like 10 straight years, there's no reason to think they wouldn't have missed the playoffs for another decade like that.    Same thing with Philly.  Imagine they didn't have Embiid and Simmons and didn't go to the playoffs, but became Kings East.  They could have languished in the #10-15 seed like Detroit has with no future.  Speaking of Detroit, imagine they kept Blake and tried to make the playoffs every year.  We all know he's way past his prime, but could maybe give you a good game once a week.  Instead of Cade, they'd get some random pick in the #11-20 range because they were able to ride Blake and some other vet they traded for to the #9 seed.  And they decided to keep those guys together and try again next year with.  They would be worse off than they'd be sucking for the last few years and getting Cade.  I'll speak on the Lakers again since I know them the most.  In those years, we got guys like D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, and a bunch of random players like Robert Sacre, Chris Kaman, Tarik Black, Lou Williams, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Jordan Clarkson, Marcelo Huertas, Ivica Zubac, Brook Lopez, etc.  Some of these guys are pretty good role players, Brook just showed he isn't dead and helped to win a championship, even played a pivotal role in one of the Finals games.  As pieces, a lot of them can fit into a good team.  Clarkson was just 6th man of the year, Lou Williams has won that a couple of times, Julius Randle just posted a great season and lead the Knicks to the playoffs, D'Angelo Russell has become a more consistent shooter and fun player to watch, Zubac is probably an above average center on a team with championship aspirations.  But is that a championship team?  Can any of those guys realistically even now lead you to a championship?  Remember, without tanking we don't get Brandon Ingram, or Lonzo.  We'd get maybe Thon Maker, or Georgios Papagiannis (the wrong Giannis!), or TJ Leaf, or Frank Ntilikina, or Coby White, Trey Lyles, etc.  Pelicans don't want those guys for AD.  We're not trading Stanley Johnson as the centerpiece in an Anthony Davis trade, we'd be luck to get Ed Davis in a trade!  Yeah, it was pretty brutal to watch for a while, but so what?  The owners are almost all billionaires, I don't shed any tears for them, they'll never be homeless or miss a meal.  Let the arena be empty, let them lose money, this is a long term plan and when you win, the fans will come back, guaranteed.  Or they could mismanage the team for decades and have what the Kings, Wolves, and Magic have right now.  I doubt Philly or the Lakers would trade their team for those players."
Tarik Black
"I thought Tarik was a great backup for us, and thought he would hang around the league a bit longer. Unfortunately there's just not many roster spots for undersized bigs who can't shoot (Faried, Thomas Robinson, Black)"
Big Black Tarik
"IQ doesn't always translate to BBIQ. Tarik Black was one of the smartest players off the court when he was in the league (graduated in three years, got his master's while still playing college ball), but he had poor BBIQ. It's a rationality/intuition thing...if you think rationally during the game, you're toast...it has to flow naturally through intuition."
Turiaf  Dj mbenga Tarik Black
"The hell, Tarik Black is playing in the Summer League?"
Is that Tarik Black? Lakers legend?
Tarik Black
"Lol, giving me ptsd flashbacks. And the fans that didn’t actually watch any laker games would say that we had a core of randle, Ingram, ball, Clarkson, etc. so we were bound to be good.  Hell no.   These players only bloomed once they left LA. They were inconsistent and unable to develop under the scrutinizing media and laker spotlight. Lakers are one of the top sport organizations nationally and globally and have a reputation of always being a contender for the championship while doing it in “showtime” fashion. As much support and love we could give those guys a team starting Xavier Henry, Tarik black, Cory fucking brewer, and Robert sacre would not even be a solid bench squad.   Those times were so dark I even contemplated if I should get a Xavier Henry jersey."
"Tarik Black? I see you my guy, one of the OG laker fans.  The goat backup to Robert Sacre."
Nah there’s a Tarik Black that played on the Rockets and Lakers not too long ago https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarik_Black
"Why are their NFL draft picks in here?  Jabrill Cox, Tarik Black"
Tarik Black Jr??? Wasn’t Tarik Black in the league like 2-3 years ago?
"Way to assume shit. Even when we had those guys, I jump didn't ship. I even wished Ryan Kelly would pan out but he didn't. My favorites during those years were Tarik Black, Jordan Hill, Jodie Meeks and somewhat Nick Young."
"jordan clarkson,wayne ellington, ryan kelly,tarik black, robert sacre. Motherfucking sacre."
That Lakers lineup with Tarik Black. Just a crime against humanity.
Tarik Black
Derrick White &gt; Tarik Black.
"I was gonna say Adam Morrison, but someone beat me to it. So instead I’ll go with Robert Sacre, with Tarik Black as my backup"
I think Tarik Black was on his way to lift after the game when his teammates attempted to tunnel into the Clippers locker room.
"Dwight only played 41 games and was ass because he wanted to run inefficient post ups instead of the PNR with Harden, one of the best PNR ballhanders in history.  Capela played 12 games.  &amp;#x200B;  Beverly played 50 games.  &amp;#x200B;  Get a load of some of these dudes that started more than 10 games fo them that year: Isaiah Canaan, Tarik Black, Joey Dorsey, 37 year old Jason Terry, Terrance Jones. Donatas Motiejunas started 62 games that season.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Steph beat the Blazers. Calm down. The Blazers shouldn't have been there and only were because of that late season fuckery of the Nuggets throwing games and a weird ass buzzer beater pushing the Rockets to the other side of the bracket. Anyone woulda swept them."
Ryan Kelly and Tarik Black getting minutes on the floor at the same time.  Actively dreading the hellhole the Lakers will become when Bron leaves.
"Tarik black, ryan Kelly Robert Sacre etc"
[Here's one for Tarik Black](https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nba/players/full/2528393.png&amp;w=350&amp;h=254).
"Frank Mason, wayne selden, tarik black, perry Ellis, jamari traylor. For a college team, basically stacked at every position. Really dropped the ball that year."
Tarik Black formerly of the Lakers :(
Tarik Black. I miss my guy
Tarik Black is still alive?¿
🤣🤣🤣🤣 time to get Jeff Green back. And maybe Tarik Black.
Warriors fan are more delusional than Laker Nation mid tank about Tarik Black developing into a solid starting center.  They're a 6 to 8 seed best case scenario.
"Make it an award, name it after Tarik Black"
"Unless the Lakers run that lineup with Ryan Kelly, Tarik Black and Robert Sacre as their starting 5 again, they’re never really all that irrelevant.  Plus, this clip is just plain bad effort, like nobody even bothers to rotate before the pass is thrown. It’s been an issue with the Lakers this season and I’m just highlighting it."
Well before he got there they had to pretend guys like Robery Sachre and Tarik Black were going to be good
"He was never that skilled and his touch around the rim was woeful, his move was i'm bigger and stronger than you and i will bully you  And then he spent years refusing to play PnR with one of the best PnR players ever that has made Tarik Black look good"
