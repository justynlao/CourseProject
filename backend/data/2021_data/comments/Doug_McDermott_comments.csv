"i mean, anybody who seriously thought doug mcdermott would be one of the best players from that draft would get laughed at just as much then and they do now  this isn’t even mentioning that Embiid was the clear cut can’t miss prospect except his injury"
"&gt;Justin Holiday, Aaron Holiday, and TJ McConnell... Doug McDermott... Monta Ellis... TJ Warren... Myles Turner  Seriously?  How deep did you expect these guys to take you in the playoffs?  Every team has dealt with injuries.  The Hawks have been ravaged by injuries this year.  Despite that they are 25 - 11 under Nate.  Never underestimate the value of good coaching.  Not saying he is an all time great but it's obvious he did a great job with what he had in Indy."
"It's not about his players, it's about the lack of adjustment that kills him. He doesn't want to draw from his bench like more successful teams do. He does well in the regular season despite injuries because he's forced to use other players, case in point was last year in Indiana when everyone except TJ Warren missed games. He pushed guys like Justin Holiday, Aaron Holiday, and TJ McConnell and the team won more games with their injured roster than in his two other years.  His problem is that when team rotations invariably get tighter in the playoffs, he refuses to adjust. Doug McDermott and Aaron Holiday barely got any run even when the team shat out 8-12 point quarters against Boston. He continued to start the undersized and already on his way out Monta Ellis against the Cavs. Sabonis was killing the Cavs in limited minutes in 2018 and he refused to pull Myles Turner, who was getting dominated by Tristan Thompson in Game 7. In that same game, LeBron sat for a long time in the 4th and he refused to put Oladipo in."
that’s a good list. i always get tj mcconnell and doug mcdermott mixed up in my head lol
As would Doug McDermott
"Edmond Sumner, Oshae Brissett, and Doug McDermott are officially apart of NBA history."
"Pacers offered y’all a pick, turner, and Doug McDermott for Gordon Hayward but ainge was too busy trying to finesse them that Hayward had already gotten an offer from the hornets and it fell through"
Bro you can't really think HB is the same player he was in high school lol. THat's coming from someone who watched him win state with Doug McDermott.

Yo Doug McDermott wtf is that statline
Doug McDermott
Doug McDermott cannot be tamed! Best player alive
Put McDermott and sabonis back in to pad stats. Doug has tied his career high in points and domas needs a 20-15-15 at least.  Could get 20-20-20
"He ""only"" had 38 in total for that game. Incidentally only 3 players scored for the Knicks in the 4th quarter, THJ, KP, and Doug McDermott (who eventually played for Dallas too)."
"Our size is 6'7"" Brisset, 6'6"" sampson, and Doug McDermott....who isn't exactly a known rebounder."
I think they are. Maybe a bit of bias but we absolutely  maximized what we could get with the Carmelo Anthony trade and also with the Doug McDermott trade
"Holy shit that's a huge paragraph.  &gt; I really don't think it took hindsight to see that the core and not the coach was the reason for the mediocrity.  Uh, no. This is still wrong. You've just exposed the fact that you've never watched the Pacers properly.  Of course, if you give any team LeBron, they're probably going to the finals. Nate was an incredibly mediocre coach. No rotations, no mid-game changes, no time given to young players, Turner had no place in Nate's game, bad timeouts, no passion, ""we just gotta execute"" every post-game interview, ISO offense every possession, no 3s taken at all, no ball movement, a collapse every 3rd quarter.  Another point, no one cares about the first round exits. We cared that we got swept over and over. Last year's Heat were pretty weak, they weren't in a groove going into the playoffs and we had a super hot Bubble Warren. We may not have had Sabonis but as we perform best with only Turner, it shouldn't matter. Spo made adjustments all game, because he's a great coach, and countered everything Nate did all game. You know what Nate adjusted? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The same lineups at the same timings every game, the same offense, the same defensive style, etc. and it fucked us. The series was predicted to be 6-7 games.  And no, don't bring up the Bucks, after a rough performing series they really kicked it up a notch against Milwaukee.  Reminder that even the Magic won a game against the Bucks.  &gt; coaches criticised the firing. They don't come out often and say that.  [Yeah, coaches totally don't always back up other coaches, I bet it's not even notable or a well known fact.](https://twitter.com/ByTimReynolds/status/1366542471505846278?s=20)  &gt; Every team has injury troubles this year  Before Oladipo was traded, we played 4 games of a full starting lineup. 4 starters, and 3 whenever Oladipo was out, possibly less. Caris was out, recovering from cancer, over 24 games (officially) as a Pacer. That's 3 starters for over a quarter of a season. Since Caris has started playing, we've had 3 starters out 6 times and 2 starters out 7 times. We've even had only Caris being uninjured once.  Don't forget the injuries to Jeremy Lamb and Doug McDermott, who are meant to be leading our bench.  Out of the last 23 games (games Caris has played), we've had every starter but TJ Warren 9 times. That's 14 games of injured starters."
Doug McDermott
"That's a kind of selection bias, you're focusing on players who stuck in the league.  Also I don't think most of those guys are enormously better than they were as rookies, most just got more of a chance and are more sure of their strengths and weaknesses, and some improved their shooting a bit.  But think about the counter examples.  Off the top of my head just from our team I recall Grievis Vasquez, Nick Calathes, Sam Young, Hakim Warrick, Stromile Swift, Dahntay Jones, and O.J. Mayo (wasn't old but was picked because of polish on his game, a floor pick).  They got chances to play early on but they just kinda were who they were for their whole careers.  Mayo even got clearly worse his whole career.  And when you open it up to guys who were never even good enough to get a chance that list grows by leaps and bounds.    For every Pascal Siakam there are 5 or 10 players like Michael Carter-Williams and Doug McDermott."
"PG - Ricky Rubio  SG - Marcus Smart  SF - Doug McDermott   PF - Thaddeus Young  C - Enes Kanter    There's no one on the team that can take over and be the main scorer on a night-to-night basis, neither Rubio or Smart are so deadly or consistent from 3 that I think opposing teams would be content with letting them both shoot the amount it'd take for them to create positive offense, McDermott and Young are both role players that'll give you 10-15ish points a game, and Kanter even if he has a god game like he did recently, could still be abused defensively."
"At least you got a first from us for him. You drafted Jusuf Nurkić and traded him(with Gary Harris) for Doug McDermott. You then traded McDermott, Taj Gibson, and a second(Mitchell Robinson) for Joffrey Lauvergne, Anthony Morrow and Cameron Payne. All those guys left the team that offseason."
"I mean Grant, Adams, Oladipo, Kanter, Roberson, Sabonis, Taj Gibson, Doug McDermott.   Thats not exactly an all star team but those are all strong role players."
Real Doug McDermott hours
"What’s reasonable? Doug McDermott is averaging 13 a game on 10 attempts.   On 16-18 attempts a game, he could average 20.  FYI, there are 39 players in the league with 16 or more FGA per game."
Doug McDermott could absolutely average 20 a game on a bad team.
Peopel act like Caris is Kobe around /r/nba   He is an inefficient chucker. should eh is a lot better than starting Justin Holiday or Doug McDermott but it sn't like he is an all star talent that is going to turn aroudn our team.
"If Doug McDermott is still an NBA player, no reason why Lauri won't stick around."
"1. Domantas Sabonis (best, not most valuable) 2. Myles Turner 3. Caris LeVert 4. Malcolm Brogdon 5. T.J. McConnell 6. Justin Holiday 7. Doug McDermott 8. **Edmond Sumner** 9. **Goga Bitadze** 10. Jeremy Lamb 11. Aaron Holiday"
"Taj Gibson and Doug McDermott for Cam Payne, Joffrey (idk how to spell his name) and Anthony Morrow. Cam Payne was the only one who stayed on the team past that season. Taj was great in his role and would’ve been a great veteran presence in the rebuild but GarPax didn’t wanna pay him *checks notes* 2 yrs/$28M. Before people say that’s a lot for Taj Gibson. The Bulls were rebuilding and never took on a bad contract during those tanks years."
Gotta go back 7 years for context but the Bulls traded picks that became Gary Harris and Jusuf Nurkic to draft Doug McDermott then traded Doug McDermott and Taj Gibson for Cameron Payne.
"Hm. I think Gordon Hayward, Goran Dragic, Payton Pritchard, ~~Tyler Herro~~, Duncan Robinson, Cody Zeller, and Doug McDermott are more similar to Larry Bird than Kevin Durant is."
"&gt;According to sources, at the beginning of free agency Indiana was the preferred destination for the former All-Star. As the two front offices went about discussing the logistics of executing such a move, it is rumored to be the case that C’s General Manager, Danny Ainge, got “greedy”, for he wanted more than just the reported initial offer of Myles Turner &amp; Doug McDermott and, instead, wanted Victor Oladipo to be apart of the trade.  It was Ainge who was the idiot. He asked for Oladipo. Your comment makes it seem like he didnt want oladipo. I'm not going to ho through the timeline because I have better work to do. Also reports come out generally 3-4 days after the trade talk. That's just common sense. They were negotiating 3-4 days before the report came out."
"2016 Warriors  Literally any SF besides Harrison Barnes. Give us Doug McDermott we winning.  2020 Clippers  Kyle Lowry  Hot take, but this team is obviously missing a floor general and playmaker, I think they would have imploded much less last season with Lowry at PG"
"He is being forced to be our ""star"" when he was signed to help out Dipo.   He has the balli n his hands way too much but the alternative is Doug McDermott and Justin Holiday. WE just have no one that can score really  (and sabonis isn't nearly as good as r/nba thinks)"
"Oladipo was a decent 3pt shooter in his first year under McMillan at 37% and dealt with knee injuries before the big one in 2019, so it was fair to say that his shot percentages with Indiana were affected.  Warren was a 40%+ shooter in the last two seasons, so that sorta makes him good, you do realize that? He shot 40% under Nate's system, so he was a pretty decent shooter as well  Sabonis was never a 3pt shooter anyway.  Besides, Justin Holiday, and Doug McDermott are excellent shooters under McMillan and Bjorkgren, with Doug being incredibly misused under McMillan"
"Probably just your first part about ""a bunch of good role players"". The rest of what you said is true, but I'd hardly call Sabonis, Oladipo, Brogdon, and Warren role players. Those are All Stars or solid 2nd/3rd options. Role players are guys like Doug McDermott and Justin Holiday."
Doug Mcdermott would be a superstar.
I still find it hilarious how Indiana’s backup power forwards are often Justin holiday and Doug McDermott
"Part of the issue with this is the idea of ""the natural PF""  The power forward position today is just the default position many guys who you arent quite sure what to classify get labeled as. Unlike the 5 teams are able to get away with putting guys at the 4 alot easier. You have someone like DeRozan a 2 much of his career who just almost skipped a position to become a 4 and its fine.   Tons and tons of small ball 4s or guys who would never be considered 4's 10-20 yrs ago who are 4s now and their teams survive fine. Doug McDermott has been a full time 4 for multiple years now."
We’re currently starting Justin Holiday and Doug McDermott. Levert and Warren will both start once healthy.
"Off the bench? We start freaking Doug McDermott, Lavert ain't coming off the bench lol"
Don't forget Doug McDermott and DJ Augustin.
"Doug McDermott my guy. I swear Jack, Matt and Leo have a fetish for that guy"
Dates back to the tie s when you guys couldn't overcome Tony Snell and Doug McDermott on the Bulls lol
"Channing Frye, Doug McDermott, and. KD"
Heat are one Jae Crowder replacement away from making a second run. They miss his switchability.    * Rudy Gay? * Doug McDermott * Otto Porter * Danny Green * Bobby Portis  I don't know but they need that gap filled and then it's all gravy.
[Doug McDermott by average speed last season.](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/speed-distance/?sort=AVG_SPEED&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=MIN*GE*20&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season) Can't say that would have been my first guess lol
We have 5 guys 22 and younger and 3 guys 25 and younger on our roster that matter. We're going to trade Thad Young and after that the oldest core guys on our roster will be Doug McDermott and Derrick White who are 29 and 27. We're already one of the youngest rosters in the entire league lol
I think he would be more like a worse shooting Doug McDermott. With a little better passing maybe
So basically Doug McDermott if he has skills and work ethic and Jimmer with humility and work ethic?
"Timberwolves, Suns, Spurs, Knicks, Nuggets, Hawks, Pistons.  PG: Chris Paul (2nd)  SG: Hamidu Diallo (5th)   SF: Michael Porter Jr (3rd)  PF: Danilo Gallinari (6th)  C: Karl-Anthony Towns (1st)  6th: Derrick Rose (4th)  7th: Doug McDermott (7th)"
"Starters:  PG: Chris Paul  SG: Paul George  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Jonas Valanciunas    for my 2nd unit, I decided to only use 2 non bench players to make this a tad bit more challenging  6th: Lonzo Ball  7th: Jordan Clarkson  8th: Myles Turner  9th: Joe Ingles  10th: Montrezl Harrell   Reserves:  Mathisse Thybulle  Doug McDermott"
"There's a world in which Juancho is a productive player as well; I know a lot of Wolves fans have said that he's mostly bad, which is true. However, he has skills: he can shoot the 3 ball, he's shown being a better than average cutter, he has some really nifty finishes at the basket (and also misses right handed layups about half the time). Our coach talked about Juancho being a really clever player, maybe in reference to his cutting, but I can imagine him having a rapport with Smart, since Smart's a try anything sort of playmaker and Juancho is certainly going to try to put himself in position to receive the ball. Honestly, as mediocre and inconsistent as Juancho has been, it's kind of a brilliant trade on Brad's part, especially with the third year team option on Juancho's contract. His high end outcome is probably something like Doug McDermott who is better at floaters than finishing around the rim."
"Doug McDermott, obviously"
"I said something like ""Doug McDermott is or could be the white Steph Curry"".🤣😂🤣😂 Admittedly I don't watch college basketball, just start researching players once a team I like drafts them before the season starts. He's still a good shooter and I'm sure the Bulls mismanaged him a good bit, but wtf was I thinking lol."
Your team being United and having a good relationship isn’t going to stop the Spurs from being one of the 3 worst teams in the west next year. Doug McDermott isn’t going to be the difference maker to determine if they win games or not lol. At the end of the day you’ll probably be a bad competitive team similar to the Pistons last year and end up with a top 5 pick in a draft that projects to be pretty strong at the top.
"yes?! we just took out demar, rudy, patty and added mcdermott and figurately derrick white (since he was missing last season and he is our best and most complete player) and luka samanic and add tre jones too. and add the fact that all these young guys are finally free to play instead of always rely on the vets that mostly ballhogged and after covid hit us were pretty bad (patty and rudy). also consider that our defense was extremely atrocious with demar since he was our 4 and he has no size and also he's a bad defender. and also add the fact that all these young guys gained another year of improvement and were devasted after the grizzlies game and i think they have a sense of revenge as they expressed in the interviews. they all have a nice relationship between them and i think a united team is the most important thing in competeting. and also before we got badly hit by covid, we are in the playoff range and performed well in the half of the season.  we fixed our biggest problem of last season that was spacing in the starting five and we got doug mcdermott that is one of the best active shooters in the league (i think he is 9th). he also adds size, thing we need, even tho keldon johnson grew over two inches, he said in an interview during the olympics. not saying doug is better than demar, but surely he is such a better fit and also let the other players such as dejounte and derrick and even keldon do their work, something that rarely happened when rudy, patty, demar were out there, same goes with the bench  so i'm not saying we will go out there winning tf out, but just that we are not as bad as the media and most of the fans think."
"Doug McDermott, Lonnie walker and Mr. Considerations. Lol"
"The Spurs had the least amount of 3PA attempts last year. While the Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson aren't knock down shooters, taking them out when you already lost Patty Mills and Rudy Gay leaves you with an absolutely nightmare. Bryn Forbes and Doug McDermott can help but neither of those guys are volume shooters. Due to Simmons being about the worst free point shooting guard in the regular season - at least 10% behind every other guard the last 3 seasons aside from Westbrook and RJ Barrett - where do the volume of points come from for the Spurs now? They won't scale at all by adding Simmons. If you want him to be the tank commander, fine, but I'm sure trading a combo of Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson next season will get you more in return to build around than Simmons.  Who cares if he got voted All Star? What does he bring that actually helps the Spurs improve or get to the playoffs?"
"A player playing on the franchise tag by definition isn’t being allowed to get their value on the open market. Literally anyone being forced to play on the tag, I’ll use marcus maye cause i’m a jets fan, is making less than doug mcdermott this year. And mcdermott has years actually guaranteed"
People are confusing their signings with bad contracts. Were the Doug McDermott and especially Zach Collins signings a bit...random? Sure. Were their contracts bad? Definitely not.
Chauncey Billups  Mike Miller  Doug McDermott  Tim Duncan   Ben Wallace  Great outside shooting and insane defense down low
Steve Nash  Michael Jordan  Doug McDermott  Chris Bosh  Michael Olowakandi
"Facts. The lack of a second ballhandler or someone that was at minimum an ok threat to score is what plagued us. Rose saw double and triple coverage so often due to that. The regular season record the Bulls had then belies some of the struggles the offense had. Rose had to go Super Saiyan just to pull out wins because we had no one else that was a consistent offensive threat. You’d think Kyle Korver would have helped, but he had an uncharacteristically tough time shooting while he was with us. Running 2 PG lineups with CJ Watson and Rose left a lot to be desired on perimeter D, so you lost as much on one end as you gained on another.  This is another reason breaking up Jimmy and Rose was devastating. We finally had a backcourt parter that could help and we damn near stole a series from the Cavs, but the FO was short sighted and didn’t give Rose and Jimmy time to gel or keep the talent that worked with them. They traded Deng at his peak because they were too cheap to pay him. Have an aging (but still good) Pau Gasol a contract even though he didn’t fit our timeline. Let Kyle Korver go for nothing. Passed on Gary Harris and Nurkic for Doug McDermott. God there was just so much wasted potential."
"One, no one cares about the pie that belongs to anyone else but themselves.  When Tobias Harris or Chandler Parsons got their big contracts they didn't stay up at night crying about if Doug McDermott is going to have enough to feed his family.  Two, the 49/51 split as far as I'm aware does not inlcude luxury tax. If all teams abide by the cap you would have the split you're talking about, but they don't.  Teams routinely will overspend for these players and pay out of pocket.    You're looking at this from a very holistic viewpoint where the pie as a whole stays the same size, but agents exist so that their guy gets a bigger piece of the pie.  If we were all ants or perfect socialists we'd be ok with what you're saying, but we're not."
"Corey Kispert, Doug McDermott, Bojan Bogdanovic"
"All my homies hate Doug McDermott, Edmond Sumner is our best friend now"
"And we all know who those dudes are, too -    Garrett Temple, Kawhi, and Doug McDermott"
"Of the draft lottery picks only 3 have become All-Stars - 2 for the first time last season.  1. Andrew Wiggins   2. Jabari Parker   3. Joel Embiid   4. Aaron Gordon   5. Dante Exum   6. Marcus Smart   7. Julius Randle   8. Nik Stauskas   9. Noah Vonleh   10. Elfrid Payton   11. Doug McDermott   12. Dario Šarić   13. Zach LaVine   14. T. J. Warren  Of that lottery draft class who do you put above him? Obviously Embiid, LaVine, and Randle but thats pretty much it. Maybe a case could be made for Marcus Smart ... realistically I can't be consider him a bust if he is the 4th most successful player in the lottery."
Doug McDermott.
"Here is my quick attempt off the top of my head,  *Sabonis does not count even though he is American born. He represents Lithuania internationally and clearly has embraced that culture, his dad was just playing in the States when he was born.  1st Team  Tyler Herro- Joe Harris- Duncan Robinson- Gordon Hayward- Brook Lopez  2nd Team  Alex Caruso- Kevin Huerter- Pat Connaughton- Kevin Love- Cody Zeller  3rd Team  TJ McConnell- JJ Redick- Doug McDermott- Zach Collins- Mason Plumlee or Frank Kaminsky  The issue is that there are much better guards than forwards and especially centers. I feel like Donte is probably better than JJ at this point, but I gave Redick the legacy choice."
"The Bulls traded Doug McDermott and Taj Gibson for Cameron Payne, who proceeded to play some of the worst basketball you have ever seen. Payne looked like what you would imagine a random guy getting picked off the street to play in the NBA. He literally, multiple times, fell down while bringing the ball up the court. I'm glad he has put it more together with the Suns, but it was one of the worst trades I have ever seen. I'm glad we have new management!"
"I hear you, but we still traded away 2 first-round picks to move up 4 spots to take…. Doug McDermott"
We also traded 2 draft picks that ended up being Jusuf Nurkic and Gary Harris for Doug McDermott.
"Okc sends Anthony Morrow, Joffrey Lauvergne and Cameron Payne (when he was terrible, and Chicago personnel later said he shouldn’t be in the NBA)  Chicago sends Taj Gibson, Doug McDermott and a 2nd round pick"
Anyone know the odds on a Doug McDermott MVP?
At least you got Doug McDermott now

Doug McDermott is mentally penetrating.
 Doug McDermott is cooking us alive
"I mean, literally every front office drafts for different needs. Not everybody is looking for high-risk high-reward players. Plus you’re completely ignoring that rookie contracts can be some of the best values in the league. I’d rather have someone like Duarte on a rookie scale than overpaying for a veteran wing like Doug McDermott or something  Edit: not to mention many “low ceiling” guys end up improving much more than expected"
We gave Doug McDermott a 3 year 42 mill contract
"They are one of the tiniest markets out there that is trying to remain competitive during Pop's final years. It's not surprising that they haven't been able to fully rebuild since Kawhi screwed them back in 2018. Unlike other stars Kawhi really screwed over the Spurs by playing the injury card, demanding a trade and being clear that he would only play in LA.   Past 5 years they have gone from: team that is contending with prime Kawhi Leonard and all star LaMarcus Aldridge to rebuilding all while trying to stay competitive during Pops last few years.   They've never fully tanked and had the opportunity to draft a high lottery pick in the last 5 years, so judging them on not being able to draft a star in the 10-30th pick range is a bit of a stretch. Since 2016 they've won 67, 61, 47, 48 games and then 33 and 32 in the shortened seasons (about a 38 win season). It's hard to draft good talent when you are winning a lot of games, but even then the Spurs have done a great job at finding talent late in the draft, not just during Pop's early years but also in the last 5 years.   In the past 5 years they:   **2016**: Drafted Dejounte Murray at #29, he's blossomed into a great player, averaging 16/7/6 last year. Signed Bryn Forbes as an undrafted guy who has become a lethal 3PT shooter and highly coveted role player.   **2017**: Drafted Derrick White at #29, he just averaged 16/3/4 and has a decent 3PT shot. In a redraft he goes top 10 easily.   **2018**: Signed Drew Eubanks as an undrafted 2 way who has turned into a nice big who can play 10-15 mpg, traded a disgruntled Kawhi for DeRozan, Poeltl and a FRP, not a great trade, but if Toronto doesn't win a title that year, it goes down as an okay trade given the fact that Kawhi would've left that next offseason and Toronto would've lost their best player for nothing. They also drafted Lonnie Walker at #18, he's turned into an okay role player averaging 12 ppg last year. Then they traded DeRozan for another FRP, Thaddeus Young and Al-Farouq Aminu. Toronto got 1 year of Kawhi and a Cinderella run at a title, Spurs got 2 FRP, a starting C and PF and a 3 year rental on DeMar DeRozan. Again not a great trade but if Toronto loses in the ECF it IMO is a trade the Spurs won.   **2019**: Drafted Keldon Johnson at #29, he averaged 13/6/2 last year as a sophomore, great numbers for a near second round pick. Redraft he goes top 10.   **2020**: Drafted Devin Vassell at #11, he looked okay, averaged 6 ppg as a rookie and playing \~17 mpg. Could fizzle out, or could be a solid role player, hard to tell this early.  **2021**: Drafted Joshua Primo, time will tell if it's a good pick, Got Zach Collins and Doug McDermott for nothing,    For a small market team, that's trying to compete still and only drafting in the 20-30 range, they have done remarkably well. Continually drafting starter level players at the 29th pick is wild. If they don't think Samanic is a NBA talent they are probably right. He's a sub 28% 3PT shooter, poor rebounder, poor defender and showed no development. They've gone from imploding contender to young team with nice assets and a great shot at a top pick this year to build off. A 2-3 year rebuild is actually pretty great for a non LA/Miami/Brooklyn team."
"Doug McDermott is like, a freak cutter.  I love Aaron Gordon, and Jake Layman is/has been a great cutter.  Willie Caulie-Stein has always been a cutting big I've had a soft spot for.  Naz Reid is coming along, his weight loss keeps adding so much burst and he's got such good touch on the finish."
Doug McDermott. He has a nicer offensive package than people realize. He is absolutely an elite backdoor cutter in the league.
"Summer of 2005 my mom took me on a vacation to California. I was only 13 at the time. We had rented a car and decided to stop at a hotel on a whim at around 4 pm to just relax at the pool and have a quiet night before a few busy days at the next hotel.we were staying at. Well, it was the team hotel for some Lakers training and/or rookie camp, which the front desk employee disclosed to us (looking back on it, I'm sure she absolutely was NOT supposed to openly share that information) and literally right next door to our room was Smush Parker, who was a total asshat. He had music absolutely banging that was shaking our room. Anyway, my mom, a 5'2"" woman, first attempted to just knock on his door to politely ask him to turn it down a little bit. He, in as kind a way as one can do so, pretty much told us to piss off.   We decided to just switch rooms so we'd be able to sleep later. On the way to the reception desk, we walked by Ronny Turiaf, who, until that point in my life, was the closest thing on a Monstar I'd ever seen.  We get to our new room, and decide to go to the pool. We walk into the hallway and head toward the elevator and holy shit now the new biggest person I've ever seen, Andrew Bynum, is walking by. We asked him if he knew where the pool was because we were disoriented being in the new room, and he kindly gave us directions there.  This was back in the days where we didn't have smartphones or laptops/tablets with us on vacation, so I had to remember the faces and general size of all of them so I could fire up the DSL a week later when I got home and search on Yahoo for the Lakers roster to figure out who they all were. Bynum was by far the nicest in our minimal interaction.  Honestly, it was all so ""who cares they're just people"" type stuff but 13-year-old, rabid NBA fan me was blown away and clearly it's stuck with me. Was just a random cool experience to have that was completely unexpected.  Sidenote: part-time for a few years I would beer vend at Wrigley Field for a stand a couple distant cousins ran for decades, and I served beers to a few athletes during that span, including Doug McDermott and Robbie Gould. IIRC both of them tipped well, and I believe McDermott ordered a Heineken and Gould had a Shock Top Belgian White. You could tell they appreciate service where people just treat them like normal customers who want a beer, and not feel the need to ask them about their team/acknowledge who they are. Unfortunately some vendors wouldn't be able to help themselves with some celebrities who would come through (often times they'd be there for first pitch or 7th inning stretch).   The worst was Kevin Hart, who was being literally chased by fans through the concourse and I could see/hear multiple vendors even calling out for his attention. It was embarrassing human behavior."
Doubt it. Small market teams with more cap space than they know what to do with will be fine trading for THT at his salary. They know they aren’t attracting any high level free agents so they might as well swap out the expiring contract for an intriguing 20 year old who you have control of for the next several years. If he works out that price tag will look like a bargain. If not then there’s no harm no foul really. Would teams really prefer that cap space goes to someone like Doug McDermott instead?
"Kispert really is JJ Reddick/Doug McDermott in every way haha, he's going to light teams up but get tortured on defense"
And also Doug McDermott from outta no where lol
2011 - fareid to mirotic  2012 - Evan Fournier to sullinger  2013 - Rudy Gobert to livio jean charles  2014 doug McDermott to Dario saric  2015 - mudiay to Stanley Johnson
"Jimmy Butler &gt; Bojan Bogdanović  Marquis Teague &gt; Festus Ezeli   Tony Snell &gt; Gorgui Dieng  Doug McDermott &gt; Dario Saric  Bobby Portis &gt; Rondae Hollis-Jefferson  A slight downgrade for the bulls since I’d rather have JB, Bobby, and Doug McBuckets. Of course it really wasn’t as exciting seeing as we had generally low picks these years since we were a solid playoff team."
"I was actually pretty pleased with our moves this offseason. We didn't make a big splash but we won't be a terrible team and we got a good first and Thad Young in a sign and trade with DeRozan. Doug McDermott is a low risk signing that will fit well with our roster. Zach Collins is a low risk signing that probably won't work out great but if it does, he'll be on a steal of a contract."
Klay Thompson (Booker) Isaiah Thomas (CP3) David Robinson (Ayton) Khris Middleton (Bridges) Shane Battier (Crowder)   Off the bench   Devin Harris (Payne) Doug McDermott (Johnson) Andrew Bynum (McGee) Greivis Vásquez (Shamet) Nenad Krstić (Kaminsky)  Yeah I’d say that’s a pretty good team.
"Unfortunately, TJ McConnell and Doug McDermott are heading to unrestricted free agency this offseason, and both might get seriously paid, which isn't something we should commit to."
"He wasn’t scouted properly in his league   Hell even the Denver Nuggets picked Doug McDermott over him with the 11tj pick  Plus, he was not a sure fire prospect at all. It took him a while to develop plus there was the Nurkic situation"
"Roster construction isn’t a factor when we didn’t have a healthy starting unit at all this year - I’m not sure how many games with more than 3 healthy starters we had tbh. Warren out for season. Dipo trade for Caris who then had a tumor removed. Turner spent significant time at the end of the season hurt. Brogdon missed some games. Sabonis missed a few but was really the only healthy player all year. Guys like Justin Holiday, TJ McConnell, and Doug McDermott started for quite a bit of the season and these guys did well but they’re never meant to be 30+min per game kinda guys... That was the biggest factor to our underwhelming year  Secondly, Nate just sucked. He implemented some flat out terrible defensive schemes. He never once adjusted his approach to game plan (the wizards for example average about 140 points per game against us and he never changed how we guarded Westbrook in a single game). So much zone defense half the season, that was abandoned halfway through. Lot of Brogdon and Sabonis two man game - to the point those guys complained and wanted to change the offense up to involve more of the team.   I actually believe the majority of this roster could be a great sum of its parts kind of team but our biggest issue is staying healthy. Year in and year out we lose important players come playoffs and we just crumple once we lose a starter. I imagine guys are available but I doubt we aggressively pursue trades for the sake of trading. Kevin Pritchard has made some damn good trades in his tenure here, we just haven’t had a good draft record so we really need to get this years pick right.   Right now, we lack identity as a team. Are we offensively minded with Sabonis or are we going to lean into defense with Turner (if we even trade one which we might not). Pritchard said a lot about getting back to being a hard defense team so I imagine there’s a priority there to improve on that. Would not be surprised if few moves are made this offseason, would also not be surprised if it’s wildly different next season. Hard to say and our FO never gives any insight about it either."
"Yes, it would be bad for the league. Small markets might have a decent chance of one day beating the big free agent teams.  Whats good for the league is having the best players demand buyouts and trades to the biggest markets. David Stern once said his ideal finals is Lakers versus Lakers. If the league had a choice, the All Star game would be a preview of the Finals. The best player on Indiana would be Doug McDermott.  Basically 5 Globetrotters, 25 Generals."
"I think it can be hard to judge the talent on a team when there's such a ball-dominant player on the team. Westbrook's MVP year got called out for ""get him some help"", but look at the guys on that team that flourished when they left and got more touches: Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Jerami Grant all played 1,500+ minutes that OKC season.  Even folks like Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and Cameron Payne are playing key minutes this year for decent teams."
"Richuan Holmes. John Collins. Lonzo Ball. Doug McDermott.       Probably lose THJ to free agency, but would love to have him back.      Trade Zingis for... Wiggins?"
Where does a guy like Doug McDermott Fall? Average role player in the NBA but also the all time leading scorer in NCAA history.
Doug McDermott is closer to being Reggie Miller 2.0 than Donovan is to being Wade 2.0
He wouldn't even be in our normal rotation.  Dude is balls. HE ain't playin over Doug MCDermott or Oshae
Bro the celtics literally passed up Myles Turner + Doug McDermott + 1st round pick for Hayward last off season. Why would they want Myles Turner again lol?
The way I've always understood it is that Hayward was interested in the Pacers and the Pacers offered a S/T of Myles Turner and Doug McDermott. Ainge wanted Oladipo and Turner and talks stalled for so long that Charlotte swept in and offered Gordon a max.
"sure! there's JJ Redick, Joe Harris, uh...  *checks nba.com*  Grayson Allen, Arcidiacono, Alex Caruso, Zach Collins, DiVincenzo, Ellenson, Eubanks, Kyle Guy, Hayward, Herro, Huerter, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Luke Kennard, Luke Kornet, Jake Layman, Meyers Leonard, Garrison Matthews, Dakota Mathias, TJ McConnell, Sean and Doug McDermott, Sam Merrill, Mike Muscala, Mason Plumlee, Payton Pritchard, Duncan Robinson, Matt Thomas, Dean Wade, Dylan Windler, and Cody Zeller."
"Not a Heat fan, but thought Justice Winslow was gonna be the next Kawhi type late lottery killer wing. By the way, Danny Ainge should be really happy Charlotte (or Miami) did NOT accept all the first rounders he *supposedly* was willing to trade to get him.  I didn't invest too much in Doug McDermott, but I thought he'd be a decent NBA starter. Not so much. That lack of quickness/athleticism really mattered in his case.  Pretty sure I bought WAY HIGH on Jeremy Lin stock in 2012 (but I am sure I am not alone). It could never come back up to the price that I bought in at... It still makes me sad how his career just kind of petered out...  I thought that Shaq on the late version of the Nash Phoenix Suns teams could actually take them over the top and get them to the finals... that's a stock I bought high based on past performance... boy was I wrong."
"Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Gary Trent Jr., Ja Morant, Collin Sexton, Doug McDermott, Lou Williams, CJ McCollum, Tim Hardaway Jr."
"Also, Chicago traded 16 and 19 (Nurkic and Gary Harris) for 11 (Doug McDermott) and a late 2nd. So yeah, 12-14 sounds like a good guess"
"Damian ""Doug McDermott"" Lillard"
"SFs like Doug McDermott:  look at me take this guy defending me off the dribble!  SFs like Jimmy Butler:  wait, I was defended?"
Doug McDermott robbed
"What? Are you happy with this season?  Where was the help?   We had 3 G League players playing mins in the play in games.   We have another 4 G league players off the bench in Payton, Bell, Smailafuck and Mannion.  Why did he let the DPE expire? At least trade for something useful, like say, SHOOTERS?   Doug McDermott was available at the deadline and they didn’t even try to make a move.  Stop defending your boyfriend Bob Myers"
It's been a while since I saw Doug McDermott.  Nice to see he's doing well.
Give Doug McDermott the ball you cowards
Shocking lack of Doug McDermott in all of these lineups.
"One of my favorite basketball clips is all five defenders on a college team collapsing on Doug McDermott when he gets the ball under the hoop, and he gets it out to Wragge for a three"
"LEBRON WITH THE EYE GAME, CEMENTING HIS LEGACY AS THE GREATEST PLAYER IN PLAY-IN HISTORY BEHIND DOUG MCDERMOTT"
Doug McDermott snub
&gt;Doug McDermott knows what it’s like to lose  Playing for the Bulls will do that to you...
"Doug McDermott knows what it’s like to lose… to feel so desperately that he’s right, yet to fail nonetheless. It’s frightening, turns the legs to jelly. He asks the Hornets, to what end? Dread it, run from it, McBuckets arrives all the same, and now it’s here… or should he say, he is."
"Don't expansion teams automatically get the top pick in the draft? Like Seattle gets #1, Vegas gets #2, then Vegas picks first from the player pool?   If you're Seattle and you go in knowing you have Cade, that changes things dramatically. I also think you focus on free agency (you have crazy money to work with, starting from scratch) and use the expansion draft to round it out.   I'd get Cade, then pursue solid guys in free agency who I know are probably going to go for the bag, or young guys you could overpay and gamble on. Guys like Otto Porter Jr, Tim Hardaway Jr, Cody Zeller, Doug McDermott, Lauri Markkanen, Malik Monk.   Then in the expansion draft add Winslow, Thompson, Okogie, Okpala, Holiday, Arcidiacono  Cade/Payton/Arcidiacono  Monk/A. Holiday/Okogie  Hardaway/Porter/Winslow  Markkanen/McDermott/Melli  Zeller/Thompson/Okpala  I think this team has a good balance of young guys and vets, it makes up for a lack of star power with depth, it'll be about as competitive as an expansion team can be.  Good spacing, good size, nobody too old."
Doug McDermott and Brisett dropped 20+ each.  We looked like we did not care at all. Our defense looks just as terrible as it has all season.   James Borrego should be fired... out of a cannon.
Oshae Brissett and Doug McDermott just put together the greatest play-in performance of all time.
"Hear me and rejoice! You (Charlotte Hornets) have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Dougie McBuckets. You may think this is suffering. No... it is salvation. The universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile... for even in death, you have become children of Doug McDermott."
TJ McConnell and Doug McDermott
"Pacers shooting 46% or better:  Doug McDermott, Oshae Brissett, Justin Holiday, Domantas Sabonis, Malcolm Brogdon, T.J. McConnell, Edmond Sumner  Game MVP:  Terry Rozier"
I wouldn't worry. The hornets look fucking lost out there. Doug McDermott went nuclear in the first quarter and Charlotte looked like they just accepted the loss immediately
Who needs LeVert when you got Doug McDermott?
"Of all people, Doug Fucking McDermott"

Bruh Doug McDermott with 14 in 5 minutes what the actual fuck
Fun fact: the Bulls traded up in the 2014 draft to take Doug McDermott. Zach Lavine was taken two picks later.
"Doug McDermott, who has a 40 3p% and a 59 TS% for his career, can't shoot?"
What in the scouting report revealed that Doug McDermott wouldn’t be able to shoot in the NBA?
Yeah. That’s why there are tons of guys who were nuts in college and trash? Because scouting right.  Jimmer Fredette? Josh Jackson? Doug McDermott? Tyler Hansbrough?  The NCAA is trash tier basketball. Better off playing overseas IMO

So I did a 2k rebuild and this is how I won a championship.  Did a sign and trade with lauri markkanen for Dejounte Murray.  Signed Drose and Doug McDermott to a 1 year deal.  Bulls made 2nd round and lost in 6   The following free agency sign Lavine and KD and won it all lol

Kawhi - superstar obviously but I feel like he'll just stay home  DeMar - definitely had a career resurgence but I think a huge part of that has been him moving to the 4. If this is a point you'd want to debate though I'd be happy to listen because there definitely is an argument.  Doug McDermott - see above   Otto Porter Jr - high on the guy but extremely injury prone   Norman Powell / Will Barton / Josh Hart - undersized for the 3  Batum - Potentially an option but he's getting up there in years and I think he'll only be motivated on a true contender   Oubre / Fournier - solid players but flawed and really don't get teams like the Blazers over the hump  Iggy / Ariza - Old
Greater than who?  Doug McDermott?
"Damian Lillard, Danny Green, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid   George Hill, Shake Milton, Reggie Bullock/Doug McDermott/Patty Mills, Paul Reed, Dwight Howard   They could end up with something like this if they can make it Maxey and not Thybulle."
Doug mcdermott
Edwards and Lavine were the first two that came to mind.  Some other vets may be capable of sometimes baiting Giannis into a position he can't recover from.  Doug McDermott this past season showed it against lesser defenders at least.  Bait the 3pt shot then duck by them to finish at the rim (he finished at about a 70% rate.  getting a raise this off season even if his defense and some other parts of his game are lacking).
"That's basically what happened with the Pacers, too, when he was here. Everyone was quick to credit Dan Burke, but McMillan coaches up defense everywhere he goes. Guys like TJ Warren, Doug McDermott, Bojan Bogdanovic, etc. were all known as scorers and sub-par defenders before playing for the Pacers. I'd categorize all of those guys as average or above-average defenders now. McDermott mentioned in an interview that a big part of it was approach and buy-in. They tailored specific defensive assignments based on likely player matchups, so it was easier to follow from a defensive standpoint."
It’d be hilarious if it was like Doug McDermott who instigated the next brawl
"Doug McDermott to coach: Put me in coach, it's all psychological in the end."

Oh boy the 26th pick and a 3 point shooter. Might as well just re-sign Doug McDermott and keep our center.
Pacers already have Doug McDermott
There definitely wasnt last offseason. I know J Michael said that around the league many teams viewed Turner as a slight negative asset. They were willing to attach a first to move him and Doug McDermott for the right to give Gordon Hayward $105 mil.
"Justise Winslow. Thought he be a premium wing, injuries hit and he just clearly wont be the player I thought he would.   Doug Mcdermott has had a solid career but I thought he would be a long term starter and major piece for teams.   Jared Sullinger is a guy I also thought would be a long time starter, borderline all star.   I was young and didnt put a lot of thought into why other than I liked watching them in college and thought they’d only get better in the nba."

"Not to the same extent. There are still a lot of majority white teams in D1, especially at smaller schools. And I have no data to back this up, but I feel like there are more prominent white players in college than the NBA.   Like generally some of the top college players in the country will be white juniors and seniors who end up getting drafted but not making as much of a splash in the NBA. Think Frank Kaminsky, Doug McDermott, Tyler Hansbrough, Luka Garza.   Almost all the white All-Stars in the NBA are European. Whereas you have plenty of white American superstars in other sports. Tom Brady, Mike Trout, etc"
"The way he's played defense this year, Doug McDermott."
"Expect it at this point. Someone who really shouldn't pops off for 20-30 on us. (See Jalen Brunson, Doug McDermott, rookie season Tyler Herro, Jeff Green, Mo Wagner, etc)."
"He's had his usage cut fairly significantly with Carlisle in, and he lost the teammate he worked with best in Doug McDermott. I think all his post stuff looks the same, but maybe less opportunities to create from the high post like he likes."
For sure.   Doug McDermott is another example of that tok
Holy shit Doug McDermott is still in the league
"Harden had a better team lol. Dude was surrounded by shooting, Russ would've absolutely feasted with that roster. Instead he was running into a brick wall in the paint every time he drove because the Thunder had 2 ""shooters"" on the entire roster, one of whom was a rookie that you probably don't remember (Alex Abrines) and the other wasn't really that much of a shooter (Oladipo). Later they picked up Doug McDermott and played him like 20 minutes a game.   The Thunder had a decent defensive squad (I think they were like 10th best), but the Rockets had wayyyyy more offensive fire power and a way better second scorer in Eric Gordon.   It was a close race but I think Russ had the bigger carry job to pull off. The Rockets were underrated before the season because their defense was supposed to be bad without Dwight and they didn't do very well the last season. But their roster was a perfect fit for D'Antoni's system and they filled the Dwight sized hole in their roster with more shooting role players.     I wish the Thunder had kept Ibaka that offseason, would've made a huge difference for Russ and the Thunder that season. No Oladipo because there's no trade, but Ibaka being their stretch 4/5 would've been huge."
"dirk was holding harrison barnes and doug mcdermott back, just giving dirk a taste of his own medicine"
"We have one of the youngest rosters in the league lol. Everyone that gets playing time on our team is younger than 30 except Thad Young and we've been trying to trade him. Doug McDermott is the only other older guy that sees the court and he's a great role player to put around young guys since he can shoot, cut, and knows how to play."
"&gt; Duke Zion was easily a top 25 player in the world  These were the 25 highest scorers in the 2018 season. Harden, PG, Giannis, Embiid, Curry, Booker, Kawhi, KD, Lillard, Beal, Kemba, Blake, KAT, Kyrie, Donovan, LaVine, Russ, Klay, Randle, LMA, DeMar, Luka, Jrue, Conley, D'Lo.  Players not mentioned: LeBron, McCollum, Vuc, Jokic, Butler, Simmons.  He's definitely not easily a top 25 in the world.  &gt; There is also zero chance Montrezl averages 35 points in college.  Guys like Markus Howard averaged 28, Chris Clemons 30, Doug McDermott 27, Jimmer 29. In his prime, full grown man strength Trez could definitely hit 35. Most NCAA centers are twigs, they need time to gain mass, Trez would eat."
"we honestly """"""just"""""" need a superstar which we are aiming to get this draft by selecting high high. paolo banchero fits like a glove here. DJ, Jakob, Vassell, Keldon, Primo are staying here longg term (as for now) and would build a really solid team in the future, but, as I said, we need that superstar PF (casually the same position as Timmy). Then add Derrick White and Lonnie Walker IV: we are still figuring out what to do with our SG position, wr have ton of guards. In any case, the ones that we do nog keep would provide us a good value in return. Same goes with Doug McDermott and in an immediate future Thaddeus Young."
Doug McDermott  Jonathan Simmons  Elfrid Payton  Aaron Gordon  Mitch McGarry  Perry Jones
"We need a 3 point contest of Duncan Robinson, Davis Bertans, Joe Harris, Seth Curry, Doug McDermott, Wayne Ellington, and Matt Thomas"
"The thing is he does a lot of little things on the court too. He's an absolutely fantastic screen-setter and appears to do many things to free up open shots for teammates. Even when digging into what everyone on Indiana does, I think Sabonis is the best player. Brogdon also has a negative +/- and Turner has been negative the past two years, before being positive now.  Another thing to remember is that Indiana is one of the deepest team in the league  when healthy. Even with Warren and Levert injured, their bench has TJ McConnell, Jeremy Lamb, and Doug McDermott. Probably why for the most part, they will have lot of players near even."
Also don't forget mini raptor killer Doug McDermott who randomly pulled 36 out of his ass against the Raptors
Lebron and Doug McDermott.  McDermott would probably be the first option
I think it'd be the funniest thing ever if you turned around and traded him for Myles Turner + Doug McDermott + FRP
"Gordon hayward wants to play for the pacers. Pacers offered myles turner + mcdermott for hayward last year and that was rejected by the celtics who wanted oladipo or tj warren with myles turner instead of mcdermott. Gordon Hayward’s value at the moment is around what the Pacers offered last season, and some would argue the pacers were overvaluing him by adding mcdermott. The celtics were definitely brazen by trying to swipe oladipo or tj warren instead, but thats just how danny ainge plays the game. I would stay his value is what the pacers offered last season. Myles turner + doug mcdermott or myles turner + a 1st round pick."
"Damn, Doug McDermott snubbed *hard*. They need to expand the All-Star roster to 150."
Next year Doug McDermott 💪
"Are we talking on the court or off the court?  On the court, guys like Pat Bev, even Russ come to mind, even though by all accounts they're friendly and polite off the court/to fans etc.  Off the court, I have heard that Doug McDermott is a dick.  But I forget why tbh, just remember reading that."
Doug McDermott is gonna be the next Steph Curry. Yep.
They could have had Myles Turner and Doug McDermott for Hayward instead of losing him for nothing.  They were not interested since they thought Tristan Thompson was a better fit for the price.  Turner is going to be top 5 in defensive player of the year voting / the clear starting 5 and McDermott would be the first guy off the bench for them.  It’s an egregious mistake.
"Taj Gibson, Doug McDermott and a second-round pick to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Cameron Payne, Anthony Morrow and Joffrey Lauvergne  Maybe not the worst but I still don't understand it"
"Oh you right. I could have sworn I didn't see the star next to last season on bkref.   I guess I just think it's crazy that he got selected twice, in 14 and 15 but not in 16 and 17. When he made that extra jump in terms of quality of play and production.  Yeah, AD is a good example. And agreed, West has been stacked as fuck. Kinda outdated model like the playoffs seeding. Just get the best, most deserving (and popular I guess) players in there.   Also reading through the votes, players really don't give a fuck at all. Doug McDermott (and others, just the only name I remember now) got like 6 or 8 votes to be a starter. I'd be like stop fucking around or you won't have a say, anymore."
"I don’t know how anyone can look at those numbers and tell me that player doesn’t deserve to be an allstar. If a random player like Doug McDermott was averaging those exact numbers, playing the same way Zach has, shooting the same shots and leading the team the same way, I’d argue that he’d be a guaranteed allstar too"
That’s NBA legend Doug McDermott to you 😤
Looks like the start of a movie about Doug McDermott.  “You’re probably wondering how I got here...”
Are Sean McDermott not relative to Doug?
The virgin Doug McDermott versus the Chad Naz Reid
No because that makes zero sense. If the Suns had the 2nd pick they wouldn't have taken Devin Booker. Shit the Nuggets took Jokic at 41. They took Doug McDermott at 11 that draft. I'm pretty sure they thought Doug McDermott was going to turn out better than Jokic.
"Plus Doug McDermott, who has been great for us this year."
"And they ended up with nothing. Well there is that TPE that celtics fans think is gonna solve all their problems. Feel like people forget that the TPE itself isn't worth anything, Celtics still have to give out something of value. Whereas they could have gotten Myles Turner and Doug McDermott essentially for free."
Homer take but the Pacers have a very underrated bench when healthy  PG: Brogdon / Aaron Holiday / TJ McConnell   SG: LeVert / Jeremy Lamb  SF: TJ Warren / Justin Holiday  PF: Sabonis / Doug McDermott  C: Turner / Goga  Goga's the only raw guy.

"I just watched Doug McDermott drop 26, pretty sure he’s a shoe-in for the ASG"
"&gt; Learn how drive to shoot the closer mid-range shot, or attack the rim  Doug McDermott is having the best year of his career simply because he learned how to do a straight line drive and right hand layup. Attacking the basket is a hugely valuable skill for a shooter."
"Love it when the Pacers roll out the White Christmas Lineup: Aaron Holiday, Justin Holiday, TJ McConnell, Doug McDermott, Domantas Sabonis."
"&gt; only real perimeter threat night-in  Doug McDermott and Justin Holiday, two of the best shooters in the league? In the last three TJM has a BPM of +11, and Brogdon's is -58. It's not an end all be all stat, but it isn't nothing either."
Op asked who's the better player not who has the best legacy. We don't know what would happen if he was born in this era for all we know he could've been a slightly better  rich mans Doug McDermott so it's pointless to ask those questions
"Just peeked at the Spurs roster - remembering they lost DeRozan (their leading scorer), Patty Mills &amp; Rudy Gay (arguably their two best guys off the bench) - and it's looking a little dire. Dejounte Murray &amp; Doug McDermott are probably their top two scorers this season - maybe Derrick White too? Spurs were last in 3pt shots made &amp; attempted per game &amp; 24th in 3pt%. ""McBuckets"" will help with that, but I think at this point the Spurs might be best just to Choke for Chet (Holmgren).  Orlando seems to have a slew of players who aren't really starter material yet but someone's gonna have to do it. Where's their offense coming from, guys who can't stay healthy?"
You think Doug McDermott would push shaq to the max?
"What does white even mean?  Eubanks was born in Massachusetts, Doug McDermott was born in North Dakota, Weiscamp is from Iowa, and Collins hails from Navada but everyone else is either foreign or a person of color.  Poeltl is Austrian, Landale is Australian, Samanic is Croatian, Primo is Canadian, Aminu is American and Nigerian, and Forbes, Jones, Walker, Johnson, White, Vassell, and Hutchison are all American and people of color.  Damn, it took this guy's racism to realize our team really sucks.  Here's hoping for a high lottery pick.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
"* **TRE JONES**  He barely played with the main team, but he had an impressive season in the G-League Bubble and also a crazy amazing Summer League. He fits all our needs for PG off the bench since he provides playmaking and defense, what is needed to let flourish go-to-guys scorers like Lonnie and Devin  * **LUKA SAMANIC**  He also had a really good season in the G-League Bubble. He played some games when Rudy Gay was out because of COVID and he was impressive. Defense was really good and shooting too. He definitely still needs to get comfortable out there, but once he clears his mental side of basketball, he has all the tools to succed and he is coming at the perfect time!   * **DOUG MCDERMOTT**  Really solid signing from us. Solid contract too. He provides us shooting, Top 9 active career shooters, easily our biggest need. He has size too. He was interviewed and the way he spoke seemed genuine and really happy to embrace a role of mentor of the team, the veteran guy to help everyone unlock themselves!  * **ZACH COLLINS**  Low Risk, High Rewards Signing. Just 1 Year Fully Guaranteed, then Partially, Then TO. He would fit really well if he stays healthy. Shooting, good defense, rebounding, and size. Literally what we need from out bigs!  * **JOCK LANDALE**  Just 1+TO Minimun Contract. Amazing deal! MVP in the NBL! Again, he provides everything we need from the bigs: shooting, size, rebounding, defense. He will get some minutes!  * **JOSHUA PRIMO**  I doubt he will see the floor this year, he will mainly play in the G-League! Nice since he really do not need him to play as of now. He showed really good flashes in the Summer League, that IT factor that can mean something!  Then there is **Thaddeus Young**! I already count him our since he doesn't fit us at all: he is already on the market. I think he will deal him before the beginning of the season since he has 17 Players.  Chandler Hutchinson will get cut, he have too many players. I think Al-Farouq Aminu will be too if Thaddeus Young is kept or dealt as we get another player back that is better than Aminu or if somehow the Forbes' deal falls, still unofficial signing..."
Doug McDermott.
They finally decide to offload large contracts in order to sign…Doug McDermott.
Doug McDermott

"IDK why so many people think the spurs have a chance at being the worst team in the league. We went 6-5 without DeMar this year, Patty played bad in the second half of last season, and we replaced Rudy Gay with Thad Young. I expect us to be only a few wins worse than last year.  We basically replaced Patty Mills with Bryn Forbes, Rudy Gay with Thad Young, and DeMar DeRozan with Doug McDermott. The biggest drop there is McDermott but he fits better with our roster, plus Derrick White missed half the season last year and he probably would've been our second best player last season if he was healthy."
Doug McDermott $$
"Bro it’s absolutely hindsight. It’s all speculation. Guy had never played an NBA game up to that point. Saying you *knew* he’d be great is sus. Tyler Hansbrough and Doug Mcdermott are some of the greatest college players of all time, imagine someone saying they “know” this player will be great.   I’m sure there’s more but the only player I can possibly think of where most people *knew* they’d be great before they played in the NBA is Lebron James."
John Collins 25  Evan Fournier 19.5  Spender Dinwiddie 18  Gary Trent Jr 17  DeMar DeRozan 28  Kyle Lowry 30  Jarrett Allen 20  Duncan Robinson 18  Tim Hardaway Jr 19  Normal Powell 18  Derrick Rose 14  Doug McDermott 14  I think 20 for Lonzo is fine
More akin to Doug McDermott
"There was an amazing stretch of time when the Raptors COULD NOT beat the Bulls. Home, Away, Alternate jersey night, Doug McDermott not in the lineup, nothing made a difference. It made finally squeaking out a meaningless mid season win against them feel like a playoff series clincher."
"Counterpoint: so was Doug McDermott and he’s turned into a valuable role player over time, which is how I see Garza’s career turning out."
lol isn’t Doug McDermott the all time leading scorer in NCAA history?
Doug McDermott is a moderately-wealthy man's CJ Miles.
"Bulls fan here. Almost all our guys we drafted post Jordan era showed flashes of stardom but ended up being sort of nothing:   Ben Gordon, Luol Deng, Tyrus Thomas, Taj Gibson,  Doug McDermott, Nikola Mirotic, Bobby Portis, Denzel Valentine, Lauri Markannen, Wendell Carter Jr.   No, I don’t count Derrick Rose. He won MVP, all star starter, blew out the big 3 Heat in the ECF in Game 1, and single handedly stopped the Linsanity."
"Yeah but so were Tyler Hansborough, Doug McDermott, Jalen Brunson, Jimmer, etc.  No disrespect to those guys, all the first 3 were all able to find some type of roles in the NBA, much more so for Dougie &amp; Jalen, but examples of dominant college players being average NBA guys (not that that’s bad)  Garza’s weight loss I think also makes him a different type of player/prospect that media guys weren’t expecting"
Sure.  Jakob and Doug McDermott are our two best players right?
"My first thought was Doug McDermott, now what that says about me? Idk"
PG: Lebron $39  SG: Ant $11  SF: KD $42  PF: Bobby Portis $4  C: Dan Gafford $4  Bench: TJ McConnell $3  Bench: Doug McDermott $4  Bench:  Matisse Thybulle $4
"Ha statmuse's per possession stats have to be janky. I looked it up [since 1980](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/most-points-per-100-possessions-by-an-nba-player-minimum-7500-minutes-since-1980) and there's no way Joe Harris, Doug McDermott, and JJ Redick score 130+ points for every 100 team possessions."
"This isn't the worst in terms of losing out on a star or a championship or anything but it still baffles me years later:   Bulls trade Taj Gibson, Doug McDermott, and a 2nd round pick to the Thunder for Cam Payne, Anthony Morrow, and Joffrey Lauvergne.   If you only look at the players in that trade the Thunder win the trade easily. I know Payne isn't bad now but at the time he was meme-tier trash for both OKC and Chicago. Morrow was totally washed and out of the league after that year. Lauvergne was an end of bench guy who never did anything.   Why the hell did Garpax feel the need to throw in an extra pick?"
Doug McDermott was also solid as our best shooter at the time.
"same here, and we had two opportunities to it. Our GM before this draft would always draft FIBA guys, but nah this time he picks Doug McDermott from Gonzaga and a loval hype machine"
"To say the least lol he’ll be paid 1/3rd of 29 year old Doug Mcdermott. Huge get for Boston but idk what they do with it, it’s a transition year for them otherwise."
Didn't think Doug McDermott would make it but here we are
Doug McDermott
"you lost your best player in DeMar DeRozan, a great point guard in Patty Mills, and replaced them with Doug McDermott, who is ok but nothing special, a center who has played 8 games since the start of 2020 but is going to get paid 22 million dollars over three years, and Bryn Forbes, who is fine at best. you also had maybe one of the most whack lottery picks in recent history"
"how did we have a worse offseason lmao. we signed one of the best 9 active 3 point shooters in the league in doug mcdermott and gained 1 protected 2nd and a swap 2nd, signed a couple of solid pick ups for cheap, gave zach collins a contract to see if he can stay healthy and try to flourish, we traded an 31yrs old unrestricted free agent for one 1st, two 2nds, aminu, thad young who can be flipped for another 1st, we drafted the youngest player in the league who looks amazing (from someone who would have rather have others). hos is this worse than yours?"
"kinda glad the spurs didn't get this guy lmao. i'm fine with doug mcdermott and especially with Thaddeus Young, 1st, 2 2nds."
"Doug McDermott, Zach Collins, Domantas Sabonis, Drew Eubanks, Kevin Love.  They’re hard working, lunch pail type of guys, with a high basketball IQ."
Taj Gibson and Doug McDermott to the Thunder for god damn Cameron Payne. I still get nightmares from Gar/Pax. So glad we’re doing better now
This is our most action filled free agency in years and all we got was Doug McDermott.
"When fucking Doug McDermott gets $42/3, how can Monk just be a minimum player?"
"Im not sure why but I always lump him, Steph, and Doug McDermott in the same bucket"
Maybe this will happen to Lauri markkanen some day. Maybe he goes to Europe. Maybe he matches Doug McDermott.  Hardly to find out if he stays with bulls I'm thinking it's europe.
"&gt; Drafting LaMarcus and trading him for Tyrus Thomas  *screams internally*  &gt; Trading Korver for nothing  This infuriated me to no end because I loved Kyle Korver  &gt; Trading Nurkic and Gary Harris for Doug McDermott, then trading Doug McDermott, Taj Gibson, and a second round pick for Cameron Payne then waiving Cameron Payne  *actual screaming*  God fucking dammnit we really traded up for Doug, then traded him away before his rookie contract was even up for a bunch of absolute garbage. And we threw in Taj Gibson as well, what the fuck  And as it turns out, it took a while but Cam Payne is actually decent, but we waived him."
"Yes, I could see him get $15-20m for a 1-2 year deal in the current market. Not for more years though.   Doug McDermott got $14m/yr."
"If we are, why pay Doug McDermott instead of going after someone like THT with that money? Why sign a 30-year-old (almost) role player instead of a 20-year-old with upside? Why bring back Bryn Forbes? Why not already be in talks to flip the guys who are coming back from Chicago?"
"I always confuse Tony Bradley with Thomas Bryant, so at first I was excited that the Bulls got a guy like Nikola who could stretch the floor from center. Then I looked up Tony Bradley and realized he's not Thomas Bryant, but Bradley's advanced metrics are still pretty solid (20+ PER in limited minutes, for instance). So, I'm in.  Anyway, it's nice to have a solid offseason after two decades of going through things like:  * This is Phil's last year no matter what/Breaking up the best team in league history to satisfy Krause's ego. * Thinking Marcus Fizer was a small forward/an NBA player * ~~Asking Tracy McGrady if he'll shave his cornrows~~ \[Edit: Turns out I may be conflating two different stories on this one.\] * Drafting LaMarcus and trading him for Tyrus Thomas * Signing late era Ben Wallace and trading early era Ben Wallace (I.E., Tyson Chandler) * Picking the wrong Italian head coach (Del Negro instead of D'Antoni) * Striking out on LeBron, Wade, Bosh to get Boozer (who was admittedly solid and goofy) * Making Luol Deng get a spinal tap * Trading Korver for nothing * Running Thibodeau out of town * Trading Nurkic and Gary Harris for Doug McDermott, then trading Doug McDermott, Taj Gibson, and a second round pick for Cameron Payne then waiving Cameron Payne * Hiring Hoiberg to run a modern perimeter-based offense then signing Wade and Rondo * Giving up on Bobby Portis because he struck a Spaniard * \[Some additional edits\]: * [~~Jim Boylan~~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Boylan) The wrong [Jim Boylen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Boylen). * Waiving Dinwiddie (thanks to u/darealcubs for the reminder) * Just the bewildering love affair with all things Iowa State. * Trading for John Starks * Completely forgot about the short-lived John Salmons era that ended with the Bulls trading Salmons and draft picks that turned out to be Isaiah Thomas and Larry Sanders for Joe Alexander and Hakim Warrick * Not locking up Rusty LaRue on a long term deal.  Not sure I got this all in chronological order, and obviously there were some really fun Bulls teams in there (the scrappy Ben Gordon-led teams and the Derrick Rose + Bench Mob teams of the early 10s), but I am very happy with what the Bulls have done this past couple of days. This is 100% me being a homer, but I think the only teams in the East that are clearly better are Milwaukee and Brooklyn. (""Clearly"" being the key word there.)  Anyway, I'm wearing the shit out of my Bulls hat today and now I need to stop procrastinating and get back to work."
"It's silly for you to try and redirect the attention from your healing process to the Spurs roster moves, especially because it seems you're unaware of them.  The Spurs signed Jock Landsdale and re-signed Bryn Forbes, both good moves.  That's on top of getting some trade assets from the Bulls and adding Thaddeus Young and Doug McDermott, a quality shooter.  But you didn't ask to be informed, you tried to make a hurtful comment (yet again).  I see you and I acknowledge you are hurting.  Whoever hurt you can't hurt you anymore.  You are loved.  This is a safe place no matter how much you try and self-sabotage."
7 million is way too little lol. Doug McDermott gets 14M a year and is a significantly worse player than Alex Caruso if you look beyond the most superficial stats like points scored per game.
"GarPax basically lied through their teeth saying ""we're gonna get younger and more athletic"", they then proceed to sign D-Wade &amp; Rondo who had a combined age of 64 at the time  Even when they did make trades, it was completely stupid. Like trading up with multiple picks just to get Doug McDermott in the 2014 draft. I think we gave up Harris &amp; Nurkic to the Nuggets? McDermott didn't even finish his rookie contract on the Bulls  GarPax can fuck right off, I don't ever wanna see those 2 fucking frauds involved with the Bulls ever again"
"that’s 3 picks, one of which was the 8th pick, one of which is very likely gonna be a late first round pick and the one in 2025 which is rumored to be protected. we also have a young player with potential in pat williams and a young all star in zach lavine. care to explain now how exactly we have 0 future for the next 5+ years ?  &gt; garpax had us contending for a decade before blowing it up and bringing in lavine( a great move)   LMFAO we were serious contenders for like two years and even in those two years the heat were much better than us. GarPax made great moves such has handing out a massive contract to luol deng so we didn’t have the cap space to bring in wade, bron and bosh when they literally wanted to be here, trade the picks used to draft nurkic and harris for doug mcdermott and bring in wade and rondo when they were washed when we had prime jimmy butler to build around. oh and the only reason the butler trade even semi worked out for us is because the timberwolves were idiots and chose to move zach over wiggins - garpax wanted wiggins lmfao. they were one of the worst front offices in the league wasting away a mvp in rose and an all nba player in butler and if you are sitting here trying to defend them i can’t expect you to have an actual decent take on basketball"
"might be a hot take, but Doug McDermott is one of the best off-ball cutters in the NBA"
"Doug McDermott may not be at the top of any list, but he moves really well off the ball."
"Dejounte Murray, Devin Vassell, Doug McDermott, Keldon Johnson, Jakob Poeltl.   Derrick White, Josh Primo, Lonnie Walker, Thad Young, Zach Collins.  Tre Jones, Da'Quan Jeffries, Keita Bates-Diop, Luka Samanic, Jock Landale"

"I enjoy the trash talk. No reason not to be excited for your team. I’m not excited for it, but I don’t really like the pieces and how I think they fit. But it’s LeBron so it’ll all probably work out.   All our vets are gone. We signed Doug McDermott and Zach Collins and traded away DeMar for Thad Young, Al-Fourq Aminu, and picks. It seems like we’re moving towards a soft rebuild/tank based on the youth on our roster now. Pretty exciting for the franchise to accept that it’s time to move into the next iteration of Spurs basketball."
"not at all, the guys from these trades are expiring vets that could be dealt or bought out later  everyone else are young guys and Doug McDermott for shooting"
* Doug McDermott
"&gt; He's worth 10M a year at least imo  I don't know about *at least* but I think a lot of teams with a full MLE at their disposal should have been interested. BORD$ sees him worth about 7.5 this year, in the same range as Zach Collins, Bjelica, and Doug McDermott"
Not Doug McDermott? Do you want me to list every single idiotic thing Pop did or didn't?
"It depends on demar, but if he walks, The Spurs were all ready a 10 seed and had a losing record, I struggle to see how swapping demar/Rudy gay/Patty mills for Doug McDermott/Luka Samanic/and Tre Jones or josh primo doesn’t make this team quite a bit worse. And Derrick white, who just cannot stay healthy gets hurt again, this is probably a bottom 5 team"
"I still think McDermott is the superior player as he is slightly better from 3 and a truly elite cutter/finisher. Bullock does have him beat on D though, I just think Doug makes defenses work a lot harder"
That's what you get for signing Doug McDermott and Zach Collins.
Doug McDermott
"&gt;\[Charania\] Free agent Doug McDermott has agreed to a three-year, $42 million deal with the San Antonio Spurs, sources tell @TheAthletic @Stadium.  This is so dramatic. Clearly they are trying to win a championship. I'll miss him but its not like we let some amazing player walk"
"Calling Doug mcdermott a 3 point shooter is being ridiculously optimistic? Wtf? And Collins DOES have upside, he’s just injured all the time. Maybe he’ll start being healthy. Wtf else should the Spurs do my guy?"
lol duncan robinson is a smaller bertans. Doug Mcdermott scores at an elite level for his career in the paint AND from 3
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-free-agency-2021-doug-mcdermott-agrees-to-three-year-42-million-deal-with-spurs-per-report/amp/
Kelly Olynyk and Doug McDermott are making more per year than him
"Graham shoots a billion threes on pretty good percentage, is a great passer, and plays okay defense. The fit is great.  Also they're paying him less than Doug McDermott and Kelly Olynyk so idk what the fuck the contract complaints are about"
Bulls traded taj Gibson and Doug McDermott for him the day before he was planned to be outright released from the thunder. I think it was the dumbest move garpax ever made despite the fact that he ended up turning a corner years later
"People see his shitty offense, assume he's a good defender, and figure that he's just a bleh role player who gets too much attention. His defense is genuinely elite. He's easily worth more than two thirds of a Doug McDermott or half a Fournier, which is what he's getting paid."
He's making Doug McDermott money . . . it's not that much
Doug McDermott is not an average defensive player.   How could someone so good offensively only play 24 mins a game if he was average on D? He’s also never eclipsed 24 minutes a game in his 7 year career.
"I can't say I've watched Robinson outside of the bubble run but when McDermott was on the Knicks, one thing I noticed was how hard he cuts from off ball screens. A lot of KP's open looks on the perimeter were due to Doug quickly accelerating to the basket for a backdoor and I really wished the Knicks would have kept him and gave him starter minutes."
"Doug mcdermott just got 42 million from the spurs… Actually can’t believe he came back, bucks owe him big time"
What a steal i legitimately believe he is a better player then Doug McDermott
Bruh Doug McDermott and TJ McConell are out here making that double APY  This was clearly a discount cuz he loved it there.
"Doug McDermott is also the name of a serial fraudster in London, Ontario. He stole a ladder from my friend by pretending to clean the eavesdrops."
If you asked me where Doug McDermott played last year I honestly would've said Europe.
Do you really think Doug McDermott is going to stop us from tanking if we are bad?
Doug McDermott and TJ McConnell
Right but if he waited a bit he could've got a much larger bag from a small market team who missed on the bigger names. Doug McDermott just got 3/42 and that dude could not have been on the floor in crunch time playoff minutes like Cam was.
"I have no idea what this sub is on, the Spurs just got Lauri and Doug McDermott in very reasonable deals. Ya'll are wilding. Good moves."
What it doesnt have that Doug McDermott type splash?
i would take doug mcdermott signing with the spurs as an indication that doug mcdermott is likely going elsewhere
This seems really early in the day to be offering Doug McDermott $42 million.
Doug McDermott gets 3 yr/$40M from a team that misses out on Duncan Robinson.
"We don’t really need much depth if that were even the case. If we sign CP3, Payne and Craig we are missing only 2 positions worth of depth which both can be signed for cheap - i.e a Doug McDermott and McGee.   CP3 / Payne / Moore Book / Shamet / Moore Mikal / Cam Johnson / McDermott Crowder / Craig / Mcdermott / Smith Ayton / Mcgee / Smith  I’m going to guess our roster will look something close to this."
Like nobody let the young guys play. Sign some shooter to go with the guards like Doug McDermott for around the mid level.
"Green, Reddick, Tucker, are all free agents. Might be able to get a Doug McDermott with the mid level. They'll make it work, not like they can show up with a team of only 4 guys"
"Cade has this smoothness to his game that’s hard to come by, but he does remind a little of Wiggins where there’s nothing that jumps off the page at you.  Barnes might be one of those guys who ends up a solid 8th man that can play some D.  Kispert, I don’t know. Isn’t he Doug McDermott basically?   Honestly, I agree with all of these takes"
You could have had Myles Turner and Doug McDermott though
Grab Doug McDermott (or a simular SF) in FA and it'll be a great offseason.
"Lakers should try to get Rose, Tucker and Milsap to come over for vet min deals to win a ring and offer Reggie Bullock or Doug McDermott the MLE. Then try to S&amp;T Schroeder for Lauri Markkanen or Jarrett Allen."
"My favorite is EVERY white dude that is a scorer is compared to Larry Bird. Doug McDermott had a Paul Pierce game, he wasn’t using his athleticism he was using pump fakes and grounded moves to score. He could shoot but he wasn’t a Bird style light you up from anywhere shooter. But since he was white he got compared to Bird."
"I don't see why people are saying it's a bad fit. It's not that different from the big 3 on the heat. Westbrook can easily play the cut game like wade did and run the breaks. Davis is a better version of bosh and Lebron is Lebron but older. Just gotta surround them with some good shooting. I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't get Mr podcast, JJ Reddick. Maybe even a Doug McDermott type."
"Bron would cut down on the resting I'd imagine, idk.   It's Russel Westbrook. You really bummed and prefer it be Doug McDermott instead?"
Can’t wait for Kispert to be the next Doug McDermott/ Adam Morrison / Jimmer Fredette / etc
"Good shooting vets are available:Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, Wayne Ellington, Jeff Green, Doug McDermott, Patty Mills, etc. I’m not sure it would be hard to convince them to come to LA and play with 3 All-NBA players. Especially when 2 of them have averaged 10+ assists"
Maybe Mike Muscala or Doug McDermott. Idk
"I once encountered a Doug McDermott fan, anything is possible."
"Doug McDermott has carved out a really solid role in the league, Khyri Thomas just played himself into a guaranteed contract, and Ty-Shon Alexander shot 100% in the NBA Finals... just don't ask how many attempts. We won't get into Justin Patton either"
Doug McDermott
"As my hero, Johnny Lawrence, said, “the best defense is more offense”. We should just double down on the offense. Let’s get Enes Kanter, Brook Lopez, Lou Williams, Kevin Love, Tim Hardaway Jr., Doug McDermott... can we bring back Marshon Brooks? He was always good for a bucket.   Realistically though, I'm beginning to think it'll be tough for us to fix the defense when you have Harden/Kyrie playing 30+ minutes a game. They can't guard anyone and they're getting destroyed on switches. We could have Ben Wallace or KG anchoring the D and it'll be brutal. At best, we should try to find ways to limit offensive rebounding/TOs and ways that can reduce opponent shot attempts, because they'll hit anywhere north of 45%.  Basically, if we get to shoot 5-10% more than the opponent does, then we'll probably win more than lose. Play to our strengths, Harden, Durant are good rebounders and any future PF/C we get should just be great at rebounding more than defense. Board and make good decisions should be our mantra."
Doug McDermott
Yeah the trade doesn't look bad in terms of asset analysis I just think they could've got someone better bc Shamet was very highly valued at the time and the pick was considered valuable too. Like aaron gordon as a spot up and defensive guy who can handle a little. Or even just trading for shooter types like Doug McDermott or Joe Harris + another piece

Not the best, but woulda been fun"
Doug McDermott is making a serious case for himself as a starter in this league. Playing the best basketball of his career this year.
Doug McDermott
Doug McDermott has quietly improved over the past couple seasons. He works so incredibly well off of Sabonis.
I was a die hard bulls fan from when I started following basketball at five years old in 1998 to 2014 when they made the trade of Jusuf Nurkic and Gary Harris for Doug McDermott. It epitomized our stupid front office philosophy and I couldn't handle it any more. I stopped rooting until last year when they fired Forman and demoted Paxson.
"Kyle Korver went to Pella High School and was a high profile player in the state. His parents met playing for Central College in Pella and a lot of his extended family plays and coaches around the state. McDermott grew up mostly in Iowa and won state at Ames High with teammate Harrison Barnes, his dad was a coach at Northern Iowa and then Iowa State. Doug was committed to UNI before his dad went to Creighton."
"They’re also starting Doug McDermott, Edmond Sumner and Justin Holiday. It’s nowhere near a typical starting lineup"
"Why are we comparing Doug McDermott to Kerr and Korver under ND. According to wikipedia, neither Kerr (Beirut, Lebanon) or Korver (California) were born there?"
"Doug McDermott was on that high school team too, which is pretty crazy"
Doug McDermott was really born in a place that doesn’t exist
"Interesting bit of coincidence...  I went to the same HS as South Dakota's Mike Miller, albeit a couple decades prior.  His dad was my Jr. high vice principal.  I live in Ames, IA now and remember when Harrison Barnes (Iowa) and Doug McDermott (North Dakota) were in the same class together at Ames High.  That freaking team was stacked between those two and I think two or three others from that era who went on to play D1."
Its all about how it gets measured tbh and how you filter it also to gauge it.   [This is the data base dating back to 2014](https://apanalytics.shinyapps.io/knarsu3/). If you filter it by % of time guarding all stars like is one option here youll see bigger splits than by using average usage rate. Side note hilariously Doug McDermott has the 4 seasons with the lowest % of possessions guarding all stars out of anybody in the entire database. But if you do it like this you tend to get ranges more in line with what I might have expected it's just about how you go about it methodology wise. Multiple ways to do it.   Also the methodology for the matchup data changed for 2019-20 and is more conducive now to measuring guys as spending more time guarding each position. I personally think the new matchup data is even more flawed for a couple reasons I preferred the old one for all its limitations but for the purposes of this discussion it is more accurate the new one.
"funny thing is if you look back that roster doesnt look nearly as bad as they actually played that year. lot of guys who ended up getting way better after they left that team. granted some of them were young/raw players like sabonis, but there were some pretty solid players on that team like oladipo, sabonis, jerami grant, adams, doug mcdermott. i've seen worse rosters make the playoffs"
Brogdon can play the 2!  PG: Dame / Aaron Holiday / TJ McConnell  SG: Malcolm Brogdon / Gary Trent Jr. / Nassir Little   SF: DJJ / Justin Holiday / Rodney Hood  PF: RoCo / Doug McDermott / Melo  C: Sabonis / Kanter / Giles   We couldn't anchor the paint to save our lives but hey we can surround Sabonis with shooters.
Doug mcdermott
"That’s just completely not true on all fronts. Luke is a really, really, really good playmaker. His passing and playmaking has been better than I expected. Actually if you ask any Clipper fan what their problem with Luke is, they’ll all tell you that he is passing and playmaking TOO much. Comparing him to Doug McDermott (who is an incredible shooter and very underrated) is asinine  (Also there’s $2-4 million tied up in incentives in his contract that are dependent on his health and his defense)"
The issue was never his shooting he's been shooting the rock fine all year.   The issue is shooting is pretty much the *only* thing he can do. Clippers fans were hoping he'd come in and be a good playmaker off the bench as well as creating his own shot every now and then and he hasn't really lived up to that. Not to mention he's a turnstile on defense.   If you're paying 15+ million a year for a pure shooter it's a bit of an overpay. Seth Curry is making half that and I'd say is a better shooter/player than Kennard as well. Doug McDermott is another example of a pure shooter and he's only making $7 million a year.
Ah yes the Doug McDermott drops 40 pts game
"We're starting Edmund Sumner, Justin Holiday, and Doug McDermott. You'll be fine"
Doug McDermott.
I wouldn’t trade Doug McDermott for him straight up right now. The dude is a complete assclown. Has to be the most unreliable player in the league
I hope its better than Doug McDermott being trained by Jimmy Butler.
"A stellar performance from Malcolm Brogdon, who is playing like an All Star these last few games. Vic didn't have a great shooting night but he was still aggressive and made the effort on offense. Myles Turner continued his epic defensive run to start the season with 8 blocks, including a clutch collab block with Sabonis in the last minute of the game which helped us seal the win.   The Pacers were able to weather the storm each time the Rockets were able to close the gap after the Pacers had built a lead. John Wall was unstoppable, and he got to the rim with ease all night and was getting basically any layup he wanted. This surely would have been a different game if not for Harden's frankly terrible (by Harden standards) performance. There was no aggression from him and he took very few of those stepback threes you expect to see him take, although he did finish with 12 assists. We had 3 or 4 guys defending him all night, so those different defensive looks may have confused him or disrupted his scoring game, but I think he just didn't have it going for whatever reason last night. The Rockets bench also played very poorly.   The Pacers' biggest issue right now is rebounding. They are not a good rebounding team, and they especially give up way too many offensive boards. That is not sustainable for the season and isn't a playoff-winning formula, so they will have to get that sorted out. The Pacers rebounded better against the Rockets, but they played a team which is also a bad rebounding team, and the Rockets also used a small-ball lineup all night which may have had something to do with the Pacers' better rebounding performance.   All in all, things are going really well for the Pacers at the moment. They're winning games, and they're doing it while still missing some key players in TJ Warren and Jeremy Lamb. Doug McDermott, who has been really productive at times for us, also went out injured on Wednesday. Despite our injuries, our starters are lighting it up with great performances, bolstered by role players stepping up on any given night, like Justin Holiday, who finished with 20 points last night."
van gundy was afraid doug mcdermott would cook him in OT
We had Justin Holiday (6'6) at C and Doug McDermott (6'7) at PF the other day for a bit
Woah woah woah press the brakes. He’s more like doug mcdermott
Prince + a few mins work to meet the necessary salary range. People forget we’re paying Prince 12m/year. You only need to hit like 15m to match.  Sixers could do the same with Danny Green who makes 15.5m. Danny Green + Mike Scott = 20m.  Pacers could do Jeremy Lamb + Doug McDermott as filler.  Suns could do Dario Saric + Jae Crowder or one of them + Jalen Smith + a few mins
I was thoroughly convinced that Doug McDermott was actually the next Bird
"Oh ya.   Otto Porter, who I guess is always injured.   Doug McDermott will surely get offered more than the 6m we can offer and he’s trash on defense, so again you’re wing defenders are Bron, AD and Doug.   Why would Jeff Green leave the Nets?   And I’d take Melo, but as a 10th man who plays 15 min a game. Not a Kuz replacement."
