One more point and he could have had 44 in honor of Henry Aaron
"Dad saw Henry hit 715 at Fulton co stadium. Although Barry did hit more, I still can‚Äôt fault people who want to see Henry Aaron that way."
"Tom Brady: lebron Patrick mahomes: trae young Lamar Jackson: Giannis  Aaron Donald: this could be lebron too, but there is no direct comparison Deshuan Watson: James harden, both really good, and both forced their way out of Houston  Aaron Rodgers: Kevin Durant, great but not better than the king Devante adams:idk Raheem mostart: deaaron fox Derrick Henry: Giannis/embiid Drew brees: Carmelo Anthony  Barry sanders:also Carmelo ig Jamarcus Russell: Anthony Bennett"
Aaron Henry. I'm not biased.
Aaron Henry/Jt Thor/Herb Jones/ Joe Wisekamp/ Trey Murphy/ Mathew Hurt/ Quentin Grimes
"It seems like everyone wants to play a game of ""Yeah, Jokic is the MVP, but if he didn't exist, who would it be"", and I think they're doing it because having that conversation is how you pay respect to someone who's played great but won't win an award, and so history might forget what they did.  And I think that's what Dame is saying, too.  He thinks there should be a conversation about who is allowed to be in the conversation about who gets to be second or third most valuable player.    We do this in hockey almost every year.  Was he the best player in the league or the player that mattered most to his team?  And eventually they just decided to make two awards rather than settle the question, and a lot of years two different guys win those awards.  Football does this, too, and it's even more absurd.  Last year Derrick Henry was the Offensive Player of the Year, but the MVP was Aaron Rogers, who also only plays offense, and Henry wasn't in the top three MVP voting.    All that to say, everything about these awards is kind of dumb, poorly defined, and set up to create these conversations."
Wagner couldn't even guard Aaron Henry.

76ers got Aaron Henry who I thought was a early 2nd round talent. Nix is a great player too. Wizards got Kyree Walker though and he's winning an MVP or two in his career so...
Idk if we did the best but I think the sixers should get a mention they landed Nix and Aaron Henry
"SIXERS imo based on Aaron Henry alone. Aaron Henry is an absolute steal, I can really see him becoming a solid rotational piece in the NBA for years to come, amazing defense, still needs to work on his shot but other than that a great pickup."
I'm really shocked that Aaron Henry went undrafted
Aaron henry and daishen nix not getting picked was surprising to me oh and also ayayi
"Aaron Henry is also my pick right now for steal at the moment. He's really solid, he just really didn't have any help on MSU this last season so his numbers don't look amazing."
Aaron Henry from MSU is a solid all-around player. I only really watch B1G though so outside of him idk haha.
Someone's getting a steal in Aaron Henry.  Dude is a legit lockdown defender.  He made Wagner his bitch.
Still no Aaron Henry üòê
"I‚Äôm really surprised Aaron Henry hasn‚Äôt gotten picked yet, unless I missed something"
Pistons should take Aaron Henry.  Great defender.
1.	Aaron Henry 2.	Cade 3.	Green 4.	Suggs 5.	Bouknight 6.	Garuba 7.	Grimes 8.	Moody 9.	Keon  10. Mobley with his one functioning leg because all 7‚Äô players that go high seem to get injured lately
"Quentin Grimes, Ayo Dosunmu, Herbert Jones, Aaron Henry, to name a few."
"I like Bones Hyland, Josh Primo, Tre Mann, JT Thor and Aaron Henry"
"Joshua Primo, Jaden Springer, Jason Preston, Aaron Henry"
Undrafted rookie Aaron Henry logged 2 garbage time minutes for the Sixers
"Henry *""broke the most famous white athlete's record in what was then by far the most popular sport in America while receiving constant death threats and playing in the ultra-racist south""* Aaron would like a word with you."
Getting absolutely lit up by Aaron Henry and Jaden Springer while yelling how they can't win without him
"See: Ben Simmons, Kyrie Irving, Aaron Rodgers, Deshaun Watson, Jon Gruden, Henry Ruggs, Damon Arnette  Pole Assassin's monkey story is up in the air"
Bassey and Aaron Henry have been on the bench last few games
r/cfb : haha we have monkeygate   r/nfl : yeah well we have Henry Ruggs and Aaron Rodgers   r/nba : and owners suck
"Still can't believe an MVP candidate going down for the year doesn't even crack the top 3 craziest stories for the NFL. The Henry Ruggs situation, Aaron Rodgers not being vaccinated, Mike White taking over the league, the Odell Beckham Jr and Sr fiasco, and Aaron Rodgers heel turning so hard Packers' fans all become the Joker. What a week"
I stand by Aaron Rodgers. F all his haters. People more worried about Rodgers vaccination status than Henry Ruggs killing a young woman.
"Oh boy, just to make a summary:  - Michael Thomas (Saints receiver) got shut down for the season for injury issues  - Odell Beckham got shut down for the season for non injury issues (and in all likelihood will never play for the Browns again)  - Aaron Rodgers lied about being vaccinated, caught COVID and is missing the next 2 weeks  - Raiders 1st Round pick from last year Henry Ruggs committed a DUI + Murderer  All this just on Wednesday"
"At approximately 156mph. I can't decide who's worse: Henry Ruggs for killing someone while driving drunk, or Aaron Rodgers for LYING about being vaccinated. It's a real tossup."
