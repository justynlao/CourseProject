"Wait, is Rodney Hood one of your healthy players?  That's unexpected."
Conveniently leaves out Kevin Love as well as spark plugs like Jordan Clarkson Rodney Hood and veteran shooters like Kyle Korver and George Hill.  the toughest teams he faced where the pacers who somehow took them to 7 (lol) and Celtics led by rookie jayson tatum. I think KD would do just fine lol
"Ok first off, the portland trailblazers and Damian Lillard have a much better roster than the warriors right now. That's not a debate, the warriors have no depth.. Outside of their average starting five, they have one of the worst teams in the NBA.   So if we look at the team success so far, Steph Curry's warriors, who are a worse team than Lillard's blazers, are essentially tied in record (10-9,11-9). Don't underestimate that blazers team though. CJ McCollum is an all-star level player, he just hasn't had the appearances because the team he's on isn't usually high enough in the standings to warrant a #2 guy like McCollum to make it. Why are the blazers not usually higher in the standings then? It's not the coaching, Terry Stotts has built a great system. It's not the surrounding cast, the blazers have guys like Nurkic, Kanter, Trent Jr, Derrick Jones Jr, Rodney Hood, and others in the past, etc... It's because Lillard is not good enough to push them to the next level. It's not always as easy as just putting up the numbers. It's the same reason why Harden, who puts up crazy numbers, hasn't had much team success. Both are not as efficient and don't affect the game in different enough ways to make up for that, unlike a guy like Lebron who does everything, or KD &amp; Curry who are extremely efficient."
"Stotts didn't sign Mario Herzonia, Kent Bazemore, and Anthony Tolliver to man the forward positions last year  Stotts didn't refuse to sign a backup PG leading to Rodney Hood being the second best ball handler and distributer with CJ out  Stotts didn't get Nurk and CJ and Derrik Jones Jr hurt this year  Stotts can't help that Roco has lost his shot so far despite getting his shots classified as open over 80% of the time   Stotts didn't get Rodney Hood an Achilles injury last year  Neil should get way more heat than he does"
"Missed a great Rodney hood joke for flippin, Robin Lopez!?!¿."
Also Rodney Hood not being able to get his so he walks up front unsure if he should do it still lol
Aww poor Rodney Hood didn’t get to wet Dame  : (  Now he’s unsure what to do with the water bottles lol meIRL
"Rodney Hood won’t let you anymore, the dick."

"Kevin Harlan is struggling a lot more than normal tonight, to the point people are confusing him with Marv. I mean fuck, he called Rodney Hood Rodney Hoo"
Remembered he looked like Speedy Gonzales out there with Rodney Hood refusing to play.
"Stotts has had several good defences in his reign in Portland. Our biggest issue this season is that we were having to compensate for Nurk not being 100% and for Enes Kanter being Enes Kanter  Our bench is the worst defensive unit in the NBA. There isn’t much you can do to compensate for Kanter, Melo, an injured Rodney Hood and Anfernee Simons being terrible defenders"
"Sure they do. Some come into rebuilding teams that are “theirs” and have 35 minutes per game and a green light from day 1.  Donovan cam in behind Rodney Hood in the rotation, and had to beat him out for the starter position."
"And that’s the thing. The Cavs whole team was built on playing with Lebron. Of course they wouldn’t be good without him.  JR was huge in the 2016 finals and except the first 2 games, was good in the 2017 finals. George Hill was decent with Utah the previous year despite playing was an injury. Love was part of the Big 3 when Kyrie was on the team. Rodney Hood was huge for Portland and had some good games for us.  To call them scrubs is insulting."
"No, the 2018 still had guys like George Hill, Rodney Hood and a bunch of vet guys + a much more uinjured Kevin Love, it’s close though. It’s amazing what you can do when you ain’t paying max money to Tristan Thompson."
"George Hill, JR Smith, Kyle Korver, Rodney Hood, Jordan Clarkson, Jose Calderon were the guards for the 2018 Cavs in the playoffs."
"Monta Ellis was waaaaay better than Rodney Hood, but a very enjoyable read :)"
"&gt; at the same time when you're setting up 3s theyre more valuable.  Not when Robert Covington, Derrick Jones, and Rodney Hood are shooting them"
"Derrick Jones Jr. is shooting 44% overall and 25.7% from 3.  And the 3s he's taking are WIDE OPEN.  As uneven as RoCo has been, DJJ has been significantly worse.  Same for Rodney Hood as he works his way back into form coming off the achilles injury."
Why you bring up Rodney hood lol? I’ll take KD on his death bed over that bum
"I agree we shouldn’t use Kd as the rule now, but really you gonna compare KD with Rodney Hood?   Even without injury player of Hood’s caliber could be out of the league or sitting at the end of the bench lol playing mop up minutes.   I know he had somewhat of a resurgence with Portland but remember how bad he was when playing on a contending team (Cavs)?"
"i do think it’s a big deal that he got a year and a half off, also look at him, now look at rodney hood averaging like 2ppg..   so yeah let’s not make him the rule now he still appears to be an exception"
Lol kyle anderson and hb aren’t bad and rodney hood is solid when healthy. More like disappointing players
Garrett Temple  Rodney Hood  Kyle Anderson  Semi Ojeleye  Harrison Barnes
"it's really tough, you just have to hope the Blazers can hang tough while CJ &amp; Nurk are out.  It's a great opportunity for Gary Trent Jr. to step up, and I like his pairing with Dame in the starting line-up.  Hopefully Rodney Hood can keep his comeback going too and take on a larger role to chip in.     My thinking is that more than changing the coach after the year, the organization needs to take a really long look at Neil Olshey.  He's been pretty high variance and unfortunately it's been more down than up lately.  The Simons &amp; Collins picks in particular are looking really poor right now, Simons just flat out isn't very good and Collins has had problems staying on the floor and got taken over some really, really good NBA players that year (Mitchell, Bam, John Collins, OG).  In both cases the Blazers went for project/upside prospects when they already had a franchise superstar and a couple star players in CJ &amp; Nurk, perhaps going for more ""sure thing"" players or making different moves at the time to maximize the core they had would've been better.  Hindsight is 20/20 of course, but there were signs in the moment that the process was questionable (Simons in particular was a strange, strange pick).   I actually like Stotts and I think he's done pretty well with the roster he has.  Are there better NBA coaches? Sure, but the players still play hard for him and he's not doing things that are tanking the on-court results.  It's hard to coach competent defense with a rotation that includes Melo, Kanter, Dame &amp; CJ (both of them try on defense but size limits their impact).  Even the players the Blazers have that are ""good"" defenders have limitations and/or aren't elite performers.  DJJ is active on defense but still pretty untested.  RoCo is solid but not an All-NBA level stopper.  Gary Trent Jr. tries hard but is small.  Nurk is great on the glass &amp; takes up space near the rim but he's not the kind of big that switches onto the perimeter &amp; is match-up dependent.   Creating a contender in a small market is incredibly tough, even when you strike oil on a franchise player that wants to be there you have to nail every single peripheral move to get over the top.  At least Dame plays in a city that loves &amp; respects him and turns out for him every night, he certainly shows up for us and it's pretty awesome to watch."
Brogdon can play the 2!  PG: Dame / Aaron Holiday / TJ McConnell  SG: Malcolm Brogdon / Gary Trent Jr. / Nassir Little   SF: DJJ / Justin Holiday / Rodney Hood  PF: RoCo / Doug McDermott / Melo  C: Sabonis / Kanter / Giles   We couldn't anchor the paint to save our lives but hey we can surround Sabonis with shooters.
Shitposting aside I still think they have enough depth to survive for the time being.  PG: Dame / Anfernee Simons   SG: Gary Trent Jr. / Nassir Little  SF: DJJ / Rodney Hood  PF: RoCo / Melo  C: Kanter / Giles  I'm kind of high on the bench but that's still a serviceable 10-man rotation. The idea of Kanter holding down the defense is frightening but he did it during the playoffs when Portland made the WCF a few years ago.  I'm excited for Giles to get some consistent minutes. Nassir Little is the weakest link in the rotation but hopefully he can step up with some consistent minutes. Gary Trent Jr. is ready to take the leap imo.
"The Blazers got murdered by injuries this year and its happening again this year. But honestly, I still think they have the depth to go further than they did last season.  PG: Dame / Anfernee Simons  SG: Gary Trent Jr. / Nassir Little   SF: DJJ / Rodney Hood  PF: RoCo / Melo  C: Kanter / Giles  I'm admittedly higher on the bench than a lot of people but I think there's decent depth through the roster and that's even with CJ, Nurk and Collins out. I'm happy to see Giles getting consistent minutes. Nassir Little is the weakest guy in the rotation but maybe he just needs the opportunity to step up."
"was hoping the blazers would make this a close finish...looked like maybe for a second there  edit: but still, rodney hood"
Fun fact: Rodney Hood scored as many points in two and a half quarters today as he has all season
Rodney Hood.  I know he's been throwing bricks up.  But we all know how he plays when he's himself.  A guy excellent at mid-range shots.
Rodney Hood looks like trash compared to who he was before and it’s been 13+ months since his Achilles surgery.  I think KD and Wilkins are the outliers for Achilles recovery.
"dude I totally feel that, my favorite dudes in the league are jakarr sampson, bobby portis, and taurean prince. I think rooting for the guy who no one expects to be great is a lot of fun. moments like rodney hood coming in for portland in 4ot to save the game vs the nuggets are the moments I live to watch as a fan"
"A- Lebron delivered a championship to every city he’s played in. That matters. He left in free agency not by demanding a trade that matters. He left if he was unhappy with the roster moves a team made.  B- The trade you are referring sent out Dwayne wade, Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas Iman shumpert Derrick rose and Jae crowder. They received Jordan Clarkson, Larry nance jr, George Hill, Rodney Hood and the draft rights for an overseas player. This trade made them both younger and healthier.  C- the trade was for 3 picks and two swaps. If it continues to work out and the lakers are better than New Orleans, those swap can be nothing Every trade you referenced is factually incorrect.  And to reiterate, it does matter if it worked out. Ask the fan bases involved. It probably feels a lot better to have made whatever trade(and lebron trades were focused and on what actually makes the team better not who he didn’t like in the locker room.) and won a chip than make several trades and have harden kick you in the nuts with his trade demands out the door."
Rodney Hood in 2019 and Jordan Clarkson last year cooked us
Rodney Hood might be worst off-season move of the year in the NBA
"BPA&gt;Fit has backfired too.   ATL drafted ""BPA"" Marvin Williams when they already had Joe Johnson, Josh Smith, Al Harrington, and Josh Childress as wings. In doing so, they passed up ""better fit"" prospects like Chris Paul and Deron Williams, even though they badly needed a PG.   Then the next year they drafted another ""BPA"" forward, Shelden Williams, instead of ""better fit"" Brandon Roy. By the time they realized their mistake, they had to trade Shelden Williams for a washed, overpaid Mike Bibby.   Or how about MIN drafting 2 ""BPA"" PGs in a row (Rubio, Johnny Flynn)? Or the Clippers drafting 2 PFs in a row (Chris Wilcox, Melvin Ely), when they already had Elton Brand and Chris Kaman?   DET drafted BPA Darko when they already had Ben Wallace at C, instead of better fit Chris Bosh to replace Elden Campbell (though they eventually traded for Sheed to fill the PF spot).   PHI went BPA Fultz when they already had Simmons at PG, instead of better fit Tatum to replace Robert Covington/Dario Saric.   MIL chose BPA Jabari Parker when they already had Giannis at PF, instead of better fit Embiid to replace Zaza Pachulia.   NY picked Jordan Hill when they already had David Lee at PF, instead of better fit Demar Derozan to replace Jared Jeffries.   UTA picked BPA Trey Lyles when they already had Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors at forward, instead of better fit Devin Booker to replace Rodney Hood.   ORL drafted BPA Mo Bamba when they already had Vucevic at C, instead of better fit Collin Sexton to replace DJ Augustin.  You can find examples to support either approach. There's no single correct way."
Desmond be looking like Rodney Hood
"Utah's pretty good anytime they're picking outside the top 10. Stockton, Malone, Mark Eaton, Gobert, Mitchell, Millsap, Rodney Hood, Alec Burks, CJ Miles, Mo Williams and the GOAT Andrei Kirilenko are all late first or second rounders.  But inside the top 10 they have a hard time. Dominique Wilkins was the third pick but didn't want to be in Utah. Thurl Bailey was good at seven. Deron Williams was really good but they could have had CP3. Hayward was a good pick at 9 but they could have had PG13. Kanter was picked ahead of like 3 or 4 potential HOF players, and Exum was a gamble that made some sense but in retrospect was a waste of an opportunity when Marcus Smart and Julius Randle were the next two picks, and Jordan Clarkson - who the Jazz traded Exum for last season - was picked in the second round."
"Yeah but we also went to the WCF finals with no Nurk though and most people would consider Robert Covington and Derick Jones Jr. better players than Al-Farouq Aminu and Mo Harkless (ask Heat fants) who they are replacing the roles of from that team, Gary Trent has also made a big jump this year, Melo is shooting 40% plus from 3, Rodney Hood is still working his way back into form but will be there by the postseason, CJ is playing the best basketball of his career (and its mostly by adding 5 or so 3 point attempts a game so its sustainable).  Last year Nurk was out until the bubble and then still with barely any conditioning coming back and the team had no Kanter or Hood or Covington or DJJ and it was pretty much Melo or Mario Herzonja on the wing.   There is a reason people view them as a bigger threat this year. Upgrading your best players from 4-8 and getting your 3rd best player back (eventually with Nurk, he's also not in his normal game shape yet)  Right now the team is still waiting on Nurk to get back to his usual self and still winning at a decent clip which will only keep going up as they play together more and as Hood gets back into form"
"Rodney Hood, Jusuf Nurkic, Derrick Jones Jr, Zach Collins, all the draft picks for Harden.  Dame/CJ/Harden + RoCo and Kanter/Giles starting and backing up the 5."
I can guarantee you that Rodney Hood will not be losing minutes to “Damian Lillard’s cousin”
"They got gary trent, DJJ (BEAST BOI),Covington, melo, rodney hood. Thats 5 ppl on the wings to complement dame and cj with nurk and kanter at the 5 spot thats a good team on paper but stotts been shit since his wcf appearance."
"Does this sound like a lottery team to you?  Rudy Gobert, Joe Ingles, Ricky Rubio, Jae Crowder, Dante Exum, Derrick Favors, Rodney Hood, Joe Johnson.  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/UTA/2018.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/UTA/2018.html)"

When they are eligible to be dealt Rodney hood and Derrick Jones Jr would get you fairly close salary matching wise probably just need one more minor salary to match depth would survive I think. Now whether GSW would have even the faintest interest in that package even if you attach a 2023 and 2025 first.....that’s a separate story
"The fact that you've watched this team the last few years doesn't matter. They literally picked up 2 defensive beasts in Covington and Jones Jr. Dame and CJ are bad but not awful defensively. Nurkic is supposed to be a positive defender and Rodney hood, Gary Trent jr and Harry Giles are all good defenders too.  Melo, dame, kanter and CJ are defensive liabilities but their other rotational players are good enough to make this an average or slightly below average defensive team. There's literally no excuse for them to be 29th in the league on defense."
"Rodney Hood, George Hill, and Dwyane Wade were not young players though..."
That's how I felt watching Rodney Hood balling out against my nuggets in 2019. I remember thinking he was a bonafide scrub to the highest degree (no disrespect to the brother) when he was LeBrons teammate on cavs.   I guess the LeBron limelight is just a tad DIFFERENT ain't it? #LIVELAUGHLOVE
"Statistically, Kobe Bryant is an inefficient volume shooter. A career 44.7% FG, 32.9% 3FG, and only 83% from the free throw line. Would you say he's a bad shooter? No, he's not a bad shooter.      Statistically, Thiago Splitter had a better on/off rating in 2011-2012 than Lebron James did in 2017-2018. When on the court, the Spurs were 10 points better(+10) per 100 possessions with Splitter on the court. When off the court, the Spurs were only 3 points better(+3.3) per 100 possessions. You can't say Splitter carried the Spurs harder than Lebron carried the Cavs.     My point being that +/-, and Net Rating, is good at showing team-based performance. But more specifically, it's not good at showing individuals performance. This is because the rating is heavily dependent on lineup, or in other words, who you're playing with. Lebron's team in 2017-2018 was the biggest shitshow of a team to make it to the finals. I'd say bigger of a shitshow than Lebron's 1st Cavs team. At least they had a purpose. Half the 2018 Cavs team, including DWade and DRose, was traded at the deadline for largely crap in return, not much of whom stayed on the roster the year after. George Hill, Rodney Hood, Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, none of these guys are all that good. They're DECENT, mind you, but none of these guys can really step it up and ""carry"" a team."
"Cavs didn’t have Kyrie when they went to the finals in 2018 lol. They did lose beasts like Rodney “anxious” Hood, and Jordan Clarkson"
Yeah I should get flaired huh? How do you flair anyway?  Did you not see the team he had in 2018. Fucking Rodney Hood was their third best player for a good amount of that run. Don’t be ridiculous. They get swept every time. End of story. Mental toughness won’t help anybody against the Dubs with that Cavs roster.   You gotta be an absolute idiot at this point to call Lebron James not clutch.
Rodney Hood also coming back from an Achilles this year. Looking pretty solid as well
"Low key best defender in the league. Can guard 1 to 5 lol. 6'8"" Rodney Hood couldn't even move the guy on the post."
"I mean there's not much positive to say about most rookies early in their rookie seasons. bbref has him as the 2nd worst player in the NBA this season after Rodney Hood, so he's been about as bad as you can be. But the Wolves are bad enough that they need to just keep putting the ball in his hands regardless so he can get some experience"
Tell that to Rodney hood  :(
Lebron blocked Curry’s attempt in the finals. Now this. Look for Rodney Hood to block someone’s dunk next
no fucking way steph can’t score on Rodney Hood
Did I see rodney hood off tearing an acl lock up Curry
"I remember watching that team early in the year play Duke who had Jabari Parker, Rodney Hood and Quinn Cook and although it wasn’t a blowout, if you watched the game you could tell how far apart those two were and Duke was considered a title contending team that year but it wasn’t even close"
It's not Rodney Hood
"No mention of the Blazers who have been playing without their 2nd and 3rd best players for most of the season? Plus another potential starter (Zach Collins) out for the season?  Blazers depth is the only reason they remain in the playoff hunt despite being the most injured team in the entire league. They will have a full 10 man rotation available again after the All Star break:  PG: Lillard, Anfernee Simons SG: CJ, Trent Jr. SF: Derrick Jones, Rodney Hood PF: Covington, Melo C: Nurkic, Kanter  And that's not including fast improving Nassir Little and out for the season Zach Collins. Little may be good enough to fight for the starting SF spot next season."
"Kobe and Dirk both stayed with their team.  If Lebron is  the same tier as them, yeah he'd likely have a ring with Cleveland, probably multiple.   I wanted to believe that Rodney Hood was that ""Scotty Pippen"" type of player, especially before Hood got injured."
I thought Okafor was actually as good as Embiid but didn’t get playing time  I thought Rodney Hood would become an all star
"His role with us was streaky scorer who often made horrible gaffes on both ends of the floor. I think this was partially due to our less than stellar backcourt combinations we had him with (George Hill, Rodney Hood, DRose, JR/Shumpert just to name a few) but he's proven this season to be incredibly consistent and a frontrunner for 6MOTY.  Certainly helps with guys like Conley and Mitchell and also a great coach like Quin."
"So Cleveland traded Jae Crowder, Derrick Rose, and 2 seconds for George Hill and Rodney Hood? In retrospect I wouldn’t do that"
"2018 Cavs  &gt; Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give LeBron James and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard J.R. Smith yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”  &gt; “At the end of the day, I like being around guys that want to win and work hard,” James said. “I know I demand a lot of excellence in my teammates. I demand it out of myself, too. On the road, we are going to play as well as we can and put ourselves in contention to compete for another championship. And that’s my mindset.”  After making these 3 trades on Feb 8, 2018:  * Traded Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat for a 2024 2nd round draft pick. (Pick is heavily protected and not expected to convey.)  * Traded Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas and a 2018 1st round draft pick (Moritz Wagner was later selected) to the Los Angeles Lakers for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr..  * As part of a 3-team trade, the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Jae Crowder, Derrick Rose and a 2024 2nd round draft pick to the Utah Jazz; the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Dimitrios Agravanis, Iman Shumpert, $2.1M cash and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Sacramento Kings; the Sacramento Kings traded Artūras Gudaitis and George Hill to the Cleveland Cavaliers; the Utah Jazz traded Rodney Hood to the Cleveland Cavaliers; and the Utah Jazz traded Joe Johnson and $1.1M cash to the Sacramento Kings. (UTA receives right to exchange 2024 second-round pick with CLE.) (SAC receives MIA 2020 second-round pick from CLE.)"
"I'll agree, based on the betting lines that someone else posted, that Toronto was the favourite. But I'll also refer back to two points I made in a [comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/8fzwrk/day_before_game_1_and_free_talk_raptors_vs/dy7swyp/) just before that series started about why I didn't believe in the narrative that ""the Pacers outplayed the Cavs so we shouldn't have any problems""  First, the Cavs shot really poorly in the Indiana series:  &gt; A lot of Cleveland role players shot the ball unusually poorly. It's exceptionally unlikely that JR Smith, Jose Calderon, George Hill, Rodney Hood, and Jordan Clarkson will combine to shoot 26% from deep over a full series again. As a team they only made 34% of their threes with defenders 4+ feet away compared to 39% during the regular season.  I figured they would regress... and wouldn't ya know it, they shot 46% on those same threes against the Raptors.  Second, the Pacers had the best transition offense in the league that year while the Cavs had the 4th-worst transition defense and it *really* showed in that series — both in the stats and watching the games. Meanwhile, the Raptors had a good-but-not-great transition offense in the regular season and when they met the Cavs in the playoffs they didn't exploit the Cavs weak transition defense nearly as much as the Pacers did.  So I guess I'd say that yes, the Raptors were favourites by public perception, but maybe they shouldn't have been."
"He does not care. Felt like I learned this the game Rodney Hood had 8 3s in the first half. Thought he'd gun for the record all time, but I don't think Quin let him."
"Lawl, the corpse of Rodney Hood for Dort. Ah but yeah, throw in some picks."
Rodney Hood at center? Idk about that
"Rodney Hood for PJ Tucker CJ McCollum for Blake Griffin Sign likely soon to be released Demarcus Cousins And if so, cut Zach Collins Throw around picks here and there."
"The Blazers roster around Dame for most of this season has been Robert Covington, Gary Trent, Enes Kanter, Carmelo Anthony, Derrick Jones, Anfernee Simons, Rodney Hood, and Harry Giles..."
"What a nonsense post, lol. Hey everyone look the players this guys thinks are ""thriving recently"":  George Hill  Rodney Hood  Jeff fucking Green  c'mon now. If anything the opposite of your post title is the truth, FOH."
The COVID excuses don't hold any water when compared to Portland. McCollum and Nurk and Zach Collins and Nassir Little and Rodney Hood. Portland has been the most injured team in the league.
"Gobert got 51 wins with Gordon Hayward, George Hill, and Rodney Hood as his sidekicks. Then he got 48 wins with Rubio, Mitchell, and Favors. Then 50 with Rubio, Mitchell, and Favors again. Then 44 wins (out of 72) with Conley, Mitchell, and Bogdanovic. How many players does he have to carry before we acknowledge Gobert is the star?"
And Rodney Hood! Missed last few games and I think is still on minutes restriction.
Kind of an asterisk since he's coming off an achilles injury but Rodney Hood has probably been the worst player in the league this year getting more than 18 MPG. 9/2/3 per 36 minutes on a 36 TS% in 23 games.
Hurt or just suck so far? Because Rodney Hood has been both.
"oh the lakers series that didn't have covington or djj? or nassir little? or rodney hood? or enes kanter? yeah it went pretty bad. still took 1 game, just like every other team the lakers beat on their way to a championship.   congrats on ""shredding"" portland missing their 2nd and 3rd best players, at home, and losing lmao. can't wait to watch zion leave your scrub ass city like AD did."
"Top five picks have approximately a 1-in-3 chance of becoming all-stars.  Utah's last 3 ""top-5"" picks were Exum, Kanter, &amp; Deron William's. So their scouting &amp; development of elite talent is average.   However, their ability to scout--then draft &amp; develop--late lottery &amp; draft/undrafted talent, or G-league talent, has been very good.   Aside from players on their own roster in this category (O'Neale, Ingles, Niang, Oni), they are also responsible for bringing many other players into the league still currently on rosters, &amp; who've had mulit-season NBA careers through these channels through the Utah Jazz organization, including:   Gordon Hayward  Rodney Hood   Alec Burks  Trey Lyles  DeMarre Carroll   Rayjon Tucker  Wes Matthews   Tony Bradley  Raul Neto  Paul Millsap.  There are likely more still playing, but that's all I can think of off the top of my head."
"same thing happened to Rodney Hood.  had calf soreness or a strain, tore his achilles.  It looks like there is a correlation"
Pretty sure Rodney Hood was dealing with the same issue before he tore his Achilles. I cannot recall if it was just calf soreness or a strain
"Blazers when healthy has a bench of   - Anfernee Simons - Gary Trent  - Carmelo Anthony - Zach Collins - Enes Kanter  As well as Rodney hood, Harry Giles and Nasir Little"
Or the time I saw Rodney Hood at a grocery store. Still haven’t seen the word “infetterence” used anywhere else.
Money wise this works doubt that Cavs go for it though: Rodney Hood and Zach Collins/Nassir Little for Larry Nance. Not really a dream trade but a somewhat realistic trade I want to happen.
“@Woj: Breaking Rodney Hood has requested a trade from the Portland Trail Blazers. Hood is said to have become unsatisfied with his role on the team.”
Poor Rodney Hood had to guard Embiid lol.
Didn’t know I needed Rodney Hood guarding Joel Embiid until I saw it.  I think I’m a masochist
Hasn’t Kanter been outplaying Nurkic this season anyway? Also those other guys besides Rodney Hood weren’t even in the rotation.
Teams leaving Rodney hood wide open who’s allegedly a career 37% 3 point shooter to double Dame sums up this Portland offense
"This is just a plain stupid take.   Our rotation was:  **Starters:** George Hill, JR Smith, LeBron James, Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson.   **Bench:** Jordan Clarkson, Kyle Korver, Rodney Hood, Jeff Green, Larry Nance Jr.   And then the three guys to round out our roster were Jose Calderon, Cedi Osman and Ante Zizic.  Please enlighten me; what about this roster screams *great team*?"
Rodney Hood
"They're adjusted by individual player performance and his has been bad. Which is why it is reflected as such. You notice the same players appear around where he is and the seasons they have had, regardless of team (Rodney Hood)."
"It was Rodney Hood, and before him Mario Hezonja and before him Meyers Leonard.  Now? I don't know."
"Rodney Hood? He wasn’t a borderline all star but he was pretty good for awhile, he had really bad nerves."
"Is the team good or bad? If they are bad then Trae Young but if they are already good then I'd probably take Trae Young.  Who would you rather take if you are trying to win games, Ben Simmons or Rodney Hood?"
"Turns out that's actually a Rodney hood wig, my bad"
bruh why he looking like Rodney Hood in that picture
Rodney Hood is also an all-time great when you compare him to 450+ million who have played basketball.
"K-Love, TT, JR Smith, Jordan Clarkson, old Kyle Korver, Rodney Hood, Jae Crowder, Jeff Green, young Ingram, young Randle, young Lonzo, young Kuzma, Rondo, and KCP... There are a lot of names there I would take over pretty much any of Steph’s current teammates apart from Draymond and maybe Wigs"
where is rodney hood and does jalen harris get to play
"In my opinion, that has to be the greatest playoff run ever. I have never seen a collection of teammates seemingly conspire against their best player like that. I mean there is so much about that run already lost in history. George Hill, Clarkson, and Nance had straight up like complete dissociations with thousand yard stares all around. Rodney Hood had a nervous breakdown in the playoffs. TT had the whole kardashian drama that year and didn’t even play decent until the second round. Kevin Love got injured in the ECF. LeBron winning games with his next highest scorer being at like 12 pts. Scoring or assisting on nearly ever basket, etc. LeBron drug that Cavs squad kicking and screaming to the finals. There were games that Jeff Green and 36 yr old Korver were his 2nd and 3rd best players during that playoffs, and it wasn’t even their playmaking or shooting. They were just the only ones who looked like they cared on defense.   It’s funny now to see some of that squad’s careers play out. Like that playoffs forever has altered my opinion of Clarkson, George Hill, Hood, etc."
"Thank you, Rodney Hood"
Rodney Hood and Stanley Johnson..
Yuta Watanabe and (maybe) Rodney Hood
Wow he’s better than a KD that literally isn’t playing  Rodney Hood is better than Anthony Davis right now too
"Yes, it happens a ton and it has happened for years. The person you're taking the number from generally has to be a relatively unknown player where there aren't thousands and thousands of unsold jerseys of that player out there in the world.  Another example is Landry Shamet, it has happened to him twice. When Jimmy Butler came to Philly, Jimmy took Shamet's number 23 and Shamet switched to 5. When James Harden came to Brooklyn, Harden took Shamet's number 13 and switched to 20.  Edit: Derrick Jones Jr. just switched his number mid-season from #55 to #5. Rodney Hood had previously worn #5 but when he got traded away, Jones was allowed to switch to #5."
"And now we just traded for the guy we should have taken with that pick, Rodney Hood."
Yea it did. He started getting talked about for being more clutch after those shots over lebron/Rodney hood or whoever shot over in 2018. The narrative about his post season play changed dramatically in the right direction.
"50 shots, 62.4% usage, amazing to drop 60 no matter how many shots you take but he really did highjack the offense.  That Jazz team was starting Shelvin Mack, Trey Lyles, Jeff Withey and Rodney Hood.  That's the post-2003 Kobe tradeoff, he can get you a decent shot whenever, but he didn't really do much else at a very high level.  Frobe could rebound and defend but those skills waned with time.  As maybe the best tough shot maker of all-time I don't want to diminish his legacy too much, you have to make tough shots against playoff defenses to win big games, but even peak Kobe he didn't bring much else to the table other than his (admittedly breath-taking and very valuable) isolation mid-range game."
"People were definitely saying it when Harden came. KD and Kyrie were already a huge duo, and then they got one of the best players in the game. People weren't sure if it was gonna work out so well (over 9000 offense..!) but they were def saying it was nutts. This was even more amplified because of KDs history around taking offense to ""ring chasing"". I mean eventually people stopped talking about it as much but it's still def talked about.  Picking up two massive Allstars for pennies on-top of all that is insane. They are def past their prime but they are Allstars. We're not talking about picking up Rodney Hood or some other back bench player. Two future HoF's for nothing. On top of the already massive super team.   Dont get upset about people's reactions, but don't play dumb either. It's insane."
"Dame is one of the worst defenders in the league lmao, Kanter is too, but Dame will never have a defense around him like Steph because he’s a notably worse defender.  Dame is playing at an MVP-level this year, and he’s made pretty much every close game into a win. Cant count that against him, but to act like he’s better than Steph because he’s managed more regular season wins this season is a hilarious stretch.  Wiggins stats may be better, but the type of player Wiggins is, is very different from Trent lol. One requires isolation touches to be at max production.  Oubre is a significantly more important part of the Warriors than a bench piece in Rodney Hood lol. We actually need Oubre’s scoring to win games.  Dame has been impressive this year there’s no doubt. But this roster construction would not work for Dame nor Harden, they simply demand the ball too much. I think Dame could play like Curry-lite in Kerr’s system of course, but then you wouldn’t have that “floor raising” you’re referencing, because you’re essentially asking Steph to take every possession in iso, which is the antithesis of the Warriors offense.  Curry is literally putting up similar stats to Dame but the records are different. How do you point to that, and say it’s clearly the difference between Dame and Curry and not the roster at that point?"
Man I wish I was Rodney from the Hood.
Honestly we all got real excited about Gary Trent Jr but I’ve been pretty impressed with Rodney Hood today. I thought he was just there for salary matching but he’s been alright
"Yeah, Wikipedia says she moved to Tennessee when she was 13-14. Rodney Hood would have been 9-10 at the time."
Rodney Hood was who I wanted to drafted in 2014.
"I like Rodney Hood, cool guy nice player"
Rodney Hood in the locker room telling them it's his team now
They're missing Rodney Hood
Rodney Hood is a good basketball player
Build around Rodney Hood
*Raises hand to identify as one of the 20 Paramore/Rodney Hood fans
Rodney Hood needs to win it for Paramore
Rodney Hood revenge SZN
That’s the first time I’ve seen Rodney hood talking shit on the court lmao
TIL: there is a degree of separation between a Paramore fan and Rodney Hood.
"Bruh, .00001% more likely.  Rodney Hood fans alone gotta be 1 in 10,000 at best."
"No worries bro, I was speaking generally.  I know to you, particularly being a Jazz fan, it's funny cause of Rodney Hood.  To most of r/nba it's white rocker girl learning to crip walk from black nba player."
"Wasn’t a hardcore paramore fan, but did like some songs.  Also very indifferent on Rodney hood, so I might be the 99%."
"This is bullshit. I grew up in Meridian and had several friends who lived in the neighborhood Hayley Williams lived in. Rodney Hood didn't live in that neighborhood. Hayley moved away when she was in junior high. Hayley was multiple grades above Rodney, so the only time that she possibly could have gone to the same school was elementary school.  There were tons of guys named Rodney, so she probably is just misremembering."
"I'm going to r/thatsthejoke for foreigners or otherwise oblivious people:  It would have been funny regardless. Rodney Hood seems unassuming so the idea of him crip-walking is funny to you.  To white people, proximity to Blackness and the contrast with a mostly ""white"" existence has been a source of humor for as long as we can remember.  It's ""funny"" to envision a white girl like Hayley Williams cripwalking. It's ""funny"" to envision a buttoned up family man who suffers from anxiety like Rodney Hood cripwalking.  It probably would have been funnier if it was someeone like Lance Stephenson."
 &gt;Because I can't imagine Rodney ever dancing let alone crip walking lol. He's really reserved.  Displaying hood tendencies.
"First girlfriend was a huge paramore fan and I became a hayley williams simp,naturally.  Also I happened to be a jazz fan, loved rodney hood when we got him.  I am the 1%."
Or she just thinks all black dudes named Rodney are Rodney Hood lol
"I think this story might be actually true, even if Rodney Hood doesn’t remember it. Hood went to Meridian High School, in Meridian, Mississippi. Hayley Williams was born in Meridian, Mississippi. Good is 28, Williams is 32. It’s not impossible that they knew each other. Maybe Hood was a really popular jock and doesn’t remember the HS scene girl that was a few years ahead of him. That wouldn’t surprise me."
I saw Rodney Hood at the food court in the MGM grand back when the 2019 NBA Summer league was going. He was standing right behind me in line. I would normally say what's up if I see a NBA player in public like that but he looked so awkward and dull just like in this video. Do what you want with that information
"It’s funny they both became major successes in realms so different that they weren’t aware of the other. Like Hayley isn’t the biggest music artist of all time but I’m certain if I grew up near her, I’d drop that fact all the time. Similar with Rodney hood"
"""THAT""S WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU LET YOUR HEART WIN""  -Rodney Hood"
Rodney Hood has always struck me as more of a Hey Monday fan anyways...
"Imagine being the kid that grew up across the street from Haley Williams and Rodney Hood, yet you're still living in the same neighborhood and working at the local Amazon warehouse."
That was also Rodney Hood
"I never thought I’d see Hayley on this sub, wow. Much less having anything to do with Rodney Hood of all people.   Shoutout to Paramore for being one of the only bands I listened to years ago that I still listen to and also just one of my favorite bands ever. Brand New Eyes is still my favorite album of theirs but After Laughter is close"
"The overlap of Paramore and Rodney Hood fans must be thin, but those folks have to be ecstatic by this news"
"Definitely, this is probably the most random thing I’ve seen on this sub. Also idk why but the fact it was Rodney Hood of all players makes it super funny to me."
I could see what influence Rodney Hood had on crushcrushcrush.
I wish I was Rodney Hood
I’ll trade Rodney Hood for Paramore to play misery business at halftime
listen to some Paramore and think about how Rodney hood influenced their music. I want a 5 page paper on it by tuesday
"I wonder which  low end Toronto rapper gonna use the “we in the hood, no rodney” bar first  My guess is Roney but we’ll see"
"The return definitely wouldn’t have been the same for Lowry compared to Oladipo, Lowrys still seen as a positive asset. And any return you MIGHT get from a S&amp;T is going to be worse as well. Add the Powell trade to the mix and this was overall a BAD trade deadline for the Raps. How you have 2 highly coveted guards and wind up with no draft picks and Rodney Hood, is a fucking horrible look for Masai."
Rodney Hood + Gary Trent Jr for someone make it happen.
"They would need a roster on par with like the 2019 Raptors or current Jazz talent wise where 1-8 every dude is solid. Dame, Trent, CJ, Nurkic, Melo, and Covington are all solid. The Derrick Jones Jr role is the weak link, but he would be fine off the bench. Rodney Hood was also playing crunch time minutes for them and I just don't have much faith in him anymore. Even when Zach Collins is healthy he wouldn't be enough. They need defense. The dream replacement would be Draymond but that will never happen. The only hope would be to take a gamble on an Aaron Gordon type player or younger and hope you can turn them into Draymond lite. I don't see Dame and CJ breaking up either. It's not like CJ would fetch much. If you could replace CJ with like Gordon Hayward or Jaylen Brown that might help but again I would doubt that would happen. Maybe Myles Turner? But that may just create more problems."
"People blame everyone around LeBron as if that team was made to function at all. Rag tag thrown together average to good players that were expected to win a championship over night. If you only watched that season you would think George Hill, Jordan Clarkson, and Rodney Hood don’t even belong in the NBA."
"Rodney Hood wears #5, which was Ha Seung-jin's number."
Rodney Hood for Jayson Tatum seems like a fair trade to me
"He was at best the 3rd best defender on his own team and got to benefit from Draymond and iguodala doing the heavy lifting with help defense rotations etc the stuff that’s more important while he just got to focus on his man. And he didn’t even have to guard anybody in round 2 or the WCF, guys like Patty Mills and Rodney hood a true gauntlet  The “but his defense was good” when it’s a guard is basically just holding guys to role player expectations"
sorry but you really think Brad Wanamaker will be #1 in a few years? over Rodney Hood? give me a break
Will Barton was our third best player last year and is mad underrated when healthy. Probs because he jas missed both playoff runs and came out of the gate complete ass this year after that knee injury.  15/5/4 on solid splits with solid D matters. Less against the Lakers than against the Blazers in 2019 obviously. That's a 7 game series that went to the wire multiple times and was eventually decided by a hot Rodney Hood of all people.
"Works in the trade machine:  Portland gets: Aaron Gordon, James Ennis  Orlando gets: Gary Trent Jr, Rodney Hood, Zac Collins"
"Portland gets: Aaron Gordon, James Ennis  Magic get: Rodney Hood, Gary Trent Jr. , Zac Collins  ???"
"If I never see Rodney Hood on the floor again this season, that’ll be fine with me."
"Zach Collins, Enes Kanter, Rodney Hood, 2021 2nd, 2022 First  Collins to build up/around, the picks to supplement, Kanter/Hood as cap filler.  And then we just accept that we'll be terrible after Dame's prime is over and we have no picks."
Would've been nice if Stotts gave more minutes to Derrick Jones Jr instead of Rodney Hood
Rodney Hood 2019 second round against Denver....hit a game winner in 4OT in game 4 and scored 25 points on 8/12 shooting in a must-win elimination game 6.
Rodney Hood + 2 seconds for George Hill so Dame doesn't have to be the only decent playmaker on the roster
"Seems kinda familiar. We sat one of our players who was on fire, Nassir Little, for the near entire 4th and let Rodney Hood run the offense until like 3 minutes left when we were already down 6."
Terry Stotts playing Rodney Hood way more minutes than him will always confuse me
Yeah he’s developing. But Stotts isn’t doing anything to help him when he pulls him out of the game for doing well and puts in Rodney Hood
i compare him to guys like Jordan Clarkson and Rodney Hood.  great guys to come off the bench and get you buckets in a hurry
Rodney Hood for sure
"Rodney Hood, GHill &amp; Larry Nance Jr also took off later on."
"Blazers seem to get frustrated with the refs and give up points. That Saric out of bounds and Rodney Hood as non-shooting were probably wrong, but the Suns sure made them pay for losing focus.  And this is not a blocking foul on DJJ, cmon."
Also: shouldn't Rodney Hood be way better? 6'9 and a good athlete.
Rodney Hood was TRASH on that cavs team. Rose straight up disappeared... I don’t know if it’s an ego or pride thing. But some guys really disappear while playing with Lebron. Darion Williams had the quietest retirement ever after that god awful playoffs run. It’s honestly insane how some guys almost throw it playing on a Lebron team. I still remember when Bron threw a bone at Oden and Beasley... Jesus Christ. I know LeGM... but some of those guys had their souls cut out of their body. Running off fumes.. Jerez.
"&gt; So which skills? What about their defensive skill sets makes Fournier better.  Size, strength, length, positional versatility.  &gt; For last season the following are guys who spent more time guarding the opponents highest usage player than Fournier: Tim Hardaway, Elfrid Payton, Rodney Hood, Dillon Brooks, Glenn Robinson. Are any of these close to high quality defenders? No. There alot of really good defenders who guard the best option alot but it by itself doesnt tell you much.  Did you notice all of these guys played on bad to pathetic defenses? Compared to Fournier being on a top 10 defense. There’s a difference between guarding elite players because your team is devoid of defensive talent and being the most important perimeter defender on a top 10 defense.   &gt; This isnt about arguing about the merits of defensive metrics, on/off data etc. It's just to tell you factually when Fournier has been on the court they havent been at that defensive level overall. They are that kind of defense because of the minutes when he's not on the court.  Using individual drtg percentiles is doing my head in, I can’t think of why anyone would use that. I don’t know what you’re using to look at these but I would hazard a guess just based on logic that centers, other big men, and bench players dominate the upper percentiles. Last season his drtg was 109.5, which would have been the 7th best defense in the league. So in the minutes he was on they performed as the 7 best defense in the league, which is even better than our overall 10th ranked defense."
"&gt;Based on their defensive skill sets.  So which skills? What about their defensive skill sets makes Fournier better.   &gt;In a death lineup scenario the lakers would have AD and Lebron on the floor to guard guys who can physically overpower Fournier  Teams are going to hunt the weak defender like Tor and Mil did the past 2 postseasons. Having AD and LeBron to help helps alot(so did Jonathan Isaac in 2019) but your still introducing a weak link and area they can attack to begin with.   For reference [you can look up from 2014-20 how much any defender spent on the opponents no 1, no 2, no 3 option](https://apanalytics.shinyapps.io/knarsu3/). For last season the following are guys who spent more time guarding the opponents highest usage player than Fournier: Tim Hardaway, Elfrid Payton, Rodney Hood, Dillon Brooks, Glenn Robinson. Are any of these close to high quality defenders? No. There alot of really good defenders who guard the best option alot but it by itself doesnt tell you much.  &gt;we’ve been a top 10 defense each of the last two years  Im on CTG looking at the Magic's defensive rating when Fournier has been on the court the past 2 yrs:   This yr: 29th percentile Last yr: 51st percentile  This isnt about arguing about the merits of defensive metrics, on/off data etc. It's just to tell you factually when Fournier has been on the court they havent been at that defensive level overall. They are that kind of defense because of the minutes when he's not on the court."
Is it as bad as Rodney Hood not knowing what Paramore is?
DJ was still one of the best rim rollers and paint protectors at this time he made the all star game that year. You think Rodney Hood won that series for the Jazz? Burks? Hayward who was sick for part of it? Hill? That Lob City team was good. CP3 didn't play so bad he deserved to be torch d but he certainly didn't step up and win the series like someone of his caliber is supposed to
What a series man....... Also fuck Rodney Hood
"I miss Rodney.  I know it was the right thing, but damn, given all the mental health issues he had, and how the team rallied around him, I really wanted his redemption arc to last longer with us.  RODNEY HOOD TO COAST!"
*Sad Rodney Hood noises*
"Rodney Hood probably gonna be out too, considering he has a broken metacarpal."
I can’t see Rodney Hood’s name without hearing Shay Sharpe say “Rodney I’m so Hood”
"totally unbiased opinion here, they should also trade Myles Turner to Toronto for Rodney Hood and Aron Baynes"
Rodney Hood
"I posted this elsewhere here, but here are your lowest 20 per 36 Marvel Point accumulators (min 500 MP).   |Player|MHP per 36| :--|--:| |Wesley Matthews|8.5| |Rodney Hood|8.5| |Isaac Okoro|9.6| |Gary Clark|9.6| |Chasson Randle|9.7| |P.J.

"Cavs definitely had some brick layers, especially that last year he made the finals with them.   It was painful to watch guys like Jordan Clarkson and Rodney Hood clanging balls off of the rim over and over. Even Kyle Korver was struggling with his shot in the playoffs that year."
"LeBron has played 10,811 playoff minutes, which is more than the regular season minutes any player from the 2016 draft class except Buddy Hield (10,906). He has more playoff minutes than Cody Zeller's regular season minutes, and he was drafted in 2013. More than Clint Capela, Rodney Hood, Joe Harris, and TJ Warren who have been in the league for seven years. More than Kelly Oubre or D'Angelo Russell. More than anyone from 2017 even if you include their playoff minutes.  Crazy durability."
"Somehow had Isiah Thomas, Derrick Rose, Dwayne Wade, and Jae Crowder, a weird fucking injured mix of malcontents.   Then trade them for Clarkson, Nance, George Hill, Rodney Hood, and Jeff Green, who all promptly have their talents stolen by the Mon-Stars."
"Team “JM”:  Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Jalen McDaniels, Jaden McDaniels, JaVale McGee  Team “RH”:  R.J. Hampton, Rodney Hood, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Rui Hachimura, Richaun Holmes    Team “JC”: Jevon Carter, Jordan Clarkson, Jarrett Culver, Jae Crowder, John Collins   Team “LD”:  Luka Doncic, Lu Dort, no other players needed."
"I would say it’s an outlier as well. First, KD’s arguably the most skilled player to ever play at that size, so losing a step/half a step in explosiveness wouldn’t affect him to the same degree as it does Wall.  Second, I’d say KD &amp; Wall being superstars/max contract guys allowed them to take as long as possible in the rehab process. The shutdown last year definitely played a role, but by all accounts there was never any rush to bring these guys back. They went 18-24 months without playing, so the more rehab time the better.  For role players like Rodney Hood, Wes Matthews, etc., they just don’t have the same sense of contract and roster security as guys like KD. We’ll see if medical teams change this trend, but being a role player obviously doesn’t give you the same leash in taking a super-prolonged rehab process. Overall though, I’m just happy to see KD balling out &amp; I hope Achilles injuries can start to be less career-damaging in the future."
"&gt; “The surgery is still basically bringing one end [of the tendon] up against the other and holding it together until your body lays down enough new collagen to rebuild it,” Geier said. “We haven’t really improved on that.” The biggest changes in Achilles protocols in recent years have been ramped-up rehab schedules, designed to prevent a degree of muscle weakness, and the use of platelet-rich plasma injections and stem cell treatments. However, such measures have been more successful at reducing recovery timelines than boosting prognoses. “What I don’t feel has changed is that a large percentage of players that return drop in terms of minutes played, games played and player efficiency ratings,” Geier said.  This is interesting   I’m glad KD is ballin out but in general I’m still pretty skeptical that his case is more than just an outlier and that Achilles tears still aren’t crippling injuries. John Wall we were all ready to annoint as back after his first few weeks unfortunately has not been great. Multiple impact metrics have Rodney hood as one of the worst players in the nba level bad this year  &gt; Durant is making 52.7 percent of his tightly guarded threes  Lol"
"Dude I have never heard anyone ever argue 8ppg on 36% shooting argued like that. For your third best scorer that is a joke. Also +/- numbers there mean almost nothing. Cmon dude that’s not even Rodney Hood numbers. He was the teams 5th option behind Tristan Thompson. Was he playing all NBA defense? Because he is there to play all nba offense, and rebound like a mf. Not be Draymond Green without passing on offense. He played smart sure but like I would take PJ Tucker over that. And that dude doesn’t account for a max contract.idk who Kev thinks he is gonna help"
How dare you forget about Rodney Hood and his -7.2 this year
thought rodney hood here was desmond from rdcworld for a second lmao
"He was exhausted. Even CJ McCollum, who is in about the best shape in the NBA, was exhausted. A relatively well rested Rodney Hood won us that game."
"So he wasn’t fine then? Even a guy like Jokic with good stamina is going to struggle a bit after playing a playoff-intensity game for more than an hour... so no need to act like he was “fine”. It’s not a diss on Jok. He still had a good game overall.   Fresh legs definitely won Portland that game, Rodney Hood won it for them."
And of all the firepower both teams had it was Rodney fuckin Hood who ended up being the X factor in that series
Just Rodney Hood
"which is silly but the top 5% have the strongest say, like people give much more of a shit about what lebron says vs what rodney hood says lol"
"I see his VORP as 0.7 which actually ranks him in the top 113 out of 524 total players.  Anthony Edwards ranks 519 out of 524 which is interesting. The only players below him are Sekou Doumbouya, Isaac Okoro, Dwayne Bacon, Rodney Hood, and Theo Maledon."
PG - Russell Westbrook SG - Rodney Hood SF - Cam Reddish PF - Carmelo Anthony C - James Wiseman Bench - Hassan Whiteside Bench - Marcus Morris Bench - Derrick Jones Bench - Nerlens Noel Bench - Torrey Craig Bench - Eric Bledsoe Bench - Kelly Oubre  This team is a a disaster defensively and the stagnation offensively would be atrocious.
"PG- D.J Augustin  SG- Luke Kennard  SF- Rodney Hood  PF- Rodions Kurucs  C- Justin Patton  Bench: Matthew Dellevadova, Alex Caruso, Mike Scott, TJ Leaf, Goga Bitadze"
PG Coby White   SG Wayne Ellington  SF Rodney Hood  PF Harry Giles   C DeAndre Jordan  idk really. the best I could do
"Jae Crowder (yes he was traded but he was on that team), Jordan Clarkson, George Hill, Jeff Green, Rodney Hood, Kyle Korver, Larry Nance jr, JR Smith &amp; Tristan Thompson as support around a consistent 3rd option scoring 16-18ppg (there is max 3 teams in the league right now that could say no to such a 3rd option...) in Kevin Love, and THEN you have Kyrie and Lebron. Really don't believe i'm overhyping them, it's just not true Lebron was alone against the world."
"2nd Cavs team was stacked with a bunch of people excelling in their roles like Korver, Henneyboy, Thompson and people that played awesome directly after that for other teams like Rodney Hood and Jeff Green. Yeah this Lakers team is great but why is everyone lying about the  2nd Cavs team? They were a fine-tuned squad with excellent players on nearly all spots."
Nope you guys should be pissed you traded Norm for a 22 year old with the potential to be a 20++ppg scorer and good defender (and rodney hood) He had one bad game you guys are dumb!   /s if it wasn’t obvious
2018 Rodney Hood had the most lethal jab step I’ve ever seen 😂
"You really compared 22-year-old Jamal to the current one? And, Dame was atrocious that series, what are you talking about? Gary Harris was locking him up. CJ and Rodney Hood won that series."
"2016-2017 Jazz go from good 5 seed to Elite Team  Pg - George Hill, Raul Neto, Exum, Shelvin Mack  SG - Joe Johnson, Alec Burks, Rodney Hood  SF - Gordon Hayward, Joe Ingles  PF - Derrick Favors, Trey Lyles  C - Rudy Gobert, Boris Diaw  &amp;#x200B;  You'd have an elite scoring option in Joe Johnson, DPOY Gobert, Hayward before injury, Leader in 3Pt% Joe Ingles, and an elite slasher in George Hill. Plus, Burks/Hood/Ingles/Diaw becomes one of the best bench units in the NBA."
Rodney Hood made 8 in a game playing for the Jazz against the Lakers?
"It depends on the rehab of the injury.  I thought Rodney Hood would be a game changer after rehab, man was I dreaming."
Don't forget Rodney Hood
Give Stotts a competent wing and he does too. We had one wing who could create on offense his entire run in Portland (Rodney Hood in 2019) not a coincidence that was the same year we went to the conference finals
"To be fair MPJ was pretty hit or miss against you guys. He's one of the best shooters in the league and contests don't bother him. He shot near the most 3's in the entire league with a tight contest and shot them about as well as Steph or Dame. Overall I thought he had a poor series. His back is fucked now, he looked like he was really struggling to move last night so it is what it is.  We went 2-22 in the first half last night. That's one of the worst showings in playoff history I don't think there is much to read into that other than we shot about as bad as humanly possible.   I would say Monte playing with the bench was a choice to win those minutes. His pick and roll game was cooking all series, like near 1.2 points per possession. I think our offence looked pretty good in the closing minutes when Monte and Jokic shared the court. Nurk didn't play a lot of those minutes, although to be fair when he did in game 6 the Monte/Jokic 2 game was cooking pretty good. The Facu/Rivers backcourt is pretty rough. If that combo plays a lot of minutes again I expect the Suns to wreck us in game 3.  Who knows in 6 games there is always a lot of variance. Rodney Hood going Micheal Jordan or Austin Rivers making 5, 3s in a quarter."
Nuggets were owed a big role player game from the basketball gods to make up for Rodney Hood turning into Micheal Jordan in game 6 of their 2019 series.
"you're forgetting that was ramadan-superpowers Enes. But that Denver series was on the backs of CJ, Moe Harkless, and Rodney Hood."
"Dude threw old ass Ariza, Rodney Hood, Danuel House and Zach fucking Collins in there 💀💀💀  By that logic we missed 21 games of Avery Bradley and 5 games of Playoff Rondo so it pretty much cancels out!"
Some teams elect to do that to not allow a great half court defensive team to get set.  Rodney Hood came down and hit a game winner for the Jazz some years ago when the Jazz did the same thing.  Sometimes it works.
My favorite ever is Rodney Hood coming in on fresh legs in triple overtime while everyone else was doubled over sucking air
"&gt;he’s worth way more than the MLE  I mean, not really?  Did Trez have an above average season, yes.  But 1) fans discount defense in favor of offensive stats and 2) fans also don't seem realize the contracts of certain role players.     This year, Jae Crowder, Derrick Favors, Serge Ibaka, and Tristan Thompson all made MLE.  They don't necessarily put up the numbers that Trez does, but they are all likely more reliable players for a playoff team as they aren't huge defensive sieves.  The year before that, Seth Curry, Derrick Rose, and Tyus Jones all signed for roughly the full MLE, while other good players like Bullock, JaMychal Green, Richauln Holmes, and Rodney Hood all signed for less.     Literally every single one of those guys has an argument for being a more useful player for a contending team looking for playoff success than Trez.  Trez absolutely has a market, but it's smaller given his playstyle (which is good for the regular season, but difficult to play in the playoffs).    Saying that he deserve ""way more than MLE"" is silly, because substantially more useful players get MLE all the time."
Reminds me of Rodney Hood who killed us in 2019
Better than Rodney Hood or GTJ.
Rodney hood has been inconsistent since leaving the cavs. Jr isn’t even in the league. Kevin love is not relevant. Iman shumpert is out of the league. Yea these players have gotten so much better since lebron dipped.
"[Except they made offers, you’re just in denial.](https://theathletic.com/2469290/2021/03/25/nba-trade-deadline-week-2021-live-blog-updates-news-and-observations-from-the-athletics-insiders/)   [1](https://twitter.com/stadium/status/1375147775659278340?s=21)  [2](https://mobile.twitter.com/iraheatbeat/status/1375157134749396993) [3](https://mobile.twitter.com/keithsmithnba/status/1375130727533150215?lang=en) [4](https://www.phillyvoice.com/nba-trade-rumors-sixers-kyle-lowry-raptors-price-heat-nba-trade-deadline/)  [5](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31124737/toronto-raptors-discussing-kyle-lowry-norman-powell-trades)  And obviously there’s more sources like these ones that can be discovered through google.   [They initially didn’t even want to trade Kyle until the deadline was nearing](https://www.tsn.ca/josh-lewenberg-kyle-lowry-shows-rare-emotion-after-possible-final-game-with-raptors-1.1613208)   [Was also reported multiple weeks prior in this report that they telling inquiring teams they weren’t moving him](https://www.tsn.ca/josh-lewenberg-would-the-raptors-consider-moving-red-hot-norman-powell-ahead-of-trade-deadline-1.1609888)  [It was reported that KCP, Trez, and Dennis were available for trades](https://mobile.twitter.com/jakelfischer/status/1374803501298122754?lang=en)   &gt;I don’t care about this point enough to continue   This confirmation bias beating your ass right now lol. This wasn’t an article about popularity, it was an article about influence. You also picked an article based on the opinions of one person. This is embarrassing.   You’re going to need to include sources, because one article is saying that average ticket price for a Raptors game is $179 (according to Yahoo Finances on November 2019) and another is barely over $101.   But yeah, the Maple Leafs franchise as a whole is more popular than the Raptors, but that has little to do with the players and more to do with the love the city has for hockey. You can make the argument that Matthews is more popular, but otherwise this  is the equivalent of saying those garbage players on the Lakers in 2015 (outside of Kobe) were more popular than Clayton Kershaw. Just a weird hill to die on.   You’re talking about trades, I’m talking about the Lakers giving him a new contract. You already said his contract was un-tradable, but the Lakers willingly gave him that new contract when they never had to. Pay attention.   Man Trez has struggled to stay on the floor for two straight postseasons.   There’s all the evidence that suggests Masai was willing to keep Lowry, even if he would walk for free in Free Agency. You can willingly ignore it and draw your own conclusions from it but it’s there. There’s no evidence of Masai just taking *any* offer just because they’re the only ones. There’s no evidence of Masai even having much interest in any of the players offered in these trades even dating back to his Nuggets days, and that includes Tyrese Maxey who they never had any sort of contact with.   And Maxey was surely in his draft range, at least more than Jalen Smith (who the Raptors met with), who was selected way higher than Maxey and their draft selection.   &gt;Caldwell-Pope has way more value that Rodney Hood, and more to the point, way more value than Kyle Lowry   Oh my God, I should’ve known I was arguing with an idiot. Aye man, just because people having been teasing the Lakers about not trading for Lowry doesn’t mean you have to say ridiculous shit to justify the move. Hope you can recover from this, have a good day,   One thing I will say is that we will revisit this when Lowry gets his money in FA, remind me."
"&gt;If there was no offers it wouldn’t have been discussed by management or any of the other credible reporters.  Of course it would, for exactly the reason I explained at least twice.  Toronto wanted to trade him, but was underwhelmed by the market, so they leaked rumors in an attempt to drum up something better.  This happens almost every year with the Lakers.  Pay attention.  &gt;None of those teams can afford to pile up $30 million dollars worth of trash players to exchange for Lowry. Danny Green, Duncan Robinson, KCP, Dennis, etc. aren’t trash.  None of who teams?  What are you talking about?  If Lowry were half as good as you claim, every team in the league would be lining up to trade their ""trash"" players for him.  Instead, no one even made an offer.  &gt;And IIRC we are two years removed from Kawhi being a Raptor.  Fine, Lowry is second to a Clipper, who played one season in Canada.  Is that better?  No.  I don't care enough about this point to continue, but suffice it to say that a few weeks ago, before their most recent disaster, the Maple Leafs were the most popular athletes in Toronto.  As recently as 2019, Leafs' tickets cost more than double Raptors' tickets, on average.  Why would that be, if Lowry is so popular?  &gt;The Lakers had opportunities to move on from him and fully rebuild but were content with keeping Kobe...because he is Kobe.  Maybe you don't remember, or weren't old enough yet, but Bryant was largely hated by everyone he ever played with, except Pau Gasol, and most of his coaches, too.  No team was trading for the most-expensive player in the league, whose skills and durability were in serious decline, and destroying their lockerroom in the process.  And again, he was a Laker lifer.  There are extremely few lifers who have won multiple rings with a franchise and were subsequently traded late in their careers.  And the Lakers have **never** traded any lifer who won more than 2 rings with them.  There are a few such players that they let walk as free agents -- Kurt Rambis, AC Green, Derek Fisher -- but none have ever been traded.  These are things you might want to know, if you are going to pretend to be knowledgeable on the subject.  &gt;Of course he would, lol. Dennis is an expiring (and no, we wouldn’t have paid him, which is why we traded Norm in the first place). KCP doesn’t have much value and Trez isn’t good.  Caldwell-Pope has way more value than Rodney Hood, and more to the point, way more value than Lowry now does.  And if those guys are all worthless, I guess that means my point has been proven.  The league -- who has watched Lowry for \~15 years -- agrees with my opinion of him, that he's just not particularly good anymore, and certainly not worth $30M either in assets or in salary.  &gt;Trez isn’t good  Utter nonsense.  He was one of the more sought-after free agents last November.  He played well for the Lakers, but Vogel is not very good at figuring out how to allot minutes when given a bunch of options.  &gt;Masai didn’t get what he wanted from a trade, and Lowry never suggested he would leave (even if his contract was over), so yeah he kept him. I don’t understand what’s difficult about that.  Because passing on the best available offer, and taking nothing instead, is the mark of a rank amateur.  And there's no evidence that Masai is that incompetent.  The only explanation that is actually sensible -- and backed by about 70 years of professional basketball history -- is that a 35 year-old 6'0"" guard is neither particularly good, nor valuable, and especially not for $30M, so no one was interested and Masai simply had to eat the remainder of Lowry's contract."
"then just look at us last year then. We were still 3rd on offense. We had Dame, who missed a handful of games himself, CJ (who's inconsistent and inefficient), and ... that's it. Rodney Hood was elite for the first 20 games, then he tore his Achilles. Trevor Ariza was okay for the 15ish games he had him for. Melo was extremely inconsistent and inefficient. GTJ only popped off the last month or so. Whiteside can't shoot. Simons, Bazemore, Hezonja, and Tolliver were all hot garbage. the roster around Dame and CJ last year wasn't significantly better than the roster around Steph/Wiggins this year. You could even argue it was worse"
So Rodney Hood when he was on the Jazz?
That's what it felt like with Rodney Hood when y'all beat us last series lol
Trade Norm Powell to the Raptors for Gary Trent Jr and Rodney Hood
They need Rodney Hood...he was our cryptonite
I remember Rodney Hood dueling Paul Millsap at the end
Your welcome Nuggets fans for trading Rodney Hood
"If it wasn’t for Rodney fuckin Hood, Nuggets would have won two years ago. Free Dame."
"CJ really is just Rodney Hood with muscle, huh?"
Where tf is Rodney Hood when you need him
"4OT game against Denver, he subbed in and sank a 3. https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/portland-trail-blazers/return-rodney-hood-his-fresh-legs-were-welcomed-all"
"Feels like I've seen this before. Rodney Hood, incoming?"
Toronto bros... is Rodney Hood available? We might need him.
DAME CHANNELING THE GHOST OF RODNEY HOOD
"Quick, someone get in touch with Rodney Hood."
"Rodney hood had all nba potential, felt that way for so long!"
"I mean even we weren't interested until we lost Zach Collins AND Rodney Hood due to injury (and even Skal got injured too maybe?), and it became abundantly clear that all of our other new forwards were mediocre (Bazemore) to disaster (Hezonja, Tolliver).   Portland was even more injured that season than normal, and was desperate for anyone remotely able to play the 4. Melo fit the bill, and it has worked out pretty well ever since."
"You could fill a datacenter with videos of the amount of times lebron's insane passes did not end in a bucket because he was passing to Jae Crowder, Booby Gibson, Iman Shumpert, Mo Williams, Kay Felder, Sasha Pavlovic, Joel Anthony, Dahntay Jones, Delly (love him, but holy shit could he not shoot sometimes), Mozgov, Chris Andersen, Derrick Williams, Damon Jones, Eddie House, Tristan Thompson, Mario Chalmers, Shannon Brown, James Jones, Kendrick Perkins, Anderson Varejao, Ronny Turiaf, Udonis Haslem, CLE Rodney Hood, CLE Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green when it wasn't his 1 game of the month, Drew Gooden, Michael Beasley, George Hill, Jose Calderon, Donyell Marshall, Eric Snow, Larry Hughes, David Wesley, Lonzo Ball, Larry Nance Jr, KYLE FUCKING KUZMA EVERY DAMN DAY EVEN AS I WRITE THIS, Shane Battier, Richard Jefferson, and DERON FUCKING WILLIAMS"
"He was a 3rd year player then. Also people forget cause he was pretty shit for a good chunk of that series lmao. It was really just a good game 3/4, and then bad outside of that. He was 52% TS% or worse in 5/7 games   Nuggets got up 3-2 and he proceeded to shoot 7-20 and 4-18 in games 6 and 7; big reason why they lost.  That's also ignoring us relentlessly hunting him on the other end. Dude's like single handedly responsible for Rodney Hood going off that series."
"A group of us from Portland where over in Florida for a wedding that weekend. We get home pretty late and drunk as you do from weddings only to go holy shit the blazers are still playing and are in the second overtime. Rodney fucking Hood jogging into the game with fresh legs, like I got this, I'll never forget."
I still remember by the end Rodney Hood with his fresh legs absolutely carried us LOL cuz everyone on both teams were so tired they were missing layups
Next Ernie’s gonna say he learned the c walk like Hayley Williams from Rodney Hood 🚶🏻
"Yeah this is where I was trying to remember how George Hill and Rodney Hood got there but this was it. Jae Crowder also went to Utah, I think, where he immediately played better after being butt for Cleveland lol"
"Lets look at the timeline of events, shall we?  -	Cavs parts ways with David Griffin for….. some reason -	Interviews none other than Chauncey Billups for the GM job -	Kyrie forces his way off of the team. We get the corpse of IT, Jae Crowder and their first round pick (Colin Sexton) -	New GM Koby Autman starts a signing spree of random misfits: Derrick Rose and D. Wade (both on minimum contracts) -	LeBron calls Trump a bum on Twitter -	D. Rose steps away from the team mid season for personal reasons, considers retirement, had a weird report about him in a gym by himself -	Rose came back. Turned out he got married during his absence? -	Lue takes a leave of absence for health issues -	Cavs hold a team meeting. IT and Wade reportedly called out Kevin Love for leaving a game early due to an illness. Turned out that Love had a concussion -	Report comes out mid season that Kyrie threatened to get knee surgery if he wasn’t traded -	Love fractures a bone in his hand in mid January. -	An ESPN article “reveals” that LeBron may consider leaving the Cavs to join the….. Warriors? -	Feb 7: IT pleads the Cavs not to trade him. Says he is tired of being traded -	Feb 8: IT gets traded -	Cavs also trade Wade for basically free and sends Derrick Rose to Minnesota. In return, they received Rodney Hood, Jordan Clarkson, George Hill, LNJ -	JR smith throws a bowl of soup at Damon Jones -	TMZ revealed TT cheated on a Kardashian -	LeBronto sweeps the raptors -	JR Smith loses game 1 with one of the worst plays in NBA history. LeBron had a historic scoring night -	LeBron punches a white board, breaks his hand. Cavs lose the Finals  Yeah, I’d say that was definitely a weird team to say the least"
It’s too late to trade CJ. The time to make that move was last season when they could’ve plugged a bigger Gary Trent Jr into CJ’s spot.  Instead they traded GTJ to get out of Rodney Hood deal.   Now they are basically locked into being a 1st/2nd round exit.
"Lol, spot on. Rodney Hood and Evan Turner torched the Nuggets in 2019."
"Haha I can point to other things Terry got wrong but AG was effective last game going one on one, having to chase Dame a bit more made it a lot harder. Though now that I think about it odds are Lillard made that adjustment himself.  Rivers had himself a Rodney Hood game haha.  Last game I said that it was comforting that we won by so much despite Lillard going off. And so I was optimistic for tonight but it didn't turn out the way I expected. Now I'm looking at the next game like ""it was a tight game and we wouldn't have won without Rivers going off and Portland being cold"".  I think energy might be the decider, this game took a lot of energy for everyone."
I still have nightmares about Rodney mf Hood
This Austin Rivers games is probably what the Rodney Hood game felt like for the nuggets.
Now you know how we felt losing to Rodney Hood and Evan Turner 🤢
Rodney Hood won the series
AUSTIN RIVERS IS THE NUGGETS RODNEY HOOD
"Johnnie Bryant from the New York Knicks  It might be a coincidence that Randle put up an all nba year and RJ jumped in year 2 but it may also have something to do with Bryant; his history speaks for itself. The following players have had their best professional seasons when Johnnie Bryant was on the coaching staff. Gordon Hayward, Rodney Hood, George Hill, Rudy Gobert, Bojan Bogdanovic, Donovan Mitchell(before this year), Julius Randle, RJ Barrett. At some point I think the league takes notice and someone lets him run an entire team."
"Rodney Hood  It's secondary to injury, but he's been the worst player in the NBA to get rotation minutes"
"How about the 2018 Cavs?  &gt; Traded Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat for a 2024 2nd round draft pick. (Pick is heavily protected and not expected to convey.)  &gt; Traded Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas and a 2018 1st round draft pick (Moritz Wagner was later selected) to the Los Angeles Lakers for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr..  &gt; As part of a 3-team trade, the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Jae Crowder, Derrick Rose and a 2024 2nd round draft pick to the Utah Jazz; the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Dimitrios Agravanis, Iman Shumpert, $2.1M cash and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Sacramento Kings; the Sacramento Kings traded Artūras Gudaitis and George Hill to the Cleveland Cavaliers; the Utah Jazz traded Rodney Hood to the Cleveland Cavaliers; and the Utah Jazz traded Joe Johnson and $1.1M cash to the Sacramento Kings. (UTA receives right to exchange 2024 second-round pick with CLE.) (SAC receives MIA 2020 second-round pick from CLE.)  \- Dwayne Wade     \- Channing Frye     \- Isaiah Thomas     \- Jae Crowder     \- Derrick Rose     \- Iman Shmpert     \- Dimitrios Agravanis       \+ Jordan Clarkson     \+ Larry Nance Jr.     \+ George Hill     \+ Rodney Hood     \+ Artūras Gudaitis      It was a weird season."
"Bron saw KD walking with the ball, had flashbacks to 2017 and wanted no parts of that lol. He left Rodney hood to die  Steph setting that screen was an escape route for Bron"
"Yep.  Olshey deserves so much more shit than Stotts.  It shouldn't be surprising that our defense is terrible when you look at our forwards.  We literally only have 2 playable forwards and one of them is Melo.  We gave $10m to Rodney Hood coming off an achilles ffs.    I'm sure there are better coaches out there than Stotts, but I'm not sure who is a better coach that Portland could actually get.  Maybe if Spo wants to come home, but I can't think of another NBA coach that we could slot in that would make a significant immediate improvement."
&gt;Has to be one of the softest players in the league.  You havnt seen KP. A 7'3 Rodney Hood.
"Portland had a lot more issues. Nurkic alone missed 66 games, let alone Rodney Hood tearing his Achilles (and missing half the season), Trevor Ariza missing half the season, Zach Collins missed nearly the entire season, etc  I mean their starting frontcourt for most of the season was Kent Bazemore, Carmelo Anthony, and Hassan Whiteside and they still managed to make the playoffs."
My favorite memory from that night is Rodney Hood (RIP) sprinting onto the court like a labrador puppy
"Boogie is 7 feet tall and heavy, lower leg injuries and loss of mobility on a guy who already can't afford it is a lot different than an off-ball wing like Klay. Klay will definitely be helped by his game being skill-based.   Cousins was already clearly not himself coming off the achilles, whereas KD this year is still dropping 30 a game. Rodney Hood hasn't responded well to his Achilles tear at all, Rudy Gay in his later years recovered well for the Spurs.   Different guys are gonna be effected differently. It would be silly to say 'Klay is definitely going to be 100% the same guy', but it's also kinda silly to say 'Klay is obviously the same as Cousins'."
"man took a punch to the face from ESPN Analyst Kendrick Perkins and was traded for a broken Rodney Hood to your team. if he ain't an all-time Jazz legend at the very LEAST, idk what he is bruh"
Wtf when did we sign Rodney hood
"Cedi Osman, Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood"
"Green has the longest leash in the NBA, If some random player like Rodney hood talked to the refs the way he does, they would lead the NBA in techs"
"eh, I don't know. It seems the same guys tend to get unrelated injury after injury. DeMarcus Cousins, Rodney Hood, Gordon Hayward, Dante Exum and others."
"So the supporting cast severely underachieved in the playoffs. Guys like TT, Jr Smith (lol), George Hill, Rodney Hood, Jeff Green, Kyle Korver, and Larry Nance were/are all super solid. They all were good supporting cast players at that point in their careers and some even after that season."
Weren't Elfrid Payton and Rodney Hood on last year's list too?
Rodney Hood has looked better on paper than the court for a very long time.
Only slightly on topic: I still despise Rodney Hood as a person for that dirty shove behind the play against Jordan Poole.   Absolute biiiiiitch material
RIP Rodney Hood. I really thought he would eventually blossom into a couple time all-star and fringe top 20-30 kind of player.
First part under Rodney Hood.
"I will not stand for this Rodney Hood slander. Guy was playing out of his mind before the Achilles, is a great guy, and was worth the gamble in the contract at the start of the season. It didn’t pan out, and it looked like he was still dealing with things. I only wish him the best."
"Facundo Campazzo, James Wiseman, Rudy Gay, Maxi Kleber, Rodney Hood"
"But the season Dame is referring to for himself was last season, when he had no help.  The guy who many consider our 2nd best player because of his impact on both ends (Nurkic) only played like 8 games last season.  Rodney Hood, our starting SF (who was shooting almost 50% from 3) played in only 21 games before his injury and was then out the rest of the season.  Our starting PF (Zach Collins) played in the first 3 games of the season before getting injured and not coming back until the final games of the season.  Ariza missed the last 22 or so games of the season.  So I don't see how an argument can really be made that Dame had better talent around him last season than Curry did this season. That's just my 2 cents though 🤷‍♂️"
"Not to mention 2019 playoffs Rodney Hood, looked like prime Curry out there at times against us"
"No one respects those dudes enough to be a threat when dribbling and Cov only does it when everything else breaks down.  DJJ is bad   Did Aminu need to go? He was consistently good for us for 4 years. We didn’t need to move Harkless, any replacement level Center who could kind of protect the rim would have been fine   That off season illustrates all of Neils issues though. He went for guys he tried to get like 4 years earlier instead of having a new set of targets  Has he? Nurkic is his best trade and Nurk wasn’t even supposed to be the centrepiece of that trade for us  The Rodney Hood trade was good  Getting Covington was good  I don’t remember any other good trades"
"One team had 5 plus minus 1 all-NBA level players for their title runs, the other had Meyers Leonard and Rodney Hood."
"Joerger is a good coach, but he alienates the front office. When the Grizz didnt draft Rodney Hood, Joerger often would insert his name into press conferences, just being passive aggressive. The FO just got tired of it.  There were also rumors he was pushing for the HC job before it was open, before the team divorced from Lionel Hollins. That has led to allegations of being 2-faced in the workplace. A rep that some media (such as Chris Vernon) seem to have experienced personally, where he smiles at them and is friendly to their face but tries to manipulate/soften their reporting by complaining to their superiors.  I think Joerger would be great in Minnesota, which is where he is from. *If* he can convince management he is putting team agendas ahead of his personal agenda."
"His game reminded me of Rodney Hood at Oregon.  Definitely should have been a second round pick at minimum IMO, but waiting for him to pop in the NBA."
The owner and GM saying they will be a playoff team is an obvious thing to say to sell tickets. But the team after Lebron left was: Sexton/ Hill - JR - Rodney Hood - Kevin Love - TT. If you thought that was a playoff team you're on crack.
"Rodney Hood, Sekou Doumbouya, Chasson Randle, and Aleksej Pokusevski all ranked worse in BPM in more minutes and about a fifth of the league ranked worse than him in RPM (without considering minutes cutoffs etc).   I'm biased because I love the guy but that's not the worst player in the league. He was bad (as a lot of rookies are, even those who go #2 overall) but will definitely improve"
Rodney Hood and 47 is the best I can do
"So what you’re saying is his numbers would be even worse? Dudes like Rodney Hood light it up on shitter teams and then can’t face the bright lights.   Even playing in his prime with Lebron, Love was lackluster. People in this thread really haven’t watched this dude play recently. Looks like an 80 year old running around, bricking threes with zero arc."
"**2022 Raptors**  PG- Jalen Suggs, Malachi Flynn   SG- Fred VanVleet, Gary Trent Jr., David Duke   SF- OG Anunoby, Deandre Bembry, Rodney Hood  PF- Pascal Siakam, Jericho Sims   C- Richuan Holmes, Chris Boucher, Freddie Gillespie"
"&gt;Say Anything, Circa Survive, Bright Eyes, and Cursive  Lol I wish but there's like zero overlap between NBA players and alternative genres.   [Our only hope is Rodney Hood.](https://uproxx.com/dimemag/rodney-hood-childhood-neighbor-hayley-williams-paramore/)"
"Probably run it back with Dame, CJ, and Nurk  Olshey has a thing for keeping “his guys” on the roster for better or for worse.  Watch them sign Rodney Hood too"
I believe so. Portland traded this year's 1st round pick to Houston as part of the Ariza/Covington trade.  And Portland traded this year's 2nd round pick to Cleveland as part of the Rodney Hood trade. (That pick bounced from Cleveland to Detroit to Dallas before ending up with Memphis (for now).)
"""Let me tell you a little story about the 2020 season. I was doing this deal with Houston for Robert Covington, never once touched the salary cap. I'd go to the trade machine, get some Enes Kanter, Derrick Jones Jr, Cup-A-Rodney Hood... baby, I got a stew going."""
"Somewhere, Joerger is still bitching about the Grizzlies not drafting Rodney Hood."
Oh God was that the Rodney Hood trade? Damn we stayed talking Ls that year
"&gt;How did Clarkson, Hood and Crowder play with LeBron? Of yeah those guys suck right?  Yes. Role players especially go up and down dramatically. Crowder wasn't good on the Cavs but he wasn't good on the Jazz and Grizzlies either. Was that Lebron's fault too? Crowder started shooting much better in Miami and now Phoenix. That's just how it goes for role players.  Rodney Hood has always been Rodney Hood don't act like he's good now. He averaged 4 points for Toronto this year. Utah traded him for good reason.  Jordan Clarkson is a good bench player and was good for the Cavs in the regular season. He just got the yips in his first postseason. He's learned and improved."
Rodney Hood and pick 47
George Hill was the second best player and 45 years old Korver was the 3rd best player in playoffs. Rodney Hood was like a solid roleplayer on that team. There is an SNL skit about that team.
"&gt; Also saying role players have no structure with Lebron is just completely wrong. Players in Lebron led teams have defined roles from the moment they’re signed to the roster. Lebron isn’t just calling an iso every play he’s callings actual plays &amp; uses the PnR etc.  This hasn’t been true since he left Miami.  &gt; Role players don’t need to dribble to score, there’s absolutely no reason for Kuzma or KCP to ever initiate the offense when LeBron is on the court.  1) They don’t have to initiate it, they just need to be involved in a more meaningful way. Jeff Green and Rodney Hood don’t need to run the offense but they need the occasional touch and some actions.   2) It would probably help Lebron a lot as he ages if he let the offense work for him more instead of trying to just drive past everybody like he used to. They did it a little with Schroeder this year but I think that’s cause Schroeder is pretty useless off-ball."
" * Coach Nate McMillan leaves for House Hawks and is on the brink of being eliminated from the Eastern Finals.  * House Suns wins the West for the first time since 1993.  * New fevers spread across the west.  The Reggie Jackson fever and the Deandre Ayton fever.  Khwai fever hasn't been cured.  * House pistons win the Lottery.   * The blazers house chapter:   Blazers obtain Norman Powell at the cost of Rodney Hood and Gary Trent Jr.  House Blazers gets eliminated and Coach Stotts gets banished after a long tenure.  Chauncey Billups of house Clippers takes Stotts place as a controversial hire.   Zach Collins reinjured his ankle and is still unable to contribute to the team.  Teams are in belief that Blazers might not be far away from blowing up and are sending messengers.  House Blazers are getting messages from house 76ers, and house Celtics about blowing up the team (Dame, CJ, Norman Powell)."
"rodney hood was amazing for us until his leg blew up, basically lost a 6th man/starting caliber player (at a position of need) for nothing  same with collins, he's extremely useful and basically lost 2 seasons of injuries after being healthy his whole life  seth curry was amazing but we knew he'd only be around for that year, basically signed with us to rehab lol"
"he's great at:  -drafting guards (dame, cj, etc)  -drafting in the 2nd round (crabbe, trent jr, didn't he draft deandre jordan?)  he's good at:   -making small improvement trades (the nurk trade which ended up being a steal, rodney hood)  -min/MLE FA signings (i think? not invested enough to look at past history lol but seth curry/kanter/melo were all great pickups)   he's awful at big FA signings, big trades, and apparently fucking PR, and he's way too loyal to 'his guys' e.g. billups, older players he's drafted (like bringing in old players he's drafted or paying too much to retain players), etc  should have been fired for sure though"
"They've tried building around him, every year. It hasn't worked out, but to act like they didn't try or their moves were horrendous is just hindsight. Nurkic deal was good, RoCo was a win now move hoping to add more defense with what little they had to offer. Rodney Hood was paying off until his achilles injury.  Part of it was LMA wanting out because Lillard got too much attention. They can't really account for that.   If you actually think it was the Dame show I want you to compare Dame and CJ  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mccolcj01/gamelog-playoffs/  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lillada01/gamelog-playoffs/  CJ has had better playoff series than Lillard. The year they went to the WCF Lillard shot 3-17 for 13 points. CJ went 17-29 for 37 points.   CJ wasn't great this year, but he's had some good-great series and plenty of great games. It isn't just Lillard out there on his own and when others don't step up they don't win, but people are acting like Portland has just sat on their hands and done nothing."
"Did they try and tank this season? I thought they were just bad and dealt with a lot of injuries. Trading Norman Powell for Rodney Hood and Trent Jr.  was a weird move, I do agree that is a bit of tanking.   Now they have to overpay for a one-dimensional shooter in Trent Jr. who managed to lose his spot in the rotation at the end of the season or that trade is a disaster. Trent Jr. shot less than 40% for the Raptors 35% from 3, and had a 50% TS. That’s a concern, isn’t it?"
"Trade idea:   Raptors get:   * Jimmy Butler  Heat get:   * De'Aaron Fox  * Marvin Bagley  Kings get:   * OG Anunoby  * Tyler Herro  * Precious Achiuwa  * Rodney Hood (filler)  * 2022, 2024, 2026 Raptors 1sts  * 2024, 2026, 2028 Heat 1sts  Let's say the Raptors draft Suggs. They will have a lot of cap space so let's say they sign John Collins or Richaun Holmes. Then they run something like Suggs/Fred/Butler/Siakam/Collins. That's a good playoff team.   Heat pay up to move on from their aging core to get one of the top young players in the game. Fox is a beast, averaging 25/4/7 last season. Plus they get a reclamation project in Bagley, who still has potential. A Fox/Bam duo could be built around for the next decade.  Kings get a a quality young wing, a promising young point guard, a promising young big man, and six 1sts to continue their rebuild.  They can go forward with Haliburton/Hield/Anunoby/Barnes/???, with Herro/(Ninth Pick)/Precious off the bench. That's a solid young core."
"No one thought Larry Nance Jr. and Rodney Hood were going to be able to help LeBron bring Cleveland to another championship. Some folks didn’t even think they would make it out of the first round. Just stop, I know our Sonics drafted Durant but let it go bro."
2x NBA champ Chris Boucher and Mr. Mississippi Basketball Rodney Hood of course
"Trae has a better supporting cast too! Collins, Capela, KVon, Bogi, Gallo. More threatening than Rodney Hood or whatever"
Would you do Wood and Tate + 24th for the Rodney Hood and 4th pick?
What caused such a massive dip from 18 to 19? Looking at the depth chart was Evan Turner that essential to your defense?  18-19 was obviously the Cinderella WCF run. You all had a frontcourt of Harkless/Aminu who were obviously non-factors on offense but helped cover up the defensive issues of the backcourt.  Ever since then it's been gambling on injury prone players (i.e. Rodney Hood and Zac Collins).
"Raptors lose their leader for Tingus Pingis, right...  Rodney Hood has Josh Richardson 2.0 written all over him, and I don't mean in a good way  What tf do the Pacers do with Kemba?  I'd be fucking amazed if Presti can finesse draft picks out of Kemba while still acquiring Lowry (IMO the superior player atm) in return"
"4 Teamer &amp; Works on Trade Machine:  Raptors:   - Porzingis - Malcolm Brogdon  Mavs:   - Myles Turner  - Rodney Hood  Pacers:  - Kemba Walker - OG Anunoby  OKC:   - Kyle Lowry - Draft Picks (Presti, duh)  Roast me if this is stupid. Thought of this in 2 min. Go Cers."
"Don’t think you can point to one of the most remarkable recoveries ever as an example of the norm. See: Boogie, John Wall, Rodney Hood, etc."
Simmons for Rodney Hood
Not but Masai will give you Rodney Hood for Simmons
Rodney Hood came in fresh in the overtime game against Denver in the 2019 playoffs and his fresh legs were the difference.
Reminds me when the Blazers pulled Rodney Hood off the bench deep into OT when Blazers/Nuggets had that like 4OT game in the 2019 playoffs. Dude had only played like 10 minutes at that point and looked like MJ out there with his fresh legs
That was rodney hood in that 4OT game lmao
"During that quadruple overtime game between Blazers and Nuggets, stotts subbed in a rested Rodney Hood and he went off, scoring a lot of clutch points. Ever since, I always wondered if its really worth it demand so much from your stars after they already played 50 minutes, or rely more on bench players and hope they can provide an extra burst"
How fucking dare you disrespect Rodney Hood like that
"I mean I still think Rodney Hood as a bench piece is better than a 4th center, thats not moves for making moves."
Would you do a TT for Rodney Hood trade?
"The Bucks were offering a much better package to the Cavs and yet these guys took the Celtics offer, still pissed about that.  It was basically anyone but Giannis.  Malcolm Brogdon - highly valued at the time.  Khris Middleton - highly valued too.  Thon Maker - highly valued.  Jabari Parker - highly valued.  Picks - highly valued.  These guys really rejected whatever combination of that for what turned out to be Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood &amp; George Hill (top 10 pick too).   Collin Sexton makes it worth but still, why not take the Bucks package."
Most crazy playoff game for me was the one Rodney Hood did the infamous hop and won the game for the Blazers after quadruple OT.
I think Bucks got better although I have bias. Lost Tucker but added Grayson Allen and George Hill as well as Rodney Hood and Semi Ojeleye. Bench could be better. Add back a healthy Donte Divincenzo and I’m pretty happy.
"Well that’s just wrong lol. Curry, RoCo, as well as guys like Rodney Hood are/were great roleplayers."
9 players barely able to stand. 1 Rodney Hood literally *skipping* onto the court.
2019 WCSF  Game 3  4OT  Rodney fucking Hood
I don’t know if y’all know this but I’ve heard multiple times in this thread that Rodney Hood and that singer from Paramore grew up on the same block!
"Joerger always has issues with the front office. But the dude is a good coach.   I dont know what kind of FO it would take, im surprised someone hasnt figured it out. But maybe he is that toxic.  Rodney Hood. Rodney Hood. Rodney Hood."
"Yes, you’re right.   Also, Rodney Hood is barely an NBA player after his injury. The Achilles rupture is still a tough injury, despite advancements in medicine."
"&gt;  The middle class is what basically has to commit to never being seen as an impact player again once they join LeBron, with his teams always being hyper-focused around his high usage/control. Then when LeBron misses time and there's basically no system in place where those players can thrive it becomes ""wow LeBron really has to do all this on my own doesn't he smh."" Sorry Bosh/Love/Kuzma/Schroder/Harrell/Crowder, your individual value was never as high as immediately before you joined LeBron but uhhh, rings.  I don't think this is totally wrong, but I see some flaws here.   Bosh went from averaging 23/10 (cumulative average over his last 5 Raptors seasons) and losing in the first round or missing the playoffs to averaging 17/7 (cumulative average over 4 years with LeBron while still being a perennial All-Star and making the Finals every year. He would take that trad-off any day. Don't believe me? [Ask him.](https://grantland.com/features/the-career-chris-bosh-miami-heat-third-banana/)  Kuzma was just putting up points on rat teams and was more well-rounded this past season. Schroder was fine, even playing alongside LeBron, he just sucked in the playoffs and that's all anyone remembers. Harrell's issues were more defensive than anything so it doesn't really apply here.  I'd say George Hill and Rodney Hood are examples of guys who looked like worthless tin cans next to LeBron but have been useful role players elsewhere.  I've often thought LeBron was very similar to Peyton Manning in many regards, including the fact that their teams were often so heavily built around them that while they could paper over those teams' flaws, the team would often fall apart in their absence.   &gt;Gruden once asked Tom Moore why Peyton's backups didn't get more reps: 'Fellas, if 18 goes down we're fucked, and we don't practice fucked.'"
"My favorite version of this was when Hayley Williams from the band Paramore said her childhood neighbor Rodney taught her to crip walk, and it turned out to be Rodney Hood."
We'll probably get punished again for the Rodney Hood signing woj announced early.
"Best I can do is a Rodney Hood, Elijah Bryant, and some cash."
"Thanks I hate it 🙃 this game made me hate Rodney Hood, in a respectful way"
"This is one of my favorite games ever, does anyone have the clip of Rodney Hood galloping off the bench when he gets subbed in? Dude looked so happy and just demolishes the game immediately too."
"Rodney Hood was so amazing for us before his Achilles injury. Obviously this game and series were fantastic, but he was shooting something like 50% from 3 for the first 20-30 games of the next season before he tore his Achilles. And his one-dribble midrange pullup is even better, I'd be surprised if he ever missed. If he can even recover halfway to his pre-injury self, Bucks got a good one"
"not to hate on the bucks or anything, but they're getting a lot of love in this thread for having just won, but they lost pj tucker and bryn forbes and they added semi ojeleye and rodney hood...  meanwhile miami added tucker, lowry, and one of the psycho twins, as well as a bunch of people i don't know  the bulls added caruso, lonzo, and demar to lavine and vucevich.   the sixers added dru- never mind.  the wizards have got dinwiddie, kuzma, kcp, and harrell and they still have beal and rui.   the knicks added kemba to their hospital guard rotation too.  the celtics added back horford, shed their weakness in kemba, added kanter, and are still in the market for a few moves.   now i don't know that all of these teams will click, but these aren't weak teams, and that makes the east just that little bit harder to roll through in the playoffs, and brooklyn is still around with their big 4 or 6 or whatever they're up to now.  and since there's only 3 contenders to list, i think brooklyn has to be the one in the east, because they're the only team that is capable of beating every other team in a best of 7, even when unhealthy (see: bucks series).  but then someone will ask why i only give 1 to the east - i don't think the lakers will come out of the west guaranteed. the clippers still exist, the jazz and suns are largely unchanged with some small additions, the warriors have klay coming back mid-season hopefully, and portland's going to have a lot to prove to keep dame around.   there's also some of those smaller markets to consider who could trip up the big teams at vital moments and influence the seeding by stealing wins, even if they're not contenders. NOLA is making moves, though we're yet to see what comes of that now they've missed lowry and paul. minnesota has KAT, dlo, and anthony edwards, and i don't rate them, but people seem to have some hope they might all be healthy and ball out. i'm interested in memphis and what they'll do with ja running around adams, and there's always some fun to be had watching OKC do their thing.   lastly there's the kings, but i don't think we have to worry about them bothering anyone, so i didn't even really need to include them did i.  tldr: east - nets; west - pick two of lakers, warriors, clippers, suns, jazz.   ps. people will also say the suns had lucky injury influenced runs. i say don't count out a team full of young guys who ran to the finals on their first every playoff run. they'll believe they can do it again and i fully expect them to be a top 4 seed"
"It was, and as a Blazer fan, we're glad to have it. But it's a painful move to make.  This is a year where we desperately have needed to make big move and changes to our team, but we're already spending $95M of our salary on *four players*, $110M on five this year now that we've signed this deal. And the people making all that cash really are some of our best players, so trading them really isn't a top focus right now.  And if we didn't sign Norm to this new contract, it would mean that we traded off Rodney Hood and Gary Trent Jr. for &lt;6 months of Powell, which did not get us any further than the first round. Basically, we had to sign Norm to whatever contract he wanted, or the whole trade to bring him in would have been completely wasted, but at the same time... doing so pretty much kills our ability to make any other big moves.  He's def getting a good deal and I'm glad to have him, but there's no denying he's pretty much getting the deal we were forced to give him."
Melo should be thanking Zac Collins and Rodney Hood for being injured that Portland had to resort to calling him
"Rodney Hood, Prince of Threes"
"Yeah it was epic. Jokic played 65 out of 68 minutes in the game, which is an NBA record that might never be broken.  CJ was clutch as hell (clutch but not particularly efficient dude scored 41 points on 39 shots LOL), playing 60 minutes, with Dame just behind with 58 minutes. One day before he started fasting for Ramadan, Enes Kanter playing with a separated shoulder toughed out 56 minutes. Meanwhile Murry and Gary Harris played 55 and 50 minutes.  By 4OT, Portland's Moe Harkless cramped up after only playing 45 minutes, forcing Terry Stotts to sub in Rodney Hood who had played a mere 20 minutes in the game. Rodney literally galloped onto the court he was so fresh, and scored 7 points in a row for the Blazers to ice the win."

Damn poor Rodney hood
Rodney Hood sucks and yet somehow every time he is traded or signed people in these threads act like he’s good. Am I missing something? He was straight up garbage on the Cavs and hasn’t really seemed to improve since then.
Desmond from RDC be looking like Rodney Hood
Just two years ago Hood dropped 26 on the nuggets and forced us into a game 7 with Portland which we would ultimately lose. I'll never hear the name Rodney Hood and not get flashbacks from that game
Never forget Rodney Hood skipping onto the floor in 4OT of Game 3 to put the game away
"No, not at all. Woj said   &gt;Free agent F Rodney Hood has agreed to a one-year deal with the Milwaukee Bucks, agents Ty Sullivan, Austin Brown and Aaron Mintz of @CAA_Basketball tell ESPN. Another perimeter shooter for the Bucks in pursuit of defending their title.   Announcing they've agreed to a deal before the player is even waived, seems like it would set off a red flag.  idfc either way just seems like a dangerous move."
Why do I keep getting Rodney Hood and Alec Burk mixed up
Rodney Hood was ass last year
Rodney hood might suck but he's talented enough that he can swing a series. He's the homeless man's version of Jeff Green who's the poor man's version of Trevor Ariza
Looks like y'all just signed Rodney Hood to fill in that role though
Raptors legend Rodney Hood
"2019 Cavs had Sexton, Cedi Osman, Rodney Hood, and Kevin Love."
"I think you're overrating how much 9 a season is... Even if you don't think Caruso is very good, he's still probably worth 9  Tristan Thompson, Jeremy Lamb, Maxi Kleber, Rodney Hood. I clicked through a bunch of teams rosters and excluding rookie deals these are the guys making 9-10 million. 9 million is not every day starter money"
Rodney Hood or Baynes non-guaranteed deals coming right up 👉
That's the point. We're offering some other team cap room because they can just not guarantee his deal. Same thing with Rodney Hood.  We'd be happy just getting some 2nds probably
"Unironically it would be an improvement.  We haven't had a starter-quality SF since... Batum.  After him it was Harkless, a few games of Rodney Hood before he got hurt, making Bazemore play the 3, old ass Ariza for a few games, I think we started Melo at the 3 in the bubble, Derrick Jones Jr., then Powell.  Powell is a good player, but he isn't a small forward.  Just an all-round clusterfuck."
"I mean, is it? Hood's shooting efficiency dipped by like 5% all around and he relies much more on an off-the-dribble game than Klay. You think Klay Thompson, a consensus top 5 shooter in history is suddenly gonna be a 35% shooter from 3? Klay is most likely gonna get a 13 month timeline, which only Wall and KD has ever really gotten and is gonna be on serious minutes restrictions for the first month or so.  And as unfortunate as it is, [Hood had to taken out of the game before because his Achilles was sore and he wasn't sure if he would be able to play.](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/portland-trail-blazers/update-rodney-hood-has-torn-left-achilles-tendon) He tried to play and he tore his Achilles the very next game. That was a more serious red light for a potential injury than even usual Achilles injuries.   Klay at least has a little bit of optimism because he tore his Achilles on his non-dominant (right) leg, the same one as KD and Dominique Wilkins, examples of two of the most successful Achilles injury recoveries in the NBA. Now I'm not implying that Klay is gonna come back 100%, but Rodney Hood's injury was probably more serious than even the majority of Achilles injuries. That's not really a great comparison imo."
I think anyone expecting Klay to look good after 2 seasons off + a devastating injury in each leg is throwing him under the bus.  I think Rodney Hood is a good example of Klay's comeback.
"Rodney hood and jr outscored Steph Klay and stay in game 3 so far as I'm concerned KD SWEPT LeBron. Being an all-star is pretty amazing which love was that year as well as the year before, and it is an accomplishment sweeping the highest paid team in nba history as the finals MVP, only KD can say that. You calling dray and Klay stars? Ok casual. He joined a losing team that begged him while being the highest paid player there, would've been a moron if he didn't join gsw. Easily would've ran the league with the spurs but people would say instead of dray Klay and Steph they'd cry LMA TD manu tp Kawhi and goat coach so absolutely right move by KD.   Again I can tell you're a casual bc of the 2007 run, it was almost like the suns run this year every team they played missed a key player(except for round 1 for the Lakers since AD only missed one game) so yeah LeBron lucked his way into the finals only to get SWEPT and had an all-time embarrassing performance because he had to play a real team that wasn't injured, there's a reason why he never went back to finals and had to join Wade's team.   As for 2018 he had allstar love and the highest paid team in nba History, and still embarrassingly got taken to 7 by oladipo+scrubs and rookie Tatum, IN HIS PRIME. While KD with a torn Achilles was giving it to the bucks led by the 2x MVP and DPOY all by himself all while teammates were literally selling him. There are levels to this.   LeBron couldn't even carry his team to the western playoffs. Throwing everything he did in the east straight to the trash proving critics he couldn't do what he did in the east in the west."
"The supposed Kevin love beef came from one reporter, and wasn’t supported by love https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-heat/fl-sp-heat-all-star-notes-20180217-story.html  With the additions of Rodney hood and Clarkson, they just didn’t have a role for wade anymore. The cavs really struggled in the season, so they needed some young 30+ mpg guys that could shoot 3s."
"Probably Tim Hardaway Jr, Jakob Poetl, Rodney Hood, and Mike Muscala."
"Not necessarily. A healthy Nurkic and Collins plus a bigger wing like Rodney Hood will allow you to hide Dame and CJ on defense. Unfortunately due to injury we had to pair them with Kanter and Melo for long stretches.  I'm not sure if a fully healthy and integrated RoCo and Nurkic can cover up with 3 small guards. That's why all the scuttlebutt about trading for Ben Simmons, because Simmons/RoCo/Nurkic will be able to cover defensively for just about any guard lineup, and Norm would actually do okay guarding an opposing guard, so if you just swapped out CJ for Ben Simmons it would be a better balanced lineup even with Simmons' offensive woes."
Shame he couldn't be teammates with Rodney Hood and George Lynch on the Wizards.
"I know it's a popular refrain, but who exactly does LeBron make better? Here are a few examples,   George Hill was traded to the Cavs as part of a last ditch attempt to recalibrate a dysfunctional Cavs team. The movement in his efficiency was as follows: -2.5/-10 FG/3PT% and this was on effectively the same FGA/3PTA  Kyle Kuzma effectively peaked efficiency wise in his rookie year, when LeBron wasn't even on the team, and proceeded to get worse the following years.  Starting: 45/36.6 FG/3PT% and averaging: -1/-4 FG/3PT%. This is in spite of Kuzma being a 2nd year player when LeBron joined his team - you'd expect him to get better not worse.   Rodney hood: +2.5/-3.7 FG/3PT%. Worth noting also that his offensive production dipped significantly, by over 6 points, with that in mind it appears to be a decline to me.   These are a few examples and I could go on, but Lebron's teammates almost always declined relative to expectations when playing next to him as noted here by ESPN   (https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23684417/kevin-pelton-weekly-mailbag-does-lebron-james-make-teammates-better)   My view: LeBron plays a very unique style of basketball where he has to have the ball in his hands the entire time and dump the ball off to his teammates when **he** seems necessary.  Consequently, playing with LeBron is tough because it involves a lot of ball watching. Players get cold playing with him and thus do not benefit much from the catch &amp; shoot 3s that he generates as they can't catch a rhythm.   The players that DO benefit from this are players who don't need the ball to be effective. That is why players like JR and Larry Nance played much better than expected with LeBron, because their game just requires they get an open look or an alley oop.  This is why Westbrook likely won't work with LeBron. Neither know how to play off ball, and Westbrook is a horrific catch and shoot player, so he doesn't benefit from what LeBron does best."
"the raptors do not have a history of strong drafting. Just looking at lottery picks we have  3 in 2003: Chris Bosh. Great pick, made the raptors relevant and undoubtedly go the ball rolling for the current success they have now.  4 in 2004: Rafael Araujo. Bust. Andre Igoudala was the very next pick.  7 in 2005: Charlie Villanueva, hard to call him a bust, but he certainly was never more than an OK starter. Danny Granger was on the board and would've been better.   1 in 2006: Andrea Bargnani. Holy shit was Bargnani bad. player 7 years but but only average 15/ppg with awful rebounding and defence for a big man. LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay and Brandon Roy were right there.   17 in 2008: Not a lottery pick but we took Roy Hibbert and flipped him for Jermaine O'Neal who barely lasted a season and traded to Miami for Marion and Moon who did nothing.   9 in 2009: DeMar Derozan. ok, a good pick, no fault here and this pick basically one the NBA Final so kudos.   12 in 2010: Ed Davis. not a great pick, never really cracked 10ppg and ended up being traded for Rudy Gay. Could've picked Patrick Patterson who was a nice piece for the Raptors later on.   5 in 2011: Valanciunas was not a bad pick, he developed in a good player, but we could've taken Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, or Kemba Walker or Jimmy Butler.   8 in 2012: Terrence Ross. dude had some highlight reel plays but wasn't ever a world beater. Andre Drummond was the next pick and although taking him with Jonas wouldn't have been the right move, it is pretty obvious who the better player is.   12 in 2013: Traded for Lowry. great trade and in a terrible draft class it made sense. We could've taken Giannis, but no fault Lowry is an all-time Raptor.   HM to 2014 and 2015 and #20s Bruno Caboclo and Delon Wright, a developmental player who never developed. Could've taken Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, or Bogdanovic. Wright was picked over Bobby Portis and Montrezl Harrell.  We've blown 5 (arguably 6 or 7) of the 9 lottery picks we've had, 2 pretty spectacularly. Although the last few years have been good, historically when we draft top 5, we don't draft well."
"Believe our first round pick went to Houston as part of the Covington deal, second round pick was traded to Cleveland along with Stauskas and Baldwin for Rodney Hood."
Rodney Hood basically did this once on the Cavs and of course he got absolutely destroyed for it
A short-term extension may have been agreed to like for our guarantee date being changed for Rodney Hood.
"no doubt, he a monster. But kinda says something that the comeback in that game was sparked by Rodney Hood guarding him down the stretch and forcing him to pass up the rock. Jones was not effective for us."
Wiggins and picks for Siakim and Rodney Hood. Wiggins becomes full Maple Jordan.
"It's interesting to note that the deepest run that Dame and CJ have made in the past few years have been with an Aminu/Harkless frontcourt; basically non-starters offensively but they played defense hard enough to cover up Dame and CJ.  Iirc, Harkless got traded with Meyers Leonard to Miami for a one-year rental of Hassan Whiteside to hold the rim down while Nurkic was out for the season. They also wanted to replace both Harkless and Aminu with guys who had a bit more of a bunch offensively in Rodney Hood and Zac Collins. Unfortunately both of those guys got injured and became shells of themselves."
Achilles injuries are pretty rare so I don’t think there’s a standard. There have been [only 44 players](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29303707/how-torn-achilles-global-pandemic-began-prepare-rodney-hood-life-basketball%3fplatform=amp) that have ever torn their Achilles and nique is the only one who came back as good really.
"The fun part of being a Heat fan is that there always seems to be hope for a win.  I do believe that you need at least 2 top 5 players to compete for a championship.   Miami imo has Butler and Bam  Jimmy to me is a top 5 SF in the league right now - He is great at getting to the free-throw line and then hitting those FT's. Also I mean he is one of the best in game stealers. Just love the hustle.   Bam is a top 5 center -- I think he is 5 behind - Jokic, Embiid KAT, and Rudy. Double double machine and so athletic.    Now clearly there are better duo's out there.   Lebron and Davis Durant, Kyrie and Harden (This is not even fair) Giannis and Rodney Hood etc  And ofcourse two borderline top 5's are not going to get the job done against more talented teams. But there is no doubt they will make it really interesting.   Further, we got a nice deep team - some young talent to be excited about. An injured player who might come and play at a high level. So a lot of upsides.  Do we have a realistic chance -- probably not, but damn you don't want to sleep on this team. They might surprise someone."
"I think, Bucks also improved considering that they acquired numerous role players to rely on (Hill, Grayson Allen, Rodney Hood) for a title repeat. The absence of PJ in terms of switchability might sting a bit, but I think they are optimistic on Ojeleye's growth  Yeah they might lose on any top 10 team, but it is what it is. They are the reigning NBA champions, and their morale is sky high entering this upcoming season"
Quadruple OT Blazers/Nuggets game from the playoffs in.....2019 I think? The one where Jokic had an amazing game and the Blazers got bailed out by Rodney Hood coming in and sinking several daggers in row.
"It sucks losing pj but Grayson Allen is good DiVincenzo insurance, George Hill is a solid backup pg, and if Rodney Hood can return to form theyre gonna be in pretty good shape"
"I mean, they surely tried to negotiate. But Tobias and his people knew they had them over a barrel. Negotiations probably didn’t go much further than Tobias’ agent saying “yea, either pay us the max or try winning next year with Rodney Hood.”   (Not sure if Rodney Hood was even available that year, but that’s more or less who they could’ve afforded to replace Tobias with had they not paid him.)"
"Their 18/19 top 5 minutes getters were Cedi Osman, Collin Sexton, Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, and Rodney Hood  Only Hood was even close to being a returning starter"
"Your logic is just simply amazing my guy  KEVIN LOVE ALL STAR YAY, JR SMITH posts percentage, old ass Kyle Korver, fucking Rodney Hood  You just proved why it was such a big deal, go look at the stats of those players in the playoffs"
George Hill &amp; Rodney Hood were really the only 2 that were starter quality/level players before Cleveland. The rest of the team still needed to come into there own and that doesn’t change the fact that they were pretty bad with Cleveland.  If we’re going with those guys during there tenure with the cavs that’s not a good supporting cast but if it’s the best version of them then obviously they’re gonna be good.   Blake is a stretch 4 with the Nets but you can just say oh yeah he was the best player for the pistons. Really depends on the role with that team.
"it's called not being prisoner of the moment  they were always good players, they just didn't have time to get acclimated to the system  george hill has been a solid guard in the league for years  larry nance been a promising young lob threat  rodney hood was balling in utah, what you forgot?  jeff green was good even in cleveland  clarkson didn't become this nice until recently, but he was still a microwave guy off the bench as a laker  only lebron apologists shit on his 2018 supporting cast to big him up  they shouldn't have blew the rose/wade core up in the first place though"
It’s only because all those guys at the time sucked ass and now they’re all quality role players.  George Hill with the Bucks helped take them to the ECF being a top 4 player for them.  Larry Nance became really good afterwards.  Rodney Hood on the Trail Blazers was amazing.  Jeff Green turned out to be a really high quality rotation guy.   Clarkson became a 6th man.   At the time they were all playing like ass. Pretty sure Clarkson was statistically like the worst finals performer ever.
"Okay, what's Joel's excuse for losing to the Blazers last year when Dame, CJ, DJJ, Nurkic, (and Collins if you wanna count him) were all out with injury?  Our starting lineup was Gary Trent Jr., Rodney Hood, Robert Covington, Carmelo Anthony, and Enes Kanter.  Our bench was Simons, CJ Elleby, and Harry Giles.  And Joel Embiid lost.  Can you just accept that single game results are just that, single games?  Nearly anything can happen on a daily basis, and you should not come in here and belittle or gatekeep it."
"He hasn't. In fact, he switched off of KD to let Rodney Hood of all people guard him in crunch time lol"
Rodney Hood that bastard
"Starters   PG Jrue   SG Grayson Allen  SF Middleton  PF Giannis   C BroLo   6th Bobby Portis   7th Divincenzo   8th Pat Connaughton   9th George Hill   10th Semi/Rodney Hood/Nwora  Situational Thanasis   Benchwarmers Mamu, Giorgos K  My thinking on Allen over Donte is offensive consistency and availability at the start of the year."
"Lots.  Derrick Rose. He was setting up to be a huge rival for my Cavs but after the injury and his short time playing for us I can’t help but root for him.  Jordan Clarkson. I was just an overall angry person in 2018-19. Watching the Cavs wasnt any fun, and when JORDAN CLARKSON and RODNEY HOOD are your 1 &amp; 2 options, it’s gonna make you a pessimist. I gave him a lot of shit but I’m glad he became an important player on a contender. He deserves it"
"&gt;Also +- is a garbage stat and especially in this context because Toronto was a terrible team last season, a lot of players on the team will have a +- in the negatives  Rodney Hood only played 29% of his total minutes in Toronto and he litterally had a better +- in Toronto (-5.4) than he did in Portland (-7.6) lol"
"&gt; Georgie Hill and Rodney Hood would be ""elite contributes"" if they signed to Brooklyn for example  I know what you're saying but they'd have to be some kind of stupid to actually think that. Hill was completely useless for the sixers last season and as someone said below, Hood was even worse."
"Can you not read? I said they'd be considered elite contributers on the Lakers and Nets due to the bandwagon hypebeast those teams have. Millsap wasn't good either and as you can see, people are pretending he is because he's a Net. Same would've happened with Rodney Hood."
"Rodney Hood was coming off an Achilles tear, a down year isn't shocking. If he doesn't pan out, we have Nwora who I think should get more minutes anyways. Also +- is a garbage stat and especially in this context because Toronto was a terrible team last season, a lot of players on the team will have a +- in the negatives.   As for our signings being worse, We didn't sign a bunch of players to begin with. Whereas Nets and Lakers have to scramble to get new 1 year vet minimum guys. I still take our supporting cast over both the Nets and Lakers, their Big 3s is what saves them."
"Rodney Hood was litterally one of the 3 worst players in the league last year including G Leaguers. ESPN's RPM metric suggests he has a -4.55 impact per 100 possessions, which ranks # 533 of 534 eligible players. Box plus/minus is even harsher, suggesting he's been a -7.1.  George Hill is not as awful as Hood but like I said 80% of the Lakers and Nets signings are better than both"
"They're overhyped signings based on the fact that they're on the Lakers and Nets. Georgie Hill and Rodney Hood would be ""elite contributes"" if they signed to Brooklyn for example. Just large market bias kicking in.  We don't have a bunch of pre teen Bandwagons to hype up our every move. Big deal."
80% of the Lakers and Nets signings are better than George Hill and Rodney Hood lol
I’ll be honest I thought that part of the problem with that 2018 team was Ty Lue not coaching up the younger dudes (Rodney Hood Clarkson etc) and the team should have been better. I’ll admit I was wrong and he was not the problem there.
"I'd say Cleveland as well. We've traded the following players one way or another:      Rodney Hood, Jae Crowder, George Hill, Dante Exum, Kyle Korver, Alec Burks and best of all Jordan Clarkson."
You have a PJ Tucker at home. His name is... Grayson Allan or Rodney Hood. Pick one.
"Lmfao there's probably not a single Finals team in the last 30 years that loses to a team with Rodney Hood as the #2 guy. Lebron missed the playoffs altogether with Ingram, Lonzo, Kuzma, KCP, Caruso, Bullock, Javale, etc. I realize Bron missed time that season, but that team is better than the ass cheeks lineup you listed, and they weren't winning the finals even if Bron played every game of the season. Your team is an immediate first round exit if they even make the playoffs"
"Personally, I think he could get it done if you swap Rodney Hood for last season’s Reggie Bullock and Frank Kaminsky for Zubac"
"The 2018 Cavs wouldn't have beaten the Suns, or the 2018/2019 Rockets or any title worthy team. They went 7 against 2 meh teams   And no, Bron is good, but he's not beating ANY elite West team in the finals with Rodney Hood as his second best player and Frank Kaminsky as his rim protector.  &amp;#x200B;  But congrats you may have found the answer to another question : how bad of a supporting cast would you have to create for Prime Lebron to not win a playoff round ?"
Here's another one: Rodney Hood getting swept by the Warriors 3 years in a row with each year being on a different team.
"Bucks did pretty aight. Lost PJ Tucker but honestly kinda feels like he gave the last of his high level defense in the championship run. Love him either way.  We got what we needed, which was a backup PG whose name wasn't Jeff Teague, and who else could we have gotten other than George Hill, who shot like 40% from 3 back in the 2020 season. Hopefully he isn't washed yet but still a good signing.   Also seems like we got some Donte Insurance in case he gets hurt again in Grayson Allen. In fact it should be interesting to see if the Bucks have to decide between Donte and Grayson, if both have really good seasons.   Rodney Hood is also a low risk high reward guy if he can return to his Portland form off his Achilles injury. Coming into a team and city that just won a title should be a positive environment, and hopefully the training staff can help him get back into the best shape possible.   And of course resigning Bobby was huge. I imagine one of the reasons we let PJ go was so we still had money to give Bobby a better contract next summer"
"I don't know if it's apparent from just the link, but the play OP posted for this thread is the play that the article is talking about. Unless I'm missing it somewhere, the article doesn't show the actual play, and the connection isn't crystal clear in the comments here.  &gt;As Curry approaches, if Livingston stands still at the top corner of the key, a single Portland player can defend them both. By cutting to the basket, by making himself a threat to score, Livingston has both forced the defense to choose and elevated the scoring opportunity from good to beyond great (a 90.9% scoring probability, to be exact, per Second Spectrum).  &gt;But when the pass bounces off his [Rodney Hood's] hands, an alert Curry, his momentum carrying him toward the left corner of the court, is able to reach out with his right hand and tip the ball back to himself.  &gt;Using the sideline and baseline as a trap, Hood wants to position himself in a way that prevents Curry from getting back to the middle of the court, where all the options are. But merely by raising his eyes to the basket and hinting he might launch a 3, Curry gets Hood off-balance and overcommitted enough to create an escape route out of the corner.  &gt;Now, as Curry relaxes, the tension leaves Lillard's body. Initially, Lillard had his eyes locked on Curry and his left arm extended to block the baseline. But the second Curry stands up, Lillard's head turns and his eyes instinctively drift to the ball as Evans begins to drive down the right side of the key. Lillard doesn't see Curry's body coil like a spring. Curry's famous shooting mechanics are a marvel of clean kinetic efficiency. But so is his footwork -- which often goes overlooked.  &gt;Before making his next cut, this time Curry makes eye contact with Livingston, someone who arrived in Golden State in 2014 along with Kerr. Seeing how far Lillard is behind Curry and knowing the Blazers are likely to switch defenders to close the gap on a shooter at the wing, Livingston instinctually steps to the elbow and screens his own man, preventing the defensive switch and forcing an already exhausted Lillard to chase Curry all the way out to the perimeter."
I remember being at my cousins house and turning the game on in the 3rd quarter. A couple of us were watching and were like aye it’s almost over let’s watch this real quick. Game then went into four overtime’s lmao it was so crazy. One of my favorite playoff games ever. Also shout out to Rodney hood the Utah jazz miss you big dog
"Be respectful of what this dude has given to us before you start shit-talking a man who was a pivotal piece in the best basketball years of our lives. A dude who stuck around when Bron left, didn't that feel good when you felt like everything was falling apart? This is not the person with whom your ire belongs.  Blame the dude who signed him to an absurd deal and didn't have a plan for him after 6 games. Four coaches in four years. Four picks for KPJ. Couldn't trade Drummond. Couldn't trade JR's contract. Kyrie for Isaiah Thomas. Derrick Rose for Rodney Hood. Larry for Lauri. No incoming firsts, no cap flexibility, no hope this season. He's the guy who plainly sucks.  We've got to move on from Love, but not nearly as much as we've got to move on from Altman."
"I remember that game, Rodney Hood came in galloping like Nick Briz and scored like 8 clutch points lol"
But what exactly were you expecting they'd get from trading those pieces ? You're acting like they picked Rodney Hood over KD or some shit.
"I think bucks will be back to their 2020 level of depth when donte is back that let them wreck the regular season.   Hill, Donte, Bobby, Pat, Semi (Maybe Rodney Hood??) off the bench is 10x as good as Teague, pj, Bobby, Forbes"
"i think that's probably true, but they definitely didn't think Hood was a starting caliber 2 after that playoffs.  small sample size and first playoffs etc., but the advanced stats for him are really funny.   he had a 43.4 TS% and a bpm of -6.1 that playoffs.  so basically think of how good james harden was for Brooklyn this season and rodney hood was more impactful except on the negative side lol."
"This isn't entirely true; Mitchell didn't have the green light from the start at all. There was a Ringer article that talked about how bad the Jazz offense was because Ricky Rubio was leading the team in points. Mitchell eventually surpassed him but it took a chunk of the season.  Remember, Mitchell wasn't even supposed to start when he got to the team; he only started in the season opener because Rodney Hood had nervous bowel syndrome."
Rodney Hood and CJ is what I remember.
Malik Monk - Monk   Marcus Smart - smart  Jrue Holiday - Holiday (mardigra)  Rodney Hood - Hood
The firsts became Rodney Hood and Josh Hart. Decent role players for their draft positions but nothing more.
"Anybody in the league that is annoying af like this for genuine reasons related to basketball is always someone you hate on other teams, but would absolutely love them on yours. For me it’s guys like Norman Powell, Jae Crowder, Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood, Derrick White, Joe Ingles, Marcus Morris, etc… fuck all those dudes, until they join my squad, then they’re my dudes lol. I realize Jamal Murray is a guy like this for people outside of Denver lol."
"There were a few better options around where Bruno got picked. Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, Bogdan Bogdanovic, and Kyle Anderson were all late first round picks in 2014 too, and then there was Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Jerami Grant, Jokic, Dwight Powell, and Jordan Clarkson in the second round. Obviously some of those picks are excusable because of how little hype they had, but still."
"The 2018 Cavs had ancient DWade, pre-career revival DRose, Isaiah Thomas after his play fell off a cliff, Iman Shumpert, and Jae Crowder and turned that into Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood, and George Hill."
"Ooh gotcha.  Shades of Rodney Hood suddenly having to shit at tip off giving Donovan the start in the first game of his rookie season.  I'm enjoying her alongside Boler so far, pleasant change of pace."
"Heat fans celebrating like they won the chip after beating the Bucks in a regular season game without Jrue Holiday, Brook Lopez, Donte, Bobby Portis, Semi, and Rodney Hood 😭😭"
"Or Rodney Hood, or Semi Ojeyele. I don’t think I spelled that right, but I’ll get it one day."
Or new addition Rodney hood
Nwora played his way into the rotation. Rodney Hood probably won't get minutes tbh
Rodney Hood isn't very good and neither is Thanasis so I'd say 11 deep probably.
"Deeper than that even. They were 9 deep tonight without Donte, Bobby, Rodney Hood and Semi Ojeleye"
didnt know rodney hood was on the bucks
"Man this made me curious as to just how bad this is. My first shot was to go back to 2014.  They picked Jordan Adams 22nd. Rodney Hood and Clint Capela went in the next three picks. Ouch.   In 2015, the Grizzlies selected Jarell Martin 25th. Two picks later Larry Nance Jr. goes. Wow would this have changed history.   2016 is tough, hard to know who they would've taken at the time but Wade Baldwin at 17 surely was not the answer. Two of the next three picks...Malik Beasley and Caris LeVert.   2017 didn't select anybody.  2018 JJJ! A hit! Sure they could have had Trae Young, but I think they are happy with what they have in Ja and JJJ."
De’Aron Fox: Is fast and cunning on the court like a fox   Josh Hart: has a lot of heart on defence   Rodney Hood: came from the hood  James Johnson: has a big johnson   Kendrick Nunn: is religious   Derrick Rose: Rose up several times when being down with injuries   Jay Scrubb: is a scrub / relatively unknown player in the NBA   Colin Sexton: has a ton of sex  Justice Winslow: Has never broken the law/his teams total wins are low when he plays for them

" &gt;Should the Wolves have taken jokic over KAT?  FYI Jokic was a rookie the same year as KAT but he was selected the draft before. I also think that there's a lot of difference between people criticizing a team selecting a lotto prospect over another lotto prospect vs trying to compare a 2nd rounder everyone passed on once and was an exception to a lotto pick. Like in hindsight some people might be like hey raps chose Caboclo over Jokic in 2014, but I think people do more to criticize around the same draft range like raps not taking Capella or Rodney Hood at the pick because both were within a few picks of Bruno"
"Mamu, Waters, whichever of Robinson (assuming he stays on the two-way spot), Kalaitzakis, even Rodney Hood if Hood is still the 2020-21 version of himself.  It's not even to disrespect those players, it's just Thanasis really isn't as bad as people think. He just has to be compared to other 8-11th men instead of that thing where people compare a player who has five minutes a game to starters. The fouling gets meme'd but it's part of his role and his defense is otherwise pretty solid, he can finish at the rim, cuts well and picks up offensive rebounds extremely well (*extremely* well for his minutes)."
Kalaitzakis is on a guaranteed deal and he’s a raw forward who just came from the Euroleague. I genuinely believe that Thanasis will contribute more than Semi Ojeleye and Rodney Hood (who is washed). Thanasis is actually a good bench piece.
"I hate to break it to you, and no disrespect at all intended, but no one outside of Milwaukee cares about Jordan Nwora or George Hill or Rodney Hood"
"They actually changed quite a bit, their depth is almost completely different. Brought in role players to fill gaps, like Grayson Allen, George Hill, Rodney Hood, Semi Ojeleye, and a new rook 'Mamu', and Jordan Nwora will probably get more time this year after looking really strong in the Olympics. Not earth shattering moves but quite a bit of roster change"
"Man if he could solidify himself as the third scoring option for the Bucks they would be wild. I know Per 36s are fucked but he put up 22.5/8/1/2/1 last year on 46/45(!)/76.  A starting lineup of Jrue, Donte, Khris, Giannis, and Lopez with a bench unit of George Hill, Grayson Allen, Nwora, Thanasis, Rodney Hood, Bobby Portis, Pat Connaughton, and the rest of the guys could be pretty wild. Crazy strong secondary, not to mention a crazy *crazy* secondary."
Me and my brother seen Rodney Hood in Thousand Oaks once.
"Denzel Valnetine, Rodney Hood"
"Allen, re-signed Portis, Nworas been doing very good, Rodney Hood(I think is coming back from an injury so we will see) Semi Ojeleye and might be more I can’t remember off the top of my head. Oh and Donte should be back.   May not sound like much but it’s not uncommon for people to come here and look noticeably better than they did on previous teams (Portis for example).   Plus Khris and Jrue could always shoot better next time we face them, that was our issue when Kyrie went down. Aside from game 6, Middleton and Jrue were pretty bad offensively that series."
I will always remember this as the game Rodney Hood came in skipping then turned into Jordan
"Yes, his defense will determine how many though. I'll be pretty upset honestly if we play like Rodney Hood over him. We need a perimeter shot creator for when Middleton sits and Nwora can definitely fill that role."
give rodney hood a lifetime ban from the nba
Poor man's Rodney Hood
"when Rodney Hood and CJ Elleby receive all-star game votes, it's a sign players should not vote on any award."
Totally forgot about Rodney Hood til the bucks signed him
"Nah. I have a Jazz Rodney Hood jersey, a Kings Cousins jersey, a Bobcats Raymond Felton jersey, and two Dion Waiters Heat jerseys."
"I’m pretty sure every decent team in the east qualifies except for the Hornets and Hawks.   - Nets have Kyrie and Joe Harris - Bulls have Ball and Caruso - Heat have UD - Wizards have Harrell, Kuzma, and KCP - Bucks have George Hill and Rodney Hood - Knicks have Derrick Rose - Sixers have Drummond and Danny green - Cavs have Love - Celtics have Schroeder   So yeah I agree I think the streak most likely stays alive this year one way or another."
George Hill and Rodney Hood play for Milwaukee. Harris counts for Brooklyn (and I guess Kyrie technically? Idk lol).   But also the streak can’t technically end until he retires since he could end up playing with players after they make the finals (like Dwight Howard who counts for 09. (although the window for this is closing).
One more OT until Rodney Hood subs in
Yeah I kinda think it'll be a Rodney Hood situation. Maybe he can shoot but he can't get anywhere on the court that'll give him good enough looks.
Fuck Rodney hood and George hill
"Trade for George Hill, Rodney Hood, and Jordan Clarkson"
"That was actually an awesome trade for the Cavs and helped punch their ticket to the 2018 Finals (all for naught) but without that trade, no way the Cavs sniff the ECF. If Rodney Hood wasn't complete ass, they might have even had a shot if LeBron was prepared to average 50pt triple doubles in the Finals (despite JR's jackassery)."
Rodney Hood 😂 Okay dude
KD looked like a man amongst boys those 2 final series especially 2017. 2018 those first 2 games was eh..(by his standards) game 3 where lebron tried to trick us into thinking Curry screened him off so he could let Rodney hood get bombed by KD was still a classic lol
"It was something like:  OUT:  Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye, Dwyane Wade, Derrick Rose, Jae Crowder, Iman Shumpert  IN:  Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr,  Rodney Hood, George Hill,"
"Its not a mirror but its close. I do feel this Lakers team is better than what the Cavs had. Crowder, Lance, Clarkson, Cedi Osman and Rodney Hood were too inexperienced unlike the current Lakers. I do feel that if Lakers have everyone healthy they can beat anyone in the playoffs, even the Warriors."
"Rodney ""Fresh Legs"" Hood  Point-Six Lillard  meme pick: Sauce Castillo"
"The new rookies ( Mamu is not playable right now because he will foul out with 5 minbut he can develop in g league), Rodney hood, Justin Robinson . The jury is still out on semi ojeley"
You wanna watch Rodney Hood &amp; George Hill the revenge don’t you.   Well don’t worry I do too.
What about George Hill &amp; Rodney Hood vs Steph?  Jazz vs Warriors.  Cavs vs Warriors.  Bucks vs Warriors.  The stories really write themselves don’t they.
"I liked Wenyen Gabriel last year, thought he deserved more minutes.  I also loved Rodney Hood, kept believing he'd bounce back every game.  He did not :(  Very happy we picked up Zeller."
"Donte Divencenso, Rodney Hood and a second take it or leave it"
"I mean, yeah dude. We got absolutely torched that series when Aminu and Harkless were on the floor.    It was Zach and Rodney Hood off the bench that won the series."
"Fresh Legs Rodney Hood  I was incredibly sick so my sleep schedule was fucked but I happened to wake up for for last 5 min of regulation and I was excited I got to see a little basketball while I was awake, turns out it went 4 OTs. That was the season I really got into basketball too and that game really helped.   personal bias aside, Christmas 2016 Warriors Cavs"
George Hill is just so damn cute or Semi Ojeyele or Rodney Hood. Definitely only those 3 and no one else.
12 even!  Edit: the GOAT Rodney Hood makes it 15
Rodney hood is washed
Rodney Hood is not good
Fair to say that Rodney hood is not good
"we had Baynes, Bembry, Gillespie Rodney hood, Stanley, last year. what other choice did pascal have. teams just doubled him and he played with a injured shoulder. he's going to have better spacing and teams are going to be worried about OG and Barnes. it's not going to be easy doubling our guys."
I forgot all about Rodney hood. Literally haven’t heard his name since he left the cavs.
Rodney Hood. I know he hasn’t played for that long but I’m always surprised when he shows up on a box score
Rodney Hood shooting a wide open corner 3 has to be like a 300% better shot than a giannis top of the key three lol
"Awesome play, worked out well especially since Giannis hitting 3's instills terror into all 29 other teams even when they're up 29, the one thing is...  Why tf did Rodney Hood not shoot that?"
rodney hood could have just shot it
&gt; And Rodney Hood lol  The moment he galloped into the game you knew it was over
Honestly like everyone was solid that game. All 4 stars had multiple clutch shots  And Rodney Hood lol
I also remember Rodney Hood from RDC’s LeBron videos
Justin Robinson   Jordan nwora   Rodney Hood  Thanasis Antetokounmpo  Sandro Mamukelashvilii  Oh my god I got Sandro right first try
Rodney Hood really was bringing all the star power the line-up had
Justin Robinson  Jordan Nwora  Rodney Hood  Thanasis Antetokounmpo  Sandra Mamakushlavii
At one point the Bucks ran a line-up of:  Justin Robinson  Jordan Nwora  Rodney Hood  Thanasis Antetokounmpo  Sandro Mamukelashvili
Rodney Hood
"And Rodney Hood was also limping to the locker rooms before half time as well, so you might have him out too. Man you guys really got the short end of the stick here."
I'm surprised tank Lt. Commander Rodney Hood got another contract after his stint with us tbh.
You mean Rodney Hood and Grayson Allen?
"We also missed Nurk and CJ for half of last year, in what world is having to start Kanter and use Melo for bench minutes not going to create a bad defense regardless of the coach?  Also last year Terry wanted an actual backup PG and Neil refused to bring one in wanting Ant to get those minutes, this year, we have DSJ in that role and it is allowing Ant to flourish along with the team  Neil gutted the roster after he WCF finals run and then hyped the team up like it was somehow a title contending roster and that turned a lot of the fans on Terry but it was absolutely Neils shit roster  After that WCF season the team lost Seth Curry, Mo Harkless, Al-Farouq Aminu, Evan Turner, Meyers Leonard (and then ten games into the next season Rodney Hood went down for the year)  and replaced those guys with: Hassan Whiteside, Mario Herzonjia, Anthony Tolliver, Nik Staukas, Kent Bazemore, Wenyen Garbiel and eventually Melo  and fans wanted to act like it was all on Terry and not on Neil, like c'mon"
"Portis only just got back on limited minutes for the Timberwolves game. Rodney Hood is 6'8 but he's only played two games and, again, on limited minutes due to injury.  The team just had a flurry of injuries (all mild, except for Donte who's still rehabbing) and they all fell on the starters and anyone who could possibly guard the 4 or 5."
