"All those guys are clearly better defensively. I forgot to add Bam Adebayo, who is also clearly better. If you wanna add centres who are debatable with Drummond, you can add: Jarrett Allen, Clint Capela, Serge Ibaka and Nerlens Noel. Some ppl may say Jokic and KAT are also similar defensively compared to Drummond. I think you're overrating his defensive impact based on the counting stats."
"**Most Dominant Player:** Joel Embiid  **Most Impactful Free Agent Signing:** Gordon Hayward  **Most Dangerous Lineup That Doesn‚Äôt Actually Play:** Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Nicolas Batum, Serge Ibaka, Marcus Morris Sr.  **All-Around Strangest Development:** Andrew Wiggins becoming mini Mutombo  **Breakout Sidekick:** De‚ÄôAndre Hunter  **Sunniest Bounce Back:** Mike Conley  **Most Concerning Start (That Actually Matters):** Josh Richardson"
"That roster was pre-Big 3 era, so it was most important to have 2 stars and a killer 6th man. The rest were role players and could be one way specialists. You would only roll out your 'big 3' in the same lineup in crunch time, but it was thought to be unsustainable because going small wasn't as much of a thing. The Lakers and Spurs dominated the 2000s era by playing slow and methodical, and the 7 foot paint monster was still an essential player.  The Harden trade wasn't simply that they didn't think Harden was worth the max, but he and Ibaka were 'at the time' of equal value. Serge was a one man paint-protector who could shoot the lights out from anywhere. I think you could even argue that Serge has fully lived up to his potential as a player while Harden greatly exceeded expectations.  Doesn't exactly absolve Presti of the trade because he a GM-savant who prob should've seen this coming, but I think he made the decision based on the Lakers, Spurs, and Mavericks being the gatekeepers more than the incoming LeBron-Warriors era. We ran into a lot of badluck that made the trade look even worse as the seasons went on."

Orlando Magic legend Serge Ibaka
sabonis and oladipo for serge ibaka
I'm not entirely sure why the Raptors are struggling.  I don't want to blame it on Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka being absent but your performance this year is the antithesis of what it was in 2018 and 2019.

"When I was younger, maybe junior high, I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my sister got her hair done. So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a hair salon with my niece, and who walks in but Serge Ibaka!  I was nervous as fuck, and just kept looking at him as he read a magazine and waited, but didn't know what to say. Pretty soon though my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Serge, but she just wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asking what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So, Serge put down his magazine, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of a hair salon. Chill guy, really nice about it.  Anybody else met him and have any stories to share?"

Serge Ibaka DPOY
They should have pushed for Serge Ibaka in the offseason
"You keep talking about Ibaka having trouble guarding top tier bigs, which may be true in some cases, but he‚Äôs still night and day better than Trez at guarding big bodies. In the end it doesn‚Äôt really matter much. Ibaka stretches the floor on the offensive end and is a primary reason our offense has opened up the way it has this season. The issue with Trez was he‚Äôd get abused on the defensive end, and would really do nothing to make other guys better on offense. The simple fact Serge can shoot threes has opened up the lane for Kawhi and PG. instead of Kawhi and pg driving and facing a top tier center in the paint, all they have to beat is their man. Then either drive and or kick.   What Serge does for an offense is more valuable on ANY team in the NBA than what Trez offers. Ibaka does not need to put up as good of stats as Trez to be a better player. Having watched each of them play for my team, it‚Äôs night and day Serge is wayyy better. Trez is selfish AF, Serge is out there to win."
"There‚Äôs no argument for Trezz being a better defender, advanced stats pretty much revolve around the team (nic batum has like the best orating in the league). Ig it‚Äôs a small sample size with Trezz but not Ibaka. Regardless, Ibaka has a good playoff history, while Trezz does not. Serge  legit shot 50 percent from 3 in the playoffs, I‚Äôm taking that over a guy that is legit a crybaby that can‚Äôt get over himself, is very litmited on offense and worthless on defense, also a locker room cancer. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Trezz was getting sub 15 minutes come playoff time, unless AD continues to hide him on D."
"Still tho  The clippers guys career averages are   38%, 41%, 38%, 37%, 38%, 36%  Kawhi, Kennard, Pat Bev, Morris, PG 13, batum  They also have lou will - a career 35% shooter, serge ibaka a career 36% shooter, reggie jackson a career 34% shooter that has shot over 37% since the start of the 2018/19 season.   And Patrick Patterson is still a solid stretch Big in limited minutes"
"Serge Ibaka is probably the most gorgeous man in the league, you never hear him talked about like those other guys you mentioned. Gordon is basic as hell too mans just gained 35 pounds and got a haircut dude looked like a foot when he was at butler"
I'll always dislike it when people say that because there's so many types of jumpers.      Is it like Kyle Korver/JJ Redick where the player can hit curling jumpers off screens?        Is it like Joe Ingles where the player primarily is just a stationary catch and shoot from the corner?      It it like Serge Ibaka where the player can hit elbow pick and pops?      Is it like CJ McCollum where the player can pull up and shoot from anywhere on the court from creating their own shot?
"I don't think the worry for the Clippers is Kawhi Leonard leaving. He's almost certainly gonna stay. Their problem is that Paul George, Marcus Morris, Serge Ibaka, and Patrick Beverley are all 30+ and likely to get slightly worse with each passing year."
"Real Madrid CF is actually a multi sport club. This is the team Luka joined when he was 13, but he played on the club‚Äôs youth team until he was 16. He averaged 25, 13, 4 and 6 steals his first year in the under-16 division so they bumped him up to the under 18 team when he was 14. Needless to say, he has a long history with this team specifically which is why they are the team in question for these talks.  Serge Ibaka also played on this team in 2011 I think"
"‚ÄúNotice no star wants to go there‚Äù? I guess 2x FMVP and the most coveted FA in 2019 is not considered as a ‚Äòstar‚Äô.   Their last FA include: Paul George, Marcus Morris, Serge Ibaka and Nic Batum. Tell me who does not want to go there."
"Do you even know what the protections are? Did you not just watch last season having big men (who aren't gonna come to Nola willy nilly) for the regular season / when needed helped keep Toni and Lebron fresh? Last thing Zion needs is to be center by himself as he still learns the fucking game. Dude hasn't played 50 games and is going through rookie pains.   Sorry we can't just magically sign a bunch of shooters with non existent cap space and the small city of NOLA attracting no ring chasing vet mins.   Adams has been the best offseason addition for sure. Money we spent on him wouldn't be spent in the next two years on other free agents because honestly who are we attracting. JJ has been ice cold. Lonzo is hurt. Bledsoe is the only thing clearly not a good fit and we will likely move him at the deadline or in the offseason. NAW looks promising and could take leaps like his cousin SGA. Lewis looks like a late lottery pick. Pieces are there just we have to give it more than 15 games with little to no offseason.   Sure a stretch 5 would help. But who tf is out there that's playable that the Pels could have gotten. It's this myth. Serge Ibaka and Marc Gasol were the only halfway decent ones. Both went to Los Angeles. So fuck off in saying we need a stretch 5. There ain't fuckin one. Of course adding a Bradley Beal and a Serge Ibaka to this team would have been ideal. Oh well. Young team, they'll grow and in 2-3 there will be a trade made for one of these guards like Booker, Beal, etc who will team up and then the Pels will be dominant. We're not 50 games into Zion and he's a walking 25 points."
"frankly, I think David griffin set this team up to fail this year. I'm not saying they didn't try to get serge Ibaka or whatever, but I'd certainly do just about anything to avoid putting Zion in a starting lineup with only ONE shooter, and Brandon Ingram. BI is great, but even his shooting has only come on this last season and a half.   i know he was shoring up the defense with Bledsoe and Adams, but theres no excuse for this team composition in the 2020s. lonzo isn't great but he's also set up to fail with this team situation. maybe he's trying to keep him on the cheap by giving him a bad season lol I just don't love it."
"Yea his last 6 games have been: serge ibaka twice, chris boucher, Myles turner and domantas sabonis, nikola jokic, and now Marc gasol and Anthony davis. And his next few games are lamarcus Aldridge, Mitchell Robinson, Rudy gobert, and then KAT twice (if he‚Äôs back from covid). 3 straight weeks of tough learning, but he‚Äôll bounce back soon enough"
A mispronounciation of Serge Ibaka by a Southerner.
"the LA teams combining would probably be better, but the NY teams combining would be pretty close behind.  ___  correct me if im wrong cause i dont follow them, but the LA team would be  PG: LeBron James  SG: Paul George  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Anthony Davis  C: Serge Ibaka  ___  while the NY team would be  PG: Kyrie Irving  SG: James Harden  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Julius Randle  C: Mitchell Robinson"
"Not sure about food fights, but the only time I've been to Cleveland I saw Serge Ibaka fight Marquese Chriss.   Fun times overall"
"Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka, Maybe throw in a side of Kendrick Perkins and Derek Fisher  Then Nash has to draw up Sekrit plays."
"Serge Ibaka for Domantas Sabonis, Victor Oladipo and Ersan Ilyasova should be mentioned as one of the worst trades in recent history. I don‚Äôt know what the Magic was thinking"
"Tristan Thompson, Montrezl Harrell, Serge Ibaka got paid 9m/yr each. Robin Lopez got 7m. Steven Adams got a 2 years extension for 17m/yr. And those were in the same free agency. Sure, Dwight's injury history and past locker room history might hurt his value a little but I would assume that he's worth at least the same as some of the names on this list"
As someone who‚Äôs watched every minute of Clippers basketball this season I can assure you I‚Äôm not worried about Ibaka one bit lol. The starting unit has the best defensive rating in the league and that‚Äôs largely because they have Serge as a back line defender. He‚Äôs been really good. Their defensive issues have nothing to do with Ibaka (and the whole defense thing has become massively overrated ever since Lue started staggering Lou and Luke and benched Reggie the defense has been really good for the whole team)
You sound dumb. So Mario Hezonja and Mo Bamba were good draft picks? Fran Vasquez was a good pick? lmao Trading Victor Oladipo for Serge Ibaka and then flipping him for Terrance Ross was a good decision?  Go play in traffic. You whole opinion is idiotic.
Serge Ibaka won‚Äôt sign with us and we can‚Äôt have another Favors
"On Serge, it was interesting seeing a lot of Raptors fans down on the Ibaka signing because of the role Lowry played in creating shots for him.  Based on what was being said before, it seems like Ibaka being good on the Clippers is a surprise to them.   Is Baynes taking bad threes or is the idea just that he shouldn‚Äôt be shooting them?"

"""Serge Ibaka WHYYYYYYYY, in my Nancy Kerrigan voice"" - Stacey King"
"Their worst matchups in my opinion are the Lakers, Bucks, Clippers and Sixers (in that order) and theres a world where they have to face 3 of these teams in one playoff run. Their biggest problem, at least in my opinion, is rim protection so its important to look at the teams that will feast at the rim.  The Lakers will absolutely be able to feast against the Nets at the rim and it gets even worse when you think about the minutes where they will have to have a backup center in the game going up against Monrezl Harrell. Can you really trust a guy like Claxton against not only Harrell but against the other players coming off the bench for the Lakers. Not to mention that Lebron/AD will be playing most of the game and theres nobody on the team that can defend AD at all. Tough matchup for the Nets and I feel that they would have a better time in next years playoffs if its against the Nets.  On the Bucks it is entirely possible that Jrue, Giannis, and Khris work together to contain James or Kyrie and negate some of the guard offense that Brooklyn will be reliant on, but even if they don't there isn't anyone on the team who can stop Giannis. They're going to have to build an even tighter wall than we've ever seen and this will allow Middleton and Holiday to put up big numbers. This is a series where Deandre Jordan could foul out easily in every single game and leave the Nets scrambling for extra paint defense. Honestly an incredibly tough matchup, but one where I can see the Nets coming out on top because of their absolutely insane offensive potential.  The Clippers have as ideal of a lineup as you can ask for against a team with an elite offensive PG, SG, and forward. Beverley, PG, and Kawhi on Kyrie, Harden, and Durant is about as good as you're going to find in the league and with a guy like Serge Ibaka backing them up that's going to at least present a bigger challenge for the Nets than 95% of teams can present. The issue with the Clippers is honestly the same with the Nets. Both teams are going to be reliant on guys who disappear in the playoffs, guys who are prone to injury and on a team with guys who understand the heaps of pressure being put on them. The Clippers and Lakers being the two western favorites is pretty much the least ideal situation Brooklyn could ask for.  The 76ers are basically the anti-Nets. They're super defensive and play above the rim. Theres a world where Simmons is on KD, and then you figure the rest out from there, with Embiid locking up the paint. Who can guard Embiid on this team? This is a series where Dwight Howard can actually put up 10 pts, 10 rebs off the bench and Shake can average 13-16 ppg off the bench. I would bet the house on the Nets winning this series but there is a world where we see the Sixers looking completely unstoppable at the rim.  I would bet on the Nets getting to the finals and losing, then looking better next year after getting more front court depth."
"At some point it becomes kinda offensive. Like I get it, names can be hard and sometimes you'll slip up on where a player is from. But imagine if they started butchering Serge Ibaka or Pascal Siakim and said they were from Kenya. Or if they intentionally pronounced Deandre as DEE-AND-RAY for comedic effect."
"Serge Ibaka is a career 47% mid range shooter, and a better free throw shooter than either Malone or Ewing"
"It's soooo wild that we've seen Brooke Lopez and Serge  Ibaka become 3 point shooters during the ""3 revolution"",  but wonder if Karl Malone or Patrick Ewing would make it in today's league. Like, da fuck y'all?"
"Imagine Ernie telling the same ‚Äújokes‚Äù about Loul Deng being from Cameroon... or Joel Embiid being from Ethiopia... or Serge Ibaka being Cuban... or Bol Bol coming from Kenya. But really if Shaq were a comedian this kind of humor probably wouldn‚Äôt be questioned, heck, it‚Äôs barely even questioned as it is."
"&gt; Centers are notorious for peaking their rookie years because the position is so easy  14 pts, 8 reb, 1 ast - Anthony Davis' ""peak"" rookie season.   10 pts, 7 reb, 2 ast - Nikola Jokic's ""peak"" rookie season.   7 pts, 6 reb, 2 ast - Bam Adebayo  2 pts, 3 reb, 1 blk - Rudy Gobert  6 pts, 5 reb, 1 ast - Nikola Vucevic  6 pts, 5 reb, 1 blk - Serge Ibaka  4 pts, 5 reb, 1 blk - Deandre Jordan  3 pts, 3 reb, 1 blk - Clint Capela  2 pts, 1 reb - Thomas Bryant  3 pts, 4 reb, 1 blk - Steven Adams"
It's just a racist stereotype that often was used with african players. Same thing was said about Serge Ibaka.
Serge Ibaka needs to get traded Clippers.

Then trade for serge ibaka and move back to Seattle.

"What? There aren‚Äôt enough shots in the game for Harden to have improved that OKC teams odds. I loved that OKC team but this was a Lebron Steamroll that the only team that could beat them in recent years was probably the GSW with KD lineups.   Harden on that roster only ever worked as a 6th man, you can‚Äôt have a ball dominant guard and a ball dominant forward on the floor at the same time and expect that with another ball dominant guard on the floor things will get better. That OKC team didn‚Äôt lack scoring or star players, it lacked D outside of Thabo Sefolosha and Serge Ibaka, and Harden doesn‚Äôt help then there at all.   Getting rid of Harden was the best move for both parties ultimately, this isn‚Äôt 2k you can‚Äôt have 3 players averaging near 30 pts per game."
DeAndre Jordan for Serge Ibaka. Spencer Dinwiddie and Kyrie Irving for Wendall Carter? Kristaps Porzingis. Jarret Allen.  I think WSC is Wendall Carter. None of this shit is realistic.
There isn‚Äôt a single person on gods green earth who can convince me serge ibaka is a superstar
How hard are some people on this sub ? Why wouldn't the clippers want Kyrie for serge fucken ibaka? Kyrie is levels better
Just need Serge Ibaka
Way to disrespect NBA Champion Serge Ibaka
"Some are so inaccurate now after the changes  Serge Ibaka is listed 7‚Äô0, KD is listed 6‚Äô10 and Marc Gasol at 6‚Äô11  Reality is KD is a slight bit taller than Serge, maybe not a full inch; but both are definitely shorter than Marc. There are heaps pictures of Serge and Marc next to each other to show it"
"Completely correct. I got lured in by Wood's first few games that he might be an all-star-level talent. If htat were true, then I do think a lot becomes possible. But if Wood's ceiling is Serge Ibaka/Thomas Bryant/Harrison Barnes--i.e. Wood as a quality starter, but nothing more--then this season is not happening."
Serge ibaka has entered the chat
"For everyone reading that comment - every sentence he wrote is filled with misinformation. Ty Lue starting Ibaka and Batum has made the starting unit have a defensive rating of 82.0. They are the best defensive unit of any five players in the NBA. The next closest is the Bucks starting unit at 92.6. They are by far the best defensive unit in the NBA with Serge as the rim protector. The bench defense‚Äôs issues has nothing to do with Serge, he has been a major plus for the team‚Äôs defense"
"We just dont have enough guys that can play winning basketball and those that can, have started slow. Like this is our Championship rotation players:  Kyle Lowry - Still plays at a high level  Danny Green - Went to LA  Kawhi Leonard - Went to LA  Pascal Siakam - Plays at a high level. Had a slow start and has picked it back up, but his regression is completely exaggerated because of the bubble.   Marc Gasol - Went to LA  Fred VanVleet - Still plays at a high level but is sometimes inconsistent in scoring due to his size.  Norman Powell - Has looked like a shell of himself so far and his BBIQ looks like GoDaddy curse Norm from [year 3](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/powelno01.html).  OG Anunoby - His defense is good, but his shot has been off so far. We were hoping he would take a leap in the scoring department after the bubble, but he still can't create buckets for himself.  Serge Ibaka - Went to LA  So last season, we lost Kawhi and Danny but we were still able to compete at a high level because we had 7 solid players. Our depth wasnt the best which is why Nurse would heavily rely on the likes of our 7 Championship vets. [Look at the MPG for the playoffs last season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/TOR/2020.html)  While we played well, our two biggest weaknesses were rebounding and halfcourt offense, none of which were addressed in the offseason.  We also lost Gasol and Ibaka, who while looked like they were past their primes, provided solid defense at the rim and good offense. Marc couldnt score, but his passing was phenomenal, and Ibaka was able to get buckets consistently from midrange and 3. They both also brought a veteran poise and IQ to the team.  They were replaced with Alex Len and Aron Baynes. Baynes has struggling on offense, he cant even make open layups, and Alex Len, is a bonafide scrub.  So our bench mob became our starters and our bench is thin and full of gleaguers. Terrence Davis hasnt played much and is struggling a bit. Boucher has been great but he lack size.  So were a small team and a lot of our talent has been stripped. Our key vets have had some off games early and that can be attributed to getting adjusted with a new team as well as offcourt things like having to be in Tampa and essentially every game being a road one."
Im still waiting on FT stats when Serge Ibaka kisses the ball vs when he doesnt.
"Why did the Raptors become way worse after losing Kawhi, as well as 3 other (at least part-time) starters in Danny Green, Marc Gasol, and Serge Ibaka, while their new best player in Kyle Lowry aged 2 years and is now 34???"
Our interior defense sucks (or not as good) without marc Gasol and serge Ibaka. Marc Gasol in particular can anchor paint defense all by himself.
"I don't love their bigs defensively though, I think having PG/Kawhi help a lot with that   Serge/Zu are solid at protecting inside but don't have much mobility on the perimeter. That can be exploited if you aren't stacked with elite guard/wing defence  Bev/Harden/Kawhi/Batum/Ibaka with Jackson/Lou/Kennard/Morris/Zu off the bench leaves a fair amount to be desired defensively. Come playoff time I think a good team would exploit that   but ultimately the trade off for Hardens offence is probably worth it anyway, just don't think it's a clear favourite team"
And if steph was on the team that would be ‚Äúformer DPOY Marc gasol‚Äù ‚Äúall defensive team serge ibaka and pascal siakam‚Äù
"Some of them even lick the hand before free throws (Reggie Jackson), kiss the ball during free throws (Serge Ibaka), play with their mouth guard putting it in and out of the mouth (Steph Curry). Basketball is the one game that is most prone to respiratory virus transmission"
"The whole ""record-keeping is bad"" in [insert African country] argument is a myth. Every African player gets questioned like this, including absolutely ridiculous shit like saying Mutumbo was like 50 when he was on the Rockets.  Serge Ibaka said it best when he was on the Raptors and people were questioning his age. You can look up his while statement but he basically said he didn't grow up in a jungle, which is the mentality behind that myth.  There is certainly some fishy aging that goes on, especially in soccer. But it's not because of jungle record-keeping. It's because sketchy sports governing bodies deliberately try to get 17 year olds into under-16 tournaments. Or because desperate families try to get their talented children a slight edge in terms of opportunity by shaving a year off to get them into preferable European leagues. Again, this is a bigger issue in soccer.  I say this respectfully because I know this myth is pretty engrained among basketball fans... Stop assuming African basketball players are full-grown men when they are actually teenagers. I'll link Biyombo's story below. He went to Qatar/Yemen to play as a 16 year old. If your rumor is to be believed, that would mean they managed to pass off a man who was potentially 22 as a 10-11th grader. The amount of people who would have to not seriously question that or spill the truth at some point in his career would be ridiculous.

"I was watching the face of Serge Ibaka in that 4th quarter and you could just see the disgust and shock on his face, like ""oh, this is what we do here I guess?"" It really contrasted with the look on Beverley's face, where he just knows to expect it."
"Idk I feel like this a thing people say about every player from Africa, and that seems really fucked up to me.  Most likely Biyombo just looks old, like Greg Oden. Nobody ever questioned if Oden was as old as he said he was, and that's only because of where we was born.  Also people said this same thing about Serge Ibaka for years, some still do on this sub actually, and it's total bullshit."
"I miss Ibaka. Serge, come back home!"
Must feel so cool for a young big like Wiseman to get helped up by Serge Ibaka

He's talking about Serge Ibaka
Lmao lowry and the raptors have lost their best paint scorer and finisher in serge ibaka but lowry and the team are too good to continue struggling for this long. Theyll figure it out and the rumors will die down.
"He's talking about Sabonis, he was thrown together with Oladipo in that incredibly stupid Serge Ibaka trade that ended with Ibaka being sent to Toronto 6 months later  Wtf were the Orlando Magic thinking"
Serge Ibaka has entered the chat
"People are talking about how bad the Raptors are on the offensive end, but honestly, the offense was really unreliable last year as well. Everybody had bad nights, and it was really just a matter of hoping two guys had it together enough to carry the offense. Losing Serge means there's 1 less option, but that's not enough to explain this dramatic a drop.  The problem is really in the defense - it used to be elite enough that it would regularly hold teams to below 100 and multiple players could have poor offensive nights and still win. That is no longer the case, and as a consequence bad shooting nights that would have been glossed over last year as part of yet another win carried by the defense are being exposed.  The worst part is that it's not terribly clear how they solve this. You can't just say ""Play better"" and have people start playing better. Siakam, OG, or Norm getting out of their ruts would be huge, but who knows how long that will take; the defense starting to gel would be great, but honestly there's a limit to how much Baynes, Len and Johnson can replace Gasol, Ibaka, and Hollis-Jefferson - not to mention that Boucher's thin frame means he's best utilized differently than other centers on defense. Nurse could make a new system with new rotations, but that won't happen overnight and might not even solve the problem.  So yeah, I think we might just have to get used to this. Hopefully not all the time; I didn't expect the Raptors to tank this year."
"You realize Serge Ibaka was top ten in the league for defensive rating last year, yeah?"
We lost Kawhi then Danny Green then Serge Ibaka then Marc Gasol  That's a lot of talent without assets coming back
They lost Celtics killer Serge Ibaka
"Damn, I'm trying not to like draymond cause he been a dirty player in past, but seeing him on TNT and in media interviews, dude is dam smart. I have to give credit where credit is due. Maybe he's made some boneheaded plays in past cause emotions got better of him, but I'm coming around.  Fck  I feel like this comment is so applicable to teams with bad defense. Raps used to be a very good defensive team, but that's because we had marc gasol and serge ibaka  without them not only do we lose a big body, I bet we lost the communication too. Seems to be part of reason why we look so sloppy on defense. Maybe Len and Baynes are not communicating with the guys in front of them as much"
Serge Ibaka vs Lebronto
"The Toronto Raptors are currently ranked 28th in offensive rating (103). Is this a small sample size or is the offensive slippage a cause for concern?  Without Serge Ibaka and Marc Gasol, they've inserted Aaron Baynes and Alex Len into their lineups. I would've thought that removing Gasol would've made the defense suffer, but in terms of DRTG, they've basically been chugging along fine (currently at a 105, good for fifth place in the league)."
"Heard from kawhi that Serge Ibaka is on the trading block, why not go for him instead /s"
Ricky Rubio  Zach Randolph  Tyson Chandler  Serge Ibaka  .  .  .  baby poo  .  .  .  Kevin Garnett
"Spencer Dinwiddie - 11M  Jusuf Nurkic - 12M  Tj Warren - 12M  Malik Beasley - 13M  Serge Ibaka - 9M  Derrick Rose - 7M  I‚Äôm not saying all of these are better value, but some of them are (I‚Äôd say Rose/Ibaka for sure)"
"It's only been like 6 games. However, PG looks great, Kawhi is going to do Kawhi things and more importantly Serge Ibaka is an underrated pickup for you guys.    Out of all the teams in the West, Clippers looks the best as of now."

Shades of Serge Ibaka with the ol‚Äô toy bite dunk  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_NMBL764E8c
"Jimmy Butler took 2 off of you and he had an undersized team with barely any supporting cast to speak of. The Lakers whole thing was rolling over exhausted small ball teams because they had AD, that doesn't work anywhere near as well when you have Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka going up against you."
Serge Ibaka
No we don‚Äôt down play it we just see what his hardships were and Compared to other NBA players like Serge Ibaka or Teletovic. Lebron has been a Millionaire for more then  half his life in a first world country. Americans always think it‚Äôs so hard here but kids from around the world have the same issues while wearing shoes Made from old tires.....
We had Serge Ibaka on our squad for years and you dare utter that slander against him?
&gt;but that's a good way to make your franchise not appealing to free agents (I guess). it doesnt help that Lou is beloved amongst players in the league.  They already did this to Blake &amp; got 2.. Top 15 players the next year.   Along with Serge Ibaka who could've had an enormous role on most contenders.    So yeah.. most GMs would not hesitate to trade him.
"Interestingly, the dunk contest has a history of catching a lot of players before their true ascent into super stardom, so it creates this perpetual cycle where it feels like there‚Äôs no stars entering each year only to look back in hindsight and realize there‚Äôs names everywhere.   Just in the last 10 years or so, all-star caliber contestants have included Dwight Howard, Zach LaVine, Victor Oladipo, Donovan Mitchell, Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Giannis Antetokounmpo, John Wall, Mason Plumlee, Damian Lillard, Paul George, Serge Ibaka, and Blake Griffin."

Serge Ibaka and Samuel Soba
"2018: Serge Ibaka is 6'10"", Derrick Favors is 6'10""  2020: Ibaka is 7'0"", Favors is 6'8""  Makes perfect sense."
"Brook, gasol, lebron (really) and even serge ibaka developed that jumper.   And then there is Ben simmons who basically plays like a 6'11 version of rondo and deserved to be an all star. (Ofc he isnt from pre the era but he certaintly plays like it. And i love it)"
"You know what gets lots of guys into the hall? Winning championships.  Harden, in case you forgot, was on a team with Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and Serge Ibaka - they even made it to the finals (the only time Harden's ever been).  The guys Harden keeps losing to? Yeah, it's the Warriors - including the Warriors beating him last season when Curry and Klay were out and Draymond led a team that was mostly rookies, two-ways, and 10-days past him on national television.  Harden played on teams good enough to win. If only Harden had actually won."
"It's even worse when you look at the big picture that that trade lead to.  Magic trade Tobias Harris for Ilyasova and Brandon Jennings.   They then trade Ilyasova, Oladipo, and Sabonis for Serge Ibaka.   They used the cap space from trading away Tobias Harris to sign Bismack Biyombo.  Ibaka is then traded for Terrence Ross and a 1st that AFAIK never played a game for the Magic.    So in all, they basically traded Tobias Harris, Ilyasova, Oladipo, and Sabonis, for the corpse of Brandon Jennings, Terrence Ross, a 1st that didn't play for them, and Bismack Biyombo."
"Victor Oladipo, the 8th pick(Sabonis) and Ersan(later traded for Jerami Grant) for Serge Ibaka was worse."
I will give ScoBro Ibaka. He really did a great job with Serge. That's the only player though
"That sounds like a coaching problem.  Same thing happened with Ibaka and Dwane Casey.  He used to try to dribble and would turn it over constantly.  Once Nurse took over, Serge hardly ever put the ball on the floor and Nurse came up with a lot of cuts and pick and pops for him."
I read Steve Blake as serge ibaka and was confused for a second
"They haven't been as good as last year, but you think that has anything to do with losing our entire centre rotation? Replacing Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka with Baynes and Alex Len? And even with that, the Raptors are 7th in the league in defensive efficiency, and of current playoff teams they're in the 7th-9th range of defensive rating (adjusted or unadjusted). Again, this is a team regularly giving minutes to Aron Baynes at center. How is that terrible defense by any metric?  Sources:  https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/defensive-efficiency  https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/defensive-efficiency"
Not to knock your front office but hindsight's 20/20 on some of their actions post-Dwight.  You all drafted both Oladipo and Sabonis who were traded for a half-season rental of Serge Ibaka. Drafted a couple of busts in Bamba and Hezonja...
"We could have had Ibaka, we just chased two dogs and caught neither.  We should have just committed to Serge, Gasol is a great presence but his best years are behind him and he would have only been a stopgap."
I thought anyone who thought a 60 win team turned into a high lottery team from losing Serge Ibaka and a completely washed Marc Gasol was an idiot.
serge ibaka
Serge Ibaka and Danny Green react to his questions. The video was hella out of pocket considering their contexts. Serge and danny both being teammates (both getting violated). Do you not find this funny when he asks the questions so blatantly and out of no where?
There's not much he can do when Serge Ibaka needs to be guarded at the three-point line
1. Hakeem Olajuwon  2. Steve Nash  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo  4. Dikembe Mutumbo  5. Serge Ibaka  6. Victor Oladipo  7. Manute Bol  8. Luol Deng  9. Pascal Siakam  10. Joe
I wonder what the default name is when referring to a player?  Doncic vs Luka?  Porzingis vs Kristaps?  Jokic vs Nikola  Ibaka vs Serge  \#28 vs Aerial Powers :O)
Good players would make us better is definitely a bold take lol.  Maybe a good rim protector with some range like... Serge Ibaka? We could lock up second in the East!
"I mean even if they make the playoffs,  how does that prove anything about the front office? Sean Marks has done a hell of a job finding talent in Brooklyn even with most of their top picks going to Boston. How do you change the narrative around the Knicks with 1 playoff appearance.   Nets had better culture, talent, GM, and owner.   KD had this to say:  &gt; ‚ÄúI just liked the organization as far as the direction they were going in ‚Äì a bunch of young guys that played in the playoffs before,‚Äù Durant told former teammate Serge Ibaka on his YouTube Show. ‚ÄúThe Knicks players, they‚Äòre good young players but they still need more experience to match where I was in my career. It was nothing major against the Knicks. I just think Brooklyn is further along in the process of being a contender.‚Äù  So are the Knicks much further long in the process of being a contender with thibs and randle playing like a star? I guess, but I'm still not sold on the FO and culture."
"I'm sorry did he not just drop 20+20 on the Clippers with Ibaka? There's a lot of fair criticisms against Rudy, ""gets outplayed by Serge Ibaka"" is not one of them."
Serge Ibaka as Fear Factor host
3p% is pointless without accounting for the difficulty of shots. Last year Serge Ibaka shot a better % than James Harden.

"They're probably thinner than you and both you guys offer the same money and minutes. I'm not sure what you're not understanding here. If the money is the same and the mjntues are the same, they're going to go to the team in Brooklyn that has three stars over milwaukee.   You couldn't even talk to Mark Gasol or Serge Ibaka last off-season, I'm not sure why you think those caliber guys would take to you this off-season when the Nets are also in the picture.You had to pick up scraps like Forbes and Bobby portis for a reason.  This is your roster, either win with it or don't. This is it. It's not going to get any better, it'll probably get worse with guys like Lopez getting older and teams like the Nets, Lakers and Clippers taking all the ring chasing vets off the table.   At least Giannis is happy and has a lot less pressure on him because nobody expects his team to come out the east anymore but yea man, the Holiday trade was the final bullet in the chamber.

"We replaced Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka with Aron Baynes, the Celtics had few good bigs to start with (also Kemba has been dookie), the Heat have been murdered by injuries and COVID"
Lakers seem like the only chance. Clippers got a pretty insane line up with Serge Ibaka on them now but doesn‚Äôt seem possible.  Still think mavs suns and nuggets can beat anyone if their players are on absolute fire.
"Do you believe that was the only change we made?   - We got Marc Gasol  - Siakam became an all star / borderline all star caliber player   - Serge improved significantly  - We got a championship 3&amp;D starter in Danny Green  - Fred VanVleet was a lot better in the last 2 series  - We got a new head coach that understood positional matchups   In 2018 our offensive rating against Cleveland was fine. The issue was defensively, we had JV guarding Love, Serge Ibaka on JR Smith and DeMar (a guy who infamously couldn't get around a screen to save his life) guarding Kyle Korver. There's a reason those 3 shot 40%+ in that series and did shit all offensively  In the other series .  If Exchanging Kawhi for DeRozan was truly the only change we made, we lose to Philly 100%"
I specifically said the Spurs series because I feel that‚Äôs where he made the most money. Of course they were more important over the course of an entire season because they played more minutes.   Daryl Morey clearly saw enough to offer him a max contract because he realized they couldn‚Äôt comfortably pay him and keep Russell Westbrook/Serge Ibaka  You might think Lou Williams and Jamal Crawford are scrubs because they come/came off the bench but I gotta disagree.
Serge Ibaka is also criminally underrated in this department
"You really think so? I think they could easily trade barnes for a better more reliable fit. Shit, even the raptors were able to get Serge Ibaka and PJ Tucker for Jared Sullinger and Terrance Ross that very same season."
"Really interesting how certain picks have huge bumps in value when compared to neighboring picks. 7th, 9th, 10th, 13th, 18th, 21st, 23rd, 24th. 7th was no surprise to me given Steph (even though the chart's from 2014), but also has guys like Luol Deng, Eric Gordon, Rip Hamilton, Chris Mullin. 9th is loaded with Dirk, Amar'e, Shawn Marion, DeMar, Iggy, Kemba. 10th has Paul Pierce, Paul George, Joe Johnson, CJ McCollum, Brook Lopez. 13th already looks good recently given Herro and Booker, but also has Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine and of course Kobe. Good spot to draft a SG I guess.  18th, 21st, 23rd, and 24th seem a bit random. 18th has above-average role players/1-time All-Stars with BJ Armstrong, David West, JR Smith, Eric Bledsoe. 21st has Michael Finley and Rajon Rondo, and I like Brandon Clarke and Tyrese Maxey from recent classes. 23rd is represented mostly by Tayshaun Prince. 24th has Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Serge Ibaka, and Derek Fisher.  I wonder if there's actually added value to holding these specific picks in that they are often the beneficiary of teams above them passing on certain types of talent. The ones towards the end of the 1st could also benefit from being typically selected by the league's better teams, meaning those picks go into higher-functioning organizations that are able to properly support their draft picks, and also likely have specific holes for their 1st round pick to fill in a mostly constructed roster.  It's also possibly that there's simply not enough compiled league data to truly draw conclusions about any of these outliers. They could possibly all fall back to the mean given like 50 more years of the NBA."
"I doubt we would‚Äôve swept, but Kawhi willed the Raptors past us.  It was pretty much just him, and Serge Ibaka for some reason."
"No he wouldn't. Real Madrid had a great team and he wouldn't be able to play without playing team basketball. In 2011 lockout season Real had players like Llull, Reyes, Jaycee Carolly, Rudy Fernandes, Checo Rodriguez, Serge Ibaka, Nikola Mirotic who are all great players. And if you say that someone would have 75% usage, then you clearly never saw Real play."
Let's face it. A lot of the FO's focus in the 2020 offseason was maintaining cap space for 2021. The purpose of the cap space was to make a run at Giannis.   It's the reason we have Aron Baynes instead of Serge Ibaka.
"&gt;  then you named a bunch of guys on teams that are doing worse than the Cavs at winning basketball games.  It's almost like NBA teams have more than one player.  ""Jokic's team is worse at winning basketball games than the Clippers. Therefore Serge Ibaka contributes to winning basketball more than Jokic does.""  Now, tell me how that logic sounds to you now that I've contextualized it."
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"

"Mike Conley, Serge Ibaka, Harrison Barnes, Fred Van Vleet and Marcus Smart"
Serge Ibaka was the 4th best player on OKC... if he was a 2007 Cav he would have been the 2nd best player on the team. As a matter of fact Serge Ibaka would probably be the best player Lebron ever played with prior to going to Miami. But in OKC he was just  a role player 4th option.
"Why can‚Äôt we talk about Harden in the 2012 playoffs? Dude was great up until the Finals.  Russ also averaged 23/5.5/6 on 50.6% TS. Below average, but the league average TS% at the time was 53.8% so it‚Äôs not like he had horrible efficiency.  That whole team played really well, they just were overwhelmed in the Finals. Serge Ibaka as the 4th best player even had some really good moments."
"The lack of defense isn't because of a lack of effort, it is that today's schemes, shooting, and spacing is impossible to defend.    Imagine the 97 or 98 Jazz, but playing today's style.   Stockton would take 10+ threes a game and hit 40%+ Malone would be rolling at the rim with no help defense because Ostertag would be replaced with a center like Brook Lopez, Marc Gasol, or Serge Ibaka that forces his defender out to the 3 point line.   Byron Russell and Jeff Hornacek both hit 40%+ from 3 at 5+ shots per game (Jeff was over 40% in 98, but both had multiple seasons over 40%)  That team would be way better on offense than they were, and they were a good offensive team, and only Ostertag is out of the picture.  Everyone else settled for midrange jumpers because they they didn't know better (its kinda dumb that they didn't know better, it's obvious that 40%√ó3=1.2 &gt; 50%√ó2=1.0).  Even in those same rules against those same defenders of the 90s, that team would score way more using today's style of play."
"Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Steven Adams?  Seriously though they have something like 17 or 18 FRP over the next 7 years right? I think given they have the contracts and good young players in Shai, Dort, etc they could realistically get 3 all star/2 superstar caliber players pretty easily."
"Neither is Serge Ibaka but since he was included in OP's post, I decided to use him as the bar to get over to be included."
"The traditional power forward, who did the dirty work and shot 15-18 ft jumpers with a little bit of post offense. Think Horace Grant, Dale Davis, PJ Brown, Tyrone Hill, etc. In today's league, either you are big enough that you're just a center now (Derrick Favors), you've expanded to the three point line (Blake Griffin, Paul Millsap), or both (Serge Ibaka). Or like AD, you just slide between the two positions."
"You're clearly beyond emotionally invested in this. Are you KD's Reddit burner account?  Why did you go straight to Caron Butler and just glance over Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka? Westbrook was hurt for part of the year, but still played in 65 games that year including the playoffs. Ibaka averaged 15/9 and was first-team All-Defense. They also had Caron Butler, Steven Adams, Kendrick Perkins, Thabo Sefalosha, Derek Fisher, and Nick Collison who are all 10+ year NBA players. That team wasn't the 2017 Warriors, but they weren't even close to those crappy Lakers teams."
"I don‚Äôt know what it is, but a good amount of guys who have come up through Europe have really big personalities. Giannis, Jokic, Luka, Boban, Serge Ibaka (born in the D.R of Congo, moved to France and then Spain in his late teens)"
&gt; Serge Ibaka  Disagree but I can see it  &gt; Jonas Valanciunas  ?????
"Serge Ibaka, Jonas Valanciunas"
"Nah not at all, he has the timing &amp; awareness to make up for it on the defensive end &amp; the spacing n offensive skill on the other end. He reminds me of Ben Wallace - in fact, he‚Äôs bigger &amp; better than Big Ben was as a rookie.   But he may struggle against the Embiids of the league, idk how he‚Äôll fare against the elite 7 footers. He eats up 7 footers regularly tho (Moses Brown, Wiseman, Markennen, Wood) so i think as he develops he‚Äôll be able to hold his own against the elite ones. He‚Äôs only 19.  The Pistons coaching staff have been training him at the four, so I‚Äôd imagine they‚Äôre preparing for situations where his height puts the team at a disadvantage at the 5 based on the opposition.  Does he remind you of a young Serge Ibaka ?"
"Pg13 cooking tf outta wesley , davis/ibaka is a sleeper match-up but obviously ima take AD but thunder serge definitely had clamps . Cousins and gasol would be a great battle , Lebron vs Kawhi V3 .. dunno who's gonna win that battle but its gonna go to game 7. Whoevers jerseys are hanging from the top of the building are the ones advancing"
The Raptors also had Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka last year so their defense is expected to be much better. When you have solid interior defense your perimeter defense can play harder on the perimeter because they know that even if they get beat they have a solid interior to cover for them. Their defense ranks 16th this year so it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre trash. They just don‚Äôt have a strong interior anymore and everything drops because of it.
"Serge Ibaka grew up in the midst of the second Congo war, that's pretty badass."
"Orlando was nearing a decision on which player to pay/keep out of Oladipo &amp; Fournier. Vic's camp wanted max. Evan was more modest with his asking price, and at the time, had similar production. With that scenario playing out, ownership was also putting lots of pressure on Hennigan to start winning. They couldn't stomach ""the process"" any longer. Also, enter new coach Vogel and the first thing he asks for is a shot-blocking big to put next to Vuc. Vogel's key ingredient to his defense was rim protection and Vuc isn'tthat. With all those factors bubbling up, Rob sought to get Ibaka from his friend Presti. Rob was also the asst GM that convinced Presti to draft Serge while at OKC. Then the draft-night trade happened. Including a pick was the teacher schooling the student. Orl had no intention to draft Sabonis but that's who OKC wanted."
Serge Ibaka is actually three short guys standing on each others shoulders wearing a robe.
*Serge Ibaka Has Been Banned From The National Basketball Association*
"There are a lot of recently immigrated africans (no idea which country) downtown where I live and they wear these clothing all the time (although more colorful), so I assumed it was some traditional clothing from his home country.  Ibaka then gave a quick glance downwards so I thought OP was implying we'd catch some Serge boner"
Serge Ibaka look like the babushka lady on the sidelines
Serge Ibaka why?
"So true, Thunder fan! How many rings did yall win with Westbrook, Harden, Serge Ibaka. KD, Paul George, CP3, and Shai on your roster at various points in time again? Must have been more than the Knicks in the same time period, right?"
"Remove two of the top 3 players from any team along with important rotation players like Looney. And tell me. What team in the nba would stand a chance?   Seriously imagine if Kawhi, Lowry and Gasol went down. They would have a starting lineup of Vanfleet, Norman Powell, Danny Green, Pascal Siakam and Serge Ibaka. That team would get obliterated in a finals game.   Though i do agree that warriors roster construction wasn‚Äôt great especially when guys like Jeff Green or Luc Mbah amoute are signing for the vet minimum"
"I think he'd be great on a team with a bona-fide superstar. Like a Kawhi Leonard type. And with a well-rounded frontcourt player, like a Serge Ibaka.  Would be interesting to see that."
"Not a warriors fan, but I think Klay is the piece that will create the domino effect of ""washed"" veterans joining contenders.  Guys like Iguodala, Trevor Ariza, Serge Ibaka may want to join a Warriors squad who, when healthy, have a good core. Saw it with the Lakers (Dwight, Rondo), the Nets (Aldridge, Griffin) most recently, but there are veteran ring chasers who just want to play on a team that they see as contenders."
Serge Ibaka would be nice
I‚Äôm not talking about that right now...that‚Äôs not the point of the post. But even so...I said Myles Turner or Serge Ibaka. Both better defensively than Steven Adams.
"They're obviously good, LA is way better at full strength.  Do you think Patrick Patterson is anywhere as good as Serge Ibaka or Reggie Jackson as good as Rondo-Beverly?"
"Clippers couldn‚Äôt do shit against the nuggets starters at any time in the game, all they can hope for is that serge ibaka turns into shaq against jokic"
Serge Ibaka shot 57/51/100 during the playoffs last year and he had 4.1 3PA. He‚Äôs already a good shooter
Serge Ibaka and Matt Thomas. Elite shot blocking and 3-point shooting
"All true, but we also have no real home court advantage, playing in Tampa and all.  Siakam is expected to do too much, with very little frontcourt help.  The muscle and timely scoring of Serge Ibaka is sorely missed, and I think it's impacted Pascal most of all.  Frustration is mounting on the team. The players aren't tanking though.  Still, we have champs like Fred, Pascal, and Kyle (OG and Boucher too, though they didn't contribute so much to our title) playing with some of the worst bench players in the entire NBA.    From day one, I knew that this year's Raps weren't going very far with such a lackluster roster, but I'm a little surprised that they've been so awful this whole month."
Look at a lot of our games. Its often a close loss. Now insert Serge Ibaka instead of Aron Baynes at the 5. Serge was usually good for 15 points or so. Add those 15 points back and we would be in contention to make the playoffs with all the extra games won.
"I don't how anyone can't call that Toronto team a super team. I get kawhi left. But they had a top 3 player in that postseason on kawhi. 2 other all-stars. Serge Ibaka who is a great defender, Marc Gasol who was all-defensive calibre. Fvv who was a 6th man of the year candidate. Norman Powell who was an efficient 10ppg. Danny Green who was still a great defender and whilst inconsistent is an experienced head. OG had great defence and good 3ot shooting.  They literally had 4 all-defensive calibre players and like 5 other high end role players. To me that is the definition of a super team.  If you look at those players now, norm and Fvv have developed into borderline all-stars. Siakim one year after was having an all-nba campaign before getting injured and covid."
"Since 2011, the Jazz, Nuggets, and Blazers draft picks have combined for 13 all star appearances (Lillard 6, Jokic 3, Gobert 2, Mitchell 2). These 3 teams are considered by most to be in the range of ""fringe contenders"" to ""playoff lock but nothing more"". Notable acquisitions via free agency in recent years (please let me know if I missed any notables. This was weirdly difficult to dig up.) :  * Evan Turner * Derrick Jones Jr. * Carmelo Anthony * Paul Millsap * Bojan Bogdanovic    Since 2011, the Lakers, Clippers, and Nets draft picks have combined for 3 all star appearances (D'Lo '19, Ingram '20, Randle '21), yet all 3 teams are championship contenders. Notable acquisitions via free agency in recent years:  * LeBron * Kawhi * KD * Kyrie * Blake Griffin * LaMarcus Aldridge * Serge Ibaka"
"You're willfully ignoring my point.  It's not a ""convenience-for-my-argument-thing"" when you're talking about separating guys who are entering free agency all NBA and are going to make 30+ million dollars (like Kemba) and good role players who're going to sign for around mid level contracts. Kemba's contract was only going to fit in one of a couple places and even fewer places when you're talking about adding a $30 mil. salary to a team that's already competitive before you get there. Boston was able to make him fit because Kemba wasn't actually in free agency for very long, he signed and traded with Charlotte to go to Boston so Charlotte could get Rozier back.  The nature of the salary cap means max guys don't fit in as many places because they're signing for contracts with bigger numbers like JJ Reddick, Serge Ibaka, Kent Bazemore, Jeremy Lamb, etc. etc. A team with 2 young all stars like Boston has with Brown and Tatum *should* be attractive to these role players that could make a difference. These guys aren't signing with Boston though. And I have beach front property in Kansas to sell you if you think that these lower-mid guys aren't signing with Boston for any reason besides Ainge's history as a GM"
Kyle Lowry   James Harden  Kevin Durant   Chris Boucher  Serge Ibaka  That‚Äôs a championship squad
"Thunder trading Harden  Magic trading rookie contract Oladipo for Serge Ibaka, I think that trade also cost them Domantas Sabonis  The 2012 Laker ‚Äúsuperteam‚Äù with Kobe Dwight and Nash  Knicks FO failing to manage the Kristaps situation properly  Kings drafting Bagley over Luka (this one is a little unfortunate, I think Bagley‚Äôs development has been stunted by injuries, else I think he‚Äôd be viewed as a premier prospect still, if a bit raw and definitely not as good as Luka I imagine)  Not a bad decision by the team, but a player: Boogie declining that offer from the Pels. He didn‚Äôt win a ring either for that pay cut with GS, so it was all for naught, and now he‚Äôs looking for work. Rough.  Tempting to put the Wolves‚Äô D‚ÄôAngelo Russell trade here but I‚Äôm fairly sure it helps keep KAT happy and he‚Äôs not necessarily a bad player."
"JJ Reddick, Serge Ibaka &amp; Vince Carter"
"noted ""big 3"" members dennis shroeder and serge ibaka, definitely not a salty 76ers fan after a loss to the nuggets tonight"
He was drafted with the Magic's pick so technically it wasn't his pick (not sure if the Magic made the selection or he got the pick first then drafted with it)  Sidenote the Magic gave up the Sabonis draft pick and Victor Oladipo for Serge Ibaka and then traded him to Toronto for T Ross and a pick (I'm not going to type that name) that did not turn out yikes.
Here's a list of Prestis first round picks   Player | Pick # ---|--- kevin Durant| 2nd Russell westbrook | 4th serge ibaka | 24th James Harden | 3rd rodrigue beaubois | 25th eric bledsoe | 18th craig brackins | 21st quincy pondexter | 26th reggie Jackson | 24th perry jones | 28th Steven Adams | 12th archie goodwin | 29th alex abrines | 32nd mitch mcgary | 21st josh huestis | 29th Cameron Payne | 14th Terrence ferguson | 21st Brandon Clark | 21st Immanuel Quickley | 25th
Serge Ibaka
People always forget to mention Serge Ibaka when that's probably the most impressive pick he made.
Ha I think it kinda was like that? I remember watching OKC games before he got traded and you could just tell the team did not like him. So awkward and obvious.  There were games where Perk and Ibaka purposely wouldn't pass him the ball: https://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/kendrick-perkins-serge-ibaka-froze-out-reggie-jackson/246648  Reggie OKC era was wild
"How was that a bad trade? He got Serge Ibaka and a horse for T Ross and a late first round pick. More importantly, he *didn't* get Mario Hezonija  I miss Game of Zones"
They got a huge starting centre upgrade with serge ibaka   They got a huge upgrade from Landry shamet to Luke Kennard  And they have a play off upgrade from lou Williams to rajon rondo   PG has also been playing amazing  Saying the clippers are the same is a casual take
"2013 and 2015 were two years of Thunder title contention sacked thanks to injuries. In 2014, the Thunder met their demise against the Spurs with Serge Ibaka going down halfway through the series. My point is, we only had the chance to face the Heat once. They were not the biggest hurdle to overcome, it was our injury history"
"Because he brought in every single piece on that team lol. What more could a gm possibly do? He found Siakam, OG, FVV, Powell and Jonas. He traded Demar (who he also found) for Kawhi Leonard. He traded JV for Marc Gasol. He traded for Serge Ibaka. He got Kyle Lowry before he hit his prime.  That roster was probably the least lucky roster in the last 10 years to win a championship. They didn't get their guys through free agency or have lottery luck, hell none of those guys were even top picks."
1. Kawhi 2. Paul George 3. Marcus Morris 4. Patrick Beverley 5. Serge Ibaka 6. Ivica Zubac 7. Nicolas Batum 8. Terance Mann 9. Reginald Jackson 10. Luke Kennard

Yup. Westbrook was 2nd team all-nba. Wade was 3rd team. James Harden was 6th man of the year. Serge Ibaka was the block champ and 1st team all-defense. LMAO
Serge Ibaka.
Serge Ibaka for obvious reasons
Serge Ibaka is the Celtics killer
"&gt; doesn't bite on fakes  Hah I think this one is also just his lack of hops, but it works well with his old man game. Plus he's fucking huge so it's not like he needs more height (and he's definitely taller than Serge, despite the official stats).  &gt; You'd think they'd want Ibaka in there, so the fact that he's not is troubling.  Yeah for whatever reason Nick Nurse never ended up trusting Serge. Serge started a lot in 2019-2020 because Marc was injured so much, but the moment Marc was back Serge got bumped. It came to a head during the playoffs when Gasol was really struggling against the smaller/faster Theis and Nick still wouldn't play more Serge. Serge even yelled at Nurse at one point.  Even with both their faults though they were great for us. People say Bigs are a dime a dozen, but the issue is most of them are quite dumb and low skill. One of the reasons the Raps are struggling so much right now is we don't have a Raptors calibre centre, and our defence just falls apart if even one player doesn't rotate well."
Serge ibakaüòÇ
"Serge Ibaka, JJ Redick, George Hill, and Al Horford over KPJ and Devin Booker?"
"That team was loaded Prime KD, Westbrook, ascending James Harden, and Serge Ibaka."
Blake Griffin or Serge Ibaka.
Serge Ibaka for reasons beyond basketball
"how many of these guys would you start Deandre Jordan over?  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Clint Capela  Nikola Vucevic  Christian Wood  Jarrett Allen  Karl-Anthony Towns  Montrezl Harrell  Rudy Gobert  Enes Kanter  Kristaps Porzingis  Bam Adebayo  Jonas Valanciunas  Richaun Holmes  Deandre Ayton  Steven Adams  Jakob Poeltl  Daniel Theis  Al Horford  Brook Lopez  Serge Ibaka  Mason Plumlee  Myles Turner  Wendell Carter Jr.  Moritz Wagner  James Wiseman  Cody Zeller  Nerlens Noel  Aron Baynes  I count 6 ***at most***.  That's if your low on Wiseman, and I would probably take Wendell Carter Jr. over him."
"‚Äúthis is art, bro.‚Äù - serge ibaka"
So basically Serge Ibaka = James Harden??
Yup. Ibaka was the key to 60 wins mr Serge-BigCocka
Want to trace it back further? OKC got the pick that became Serge Ibaka by taking on a couple years of Kurt Thomas' contract from Phoenix.  btw that 1st in the Jerami Grant trade almost definitely became Tyrese Maxcy.
Ibaka serves everyone Bif Pinus regardless of their preference.  'Ow 'ungry are you?!  Fuck I miss serge.
"I've been thinking about this recently. Centers are as good as they've been in a while---it's the traditional 4 that is dying out. You either have to be 1.big enough to play center, so you either slide over to C full time (Derrick Favors, Serge Ibaka), switch between the two positions (AD), or if you're not big enough you have to expand out to the three-point line Blake, Millsap, Kevin Love (although he expanded his range earlier than the others). A lot of guys playing PF now would previously be combo forwards/tweeners, or are just big wings. Siakam was a combo forward, now he's just a normal PF. Additionally, there is a de-emphasis on back to the basket play, so it's easier to get away with this.  It looked so bizarre seeing Portland throw out a Nurk/Whiteside/Melo frontcourt last season---felt like a 90's throwback."
I think he'd be a slightly better prime Serge Ibaka. Great shot blocker and good mid range jumper.
Michael Beasley only just retired 3 years ago at age 30. He was drafted the same years as Kevin Love and Serge Ibaka - stretch forwards were very much becoming a thing already. It's not like he's some dinosaur from a forgotten era.  Beasley's career sucked because of his work ethic and attitude problems.

the legendary serge ibaka vs kelly oubre duel
The floor spacing 5 is a myth   All these Myles Turner serge ibaka al horford Nikola Jokic types nobody guards regardless of what % they shoot. Teams let them shoot. Nobody cares they don‚Äôt get guarded   You can count on one hand the number of 5s with legitimate gravity who have actual floor spacing. That‚Äôs not an undercount either
Traded him for a 56 game rental of Serge Ibaka who we then traded to the Raptors for Terrace Ross
"This is what makes it so infuriating to see the Clippers lose so many close games (only partially, since it helped the Suns move up the standings). When the Clips staved off a 31-point comeback by the Suns earlier in the season, they did so by ball movement and finding the open man -- which was Serge Ibaka and Nicolas Batum in the clutch. They didn't go to Kawhi, who was having an abysmal game, or PG, who was going nuclear -- they swung and got a high percentage shot multiple times. So seeing them not execute against other teams is numbing"
Someone already said it but Serge Ibaka has a pretty fun channel on YouTube
"For the most part yes. Throughout their entire title run, the Warriors had a rotating cast of centers. David Lee. Andrew Bogut. Kevon Looney. etc.   The Raptors problems come more from having both Serge Ibaka and Mark Gasol leave in one offseason and they either didn't have the guys on the roster or sign anyone in free agency to replace those players. Ibaka and Gasol are both pick-n-pop bigs who can protect the rim, and losing Gasol's passing was a big blow to their offense and the sets they could run off that.   Baynes has the pick-n-pop going, but can't stay on the court defensively. He started off hot for Phoenix last year, but he got worse as the year went on and even when he was producing it wasn't on the defensive end of the floor. Boucher looks really good and can provide *some* rim protection, but he is way too skinny and can get bullied by bigger guys with regularity.   Celtics have the same issue. Since trading Isaiah Thomas, the Celts have lost and/or traded: Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Terry Rozier, and Jae Crowder. They have replaced those guys with Tristan Thompson, Robert Williams, Kemba Walker, Daniel Theis, and Jeff Teague.  Just from a pure talent standpoint, they have lost significantly at every position, and they haven't drafted well to replace what they lost. Kemba is playing better as of late, but he is still a defensive sieve and Teague has been a total loss for this team. Theis is good and gives great effort, but he is undersized at the position and gets dad dicked with regularity.   The Celtics are missing more than a true center, and even if they did have one to anchor their defense (Timelord looks like the player they need at C), they have such a lack of depth on the wing and guard positions that they would still be struggling."
"I mean I‚Äôm just here to distract myself from my pointless job.   Anyone replying on a Reddit thread about serge ibaka smoking hookah and drinking sugar water cares too much, so jokes on both of usüòÇ"
"I love Steven Adams. He's better than Serge Ibaka, and is invaluable on the Pelicans.  It is almost like /r/nba has no concept of defense and how it is played. Adams is probably the only guy on that team committed to Defense, and he doesn't use a lot of shots. And is still an automatic bucket if you play off of him in the pick and roll.  It's people like this who grow up to become Eastern Conference GM's."
"Uh, I'm a few years over 30 and I've played organized sports all my life until just a few years ago, so I have no idea what you're getting at.  Of course genetics play a huge role. Who said otherwise?  It's kind of hard to see what you're arguing here, but it's even harder to grasp how you don't see that Serge Ibaka - a professional top athlete in one of the most demanding leagues in the world - has worked on his body and abs."
"I saw a lot of people saying the other team was the Lakers, but what if they were the Clippers? I think he could play the most and could be more helpful for them than both Nets and Lakers. I think he could play small ball 5 with KD at 4 for the Nets but in that case the Nets would have a really shitty defense and he will be still baptized by defense because better letting him shoot over all the other 4 by far, and I'm not sure he is the most effective around the rim between him and DAJ at that point. Sure he is a great passer for the position and would help, but still.  He could have been more helpful for the Clippers instead, playing more minutes both as a pure 4, because he could be better than Batum on both ends and could also play small ball 5 for them. He could cover the back up role of Ibaka and in general be an alternative to Serge, and he wouldn't hurt the Clippers D too much as they would have always Kawhi, George and Beverley as great/good defender around him."
"Yeah, 3-time NBA All-Defensive First Team Serge Ibaka probably didn't work on his abs"
   # [Serge Ibaka x Ninho - Champion (Official Music Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18SIgInp4uk&amp;ab_channel=SergeIbaka)
"What the hell even happened to my man Serge Ibaka in the first place? He just kind of disappeared, I legit haven't heard of him in like months"
Ok hear me out. Let's put a team together with Russel Westbrook Keven Durant James Harden. And let's put Serge ibaka as a rim protector.
"The Raps depth became worthless in the playoffs also. The bench was Ibaka/Norm/TD/RHJ/McCaw for most of the season. TD/RHJ/McCaw was useless. Norm was bad for the first 5 games of the series, and Ibaka was getting abused in the PNR most of the series also. Then Marc and Pascal both disappointed mightily, and FVV wasn‚Äôt very good either.  Meanwhile Tatum and Brown played like all stars, Smart was elite, and Theis and Williams outplayed Marc and Serge. It was definitely viewed as an even matchup before the series, but with hindsight, im surprised the Celtics didn‚Äôt dispose of us sooner (TBf they were like 0.5 seconds from doing so lol)"
"Current: Theo Maledon, can‚Äôt believe we struck on a decent player in the second round of the draft  Past: Serge Ibaka, was a defensive anchor for the KD/Westbrook teams and somehow got us Oladipo &amp; Sabonis from the Magic"
"I think that's revisionist history as well. In those days, it was a known fact that we were desperate for a legitimate center; you needed one in order to compete in that era's Western conference. We were starting players like Nenad Krstic and spamming #freecole hashtags because fans were convinced Cole Aldrich could be our center. Perkins brought us a legit center to go up with the Western juggernauts.   In addition, the players are on record as saying Perkins was a veteran leader for our young-as-hell team and helped turn them into the defensive powerhouse we were when we were contenders (people like to forget that the contending Thunder were a defensive team that relied on Russ/KD heroics to get by on offense). Serge Ibaka especially says that Perkins was a mentor to him and that he'd often call Perk in the middle of the night for advice and to vent frustrations.  Perkins gets hate because Scott Brooks insisted on playing him heavy minutes against a Miami Heat team that was way ahead of their time (playing a small ball 5 in Chris Bosh and loading up with shooters to support ball-dominate stars), but we wouldn't have gotten to that Finals without Perkins to bang with guys like Zach Randolph and the Gasol brothers.  People also like to complain about the Perkins trade and forget that all we really lost in that trade was Jeff Green (who was taking up minutes and preventing Serge Ibaka from developing) and Nenad Krstic."
"&gt; When were these players starting in the Finals?  I guess you can't just look it up. Jordan Bell, who played in the G League this year and has been bouncing around on 10 day contracts started Game 1.  Shaun Livingston who was a shell of himself averaging 4ppg that year and retired after the series, started game 3 (and went 1-4 in that game).  Demarcus Cousins, who tore his quad earlier in the playoffs, started 3 games clearly hobbled but he was literally the only true center on the roster at that point and the Warriors needed size against Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka. Cousins ended up averaging 8 ppg on an abysmal 45 eFG%.  Quinn Cook and Alfonzo McKinnie played 20+ minutes in several games. Both were G League players the Warriors picked up. Cook is no longer in the league and McKinnie is riding the Lakers bench scoring 3 ppg.   Looney played well in the playoffs but in Game 2 he fractured his ribs, missed game 3, and was hampered by this injury for the rest of the series.   &gt;You were not coming back to win shit.  I don't know why you think I believe the Warriors were coming back. This point is basically a non-sequiter. I said the Warriors faced a huge talent disparity between their injuries and lack of roster depth. They were absolutely not a great team without KD and the other guys that missed games. They were extremely top heavy and with injuries to KD, Klay, Iguodala, Cousins, and Looney, they had no chance in the series."
"We tried to go after giannis and fucked up our cap and fucked up our relationships with serge ibaka and had a shitty center and even when we were putting it all together and was top 4 seed in the east, bam, covid knocks out fvv pascal og. Injuries lingered etc. The mistake started with our FO."
Serge Ibaka left and they‚Äôve been downhill ever since.   He‚Äôs even out because of injury right now with a sore back because of how much he carried last season.
"That does sort of matter in certain situations though. A random example off the top of my head is when Robin Lopez and Serge Ibaka got into a fight a couple years back. There were clear punches thrown but no damage was done - not even sure a punch was landed - so they each got like 2 games or something. But if Ibaka‚Äôs punch landed and knocked out Lopez then the punishment would‚Äôve been much more severe.  I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter in the context of flagrant fouls, but where the punch lands does matter when it comes to suspensions"
Serge Ibaka is a pretty big piece for them
"He would play that defense when he upped his intensity. Especially showed up in the playoffs as he'd be so effective and disruptive to guys like Tim Duncan, both Gasol brothers, Klay Thompson, Serge Ibaka, Dwight Howard, etc. It's really flourished ever since his last year with the Clippers then on to the Pistons and now the Nets, he plays so physical and with a high motor that just frustrates guys."
"Clippers too. Pat Bev and Serge Ibaka pretty much didn‚Äôt play at all, Kawhi missed around 10 and PG missed quite a few with the toe injury."
Serge Ibaka shows up to every game looking like a different anime villain.
Lmao is that fuckin Serge Ibaka looking like a human umbrella?
That‚Äôs not Serge ibaka!  That‚Äôs two children stacked on top of each other  wearing a trench coat
"That is pretty much what being the second option is. It literally means ""the second option to score"". Siakam in the 2019 Playoffs averaged 16.0 Field Goals Attempted per game, second on the Raptors behind Kawhi Leonard (20.7 FGA/G) and ahead of Kyle Lowry (11.6 FGA/G). Tell me, how can you take 4.4 more shots per game than the third highest on the team and literally double of the fourth most on the team (Serge Ibaka, 6.0 FGA/G) and you not be the second option?  Imagine lying about Siakam being the second option when he was LITERALLY the second scoring option on the Raptors."
I'm just listing down 3 to tie but game winners against Washington   Cory Joseph  Hedo turkuglu  Serge ibaka  Chris Bosh  Gary trent jr
"Lmao fr‚Ä¶.I once got ‚ÄúMJ stan‚Äôd‚Äù for simply pointing out that no, Serge Ibaka did not take off ‚Äò2 feet behind the free throw line‚Äô [on this dunk](https://i.imgur.com/c9GXNW4.jpg). Good times!"
you didnt hear how much got released with out we handled the serge ibaka-gasol situation? lmao our fanbase is naive. also everyone and their grandma knew we were targeting giannis too.
Like serge ibaka but amazing at basketball.
Serge Ibaka of the 70s? He's 6'4.
"Its not like he had Kevin Durant, Serge Ibaka or James Harden.  How can you expect to win a championship with those guys?"
Serge Ibaka on steroids since Clyde is a 2 time champion HOFer! This is our guy &lt;3  You should see his suits
"Probably steph, harden, kyrie, Klay and... Serge Ibaka"
Serge Ibaka is the biggest Edit:Missed the word face
"Serge ""Sadomasochistist"" Ibaka in the house, good for him living his truth"
"Serge Ibaka: [hey, that's my joke](https://youtu.be/Thib9B0dxyY)"
"He had to start Greg Monroe in a game and had no bench whatsoever. What rotation issues did you have?   His main problem was that Kawhi Leonard shot a million percent from midrange, and that without Embiid on the court his choices at center were Amir Johnson and Greg Monroe. Nurse Had Serge Ibaka or Marc Gasoline at all times.   Losing the series is a cop out, if you want to criticize his coaching then actually criticize it."
This is incongruent with sanity.   Even the lakers would admit they'd much rather have ibaka    Serge is a much better all around player
"Oh 100% for example Serge Ibaka for you guys who I haven‚Äôt heard from in a bit because of his injury , god forbid something happens to rondo knowing his history, honestly anything could happen really and it‚Äôs just sad but best of luck to anyone who wins. Always nice seeing a team win their first anyways"
Segababa sounds like serge ibaka
Serge Ibaka looking like Freddy Krueger
"Eh, I disagree. Those opens threes are always going to be there. what helped the raptors win a championship is serge ibaka hitting a bunch of contested threes in that game 7 against the sixers. What helped them win a championship was Marcs defense and passing.   Him making one wide open three a game did not move the needle"
I'll throw out some crazy ones to get this going.      * Mike Conley- 3/70 to NYK (Team option/partially guaranteed 3rd year) * Serge Ibaka- 2/20 to the Spurs  * Lauri Markannen- 3/50 to Miami (I did say crazy)
"The clippers were missing Kawhi, Serge Ibaka and Patrick Beverly. Do you think Jae Crowder and Saric are even remotely close to who the clippers were missing?"
"What‚Äôs your definition of a role player? If it‚Äôs just a non-All Star without high usage (so not like a CJ McCollum), players like Mikal Bridges as you mentioned, and others like Joe Ingles, Serge Ibaka, Joe Harris, and Brook Lopez (who‚Äôs just a role player now) are all solid. Basically these guys would help any team but don‚Äôt require super high usage."
"Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Serge Ibaka exist.   Anyone who argues KD carried his team in the playoffs at any point when he's always had superstar caliber teammates is being disingenuous. You're on an AD hate train on this post, lmao. Don't be mad that he didn't wanna play for you guys"
No James Johnson or Serge Ibaka???
"If it's about players who's playing right now, I'd switch jae Crowder with Serge Ibaka.  Jae is the least tough from those 5. He's just ""acting tough"", just get in front of guys and talking. Instigator you could say.  Serge actually throw hands. And not just one time. Time and time again he throw hands at his opponent.  And switch Trez with Portis. Portis broke his teammate's face."
The serge ibaka corollary
"Did you miss out his OKC days? He built out his team around him. Russ though was very good, but he was still not as good as post KD OKC. Harden was a 6th man. Serge Ibaka was at best just a role player and not one of those guys who you could rely on to give a W."

"In the bubble Kelvin Benjamin approached Serge Ibaka and pulled him aside - ‚ÄúHey, that pizza (Serge's beef penis pizza) you gave me was good,‚Äù Ibaka recalls Benjamin telling him. ‚ÄúA lot of people don‚Äôt know I eat beef penis, and I don‚Äôt know a lot about it, but I know that shit was good.‚Äù"
Somehow Serge Ibaka is only 31
KD forgot about this guy for *Serge Ibaka*
He really hates Serge Ibaka
The fact that he mentioned Serge over russ üò© altho I just hate how the media did not even post the nxt few seconds after he mentioned ibaka
Do I need to post that famous Serge Ibaka meat pic?üçóüò≤
I understand that this is hyperbole but it literally is only Kawhi Leonard and Serge Ibaka. And Ibaka left cause the Raptors didn't offer him what he wanted in contract negotiations.
Never compare Chris Bosh or Serge Ibaka to Alex Caruso ever again
"1. Who lebron wants to play with most is not the same thing as a ranking of the best players. If anything, it's who he thinks is the best fit as his #2.  2. KD also thinks Serge Ibaka is better than Westbrook   3. Having a different player ranking is not a claim to know more about basketball"
Serge Ibaka is listed at 7 feet? Then I guess that‚Äôs my answer because that‚Äôs some bullshit lol
"Correction, im hearing its Enes Kanter over Serge Ibaka."
Serge Ibaka also comes to mind. I know he isn't 7'
Out for the Clips   Patrick Beverley (left hand fourth metacarpal fracture)   Paul George (rest)   Serge Ibaka (lower back tightness)   Reggie Jackson (rest)   Kawhi Leonard (right foot soreness)   Rajon Rondo  (right wrist inflammation)\]
"Between last year and this year Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka left town (and their age was showing anyway).  Kyle Lowry turned 35 and his age is showing.   Paskal Siakam, last year's break out star, suddenly can't hit threes. And they traded Norman Powell, who wasn't a star but was a solid player."
He's no Serge Ibaka. Sorry we stole your eye candy (not sorry)
Warriors have a team around him too. They hve a top 10 defense. The warriors have a multiple time all star in draymond. Okc without Westbrook had Reggie Jackson and serge  ibaka as the main help for Durant
"Is KD not closer with Ibaka than he is with Westbrook? Even in OKC they seemed like strictly teammates and not really the type to 'hang out' per say. KD was one one of Serge's YouTube videos fairly recently, its not a stretch that he'd remember Serge before Westbrook."
Talking heads are annoying but he's absolutely right there's no way you remember Serge Ibaka before Prime Westbrook who was your first great teammate lmao  Hope the Wizards fuck up the Nets from the play-in
He‚Äôs ok but he‚Äôs no Serge Ibaka
"LOL WHERE IS YOUR RESEARCH? LOL! A 4 year old can look at stats and copy and paste them without ever watching the games. You acting like the 2012 Thunder were trash is honestly pathetic. The thunder were an amazing team. They were favorites for the finals https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2012-nba-finals-thunder-favored-by-vegas-oddsmakers/ Lot's of analysts picked them to win. They beat former champs Dallas Mavericks, Kobe's Lakers ,and Duncans Spurs. The Thunder had really good depth and size. The Heat struggled with size, they had also struggled with the Pacers and Celtics going down 3-2. Harden was turing into a star, Serge Ibaka was second in voting for the defensive player of the year award, and Russ one of the best gaurds in the league. Durant is too athletic for Bosh, and has the height advantage over both Lebron and Wade. So the heat focused more of their defense to slow down Russ in transtion and load up against James. TAke the L my boy. You simply didn‚Äôt research before you opened your mouth. (Looking at stats then copy and paste is not research lol)."
You forgot top-5 all-time teammate Serge Mafuzzy Chef Ibaka.
" who was that guy I played with back in OKC? oh yeah Serge Ibaka, put him at #5"
"How do you forget about Russ when you bring Serge Ibaka ?  Would make sense if he said Draymond and some non Thunder dude but Ibaka and not Russ ?  Cmon man, he‚Äôs just petty as shit."
"How do you forget about Russ when you bring Serge Ibaka ?  Would make sense if he said Draymond and some non Thunder dude but Ibaka and not Russ ?  Cmon man, he‚Äôs just petty as shit."
"How do you forget about Russ when you bring Serge Ibaka ?   Would make sense if he said Draymond and some non Thunder dude but Ibaka and not Russ ?   Cmon man, he‚Äôs just petty as shit."
I'd have believed him if he didn't mention Serge Ibaka.
"Fate of the universe on the line, I want Serge Ibaka"
"&gt;(kawhi, danny, serge, ibaka)  Wow I didn't know we had both Serge and Ibaka, wut?  Jokes aside, Serge was huge off the bench, despite Gasol starting. 3 starters and one key rotation player is a lot."
"covid was huge, we'd at least be a playoff team if it weren't for all the cases and missed games. Baynes has been awful, and he's expected to replace serge and marc.. that said, since the championship we've lost 4 starters (kawhi, danny, serge, ibaka), none of us know what's going on with pascal (even though he's playing better, getting fined twice by your team for behavioural issues is mad suspicious)... and that's not mentioning we're not playing in out country and instead in a makeshift facitlity in the cesspool of america (where the fans are booing the ""hometeam"")..."
"Anyone who‚Äôs really strong and is a good low post defender. Guys like Gasol, Horford, and Serge Ibaka are good matchups for him"
And serge ibaka and pat bev
‚ÄúOmg and imagine you had somebody like Serge Ibaka‚Äù foh
Serge Ibaka anyhow
"Without Ibaka &amp; with Patterson in his place, I like Pat but the difference in talent between Serge and Pat is massive."
"No because you can actually see a viable way out for them due to their tanking, He has like 20 something high draft picks to change his franchise and has drafted 3 hall of fame mvps, serge ibaka, steven adams, and even immauel quickley who appears to be a very talented rookie. Now if they were to botch all of those picks over the next 4 years then maybe."
I blocked out that period of time we kept playing other centers next to Vuc for some reason.  We really stuck him with some garbage. Oh god I forgot Channing Fry as well.  It‚Äôs all coming back to me.  Serge Ibaka.  Eww
Orlando lost both while trading for and trading away Serge Ibaka
Serge (our starting center) ibaka is out for the year... only played 1 game in the playoffs
Clippers are missing a top 5 player and Serge Ibaka lol
His name is Serge Ibaka.
"There's been injuries to role players as well, they just don't get nearly as much attention. But Danny Green, KCP, De'Andre Hunter, Donte DiVincenzo, Alex Caruso, Will Barton, Serge Ibaka, etc all have missed time with injuries in these playoffs."
Every injury thread forgets Serge Ibaka
I swear everyone forgets that Serge Ibaka even exists. He was a relatively important player for the Clippers this season and he's out for the rest of the playoffs.
Serge Ibaka can come off the bench at some point.
"&gt; A sprain is a ligament tear. They already said it's a sprain, they just didn't disclose severity.   clippers always report things as vaguely as possible. Serge ibaka wasn't listed as out when he had back surgery the day of, neither was pat bev. In fact, pat bev was listed as questionable when he had hand surgery.   They always are as vague as possible. hoping for the best, but never trust a clippers report they put out to the press."
Serge Ibaka too
"He's absolutely lazy relatively speaking. Guys who used to have absolutely no outside shot like Serge Ibaka worked hard and added one. Brook Lopez took a grand total of seven three point attempts over his first six seasons. He's less athletic and mobile than Simmons, but he worked hard and now takes 300 threes a year. What's Ben's excuse?  This is a shooter's league right now and having a guard that literally does not shoot from the perimeter is crazy. There's no way the Sixers haven't been on him to develop a shot, but he hasn't. He takes even fewer shots beyond 10' than he did as a rookie. What's his excuse?"
Well you should probably pay Serge Ibaka before Harden
And put Serge Ibaka in there for good measure.
"You'd need a big to go alongside them though, just imagine if you added idk... Serge Ibaka for example?"
"This 100%   If serge Ibaka was healthy things would be different.  For all we know Conley comes back and the team has to make adjustments, which ends up being a negative for the jazz   Really can go either way"
"Idk what you're talking about, he totally shut down Serge Ibaka tonight"
"You mean the team that had second year Russel Westbrook, and first year James Harden and serge ibaka? You keep telling me I‚Äôm exposing myself but you‚Äôre just further poring my point, KD has never carried a team without an all-star talent with him.   They might have been early in their careers but that roster was definitely better than this warriors team, it isn‚Äôt even a debate."
"How you gonna call Mike Conleys injury minor, but list Serge Ibaka when the clippers don't even play him at all.."
The '11-'12 Thunder: PG: Westbrook / Derek Fisher / Reggie Jackson SG: James Harden / Thabo Sefolosha SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Serge Ibaka / Nick Collison C: Kendrick Perkins
"What's the question? He played with prime Westbrook, Reggie Jackson, and Serge Ibaka. They all had double digit PPG."
"Jae ""*Young* Serge Ibaka"" Crowder."
"I never said soley low picks. I said ""low picks and trades""  Did Kawhi, Marc Gasol, Danny Green, Serge Ibaka, Kyle Lowry, etc sign with the Toronto Raptors? They never did.  Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, and Fred VanVleet. All 3 of those guys were picked 27th, 46th, and last one was not even drafted.   The team never had a top/lottery pick drafted on their roster. They never signed a top guy in free agency. When Masai got there he didn't have a player who was considered anything but a maybe boderline all-star in Rudy Gay. That's it."
[He out due to back surgery](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/clippers-serge-ibaka-done-for-season-after-undergoing-surgery-on-ailing-back/)
Serge ‚ÄúSergery Onmybaka‚Äù Ibaka
yeah but Serge atleast leaves an interior presence to make Rudy think twice about crashing the paint.  No one else on the Clippers has been able to stop Rudy from getting easy buckets in the paint.  People forget that it was Gasol AND Ibaka that formed the wall to stop Giannis and Embiid in the paint on the Raps 2019 run.
"Serge ""Anthony ""Chris Paul"" Davis"" Ibaka"
"Mayweather's hand bones are powdered at this point. He isn't knocking anyone out for the rest of his life. Doesn't mean he wouldn't win a boxing match with any of them, but Serge Ibaka could throw Mayweather into the sun. Boxing has rules."
"Good point, you guys decided to pay Serge Ibaka instead. You don‚Äôt get clowned on that enough"
Kawhi stole serge ibaka just for this to happen
Well he certainly isn't Serge Ibaka level of fashionista
"So he plays with good spacing? What do you want him to do put himself in a non ideal situation where he knows he doesn't play well/suceed? He played how many years in OKC with the worst spacing in the league, his next best shooter was Serge Ibaka. He's playing with great spacing like most stars in this era are doing, Kawhi has statistically the best spacing in the league rn also KD is hitting 50% of his contested jumpers so..."
Is serge Ibaka hurt or something?
"Chucks not wrong but it‚Äôs hard to blame LBJ for going to Miami. His cavs squads were terrible and the org showed zero competency in building a roster like, oh say KD had in OKC (westbrook, harden, Derek Fisher, serge Ibaka, Adams). So Lebron did something about it. KD has never made a finals appearance without someone next to him who can drop 40 on any given night. That‚Äôs the difference"
"You mean 28.8/8.0/3.7 on 58TS% while having a 1 3PA per game at 36% Serge Ibaka as his best and most consistent shooter. Yeah, what a bum!"
Serge Ibaka
At least we‚Äôre probably still younger than serge ibaka
"Why defensive accolades are highly overrated; media heads and casual fans don't understand defense whatsoever. They just look at who can guard the best '1 on 1' and who can rack up stls &amp; blks.  Duncan being below Serge Ibaka is a fuckin crime no matter how you explain it away. Also why a lot of those smaller defenders from the 80s &amp; 90s who won those accolades are highly overrated compared to their accolades, particularly Jordan"
Tell that to serge ibaka
"reminds me of the raptors vs 76ers in playoffs 2 years ago  Cool nugget from Raptors very international team. Serge Ibaka speaks french to Pascal Siakam, spanish to Marc Gasol &amp; english to the rest team. When Serge &amp; Gasol doubled Joel Embiid they would yell where to help from in Spanish so Joel (who speaks french) could not understand."
"The guy needs to stay on the floor first. He‚Äôs played 126 games in three seasons, roughly a regular NBA season and a half; this is partly due to injury, partly because he‚Äôs has the misfortune of trying to develop during two COVID years. He also fouls out a lot, so staying on the floor on a game to game level is a challenge.  I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be nearly prime Chris Bosh level, but I also think he can be better than Serge Ibaka level- his career stats nearly match Serge‚Äôs, and his second year three point percentage is better. His defensive upside, particularly his flashes of both versatility and rim protection, are valuable- I think he‚Äôs a better rim protector than the last few years of Ibaka have been. I think his ceiling is an All-Star level guy with All-Defense upside; I doubt his ultimate offense ability puts him into that elite tier of KAT/Jokic/Embiid Cs, but he could easily reach the level of Capela/Turner/prime Nurkic/Sabonis."
I see him being a fusion of Rashard Lewis and Serge Ibaka which is pretty great.   I've seen a lot people say he's a skinny Jokic but I don't really see that.
"I mean, Giannis at least played well in Game 1 of the Semifinals. Paul George, on the other hand...  Should also be noted that Paul George has better teammates than Giannis does (I'd take Kawhi Leonard, Marcus Morris, Serge Ibaka, and Lou Williams in a heartbeat over Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, and Brook Lopez)."
"* Zach Lavine $19m a year. * Lu Dort $1.4m a year. * Brogdon $20m a year. * Myles Turner $17m a year. * Sabonis $19m a year. * Capela $18m a year. * DRose $7m a year. * Nerlens Noel $5m a year. * Monte Morris $9m a year. * Royce O‚ÄôNeal $8.5m a year. * Maxi Kleber $8m a year. * Dorian Finney-Smith $4m a year. * Serge Ibaka $9m a year.  Bogdan is a better player than some of these guys, but that doesn‚Äôt mean his contract is a better value."
Did someone say Serge Ibaka?
"Lol yes, Serge Ibaka is an equal contributor to Mike Conley."
"The Hawks should give this core another year.    I think they need a defensive power forward.  They should look to move Danillo Gallinari for a defense-first player in my opinion.  They can give the keys to Kevin Huerter to be the number one option off the bench.  Perhaps Serge Ibaka?  Dorian Finney-Smith?  John Collins' value looks a bit low, so they should probably hold and look to do something next offseason via a sign-and-trade."
"&gt;he‚Äôs worth way more than the MLE  I mean, not really?  Did Trez have an above average season, yes.  But 1) fans discount defense in favor of offensive stats and 2) fans also don't seem realize the contracts of certain role players.     This year, Jae Crowder, Derrick Favors, Serge Ibaka, and Tristan Thompson all made MLE.  They don't necessarily put up the numbers that Trez does, but they are all likely more reliable players for a playoff team as they aren't huge defensive sieves.  The year before that, Seth Curry, Derrick Rose, and Tyus Jones all signed for roughly the full MLE, while other good players like Bullock, JaMychal Green, Richauln Holmes, and Rodney Hood all signed for less.     Literally every single one of those guys has an argument for being a more useful player for a contending team looking for playoff success than Trez.  Trez absolutely has a market, but it's smaller given his playstyle (which is good for the regular season, but difficult to play in the playoffs).    Saying that he deserve ""way more than MLE"" is silly, because substantially more useful players get MLE all the time."
"So your saying KD has surrounded himself around shooters and his next best shooter isn't Serge Ibaka. Isn't that good? In OKC they would send doubles his way because they had no shooters and now with good shooters, not even absurd ones like in GSW, he's still good."
I thought people were calling Serge Ibaka ‚ÄúSir Chewbacca‚Äù
"&gt;KD never disrespectful of other baller.  When asked to list the top 5 players he's ever played with he picked Serge Ibaka over Russell Westbrook.  Kyrie Irving  James Harden  Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Serge Ibaka  Serge was on the team when he roasted it with the burner account saying him and Russ were the only good players and ""he couldn't win with those cats.""   KD has absolutely disrespected other ballers."
Of course he can :)  PG: Damian Lilliard  SG: Klay Thompson  SF: Jaylen Brown  PF: Serge Ibaka  C: Deandre Ayton
"Draymond green, Marc Gasol/ Serge Ibaka, AD....all great defensive centers"
"  DeAndre Jordan , George Hill , Jusuf Nurkic, Serge Ibaka, Pat Beverly, Montrezl Harrell ,  Steven Adams, Ricky Rubio, TJ Warren , Jeremy Lamb, Kevin Love, Thad Young,, Al Farouq Aminu, Tomas Satoransky, Gary Harris, Terrace Ross, Danillo Gallinari, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Terry Rozier, Harrison Barnes, Al Horford."
"According to Length, Size, &amp; Girth I'd pick Serge Ibaka.        If I had to choose based on Shape &amp; Thiccness obviously Kyle Lowry.    üçÜüí¶"
I feel like the Clippers have the coolest names in the NBA but man Serge Ibaka definitely wins.
"tightness has kept serge ibaka out for months with the exception of three games between the end of regular season and start of round 1, so honestly, it could be anything"
The Clippers are going to need Serge Ibaka if they're going to match up with Utah in the paint.
They're the most complete team with Ibaka on the floor.  Dallas aren't getting most of those offensive rebounds w/ Serge out there.  He's also been a great rim protector.
Serge Ibaka on the bench lookin‚Äô like he should host the Masked Singer in that jacket
Serge Ibaka
That's the most normal outfit Serge Ibaka has worn all season
Serge Ibaka just here to show off his wardrobe
I was referring to Serge Ibaka
Serge Ibaka was also drafted as a Sonic.
It‚Äôs not a ridiculous standard lol - you‚Äôre just making stuff up to argue your point.  You legit call Luka ‚Äúnot full healthy‚Äù despite he can actually see time on the court. Ibaka can legit not play - I get you‚Äôre probably not watching but he only saw minutes in Game 1 - I don‚Äôt know how you call Luka ‚Äúnot fully healthy‚Äù but then call the Clippers who haven‚Äôt had Serge ‚Äúfully healthy‚Äù - you‚Äôre contradicting yourself
Serge Ibaka if we're going by his listed age. Pretty sure he's actually older than me though.
Yeah before hand i think the odds maker were still expecting some role players playing well also. Also serge ibaka is out. Lakers have the most top heavy team in the playoffs their team garbage. Clippers have the most complete team on the league..in the league but no one is beating kyrie hardin and kd.
"Barcelona has 3 championships (Pau has 2 and Marc has 1) if you count Serge Ibaka who played in the area as a teenager, then he bumps them to 4."
"Exactly. Right now Kawhi could be resting his chronic injury, and their other vets could be resting from their nagging injuries as well (most notably Serge Ibaka)."
"Dame has literally no help. McCollum is a third option maybe 4th on a good team. OKC had Russell Westbrook, Steven Adam's, Serge Ibaka, Enes Kanter and Dion Waiters all who were good at the time. Not to mention Andre Roberson who was shooting lights out in the playoffs that year. The idea that KD left a crap team to join GS is just wrong. Was OKC the greatest team ever assembled? No. But they beat the 60 win Spurs team."
Serge Ibaka is only 31?! I feel like he‚Äôs been around way longer than that.
Rim protection means nothing when the Nets play 5 out. Serge Ibaka and Zubac btw
"Serge Ibaka was listed 7‚Äô0 on Google and bballref for quite a year after the whole league mandated measurement stuff, his height just got fixed back to 6‚Äô10 recently.. It‚Äôs not that the league measurements are inaccurate, it‚Äôs the loss of translation between sites and these reports/ typos happens and players at Luka age do grow."
"Sure your staff can measure it for all they want but the problem of these reports are the mistranslation between sites, for example Google n bballref had listed Serge Ibaka as 7‚Äô0 tall for last season and just fixed it to 6‚Äô10 recently"
"Brook Lopez, serge Ibaka Montrezl Harrell Dwight Howard all guys with under 15 mil contracts"
"If Serge Ibaka took viagra, would he be the best low post defender in the game?"
I know that‚Äôs a running joke but idk about Serge Ibaka anymore lol
Imagine if they had Serge Ibaka and James Harden too
"&gt; Westbrook also needs to hit the pavement to recruit veterans like George Hill, Serge Ibaka, Trevor Ariza, Javale Magee, Dwight Howard and other vet minimum players.  Why would most of these guys leave the teams they are currently on, especially those getting playing time, to be on a bad team?   In what world would Serge Ibaka for example, rather play with Westbrok and a Beal that barely squeak into the playoffs as opposed to PG and Kawhi that , while still potentially leaving in the first round, are a far better team?  &gt; I just want the Wizards to learn from Presti and just cut everyone shorter than Westbrook with shorter wingspan.   One of Presti's biggest downfalls is that he did a dogshit job of building around Westbrook's weaknesses.  It took Morey literally 3 months to figure out that you can't have a guy like Andre Roberson share the floor with a non-shooter like Russ, but here we are talking about how there can't be anybody shorter than Russ on the floor, which doesn't make any sense.  There's a lot of room between ""hey don't play 4 guards"" and ""hey don't play anyone shorter than Westbrook.""    Westbrook needs a very specific type of big to really space out the floor and frankly there aren't many of those in the league.  He needs (ideally) a guy that can play the traditional style of big *and* a guy that can go out on the perimeter and spread the floor for Russ to drive to the rim.  There aren't a ton of guys like that and they are usually fairly expensive."
"&gt;Westbrook also needs to hit the pavement to recruit veterans like George Hill, Serge Ibaka, Trevor Ariza, Javale Magee, Dwight Howard and other vet minimum players.    I thought i had a stroke for a second.  How on earth does that help ANYTHING."
"Isn't that Serge ""Bif Penus"" Ibaka"
Serge Ibaka
Is that Serge Ibaka that‚Äôs dressed like a large moth?
Serge Ibaka be cooking donkey dick for Luke Kennard on next episode of how hungry are you
That‚Äôs Serge Ibaka
Serge Ibaka looking like Cyrus from The Warriors
"Why is Serge Ibaka wearing a golden bathrobe and, more importantly, why is it working?"
"The point is that saying ‚ÄòPascal averaged 20 PPG on 50% shooting in the finals‚Äô is stupid when he was also playing with Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry whom were considered the two stars of the team, and the rest of the team composed of Marc Gasol, Serge Ibaka, and Fred Vanvleet.   Randle would be an outstanding third option, because that‚Äôs much easier than having to be the #1 and be gameplanned against every game.   There‚Äôs a reason why Pascals efficiency dropped 10% after Kawhi left. It‚Äôs just basic common sense. #1 option= very hard. #3 option= much easier"
"Don‚Äôt care, still had another veteran all star to take the load off of him, along with Fred Vanvleet, Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka. Compare that team in talent to this years Knicks lmfao, Julius Randle has to be the #1 guy every night and is the guy the defense game plans around.   You can‚Äôt compare that to a guy who‚Äôs playing with two allstar teammates, one who‚Äôs a mega-star that carries the load every game. Julius is getting game planned for, Pascal wasn‚Äôt.   Also, what time does Pascals team play today?"
"Mikal bridges, tj warren, Terrance Ross, serge ibaka, pj tucker, tony ""100 percent free throw shooter"" Snell."
"By the way, that roster had some pretty good role players on it. Serge ibaka, Reggie Jackson, Derrick fisher, perkins... that's plenty to win with."
"I think I‚Äôd target one of Serge Ibaka, John Collins, or Richaun Holmes.  Despite his age and recent slide, I think I might take a first crack at Ibaka. I think the Celtics are much too young, and need as much championship-proven talent as they can get. I think a frontcourt with Ibaka and Tristan is pretty good. There‚Äôs championship experience there.  I‚Äôd also try to upgrade at PG. I doubt he‚Äôd come to Boston, but Chris Paul would be a big shakeup. I think he could keep Tatum and Brown well fed.  DeRozan might be my second choice. I want someone who has scoring ability, but also a healthy passing/assist game.  Maybe have Jabari be our first wing off the bench. Smart be the first guard. Robert Williams the first big.  A certain segment of Celtics fandom thinks Williams is the next big thing. I‚Äôm not convinced, but I certainly wouldn‚Äôt complain if he is.   What I fully expect, is that Ainge will run it back with this same group. And I think it would work if Kemba‚Äôs knee hadn‚Äôt turned into a fucking mortar and pestle the moment he landed at Logan.  Frankly, I think we‚Äôd have a better team * right now*, if we had kept IT and Horford around. Kyrie was a mistake that Ainge never should have made. He‚Äôs been trying to make up for it ever since, and that strikes me as a general still fighting his previous battle, rather than preparing for the next.  I don‚Äôt think Ainge sucks, exactly. But I do think, thanks to the Kyrie experiment, that he‚Äôs behind the curve right now, rather than ahead of it.  I also think his almost pathological *need* to ‚Äòfleece‚Äô every potential trade partner has cost him some real opportunities to improve the team.  He‚Äôs not acting like 07/08 Ainge. And that‚Äôs the guy we need right now.  I don‚Äôt know. I think we *could have* beat the Nets if we were at full health. I‚Äôll comfortably pit Tatum and Brown against Durant and Harden. I‚Äôll happily throw a (healthy, admittedly Charlotte-era) Kemba at Kyrie.  But Kemba will never be the guy he was, and that just needs to be addressed.  I think I‚Äôm going in circles now‚Ä¶"
Serge Ibaka was the best shooter they had from 3 lmao
Wrong we missing serge ibaka
"You can‚Äôt do it to another person‚Äôs face, that‚Äôs taunting. But people do it to the crowd all the time.   Serge Ibaka did it a ton on the Raps."
Serge Ibaka- LA Clippers   Someone who‚Äôs never played for the Raptors would James Harden
"Just 4-5 years ago this team would've killed  C: Rudy Gobert / DeAndre Jordan / Clint Capella / Jusuf Nurkic  PF: Kevin Love / Serge Ibaka / Zach Randolph  SF: Jae Crowder / Tim Hardaway Jr. / Khris Middleton  SG: Klay Thompson / Buddy Hield / Gary Harris  PG: Jrue Holiday / Tony Parker  Love, Holiday, Klay and Gobert were all all star level players in '16-18"
"Oh yeah, and if he can snag another 42 (plus however many more Serge gets) or Serge Ibaka retires before him, he will become the **active** leader in all 5 stats"
Serge Ibaka at #8 for rebounds is a surprise. Especially given he only has 11 playoff season compared to nearly everyone else in the top 10 with 13+
"I know Luka is injured, but give some credit to the LA for holding them to 81 points, and 16% from 3. Things aren't looking good for the Mavs, the Clips found their groove, and the next two games are at the Clippers arena, if Serge Ibaka comes back, it's probably best to not bet on the Mavericks."
Translation: *Serge Ibaka wants no association with the Clippers imploding in yet another playoffs.*
"Historically, the Spurs and Thunder are a goldmine for this. KD and Serge Ibaka. Just imagine KD but great at defense.  Also Harden and Ibaka, or Westbrook and Harden or KD. Westbrook and Harden would be an efficient Westbrook with better playmaking.   Tim Duncan and Manu combined would be nuts as would Tim Duncan and Tony Parker."
"Which fits in with the Clippers curse. If you think that's just relegated to only affecting Chris Paul, [you need to look at their history](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/090624&amp;sportCat=nba) and everyone else associated with them. Look at the injury issues Blake Griffin has had, which all started for him literally in his first pre-season with the Clippers and have continued after they traded him. Look at what Kawhi is dealing with right now. Look at how often Patrick Beverley gets hurt, how he missed a full season injured as a Clipper. Look at Serge Ibaka out with back injuries all year and now may miss all of next season with back surgery. Look at Zubac fucking up his knee. Look at Paul George's shoulder issues and his persistent hamstring problems. That shit is real."
"&gt;Serge Ibaka wrapped a giant scarf around his neck, went to battle with certified Fit Legend‚Ñ¢ Kyle Kuzma, and emerged a victor.  This gives me ""hello, fellow kids, I too am hip"" vibes"
"A medicore move that benefits both teams - a Bledsoe for PatBev swap.  What do the Clippers need? Playmaking, and unfortunately they don't have a lot of opportunity to get solid playmakers. For all of Bledsoe's shortcomings, he's a decent playmaker who averaged 6 assists a game last time he was in the playoffs for the Bucks. Ideally, Serge Ibaka or small lineups can cover for his lack of a 3-ball as well.   What do the Pelicans need? Shooting and defense. They need that in droves around Zion. PatBev provides that and a veteran presence. He can also play well with Lonzo if they choose to re-sign him.  It's an ugly trade, but a plausible one for both parties."
Serge Ibaka. No further questions your honor
Serge ibaka
"My dude the suns played against clippers missing KAWHI LEONARD AND SERGE IBAKA..   Kawhi was having a legendary post season before he got hurt..ibaka would've made it even easier for kawhi to score cause ibaka would force ayton to the 3 pt line.     Nuggets were missing JAMAL MURRAY who was having MULTIPLE 50 POINT GAMES last post season.. and who had an INJURED MPJ..  lakers had LEBRON KCP AND AD ALL injured..   I'm sorry but when 2 of 3 of the best players in ur last 3 series are hurt, those stats don't mean shit lmao"
"Hot take, Serge Ibaka played like 6-7 years in OKC and his trade was definitely a hard pill to swallow for fans. However right it was."
Serge Ibaka already plays in the NBA
"""If I'm Serge Ibaka I'm naming my first son Dirk"" -Van Gundy"
If I was Serge Ibaka I'd name my first son Dirk is probably the most savage thing any announcer has said during a game
Serge Ibaka revenge game was an all timer. Easily the best player the Thunder ever traded away.
Hot take but Im guessing Serge Ibaka did not get the standing ovation OKC gave him upon returning when he played his first game in Orlando after being traded to Toronto
How many (straight) girls are we in this subs ? For having this discussion with my girl friends (because thats the only way they get interested in basketball) most common answers are :  - pretty boy Oubre JR - Serge Ibaka - Ben Simmons - Devin Booker - Jordan Clarkson - Rudy Gobert (that's the french pride) - Kevin Love -  Danilo Gallinari - JJ redick - Dlo - Dame - Beal  But big big hype on boys like Simmons Oubre and Booker they ar every popular (among my friends and women talk on the internet).
"rick fox, grant hill, serge ibaka"
"Lol what. Yeah, every team should get Kawhi Leonard, Serge Ibaka, and Pascal Siakam, so easy."
Toronto did it building a wall with Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka.
"&gt;Weird without that ""lucky"" player you guys arent even in the playoffs  If by lucky player, you mean:  Kawhi Leonard Danny Green  Marc Gasol Serge Ibaka  Sure. And post-Leonard we were still one of the most successful teams in the East. Even went on our longest winning streak in team history. It's only after our team lost both centres that we went to seed.   &gt;When Demar Derozan is your ""franchise player"" you know your not a good franchise.   Pre-Leonard, the Raptors were a successful team in the East. Despite all the hate DeRozan is getting in this thread, he lead us to our first ECF. Something Embiid, so far, hasn't managed.  &gt;Upgrading from Derozan to arguably the best player in the league, ""risky"".  Lol. The revisionism is amazing. And didn't Morey pass on a perfectly healthy Harden for Simmons? Seems like it was more than just luck to pull that trigger on a superstar who hadn't played in a year, disgruntled and coming off major injury."
"The best for me was when he said ""If I'm Serge Ibaka, I'm naming my first son Dirk."" during the 2011 WCF. He was golden in the booth that entire series honestly. If you just watch Dirk's Game 1 highlights on youtube, you can hear some great bits from JVG."
"It‚Äôs kinda possible. Serge Ibaka and Nikola Mirotic play for Spain, Mike Tobey plays for Slovenia and Andray Blatche represents the Philippines for instance. I believe there‚Äôs a cap of one of those players per national team, so Spain cant play Ibaka and Mirotic together."
I mean Spain got within 6 of the US team at the Brazil Olympics.  And the Spaniards were missing Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka.
Also Serge Ibaka
With young Serge Ibaka coming off the bench!
Victor Oladipo and the draft pick that became Domantas Sabonis for a Serge Ibaka that didn't want to play for the Magic and got traded 6 months later.
Lol did you even watch that series?   I don‚Äôt even know if you could say serge ibaka outplayed Perkins.
You tell me the rebuilding team that trades a young Oladipo for Serge Ibaka and I‚Äôll call you a liar because nobody rebuilding does that.
"Anybody who says kd‚Äôs rings have an asterisk idiots. They were clearly the best team in the league those years. Same thing with the nets had they won, theres no asterisk on the ring. For the kd, Kyrie, harden yeah it doesn‚Äôt look great that they teamed up to get an easy one but still.   The difference between this finals run of the suns and the raptors playoff run is that literally every single one of the teams the suns have played have been missing superstar players, 3 straight series. The bucks are healthy for the most part, but let‚Äôs be honest about the bucks too, they almost lost to KD and harden on one leg. The bucks have some series consistency issues with Middleton and holiday, even Giannis as great as he is is somewhat limited. My point is that the suns not only avoided the best version of the first 3 teams they played, but they also avoided the nets.   The argument every suns fan uses to counter the facts above is that the 2019 raptors wouldn‚Äôt have won their title without injuries as well. while they might be right, there is no doubt in anybody‚Äôs mind that the raptors were the second best team that year. They proved that in beating the sixers with Simmons, embiid, butler and then the bucks, in 6. Those were both great teams. Then in the finals kd and klay got injured.  My point here is that yeah injuries are a part of every title run, nobody can avoid them. But this suns team has really gotten so incredibly fortunate with teams missing their best players and then completely avoiding the best team in the East.   If im being completely honest I don‚Äôt think there is a chance in hell the suns make it to the finals if the teams they play are healthy. You could argue that the suns would have beaten the lakers or nuggets, but there is literally 0 chance they beat the clippers if kawhi alone is healthy. Not to mention serge ibaka and zubac.   Every game besides game 6 was close as hell with the clippers and the clippers were missing a top 3 playoff performer and a pretty good starting center. If you‚Äôre a suns fan I don‚Äôt even know how you could talk yourself into thinking the suns beat the clippers healthy.  This is probably the easiest road to a ring I‚Äôve ever seen. CP deserves it and the rest of the league getting so injured was probably karma for chris Paul because he‚Äôs had so many injuries. I‚Äôm happy for the suns and suns fans, but if this season doesn‚Äôt have an asterisk no season has an asterisk. The stupid ass Mickey Mouse ring argument was and still is stupid, there is no doubt in my mind the lakers were the best team last year. I also have no doubt in my mind the suns aren‚Äôt the best team this year and I don‚Äôt even believe they are top 3. This has been the easiest walk to a finals ever, and is like a 3 if I had to rank it out of 10."
Add in someone like Serge Ibaka and that's a championship squad for sure
"The fact that you think 2012 was the toughest western conference era ever shows how little you pay attention to basketball. Lol. And last I checked, your argument was ‚ÄúAD cannot win without a top 3 player‚Äù KD had russel Westbrook, James harden, and serge ibaka, and still couldn‚Äôt win so‚Ä¶also the lakers still would have lost this year because lebron was injured my guy. Had dame played the same number of games AD did in the bubble and then had as little rest, he probably would‚Äôve been injured too lol."
"I'd even throw Cam Payne, Enes Kanter and Serge Ibaka to an extent."
"If Serge Ibaka ain't on your list, your list is wrong."
"Right now, Basketball Reference has him at 0.28%, which puts him just ahead of Gordon Hayward, Serge Ibaka, and Jeff Teague. A championship win only moves it to 0.63%. A ring might cement a place for him in the rafters in Milwaukee, but he's still pretty far from the HoF."
Cam Reddish - Paul George   DeAndre Hunter - Kawhi Leonard lite  Michael Porter Jr - Brandon Ingram  Patrick Williams - Jimmy Butler  Onyeka Okongwu - Lanky Serge Ibaka  RJ Barrett - Danny Granger  Kevin Porter Jr - Dollar Store Harden
My dude you are buggin.  Lakers had Lebron AD and Kcp injured (their 3 best players )  Nuggets had Murray who had 50 point games last post season and MPJ injured.. 2 of their 3 best players..  And clippers had Kawhi fuckin Leonard AND serge ibaka injured..   No body can say suns were favorites in all those series with both sides fully healthy  You are straight up trippin I'm sorry

"It's also weird at how arbitrary the asterisk thing gets. The 2014 Spurs are probably the last year I can think of where nobody really downplayed their championship run, even if there *were* elements like Serge Ibaka being injured and Dwyane Wade aging overnight. But then you have the 2015 Warriors, who built on the same concept of ball movement and great shooting, winning 67 wins and the title and all everyone can bring up are Irving and Love getting hurt."
Ibaka never made ALL STAR in his entire career. Bosh is an 11 time All Star. Lol. Harden never made All Star in OKC. Wade made All Star all 4 years in Miami with Lebron. Lol. Harden was not even close to All Star level in OKC. His best season was 16.8 points and 3.7 assists. Bosh best year was 24/11. Serge was Solid but not even close to All Star. Serges best year with KD was 15 points and 9 rebounds. Again solid role players but not even close to an All Star. Serge has played on many winning teams but has never made All Star or All NBA. Facts are facts. KD Thunder never had 3 All Stars and never were a super team.
Lol people tried to argue for that fast break thing before and it ain‚Äôt it bruh. Serge Ibaka had to hush the fan in the arena down as he helped KD up in the timeout.  What‚Äôs your take on this tho:  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bzbn6h/raptors_fans_in_jurassic_park_start_a_fuck_kd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf  Also in that same thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bzbn6h/raptors_fans_in_jurassic_park_start_a_fuck_kd/eqs3q7t/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3
"[Serge Ibaka, Avec Classe](https://www.holtrenfrew.com/en/stories/avec-classe-serge-ibaka)"
Serge Ibaka was on the list when he was drafted but now he‚Äôs on the Tony La Russa/Steve Kerr All-Stars
"Patrick Beverly, Serge Ibaka, Rondo are all expiring contracts.   They have a valuable young chip in Terance mann for a combined 3.2million over the next two seasons.   They have whomever they draft in the first round this season.   To think they don't have any flexibility in making moves is a bit weird."
"My God I know , just goes to show how much there is always to learn and humble yourself I was sure myself Bidi Bid BAMBA2PHX was gonna anchor the defense in gobert + type of ways and have that serge ibaka jumper while being a lob and putback machine... I did worry about DA‚Äùs Hands and attitude but his hands are hit or miss he catches hella lobs and post entry passes acrobatically but as us Suns fans knows still fumbles from time to time bounce passes and gets stripped too easily but this playofff run has shown DA can improve on that and hold it down in ways I never knew.... üôèüåÖü§û‚ù§Ô∏èüåπüòâüíµüí∞‚úçÔ∏èüëÇüó£üëÅüåäü•ÇüçæüèÄüèÄüèÄüõπüèÇü•äüåáüï∞üßøüîÆüééüíå‚ô•Ô∏èüí¨üîõüîùüîúüé∂‚òØÔ∏èüíü‚òÆÔ∏èüèÜüèÜüèÜüìøüìøüìø"
Serge Ibaka thinking any direct flights to the YYZ from LAX ?
Reggie Jackson is probably the only likeable guy on this team. Him and Serge Ibaka
"Do we even know if Ibaka is gonna play next year? He just had back surgery. That shit kept MPJ out a full year, and he's much younger than Serge is."
I wonder what a series with Serge Ibaka and Kawhi would have been like.
Serge and Ibaka?
"Combination of fatigue and having Serge, Kawhi, and Ibaka out with PG is the numba one option"
Adjustments for next year:  * Replacement for Reggie as im sure he'll leave and get more money as he deserves. * Serge Ibaka for some height * Please remove Pat Bev just for tainting team character lol
Where‚Äôs enforcer serge ibaka when you need him
Damn this Clipper team turning Demarcus Cousins into Serge Ibaka with those shots.
"They really are not that deep. Aside from Kawhi, Serge Ibaka is also injured, and Rondo has played like ass. IF Pg leads them to a title wihtkjj another all star player, it‚Äôs more than AD, Luka and Embiid have accomplished this or any other post season"
I mean we also didn't have Serge Ibaka or Pat Bev for half the season. Or PG for 28 games. Yet we were only 4 games behind you guys.  To say we would've bumped you down to 2nd isn't unrealistic.
I‚Äôd love for him to develop into a better Serge Ibaka.
Ehh I mean he put the right amount of pressure on Clippers Organization to make the right trades who are now in a deep playoff run even wo him. His signing in LA also attracted former teammates like Serge Ibaka so I disagree
Yeah but I‚Äôm speaking just strictly from the optics ! To be in the VIP booth while your team is in the western conference playoffs while serge Ibaka has been courtside every game - says more about kawhi and his leadership than anything else . Optically -it‚Äôs a terrrrrible look .
"Also Harden, AD, CP (kinda), Embiid, Jaylen Brown, Serge Ibaka, and so many other players. Whoever makes the finals with at least one star will automatically win."
Here I‚Äôll do it with out including a player being paid more than 20 mil AAV besides Ben and no rookies sound fair?   PG: Dejounte Murray - 16 Mil AAV  SG: Norman Powell - 10.4 AAV  SF: TJ Warren - 11.7 AAV  PF: Christian Wood - 13.6 AAV  C: Ben Simmons  6th Man: Jordan Clarkson - 12.8 AAV  Backup Center for Point Simmons: Serge Ibaka - 9.4 AAV
"No Serge Ibaka (Season ending back surgery)  Joe Ingles finishing 2nd beside (Jordan Clarkson) for 6th man of the year.  List can go on and on.  &amp;#x200B;  Jazz has accomplish nothing in their franchise history but my word do you guys talk so much shit just cause you got the 1st seed this season.  (To be fair the Clippers haven't done shit since it's entire existence as well)  But to go out and say I'm a Ignorant rebranded Lakers fan, when you can't even look at the other side of the argument and just go with  ""Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley is injured reason why we lost"" ""You're ignorant AF""  Get out of here with that weak petty shit.  &amp;#x200B;  Jazz fan have the same mentality as their roster.  They just give up and fold and just look for the easiest excuse."
"OK, sure. Then let's use their shooting splits against the Warriors since they had the same opponents and both series went 7. Similar sample size.

"OKC as a team has horrible spacing. They were just not very well put together. They did do very well because of their two stars but ultimately wouldn't be enough.

thunder flipped serge ibaka for paul george which got them shai and a ton of picks lol
The Magic when they traded for Serge Ibaka. Our GM was on the hot seat and made a move to at least make the playoffs but it failed.
"Don't forget, we're missing Serge Ibaka too.  Easy to forget since he's been out most of the regular season, but you can imagine the impact he would have had in this series if he were healthy."
Center minutes on the last five NBA championship teams  2020 Lakers: JaVale McGee / Dwight Howard (16.6 / 18.9 mpg)  2019 Raptors: Serge Ibaka / Marc Gasol (27.2 / 24.9 mpg)  2018 Warriors: Zaza Pachulia / JaVale McGee / Jordan Bell (14.1 / 9.5 / 14.2 mpg)  2017 Warriors: Zaza Pachulia / JaVale McGee (18.1 / 9.6 mpg)  2016 Cavaliers: Tristan Thompson / Timofey Mozgov (27.7 / 17.4 mpg)
"The talk about the loss of Ibaka has been way quieter than it should be  Especially a series like Utah where you were trying to run small to limit Gobert's impact, somone like Serge to scoop boards and take 3's would be huge  Also brings that championship experience"
"Genuine question for Clips fans, has the loss of Serge Ibaka really impacted you guys this postseason? Was he really that of a game changer during the regular season?"
Give me some Serge Ibaka
"And Serge Ibaka, and Donte DiVincenzo"
And who else are you talking about besides Kawhi?  Serge Ibaka has been out since the Dallas series and I would argue Zubac has done more than enough to fill in.    CP3 is huge to this team and pretending like it was ‚Äújust‚Äù some player would be like me pretending like Kawhi was just some player.  Thus the teams were on equal ground by all accounts.  Maybe now as of yesterday you could say the Suns are in a better position but that came after the Clippers once again put themselves in a huge hole when they had every opportunity to climb out.
"What? 2019 Raptors:  Lowry, FVV, Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Siakam, Serge Ibaka, Marc Gasol, Norm Powell, Chris Boucher‚Ä¶  They were stacked. They won the ship and probably would have ran it back the next year if they kept their horses.  A healthy Nets from this year would beat them but not sure any other team would in 7 games."
"Serge Ibaka opts out and joins us on the MLE  Sign and trade Dinwiddie for a solid bench piece or a trade exception  Re-sign Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, and Blake  Kyrie, KD and Harden go on a vacation together and develop an ability to speak only with their minds"
"Yeah, but if you think about it an injured Kawhi Leonard and Serge Ibaka had the Jazz exactly where they wanted em. And then injuries struck, I have no doubt in my mind that if the Clippers were fully healthy, [we] would be in our way to the NBA Finals"
They would benefit from someone like Serge Ibaka and Kyle Lowery I think. Serge is a good defender and shooter who could space the floor. Kyle would be a reliable pg who can bring the best out of anyone while not being a complete liability on defense (I think)
Lebron-Anthony Davis  Jamal Murray  Kawhi Leonard-Serge Ibaka  There‚Äôs the example. It‚Äôs not his fault obviously but it‚Äôs a pretty factual statement that CP3 has benefitted from injuries this year.
why is the guy not sitting on the bench and supporting his squad courtside? serge ibaka is doing that so i don‚Äôt see why kawhi can‚Äôt
"Just imagine this series if Serge ""the purge"" ibaka was playing"
"The lack of spacing killed that OKC team, their best shooter in the playoffs that year was Serge Ibaka."
"&gt;I agree paying Allen reduces his value but I have no idea what his contact demands even are.  With the current market I dont think there's any way he doesnt get at least 20m/year. Clint Capela was traded for pick 17, and he made less than that at the time. Serge Ibaka was traded for TRoss and pick 25 and Ibaka back in 2017 was considered much better than Jarrett Allen"
what in the world is Serge Ibaka wearing??
Serge Ibaka. He's doing fashion things.
Serge ibaka
I think it's Serge Ibaka
That serge ibaka fit though
If Suggs is Jrue Holiday then Mobley is Serge Ibaka LOL
"Counterpoint... Maybe the clippers shouldn't have built their roster around a bunch of injury prone people and aging veterans.  You can't be shocked when Serge Ibaka, Leonard, Rondo, and PG aren't making it through a full season healthy..."
"Kelly Oubre handsome but he's not all that he's just lightskin. Serge Ibaka, Chris Paul, Jimmy Butler, and a few others are better looking imo"
It's a series where Serge Ibaka would have been hugely helpful (not to mention Kawhi).   They have slow-footed centers in Zu and Boogie and the next step down size-wise is their litany of perimeter wing players. Ayton is who they need to adjust for and they can't go small due to his touch inside. They also can't go small while staying big (like Lakers with AD at the 5).
Tracy McGrady- Overrated  Serge Ibaka- Underrated
Speaking to Serge Ibaka?  &amp;#x200B;  \*i know it's a reference.
"They had a big‚Ä¶ Serge Ibaka is out. Their best player is also out. WCF was a new milestone so thats a good step forward.  I agree Zubac is not it. Nurkic, Howard, and Robin Lopez might be solid choices"
Serge Ibaka is not playing
"I don't think the team disclosed the exact nature of the injury but Serge talked briefly about it.  It sounded like a herniated disc.  &gt;I have a pinched nerve [...] When your nerves come from your disc and go down in your legs, it‚Äôs more nerves.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10005506-clippers-serge-ibaka-undergoes-season-ending-surgery-on-back-injury"
Luka or serge ibaka idk
I don't agree that Orlando would be a high pick in the Karma draft. They have been picking in the lottery regularly since Dwight left.  Their best drafted player is Oladipo and they traded him and what became Sabonis for an aging Serge Ibaka.  Very fun idea though!
Lmfao are you serious ‚Äúask anyone on the team‚Äù I didn‚Äôt realize you were such close personal friends with everyone from the ‚Äò19 team. Why don‚Äôt you shoot them some texts and ask them for me. I‚Äôm a Kawhi Leonard fan. I‚Äôve followed him since his rookie season. Meaning I followed the ‚Äò19 Raptors. Kawhi Leonard [was the leader of that team ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/2019/6/8/18657581/kawhi-leonard-raptors-warriors-nba-finals-leadership) and this perceived notion that Kawhi ‚Äúisn‚Äôt a leader‚Äù is a media driven narrative because a.) they think since he doesn‚Äôt talk to the media he doesn‚Äôt talk and b.) Gregg Popovich came out and said he wasn‚Äôt the leader of Spurs teams that were led by Tim Duncan. And Serge Ibaka passed Lowry the trophy because he was the longest tenured Raptor. What‚Äôs sad is that you are a Raptors fan and have no fucking clue what you‚Äôre talking about.
"I think a team of Westbrook, Durant, Harden, Serge Ibaka, and Jeff Green could win a championship. If you want to play on easy mode, then they could sign Nick Collison out of retirement"
"Honourable mentions are kinda short, no Jimmy Butler? Serge Ibaka? Kevin Love?"
What? Serge Ibaka was injured half the season what does that have to with this situation?
"Marcus Camby, Al Jefferson, Mike Bibby, Toni Kukoƒç, Byron Scott, Arvydas Sabonis (he‚Äôs probably the best basketball player to never make it but by the time he was in the NBA he‚Äôd dealt with so many injuries), Serge Ibaka, Ron Harper, Andre Miller, Derek Harper and Rod Strickland are all up there and you haven‚Äôt mentioned. I want to avoid the modern guys you put up because they‚Äôll probably make a team (aside from JV that could only make it as a injury replacements replacement). Right now I‚Äôd have to give it to Al Jefferson or Andre Miller. Sabonis is definitely the best player to never make the all-star team but if we‚Äôre only talking about NBA careers I can‚Äôt give it to him due to him being a shadow of himself by the time he was in the NBA."
"It goes back further:  July 20, 2007: The Phoenix Suns trade Kurt Thomas and 2 first round picks (2008 &amp; 2010) to the Seattle SuperSonics for a 2009 conditional 2nd round pick.  June 26, 2008: The Seattle SuperSonics draft Serge Ibaka 24th overall in the NBA Draft using the first round pick from Phoenix.  June 23, 2016: The Oklahoma City Thunder trade Serge Ibaka to the Orlando Magic for Victor Oladipo, Damantas Sabonis, and Ersan Ilyasova.  July 6, 2017: The Oklahoma City Thunder trade Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis to the Indiana Pacers for Paul George.  July 10, 2019: The Oklahoma City Thunder trade Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers for Danilo Gallinari, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, 5 first round picks (2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 &amp; 2026), and the right to swap first round picks in 2023 &amp; 2025.   But what about the Suns, who triggered all of this madness in 2007? Well, they traded Kurt Thomas for cap relief and a 2009 conditional 2nd round pick. They used that 2009 conditional 2nd round pick they received from the SuperSonics to draft Emir Preld≈æiƒá, who would go on to never play a single minute in the NBA, as is tradition. As for that precious cap relief, the Suns went on in that offseason to sign Richie Frahm who was almost immediately waived, Brian Skinner who would average 3 points and 3 rebounds in one season with the Suns, and acquire a 35 year old Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal from the Miami Heat, who would ultimately cement his legacy as one of the all time greats with rebirth in his new franchise. Just kidding, Shaq averaged 16 points and 9 rebounds in one and a half seasons with Phoenix."
"&gt; That‚Äôs just a bunch of excuses for MJ. You‚Äôre failing to look at the 93/94 team.  How so? It's the truth, they coasted to a title with Jordan and the very next year despite having better pieces overrall, couldn't make past the second round.  &gt; That team was a bad foul call away from the ECF. They took the Knicks to a game 5 without MJ. If they don‚Äôt make that BS call the Bulls are back in ECF. That‚Äôs not normal.  No they weren't, they were a bad foul call away from being up 3-2 in the series, the foul call didn't end the series, they had two games left to play and couldn't get it done.  &gt; You think the 2017 Cavs would make it to a game away from the ECF without Bron? Not a chance.  Yes, i absolutely do, especially considering how god awful the Eastern Conference was in 2017. They probably wouldn't have made the Finals, but they would've made the ECSF. They would've had to go through a 42-40 Pacers squad led by Wayoff P to match what the Bulls did in '94, hardly a challenge.  &gt; Or how about the 2011/12 Heat? Bron had to go nuclear in a game 6 at Boston down 3-2 in order to save their season. Bron doesn‚Äôt play that series and BOS probably sweeps Miami.  So? Jordan had to score 42 in Game 7 of the 1992 ECSF to carry the Bulls through the Knicks, then he had to average 41/8/6 in the greatest Finals performance of all time to beat the Suns in six, great players do great things.  &gt; I could do this exercise with a bunch of our modern stars and I can PROMISE you their teams aren‚Äôt winning 55 games without them.   And that only shows how you fail to understand what context is. Modern stars leave their teams because they don't think they can win, so they move while their teams rebuild, Michael didn't leave, he retired, the Bulls tried to bring new pieces to keep contending, which obviously didn't work as they got bounced in the second round.  But i will go along with it. Kevin Durant AND Serge Ibaka left the Thunder in 2016, they went from 55 to 47 wins. Kawhi Leonard left the Raptors and they went from 58 wins in 82 games to 53 in 72 the next year.  And since you love to ignore context, here is one that you will love: LeBron James joined a 35-win Lakers squad in 2018, they won 37 games with him the next year, by your logic you should question his impact."
"Tim Duncan's playoff blocks.    He averaged over 2 blocks per game for over 250 games.      If the next active person on the list, Serge Ibaka, can get to the finals for the next five seasons, and average 2 blocks per game for 28 playoff games...he could maybe match Duncan's record."
Kanter would have a solid team  **G:** Russell Westbrook  **G:** Dame Lillard   **F:** Jaylen Brown  **F:** Jayson Tatum  **C:** Kevin Durant  **Bench:** Marcus Smart / CJ McCollum / Carmelo Anthony / Serge Ibaka / Kristaps Porzingis / Jusuf Nurkic
"#Jeremy Lin  Steph Curry, Kyle Lowry, Monte Ellis, Kobe Bryant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Amar'e Stoudemire, David Lee, Serge Ibaka, Marc Gasol are the biggest names I could think of. I think I got them all.   I'll go with Curry, Kobe, Kawhi, Melo, Gasol"
"Supposedly Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka used this to their advantage when guarding Joel Embiid during their 2019 playoff run.  &gt; Cool nugget from Raptors very international team. Serge Ibaka speaks french to Pascal Siakam, spanish to Marc Gasol &amp; english to the rest team. When Serge &amp; Gasol doubled Joel Embiid they would yell where to help from in Spanish so Joel (who speaks french) could not understand.  https://twitter.com/ROSGO21/status/1128011415435059200"
"The Thunder had Reggie Jackson, Kevin Martin and Serge Ibaka. We had Parsons and Patrick Beverley. The Thunder were significantly better than us even without Westbrook, especially accounting for the fact that Harden was just a lower tier all-NBA guy at the time."
"I'll never forget in 2013 we were in overtime in game 6? And pop ran Duncan iso post-up on Ibaka 3-4 possessions straight (spurs did that soooo much in 13-14) and Duncan dominated and won the series in those possessions, and I learned Serge is an elite help defender but not in one-on-one situations. But shit the spurs sure as hell knew lol"
"Surprised nobody has said clippers yet... Kawhi, Paul George, Serge Ibaka, Eric Bledsoe, Nic Batum even."
"Look at where the Raptors were before he got there and what they‚Äôve accomplished since. Perennial lottery team and laughing stock to averaging 50+ wins and having the best accumulative record over 7 years.   Look at his draft record. He consistently pulls premium players out of late picks and the 2nd round (Norman Powell, Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby).  Look at his eye for talent where no one else looks. Picking up undrafted players every off-season who quickly become impact players.  (Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Terence Davis)   Look at his trade history.   In Denver he traded Carmelo to the Knicks where everyone knew he was going to go anyway but got a huge haul of young players + picks including the pick that became Jamal Murray.   He gets to Toronto and unloads Andrea Bargnani  for a package that would include a top 10 pick in 2016 which would later help him to secure Kawhi Leonard.   Then he begins swindling the league  John Salmons = Lou Williams (who then won 6MOTY)   Grieves Vasquez = picks that became Norman Powell and OG Anunoby   Terence Ross + a late 1st = Serge Ibaka   Derozan, Poeltl + a late 1st = Kawhi Leonard + Danny Green + 5M in cash   Valanciunas + Delon Wright = Marc Gasol   There isn‚Äôt an executive in the league that matches Masai‚Äôs overall excellence in every aspect of front office operations."
They gonna catch some Serge Ibaka nude pics
Bulls: Serge Ibaka would be really nice.
"Best French speaker is Ibaka. His French is silky smooth and sexy AF. Also the best dressed. Siakim speaks French like a child and JoJo is just a lovable goofball.  Mais √† la fin, c‚Äôest Papa Serge. Papa ou t‚Äôes ?!"
Serge ibaka does not look like he‚Äôs having a good time
Im just here to make sure there is no Powell erasure &amp; Ibaka copping more flak than he needed too. Serge was still good this series &amp; game 7 is a wash without his rebounding.
"Jamal Murray  Jason Richardson  Ron Harper  Lamar Odom  Serge Ibaka  Feel like this team would actually play quite well together. Good mix of defense, shooting, and playmaking."
"Idk if he counts as a Star, but probably Serge Ibaka.  All-stars: Possibly Siakam, he will be remembered on that championship team but probably overshadowed by Kawhi."
"I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say they imploded. Circumstances dictated the direction they had to go in.  Kawhi left to go home, Danny Green leaves in free agency. And they were still only one possession away from the ECF the very next season.   Next, they lose their center rotation as an ageing Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka move on.  Then you have the covid ridden disaster season, where half the team misses extended periods with covid, along with the senior coaching staff, all while playing the entire season on the road, as the entire franchise is displaced for a year.   If anything, I would look at their situation and say they are on course for one of the quickest turnarounds we‚Äôve seen in a long time. They‚Äôre about two years ahead of schedule in their rebuild, with keeping their young-ish core of Fred-OG-Pascal together while adding Barnes with the fourth pick, along with a few young, good potential, development prospects, and they currently have a roster where not a single player is over the age of 30.  The upcoming season will be all about development for the newer, younger guys, and the growth into full time  leadership roles for the more established core in the absence of the long time leader Kyle Lowry. I would expect them to be a playoff team, at the very least in or around the play in spots."
Must have gotten it from Serge Ibaka
"""Veteran Bigs like Nikola Vucevic, Al Horford, and Serge Ibaka may camp out on the perimeter, but defenses contest their outside shots less than 40 percent of the time. As a comparison, historically shaky three pointers like Russell Westbrook and Ricky Rubio are guarded at around the same rate. """
"U do realize most of those three point shots came off the bench, right? JR Smith/Steve Novak/Quentin Richardson (the three most attempted 3s on the team other than Melo) almost never shared the court with Melo, they didn't start. Did you watch the games??? Melo's best on court 3 pt shooter was Jason Kidd shooting 4 a game at 35%   Did you know that efficiency gets significantly boosted by:  -Being on the superteam Heat  -Playing with Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, and a 42% three point shooter   Because he has Harden and Kyrie taking away shots, genius. Who the fuck is able to take shots for Melo? Iman Shumpert? 39 yr old Jason Kidd? Tyson Chandler posting up? Please enlighten me"
"KD is a better scorer than Kawhi and Melo and is maybe a top 3 scorer in NBA history  Also he had Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka (and starter Thabo Sefolosha shooting 42% from three)  Kawhi had SPACING. Siakam is a good second option and he had FVV, Ibaka, and Lowry, all of which can actually space the floor"
"No one said Serge Ibaka? He has the right balance of fashionable and minimalism, and dude looks like a greek god."
Serge Ibaka is the best dressed man in the NBA
"No it‚Äôs guys on championship teams who played important roles no one hears about. PJ Tucker, Serge Ibaka, Andre Iguodala level guys."
Serge Ibaka happened
"Ah there it is. That latent t racism. Be better  Edit: OP commented ""I hope he's really 18, not Serge Ibaka 18"". Comments get deleted."
"I hope he's really 18, not Serge Ibaka 18"
"3 steps is about all you get for the NBA max vert, could see a handful of guys who could do this (young Serge Ibaka is the minimum needed imo)"
"""Big"" trade is likely codeword for something akin to ""We've traded Serge Ibaka for a backup wing!"""
Maybe a just after prime dwight? Or a Serge Ibaka from a few years ago? Maybe a better Javale?
"Wow, serge ibaka 2.0 huh"
"""If I'm Serge Ibaka I'm naming my first son DIRK"""
skinny peak serge ibaka with a handle.
Lol i love serge ibaka
Serge Ibaka about to cook PG if he stops being his friend.
"Oh waw. Many layers of dumbness in your comments (and possible casual racism cause hey! It's Africa! They don't have papers there...).    1. He was extremely probably born in a hospital, cause here in Europe, most of the babies are born in hospitals (a 15 seconds research tells me that 99% of babies born in Greece are born in hospitals, and 1% at home and at the Birth Center in Athens).   2. Do you realize that he had to go through a very thorough screening when he did his immigration papers to move to the United States? The US has extremely complicated immigration processes, even for people getting drafted to the NBA, you need to show many, many documents. They ask for police certificates, birth certificates, they check your biometrics, your school diplomas, etc.   3. Bit condescending to say what you say about Africa. To take word by word what Serge Ibaka said about the issue (since some people have decided in the past to discuss his ""real"" age without having any proof) ""I was not born in the jungle"". It's not because a player was born in Congo, Nigeria, Senegal or Chad that he doesn't have papers, birth certificates or that we can't know his real age or that they can just fake all of their documents... Come on.    Now I'm sorry if I seem aggressive or smth but it's a narrative that exists too much especially anytime a player from Africa peaks early... It's getting annoying. Africa doesn't mean no civilization."
Serge Ibaka?
&gt;Outside of Westbrook Harden and Durant  Isn't that enough? They had Serge Ibaka. Thabo and Derek Fisher playing 20 mins a night.  And opponents weren't as superteamed as they are now.
"Shout out to The Virtuoso himself, Serge Ibaka for trying to convince Kawhi of how awesome Toronto is. It didn‚Äôt work but I feel like Ibaka really fucked with it. Gasol too probably after so long in Memphis."
"These aren‚Äôt big name free agents though. Raptors have retained guys like Serge Ibaka, Demar Derozan and Kyle Lowry before. Those are bigger names than Portis &amp; Holiday. I really don‚Äôt see what your point is with Milwaukee."
"Lol. Okay.  First round picks for Bargnani and Vasquez.  Serge Ibaka for Terrence Ross  OG at 20  Siakam at 27  FVV undrafted  Best draft record over the last decade.  Best development program.  Grooming arguably the best second exec in Bobby Webster.  Hired Nick Nurse over more experienced candidates.  Kawhi trade without giving up anyone good.   Foresight to see how Gasol would transform them.  Championship in Toronto.  And thats just the quick, off the top if my head list  Hes one of the best, and anyone who says otherwose has no idea what they are talking about."
"It‚Äôs not just superstars that have their best seasons when playing with Russ either. Just off the top of my head, Serge Ibaka, Enes Kanter, Steven Adams, Dion Waiters, Danuel House, Anthony Morrow, and Thabo Sefolosha are among the role players that were at their best when Westbrook was passing them the ball.   He had literal G-Leaguers looking like somewhat competent role players during his MVP season, and he got Kyle Singler a 5 yr/$25 million contract, which could be argued as being the most impressive achievement in the history of basketball considering how ass that dude was."
"The type of player Harden would have developed into is a whole different discussion. I'm just rebuting the implication that the choice was ever between WB and Harden. At the time there was a minority who believed that WB should be traded and Harden to start at PG, but in general people were contemplating Harden and Serge. Iirc most people agreed with sticking with Ibaka lile 60/40."
"He‚Äôs not a ‚Äúloser‚Äù because obviously he‚Äôs fucking not one, but ‚Äúhey he won one finals game with Kevin Durant and James Harden (not to mention a  prime Serge Ibaka) on his team‚Äù is not a winning argument in this debate. He‚Äôs played with larger list of near-prime superstars than just about anybody else in league history."
it was from an interview i saw when he returned after being out when they asked him what the issue was  https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/10005506-clippers-serge-ibaka-undergoes-season-ending-surgery-on-back-injury.amp.html  decompression is the back surgery you get for pinched nerves which is what he said he got
"the following players are all better than any of your roleplayers, in most cases significantly:  * Nic Batum  * Marcus Morris  * Ivica Zubac  * Yes, Serge Ibaka  * Reggie Jackson (if he re-signs)  The following players are at least as good as any of your roleplayers:  * Terance Mann  * Luke Kennard  In general, not only do we have shooters at least as good as yours, but unlike you, ours can also defend."
It‚Äôs not about 1 individual role player but collectively they‚Äôre better. Who‚Äôs yours? Serge Ibaka? Lol
Explain further how Marc gasol Serge ibaka and Kawhi was home grown talent bud
"And we made a 1 year offer at a higher number, which Serge turned down. A chance at Giannis if he didn't re-sign &gt; Ibaka and maybe a sixth seed and first round exit."
where  Serge Ibaka at??
Also what happened to honorary Spaniard Serge Ibaka.  I know he's still hurt but will he ever return to playing for the national team?
"That team was so stacked now that I think about it..  Kyle Lowry  Danny Green  Kawhi Leonard  Pascal Siakam  Marc Gasol  Fred VanVleet  Norman Powell  OG Anunoby   Serge Ibaka  A solid 9 man rotation with a perfect blend of offense and defense.. and that‚Äôs not including guys like Chris Boucher, Patrick McCaw or Jeremy Lin"
"Masai just on the Raptors  (discounting the Melo trade in Denver that was amazing and the Kawhi trade because we all know):  - Traded Bargnani's awful contract for a lottery pick    used to select Jakob Poeltl.   - Traded Greivis Vasquez to the Bucks for 2 picks that turned into OG Anunoby and Norman Powell.   - Signed Fred VanVleet to an undrafted deal.   - Traded Valanciunas, Wright and picks for an old Marc Gasol so we could win. Morey refused to do this for Lowry and that's why Sixers couldn't go further.    - Traded Terrence Ross and a second for Serge Ibaka.     - Drafted Pascal Siakam #27 when few had heard of him.    - Fired Casey and hired a largely unknown Nick Nurse.     Masai is a tier above Morey. He has had elite moves i  trades, drafts and coaching hires. They shouldn't be discussed in the same breath."
"&gt; So wait, $9.5m for McConnell?  My god man, that's George Hill/Deandre Jordan/Serge Ibaka/Larry Nance/Jeremy Lamb money.  But really, I'm fine with it.  McConnell quickly became a favorite of mine."
Tell that to Serge Ibaka. Dirk put his ass in a box and roasted his corpse over an open flame on national television.
"&gt; Book still has many years to make the finals again.  This is the point that Draymond was making. Thinking Books' got all the time in the world to make it back to the finals is a mistake. This literally could've been his only chance at a chip. If the 2012 OKC Thunder couldn't return to their second finals after making their first one boasting a roster with Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Serge Ibaka, all on rookie scale deals then no one really has many years to make the finals again."
"If there was ever a chance for Spain to get revenge on team USA, this is the year. Like a once-in-a quarter century opportunity.   Having said that, I have not been impressed by this Spanish team. They miss peak Serge Ibaka. I predict a 20 point victory for the Americans."
"It's so funny how bad of a position the Clippers are in. Their superstar player, Kawhi, is basically out for the entire season or at the very least, 75% of the season. Clippers have no choice but to re-sign Kawhi because no other decent free agent would go there and because the Clippers gave up everything trying to get Kawhi and PG. Serge Ibaka proved to be very useless for most of the season and opted in because he can't make that same money elsewhere. Rondo looks miserable there. Patrick Beverley is still goofy as hell. Their championship window was the past two seasons. With Kawhi getting up there and age and their limited options, Clippers are never sniffing a title."
Serge Ibaka
"Steven adams used to backup perkins nough said. But Serge Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, Montreze Harrell, looney and bell on the warriors lol I just wanted to say random ones"
"Free agency moves fast. Let's say a big is on your wishlist as a team, and you make a play for John Collins when Free Agency starts. Hawks have 3 days to match that, and that's 3 days you can't make a play for Lauri Markkanen, Jarrett Allen, Richaun Holmes, Serge Ibaka, PJ Tucker, Paul Milsap or Blake Griffin. That's not even considering the other free agents at other positions. You're probably the man out and have to settle with your 3rd, 4th option or worse if the Hawks match.   Hawks are in a position where they can afford to match max for John Collins and still extend Trae Young for max. Going after Collins is risky. Even if you're the Spurs or Thunder and you've got the cap to extend a max offer sheet, who's to say Collins would want to leave Atlanta where they just finished a rebuild, and go to a rebuilding team again for maybe $2m more a year?"
"&gt;Beal was the better player  Beal‚Äôs team went 25-47 in 2020.  Westrbook‚Äôs team in 2015 went 45-37, with Serge Ibaka as his 2nd best player."
I would call that Serge Ibaka series of trades falling under both shit luck and bad management seeing as they missed out on Sabonis who was a gem  The bad part was sending Dipo as well who really broke out after leaving Orlando and OKC
They taught serge fucking ibaka how to shoot 3s. There are no easier ways to guarantee a wrong take than attacking raptors development
And the schlong of serge ibaka
Serge Ibaka* make sure you edit that
Weird. It's not like Serge Ibaka was a scrub.

i was really hoping to see a Serge Ibaka olympics =(( hate injuries
"Serge Ibaka for arrean Ilysova, Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis  At the time Serge was 26, a 3 time all-defensive player and making $12 million per year. Magic we‚Äôre looking to improve and compete, the move was seen as OKC being desperate to keep KD.  Serge‚Äôs career goes sideways in Orlando, OKC turns Dipo and Sabonis into PG for a few years and then Shai and more, Ersan into Jerami Grant"
Well I guess we probably shouldnt consider him for the world teams as well right?  It's similar to how Serge Ibaka plays for Spain.
"I mean, it is the one thing that really changed roster-wise between the 2019-20 Toronto Raptors who went 53-19 and the 2020-21 Toronto Raptors who went 27-45. The two biggest pieces we lost in between those two seasons was, coincidently, our two centres in Serge Ibaka and Marc Gasol. We also lost Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, O'Shae Brissett, Dewan Hernandez and Malcolm Miller but they were marginal bench pieces who we replaced with DeAndre Bembre, Malachi Flynn &amp; Yuta Watanbe as well as increased role for Northman Powell + Gary Trent Junya. Roster-wise, the only difference of consequence is going from two centres who were both able to start for us and going to two unplayable centres in Aron Baynes who is just washed af and Alex Len. So yeah, if we had playable centres, I think that would be the solution to what is the only roster we have.  Obligatory Fuck Tampa Bay as well."
"Late firsts are traded for useful veterans all the time. They also occasionally turn into Serge Ibaka, reggie Jackson,  or Andre Roberson."
Hold up I‚Äôm getting Serge Ibaka and Kelly Oubre on the phone rn
"In the end they got Paul George for Serge Ibaka   So yes, it worked out in the end lmfao."
"The original goal was to have horford replace ibaka . Serge was good but he‚Äôs a role player at that point, his skills were replaceable"
serge ibaka voice: YOU BETTA STOP MORE-Y
I‚Äôm not giving Davis the benefit of the doubt because he does [shit like this](https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2018/3/18/17135958/glen-big-baby-davis-drug-arrest-popeyes-cash-briefcases) and clearly isn‚Äôt totally right in the head.  I can‚Äôt imagine Serge Ibaka throwing down for no reason either despite having actually thrown punches in NBA games and he‚Äôs never been on my team. Relax.
Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine (Jalen Green in the future that dude is cute as fuck)  Matisse Thybulle  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Serge Ibaka  Best defense in the league.. I'll take Kyrie off the bench for some insta offense he p cute
Serge Ibaka man c'mon. Kevin love has the Clooney thing going.  justice Winslow.
"i dont think ive seen any reasonable non troll say the bucks would have gotten crushed. The bucks are a fucking good team. The suns are a different story, and while they deserved their berth in the finals too, we cant really just ignore the fact that every team they faced this playoffs, including the bucks, had a major injury on their squad.  If bucks had donte divincenzo, its possible that bucks sweep or win in 5, never mind lebron, ad, murray, kawhi, and the plethora of smaller injuries like kcp, schroder, caruso, michael porter jr., pj dozier, serge ibaka, ivica zubac all playing a factor. Suns were the best west team this year because they beat everyone else in the battle of healthiness this year. But its magnitudes easier for most fans to accept bucks as champions because they have proven their quality of team over a longer period of time"
"Clippers small ball lineup would run the Bucks out of the gym   On March 29 the Clippers were without PG, Ibaka and Rondo and blew out the Bucks who had all their main guys besides Tucker and Portis playing   Marcus Morris was a +30 and with Kawhi and Zubac to help him he was able to stand his ground against Giannis, he was also huge for the Celtics back in the 2018 playoffs against Giannis, plus his elite shooting killed Lopez and Giannis since they were just camping in the paint   Kennard and Reggie also had huge nights which I don‚Äôt see why that wouldn‚Äôt be replicable in the playoffs  Clippers can defend Middleton with Kawhi, PG and Batum, can defend Jrue with Bev and Mann and can defend Giannis with Morris, Kawhi, PG, Serge and Zu while the Bucks would struggle being able to stop the Clippers from 3"
Yo fuck Serge Ibaka lol.  2nd time I had to think about this today.
"Fucking Serge Ibaka.  We found a way to slow down KD, Russ and Harden and fucking Serge Ibaka puts up a Laettner."
"Yeah there times you see Rob and it kind of reminds like 2010 Serge Ibaka defensively. Some poss are just like the wild wild west or something, total chaos, will scram around chase off somebody from the 3 point line, switch well for 5 seconds and then just blow a rotation in the end to screw everything up. Help responsibility mistakes and awareness usually get better with time but to what degree it's always just a guess. Still will see a fair number of these Andre Drummond types who keep doing the bonehead mistakes even in yr 9 and never fully figure it out.   He has a fair number of bad habits defensively that gotta be addressed while its still early but I do think he'll end up being a good defender, and theyll be real reliant on him figuring out alot of this stuff on the fly soon the next 1-2 yrs. What scheme Udoka runs big part of it also, Stevens defense was built around rim protection being more of a team oriented concept than reliant on one guy"
Exactly. I‚Äôm a believer that Curry will be about this good for another 2 or 3 years. You don‚Äôt need to sell out for this particular year. And I forgot to mention they‚Äôd still have the MLE to add good players. Bobby Portis and Serge Ibaka were MLE‚Äôs last year.
"Hate to break this to you‚Ä¶ but him, Kawhi, and Serge Ibaka will be playing together next year"
"Is this a real thing? I'm optimistic but I have my doubts that Serge ""-Penis Pizza"" Ibaka has made it into the official directory yet."
"The thunder drafted 3 mvps and some real solid ‚Äúothers‚Äù like reggie jackson, cam payne, steve adams, serge ibaka."
"Serge Ibaka was not a role player in 2011, he started every game in the post season and was a force on the defensive end."
"Giannis has a *long* way before he can even be in the same conversation as Duncan. People talk about Giannis having a DPOY but Duncan, a non DPOY, is the current holder of total blocks *IN THE PLAYOFFS* with a whopping 568 blocks. The second player is Hakeem, with almost 100 blocks less. The closest active player is Serge Ibaka with 292. Giannis has yet to crack the top 10.  That isn't counting the ridiculous amount of accolades. Giannis has the chance, but it's not even close."
"Bro, if the 2012 Oklahoma City Thunder couldn‚Äôt make it back to the finals boasting a roster of Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Serge Ibaka then going back to the finals isn‚Äôt guaranteed for any player or team.  All credit to the Suns but if they were going to capitalize on any season it would've been this one. Injured AD, Kawhi, plus CP3 already looks worn down. Every year moving forward he'll be far less then what he was the year before.   not saying the Suns can‚Äôt make it back to the finals, just saying it‚Äôs very likely that Book and the Suns don‚Äôt."
"As a Clipper fan do you like that the Clippers never release any info about the health of their players or is that frustrating? I'd probably be irritated if like LeBron went down with an injury and there was absolutely nothing said about how serious it was or when they thought he might be back. Although getting no information is probably better than when they say a player should be back in a month and suddenly it stretches to like 3-4 months for some reason. Better to be vague than wrong, I guess. But is it frustrating for you guys to still have no clue about when Serge Ibaka might play? Or do you guys like the secrecy?"
"&gt;The Clippers have said ""mid season"" return  Unless I'm mistaken, the Clippers haven't said anything regarding a timeline, as is their custom. They also haven't said anything about a timeline for Serge Ibaka. Their policy seems to be to say as little as possible about injuries, basically just announcing a surgery when it happens and otherwise listing every injury as ""day to day"".  If you have a source where the Clippers listed any kind of timeline for Kawhi (or Ibaka) I'd love to see it."
"Crazy trade idea, but I kinda like it?  3-wat trade with Philly, Houston, and LA.  Rockets: Ben Simmons, Luke Kennard, Keon Johnson. 76ers: Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe, and Serge Ibaka Clippers: John Wall, Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, and Usman Garuba.  Rotations for each team still work pretty well imo, and the teams are trading problems for only potential problems. The salaries of these guys make then almost impossible to trade, so maybe these guys all get traded together.  Philly and LA may get a pick or two as well."
"Lmao that's such a cute story.  My gf's favorite player was Serge Ibaka bc of a long list of things including his cooking show, defense, handsomeness, dancing, fashion and multi linguistics. Basically because he's the perfect man.  ... Come to think of it I should probably make sure she's never in a room alone with Serge.  She now likes Giannis because of that video of him ordering Chick Fil A."
"Redick on that nba player tier 2 hotness with Minnesota (first stint) Rubio, Banana Republic Kevin Love, and post-haircut Gordon Hayward. For those curious, tier 1 is Wizards Oubre, shirtless (and sometimes pantsless) Serge Ibaka, Jeremy Lin wearing a Harvard hoodie (according to my wife), and for the real freaks, white hijab Kobe in that LA times photoshoot"
"It was his series vs the young OKC trio + Ibaka that is the real eye opener.  The series where JVG has the great line 'If I'm Serge Ibaka, I'm naming my first son Dirk'  KD had basically already become KD and they were already super dangerous (would go to the Finals the next year).  Ibaka was an elite defender.  Dirk had two 40 point games in that 5 game series and I swear they felt like they were 60 pts watching them.  Dallas's starting 5 was wholly reliant on Dirk for buckets, and OKC could only foul him.  His Game 1 was 12/15 FG and 24/24 FT for 48 points  And they needed all of it.  5 game series but just about every game went down to the final stretch in the 4th, where they just gave the ball to Dirk"
"More core strength and fitness. I remember 2010-2014 he had trouble getting past people off the dribble, particularly long dudes like Serge Ibaka. In 2015 he had noticeably more explosiveness, probably [thanks to all them deadlifts](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/14750602/how-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-got-best-worst-ankles-sports).  In terms of shooting, his set point is higher."
"Dirk going 12/15 from the field and 24/24 from the line. The ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm Serge Ibaka, I‚Äôm naming my son Dirk‚Äù game."
"PG: De'Aaron Fox, John Wall  SG: Paul George (AS), Zach Lavine (AS), Marcus Smart  SF: Kawhi Leonard (SS), Nicholas Batum, Jae Crowder  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (SS), John Collins  C: Myles Turner, Serge Ibaka"
serge ibaka
You know Kawhi would rather be blowing a blunt in the backseat with Serge Ibaka like they did on the Raptors. Though Serge is on the Clips too IIRC
"There are actual areas he would fit. In terms of adding another driver of the basket (which we lacked for 80% of the year last year) he does so. Bledsoe is better defensively but John Wall is a better playmaker who averaged 7 assist with some of the worst spacing in the league. While I don't love Serge as a starter a lineup of John Wall, PG, Reggie, Ibaka and Morris works because Wall no longer has to take poor shots. He's surrounded with some of the best spacing in the league and can actually focus on defensive side of ball with another year removed from a major injury.   It's not perfect but I do think it works because as much as I enjoyed PG's improved playmaking relying on him to be the best playmaker on the team for an entire season can lead to him not looking to score as much. When PG was a #1 option with a point guard who handled the ball alot and was able to get him to his spots he had his best regular season year. As long as he drove the ball and cutdown on the bad shots I could definitely see John Wall having a 15/8 type of season on decent efficiency while being a solid defender."
Always thought he would eventually land on the Clippers.   Isn't he already situated in LA?  Kawhi/Ibaka (Serge is a spanish national team player) and him mentoring Zubac would be crazy since there's some resemblance.    He would be better on the Warriors as a Bogut prescense and I'd take them to come out of the West with their starting lineup and depth.
Dirk Nowitzki and Serge Ibaka
"Trade him for salary filler. Serge Ibaka, Eric Bledsoe, and Luke Kennard basically matches salaries while still clearly making the clippers a better team. Then ask for like, a mf second round pick."
"I know Bledsoe is an incredibly flawed player but I like the fit of him on the Clippers a lot and I was advocating for a Clippers/Pelicans trade back when he was in New Orleans.  For all of his flaws, the two things he can do are make plays and play defense. He averaged 6 assists a game in his last playoff series with the Bucks. Theoretically, his lack of a 3-point shot can be covered up by either Serge Ibaka or going small.   PatBev obviously proved he was expendable to the Clippers. He's a secondary ball-handler at best and continues to have a lot of injury concerns. That all being said I thought he would've been solid next to Zion but he'll help set the culture in Minny."
"""If I'm Serge Ibaka, I'm naming my first son Dirk."" ~ Jeff Van Gundy"
Bruh we didn‚Äôt have Obama either  Edit: SERGE IBAKA
*Cries in Serge Ibaka*
serge ibaka played 0/6 of the series. Evens out
In the stretch of games without Westbrook KD averaged 35ppg on dam near 50/40/90 with a 19-7 record (60 win pace) in that span including an 11 game win streak where his best offensive help was Serge Ibaka and Reggie Jackson. It absolutely should have been unanimous but KDs MVP season is rarely talked about as a good carry job
A top six without Serge Ibaka‚Ä¶ that man is handsome as hell  We really need games back huh?
"Since the last Raptors game in Toronto, Marc Gasol, Serge Ibaka, Norm Powell and Kyle Lowry have all departed from the team.  It‚Äôs a shame Kyle didn‚Äôt get a proper goodbye in front of the Toronto home crowd this season. That ‚Äúfalse alarm‚Äù goodbye in Tampa the night before the trade deadline was bizarre in hindsight."
Serge Ibaka was unique at the time--an interior shot blocker who was also deadly from midrange.
Jamal Magloire!  Also made 1 all star game then fell off hard.    Serge Ibaka!  still had a productive career but it looked like he was going to win a foot at one point.  Bonzi Wells!  Not alot else to say.
Serge Ibaka and Morris Twins
Kawhi's injury and Serge Ibaka
"Treating Serge Ibaka, a man from a million plus metropolis with full records, age claim's dubiously because some rural areas in other countries have low rates is whack."
Wish we could have somehow done this vs the Thunder but noooo Serge Ibaka had to turn into Larry Bird lite and started hitting 3s out of nowhere.  That 2012 series is more depressing than bosh out to allen bang
Demar Derozan earned a 2nd team all-nba in 2017-18 with a line of 23/3.9/5.2 on exactly league average TS.  Your first instinct might be ok those are not great numbers for a 2nd team considering his awful defense. And you would be right.   You might then think but wait they won 59 games so even though Zach Lavine has put up almost identical numbers (2019-20) and NOT EVEN MADE ALL-STAR much less All-NBA that hw must have been indispensable on the court.   Wrong again. Demar had a negative on/off even this season and the NBA roster featured a whopping 10 PLAYERS who are significant rotation players even now 4 years later.  Here is the list:  OG Anunoby Demar Derozan Serge Ibaka Kyle Lowry Jakob Poeltl Norman Powell Pascal Siakam Jonas Valanciunas  Fred Vanvleet Delon Wright  Of course this team was one of the best in the NBA with a 10 man rotation like that!
Serge Ibaka came out a few years ago and said pretty much the exact same thing when he was the target of the age speculation. He was pretty offended by it and rightfully so.
"But they say Thon Maker, Serge Ibaka, Sekou Doumbouya, Bismack Biyombo are. I wonder why."
I clicked this link expecting to see the second coming of a young Serge Ibaka or Karl Malone.  I was disappointed.
"Fun Fact: Brook Lopez is also #37 on all time blocks in a career. There are only 2 other current players that beat him out, Dwight Howard and Serge Ibaka."
DeMar DeRozan. Serge Ibaka.
"Yeah he forced Marc Gasol *and* Serge Ibaka, 2 great defensive bigs off the floor that series cause he was tearing them up in the PnR.  By the end of the series we played so much OG at centre just to give us a chance. Still can‚Äôt believe that went 7 games lol."
I think he can be Serge Ibaka. That's pretty damn good and worth the cash.
"What? I felt the complete opposite, Fatty Felton was a chunky mother fucker when I saw him in OKC. Bigger than on TV.  On the flip side, Serge Ibaka is a living greek demigod. What a body that man has lmao"
Serge Ibaka when he gets in a fight tho
Reggie Jackson   Paul George  Kawhi Leonard  Marcus Morris   Serge (perfect man)ibaka   Pg and ibaka carry them
"A Reggie Jackson/Paul George/Kawhi Leonard/Marcus Morris/Serge ibaka starting 5 is more sexy imo, ibaka and Paul george are atleast top 5 in the league in terms of sexy ness"
Idk about the strongest but Serge Ibaka
"Right now it‚Äôs 100% the fact that we‚Äôre about to go through a genuine rebuild. The post-Dwight teams were marred by the Hennigan regime trying too hard to retool the team and ultimately trying to compete too early. Our current FO is set on developing these young players and trying to build something real, which I‚Äôm incredibly excited about. We can go FA or trade hunting when we know we‚Äôve got another star on our team, instead of trading away our arguably best young prospect (and a pick that turned out to be an all star) for Serge freaking Ibaka.  I also look forward to tix being a little cheaper again lol. Win or lose, Magic games are always a blast to go to but paying $40-50 for nosebleeds has always been outside of my budget haha"
"Morris twins, Westbrook, Dray, Serge Ibaka.   Embiid is like KG. Good trash talker, fake tough guy compared to other NBA tough guys."
"Hell, Serge Ibaka is likely the oldest player in the league right now."
"When you consider those Thunder teams had literally ZERO spacing and ZERO offense it makes sense that KD‚Äôs efficiency numbers dipped in the playoffs. Also makes sense why his numbers jumped so much when he got put into an ACTUAL offense with all time great shooters. Point is any star‚Äôs efficiency is going to dip without any spacing around them, especially in the playoffs when defense gets A LOT tougher and more strategic.   KD‚Äôs second best shooter was Serge Ibaka, who was only still developing his three. Russ still can‚Äôt shoot to this day. You know who we paired our non shooting star PG with in the backcourt? Andre Roberson who is a walking brick, a guy who fucking ran away from defenders who were Hack-a-Shaqing him. On top of that our centers were Perkins and Adams. More non shooters. Rockets straight up traded all their centers and went 5 out to accommodate Russ. We had like 1 and a half shooters.   KD basically just played ISO in OKC with zero spacing. He was playing doubles, triples, or a man and a half his whole time in OKC. When you don‚Äôt even have to worry about the second best player shooting (in fact teams WANTED Russ to shoot), you just throw everything at KD. KD can and has proven to be great and efficient without Curry, but obviously he is going to be more efficient when playing with an all time great shooter. Especially when you compare it to what he had in OKC‚Ä¶they both benefited from each other.   Everyone only talks about how Curry helped KD on offense but not how KD‚Äôs versatility on D (can switch 1-5) and rim protection let the Warriors put out some dangerous offensive lineups. He unlocked the Hampton 5 for real. A lot of people just ignore Curry‚Äôs defense because he‚Äôs so great on offense and he‚Äôs always had great defenders to back him up. Also not a surprise that Curry‚Äôs playoffs numbers also got better when KD joined. Just enjoy them both. Ofc playing next to the greatest shooter ever and most dangerous offensive player ever is going to raise your efficiency. Also that guy Klay Thompson lol."
100% Robin Lopez and Serge Ibaka
"Maybe not, but he can lock up the opposing teams best guard in a way that Rondo even in his prime couldn't manage. Clippers didn't need another playmaker/ball handler like the Lakers did. We needed a stout defender who could hit 3's.   (all following quotes come from this Sports Illustrated article - https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/how-patrick-beverley-silenced-doubters)  &gt; Pat Bev answered the call. In the 45 possessions that Beverley guarded Mitchell in the playoffs, Spida scored just 10 points on 23% from the field, turned the ball over 4 times, and was blocked 5 times. In the 72 minutes that Mitchell and Beverley shared the court, the Clippers were a +29.  &gt; Coming into the WCF, Devin Booker was averaging nearly 30 PPG in the previous two rounds. His dominance helped Phoenix eliminate the defending champs in the opening round, and sweep the MVP in round two  &gt; After Booker put up a 40-point triple double in game one of the WCF, Ty Lue inserted Patrick Beverley into the starting lineup for the remainder of the series. While the Clippers were unable to overcome the loss of Kawhi Leonard, Ivica Zubac, and Serge Ibaka, Pat Bev had Booker locked up. In the 110 possessions that Pat Bev guarded Booker, D-Book shot just 28% from the field, turned the ball over 7 times, and did not make a single three-point basket.  So, again, currently they are pretty even they just have different skillsets"
"In that case, it's not changing the game much because I'm relatively certain the furthest free throw dunks I've seen from NBA players in contests or games still had their tippy toes on the line (two off the top - [Scottie Pippen](https://youtu.be/fhyTNWKt0r8?t=38) and [Serge Ibaka](https://youtu.be/yo8drXa9nBw?t=75))."
OG Anunoby: ‚ÄúWhat about scarves?‚Äù https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2020/4/14/21220213/toronto-raptors-scarves-serge-ibaka-og-anunoby
Serge Ibaka should've named his first son after him
Serge ibaka?
Serge Ibaka had The Serge Protector and Serge he-block-ya back when he was leading the league in blocked shots.
"&gt; okay so it sounds like the Spurs were an amazing TEAM who maximized the strengths of everyone?  lol. Dude, stop. Duncan was far and away the best player of the Spurs dynasty. You seem to have an excuse for why the Spurs won five championships. But you want to defend to Malone for never winning one. And the excuse is essentially, ""He played against better players."" Yeah. That's kind of the point.  &gt; he got passed Shaq and Kobe the year Shaq was hurt and the Lakers were a 5 seed and when Kobe was a teenager.  I'm super impressed that when Shaq was hurt he was still putting up 30/10 type numbers in the playoffs. And Kobe was only able to muster more than 35 point &lt;checks notes&gt; *four times* in that series loss to the Spurs in 2003. That feud really did affect their performances, I guess. They weren't trying, like, at all.  &gt; where was that against the Grizzlies in 2011? where was that in 2013 when they lost the finals? when they got the shit ran out of them by OKC and Serge Ibaka ate his lunch in 2012?  I love that the examples you can come up with are all in Duncan's later years, and two are against absolutely stacked teams that include multiple MVPs and HoF players in their primes. But, when Malone loses a series to all-time greats, it's somehow a positive in your mind. I guess we're not going to mention Malone getting held to 8 points in 45 minutes in a closeout game against Portland in 1999? Or blowing a 2-0 lead in the first round to Dallas in 2001 (in a best of 5 series)? I mean, those are all at the same point in his career as Duncan was in the series you brought up for him.  &gt; why isn‚Äôt the Spurs dumping the ball into Duncan 50 times a game in the early 2000s when they played slower than hell a one trick pony?  But ... but ... you said it was because the Spurs were a superior ""TEAM."" Not because Duncan could dominate when constantly fed the ball. I really can't keep up with your excuses.  But to answer the question, the reason the Spurs and Duncan weren't a one-trick pony was because they didn't rely solely on that during their decades long dynasty."
"okay so it sounds like the Spurs were an amazing TEAM who maximized the strengths of everyone?   meanwhile the Jazz ran the Pick and Roll where is just Malone being better than everyone else   and Duncan never had to play against Michael Fucking Jordan. he got passed Shaq and Kobe the year Shaq was hurt and the Lakers were a 5 seed and when Kobe was a teenager. he beat 36 year old Pay Ewing and the 8 seed Knicks, Jason Kidd and Kerry Kittles, the 04 Pistons in 7 games, the worst finals team ever in 2007, and then 2014 was with 2 HOFers and young Kawhi in the greatest team basketball display ever   and it‚Äôs hilarious to think Duncan could just turn into an all time scorer at will. where was that against the Grizzlies in 2011? where was that in 2013 when they lost the finals? when they got the shit ran out of them by OKC and Serge Ibaka ate his lunch in 2012? that‚Äôs not based in reality and i‚Äôm not sure where it comes from.   was the triangle a one trick pony because Jordan got to isolate at the elbow 30 times a game? why isn‚Äôt the Spurs dumping the ball into Duncan 50 times a game in the early 2000s when they played slower than hell a one trick pony?  Malone averaged 24.7/10.7 for his entire career in the playoffs and he went to 3 Finals. he ran into Hakeem Olajuwon and Michael Jordan, not Jason Kidd and 36 year old Patrick Ewing"
"Ibaka would have been a better option for Love, but Casey was absolutely married to the idea of having Serge guard LeBron‚Ä¶which largely entailed him watching LeBron spin the ball in his face before hitting shot after shot."
"8 man playoff rotation:   - Kawhi Leonard - Kyle Lowry - Pascal Siakam - Fred VanVleet - Norman Powell - Marc Gasol - Serge Ibaka - Danny Green  and OG Anunoby had an emergency appendectomy the eve of the playoffs and missed the entire postseason  The deepest team I've ever watched as a Raps fan. Zero defensive weak points and balanced offense across the entire roster. Shooting and scoring from all 3 levels, great playmakers and finishers, and subbing in Nick Nurse for Casey put them over the top."
"&gt; 15 PPG could be good for a 3rd option, if they are scored efficiently.  During the playoffs the third options for the final 4 (and Spurs) in 2016 were  Raptors -  Jonas Valanciunas 13.8 PPG on 57/0/74  Thunder - Serge Ibaka 12 PPG on 52/45/75  Cavs - Kevin Love 14.7 PPG on 39/41/84  Spurs - Tony Parker 10.4 PPG on 45/25/86  Warriors - Draymond Green 15.4 PPG on 43/37/74 (highest scoring third option)  So Love was from the top 5 worst from 2, 2nd best from 3, and 2nd best from the line. He also shot more 3s than even Green though, 5.6 to 4.5"
"You always have to deal with great teams like the Warriors in the finals. If it's not Draymond guarding you it's Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, or Serge Ibaka. Or you're guarding Tim Duncan, Pau Gasol, Garnett, Dirk etc. Love would not be a good matchup for any of these guys on either end."
"Marc Gasol, Serge Ibaka, Pascal Siakam, Kyle Lowry and Kawhi Leonard carried that team. 0 bad defenders in that group."
"‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm Serge Ibaka, I‚Äôm naming my first son Dirk.‚Äù is such a funny call lol"
"You are one inch inside Kyle Lowry but Serge Ibaka is one inch inside you, which way you moving?"
"Sarver gave us Shai you know. He traded Kurt Thomas plus two firsts for a second to dodge the salary cap tax. One of those picks was Serge Ibaka, who as you know, we traded for Oladipo + Sabonis who then went for PG who then got us Shai and a bunch of picks.  Sarver is looking at the tax again. I say we offer a second round pick and cash considerations for Ayton and two unprotected firsts."
"Sometimes its not always about the bad signings or trades, but the lack of doing specific signings or trades when available too. We botched the gasol ibaka situation in FA of 2020, and we had cap space to sign serge and go after giannis and avoid luxury tax but the issue was tryna bring back both serge and gasol and pissed off serge. That left us a hole at center all year."
"Correct. He also sold James Jones, picks that became Rudy Fernandez and Sergio Rodriguez, and one of the picks traded with Kurt Thomas became Serge Ibaka."
Sam Presti really traded Serge Ibaka for Paul George. Go even further Sam Presti turned serge Ibaka into SGA Gallo and 5 firsts
The anti-serge ibaka
"KD, you used to be teammates with Westbrook and Serge Ibaka. xD"
"**G:** Malcolm Brogdon  **G:** CJ McCollum  **F:** Tobias Harris   **F:** Serge Ibaka  **C:** Myles Turner  **Bench:** Lou Williams, Alec Burks, Terrence Ross, Aaron Gordon, Jusuf Nurkic"
"Obviously we're not going to see eye to eye on this, but I'm curious how you feel advanced stats support your case? Based on basketball-reference, Marc Gasol has a Drtg of 110, vs Draymond's 112. Given the small sample size, these are essentially the same. In fact, the raptors BEST defensive rating of 104 came with Serge Ibaka (Gasol's backup) in the game, suggesting that he wasn't even his team's best defensive big this series...... You also said Gasol's minutes were limited because he struggled on offense, but he had the best offensive rating of any Raptor so that doesn't really add up.   &amp;#x200B;  I'll definitely acknowledge that Gasol had the best defense in the league against bigs like Embiid and Giannas, but his slower foot speed made him a liability at times against the warriors. That's exactly why Draymond is one of the greatest defenders of all time. He is strong and long enough to force bigger players into tough shots, while being quick and intelligent enough to shut down guards at an elite level as well. He's a dominant defensive player regardless of the matchup."
everybody fits with evan mobley tbh  he‚Äôs like serge ibaka but more skilled and athletic
Serge Ibaka for Terrence Ross plus the pick not being OG's pick.  Masai is Jesus
Lol. We had Ibaka on our team. Scott had big something to fill if he wants to cover the D void Serge left.
"Tristan Thompson, Serge Ibaka, Russ, Patrick Ewing, Jokic, Dennis Rodman, Timelord, Al Horford, Clint Capela"
"Dude was a solid contributor to OKC especially in the playoffs. Most people at that time knew OKC had a POTENTIAL big 3. Its just that Harden kinda choked in the finals. When it came down to rearranging the roster the following off season, they felt like a having a strong interior presence in Serge Ibaka was a bigger priority, hence OKC cheaping out in offering a max to Harden."
Serge Ibaka
"prolly the beat role player in the league, Serge Ibaka"
"3&amp;D wings are the easy answer here, so I‚Äôll try to say something different. I think  bench guys who can play either the 4 or 5 and at least be respectable on at least a mid-range jumper are huge. Whether it be somebody like Daniel Theis, Kurt Thomas, Serge Ibaka, Robert Horry, or Bobby Portis, having somebody like that to provide both depth and flexibility is a huge asset."
"All part of their plan to lower his value until they trade him for Luke Kennard, Serge Ibaka, and Eric Bledsoe"
"Serge Ibaka, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, Danny Green, Kyle Lowry‚Ä¶  Ok nevermind, sixers still might have looked better on paper lol."
&gt; long D  [Ibaka](http://www.thelostogle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/serge-ibaka-679x1024.jpg) is gone man...
"1) think of it this way. at their very highest ceiling, which player would any team take? it's obviously Barnes. and why are you acting like Suggs is guarantee to become a great floor general/leading scorer and Barnes won't? You have absolutely no basis to make that claim given what we've seen so far.   2)you completely missed the point, which is not surprising. again, players of the same mold did not contribute significantly on the offensive end when they were rookies, yet they developed into lethal scorers. what about Suggs? you speaking as if he's going to dominate offensively as a rookie. from what we've seen so far, his shooting, ball handling and playmaking still need A LOT of work. no weaknesses my ass.   3) you're placing way too much emphasis on college, especially when it comes to Barnes vs. Suggs. college is over and it's the NBA now. it's a different style of game. a lot of players destroy college but flame out in the NBA. at this point, people are paying attention to what's going on in the NBA and skills demonstrated so far, not what happened playing against little boys in college. use some common sense.   4)Fuck dude. everyone knows Barnes is offensively raw. The Raptors drafted him knowing this LOL. You acting like Suggs is this great shooter already, he is not. If Scottie, develops his jumper, he could be one of it the best player in this draft class given his other attributes. and it's not just his physical profile the Raptors looked at. You constantly and conveniently ignore other parts of his game that make him special already. Barnes is stronger, longer, and is a better play-maker than Isaac, even as we speak when he's 20 and Isaac is 24.   5) Wtf. Lowry came to the Raptors at age 26 after being tossed around the league like a rag doll. look at his stats since becoming a Raptor. Serge Ibaka was traded to orlando and his career appeared to be going down hill. He had career years playing in Toronto and won a ring. The Raptors revived his career. Uhh no, the raptors have a longer list of excellent players developed compared to Boston and OKC. it's likely easier to develop lottery talent than it is non-lottery talent and the Raptors have been doiing the latter. Why don't you list some non-lottery players from Boston or OKC who have become quality starters? LOL. Jonas is a quality big man in the league, Raptors traded Ross for Serge who was essential in the championship run. Ed Davis was drafted when Bryan Colangelo was still the GM, Poetl was traded after his rookie season, Malachi's just a sophomore. I'm resorting to insults because I have a low tolerance for idiotic, uninformed posts such as yours."
"your posts are so garbage dude.  1) it's not like Barnes is on a hot fluky shooting streak in pre-season. he's showing defensive versatility, play-making and IQ, and he's only 20 years old. he's leading the team in assists as a 6'8 positionless player. Suggs, the supposed PG isn't even coming close lmfao and hasn't shown anything that would've warranted the raptors taking him over barnes. and outshine what potential?  his shooting still sucks and he's demonstrating that's he's not that good of a playermaker. yeah i bet you're impressed by Suggs half court fluke shot and his fancy, risky bounce passes. he honestly doesn't do anything better than Barnes and Barnes has a lot more going for him for success in the NBA. not to mention Suggs' arrogance, claiming he has no weaknesses in his game LOL.  2) it wouldn't be shocking if he averages less than 10ppg as a rookie. it's clear his offensive game is raw. did Kawhi, Pascal, OG, Giannis or similar molds average more than 10 ppg as a rookie? no.   3)why the fuck should we care about college accomplishments? This is the NBA dude LOL. Should we put Adam Morrison in the hall of fame because of his college game? Fuck outta here.   4)Barnes has better tools than all the players you listed. Bol Bol, Isaac, Bender don't have his combination of versatility, wing span, vision, and IQ, not to mention his personality and leadership   5)are you stupid, a troll or just ignorant? The championship run wasn't all Kawhi and this has been discussed to death. Let's see the players who have improved with the Raptors : OG 23rd overall, Pascal 27th overall, Norm Powell 2nd rounder, Fred Van Vleet undrafted, Chris Boucher undrafted, Lowry, Serge Ibaka. players recognize the Raptors reputation for player development because it's played out before our eyes over the past decade. you're head is so far up your ass it isn't even funny"
If he did that on Serge Ibaka I'd be a little worried for him haha
First the Lowry highlight of taking a charge  then the Derozan highlight randomly slamming it on a big   Why y'all making us cry  whats next...JV pump faking someone at the 3pt line for an open drive?  Serge Ibaka wearing a scarf punching players?
"Oh you mean the year KD won the scoring title averaging 28 a game, Harden was the far and away 6th man of the year and Westbrook was in his prime? With a bench consisting of Serge Ibaka (also in his prime) Reggie Jackson and Kendrick Perkins. The team that only lost a combined 3 games in the entire first 3 rounds of the playoffs? Yeah, I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and say that team was more than capable of winning a ring lol.   I know you just became a Nets fan this year so you probably don‚Äôt know a lot about basketball but I think you might be the clown here, bud!  None of this taking into account the MULTIPLE Houston teams that Harden was a part of that repeatedly choked in crunch time. Were the Rockets super teams? Probably not. Were they capable of winning a championship at the time? Absolutely. More than capable."
Isiah Hartenstein &gt; Serge Ibaka
"I only have data from the 2004-05 season onwards, but here are all the lineups with at least 100 games:  * ('Ben Wallace', 'Chauncey Billups', 'Rasheed Wallace', 'Richard Hamilton', 'Tayshaun Prince') 227 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Garnett', 'Paul Pierce', 'Rajon Rondo', 'Ray Allen') 221 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 209 * ('Al Horford', 'Joe Johnson', 'Josh Smith', 'Marvin Williams', 'Mike Bibby') 180 * ('David West', 'George Hill', 'Lance Stephenson', 'Paul George', 'Roy Hibbert') 171 * ('Andrew Bynum', 'Derek Fisher', 'Kobe Bryant', 'Metta World Peace', 'Pau Gasol') 144 * ('Andrew Bogut', 'Draymond Green', 'Harrison Barnes', 'Klay Thompson', 'Stephen Curry') 136 * ('Jeff Green', 'Kevin Durant', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 133 * ('Bradley Beal', 'John Wall', 'Marcin Gortat', 'Markieff Morris', 'Otto Porter Jr.') 128 * ('Danny Green', 'Kawhi Leonard', 'Tiago Splitter', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 124 * ('Damian Lillard', 'LaMarcus Aldridge', 'Nicolas Batum', 'Robin Lopez', 'Wesley Matthews') 114 * ('Bruce Bowen', 'Manu Ginobili', 'Rasho Nesterovic', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 110 * ('Andre Roberson', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Steven Adams') 109 * ('Jason Collins', 'Jason Kidd', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Richard Jefferson', 'Vince Carter') 106 * ('Derrick Favors', 'Donovan Mitchell', 'Joe Ingles', 'Ricky Rubio', 'Rudy Gobert') 106 * ('Andrei Kirilenko', 'Carlos Boozer', 'Deron Williams', 'Mehmet Okur', 'Ronnie Brewer') 101"
"I mean all you need is Kawhi Leonard, Marc Gasol, Serge Ibaka and Pascal Siakam, it‚Äôs easy enough"
"Why do you hate the argument?    He was out for Games 1 and 2, and the Thunder gave up 120 points in the paint combined in those games.    He then returned to the lineup prematurely. He was supposed to be out for the rest of the playoffs.   Source: https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/9190679     He was rushed back even though he was not 100%. In fact his injury was so bad that he was still dealing with it months later.     Source: https://thunderousintentions.com/2014/08/02/serge-ibaka-calf-injury-serious-anyone-realized/amp/       When he returned for Game 3, the Thunder only gave up 40 points in the paint, showing the massive difference he made on the defensive end, even when injured.    The Thunder went 2-2 with Ibaka in the lineup, but those first two losses without him ultimately ended up being the difference in the series.    The Thunder were not ‚Äúfully healthy‚Äù by Game 5,  Ibaka was risking major re-injury just by being on the floor."
Robin Lopez did that one year in Chicago. I believed the only game he missed that year was due to a fight with Serge Ibaka.
"Lowry can make any center that can run and catch a ball look like an offensive juggernaut.   See Amir Johnson, JV, Serge Ibaka, Bismack Biyombo ‚Ä¶"
mikal bridges or OG Anunoby are the two best answers in my opinion. Elite 3 &amp; D guys with length and size can be inserted into almost any starting lineup and contribute. I also think a healthy serge ibaka could be a candidate.
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
Wish he woulda saw his broadcasting potential when he was switching everything in the 2012 finals with perk and Derek Fisher and not prime Serge Ibaka
Serge Ibaka is only 1 year younger than Dwayne Casey
Was it easy because Serge Ibaka (who's half a foot taller) was on his tail for a chase-down block?
And we eventually turned Terrance Ross and a first(Later used to draft An≈æejs Paseƒç≈Üiks) into Serge Ibaka
I remember telling my friend who was going on a date with a ‚Äúhuge Raptors fan‚Äù that a popular player was ‚ÄúThe shot blocka Serge Ibaka‚Äù and to say that.  She did and he was pretty confused and didn‚Äôt know what she was talking about (this was when he was on a the team). There wasn‚Äôt a second date.
Serge Ibaka has entered the game
IIRC Serge Ibaka and Marc Gasol did that because Embiid understand French which Ibaka spoke to Siakam with as well.
"Probably something like   JT - Kevin Durant  Smart - Russell Westbrook  JB - James Harden  Timelord - Serge Ibaka  Yea, feeling good going into this season... lol"
Serge Ibaka bringing C U L T U R E
think Brook Lopez or Serge Ibaka.
"As you can tell, OG learned a lot from serge ibaka about art"
"in no order top 5: chris paul, steph curry, kelly oubre, ben simmons, paul george  &amp;#x200B;  honorable mention: jayson tatum, jaylen brown, serge ibaka, rudy gay"

You guys think my list is valid? 1) serge ibaka  2) kelly oubre  3) paul george  4) jayson tatum  5) gordon hayward  6) Sga  7) Kawhi leonard  8) zach lavine  9) dillon ‚Äúchad‚Äù brooks  10) kyrie irving
Eric Bledsoe--&gt; Marcus Banks  Paul George--&gt; Scottie Pippen  Kawhi Leonard--&gt; Gerald Wallace  Nic Batum--&gt; Rudy Gay  Serge Ibaka--&gt; Shawn Kemp  --------------  Marcus Morris--&gt; Al Harrington  Reggie Jackson--&gt; Robert Pack  Shawn Kemp and Scottie Pippen would be an amazing duo
Serge Ibaka maybe?
Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka. I can‚Äôt choose which team I hate more so it‚Äôs a tie.
"Matisse Thybulle, Wes Matthews, Serge Ibaka, Bruce Brown"
Probably Serge Ibaka on the Clippers.  Both of the Jays on the Celtics are also in the mix now that I think about it
Toni fucking Kukoc over Finals MVP Tony Parker?  Edit: I'd even have Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka over Toni Kukoc tbh
"I know you aren‚Äôt literally asking but thought it would be fun to think about, Brook Lopez used to be able to have a night like that but I doubt it now, Giannis could do it if he has one of those nights where he he is hot from 3. Jokic isn‚Äôt a big block type of rim protector but maybe he could get up to 5 blks since he is always in the paint. Serge Ibaka if he can ever return to 2019-2020 form. Bubble Anthony Davis could do it but he can just make his jump shots this year. Finally have a feeling Mobley might have a night like that this year even.   If anyone else can think of more love to know."
The Serge Ibaka trade was pretty bad.
Kyle Lowry Jrue Holiday Kawhi Leonard Lebron James Marc Gasol   +   Fred VanVleet Alex Caruso OG Anunoby  Bobby Portis Serge Ibaka
- Kawhi  - Giannis  - Pascal Siakam  - Marc Gasol  - Jrue Holiday  - Fred VanVleet  - Khris Middleton  - Kyle Lowry  - Serge Ibaka
In hindsight most people probably wouldn't trade the championship for it but could you imagine the 2018 core right now coached by Nurse or even just as trade assets? OG DeMar Kyle Serge Jonas Norm Fred Pascal Jak Delon. That team won 59 games at the time and aside from Ibaka all of those players have maintained form or improved significantly. Probably don't get Scottie though.
"Serge ""3rd Curry Brother"" Ibaka"
"If he ""saw red"" someone would have been annihilated. What you are describing is for one, outrageously uncommon as he's basically unphased by anything within the realm of basketball plays, and for two doesn't sound like an issue. If he ""lost control"" then he'd be hitting dudes and getting kicked out. Ron Artest lost control. Kermit Washington lost control. Serge Ibaka has lost control.   I don't think there's anyone in the league right now that has ""lost control"", outside of Stewart, whatsoever. That's a pretty intense hyperbole, especially about Jokic who is about as calm of a guy as it gets. Only moments of anger are in retaliation to someone doing something dirty or dangerous, which is the same as any other player in the league.   I don't even know how this narrative got any traction whatsoever. Guy plays the game like he's gonna fall asleep, doesn't react to his own big plays, gets pushed and mushed all game and doesn't react, and then when he finally does it's that he's an angry guy. Its silliness."
At first I thought it was Serge Ibaka in the side video.
I'm not sure.  I watched Serge Ibaka play a game on ESPN the other day on a G League team while he was coming back.  I think it's going to become more common to play short stints down there for players instead of just rolling them out in the NBA game.
I'd love to see him go the Serge Ibaka route and actually play a few games.  I remember even Steph was once assigned to Santa Cruz.
"Definitely feelin‚Äô the Julius Randle - Z-Bo comparison although Julius is more perimeter oriented with a better handle and playmaking. Z-bo‚Äôs footwork/positioning, low-to-mid-post game was top notch. Maybe someone like prime Paul Millsap?   Sheed is a harder comparison‚Ä¶ maybe Al Horford? Or someone like prime Serge Ibaka with way less blocks and a much more refined post game? Hard to find players with Sheed‚Äôs offensive low post skills, ability to stretch the floor, AND provide All-NBA level defense and major swagger‚Ä¶ loved Sheed! He was always a top level talent that gave zero f*@ks about how you viewed him. Was definitely the x-factor/missing piece on that awesome 2004 Detroit Piston Championship team."
The problem wasn't KD and Russ.  The problem was the people around them.  When Serge Ibaka is the second best shooter on your team that limits what you can do offensively.  Defensively they were pretty filthy and had some versatility.  Still the only team I saw that had the horses defensively against the death line with Russ Waiters (weird I know) Roberson KD and Ibaka.  Problem is that's a bad offensive lineup around KD and Russ if Ibaka ain't hitting his shots.
OKC choosing Serge Ibaka and trading harden to Houston.  That was about to be a dynasty but they threw it all away
Serge Ibaka was such a great jumper and reliable shot blocker for a period of time despite having a 12 inch rod weighing him down.
Serge ibaka i feel like his shorts can be somewhat limiting to him
I remember Serge also throwing a haymaker against the Clippers a few years ago. He missed so I think it was just an ejection. If anything tho we know Ibaka is def willing to get down lol
Serge Ibaka gonna do something. Also when Butler outwardly plays the tough guy its a lot funnier that he doesnt do anything.
Serge Ibaka and Robin Lopez was the last fight that wasn't just a hold me back bro contest
Serge Ibaka def swinging
Robin Lopez and Serge Ibaka!
Serge ibaka
inverse Serge Ibaka
"&gt;ight bro suns are like a C tier team while clippers are F so neither of us can really talk lol.  Lol, the fact you think the Suns are C tier is laughable; Clippers are a better run franchise and have been for the past decade - better owner and FO. Ya'll just finally made the playoffs in over how many year again? And now your dumbass owner doesn't even want to pay the 3rd most important part of your team. It's cute you think the Suns franchise is that much better.  &gt;an injured jazz lol,  Damn, Clippers were fully healthy? Oh wait, Kawhi was out for last 2 games with series tied and Serge Ibaka the entire series. At least the Jazz could have their ""injured"" players contribute.   Once again, watch games more and pay attention to details, that way you won't look like an ass when you reveal that you have no idea wtf you're talking about"
This would of been kobe's and Paul pierce domain.   Kobe the only person that has shown to break down a game and have the respect from us fans to tune in and listen. Pierce is a straight forward dude that's pretty funny.   * They've tried this already with the Kevin garnett show where they brought in guest talking basketball.   You would have to wait for curry and draymond or Serge ibaka and Kd being funny duos. That mafusi chef show was funny.
Stewart had a good 3 seconds face to face with Lebron and did nothing until he got held back. He's not that guy. Guys like Serge Ibaka and James Johnson would be swinging if they wanted to do something
"Serge Ibaka nearly murdered a man with crazy punches but Lebron gets same punishment for pulling his arm away from an arm lock aggressively. How tf should Lebron even be suspended, flagrant 2 and then done. Wasn‚Äôt even intentional (the hit to the face), just reckless."
Like what? Todd their own teammates around? Like that's nothing. We've seen players swing on other players since Malice. We seen Serge Ibaka square up a few times. If he was bout it he could've done something.
arguably Serge Ibaka
"Do you watch NBA games or look just look at BBall Ref. Watch games.   Because the starters are better than the bench unit. Russ‚Äôs net rating is not solely based off of his time running with the starters whereas harden and PG played more with the starters because of Russ‚Äôs reputation as a floor raiser  Is Reggie Jackson/Andre Roberson/Kevin Durant/Serge Ibaka/Steven Adams a stacked team? No, it only through the addition of another superstar that they become stacked"
"Tough, if not I bet they could squeeze a serge ibaka trade in somehow."
"We‚Äôve tried switching everything, it usually gets us killed inside because we haven‚Äôt had any decent rim/paint protection since we lost Serge Ibaka and Marc Gasol.  Swarming and forcing the ball out of the hands of primary scoring options has been more successful for us, but on nights like this where teams are prepared things fall apart fast.   It‚Äôs a gamble really, if the other teams role players miss, you look like a genius.   If they make their shots, you look stupid as hell.  Poole was absolute garbage against us in our previous game against GS, but he lit us up tonight."
"Its not as easy when you dont have kawhi leonard, danny green, kyle lowry, marc gasol, serge ibaka, either"
\**Serge Ibaka pops his head in*\*
you mean Kawhi and Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka? they arent here.
1) the league would protect Lebron. They‚Äôd protect him in terms of not suspending him. They want him to be in games so they can make money of him. Doesn‚Äôt mean Stewart‚Äôs consequences would be any more severe cause it‚Äôs Lebron.  2) go watch the videos of serge ibaka throwing punches those were hardly spur of the moments punches. He had plenty of time to think about it. I actually find Stewart who was dripping blood to actually be way more in the moment.   3) I legit shouldn‚Äôt even have to respond to that third point. It has no logic behind it. Ron artest was suspended for the rest season because he‚Äôs Ron artest. This man was never viewed the same after he hit a fan. It‚Äôs in the same way that Vontaze Burfict was suspended for the rest of the season in the NFL. It‚Äôs hardly because of the act in itself it‚Äôs because of the quantity of violations. So for Stewart to be in the same breath as Ron artest he would need about 5+ more altercations. And maybe even hit a fan.
Either way you meant it you‚Äôre flat out wrong tbh.   Him getting punched by Lebron and then losing his temper and throwing punches in response wouldn‚Äôt even look a quarter as bad as serge ibaka. Who has acted out multiple times by throwing punches. It‚Äôs one thing to lose your cool once it‚Äôs another  thing to do it on numerous occasions and in response to marginal contact.   FACTUALLY  he could have landed multiple punches and still have a Nba career. He‚Äôd  have had to leave Lebron seriously injured for this to even be a discussion. Like hospitalized injured.  But yes agree to disagree.
Serge Ibaka throwing a punch at end of the bench players like James Johnson and Marquese Chris is not the same as punching LeBron James Lmao.
Him clocking Lebron would 100% not end his career. Serge Ibaka has thrown punches on multiple occasions and just got suspended a few games. And that‚Äôs without having been punched first. The nba ain‚Äôt boutta end this mans career over Lebron.
Nah he just practiced   But Serge Ibaka is doing this rn
"They do, Serge Ibaka *just* played 4 games in the G-League on his recovery stint, Siakam didn‚Äôt play but also went down to the 905 earlier this season."
Yes. Serge Ibaka just did it not too long ago too
Serge Ibaka with the 7-step gather.
I think Serge Ibaka got you beat there
Serge Ibaka is an international treasure.
"As a raps fan, I can say Serge is def a real one. I remember the year before the championship we all called Ibaka the Lebron Stopper and he just performed terribly.    The next year, I went to a raptors practice that takes place before the season starts. When I went, I was lowkey chirping Ibaka before he took every shot. I could have never been more embarassed that day. Serge was absolute MONEY and I could tell that he worked on it and made it miles better since last year.   Serge is the definition of working hard and I fucking hate that we let him go."
"Serge Ibaka, Victor Oladipo and Zach Lavine were my first 3 favourite players"
Serge Ibaka.
"He‚Äôs basically a taller Serge Ibaka. Which, if Serge had been 7 foot 2, he woulda been a max player."
"I think what you said about scheming defense that way is key. I found, like you said, KP was at his best as a help defender flying in late for the block, like prime Serge Ibaka used to do from the weak side. For whatever reason, he never quite fit as the sort of anchor of the defense, hanging out in the paint and deterring potential drivers, like Roy Hibbert that one year or a younger Rudy Gobert, or as the guy tasked with bodying up bigs. I think he‚Äôs more of an early 2010‚Äôs 4, defensively, and less of a classic 5."
"I discussed the choice between Serge and James while I was working happy hours when it became obvious the situation was going to expire and most people said keep Ibaka. Living in the state I understood the POV of we cannot carry 4 max level players and I was not upset with owners at the decision.   Ibaka looked like a higher floor and lower ceiling player than Harden at the time to me, and I was very on board with the play level decision as well. We had our 2 greats and I was happy, very soon it became apparent it takes more."
The rest of that kind of proves my point but serge ibaka was there the whole time kd was there.
I mean he turned Serge Ibaka into Paul George in 1 year's time.
*serge ibaka
I believe the clippers but it‚Äôs close  still. I‚Äôll assume the clippers are getting Marcus Morris and Serge Ibaka back to full health and conditioning in this scenario and LAL gets back THT and Ariza. Clippers seem like the more balanced team in this series
"That Serge Ibaka guy seems NBA caliber, Clippers should call him up"
He has let down Serge Ibaka as well
Now i wanna see nba players on Nailed It  With Serge Ibaka as a guest judge
Yeah KD helped Curry as much as Curry helped KD.  the fact that people still  think he was the best player on the 17 and 18 team to me is wild.  That was KD at his best.  An unstoppable 2 way force.  We just saw what he could finally do when his best shooting teammate isn't Serge Ibaka.
That's Nba champion Serge Ibaka
Serge Ibaka would never
*BREAKING NEWS: Utah Jazz sign Serge Ibaka*
Serge Ibaka and Robin Lopez ain't scared to throw hands either
"For me it was Game 4 vs the Mavericks in 2021. The Mavs were up 81-68 going into the 4th, and then Harden looked completely unstoppable down the stretch as OKC outscored the Mavs 35-16 and came back to win 103-97.  &gt;&gt; Oklahoma City kept picking and rolling, and James Harden kept making plays.  &gt;&gt; Instead of giving in and being content going home for a Game 5, the Thunder now are waiting for their next series. Oklahoma City rallied for a 103-97 victory on Saturday night to complete a first-round series sweep of the defending NBA champion Dallas Mavericks.  &gt;&gt; Harden scored 15 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter, including seven in a row and nine in the Thunder's 12-0 run after they trailed by 13 points with 9:44 left.  &gt;&gt; ""I got into attack mode,"" Harden said. ""I was determined to make plays.""  &gt;&gt; After the Harden-fueled surge over 3 minutes got the Thunder within a point, they finally took the lead -- and kept it -- when Russell Westbrook stole the ball from Dirk Nowitzki and passed to Serge Ibaka for a two-handed slam that made it 92-91 with 5:17 left.  &gt;&gt; ""He beat us in individual drives, beat us in pick and rolls. He got up a head of steam and was great,"" Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said of Harden. ""We tried everything, five or six different coverages going. We needed to be better but it was more about how good he was.""  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201205050DAL.html  https://www.espn.com/nba/recap/_/gameId/320505006"
Bet. You vs. Serge Ibaka. Lets see it lol
Are we just gonna ignore that Serge Ibaka playing in the G League?
Any actual fighter that does it for work Would put Ibaka in a box in a hurry. No disrespect to serge cause I love his game.
Sorry but it's Serge Ibaka
Serge Ibaka - coming for your throat
Serge Ibaka? He would let them fly. Never connected that I saw‚Ä¶
Serge Ibaka never landed any punches in his scuffle tho
You gotta give Serge Ibaka some credit. Pretty sure he's missed 1000% of the time lol but he has absolutely thrown some heavy punches over the years.
"Forgot to add, here's a longer version of the first table with the 50 biggest connections. I think Tim Duncan/ Tony Parker are the only pair that show up on both sides of this:  | Shooter | Assister | Number of assists | |:------:|:------:|:------:| | Karl Malone | John Stockton | 1572 | | Tim Duncan | Tony Parker | 1533 | | Kevin Durant | Russell Westbrook | 1466 | | Blake Griffin | Chris Paul | 1157 | | Amar'e Stoudemire | Steve Nash | 1155 | | Marc Gasol | Mike Conley | 1121 | | David West | Chris Paul | 1120 | | Klay Thompson | Stephen Curry | 962 | | Richard Hamilton | Chauncey Billups | 934 | | Richard Jefferson | Jason Kidd | 890 | | Kevin Garnett | Rajon Rondo | 878 | | Carlos Boozer | Deron Williams | 834 | | Shawn Marion | Steve Nash | 823 | | Allen Iverson | Eric Snow | 812 | | Steven Adams | Russell Westbrook | 809 | | Bradley Beal | John Wall | 797 | | Dirk Nowitzki | Steve Nash | 797 | | Antawn Jamison | Gilbert Arenas | 790 | | Ray Allen | Rajon Rondo | 787 | | Zydrunas Ilgauskas | LeBron James | 785 | | Stephen Curry | Draymond Green | 776 | | Serge Ibaka | Russell Westbrook | 774 | | Anthony Davis | Jrue Holiday | 770 | | Clint Capela | James Harden | 760 | | Vince Carter | Jason Kidd | 760 | | Dirk Nowitzki | Jason Kidd | 753 | | Dirk Nowitzki | Jason Terry | 744 | | Mehmet Okur | Deron Williams | 740 | | Marcin Gortat | John Wall | 735 | | Paul Pierce | Rajon Rondo | 727 | | Shaquille O'Neal | Kobe Bryant | 727 | | Tony Parker | Tim Duncan | 713 | | Juwan Howard | Rod Strickland | 711 | | Udonis Haslem | Dwyane Wade | 702 | | Clifford Robinson | Jason Kidd | 694 | | Tim Duncan | Manu Gin√≥bili | 672 | | Klay Thompson | Draymond Green | 668 | | Paul Pierce | Antoine Walker | 666 | | Jermaine O'Neal | Jamaal Tinsley | 648 | | Josh Smith | Joe Johnson | 636 | | Glenn Robinson | Sam Cassell | 633 | | J.J.

Serge Ibaka would like a word
"Yea they choked in the playoffs. Lowry and Dero stats would just drop by like 50%. Not even just them but like Serge would brick every wide open look to the point where no one would play defence on him at the perimeter.   They beat the 76ers by the thread of a needle and it was Kawhi (mostly Kawhi), Green, and Gasol who did it for us, with the surge of Siakam as well. FVV shot 0.071% at the 3, him and Ibaka almost blew that series for us.  Sad part of it is that if the warriors had KD and Klay we probably wouldn't have won, and you wouldn't even hear people talking about Kawhi.."
If you've actually thrown punches that puts you ahead of 99% of the league. So robin lopez and serge ibaka would be my picks
"Fun fact, Serge Ibaka has probably thrown about 50% of punches thrown in the last 10 years in the NBA"
"Tell you who it wasn‚Äôt, Serge Ibaka.   Dude is lucky as hell he‚Äôs got awful aim- because if he actually landed any of the like 4 haymakers he‚Äôs thrown he would have been in massive trouble"
someone i would not want to mess with is Serge Ibaka  the man was a young teenager during the Second Congo War so im sure he has been through and seen some hard shit  and i recall when Marquee Chriss said something to  him and he got up and started choking him and swinging at him
Throwback to Brolo and Serge Ibaka legit trying to punch each other's heads off a couple years back.

Serge Ibaka - Serge Jonas Ibaka Ngobila  JR Smith - Earl Joseph Smith  Nene - Maybyner Hilario  PJ Tucker - Anthony Leon Tucker
"Notice the trends in the East. Also notice the Heat didn‚Äôt win because Jimmy Butler led Heat were not enough against LeBron AD led Lakers. Also It‚Äôs not just Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo was also an All Star at that point.   Also the Raptors have Kawhi a top 5 player, Lowry was playing like an All Star, Siakam was playing like an All Star his MIP season, with Marc Gasol, Serge Ibaka, FVV and all around depth..  Those are a bunch of talents and Star players. And the Raptors still wouldn‚Äôt win if the Warriors didn‚Äôt lose 2 of their star players in KD and Klay"
Serge Ibaka
"wym ""turns back the clock"" we're about to have peak serge ibaka this season  turn clock to now baby"
Serge Ibaka and Draymond according to the publicly available photographic evidence.  RJ according to some former ball boy on tiktok.
Serge Ibaka and Marquese Chriss
"[Serge Ibaka a.k.a Mafuzzy Man, 100% Pure, from the Motherland. Mr. Avec Classe.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/m0yn4o/serge_ibaka_getting_turnt_over_all_star_break/)"
"Joel ""Serge Ibaka"" Embiid"
Serge Ibaka then
They have Serge who can space the floor (hypothetically assuming he and Kawhi come back and he isn‚Äôt traded for Simmons). If they could keep Ibaka and Mann that would be the title contender imo
I don't think it's that uncommon. For example Serge Ibaka was listed as Doubtful the day he had a freaking surgery.
Maybe Serge Ibaka
I mean outside of Kawhi the Clippers are without two really good role players in Marcus Morris and Serge Ibaka. If you watch the games almost every missed Clipper 3 is an in and out thats what a hamburger is all about 3. They arent having bad misses. They're just missing.
"OKC fans dubbed the 2014-2015 season the plagues of Egypt Season.   Our starting line up was Russ Roberson KD Serge Adams  We also had Reggie Jackson until the trade deadline. If I am remembering correct. KD, Russ, Ibaka, and Jackson started the season injured. There are a couple others I think I am forgetting. Russ and KD came back full strength around December only for them to be in and out of the line up the whole year. When we finally traded Jackson and got fully healthy in March KD got injured again. It was horrible. We missed the playoffs by one game on an Anthony Davis buzzer beater basically. It was the season from hell. To top it all off we got the 14th pick which ended up being Cam Payne. One spot behind Devin Booker!"
"No we didn‚Äôt. Ibaka wanted more than a 1 year deal, we wouldn‚Äôt give it to him. We offered him a larger 1-year deal but wouldn‚Äôt give 2. And Serge made the right choice too, considering his injury."
"Burying this comment here for posterity.  My suspicion is that the Clips gave Luke Kennard the extension because they needed a tradeable contract down the road.  The Clips are over the cap.  They're limited in the ways that they can acquire significant talent.  One way is to take on other team's unwanted contracts like they did with Rondo.  You need tradeable contracts for that.  One example of a move that could be made possible by Kennard's contract is Patrick Beverley, Luke Kennard, and the player taken with the 25th pick in the 2021 draft for Al Horford.  The salaries match.  There's a chance the Clips won't have Nic Batum and/or Serge Ibaka next season.  Both can become unrestricted free agents after this season and Serge could possibly miss time due to his health.  Al Horford could slot in neatly as a PF/C who could start or come off the bench at either position, provide shooting, passing, and defense.  The structure of Kennard's contract and the incentive language basically makes it a 3 year $43 mil contract for a team like OKC.  It's not that bad for player who can get his own shot and hit over 40% of his 3s as long as you don't need him to play defense.  His defensive limitations make him a bad fit for teams with championship aspirations but he's a good fit for a rebuilding team that doesn't expect to make deep playoff runs right away."
Serge Ibaka is cool as fuck.
"Im definitely like the only Raps fan that doesnt hate the Clippers. Maybe it different bc I liked Lob City and then like that Clips team b4 Kawhi came with Shai and Lou/Trezz off the bench.  But for me, I dig Balmer bc hes super passionate which is what u want to see from your owner and Kawhi just wanted to play close to home. Im glad he actually went to the Clips and not ruined parity and went to the Lakers.   Raps fans also dont like the the poaching of Ibaka either but Im pretty sure Serge was willing to re-sign but I believe he got disrespected in the contract negotiations by Masai. I think the Raps were trying to play the Giannis sweepstakes and got burned by not giving Serge the extra year while the Clips gave him everything he asked for"
Serge Ibaka injury is being way overlooked
I‚Äôm not watching but is Serge Ibaka injured? I know he had that argument with Rondo but surely they‚Äôre not just going to bench him now. He‚Äôs way too good
"Serge Ibaka, surge protector, Surge Cola‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt matter. Mavs in 4."
"draymond, cp, serge ibaka &amp; ron jeremy due to a miscommunication"
"Lmao apparently you missed it when Z-Bo-MG outplayed TD in the 2011 playoffs, bro I actually watched these teams.  2013 was his first selection since 2007 &amp; that's because Kawhi revived his career, that team was old af.  When Kendrick Perkins &amp; Serge Ibaka are doing shit like having historically great playoff games it means TD fell off.  C was the weakest position in the NBA as well, that was back when Noah was like the #1 C in the NBA lol.    Kawhi had a decent version of TD for 2 years at the most.  2015 the big 3 were unplayable against Okc, see what Adams-Kanter did to the front court especially on the boards.  Jordan was also outplaying TD in the playoffs &amp; the Clippers hunted him on the perimeter, he was a role player at this point,  all centers were."
This made me realize that Serge Ibaka would have to change his last name if he went to Japan
"How many Ibaka games have you seen this year?  Most people's eye test can't differenciate good defense and great defence, but a blown dunk sticks out way more than it should. Not denying Serge is a good vet to have but he's not even healthy atm"
When Serge Ibaka is pissed he gets this look in his eye like he wants to murder someone  Edit: [honestly thought Chriss might die ](https://youtu.be/Qc3pAEeK16A)
Kevin Durant has been a paint presence for years. Him and Serge Ibaka used to be the best paint defense duo in the league. People really just forget his early thunder years where he was top 5 in blocks per game year after year.
Serge Ibaka is the perfect stretch 5 in today‚Äôs league and he‚Äôs making less than $10 million a year.
"I mean I think you‚Äôre being disingenuous if you say that Gary Harris and KCP can do what Ben can do while also saying that Capela can ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù do what Gobert can do. If players like KCP are the bar for perimeter defence, guys like Derrick Favours, Serge Ibaka, Marc Gasol, Nurkic, Draymond, Poeltl , Gifford, Robin Lopez, Giannis, Brook Lopez, Jarrett Allen + more should all count as ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù defensive anchors"
"Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Pat Bev, and Serge Ibaka are also smart/disciplined defenders and Luka‚Äôs still averaging 35/9/9.  He‚Äôs a generational talent and you will see why. If you think Royce O‚ÄôNeal and Joe Ingles are going to contain him then you‚Äôre in for a long series."
&gt;Serge is there long-term as well.   Ibaka has a player option this summer.
"Serge is there long-term as well. Kinda crazy how they still are running Pat Bev and Reggie as their primary playmakers and how they are still using Morris as one of the primary matchups for Luka. Bev can't create in the playoffs (Bledsoe syndrome). Morris can not guard Luka. It's like they learned nothing from the Bubble. Both the Clippers and Bucks disappointed last year, one team greatly changed their defensive philosophy and traded for a legit playmaker (now they look much better suited for the playoffs). The other scapegoated their coach and ran it back, adding Luke Kennard and Serge Ibaka (later Rajon Rondo). Yes, the Clippers lack draft assets, but it's almost like they hardly made an effort."
"Rondo still lives off his Celtics legacy, where KG would chew people out over damn near anything and that's the type of ""alpha"" leadership style that he learned and still tries to apply  Serge Ibaka has been around for long enough to understand the situation in the game and not need to be talked to like a rookie. All that ""Rondo is just a fiery competitor"" don't mean shit when you look at how easily teams have discarded him since Boston"
"Is there something I'm missing about Serge Ibaka?  Every time I see him play, he looks amazing, and he seems like a perfect stretch 4 or 5.  Why is he playing 6 minutes?"
And Serge Ibaka!! Serge was on that Raptors team with Kawhi too
"I've seen him when I was visiting Paris back in 2011, June or July if I remember correctly. He was playing for OKC back then.   We were staying in Hyatt Regency Hotel, very near to Arc de Triomphe. Me and my friend had a nice long walk at the Champs-Elysees and returned our room to take a little nap before dinner. At that time I saw a very tall and slim man walking through only available elevator with a couple of chubby dudes by his side.  I told myself ""I know this guy"" as soon as I saw him but couldn't remember who he was and walked right past him to the stairs as they were justing getting into the elevator. When I climbed two - three stairs it suddenly hit me, that was Serge Ibaka!   Of course I ran back, yelling his name, just before the the elevator door closed but he saw me. I don't remember if he smiled at me but I'd like to think so. I'd probably would've had a chance to take a photo together if I were able to just remember the guy but no big deal. He seemed like a cool dude. People around him? Not so much.  Later I asked myself how the hell I couldn't recognize him, he was pretty popular back then. Blocking everything near the rim. I think back then I'd always believed NBA players were huge. I mean not only very tall but I also wide for their sizes. Ibaka wasn't wide at all at that time. That's probably why I didn't recognize him at first. He was really slim for that height.   Anyway, this was the only time I saw an NBA player outside of a screen and ever since I have a soft spot for him."
"Did not play Serge Ibaka and Luke Kennard, but was perfectly fine letting PatBev and Reggie get cooked over and over"
Why do they play Zubac more minutes than Ibaka. Literally Zubac is a place holder. Can‚Äôt count how many times players just ran right through him. At least Serge helps spread the floor. I don‚Äôt see what Zubac‚Äôs input is...
"I remember last year Ibaka would have his ""Serge butter fingers"" play each game. For Drummond its like every possession."
"&gt;the best 3rd string Center in... NBA history  Just two years ago, Toronto had Serge Ibaka, Jonas Valanciunas, Greg Monroe, Chris Boucher, and Marc Gasol at various points in the same season.  They often had three of them and sometimes played 3 in a game.  3-time MVP Moses Malone was briefly the 3rd-string center for the Buffalo Braves, so he'd be the best ever, by a considerable margin.  As soon as Buffalo traded him, he started posting 14/13 for Houston ( and he had already put up a 19/15 full season two years earlier in the ABA, at 19 years old )."
Leave Serge Ibaka out of this
"He doesn't back away from a challenge, he even guarded Serge Ibaka at one point, showed no fear."
"Basically there's 2 ways, but they're both pretty hard to accomplish.  1) Have at least 3 (and maybe even 4) great to all defense level perimeter defenders. Obviously easier said than done, especially when you realize that most of them will have to be at least competent offensively to avoid bleeding value on that end.  2) Find a 4 that's both a great rim protector and mobile enough to be at least competent on the perimeter and a good enough offensive shooter that he doesn't clog up spacing. The thing is off the top of my head the only 2 players that fit this mold are Serge Ibaka and Anthony Davis. And I'm not even sure Ibaka can play this role anymore since he's getting old. 2016 Draymond would have also qualified."
"That Raptors team had Kawhi added to a quad consistenting of: elite defenders from 1-5 on the starting lineup, a bench of Serge Ibaka, Fred Van Vleet, OG Anunoby and Norman Powell, and a great coach in Nurse.  Kawhi iso was how the Raps broke through and got points against good defensive schemes but otherwise Kawhi was easily plugged into an offence Lowry and FVV were extremely comfortable already running, on top of Siakam making a huge leap that year and presenting as a viable 2nd option on offence. Kawhi didn‚Äôt have to elevate anything like LeBron or Luka would, he was a finishing touch to get an extremely competitive team over the hump.  Tbh hypothetically you could plug a lot of superstars into that roster and expect similar results, but Kawhi being the 2-way monster he is was a big part of shutting Milwaukee down, always fun to wonder how that series would go if it was someone like KD tasked with matching Giannis at halfcourt and corralling him into Gasol/Siakam down low.  That said idk if there‚Äôs a diminished return to adding Luka/Harden‚Äôs playmaking to that roster vs someone you could give the ball to anytime you needed points + could defend the opposing best player. Kawhi could very possibly have been the exact fit the Raps needed in that situation, besides LBJ who can be trusted to do everything lol"
people SERIOUSLY underrate Serge Ibaka as an addition to Clippers
"serge ibaka is the X-factor for the clippers, that dude is so underrated"
Imagine trying to compare KDs finals run to LeBron's without any additional context like that.   Kevin Durant was playing with two other players who would go on to win MVP and another great player in Serge Ibaka. LeBron's second and third best players were Larry Hughes and Zydrunas Ilgauskas
you guys need a center. how about serge ibaka
"""Serge Ibaka level of guys who would have put up bigger numbers if they weren't playing next to legends.""  This reminded me that Ibaka used to play for the Magic."
"Oh yeah, I'm not getting down on you. Just saying...AC Green was a fixture in the Finals throughout the mid-late 80s. He was a role player, but not at all a scrub - sort of the Robert Horry/Serge Ibaka level of guys who would have put up bigger numbers if they weren't playing next to legends.   He was very well known through the 80s and 90s, and to have his name fully disappear like this - when he was a starter on those great LA teams - is pretty mindblowing."
"&gt;Never heard of AC Green,   What the fuck...how old am I.   Imagine in twenty years someone presumably knowledgeable about the NBA saying that they'd never heard of Serge Ibaka. That's what this moment is.   Serious Dust in the Wind moment going on."
Serge Ibaka??? Hes too big to be cute ü§£
The 6'9 center who gets exposed on defense is better than champion Serge Ibaka. LMAO
"I remember when Lakers fans said Montrez Harrell was better than Serge Ibaka, AMA"
Kelly Oubre Cedi Osman D'Angelo Russell Kyle Kuzma Serge Ibaka
Like Serge Ibaka?
Isn't clippers banged up also with serge ibaka and pat bev hurt? if so facing them early on isnt that bad i guess
Yeah we traded them Oladipo and Sabonis for Paul George. We got Oladipo and Sabonis for freaking Serge Ibaka. Idk what the magic were doingm
&gt; The rosters he gets routinely suck ass  Kevin Durant. Russel Westbrook. James Harden. Serge Ibaka.  stop trying to give brooks his flowers when you have never followed a team he's coached.
"I don‚Äôt know why people don‚Äôt mention how Clippers are banged up too. Serge hasn‚Äôt played in months with back issues, Kawhi has ongoing foot stuff.   So when people said ‚Äúthey should take on Lebron early from his return‚Äù   They 100% don‚Äôt want to play against AD without a healthy Ibaka"
Veteran big men come to Raptors to end their careers all the time.  - Tyler Hasbrough - Chuck Hayes - Bismack Biyombo - Anthony Bennett - Luis Scola - Jason Thompson - Jared Sullinger - Pat Patterson - Bebe Noguiera - Greg Monroe - Eric Moreland - Serge Ibaka - Marc Gasol - Aron Baynes

"With an absolutely stacked team including Kevin Durant, Serge Ibaka, and James Harden. I'm not convinced that Westbrook's particular strengths (aside his fastbreak ability) were very helpful on that team and often detracted when he took bad shots instead of passing to KD. I truly believe if you replaced Russ with Andre Iguadala or even Danny Green then those teams would have been even better for a lower salary."
"Why are you talking as if the Clippers are at 100% health and 0% rustiness? Serge Ibaka just came back tonight for the first time in almost three months. Tonight was the first game Rajon Rondo and Ibaka have played together, two of the most important rotation pieces on the team. Kawhi and PG have been dealing with nagging injuries the past month- Kawhi just got out of playing two games in a month. So no, it wouldn‚Äôt be good for the rusty, injured Clippers to play the Lakers with Lebron ‚Äústill rusty‚Äù lmao. But whatever"
I feel like they are pulling a Serge Ibaka. Not the severity but just the mind games so the Suns have to keep Kawhi in mind.
"I feel like passing you have it or you don‚Äôt. You can be Serge Ibaka and put in a million to reps to go form terrible to making the simple play, but you either see the game and how the chess pieces move like Larry Bird or you don‚Äôt."
You forgot Serge 'Game 7' Ibaka
Like Serge Ibaka Spanish legend.
Serge Ibaka credits his development to Kendrick Perkins both on-and-off the court. He used to call up Perkins in the middle of the night sometimes just to vent about his frustrations as a young player.  The Russ/KD Thunder were a defensive juggernaut and Perkins deserves a ton of credit for it. (Please no one talk about our ugly hero-ball offense in those days.)  I always have to defend big Perk whenever people dismiss his playing career.
"Patrick Beverly throwing himself into Russ' knee while he calls timeout and bringing him out of the game for two seasons on-and-off due to complications after the initial long recovery... And then the next time they play, feinting doing it again in the exact same situation.  Reggie Jackson playing selfishly during his first years in OKC to the point where the team froze him out during a game and had Kendrick Perkins and Serge Ibaka bring the ball down the court instead of him.  The Morris brothers having a history of violence and dirty plays.  Rondo quitting on the Mavericks.  Serge Ibaka being a genuinely awesome person while also being more wealthy, more talented, and more handsome than 99+% of the world.  A lot of reasons for the Clippers to be the actual villains of these playoffs, and not just the ""love to root against them"" villain that is Trae Young stunting on fanbases all around the east coast.  (OKC still loves you, Serge)"
"Serge Ibaka with the Clippers, won with the Raptors.   Dwight Howard with the Sixers, Won last year with the Lakers."
"What if:     Harden's knee gets taken out by Beverley and the Thunder drop out of the 2013 playoffs as a result?     Serge Ibaka gets injured in 2014 and misses half of the series against the Spurs and the Thunder lose in the WCF as a result?    Durant injures his foot in 2015, has season ending surgery, Harden also misses half the season and the Thunder miss the playoffs?     They go up 3-1 on the 73-9 Warriors in 2016 but choke the lead away and Durant leaves them to join the team they choked against?     In that scenario, the Thunder with Harden instead of Westbrook don't win any titles.     Seems like a pretty unlikely set of circumstances though."
"Ron arrest vs serge ibaka would be a legendary fight.,"
...and Serge Ibaka.  The Clips are down their best player and their starting center.
This reminds me that it's wild Serge Ibaka is still in the league when his juniors Artest and Kobe are retired.
Serge Ibaka got some competition.
"For some background, the Clips and Kawhi in particular have been very cagey about disclosing the severity of injuries.  For example, Serge Ibaka had season ending back surgery last week, he's been out with the injury since mid-March, and the Clippers didn't disclose the extent of the injury or offer a time table for return until they announced that he had had surgery."
Someone told me Serge Ibaka would be the second best player on the team
Clippers also didn't have Serge Ibaka.... Not sure if that's a big deal though
Serge Ibaka is on our team
Don‚Äôt forget we were missing serge ibaka
clippers generally love to obfuscate injury reports like none of us even knew serge ibaka was having back surgery last week and he was listed as questionable üíÄ
You think mfing Serge Ibaka is a bigger difference maker than Mike Conley?
Ridiculous.  The Clippers *lost Kawhi Leonard and Serge Ibaka for the year* and ***TERRANCE MANN*** is the one who shows up to boot the 1 seed from the West.  What the fuck.
"No Serge Ibaka and no Kawhi Leonard, down by 25, and then here come Paul George, Terance Mann, Pat Bev, Nicolas Kaboom, and Reggie the Big Government Jackson. After 51 playoffs that made Clip fans depressed, they deserve every bit of this conference finals appearance. And so does Mann and PLAYOFF P."
Serge ibaka? A sign and trade with lonzo could work
"Dirk: ‚Äúyup, that‚Äôs a big cock‚Äù  Woj: serge ibaka is the new dallas maverick‚Äôs head coach."
Serge ibaka was listed as doubtful while undergoing back surgery haha
"The Clippers will use the word ""sore"" for an injury and next thing you know the guy's out the whole year. Luc Mbah a Moute had a ""sore knee"" since game 3 of the season a few years back then at the end of the year it was announced he had knee surgery. Similar with Serge Ibaka this year."
"I disagree.  OKC was looking at their team and saw they only have money to pay either Ibaka or Harden. Serge was a starter and a good one so they picked him.   The real mistake was trading James for Kevin Martin then not resigning him either. Letting Jeremy Lamb rot on the bench for years was a bad call too.  Harden never would have became what he is now if he stayed as the sixth man in OKC. He wanted the pressure of being the top dog and he got it in Houston.   His career would have been way different had he stayed in a bench role. And when you look back, he made the best decision for him and his family. Can't fault him for that."
"Here is the whole trade:  - July 20, 2007: The Phoenix Suns trade Kurt Thomas and 2 first round picks (2008 &amp; 2010) to the Seattle SuperSonics for a 2009 conditional 2nd round pick.  - June 26, 2008: The Seattle SuperSonics draft Serge Ibaka 24th overall in the NBA Draft using the first round pick from Phoenix.  - June 23, 2016: The Oklahoma City Thunder trade Serge Ibaka to the Orlando Magic for Victor Oladipo, Damantas Sabonis, and Ersan Ilyasova.  - July 6, 2017: The Oklahoma City Thunder trade Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis to the Indiana Pacers for Paul George.  - July 10, 2019: The Oklahoma City Thunder trade Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers for Danilo Gallinari, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, 5 first round picks (2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 &amp; 2026), and the right to swap first round picks in 2023 &amp; 2025.  The Suns, who triggered all of this madness in 2007? Well, they traded Kurt Thomas for cap relief and a 2009 conditional 2nd round pick. They used that 2009 conditional 2nd round pick they received from the SuperSonics to draft Emir Preld≈æiƒá, who would go on to never play a single minute in the NBA, as is tradition. As for that precious cap relief, the Suns went on in that offseason to sign Richie Frahm who was almost immediately waived, Brian Skinner who would average 3 points and 3 rebounds in one season with the Suns, and acquire a 35 year old Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal from the Miami Heat, who would ultimately cement his legacy as one of the all time greats with rebirth in his new franchise. Just kidding, Shaq averaged 16 points and 9 rebounds in one and a half seasons with Phoenix."
"Here is the whole trade:  - July 20, 2007: The Phoenix Suns trade Kurt Thomas and 2 first round picks (2008 &amp; 2010) to the Seattle SuperSonics for a 2009 conditional 2nd round pick.  - June 26, 2008: The Seattle SuperSonics draft Serge Ibaka 24th overall in the NBA Draft using the first round pick from Phoenix.  - June 23, 2016: The Oklahoma City Thunder trade Serge Ibaka to the Orlando Magic for Victor Oladipo, Damantas Sabonis, and Ersan Ilyasova.  - July 6, 2017: The Oklahoma City Thunder trade Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis to the Indiana Pacers for Paul George.  - July 10, 2019: The Oklahoma City Thunder trade Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers for Danilo Gallinari, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, 5 first round picks (2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 &amp; 2026), and the right to swap first round picks in 2023 &amp; 2025."

But what about the Suns, who triggered all of this madness in 2007? Well, they traded Kurt Thomas for cap relief and a 2009 conditional 2nd round pick. They used that 2009 conditional 2nd round pick they received from the SuperSonics to draft Emir Preld≈æiƒá, who would go on to never play a single minute in the NBA, as is tradition.

"Technically if you take it all the way back   Sam Presti converted Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Serge Ibaka into SGA, a couple promising young guys, and like 300 picks"
What insane to me is that he turned Serge Ibaka into like 6 picks and Shai
"Serge Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, Steven Adams, Cam Payne (lol)"
"Read it more as helped than carried, I don‚Äôt believe any of them were carried to a ring   If the OP can include Serge Ibaka, I think Parrish is fair game   Rodman was a great player but he never won a ring alongside the players I was discussing. I didn‚Äôt include MJ, Kareem or LeBron because I didn‚Äôt want it to turn into a debate about them"
They need Serge Ibaka to provide an extra leg
I need Serge Ibaka vs RoLo and Rondo vs CP3 on the undercard
"I hated it, but every dunker had a specific theme for different dunks that year. It was a super cringey phase in dunk contest history.   That same year as Griffin, Serge Ibaka had a skit earlier in the contest where a small child came out and complained his toy was stuck on the rim, at which point Serge went up and grabbed it with his teeth while dunking. It was the worst, but it was still up to the players to complete the dunks.   In short, while Griffin was probably the most hyped dunker I'd seen come through since Vince Carter in 2000 (thus leading to lots of folks making safe bets like they did with Vince), all dunkers had something preplanned and they didn't all work out smoothly. If Griffin would have failed, I'm sure a couple of the other ""storylines"" (ugh, I hate typing that) would have triggered."
I almost forgot Serge Ibaka plays for the Clippers.
I‚Äôll always respect Serge Ibaka when during the presentation he ensured that Kyle Lowry was the first to lift the trophy over his head. It was a great moment that the whole team celebrated collectively.
"you have patrick beverley, paul george, rajon rondo, serge ibaka, and demarcus cousins on your team"
&gt; OKC management thought both Westbrook and Serge Ibaka would grow much more as players than they did.  I mean WB grew into an MVP and Ibaka was a key piece in a championship.
