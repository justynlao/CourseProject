"I wasnt talking about kevin huerter, i was talking about trae's defense"
Cmon Kevin huerter isn’t that bad
I wonder what Kevin Huerter was smirking at
Alex Caruso is what the blog bois think Kevin Huerter is.
Kevin Huerter looks like he screams racial slurs on Warzone and calls his mom a bitch
"Lmao if you're referring to Kevin huerter, he shoots 38 percent from 3 so idk that he's a scrub"
John Collins Kevin huerter okongwu and this seasons 1st round pick
Kevin Huerter been ballin
"He's just **WAY** too soft and passive. He literally NEVER looks to score first, and got stuffed on two dunk attempts because he went up weak.  I remember tearing out my hair the first time we played because he had Kevin Huerter sealed deep in the post 3-4 times and kept passing it out. Dude **LITERALLY** has 4 inches and 64 lbs on Huerter, he should be able to go through him for a guaranteed 2 every time."
"Here's what I've seen so far.  It's a combination of a slump, adjusting to new teamates, and being pushed into a new role.  \- His floater which is a consistent go-to for him this season hasn't been going in. That makes it harder for him to pressure bigs and get lobs. His shooting has always been up and down, it'll bounce back.  \- His usage has dropped due to the arrival of Bogi and improvements of Deandre Hunter and Kevin Huerter. Less opportunity to score and less shot attempts.  \- The team is trying to run a more egalitarian offense with Trae as the head of the snake. Getting his numbers was different when players were standing still in the corner and he was just spamming pnr. With bodies moving and the ball in his hands less, he  isn't able to dictate the offense to match his tempo like last season. He's adjusting to playing off of others and recognizing when to keep it moving and when to be aggressive. Out of all the players on the team, he has the most to learn especially when it comes to being a floor general, a big reason why Rondo was added to the team.  I think as he improves his off-ball awareness and gets accustomed to the style of play that the team is utilizing, he'll start having better numbers."
"He flourished in ATL with Jeremy Lin ,rooks , his Maryland compadre Kevin huerter."

"I swear Kevin Huerter was incapable of shooting without hitting rim.  Not that he was bricking or anything, he had a solid shooting night, it's just every shot had to roll around on the rim first before dropping."
"Beal for John Collins, Kevin Huerter, Cam Reddish and 2022 first. If you don't think that's enough then swap Hunter for Huerter or add another first."
Kevin Huerter is that you
"That’s a big upgrade over a rookie Cam Reddish, rookie Deandre Hunter, and 2nd year Kevin Huerter"
Kevin Huerter is who the Hawks thought they signed with Bogdanovic
"I loved Amin, right up until that statement. Grossly underrating Fox. Also this statement is inherently disrespectful lol.   Kevin Huerter is who Joe Ingles thinks he is"
Let's say it'd be roughly the equivalent of an NBA expansion team getting Kevin Huerter and having him average 29ppg and getting Dwight Howard and having him be a DPOY candidate
yeah but come on we literally can look up [2017 Lonzo rookie highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtnQjJCdYd8) and he was dishing everywhere.  I love Lamelo and personally think he will be great.  Just wait til players like Marcus Smart are on him and not Kevin Huerter and Nickeil Alexander Walker
"Gallonari, reddish/bogdan(whoever doesn’t start), rondo, kris Dunn, Kevin huerter, onyeka okongwu...  This is deeper than most teams(sadly 5 of these guys are injured right now), and Gallo is maybe the best player coming off the bench in the league. Not including tony snell or Solomon hill who both got solid minutes last year. Near last huh"
Kevin Huerter needs to grow a big beard and cover his body with tattoos for the jinx to end.
"Why would the Sixers ever trade Shake Milton? He's making 10 million less per year than Kennard.   I could see the Hawks trading Rondo, but definitely not for Luke Kennard when they already have...  * Trae Young * Bogdan Bogdanovic  * Kevin Huerter * Cam Reddish  * De'Andre Hunter * Kris Dunn  * Brandon Goodwin   ...to fill out their their ball-handling wing role. Also Rondo makes 10 million less per year as well."
"The Hawks haven’t had bad player development though   Trae Young, DeAndre Hunter, John Collins, Kevin Huerter are all players who improved a lot under Pierce. Even Reddish improved a ton through out last season.   It’s more the GM’s fault for making their roster so reliant on young players, while also having glaring holes in their roster last year. Now that they have a more complete roster, we can judge Pierce more accurately"

Kevin Huerter would like a word
"Trae Young John Collins Cameron Reddish DeAndre Hunter Onyeka Okungwu Bogdan Bogdanovic Kevin Huerter or Clint Capela  The expansion team would likely be a lap to choose a solid bet from either Danilo Gallinari, Clint Capela, or Rajon Rondo"
"I think they’d rather keep those u listed because of their fit around trae young, and they just drafted onyeka okungwu, plus they will need to extend trae and possibly Kevin huerter. Yes I’d rather keep Collins over caplea but they like the pick and role with him and trae. And Collins wants a max and he’s def not worth it yet. Would u rather have a massive overpay or those three to add depth to a contender?"
"Kevin Huerter is 6'7"" and absolutely lethal from 3 even with coverage. It made sense defensively, but that shit got flipped on it's head once we got the stop and Bullock had to actually handle the ball"
Losing a rebound to fuckin Kevin Huerter is not good
"Kevin ""omg it's so big that's gonna"" Huerter got a taste of his own medicine it seems"
I would take Kevin Huerter on my team this season over Klay to be fair.  So yes.  Next season if both are available then I would take Klay.
"In that case, is Kevin Huerter better than Klay?"
John the Baptist Collins?  Kevin 'Ron Threesly' Huerter?
Random ass double double from Kevin Huerter
"Please don't forget Kevin ""omg that's so big it's gonna"" Huerter. He can go off- he singlehandedly kept us in a competitive game against the Grizzlies last week in the 1st quarter."
"I can't wait until I can say the same when a Hawks highlight says Kevin ""omg that's so big it's gonna"" Huerter"
Kevin Huerter is the white Tyler Herro
"This is exactly why I made this thread. As a hawks fan, I would probably give up Capela(similar player) a future 1st and Kevin Huerter. I'll admit I haven't watched a lot of suns basketball so my perception could easily be skewed on Aytons value."
I feel this the most with Huerter. It's like Pierce had no idea what to do with him. Kevin should be top 10 in 3p percentage right now if Llyod would of just focused on his strengths which is his length and stroke but he was so fixated on trying to turn him into a multi-position wing that he hampered his game then when we drafted two players that could do it better he just gave up on Kevin. You could see it in how Pierce just gave Kevin's role to Bogdonovic at the beginning of the season and nonchalantly gave it back because we're simply back to no one being able run the offense except for Trae like last year.
"Atlanta Hawks general manager Travis Schlenk proudly waited outside the visiting locker room to give Trae Young and the players on his victorious new look team an appreciative fist pound on Tuesday night. Injured forward De’Andre Hunter yelled out “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Kevin Huerter gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Rajon Rondo yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Young hit the locker room door, former NBA great Dominique Wilkins hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"I mean SGA isn’t exactly common initials and Shai is a pretty popular player so it makes sense, and most somewhat knowledgeable fans should be able to figure out who it’s talking about pretty quickly. If it was something like KH (Kevin Huerter) then you might have a point"
The hawks starting wings were Kevin huerter and tony snell. It’s not like we had our two actual great defensive wings out there
Kevin Huerter deserves 0 slander for his play compared to half the clowns on this team. Can be a little inconsistent but brings it every night mentality wise. Snell has been great too recently
"The injuries with this team are unbelieveable.  We now have the worst bench in the NBA again and are down two/three starters from last year if this turns into a longterm issue.  Anyone who projects this Hawks record as a failing on Trae Young is either an idiot or is making an argument in bad faith.  Trae was just out there with Tony Snell, Skylar Mays, Okongwu, and Kevin Huerter in the early half of the 3rd quarter"
"A team to match us on players out in those trying times! Anyway, expected lineups for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Expected Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (10-21) | [](/ATL)Hawks (13-17) ---|---   D. Garland |   Trae Young  C. Sexton  | Kevin Huerter Isaac Okoro | Tony Snell  Dean Wade |  John Collins  Jarrett Allen |  Clint Capela  &amp;nbsp;  **May not play:**   [](/CLE)Cavaliers (10-21) | [](/ATL)Hawks (13-17) ---|--- Outback Jesus (OUT)  | B. Bogdanovic   (OUT) K. Love (OUT) |   K. Dunn (OUT)  L. Nance (OUT) :( |   D. Hunter (OUT)  A. Drummond  (OUT) |  C. Reddish (OUT)  T. Prince   (OUT) |"
"1. Luka  2. Trae  i think 3-5 is some combo of Ayton/SGA/JJJ based on team fit.  6-12 is  probably some combo of Bridges\^2, MPJ, Sexton, Wendell, and Bagley        Players bumped down:  2) Marvin Bagley  6) Mo Bamba  9) Kevin Knox       Players bumped up:  11) Shai  14) MPJ (just with the knowledge he stayed healthy)  19) Huerter (maybe)  37) Gary Trent  45) Diallo  46) Melton  54) Shake"
"Repeat from a similar post a few weeks back:  Kris Dunn over Hield and Jamal Murray hurts  Trading #19 (which was Kevin Huerter) for Adreien Payne and then taking Okogie at 20 (the back end of that draft was mediocre to be fair)  The Butler trade was a year too early and he clearly didn’t fit with Wiggins/KAT personality-wise  Some bad luck (missed out on Bam by two picks) compounded by bad decisions (taking Justin Patton with OG and Jarrett Allen on the board, drafting Culver with Rui and Cam Reddish available, could have stayed at 11 and had Herro/PJ Washington/Cam Johnson).  Missing out on two top-10 picks inside of 4 years will hurt any franchise. Add in poor player development and the “we’ve gotta make the playoffs!” mentality, and you’ve got a recipe for a disaster. The Wiggins trade was just another cherry on top"
"Lloyd Pierce is holding bit of them back. I understand Trae needs to be more of a team player but giving him half of his usual touches and giving the rest to Kevin Huerter isn’t the way to do it. John Collins is a bit overrated in my opinion. However, he is a good defender and quality stretch bigs don’t grow on trees"
"Lloyd Pierces time is up. Why the fuck is Kevin Huerter getting more touches than Trae in the 4th? Why isn’t Skylar Mays getting more minutes? Why aren’t you adjusting against Julius Randle? If someone is that hot, you just straight up deny him a shot. Make him pass."
Cam Reddish and Kevin Huerter really wanted to lose this game
"Give me Trae Young, Kevin Huerter and Gallo"

Kevin Huerter know your place
Kevin huerter is the whitest looking dude in the NBA since Larry Bird and this dude can fucking cook it’s hilarious
kevin huerter is honestly so underrated
"Kevin Huerter, Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, TJ McConnell, Joe Harris &amp; Grayson Allen would all like a word with you."
"Well the Hawks do have Trae “balding Steph” Young and Kevin “Redhead Klay” Huerter, so..."
"I presume the pecking order is primetime, local tv, radio, etc. Usually it'll be whoever has a big game, but obviously you try to mix it up so you don't have the high scorer doing every single postgame on tv.  When I went to look for the rest of the clip, Kevin Huerter was doing one [for twitter too](https://twitter.com/ATLHawks/status/1378898893887434754)"
In 22 games this college season 6’7 Hyunjung Lee averaged 13.5/4/2.5 on 51/44/90 shooting splits for Davidson.  He’s currently a sleeper second round pick/might go undrafted but imo he’s the next Joe Harris/Duncan Robinson/Kevin Huerter type player. He has the perfect skill set to be a high impact role player.
Um Kevin Huerter would like a word...
"If Kevin Huerter would of quit pussyfooting with the ball and jet it across half court. It's easy to dog on Trae when he's the only dude on this team with the killer mentality, which is why a Ball or Powell trade should of been pursued more heavily than trading for Lou."
"So happy we won, but I still don’t fw kevin huerter, he needs to be benched"
Hawks fans mad as fuck at Kevin Huerter but I know he sold at the end of regulation because he saw Trae's box score stats and wanted to give him an opportunity to fix his shooting splits. What a bro for real  Still hope him and a first round pick ends up in a Pistons uniform next season for Saddiq Bey Insha'Allah
Fuck Kevin huerter
"I hate the NBA refs so much, this game has been so bullshit   Side note, Kevin huerter is a bad NBA player"
"Hawks has Trae, Kevin Huerter, D Hunter and John collins in their starting lineup."
"Kevin Huerter, hawks could throw him in a package to try and get another wing like Norman Powell"
I think this game gave us Kevin Huerter
"Hawks were in control after a very good 1st quarter from the kings. The kings had a good 4th to bring it close, but in the end it just wasnt enough.   Fan take for 1st game all year of kings I've seen  I hate to say it but I really think the kings may have to tank a few more years to get Fox help. Buddy Hield is stealing a living, he looked washed last night. Fox had an Incredible game, but he just has to get his buckets through 3 guys every possession, it's hard to do that consistently, he needs help. Call me a hater but bagley didnt look good either. Lots of jumps on fakes, fouls, and missed shots. Richaun holmes is a tank of a player and hilarious to watch - I'd hate to play against him. Now that LP has been fired, walton is the worst coach in the nba.   Hawks side - Trae looked fucking great last night. 28 points on 5/10 from three 🤩. Snell is looking like a legit starting option IMO. Hes not a box score champ but he defends well and moves the ball. Kevin Huerter is very hit or miss for me, I like the reads he makes but he has to be more aggressive in the midrange, hes got a great feel around the high post. Capela could've been an all star, and he is still manhandling grown men. He had a great game, the hackapella was lame as fuck from L alton. JC looks like hes let the contract situation get to him - hes not playing calm and collected and seems to be forcing the action quite a bit, disrupting the flow of things. Gallinari has been an integral piece of the hawks current 4 game streak, and is starting to look like the guy who got paid to be the vet. Amazing assists, slo mo drives to the rim, mid range turnarounds, and of course his 3 ball. Still a traffic cone but hes looking more comfortable on a game by game basis and we are reaping the benefits of this. Bogi has been anemic but he will come thru, hes very out of rhythm right now and will get back into the swing of things come playin tournament time.  Skwah on 4 game win streak, first since 2018 and it's a gr8 day to be a hox fan."
"I like to shit on Huerter because he’s a frequent offensive liability.   He has progressed in almost no measurable fashion. His shooting splits are almost exactly the same as they were two years ago when he was a rookie. Per 36 minutes he’s effectively the same player he was last year. I mentioned it in another comment, but I’ll repeat the fact that he looks like a deer in the headlights when he’s forced to create.  I think he gets better with the return of Deandre and Bogdan because it’ll spread the floor but as of right this second, I don’t think he should be starting and hope Bogdans minutes/play come back soon.   I WANT Kevin to be a long time starter, but right now idk how that happens."
Kevin “Front Rim a wide open three” Huerter has entered the chat.
Lol norm Powell just casually waving off Kevin huerter trying to pass him off to nobody defensively like he’s Andre Roberson from 3
the Kevin Huerter/Klay Thompson comparisons were always baffling
Remember when you said you didn't want to trade 6 and your boy Huerter for Ball?   Another great take.  But doesn't beat your Kevin is just a more athletic Klay.

"Kevin Huerter, Sam Perkins"
"Hawks fans loved that game, it got us Kevin Huerter"
How about we just let Tyler Herro and Kevin Huerter go at it 1 vs. 1.
"I’d say our MIP this year is very clearly Kevin Huerter.   He’s been so much more aggressive in hunting his own shot, penetrating and making the right plays with the ball in his hands, and defensively not being a turn style.  He’s been consistently available to play (minus those two games he missed with a shoulder stinger) which has been HUGE with all the injuries we’ve had this year. He’s just been consistent and very solid all year long."
"Right and guys like Goodwin and Dunn aren't going to matter, but being able to bring dudes like Gallo and Kevin Huerter off the bench is definitely solid   and our 8 man rotation is nice.   We are deep but its mostly due to the team being decimated by injuries throughout the year. I dont think any hawks fan is expecting Brandon Goodwin to get big time playoff minutes, but guys who are in our playoff rotation have all started multiple games throughout the year due to injury and have all performed.   Obviously last night isn't going to happen every game where our bench is +38 or whatever but the problem with previous hawks teams is that when Trae sat we became hapless, and that no longer appears to be the case"
He realises Kevin Huerter is dropping him dimes like LaMelo was at Chino.
Kevin Huerter looks like Michael Rapaport in True Romance
I’ll go with Kevin Huerter as well. I’d say he is a little too close to “good” though.
Kevin Huerter. not too good but not too bad
"I agree, a better search might be something like DBPM &gt; 0, 3PAr &gt; .5 so you can see people who have a positive impact on defense and take the majority of their shots from 3  I can't see the full results on Stathead, but of the 20 players the 10 who show up are Maxi Kleber, Josh Hart, Donte DiVincenzo, Lonzo Ball, Jae Crowder, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Pat Connaughton, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Kevin Huerter so it checks out with OP's list"
"He's definitely improved this season, especially on Defense.   However, he's still more of a solid bench player at this point because he hasn't made a huge jump on offense as compared to some of the other guys that play the same position (DeAndre Hunter, Bogdan Bogdanovic).  The future looks bright for Huerter. We'll see how he performs in the playoffs, but one thing is for sure. He has a TJ McConnell type of ceiling when it comes to playing on-ball Defense. Hes averaging the most steals on the Hawks this season (also his career best) and it seems under Nate McMillan he's only going to get better.  As for the Klay Thompson comparison, I don't think that holds up too well at least so far in his career. Kevin isn't as good of a shooter even though he's one of the many 3p threats on the Hawks. In my personal opinion, Klay is a super high IQ basketball player and his in-game decision making is what separates him from a lot of guys. Huerter is young but he hasn't shown that kind of brilliance yet. Although he has potential so you never know."
"That just seems like some random european last name from Germany or something, plus Kevin 🤷    Edit: I actually misunderstood what were talking about 😅 , you're 100% right it's kevin huerter"
kevin huerter
Did you say Kevin Huerter?
This just sounds like an alias Kevin Huerter would use if he ever commits a crime.
"&gt;no idea how they got blown out by the Pistons though the night after  half the team is injured.   Trae Young, Lou Williams, DeAndre Hunter, Cam Reddish, Tony Snell were all out and Kevin Huerter and Brandon Goodwill both left the game injured."
"Kevin Huerter for the Hox is Red Velvet more frequently on our sub, imo"
"Kevin Huerter is *Red Velvet*, not *Red Mamba*"
"How did you pass up on John ""The Baptist"" Collins?      Also, Kev's nickname is Red Velvet, or Kevin ""What she don't know won't"" Huerter"
"It's because you put the space before the period on #14 and have no space on #23 and #24, here's a fixed version   1. Luka Doncic  2. Trae Young  3. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  4. Michael Porter Jr  5.

Here's a more accurate depth chart  PG: Trae Young/ Lou Williams/ Kris Dunn / Brandon Goodwin  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic/ Kevin Huerter  SF: Deandre Hunter/ Tony Snell/ Cam Reddish  PF: John Collins/ Danilo Gallinari/ Solomon Hill  C: Clint Capela/ Onyeka Okungwu/ Nathan Knight  Imo Tony Snell has taken the backup SF from Cam this season. But there's still some basketball left to be played and he could take it back if he returns from injury.
I heard someone say Kevin “so big it might” huerter and it made me chuckle
Kevin Huerter+DeAnthony Melton =a solid two way player
Kevin huerter is who Tyler Herro wants to be
"Sorry buddy, Kevin Huerter has that name taken"
I thought Kevin Huerter was red velvet?
"Because of Lloyd Pierce, he wasn't a good coach for the Hawks. After Nate M took over, u can clearly see the difference and see why the Hawks have been great. They have Trae, Collins, Capela, Bogdan (who is playing out of his mind), Cam, Hunter, Kevin Huerter, and bunch of other role players. They have more talent and firepower compared to the Knicks who only have Randle and Barrett. The Knicks role players are solid, but the hawks role players are just better talent and skill wise. The Hawks prob would have won this game if their key players were healthy. The Hawks were winning before Trae got hurt as well."
"Let's put it this way:  |Position|2017|2018| |:-|:-|:-| |PGs|De'Aaron Fox, Lonzo,  Dennis Smith Jr., Monte Morris|Luka, Trae Young,  Colin Sexton, Jalen Brunson| |Wings|Tatum, Mitchell, OG Anunoby, Kuzma, Hart, Dillon Brooks, Kennard|SGA, MPJ, Bridges (both), DiVincenzo, Kevin Huerter| |Bigs|Bam, Jarrett Allen, John Collins, Bryant, Markkanen|JJJ, Ayton, Wendell Carter Jr., Bagley, Robinson|  Looks pretty even to me. 2018 has way better PGs. 2017 has way better wings. Bigs are pretty even, though I lean toward 2018- didn't even include Robert Williams on that list."
"To me, Herro is what Kevin could be if he was more aggressive in hunting his shot. I think Huerter also has the edge in playmaking chops but Herro definitely has more upside"
"&gt; Kevin ""So Big It Might"" Huerter  I'm fucking dead hahahaha"
"Hawks gotta be up there. You're losing Trae, Clint, and JC.  LouWill, Bogi, Gallo, De'Andre Hunter, Nathan ""The Dark"" Knight, Kevin ""So Big It Might"" Huerter, Cam Reddish, Tony Snell, Okongwu all left over. Pick your poison"
"Lmao at least you got to miss the games. How does that even affect your record? We had SEVEN players out for a recent stretch. The only people to only miss 1-2 or less are Kevin Huerter, Solomon Hill, and third stringers.   So were we.   Oh and going by that logic, Boston’s first run with your current young core should have been a dud huh   Yall beat him once LOL and it’s a new team 🤡"
"He’s the only reason the hawks aren’t the 30th worst defense in a starting lineup with trae young, bogdon bogdonavich, Kevin Huerter, and Solomon hill. Not to mention atrocious defenders like Lou Williams and gallinari and a mediocre guy like John Collins. Capela is a monster at protecting the rim while bam isn’t, which is by far the most important part of center defense."
I’m so happy with how well Kevin Huerter has been playing recently. He’s a sniper.
Kevin Huerter is goof

Kevin Huerter fkin went off on me in 2k yesterday

Kevin Huerter statline making me feel nauseous fr
"Huerter Stat line 0-7, 0 rebounds, 0 assist, -20, a clear path foul    We had Kevin Durant all Time great game last night. Tonight is the huerter low"
"Kevin Huerter has to be up there. I didn’t know he was a solid defender til this series.  But including those who have been eliminated, Dillon Brooks. He looked so ready to show the world what he’s made of."
"I think team USA would be foolish to not ask Kevin Huerter, unless of course he is to busy winning finals MVP"
Tonight will be known as the Kevin Huerter game
"our sub turned into a wolves' sub and stole their CSS that one time when we wanted them to win so we got their draft pick (which became Kevin ""it's too big you're gonna"" Huerter) so I feel like part of me is still one in spirit"
"When you’re as young and spongey as the Hawks, having even one two-way guys actually really changes your playoff rotation and ability to swing momentum quarter to quarter. Ironically, the most consistent guy on both ends of the floor for us is Kevin Huerter who averages 10 ppg and was considered a sieve defensively as lately as last season.  The loss of Hunter is a pretty big deal for us. No it’s not as big a loss as Kyrie or Kawhi, but that’s because the overall star power on this team is like a full tier below the Clippers and the Nets lol."

"Counting those that have been eliminated, I think Derrick Rose earned himself a nice payday with both his regular season and playoff performances.  Dillon Brooks too, he was ready for the big moment. Shoutout Kevin Huerter as well, money from deep."
Kevin Huerter is gonna get a bag. He's an elite 3-point shooter and has been a lock down defender all post-season.

The Kevin Huerter game
"Shake Milton or Kevin Huerter, Landry Shamet &amp; Bruce Brown probably, Mikal Bridges"
Joker did a foul exactly like this earlier in the session against Hawks which resulted in Kevin Huerter injuring his shoulder and missing several weeks. Same type of foul with excessive force. Look at his windup lol. Definitely some frustration there.    Definitely a flagrant but ejection is a bit excessive in a playoff game.   Edit: excessive in my use of excessive
"Very well put; while reading I was thinking of the likes of DRob, Joe Harris, Kevin Huerter, Ben Mclemore and Trae who have perfect rhythm dips"
Please Kevin Don't Huerter
By getting guarded by Kevin huerter?
Nah.  I unironically like Kevin Huerter. Dudes a beast in 2k
"Happened to Kevin Huerter. When we was originally recruited to Maryland, he was like 6'1"" or so. Had growth spurt and grew to 6'7"" and now we're here."
"Hawks maybe. Depending on what the do with Collins(18-24mil), Trae max coming(All-NBA selection could increase the value), Kevin Huerter will be extended the same time(around 15mil). So you could have the team locked in on Trae, Collins, Hunter, Huerter, Capela, Bogdanovic. So they have 2 years before they start paying some huge tax if they keep everyone   Hope their players develop and can probably get to finals within that time frame"
"atlanta; john collins will need a new contract this year; tre young extension (rose rule) next year. kevin huerter as well. add to that gallo, capela, bogdonovic already on roster, 2022-23 they will be luxury tax."
"Literally nobody on the bench scored until the third quarter, were out here arguing about Kevin huerter averaging 20ppg and acting like it’s normal for the sixers bench to literally do nothing."
"The Hawks should give this core another year.    I think they need a defensive power forward.  They should look to move Danillo Gallinari for a defense-first player in my opinion.  They can give the keys to Kevin Huerter to be the number one option off the bench.  Perhaps Serge Ibaka?  Dorian Finney-Smith?  John Collins' value looks a bit low, so they should probably hold and look to do something next offseason via a sign-and-trade."

Kevin Huerter is in. Time to get serious
"MJ is pretty good, but come on man, he's no Kevin Huerter."
"It'll be hard to pass 1984, but early returns say 2018 is already making a case to be the best draft ever. Ayton, Luka, Trae, MPJ could be equivalent to Hakeem, MJ, Stockton, and Barkley when it's all said and done.  Admittedly, passing those top 4 will be EXTREMELY tough to do by any metric, but aside from the star power, 1984 wasn't that deep, and 2018 is.  Alvin Robertson, Kevin Willis, and Otis Thorpe were the only other all-stars in 1984, but 2018 also has SGA, Mikal Bridges, Sexton, JJJ, Mitchell Robinson, DiVincenzo, Devonte Graham, Okogie, Grayson Allen, Anfernee Simons, TimeLord, Shamet, Brunson, Bruce Brown, and Huerter. Even Bagley too.  Now obviously not all of those guys will be all-stars, or even close, but if when it's all said and done and the 2018 core 4 end up close to 84, there will be WAY more overall production and amount of quality players from 2018.  To be in year 3 and already have 24 quality NBA players from one draft is just bonkers."
Basically picture Kevin Huerter or Jae Crowder
"Who gives a fuck how he feels. shut your mouth, stop playing like a 7’3” Kevin huerter and maybe you’ll have better success. For fucks sake if he had 2-3 go to post moves he would be way more valuable than he is currently.

Did you not watch the game? Blatant kick ball. Inbound pass huerter tried to get Nate to challenge and the ref literally pushed Kevin out of the way so they could inbound. The officiating was the ONLY thing keeping this from being a Blowout.
He'll shut the haters up when he locks down Bogdan Bogdanovic and Kevin Huerter next game and Trae drops 40 on Danny Green. Defensive player of the year? 😤😤

"The Hawks are 100% win now. Trae Young is playing well enough to contend on a rookie contract. Now is one of the best times to try and win before Trae is on a supermax. Trae, DeAndre Hunter, Kevin Huerter, John Collins, these guys are all on a huge discount which has allowed for an Atlanta team that is stupid deep. You’re going to be very surprised how well they handle Philly, if Embiid never makes it back healthy Atlanta will be in the ECF"
Sounds a lot for the hawks. I can see the hawks doing the deal if Okongwu is replaced by Kevin huerter. The draft pick would be a second rounder.
Its very early and still a lot of panning out for these guys but honestly I think this is better overall than both because of how deep it is guys like landry shamet jalen brunson kevin huerter robert williams devontae graham late first rounders early second rounders having some pretty solid roles on good teams so mix in the top guys of the draft with all the other good role players and its super well rounded
"Is Kyle Kuzma young? If yes then he is my answer.  And then, Jordan Poole, Kevin Porter, Kevin Huerter, Lonzo Ball.  Technically not an all star but is pretty much there is SGA and Ja."
"We are rivals now, Trae is a star, DeAndre Hunter is really good, Kevin Huerter is kind of dirty (don't worry so were we)"
"KEVIN ""OMG IT'S SO BIG THAT'S GONNA"" HUERTER"
The NBA community really replaced him with Kevin Huerter in a heartbeat though
"im not rly talking about you, it's more aimed at this sub who just thinks matchup exploitation happens so easily. Other teams DID try to hunt Trae, and it didn't just not work cuz of other team's personnel. It's cuz our team D helped him out.   We had Kevin Huerter exploiting Seth's D in game 7 to singlehandedly win us the game and yet you're telling me Jrue/Khris/Drose/Tobias/etc cant do what Kev does on offense? Maybe there's a TEAM reason"
"In his defense, iPhones auto correct Bogdan to Brogdon. But yeah that was The Kevin Huerter Game"
This is an absolutely fucking wild question.   Can Kevin huerter reach the level of prime McGrady?
That's just a select few I would love to see join in. Hell I'd have Kevin huerter out there if it was my day lol
Kevin Huerter destroyed The Process
Nah. They don't want Kevin Huerter. They'd want K'Von Huerter.
Is it too late to have Kevin Huerter replace him as the token white guy?
Now they’re saying it’s Kevin Huerter
Yeah Kevin Huerter as well would of been a great addition. Had all the chromosomes needed to be a great US National Team player!
He would guard Kevin huerter a lot better and he can create offense at a way higher level than curry. At a certain point you need the best players possible regardless of contract.   Also every good teams has huge wings that curry can’t guard
"Not to say you’re not making a good point, but Kevin Huerter is a really solid young player. There are far, far more embarrassing guys to be torched by."
"That’s because the hawks only had big wings, bigs, trae, and Lou will. He got hunted by Kevin huerter during the series, but there isn’t much he could do then because the almost the entire hawks roster was big.    Unless you have a lineup of all 6-4+ (and anyone shorter than 6-7 needs to be beefy too) players, you are getting hunted by big wings in the nba now.  Kyle lowry’s squad got cooked by tatum last year. He’s not going to stop Kevin huerter any better."
"&gt;Fournier, Joe Harris, RJ Barrett, Danny Green, OG Anunoby, P.J. Tucker, Justin Holiday, Saddiq Bey, Isaac Okoro, Patrick Williams, Kevin Huerter, Cody Martin, Jimmy Butler, Dwayne Bacon, Beal, MPJ, Okogie, Pokusevski, Norm Powell, Bojan Bogdanovic, Mo Harkless, Mikal Bridges, LeBron, Kawhi, Oubre, Dorian Finney-Smith, Jae'Sean Tate, Kyle Anderson, Brandon Ingram, DeRozan  There's ESPN's list of starting SF's in this league. Who can't he guard here? LeBron? If that's the standard to hold people to then noone can defend the 3.   That list is chopped liver. That list is ass^2.   The problem isn't Klay at the 3. It's your other 2 perimeter defenders are too small to guard the 3 and not good enough to defend premiere 1's and 2's. Klay at PG, SG, and SF is a good defensive team. Andre checked the Wing's because he does have more size (fair) but also because Klay was taking their best guard (most often the best player on the opposing team). He didn't get the assignment because the Warriors had another premiere defensive wing so he didn't have to, not because he couldn't."
This is dumb. Curry got taken play after play in game 7. By Kevin huerter.
So here is the thing I don't know if my Hawks will be able to keep Kevin Huerter. I hope we can but he probably wants to be a starter full time so more than likely I think we can keep him next year for his final contract year then may do a sign and trade

Hard sleeping on Kevin Huerter
"Beyond Jamal Murray a healthy Kemba Walker but that's alas a thing of the past and you saw how a diminished Kemba hurt Boston in this regard. Lowry would help in that he moves off ball better, has real gravity from 3(unlike Jrue) and is a better passer but still feels like they need a more creative dynamic scorer. Lowry is 80% 3s+layups for shit profile and not a consistent half court scorer as is.  But alas this is also the issue finding a guy to do all these things, and Lowry would still help youre right. If we're thinking lesser non all star versions of this guys like Kevin Huerter, Collin Sexton, Malik Beasley, Devonte Graham, Goran Dragic, Tim Hardaway. The only of those guys though who might even be remotely realistic is Graham, who will help but at some point if you can only shoot 44% at the rim that's so detrimental in a playoff setting it might just entirely cancel out whatever benefits he provides."
Enough Kevin Huerter erasure
"They were going against Lou Williams and Kevin Huerter lol. The ECF after Giannis’ and Trae’s injuries were a glorified play-in matchup. Actually, those teams wouldn’t make the play-in in the West after those injuries."
Your completely forgetting  Kevin huerter who was the main reason Philly lost game 7 and deandre hunter in the first round before his injury forced him out of the playoffs was crucial and good on both ends that whole series vs NY. Bogi was great against the knicks but his knee injury kind of hampered him for majority of the playoffs and galo was very hot and cold tbh they definitely helped but the young talent not being afraid of the moment def played a huge role.okungwu was also very impressive at jus 20 years old
"On your team above, I would choose Cade Cunningham over Kevin Huerter for a wing (+he can handle the ball).  Also I would for sure have Donovan Mitchell on the team. I wouldn’t worry about the bigs/Cs too much. Only need to carry like 3 at most so you can cut Allen."

"Tyler Herro, Joe Harris, Kevin Huerter, Gordon Hayward, Kevin Love  TJ McConnell, Luke Kennard, Duncan Robinson, Dean Wade, Mason Plumlee  Alex Caruso, Grayson Allen, Garrison Matthews, Pat Connaughton, Cody Zeller"
"It is. Most of his stats accumulated in the regular season are due to the open lanes, transition opportunities, and lack of defense in the regular season. When the playoffs start and strategy becomes key he’s rendered useless. His 15, 8, &amp; 8 turns into 9,7, &amp; 7. That’s like Lonzo’s first year numbers. Give me the elite offensive player any day like Jamal Murray because it’s not like Simmons locks anyone down in the playoffs. Trae ate, Bogdanovic ate, Collins ate, Kevin Huerter ate. Who was Ben “DPOY candidate” guarding. Kawhi and Lebron are great defenders but their offensive game is why they’re both superstars. Individual defense is overrated on contenders because it’s more of a team defensive concept the further you go. Ben shoots 30% on his free throws. No way you take him over an elite PG like Murray who co-led his team to a conference finals. Avg 27, 6, &amp; 5 his last playoffs."
"Could a starting 5 of Kevin Love, Gordon Heyward, Kevin Huerter, Joe Harris and Duncan Robinson qualify for the olympics?"
"Trae Young (22), Kevin Huerter (22), Cam Reddish (21), DeAndre Hunter (23),   John Collins (23), Onyeka Okongwu (20).  Got to be up there for best young cores in the league, especially with how they've almost all proven themselves in these playoffs."

Kevin huerter
"Kevin Huerter did not have a good game. He was -22 on the box score, lol. He was the least effective player on either team."
Lol if Kevin Huerter embarrassed the Sixers imagine what we would do
Kevin huerter
Im beginning to think Kevin Huerter is a fraud..
"Huerter of Kevin, you have been awarded a gold Menace to Society badge. If I see anybody with a Kevin Huerter jersey, I'm staying 50 feet away from you at the least."
Kevin Huerter is actually a 43 year female librarian
I never got to see Kevin Huerter play this series. Hope the kid can make it back to the highlight reels next season.
"I will forever be grateful to Trae Young, Kevin Huerter, and every Atlanta Hawk for putting “Trust The Process” deep in its grave. They should be proud of this run."
I knew the bucks were going to win after seeing Kevin huerter picking rich the kid over outkast
atlanta lost bc kevin huerter chose rich the kid over outkast
"Kevin Huerter was horrible this series. He shot 33.3% FG, 26.5% 3 pt, and 16.7% (lol) FT  vs. NYK: 9.4 ppg on 49.5/45.3/40 shooting  vs. PHI: 13.1 ppg on 43.7/36.2/31.6 shooting"
Now they're saying it was Kevin Huerter.
Kevin Huerter from three point land
"Huerter going from ""K'Von, get the tables"" to ""Kevin, set the tables"" real quick."
"Kevin ""Joe Harris"" Huerter"
huerter is def having a kevin type night
Kevin Huerter does not deserve to be playing over cam reddish or someone else. Bringing the hawks down with all his bricks.
Kevin Huerter is playing so bad this game
"Kevin ""what she dont know wont"" Huerter"
Kevin Huerter.  Edit: I just noticed you're looking for a dunker... Shawn Kemp I guess.
kevin huerter should be the new Cliff Paul
"Cmon man. You did not just say Kevin Huerter and max in the same sentence. I know you said more deserving, but still"
"ya, I was gonna say. 6'7"" long and athletic khris middleton 10 feet away from the hoop guarded by a shorter, slower kevin huerter who has obviously never defended anyone in the post is a good proposition  posting up a random center against another random center is mostly a bad proposition. even the best-best post scorers still struggle to generate points as efficiently as a you get from decent 3pt shooters. it's just really hard to score in ISO situations.   what teams could do, and maybe should do, is run more motion and take advantage of cutters or mismatches, so if you have a good post scorer you can get them in great positions to score, so it's not just them backing down another 7 footer and trying to get a jump hook"
"I think Kevin Huerter is more deserving of a max than Collins, I get that it’s a hot take but Collins is a product of trae. Plus Collins’ basketball IQ on defense is actively destructive at times."

I was taking a nice nap on the couch during the Bucks vs. Hawks game when an gunshots rang out in my house. It turns out the sound was just John Collins and Kevin Huerter bricks clanging off the rim again. Keep it down you two!

"Gallo’s a fraud, Bogi’s a fraud, kevin huerter…red velvet gets a pass tbh"
Kevin Huerter is the spiritual successor to J.J. Redick
Remember that time Kevin Huerter lost all his money to those card sharks and his dad Tom Bosley had to get it back for him?
"Kevin Huerter is a starting SG of a team made up of people you see on the park court that you didn't think could ball, but could probably score ALL 21 points"
Fun Fact kevin huerter and John Collins lead hawks have never lost a game 5.
Pay Kevin Huerter game pt 2?
This is what Lou Williams is gonna say about “the lightskin guy” in reference to Kevin Huerter when they win the ECF
The East Finals really gonna be decided by Khris Middleton and Kevin Huerter.
"They should make a Kevin Huerter special edition IPA, or at least plaster his face on the cans of hopsecutioner"
"Dont tell your girl kevin is going to win fmvp, because when he doesn't, it's going to Huerter."
"Playoffs one is more impressive. If Kevin Huerter had a 50 point regular season game, his 27 pt game 7 in Philly would still be better."
"Sorry Hawks, Trae Young, Cam Reddish, Kevin Huerter, John Collins, other young players I can't remember; they've all peaked. The only way is down from here."
"I mean we believe you here. We got told every day that for two years Trae was empty stays because he couldn’t win starting Alex Len, Deandre Bembry, unpolished rookie Kevin Huerter, 42 year old Vince carter got SIGNIFICANT minutes, starting at the 4 quite a bit for us. I repeat, Vince Carter was our starting 4 and JC missed 25+ games both of Traes first two years in the league. We had 90+ MILLION DOLLARS in salary dedicated to Chandler parsons who played 9 minutes the entire season for us, Allen Crabbe who averaged 3 points on almost 20 minutes a game, and Evan fucking Turner. We had 3 of the worst 5 contracts in the entire league and this sub still laughed because Trae wasn’t winning averaging 30 and 10. That’s when I realized this sub does not look at context what so ever."
I was considering adding kevin huerter lol just for his playoff run
First it was a gentleman’s sweep vs the celtics and Kyrie (the Ben Simmons 1-point game..)  Then it was The bounce in Toronto....  Then it was an actual sweep against the Celtics without Ben....  And this time it was to Kevin Huerter and Ben Simmons acting as a double agent.  Rough last three years considering that 2018 was one of the most fun sports seasons I’ve watched when combined with the eagles superbowl win. Our future looked amazing at that point
Kevin Huerter\*
SO YOU GOT A 25% AT BEST AT BEAT ME. AND THEN YOU ADD KEVIN HUERTER TO THE MIX? YOU CHANCES OF WINNING DRASTIC GO DOWN
The hottest place in the world is 3' radius around Kevin Huerter.  Just ask any woman.
"Hawks don’t have the star power the other teams have but their depth may be the best in the league. What other team in the NBA has two quality players at each position?   PG: Trae Young, Lou Will  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic, Kevin Huerter  SF: De’Andre Hunter, Cameron Reddish  PF: John Collins, Danilo Gallinari   C: Clint Capela, Onyeka Okongwu   Additionally, they have long bodies they can throw like Tony Snell, Solomon Hill and Kris Dunn   They had the perfect mix of a decent young core, cap space, and picks last year to make this roster. So the Knicks for example should follow in the same way. They have two firsts plus two seconds and almost $70 million in cap space to add a top player + depth to match the hawks"
"Kevin ""so big that it's gonna"" Huerter"
"Kevin ""Don't"" Huerter"
Kevin “what she don’t know won’t” Huerter

Kevin Huerter
"Kevin ""omg that's so big it's gonna"" Huerter"
&gt;A lot of flukey things happened in the bubble.  Flukier than Reggie Jackson averaging 18 ppg on 63% TS; Kevin Huerter dropping 27 in a game 7 win against the 1 seed; 10 all stars missing games in 1 postseason (previous record was 6); Terance Mann dropping 39 to get to the WCF?  Bubble was amazing compared to this hospital year + breakout performances don't mean the whole bubble was a fluke lol
Just like Cam Payne and Kevin Huerter
"Yeah the “if” is too big to make it even worth discussing. Bucks are still a team with two allstars and only need to win 2 more games. Clips and Suns would both be favored heavily over no-Giannis bucks or the Hawks  There’s a reason people value postseason success as much as they do. It’s because winning the chip is a lot harder than winning 2 games in the ECF  We also have no idea how a hawks championship would look. Is trae magically healthy again? Does he carry the team fully? Does Kevin Huerter continue to grow and play a big part? Is the championship against a healthy Suns team or a team missing 1+ allstar starters?  I’m a Sixers fan, I know how playoff runs fall apart."
Nobody gives a shit about Kevin Huerter and Khris Middleton. They want to watch Trae and Giannis.
How would you feel if we took a Kevin huerter off your hands?
"Terrence Mann, Reggie Jackson, Batum. clippers guys stepped up big   Cameron Payne, PJ Tucker, Gallonari, Kevin Huerter"
Did you even watch that series? Kevin Huerter was absolutely toasting Seth on the end. You think if the 76ers make the finals Bucks would start trapping Seth because he had a hot series?
Sexton? The Nets will be lucky if they manage to get past Kevin Huerter.
"duncan robinson, eric bledsoe, nerlens noel, marcus morris, and kevin huerter"
"Agreed 100%, but he needs to be more consistent. Also a big thing with Huerter is his confidence. Collins if he can get a good off the dribble faceup game he will become an all star level player which Kevin doesn't have that kind of upside. In the end it's a moot point for us Hawks fans because this really is like a pseudo golden generation for us with the amount of talent around the same age."
"I joined this Fantasy Football league where you can play against Malcolm Brogdon, George Hill, Ty Jerome, Myles Turner, Garrett Temple, De'Andre Hunter, Justin Anderson, Joe Harris, Anthony Tolliver, Kevin Huerter, Diamond DeShields, and Victoria Vivians. There are still spots but you have to sign up by the 24th. There is a live virtual draft with all the players on the 26th.  https://www.brogdonfamilyfoundation.org/waterbowl"
12 mil or what josh hart got and hopefully we can extend Kevin huerter for around the same
"Bro, what kind of blasphemy is this? Kevin Huerter will be the greatest NBA player of all time. Easy."
Kevin Huerter
Kevin Huerter
Bucks/Nets was by far the best and most entertaining. The Sixers/Hawks were just entertaining because of the choke job we all saw uncle Ben play like he was 5’10 instead of 6’10. The fact that the Sixers couldn’t stop Kevin Huerter just let the world know how fraudulent they are.

"If Ben could make free throws, Kevin Huerter still would have destroyed seth curry, Harris still would have missed open layups, Embiid still would have had massive turnovers, Dwight howard still would have been unable to play without fouling someone"
"Then follows it by saying   &gt; However, at this point, it’s probably best to cut my losses, take the L  and   &gt; Whether Young can ascend into Tier 2 will depend on a number of smaller improvements. Can he continue to refine his shot selection? Will he find ways to be slightly less of a defensive liability than his 755th place ranking (of 755!) in three-year dRAPM suggests he has been? Can he become a more effective player off the ball to allow the talents around him, such as Kevin Huerter and John Collins, to shine a little more? Having learned my lesson, I’m no longer betting against him being able to do so.  He's clearly turned around on Trae."
Just another KP in the mix I mean. Maybe Otto Porter Jr.? Kevin Huerter? None of them are actually that close but between all the overlapping acronyms and suffixes imagine trying to call a game with that team.
Basketball player: Kevin Huerter   Hooper: K'von Huerter
"Saw that Pacers' Malcolm Brogdon's charity is hosting a fundraiser where you can play fantasy football against NBA and WNBA players. They'll have a live draft event on August 26th. Right now the players are Diamond DeShields, Victoria Vivians, George Hill, Ty Jerome, Myles Turner, Garrett Temple, De'Andre Hunter, Justin Anderson, Joe Harris, Anthony Tolliver, Kevin Huerter, Malcolm Brogdon. https://www.brogdonfamilyfoundation.org/waterbowl"
"Kevin huerter was also incredibly disrespectful to Seth.   Jokes aside, by the end of the series I was convinced anytime Seth shot a 3 it was going in"
Hawks the deepest imo  Trae Young  Lou Williams  Kevin Huerter  Bogdan Bogdonavich  Cam Reddish  DeAndre Hunter  Sharife Cooper  Danilo Gallinari  Jalen Johnson  John Collins  Onyeka Okongwu  Clint Capela
It's defintiely both in my opinion. r/nba disproportionately likes most white players. Case in point Caruso and Kevin Huerter
"On the otherhand, they would have taken away mins from Kevin Huerter and Gallinari. They were one of the main reasons the Hawks won the series."
**G:** Dejounte Murray  **G:** Malcolm Brogdon  **F:** Kyle Anderson  **F:** Jerami Grant  **C:** Jarrett Allen   **Bench:** Jalen Brunson / Alex Burks Kevin Huerter /  Christian Wood / Mitchell Robinson
I’m here for a Kevin Huerter All NBA first team selection
"Kinda interesting to think how those young Lakers teams would have developed together. 5 of those guys have all gotten large contracts.   D'Lo, Ball, BI, Randle, Kuzma, Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, Josh Hart is not the worst team build around and they could have landed PG or Kawhi in FA?   They probably pick somewhere around the late teens in the 2018, 2019, and 2020 drafts if they stick together? Could have added someone like Kevin Huerter, Thybulle, or Saddiq Bey. If they pick in that 12-14 range they could have gotten Michael Porter Jr, Tyler Herro, or Tyrese Hailburton in one of those drafts.   Surely not the championship contender they are with LeBron and you can't pay everyone but they could have fun to watch and root for I think."
u/dmorey you lost to Kevin Huerter my guy
"i guess by the same logic, Kevin Huerter is better than Ben Simmons cause the Hawks beat the 76ers right? cHeCk MaTe."
"The question was the most I’d give up. We just have different philosophies, I always choose the better player and Smart is undoubtedly that. And he’s actually had a higher 3pt attempt rate than Seth two years running. I’d just rather have the top ten defender for playoff basketball than the guy who gets roaster by Kevin Huerter. And I love Seth."
"I think Gallo and Capela both will probably be traded as expiring contracts before the 2022-23 season and could even get a decent return; not a star, but they could both contribute to good teams and present less risk on 1-year deals.  The other option would be some kind of consolidation trade where young talent like Cam, Kevin, Hunter, or Okongwu could be packaged together or with one of the expiring contracts I mentioned, but the return would have to be a real star player.   There are definitely some choices to be made, but Kevin Huerter is the only player scheduled to be paid at the end of this season, with Hunter and Cam to be paid the year after. Next off-season Travis Schlenk is going to make some big moves, but hey, #TITS!"
* John Collins -23 * Kevin Huerter-22 * De'Andre Hunter-23 * Cam Reddish-21 * Trae Young-22 * Onyeka Okongwu-20 * Jalen Johnson (R)-19 * Sharife Cooper (R)-20 * Skylar Mays (2-Way)-23  Hawks have 9
"If I was ATL I would try to avoid Tyler Herro syndrome and sell high on the young guys who performed in the playoffs.  S&amp;T John Collins, Kevin huerter, reddish and picks for KAT or Siakam"
"&gt;already having 1 player makes us better than most teams  Yeah I totally agree, I guess I kind of misinterpreted the point that OP was trying to make. Trae is the distinguishing factor, watching the Hawks' playoff run made that pretty clear. You can't consider your young core on par with theirs until you have a superstar at that level.  That being said, I think the rest of the young talent on the Hornets is at least comparable to the Hawks. Miles Bridges/PJ Washington are similar tier prospects to DeAndre Hunter/Cam Reddish, John Collins is a tier above right now but tbh I have faith that Miles can reach that level of production next season. Possible we lose one of them this summer but Devonte Graham/Malik Monk is a similar level to Kevin Huerter. We're kind of just banking on LaMelo having Trae Young-type progression through his 2nd/3rd season to try and be as competitive as they were but obviously there's no guarantee in that happening."
"How is this comment being downvoted so much when it’s 100% correct??? [Kyle Kuzma’s trash ass was in Puma commercial last year](https://youtu.be/vz0y8EzBm9g).  Kevin Huerter is infinitely better than Kuz’s trash ass, but you don’t see him in any commercials. Kuz would get an offer for a regional Shoe Carnival commercial if he was playing in Detroit.   You can elevate yourself to star status in a small market, but a big market elevates you."
Any shooting guard would be a huge addition to the team.  Kevin Huerter would be a massive addition.   But once you sell your assets for an overpaid Buddy Hield you are also locked into a dog shit defender and no means to improve the roster further. These are marginal moves.
"Get Luka out of your mouth, I obsessively want Kevin Huerter and Deandre hunter to be great players and they weren’t part of the Luka trade, and I would prefer the hawks to not trade either of them for a first round pick like reddish."
"Who tf you talking about man? Lol, crowder? Harrell? Kevin Huerter?"
Warriors need a Kevin Huerter type player. A big guard who can shoot and space the floor.
congrats on knit picking things to prove your point but in reality....kevin huerter who averages 11 pts a game scored 27 thats called catching fire. but hey good luck watching wizards suck for another 10 years with kuzma
"Better than John Collins, Trae, Deandre Hunter, Kevin Huerter, and the potential of Reddish, Okongwu, Jalen Johnson and Cooper?"
Porzingis - magician Ben Simmons - ventriloquist  Jaylen Brown - professor of philosophy Trae Young - actor in commercials for nasal relief products Kevin Huerter - Brooks Brothers greeter Steven Adams - Mamoa stunt double
"I get why he's asking for 20m up, it's a weak free agency year and he's young and determined to get better.  It's also tricky because when you watch Bogdan Bogdanovic (18m) or even Kevin Huerter, guys like that can also come up to the mid-range and have more to their bag offensively than Zo does. And they give more gravity to their teams too.   Zo is a very confusing dude. He's like Danny Green with some playmaking but I know he wants to make another jump and he's 23, so young enough to do it probably. 🤔"
Ben Simmons for cam reddish and Kevin huerter
Idk I think we're gonna keep Huerter. Originally I was against it for the same reasons you are. I thought he was redundant behind Bogi and that were gonna trade one of them. After last season though it seems Kevin has carved out a completely different role. Someone with a versatile skillset like his is extremely valuable.
Kevin Huerter
"Tell me you can’t read without telling me you can’t read. Lemme quote the article for you bud. It’s the very first sentence, can’t miss it.  “Reddish is probably fourth in wing rotation right now, behind De’Andre Hunter, Bogdan Bogdanovic, and Kevin Huerter.”  So what’s his trade value when he’s the FOURTH wing in the rotation and the Hawks are actively shopping him to afford other players?"
"you ""listen"" to offers on literally anyone besides trae lol  Schlenk has loved Cam for years. I just do not think you trade the young player 2 years away from being paid (and not like he's earned a big extension) to 'reset' the young guys cap when Kevin Huerter is being paid within the next year"
Kevin huerter did well in the playoffs and alex len is on the wizards. A bunch if other young players not getting much playing time but hopefully they do well
Kevin Huerter off the bench.
"Idk but Kevin Huerter or John Collins aren't certified superstars or foundational pieces. They're very good young role players that may be more than that but probably not. All I know is they shouldn't be kept ""at all cost."""
"Kevin Huerter, Trae, John Collins and De'Andre Hunter are the players they need to keep at all costs. Reddish is disposal and has been kinda a bust in his tenure with The Hawks."
With CJ the 76ers still lose. Instead of Ben being mentally shattered it will be cause Philly let Kevin Huerter go off for 35
"Jarret Allen, Bradley Beal, Middleton, Durant, LaVine, Seth Curry, Kevin Huerter, DeJounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, DeAndre Ayton, Trae Young.   I would be running a ton."
 Go for a Kevin Huerter funko pop
"After the Rich the kid, Outkast incident its definitely Kevin huerter that they are getting rid of"
"It’s likely Collins is retained and I’d be surprised if Reddish is dealt…if Hunter is healthy (which is a big if) Huerter is firmly in a bench role.   Now if Hunter isn’t healthy long term, this wouldn’t be a bad draft to take a swing at 3/D guy like Trey Murphy (would likely have to move into the back end of the lottery for him) or take the pure upside pick in Jalen Johnson. We shouldn’t be trying to log Kevin at the 3 when he’s at his best using his size against smaller guards. Seth Curry will tell you that."
Now you made me feel bad 😭😭😭  I understand where you’re coming from and while Donte is no Kevin Huerter he is a really good player and a big piece missing for y’all even if you did get the chip in the end so I feel you
Him and daniel gafford are great. Not many maryland guys besides kevin huerter
I'm surprised nobody has said Kevin Huerter.
*Kevin Huerter has left the chat*
PG: Luka Doncic  SG: Half of Steph Curry  SF: Kevin Huerter  PF: Domantis Sabonis  C: Nikola Jokic
Brandon Ingram---&gt; Kevin Durant  Andre Roberson--&gt; Ben Simmons  Kevin Huerter---&gt;Larry Bird  Jamal Murray---&gt; Michael Jordan  Greg Oden--&gt; Deandre Ayton (actually Oden may be Ayton from the future)
Kevin Huerter is truly Klay Thompson
I mean Trae didn’t do it alone tho. He had a lot of help. Game 7 vs the sixers he played bad but his team still won due to heroics by Kevin Huerter. No one Lukas team was capable of going off like that. Comparing players by team success sometimes can lead to inaccurate conclusions.
"Eh I don't think anyone is arguing that Kevin Huerter is going to be the 2nd or 3rd star of our franchise. I think most of us believe he's going to be a rock solid starter or ELITE bench guy who can defend, pass, dribble and shoot effectively in a competitive playoff series.  Absolutely nobody in the Hawks FO/fanbase would hesitate to trade him for Harden or any other superstar if that was an option."
"It’s not a knock on Bogi, that’s a nod of confidence to Kevin Heurter. I think he’s better, and I think there’s a move with New Orleans with a S&amp;T for Lonzo and Collins swap. If you had Trae, Huerter, Lonzo, Cam and Capela it really is the original warriors with Bogut. Plus you get a cost controlled version of Collins rather than a 20 million version.  Also I have to make this clear I see Lonzo as a young Danny Green more than a true PG."
&gt;Tobias harris was like 8/24 game 7 and 2/11 in game 5 at home  19 ppg for the series right on line with his season averages. Nobody’s saying a player can’t have a bad game.   &gt;Joel embiid went scoreless in a second half in game 4 at the worst time.  Joel Embiid averaged 30 ppg over 7 games.   &gt;Seth curry was giving up every point he scored to Kevin Huerter.  Curry - 21 ppg on **78.8 TS%**  Huerter - 13.1 ppg on 57.9 TS%  Just factually wrong. Curry’s offensive production heavily outweighed his defensive shortcomings.
"Tobias harris was like 8/24 game 7 and 2/11 in game 5 at home  Joel embiid went scoreless in a second half in game 4 at the worst time.  Seth curry was giving up every point he scored to Kevin Huerter.  Losing a series is a team effort. And yeah Ben was awful, and Embiid was a monster playing through a real injury, but Ben was crucified"
Shit then I guess we gotta consider Kevin Huerter as well
To think twolves beating the nuggets in the regular season led to Kevin huerter led to Ben Simmons' jersey being burnt
This game also got the Hawks Kevin Huerter since Minnesotas pick was lotto protected. Shoutout Minnesota.
"Danilo Gallinari, Kevin Huerter, 2 firsts   Take it or leave it"
Ben Simmons got outplayed by Kevin Huerter and Danilo Gallinari in game 7 and he’s acting like he’s James Harden.
Kevin Huerter dun broke Simmons relationship with Sixers
"Kevin ""fuck the process"" huerter"
Bruh kevin huerter really ended the process
"I ran into Bruce Bowen at a hotel, I saw Kevin Huerter random small bar in upstate NY and I also saw shai shooting hoops on my college campus cause he dated a girl who went to my school. Shai was easily the nicest of the 3"
Kevin Huerter
"Mathisse Thybulle, Myles Turner, Kevin Huerter, Desmond Bane in the Iguodala spot."
"&gt;  Suggs had a lot of limitation skill wise going into the draft, like can’t finishing left, suspect handling and footwork, shot poorly at the rim. Most draft Twitter projects him to be a Kevin Huerter type second option if he develops right.      Not sure where you're reading that but I don't think that's particularly accurate. Just because Suggs is not a pure PG doesn't mean he is a Huerter type.       &gt; And Scottie was projected to also be a secondary option in a Draymond/Pascal kind of way.       Barnes doesn't come close to the scoring ability that Siakam has. It would be extremely unexpected for him to get to that level.      I think he could be like Draymond offensively, but I really think with Draymond its important to remember that he has been in the best possible situation for his skillset playing with the 2 best shooters/off ball players of all time. I think if Draymond had ended up on another team he might have been putting up like 10/3.5"
"Fraction is pushing it. Suggs had a lot of limitation skill wise going into the draft, like can’t finishing left, suspect handling and footwork, shot poorly at the rim. Most draft Twitter projects him to be a Kevin Huerter type second option if he develops right. And Scottie was projected to also be a secondary option in a Draymond/Pascal kind of way.   If we are drafting guys who are likely second options here, might as well take a guy with huge defensive upside."
"The bucks were a small part of it! The fact that every team that has won the chip in the past 30 years has played in the playoffs the previous season and had playoff tested vets on their teams (minus the first golden state championship team).  The hawks had neither and were very lucky to play an emotionally fragile sixers team.  The team was too young and  inexperienced, did you read my post? were did I write that the bucks were unstoppable? They just weren’t losing to a tre young, Kevin huerter led team  of 24 year olds"
He will be the black kevin huerter
"&gt;Hawks have done pretty decent with late first round picks. We got John Collins, Kevin Huerter, and Jalen Johnson looks like he might be pretty good. If Detroit is rebuilding I think it would be wise to acquire as much firsts as possible and even if they don't want to draft late they can use multiple picks to move up in the draft. That's how we got De'andre Hunter. Jerami grant is good but Cade is so young. By the time he's ready to win I don't know how important grant will be to the team."
Kevin Huerter really did break the Sixers. You absolutely hate to see it.
"kevin huerter gave seth curry 27pts in game 7, despite seth trying his darndest.  lol.  kevin huerter!"
"I mean I don't know what they could've done to ""protect"" his value. Yeah sure maybe having a stretch 5 option to allow him to play with space when Embiid is off the floor could've helped him.  Sure Embiid maybe shouldn't have said what he said post game 7.  Sure Doc was an absolute coward after the same game 7 throwing Simmons under the bus despite being as much, if not more, of a problem in that series.  &amp;#x200B;  But the sad truth is that Simmons was bad, in a series in which he was most of the time guarded by an injured Bogdan Bogdanovic, Solo Hill and Kevin Huerter. I'm not sure how they could've really protect his value,he's not a top 30 player in the playoffs that's it"
Or maybe Danny green getting hurt showed how bad of a defender curry is when Kevin freakin Huerter dropped 30 on him in game 7?
"PG: Trae Young  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic  SF: De’Andre Hunter  PF: John Collins  C: Clint Capela   Reserves: Delon Wright, Kevin Huerter, Cam Reddish, Danilo Gallinari, Onyeka Okongwu."
We got Kevin Huerter out of it   Thanks for your service.
"2018 is much deeper. Luka, Ayton, Trae, JJJ, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Shai, Miles Bridges, MPJ, Donte DiVincenzo, Kevin Huerter, Anfernee Simons, Robert Williams, Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent, and Shake Milton. All of them are at the minimum rotation level guys. There’s a lot of starting caliber players in there too and the top of the draft has some true stars."
Yes but not two on the court at the same time especially in the playoffs. You don't want some role player turning into Kevin Huerter when they're on defense.
I mean I get that and I do really like Kevin. If huerter is the second best defender that’s not great. Dort would be the best defender on the hawks  It’s about team fit
Kevin Huerter
"$23m is fairly high for a role player/trade piece — especially when they already had him locked at $18 till 22/23  By 24/25, the cap will be tight when they are paying Trae &amp; Collins a combined $60m and at least one of the rookie contracts: OO, Cam Reddish, DeAndre Hunter, Kevin Huerter. What if Capella becomes injury prone again?"
"It wasn't any worse than Embiid getting stripped by noted lockdown defender  Gallinari of all people for his 8th turnover of the game  leading to a wide open dunk for the hawks with just under a minute left.  Simmons was the 76ers worst starter that series, no question about it. But people here acting like no other 76er played a role in their loss is insane to me lol. Doc got out coached, Embiid struggled massively in the 2nd halves of games 4 and 5, and Harris was incredibly inconsistent. The only constant was Curry shooting the absolute lights out all series and even then the Hawks were able to counter by hunting him with Kevin Huerter."
Kevin Huerter?
“You got outscored by Kevin fuckin Huerter. Who da FUCK is Kevin Huerter??!!”
In between Kevin Durant and Kevin Huerter
"Think it's a combination of both tbh. Like if you saw Khris Middleton's turnovers, oftentimes they're just him getting stripped by the likes of Cam Reddish or Kevin Huerter, so you can credit that to the defense a majority of the time.  In the case of Embiid, not only does he have a loose handle, dude doesn't know where to throw the ball, and in some horrible instances, he threw it straight to the defense (see some of those transition passes). So while K'Von and Gallinari were very smart in how they doubled Embiid (and incredibly effective), there's also the factor Embiid passes like he's drummond"
Kevin Huerter.
"After game 6, I was willing to trade him straight up for Kevin Huerter."
Danny Green -&gt; Kevin Huerter -&gt; Klay Thompson
Kevin “Red Velvet” Huerter lol. Go UMD
"Kevin ""what she don't know won't"" Huerter"
"Lemon Peppa Lou (Williams), Red Velvet (Kevin Huerter), Ice Trae, John The Baptist (Collins)   Can you guess i’m a Hawks fan? Lol"
My friend called Kevin Huerter Kevin Hooter until I finally corrected him on it. I found it hilarious
"Here is my quick attempt off the top of my head,  *Sabonis does not count even though he is American born. He represents Lithuania internationally and clearly has embraced that culture, his dad was just playing in the States when he was born.  1st Team  Tyler Herro- Joe Harris- Duncan Robinson- Gordon Hayward- Brook Lopez  2nd Team  Alex Caruso- Kevin Huerter- Pat Connaughton- Kevin Love- Cody Zeller  3rd Team  TJ McConnell- JJ Redick- Doug McDermott- Zach Collins- Mason Plumlee or Frank Kaminsky  The issue is that there are much better guards than forwards and especially centers. I feel like Donte is probably better than JJ at this point, but I gave Redick the legacy choice."
Kevin Huerter probably has the most upside.
Harrison Barnes. DeMar DeRozan. Bobby Portis. PJ Tucker. Eric Gordon. Rondo. Honestly Klay Thompson. Draymond. Morant. Kevin Huerter. Cameron Payne.
"Tatum isn’t better than Trae and DeAndre Hunter is on pace to be as good as Brown pretty soon. Not to mention that the Hawks also have John Collins, Kevin Huerter, Okongwu, and Reddish"
Why doesn’t anyone talk about Thybulle missing a FT &amp; fouling Kevin Huerter on a 3?  I know he’s a role player but he made mistakes just as bad if not worse.
This somewaht relates but man I swear they call phantom foulss on Kevin Huerter more than I’ve seen on anyone
"I can’t explain why because it’s not like they play particularly similarly or anything, but Kevin Huerter reminds me of Cam Johnson"
"Kevin ""What She Don't Know Won't"" Huerter"
Doc rivers not only couldn’t adjust to Kevin huerter tearing up their team while Simmons locked up young escapes responsibility once again and after showing he can’t properly change the game plan plays favorites and still has a job. Beyond me honestly
All this because of Trae Young and Kevin Huerter
Notice 6ers fans here. It’s funny you called him trash all last year tried to trade him away threw him under the bus and now it’s “you’re under contract come back” tell your coach to not use the same goddamn scheme for 7 games and adjust to Kevin huerter and you might have won something lol. Tell your team who been knew embiid and Simmons didn’t work together since what 2016? That it wasn’t going to work out. Now you want him to honor his contract and be happy in that hell hole when you all dumped him. I’m happy he’s standing for himself yall act like dude is trash and he had trae young missing what 70% of his shots game 7? He did his part defensively once again tell your coach to stop blaming people and being a man child same reason Allen left and won another ring and they were bitter asf till this day
Wait did Kevin Huerter arrive wearing an outkast jersey? [pictured here ](https://twitter.com/ATLHawks/status/1451319676005281800?s=20)
"Kevin Huerter and I are friends and he’s on my fantasy team, so this is actually all okay."
"Don't you mean Kevin ""What She Don't Know Wont"" Huerter?"
"Well if it was Luka, Jokic, Caruso, Kevin Huerter, Poku, Joe Harris, Kevin Love then the questions would be all serious and nobody would be trolling. But When AD came on here there was nothing but trolls ... hmm I wonder why that is"
"You clearly don't watch basketball and only get your takes from the top comments of social media. I mean look at you, you use emojis so immature.  Caruso is not a bench warmer, he's a great role player. Y'all love to meme about him because he looks like the modern day Brian Scalabrine but that could be any farther from the truth, Lakers unironically took the L when they let Caruso go for Westbrook.  Kevin Huerter was a cold MF in Game 7. Elimination game and I did not expect him to step up. Trae wasn't the only dude doing damage, in fact if you look at Trae's shooting splits in game 7, he was kinda sus but hey keep ignoring how good the Hawks and their pieces around Trae are.  As for our Jokic at home...this dude was in Sac jail and Minny jail most of his NBA career. Was only used as a stretch big to space the floor but apparently, only the Warriors utilized him as something more. Dude can actually drive, pass and shoot given he's in a good system."
Lol why are you bring race in to  this ... so weird . Yeah Caruso is so great he is a benchwarmer 😂. Also Kevin Huerter was cold ? Lol he only scored 20 twice. The only cold motherF was Trae Young. Kevin would never be able to lead a team lol. Yeah the 33 year old vet is your Jokic 😂. Dude has never averaged higher than 11 points a game but yet he is some all star now cause of one game lol
"idk I think all 3 white dudes are underrated in their own way. Alex Caruso is a great guard defender, Kevin Huerter was a cold MF during the playoffs and Be-Elite-Za is our personal Jokic at home."
"I guess the question is if he’s in the Kevin Huerter, Mikal Bridges tier of player then?  Writing that sentence though, those are all such horrible comparisons position/style/role/everything-wise."

Kevin Huerter is AllElite
"It's not even a matter of takes and knowledge on the theme at all, just straight up basketball and evident facts and events.  One doesn't have to wonder on what is more playing basketball, more legit competition etc but especially straight up available game and whole between a certain number of guys competing in an even play field between Curry and CP3 cooking, Lebron and KD going crazy in 2017, Kawhi, Lowry, FVV, Gasol battling the Sixers and Bucks, Lebron's career high 51 and 8 8 vs the Warriors' all-time defense, Dame's run, all-time Harden Rockets going insane, 2018 Lebron vomiting number one all-time basketball for two months on one side.  And on the other side the Kevin Huerter-led crippled Hawks getting burnt down by 2021 Brook Lopez while the first option of your favourite NBA runner up is out nursing an injury (this is your NBA Eastern Conference Finals material), the Suns vs the Clippers with Kawhi Leonard having been murdered off camera or something, Harden freakishly getting injured to his leg stepping down on the court seconds into the series and the Suns and Lakers literally upping each other on the series based on who was injured or got suddenly back in again, instead of their back and forth on the court with their abilities, and looking like 5 versions of themselves in one 6 game series.  &amp;#x200B;  The highlight of the post season was Ben Simmons passing the layup, the various guys comically forgetting how to play basketball and a guy dropping 50 strolling back from an injury on up and coming young role players collapsing unto themselves when finding themselves shot up straight to the Finals while 36 years old CP3 was on an island getting chased and mauled by the opposing defense.  Which is funny considering the narrative of those locked and loaded 2018 best-version-of-themselves-Celtics (to this day even) with young stars and veteran basketball elites, and that team actually proving, winning and playing like a best team in the league with Tatum and Brown tearing it up especially, being just ''illegitimate, all rookies, 7 Games of nothing, like the Warriors vs the Lebron Cavs''."
"Awards:      MVP: Steph Curry      Finalists:      Giannis Antetokounmpo      Nikola Jokic        I predict the top 3 seeds in the West will be the Jazz, Suns and the Warriors. Out of those 3, Steph is by far the best player and MVP candidate. If I'm being honest, Giannis and Steph are tied, and I have Steph above from bias. Both have fantastic narratives but that favours Steph, both can have fantastic seeds but that favours Giannis, both will have elite MVP stats, both will have voter fatigue but Giannis moreso, and I think Steph will go harder in the regular season. Jokic 3rd because like why not, he has a bit of everything, Trae probably 4th.        DPOY: Giannis Antetokounmpo      Finalists:      Draymond Green      Rudy Gobert      Rudy won't win it again. Simple as that. Not for atleast a few seasons. Draymond 2nd because of the seeding leap the Warriors can take. I think Giannis's focus will be more on offball offense and defense this year as the Bucks have focused on getting offensive upgrades this offseason.        ROTY: Cade Cunningham      Finalists:      Jalen Green      Scottie Barnes         Cade will have the best impact metrics because of how he will get the keys to Detroit and that's it. Detroit is Cades team already and that'll decide it. Barnes playmaking and defense already looks nice and Green is just too flashy and his scoring is super impressive at his age, they'll be top 3.  &amp;#x200B;     6th Man: Tyler Herro      Finalists:      Kevin Huerter      Dennis Schroeder  &amp;#x200B;  After his sophomore slump, I can see Herro taking a leap. His team will take a leap and he'll pair fantastically with Lowry. There isn't really any strong 6th man favourites to me, so I just threw in Huerter and Schroeder who's teams will be better this year.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Most Improved: Jordan Poole      Finalists:      Bam Adebayo      OG Anunoby       Jordan Poole has taken quite a leap once again, and his increased role will lead to a big stats leap. He's flashy and more importantly, the media is already acknowledging him. That's a key factor. Jokic became the MVP favourite because everyone just acknowledged it halfway through the season, I think it'll be a similar thing with Poole. Bam had a nice looking midrange last season that was gone during the playoffs, but with the addition of Lowry, I can see him not only taking an individual leap, but taking a statistical leap twice over due to Lowry. OG looks like his offensive arsenal has expanded massively, and while I don't know too much about him, I know he's one of the top MIP candidates/  &amp;#x200B;  COTY: Steve Kerr      Finalists:      Monty Williams      Mike Malone  Draymond, Steph and Poole are all high on these awards and Warriors will take a massive leap, easy.  &amp;#x200B;  EOTY: Marc Eversley      Finalists:      Bob Myers      Andy Elisburg  Just guys who made unexpected leaps in the seeding as GMs"
"Yeah, he’s a bitch. He got in his head during the playoffs and fucking sucked. Like didn’t even take shots sucked. Culminated in passing up a dunk because of “I’m scared of Trae Young and Kevin Huerter (lol)” He started crying after the Sixers went home, then went MIA. Wouldn’t talk to the team, owner, coaches, etc. All the trade rumors started, but nothing came of it. Now he’s back in Philly with his tail between his legs with the entire team hating him.   It’s fucking hilarious."
chad Kevin Huerter vs the virgin Deandre Ayton
All-Fuck-Simmons 1st Team  Trae Young | Kevin Huerter | Kawhi Leonard | Jayson Tatum | Joel Embiid
"Ben is such a brat. Pouting as if he’s not the reason for the demise of the Sixers. This dude is a multiple all star/ all defensive player and got outplayed by Lou Williams, Kevin Huerter, and John Collins down the stretch. They ask him to work on his game and he gets offended and quits on his team smh. The entitlement is insane man."
Kevin Huerter 6MOTY
"The meat grinder has been laid down by a series of invisible gnomes shooting (that's the only way you can explain all those freak injuries) NBA superstars, second options, third options and starters of both conferences, almost every time a new Playoffs day arose.  Yeah, an injury he managed to eat up and play like it was nothing (man, it truly is nice to be Giannis, Harden's words has been proved even more truer by this title, and poor the players with the style of Kyrie), but you forgot how it happened comfortably against the Kevin Huerter Hawks (your 2021 ECF finalist, and people dare talking about the Raptors and 2015 Warriors), the continuous asterisks and lack of adversity are literally comical.  Imagine any first option of the game in Playoffs history or, I don't know, Lebron getting injured against the PG Pacers or the Celtics after already having Bosh down (Giannis already had not a single starter or co-star down) lol no more coasting to the title, no Khris, Jrue and Brook Lopez putting down your opponent. If it happened vs the Nets and the Bucks won things would already have looked a little different.  It's not just me who is calling Harden an iron man, Harden was blatantly an iron man to the NBA world with his track record and it was one of the main thing he was known for, before 2021 and his completely random freak injury seconds into the series."
Yep lol the Magic would win vs the Kevin Huerter Hawks (your 2021 ECF finalist).
"The 2021 ECF finalist that faced the Bucks was literally a peer of the Cavs.  The Kevin Huerter Hawks, after getting suddenly shot by freak injuries in their run."

Does Kevin Huerter start or does he come off the bench? Expensive shooters
"This is very interesting and I think could be accurate especially for Kevin Huerter, as he is very oversized for the 2guard spot. Itd be incredible if he turned into Kris Middleton-like. Hes gotten even better defense as hes gotten older + scores a lot of buckets on smaller guards in between 3&amp;paint"
"The Hawks now have Trae Young locked up through 2027, John Collins and Kevin Huerter through 2026, and Clint Capela through 2025"

"and he just got more money than JC lol  people have become so fixated on shooting they ignore like.. everything else lol. Ignore that JJJ could get out rebounded by kevin huerter. Ignore that Jaren's defense is still at the ""but it could be so good!"" stage lol  JJJ will probably be quite good but its year 4 now man. If he's gonna be more than just ""pretty good, is tall and can shoot"" guy then he's gotta show it"

Herro is a poor man’s Kevin Huerter.
"A bunch. Played against KAT a few times back in the day, him and his family were great. He played alongside Wade Baldwin, who actually got ejected when we played him and we thought was pretty overrated but we ended up reconnecting a few years later and laughed about the whole thing.  Worked at a hotel that hosted the NBA Rookie Symposium in 2016. Served Ben Simmons, he very much kept to himself and didn’t socialize like everyone else. Buddy Hield gave me a free speaker, shirt, bags, etc. because “man we got money we don’t need this” was super appreciative. Jamal Murray was my guy too, super nice. Did not like Taurean Prince because he was offended I didn’t know who he was and was kind of a dick (to be fair, I knew most of them, but like dude you’re Taurean Prince).  Went to college with Kevin Huerter, wasn’t super close but he used to hookup with my friend and we talked a few times, he’s pretty quiet and reserved but a good guy. Bruno Fernando was hilarious, we loved him."

If we can just extend Kevin Huerter this core will be together for two more seasons before we start saying good bye to players.   It'll be interesting to see who we keep and who leaves
Kevin Huerter turned into a kid in the front row as he watched this lmao
Kevin Huerter!
He was left off the top 25 under 25 in favor of Kevin Huerter.
"I'm not normally one to get on guys for ""mental toughness"" but Ben really has exposed himself as the softest player in the league. Going into year 6 with absolutely no jumper and he's complaining about how the Sixers rushed him and stunted his development? Shits fucking hilarious lol  Shout out to Kevin Huerter for ethering this man's reputation forever"
"&gt;Kevin Huerter - Game 7 against Philadelphia  that was crazy to watch - he feasted on that matchup, was it curry covering him mostly?   edit: just watched this and huerter cooked the whole damn team!!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K012BPoub5w  First 3 on korkmanz (korks reactions are hilarious), embiid, 2 on tobi, curry, shake, 2 more on curry, and matisse with the bad 3 pt foul."
Terance Mann - Game 6 against Utah  Kevin Huerter - Game 7 against Philadelphia
And ppl here made it to be like Seth was a net negative just because he was a mediocre defender against kevin huerter. So what? The dude was their second star when his role wasn't even supposed to be that big. He was supposed to be a JJ type shooter and yet he exceeded our expectations of him that series.   He wasn't supposed to be a good defender. If he was he would've been a bonafide star.
"Starters: PG: Kemba Walker SG: Donovan Mitchell SF: Tobias Harris PF: Jonathan Isaac C: Thomas Bryant  2nd Unit: PG: James Bouknight (Ik he’s technically a SG but I couldn’t find any other PG’s besides Kemba currently in the NBA) SG: Kevin Huerter SF: Danny Green PF: Carmelo Anthony C: Isaiah Stewart  Not an awful team you ask me. Probably gets a spot as a top 6 seed in the playoffs imo. Now, if you include the NYC metropolitan area than you could throw in Bam Adebayo, Karl Anthony Towns, Kyrie Irving and Jaren Jackson Jr. (all from north Jersey) and now this team is by far the best team in the NBA, but I decided not to do it since technically speaking they aren’t from NY and since it’d be pretty much impossible to afford all those players too being that would be 5 max contracts and a bunch of players making over the vet minimum, but god damn is the NYC metropolitan area stacked with talent now that I look into it."
"Some of you guys say the most baseless shit lol. How many white players are talked about here that aren't for memes? Luka and Jokic?  Caruso is a meme, Grayson Allen is definitely disliked if he's mentioned, Kristaps isn't too popular from what I've seen. Luka is like the only non-meme white player that is more liked than disliked from what I've seen, if they're even talked about at all. I'm on here a lot too.  No one is making Kevin Huerter posts, or mentioning Joe Harris for anything other than shooting. Vucevic is barely even mentioned and he's a top 5 offensive center."
that reporter? kevin huerter
"Brown since Tatum's already bordering superstardom  Malik Monk  Tyrese Maxey  Brandon Clarke  Kevin Huerter  Miles Bridges  Bol Bol  Killian Hayes since he had an awful first year, and there's nowhere to go but up  Kevin Porter Jr., he turned a corner since arriving in Houston and is still super young compared to Wood  Tyler Herro since Duncan Robinson already looks polished and at his peak  RJ Barrett since Randle is already an All-NBA player  Terrance Mann since Winslow's injuries have hampered him too much  Nickeil Alexander-Walker  Patrick Williams  Anthony Edwards, a 20 year-old who came off of near ROY can really only get better."

What if Kevin Huerter didn't go full dad mode in game 7 and the Sixers lost in the ECF instead?
He’s a regular commentator now for the Hawks and he does great- especially since he intimately knows a lot of the current Hawks players. He’s always talking about how he’s gonna text Kevin Huerter at halftime with suggestions lol
"LaMelo doesn’t even get an honorable mention but Kevin Huerter does? No disrespect to red velvet, but I think this writer is a goofball."
Sharife Cooper on the hawks is nice. Also Kevin huerter
Kevin Huerter really ended the process
This was a terrible loss and sucky way to end a winning streak.  Also Kevin Huerter is stealing money.  He needs to get his $h!t together quickly!!!
"I watched the entire 7 game series and there were like 2-5 instances per game where he fell down from posting up LouWill or Kevin Huerter, while having 6 inches and 80 pounds on them.  Trae was baiting, but Embiid was even more obvious."
This guy is clearly nothing with the rule change. Trade him and build around Kevin Huerter
It’s worked out for us starting Kevin Huerter and Bogi
Kevin is a good choice I never thought of. Most guys who play until their late 30's usually stay in the league due to their height and shooting ability. Both of which Huerter has over most guys. I could even see him bulking up a little bit more and playing a small power forward in his late 30s as his lateral movement inevitably declines as he ages.
"Kevin Huerter is going to be a solid 4th or 5th starter for a looong time. 6'7"" wing who can shoot, pass, create his own shot, and defend at a solid level."
"It’s not that we didn’t draft MPJ, we should have, but the medical issue was a legit reason not too. It’s that we drafted Jerome Robinson over guys like Grayson Allen, Lonnie Walker, Donte DiVincezo, Kevin Huerter etc"
"i’m glad we almost dug ourselves out, but god damn it felt like the hawks had our number all game. any time we almost got some progress for the comeback it was just like a highly contested 3 splashed straight in someone’s face or all of a sudden we leave kevin huerter wide open. we made a good effort but they earned that win for sure  edit: that call where trae clearly jumped into (I think) jalen mcdaniels had me sooooo salty. I thought we stopped calling those!"
I feel like Kevin huerter lost the right to have all those cool nicknames when he said rich the kid is better than Outkast last year
Kevin “steal your leg” Huerter
Kevin Huerter won a game 7 for the hawks against a one seed. What has Herro done?
"add in kevin love, tj mcconnell, olynyk, kispert, duncan robinson, herro, kevin huerter, and john isaac. Real classy individuals"
"Going back to the 50 point game vs the Hawks, I think Kevin Huerter had one of the more humbling nights for a player I've seen trying to guard Steph. He simply could *not* guard Steph. At one point Steph had 38 points on him and Huerter had 4 fouls, never had the foot spead to keep up with him, but for some reason Nate McMillan left him in and didn't put a different guard on him."

"You know what I mean when I say they aren't comparable players, you're just being dense on purpose. Kevin Huerter had better numbers than Ben Simmons during that series, I guess Huerter&gt;Simmons."
"Love Trae but I've noticed some reversals to his play, he plays less previous season style but more seasons before that one style. It's not all on him but also on Nate too.  Strongly believe Hawks need to clear roster asap as it feels there are too many hungry mouths to feed. Cam is black hole, Bogi is underutilized, Hunter was overused offensively to start the season, Huerter idk. Trae needs to play 10-20% less with the ball and leave it to Bogi or Huerter during that short span.  Hunter needs to stay and be defensive menace, to play similar role AG is playing for Nuggets and with limited touches. That leaves Cam, Bogi, Kevin. One if them should be traded so your team could progress. I'm leaning towards Cam."

"Huerter is the best Kevin in the league, don't @ me Durant stans."
Steph Curry gave Kevin Huerter depression.
You thought Steph Curry was hard fouling Kevin Huerter all game?
kevin huerter got torched so bad by steph they're punishing him by making him play with the third string
You mean Kevin Huerter. Curry really Huert him
So I don't watch Hawks basketball but they sign Kevin Huerter to a $16 million/year contract and he puts up 6 points a game on 36% shooting? Is something up with him
Yes and Kevin Huerter destroyed him in the Hawks series?
He’s targetted (see: Kevin Huerter game 7) BUT he’s one of the best shooters - not just catch and shoot but off the dribble. He is worth the defensive liability
Nah. Curry lost the game for his terrible defense on Kevin Huerter. I'll post again later. Sixers aren't any good so they have to play Curry.
"Kevin ""what she don't know won't"" Huerter"
"Its only been 8 games, and even then 3 years ago we had 2018. You know, the draft with two top 15 players already, the 3rd best player in a finals team and thats still leaving out Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Michael Porter Jr, Colin Sexton, Miles Bridges, Mikal Bridges, Gary Trent Jr., Donte Divincenzo, Devonte Graham, Jaren Jackson Jr, Jalen Brunson, Grayson Allen, Kevin Huerter, Hamidou Diallo, Lonnie Walker IV, Landry Shamet, and Mitchell Robinson. Also Kendrick Nunn and Duncan Robinson as undrafted players."
Huerter is the best Kevin today

"I saw Kevin Huerter abuse Seth during the playoffs and he wasn't even their second best player.   I would love to be proven wrong on this because I like both of them so I guess we'll see. On a side note, whenever defense is brought up for the Blazers, my mind always defaults to the ""Ain't gonna be no more layups"" clip lol. They did my boy CJ dirty.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVcEyHnUZcI"
Technically the Wolves pick was traded ahead of time and Kevin Huerter was drafted
It lost Minny the first rounder that turned into Kevin Huerter.  Very glad you lost that game.
"Still has to be better than Kevin Huerter for fantasy value.    ...  I have Kevin Hurter.  Tried to replace him for days with waiver pickups, blocked at every move."
"2017 - John Collins  2018 - Trae Young, Kevin Huerter  2019 - Deandre Hunter, Cam Reddish  2020 - Onyeka Okongwu  2021 - Jalen Johnson, Sharife Cooper  &amp;#x200B;  Obviously I'm biased but I'd say the Hawks have drafted better. Every single one of the guys on this list has starter level upside (if they haven't realized it yet) and are going to cause a money squeeze on the Hawks because of how good they all are. The Grizz probably have picked guys better equipped to be rotation and role guys but the Hawks seem to have a lot of guys who would be on a lot of team's starting lineups"
“Who the fuck is Kevin Huerter”   https://youtu.be/0Oai9QlEAZQ

"Came here to give Kevin ""what she don't know won't"" Huerter some love as a member of the 2018 draft class"
"I think there will be multiple MVP winners, a DPOY winner in Ayton, a couple of sixth man of the year winners in Brunson and Kevin Huerter, and like 10 total separate all stars. Insane, insane draft class. A pick in this draft was worth double or triple a pick in this last draft"
"2017 Draft, Knicks get Frank Ntilikina at #8, Hawks get John Collins at #19.   2018 Draft, Knicks get Kevin Knox at #9, Hawks get Kevin Huerter at #19.    :/"

Kevin Huerter is an excellent Defender.
Kevin Huerter just further proving that gingers have no soul and ice in their veins
Kevin Huerter is the only one
"Randle only did that because Gallo elbowed Reggie in the lower back. Reggie had spinal surgery last season. It was a stupid thing for Randle to do too.  &gt;Whole Knicks team has been playing out that fake tough guy energy then whining like hell when Kevin Heurter of all dudes hard fouls someone lmao  What a stupid comment. Huerter grabbed Noel's leg and pulled it out from under him. And all Noel did was say ""don't do that"". He didn't even step to Huerter. I'm not sure what games you're actually watching man. Huerter also grabbed someone around the neck and Knicks didn't step to him either.  Hawks are 100% outplaying us this series and we deserve to lose. I don't doubt we will."
Kevin huerter and Danilo have been choking people and throwing elbows and grabbing ankles. It’s about even.
Kevin huerter is a perennial all star in the making
"Trae Young, Bogdan Bogdanovic, John Collins, and Kevin Huerter had never played in the playoffs before this season either."

"Tl;dr: No I’m not. I think this years performance was expected given fatigue, injuries, and covid - the first two I assumed would be a problem before the season started. People expected the Celtics to be way better because they assumed certain things about the team’s health that didn’t end up happening.  Kemba/Smart/the Jays have played less minutes together the entire regular season than they did in the bubble last year. Our ideal lineup in Kemba/Smart/Jaylen/Jayson/Rob Will has started only 7 games together. We went 6-1 with our only loss being against Philly and we beat teams like the Bucks and blew out teams like the Nuggets.  Only three guys have played at least 60 games: Pritchard has the most with 66 then Tatum with 64 and Grant Williams with 63. Every other team with a rookie leading the team in games played is in the lottery.   In this scenario, especially given that we are a top heavy team, you get things like Mo Wagner as a starting center, Jaylen Brown playing out of position as the starting point guard, or starting our two way player at point guard with our rookie point guard coming off the bench.  Atlanta, despite the many injuries, had John Collins, Trae Young, Clint Capela, Kevin Huerter, and Solomon Hill all play over 60 games. The Knicks had RJ and Randle play 72 and 71 games respectively plus all of Bullock, Noel, Quickley, Payton, and Obi play at least 60. Miami’s probably had the closest situation to us but their rookie was at least fourth in games played as they had Robinson play all 72 games and Bam, Iggy, and Precious play at least 60. Bucks had Lopez and Forbes play 70 games and Pat, Middleton, Donte, Portis, and Giannis all play over 60.  There’s actually a ton more reasons I’m very optimistic about our future after having lower expectations than most this year but this is already way too long. I’m happy to share if you’re interested though."
Kevin Huerter is better and it probably isn’t close
And they’ve made up for it by calling phantom calls on the Knicks like the Kevin Huerter player where he literally threw the ball out of bounds without being touched and they called a foul and Reggie’s steal on Trae at the half court that despite being all ball was somehow a foul.  The hawks really need to stop complaining so much it’s pretty pathetic at this point
Those are Kevin huerters fam. They are from New York and were most likely Knicks fans until huerter got drafted. I hope they know it’s just us being loud and that we didn’t mean any hate

So, Mike Woodson.

The Hawks have drafted exceptionally well with the 19th pick in the past. We drafted Jeff Teague who was technically an all-star at 19. We picked John Collins an efficient 20-10 guy and possible future all-star at 19. We picked Kevin Huerter a reliable starter/6th man jack-of-all-trades at 19.  Naturally this means we're probably getting the 20th pick this year.

Wow the disrespect to Kevin Huerter is real.... LOL
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
&gt;key role players like Bogdan Bogdanovic and Kevin Huerter are questionable for Game 1 of the series  no theyre not lol we kept them out cause the last game didnt matter and we didnt wanna risk em
"Ah no, Kevin Huerter too"
"sad Hawks guard rotation  Trae, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Lou Will/Rondo, Kevin Huerter, Tony Snell"
Who’s beating this team:  PG: Criminal Alex Caruso  SG: K’Von Huerter  SF: Fat Luka Doncic  PF: Kevin Love  C: Nikola Jokic’s Brother
"Just like Hawks v 76ers game.  Chuck was right ""If I don't see a single Kevin Huerter highlight somethings wrong"".  He had two highlights and the rest focused on Trae.   You can argue while Trae did have a bad game and hit shots that mattered you can also argue the other shots Huerter hit mattered also.  Focus is only on the stars till they go down."
Kevin huerter: “did you know if you change the letters in my last name with some others you can spell Durant? Come on it’s been right in front of you all this time”
"Kevin Huerter: Come on, you know who I am. I'm Kevin Durant."
smh and Kevin Huerter was right there.
"Unfair to expect role players to step up at times like this, as long as Kevin Huerter gets his usual 50 we'll be fine"
*Kevin huerter takes off his mask to reveal that he is in fact Kevin Durant*
"I would want both of them, Payton Pritchard, Kevin Huerter, Alex Caruso, JJ Reddick, Joe Ingles, Gordon Hayward, Porzingis, and Nico Mannion for no particular reason."
Yeah but now they have to deal with the undisputed goat ginger Kevin Huerter
Kevin (Huerter) is the best player in the world
Kevin Huerter just looked good since Doc didn’t adjust by allowing his undersized son-in-law to guard Huerter in the last series. The nimble Huerter should be praying now that he doesn’t get Middleton matched up with him since he will be barbecue chicken for Middleton on both ends.
Trash because they don’t have Kevin Huerter
"&gt;Kevin Heurter and John Collins just heavily contributed to us winning a trip to the ECF and they were both drafted at 19, 3 and 4 years ago.  A lot of guys have the talent and it's a matter of investing in them to develop their game.  The talent dropoff is not as sharp as people act even if it seems that way because there are just limited minutes for NBA players on the fringe of being rotation players  Yes, but neither Heurter nor Collins are franchise players.   The talent drop off matters a lot because securing a franchise player is the key to becoming a championship team. Collins and Huerter are the players you want to pick up after you find your franchise player."
"Kevin ""The Process"" Huerter"
"The impact of the 2018 draft class in this year’s playoffs are crazy. Ayton, Trae, Luka, MPJ, Kevin Huerter, Mikal Bridges.  Missing my boy Shai :("
"First Tyler Herro, then Kevin Huerter, now Caruso with ""Hood tendencies pt 3"" lol"
Shades of Kevin Huerter right there
Cam Payne 🤝 Kevin Huerter  Being the GOAT
Payne having his Kevin Huerter game
"MJ made the game go global, Kevin Huerter will make it go Universal."
"Cameron ""Kevin Huerter"" Payne"
Cameron “kevin huerter” Payne
Kevin Huerter is who Herro thinks he is
KEVIN “WHAT SHE DOESNT KNOW WONT” HUERTER
"I agree, context is important buts it's not 1:1 apt comparison as people want to make it.   Its more cultural than it is race or racial stereotyping in my opinion  If I wrestle and someone says I wrestle like an eastern caucasian my name should be mrpeligrov, I'm not going to lose my shit about it.   Likewise if Kevin huerter is hitting all these step back fadeways, looking like a prime Jordan, and his teammates want to call him k'von and he embraces it, no problem with that either.   I think people want to interject persecution and complex where there is none."
"Kevin ""so big he's gonna"" Huerter"
"I'm not white(but I don't expect you to believe that),   In any case, Yes Huerter was playing not like himself, hitting saucy as moves, so I don't see the fault in the nickname. I think people look for issues where there is no issue. Like Kevin Martin saying about culture appropriation because Jeremy lin has dreads and Lin pointed out the hypocrisy that he had Chinese tattoos.  It's not always the same. It'll never be 1:1 the same. No matter how many people cry about ""Oh its double standards"" I just roll my eyes every-time I see that.   When Udonis Haslem was Called [Haslem-berg](https://twitter.com/IraHeatBeat/status/1369827658998161408), you don't see any white racists crying about that."
Is Kevin Huerter black or white?  Yes.
"Alright, fair enough. I don't even consider Herro a bad playoff performer myself, I just think it's a little too early to act like it's ridiculous to take Kevin Huerter over Tyler Herro if we're gonna use one good playoff performance as a judgment, because Huerter's been good in this postseason too and it's his first one, just like with Herro last year. Herro's good playoffs is better than Huerter's so far, but Huerter is doing far more than expected, too. He's a huge reason the Hawks are in the ECF, and it's hard to rank carrying your team through a game 7 versus something like dropping 37 to go up 3-2."
"Nah, its not ben. Ben could have played better, but it's not on ben. You should be able to beat the atlanta hawks when your second best player who's not even known as a scorer is playing terrible.  This isn't the milwaukee bucks or Brooklyn Nets. Philly is not playing Kawhi's raptors. They're playing the atlanta hawks. Even if ben sat out the whole series, they would have been favored to beat them in 4 or 5 games.  They almost did that. Those blown leads and the lineups in game 7 cost them that opportunity.  Me putting the blame on ben for the collapse is like me putting the blame on seth curry because he can't guard huerter. It's a half ass analogy, but what I'm saying is that They had opportunities to win the game and I don't feel the coach maximize those opportunities even with the poor play from simmons. Lue sat kyrie and kevin love to win a playoff game. Doc can't do that to not blow two massive leads?"
&gt; Because Kevin Huerter is white  What is Gallinari then?
"Doc is a terrible coach. He's had so many great players, hof players and he's won once, and made 2 finals appearances, while the celtics made multiple conf finals when he left, only to be really stopped by lebron during doc's clipper tenure.   Brett Brown lost to kawhi leonard on a basket with 04.2 to go. Doc Rivers lost to kevin huerter bulling seth curry in the post in game 7.  Who's really responsible for the collapse? it's doc. Think about it the 26pt lead. Does that happen without hack a ben? How is atlanta going to generate 27 points without fouling a terrible FT shooter to come back in the game. You mean you couldn't keep ben out for that amount of time?  Come on man. I've seen the doc story way too much. He made Kawhi Leonard look like tony snell in game 7 and had him guarding Jokic because he refused to take out montrezl harrell who was a -61 for the entire playoff run. Jokic even said it himself that Zubac is a tough defender after the series.   Doc didn't play zu in second halfs of the game, pretty much all year.   When Ben Simmons gets traded and he will and Doc messes up again, you'll see doc is a bigger issue to worry about then ben simmons. Ben simmons just has a shit contract, that's really all. He's a decent player, just not a max or big contract player."
"well obviously that came to be true, but an 8 seed and a 5 seed + avoiding the nets should be coasted through by a true 1 seed was his point  it’s nothing against the hawks, they deserved to win the series and we’re clearly the better team in it, just this opportunity wouldn’t arise often and probably won’t again where you get to avoid steph, lebron, kd, harden, jimmy etc  unfortunately they ran into kevin huerter instead lol"
"You mean Kevin ""steal yo girl"" Huerter?!"
Tbh it’s cuz Kevin huerter is a white dude. This subreddit identifies with him on a personal level.
KD is an empty stats loser who doesn't hold a candle to chad Kevin Huerter
"Its more exciting because of stars being less than their normal selves in the playoffs and then guys like Terrance Mann and Kevin Huerter erupting for huge games, it lends to unpredictability.  Also, games never seem out of reach, there were several HUGE leads that were blown, so you basically gotta watch every game down to the wire"
because kevin huerter is a bucket??
Lol this list is a joke without Kevin Huerter or Terrance Mann
"Kevin Huerter is not an MVP. I sucked dick for a Terance Mann rookie card. Have you ever sucked dick for Kevin Huerter? No, you haven't. Boo."
Not a lot of people know this but Michael Jordan got his turnaround fadeaway from Kevin Huerter
FIXED IT FOR YOU: Why is everyone talking about Kevin Huerter and Gallinari but not Travis Schlenk after this series?
"I was happy to see Gallo do well in Game 7 but I was yelling ""Get it to Kevin!"" at the screen during game 7 because Huerter was shooting so well. It also seemed like Kevin was scoring off Curry, Harris, Embiid, Simmons. Like, no one was a problem for him. He had an amazing game."
"Who is this Kevin ""Red Velvet"" Huerter and Danillo Gallinari?  The only player who played and lost in that series is Ben Simmons.   No one else played in that series it's only Ben Simmons"
You guys lost to Kevin Huerter.
"Hasn't that sentiment turned out to be exactly true? I think we can be absolutely positive that Gobert isn't as good in the playoffs as he is in the regular season, and we just arguing to what degree.   And, we are also absolutely positive that Embiid and Simmons doesnt work in the playoffs despite all the regular season net rating numbers etc that says it does.  The only kinda playoffs are different ""hot take"" that hasn't be bourn out is Trea will get picked on. But, the Knicks and Sixers didn't have the personal to do it. I mean, the Hawks were playing Lou will and Trea at the same time and the Sixers couldn't do anything about it while Kevin Huerter played Seth Curry off the court at various points.  Obviously, Trea will never get played off the court, he's a fantastic offensive player. But, we haven't see what it looks like when an elite permitter player targets him the way other weak links like MPJ get picked on."
Because Kevin Huerter has red hair
"Tobias was 8/24, Embiid had 8 turnovers, Seth Curry got bullied on defense giving up 27 to kevin huerter (by the way ive said huerter was gonna be a beast for a few years now because he cooked us way back then, of course he had to prove me right at the worst time). People are shitting on ben for what he didnt do, he was +1 in game 7 and Embiid was -6, Tobias I think was -4. I know its single game +/- but it still means something"
Tell that to John Collins and Kevin Huerter
"if you want a shooting guard who can isn’t an offensive liability and can reasonably guard 6’7” Kevin Huerter then you want.. KCP? I mean Seth was legitimately the primary reason (outside of Joel) that the Sixers even made it to 7 games, I’m not sure there are many players that would be an active positive on the offense while not having poor defense, KH is a tall boy."
"I'm so tired of hearing Luka would do this and that in the east. You are speculating. Plus, Cam Reddish has been nice when he has been healthy. Also, a part of that deal.  Yep, he signed Rondo. And yep he flipped him for a better player and better team fit in Lou Will.  'The rest of the league didnt have cap space' is about the dumbest argument I ever heard in regards to his FA signings.  He is clearly one of the best GMs in the league. He drafted John Collins and Kevin Huerter at 19. He drafted/traded for  a superstar in Trae. He drafted potential all-stars in DeAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish and traded for a top 5 NBA center for literally nothing.  You are hating so hard."
you dont need elite D you need someone who isnt a liability that’s targeted by kevin huerter in a game 7. jus sayin
It could have been avoided if: - Thybulle didn't foul on a 3  - Dwight didn't get a flagrant foul - Danny Green didn't get injured - Kevin Huerter wasn't Kevin Huerant - Trae Young didn't have ice running through his veins - The Pacers didn't fire Nate McMillan - The Hawks didn't fire Lloyd Pierce - The Sixers didn't hire Doc Rivers - Tony Snell
DBook the next Kevin Huerter
Kevin Huerter with the wine bottle at the end lol
Fun fact KAT making the playoffs is the only reason we have Kevin “it’s so big it’s gunna” Huerter. We got their draft pick because they made the playoffs
Yeah. The 76ers have a list of errors and bad performance other than Simmons to blame the loss on.  But Simmons is escaped goat because that play stands out because of how weird it was.  But 76ers as a collective did not play well to get the win.... Kevin Huerter also killed them... Including that Thybulle foul on him during crunch time.
The bubble of reality?   Do you think advertisers give LeBron and Steph and KD millions even though the casual fan is sick of them? They could save that money and give it to Kevin Huerter and Jae Crowder who the casual fan loves.
Kevin Huerter x 15
"5-23 but he made his free throws, provided assists, and was generally drawing constant double teams which provided better shots for his team.   But yes Kevin Huerter still gets the game ball of course"
Incorrect we had to face Kevin Huerter
Next man up. I enjoy watching guys like Terrence Mann being forced to put up 39 or Kevin Huerter having to put up 27 cause all the Hawks' other wings are injured.
"It doesn't hurt our offense a little. Your talking about a swing of probably at least 15 ppg from CJ to Ben, and the inevitable drop in points from Dame not having the ball in his hands, could very well swing that an additional 5 pts. And then add to that Nurk would be spending more time on the perimeter, when he shouldn't be shooting more than a couple 3's a game at most, add another 2 or 3 points there. We could legit go from 130ppg to 105-110ppg. No one in their right mind could say Ben is worth 20ppg on defense alone. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Anyone want to point me to the prolific offense that Ben Simmons has piloted that gives everyone so much faith in him? Did anyone watch what Trae Young and Kevin Huerter just turned him into?"
"Kevin Huerter roasted Seth Curry.  Repeatedly.  But Seth hit a couple of threes, so it doesnt matter at all."
"Yes, Kevin huerter broke them"
Kevin Huerter is still playing
"John Hollinger's analysis perfectly described how Atlanta was able to run their most potent offensive lineup because they only had to guard 4 of the Sixers when Ben was on the floor. ""The reason Kevin Huerter was able to annihilate Curry on isos in Game 7 was because the Sixers had no place else to put Curry. The reason for that was because Atlanta was playing the 6-foot-10 Gallinari at small forward. He’s the walking definition of toast against most perimeter matchups, but not in this one … because he could take Simmons and hang out in the paint, comfortable in the knowledge that his assignment would never shoot. It took the Hawks a few games to get to this arrangement consistently, but by the end of the series, they were able to play their best offensive lineup rent-free."""
"To that point, John Hollinger has excellent analysis. ""The reason Kevin Huerter was able to annihilate Curry on isos in Game 7 was because the Sixers had no place else to put Curry.

"Kevin ""Didn't Wanna"" Huerter"
"Alright, I'll go one step further even. The Hawks owned the Timberwolves pick that season, but it was lottery protected. The Timberwolves made the playoffs as an 8 seed by one game, meaning that if the Timberwolves had lost that game to the Hawks, they wouldn't have made the playoffs and the pick wouldn't have conveyed. That pick turned into Kevin Huerter, who was the primary reason the Hawks won last night. Which means that game Simmons was clowning the Hawks for directly led to the Sixers losing last night"
"nah SLC's toxicity doesn't target some players, such as Kevin Huerter and Bodgan Bogdanovic"
exposed like kevin huerter at the beach without an umbrella
"&gt; Also isn't the Hawks winning with a singular star kinda proving that you don't need a big 3?  Hey now, Kevin Huerter has plenty of help."
"Kevin Huerter, Bogdan, Collins and Gallo can create their own shot. The Mavs don't have anyone besides maybe THJ and Brunson that can do that"
"He's the best shooter but he also got absolutely abused by Kevin Huerter on defense in Game 7. I just dont think you could theoretically play him and McCollum together in a playoff game, he would be a great option off the bench but I'm not sure if he would want to accept that role. Then again, the Hawks did just play Trae Young and Lou Williams together for stretches this round but that just said more about the Sixers abysmal scoring than anything."
Just another reminder that this Ben Simmons guy made the All-Star team over Trae Young.  Hell after Game 7 you can probably include Kevin Huerter as a guy more deserving of that All-Star spot.

"Tbf he did not shoot well enough in game 7 to overcome getting hunted by Kevin Huerter, that was instant offense for us whenever we needed a bucket."
Kevin “What she doesn’t know won’t” Huerter
It's cool when child tv stars like Malcolm in the middle's little brother grows up to become Kevin Huerter
"Tell that to Trae Young, Kevin Huerter, and Lou Williams. Most dominant Big 3 in the league"
The Atlanta Hawks under Trae Young?   More like The Atlanta Hawks under Kevin Huerter.  There I fixed it for ya
"Cool. Kevin Huerter and John Collins, two players that played key rolls in sending the 76ers packing, were both picked 19th. Good GMs can find value elsewhere in the draft. Brand and Colangelo made a bunch of bad moves, but Hinkie didn't exactly do them any favors by wasting lottery picks on bad players or bad fits."
"Kevin ""Ron Weasley"" Huerter"
Kevin Huerter and Terrence Mann co finals mvps
It is important to note that Kevin Huerter does not have his own chipotle bowl so please take that into account in your decision making process
Yeah but getting lit up by Kevin huerter should be on doc somewhat imo. At least throw some different defensive schemes on him instead of just letting him iso curry endlessly.
"&gt;around with their dad, Kevin Huerter  You better have some respect for Ron Weasley. He was carrying that offence. He even cooked Harris with a between the legs, stepback 3 which I didnt think he could do 😂"
"Kevin ""Durant"" Huerter"
Kevin Huerter Mr. New York State basketball 2016.   Tobias Harris was Mr. New York State basketball 2010.
Yeah we win this series with Danny playing. We almost needed his defense more than his offense. Would've been nice to have Danny when we were getting cooked by Lou Will and Kevin Huerter all series
Tired of Kevin Huerter being left out of the conversation
"Player development and trades. The Sixers FO were so focused on losing games, they forgot to develop their young players (you can't do both at the same time). The Sixers were looking for gold in the draft instead of finding guys like Terance Mann, Fred Vanvleet and Kevin Huerter to fill in the gaps in their team."

Kevin Huerter just rickrolled the Sixers LOL!
Letting Seth Curry get continually torched by Kevin Huerter and not doing a thing about it is a legit doc problem.
But what about a kevin huerter finals mvp
"I love kawhi, but overall pretty neutral too its gonna be fun to see which of these 4 teams wins. Also kevin huerter gonna get finals mvp XD"
"Kevin ""rm -rf the_process.exe"" Huerter"
Don’t disrespect the Red Velvet Assassin Kevin Huerter like that. Presumptive Finals MVP and GGOAT (greatest ginger of all time)
It doesn’t make you a more hardcore fan because you like watching all the best players get injured.  It makes you someone who only roots against greatness so you’re glad to see Reggie Jackson and Kevin Huerter be the finals matchup
No only morons are glad teams were eliminated due to injuries. Have fun with Reggie Jackson vs Kevin huerter for the nba title and pretending it’s the best basketball or something.  All the best players either got hurt or got bounced due to injury. That sucks. Sorry you’re such a baby you’re only way of viewing basketball is “I hope all the great players lose”
“Huerter” looks like a French name to you? Let alone “Kevin”? Lol
"Ty always had great adjustments game to game, or at least was willing to make adjustments that looked good. The LeGM and LeCoach memes were hilarious though so I always piled on as well 🙃   Doc thought after Kevin huerter scorched curry for a whole half that it’d be a good idea to….! Keep doing the exact same thing."
Kevin Huerter.
Kevin Huerter was cooking him last night on a few plays
"Yes, but does Kevin ""Red.velvet"" Huerter listen to Red Velvet?"
Kevin Huerter for the Hawks also stated that it is his favorite shot. It helps the rest of his game get going.
"-Locks: Trae, Ayton Luka -Wouldn’t surprise me: JJJ, Collin Sexton, Mikal Bridges, SGA, MPJ -Not max but big deals: Miles Bridges, Robert Williams, Kevin Huerter, Lonnie Walker"
"That pick got us Kevin Huerter, iirc"
Kevin Huerter
"But we've got winning examples too, Cam Payne, Terence Mann, Kevin Huerter, hell, the Clippers have become a Make-a-Wish roster, led by Paul George^(, who you can't see). Who wants to be the star tonight.  ^((that reference may or may not hit with this crowd))"
Kevin Huerter with the most minutes played for the Hawks. Low-key Most Important Player after Trae and Lou?
"Cam Reddish is a boom or bust type of guy with questionable shot selection but insane physical tools and very good defense. Hawks fans are overall way too high on him.   Kevin Huerter is a younger bogdan essentially with worse defense at this point in his career. Decent playmaking/shot creation potential, and already a knockdown shooter."
Lmao the Wizards ain’t trading Beal for a package starring a 28 year old bogdan or Kevin huerter…. This is utter fantasy.
"Lmk when Clint Capela, John Collins, or Kevin Huerter hit back to back deep pull-up threes late in the 4th quarter of an elimination game pal..."
2nd best behind Kevin Huerter
"I think this is more what I was getting at. Either Jrue isn't a top 30ish player, or Khris isn't, or something. But they can't both be on-ball top-30 guys surrounded by a good defense and still be underdogs to a team whose best player is... John Collins? Kevin Huerter? Lou Williams?"
"""It was you Kevin Huerter... You were holding that door."""
Ryen Russillo started it. The joke is that Kevin Huerter is major ladies man.
"The Hawks hit gold in the 2017-2019 drafts.  * John Collins (2017, 19th pick) * Trae Young (2018, 5th pick) * Kevin Huerter (2018, 19th pick) * De'Andre Hunter (2019, 4th pick, moved up by trading up with New Orleans) * Cam Reddish (2019, 10th pick, obtained from Luka Traed) * Onyeka Okongwu (2020, 6th pick, TBD how valuable of a contributor he can be)  Getting Taurean Prince (12th pick) and De'Andre Bembry (21st pick) in 2016 could have gone worse, too. Real minefield in that draft, with Papagiannis (13th), Yabusele (16th), Baldwin (17th), Ellenson (18th), Malachi Richardson (22nd), Zizic (23rd), Brice Johnson (25th) lurking. That doesn't even include Dragan Bender (4th), Kris Dunn (5th), Marquese Chriss (8th), and Thon Maker (10th). Bruno Fernando has been a letdown, but he was the 34th pick, so expectations can't be too high.  And somehow, they have positive draft capital moving forward (i.e. didn't sacrifice their picks unnecessarily).  Having all these guys on rookie deals means they were able to sign or acquire a bunch of vets to fill in their roster holes: Gallinari, Bogdanovic, Capela, Lou Will, and Solo. Their cap also allowed them to act as cap relief for other teams. Schlenk has done wonders for this team since his 2017 arrival. He apparently also scouted Draymond when he was working for the Warriors."
My Kevin Huerter FMVP bet is looking better and better.
Lou Williams - 7 million   kevin huerter - 2.6 million   John Collins- 2.7 million   clint capela- 15.5 million   bogdan bogdanovic- 18 million   Ummmm should I even put the bucks starting 5 salary? Lol
"The Hawks are built around Trae??? They still have Khris and Jrue who are all stars. Brook Lopez has good scoring ability.   Kevin Huerter, Bogdan, and Lou Williams are the Hawks playmakers. The rest is Gallo doing his weird shit.   The offense does not get barely worse tf. They lost 29 and 10."
"The Cam Reddish, Kevin Huerter disrespect 😤"
The Bucks still have the top 2 players with Khris and Jrue. Yet some people wanna say coach Bud catches too much slander.   Ima actually take the Hawks. They are deeper. Or at least they play deeper. This game was actually important even if they do lose Giannis for this very question. Because now you don't have Giannis and you still need to win this series.   I just doubt Milwaukee manages their offense. Maybe it helps them and they can put something together that's linear rather than being so out of sorts. Yet I'm still compelled to trust Kevin Huerter over Jrue and Khris. :/
Or Kevin Huerter 👀
"So trae is SLANDERED on his defense, it really has improved from last year but you will never hear it mentioned. He gets steals, and even doubles centers well (see embiid a few times). he also hawks passing lanes to make up for lack of size. BUT despite all this, the hawks scheme a defense entirely around trae in making sure he’s hidden in the corner guarding the “pj tuckers” of the world so he can’t really be taken advantage of. So the lack of having to scheme trae into the defense empowers the other hawk defenders to play a simplified man defense where some of them really shine, see Kevin huerter, cam reddish, Clint capela, and deandre hunter (when he gets a new knee). This obviously helps the hawks defend especially against star players like giannis. The clippers part is just stupid and doesn’t even dignify a response. Sorry bro"
Can't wait for the pj tucker v Kevin huerter promotional photos for the rest of the series
"John Collins, Kevin Huerter, and Cam Reddish outworked the entire Bucks team tonight. Bogi and Lou Will provided much needed buckets. OO is the best Giannis defender in NBA? HAWKS IN SIX!"
"Kevin Huerter vs Reggie Jackson, FTFY"
"It's insane how few stars are healthy right now. Basically it's just George, Booker, Paul, and Middleton. (E: obligatory mention of fringe stars: Holiday, Ayton) If Young/Giannis/Kawhi don't get healthy, one of those 4 is probably going to be your finals MVP.  Who the fuck am I kidding? Kevin Huerter is going to go God mode somehow and win it."

"That’s the thing is though, we’re comparing it to super teams we’ve seen within recent years but we need to realize that the Golden State Warriors having 4 All Stars on one team is something we see probably 2-3 times every 20 years. That was a dynasty. Yes most teams usually have a 2nd all star so to use that comparison is understandable but even with that being said, I don’t think this Hawks team is far off from in the future having 2-3 All Stars. They might not be now but they still have a great team where I can see Trae being an All Star and Kevin Huerter/John Collins well."

"Kevin Huerter? I ‘ardly know ‘er!  …okay, not my best joke. At least I know Chauncey Billups found that funny."
I'm just waiting for Space Jam 3 with Kevin Huerter in 10 years
Streets need a 40+ point Kevin Huerter game. Shake things up a lil bit.
How blessed am I that I get to spend today in the televised sporting company of **TWO** based ginger sports gods named Kevin?! It is a very charmed life I lead.   Hopefully Huerter can get a win with the Hawks like De Bruyne was able to do with Belgium today (and doesn't get injured in the process).
"Good point, and I do think that Simmons has a higher ceiling if he can mentally get right. This isn't even a conversation if Kevin Huerter doesn't absorb the powers from the Monstars basketball before game 7, but I think that in terms of current trade value the two are comparable."
Chill bro!  Get that Kevin Huerter fleshlight out for some pre-game relaxation.
"JC is supposed to be that guy that'll be #2 for us, but the beauty of this hawks team is we have plenty of players (Lou Williams, Danilo Gallinari, Clint Capela, Kevin Huerter) in our lineup that can heat up and be the #2 on any night.  The game will really be fought and won in the back court though, jrue and Khris is a nice duo and we gotta be ready to answer them if they start going off"
Bogdanovic knee injury is a big loss for the Hawks. He doesnt look like himself on the court. Kevin Huerter is too inconsistent.. not sure if the Hawks can find a 2nd scorer next to Trae this series meanwhile they cant stop Giannis. Their guards cant guard Jrue at all. If Middleton can get going with his shot this series prob over quick.
Kevin Huerter on Rudy Gobert. Something about him being ginger and yamming on big boy just gets me
"between Ayton, Trae, Mikal Bridges, Kevin Huerter, and Bruce Brown, and obviously Luka, the 2018 draft really showed up for this year's playoffs."
Kevin Huerter
Kevin huerter
"Collins works really well on inside defence with Capella, and his rebound and block numbers aren't that far off him. Kevin Huerter has become a decent perimeter defender under Nate. Bogi is a solid perimeter defender, and Trae's been averaging close to a steal per game.  It's not the 76ers, but it's not the sieve everyone like to think it is either."
Must be nice having a defence that doesn't get punked by Kevin Huerter
they let kevin huerter get like 30 lmao
Definitely Kevin Huerter tonight
"When the Hawks are in trouble, it's unfair you get to go to Kevin Huerter. Just unfair."

I just wanna say that I love Kevin Huerter. That guy is so focused and not afraid of anyone during these playoffs.
"TNT has a Red Velvet already, Kevin Huerter will go by the name I came up for him last year, The Saratoga Sensation."
Like Solomon hill and Kevin Huerter?
I heard Kevin Huerter discuss this in a radio interview yesterday or the day before. IIRC he said that McMillan is just more organized than Pierce was; guys know their roles better now and play more cohesively as a result.
"It’s too early but it’s not crazy to think 2018 can be that caliber.  It’s not just Luka Trae Ayton it’s MPJ, JJJ, SGA, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Miles Bridges, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent, Robert Williams Kevin Huerter, even Bagley will probably still be very good. There’s also a lot of great role players as well throughout the draft that will likely have long careers.  Way too early to be comparing them to the all time great classes but they have an argument that they are on track to be in that convo"
Maybe he’s just not actually that bad on defense. Kevin Huerter was able to play Seth Curry off the floor just last series.
Welcome to the Kevin Huerter style of basketball
KEVIN HERO BALL HUERTER
"As a Maryland grad, I'd like to apologize to Hawks fans for Kevin Huerter"
Kevin Huerter is probably the worst player in the league and 40 minutes this game  Coached by an idiot that has won 1 playoff series  in 15 years.  Against the Knicks
Kevin Huerter needs help out there
"Kevin Huerter and Trae are the only 2 players on our team who have hit 3s, we need the rest of our shooters to step up."
"Luka had the best offense in the NBA last year and it persisted when he was on the bench. Every analyst had the Mavs above the Hawks this year, and now that Trae's team looks better suddenly Luka's team sucks and Trae is being carried by Kevin Huerter and Lou Williams."
Trae young gonna need another player to join the party hello Kevin Huerter got 15 points at the half? do these guys even watch the fucking game?
TRAE YOUNG FOR 3!!!!!!!! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3   ^(tobias harris makes a 3)   KEVIN HUERTER FOR 3!!!! 😍😍😍😍
Post Kevin Huerter making 3 big plays in a row
Kevin 'what she doesnt know cant' Huerter
"&gt;As bad as the Mavs are, it's not like the Hawks are a juggernaut either  Hawks have John Collins, Capela, Bogdan, Gallo, Kevin Huerter, and etc. This Hawks team is stacked and meanwhile Luka has THJ and KP (who is horrible) and he still took the clippers to 7 games."
KEVIN MOTHERFUCKIN RED VELVET HUERTER
I just put $100 down on Kevin Huerter for Finals MVP!
"Cool. Contracts aside... would you swap Tim Hardaway, Jr for Lou Williams? And have you seen Gallo try to create a shot with less than 5 seconds on the clock? It's like he's dribbling a neutron star. Bogi certainly makes timely shots, but is mostly dependent on good ball movement for those opportunities. Kevin Huerter has definitely been improving in this area, so I'll concede at the very least his  burgeoning status as a playmaker. But... come on... are any non-Hawks fans salivating over Kev and his 11.9 per?   THAT is what I am smoking. Wanna hit?"
"You had a 6MOTY candidate in Brunson.   Josh Richardson was strangely booty all season, just like Porzingis was. Hmm kinda strange all these solid players just underperforming on a team that doesn’t bother to make defined roles for them.   You had THJ as well who is clearly better than expected, and you HAD Seth Curry who you gave up because you didn’t need any offensive weapons outside Luka.   All these dudes could run a play just as well as Kevin fucking Huerter, it’s just that the team only gives a shit about Luka.  Once Luka cares about making the team around him feel involved outside of occasional kickouts you’re gonna see better performances.  (Using the royal you here lol)"
Kevin Huerter box score is laughably atrocious.   Good on them for the comeback tho.
"Kevin Huerter is better than KD and Trae, yes"
"Curry was the second best Sixer on offense, but the *only* liability on defense.  Kevin Huerter hunted and ruined that guy.  *Kevin Huerter!*"
Kevin Huerter
The only right answer is Kevin Huerter
Kevin Huerter can ball. His last name says it all.
The Kevin Huerter and Terance Mann disrespect in this topic is palpable.
I think Simmons is buns and I agree offence in a vacuum is more valuable. Just pointing out the Hawks haven't played a team that matchup hunts. You guys had Kevin Huerter pretty much wreck Seth Curry and Gallo go right at Geroge Hill when he was on him.   The ultimate fuck you was playing Lou Will and Trea at the same time. It was like we can play anyone and the Sixers don't have the personel to do anything about it.
Is Kevin Huerter this year’s Tyler Herro or is he better?

"Top stars are out?? Book, CP3, Trae, Giannis, and Kevin Huerter would like a word."
"Tbh prior to the draft and leading up to it I'm sure a fuck ton of people in Atlanta were hoping Bagley drops to #3.   I think so many people thought one of the top 2 teams were going to draft Doncic and a bunch of people compared Doncic to Darko Milicic.   Cause I think Suns HC was I think Slovenias former HC and I think everyone and their mother thought Vlade Divac was going to draft the European kid. So we thought hey Bagley would be great.  I get that the last day or two we totally fully bought into Doncic and it was a meltdown when Woj got on the screen and announced the trade. After the trade was announced, everyone on the Hawks subreddit was praying Memphis would draft Trae but they drafted JJJ.   And in the end it's like Luka is at top. A slight step we got Trae and then a drop later we got Ayton and Kevin Huerter and then a drop later we got Sexton and JJJ. And Bagley didn't do too well in the league YET!"

Kevin Huerter has just become our father on this father's day.
From MD. I lived in Saratoga NY when Kevin won NY State Player of the Year. Followed him to MD and been praising him ever since. Bought a baby blue Huerter Hawks jersey right after he was drafted.

I just got out a Thai prison and I haven't seen NBA in while. Is Kevin Huerter the best player in the NBA?
Kevin Huerter is what Nets fans thought Joe Harris was
Good to see role players like Trae Young step up to help out the MVP Kevin Huerter
"Revisionist history as its finest.  - The Milwaukee Bucks were arguably biggest favorites coming out of the East in most recent seasons &amp; made a lot of great additions to make their roster even better.  - The East being weak is a false narrative &amp; simply not true. Brooklyn Nets, 76ers &amp; Bucks were the biggest title contenders before going into this playoffs.  - Trae had much worse teammates than Luka last year, but didn't get any of those excuses. Especially when Luka had the best offense in the NBA last year and it persisted when he was on the bench. Every analyst had the Mavs above the Hawks this year, and now that Trae's team looks better suddenly Luka's team sucks and Trae is being carried by Kevin Huerter and Lou Williams."
"Did you watch game 7? In the second round of the playoffs through the Finals, you simply cannot start guys who get destroyed in defense like Seth was on every play, by Kevin Huerter of all people. He’s a nice player. He’s gonna get paid. But a championship team can’t be starting him."
Kevin Huerter will step it up when he needs to.
But there’s no fun players in this playoffs. What? Devin Booker? Trae Young? CP3? Giannis? Kevin Huerter? Never heard of them
"I mean, no, you just have to hit on draft picks, and get value wherever you can.  Considering we're talking about the team that got Trae with the 5th pick, JC with the 19th pick, Kevin Huerter with the 19th pick, swung the trade for buy low on Capela, etc. I have faith in our FO managing that stuff well.  Even Okongwu has had some terrific flashes in the playoffs, which for a rookie big man is a great look.   ------  I get your concern, but I don't think penny-pinching on John Collins is the way to go. Homegrown guy, been here through the rebuild, great synergy with Trae, great personality, bought into exactly the kind of culture McMillan is trying to build, and has stepped up in the playoffs when it's mattered the most.   ------------  In a technical sense, I'm sure the ""smart"" thing to do is to work a sign-and-trade or something for him, but the wise decision is to recognize the value he provides beyond the stat sheet, and the type of behavior that you want to reward when you're building the team identity for an organization that has literally never been as successful as they are right now."
"Kevin ""Rick Astley"" Huerter"
"Trae enabled Marcelino Huerter to become Kevin Huertas. Trae makes his teammates better. He's a showman, not a ballhog diva"
"Bogi can barely run his knee is so fucked. He's also performed pretty poorly the entire playoffs even before the he injury save a few games.  Gallo has been up and down. Has had some great offensive performances mixed in with some stinkers where he also got dominated on the boards and defensively  Huerter has been up and down minus his career game (game seven kevin)  Capela is really only a lob threat (which is still a great option for the offense in general) but for instance in the philly series he was almost completely a non factor on offense  The only dude on this list that has given the hox ""starter level"" play in terms of all star performance would be john collins minus one game where he got into foul trouble.  Trae is putting the team on his back in terms of scoring, controlling the pace of play, handling the ball (we don't actually have many good ball handlers lol), and setting up his teammates. It's the beauty of having a great point guard who can also score at will and is fast enough that even in the P&amp;R there is no answer."
"I think it’d finally put him in the upper echelon of players in the league period, not just PGs or young players  That being said expect Bucks to get the ball out his hands at all costs, outside of lobs, put backs, and PnR dives to the rim no one else really scored for us. Make an injured Bogi and Kevin Huerter beat you. Kevin came through for us vs. Philly, we’ll see if he can do it again"
"Yea I don’t think it’s ridiculous to say at this point, but my thinking is a little more like this.   The two of them could have played exactly the same as they did, but say their teammates make one or two less shots in a critical game or the opponent makes one or two more. Say in game 7 against the sixers where Trae shot horrendously, Kevin huerter has a performance like he did in game 3 (I think that’s the one, where he shot 0-8) and they lose by double digits. Porzingis or THJ shoot a little better and the mavs beat the Clippers. The popular narrative would be so so different without Luka or Trae playing any different at all.   I personally was getting tired of all the Luka love especially on this sub so I’m happy to see Trae so well. But at the same time what Luka did in the Clippers series looked like him making his case for legitimately top 2-3 in the league, and I see Luka winning an mvp and I can’t envison the same for Trae. But yeah, we’ll see, the league is blessed with so much young talent right now."
Kevin “Hope it doesnt” Huerter
famously known as the 'Kevin Huerter draft class'
Kevin Huerter. End of list
We’ve also got Kevin Huerter. His name starts with a K.
"He’s a poor, poor, mans Kevin Huerter."
"And despite still shot as efficiently as Trae on higher volume.   Trae shot 5-23 in Game 7 against the 76ers, he's only even here for the grace of Kevin Huerter. He is the one who is a liability."
"Come on, you can't be serious, it's amazing Luka even gets 10 assists every night. Just think about it, his scoring options are Dorian finney-smith, Tim hardaway, Jr., Josh Richardson, boban and kristaps, all whom forgets how to shoot a ball every other night. Meanwhile, Trae has Bogdan, Danilo, John Collins, Kevin huerter and Clint capela. Can't compare the two, man."
