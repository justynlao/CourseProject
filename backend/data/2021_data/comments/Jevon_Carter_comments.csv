"I’m not sure what got into him, but it’s awesome. He and Jevon Carter played a full court press in the bubble and legitimately terrorized teams. Payne’s been dealing with some lingering injuries this season and we’re a worse team without him. He’s still shooting at a nice clip, his playmaking has gotten even better, and he’s one of the few guys on our team that can take the ball to the rim. He is super unorthodox and nothing about it is “pretty” but he’s a rock solid player now. A lot of what he does is just high effort, high energy play. I think falling out of the league was the best thing that could have happened to him because he is way more mature and focused now."
"This huge lead can cause people not to notice that Jevon Carter is throwing up some bricks, good lord"
"Disclaimer that this is not an excuse and this lineup 100% blew a 23 point lead against Detroit.  **Starters:**  PG: CP3  SG: Book  SF: Mikal  PF: Crowder  C: Ayton  **Bench:**  PG: Cam Payne  SG: Jevon Carter  SF: Langston Galloway for first 10 games, Abdel Nader after  PF: Cam Johnson  C: Dario Saric  Book, Saric, Payne have been battling injuries or covid. Payne turned his ankle (i think in the houston game), came back, and hasn't really been since; he was on fire to start the season. Saric was in almost all of our most productive lineups, and the dropoff from him to kaminsky is steep. But kaminsky is simply better than Damian Jones who by all means should not be on a roster.   Cam Johnson was 9 of 35 from 3 coming into this game over the last 5 games, where he took over for Jae Crowder in the starting lineup but probably shouldn't have? Idk, the starters were really, really bad, and it was apparent in the Wizards game.  The suns hot start was due to insanely hot bench production. Mikal, Cam Payne and Cam Johnson would take us on massive runs and the starters would allow teams to come back into it, but in the Jazz and Denver games (first ones), our lead was too big to blow or we somehow clutched it out with book / cp3 isos. Those isos have not been working in the more recent clutch games. Vs. Memphis, Houston, and Denver twice, Ayton played amazingly, and when we need him to be dominant against an aging Al Horford, he gives us 5 points on 6 shots and a bunch of soft baby hooks screaming of indecision.  Surely, the starters' lack of production cannot be THIS poor for so long. For a group of high-contributing basketball players, ***playing this bad is IMPOSSIBLY UNSUSTAINABLE.***   But if there's a team that can do the impossibly negative, it's the Phoenix Suns.  I thoroughly expect the Warriors to shove their fist up their asses tomorrow."
jevon carter always dancing lmao
"Yes, behind the help of Finals MVP Jevon Carter, DPOY Mikal Bridges, 6MOY Cam Johnson, and Backup Point Guard Chris Paul, anything's possible"
Jevon Carter representing every Suns fan in that clip
It’s definitely Jevon Carter.
so [Jevon Carter](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/carteje01/gamelog/2021/) has a shot u say
jevon carter
"Now is the time to jump on the Suns bandwagon. We're historically a winning team, but the 2010's were very unkind to us. We have, however, taken great strides to turn that around, and I think we've got a lot going for us now.  1) A young star player in Devin Booker that shows improvement every single year (though he's off to a slow start this year) and has shown incredible loyalty and passion to the city/fans.  2) One of the most talented and respected vets in the league in Chris Paul, who people call the Point God for a reason.  3) A high energy young core of players that give it all on offense and defense, ranging from respectable role players to potential All-Stars down the line, in Mikal, Ayton and Cam Johnson.  4) A scrappy bench mob consisting of Cam Payne, Jevon Carter, Dario Saric, and Langston Galloway that is just smothering on defense and lethal on offense  5) An endearing and respectable head coach in Monty Williams.  Biggest drawback is our owner is a cheap bastard with a history of meddling where he shouldn't. Lately though, he's been much quieter and hands off while our new GM, James Jones, has turned our trashcan fire of the 2010's completely around and created a very strong, balanced, and deep team. Things are looking these days, so why not praise the Suns?"
don't forget Jevon Carter
"You forgot to mention the fella Jevon ""the bald guy on the Suns playing annoying ass defense"" Carter"

Bringing the ball up against Jevon Carter and Cam Payne looks miserable.
1. Booker 2. Ayton 3. Bridges 4. Cam Johnson 5. CP3 6. Dario 7. Jalen Smith  Though 7 could also be Jevon Carter. I'd be bummed to lose Crowder in this scenario though
9. Jevon Carter
Could you put someone like Tyler Hansbrough out there just to hard foul the shit out of him anytime he turns the corner? I would put Jevon Carter out there and tell him to just go for it.
I will not tolerate Jevon Carter slander
I really liked the way Jevon Carter played in the bubble (dude was a freaking bulldog) but this has not been his year so far.  Granted he isn't likely to continue hitting 2 out of 15 from 3.
Jevon Carter was -19 in 3:20 lol
"Not only Chris Paul but Bridges is absolutely shooting and defending great, Crowder is playing well, Cam Johnson is shooting well and somehow Payne is resurging, Jevon Carter is a good defender and can handle the offense well and Saric was one of our most consistent players last yeaer"
"Honestly, I feel like that's an extra weird part for the Suns is that we've had a lot of player change as well.  I thought we were going to come off to a **WAY** slower start, because it takes time to build chemistry and we don't have the usual training camp this year.  * **Starters**    * Returning: Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges\*, Deandre Ayton    * New: Chris Paul, Jae Crowder * **Bench w/ 4+ GP**    * Returning: Cam Johnson,  Jevon Carter, Frank Kaminsky    * New: Langston Galloway, Damian Jones    * In-Between: Cam Payne\*\* * **Bench w/ 3- GP**    * Returning: Saric (2 GP)    * New: Jalen Smith (2 GP), E'Twaun Moore (1 GP), Ty-Shon Alexander (2 GP) * ***Notes***    * *(\*) Mikal noted as he started less than 50% of our games last year despite playing starter minutes*       * *Ayton not noted as the same as his lack of starting was due to Suspension.*    * *(\*\*) Cam Payne noted as in-between since we picked him up before the bubble.  Due to the chemistry we built in the bubble, I initially marked him as 'Returning', but think it's best to give him his own category as he was only with the team during the Bubble.*  Before we ended up grabbing Kaminsky after the Kings cut him, 50% of our roster is new (not including Payne.)  I think that the whole team deserves a fuckload of credit for making it work... Monty and CP3 for obvious reasons, but also the new guys for putting in the work and the returning players for helping bring them up to speed.  All that said, even though we're 5-1, it is clear that we're still trying to get our bearings as a team.  Mikal and Cam Johnson have been absolutely balling their fucking minds out as well as Payne this entire season -- and while their defense will stay, their shots will have to come down to earth, and then it will become more clear where our team is still needing to mesh.  * Mikal Bridges: 15.3 PPG on 53/50/100 Shooting Splits * Cam Johnson: 13.5 PPG on 52/43/100 Shoot Splits * Cam Payne: 8.5 PPG on 51/47/100 Shooting Splits  Where you'll start to see us struggle soon is going to be in comebacks.  The Suns strength is in dictating the pace of the game, and huge shoutout to Monty for this.  We're #30 in Pace, helping us to stay fresh while moving the ball around frequently for open shots.  In contrast, when we start trying to play too quickly, we turn the ball over frequently and get into offensive foul trouble.  It's honestly kind of Grizzlies-esque how they used to play with the Conley/Z-Bo/Gasol core with Tony Allen and various other role players.  Rather than being the 7SOL Suns, we're kind of the Grit &amp; Grind Suns with a 3-ball lol.  The secondary part that you'll see us start to struggle is when the 3 above-mentioned players have their shooting percentages come down to reasonable.  They are good shooters, but those are not sustainable splits... and our Offensive Rebounding Rate is 22nd in the NBA.  **We simply do not crash the offensive glass**, and this **will** hurt us when we start missing."
"Last years Suns squad was not “packed with shooters.” It had two players shoot above league average in Jevon Carter and Cam Johnson, who averaged 16 and 22 minutes. And before that there were an average of like 5 actual NBA players in the Suns rotstion"
"What culture? The fashion and memes? The culture changed when Suns started playing defense in the bubble and actually winning games. If anyone should get credit for the culture change, it's Mikal Bridges, Cam Payne, and Jevon Carter for setting the tone defensively."
"Why do you say our offense isn’t good, we have a pretty damn deep team and a bunch of good shooters, plus ayton hasn’t even had a huge impact and book is not Playing close To His usual level, I think if anything it’s likely our offense is just gonna get better with some more time to Gel. Also our opponent 3p% is not sustainable but the team still looks legit defensively, ayton is a fantastic defensive player and so is bridges, cp3 good, crowder good, cam Payne good, Jevon Carter good and so on, the team has a lot of defensive talent and I see no reason to think the defense won’t be good."
"Those are alright, what pisses me off is when Jae Crowder or Jevon Carter settle for fuckin contested midrange moving shots instead of dumping it down to Ayton."
This makes Jevon Carter the coolest guy there is right?
The play by play guy referred to Jevon carter as Chris paul like 3 times before the other commentator fixed it for him lol
"Book's offense has been struggling hard this year, but his defense has been above average-to-good this season.  Granted, he's getting the easier assignments with CP3/Mikal around him and Jevon Carter coming off the bench, but it's clear that he's all-in for a team game this year.  Honestly, I think it's what I see of a lot of superstars.  When their teams need a supernova offensive player, he gives it to the team and takes away from the defensive effort.  Now that we've got a squad though, he's playing D and not saving 90% of his energy for offense."
Jevon Carter
The play by play guy kept thinking Jevon Carter was Chris Paul lol
Because Jevon Carter is incapable of running an offence. All he can do is shoot.
Why does cam payne play over Jevon Carter?
Still can’t believe the Suns gave up two seconds to trade DeAnthony Melton for Jevon Carter  First time the Wizards have lost at home in forever. Great performance by the Grizz
"Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges are mature young guys, same with Jevon Carter.    I think Anthony Edwards has all the potential in the world, and KAT is an Elite talent.   They are worth keeping.     But everyone else is not good for the Timberwolves, including Malik Beasley.    It doesn't matter how many points you put up, if you character isn't gonna help the team. It would be smart to trade him.    Trade Rubio to the Clippers for Lou Will, T Mann, and Daniel Oturu"
The Melton + Jackson - Carter trade was a great deal by both Memphis and Suns. Jevon Carter is pretty good at the 3 and we got 2 players who hustles a lot (though we let Jackson go for free).
"Dragan Bender is a good example of rushing a stretch big into NBA minutes too soon and it screwing up his development. Suns don't want a repeat of that, so just they're letting Smith focus on his development this year without the pressure of having to contribute.  Didn't also help that when he got into the game for garbage time, his point guard was Jevon Carter, who doesn't really playmake or pass the ball and Smith would just park it on the perimeter."
"Like Booker said a while ago, the roster is so deep that even good players (such as Langston Galloway, Jevon Carter) aren't getting playing time."
It’s crazy how the Suns have a top five defense and Jevon Carter really hasn’t played much this year
Jevon Carter?
Jevon Carter? He was a good shooter in college and was also the leader of the most tenacious defence in the country.
"As a Suns fan who is loving having Chris Paul on his team, I would say that the Suns record from the 2019-2020 season is worse than that team actually was. Injuries/suspensions to Ayton, Baynes, Oubre, Rubio, Booker and others forced Monty to play absolutely terrible bench lineups. I can still vividly remember the 3 pg lineups of: Elie Okobo, Ty Jerome, Jevon Carter, Oubre and Frank. This led to the Suns being worse than the actually were. You may wonder why the Suns played so well in the bubble, well besides major growth from M. Bridges and C. Johnson and the addition of Cam Payne, finally having a completely healthy roster (with the exception of Oubre) allowed this team to play up to its potential.   Also, James Jones had a great offseason - getting rid of Oubre, Okobo, Baynes, and Jerome while adding Crowder, Galloway, Moore, and Nader. Then he added Craig midseason this year and he's been great. The Suns still remain weak in their big man depth (an injury to Ayton or Saric is my number one fear as a Suns fan right now). But the improved depth of this team is tremendous. Everyone on the team belongs on an NBA roster (well, Jalen Smith is TBD there) which is something you couldn't say about most Suns players for the past 5 years.   Point being, while the Chris Paul addition has been big, I think that health and improved depth have been just as consequential, if not more so. In the case of the Suns, it is a massive over simplification to attribute all their improvement to CP3, and it takes away from the work our GM, coaching staff, trainers, and players have put in. I will grant the argument though that without the CP3 trade we don't get Nader, nor do we attract Crowder, Moore, or Galloway.  TLDR: due to multiple injuries at key positions the Suns record last season was worse than the team actually was; thus, using the change in the Suns record from last season to this season as a means for quantifying the impact of Chris Paul on the suns does not paint a completely accurate picture. Improved health and roster depth for the Suns have been just as consequential, if not more so, than the addition of CP3. Without CP3 there is no way this Suns team is a #2 seed in the west, but I believe they'd be sitting in the #5/#6 range if they still had Rubio instead of Paul.   Thank you for reading this rant."
Do CP3 and Jevon Carter usually play together for the Suns? That's gotta be irritating for opposing backcourts
Abdel Nader. Has the tunnel vision of Oubre without the talent to finish at the rim.  Second pick would be Jevon Carter. While he really only plays during blow outs he takes the most ill-advised three’s pretty routinely (he’s a menace on the defensive side tho so he gets a pass).
Ooooooooo boy Jevon Carter definitely won a locker room bet with that dunk. Mediocre dunk but that's why it's a winner.
Thank you for sneaking bulldog Jevon Carter in here
"Better than Élie Okobo, Jevon Carter or Jalen Brunson?"
"It's mostly just the mechanics and physics of the game. In 2K it's like they're gliding or floating on the court. It's very strange and I hated it immediately. I also feel like NBA Live 19 did a way better job mimicking the players movements and form, even down to small fry guys like Jevon Carter. Playing with him, it looks a lot closer to how he moves and shoots than in 2k21.   Also, defense is maddening in 2k21. Even in rookie mode I was having a really hard time stopping the other team from scoring, though I had an easier time scoring as well. I tried on the hardest difficult and it was borderline impossible to keep the score close. I play on the hardest setting in Live 19 and find the challenge of it much more reasonable. Maybe I just really suck but idk, I have no problems beating anyone that comes over and plays against me. I've never played online though."
he was giving us really good minutes at for a decent stretch at the beginning of the year. jevon carter has kind of eaten into his minutes unfortunately. wish we had more for him.
Jevon Carter
1-100: Jevon Carter
"Suns against 76ers...and they win in 6 (remember, we are assuming both the Lakers and Nets don't make the finals, which means we are assuming the Suns probably beat the Lakers en route to the Finals which would be an insane momentum booster for them).   Monty just has too many weapons in his disposal, he can make 3 teams from his roster (those who watch suns games regularly know) , especially his bench who we have seen beat the starters of other teams on numerous occasions on their current 53-18 run from last season's 8-0 run in the bubble!:  Team 1 : Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, DeAndre Ayton  Team 2 : Cameron Payne, Langston Galloway, Cameron Johnson, Torrey Craig, Dario Saric  Team 3 : E'Twaun Moore, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader, Jalen Smith, Frank Kaminsky  The only person among the 15 ppl here who is unproven is the 10th draft pick Jalen Smith who hasn't gotten any burn.   We've seen Team 2 outscore other starting lineups with their 3 pt shooting (3pt percentages = Payne 40.7%, Galloway 45.1%, Johnson 36%, Craig 38.2%, Saric 34.5 %) and defense  And We've seen team team 2 win it as well in pt differential with defense (Carter/Nader) and microwave offense as well (Moore, who's been a 7.9ppg scorer in his CAREER and Kaminsky who had a personal 7-0 run against the clippers just a few days ago).   The Suns haven't been this deep, even dating back to the late 80s and 90s KJ and Barkley teams as well as the SSOL teams. There isn't a drop off whenever the starters leave the court, both on offense and defense. Them sweeping the Jazz and being 27-9 against. 500 and above teams is also a solid indicator of how well they hold up against playoff teams.   I honestly think they have as great a chance as any even if the Lakers were at full strength because of the chemistry and cohesion that hasn't been seen in a Suns team in over a decade worth of basketball... And as u can see, it's not only because Of Chris Paul but because of their really good roster from top to bottom.   Suns will be champions this year, and will win 4 games before losing 4 games against any team in a 7 game SERIES (they haven't lost more than 2 in a row in months... Wc is also testament to Monty and his coaching staff) . GO SUNS!!!"
Yep my suns sub gave me shit for saying Melton is much better than Jevon Carter. Looks like I was right.
"Ranking our bench contributors:  1. Cameron Payne  2. Cameron Johnson  3. Dario Saric  4. Torrey Craig  5. Jevon Carter  Wild cards / unlikely to get playing time in the playoffs, but still threats:  1. Langston Galloway  2. Frank Kaminsky  3. Abdel Nader (if he is even healthy by the playoffs)  Payne is the go-to guy when book / cp3 are off the floor. Even when payne shares time with Book, they are 1A / 1B together. He leads our team in buckets near the end of the shot clock, and we sort of trust him to bail us out when nothing's going in.  Cameron Johnson is a guy who's gonna keep shooting no matter what. He could have 3 points on 1 of 9 and still get hot and make any game into a blowout. He's also an underrated defender, rebounder, and has a nice dribble-drive.   Saric has slumped hard for a few months but before that, he was the best backup big man in the entire league, almost averaging 50/40/90 on double digit scoring and elite defense. Those numbers have angrily regressed to the mean unfortunately, but we're all holding out hope that he progresses back somewhat.  Torrey Craig is one of the most valuable bench pieces regardless of scoring. He is maybe second to Ayton in terms of rebounding, aggressively chasing every defensive and offensive rebound. He's one of the few people on this team who can consistently play above the rim and has a trustworthy shot from 3. We never ask him to create but every now and then he will surprise with an end-of-shotclock midrange that goes in.  Jevon Carter is a guy who we've been trying to figure out his role on the team for a bit. He's usually the guy we sic on opposing guards to harass them for 94 feet but his shot has been solidly improving over the last month and a half or so. We've basically allowed him a green light on catch-and-shoot 3s to try and take out the decision making and it's had pretty solid success. He also has an underrated midrange but we don't ever really want him to take multiple in a game unless we're leading by double digits.  Wild cards:  Langston is instant offense. Second fastest slinger in the west behind Curry. When he's in we basically ask him to run the corners, spot up, and pull if he has 2 inches of space on the 3. Sometimes he gets supernova hot and ends up with double digits in 2-4 minutes of game time. He's a defensive liability unfortunately.  Kaminsky is our NONONOYES guy, but that also makes him our NONONONO guy. Sometimes he plays really, really well and that makes our weakness of relying on Saric less of a weakness. Unfortunately, if he makes 1 3, he'll try to go for another through a stepback.  Nader -- when he played -- was maybe the only guy on the team with a consistent ability to get to the line. He was also a big body who could sometimes hit crucial 3s, but nobody really trusted him over any of the wings. The addition of Torrey Craig has made his niche on the team mostly irrelevant, although it will be nice to see him back if he can recover from his knee arthroscopy before the end of the season (unlikely)."
"I've watched the Suns more than my own team this year and believe me, their bench of Payne, Johnson, Jevon Carter, and Saric are very very good. Even saw Kaminsky throw down a Shaq like dunk against the Clips."
"The speech is my favorite Monty moment, but his reaction after Jevon Carter signed his new contract in November (following incredible hustle in the bubble), is easily second.   https://twitter.com/suns/status/1331033893122699264?s=21  I just love this dude."
I love it. Jevon Carter just needs consistency on the 3
"Team “JM”:  Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Jalen McDaniels, Jaden McDaniels, JaVale McGee  Team “RH”:  R.J. Hampton, Rodney Hood, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Rui Hachimura, Richaun Holmes    Team “JC”: Jevon Carter, Jordan Clarkson, Jarrett Culver, Jae Crowder, John Collins   Team “LD”:  Luka Doncic, Lu Dort, no other players needed."
*happy jevon carter noises*
"""Her favorite players include Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi, Kobe, Devin Booker, ..and Jevon Carter""  Wuh whaat?"
"Ayton, Book, and Craig played well tonight. Book bounced back from a rough stretch and finally made some threes. Craig played pretty decent defense (unfortunately Durant beats decent defense). Ayton allowed himself to get triggered by Blake Griffin which is too bad because outside of that mental lapse he had an excellent game.  CP3 was pretty bad (RIP Ast:TO ratio). Looked a bit sluggish which is unsurprising considering his age and how tough this road trip has been.  It might sound ridiculous but Jevon Carter and Cam lost us the game in the third. We were right with them all game and then they bricked 3s on a bunch of possessions in a row and the Nets did their Nets thing on the other end."
"Disagree. I'll use the Suns as an example. If Monty has a lineup in of Jevon Carter, Cam Payne, Bridges, Crowder, and Saric that's gelling and doing well, it takes a lot of willpower not to bring in CP3 and DBook to continue the charge. It's more of a mental thing than just looking at the scoreboard. Bringing in those two guys could either bolster your team and keep the momentum going or could cause less ball movement since those guys need the ball more."
Jevon Carter wow
It’s disgraceful that Jevon Carter isn’t being mentioned in the MVP conversation
Why is the Sixers commentator acting like Jevon Carter is a bad shooter lol.  He's a top 3 shooter on our team right now

Things probably aren't going well when Jevon Carter is your leading scorer
jevon carter needs to get some sun on that dome
"You'd have to think the \*responsible\* players who would be in the waiver wire zone (i.e. Jevon Carter/Brad Wanamaker) of the NBA wouldn't be trying to live life too lavishly, nor could they reasonably afford to after taxes on their minimum contracts), and if you're an expensive player getting bought out, it's likely just that you were too expensive and someone will sign you on a cheaper contract and you'll continue to make money. Granted some people don't know how to act once they get the bag, but they surely aren't ignorant to the fact that they're at the bottom of the pecking order."
Jevon Carter
"This is barely scratching the surface. CP3 is a big part of the change, but there is a ton more:  1. Monty is a good coach. He gels well with the players and puts them into position to succeed.   2. Ayton missed 25 games last year, then COVID hit. While not as good as this year, we certainly would have been closer without the suspension.   3. Our bench is sooooo much better. Guys whose careers seemed to be over or sluggish (Cam Payne, Saric, Craig, Nader, Jevon Carter) have thrived in our system, have improved, and added to our depth.   4. Player growth (kinda goes along with the last one). Guys who were projects, or young, or who struggled have gotten better. Mikal is having his best year yet, Cam Johnson has come into his own, etc.   5. Injury luck. We haven't had major injury losses yet. Book missed some games, as has CP3, but overall we've been one of the healthiest teams this year.   6. Shooters. Our team can actually (generally) hit 3's. This year we're 7th in the league at 37.9%. Las year we were 16th and 2 years ago, worst in the league at 32.9%.   7. Defense. Ayton has grown to our defensive anchor, Mikal's long arms get in lanes, CP3 is a pest, as is Camp Payne and Jevon Carter. Hell, Book is even having his best year defensively.   A lot has changed for the suns. Other than Book, our roster from 3 years ago has completely changed. In 2018 our starting lineup was Book, Bledsoe, Dragan Bender, Tyson Chandler, and Isiah Canaan. 3 of those guys are now out of the league."
"This is the best Suns defense in 20 years. Personally I think this team has every bit as much potential as any Nash lead team, it's just a much more well rounded team imo. Also those Nash teams had good benches, but this team is way deeper, there's 10+ guys on this team that I feel comfortable with on the floor. Take a guy like Jevon Carter for example, he's barely started to finally see real minutes this year as of late, and he's been doing very well."
"40 wins before 20 losses!   Very gritty win for the Suns, it’s such a surreal feeling watching the Suns grind out wins with their defense and rebounding of all things. The only time I’ve seen a Suns team that’s elite on defense in my lifetime is on NBA2k.  Is Halliburton just going to kill us for the rest of his career for passing on him?   The western conference is such bullshit lol, the Suns have gone 13-2 in their last 15 and haven’t really gained any ground on the 1 seed or created separation from the 3rd seed.   Ayton is going to shock the national media when they see him in the playoffs. He dominated tonight with a huge smile on his face, it looked easy.  I’ve been a pretty big Jevon Carter critic, so I have to give him credit for his sudden overnight transformation into Mike Bibby."
"Suns matchup pretty well. Between CP3, Mikal, Crowder, Ayton, and hell Jevon Carter can be a bulldog, there's some pretty solid versatility.  At the end of the day no one is ""putting the clamps"" on the Nets. I'd say Lakers and Clippers have the best tools/defenders to do it."
Jevon Carter
I did too brother... especially since I’m a WVU fan and Jevon Carter shut him down both times we played them in college.. but turns out I’m a fan now
the jevon carter coming out party has begun
"I don't think Bridges automatically becomes the second option — Ayton is more likely. Booker is first, of course, but the Suns offense is motion-based, with a good handful of weapons, all of whom are solid passers: Bridges, Crowder, Payne, Johnson, Saric even.  My concerns are the backup guards for the Suns: Langston Galloway, E'Tuwan Moore and Jevon Carter. Carter's a great defender with a decent outside shot, but he's not an excellent playmaker. Galloway is a bucket, but his defense isn't spectacular. I don't know Moore well (I rarely paid attention to his minutes, to be honest) but he's not the first guard off the bench for a reason, you know?  It's going to be a hairy few games until CP3 is back. Hopefully the Clips/Jazz series goes to 7."
Enter: Jevon Carter
James Jones turned:  Canaan/Okobo/Melton  Booker/Crawford/Troy Daniels  Warren/Bridges  Ariza/Ryan Anderson/Bender  Ayton/Chandler  Into:  CP3/Payne/Moore  Booker/Jevon Carter/Galloway  Bridges/Cam Johnson/Abdel Nader  Crowder/Craig/Jalen Smith  Ayton/Saric/Kaminsky
"Kevin Huerter, Donte, Wendell, Simons, Shamet, ROBERT WILLIAMS, Mitch rob, Gary Trent jr, Devonte Graham, Brunson, Jevon Carter, Bruce Brown, Melton, Shake, Holiday, Allen and Walker arent busts"
Jevon Carter + Jalen Smith for Luka
"Yeah, you guys legit found something in the bubble and Jones was smart to add to it and keep that same style going with not just CP3 but Jae Crowder as well. He's had his mistakes (giving away T.J. Warren, trading De'Anthony Melton for Jevon Carter, passing on Haliburton for Jalen Smith) but none of them are that egregious and some (Warren giveaway), have helped lead to CP3 being in Phoenix which is more important."
Jevon Carter
"Closing lineup? So, Jevon Carter, Frank Kaminski, E'Twaun Moore, Jalen Smith and Torey Craig?"
"I think they've also got some really good players on the deep bench that will never see the court. Monty decided and said publicly he was done sharing minutes with lots of players so he would stop playing them, but Jevon Carter, Nader, and E'Twaun Moore all looked like really good 2-way players when they got their turns"
Jevon Carter's a thot. he's a freaking nasty hoe. he looks good. i'd love Jevon Carter to bust my pussy open and tell me about the intricacies of the full court press. if a guy shows up with a fucking flat ass and a bald head he can hit my backwalls any fucking time of day dude. if a guy's like 'im the all time wvu steals leader' im like 'take a fucking caterpillar bulldozer to my pussy like its the easton hill intersection dude'

I love Jevon Carter since WVU is my fav college b ball team
"**Top 7 guaranteed protected for the Suns:**  Devin Booker  Chris Paul  Deandre Ayton  Mikal Bridges  Jae Crowder  Cam Johnson  Cam Payne  &amp;#x200B;  **Last protected slot:**  Either Torrey Craig or Dario Saric. Craig is a great spark plug and can hit the three ball well but Dario probably has a higher ceiling with his size, spacing, and passing ability. Saric is rather inconsistent though.  &amp;#x200B;  **So who would get poached:**  Whichever player out of Saric and Craig isn't protected would absolutely get taken.  Jevon Carter (his toughness on defense is great. When he gets in a rhythm/feel for the ball he has a decent shot)  &amp;#x200B;  **Possibly poached but not really rotation guys:**  E'twaun Moore (serviceable veteran backup guard)  Abdel Nader (haven't seen him in a while but we got a lot out of him when he played)  Frank Kaminsky (he's the tank)  &amp;#x200B;  **Unlikely to get poached due to inability to crack the Suns rotation:**  Jalen Smith (he plays a tough bruising style but is very raw)  Ty-Shon Alexander (I have never seen this man)  Langston Galloway (Probably has the highest percentage of and-1 3s out of total fgs made in nba history)"
"Keep: Booker, Ayton, Mikal, Paul, Johnson, Payne, Crowder, Dario.   Dario is debatable. Some people might like Craig, or want to keep Jalen to have some chance at a guy who could blossom.   Craig would get picked up. Someone would take a flyer on Smith most likely. Jevon Carter would be a good presence for a new team as well."
Jevon Carter
"I'm not gay, but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Jevon Carter. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him hitting fadeaways on the driveway hoop and running cone drills shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Daddy Carter. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry and sexually frustrated. Sometimes we will look across the table at dinner and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love"

"Suns bench:  Guards - Cam Payne (can start on any team), Etwan Moore (proven vet) Langston Galloway (Microwave scorer from downtown and proven starter), Jevon Carter (best defender among the guards and capable 3pt shooter), Tyshon Alexander (rookie, 3 pt sniper)  Forwards - Cam Johnson (has been a starter as well), Torrey Craig (Proven Vet and rebounder w a sweet 3pt stroke)  PF/C - Dario Saric (proven stretch big), Frank Kaminsky (also proven stretch big) - both of them are capable passers btw ; Jalen Smith (Rookie but can shoot the 3 and block shots/rebound)  Just looking at the Bench, we can field another starting 5 with Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig and Dario Saric and still be able to defend and outscore another average NBA starting 5, and have capable backups in Galloway, Jevon Carter, and Frank Kaminsky to run vs other 2nd units...that's a DEEP bench right there...  I don't think the hawks have a much better bench TBH, outside of Gallinari, Lou Williams and Huerter... Quite the opposite TBH with the Suns probably having the best Bench composition in the entire league TBH.  The bench has been one of the major strengths of the Suns and will be for years to come . Go SUNS!!!!"
"Ideally CP3 opts out for a multi-year deal at less annually. We use the new space to lock down Payne and maybe Craig. If we can then get a backup 5 behind Ayton at a reasonable price, I think we're set to see what we can do for a few years. At that point our team looks like:  Guards of CP3, Book, Cam Payne, and Jevon Carter on multi year deals  Forwards of Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig, Jalen Smith  Centers of Ayton, the hypothetical backup I talked about and Dario"
Jevon Carter look just like CP3 lmao
Jevon Carter exists
"It’s almost like hitting 41% of your 3s instead of 28% while not getting better looks opens up the offense substantially! I mean it would be one thing if Thibs got Randle much better looks or something, but even Knicks fans recognized that the biggest difference between the regular season and the first round is that Randle just stopped hitting those contested shots that he was hitting all year, the offense didn’t actually improve.   Who improved???? How about Cam Payne going from out of the league to one of the best backups, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Ayton, Cam Johnson, and Jevon Carter? Ayton’s offense didn’t take a step back, he just got less looks because our offense was an incredibly well oiled machine that didn’t rely on him to get shots like we needed out of him the previous two years... thanks to Monty. And then I know it’s tough to gauge defense if you’re not watching a team, but Ayton has gone from a very below average defender his rookie year to our defensive anchor and most important defender... in the two years under Monty.  It’s wild that your argument is that... our players didn’t improve... but we went from the 17th best record to the 2nd best record. Could that be... coaching????? I mean I’m sure you’re going to respond with CP3, despite the fact that the first round clearly, clearly showed that our team’s success isn’t dependent on CP3."
imagine a suns hawks finals and jevon carter locks trae down like he did with Press Virginia
I wouldn't give up Jevon Carter
Cameron Johnson  ❌  Frank Kaminsky ❌  Cameron Payne ❌  Dario Saric ❌  Torrey Craig ❌  Jevon Carter ❌  After those guys I'll consider Kuzma
And what’d he say to Jevon Carter? The horror of it all
IN JEVON CARTER WE TRUST.  CHEERS BEERS MOUNTAINEERS
"I don't want to jinx it, but my boy Jevon Carter going to get minuets tonight!"
We just gunna disrespect jevon carter like that?
Do you guys really believe this team is as successful with a tandem of Cam Payne and Jevon Carter as opposed to Chris Paul?
"The fourth quarter was for the benches to have a little fun. Frank almost tried to finish an alley-oop (he didn’t) and then had a drive to the basket for an and-one. E’Twaun and Langston got some run along with Frank and the Cams. A minute later Jevon Carter got out there too. Langston was so cold from not playing a couple months he missed a pair of wiiiide open threes.  About this time, with 6:51 left in a 32-point lead, a few hundred Suns fans resumed a time-honored tradition of leaving early to beat the traffic and listen to the end of the game on the radio.     Why not stay until the end anwyyas ? As you are there and wait for others to leave"
"I'm not gay, but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Jevon Carter.

Digging the mismatched sneakers on Jevon Carter
If you squint your eyes Jevon Carter becomes CP3
1. Cameron Payne  2. Devin Booker  3. Chris Paul   4. DeAndre Ayton  5. Jae Crowder  6. Mikal Bridges  7. Frank Kaminsky  8. Torrey Craig  9. Dario Saric  10. Jevon Carter
Melton was traded. Suns needed to dump Josh Jackson's salary. They had to give up Melton and a conditional 2nd rounder to us. They got Jevon Carter and 1 other player in return.
did u add in Jevon Carter and leave out Luka Doncic and Trae Young?
Jevon Carter is not a good playmaker. He's better as a shooting guard.
"ayton has been great, booker has played so badly the last 2 games it's clear that there's something not right with him mentally.    the lakers are in his head, at one point they left him totally wide open from the 3 point line and just dared him to shoot.. not even bothering to close out  little things like that are adding up to throw booker off his game, it's his first trip to the playoffs ever and the combination of nerves + LA's tight defense + losing CP3 are wearing on him.  and it all cumulated in shoving shroeder and fouling out at the end of game3  I know the playoffs are not the time when you want to mess with your lineups, you generally know which guys are gonna be in your rotation going in, but the suns have to do something at this point.    Paul can barely move and when he is on the court he can't shoot, can't defend and turns the ball over a lot.   They need Payne to play big minutes and be effective in most of them, they might need to start playing jevon carter, try to generate more looks for torrey craig and bridges  But really the big thing is booker needs to play better... if he's going to mentally check out then the suns wont win.  If his teammates were hitting some 3's that would help him I think because LA couldn't sell out the 3 point line as much to pack the paint"
"Fuck it, Jevon Carter SZN"
There is no answer that is good for the Suns. My guess would be Jevon Carter in when Schroeder is in and LeBron is out. Maybe you let Chris Paul play like 10 minutes but how he is utilized will have to change if he can’t shoot. When Booker is doubled goal has to be getting CP in movement to attack the numbers.
"Eh their whole team is cool besides Jae, Booker, and CP3 ( even tho I like CP3). S/O Jevon Carter"
"I wonder if we'll see other players utilized in Game 3 by the Suns. They have a deep bench of shooters, Torrey Craig, Etuwan Moore, Langston Galloway, and even Jevon Carter can get streaky. If I'm Monty Williams, I'm looking for my bench to step it up on defense against Schroeder when Lebron and AD are out.   For those that are trying to say this series is over without CP3 is maybe forgetting how good these bench players have been. The Suns are deep. And they have the best record in the NBA when they're playing AWAY games."
"I wouldn't rest Paul but I would reduce his minutes and I would give some of the extra minutes to Jevon carter, to shut down Schroder.  They have an extra day between 3 &amp; 4 so Paul will already have extra rest built in. I would play him in game 3, but in limited minutes to anchor specific lineups."
they're letting cameron payne run around and foul like jevon carter on press virginia lol
Man if we’re going off college tactics just trade for Jevon Carter
I like that the two guys with the least hair are 49 y/o Monty Williams and 25 y/o Jevon Carter.
"God I hated the national announcers suggesting that Book assume PG roles with an injured CP3. I am not a Book hater at all and I also admit to putting the NBA on the back burner especially since the Suns haven't been good but.. really?! Book at point? No offense to Book, he is ELITE, but the offense runs better with a real PG. I was hesitant for the Suns to give up Rubio... Suns lose CP3 we're in danger. Don't get wrong I love Cam Payne and I actually think Jevon Carter can evolve (my favorite player on this team) but the Suns NEED a true PG. Book isn't a true PG."
"The saddest moment in a nephew's life isn't when he learns Santa Claus isn't real, it's when he learns Jevon Carter is"
"When Jevon Carter left for college he looked at his father and said ""you're the man of the house now"""
"Jevon Carter was bit by a king cobra. After five days of excruciating pain, the cobra died"
Jevon Carter won too
"That was a loaded draft: Sexton, SGA, Miles Bridges, Mikal Bridges  And then Jevon Carter, Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham ALL in the 2nd round"
"damn people forget about crowder, aytom and bridges defense 😭 they have their secret weapon in jevon carter too"
I WANT JEVON CARTER BIG BUCKETS
Have you seen Jevon Carter? Clearly a clone.
1. Devin Booker  2. Chris Paul  3. Mikal Bridges  4. Jae Crowder  5. Deandre Ayton  6. Cameron Payne  7. Cameron Johnson  8. Dario Saric  9. Torrey Craig  10. Jevon Carter
"Booker, Bridges, Ayton, Cam Johnson, Jevon Carter, and Jalen Smith are currently the 2 seed in the west."
on free agency  etwuan moore  langston galloway  frank kaminsky  abdel nader  torrey craig  tyshon alexander  getting traded  jevon carter  jalen smith  cam johnson  dario saric
"Understandable, we do have Jevon Carter after all"
Booker  Mikal  Ayton  Cam johnson  Cam Payne  Jevon Carter  CP3  Jae crowder or torrey Craig. probably crowder. he would have a higher chance of being drafted but could see both leaving if not protected.
"CP3, Book, Mikal, Jae Crowder, DA, Cameron Johnson, Cameron Payne, Jevon Carter? (8 seems like a tossup tbh)"
"All of the young players made improvements (Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, Jevon Carter, Cam Payne) and the culture of the Suns completely changed. That started last year before CP3. Although CP3 deserves a ton of credit, it's easy to see how Monty has done an amazing job and deserves this award"
"I don't see how he deserves it over Monty. Monty led the Suns from the 10th seed to a game behind the best record in the league.  He completely revitalized the career of Cam Payne, Dario found a new role as a small ball center in Monty's system, we brought Craig over from Milwaukee and he fit in right away. Obviously the CP3 addition helped but most people expected the Suns to be a 6 seed at best.  If someone told you Cam Payne, Dario Saric, Jevon Carter, Cam Johnson, and Frank Kaminsky would lead the best bench in the NBA before this year you wouldn't believe it, but they've all thrived under Monty's system."
"I don't see how he deserves it over Monty. I don't wanna hear bubble talk because everyone always says those games are overrated because almost all of our opponents were missing players.   Monty deserves immense credit for leading the Suns from the 10th seed to a game behind the best record in the league.  He completely revitalized the career of Cam Payne, Dario found a new role as a small ball center in Monty's system, we brought Craig over from Milwaukee and he fit in right away.

"6'1"", bald as a baby's behind Jevon Carter just casually one assist away from a triple-double, and just happening to be leading the Suns in offensive rebounds."
"I was begging for that Jevon Carter triple double. I wanted it so badly. Would have been an awesome birthday present. I guess I'll settle for a hype E'Twaun Moore game winner from three.  Fun game. Stix looked like an actual NBA player, our guys who haven't seen the floor in awhile stepped up, and we won. Now we just have to hope the Kings still observe our SunKings alliance and pull it off tonight against the Jazz. At the very least, Utah is going to have to play their rotation players tonight.  GG San Antonio. Good luck in the play-ins."

That’s what happens when you have future hall of famer Jevon Carter on your team
Jevon Carter
"he should be back but I think the rotation is paper thin outside of ayton and saric bc frank can’t really do nearly as much defensively. The point guard position is also kinda thin if monty isn’t willing to play jevon carter. At 36-37, cp3 should be more likely to miss more time.  That’s why unless jalen smith and tyshon alexander really step up their game (first offseason is most important imo), the suns would do well to make a move if they want to do even better. But I think you are right that that probably means smaller moves, not big ones."
"The Suns have/had 3 of my 4 favorite players in the series and I'm still rooting for the Bucks. Mainly because none of them play lol, Dario, Jevon Carter and Langston Galloway and Jrue is a core player. But I just think the Bucks deserve it more (emphasis on) in my mind. This team has been through it"
who the fuck else would it be than jevon carter
Press Virginia figured that out! I'm upset Jevon Carter doesn't get more play in the league. He's awesome
"As good as a player he is, it seems really difficult to manage our guard rotation. He would have had to come off the bench and share minutes with the Cam's and Torrey Craig. Jevon Carter would probably get no minutes either. I think Jones picked Smith knowing our frontcourt depth is pretty shallow"
"as a wvu fan, i wish it was jevon carter instead"
I’m a WVU grad and you have my guy locked up out there. Jevon Carter. That kid plays harder than any human I’ve ever seen. 100% effort at all times. Hoping you pull it out
"The Suns will:  CP3 either, decline his PO and sign him to a 3 year deal, or accept his PO and sign him to a much smaller 2 year extension. That'll be the end for CP3.  Booker is already signed on for 3 years, no sign he wouldn't further extend.  Ayton has 1 more year on his rookie deal, but I would expect him to sign an extension and not enter free agency. Maybe 5 years 35 Mil per year.  Crowder has 2 more years left, on a MLE deal. I would expect a much smaller pay packet to extend him further than that for another 3 years with bird rights, that gets him to 36 years old. So 5 years total.  Saric, has 2 years on his deal... but this is a real unknown, he's now out next season as backup centre. He is also going to be coming back from major injury so I'll hold off on any further contracts. Suns have applied for a disabled player exception for next season, 4.5mil. I would expect to see the Suns sign JaVale McGee to fill that spot. The one thing the Suns lacked was that one extra ""BIG"".  Bridges has 1 more year on his rookie deal, but I would expect him to sign an extension and not enter free agency. Maybe 5 years 20 Mil per year.  Jalen Smith has 3 years left on his rookie deal, I would expect him to hang around for the duration of that as the 3rd string centre. Depending how he develops will decide whether he stays longer.  Cameron Johnson has 2 years left on his rookie deal, but I would expect him to sign an extension and not enter free agency. Maybe 5 year 15 Mil per year.  Jevon Carter has 2 years left on an early bird, currently not getting time as a 3rd string, maybe that'll Change next year.  Now the unknowns, I see the Suns chucking Payne a 3 year 15mil total deal. Other teams will offer more, but the Suns will be reigning Champions... so what will he decide...  Moore, Galloway, Kaminsky, Craig and Nader will probably get some 1 year minimums.  Ty-Shon will get another 2 way deal next year.  I don't know what the Suns will do with their only draft pick. But it'll be pretty tradeable.   The Suns will basically have the same team for 3 years, maybe changing a couple 3rd string guys adding one more centre like JaVale. Then for the next 3 years still have a core of Booker, Ayton, Bridges, Johnson, Crowder, with unknowns being Starting PG, and some backups."
"Run it back, and try to get some cheap guys in FA. Mainly some center insurance with the future of Saric questionable. I would also think they look for an upgrade at backup SG since E’twaun Moore, Jevon Carter, and Galloway aren’t cutting it. Also, get Ayton extended as soon as possible (and maybe under the max?)."
If Pep was the coach he would overthink it and bench cp3 for Jevon Carter
And Jevon Carter is 25-of-47... hooray for garbage time minutes!
"Nader will take Craig's minutes. And the adjustment at center already happened. Both changes considered, expect more small-man rotations. Here's hoping for a Jevon Carter and/or E'Twaun Moore sighting!"
hopefully we see some jevon carter this game
"Misses by player:  * Ayton, 12 (37 FTA) * Booker, 10 (125 FTA) * Paul, 5 (57 FTA) * Torrey Craig, 3 (9 FTA) * Crowder, 3 (23 FTA) * Bridges, 2 (18 FTA) * Jevon Carter, 2 (2 FTA) * Saric, 1 (14 FTA) * Payne, 1 (16 FTA) * Galloway, 1 (1 FTA)"
"Has he? Guys are shooting about 1.5% worse against him than their averages this playoffs which is the same impact had by Clarkson and worse than guys like Pat Connaughton, Huerter, Powell, Dame, Kaminsky, Rivers, Mann, Payne, Beal, THT, George Hill, Lou Williams, Duncan Robinson, and Korkmaz.  He has a -0.6 dbpm. It’s the worst on the Suns besides for Galloway and Jevon Carter. The only guys besides those 3 who don’t have a positive dbpm are Torrey Craig and Abdel Nader. Of the 91 guys who played enough to qualify for the leaderboard, he’s 66th. He’s tied with Bryn Forbes. Some guys in the negative who are still above him include Trae, Mitchell and Shamet. Dame and Mann are at 0. Some guys with positive ones include Monte Morris, Reggie Jackson, Lou Williams, Huerter, Doncic, Batum, Campazzo, Seth Curry, and Schroeder. He also has fewer defensive win shares per 48 than guys like Duncan Robinson, Cam Payne, CP3, Saric, Kuzma, Shake, Korkmaz, Quickley, George Hill, and Drummond."
JEVON CARTER MIKAL BRIDGES UNPATRIOTIC
Jevon Carter and cash considerations.
1. Chris Paul  2. Cameron Payne  3. Jevon Carter
"Wow, had to Google him. [He looked 35 I'm college. ](https://bluegoldnews.com/west-virginia-mountaineers/wvus-jevon-carter-adds-senior-class-award-to-lengthy-honors-list/)"
"Jevon ""Looks like a 40 year old"" Carter."
Still love Jevon Carter from his days in WVU. That Press Virginia team was fun af.
Jevon Carter
"It's nuts how deep the Suns roster is. They have great flexibility across positions and can withstand missing key contributors if needed. They had 9 players play major minutes this off-season so far: Booker, Ayton, Bridges, Crowder, CP3, Payne, Cam Johnson, Craig, and Saric. And even beyond that, they have guys who could act as a solid stopgaps, with Nader returning halfway through the off-season, E'Twaun Moore, Kaminsky, and Jevon Carter (surprised he didn't get more time). The only real role they don't have redundancy is at center, where Saric (and maybe Crowder) could play small ball 5 but it's better if he doesn't do it for too long. Luckily, Ayton's been healthy and great in the playoffs. Payne has filled in for CP3 decently, Booker's scoring could be covered piecemeal (with drawbacks of course), and they have solid defenders across the board, especially at the wing.  I think this is a big difference between the Suns and Hawks roster construction with say, the Jazz or the Bucks. Bucks sacrificed their depth for Holiday and losing Donte (and now, Giannis) hurt them a disproportionate amount. Losing a role player (or even a star) in this injury-filled playoffs impacts a deep team a lot less, and teams with players on great contracts (both the Suns and Hawks have most of their important players on rookie contracts) can take more blows to their roster. For the Jazz, the top 8 played great but Niang and below couldn't be trusted and there wasn't lineup flexibility (no viable small ball 5, much less playmaking once Conley got hurt, worse scoring by quite a bit if Mitchell sits). Even the Clippers, who lost Ibaka before the playoffs started, Kawhi halfway through, and finally Zubac, played hard and stayed competitive up until they lost too many players because they had a really deep roster, too (and Mann stepped up).  Getting solid performers for cheap also helps a lot. The Suns got Torrey Craig for literally just cash and a TPE. Decent end of bench options are all on mins (or close to it): Payne, Nader, Moore, Galloway, Kaminsky, and Craig. Ayton's still on his rookie contract. Crowder at &lt;$10M/yr is a steal.   For the Hawks, Trae, Hunter, Reddish, Collins, Huerter, and Okongwu are all looking great and on rookie contracts, giving them plenty of cap to sign decent vets  like Gallo, Bogdan, Capela, Lou Will, and Solo. (Also, that's 11 solid options most teams would be happy to have in a playoff rotation, hence why they could weather injuries to Trae, Hunter, Reddish, and Bogdanovic so far.)  For both these teams, they have very few wasted roster spots. The Suns' worst player at the moment is probably Jalen Smith, while the Hawks have Bruno Fernando and Brandon Goodwin. (Heck, Mays and Knight are solid.) Still, they take up very little cap. Goes to show how far prudent cap management can go.   TL;DR: James Jones and Travis Schlenk did a great job with these rosters."
Thankfully Jalen Smith and Jevon Carter did lol
1. Cam Payne  2. Jevon Carter  3. LeBron
Bet they don't even know who Jevon Carter is
Those were the bandwagon Warriors/Lakers fans that were hunting for a championship team. Bet they don't know who Jevon Carter is
Jevon Carter for sure.
"Jevon “the Thot” Carter going to the finals. Let’s gooooooo, MOUNTAINEERS"
JEVON CARTER IS GOING TO THE NBA FINALS
Jevon Carter's a thot. he's a freaking nasty hoe. he looks good. i'd love Jevon Carter to bust my pussy open and tell me about the intricacies of the full court press. if a guy shows up with a fucking flat ass and a bald head he can hit my backwalls any fucking time of day dude. if a guy's like 'im the all time wvu steals leader' im like 'take a fucking caterpillar bulldozer to my pussy like its the easton hill intersection dude
YOOOOO JEVON CARTER
JEVON CARTER TIME????
"solomon hill would probably still win finals mvp with trae healthy, jevon carter clamps that dude up like nobody else can"
"At this rate, Jevon Carter and Solomon Hill will be competing for Finals MVP 🤦‍♂️"
"Great thread idea btw  For the jazz I wouldn't mind taking a chance on Cam Reddish, Jarret Culver, Justise Winslow, Denzel Valentine, Isaac Bonga, Chandler Hutchinson, Kris Dunn, Frank Ntilikina, Dante Exum, Kevin Knox, Derrick Jones Jr. Dwight Powell, Austin Rivers, Furkan Korkmaz, Torrey Craig, Jevon Carter, E'twaun Moore, Brandon Clarke if he's fallen out of favor with memphis. Malik Monk and Daniel Gafford were two at the start of the year but it was nice to see them each get their footing this year.   Taking a chance on two of any of these players would make for a nice offseason for me."
"Alotta people will disagree with that but that's what makes them lovable. They have a ton of strong personalities. I feel like most people would call the Suns lovable but they're just so boring to me. And they have way more players that I actually like, Dario, Jevon Carter, Langston Galloway. There's always something intriguing and interesting with the Clippers. And I fall on the side of liking most of their players too"
Time for Jevon Carter 50 point game
"some random role players like craig and nader, but they need the payne man unless jevon carter happens to get good"
It’s Jevon Carter time
Jevon Carter is CP3 minus the athleticism.
jevon carter cp3 protégé
"Absurd take. Caruso is a pesky defender that can hit an open shot and make a play in transition. He is essentially a taller/longer Jevon Carter. There are plenty of Alex Carusos in the league, but not many guards that can create their own offense, hence the differential in pay."
I could have sworn Jevon Carter was at least 30
Isaac Bonga/Chimezie Metu/Jevon Carter. An unstoppable trio.
"I’m not saying Moore has been good, I’m just saying Moore is playing because he is a better playmaker than Carter and can handle the basketball. If you think Moore is bad you should watch Jevon Carter initiate the offense.   I’m actually leaning towards the side of playing Carter because then at least we get defense but honestly neither is a great option unless Carter can start hitting shots."
Carter can barely handle the basketball under pressure and absolutely cannot pass. If his shot is not falling then he gives you nothing on offense and then all you have is defense. With Booker or Paul off the floor you need to replace their playmaking and Jevon Carter can’t provide that. Cam Payne is really important to this team for that exact reason.
"I trust Monty, but not giving Carter any minutes last game I feel was a mistake. We were very clearly playing low energy basketball, and that phrase doesn't exist in Carter's mind. Nothing else was working, why not see if Jevon can at least light a fire under the team's ass."
Moore has been awful both offensively and defensively. At least Galloway is a sniper offensively.   Jevon Carter should get the minutes though. He's got the shot and his defense is way better than Galloway. Plus he raises the energy level of the whole team
"Langstons a 2, when he’s on he doesn’t miss, but his defense is pretty bad. The more puzzling question is why isn’t Jevon Carter getting those minutes instead of Moore."
"If Kawhi doesn’t come back I still like our chances in probably 6 or 7. If he does come back then idk... him and PG have honestly been huge problems for us all year. I still go down with the ship. Suns in 7. If Kawhi doesn’t come back, I suppose the suns still could lose but, I don’t think they will because they have played well after losses all year and really haven’t shown any reason for me to doubt them. We had the best road and above .500 record this year and have consistently mixed it up and found the guys to get it done. Crowder hasn’t been hitting like he has all season. I still think we see Jevon Carter this series. Saric can do more etc. Clips are good too and they won they game on their merit but I just think this team has the mental makeup to rebound from tonight."
Oh there’s Jevon carter
MOORE IS SO ASS. bring in jevon carter.
"Huge loss, Moore is awful and Jevon Carter can't do anything other than spot up 3s on offense. Paul and Booker needs to play +40 minutes"
Jevon Carter hours
"That's when a great front office will shine...for instance, getting Torrey Craig for Cash Considerations was an awesome move for the Suns to gain depth. The Suns stacked up on their positions to ensure if anybody goes down,they have quality players at EVERY position:  Point guard CP3 Backups - Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Tyshon Alexander  SG - Devin Booker Backups - Langston Galloway, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader,   SF - Mikal Bridges Backups - Cameron Johnson  PF - Jae Crowder Backups - Torrey Craig, Jalen Smith  C - DeAndre Ayton Backups - Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky  You could literally have the first five out of the game and a lineup of Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig and Dario Saric can win you games if needed...and that's all because the front office put this team together with a salary cap in mind. That's what I'm talking about regarding preparing your team to win if injuries do happen to your starters."
Not all nba caliber  Not a superstar  Not even a star  Is he even good at basketball? Did you see Jevon Carter put the clamps on him in Summer League? Bust. Rather build a team around Derrick White or Ben Simmons.  I only read /r/NBA tho.
If it’s suns hawks finals I don’t know how I’m gonna watch it. They’ve both been my favorite teams since adding Jevon Carter and Trae Young. Got to see those players go head to head live back when they were both in college. Been watching them since
Dude if Jevon Carter gets a chip imma lose my mind
"Yes anything is possible, like Jevon Carter getting a 70 point game"
Suns should play Jevon Carter with Chris Paul out and just stick him on Reggie Jackson or whoever
"I like Moore and he absolutely has a role on this team, but I'd like to see Jevon Carter get a shot out there."
Lets see Jevon Carter
"We still have E'twaun Moore, Jevon Carter, and Langston Galloway who are all decent players. Our offense will drop off some with Booker off the floor, but it won't die."
"I’m just gonna point out Jevon Carter and the Phoenix suns. Their team is very deep and dynamic, could see 8-12 different combinations for different circumstances and their court stays under control with a few minutes of bench leadership."
forgetting my boy jevon carter
"Can any Suns fans tell me why Jevon Carter doesn't get much playing time?  Just curious as a WVU fan.  I know he is under sized but I always loved his intensity and his shooting was getting pretty decent.  Sorry if it's a dumb question, maybe he obviously can't hang out there I just haven't watched him since college"
"He’s played far above expectations. Sometimes he gets tunnel vision and plays sloppy, but I trust him. Jevon Carter off the bench is the most worrisome. His defense and spot up shooting is good, he’s just not a great playmaker."
Jevon Carter
"I mean sure, they allowed Tatum to drop fifty in their sole loss in that series.   The highest total they allowed the Bucks to score was 115, and that was the overtime game seven. Bucks led the league in pts/g last season.   They clearly were able to turn up their intensity on that end in the postseason, and now they’ve added a few defensive minded players in the off-season (Deandre Bembry, James Johnson, Jevon Carter). I’d like to see them add another big but ultimately I don’t think it’s going to be a big concern for them."
"We really don’t know if Davion Mitchell is good at all yet, he hasn’t played an NBA game.  He’s an awesome defender, but so is Jevon Carter"
Just thinking about it already triggered me a lol lol Them guys as well as Bruce Brown and Jevon Carter will be the most infuriating defensive duos in the league.
"Harden, Kyrie, Harris, KD, Blake   Beverley, Mills, Brown, J Johnson, Claxton   Carter, Thomas, TLC/Bembry, A Johnson, Jordan/Sharpe  They could literally just have one of Pat Bev or Jevon Carter out there constantly hounding the lead guard for the opposition. That sounds horrible."
"Jevon Carter. I’m telling y’all when he can get to a team where he can really flourish off the bench, later on he can finally become a starter somewhere. He’s with the nets right now and just left the suns, his defense is insane he can be a Kawhi or Jrue Holiday type defender. He’s also a better shooter than most think. That’s just me"
"Right next to Jevon carter, McBride is one of my favorite guys to play for West Virginia, Thibs better give this kid serious minutes. Can’t wait to be in MSG this year rocking my McBride Knicks jersey… this kid is a DAWG. A pure Bobby Huggins press Virginia product."
Jevon Carter is very good.
"Every GM has moves like this, lol. Grizzlies turned Jevon Carter in to Melton and a second."
Bruce Brown? Jevon Carter? Jacque Vaughn? Ime Udoka last season?
the Suns even got Jevon Carter who we just traded there lol
"I don't know if I'd count Blake as a good 3 point shooter. He's fine. Carter as in Jevon Carter? I don't know if he can be considered a ""shooter"" either. If the opposing team wants you to shoot it, you probably can't be considered a threat to shoot"
"Yeah, I assume he’ll have around the same workload Jevon Carter/E’twaun had."
All we did is basically just swap jevon Carter and Saric for Shamet and McGee
"&gt;believe that the draft does not have to be nearly as hard as many teams will make it. I’m not interested in what the mocks say about where a guy should go. Five years will pass and when we look back at this 2018 draft, we’ll see a long line of players who fail to have real careers in the NBA. In the moment, the selections will not seem ludicrous because the mocks have brainwashed us to believe that the best prospects are listed in the correct range and order. So when I hear people say, “That is too high [or too low] to take [Player A],” I immediately cringe. Too high or too low according to what?  &gt;I care about one thing when it comes to the draft: getting a player who does not suck. Some of these guys will be stars, some might end up just being role players, but I am 100 percent confident none of them will fail. Enough with the small talk. Time to put my money where my mouth is. Vernodamus is here to save the day. These players will not suck (and if they do, I will absolutely blame the situation and the coaching):   * **Marvin Bagley III**   &gt;I seriously wonder if I have different eyeballs than everyone else. There is a 0 percent chance that Bagley is not awesome in the NBA. I’m not sure that he has ever played in a game in his life where he was not the best player on the floor. Coach K said the following regarding Bagley: “He is not a good runner; he’s an amazing runner. And then he’s an amazing repeated jumper. In other words, he doesn’t really take time to even land, he just pops right back up. He wants to learn, he has no demons, he’s a great kid, he’s smart, and has an incredible motor. He never has a bad day. He’s a treasure, really. He’s going to be one of the great players in the NBA during his time.” Coach K also said that in his 38 years at Duke he has had only one other player like him: Kyrie Irving. I honestly have no idea how he is not the consensus first pick in the draft.  * **Luka Doncic**  &gt;I have expressed my worry that Doncic might not have the athleticism it takes to be a massive star in the NBA. That being said, he is smart, he plays hard, and he can dribble, pass, and shoot. I’m positive he is not going to be a failure. He is too good at basketball to fail. He also has a massive tiger tattoo on his forearm, which is a big plus. More than anything, I have warmed up to him more and more since the word that NBA teams have cooled on him, because that means he is probably amazing.  * **Wendell Carter Jr.**  &gt;This is a little reminiscent of when Al Horford and Joakim Noah were in the same draft in 2007. I loved both of them and thought there was no chance that either of them would fail. It was just a matter of how good they were going to be. Bagley is the best prospect in the draft in my opinion, but Carter is also a beast. His fundamentals are ridiculous, he is huge and has a massive wingspan — and his shot looks as good as any player’s in the draft. A smart big that can run the floor, plays hard, and can shoot 3s? Those guys don’t fail.  * **Collin Sexton**  &gt;I love Sexton. He is smart, he is lightning fast, and he plays every game like it is his last game on earth. An absolute fighter who routinely plays his best against the best competition. You need guys like Sexton in the NBA playoffs. I think his ceiling is much higher than most people seem to think, and I know, no matter what, I will love having this guy on my team.  * **Miles Bridges**  &gt;He can dribble, pass, and shoot. He is a freak athlete. He is a smart kid that comes off great in all of his interviews. He is tough as nails. You can have the guys that you think are going to be good, and I’ll take the one that I know will be. Miles Bridges is a perfect example of why teams and analysts miss in the NBA draft. He will absolutely be better than many players taken in front of him and you can see it from a mile away.  * **Jacob Evans**  &gt;Cincinnati won a school-record 31 games, and Evans was the best prospect on the team. His sophomore season he was a finalist for the Jerry West Award, which goes to the best shooting guard in the country, and his junior year he was a finalist for the Julius Erving Award, which goes to the best small forward in the country. Cincy coach Mick Cronin had this to say about him: “He is a winner. He shoots a high percentage. He’s an elite defender. He blocks shots. He guards point guards. He rebounds. He just does so many things, and he’s a coach on the floor. He’s such a smart player.” Umm, sold.  * **Donte DiVincenzo**  &gt;At one point during this draft process, someone asked me, “If we saw DiVincenzo drop 31 in the title game, be great all season, and test physically off the charts, then why in the hell is he supposed to go late first round?” Great question, anonymous guy! The answer is because that is where the mock draft consensus has him slotted, and the mock draft consensus is dumb. He’s a big-time competitor, super athlete, can shoot the cover off the ball, and in the biggest game of the season, he looked like the best player on maybe the best college team I have ever seen.  * **Rawle Alkins**  &gt;Brooklyn in the house! Alkins was a high school force of nature who won three city titles and two state championships in New York. He had a foot issue that hampered his career at Arizona, but this kid has so many attributes that I love. Unstoppable motor, built like a linebacker, good-looking shot, and do-or-die playing style. He has been projected too low since this process started. Alkins will be a fan favorite wherever he plays. You want a Marcus Smart, Tony Allen, or P.J. Tucker–type player when you need a big play in a big game. I see that with Alkins.  * **Jevon Carter**  &gt;You do not want to be guarded by Jevon Carter. Bob Huggins called him “the best defensive player I have ever coached.” Whoa. Carter reminds me of the kind of guy who is playing in the park where the winner stays on the court, and you could leave for six hours and come back and his team would still be playing. He was conference defensive player of the year twice, and national defensive player of the year last year. He affects every game that he plays in. Bona fide bulldog. Every roster in the NBA could use a guy like him."
End of the bench player with Jevon Carter gone. Hope we target another wing because as it stands it’s gonna be a whole lot of Cam Johnson right now
What do you mean lol right now the backups are Jevon Carter and Cam Thomas...  A backup playmaker is definitely a need right now.
"Slightly surprised about Mike James, but he and Chiozza are now replaced by Jevon Carter and Cam Thomas, which is probably a net upgrade."
Jevon Carter is better. They still need to find a backup PG
"Bob Huggins saw him in Miami IIRC. He was picking his man up full court and Bob said something like we are getting that kid. This was before Press Virginia. Carter comes to campus and we had Juwan Staten, Gary Browne, Jaysean Paige, Tarik Phillip and Dax Miles. Huggs called Kevin Mackey and said he had all these guards and asked Mackey to show him some of his presses he used at Cleveland State. The first half of the first game was a disaster and created the longest running thread I've ever seen. It was still going on one of the WVU boards 6 years later. Any time someone suggested that the game passed Bob by, the thread would pop to try top. Huggs has this practice punishment. If someone does something stupid, there are treadmills on the side of the court and the player would have jump on one and turn it to the speed. Jevon was said to have really liked them."
Definitely not. A Jevon Carter upgrade I’d say. Plus it helps our cap situation.
Jevon Carter
"I could see it, with the Lakers getting Russ n the nets getting Jevon carter"
"Mountaineer Jevon Carter going to the Nets  Excited for him, he's a good defender. Not a rim protector, so no one will care"
29 tonight and Jevon Carter
It's better this way. Now I don't have to be mad at James Jones for giving up Jevon Carter and Jaden Spring for Shamet.  Not that he would've taken the consensus guy there anyway lol. Probably would've been someone super unexpected again
"They traded for Jevon Carter who is a good defender after giving up Shamet, their bench scorer. This looks to be a Shamet/Dinwiddie replacement."
"They traded for their Defense guy after giving up Shamet, and getting Jevon Carter. These are all bench players for now though. Was hoping to see a trade for a veteran with these picks."
Jevon Carter 2.0
Who's Carter Jevon-Carter?
Carter. Jevon Carter
Jevon Carter
Watching Jevon Carter play defense in college was a thing of beauty.
"Yesterday I read an article that OKC has had talks to trade SGA for Shamet (and other throw-in pieces.)  Today, I read the Suns got Shamet for *Jevon Carter.*  I don't get why anyone pretends like OKC makes good moves, should be rooted for, etc.  Their front office sucks."
"The Suns gave up a first rounder for taller Jevon Carter, you should be happy"
Jevon Carter is a dog.  I hope he makes it in Brooklyn.
Jevon Carter is even worse.
"It’s a pretty fair trade, I’m going to be honest. Jevon Carter has lots of heart though!"
"This must be to set up another move with our picks, we have no reason to get this many rookies  I've always kinda liked Jevon Carter, wouldn't be totally shocked if he contributed more next year than Shamet did this year."
"For context to confused non-Suns fans and maybe some confused Suns fans, Jevon Carter is your quintessential hustle guy, but he’s undersized and didn’t see the floor at all in the playoffs. My guess is James Jones wanted to swap him out for a guy that has at least seen real playoff minutes on top of being a solid shooter"
Nets trade 19 pick for Shamet  Then trade Shamet for 29 pick and Jevon Carter  Is Jevon and 29 pick better than Bey?
But can he be traded for Phoenix for Jevon Carter?
"This draft is stacked in the top 5 or 6 but falls off pretty quickly after that. Most 29th picks don't turn into anything good, while we already know that Shamet is a rotation guy. Sucks to lose Jevon Carter though I like him."
Jevon Carter adds to our defensive needs so I’m not calling it a net loss yet
"jevon carter underrated and late firsts are useful cost-controlled players, good for nets"
Jevon Carter
"Suns need to sub in Jevon Carter, get that WVU full-court press going"
Jevon Carter would lock up Giannis Antetokounmpo.
Cam Payne and Jevon Carter
"This ignores the other side of the trade. In the scenario you've laid out, the team that gets Simmons will have given up less to get him, so will be in a stronger position themselves. So this only works if the team that gets Ben isn't also a contender.  Obviously this won't happen, but just to illustrate, suppose Simmons' value drops enough that he gets traded to the Nets for Jevon Carter. Sure, that benefits anyone who goes up against Philly in the playoffs. But now the Nets are much stronger. They don't need to worry about Ben's offensive deficiencies -- they have enough offense already. And his defensive skills will help."
"So a team with 9 guys that are legit players is bad depth now? And Paul Millsap and James Johnson are solid rotation pieces who are first off the bench guys for many other teams.  I don’t see what teams really have much better benches than that. Then we also have Cam Thomas, of which many believe he will be a great player, Jevon Carter who could probs be a second string PG on a different team, and some solid dudes 13-15. Sure we may lose a game if all three are out, but that happened like once all last year. We also fell into a bit of a hole early without a roster close to as good as it is now. The nets had one of the most crazily fluctuating rosters in the league last season and still were better than the bucks. I don’t see why their depth is so much better than ours."
"“I can name 15-20 PGs who are better defensively than Curry.”  Then why’d you have to bring in shooting guards?  Some of the people you named are legitimately terrible defenders.  Schroeder is a Celtic so now you’re gonna pretend he’s not one of the worst PG defenders in basketball?  Kyrie is terrible and you had some tired homer bullshit about him being “good when he’s locked in”.  I should stop responding now that it’s clear you’re a serious, serious Celtic homer.  But here are some more who aren’t better than Steph on defense, and I’m just kinda surprised at how random your list seemed to recruit bad defenders from strange places, even the bench.  Fox (dude…), Neto, Dinwiddie (seriously, what lol?), Jevon Carter (you don’t get to say a man who comes in for 12 mins a game and guards backups is an elite defender).  Then you have combo guards like Jrue, Caruso, Kris Dunn etc.  only Jrue can really be considered a point here.  Then you have people like Josh Hart, KCP and Marcus Smart who are absolutely not point guards.  You clearly exaggerated and your weird defensive appraisals here are all over the map and often wrong.  You couldn’t name 15-20 PGs who were better even when you got rookies and shooting guards."
damn nice of him to give a shoutout to that dawg ~~Davion Mitchell~~ Jevon Carter
&gt;He said he'd get clamped in the summer league by Jevon Carter.  Do you have that quote?
He just thought Luka wasn't that nice because he dribbled a lot and wasn't an explosive athlete. He said he'd get clamped in the summer league by Jevon Carter. He just thought he was trash and would get exposed in the NBA and a lot of it had to do with not taking Europe seriously. He wasn't alone either.
"This is a list of guards who're all within 2 inches of Steph and clearly better defenders - Kyle Lowry, FVV, Fox, Cory Joseph, Schroder, Delon Wright, Hali, Beverley, Jrue, Smart, Conley, Neto, Rubio, Jevon Carter, Kris Dunn, Dinwiddie, Rozier, Donte, Caruso, KCP, Brogdon, Josh Hart."
"The team without an unproven rookie, Jevon Carter, Dendre Bembry and James Johnson"
"Nets have depth too lol what  Their top 10 guys: Kyrie, Harden, Durant, Joe Harris, Patty Mills, Blake Griffin, LMA, Bruce Brown, Millsap, Claxton.   James Johnson/Jahlil/Jevon Carter at the end of the bench"
"Asking Suns fan perspective... do you think Jevon Carter will get minutes?  Kyrie, Harden and Mills - looks to be a decent rotation at the lead or secondary ball-handler for the Nets. All 3 do not have superior defense which Carter has."
Jevon Carter. Put some respect on our boy's name.
"I can see you have no intention on discussing this in good faith.  The irony about you talking about ignorance . . .  You said: ""Hali would have played maybe 10 min a game. Maybe"" You do realise both Jevon Carter (60 games) and Langston Galloway (40 games) averaged 12 minutes per game for us? More than your suggested minutes for Haliburton, a far superior player. Talk about ignorance and stupidity . . .  As I said. It's not a Payne v Haliburton argument. They would have split minutes at around 15 each. But you are too simple to figure that out haha. We are done here. Yelling at a brick wall is a waste of time"
Your favorite player is Jevon Carter?
"I wanna see Jevon Carter on him. Carter ate him in college, i really doubt it'd be the same result though"
Warriors: Ben Simmons  Blazers: Jevon Carter and a 2nd  Nets: Damian Lillard and Steph Curry
"Lmao damn can you tell me which 7 of Ricky Rubio, DeAndre Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Kelly Oubre, Cameron Payne, Dario Saric, Aaron Baynes, Cameron Johnson, Jevon Carter didn’t belong in the NBA?"
You can replace brunsen with Jevon Carter
We traded that pick for Landry Shamet and then traded Shamet a year later for Jevon Carter. And we are extremely thin at the wing position
"And no other real playmaker. Nash is trying to make Jevon Carter and Patty Mills run the offense, but that shit just isn’t working"
Why the hell is Bruce Brown playing so little? He was great in the playoffs last season. He surely deserves a starting spot more than Jevon Carter.
Jesus Jevon carter and Claxton suck
Jevon Carter played some great hustle defense tonight too. Millsap wasn't bad either.
JEVON CARTER IS THE SAUCE
They didn’t look too good last night.  Milsap and Aldridge looked washed  Joe Harris is a clear liability when he isn’t hot from three  They had guys like Jevon Carter and James Johnson playing rotational minutes
Bruce Brown is gonna be a key part of the rotation anyway. We all know what he's capable of  If you noticed Nash played end of bench guys like Jevon Carter who will likely never see the floor in a playoff setting heavy minutes. He's experimenting with lineups and strategies   Also a big reason Harden was so passive and just forcing lobs to Claxton that obviously didn't work. We all know Harden could have gone out there like Giannis and KD and dropped 30/10 himself but they were trying to get Claxton acclimated to his role as a rim runner and giving him reps to establish chemistry
"I’m surprised Bruce Brown only played four minutes. He’s a switchable defender that doesn’t hurt you too much on offense. Surely he provides more than Jevon Carter or an absolutely cooked LMA. I know it’s just the regular season and Nash may want to just try some different lineups, but it really seems like the Nets gave up on any remotely defense-focused lineups."
There’s gotta be a better option than those Jevon Carter minutes he was asssssssss
"He did the same exact thing in the regular season last year, he was very passive in the regular season and more interested in getting the role players the ball. It’d be a closer game if he didn’t keep spamming those lobs to Claxton that only worked once. Nash also did some funky things, they were kind of feeling out the new roster. Like no way Jevon Carter should’ve played all those minutes."
Is Jevon Carter our new TLC??
behind Jevon Carter in rotation LMAO
May be able to fix playing Jevon Carter 18 minutes though simply by just taking some of those.
Where the fuck was Bruce Brown tonight? Was he injured?  In no world should you be down 20+ points and playing James Johnson/Jevon Carter over Bruce Brown
Going from Kyrie Irving to having to play Jevon Carter 20 minutes… shits rough
Yeah let’s let Jevon Carter air it out 4 seconds into the shotclock down 17 in the 4th
What’s the word on Jevon Carter? I feel like whenever he has the ball he fucks it up somehow.
Jevon Carter is ass lol
Hot take: Nets should be playing Cam Thomas instead of Jevon Carter since they're so cold right now.
"Traded Jevon Carter for him. Jevon wasn’t getting any playing time in the playoffs so they wanted another guard besides cp3, book, &amp; Payne."
"I meant that picking any one player was a thought exercise, since it's not likely any of these guys (or Jevon Carter) are going to be 100% nailed on; rather, the starter/closer will change game-to-game."
"They already tested it out tonight with Jevon Carter, because his shooting has been phenomenal so far this preseason.  It looks like they’ll just add another shooter so the lineup will look something like   Harden - Carter - Harris - KD - Blake/Claxton  But honestly that 2 slot will probably be rotated with different guys depending on the match up and I can see Bruce, Mills, or even Bembry getting the start throughout the season.   If you watched the game tonight they ran some interesting lineups and even ran the ball through Aldridge at times on the second unit for a little bit. Nets are gonna get creative this year for sure."
Option D. Jevon Carter
"Good to have confirmation.  I pretty firmly believe that the Nets will be fine and should still be a top 3 favorite (health with determine a lot of that). Obviously their ceiling is lower without Irving, but with Patty Mills and Cam Thomas, and Jevon Carter, they have some solid PGs. Time will stell, but if you forced me to bet on a title team, I still might bet the Nets."
"Bro stop there is a huge difference between high school sharp shooters and E’Twan Moore, Jevon Carter and Frank Kaminsky.   To say:  &gt; there’s kids in every high school that can shoot like that  Is such poor perspective considering two of those players are NBA guards and the third is Frank Kaminsky is a stretch big who was college player of the year. Jevon Carter was ranked top 5 in his position in high school and even he wasn’t shooting like that considering the fact that he has improved since and he wasn’t practicing at NBA range. There’s no highschool in Utah that has multiple players that can hit “every 3 point shot without missing” at NBA range at the rate remotely close to what these guys do."
Yep that's a good point. And Jevon Carter  was considered a defensive specialist at WVU and coming into the league and even he was splashing.
"I hung around after game 3 of the WCF at Staples this past season and proceeded to watch Kaminsky, Jevon Carter and E'Twan Moore stroll back out to get shots up. All 3 of these guys were automatic from three. They just took turns shooting around the world style from each spot around the arc. Not only did they rarely miss, they didn't even hit the rim. And I realized just how elite NBA players are, even the end of bench guys. I'm gonna try and find a video. It was insane."
traded jevon carter and the 29th pick for him
"Harden/Joe Harris/KD/Blake/LMA  Bench : Patty Mills/Cam Thomas/Bruce Brown/Millsap/Claxton  With James Johnson/Jevon Carter/ Bembry/ Day'Ron Sharpe as end of bench  This team can win a ring 100%, not like they're favorite and are gonna smash teams left and right but on a good run they can"
Jevon Carter looks like Common  That is all
Jevon Carter-Bruce Brown-Sekou-LaMarcus Aldridge-Nicolas Claxton starting lineup lets go
"Bruce Brown, Jevon Carter and Sekou Doumbouya are the highest paid available players"
"Jevon Carter. He's too good, too ferocious, and too hard of a worker to never get run with this Brooklyn team"
"I think he won’t play much but he’s a nice option to have, probably somewhere between 16-18mins if that. I think we will get THT playing up a few positions (up to SF) and Nunn as backup PG/SG most of the time.    I certainly see that rotation as more than capable of dealing with Patty Mills and Jevon Carter for the Nets, Payne for the Suns, Divicienzo for the Bucks, etc."
That’s how Nets fans feel about Jevon Carter lol
"Griffin can stay. Millsap, James Johnson and Jevon Carter can go."
Jevon Carter in Knicks not scoring again
we really had Cam Thomas sitting on the bench earlier this year so we could play Jevon Carter lmfaooo
"Brooklyn [traded Shamet for Jevon Carter and draft rights to Day'Ron Sharpe](https://www.nba.com/suns/suns-acquire-landry-shamet-brooklyn)  They're saying with Harris out and no Kyrie, they wish they kept Shamet who is a shooter"
"Can you imagine Kyrie on his return to the team right before playoffs, especially if Nets retain 1st seed after close contention from Bucks/Heat? If I was one of his nonsuperstar teammates ( Bembry, Jevon Carter, or Cam Thomas) I'd care more about the PT I'm losing to a regular season ghost.  Side note, anyone else genuinely curious what influenced Kyrie so much while growing up?"
It would be coming at the expense of Jevon Carter.. he’s not very good
Lol Jevon Carter?
Jevon Carter forgot he was a Net for a minute and randomly screams with joy after the Suns victory
For the Nets it’s Jevon Carter
Jevon Carter makes me very very angry
TLC in 2nd place and now this year it’s Jevon Carter lol
Probably Jevon Carter
If Jevon carter is hitting 3s it’s over lol
Jevon Carter is shooting 27% from the field this season lol
But is that a result of getting Patty Mills or guys like Deandre Bembry and Jevon Carter?
"Early on, he was. But Joe's picked it up as of late and regardless, Joey is still significantly better than Jevon Carter lmao"
felt like things really turned when Nash finally benched Blake and Jevon Carter
Improved on some ways too. McGee is a legit backup C. And shamet is better than Jevon carter or etwuan Moore. We miss Torrey Craig though :(
"Ur not wrong both are pretty bad. There is times where we have had jevon Carter, bembry, brown on the floor at the same time for multiple stretches I'm just saying"
Don’t speak poorly of Jevon Carter ever again you ninnywagon
Ngl whenever Jevon Carter gets the ball I get irrationally mad because he just takes some stupid shots
"Bruh, we really saw how well Harden could do with just a bunch of shooters and lob threats in Houston and then brought him to Brooklyn just so we can run him out there with DeAndre Bembry, Blake Griffin, Jevon Carter, and Bruce Brown."
"A win is a win is a win.  FYI, before this game, Jevon Carter averaging 26.4% from the field, and 29.7% from the 3."
"Pablo prigioni, Rubio, Jevon Carter"
Our rookies played better than James Johnson and Jevon Carter. I can’t believe they’re still getting minutes.
Jevon Carter is the oldest looking 26 year old I’ve seen since Greg Oden.
Jevon Carter is so bad
Jevon Carter plays with so much energy I miss him 😢
"I really like our bench. They're not elite our anything, but a high effort and solid group. They had a bad night, but they're not a bad group. Our biggest issue is our ball handling depth which shouldn't have been an issue. We planned around having Kyrie and had no backup plans when he dipped last minute. Jevon Carter was not supposed to be in the rotation."
"Patty Mills, Jevon Carter, DeAndre Bembry, Paul Millsap and LaMarcus Aldridge.. pretty bad. Usually LMA is carrying that unit but he was off tonight."
We win the Jevon Carter Memorial Cup
"the super team aspect kind of makes it not fit, but it's hard not to root for nash with the nets. harden is also an arizona state guy, and we traded jevon carter there for shamet who was a fan favorite. they're the east team i can think of the most connections with, but that's mostly one way."
"Fatboy Slim Duo showed up today. Slim Reaper doing slim reaper's thing. I'm literally convinced that not playing 18 monts of organized basketball was good for KD. Ooh and LaMarcusMidrange don't seem he want to cool off. Patty Mills with the 2cnd highest +/- of the team on a cold shooting night, Millsap with the 3rd one. That team is fun, Harden is finding his groove and he's adjusting his game with the new rules. S/o to Jevon Carter too."
Jevon Carter. He’s been getting minutes because we need another bench ball handler/ playmaker.. but he’s been pretty awful. He dribbles the ball for too long and continues to shoot tough shots that he’s not gonna make.
Uh there’s a reason they’re not letting Jevon Carter and friends waste possessions building bricks
Jevon carter
For the Nets it's Jevon Carter. I wince every time he takes a shot. I pray he passes the ball everytime its in his hands. That being said I don't hate watching him. Dude's always putting in 150%. We're pretty fortunate that we don't have anybody that's awful to watch. I like everyone in the rotation. I'd love everyone in the rotation if Kyrie was back (it'd knock Carter out).
"Off the top of my head:  Jrue holiday, thybulle , Jevon Carter, Gary Payton ll, jimmy butler, dejounte Murray, Ben Simmons, dort, Smart, mikal"
Jevon Carter?
"I agree. At this point, I’d rather he plays Cam Thomas instead of Jevon Carter. Jevon is a legit negative on the floor offensively."
The Jevon Carter effect
Jevon Carter is so slow man
DeAndre Bembry and Jevon Carter playing like prime MJ and Pippen.
Counting down the days till I never have to watch Jevon Carter play meaningful basketball
Whys jevon carter getting so many minutes? Like why.
