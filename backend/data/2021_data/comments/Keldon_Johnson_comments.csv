I’m glad you all got keldon Johnson out of that trade
"People in the Spurs sub talk about floors the same way.   1. ""Oh Keldon Johnson has a 3x allstar floor""  2. That's not what floor means  /1. ""It's like his best case scenario floor. His ceiling is Dwyane Wade"""
one Keldon Johnson pls
I'm sorry who? The guy we traded for Keldon Johnson? Was he even any good I can't remember
"little selfish, but demar derozan, LaMarcus Aldridge, Keldon Johnson, dame, chris Paul"
Keldon Johnson is a nice young player but top ten player? thats very optimistic
"Keldon Johnson is a nice piece, and I always felt Poeltl was the most valuable piece we gave up in the trade, but no. The 29th pick has the value of a 29th pick when evaluating this trade. Kudos to the Spurs for doing well with it."
"They didn't win it but people overreact on that trade so hard  Kawhi tanked his value, wasn't even showing up and Toronto got lucky with injuries to the Warriors, they gambled and won the gamble which was great for them   Spurs got good haul out of someone that was expiring and only wanted to go to LA, they got a pick that is Keldon Johnson who has been so good, Poetl is good and DeRozan somehow has become efficient and a much better playmaker"

"Losing vassell and a potential lottery pick so we can add Vucevic to a team that has no guarantee of making the playoffs is a complete waste of assets. This team is going in the direction of the DJM, Keldon Johnson, Lonnie Walker timeline. Not the DeMar DeRozan, Rudy Gay timeline. That trade does nothing for us"

Keldon Johnson can hoop! Going to have to keep an eye out on him from now on.
If he works really hard someday he can be like Keldon Johnson
"Kyle Pitts, superstar athlete coming into college football this year isnt super huge necessarily for his position but he's like the same size as Keldon Johnson. 6'4"" ish and 230ish. you compare that to Zion who's like two inches taller and fifty or more pounds heavier. lol zions built like some defensive tackles. boban is almost a foot taller and probably 40 or so pounds heavier than Kyle Pitts. jimmy graham was tall as shit for the nfl and he was 6'7""  265.  anyone who thinks LeBron doesn't weigh more than Jimmy Graham just because his listed weight is lower is out of their minds."
You gotta love Keldon Johnson then. Kid’s a dog
"Sounds like he's bought into that part of Pop's philosophy. Stay humble, be a good teammate, make smart plays and you'll rise to the top with the others.  It's sadly why Saminic is stuck in the G league, and Keldon Johnson has seen starting time, despite us picking Saminic before Keldon."
"Sell Tucker, Lowry, Nurkic  Buy Keldon Johnson Deandre Hunter"
"This is excellent. He'll re-find his love for the game. His confidence is rotting watching younger players usurp his minutes with less talent. He knows it's about the work now. He's learned professional lessons. He took it too personally when Luka stole his team away as a doughy white guy. Then got boo'd by new york's own fans on home court after the trade. He's gonna be back - look at Trey Burke, Chris Boucher, Norm Powell, Van Vleet, Keldon Johnson, Christian Wood. Jerami Grant. at least 40% of the NBA is situation &amp; time."
Give me Keldon Johnson easily
I think this is all a bunch of words to express his undying love for Keldon Johnson. Who is a beast.
But would you rather have Zion or Keldon Johnson?
Keldon Johnson
"It's Keldon Johnson.   You're going to get a bunch of people saying Murray/DeRozan/Rudy/LMA whoever, but its Keldon Johnson. That's the reason they are good this year compared to last year.  Reminds me a lot of when the Spurs got Kawhi and people just thought it was the old guard making another run in 13/14. Like, nope, the Spurs just constantly acquire talented players and develop their weaknesses."
"Keldon ""My LEG"" Johnson"
Good job on Keldon Johnson Spurs. I say this now before I start to dislike him after a few seasons of roasting us on the offensive glass over and over. I'm very impressed.
[But whoever runs the spurs reddit twitter account would rather have Keldon Johnson](https://twitter.com/redditspurs/status/1355259007490007043)
Imagine passing on Keldon Johnson because he has a short neck
Keldon “Big Body” Johnson.  Will also accept: Honey badger  Mustang
Doncic went from not even an all star to top 5 mvp candidate.  Keldon Johnson has gone from not playing much as a rookie to a fine starting wing  You tell me which improvement is more meaningful
"Jerami Grant last season averaged 12ppg off the bench for the Nuggets, he shot 38% from 3 on 3.5 attempts a game  Jerami Grant this season is averaging 24ppg, and shooting 40% from 3 currently on almost double the volume. Dude has become a legit 1st option out of nowhere  Christian Wood went from 13ppg to a 23/10 double-double machine.  Keldon Johnson is great, but he's only gone from 9ppg to 14ppg. I don't see how he has a strong case for MIP over Grant or Wood."
Keldon Johnson 2020-2021  The guy deserves it
Wood game just left off how it finished in his final 20 games  Look up the stats  Same with Grant  Btw these guys are also putting up way more shots. Grant efficiency at the 3 is not great  Keldon Johnson is doing his thing very efficiently
How is Grant a MIP candidates?  He makes loads of cash. And he had a strong season last season  Keldon Johnson stats is drastic from year 1 to year 2
He’s no Keldon Johnson

Thank you for Keldon Johnson.
"There was an article that said the Spurs won the Kawhi/Demar trade, even though the Raps won a ring. Because Kawhi left,  but the Spurs still have Demar, Poetl and the 29th pick which became Keldon Johnson.  KJ looks so far to be the steal of last years draft, and if redone, would go top 10 easily."
"Demar's been in all star form in each season with Spurs, its jus now the players around him are better, he doesn't have to over exert himself tryna carry, gets more assists.  Aldridge is still an incredible shooter, has done good to hit more 3s, but is atrocious on d. Poetle is exceptional on d but terrible at shooting. Centre is our weakest position and typically we lose to teams with good big men.  Keldon Johnson and Dejounte Murray have both been incredible, could both be in the convo for MIP. Vassell looks great but still gets less minutes being a rookie. That said wouldn' be surprised if he takes more minutes from Lonnie Walker once our star pg Derrick White is healthy.  Patty FIBA Mills. Patty fucking Mills. Is a solid candidate for 6th man of the year. Been playing out his skin this year.  So yeah peeps might stop sleepin on us soon. There's weaknesses to the team, youth can be inconsistent, but they play with so much heart. So much fun to watch."
Keldon Johnson is a rebounding machine
Keldon Johnson
wtf I love Keldon Johnson now
Big Body Honey Badger Mustang Keldon Johnson.
keldon johnson
"$SPURS TO THE MOON BABY!!!! 🚀🚀🚀  but honestly as a san antonian, the spurs are sneaky good this year. Demar has been clutch and BIG BODY KELDON JOHNSON is having a hell of a season. The baby spurs are a lot further in their development and Derrick white comes back tomorrow, who before the season started was definitely my pick for the biggest breakthrough!"
"Dejounte Murray is having a breakout season, DeMar playing at an All Star level, Keldon Johnson looks like the steal of his draft class as a sophomore, Vasell and Poeltl provide the defense we need and LMA and Rudy, tho inconsistent, have been important for us too"
"Man I love our young guns, how on earth did Keldon Johnson fall to us at 29? He's so good at finishing through contact."
"Spurs is still waiting to see what they have in Samanic. Apparently, R.C.Burford was really high in him (drafted before Keldon Johnson). The kid is still young, so we will see."
keldon is who stanley johnson was meant to be
I think I love Keldon Johnson
"Now I know that Zion is no Keldon Johnson, but I think he played pretty well tonight!"
Had never heard of keldon johnson before we played you guys. All I had to see is that one game and I'm convinced hes gonna be a really good player. He brings so much energy and physicality
"I feel like people are high on Keldon Johnson, the Spurs just aren't making enough noise for him to be talked about with regularity."
"Keldon Johnson and Devin Vassell are amazing. if not my team, I expected to hate reddish but honestly he's gonna be that dude in a few years."
"There's no way you can compare the spurs to the wizards lol. The spurs have dejounte Murray, derozan, Aldridge, keldon johnson, two good veterans in patty mills and rudy gay, as well as promising young talent in Lonnie walker and derrick white. The spurs roster is WAY better than the wizards."
Last time I checked Keldon Johnson plays for us
"i was just gonna say he forgot to include the rich mans charles barkley, Keldon Johnson, too. crazy list, right?"
"Spurs fans, could one of you give me a quick summary of the games of each of the three guards, Dejounte, Derrick, and Lonnie? Seems like they're all improving rapidly and looking to be a part of the future of this team but I just haven't seen enough Spurs games to remember which one specializes in which aspects (although hoping to change that now!) Derrick is the best defender of the 3 right? Also I hope it's not too late to get on the Keldon Johnson bandwagon, he's so good"
They could have 5 Keldon Johnsons and I’d still be asking for more of Keldon’s Johnson
"That’s not really how it went. We subbed everyone out except Jayson (which we should always keep two of our guys in, but that’s another topic) and they started that big run. By the time Jaylen, Marcus, and Kemba came in, and Jayson out yeah it was a 7 point lead but the Spurs were hot, Keldon Johnson was getting every offensive rebound, and Jaylen missed some shots. It was a run that had already started that just kept going."
based off the boxscore youd think derozan pulled the victory for them (and he did make the clutch shot) but keldon johnson was the real mvp.  just great scoring at huge momentum moments.  he made something out of nothing so many times off of 50/50 balls and offensive rebounds.  he led runs.
That Keldon Johnson crossover jam lives rent free in my mind.
Thank you Danny Ainge for passing on Keldon Johnson 3 times in the draft we really appreciate it
Keldon Johnson
Keldon Johnson.
Keldon Johnson is massive. He looks 230+.
I'm here to simp for Keldon Johnson
"Borrego is Pop tree, they all do this to their rookies  Keldon Johnson barely played last season for the Spurs and now he starts and gets over 30 mins, same with for example Bud doing it to DiVincenzo in his rookie year and now he is a starter, DeJounte Murray, Lonnie Walker all had to go through this as well  It's questionable i guess but that's how they operate, they want rookies to be eased in rather than fully play all the minutes even when bad"
"Oh dear lord spare me the debate bro talk   We traded for a pick- the pick turned out to be a new franchise building block. Of course it was unlikely to turn into Keldon as we know him now when we traded, but you can’t discuss the return without acknowledging who the pick ended up being.  It was a limited market with few suitors willing to give up anything for a guy actively saying he would go to LA the following year. Like I said, for better or for worse, Pop didn’t want to capitulate to those demands and made the best deal they could within that set of circumstances. Keldon Johnson being part of that return makes it easy to swallow.   Does that cover it?"
"If y’all really there happy that you got derozan and Keldon Johnson instead of Hart, Lonzo, Ingram, and the 4th pick y’all bonkers  Spurs could have a top core rn if they weren’t petty imo"
"Keldon Johnson. People have no clue who he is until they play us, he's essentially our mini Jimmy Buckets"
Keldon Johnson looks like an absolute monster
Referees hate Keldon Johnson
"spurs fans, can keldon johnson shoot? im not trying to sound disrespectful it just seems like all his baskets are inside"
"Well, technically I'm exaggerating.  The first guy is getting screened off really effectively because he's going over the screen, because that's what you do with Steph.  2nd defender is the guy who had the screener, but is now switched on to Steph.  He bites on the pumpfake and is slow-footed.  Steph does this to many people, but so do a lot of other guards in the NBA.  The guy that really makes it look comical is #3, Keldon Johnson. He attempts to help from an angle that does nothing to cut off steph's options, only half-commits which would have left his man open, AND bites on the same pumpfake to take himself out of the play.    Johnson being scared enough of Steph's shooting to move out of position and do something he's almost surely not coached to do is the power of Steph's gravity.  Even if Johnson had played it better and stayed on his feet, Steph could have passed it off to the streaking cutter that guy has now left wide open."
That whole opening sequence with Keldon Johnson missing 19 shots and the Spurs picking up 4 and-1's was pretty soul crushing
and Keldon Johnson
"Man, Warriors could’ve had Keldon Johnson over Jordan Poole..."
Keldon Johnson is going for 40.
"I'm not trying to hijack this or anything but we see it all the time and its always such bullshit that refs ref differently. It really feels like they ref based off reputation and until you establish yourself as a defender/driver they will not give you calls.    Maxey, Keldon Johnson, and Edwards are just some from this season that have gotten robbed of quite a bit of production"
"Daniel Theis starts for us at center. Poeltl can at least be that level of player. He's competent defensively which is what's most important from that position. You shouldn't close games with him at center, but he's perfectly fine playing 23-25 MPG.   The most interesting lineup I'd like to see is if in the future Keldon can become a small-ball 5 defensively ala somebody like PJ Tucker. That way you could play your 5 best players together which would be Murray/White/Walker/Vassell/Johnson. And before you say that's nuts, that's way too small, remember that the 2018 Rockets closing 5 was CP3/Harden/Gordon/Ariza/Tucker and they switched everything."
"They have 4 intriguing young players + White and Poeltl who look like solid role players.   Dejounte Murray - Primary Ball Handler, Point of Attack  Lonnie Walker - Secondary Ball Handler, Helper  Devin Vassell - Stationary Shooter, Wing Stopper  Keldon Johnson - Athletic Finisher, Helper  Jakob Poeltl - Roll + Cut Big, Anchor Big  Derrick White - Primary Ball Handler, Point of Attack  Murray, Vassell, Johnson, and Poeltl look like surefire starters. The question then becomes between Lonnie Walker or Derrick White as a starter and whether you want to use Walker off the bench as a bucket gettor like Tim Hardaway has been at times or Will Barton is for the Nuggets, or you want to use Derrick White off the bench to run your offense like Marcus Smart does for the Celtics.   Johnson is intriguing from the standpoint that he might be able to play some small-ball 5 in the future with how strong he is ala a PJ Tucker. Poeltl is really good for a center, but drop coverage becomes untenable in the playoffs, and you have to be able to switch 1-5. That's why it's not crazy that in the future they could close with Murray-White-Walker-Vassell-Johnson."
"this is a really nice article detailing why were so high on our young guys. Keldon Johnson number one in blowby %, plus 2.5 minutes of KJ assaulting the rim embedded in the article. lonnie walker shooting his ass off. DeJounte Murray being an actual efficient point guard. i love it."
you dont wanna know about big body keldon johnson down in san antonio. that guy is like 6'5 and our starting pf. he doesnt give a fuck how big the guy hes guarding is. he just goes straight at them.
Keldon Johnson has been really good.
"He reminds me a lot of Keldon Johnson. Relentless aggression, can shoot it from anywhere, plays bigger than his actual size"
"Okay fair position based on your logic. I was just confused on what point Keldon Johnson may add wins for the Spurs, because the same stat you use has contradicted that logic so far. DeMar has levelled off but Keldon isn’t changing much"
"Yes the Raptors won a title. Doesn't make my point of ""paying a price on a trade"" a mute point. At some point the price needs to be paid, Raptors are paying it now. Nets paid their price several years ago (Tatum and Brown). And they will pay a price later on for Harden. I guess it matters to people how many picks/players a title is worth, and what kind of a rebuild is acceptable for a title.  Well Raptors had the 2nd best record in the league when DeRozan was on the team, so they might have been able to win a title. Siakam made his step forward the year they won it, so maybe that would have been enough to put them over the top. They would be a better team right now with DeRozan and Pöltl and Keldon Johnson on the team."
Keldon Johnson has the 3rd worst on off in the league. Your logic isn’t consistent at all. Tony Parker also had a negative on off for 7 seasons
"Your logic doesn’t add up here with your other posts. Keldon Johnson has the worst on/off rating on the team and the 3rd worst in the league. If you’re arguing that the team is better with Keldon Johnson (which I agree with), how can you argue the Spurs are a worse team when DeMar is on the floor using on/off stats. Because according to your logic, the team is worse with a player if they have a negative on off statistic, by which Johnson has the 3rd worse in the league. The stat is flawed for reasons many have already argued"
"You are greatly exaggerating both the length of time the bench was great, as well as how good. This entire narrative was born from one really dominating year where Kyle plus bench was dominating. Otherwise Kyle's on/off would not always be the on/off standout he has been. It is both illogical, and mathematically impossible to blame it on bench play when they manage to end up at opposite ends of the on/off spectrum so frequently despite sharing the vast majority of their minutes on the court together.  Sooner or later, you will have to confront the reality that the bottom line was when Demar was off the court, the team was pretty much better. And it didn't matter much who the 5 on were.   And it's been exactly the same in San Antonio. People say he played his best ball last year - and the Spurs were bad. This year they look better because improved play by Murray and Keldon Johnson, that's the difference that may actually add wins for SA this year."
"They’ve fallen off a bit but I still think the Spurs are up there with those other teams when it comes to player development. Keldon Johnson, Dejounte Murray &amp; Derrick White developing like they have as the 29th picks of their respective drafts is nice."
"actually, i'm surprised at how many people actually recognize how good Keldon Johnson is (which is mostly due to fantasy basketball)."
No one watches or cares about the spurs and it’s obvious but why feel it necessary to talk like you do   Just sit it out and find another thread to comment in  It’s all “fuck kawhi for fucking over the spurs” until you talk about the trade package and all of a sudden it’s “lol how come they couldn’t get a better deal” and then when you finally catch a game it’s “who the fuck is Keldon Johnson”
"So, Derozan, Poeltl, and Keldon Johnson (the pick from Toronto) is nothing? I disagree. Especially about Keldon."
Best thing about Keldon Johnson 3's is the chance for a quick bathroom break
"""So based on the fact that only Malik Monk and James Young are really the only busts on this list the way Keldon Johnson, Tyrese Maxey and Immanuel Quickley are playing you pretty much have a 12/14 chance of drafting a high level rotation player or better you draft a Kentucky guard I have figured out.""   Yup. Thats how statistics work."
No one talking about Keldon Johnson? Put some respect on his name!
"Derrick White, Keldon Johnson"
Big Keldon Johnson fan after how he played in the bubble last year
The boy keldon Johnson 😤😤😤
"Last year was the rebuild, Spurs making the playoffs for the next 20 years behind keldon johnson"
"I hear you, stronger core. Spurs have nowhere near that strong a core.  But the Spurs won't likely won't mess with Dejounte/Derrick White/Jakob/Keldon Johnson/Vassell, who are their current building blocks.  They'd likely give up ""meh"" picks and a guy like Lonnie Walker, who is a high upside player that seems to be near his ceiling with San Antonio."
It's probably going to have to require giving up at least 2 of the following:  Devin Vassell  Keldon Johnson   Derrick White  DeJounte Murray   This years pick. Whether it would require more draft capital would depend on which of these players   The fit is pristine though.
Grant makes no sense to me. He left Denver so he could lead a team and he’s going to go to a team that has Tatum and Brown clearly in front of him? I’d love to get Thad Young instead or maybe even trade for Bazley (might be cheap trade?) or Keldon Johnson (I doubt Pop trades him though)
"We recently been without Keldon Johnson (recently came back last game), Derrick White, Rudy Gay and Devin Vassell. All were getting decent to big mins. Luka Samanic has stepped up and contribute as of late which is nice to see. Can't wait to get the whole squad back and healthy."
Yeah pretty badly actually. Spurs have played like 4 less games than most teams because of COVID and derrick white has essentially missed the whole season. Then Derrick white comes back and is out two weeks for Covid regulations along with Keldon Johnson.
We don’t talk about Keldon Johnson on other teams I’m sorry that’s a war crime.
"Yep, played our last 4 games without Derrick White, Rudy Gay, Vassell, Keldon Johnson missed 3 and LMA and DeMar have also missed a game each. We're 2-2 in that span"
"Obviously when you have Pop as head coach, also last year they fought for the PO. I think they will end up in the play in and the Nuggets will move to top 6 instead. It is still remarkable what they have done so far. Huge merits to Derozan who has rejuvenated this year playing one of his best basketball of all time.  Also Keldon Johnson is finding his spot and he is showing off his skills and I won't be surprised if he end up been considered the steal of his draft in a couple of years."
Spurs are legit and they've got some great talent out there. I've got Murray as the best defensive PG in the league. There's so much unnoticed stuff he does to hustle out the ball. I really like Keldon Johnson and I think he's an up and coming player that doesn't get talked about enough. Secretly I'd like to see him on the Nuggets. DeMar has been tremendous and I'm glad to see him ball out.
"He's not terrible on defense, a little below average. Keldon Johnson and Lonnie Walker have both been significantly worse than him defensively and the spurs are still an above average defensive team."
It’s mainly due to Dejounte stepping up and the introduction of Keldon Johnson. Demar too of course but yes DJ has been consistent all season
I mean Keldon Johnson follows his shot a ton. Also the two main scorers on the Sours are fade away specialists. Hard to follow your shot on a fade.
"Bro, you're tied with the Spurs! LOL! Aldridge has missed a 3rd of the season and they're staring Dejounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, and Lonnie Walker! You're tied with a team that has a NEGATIVE SRS. LOL!  The Nuggets have a +5 SRS, and are underperforming their point differential by THREE GAMES! Don't be mad at me, be mad at your favorite team. LOL! TWO of your last 3 losses are to the Washington Wizards, LOL!"
"Team USA would’ve been the most entertaining rising stars team ever if they had the game. Lamelo, ja, Zion, edwards, and wiseman on the same team would’ve been lob city, plus really good players in haliburton, herro, mpj, keldon Johnson, and hunter"
"Exactly. Spurs and Denver have the best development program in the league. If Keldon Johnson or Murray landed with another team I don't think they'd be as successful. I would have loved to see Haliburton fall to the spurs, I think Pops and co. would have turned him into a hall of famer."
"Keldon's the one I was talking about. I don't really think its close who is going to be the better player. Keldon's still working into his own, but he's got it all.  Dejounte's a great player and I dont mean it as a slight to him. I get Spurs games on local TV so Im just very aware of how good Keldon Johnson is."
"As a corollary, the return the Spurs got for Kawhi leonard of Demar Derozan, Jakob Poeltl, and Keldon Johnson looks horrible by comparison even if it looks better than it did at the time of the trade."
"We're missing Keldon Johnson, Derrick White, Rudy Gay, and Devin Vassell. We've been having to play Trey Lyles, Luka Samanic, and Keita Bates-Diop significant minutes and they normally don't play."
"Kentucky  PG: Jamal Murray, De’Aaron Fox, John Wall  SG: SGA, Tyler Herro, Malik Monk  SF: Devin Booker and Keldon Johnson  PF: Anthony Davis and Julius Randle  C: Towns, Bam Adebayo, Enes Kanter  There’s also Eric Bledsoe, Nerlens Noel and DeMarcus Cousins if he can get back to at least a portion of what he was."
"Why are people saying Spurs? Their past 5 picks have been good, not great. Vassell, Keldon Johnson, Lonnie Walker, Dejounte Murray, Kyle Anderson, who else am I missing? None of these guys are really *great*. The answer here is quite easily Denver."
🗣If Keldon Johnson is not an NBA Rising Star this year I will kill my self on live TV.
"I just don't see how you could ever say he would *clearly* be the best player on the team when there's not much special about his game.   Especially when we have DeMar DeRozan that's still a walking bucket and should've been an All Star, Dejounte Murray whose still lockup on defense and finally a consistent offensive option, Keldon Johnson who is just an absolute monster, Derrick White, another extremely solid player on both ends and our best passer. Devin Vassell is a rookie and I think he has a bigger impact on both ends than Poetl.   Like yeah these advanced stats make him seem like he's top tier defensively but the eye test of watching him for the past 3 seasons doesn't really impress me."
"I felt like Zion had a really weird path in the NBA in dancing the line b/t overrated and underrated.  He came in and people were salivating over him and yelling chants like ""WE WANT ZION!!!!"" at him, saying he could single-handedly rescue a bunch of franchises then he had his torn menisiscus and folks clamored over to call him fat and ""not as good as Ja!""  He became 'underrated' enough that Spurs fans said, ""Who needs Zion? We have Keldon Johnson,"" NYK fans said, ""RJ and (26 yr old) Julius Randle are BETTER!"" (so did The Ringer) and Paschall and a bunch of others were all said to be ""Just as good as Zion!""  ""HE JUST STANDS IN THE PAINT"" became another take. And then recently a bad news clip circulated of a sports pundit trying to call him a selfish/stats-only player.  He gets a LOT of hate, and also a lot of PR push at the same time."
"If I had to redraft the top 10 it would actually be pretty close to the initial selections:  1. Zion Williamson (#1) 2. Ja Morant (#2) 3. RJ Barrett (#3) 4. DeAndre Hunter (#4) 5. Coby White (#7) 6. Rui Hachimura (#9) 7. Tyler Herro (#13) 8. Matisse Thybulle (#20) 8. Lugentz Dort (undrafted) 9. Keldon Johnson (#29)   Other players that outperformed their picks include Brandon Clarke (#21), Grant Williams (#22) and Kendrick Nunn (undrafted).  Players that dropped out of my top 10: Darius Garland, Jaxson Hayes, Cam Reddish, but all of them would probably be in the 11-20 range"
"I hope he pans out for us as the eventual backup pg, but man I just think about us passing up on Keldon Johnson"
"I think you're underplaying other team's reliance on a few guys while overplaying the Celtics.  The Blazers only have two ballhandlers. That's pretty much it. Dame and CJ. Everyone else are just shooters or defenders or post scorers.  &gt; The Raptors just full stop have a creation problem  Lol definitely agree there  &gt; Spurs have multiple ball handlers and guards.  Guards and ball handlers sure. But who's creating for the Spurs? Keldon Johnson? For the majority of the season on the majority of plays it's just Murray and DeRozan.  &gt; Clippers still have Lou William's  Who's been pretty bad this year and even at his best was only ever a decent passer.  &gt;  the Bucks have 3 creators + other guards that can get to a shot   ... Who? Jrue has missed most of the year. The offense has just been Giannis and Middleton. Every single other player is just 3&amp;D.  &gt; Sixers have multiple ball handlers and scorers  No they don't. Shake Miltonis their third best ball handler/scorer and he's mediocre at best.  &gt; The Celtics have a broken Kemba  Who, imo, is at worst comparable to Milton/Lou/Keldon. Celtics also had Smart before he went down who's a decent creator and also comparable to the guys I just mentioned.  Yes, I 100% agree that outside of Brown and Tatum their ability to create goes down significantly, and outside of Kemba and Smart as well no one else on their team can create at all. And I'm saying that's pretty much true for a lot of teams."
"Pretty damn well before COVID. DeMar is playing like an All Star, Dejounte is a good shout for MIP, Keldon Johnson looks like the truth, Vasell is as good as advertised, Patty would be in the 6MOTY if it wasn't for Clarkson, White took a bit to get going after the injury but found his footing lately and Jak looks like our starting center of the future. Super excited for what's to come"
Rather have Keldon Johnson
"Keldon Johnson, Brandon Clarke, KPJ (when taking about pure talent)"
Keldon Johnson
I’m a little biased but I’d lean Keldon Johnson
Keldon Johnson
"I can offer 1 hug for one Keldon Johnson, deal?"
"Devin Vassell is playing great defense already. He has struggled against some of the stronger players but very rarely makes a mistake. He's already a much better defender than Keldon Johnson, Lonnie Walker, and Patty Mills. Offensively he has hit his catch and shoot shots well and made the occasional athletic play. He has some moves to create shots of his own off the dribble but he's not great at it and isn't a good passer. He's doing pretty great I'd say. I imagine he'll get a much bigger offensive role in a few years and will improve his defense has gets stronger.  Tre Jones has been playing well in the G league and has barely played in the NBA. It's clear he knows how to play but if his shooting doesn't improve, I don't know how useful he will be."
"Defensively he’s about as well rounded as you can be as a center   Timing and instincts in protecting the rim are elite. If he doesn’t get a hand on a shot within 3 feet, there’s a good chance he has at least greatly changed the shot and intimated the offensive player into a miss   Way more mobile than a dude his size has any business being, I’m not going to say he’s a perimeter stopper or anything, but it’s not an automatic bucket if he gets switched onto the perimeter. Can recover from pick and roll coverage near the perimeter to challenge shots at the rim or even block the shot from behind- rarely quits on a play and hustles his ass off.   Strong, strong rebounder both offensively and defensively. Great positioning and lower body strength means he’s always in the right spot to get his hands on the ball and his wing span and hands allow him to corral rebounds in traffic very effectively. He can also clear out bigs with a box out and allow our lengthy guards and Keldon Johnson to fight for contested rebounds against smaller players.   I fucking love Jakob Poeltl."
"Those two were fringe aging all Stars at that point, with Derozan still playing at a high level. Out of that trade we also got Jak who has taken some time, but finally starting to play at a high level, and Keldon Johnson who is having a great 2nd year. We didn't have the fire power power those two so went youth and I would say this year it is evident the growth beimg made is worth it."
"Yeah the team that got keldon Johnson, Derrick white, and Dejounte Murray with 3 different 29th picks declining has to do with the front office, not a star player deciding to fuck us over lol  Being a GM in new York with a good owner is easy mode"
Dejounte Murray is better than any player Marks has drafted and so is Keldon Johnson.
"There is 0 way the Celtics give up a Jay for Beal so this is the best package I could think of. You get Timelord who is a promising young player, Langford who’s already an Elite defender and one of the greatest finishers in college basketball history, and Nesmith who over the past 3 games (he’s been getting real minutes lately) has been playing very very well with infinite energy and the highest plus minus on the team in those games. Kemba is for Salary matching purposes and it’s not like he’s a terrible player. He’s been averaging 22 on 50 40 90 over the past few games. The picks will definitely be late 1st rounders but it’s not like those picks won’t convey into good players. As an example look at Payton Pritchard, Timelord, Keldon Johnson, White, Jimmy Butler, Nikola Jokic, and more. The real question is if another team would put forth a better offer to beat this one. They’d need to give big salary pieces that are still young and those big salaries are the Fox’s, Tatum’s, and Brown’s of the world and I don’t think the teams will be willing to give them up."
"How many points does Keldon Johnson need to surpass him?  Oh, only 105 points per game for the next 6 games"
Just a reminder r/Spurs twitter thinks Keldon Johnson is better than Zion
I love Keldon Johnson he’s such a good player
"Lmfao why are Spurs fans soooo salty about Zion constantly? Is it because y'all are stuck as a middling team that still plays the most boring basketball in the league with no real promising young talent? Or do y'all just have a thing for Zion? Because I don't see y'all hating on Doncic like this even though we all play in the same division.   By the way, Keldon Johnson is trash compared to Zion. I swear to god if I see one more person compare Keldon Johnson to Zion I'm gunna flip."
"I'm gonna say it...this kind of play happens every single game.  Demar DeRozan or Keldon Johnson do this probably once or twice a night...but that doesn't get a highlight spot on the front page.  But oh yeah...because it's Zion, this is supposed to be more impressive."
You can pry Keldon Johnson from my dead big body.
"Keldon Johnson, Samanic, and your first"
"Daddy, Keldon Johnson is hilarious"
Read my other comment. Nick Johnson not Keldon
"DJM is the biggest improvement this year - DJM was a genuine negative player last year but he's one of the Spurs best this year. Keldon Johnson as a starter has been a huge improvement on last year as well, as well as Devin Vassell being a positive piece off the bench instead of Forbes/Belinelli who were negative players.  Spurs have the best bench in the league right now imo."
&gt;All Star in two years. I fucking love Keldon Johnson!  Do people realise how hard it is to make All Stars?  I'm also high on the Spurs players but I remember JSimms and Cujo.
"For Spurs Derrick White, it was learn how to run the Spurs offense as the floor general. For Keldon Johnson it was learning the offense on top of becoming a better shooter, play D. Lonnie Walker, learn since he was raw (and still is in some areas).    Tre Jones just turned 21, but it'll be very similar to White as a PG, running the offense. Spurs Luka just needs more game time and to dominate more along with showing hustle.  Spurs having their own team is very helpful since they use the same playbook."
"Yeah I you hit the nail on the head, their defence has been much better. They're up to 9th this season for DRTG after being 25th last season.      |||||+/-|+/-| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|G|MP|OnCourt|On-OffV| |1|Jakob Poeltl|26|564|+10.9|+21.1| |2|Rudy Gay|25|552|+9.7|+18.8| |3|Patty Mills|26|661|+7.9|+18.3| |4|Derrick White|7|162|+9.1|+11.2| |5|Devin Vassell|25|444|+4.9|+8.7| |6|Dejounte Murray|26|789|+1.2|+5.0| |7|DeMar DeRozan|24|800|-1.8|-3.1| |9|LaMarcus Aldridge|18|480|-8.2|-12.0| |10|Trey Lyles|14|165|-14.2|-15.5| |11|Keldon Johnson|26|781|-6.8|-16.0| |12|Lonnie Walker|24|647|-8.5|-16.0| |13|Drew Eubanks|10|132|-20.5|-22.2|    Based on these On-Off per 100 possession numbers it seems that the Spurs' success has also been driven more so from their deep bench and role players compared to their veteran starts."
"I’m lazy af but might do that.   It’s also possible it was Nick Johnson, not Keldon. Either way a pretty funny story"
All Star in two years.  I fucking love Keldon Johnson!
"Random Keldon Johnson anecdote:  I had court side seats to the Raptors 905 vs Austin Spurs championship game 2 in Toronto a couple years back. Keldon Johnson had a disgusting game, and went to the bench when the game was near over. He took of his Jordan 1’s that he was playing in and turned to face a Raptors 905 fan that had been chirping him all game. Keldon offered to trade him the shoes in exchange for the fan’s 905 jersey. The fan said hell yeah and swapped the jersey for the shoes. Keldon then proceeded to through the jersey in the garbage can and the whole section started laughing a lot.   Good times"
Keldon Johnson is badass
"Keldon Johnson is really good, man. How are SA gonna balance White, Murray, Walker, and Vassell in the next like 2 years btw?"
Counterpoint: Keldon Johnson
Haven't been watching much Spurs basketball.  Was Keldon Johnson always this frickin big?
The young spurs guards and wings are playing really great defense and it looks like their scoring is coming to them a lot easier too. Keldon Johnson looks legit and Dejonte is lowkey getting great assist numbers especially when he has a good scoring night
Demar plays alongside 2 guards and Keldon Johnson. I consider KJ mostly a 3 and Demar is playing like a point forward type role and bballref has him as a PF so i'll just consider him a PF for the purpose of this.
Keldon Johnson
Passed on Keldon Johnson 3 times and it’s only going to get funnier
"Essentially the same roster?!?! Bruh we started BRYNN FORBES almost every game last season, and Marco Belinelli got major min. We replaced them with Keldon BIG BODY Johnson and Devin 3&amp;D Vassell. This is a very different team. We’re fucking good defensively. Had and can get in stride on offense and be very tough to beat. Go spurs."
Keldon Johnson is the PF
"Dejounte Murray, Lonnie Walker IV, Devin Vassel, Keldon Johnson, etc. Look, we ain’t all casuals. The thing is, it’s still way too early to tell what the final standings are. Just relax a bit"
1. Keldon Johnson 🏎️
"I don't see the big deal with this. Lakers have a massive fanbase and vote for guys on their team when voting for LeBron and AD. If the spurs and lakers swapped the amount of fans they had, Keldon Johnson would probably be top 10."
"&gt; Keldon Johnson (who has been great for SA) is 231ist.  ehhh.  He shows flashes. But he's a really awful defender most of the time, and his shot is inconsistent."
Obviously not the best metric.    Sabonis is 212th.  Nicolas Batum is 20th.    Keldon Johnson (who has been great for SA) is 231ist.  Mike Muscala is tied with Dejounte Murray.  Sexton and Siakam are 80 spots behind Cameron Johnson.  Etc.
"His game is underrated.  Everyone wants flashy dunks, but part of the reason he chose Duke was Coach K saying, *""Hey I don't give a shit about the dunks. I like the other shit you do too. I'm going to give you the ball and let you do your thang.""* And I think we're going to see more and more of that once he has a full season of games under his belt. He can get his teammates good looks, he can pass, he can make other guys' lives a lot easier on the court. His efficiency % is nice, but it's fun to see these ASTs numbers bump up game to game too.  Fans from other teams are saying he's ""Eric Paschall, Julius Randle, and Keldon Johnson light"" so he is underrated in that sense too. lol."

"I haven’t checked in on Keldon Johnson since his year at Kentucky. He’s looking great — lotta aggression in his play, and he has put on a bunch of muscle. I knew the Spurs would do right by him, but damn."
What if I tell you about the Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson stocks?
"I can't really give you a reason for a specific game, I would have to watch that game. Was Valanciunas playing? He's usually going to grab more rebounds than then opposing center. Tillmann has also proven to be a good rebounder and Gorgui Dieng is an important part of the rotation. Not that many teams play three centers on a regular basis. But other teams with a strong frontcourt still fare well on the rebound department. Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner combined for 24 rebounds in their win over the Grizzlies. Keldon Johnson of the Spurs had 10, DeAndre Ayton 16. Dwight Howard and Ben Simmons combined for 34 rebounds against them... These are just a few games played in January.  The Grizzlies actually rank 15h in rebounds per game and 16th in opponents rebounds per game, that's average. Here and there you're always going to find stretches where other team's bigs or in general aren't going to rebound as much."
might be the mics... i feel like keldon johnson threw one down so hard a while back it blew the mic out and it sounded super crunchy the rest of the game
"&gt;This sounds like a text message I get from my friends in Fantasy league when they are trying to sell me on a package of SGA and Aldridge for Durant.  LOL I felt this, someone tried to sell me John Collins and Keldon Johnson for Curry"
"Spurs best suited to trade LMA to a contender and go all-in on the youth and rebuild movement. Get another lottery piece to go along with White-Dejounte-Lonnie-Devin-Keldon. Maybe a Jalen Green if lucky, Jalen Suggs, Kuminga, Jalen Johnson, or Zaire Williams.  Mavs need to get healthy and stay healthy, but they may still be missing a piece or two.  Rockets - very impressive post-Harden era and they haven't fully gelled yet. Wall-Dipo-Gordon-Woods-Tucker-Cousins-House-Nwaba is a solid rotation."
No he doesn't. Keldon Johnson is the PF. Poeltl is the C. Derozan and Murray do the bulk of the playmaking and guarding of opposite guards.
"Got 3 years of an all star level talent,poeltl and keldon johnson. Isn't great still but it isn't as bad as people made it look"
Did you forget what team Keldon Johnson plays for?
"He’s on the Spurs; Pop traditionally has rookies on a shorter leash, and they’re stacked at G/F with Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Lonnie Walker, Demar, Keldon Johnson, Patty Mills, and Rudy Gay. He’s averaging 17 minutes a game, which isn’t terrible, but it’s the least of any lottery player besides Okongwu, Toppin, Jalen Smith, Kira Lewis, and Nesmith. Those guys suffer the same problem as Vassell- being stuck in the rotation due to roster depth- but I also think they’re significantly worse than Vassell."
"[But Zion or Ja in a redraft?](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kydj7l/ja_or_zion_in_a_redraft/)  [""I'm taking Keldon Johnson over Zion""](https://twitter.com/redditspurs/status/1355259007490007043)"

Yeah, we should've drafted Lamelo, we know. We also should've drafted Keldon Johnson in 2019 and Mitchell Robinson in 2018, that's just how the draft goes sometimes.

"Hes clearly still figuring out how to use his body on drives and the right angles to attack plus handle gotta get better but love to see him looking so aggressive and attacking so viciously. Reminds me of keldon johnson the way he throws his body into bigs on drives and elevate over to finish. One of the best athletes in the game already, so skilled and makes it look so smooth. Really excited to see what he becomes"
"You can do hindsight draft picks with most teams.  I do agree though that the FO could have done a lot better even during the Golden Era and got lucky that they landed KD and are located in San Fran.  Picking Jacob Evans at #28 in 2018 is pretty awful in retrospect. In most drafts, you don't typically expect a late 1st rounder to become a major contributor, but that draft was deep with as you say, a bunch of players picked later than #28 being major rotational pieces right now.  Jordan Poole is a weird pick and the Warriors would be better today with Keldon Johnson, KPJ or Nic Claxton but this is more on Kerr not playing Poole earlier and now playing him in awful line-ups.  Wiseman at #2 made a lot of sense so I can't entirely fault the front office but damn Lamelo Ball or Tyrese Haliburton would have made the Warriors so much more competitive right now, next season, and Lamelo to me projects to be a way better player."
"Poole was not a good pick considering Keldon Johnson and KPJ were drafted directly after him. Those two look like they’ll be at minimum quality starters. Myers tried to outsmart the crowd and took the worst player out of the 3. How typical.  Paschall was a meh pick. Guy has been unplayable for most of this season.   And sure, DLo was a savvy move, but he also traded Iggy and a first to the Grizzlies to open that salary slot. The same Iggy who the Grizzlies got Winslow and other assets back for. Myers left a lot of fat on the meat in that sequence.  My criticisms of Myers center around his incompetence when it comes to filling out the bench ever since West left. Guy consistently brings in bums like Jerekbo or Wanamaker as his big FA signings while letting talent like Boucher, Nunn, and House walk out of the door. There’s no excuses for fielding back-to-back worst teams in the NBA sans-Steph in consecutive seasons. He’s an incredibly mediocre and overrated GM"
Probably Keldon Johnson. I like him a lot but I think it's odd he got on the rising star roster over Garland. He'll probably end up being a great energy player but never really put it all together. I just hope his defense improves because right now he is pretty bad. Obviously he was a steal at 29 and will keep improving but I think the odds of him being in serious discussion for an all star selection is very slim.
"Yeah Ive been saying for a while now they got lucky with what's frankly a donation from Minnesota with that pick this year in that hideous D'Lo trade for them. Because otherwise this has not been the most well run franchise from a roster building/talent management perspective for a while.   Danuel House, Chris Boucher, Kendrick Nunn, Georges Niang all once on the roster and got waived.   Havent made good use of things like the MLE in the past. Nick Young was useless in 2018. Omri Casspi did dick and pissed everybody off in the process. You can do this with every team I get it...but when the roster is flawed then you cant not look at it.   2019: Select Jordan Poole. The following 3 picks were Keldon Johnson, KPJ and Nic Claxton. 2018: Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent all within 10 picks. 2016: Damian Jones at 30: Following guys went within 10 picks: Ivica Zubac, Malcolm Brogdon  Dont want to relitigate the LaMelo thing, but if the ""fit"" concerns truly played a meaningful role in passing up on him that's not a justifiable process. Only pick I think theyve gotten any kind of value on of the past 5 yrs is Paschall  Last night just felt like Lou Will basically made every key play in the 4th quarter at particular key times. 3 point lead [hits Okongwu on the roll](https://go.nba.com/w5xg). Next play [pull up](https://go.nba.com/i7xn). Next play [baits JTS 3 shots](https://go.nba.com/rpuu). Gallo then the next few minutes decides to smartly do all his foul baiting and drawing before Steph is set to step back in on the next whistle. Then it's back to Lou [pass to Bogdan for 3](https://go.nba.com/nzqb). That entire early 4th quarter stretch felt like swung the game [this one in particular was a killer right before Steph is set to get back in](https://go.nba.com/uu34) you could feel it at the time. Breakdown defensively, Draymond doesnt want to leave the paint because of the Capela roll threat, think he wanted Wiggins to ""X-out"" where Draymond then wouldve taken Snell. [2 more for good count](https://go.nba.com/vxkb) from Lou [this I think was the other play that swung the game](https://go.nba.com/37ok)."
"It's an interesting matchup because the Spurs play a lot of pick and roll with the ball handler attacking the paint and the Pacers have awesome rim protection with Turner. On the other hand, the Spurs have in Poeltl and Keldon 2 guys that will feats on boards against a poor defensive rebounding team, which Indiana is. Indeed, San Antonio rebounded 37.7% of their own misses so that was a dominating feature of the game and in a game with a more 'Spurs'-y turnovers rate that could have sealed the deal.  Indiana made every single corner 3 and boy, you could feel it.  Keldon Johnson was terrific in everything that's considered ""dirty work"". He's got great positioning for offensive boards, he's constantly slapping at airborne balls and and he dives at any loose ball he gets his eyes on.  Not looking to diminish the hot start but I thought LeVert was terrible in the clutch of regulation. Not just the 2 turnovers (including an unforced double-dribble) and the forced bad shot attempts but the clock management: The team is up 5 with a little over 3 minutes and he's the one man against a set Spurs defense. Instead of waiting for his teammates he barges in full force, early in the shot clock, towards the paint and it ends up in a jump ball where possession turns for the Spurs (who would get a 3 afterwards).  TJ McConnell is the man. I have been in love with his game all season and I have been flirting with him as a top 5 6MOTY candidate. He absolutely earned that +21 today. Then again, the other side in this game has Patty Mills, who might just be on the most impactful backup guards in the league.  I have been a big Murray fan since the beginning but I don't think I can handle many more of these ""let's run a play for a Murray midranges early in the shot clock"", even if he makes them at a solid rate."
I wanna throw some love at BIG BODY Keldon Johnson with the dirty 20/10 on 7/10 fg. he gets some of the hardest looking buckets in the world and it feels like every time he drives he gets fouled because he plays so damn strong and angry. love this dude.
"I dunno, Murray's your only recent draftee with a really questionable shot.  White and Vassell shot 40% from 3 in college and have been pretty good in the pros, although early days for Vassell. Johnson and Walker shot 38% &amp; 35% in college and Lonnie at least looks like a pretty good shooter in the pros. I didn't really realize Keldon was only shooting 32% but his unsustainable heater last year still has his career percentage at almost 37%."
"&gt; As it is, you have an aging team who’s tried to compete for the last four years, and the best they could manage was the 7 seed  This is the youngest roster Pop has ever coached.  We've been rebuilding in place since our franchise player forced his way out, and are plenty happy with how we've drafted and developed players while actually trying to win games.  It's also misleading to ignore how much more difficult it is to advance up the board in the West.  &gt; We drafted an all-star, two very good players, and a number of role players and got to watch them grow.  A little reductive to called Luka Dončić an All Star, honestly.  But seriously, I really do enjoy watching Young play and think he's got clear comparisons to Steve Nash.  It's just bizarre to me that Hawks fans insist on pointing out that the guy they essentially drafted 3rd overall is better than the 29th pick we found at a culinary school.  It's not like Pels fans need to remind everyone that Zion is, in fact, better than Luka Samanić.  &gt; So I’d say Hawks fans are happy w/ the result of the last four years. Can you say the same thing about the Spurs? You enjoy losing those 7 seeds that much?  I can't speak for them, but I somehow doubt the average Hawks fan has enjoyed watching Hawks basketball the past four seasons, if they bother tuning in at all.  Kudos to those who do, but I don't blame anyone for choosing to skip watching a bad team play meaningless games.  As for us, it's great watching our guys develop together and gain real experience in the playoffs.  Watching the steady trajectory of genuinely likable blue-collar guys like Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Keldon Johnson, Luka Samanić, Lonnie Walker IV, Drew Eubanks, and Devin Vassell is a treat.  While I don't think anyone on our current roster can be the centerpiece of a championship roster, they absolutely have the chops to compliment that kind of player."
"So this is the old Lonnie Walker, Keldon Johnson defense. Just like last year it was the LaMarcus Aldridge and Bryn Forbes defense. The its not me its them defense.   I'd like to think Spurs fans are smart enough to figure out the common denominator here but perhaps I give too much credit."
"People said the Spurs got fleeced in the Kawhi trade, but they got Demar Derozan, Jakob Poeltl, and a pick which turned out to be Keldon Johnson. That's one year of Kawhi for *three* of their current starters.  This a rare case where both teams won the trade. Toronto got their chip, and Spurs got something from almost nothing because Kawhi would've walked anyway."
The Spurs might be about to do it again.  Dejounte Murray - 29th in 2016  Derrick White - 29th in 2017  Lonnie Walker - 18th in 2018  Luka Samanic - 19th in 2019  Keldon Johnson - 29th in 2019  Devin Vassell - 11th in 2020  All of which are really solid pieces. We're just lacking that franchise cornerstone at the moment so I hope one of these guys completely breaks out.
it's because I traded him in fantasy for larry nance jr (who broke wrist the next day) and keldon johnson (covid soon after)  You're welcome nuggets fans
"Spurs got Demar Deraozan, Jakob Poetle and a draft pick that ended up being Keldon Johnson. That was a fair trade."
"The thing that Spurs fans need to recognize (along with the org) is that you don't do anything meaningful with role players. You need a lead dog. DeRozan will be 32 at the start of next season...he ain't it. We can't build around a declining player who isn't even a surefire allstar.   So then what? Jakob Poeltl is a one-way five who will be 26 at the start of next sesason. He is who he is.   Patty Mills will be 33 at the start of next season, and is honestly a 3rd/4th guard. He's also not under contract.  DeJounte, while a nice player, is a 1-guard who can't shoot. You're not winning a playoff series if he's the engine of your offense.   Derrick White can't stay healthy and will be 27 at the start of next year. He is who he is, and that's not a lead dog.   So now we're talking ourselves into Devin Vassell and his 5.3 PPG, or Lonnie Walker (one of the worst players in the NBA according to the advanced analytics), or Luka Samanic who has been pretty bad for two years now, or Keldon Johnson, who...maybe? He can't really defend or shoot, though.  I like plenty of those guys, but they're a supporting cast."
Nah. Spurs got 2 of their starters AND Keldon Johnson out of a non-playing Kawhi who had 1 year left. That's pretty damn good.
I don't agree with OP that we have nothing to show for the trade even if DeMar walks for nothing cause we got Keldon Johnson &amp; Poeltl but this line of thinking from our front office is stupid asf. We're not sniffing contention for a while so a rival team winning now doesn't matter plus letting pride/bad blood get in the way of making the best trade possible is terrible management.
"The spurs got demar,poeltl who is a good starting center for them and the pick that get them keldon Johnson who is looking great for them. Considering this is the package for someone who wasn't playing a whole year and had his trade value so low it isn't bad"
"DeRozan got snubbed, but he is all star caliber. Spurs have a very balanced and talented young team right now and will make the playoffs. People used to say similar things about Kawhi when he was on the spurs. I'm not saying the spurs have another Kawhi, but they do have very promising talent in Keldon johnson, vassell, Lonnie walker, dejounte murray, derrick white... That defense...."
Keldon Johnson
"I’ll tell you, but only if you give us back Keldon Johnson  👀"
"I thought this would be San Antonio this year, but they are pleasantly surprising. That Keldon Johnson kid is also going to be a huge issue in the future"
Not the youngest but Keldon Johnson is 21 and did it like a month ago
"Compare the Spurs record/roster with some of the other rosters in the league and it's undeniable Pop is the GOAT.   Spurs currently have a record of 23-20 with their main core being Demar, Dejounte (29th pick), Derrick White (29th pick) and Keldon Johnson (29th pick).    Compare that to the Celtics being 23-23 with a core of Tatum/Brown/Kemba/Smart.    Compare that to the Pelicans being 20-25 with a core of BI/Zion/Lonzo/Bledsoe.    Compare that to the Kings being 20-25 with a core of Barnes/Hield/Fox    Or Pacers being 20-23 with a core of Sabonis/Brogdon/Turner"
"Yeah but the Mavs have Luka, the Spurs have Keldon Johnson"
"TBF, nobody can stop Keldon ""Big Body"" Johnson"
Present day Keldon Johnson
"Zion , RJ, Hunter, Keldon Johnson, Jordan Poole"
"Kpj, keldon Johnson, coby white"
"Keldon Johnson, maybe?"
De'Aaron Fox &amp; Keldon Johnson are two of my favorites
"I think they were pretty realistic when they sat Forbes and Belinelli in the bubble and gave significant minutes to Keldon Johnson and Lonnie Walker.  Also pretty evident that Poeltl was the guy this year, especially after the contract that they gave him."
"I feel like Keldon Johnson should get more shots. I don't watch a lot of spurs, but when I do he always impresses me. Any spurs fans weight in?"
As a Keldon Johnson day 1 I’m so happy he’s with the Spurs
Tomahawk dunking against a zone is the most Keldon Johnson thing I can think of.
Keldon Johnson of the San Antonio Rocketspurs
"Keldon Johnson has definite all star potential, the rest of the spurs guys are good picks though."
"All the Spurs young guys I feel like are this. Murray, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell etc, I don’t know if they’ll reach their star potential, but I’m confident in saying these guys will have long careers in the league"
"LaMarcus being traded, so all KP needs to guard is... Keldon Johnson and Poetl?"
"Spurs had bad luck of COVID, but beforehand they were looking really good. That includes White, Gay, Vassell, Keldon Johnson who were all out for more than a week. Slowly but surely we are getting them back (excep Vassell still)."
"Thanks for the perspective.  I have an appreciation for these franchises that are perpetually suffering like Detroit and Chicago and Minnesota.  And I am happy for clubs like Phoenix and their success.  It has been difficult to watch my Spurs through this transition.  It's been four years and we still aren't out of the woods.  Lots of potential and a solid group of coaches and a good infrastructure, but injuries and limits on potential can still happen.  And growth can be slow.  While I love seeing DeMar ball out he may leave soon.  Dejounte took a large leap this season but is still a ways away from leading the team.  Lonnie Walker and Keldon Johnson and Luka Samanic all have high ceilings but aren't there yet.  Like any of the teams I've listed above we have lots of potential but need to put the pieces together.  For the past three years we struggled to get enough offensive points to even compete.  We struggled with one of the worst defensive ratings in the league while shooting the least amount of threes per game.  It was hard to see Coach Pop's vision at times because of how we were losing.  Our players didn't seem to have the drive to win.  This attitude is different this year.  Whether we make the playoffs this year or not, the first half of this season our players have wanted to win and that has been the biggest difference.  So when I see the T-Wolves giving up in the second quarter not only do I feel compassion for those players but also those fans.  I think what I've learned from all this is basketball isn't all about stats.  Chemistry and balance and morale matter so much and can sink a team or propel them to greatness.  And congrats to how well your Nuggets are playing and the young talent you've got.  I've enjoyed watching them this season."
Keldon Johnson will go up against anyone at the rim. I torn between being impressed and WTF is he doing. Lol.
"Jesus, great move by Keldon Johnson"
"I disagree, we have a crazy good core with Derek white, Lonnie walker, DJM, keldon Johnson, and our first lottery pick in decades Deven Vassel. All these players would benefit more from having DD lead and teach them than we would get from obtaining a first round pick in this next class."
"I like that explanation! Thanks. I guess I can be like jay bilas and say keldon Johnson for me though. Just cuz he feels more raw and is just bigger so he has more potential. I guess some people would say, herro already seems the most polished player so this could be his peak.   But yeah, play making he probably the best out of the five but the others have a more physical tools. Just with height length they guess have a higher potential just because of that"
Keldon Johnson isnt the second option at all lol
Keldon Johnson?
"Monte Morris, Sabonis, PJ Dozier, Keldon Johnson, Larry Nance, Garry Tent, Josh Hart.   Role players are not sexy"
"Keldon Johnson, aka ""Big Body"""
 Will Keldon Johnson ever become an all star?
Will Keldon Johnson ever become an all star?
Hard to see the magic going for a package of salary filler Aldridge + a late first pick for their all star under contract for two more years.   That base plus Keldon Johnson + Lonnie walker or Devin vassell would probably need to be the start of conversations.
"There have been some quietly really good rookie years. I feel like all of RJ, Garland, Hunter, Rui, Cam Johnson, Washington, NAW, Thybulle, Bazley, Poole, Keldon, KPJ, Claxton, Gafford, Roby, THT, Mann and McDaniels have taken noticeable jumps this season."
Who tf is Keldon Johnson and why did he save my fantasy team some weeks?
Spurs package has turned out to be better than it initially seemed. Poeltl has become a solid center. They got Keldon Johnson with that 2019 Raps pick and then Derozan has been terrific for them.   It’s not comparable to other superstar trades but this was before everyone started giving up 8 draft picks for disgruntled players. Pair that with the injury questions that were around Kawhi and the fact that the Spurs wouldn’t trade him inter-conference and they did pretty okay looking back.
Guessing Keldon Johnson does? Crazy he’s also small at 6’5” 220
What do Spurs fans think of Keldon Johnson? Was fun to watch at UK and seems to be developing well for you guys.
Idk Keldon Johnson is just Zion with a jump shot.
"Skill Boost to DeJounte Murray, make him a mid range god (like cp3 or derozan)  Athleticism to Lonnie Walker, maybe he'll dunk from the 3 point line  3 Inches to Keldon Big Body Johnson, for obvious reasons"
"So, i'm confused because to me, you guys did a beautiful rebuild. Devin Vassell looks to be a very promising player that has a lot of potential, same with Keldon Johnson, Lonnie Walker, Murray looks pretty good (i'd even say he's gonna look very good next year) and Poeltl is finally starting to grow into what a lot of fans thought he could be. I wouldn't be surprised if most of these players become solid starter or even fringe allstar tier players given how they look at under 25. Maybe one of them will take the leap into all star tier. In 1-3 years or so depending on how FA works out, you guys are also primed to make the next package for a superstar.  You have probably the best FO to scout and help develop players given your record, the ""shot doctor"" in Chip Engelland to start these players off with a good shot, and the goat coach at the helm. Remember the 2014 Spurs?  Pop has taken a team with Demar as their best player, a couple of aging veterans from the glory days who have taken the bench role to ease the transition, the promising young players I named, and others, to a record thats better than teams with cores of:   Ingram+Zion+Lonzo, Fox+Hield+Barnes+Haliburton, SexLand+LNJ+Allen-KLove, LaVine+injuries, Raptors/Nurse magic, WB+Beal, Pacers-coaching staff.   IN ADDITION, they're within striking range of the Warriors and the Hornets.  Sure DeMar is probably better than some/most of those players, but I would argue he also has far less help. Like, you guys are doing *great*. As a Warriors fan, I think we have a pretty solid FO given our track record, but man I really wonder what Engelland could have done for Green's shot or something. I really wonder if the Spurs FO in our position would have picked Patrick Williams or something."
How sexy Keldon Johnson is
"Forr the UFA maybe go for some or one of          Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Harry Giles, Cody Zeller, James Johnson, Otto Porter Jr          For the RFA which imo they are unlikely to sign         Lauri Markkanen, John Collins, Jarrett Allen, Duncan Robinson         Everytime I've watched the Spurs this year im always thinking man they need some more Interior Defense, Rebounding, and scoring from the big. Another path I think they can take is getting a shooter that is around 6'6 where imo Devin Vassell or even Keldon can mold into the PF spot as the never really played a traditional big at PF, it was usually Rudy/Demar and sometimes Lyles/Keldon. Outside of Jakob's defense his offensive game is abysmal and his backups are weak both defensively and offensively."
Does Keldon Johnson play like a PF or is he more of a wing that slides down a position
what does keldon johnson have to do  with anything lmao
Hurt feelings from the Keldon Johnson cohort?
Understandable. Nobody want to face keldon johnson.
"You’re right, that’s objectively not true. However, when he takes a midrange shot when Keldon Johnson, who’s like 6’5, is on him, that IS the tiniest of victories. It just so happens that he’s a great midrange guy and made most of them, anyway."
"How is this not on Keldon Johnson (#3) who just stood around watching as Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons run in for the rebound.  Absolutely no awareness there, he could have at least boxed one of them out."

"Yes. Because he went against Drew Eubanks, Rudy Gay and Keldon Johnson lol.    Taking fade away mid ranges (including the potential game winner which he could have easily taken to the rim) is a massive win."
"Keldon Johnson and Lonnie Walker are the truth, I swear. Spurs have a nice core and their player dev is pretty sick."
He’s going to be one of those players that someone who just looks at stats will make a post in the off-season asking “why does anyone care about Keldon Johnson?”  You can tell he’s a legit player when watching him.
"Keldon Johnson was fucking terrible in OT.  He didn't put his body on Simmons for that final shot either, instead just watched the ball. That would have been his assignment.  He's 21 so it's not like this is necessarily the type of player that he always will be but he had a lot of misplays, each of which were very costly."
The last 10 minutes of that game was a one on one showdown between Embiid and Keldon Johnson and it was honestly a toss up. Keldons attitude is awesome.
Idk but buy some fucking stock in Keldon Johnson holy shit
"Keldon Johnson was fucking terrible in OT.  He didn't put his body on Simmons for that final shot either, instead just watched the ball.  That would have been his assignment."
Keldon Johnson   That is all
Keldon Johnson is a fucking stud
Don't forget Keldon Johnson.  He has one of the higher ceilings of all of our young players.
Who the hell is Keldon Johnson though?
celtics really got keldon johnson pulling middies on them
Keldon Johnson gonna keep getting better and better. Multiple all star and possible All-NBA potential at the end of the first round.
Spurs are always great. Keldon Johnson especially looks like a steal
"Here are the Spurs 1st round picks in the past 5 years:  2016 - Dejounte Murray (29th)  2017 - Derrick White (29th)   2018 - Lonnie Walker (18th)   2019 - Luka Samanic (19th)  2019 - Keldon Johnson (29th)   2020 - Devin Vassell (11th)   All these guys listed above look like they can be legit rotation pieces at the minimum. Also, considering they’ve only had one pick in the lottery, they’ve drafted incredibly well relative to their position. I’d probably go Raptors, Spurs, Heat, Nuggets, &amp; Hornets in that order."
"Only arguable one I see is Hawks at #4. Could argue Herro, Cam Johnson, Clarke, Keldon, KPJ could be better picks. Still really early though."
"So glad he's turning it up and showing his potential after all the doubters last season and earlier this year.  Keldon Johnson is also awesome to watch though, love the Big Body."
Keldon Johnson
Keldon Johnson
"&gt; none of their young talent looks very promising.   Dejounte Murray, White, Keldon Johnson, Lonnie Walker, and Poelt are really good and promising players. I doubt u are watching Spurs games consistently so I wouldn't make a comment like that."
"The Kawhi trade is constantly pointed to as among the worst in history, despite the fact that we got an offensive juggernaut in DeRozan, a DPOY-candidate in Poeltl, and a Rising Star in Keldon Johnson in exchange for a one-year rental of a guy who outright refused to play for us."
my takeaways:  god we suck at 3s (minus Bertans sometimes)  god we suck at having a good coach  god i love big body keldon johnson  god i love demar   good game spurs! see ya in the finals bb
"Damn lmao he edited and added Keldon Johnson but still no Poole, the disrespect"
"Seeing Keldon Johnson just power through Bertans knocking him over to get a shot felt great, but also hurt. I miss Bertans so much :("
"Completely forgot about Keldon Johnson, will add him"
"Nah, Jordan Poole is going to be the best Jordan to have played in the league.  You also forgot Keldon Johnson"

"I'm surprised we're even mediocre with all the shit we had to do. Our big 3 retired, we lost a top 10 guy in the league because he forced himself out after not playing for like the whole year, while doing that we gave up one of the best 3&amp;D guys in the league for some reason, got back DeRozan, Poetl, and  29th pick that turned into Keldon Johnson, then we traded away one of our best 3 point shooters because we thought we'd get Morris WHO FUCKING BACKED OUT after we had basically been told he was in, picked up Demarre Carroll who literally did jack shit and left for nothing, picked up Trey Lyles who's been woefully inconsistent, and let Aldridge walk for nothing at all (but then he retired so that one turns out alright)   But man, this team just keeps fighting and refuses to die lol"

"I'd have to agree. The number of good/solid players they've been able to draft at the end of the 1st has been insane.  Just the past 7 years they've drafted 5:  Kyle Anderson #30  Dejounte Murray #29  Derrick White #29  Lonnie Walker #18  Keldon Johnson #29  However, the Spurs also have an incredible coaching and development staff, and it would be hard to say how well these guys would have done in other places. Meanwhile, my franchise routinely blows top lottery picks on guys like Dunn and Culver."
Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson gonna be up there soon.
yeah he doesn't even talk about how much they disrespect Keldon Big Body Johnson with the no calls 🙄
Keldon Johnson is next in line to become the next Spurs wtf-how-did-they-find-this-one rising star
Keldon Johnson
"Someone would take drew Eubanks. He looked decent last year. Spurs would protect Murray; white, Keldon Johnson, walker, Poeltl, Samanic, Tre Jones, and Devin Vassell"
"Picks 14 and 22 are basically a crapshoot. Sure they could have Thybulle and Keldon Johnson, but it's not like Morant was still on the board."
"The Powell trade is one of his worst trades in like 5 years. And it's not even a bad trade  You say ""2 firsts for Covington"" as if the 16th and 23rd picks aren't an ABSOLUTE STEAL for Covington. That's a great trade.   Collins is an iffy pick based on who was picked after him, but Collins himself is a productive player if he could ever be healthy  ""Drafted Little over KPJ and Keldon Johnson"". Yes and? Is that bad somehow? Little's potential is through the roof  ""Used another first on Simons"" Simons is already way better than your average 24th pick  You list all these things as if they're somehow negatives, but almost every thing you mentioned was a good-to-great move  I will give you his signings though, he rarely ever gets good players, but that's moreso due to the market"
Idk Powell is a FA that could walk. They gave up a 22 year old RFA to get him    He also traded 2 firsts for Covington. Drafted Zach Collins over Mitchell and Bam. Drafted Little over KPJ and Keldon Johnson. Used another first on Simons. Only recent signings were Melo and Kanter. Not the best job of surrounding Dame.
Big body keldon Johnson &gt; poole
"Or Portland can just get better at drafting.     Spurs got one FRP for Kawhi Leonard and turned it into Keldon Johnson. Johnson is now in the starting lineup.  KP is still good. Above average defense (Portland desperatly needs), and solid off-ball shooting. Just needs to be in the right situation to thrive again. Which is what Portland has."
"Is it?      Blazers get younger and have an All-Star in Pingus Tingus. They also get a FRP and a decent player in THJ. Plus, they offload on Covington.      People critized CJ McCollum and Dame Lillard for being too ball-dominant, and have argued trading away McCollum for years. Mavs ain't going to trade for McCollum just to have that same issue with Luka. But with Dame, they might as Dame is ridiculously talented.   Portland's new roster sets up Pingus Tingus for success. He's critized for not being aggressive and not good at off-ball, but he plays above average defense and can shoot the lights out. Can fit in with Portland's roster.   Even if you're insanely high on Dame (which is reasonable), there's no way to tell that it's a garbage trade a few years from now.      Similar to Kawhi + Danny Green for Poeltl, Derozan, + FRP (Keldon Johnson). Looked bad at the time, but both teams benefitted greatly. Kawhi won a ring in Toronto, and Keldon Johnson and Poeltl are starters for the Spurs.     Similar to Oladipo and Sabonis for Paul George. Heavily critized at the time, but Oladipo and Sabonis ended up becoming all-stars. Pacers flipped Oladipo for LaVert, and now have a young core on Lavert and Sabonis. OKC had a perennial MVP candidate in George, who they flipped for Shai + 5 FRP."
"looking up my notes for the 2019 draft, here are players i wanted for the Wolves (at the time 11th pick).  Hunter (the only one clearly out of reach)  Clarke  NWA  Keldon Johnson   Okpala  KPJ  Langford  Little   Heavily ignored PJ Washington and Cam Johnson, but otherwise I think I had pretty good overlook of what the players were in that draft."
"I mean i think Pop did an amazing job with this years Spurs. The top 5 minutes played on the Spurs were Dejounte Murray, Derozan, Keldon Johnson, Poetl, and Patty Mills.   They still got the 10th seed and for the better part of the season were in the 8th seed ahead of GS until Covid hit them and they lost Derrick White for the season after he only played 30ish games.   1) DJM - elite defensive player with no consistent outside shot  2) Derozan - sucks on defense, has no outside shot   3) Keldon Johnson - effecxtively a rookie with no outside shot   4) Poetl - good on defense, no offensive game outside of rolling to the baskett   5) Mills - career 6th man   He still took this team to a record better than the Pelicans with BI/Zion, Kings with Fox, Hield, Barnes, Haliburton, and was close to the Warriors who had an MVP candidate, Celtics who had Jaylen/Jayson, etc."
Homer Pick: Keldon Johnson  Other: Anthony Edwards
Keldon Johnson
Are we forgetting about KELDON JOHNSON!?!?!?
"Also because expectations are different. Keldon Johnson is a good player but he isn't a star. So that's a great pick for like 29th overall or wherever they selected him.  But a top 3 pick who is just a starter or 6th man is a disappointment.  Also a couple of other factors which I think are important. Early in the first you are selecting on talent and potential. Whereas later in the first you are selecting on current ability and attitude. This means you are more likely to get a player who will put in the work to succeed even though they aren't as talented.   A good comparison of this I would say is someone like Jordan Poole (I picked him because he is the easiest example I can think of) and Marvin Bagley 3. Bagley is one of the most talented players in the league. 6'11 fluid athlete can jump 35 inches, arms for days, ball handling and shooting potential. And he is just ass because he doesn't work hard enough.  Another Factor is passion for the game. A lot of bigs don't like bball they are just big and athletic which means when they were basically shoehorned into basketball.  Plus then you have organisational fit as you mentioned but not just about development. But like late in the draft teams draft for the needs early teams tend to go BPA. This means a team late in the draft will be getting a player they know exactly how they want to use. Whereas high in the draft you might be shoe horning them into an awkward role they aren't suited for say Aaron Gordon as a 3 on the magic."

"2003: Spurs trade the draft rights to Leandro Barbosa to Phoenix for a 2005 first-round pick  2005: San Antonio trades Malik Rose, the 2005 pick from Phoenix, and a 2006 first round pick for Nazr Mohammed and Jamison Brewer. Now, this wasn't bad, since Mohammed played a role in delivering the 2005 championship but then...  2005 NBA draft: New York Knicks draft David Lee with the #30 pick conveyed through the Malik Rose trade.  ----  2011: San Antonio trades George Hill to Indiana for the 15th pick (Kawhi Leonard) and the 42nd pick (Davis Bertans).  2018: San Antonio trades Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green to Toronto for DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Pöltl, and a 2019 first round pick (Keldon Johnson)."
"He shot below 50% from the field against 1 team this year, Golden State. If I'm using the NBA stat website correctly it seems like Draymond was matched up with him for 12 minutes in those two games and Zion had 47 FG%. Keldon Johnson and BroLo are the only other two with over 10 minutes and under 50%"
"That 2019 draft was pretty stacked. You have Zion and Ja leading the way, with other very talented guys like RJ, Hunter, Thybulle, KPJ, Hachimura, Garland, Keldon Johnson, Poole and Claxton."
We’ll take him only to trade him away for assets and get another Keldon Johnson again.
Keldon Johnson has really exceeded expectations considering he’s basically a rookie in terms of games played. When he dropped that 24pt/21reb game a few months ago I was smiling ear to ear. Really a player to look out for next year.
"Some bias but one of the Spurs guys in Murray, white, Keldon Johnson, and Walker. I’m expecting derozan to not return so that opens quite a lot of touches and shots for someone to have a big jump in numbers"
"They did trade for the pick that became Keldon Johnson, and he's not a good shooter 👀"
"Jimmy got traded for Robert Covington, Dario saric, Justin Patton, Jared bayless, and a second. Kawhi got traded for an all nba player (derozan), a young center with potential (poetl) and a pick that became keldon Johnson. Safe to say that jimmy was easier to trade for."
I’m sorry but that’s a terrible haul. This trade happened right after LeBronto when Derozan’s value was at an all time low from underperforming multiple times in the playoffs. Poeltl is a defensive center with no offensive game and Keldon Johnson is a 6’5 power forward. With the Lakers offer they could have acquired two young 6’9 wings. Ingram made the all star team at 22 and Kuzma has flaws but has worked himself into a decent 3&amp;D player on a championship team. With Ingram they would have had their next franchise player. Instead they have DeRozan leaving this summer in FA and two average role players.
"The spurs got derozan,poeltl and keldon johnson in the end. Solid haul still considering the lakers option was Ingram,kuzma and picks I think so its definitely closed the gap at least"
"You think that because you’re a Lakers fan, and Lakers fans thought they would get Kawhi for cheap.      &gt; With LeBron officially agreeing to sign with the Lakers, it’ll be fascinating to monitor what type of leverage the Spurs can create for Kawhi Leonard, who still desires to play for the Lakers, according to multiple league sources—all of whom say offers to the Spurs have been underwhelming.  &gt;One executive said the proposed packages have gotten worse with each round of negotiations, while another said they’re flat-out unacceptable.       The Spurs didn’t get an amazing package, but three of their starters in the play-in game were acquired in that trade: Derozan, Poeltl, and Keldon Johnson."
"You think derrick white, Keldon Johnson and a meh center is worth Kawhi, and you’re gonna talk about bad takes?"
Lool..kevon looney for keldon johnson or looney walker
He’s not better than keldon Johnson or pj Washington y’all are starting to take the memes too seriously
Lonnie walker or Keldon Johnson could make a jump next year. Maybe NAW on the pelicans
"Excuse me, that first round pick is named Keldon Johnson and he is a treasure"
any team with average shooters would love to have this guy  the problem he struggled here is because the paint is consistently flooded and his passes always end up going back to 3 point snipers Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson
"Few pretty straightforward takeaway from the game:  Dillon Brooks was the best player on the court. JV was a beast and played insanely well too, but Brooks was simply immense. His play just screamed intensity, urgency, and excellence and both ends of the floor tonight.  Dejounte is too good at defense. Seriously. Big part of why Brooks went crazy tonight is because Dejounte kinda took Ja out of the game.   About midway through the 4th, they decided to go a possesion where they switched it up, put Dejounte on the hot Brooks and let Keldon Johnson defend Ja, and Ja just went past him like he wasn't even there. Whereas Dejounte made it look like he was in prison.  Despite Dejounte's efforts to take Ja out of the game though, it was cancelled out by Derozan's poor shooting. He didn't have terrible looks or play badly, he just shot awfully. And the other options for the Spurs are simply not as good as Memphis's other options, at least certainly in this game."
KELDON JOHNSON
I'm rooting for Keldon Johnson
average nba fan: buhhh i like lebron and steph because they score points  average ball in basket enjoyer: keldon johnson is poetry in motion
"KELDON ""AHHHHHHHHHHHHH"" JOHNSON"
"Hunter, Keldon, and Cam Johnson are all wayyyyy to low"
"Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, Jakob Poeltl, Lonnie Walker, Luka Samanic, Tre Jones. I feel like Eubanks would certainly be taken from us. He is a decent backup 5 on a minimum for two more years."
"It’s not about the scoreboard, it’s about how they looked in that loss. They had zero answer for Anthony Davis, inside or outside.  It’s pretty different than Keldon Johnson, Drew Eubanks, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Rudy Gay, and Devin Vassell all going off at the same ."
"I think we got interested in him and ultimately picked him because we heard the Spurs were interested in him after he worked out for them. The Spurs got Big Body Keldon Johnson with their pick, so it worked out for the both of us."

"No need to say who is at 1, obviously Keldon Johnson would be everyone’s first pick."
I love Keldon Johnson
"&gt; Keldon Johnson on Dray at the time with his arms sort of outstretched so Dray decides to jack up a 3 cuz he thought the Spurs would foul and give him 3 free throws instead of 2, not knowing that Pop doesn't subscribe to the ""foul when up 3"" notion  Ah, that make sense."
"Down 3 with the ball, Steph inbounded it to Dray who everyone and their mother expected to pass back to Steph. I think it was Keldon Johnson on Dray at the time with his arms sort of outstretched so Dray decides to jack up a 3 cuz he thought the Spurs would foul and give him 3 free throws instead of 2, not knowing that Pop doesn't subscribe to the ""foul when up 3"" notion. To be fair to Dray, he described it as ""the dumbest smart play in NBA history."" Thankfully he learned after that game and decided that the best plan of action is indeed to give the ball to Steph and GTFO the way."
"derrick White got a 20 million dollar contract and is our best two way player when healthy and DeJounte is one of the best two way pgs in the NBA, and Keldon Johnson went like 5 or 6 in John Hollinger a redraft for his year. they're certainly lottery picks, if not in the top half in those years."
"&gt;you can't count on drafting someone like that when you're a fringe playoff team  The Spurs already drafted someone like that while a contender. Sure you can't ""count on it"" but you can't count on it with the number 1 pick either.   Spurs definitely have to be willing to package some of their young guys for something bigger, but I would be terrified to move Keldon Johnson or Lonnie Walker right now."
Keldon Johnson  Kevin Porter Jr  Cam Reddish
The top 2 candidates will both be on the Spurs: Keldon Johnson and Kyle Kuzma
Keldon Johnson takeover time
"I mean because it’s true lol?? If their best players play, Team USA can straight-up send a team like KD, Curry, Harden, Lebron, Kawhi, etc?? Like which country is even close to having that amount of talent? The fact that team USA is not sending guys like Keldon Johnson (no disrespect to him) and it is still consider a big upset if they don’t win it all is telling you all you need to know about amount of talent the US have compared to any other country"
"I think one this that sticks out so far (but has improved game by game) is how soft Tatum was playing. He has all the physical tools and skills but early on he was insisting on these pussy finesse finishes or fadeaways that don’t fly in FIBA instead of just yamming on people or taking contact like he can. This is partly why Keldon Johnson has been more successful than we expected because he just goes up strong and finishes instead of trying to euro step or whatever. Spurs fans might not want to hear this but it’s undeniable that Tatum is just far make talented than Johnson.   The big knock on Boston was how soft they were, and hopefully this is actually a wake up call for Tatum on how he should always be playing, he’s actually huge and strong Af when he decides to be."
"Recently, it’s Keldon Johnson"
Well at least Keldon Johnson is okay.   - Things I never thought I'd say.
"&gt;First of all, no Keldon Johnson slander allowed here.      &lt;3"
"First of all, no Keldon Johnson slander allowed here.   Second of all I didn't know Zach was out"
"The team definitely needed a ""glue guy"" and Keldon Johnson can be that.  It feels like most of these guys are out there playing like they are better than everybody and just have to be there....no desperation whatsoever.  For KJ, he is only a 2nd year NBA player and spent most of his rookie season in the bench. This is the biggest opportunity of his lifetime, and he shows it when he is on the court."
"Bit of an aside, but Hunter goes 3rd for certain - he's the clear 3rd best player from that draft behind Zion and Morant, at least thus far.  He was breaking out big time when he went down last season.  Thybulle is realistically still going pretty close to where he was picked.  The problem with Thybulle is he is so bad on offense that you simply can't play him more than spot minutes.  He's more of a luxury player for a contender than anyone a team can build around.   And the other problem with Thybulle is he's basically at his ceiling already.  He's old and not likely to improve much on offense.  So for a draft that's only 2 years old, you're still drafting more for potential.  I'd only take Thybulle ahead of anyone that looks like a solid bust thus far (like Culver), and on the other end you've got later picks like Clarke, Mann, Keldon Johnson, THT, etc that you'd probably take above Thybulle.  Long story short - nobody wants a defense only specialist in the Top 10 picks, no matter how good he is on defense."
y'all are really gonna sit here and say he didnt deserve the invite over jeramy grant and keldon johnson??
then why take Keldon Johnson?
"If Keldon Johnson continues to develop like a lot of Spurs fans think he will, then a lot of the “who is this guy” and the “he doesn’t deserve it comments” will be fun to look at as well."
"Bit of everything really, from a combination of websites like basketball reference, Spurs articles, lineups and rotations Pop uses and actually watching how the Spurs use Derozan.  Derozan usually takes on the responsibilities of a traditional SF, in being a jack of all trades. He's also regularly used to guard a lot of the bigger non-centre players and etc.  This season him and Keldon Johnson were manning the forward positions for the Spurs."
"Honestly I'd say it makes sense considering this is his real breakout season, but then again we have Jerami Grant, Keldon Johnson, and McGee who all have never gotten an all star appearance so kind of disrespectful"
"People laughed at him getting a spot because they don't watch the Spurs and are inferring a lot from the Pop connection, but it wouldn't surprise me if Keldon Johnson becomes a really important part of the team. He's awesome and can contribute a lot as a role player."
Gets blown by while flat footed in the PnR then shows fantastic awareness not giving up on the play and recovering. This is quintessential Keldon Johnson stuff right here.

KELDON BIG BODY JOHNSON. REMEMBER  THE NAME
"Jerami Grant yelled, “There we go!” Draymond Green gave a look of pleasant surprise. Jayson Tatum belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Keldon Johnson hit the locker room door, ex-USA Olympic star Carmelo Anthony hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"All the people complaining about Keldon Johnson being added can suck it.  Seriously though, his situation reminds me of Bruce Brown on the Nets. Keldon does a lot of the small things and also benefits from the attention of the other stars."

"ah yeah, the goat ingram that with all-star zion lead the pelicans to the playoffs, exactly him!   lmao man, might mot have gotten the best deal, but i'm fine with olympian keldon johnson and one of the best rim protector in the NBA in Jakob while having an extremely dope mentor and guy in DeRozan that cemented a nice mentality and culture in the young ccore. and might be able to get some more from him this offfseason. all without destroying the entire league.  and are we sure they would have done that deal? or would they wait like they did with paul george? mh"
"most importantly, spurs still have Keldon Johnson who was drafted with that pick from toronto"
Are javele and Keldon Johnson top 50 players
"Darius garland, kevin porter, keldon johnson, derrick white, and jordan poole seem like good bets maybe dejounte"
"Sadiq Bey, Rui, Darius Bazley, Keldon Johnson or either one of Ayton/Mikal. I'll thrown Cam J in there as well."
Keldon Johnson
Patrick Williams not getting any love out here?  Keldon Johnson with DeRozan gone and a lot more shots that need to be taken makes the most sense among these though
"I think it's gotta be BIG BODY Keldon Johnson, he's got the confidence and that national experience has helped people's games grow before As a raptors fan it can't be OG, hes already good and doesn't look like that handle will ever have a significant enough jump to add anything major to his offense this season. Admittedly don't really watch the Wizards so maybe I'm ignorant on Rui?"
Keldon Johnson  More room to breakout vs the other two and multiple guys are gonna get the chance to step up with Derozan gone.
"Some paragraphs I wrote about as season recap. I hope they are helpful.  * **DEJOUNTE MURRAY**  Here HE is. What an amazing dude DJ is man. From being passed up in the Draft because of his background and tearing his ACL in his third year to be the true leader of the youngins in his 4th season. I'm might be a homer about DJ lmao, but I really think he's that dude, the one that ok may not be your go-to-guy on offense, but definitely the one you always want in your team, pushing everyone to their best. He made major improvement, he can finish at the rim with ease, his mid-range is so beautiful and kinda already almost automatic, his defense got back to the level when know and we gotta consider that he still had to play with DeMar and also, for the vast majority of the season, with Lonnie, both not great perimeter defender, with possibly DW and Keldon it would go even better than he already is. He's mentally at the next level, so I can see him develop more and more, sky's the limit. What I would focus on this offseason is trying to optimize the three pointer with more confidence and maybe some other small stuff like building up more muscles and bring playmaking to another level, handles too. Gotta love DJ tho!  * **DERRICK WHITE**  Sadly Derrick missed ton of games this season, he just could stay healthy. First he injured his foot in the Bubble, he came back at the beginning of 2021, he immediately injured his toe, before coming back he re-injured it, he came back, few games and he got COVID, he came back, played well for few games and again injured himself, this time his ankle. Man, it was tough to see our boy down. It showed that we really need him, he's so essential for our team. He's the most complete player in the team, he really can do it all. Next to DJ he's just perfect, they complement each other so well. I just hope DW, I mean everyone, stays healthy so we can watch him play all season long with DJ!  * **KELDON JOHNSON**  **BIG BODY.**  Man, I love this dude lmao. He has played so well this season and didn't even play triple digits games in the NBA, he gained all Pop's trust so quickly, it's crazy to me, it's hella difficult to do so! Our roster honestly wasn't prepared for such a breakout player like Keldon so we had to adapt and we played him at the 4, defintely not his ideal position. He had to guard the opponent's best player kinda each night, he's that versatile on defense, from Zion to JJJ to Doncic, and somehow he manages to do nice enough. The point is that yeah he coudl slide sometimes, but he's a 3 and like this he would play much better in every single way. His main strenght on offense is driving to the basket so having a smaller and thinner player on him would help him a lot than having AD or Zion, defintely. On defense too, I still remember that ""viral"" clip of him locking Doncic up in the last game before COVID in 2020, against smaller opponents he manages to stay with his man both in the arc and inside. Another aspect to not forget it's rebounding, at SF he would actually be able to help even more and box out smaller players. In terms of working out I would defintely work on the shooting, especially the three pointer, he made 1 a game, I would like to see him hitting at least 2 a game next season. He already showed improvement with the season going on, especially from the mid-range with him acutally creating his own shot, it was beautiful to watch. The way he developed since entering the NBA is crazy to many, I really do not know what to expect from this dude, he's has been amazing!  * **JAKOB POELTL**  Jak started teh season really poorly. With LMA still being around, he just could find the right fit, but once LMA went away, he finally stepped up BIG. After that awful FT slump, he somehow fixed it and went crazy, really couldn't miss anymore lmao, but he still needs to be consistent and especially confident with his shooting mechanics from the FT. His defense is statistically one of the best among big men in the entire league, dude is realyl good at it. On offense he does the small things well. Now tho he knows his role and what he needs to do, he just needs to master these things, not add much more. For example, his main problem is aggressiviness, man he needs to freaking dunk that ball, acutally get up and put it back in with ferocity, here he should imitate Drew effort! On defense kinda the same, sometimes he randomly get lazy and the opponent scores on him with ease. Also, on offense I would work more and those small hook/floaters from near the rim, mastering them would be amazing! I think that now that he knows his role Jak can have a solid offseason of work!  * **LONNIE WALKER IV**  My boy Lonnie, prolly one of the most controversial, according to this sub, player in this roster. Let's start with this season. All the times Derrick was out he started. He did not played amazing, but let's analyze. He was the last guy considered on offense, but let's be honest, it's all his fault. He's too passive, he needs to be more aggressive an take resposabilites and ask for the ball more, definitely. On defense? He was below average, but he wasn't that bad as advanced stats tell. I mean, he defintely lacks some fundamentals especially as team defense, but at least you can see he tries and on 1v1 he's acutally nice and sometimes he even makes nice defensive plays, but defense it's definitely his main weakness (along with passiviness I would say). Anyway, I personally love Lonnie both as a player and a person. He seems to be such a genuine guy, emotional one, care about everything, players and himself, hard-worker, we wanna prove he has value and that he can hide his weaknesses by working out on them. He (at least for me) has shown he truly has ton of potential but still needs A LOT work, that's a fact. He did an amazing offseason of work last summer, He's polished his finishing and his jumpshot became pure, while also building up muscles. I expect him to work on other things this summer, maybe keep working with Jrue Holiday might help him in terms of defense and positioning, Jrue excels at these things, Lonnie doesn't. TO defend Lonnie from criticism I would also add that he's 22yrs player in his 3rd season in the league, he spent his first season in the G-League, the second one half on the bench because of Marco-Bryn, half for just 10mins, i his 3rd one he finally got solid minutes and averaged 11ppg in 25mins. Does Lonnie need to work like hell this summer in things that are related with defense? ABSOLUTELY, he needs to do so. He also has to work on much more other stuff, like know where to be, be less passive, work on hands and dribbling, do not take bad shots just because he feels hot.. he definetely need to workout. Now, he has a really solid work ethic, just look at his shot and finishing, he improved a lot, really. Also, his muscles, him being spending a whole summer with Jrue Holiday, a proven baller and a defensive master who could teach him stuff this summer. He will improve. But do not get me wrong, he really showed flashes of the POTENTIAL of being an amazing player. Will he become James Harden? Oh, hell no. Has Lonnie the potential to become an All-Star or at least a fring one? Definitely. Does this mean he will absolutely will? NO. What if instead we get a Jordan Clarkson type of guy? Y'all would really give up on him?  I mean, do whatever you want, y'all are rightly free to think whatever you want, but I'm just saying, I saw these type of criticism, maybe even worse one, against a Spur last season, his name is Dejounte, you know the end of the story.  * **DEVIN VASSELL**  Our rookie! Under various circumstances, Devin was able to get minutes from Pop by Day One. Also, what he brings to the table is so imporant and key in today's NBA that he could sit tbh. He's a 3&amp;D guy and he already showed really interesting flashes like that driven and small step back from like the free throw line, I love that, it shows he can develop his own shot creation too! Yeah, he still needs ton of work but for a rookie it was fine. He needs to work on not missing open looks and be more focused in order to drain them easy looks and most important thing he needs to spend most of his time this offseason in the gym. Boy is too skinny to play the 3, position I think suits him better since he's tall enough and at 2 it's not that flashy to play it, so he needs to put up muscles to play it, I think this is why he still played most of his minutes at the 2 this season. Most of our youngins that came in the Spurs environment grew in terms of muscles so I think it won't be that difficult for Devin to do so if he follows our development staff. Let's see how he behaves next season  * **DREW EUBANKS**  Drew started to play solid minutes once LMA was gone and when he was hurt. He was not amazing, yeah, but I gotta be honest that he always brings that energy that is needed. He plays good and does the things he need to to at an average level, really good for a minimun guy. I love Drew and he's such a cool dude to have around the guys here!"
"I’m a simple man. I see Keldon Johnson, I upvote."
If you count Jerami Grant responding “y’all sick” to Keldon Johnson saying yes as a no it’s even
"You’ve got it all wrong. It’s Simmons, keldon Johnson, and poeltl. With Derrick white as the starting pg. that’s our big 3. They’re counting on keldon to turn into a star."
Keldon Johnson definitely looks like his name should be Keldon.
2016: Dejountae Murray PG (29) 2020: Halliburton SG (11) 2017: Dillon brooks SF (29) 2019: Keldon Johnson PF (19) 2018: Mitchell Robinson C (18)  Spurs didn’t do all that bad considering where they were drafting tbh. A little bias picking Murray over Brogdon but I’m bias
"This game was annoying as fuck to watch. The Lakers were going through some shitty, barely give any effort but just enough to beat lottery team streaks and this random player who I’ve never heard of before just starts lighting us up. AD thought he could just sleepwalk through this game and this guy lit his ass up. The talent is real lol shoutout Keldon Johnson"
I said Morant would be my pick but a guy I’m looking to enter the discussion is Keldon Johnson.
So you’re telling me you would rather take Keldon Johnson             Over Ja Muthafuckin Morant?
So you’re telling me you would rather take Keldon Johnson than Ja Morant?
So you’re telling me you would rather take Keldon Johnson than Ja Morant?
"This would be my pick but a guy under the radar I would look at is Keldon Johnson.   He has a great coach, he plays well and I’m interested in his run in the Olympics will just give him confidence that he can be a top player because now without DeRozan and Aldridge the door is wide open for him, Murray and Walker to break through."
"You could’ve had someone like Cam Reddish, Coby White, Keldon Johnson or Kevin Porter Jr and went with Culver thats hilarious LMFAO"
"Issue with this i see is who do you poll?  Say you poll team USA, solely comprised of stars (and Keldon Johnson). Then you are only getting the perspective of stars and guys that *usually* get the calls.  Of course they aren't going to like FIBA officiating, they got less calls.    You could also poll guys like Joe Ingles, Rudy Gobert and Evan Fournier since they are quite familiar with the FIBA officiating.  But then you have the opposite problem - you're polling guys that very likely benefit from the differing rule set. I don't see those three foul baiting often if at all and their opponents (the stars) suffered from the rules.   I would be surprised if they didn't like it more.    Then you have the fact that less than 80 percent of the NBA (rough guess) would not be included in this poll, and very likely would be unable because they have not experienced or played under a FIBA rule set.    So I dont see a good way to have an accurate poll."
Keldon Johnson
Keldon Johnson. I think I was the only person I know that didn't think Keldon on the Olympic team was surprising.
"Before we start just naming players, let’s think about what kind of skillset we’re looking for. Since this team is made up of clones, both teams will be switching everything on defense, and there won’t really be any matchup hunting. Because of this, wouldn’t expect to see very many ball screens. Instead, I’d be looking for a versatile, switchable defender with a good handle, a good isolation scoring game, and solid spacing. Passing wouldn’t need to be elite, but the ability to make basic reads (drive and kick, find the open man, etc.) would be preferred, and obviously better passing is a bonus.   I don’t think he’s the WORST player (he’s very good) who would be able to do it but I would be fascinated to watch a team of 5 Scottie Pippens. Obviously the defense and passing are there, and although his career 3pt% is low, his 3pt volume and efficiency were both higher in the mid 90s and I think he could improve on his 3pt shooting if he were to devote as much time and effort to it as players do today.   People in this thread have mentioned Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton, and Paul George, who could all work pretty well I think. As a Spurs fan, I’m hoping that Keldon Johnson can develop into the kind of player who would be able to do this, but he’s obviously young and still developing, so we don’t know what he’ll look like in 5 years. Also, at 6’5”, he might just be too small to defend bigger players, even with his famous “Big Body.”   P.S. Another interesting question is who’s the BEST player who WOULDN’T succeed on a team of clones of himself. I’d be looking for players who lack defensive versatility (Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Trae Young) or lack ball handling and isolation scoring ability (Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert). All of that said, it’s hard for me to say for sure that these clone teams wouldn’t still win, given the immense amount of talent present."
Tyrese Haliburton. Saddiq Bey. Devin Vassell. Keldon Johnson.   Hopefully KZ &amp; Tyrell Terry too!
Keldon Johnson.
"Lonnie Walker is a player that has very high potential but, unfortunately, is being held down by Pop's rotation. Not to mention, the Spurs has a lot of young players that has high potential. Keldon Johnson and Dejounte Murray seems to be the future of the Spurs. But Lonnie can be a star on his own.. just not on this team."
Keldon Johnson
Keldon “Big Body” Johnson being on team USA is going to be huge for his development
Darius Garland  Keldon Johnson  Patrick Williams  Jonathan Isaac
RJ Barrett  Malik Monk  Cole Anthony  Kevin Huerter  Rui Hachimura  Christian Wood  Keldon Johnson  Justise Winslow  Pat Connaughton  Malcolm Brogdon  Anfernee Simons  Spencer Dinwiddie  Immanuel Quickley
Keldon Johnson
Keldon Johnson
"Keldon Johnson (not sure if that counts with his USA team status now), Coby White, Cam Reddish"
I truly believe in Keldon Johnson.  I a little bit believe in Jaden McDaniels
Keldon Johnson
Keldon Johnson. Whenever I watch him play I feel like there's a switch that will just go off one day when he will start playing some elite defense that will mesmerize everyone.
BIG BODY KELDON JOHNSON
"Agree with that. The potential is all there, probably this is his make year or nothing. Also Keldon Johnson is in that position."
I think if bulls end up a top 4 seed and Lonzo plays to the tune of 15/8/7  he will win provided he keeps them afloat defensively too and there aren't that many contenders.My pick would be Darius Garland if the Cavs do move sexton and he averages like 20/8/3 on 40pct from three.Dejounte could be another contender or literally any of lonnie walker him or keldon johnson from spurs tbh..i think whoever average 20 amongst them wins
[No thanks I'd rather have Keldon Johnson](https://twitter.com/redditspurs/status/1355259007490007043)
Keldon Johnson
Keldon Johnson. He's a little good at everything and will be in the league for a long time.
DJ will a huge leap and become a borderline all star. Zach Collins will turn out to be a steal. Vassell or Walker will take a huge leap forward leading to White getting traded for picks to a team who won’t accept they aren’t as good as they think they are in a desperate attempt to add some bench points. Keldon Johnson will average 23 3 &amp; 8 with his 3p% jumping to 38%.
"I'll say it...I'm extremely disappointed with the Primo pick. I really wanted Sengun who is already looking like a stud.  The Spurs already have five young G/Fs in the pipeline with Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Keldon Johnson, and Tre Jones. We also brought back Bryn Forbes for some dumbass reason.  There is absolutely no reason why we should've used the #12 pick on a 18-year old guard who will probably need two years in GLeague to be NBA ready. He was projected to go late first or early second round. He would've been a great pick at 25...but 12!?  I can only trust that Pop and the front office sees something I don't...obviously they've found diamonds in the rough before. But we left a lot of talent on the board to reach for a player who doesn't really fit right now."
"Ezeli Was drafted in 2012. The peak of Mccaw and Bell was about 10 good games in their rookie seasons, both of them regresssed their second season and are out of the league now.   The Spurs drafted Dejounte Murray, Derrick White and Keldon Johnson, all high-level starters picking at end of the first round like the Warriors."
"https://www.phillyvoice.com/nba-trade-rumors-sixers-spurs-ben-simmons-damian-lillard-blazers-daryl-morey-dejounte-murray-keldon-johnson/  &gt; Simmons, for example, has not cut off everybody in the organization, as has been suggested by several people ""in the know."" Teammates of his have said otherwise, and one of the team's photographers makes constant appearances with or around Simmons on the west coast."
"https://www.phillyvoice.com/nba-trade-rumors-sixers-spurs-ben-simmons-damian-lillard-blazers-daryl-morey-dejounte-murray-keldon-johnson/  He's not lol  &gt;Simmons, for example, has not cut off everybody in the organization, as has been suggested by several people ""in the know.""

Lonnie Walker has extremely high potential.  White and Murray already hit their ceiling imo.  It’s gonna be Lonnie or Keldon Johnson as leading scorers next year.
"Pop was on the verge of being fired when they were 6-8. There is some interesting historical drama about how that all went down replete with player's only meetings and whatnot. I don't remember all the details but certainly everyone knows how instrumental Avery Johnson was to the Spurs early success as a team leader, but people don't really know about how critical Mario Elie was...He gave the Spurs some 'dawg' and fire, pushed them to get their shit together and realize their potential.   Anyway, of course we're not contenders. The most absurd high upside pie in the sky ceiling for the Spurs next season is to somehow grab like the 6th seed on the back of Keldon or Lonnie MIP, Luka coming out of nowhere to be a rising star, and Jock ending up the steal of free agency. It could happen, but this team is most likely lottery bound. The question is whether or not we will see enough improvement from the young players to see a path forward with them or if they will have to draft well and cycle some of them out.   The Spurs draft exceptionally well, but its unclear if any of the recent picks are 'homeruns' at this point and that's the biggest question going forward."
"Good call, Keldon Johnson is another possibility"
"There's a strong contingent of Spurs fans that believe that the only way to compete is to either completely blow out the bottom and tank hard or to stockpile assets and pick off a disgruntled superstar at some point - and this tends to be a general trend in the NBA with major free agent signings becoming a secondary method to waiting until a Leonard, AD, Harden, now Dame (maybe) wants out.   It can be argued that you don't need to sign a star nor poach an unhappy one with the success of players like Giannis, Jokic, Butler, Leonard, etc as lower picks in the draft.   Further, no one believes in the 'ensemble' cast method at all and you would have a hard time convincing anyone that the 2014 Spurs were that sort of team (like that) with Tim Duncan at the head, even though he was much older and not as critical as in previous title runs. Thus, you really have to go back to the 04 Pistons and that's 18 years ago.   People are impatient. Why wait for Keldon Johnson to evolve when Ben Simmons is on the trading block? Why hope talented guys like Lonnie Walker and Luka Samanic develop when you can have a ready made star? Christ, people, we've been out of the playoffs TWO years now, this is reaching crisis level.   From my point of view, being an older fan who has enjoyed 5 championships, I'm not so desperate to roll the dice on a high risk proposition. Additionally, I get attached to high character/good people and boxing them up and shipping them out for other players is not what I want to see. Perhaps I see more value in a guy like Dejounte because I've seen him grow up as a Spur and he's certainly a passionate, hard worker that wears his heart on his sleeve - so maybe I over rate him and continue to believe he and Lonnie and Luka and Keldon, and the rest can come together and be something special together when it might not happen. My personal take is that its a risk I am willing to accept rather than shoot for the moon with a flawed star that someone else is actively trying to trade.   TL:DR - I think and hope that the Spurs plan is to develop their current young players and hope that they can have enough talent that they grow into winners rather than remaking the roster with a huge move. People like change, want new, exciting, and fresh and I think there is a bit of a civil war in the Spurs fandom currently but we'll see. Spurs FO us more or less bulletproof and can do WTF they want. If it doesn't work out, well, so be it."
"Something similar happened in the Bulls-Spurs game, interviewer asks Keldon Johnson what he thinks of Josh Primo, and he proceeds to say he can become anything on the court if he puts in the work, the generic answer everyone gives. He didn't describe a single characteristic of Primo, it's like he was trying to avoid saying anything dumb because he didn't know him."
Keldon Johnson
"Spurs need to believe one of their young players, whether it’s Murray, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, needs to become better than their current role or else they’re gonna be a pretty bad team next season. My bet is certainly on Keldon Johnson"
"Keldon Johnson has a fucking gold medal, come on"
"Him leaving us didn't mess it up it's how he left and tanked his value before even telling the team he wanted a trade. He was still being wishy washy with us. Lakers wouldn't make a serious offer with only a year left on his contract. Raptors swooped in and gave us two starters and a first for him (Keldon Johnson), and we took it to try and stay competitive for Lamarcus since he signed with us to compete. It just didn't work out but hey I like how we are set up for the future. We have a lot of movable pieces and some young talent with potential I'm not too worried that we can't get back to a top 4 seed in the West within the next few years."
Checked the Spurs summer league box score just now and saw a K. Johnson. Is Keldon Johnson on both the summer league roster and the Olympic roster?
Kawhi  PG13  Dame  Donavon Mitchell  Russ  Ja Morant  Kyrie  Derozan  Bradley Beal  Dejounte Murray  Keldon Johnson   Giannis  Patty Mills  Blake Griffin   Reggie Jackson  Oladipo  Sabonis  Bojan Bogdonavich  Mike Conley   Jimmy Butler  Rudy Gay
"Spurs coulda had Keldon Johnson and Keon Johnson. But they don't, so it's whatevs"
His name was keldon Johnson. Derek white also a scrub who got hired by nepotism
Keldon Johnson - so much usage opportunity has just opened up in SA
Keldon Johnson.
"Man I know that feeling all too well, I used to spend the summers in San Antonio with family and those spurs championships were incredible to watch. I'm a big mavs and rockets fan but I'm always glad when the spurs do good as well. I think Texas basketball is gonna have a big time resurgence soon with Luka, Jalen Green, and Keldon Johnson."
Jaylen Brown Lonnie Walker Keldon Johnson
Fultz is gonna be a stud next year. Also Jordan Poole and Ant and Keldon Johnson and Josh Jackson
Keldon Johnson
"Keldon Johnson, coming from a diehard Mavs fan. He's so hard not to root for."
Keldon Johnson. Last year he established himself as a player. He just won a gold medal and almost certainly absorbed a lot of experience there. And the Spurs are going yo struggle to score this coming season. He will have a ton of opportunity and leeway with Pop.
"May be a strange take, but I think someone like Lonnie Walker or Keldon Johnson will have a major opportunity to play big given the Spurs big offseason FA departures. Will they perform to MIP - maybe / probably not. But the minutes may lend themselves useful."
darius garland or keldon johnson
I now like Keldon Johnson now for the sole purpose of his pterodactyl screech a few days ago
Keldon Johnson- *excited high pitched shriek*
"Keldon ""American Hero"" Johnson"
I think it's much weirder that this sub is pretending that Keldon Johnson had any business being on the Olympic team than it is for me to say he didn't. He's a replacement-level player on a non-playoff team. It's not a hot take to say he shouldn't have been on Team USA.
"It's funny you make that AD comparison because they both went to kentucky. Wonder if theres any videos of a butt naked keldon johnson saying ""I love it!"""
"Also didn't they trot out Love and Beal and then they added in Javale and Keldon Johnson? Not to mention Jrue, Khris and Book joined the team as well."
They didn’t say much about Keldon Johnson not belonging on the team after that Spain exhibition either. Weird.
Marcus Smart: 13.1ppg on 53.9% TS  Keldon Johnson: 12.8ppg on 55.7% TS  The gap in defense is much greater than the gap in scoring efficiency.
"Ah yes following his first 31 games of 14/4/2 on 39/31/80, the next 41 he put up 24/5/3 on 45/35/75 while being on of the best 4th quarter scorers in the league. He also happened to have two 42 point games, being only the third rookie along with KD and LeBron to have two 40+ point games as a rookie.  But ya man the dude who finished 2nd in roty really sucked. Keldon Johnson would get thrown in the trash and driven to a dump by Pop if it meant Ant was on his team."
So aside from Tatum and Brown who is better than Keldon Johnson? You think Smart is better?
You probably think Keldon Johnson is some scrub when he have an argument forthe third best player on the Celtics lmao
I mean you’re currently melting down cause someone said something mean about keldon johnson lol
Why do you think he picked Keldon Johnson? He's gonna make the kid hand it over after his first turnover this year
Was better than Keldon Johnson.
I know that Keldon Johnson is the worst player the US has taken to the Olympics since pros started going.
"NBA stars Keldon Johnson, Javale McGee"
lmao keldon johnson jumping the gun by putting the medal on himself  pretty sure he's my favourite on this Team USA squad this year lol
"No bias too, but If we’re being honest here. If Bradley Beal never got sent home, keldon Johnson wouldn’t be in the team. Therefore Bradley Beal was the main reason USA won gold"
Nah height doesn't matter anymore. You have guards playjng like forwards and big guys playing like guards. Look at Spurs right now. They have 6'3 to 6'4 playing both PG and SG. While they have Keldon Johnson who is only 6'5 playing PF. Then you got Westbrook who is only 6'3 chasing all the rebounds. I agree with you in the fact that size should matter.but when you have 6'5 to 6'8 guys playing PF and C then 6'2 to 6'3 playing SG regularly now while 6'11 to 7'3 guys are hanging out behind the line a lot now height isn't relative to position in todays NBA for any team
"I just find it crazy that Keldon Johnson got more PT than Jerami despite averaging close to half of what Jerami averages. I get that KJ is a Pop guy, but sheesh."
Also Draymond played the Keldon Johnson/Javale McGee role last Olympics.
"sure but this roster isn't the best USA has to offer. lebron, AD, harden, KD, kawhi didn't show up. we had keldon johnson, javale, jerami grant warming the benches"
Keldon johnson was a plant so pop can continue to develop his guy in the offszn
"Not a single comment has Keldon ""Big '21 year old olympic gold medalist' Body"" Johnson on their list SMH yall tweakin"
Only lock right now is Keldon Johnson.
"Javelle Mcgee, Keldon Johnson"
That's how good the US is. Javale and Keldon Johnson were on the team too so it balances out
Couldn’t have done it with out Keldon Johnson
They “oh wow they were on the team” squad (dependent on how good keldon Johnson becomes)
Keldon johnson and javale mcgee have more olympic gold medals than steph curry. Funny how that works sometimes
Lavine   SGA  Keldon Johnson
"I don’t know, why else would you have such strong feelings about THT?   I wouldn’t go into a thread about Keldon Johnson and pretend to know I know what his potential is. I haven’t studied him close enough. Just like you haven’t studied THT enough."
"I don’t think he’s the issue in that tier. Haliburton was a monster last year. It’s ridiculous to throw THT in it. Also above 2 guys that are just clearly better than him. Like he should be 2 tiers below KPJ and Keldon Johnson, maybe more. Like he’s aleast a tier below Jaden Daniels."
"TLDR of this article - he puts him in the same tier as JJJ and tyrese haliburton, one tier above keldon johnson and kevin porter jr."
"none of the guys the spurs have drafted since then have been worth much except for keldon johnson and maybe murray. at least GSW was winning rings, what's san antonios excuse?"
"Man... you're being *reallllly* easy on your own club.  Not saying Warriors made a bad strategic decision-- you just can't really give them kudos for young guy development post 2012 draft (where they got Harrison Barnes and Draymond).   Paschall was drafted 41st and recently traded straight-up for a protected 2nd round pick-- not really a ""success"", that's breaking even.    So that leaves you with 8 years worth of opportunity, and all you've got is Jordan Poole to show for it. &lt;Sad face&gt;   Since 2013, Spurs have drafted:   2014 Kyle Anderson (30th)   2016 Dejounte Murray (29)   2017 Derrick White (29)   2018 Lonnie Walker (18)   2019 Keldon Johnson (29)   2020 Devin Vassell (11)    Too bad the Spurs didn't have an opportunity to draft at number 2.  I'm jealous."
Keldon Johnson for Tim Duncan.... Yeah for sure.
1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett 4. DeAndre Hunter 5. Darius Garland 6. Tyler Herro 7. Matisse Thybulle 8. Kevin Porter Jr. 9. Rui Hachimura 10. Keldon Johnson 11. PJ Washington 12. Luguentz Dort 13. Cameron Johnson 14. Brandon Clarke
Keldon Johnson at 24 is ridiculous
No keldon Johnson just shows you Bleacher report shouldn’t be taken seriously as we’ve seen over and over   These lists will never be 100% accurate or they won’t get as much traction
KPJ and Keldon Johnson are waaaay too low. Hunter should be closer to the top. Matisse and Herro are high.
"Wtf Thybulle ? Not sure he's even better than Dort ? And Hunter, KPJ and Keldon Johnson that low ??? Nobody in their right mind would take some replacement level centers over Keldon Johnson"
Keldon Johnson being 24 is criminal
"That's actually a pretty tough question. It's definitely between Derrick White and Dejounte based on what we saw last year IMO, but the answer could be solidified after this season. Either of them could step up their game, Keldon Johnson or Lonnie Walker will make a crazy leap this year.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm excited to see if someone steps up. Such a young team, not used to seeing this as a Spurs fan."
"Keldon Johnson is one of the best finishers through contact in the league, in fact it kinda makes him a little predictable for now because it’s all he wants to do. He’s a great player to study to see how he absorbs contact from shot blockers, hangs, and outlasts the defender to get it in over them."
I mean who do you think is gonna play more physical against him Steven Adams or Bertans? What about Valucinas and Keldon Johnson? It’s not like there are any old school 4s in the league. Him floating on the perimeter gives him less wear and tear
Yessir came here for my daily Keldon Johnson comment
"Keldon Johnson is a young, upcoming player with a bit of a bullish game. Dude isn't afraid to take it into the paint and absorb some contact.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVqJC-UgDmU"
"Lol k, simple Reddit search and...  &gt;[\[Charania\] Team USA's 12-man roster for the Tokyo Olympics: Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Zach LaVine, Kevin Love, Bam Adebayo, Draymond Green, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, Jerami Grant](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/o6jsxw/charania_team_usas_12man_roster_for_the_tokyo/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)  Oh, there's an announcement of the roster... is Love's name...

Love was on the roster... and was then replaced..."
and they got the pick that turned into Keldon Johnson.
"I understood this narrative, frustratingly when they were winning games on the back of derozan and Aldridge, 2 guys who are good players but aging and not exactly guys who will be on the team for more than 3 years.   but now? I don’t understand the narrative. Their lead players are probably 24 year old Murray, 21 year old Keldon Johnson, and the elder 27 Derrick white. If they’re a playoff/play in team again, it likely means one of their young players had a break out season and became a young player worth building around, what’s exactly the difference between them and say Memphis if this happens? And if they don’t get better, there’s no derozan or Rudy gay to bail them out and win games. It’s sink or swim with these players"
"yes?! we just took out demar, rudy, patty and added mcdermott and figurately derrick white (since he was missing last season and he is our best and most complete player) and luka samanic and add tre jones too. and add the fact that all these young guys are finally free to play instead of always rely on the vets that mostly ballhogged and after covid hit us were pretty bad (patty and rudy). also consider that our defense was extremely atrocious with demar since he was our 4 and he has no size and also he's a bad defender. and also add the fact that all these young guys gained another year of improvement and were devasted after the grizzlies game and i think they have a sense of revenge as they expressed in the interviews. they all have a nice relationship between them and i think a united team is the most important thing in competeting. and also before we got badly hit by covid, we are in the playoff range and performed well in the half of the season.  we fixed our biggest problem of last season that was spacing in the starting five and we got doug mcdermott that is one of the best active shooters in the league (i think he is 9th). he also adds size, thing we need, even tho keldon johnson grew over two inches, he said in an interview during the olympics. not saying doug is better than demar, but surely he is such a better fit and also let the other players such as dejounte and derrick and even keldon do their work, something that rarely happened when rudy, patty, demar were out there, same goes with the bench  so i'm not saying we will go out there winning tf out, but just that we are not as bad as the media and most of the fans think."
"Wait. I just realized we have enough Johnson in the league for a starting 5  Tyler Johnson, Stanley Johnson, Keldon Johnson, Alize Johnson, James Johnson  At long last! We have 5!"
I saw Keldon Johnson play high school ball. Instantly new he would be special.
There’s a lot of directions it goes but the funniest may have been the “Keldon Johnson &gt; Zion” spurs fans lol
"Barnes is more of a KG guy tho. Lanky PF that can pass and defend? Deff KG.   Stocky guy that can pass and defend is Draymond. E.g. Keldon Johnson, Grant Williams, Lu Dort."
"If the Spurs beat the Pelicans more than once this year I’ll be shocked, the best player on your team is who, Dejounte Murray? Keldon Johnson?"
"I see Murray and Keldon Johnson taking the next step for them along with Walker. Primo is a question still.   Even with all for that, the West is tough as shit. So I see them hovering below 30 wins."
"The Spurs had the least amount of 3PA attempts last year. While the Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson aren't knock down shooters, taking them out when you already lost Patty Mills and Rudy Gay leaves you with an absolutely nightmare. Bryn Forbes and Doug McDermott can help but neither of those guys are volume shooters. Due to Simmons being about the worst free point shooting guard in the regular season - at least 10% behind every other guard the last 3 seasons aside from Westbrook and RJ Barrett - where do the volume of points come from for the Spurs now? They won't scale at all by adding Simmons. If you want him to be the tank commander, fine, but I'm sure trading a combo of Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson next season will get you more in return to build around than Simmons.  Who cares if he got voted All Star? What does he bring that actually helps the Spurs improve or get to the playoffs?"
"They arguably could’ve done better but considering what they were going for I think DeRozan, Poeltl, and Keldon Johnson was a pretty suitable offer for a wantaway star in that years trade market"
"No. Kawhi had killed his value at that point. Danny was not worth a pick, he was an aging replaceable 3 and D guy on a one year deal.   And the return was solid. Demar who had his best individual seasons as a spur. The pick that became keldon Johnson. Jakob Poeltl, one of the best defensive bigs in the league. And then Demar was traded for a 1st, some 2nds, and Thaddeus Young who could net a young player or a 1st rounder"
"Dejounte Murray + Keldon Johnson  Taking into account contracts, I think this is actually really fair. I'm definitely not including any FRPs"
"This, just look at how much the Olympic team loved keldon Johnson and he was riding the bench"
"&gt;Patrick Beverly will guard Damian Lillard  This is admittedly out of date, it was true a few years ago, but I couldn't think of as obvious of an example that demonstrated the point.  &gt;so you want positions to be based on someone's height and weight   Obviously not lol, that's a horrible representation of physical profile. It's a nuanced thing, height, weight, weight distribution, wingspan, speed, lateral quickness, horizontal quickness, vertical reach, footwork, deceleration, and a million other things go into it. The best example I can think of is Keldon Johnson who is listed at 6'5"", 220 lbs, and yet he looked fine at PF this year because he's stronger than his weight would suggest and knows how to use his body to defend taller players effectively."
‘21 Keldon Johnson  “He deserved to be there”-Spurs fans
"Keldon ""BIG BODY"" Johnson! Has been getting more attention since playing in the Olympics but he is so fun to watch."
"Toronto.  We gave them Nando de Colo for Austin Daye.  Then we gave them Kawhi and Danny Green for DeMar, Jakob, and a FRP that became Keldon Johnson."
Beal is an all nba calibre in my books in his last season of his contract given next is a player option..given wizards are looking to rebuild they should be able to get 2 legit  all star potential youngish guys and 2 unprotected picks imo... Levert/Brogdon ( though neither are young) +2 picks.. Dejounte Murray+Keldon Johnson+2 picks +/- lonnie walker/derrick white.
There’s a real lack of Keldon Johnson in this post
"Poetl and ""useless pick"" which became Keldon Johnson"
Keldon Johnson
"We've also drafted several black Americans who came up through the AAU system, so the implication that Pop is somehow averse to working with those guys is bullshit. Like, what the hell do people think Keldon Johnson and Lonnie Walker were doing lol."
KELDON JOHNSON is going to be very good at basketball
"I'm pulling for Keldon Johnson, especially with his new Olympic experience. As long as he stays healthy with the way he plays."
Keldon johnson
"I was seriously debating including Devin Vassell, but he's not as far along as Keldon Johnson. Maybe next year he enters the conversation but right now he's trailing behind the other 4.  I'm very torn on Derrick White, he is 27 but he's had a few stretches where he showed that he has the potential to be a fringe All Star, but hasn't put it together yet. But to be fair he's been injured a decent chunk of the time and with DeRozan gone he's probably going to get more play. I'm waiting to see how he does next season before writing him off yet."
"OBJECTIVELY 7 more apg is better than 1 more ppg and 1 more rpg. That is OBJECTIVE.  &gt;He scored a lot more than just one more ppg, you have to skew the data to fit your narrative but once you do that it opens up more arguments.    Per 100 possessions is the best way to compare players who play similar minutes, because teams that play at a higher pace are always going to have higher counting stats and lavine plays a few more minutes per game which means you expect him to have slightly better stats.    &gt;Lavine got a ton more all star voting   Trae has been voted an all star starter as well just last year. The only reason he wasn't an all star was because he was slumping hard and the Hawks were bad up until the all star break, then they got a new coach and went on a huge run. That's actually even funnier because even with Trae crashing hard for a few weeks/months he ended up with comparable stats to lavine.   &gt;he was also recruited into the Olympic team when trey wasn't.   Is keldon Johnson better than zion now? Lol   Plus once of the selectors for team USA was the coach Trae had literally just gotten fired a few months earlier so there was obviously politics involved  &gt;Lavine was having a historic season based off efficiency.  A good player putting up elite scoring numbers on a garbage team while being a defensive sieve happens literally every year, it isn't historic. Beal/trae/booker did the same exact thing last year. All three of those players may have been slightly less efficient but either scored even more and/or had a much larger play making burden.  Once again, 7 apg is 14-21 points added which is much more than 1.ppg and whatever 1 rpg gives you, which means objectively Trae is better. If you are looking at advanced stats like ts% to try and bolster your argument, moat advanced stats also favor Trae. So that is another point in the ""objective"" category."
Keldon Johnson has been playing tons of 4 for the spurs and I kind of question that.
"What I'm saying, mind you, is based on the play patterns of a group of players with a few hundred, at most, NBA games under their belts. It also relies on Derrick White staying healthy for the majority of the season which is certainly not a safe bet.   Projecting the playing time and rate distribution for a team over the course of an entire season is difficult and the difficultly level grows exponentially with each piece in the rotation that is adjusted.   For example, if you asked me to give you the likelihood of a player leading the Dallas Mavericks in possessions used next season I would break it down something like this:   Luka Doncic - 95%  THJ - 2.5%  Kristaps Porzingis - 1.5%   Other - 1%  If I was answering the question for the Spurs it would look, roughly, like this:   Derrick White - 35%  Dejounte Murray - 30%  Keldon Johnson - 19%   Lonnie Walker - 7%   Tre Jones - 3%  Josh Primo - 2%   Devin Vassell - 1.5%   Other - 2.5%"
Keldon Johnson future all-nba
"If it helps, the players I've seen described this way are Keldon Johnson, Dillon Brooks, and Kawhi Leonard. Maybe Giannis too."
"Ok I listened to the video on my drive to work (2X speed of course) and, again, another mix of garbage and casual takes, just in a 45 minutes format, that could have done in a 10 minutes video.  Basically, this is what he is saying: Popovich, the oldest and most successful coach in the NBA history, has an inflated ego, and could only make it work with Duncan because he's a weak personality, but couldn't make it work with Kawhi because he's a strong personality, and because of that he caused the fall of the Spurs. LOL  So this entire speculation is based on the fact that Pop did not get along with a player who refused to play an entire season going against the whole team medical staff's opinion, probably exaggerating an injury, with the sole purpose of getting traded home to LA, and then, after being traded to the Raptors and winning a championship, he is the first player in history to get a ring and leave the team to sign, guess where, to LA.   And it's not like the Spurs traded Kawhi for peanuts either just to be petty, they traded a 1 year rental with injury concerns for a perennial All Star, and best player on a 59 win team on a 3 year deal (DeRozan), the 2016 9th pick in Poeltl, and another FRP which turned into Keldon Johnson. In hindsight it didn't work, but the trade wasn't that terrible back then. They just chose to keep competing instead of going with the full rebuild that a trade with LA would've entailed.  Cmon man this is like peak NBA Reddit drama. Pop cant coach strong personalities, but he just won a gold metal on a USA Olympic Team lol"
"That's why analysts and reporters touting anyone with the same body type as the ""next"" Draymond should really cut that shit. None of them had Draymond's mind and feel for the game.   I'm sure Keldon Johnson, Lu Dort, Grant Williams and Eric Paschall would have good to great careers, but to compare them to Draymond just bc they have the same body type is just lazy journalism."
"Keldon was already playing 28.5 minutes per game last season so his minutes gained upside is limited to somewhere in the range of 2-4.5 MPG based on Pop's historical preference for loose 10-11 man regular season rotations.  Keldon played 1967 minutes last season, 1380 with DeRozan on the court and 587 with DeRozan off the court. In the 1380 minutes with DeRozan on the court, he had a 19.0% usage rate and in the 587 minutes with DeRozan off the court he had a 18.4% usage rate.   Historical usage data is by far the best predictor of actual future usage and there isn't anything to lead me to believe that Keldon Johnson will use possessions at a rate that would allow him to win MIP."
"Love the NAW pick. RJ and Rui or MPJ would be other guys to watch out for.   Someone on the Spurs will have a great chance to breakout, I would go with Keldon Johnson."
Yeah NAW late season when he started averaged like 18 a game people got mad when I said a while back going forward I would have DeAndre Hunter and him in a similar tier long term but is what it is. Same thing with both you hope their most recent 15-20 game stretch carries over   How low are Wendell Carter’s odds because if they are low enough might put a few bucks on it   MPJ I could still see an offensive explosion happening to some extent. I agree SGA Zion types are waste of $$ for this. Ayton not a bad choice either   I also still like OG at +6000 may put down a few $$ on it. Rui I think those are good odds also.   Cam Johnson +6600 as a tota dark horse not terrible. I’m not huge on Gary Trent or Terrance Mann but once you get into +10000 territory it’s the type of thing worth looking at a little. Keldon Johnson +3000 and RJ Barrett +3000 a hair rich but both I might look at especially Keldon
"Cam Reddish, Saddiq Bey. Jordan Poole I'm not that sold yet, hope it was not just preseason fluke. Desmond Bane. Jordan Nwora. Mo Bamba. Tyrese Maxey. Keldon Johnson."
"There's a trade that's talked about but not enough, IMHO. That's Demar Derozan, Jakob Poetl, and a 2019 FRP for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green.   At the time of the trade, DDR was (rightfully) viewed as a negative value contract. He bounced back a bit on the Spurs but he also locked them into the treadmill of mediocrity. Poetl was intriguing and has evolved into a defensive anchor for the Spurs but isn't exactly a world beater out there. Danny Green is still one of the league's better 3&amp;D players, and Kawhi was (and is) an MVP-caliber player in his prime. Yes, he had one year left on his contract and was widely rumored to be interested in going to LA, which of course was 100% true. He was also done with San Antonio, and that forced their hand. However, they almost certainly had better offers on the table.   Overall, it was an absolute steal for the Raptors. Naïve observers saw that the Raptors got an All-Star back for Kawhi and were happy, but the correct move (in terms of winning a championship in the future) was to trade for more assets rather than chasing the 8 seed with an aging Demar Derozan. That trade happened in 2018, and the Spurs have finally accepted the invetiablity of rebuilding. Instead of having 3 years to tank, get more assets, and build a new core, they spent that time missing the playoffs or getting gentleman's swept by the Steph-less Warriors. Yes, Popovich probably didn't want to tank. At the time, there were rumors that DDR was basically a going-away present to Pop so he could retire without the bad taste of a ruined season. However, he's still the coach now, so that basically amounted to nothing. That draft pick ended up being Keldon Johnson, so time will tell how much that pick was worth. At 29th tho, the value of the pick before it happened didn't exactly make up for losing Kawhi.  From Toronto's perspective, just getting off DDR's terrible contract was a massive win. He was terrible in all of their previous playoff runs. Not only did they get off Derozan, they got Kawhi MF Leonard and Danny Green for Jakob Poetl and a 2019 FRP. It turned out to be a Kawhi rental, but that didn't matter because they won the championship. What's more, Kawhi leaving was still preferable to being stuck with Derozan's contract. Even if they hadn't won the championship, it would still have been a great move with very little opportunity cost."
"Teams tend to behave differently when they don't own their pick.  Jae Crowder going immediately into the starting lineup for instance or us taking the much more polished Clarke over riskier projects like Bazley, Nassir Little, Keldon Johnson, or Kevin Porter."
Keldon Johnson was also in the trade too
If you truly think he's their 3rd best player you're high af. Yes he's solid yes he's serviceable but Pop would rather let his young players develop. This is young's first and possibly only year on the spurs. He will be played when Keldon Johnson or Jakob is hurt. Box score stats don't always equate season to season the bulls sucked ass last year anyone could've played PF in that rotation.
"AD was incredible tonight. Took a tough shot to his knee and got shoved out of the air by Dirty Keldon Johnson, but still dominated on both ends"

Someone needs to post Westbrook damn near killing keldon Johnson and the refs acting like it didn’t happen lmfao

Spurs fan shop has all players. That’s where I got my Keldon Johnson jersey. Took a while to get shipped to Australia if I remember correctly.
Dejounte Murray or Keldon Johnson but honestly the fun part about our team is we have no idea who is going to turn up in scoring but we know someone will

Still manifesting my Keldon Johnson MIP szn  *manifest*
Keldon Johnson?
I just traded Keldon Johnson for Sengun in fantasy.  I'm all in.
Spurs played great man keldon johnson is fucking legit
If Keldon Johnson makes one more fucking contested floater I'm gonna lose my damn mind. That boy good
Call me a casual but I never realized Keldon Johnson was so good.
"You think Jarrett Allen is a 20 million dollar per year player?   You think Markkanen is worth 17?   That doesn't touch the terrible numbers Love and Rubio are on right now for a crap team.  Cedi Osman's on a bad contract.   Okoro doesn't look great, and there's debate about his long-term role. Took him over Haliburton.   It's year 3 for Windler, and he's unable to stay on the court (and has shown pretty much nothing), a guy they took over Nic Claxton, Kevin Porter Jr, Jordan Poole, and Keldon Johnson.   They don't seem to want to extend Sexton, a guy they took over SGA, Michael Porter, and Mikal Bridges.   And somehow, they're spending all of this money on big guys when they also have Evan Mobley, the guy you're actually trying to build around."
"So a couple things:   1. Time is lost by waiting.  Obviously not a day or a week, but if the season goes by without a trade, that is a lost year and Embiid, while enormously talented, is not a star player I would be patient building a team around.  He has very serious injury considerations that could limit the Sixers window.     2, The other thing that is lost is Simmons' potential fitness.  There have been guys who if they've been away from the game a certain period of time, they show back up out of shape and may not be the same player.  After the 98 lockout, Shawn Kemp gained a ton of weight and was never really the same.  Dennis Scott too, fwiw.     3. The alternative is not peanuts.  If Lillard doesn't want to be moved, its not like the alternative is just to trade Ben for some second round picks.  Other teams have younger players with some upside who could fit well with Embiid. If the Spurs for example offered Derrick White, Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson for Simmons and Curry, that seems like a good match.  Sure none of them are all stars but they could fit very well with the Sixers as it stands. And that dovetails into my last point:     4. The Bucks just proved you don't need a 'superteam' to win the championship.  They won it with an MVP player and other rotational players that fit very well with Giannis, and then they went out and got Jrue Holiday without giving up a whole lot in terms of talented players.  They got him with mostly draft picks.  So getting rotation players that fit with Embiid doesn't foreclose on the Sixers chip hopes."
I remember watching Keldon Johnson light up the Lakers last year and wondering who the hell Keldon Johnson was ✌️
idk but keldon johnson is a good looking dude tbh
Keldon Johnson is the best spurs pf in history
I like Time Lord and Keldon Johnson. Those are my choices to breakout.
MVP: Embiid  ROTY: Jalen Green  6MOY: D-Rose  MIP: Keldon Johnson  COTY: Steve Nash
"Jaren Jackson I think he can be a 20 ppg guy while being the defensive anchor and his contract may well seem a major bargain as soon as after this season  Keldon Johnson Expect him to be the spurs primary scorer and avg 20ppg while being decent allround   Someone from the Magic..wont be surprised if its Fultz, wendell or Even Isaac.. it's a case of whoever remains fit through the season imo"
Yeah I think out of all the teams I think the Spurs are probably the most realistic though I wonder if they prefer to have Poeltl on his great deal ($10m for 2 more years) given their timeline.  If they land Ayton they'd kinda be maxing out their team tho with decisions to make on Lonnie Walker and Keldon Johnson by then.  If even one of them get an extension you're over the cap and semi-committed.  Is that even a playoff team in the West?
"1. Enlist Robert Williams to invent a time machine.  2. Go back to the 2019 draft,  pick Okeke instead of Langford, Keep Thybulle, and pick Keldon Johnson instead of Grant Williams.  In 2020 pick Saddiq Bey instead of Nesmith.  3. Travel back to the future and trade Okeke, Thybulle, Johnson and Bey along with a future 1st or two for Ayton."
add Keldon Johnson into that list too
"Poole, Keldon Johnson, Davion Mitchell, Poku, hell even Hartenstein I'd put over THT lol"

"And over keldon ‘big body’ Johnson. Who will actually get minutes and usage.  Memes aside, I think Dejounte is really gonna be who takes the leap this year."
"Really?   Players from these seasons drafted 15-30 who look like they will be starters this season:   2017 - John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunony, Kyle Kuzma, Derrick White   2018 - Donte DiVincenzo, Lonnie Walker, Robert Williams   2019 - NAW, Jordan Poole, Keldon Johnson, Kevin Porter Jr   2020 - Saddiq Bey, Precious Achiuwa, Jaden McDaniels   Philly isn't drafting these guys. They're not one of the best drafting teams. They're middle of the pack. Drafting Thybulle and Maxey amongst these picks isn't outstanding."
"honestly, every team could use Derrick White, DJ Murray, Keldon Johnson, Vassell, and Poetl. every team could use  strong defense and energy."
Spurs are underrated and will fall ass backwards into playoff/play in contention   Dejounte Murray or Keldon Johnson have a breakout year and Primo surprises everyone   Lakers will choke   Bulls will make ECF
Olympic Champion Keldon Johnson
We on the Keldon Johnson hype train babyyyyy
"They are one of the tiniest markets out there that is trying to remain competitive during Pop's final years. It's not surprising that they haven't been able to fully rebuild since Kawhi screwed them back in 2018. Unlike other stars Kawhi really screwed over the Spurs by playing the injury card, demanding a trade and being clear that he would only play in LA.   Past 5 years they have gone from: team that is contending with prime Kawhi Leonard and all star LaMarcus Aldridge to rebuilding all while trying to stay competitive during Pops last few years.   They've never fully tanked and had the opportunity to draft a high lottery pick in the last 5 years, so judging them on not being able to draft a star in the 10-30th pick range is a bit of a stretch. Since 2016 they've won 67, 61, 47, 48 games and then 33 and 32 in the shortened seasons (about a 38 win season). It's hard to draft good talent when you are winning a lot of games, but even then the Spurs have done a great job at finding talent late in the draft, not just during Pop's early years but also in the last 5 years.   In the past 5 years they:   **2016**: Drafted Dejounte Murray at #29, he's blossomed into a great player, averaging 16/7/6 last year. Signed Bryn Forbes as an undrafted guy who has become a lethal 3PT shooter and highly coveted role player.   **2017**: Drafted Derrick White at #29, he just averaged 16/3/4 and has a decent 3PT shot. In a redraft he goes top 10 easily.   **2018**: Signed Drew Eubanks as an undrafted 2 way who has turned into a nice big who can play 10-15 mpg, traded a disgruntled Kawhi for DeRozan, Poeltl and a FRP, not a great trade, but if Toronto doesn't win a title that year, it goes down as an okay trade given the fact that Kawhi would've left that next offseason and Toronto would've lost their best player for nothing. They also drafted Lonnie Walker at #18, he's turned into an okay role player averaging 12 ppg last year. Then they traded DeRozan for another FRP, Thaddeus Young and Al-Farouq Aminu. Toronto got 1 year of Kawhi and a Cinderella run at a title, Spurs got 2 FRP, a starting C and PF and a 3 year rental on DeMar DeRozan. Again not a great trade but if Toronto loses in the ECF it IMO is a trade the Spurs won.   **2019**: Drafted Keldon Johnson at #29, he averaged 13/6/2 last year as a sophomore, great numbers for a near second round pick. Redraft he goes top 10.   **2020**: Drafted Devin Vassell at #11, he looked okay, averaged 6 ppg as a rookie and playing \~17 mpg. Could fizzle out, or could be a solid role player, hard to tell this early.  **2021**: Drafted Joshua Primo, time will tell if it's a good pick, Got Zach Collins and Doug McDermott for nothing,    For a small market team, that's trying to compete still and only drafting in the 20-30 range, they have done remarkably well. Continually drafting starter level players at the 29th pick is wild. If they don't think Samanic is a NBA talent they are probably right. He's a sub 28% 3PT shooter, poor rebounder, poor defender and showed no development. They've gone from imploding contender to young team with nice assets and a great shot at a top pick this year to build off. A 2-3 year rebuild is actually pretty great for a non LA/Miami/Brooklyn team."
"what pride has to do with it. going out there and try to do the best and win is simply the coach's job, whether you team is bad or a contender. we won't be very good this season, as you said, but pop literally doing his job and not tank, so intentionally lose, has nothing to do with pride.   also add the other comment over pop and our fo laughing at us for taking that offer because it was a ""win-now"" move when the offers on the table weren't much better and we do not even know what was behind. kawhi tanked his value like crazy and nobody offered much. we got a solid package considering the situation. you would come out with that brandon ingram and first package aren't you. yeah, it might have been better, maybe not. we got ourself jakob poeltl that is a top 3/5 defensive big man, we got gold medalist keldon johnson (pick given by the raptors, maybe the lakers one would have been the 30th instead of the 29th and maybe we couldn't have picked keldon) and he showed ton of potential, and we turned derozan into thaddeus young and 1 1st and 1 2nd and thad can maybe be traded for another 1st. might not be the best ,but it's definitely fine and not intended as ""win-now"" mode."
Keldon Johnson is my sleeper
"&gt;I was on the Poole-fucking-sucks train. Glad to be proven wrong.  I thought we had drafted Nick Young that couldn't even score and like you I'm delighted by his progression I am so glad that you said this because I think we have reached a point where many warriors fans are trying to act like they saw this breakout from Poole from the very beginning. We don't need to dig very far to see all the Poole slander. How many of you guys were screaming at the front office for not picking Keldon Johnson. No doubt, Poole had believers but I think too many warriors fans are try to say they saw potential in him. Poole was awful his first year. The player he is now is not who he was his first year and that's a testament to his hard work. Let's give Wiseman the same chance"
THE BIG BODY MUSTANG KELDON JOHNSON
1:Anthony Davis  2:Jokic  3:SGA  4:TH  5:Keldon Johnson  6:Kyle Lowry
1. PG - he’s the first option and will put up great stats  2. KAT - he will have a major bounce back season and remind people why he’s one of the best players in the league   3. SGA - has the ultimate green light on the thunder   4. Wiseman - bounce back year after a full offseason and finding his role in the warriors  5. Keldon Johnson - his Olympic experience will help unlock his game and help him take the next step   6. Lowry - great role as the main PG on the heat and can run the offense for them
Keldon Johnson is slept on fr he averaged 13 in his second season and he's about to get way more touches.
"PG-I think he hits mvp level production  Jokic- No Murray, not a lot of self creators on team  SGA- only thing stopping him is the team shutting him down from being too good  Halliburton- better situation than other 2  Keldon Johnson- SA going youth and he’s coming off Olympics  Lowry-Gonna be depended on more than the other 2"
AD (just definitley the best player of those 3 healthy)  Jokic (healthiest and best)  Brandon ingram (we get to see him with competent spacing around him this year)  Keldon johnson (best player rn)  Westbrook (i think lowry is getting too old)
"1. Anthony Davis, come back season. Two elite playmakers.  2. Embiid. No Simmons makes his role bigger.  3. SGA. No help.  4. Halliburton  5. Keldon Johnson. My MIP pick.  6. Not sure tbh. Russ I guess"
"Mines is Sunday  Trying to get Barnes, Keldon Johnson, Segun, and KPjr for all under $5"
Keldon Johnson
"Keldon Johnson, even though he already started to kinda breakout last year"
"He's a talented defender but he's a 20mpg player and he's 24 years old. Its a fine pick.   Look at the picks after...   Brandon Clarke 24mpg   Grant Williams 18mpg   Darius Bazley 31 mpg   Then a bit lower...   Jordan Poole 20 mpg    Keldon Johnson 29 mpg   Kevin Porter Jr 32 mpg   Nic Claxton 17 mpg   Its a fine pick. Definitely not bad, but not the best value pick in that draft range."
Yeah like I am all-in on Keldon Johnson but I feel like we should add Luka Doncic for some insurance
MVP- Trae Young  MIP-Keldon Johnson  DPOY-Anthony Davis   6MOY-NAW  ROY- Jalen Green
"NOLA will be without Zion for some time to start the season. That could easily torpedo their season.   Besides the Spurs are clearly not looking to compete this year. I can't see Pop making Murray,White and Keldon Johnson into a squad better than Ant,D'lo and KAT lol."
"Man imagine Keldon and Keon Johnson on the same team, Spurs of course"
Keldon Johnson
"Our first bust in maybe 20 years, and it was the same draft where we stole Keldon Johnson.  We really do have the best scouts in the West, if not the entire league."
"Started"" but actually it was Presti who drafted them...    &gt;You started your franchise with 3 MVPs, lost them, lost in the first round,  I think you are leaving out the part with the 4 WCF appearances and going to the finals. 1992 was the last time the blazers went to the finals btw.   &gt;then started rebuilding yet you’re up there with teams that have actually put together winning teams.  Yeah its because they were in a tough spot with the Russ + PG teams. They got solid returns while also doing right by the players. They have SGA who looks like a future all-star and they have a treasure trove of picks over the next 5 years that they can use to hunt for a second and third guy or they could trade picks if someone becomes available.   &gt;If it was about the past the Spurs wouldn’t be at the bottom  Yeah, I mean it's a little harsh on the spurs but honestly, they've been pretty middling over the last couple years with no direction. They have 1 protected first coming in over the next 5 drafts, they have a couple guys with potential (Murray is decent, Derrick white is fun but older and injury prone, Keldon Johnson has potential), but probably no future all-stars. They are going into a rebuild but it's not ideal to not have extra draft picks or a potential star. Unless they hit on in the next two drafts, it's going to be a long rebuild. They are taking flack for not trading guys earlier and starting the rebuild two years ago."
"Uhummm, that's Olympic Gold Medalist Keldon Johnson right there."

Keldon Johnson. NWA.
We already know who Dejonte Murray and Keldon Johnson are though...
"Being a good team for a year≠good organization and being a bad team for a year≠bad organization. Spurs have one of the worst teams this year, does that mean they have one of the worst organizations in the league? No obv not. They’re coaching staff, development staff, and scouts are all elite. Just look at what they’ve been doing with low draft picks like keldon Johnson and dejounte Murray. Absolute insane organization"
"What's your re-draft to include all 3 of them in the top 7? I think there's a pretty clear top 5 in Zion, Ja, RJ, Hunter and Garland, and then there's only two spots left for:  * Keldon Johnson  * Jordan Poole  * Kevin Porter Jr  * Rui Hachimura  * Tyler Herro  * PJ Washington  * Matisse Thybulle"
"Claxton at 31 still has massive potential too, in my opinion.  Kevin Porter Jr, Jordan Poole, KZ Okpala, Keldon Johnson, Nicolas Claxton is a seriously solid team of late, consecutive picks. KZ should be set to step up a bit in Miami this season."
"19-23 PPG guy  Glad he’s finally getting shine   I think MIP is between him, Keldon Johnson, Rui and KPJ (all were in the same draft class)"
"Between him, Keldon Johnson and Kevin Porter that’s a crazy trio of late round picks, and they went back to back to back in the draft"
"In last Olympics we had guys who know how to play a specific role: Javalle McGee, Draymond Greene, and Keldon Johnson (maybe others, I can't remember).   There are 2 reasons I can come up with:   1. There's significant diminishing returns on superstar players in the NBA. Like, having 5 superstar scorers on the court isn't really better than having 3.  2. Some of the internaational teams were just much better at moving without the basketball - that's a much bigger part of the Euro game than it is in the NBA. In the beginning of the tournament, we were getting killed by back-door-screens and other set plays which required a lot of movement. We got a bit better at defending it as the tourney wore on, but still had problems. And on offense we never moved beyond playing isolation basketball."
"Dude it’s the opposite. Being on the lakers is what makes them overrated. Kuzma has been talked about more than say Darius Garland the last couple of years even though Garland has star potential. People pretend Kuzma vs Tatum was an argument.   With Kuzma specifically once the Lakers got AD, he became so hyper criticized and got so much shit, everyone now acts like he’s garbage. He received too much attention in both directions because of the Lakers.  The exact same thing will likely happen with Talen Horton Tucker. He is currently in the super overrated stage. Here’s a Twitter account with a million followers saying “hot take that isn’t that hot THT will be a superstar one day.” He also is put in the top 10 in bleacher report’s 2019 re-draft ahead of guys who have shown way more like PJ Washington, Cameron Johnson, and Keldon Johnson.  [tht superstar lol ](https://twitter.com/overtime/status/1440349497096224776?s=21)  [2019 redraft](https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2948039-2019-nba-re-draft-who-follows-zion-williamson.amp.html)  For fuck’s sake the guy averaged 9 points on bad efficiency. and I’m sure 2-3 years from now when Talen Horton Tucker is a decent back-up guard after being blamed for why the Lakers failed, he will become underrated."
"Keldon Johnson was already my favorite player before he “broke out” this year, he’s too likable"
"Dejounte Murray, Primo/White/Vassell/Walker, Emoni Bates, Keldon Johnson, Chet Holmgren/Victor Wembanyama."
Kevin Porter Jr   Darius Garland  Keldon Johnson
"I think Keldon Johnson has a great shot.  Entering year 3, Pop seems to love him, and there's plenty of shots to go around."
"1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett 4. DeAndre Hunter  5. Darius Garland  6. Tyler Herro  7. PJ Washington  8. Rui Hachimura 9. Brandon Clarke  10. Matisse Thybulle 11. Keldon Johnson  12. Kevin Porter Jr   I'd take all of those guys ahead of him for sure, and then the debate for thw other two top-14 spots is between:  * Jordan Poole * Nickeil Alexander-Walker * Cam Johnson  * Cam Reddish * Darius Bazley * Nicolas Claxton * Terance Mann  * Lu Dort (whowent undrafted)  There's definitely a debate to be had, but I'd be leaning Cam Johnson and Lu Dort."
"for some reason, Keldon Johnson"
Keldon Johnson in shambles.
He has more triple doubles than Keldon Johnson and as far as I can tell Westbrook is a better player than Johnson.
I love that account name. What gives you so much hope in Keldon Johnson? I think he could go on to average 16-18ppg along with 7 rebounds but idk about a superstore
"The Spurs can build around **Keldon Johnson**  He’s a future superstar. But right now, they need to tank for at least two years.   Primo and Big Body are the only players worth keeping"
"I’d say next year forsure since it’s only his second year and this year looks like garland, porter jr and keldon Johnson or rui maybe even cam reddish"
GSW  Damion Jones -&gt; Deyonta Davis  Jacob Evans -&gt; Dzanan Musa  Jordan Poole -&gt; Keldon Johnson   James Wiseman -&gt; Lamelo Ball    I guess better with ball and worse/no change with the others?
2016: Damian Jones becomes Deyonta Davis. This is a wash.  2017: Jordan Bell technically becomes Jawun Evans. This is probably a downgrade.  2018: Jacob Evans becomes Dzanan Musa. This is probably a wash  2019: Jordan Poole becomes Keldon Johnson. This is probably a downgrade.  2020: James Wiseman becomes Lamelo Ball. This is definitely an upgrade at this point in their respective careers.
Keldon Johnson???? Lol
Keldon Johnson
Where is Keldon Johnson?
Keldon Johnson is primed for a breakout year but he does need to get better on defense
"Yeah. Might have been better if it were ""Keldon Johnson with vicious back-to-back fastbreak slams"" or something. Thanks for the clip though!"

Dejounte has been one of my favorite players for years. Spurs got this guy at 29 btw (and Keldon Johnson and Derrick White. What the fuck San Antonio).
This dude thinks Trae would provide more to Team USA than Keldon Johnson and Jerami Grant lmfao
"keldon ""nuts in your face"" johnson"
* US gold medal winning Keldon Johnson  LESSGOOOOO BIG BODY
Keldon Johnson.  Dude's main strength is his big body and his main move is just barreling to the rim for a layup/dunk.  Everything else is average or subpar
Starting to think Keldon Johnson and Derrick White might not actually be better than Trae.
"Just wanna ask, y’all remember when Pop snubbed Trae for Derrick White, and r/nba said he was better than Trae? And then when JC was snubbed for Keldon Johnson for the Olympic team, something that actually matters, and half of r/nba did it again? This one feels good, real good. Fuck Pop and fuck LP for agreeing"
Keldon Johnson is up there imo
Dejounte Murray Devin Vassell Keldon Johnson Jakob Poeltl Derek White Joshua Primo Lonnie Walker Either Doug McDermott or Drew Eubanks
"He’s only 18. Spurs like to use their G League affiliate for development of their young guys. Nothing wrong w what they’re doing (did the same with White, Walker, Keldon Johnson, Bryn Forbes, Dejounte Murray)"
"Y'all are scary good, I'm happy for the Bay Area. I still remember that 2006 Barron Davis/Jackson/Ellis/JRich team. Highly entertaining! My hope is Keldon Johnson turns out to be Draymond Green light, that'll be ideal!"
Keldon Johnson isn’t a a bad second option down at 28 at least
We got Keldon big body Johnson as a return for the trade so I can’t be *too* mad  What pissed me off personally was that he wasn’t communicating with teammates and he blew off pop and the admiral I thought that was pretty fucked up
Dejounte Murray  Devin Vassell Josh primo Keldon Johnson  Derrick white  Jakob poeltl Tre Jones  Lonnie Walker
things keldon johnson fans say
"Keldon Johnson has disappointed this season. I know he didn't see a lot of minutes at the Olympics (nor should he have), but it feels like he's just not....there right now. It actually made me switch from getting a Keldon jersey to a Devin Vassel one."
"Keldon "" Big Body"" Johnson"
Miles Bridges since it’s already happening.  Keldon Johnson because I think he’s just getting started.
"""Keldon Johnson says he's leaving San Antonio.."""
"Suns - it's honestly McGee, although Ayton and Bridges can be close. Pistons - Hami Diallo, even though he doesn't get much playing time. Thunder - Dort lately, but Bazley has the hops no one other on the team has. Wizards - I'd guess Trez, because of his intensity. Cavs - Allen right now, but Mobley can take the crown. Pacers - Isaiah Jackson?? It can't be Kelan Martin or Brogdon, right? Spurs  - Keldon Johnson and it ain't particularly close, even though Lonnie Walker might argue so. Kings - Richaun Holmes. He is a bowling ball. But Harrison Barnes can surprise you with the hops every now and then. Fox can do some mean dunks. Mavs - DFS."
But we got Jordan Bell for pennies to the dollar. It wasn’t like we gave up much for him.  And I think Poole is better than Keldon Johnson and I love Keldon Johnson.
im not watching but....did keldon johnson do this?
"Dejonte Murray hype threads have been posted the last few weeks, and I get that Spurs fans want someone to hype up, but y'all should be way more hype on Keldon Johnson than DJM.  DJM has had an increase in basic box score stats, but its only because he's increased his volume - he's still shooting at terrible efficiency.  There's a direct correlation between your primary scoring option being that inefficient and having a terrible team offense, and there's nothing telling me that DJM is worthy of being a primary scoring option.  The dots are there to be connected, but it has more to do with the fact that people don't want to connect the dots rather than a correlation not being there."
Wasn't there a whole *We should've taken Keldon Johnson* thing going on that first year?

it’s honestly amazing the spurs managed to get keldon johnson and dejounte murray at the end of the first round in their draft classes. they’re both nice asf
Is Keldon Johnson the greatest shooter of all time?!

"Ok being a middle tier team still means you don’t have the opportunity to draft great talent.  Like if we’re doing a redraft how much do they regret Keldon Johnson at 29?  Vassell just turned 21 and looks good.  Dejounte Murray looks great. The Lonnie Walker pick hasn’t looked great but I’m sure Spurs fans aren’t too down for missing on Huerter or Okogie.  Weird way to frame things, OP, almost seems like you have an agenda 🤔.  Edit: Keldon Johnson autocorrect"
"Absolutely. It's such a strange formula for success that keeps working.  In the past decade, they've had back-half FRPs pan out like nobody's business.   Kyle Anderson, Cory Joseph, Derrick White, Keldon Johnson, and Lonnie Walker. None of these guys had any significant playing time their rookie year. Maybe they know something we don't."
"Best aspect: Dejounte Murray's breakout, being competitive in most games.  Worst aspect: Keldon Johnson and Derrick White being off shooters, inability to close out games."

"Magic commentators in the entire 2nd quarter be like   ""Hey did you know what picks were used to draft Keldon Johnson, Derrick White, and Dejounte Murray?""  [Twenty Nine](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/spongebob/images/e/ee/New_Student_Starfish_087.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20190822081634)"
I didn't know this was to make fun of Kidd. It was still funny at the time though. Boban was just following Keldon Johnson (the inbounder)  around. It was the Spurs player who was in the wrong spot to inbound (this was after an airballed FT so guys weren't sure where to go).
"Porzingis for Keldon Johnson, who says no?"
"This is complete rubbish. Leonard asked for a trade from the Spurs, he was telling people he had a leg injury that made him miss a season. That injury was described by the Spurs as degenerative tendonitis. The Spurs still got a huge haul in DeRozen, Jakob Poeltl, and the pick that became Keldon Johnson. And supposedly the Spurs lost that trade.  Simmons has more value than Leonard had."
"ayy I’d put him below Ja and Zion, and above RJ Barrett and Darius Garland  Keldon Johnson 6"
OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST KELDON JOHNSON
"I don't mean to toot our own horn too much, but this makes what the Spurs have done even more exceptional.   Obviously you have huge success stories like Tony Parker or Manu Ginobili....but even in the last 10-ish years we've pulled guys like George Hill, Cory Joseph, Aron Baynes, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Keldon Johnson, Tre Jones, etc...out of the late first to second rounds, or even undrafted.  Our last three lottery picks were Kawhi (15th), Devin Vassell (14th), and Josh Primo (12th).   Kawhi is obviously Kawhi, Vassell is looking great in his 2nd year, and Primo shows all the signs of a young star in the making.   Sure, we've had some whiffs like Luka Samanic, but that is a lot of success stories coming that late in the draft."
"As you say, dont think they move THT.  Fairly decent is a way to put it, assuming health. The fit issues are still real though. A bunch of guys who either can't shoot reliably, or can't defend reliably. Or both in the case of Melo/Russ (yes, I know Melo's shooting 50% from 3 right now - still). THT exacerbates that as well. He fights on defense but isnt very good there... and he's a bit like Keldon Johnson in that he's GREAT attacking the rim but very limited from anywhere else."

"Gordon did a great job on Ant. No shame in that for Ant, since Gordon has locked up basically everyone he’s guarded this year.  Keldon Johnson is the only person to get more than 4 points on him this year lol"
"That was you, who told me I hadn't been watching all these games because you couldn't conceive of yourself being wrong.  Did you see Keldon Johnson ""shoot"" that 3 just now? lmao  He must be 1 for 20 on the year."
"Hmm, I wonder how many championship the Spurs won while Kawhi was here. We also got DeMar, Poeltl and frp (Keldon Johnson) from you guys, so thanks. I wonder what the Raptors got from the Clippers? lol"
keldon johnson will retire this offseason
Patty Mills &amp; Keldon Johnson  (until Derrick White’s back)
Probably Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson. Aldridge's defense has gotten so bad I'm not even sure he's a top 4 player on our team anymore.

Keldon Johnson has been really surprising too and extremely efficient
"2nd year Keldon v 2nd year Tatum is honestly a pretty interesting debate. I haven't watched the Spurs much this year but I saw a few Tatum games that year and the kid clearly had 'it' - that ability to just get shit done. But, at the same time, he wasn't a star yet and made some real bad decisions. Would love to hear from some Spurs fans and some folks who watched the Celtics beyond the playoffs that year.  Johnson being better than Ingram or Tatum rn is, ofc, laughable."
What does that have to do with that take? Do you think Keldon Johnson is better than Tatum? Tf 😂
Guy a couple of days ago said Keldon Johnson was better than Tatum and Ingram. That was pretty bad
"definitley. when I was writing the article I had these names specifically in mind, but looking at these comments is really eye opening. So many more players I could've put on the list. Dort, Keldon Johnson, Grant, Sexton, and many more"
I want Keldon Johnson to hang 40 on his sorry ass as a retirement present in Kawhi’s final playoff series   He’s not coming back so I’m not even entertaining the what if. He incinerated every bridge possible on the way out. Why say I would kiss and make up if it’s clear that would never happen.

Keldon johnson too
"May I introduce you to: Dejounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, and Lonnie Walker."
And keldon Johnson eventually
Him and Keldon Johnson are next up 🗣
Lmao they had Christian Wood and Keldon Johnson
"If you play DFS, you already know all about Keldon Johnson."
"I think either Keldon Johnson or DeJounte Murray (so far).  Keldon seems like a for sure 10+ year player. His on-ball defense, his rebounding, his driving, his motor, it’s all already reeeally good. His 3pt flashes also seem like he can be a consistent 3pt threat too down the line. This is also essentially still his rookie year, as he only started playing in those 8 Bubble games the Spurs had. If he can learn how to create his own shot and draw more fouls, he will be a PROBLEM.  DeJounte Murray seems close but not over the hill of being a fringe All-Star. He’s good at drives, midrange shooting, on AND off ball defense, rebounding, and assisting. His problem is more his consistency. Some nights he’s brought it all and looks good, some nights he looks shook and awkward and lost. His motor and instincts need some work, and while he is a capable shooter and driver, it’s not reliable day in and day out. I believe he’ll get there soon, maybe even later this season.  Lonnie has major potential, but I’m not the most optimistic of Spurs fans about him. His speed and athleticism are amazing, and the tools to be an elite shooter and scorer in the paint ARE THERE, however, I’m feeling less confident it’ll all come to fruition. His BBIQ is low and his instincts are bad. So many times he second guesses himself, tries to do too much, and loses confidence in games. Pop always needs a ballhandler on the court with him because he (rightfully) doesn’t trust Lonnie to do things on his own. And while he’s still young and can improve on these, there doesn’t seem to have been any, so I’m not betting on it.  Devin Vassell looks great so far. He’s a prototypical long defensive wing with good instincts that can shoot from three. He reminds me a lot of Jerami Grant. He seems like a guarantee future starter in this league. Not much else to say about his ceiling yet since he hasn’t had that many minutes on the court, but almost all Spurs fans like him so far.  TLDR; Keldon or DeJounte."

Eh I know everyone's on the Keldon bandwagon but Williams seems more important to the Celtics core than Johnson would be. Pretty easy to defend that pick
Should’ve gave it to Keldon Johnson

GG Spurs bros. Keldon Johnson is something else man you guys got a fun team that’s definitely making a run at the playoffs. The interior defense was the difference maker today. LMA just let too much by him.
I wanna personally thank Danny Ainge for passing on Keldon Johnson 3 FUCKING TIMES
"Keldon ""LeBron James"" Johnson and LaMarcus ""6'10 JR Smith"" Aldridge"
Keldon Johnson
CAN WE GET KELDON JOHNSON SOME HELP??
keldon johnson is good
"Lonnie Walker, Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson are pretty damn good"
"not sure the spurs are covering themselves in glory this game  man im not trying to be negative but it keeps happening. hard to consider this game good from either side, outside of keldon johnson"
"is that keldon johnson? hes been good  but the comment was ""so many good young players""  and like... this game has been pure garbage"
Keldon fucking Johnson
Jesus keldon Johnson!
"We had the 28th pick in 2018, and the 28th and 41st pick in 2019.   In 2018, we picked Evans (28) who was a bust. Missed out on MitchRob, Devonte Graham, and Trent Jr in 2018, but so did everyone else.  In 2019, we picked Poole (28) who it's too early to say anything about, and Paschall (41) who made all rookie first team. We also traded 2nd rounders to get Smailagic (39) in 2019, which hasn't really paid off. Nobody notable who we passed on except Keldon Johnson who looks pretty good for the Spurs  Wiseman will be the first true test of our FO. We'll see how it turns out"
No but if you sort by FGA against bron on stats.nba hes been mainly contesting derizan but then guys like keldon Johnson kyle anderson Brandon Clarke etc
Here are the players Lebron has primarily guarded this season:  DeMar DeRozan  Derrick Jones Jr.  Kyle Anderson  Keldon Johnson  Brandon Clarke  Tim Hardaway Jr.  Lonnie Walker IV  Rudy Gay  Eric Gordon  Devin Vassell  Coby White  Wendell Carter Jr.
This is almost certainly due to types of players LeBron guards and the types of shots they take: 48% of the shots against him have been 3PA.  Here are all the players who have taken 3+ shots against LeBron this year:  * DeMar DeRozan * Derrick Jones Jr. * Kyle Anderson * Keldon Johnson * Brandon Clarke * Tim Hardaway Jr. * Lonnie Walker IV * Rudy Gay * Eric Gordon * Devin Vassell * Coby White * Wendell Carter Jr.
"&gt; two 22 year olds on the way up with a high ceiling  lmfao when will people realize Lonzo is NOT good. And people forget we got 2 picks out of them, one of them is Keldon Johnson. He didn't sabotage the franchise but yeah I agree he definitely didn't help them either not taking Ingram. Hopefully we can throw a max at John Collins"
"Bruh I knew who Keldon Johnson was before you lmao. Watched him at Kentucky. I know he’s good, but in any way to say he’s equal to Ingram or to Compare him to Tatum and Brown is stupid"
Having the Spurs at number 2 was bad enough and made me think this post was another Spurs fan overrating tf outta our young core but seeing shit like Keldon fucking Johnson (whom I love) is equal to 23 Y/O all star BI &amp; Keldon having a higher ceiling than Tatum is clear proof this is just shit tier trolling.
Tatum is 22 and averaging 27 a game. He almost went to the finals leading a team in scoring in the playoffs at 20 years old. What aaa Keldon Johnson doing at 20?
The planet where I’ve seen every spurs game to realize Keldon’s potential..? You’ll learn his name soon enough. Can’t wait till Keldon gives it To Tatum and Brown when we face off. Gonna be glorious. Learn his name. Keldon. Johnson.
Remember when Tatum was 19 and stuffing it into LeBron's face on Game 7 of the ECF?  Tatum was an All-NBA guy on his 21 year old season. I don't think Keldon Johnson will get there lol.
On what planet is Keldon Johnson equal to Brandon Ingram?
Keldon Johnson
"A number of slightly lower level players such as Dort or Keldon Johnson seem to have retained their growth. It seems like a lot of the guys who fell off were guys who had big usage numbers and were just suddenly making more of the shots they had been taking. But also, it's been 10ish games and teams didn't get much of a training camp or preseason to get in shape, so I wouldn't judge everyone too harshly yet."
"Keldon Johnson, but he didn’t really play at all prior to the bubble."
"On a much smaller scale, Keldon Johnson."
Keldon Johnson already is.
"You are on to something there. Ive seen the term 'next kawhi'  used for Hachimura, OG, Keldon Johnson."
Wild how a player you built your entire franchise around spontaneously requesting a trade with one year left under contract while leaking to the media he won’t sign anywhere but LA actually makes it really hard to stay competitive at the same level  I’m just happy as fuck we have a fun to watch team right now and have a new franchise cornerstone in Keldon Johnson as a result of the trade. Learn his name and you probably don’t make this post.
Welcome to the world of Keldon Johnson as well
G: Dejounte Murray  G: Lonnie Walker  F: Keldon Johnson  F: DeMar DeRozan  C: Lamarcus Aldridge
"It got a 25 year old franchise its first ever title.  barring keldon Johnson becoming the next Michael jordan, I think toronto fans will be happy with this outcome."
I was watching one of those first 2 game against the lakers and many times on defense they’d have Keldon Johnson guarding LeBron. Seems like an odd choice but it didn’t appear he was getting bullied by any means.
"Spurs have taken Kyle Anderson, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, and Keldon Johnson with the 29th picks. Hell of a run there."
Keldon Johnson x6
"Could probably benefit from the services of Keldon Johnson and Jakob Poeltl, too.  WELP"
Spurs fans - how has Keldon Johnson been? I believe he’s the pick that the Spurs got in the Kawhi trade?
Spurs fans - how has Keldon Johnson been? I believe he’s the pick that the Spurs got in the Kawhi trade?
My only knowledge of Keldon Johnson is having a Keldon Johnson fan page on twitter say the Bulls would be lucky to draft him at 4 a couple of years ago.
"Keldon johnson is averaging more points in his 2nd year than White ever has. I think it's going to be Keldon Johnson and a lot of the young guys are really solid and can average 12+ a game (White, Dejounte, Walker, Devin)"
"A lot of this is play style.  Last year, Belinelli, Trey Lyles, and Forbes were always drifting around the perimeter waiting for Derozan kickouts.  Now, Beli and Forbes are gone, and Lyles is halfway to China.  Dejounte, Keldon Johnson, and Lonnie Walker are actively getting buckets and driving, and Derozan is finding himself with a few wide-open threes.  The team is actively encouraging he and Aldridge to let it fly."
"Maybe a homer pick but I'd say Keldon Johnson. We've been playing him at the 4 even tho he's 6'5 6'6, he rebounds on both ends, plays tough d, knocks down the 3, doesn't need any plays ran for him to score or be engaged. Not a strong ball handler but good enough to beat the average defender"
"Stunning offensive performance by the Spurs and LMA specifically given all the hate he's been getting from Spurs fans.   Their distribution of scoring and the depth of scoring options they have is pretty incredible, reminds me of Miami of last year in that way, 7 different players averaging double digit PPG.   Furthermore, I just really like their roster construction right now, they have a clear 10-man rotation that just makes sense in the way the pieces fit together and they have the right combination of youth and experience. I like the balance of having 2 vets in each of the starting lineup and the bench, as well as the fact that they have each of their promising two-way wings in the starting lineup (Johnson) and bench (Vassell) . I'll definitely be watching more Spurs games from now on, that's for damn sure.   Murray / Walker / Johnson / DeRozan / Aldridge - 5 out offense, gives max spacing for DeRozan and Murray to operate.  Mills / White / Vassell / Gay / Poeltl - Mills + White is a really good backcourt pairing, skills complement each other well, Vassell is good backup for Keldon, and Rudy is a good backup for DeRozan, and Poeltl gives them something different as an energy big that can rim run."
I'm not seeing Keldon Johnson scoring 28 tonight like he did last week. I'm sure that's what r/lakers meant. Just getting torched by the usual suspects this game
As long as keldon Johnson regresses too we should be fine
My favorite thing about watching Keldon Johnson play is whenever he scores I get to yell BIG BODY at my tv
I love how tough Pop is on Keldon Johnson.
Keldon Johnson has a big body
Maxey future all star.     Brown &gt; tatum long term.     Embiid MVP.     Keldon Johnson and dejounte are future all stars.     Beals gone in the offseason.     Pacers make the finals.

Keldon Johnson doesn't waste a single second. Dude always catches the and goes straight to the hoop. It's once he catches the ball he becomes a magnet attracted to the hoop
"Vassell is legit, so is Keldon Johnson"
Keldon fucking Johnson
Keldon Johnson is a fucking savage
I promise you Pop wants this W over Leonard he called that TO and yelled at Keldon Johnson like we're the ones getting blown out
Keldon Johnson about to lock him tf up
"I am bias but I agree. I don't think people get the gravity of what he does for our offense. Even in recognition he's underrated.   My true ""under the radar"" pick would be Keldon Johnson for the Spurs. He's averaging 16/2/7.5 on 49/43/86 splits plus 1.5 steals per game while playing 30 MPG."
Keldon Johnson is gonna be a star

Keldon Johnson
Randomly stopped in the 200s and saw he had Gorgui Dieng 1 spot higher than Keldon Johnson and that bothered me quite a bit

I'm embarrassed that Keldon Johnson has to play with this shit ass team. Holy shit that was embarrassing.    * Keldon is already better than 90% of the league and 100% of the Spurs roster   * Jak/Lyles/Eubanks should have never been a Spur for this long for how shit they are   * There is the Dejounte I know! 4pts amazing    * Lonnie is just too timid and stuck doing nothing   No one else matters on this team enough to give a shit about.
My boy Keldon Johnson getting the respect
Keldon Johnson has a bright future.
Excuse me but I think you forgot about Keldon Johnson and Jakob Poeltl
"I agree Jackson is arguably the better coach, but the way this worded makes Pop seem carried by Duncan and blames him for Kawhi which is 100% not true. Duncan as good as he was wasn't the reason Tony Parker, Ginobili, Kawhi all developed into good players. This also doesn't take into account the insane amount of player Pop brought the best out of players like Patty Mills, Keldon Johnson, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, George Hill, Danny Green, Dejuan Blair, and the list goes on. The guy is a minimum Top 5 coach all time minimum and I would go even as far as to say he's probably higher than that. I think the idea that he's overrated is just simply not true."
"If you’re a young team with a good salary situation for the next three years (San Antonio, Charlotte, Sacramento) — and you’re a small market that can’t really attract those big named FAs — you go for it. By the time Haliburton, Lamelo, and Keldon Johnson are due for contract extensions, Allen will only have one year left on his deal.  I’ll eat my hat if he goes to any team other than those three (or Cleveland)"
You also got keldon Johnson pick if i recall
"Lol okay buddy, Pop's retiring soon enough, Kawhi already told y'all you ain't shit, and no free agent is coming to San Antonio. Can't wait to see a Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson core hoist up the Larry O'Brien. 🤣"
"We definitely lost that one and it's okay to say it. A ring compared to DeMar, Jak and an admittedly very promising but not a star quite yet Keldon Johnson is one sided"
"Exiling him to Canada was pretty funny, and it gave us Keldon Johnson so there's that"
keldon johnson\*
"I see what you mean, but even in college Kawhi had a post game and defenders did not want to guard him when he’s driving to the bucket.   Bridges, and Keldon Johnson with the Spurs, seem more like solid logic players versus players that make others scared to defend. They both just make really smart decisions with the ball, can shoot, and can recognize the easy layup opportunity. I feel like I’m watching a 2K controlled player when I watch them, they make consistently make the simple logical read and execute."
"glad to see some positive takes on the comment section here!  i'll answer op tho. no, we definitely not. i gotta say that we really went undercover this season, i really doubt ppl saw spurs games outside of when their favourite team played us, maybe even not. we are currently seen as a trash team, it's easy to see everyone calling us out to ""click the rebuilding button"" but the situation here is way different from the common understading of us. i even made a extremely long [**post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) if you wanna give it a try! ^(i don't wanna  pass for a spammer lmoa, but that's my complete point of view, just if you want) . Anyway, what ppl mainly do not realize IMO is our core. It seems crazy to me how much even spurs fans undervalue the potential of our young guns, and also that we have ton of them. My main counterpoint is this: OP falls into the same trap kinda everyone fall into: not give them enough time. (it's not a dissing, chill out, sorry if i ever offend you in any way, not my intention) There have ton of bad coincidences in our development route and if you don't follow the Spurs with attention it's easy to miss them. We don't do the same things other teams do, rookies do not get playing time, vets eat young players' playing time. I'll go player by player: Keldon Johnson just finished his sophomore season, but in his rookie year he only played in the bubble for us, he did'nt even played three digits games in the NBA! And he was played out of his position too, guarding crazy opponets like Zion, AD, LBJ, literally always the best forward on the opposing team. DJ spent his rookie season in the G-League, then got a solid amount of minutes in the second season, he torn his ACL in preaseaon headed to his 3rd season, he came back after this devastating injury and already Spurs fans wanted to give up on him because he did not perform that well, and last season he was clearly our briightest young player. Oh, he was in the 2nd Defensive Team according to bball-index. Derrick White again spent his rookie season in the G-League, then got solid minutes because of DJ's injury, in the third season then played ok, but in the Bubble showed a crazy improvement (check out his stats there) and was clearly our best player, even arguably better than DeMar; this season tho he injured his foot twice, his toe twice, got COVID, injured his ankle, could stay healthy; he did need time to get back to his bubble form and when he did man he was amazing, just again clearly our best player. Assuming he stays healthy, dude is a baller, cannot wait till he get recognized. Devin Vassell, our rookie, our 4th lottery pick ever, seems like everyoen forgot about him, which is crazy. Dude is arugably one of the best defender in the team and even his rookie class, jsut amazing. He got COVID and then he couldn't buy a shot. Also, he didn't get those many minutes, again, for the reason I explained before, we tend to overplay the vets. Definitely a bright future. Lonnie Walker is a polarizing player in the sub, but probalby got asked to do too much, but he absolutely he didn't play that well, but now let's not act like he was complete garbage. Obviously he needs to work a lot this offseason, especially on defense and BBIQ plays, but he really stepped up in terms of offense, he polished his jumpshot and his ability to finish at the rim. He came to the league as a raw talent, spent his first year in Austin, second one barely got minutes because of Forbes, Belinelli, COVID. Last season he finally got minutes and he did ok, maybe not as much as everyone expected, himself included. Next season I gonna be really important for Lonnie! I think that he could be able to have good defensive player with him on the court that can help him and cover his weaknesses. Also, he will come off the bench and won't start. So playing against weaker opponents, being probably the go-to-guy oon offense off the bench, without DeRozan who is not a good defender and instead have Tre and Devin, extremely valid defender, will help him. If he still struggle a lot, decisions have to be taken, definitely. I'm still a huge believer. Then Jakob Poeltl stepped up this season and has been a really good player for us, an underrated defender, i think the best one in terms of contesting the shots under the rim in the whole league, he got into the 3rd defensive team for bbal-index too! Consider also dudes like Tre Jones and Luka Samanic who have a solid chance to be good role players for us too.  I also gotta admit the we didn't rightly used our resources yeah. DeMar clearly do not fit us and we should have traded him before and the deadline was our last chance, unless we pull an extension-and-trade, we will lose him for nothing, we could have gotten at least a Pick around 20s. Also we misplayed many players that damaged our young guys fit in the team. for example by playing bad defenders like forbes and demar, dj had had a tough time that season, and this was mad clear, white should have played alongside dj like we do now. in the bubble jakob showed how aldridge wasn't good for us anymore and we should have traded him immediately, we did not and lost him for nothing. also this season, lonnie and demar were bad defensibily, it was clear also that keldon was playing outside of his natural position. i do not wanna sound like an homer lmao, even thoon my inside i know i am at least a little bit, but this is my point of view.  TLDR: so yeah, it comes down to ajust these things and finally move on and leave the keys to the young guys even if it means lose more. i think tho he ready to at least compete for the 8th seed, these guys are really mad hungry and have the right mentality to get to the next level one day, we just need to give them time and the right playing time! cannot wait for next season! also, we have ton of cap space. oh, i urge you again to watch my full post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)"
"Excuse me sir, We in fact got Keldon “Big Body” Johnson in the Kawhi trade. How does it feel to have had Durant, Harden, and Westbrook on the same roster and yet fail to win a ring?"
"Trade away Demar not Dejounte. Keep the young coreof Dejounte, Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell and Luka Samanic.  Then have Chip Engelland work with Ben on that shot."
Nah Kawhi was whack for that I definitely have rooted against him on other teams because. Also the literally everyone most Suns hated on the Spurs are pretty much gone now.  I even like players like Keldon Johnson and Demar Derozan.
"Spurs got some really likeable guys like Keldon Johnson and some really entertaining players like Derrick White, DeRozan, and Dejounte Murray. End of the boring era?"
"Nah I was being sarcastic, his draft resume is extremely unimpressive outside of CJ and Dame.    He's failed to find quality starters through the draft. You can make excuses for any draft pick, but he's whiffed on Collins and Swanigan. Trent Jr. was a good find. Simons and Little are meh. And he's missed on players like Donovan Mitchell, Keldon Johnson, Bam, and KPJ recently.    A good GM needs to be able to occasionally hit on SOME of these picks. It's been 8 years and the best you can say is that certain picks were decent. How many of these guys were in Portland's playoff rotation?"
I’m surprised Wood even chose Houston  We were looking like a mess with Westbrook and Harden wanting out but he deceived to come here. I love him for that.  Keldon Johnson looks good tho. Major steak in the 19 draft
"The Spurs need a Center more than they need a PF, Rudy Gay and Keldon Johnson play that position well imo."
"Very fair. Forgot he existed cuz of melo. But, melo can run offense/score on his own against the second team which is valuable if dame and CJ are on the bench. Powell does that if melo is gone? It seemed like that’s how yalls offense ran anyway.  Like for the spurs: the young guys would give the ball to demar every time he’s in the game cuz he’s demar. But when demar was hurt those same young guys (looking at you Lonnie walker, dejounte, and keldon Johnson) would score better than demar and we would win games.  Maybe y’all will have addition by subtraction like we did at times last year"
How exactly are the Spurs loaded with non- shooters?   Poeltl and Keldon Johnson are the only ones I can think of.
Keldon Johnson
"&gt;Spurs...would have to include a Derozan SnT  I don't think so, I think the Spurs could put together a package centered in their young guys that would be pretty compelling. Dejounte Murray does a lot of what Simmons does (obviously not as well but still pretty well), but is a lot cheaper and has some semblance of a half court offense for example, then there's wings like Keldon Johnson, Lonnie Walker, or Devin Vassell who would all fit with Embiid really well. Plus the Spurs have the cap space to make salary matching pretty easy.  The only question is if the Spurs are willing to make the trade, they're obviously historically very stingy."
Keldon Johnson or KPJ
Dejounte lost a season due to an ACL tear and came into this season and developed a mid range jumper when prior to this year he had no offensive game. Keldon Johnson is still young and can work on his shot but hes got time. Those are the only 2 outside of DeMar that need to work on their 3 point shot.
He’s not better on offense than KPJ and Keldon Johnson is close at least
"That's because we don't have anyone who is worth building around. Dejounte is a nice player, but he still can't consistently shoot the ball and he'll be 25 at the start of the season. He's not going to morph into an All-NBA guard at this point.  Derrick White looks like he's best suited to be a 3rd guard, has trouble staying healthy, and he'll be 27 in a couple of weeks. This might just be who he is. The ceiling for that backcourt isn't a title. Then what do we have? Lonnie Walker is one of the worst rotation players in the NBA on both ends.  Keldon Johnson gets lost on defense and can't shoot yet. Devin Vassel looks like a role player.  Jakob Poeltl is a 25 MPG defensive center who can't do shit on offense.   I have never been high on Ben Simmons, but he's better than anybody on our roster."
"Fleeced? Green was underperforming for several seasons and Kawhi was obviously not wanting to be here anymore. From that low point in their values, we got: DeMar, who has led our team, Poeltl, who is a great defensive center for us, and the pick that would become Keldon Johnson, a player that is still growing and already contributing in major ways for the Spurs. So we got rid of a disgruntled player who tanked his own value and an old vet who was only able to play good fastbreak defense for us at that point, and turned it into three important parts of the current team.  &amp;#x200B;  To me, it seems like unless we account for packages that were only ever rumors (mainly the one involving the Lakers), the Spurs just got the best value that they possibly could there. What am I missing that you see?"
"FWIW some of it is totally self inflicted. Trading Kawhi to Toronto just to spite the Lakers really bit y'all in the ass, Spurs could be sitting on a lineup of:   C: Center signed in FA  PF: Dāvis Bertāns / Rudy Gay  SF: Brandon Ingram / Keldon Johnson  SG: Lonzo Ball / Derrick White  PG: Dejounte Murray   but some of it is out of y'alls control. Letting Bertāns walk to sign Morris and then Morris bails last minute wasn't y'alls fault."
"That's a very simpleton way of looking things  1) How has Pop done WITH Duncan. He got 5 rings with Duncan in a small market - one less than MJ. Other top 10 players either have less or played in LA. You think every FO is getting 5 rings with Duncan lol?   How many rings did Cavs get with Lebron his first 10 years there? How about Wolves with KG? Mavs with Dirk? OKC with their big 3.  2) Even after Duncan, Pop got motherfucking Kawhi till he quit on the team. How did he get Kawhi? He got George Hill with the 29th pick and traded it up for the 12th two years later. He basically got Kawhi with the 29th pick.   3) Even after Kawhi has left he's gotten great play out of the team. Look at this roster and they outperformed this year. But, they've still found great talent at the 29th pick with Keldon Johnson, White, DJM, etc."
"It's not. And I didn't say it's bad. As I said I like Moses.   However, YOUR point is that the 16th pick is essentially useless.   Yet the guy you use went undrafted in 2019.   In 2019 could've taken guys like Thybulle, keldon Johnson, KPJ, Moses, etc    In 2020 could've gotten you the likes of Precious, Saddiq, Isaiah Stewart, Maxey, McDaniels,     2021 mocks could have the 16 potentially land the likes of Kai Jones, Isaiah Jackson, Zaire Williams, Josh Giddey, Garuba    Hardly a pick with no value lol"
"I don't think so. Prior to the all-star break and covid destroying our season we were as high as 4th in the West and had a top 10 defense. On top of that Dallas is a mess right now, Houston is bad for the next 2 to 3 years, and OKC has potential but no guarantees.  Going forward:  Dejounte at 24 is an all-defense level guard who can give you 15/8/6. Keldon Johnson is 21 and going to average 15/10 next year. Jak is 25 and is a top 5 defensive center at the worst. Derrick White is 27 and is a very good two-way guard who gives you 15/5/5.  We also have a 22 year old Lonnie Walker 6th man, a 21 year old Devin Vassell who is already a good 3&amp;D wing, and a 21 year old Luka Samanic.  That by itself is a good foundation of youth that has one or two all-star level talents (DJ and Keldon) and 3 or 4 very good role players. We also have 50 million in cap space (assuming Derozan and Gay walk), the GOAT coach, and a lottery pick in a deep draft.  If even one top 25 player came in a trade or FA we'd be looking at a guaranteed playoff seed (above the play-in cut off)."
"i would take Pop over say a Carmelo/Chris Bosh type of player. When I say Pop I mean the whole Spurs FO that was able to scout, develop, coach Tony, Manu, Kawhi,  Derrick White, Tiago, Keldon Johnson, George Hill, DeJuan Blair, Dejounte Murray, Danny Green (cut by the worst team in the league), Aaron Baynes, Boban, Patty Mills (never played meaningful mins in Portland), Jonathan Simmons"
"Said this in a comment the other day, there are so many talented young players that could be playing a major role for our team, instead of letting KD lead the team he could spare some of the offensive load. No offense to Keldon Johnson but like man we could do way better. Ayton John Collins, Bridges, Randle, Ingram, Zion... so much wasted potential this year."
"I would bet that you haven’t watched much Keldon Johnson. I am a huge Spurs fan and watched most Spurs games this year. Keldon is an absolute dog. Awesome defender, amazing at attacking the rim, and a solid shooter. He will be a great fit on the team in my opinion"
lol Keldon Johnson?
"They’ve already selected the majority of the team, which means they’ve already contacted a load of people who already told them “no” once, so the list is already narrowed down to other Select Team and cut Senior Team members. Keldon already earned a promotion over all but two other select team members (Saddiq Bey and Darius Garland joined him on the team) and has been practicing with the team for weeks already.  On top of that, the Olympics opening ceremonies start 5 days after their last scrimmage which is this Sunday (and realistically the ceremonies start 4 days after their last game since they have to cross the international date line).   Are you really that surprised that they moved quickly on this one? In this day and age, it is not complicated to contact a list of 10-20 people (spitballing a number there) and get responses back within one day. Especially considering the aforementioned fact that Johnson is already in game shape and has been practicing with the team for weeks? He’s not even the 30th option for this last roster spot if all conditions were ideal, but these conditions are pretty obviously not ideal."
keldon johnson is better than javale at least
He's 23 dude. He is the best d Robinson at this point you can just proudly state you don't know who Keldon Johnson is and make that a reason why he's a bad choice?
I am now a Keldon Johnson fan
Am I the only one who has never heard of keldon Johnson before
Am i the only one asking who the fuck is Keldon Johnson?
I'm so glad we got Javale McGee and Keldon Johnson to play meaningful minutes  You think those are first tier stars?
Who tf is Keldon Johnson?
Who the hell is Keldon Johnson
"is it bad that I had no idea who Keldon Johnson was before googling him a minute ago.  I hope he balls out tho, young guy on a big stage gotta seize the opportunity"
Remember the name Keldon Johnson for he will be a superstar
Yes. Both Keldon Johnson and Javale McGee aren't top 200 players in the USA.
Who the fuck is keldon johnson lol
"Sure, and all those players would have been better options than Keldon Johnson and Javale McGee"
"IDK, we've been seeing a lot of Pop hires on these teams. Derrick White and Keldon Johnson don't really have a place on these teams.   It looks like Pop is giving his own guys a leg up at the expense of the roster."
Do these MF’s want to win? Keldon Johnson? Javale McGee? If Chuck was playing guess where they play he’d get these both wrong I can guarantee
I don't even know who Keldon Johnson is. People really don't want to play that bad huh?
"• Yeah that’s literally where my brain went and something Cuban would totally do. I remember he wanted to form a big three with KP, Luka, and Vucci. Dude is a nut. 😂  • Spurs are severely needing a power forward and Collins fits the timeline of Murray &amp; Keldon Johnson perfectly. Kinda contradicts my Kemba to SA prediction but that’s more or less a shot in the dark with Kemba. I think of all the teams with the cap to sign Collins, the Spurs make the most sense.  • Knicks I explained earlier but it’s a temporary big three of Randle, Derozan &amp; Barrett and then next year you ship Derozan + picks for a younger better player. That way you don’t have to move Barrett or Randle when you go and make that godfather offer for another star.  • Dame would be Sabonis, Brogdon, 13 and some change. Puts Lillard with Lavert, Warren &amp; Turner. It’s a darkhorse prediction but I think they definitely have the assets to make a move if they wanted to. If they tried to package Brogdon &amp; 13 for Simmons I can see them making a package for Lillard too  • Explaining Wiggins to Toronto — he gets sent home with Wiseman + 7 + 2022 1st + 2026 1st (top-8 protected) for Pascal Siakam 🤔"
"&gt;	Fire Greg Pop, this is embarrassing. What in the world is Keldon Johnson doing on this team.  Do you think you know more about putting together a team than pop? I’m genuinely confused why you and everyone else is so outraged, y’all look dumb as hell"
Yeah players like javale McGee and Keldon Johnson should never make the Olympic team unless like 60 players decline. A national embarrassment to an already shitty team. This teams shit
Who is Keldon Johnson.
KELDON JOHNSON!?
"Who is Keldon Johnson, legitimately asking. Don't feel like getting off Reddit to look it up"
"I’m aware thanks, I’ve been following the games. He was playing as a fill-in for the NBA Finals players not actually on the 12 man roster. Kind of a big difference there.  I know the home team fans love their own players but Keldon Johnson over Trae Young and some other players is a joke and you know it."
"I watch a lot of basketball but I honestly had to look up who Keldon Johnson is. I guess I'm not watching a lot of Spurs games.   Trae Young is available and wants to play, and he just torched people in the playoffs. The fact that he's not part of the team makes no sense."
Keldon Johnson
"Keldon Johnson is actually pretty good, he’s just not there yet. I am genuinely chocked by McGee though"
"100% yes.  Let's also keep in mind that McGee is now 33 and like a decade past his ""peak"".  Like I knew he was still floating around the NBA because a big man can always find a job until they can't run down the court anymore, but yikes.  Keldon Johnson is at least an up and comer.  Not wildly different from the token college player.  He's a surprising add, but I really think the team is running out of options at this point."
Team USA couldn't arrange for better than Keldon Johnson and JaVale McGee? Wow....Just Wow.
"Yeah I have no problem with them taking someone from the Select Team who put in the work and elevating them to fill an empty spot. No reason to doubt Keldon Johnson earned his spot and no reason to question Pop's integrity. Just because it looks suspicious to some people doesn't mean it is. Until someone who was in those practices questions it, I'm not going to."
"Since NBA players joined in 1992, here’s all the Team USA olympians who never made an all star team:  - Richard Jefferson (2004)  - Lamar Odom (2004)  - Emeka Okafor (2004)  - Tayshaun Prince (2008)  - Harrison Barnes (2016)  Using those guys as a benchmark…yeah, Keldon Johnson and JaVale seem worse."
Give me [this](https://gyazo.com/a27518b6135c6355cbc4c962d31b6f85) over Keldon Johnson and Javale McGee any day.
So the story that best sums up Keldon Johnson is a time he made a joke?
Who the fuck is Keldon Johnson??
Spurs fans in that other thread are acting like Keldon Johnson is Scottie Pippen. Lmao this island of misfit toys is not gonna win gold
Also the reason I didn’t bother offering an alternative is because you wouldn’t accept it because you’re a massive homer who thinks Keldon Johnson should be on Team USA
"This is fair, but it’s a team with clear needs and another wing wasn’t one of them. It’s really the one place on the team they’re completely stacked, what they needed was a rim defender, which realistically McGee should provide so it’s not the craziest pick, and they needed a playmaker which Keldon Johnson is not. Even if guys like Trae said no because they weren’t asked in the first place it would be better to get a guy like TJ McConnel than Keldon Johnson who has no business getting minutes over the guys ahead of him."
"Pop choosing his own player in Keldon Johnson over other, better young American guards like Trae Young, De'Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, or even LaMelo Ball is just laughable. Not that I'm surprised after Pop chose Derrick fucking White over Fox for the terrible 2019 FIBA team lol what a joke."
"You love to see the Keldon Johnson pickup. Especially right after Lloyd Pierce went on his rant about how they didn't grab Trae because you need to be a veteran and earn your spot on team USA.  Keldon is literally 21. Trae is 22. For the record, I love Keldon I just think that that this is a bad look right after that statement."
Keldon Johnson is another great option. i'm just gonna start answering all questions like this with the last player i've seen discussed on the subreddit
"Yeah because keldon johnson and mcgee will start over bam, draymond, tatum, book, and middleton.   Why are you mad for 2 bench warmer spots?"
Jimmy Butler PR company presents - Keldon Johnson
"Not really. Nigeria’s leading scorer, Gabe Vincent, averages 12 minutes a game in the NBA. Josh Okogie averages 5 ppg in the NBA. Chimezie Metu averages 6 ppg.    Mills and Ingles are legit NBA players, but they’re role players. This whole thread is full of jokes about Keldon Johnson, and he’s better than anybody on either Australia or Nigeria. Team USA played 7 NBA All Stars."
It’s not even about that. It’s the fact that pop chose keldon fucking johnson when there are better players available
He wants to play with keldon Johnson and javale... @spurs
Keldon Johnson over Trae Young and Ja Morant.  Are we trying to lose?
Did Keldon Johnson kill your family or something? You’re acting like this is the worst thing to happen in the history of basketball.
"…and they just added KELDON Johnson, another Spur, so yeah."
Who’s Keldon Johnson
tell you one thing hes a better player than keldon johnson. too bad he isn't  a spur! lmao
You probably talked to one Spurs fan who is an idiot. There were definitely better options talent-wise than Keldon Johnson.
Keldon Johnson is beside himself. Driving around downtown San Antonio biting (thru shark skin) Shark’s family for address to Team USA Camp.
"&gt;Alright, I'll bite. Who is Keldon Johnson  He'll bite you first, apparently."
So if we’re losing Keldon Johnson will just simply bite the competition. No way we lose
"we got keldon johnson, jerami grant on the team, no room for trae"
"Imagine bringing in Keldon Johnson... even if that was the type of player that the team needed, Marcus Smart has international experience from last year."
"Alright, I'll bite. Who is Keldon Johnson"
"I didn’t see they picked up Keldon Johnson when I commented this. I agree with you, it’s a joke."
"Ja def left team USA on read.  Still don't know why they didn't have Trae, Ja, Fox since Beal dropped out and they still have Keldon Johnson.  They could do with Trae's playmaking, hell if defense is a concern they could've use Lonzo if anything."
McGee is fine. Who in their fucking right mind made the idiotic decision to bring in Keldon Johnson??
"Yeah because keldon johnson will play in front of book, middleton, tatum and lillard.   This team is already better than 2019 fiba team with or without keldon and javale. If they aren't winning a medal i'll be suprised"
"Yeah let’s just all shit on Keldon Johnson because this is all his fault!!! KJ will literally be perfect for this team, 0 ego, will outwork anyone on the court and will do whatever it takes for his team to win. Of course I want to see Trae Young and some others play but you can say that about literally any olympics team ever…. You think Kenneth Farried was the best available player?? Good to have glue guys with no ego sometimes too boys"
They are pros. They can play in a week. That spot is a bench warmer spot anyway so it should go to a good young talent like trae so he can learn the ropes. Keldon Johnson shouldn’t have been picked over trae young in any universe. This is pop picking Derrick fucking white over fox last year all over again. He has A Track recoord of this shit
There are tons of players better. Lonzo ball is even better and does what Keldon does but better. This is a clear bias pick. Woj literally said “there is Keldon Johnson love in the coaching room”
"""I've never seen Keldon Johnson play, so he must SUCK!"""
Why do that when you can just proudly state you don't know who Keldon Johnson is and make that a reason why he's a bad choice?
Spurs fans are trying to tell me that there really aren’t better options. Keldon Johnson isn’t even top 10 at his position.
Would I have preferred if Trae Young or De’Aaron Fox was on the team rather then Keldon Johnson absolutely yes I would
This settles the debate. Keldon Johnson &gt; Trae Young. At least in my unbiased opinion
Because I don’t have to provide another player for you to know Keldon Johnson had no business playing on team USA
"Lamelo, fox, trae and Ja all weren’t selected. Your telling me Keldon fucking Johnson is better then these 4?"
"Nah, I’m ok with USA taking inferior players and picking favourites.   We saw how they ended up in 2019 the last time Popps played favourite taking a Spurs guy that had no business being on the team.  Funny that this isn’t the first time Popps did this and you are still acting like Keldon Johnson being on the Spurs means nothing"
Who tf is Keldon Johnson
Yeah he’s certainly no worse than Love tbh. Love can space the floor but he still sucks on defense.   Keldon Johnson is a joke. Pop really playing favorites so blatantly?
JaVale might be 1st team All-NBA locker room chemistry. Keldon Johnson...nepotism? Not sure why Trae Young or Ja Morant isn't on this team.
This Team USA front office has to be the worst all time. Sooo many players way more deserving than JaVale McGee and Keldon Johnson smh. Should be favorites still but I can see this team underachieving...esp after watching those first 2 exhibition games
keldon johnson is a scrub
"Keldon ""We have Zion at Home"" Johnson"
"I mean, I know I'm not as in the loop as I used to be here but... who the fuck is Keldon Johnson"
Pop 100% picked Keldon Johnson like a dumbass.
Why Keldon Johnson over Saddiq Bey?
They needed a big man. The Keldon Johnson addition I don’t understand at all
This team is booty cheeks. All the prowess the USA has in basketball and they choose Keldon Johnson and Javale McGee
This man wasn’t even on the select team. Patrick Williams and Keldon Johnson are way more deserving. We may not even get bronze 🥴
Keldon Johnson is an Olympian. JaVale McGee is an Olympian. Trae Young isn't.
"Keldon Johnson I understand, having a 3&amp;D guy is always useful.  But Javale ? Like I hope it just means every decent center from Jarrett Allen, to Dan Gafford said no."
Went from Beal and Love to Keldon Johnson and JAVALEEE MCGEEEE
"Fire Greg Pop, this is embarrassing.   What in the world is Keldon Johnson doing on this team."
Spurs fanboy bias. Keldon Johnson is not worthy of an olympic roster spot. No way around it.
"I mean why take a scrub like Trae, Ja, or Zion when you can take the GOAT Keldon Johnson"
&gt;Please tell him ~~not~~ to put keldon johnson on the USA team   Fixed
"Pop should ""step down"" right after these games. Embarrassing for USA basketball. Keldon Johnson over all the other players available is a goddamn joke. Nepotism at it's finest."
"Well he's picking future MVP Keldon Johnson, so this meets 1 of your criterias, not bad"
Please tell him not to put keldon johnson on the USA team
"Instead of Trae Young and Zion, they are going to take Duncan Robinson and Keldon Johnson…"
Obviously Derrick white and Keldon Johnson are better than anyone Pop could use as replacements
What system do you truly need when your 8th player is better than their #1.   Why the hell are Derrick White and Keldon Johnson even near a Team USA practice let alone the rosters.
"&gt;Keldon Johnson   Despite everyone's having a hard on on him, I don't think he could reach an all-star level.  Kuzma had a fantastic rookie season as well, but yet here we are now."
"Bro -   A: you think the 22nd pick will be garbage?? This draft is really deep in mid-tier prospects who could have a lot of upside! I've seen guys like Jared Butler, Ziarre Williams, etc mocked there. Sure, not anything we can get Lillard for, but those are the kinds of upside swings which have a chance at producing high-level players that a rebuilding team should be stocking up on. Didn't ya'll just pull Keldon Johnson from that deep two years ago?  B: who, that has real trade assets better than that first + a young-ish player who still has some upside, is going to trade for Derozan this offseason?"
Honestly though which team is better?  2020 US Olympics team vs 2020 US players not participating  2020 Team:  Bam Adebayo  Devin Booker  Keldon Johnson  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Draymond Green  Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine  Damien Lilaird  Javalle McGee  Khris Middleton  Jayson Tatum    NOT PARTICIPATING:  Lebron James  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Steph Curry  Chris Paul  Bradley Beal  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Julius Randle  Russell Westbrook
"Ok you're right, I wish my team was building around Keldon Johnson and Dejounte Murray"
"Keldon ""Victory Cigar"" Johnson!"
anyone know why keldon johnson hasnt played?
Keldon Johnson is on the team
Keldon Johnson
"I'm torn. I want to watch keldon johnson, but I don't want to watch this terrible terrible game anymore"
Send keldon Johnson home and bring Vince in
Keldon johnson gonna drop 60
"Preach. The fact that LaVine, Keldon Johnson, and JaVale McGee made the cut is beyond me"
"Get rid Lillard, Booker, LaVine, Keldon Johnson, JaVale McGee and replace them with Trae, Westbrook, Steph, Zion, Jimmy Butler       Get rid of Popovich and Lloyd Pierce and replace them with Coach K and Steve Kerr"
"Spurs fans simp so hard for Keldon Johnson, acting like this bum deserves to be in the fucking OLYMPICS. Dude put up 2 points and a rebound in 10 minutes"
Keldon Johnson came from that pick not White but agreed in general
"yo Don't take Keldon Johnson from the Spurs, Dray."
"Players drafted after Culver that may be better than Culver :   Coby White, Hachimura, Cam Johnson, Cam Reddish, PJ Washington, Tyler Herro, NAW, Okeke, Sekou, Goga, Bazley, Poole, Keldon Johnson, KPJ, Paschall, THT"
"Why would they need him? They have Damian ""8 assists per game"" Lillard and Keldon ""Big Body"" Johnson on the team. Surely they aren't missing Trae's playmaking in any way right?"
"Rotation needs to be cut down by a lot. No need to be playing Keldon Johnson 9 mins. KD was in a bit of foul trouble vs France which can explain why he only played 20 mins, but he needs to be playing 30+ in important games going forward. One of Bam/Draymond needs to be on the floor at all times in any important game. I really don’t see the need for Lavine to be starting or even playing at all. Middleton, Holiday, and Booker are strictly better and should take over all of his minutes by the elimination stage.   The next two games for Team USA should be easy to win, so Pop should use those 2 games to get a fixed gameplay/style of play and to find the right number of players in the shortened rotation. The biggest problem is there is no identity with this team. It’s not even the lack of chemistry - it’s not like Luka played with Mike Tobey prior to the Olympic Qualifying Tournament. Matisse Thybulle never played with Australia prior to the Olympics. The Nigeria team that beat Team USA in the exhibition had even fewer reps playing with each other than the US team did. It’s just that guys like Mike Tobey and Matisse Thybulle know their role.   Players like Jayson Tatum, Zach Lavine, Devin Booker, etc. don’t know their role on this team - it needs to be made clear to them they play defense and play more of a 3rd/4th option to KD/Lillard on offense or they get benched. That’s why it’s easier for Jrue Holiday to adjust - he already played this role with the Bucks, unlike the other stars who were #1 options on their teams. And if you don’t want to bench or threaten to bench Jayson Tatum or Zach Lavine for the entire game because they are “too good” be benched, well that’s why they won’t win."
What do you mean? You've got Keldon Johnson.
"Well seemingly we didn't because Kswhi went out of his way to tank his trade value. Knowing that and with the power of hindsight getting DeMar, Keldon Johnson and Jakob Poeltl in that trade wasn't that bad"
Olympic hero Keldon Johnson for one
*Keldon Johnson noises*
"Exactly. This is just a bad team filled with guys who haven’t played together.   Kevin love, Keldon Johnson, javale, these guys are barely nba players.   Not to mention useless chuckers like Lavine. It’s a bad roster"
"Jarret Allen, Bradley Beal, Middleton, Durant, LaVine, Seth Curry, Kevin Huerter, DeJounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, DeAndre Ayton, Trae Young.   I would be running a ton."
"Yes it is. Who else actually makes it? Javale McGee is a for real NBA veteran. Nobody is taking Vincent Poirier over him. And we'll see with Keldon Johnson.   Otherwise, dear God, all of the halfway decent French players barely had a cup of coffee in the NBA. Yabusele was on the Celtics, my favorite team, and I never even learned his first name.   Like, if you really wanna split hairs over whether you'd take our very last nepotism fueled roster filler over Maine Red Claw's finest circa 2018, like... whatever man."
I think him and Keldon Johnson could really shine together next year
Keldon Johnson is gonna catch some people by surprise next year
"this team USA would be better off losing early so we get kicked in the ass and get a foolproof wake up call that this team dogwater.       Need to cut out deadweight players such as Lillard, Booker, Lavine, Javale McGee, Keldon Johnson and replace team with players that can playmake or actually give a shit like Trae, Zion, Jimmy Butler, Westbrook, or Steph       Also Popovich and Floyd Pierce can take their return flights to the States right now really. Get a real coach like Coach K from Duke or Steve Kerr in"
"I really don’t mind this team but I woulda put Trae, Steph (build chemistry) and LeBron b/c of experience and probably Zion in place of Javale and Embiid for Keldon Johnson"
Keldon Johnson and Javale McGee wouldn't qualify for the dream teams' waterboys.  And they're getting valuable minutes on this team
Tbh even having Robin Lopez on this team would have been a huge difference. What is Keldon Johnson doing on this roster?
"Have... have you seen the roster? This isn’t Pop’s fault, the rest of the world has gotten much better over the past few years, and we have FUCKING JAVALE MCGEE AND KELDON JOHNSON ON OUR OLYMPIC TEAM. Like come on, look at the list of players who denied the invitation and maybe you’d understand why they’re not performing"
Draw up a play to put in Keldon Johnson and Javale McGee 15 minutes more than Jerami Grant
"What can Pop do when the 40 of the top American players all flake out on the team in 2019? The only notable roster cut was Bam Adebayo to make room for Mason Plumlee (egregious, yeah yeah).  Here's the [whole list] (https://i.gyazo.com/7ca4f08d4c0157b509462f1ff5e1ea93.png) of guys who didn't go though.  And I get the blowback against picking Keldon Johnson, but he was on the Select team and at least was already with the team when they lost Beal."
"Trae Wood Randle Zion and BI wanted to play but were denied  Team USA preferred Kevin Love, Keldon Johnson, and Javale McGee lmao"
"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/team-usa-basketball-olympic-roster-damian-lillard-kevin-durant-among-final-12-man-squad-heading-to-tokyo/  Listed are the players who declined and the players listed as ""finalists"" who are undoubtedly better players and a better fit than Mcgee and Keldon Johnson."
"Okay let's look at the 2012 team. Lebron joined right after an MVP and FMVP season. Kd, Westbrook, and Harden joined after the Finals. Kobe and CP3 joined after the 2nd round. Melo joined after the 1st round. All these guys played a full season.  This year we have Kd joining after the 2nd round, and Lillard, Tatum, and Bam joining after the 1st round. Draymond, Javale, Lavine, Keldon Johnson, and Grant didn't even play in the playoffs.  &gt;As opposed to players like Booker and Holiday who’s season literally ended last week.  These guys are bench players and aren't the reason team USA will win or lose. Moreover, the burden these players carried is less than the burden Durant and James carried before the 2012 Olympics."
That Keldon Johnson is on this team is frankly obscene.
LeBron wouldn’t help their chances over Keldon Johnson ??? 💀💀💀
"Why don't the US ever put a full strength team forward?? The arrogance of assuming any team we put out will win is astounding.  In 1992 NBA players were fighting for the opportunity to make the olympic team, but now players think it's not worth their time.  How can we call this an olympic level US team with no James Harden, Lebron James, Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, Chris Paul or Bradley Beal?????  But instead we got Keldon Johnson, Javalle Mcgee and Draymond Green? Are you kidding me???"

"With all due respect to JaVale McGee, Keldon Johnson, Jrue Holiday (who played well), and even my home team guy Jerami Grant, I wouldn't lose much sleep if I were presented with the opportunity to replace them with healthy versions of Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kawhi Leonard."
"You literally do not know what the negotiations were. Reports were that the Lakers made an opening offer, then Pop responded with [a counter offer so absurd](https://thespun.com/news/spurs-lakers-kawhi-leonard-trade-package/amp) that it gave the Lakers the impression that [he'd slammed the door in their faces.](https://twitter.com/ramonashelburne/status/1009885902435278848?s=19) Reports later came out from Woj that Pop had taken a stance that [he would not have traded Kawhi to the Lakers under any circumstances.](https://news4sanantonio.com/amp/sports/spurs-zone/spurs-reportedly-would-not-trade-kawhi-leonard-to-lakers-no-matter-what)  So if you're wondering why the Lakers never got beyond that initial offer, now you know. But for the sake of argument, let's say all the Spurs got was Brandon Ingram and a pick. Isn't that better than Poeltl and a pick? Ingram is a 23 year old All Star under contract for the next 4 years. Wouldn't you rather have Ingram? DeRozan is likely gone, and you could have drafted Keldon Johnson with the Lakers pick just as easy as you did with the Raptors' 29th pick. Who else is left? I'd rather have Ingram personally."
It sounds like Popovich wants to actually coach and the players want to treat it like an All-Star game. Ironically that’s how the roster was built and why everyone lost their minds when Keldon Johnson was added. KJ fits an important role on this team and brings a ton of energy off the bench. Pop may be biased toward the San Antonio guy but it’s not anything egregious.
Best I can do is Keldon Johnson lmao
Perhaps I'm missing the sarcasm but I think we might be able to replace Javale McGee with Anthony Davis. And maybe Keldon Johnson sits for Kawhi?
"There’s conflicting reports what the Lakers actually offered, and some of the offerings were pretty bad in retrospect.  Also, Poeltl has matured into an elite defender by every impact metric I’ve seen, and Keldon Johnson wound up as a solid throw-in.  That’s honestly not bad for a guy who we had to trade, and whose health was a major cause for concern."
"Shut up bro you dont know what you are talking about.  Pop constructed this shit show of a roster himself, he hand selected players himself.  Inviting Love over any other big man was a huge joke then when he left the team he asks McGee and Keldon fucking Johnson.  What about Jarrett Allen, Christian Wood, Turner, or Julius Randle?  What about Ja Morant?  He made his bed and this loss will be a huge stain on his coaching record and may finally open people's eyes to the fact that Pop is no where near Phil Jackson or any of the other great coaches.  His managerial moves are overrated as well. He directly played a hand in getting DeRozan instead of Lonzo/Ingram/Kuzma/Hart which would have set the Spurs up nicely instead of watching DeRozan (thus Kawhi) walk away with nothing.  He has no idea how to manage superstars or egos in the modern NBA and was a horrible choice to coach this team. Just dumb."
"He’s the one who tells them what to do and he’s the one that picked this garbage roster.   Jermari Grant, Zach LaVine, Draymond Green, JaVale McGee, and Keldon Johnson over Ja Morant, Trae Young, Julius Randle, Russell Westbrook, and Zion Williamson??? Oh yeah, big brain time for sure."
"Keldon Johnson was just out there exercising, it's hilarious how hard Spurs fans simp for this bum like he's deserving of a roster spot"
"It's always been that way. Usually the 12 man roster is at least half comprised of top 12 players. This year we have two, maybe 3 if you count Tatum. Our Olympic team is never going to have strong chemistry like these other national teams, so if we're not flexing nuts on the world with wave after wave of superstars, we're fucked. This roster is a complete joke, how the fuck is Jrue 2nd on the team in rebounds? Lmao @ the ppl in this sub who were trying to say Keldon Johnson and Javale McGee were worthy of making the team. 2 points and 1 rebound combined from those bums."
Colangelo randomly decided to select Keldon Johnson to the team?
Would’ve been cool to have someone like Trae who has an elite floater and isn’t afraid to drive on big centers. But I guess Keldon Johnson is just as good
Agree this team is too iso heavy and probably too three point reliant but even with both of those being true Keldon Johnson and Trae Young are not the same level of player
"Been knowing that. Of ALL the players you can have, you pick Javale McGee and Keldon Johnson?"
"Pop is one of the main people in charge of picking the rosters though, do you think Derrick White and Keldon Johnson just randomly appeared on the squads?"
Embarrassing roster. Wth is Keldon Johnson?
Lmao imagine Pop bringing LP on as an assistant coach. And then adding randos like keldon johnson and javale mcgee. Embarrassing
Keldon Johnson dropped 0/1/1 today and you’re still defending the pick
"This is what happens when you have Jerami Grant, Keldon Johnson, Javale McGee, and Bam Adebayo  Their WORST player should be Middleton or Booker."
"Why is Keldon Johnson on the roster? It looks to me like Pop is using this as an opportunity to help develop a young player on his Spurs roster, rather than putting the best combination of talent to win."
Clearly you don’t recall the Keldon Johnson game vs Spain last week. He was huge for them
Could have had Trae and decided on Keldon Johnson.
"I don’t think Keldon Johnson would be the best player on most of the teams in the Olympics, maybe Japan or Iran."
"No, I read on this sub the other day that Keldon Johnson totally deserves a place on this team.   Pop would never play favorites with the roster. The likes of Derrick White and Keldon Johnson are just better than Trae or Fox."
NBA All-Stars?   Devin Booker  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Zach LaVine  JaVale McGee  Jrue Holiday  Bam Adebayo  Khris Middleton  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Draymond Green  Keldon Johnson  There are no better players in USA than these? Only one I even know is Kevin Durant.
Keldon Johnson needs minutes
Keldon Johnson needed minutes
Grant played 0 minutes to free up space for Keldon Johnson
"His nepotism hurts the team so badly. Imagine Trae young instead of Derrick white in the fiba World Cup, or Literally anyone over keldon johnson"
Very silly especially when you consider Pop played midget Keldon Johnson at the 4 for almost a whole quarter and he went -11. Grant is USA’s longest &amp; most versatile defender &amp; hits open shots. Baffling
Ah yeah Kangz really funny. Pop and his team are embarrassing the US. First US Olympic basketball loss since 2004. Please try to defend selecting mediocre Spurs player Keldon Johnson over the at least 60 better US players.
"Keep making excuses for Pop. He’s one of the greats but since taking over coaching Team USA our teams have consistently underperformed. A team of 12 NBA all-stars and for some stupid reason Keldon Johnson (Pop playing favorites) and Javale McGee (I honestly don’t know) shouldn’t be losing games to a team with Evan Fournier and Gobert as their best players. I know teams like France tend to be more cohesive than the US, but Pop deserves a ton of blame here along with his players (especially KD and Dame)."
Gotta revisit that thread from the other day where this sub was dunking on anyone who said Keldon johnson wasn’t a major addition to the team
Keldon Johnson &gt; Trae Young should be enough in of itself.
"""what is a Keldon Johnson"" bro fuck outta here these are humans you're talking about"
All of the ones that included Keldon Johnson lol Jerami Grant didn’t play.
"No playmaker? The combination of Dame, KD, and Tatum more than makes up for a small guard with a healing ankle that isn’t going to get NBA baby calls in the Olympic Games. Keldon Johnson is a capable defender and can put up some points too. His size makes him more versatile in international play."
the roster filled with nba all stars is weak? stop making excuses for ur system coach. dude played bum keldon johnson over middleton
"Lol, because its defensible that a team with no playmaker has Keldon Johnson and not Trae Young."
"Kyrie, Trae, Harden - Bro that's the same iteration of everyone on this team.   Kwahi - Cmon now man lol.   Mitchell - Did you not watch the 2019 World Cup?  AD - Hurt.   Ayton - He's from the Bahamas.   Dwight - Lol that's getting desparate.  Collins maybe legit? He never gets enough respect so US politics would've kept him out.   Zion's an interesting take. His physicality would've matched international play decently.  TL;DR - There is no one else dude. Maybe Keldon Johnson and McGee were reaches, but the rest of the international teams have been playing with each other since they were 16 years old. They're just actually good now."
"No clearly USA needed Keldon Johnson over any of those guys, Pop is embarrassing the entire country. Assuming this poor play continues this absolutely should and will affect his legacy."
Really didnt understand why they replaced Beal with  Keldon Johnson instead of Garland given the lack of PG in their roster. Well.. I think i kinda understand i just dont want to admit it
Pop even taking Keldon Johnson shows he prioritizes his own player’s development over this Olympics’ team
"For one, not play Keldon Johnson 9 mins when Jerami Grant hasn’t played at all"
That Keldon Johnson pick looking real nice right now.
man played keldon johnson 10 minutes in an olympic basketball game and he had the worst + - on the team crazy
That’s what you get when you put Keldon Johnson on the floor and let Jerami Grant rack up a DNP
keldon johnson
Playing keldon johnson when grant is rotting on the bench. Pop made many mistakes today
KELDON JOHNSON BIG BODY BIG BODY NEPOTISM
Yeah freakin Keldon Johnson got minutes over Jerami Grant.
Man could have had Ja or Trae vs Keldon Johnson. USA gonna win bronze because of his stupid decisions to coddle Lloyd Pierce
KELDON JOHNSON
They didn't take Trae Young or Ja Morant and instead went with Keldon Johnson. It's going to kill them.
because the coaching staff wanted keldon johnson and javale mcgee
keldon johnson
Keldon Johnson and Javale getting minutes over Jerami Grant is just disrespectful
Keldon Johnson
"JaVale McGee, Keldon Johnson, and Jerami Grant join Harrison Barnes as gold medalists"
"JaVale McGee, Keldon Johnson, and Jerami Grant join Harrison Barnes as gold medalists."
"KELDON ""OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST"" JOHNSON"
[Keldon Johnson rn](https://streamable.com/f4oyfy)
\# of Gold Medals  Keldon Johnson: 1  Tim Duncan: 0  I think it speaks for itself
Congrats on that gold medal Jerami Grant and Keldon Johnson.
Keldon Johnson 23 seconds away from having more gold medals than Tim Duncan.
When this game is over I want a supercut of all the Jerami Grant + Keldon Johnson handshakes after being denied high fives
Keldon Johnson and its NOT close
Lol y'all see Booker miss Keldon Johnson with the high five twice and Jerami Grant giving him two handshakes
Keldon Johnson is the one that shouldn't have been called up you mean?
Give me those Keldon Johnson odds for sure. He is gonna have a strong year.
"During training camp when Keldon Johnson was rookie, a local reporter asked him if any players kind of stood out or had surprised him.    He answered DeRozan.  And specifically mentioned strength, iirc."
"I’ve been a longtime simmons hater since folks were saying he’s better than Tatum.   Now that we’re well past that I’m going the other way. There’s a whole thread right now with idiots going “lol, maaaaybe id trade Keldon Johnson and a bag potato chips lol😂""   Like... Shut up. I feel like this could end up with Ben Simmons as someone's third guy and we're all standing around like.... Waaait what?? Similar with Dennis although I think the issue is that Dennis was always a Maybe overpowered Jordan Clarkson and he's gonna get paid that way."
"Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson. I'm not giving up any picks, Spurs have too much history making those work."
The real win in that trade is Spurs landing Keldon Johnson with that 29th pick from Toronto.
"I checked a few days ago and Draymond didn’t have a picture then as well. I guess someone saw and remedied it, except for Keldon Johnson. RIP LMAO"
isnt that just the basic google site?  [here's](http://www.fiba.basketball/olympics/men/2020/player/Keldon-Johnson) his profile (with pictures lol) on the official olympic website
"It's because Google doesn't have a picture of Keldon Johnson for some reason. I believe if you update his Wikipedia entry and upload a picture of him, Google would pick it up and show it everywhere."
Keldon Johnson has played worse than KD.
"Keldon ""AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"" Johnson"
"""San Antonio is sending Dejounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, and the 2022+2024 1st round picks to Philadelphia for Ben Simmons"""
"In terms of a player I think might have star potential that doesn’t get talked about a lot, ( or at Least enough ) is Keldon Johnson, watch out for a breakout year from him. I’m also a big fan of Timothé luwawu-cabarrot, I think he’ll be a more regular rotation guy in a couple years. One more being Romeo Langford, he’s already a very good defender and a not too bad finisher, and this offseason was the first one where he wasn’t just rehabbing an injury, so maybe he’ll improve this offseason, get his jump shot back, and have a pretty solid role on a playoff team."
"I’m always annoyed Spurs don’t get talked about enough in the media, until I actually hear/read when they ARE talked about, and then realize it’s just because they don’t watch our games or have a clue.  It’s obvious. We’re going youth movement and seeing what happens with Derrick White, DeJounte Murray, and Keldon Johnson leading the team. We either sink (likely) and get a lottery pick, or we swim because at least one of them broke out and made the leap. The other signings are valuable assets that we can trade away when teams want them. Simple.  Also just a terrible take on DeJounte Murray. Other people have said it already but his midrange game is elite and he can create for others. He’s a good offensive presence, even if he doesn’t shoot 3’s."
I'm convinced Keldon Johnson is the real MVP that held that team together
"Keldon Johnson, young forward for the Spurs. Was on the select team and got promoted to the Olympic roster when Beal got COVID. Hasn't seen a ton of floor time outside of last night. Slightly controversial because some thought other players should have gotten the call, but he's effectively the 12th man on a team that's been playing a 9-man rotation all tournament."
Is Keldon Johnson the worst NBA Olympian for USA ever? Dude is so random. And before you say laettner he was chosen intentionally to have one college player on the team and he was also an all star at one point in the nba so he wasn’t even that bad.
"Keldon Johnson went one pick after my Warriors took Jordan Poole, and I remember being pissed that they passed on Johnson at the time and feeling that way a lot up until the last 25 games or so of last year. Now they both look like prime MIP candidates."
Im suddenly a Keldon Johnson fan.
Is Keldon Johnson the USA version of Theo Pinson?
Keldon Johnson: How can I put this in a way so as not to offend or unnerve
This is the C team with like two guys from the A team mixed in. Fucking Keldon Johnson and JaVale McGee are on the roster lol
"This is how superteams are formed, Keldon Johnson gonna ask for a trade"
"Who did that lmao, was that Keldon Johnson  while running over?"
"Keldon Johnson, young player for the Spurs and was originally on the select team. He was brought up with the absences of Kevin Love and Bradley Beal  EDIT: If you are referring to the US team that is"
Put Keldon Johnson in cowards
i forgot keldon johnson and jerami grant we’re on this team honestly
Put keldon Johnson in
"When does the US put Javale and Keldon Johnson in? Y'know, the guys that were definitely legitimate selections and not just Pop trolling his brains out."
Plus no one showing out. Mediocre but idk Keldon Johnson becomes a borderline all star is a fine season. Mediocre but no one outright impressed as a number 1 or 2 option is a much worse situation
"Since I'm an Aussie and Spurs fan, this the one time i go against Popovich and Keldon Johnson."
Keldon Johnson
"Seriously though what happened to Tony Parker, Bruce Bowen, Patty Mills? Wasn’t Pop the one who was broken up because he didn’t want to move George Hill in the Kawhi trade?  Pop drafted Dejounte, Lonnie Walker, Primo, and loves Keldon Johnson too"
"Dejounte Murray, Devin Vassell, Doug McDermott, Keldon Johnson, Jakob Poeltl.   Derrick White, Josh Primo, Lonnie Walker, Thad Young, Zach Collins.  Tre Jones, Da'Quan Jeffries, Keita Bates-Diop, Luka Samanic, Jock Landale"
I know you're super sad and not in the right mind since the best player in your franchise's history left yall so ima let the Keldon Johnson disrespect slide
"don't disrespect keldon ""large surface area"" johnson like that man"
Spurs got Keldon Johnson with the last FRP they received in a trade. Kawhi Leonard before that. Let's hope the trend continues.
We had to force Keldon Johnson to play out of position at the 4 we really needed to add a starting 4 so getting Thad is awesome
"Poeltl, Keldon Johnson, Thad Young, and a future first. Pretty good return, actually."
"You definitely know better than I do, I thought Derrick White, Keldon Johnson, and to a lesser extent, Lonnie Walker and Dejounte Murray all don’t seem to have that much creation skills for themselves or for others (Dejounte’s passing probably being the most impactful of the bunch)"
Keldon Johnson = BIG BODY
Keldon “Big Body” Johnson
Keldon Johnson
time to bring in pop's secret weapon....Keldon Johnson 🤣
They should have put in Keldon Johnson and McGee
put keldon johnson in lmao
Keldon johnson is a super star
No keldon Johnson or murray?
Here comes Keldon Johnson!
"I didn't mean to be aggressive but Javale Mcgee, Holiday, Jeremy Grant, Bam, Middleton, and Keldon Johnson, and even Booker who is great (all of them are to a degree) aren't near the best for their position and definitely a b squad. Its not hard to find better players at their position. Not taking anything away from them but its not hard to construct a better roster."
"I didn't mean to be aggressive but Javale Mcgee, Holiday, Jeremy Grant, Bam, Middleton, and Keldon Johnson, and even Booker who is great (all of them are to a degree) aren't near the best for their position and definitely a b squad. Its not hard to find better players at their position. Not taking anything away from them but its not hard to construct a better roster."
"They have good talent for where they’ve drafted the past 10 years. Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, and Keldon Johnson were all pick 29. You don’t get starting caliber players that consistently late in the draft unless you’re good at evaluating and developing talent like the spurs"
"Dejounte, Derrick White, Keldon Johnson all look pretty good considering where they were drafted. Kyle Anderson was good while a Spur, not sure where you're getting the idea that he only blossomed in Memphis. These are also guys being drafted at the end of the 1st round, where expected value is very low but they manage to get contributors more often than other teams.   Going back further you have Parker, Ginobili, Cory Joseph, George Hill, Tiago Splitter. The highest pick of any of those guys was like 26."
Why did Keldon Johnson throw up a full court heave up 35 pts with the last seconds coming off the clock? It almost went in.
"So this is why we got Keldon ""drive-on-Luka"" Johnson."
"Next season is make or break year for Samanic, sure, but we also got Keldon Johnson in that draft, so I think we did OK."
"I think so. It’s a different take on rebuilding. No implosion, just developing and maximizing the talent we have. We did what we could with Lonnie Walker, and I think this coming season is his last season to show he can at least be a strong role player. Last season he showed flashes, but is bad defensively. He has all the physical tools, but so did JR Smith. Murray and White proved to be good players. White looked ready to burst out but injuries set him back. Murray is on a team friendly deal, and there’s a big chance he has his breakout season next season. Right now, I think the focus shifts to seeing what Keldon Johnson can be, then Devin Vassell who showed so much promise. I actually believe we have accepted that we could be a bottom 5 team next season, and have a real chance to draft Holmgren, Banchero, Jovic or Hardy."
"I hope and think Keldon Johnson could get a bigger role when DeMar leaves and move into MiP contention, maybe 16ppg, 7rpg. He just needs to make more contact to get FTs and up his 3% a bit. Someone will have to take the offensive load without DeMar and it’s either him or Dejounte."
"You do realize the situation your describing isn’t unique at all, this isn’t an excuse considering they kept their rookie last year too. You do realize that time and time again teams are in even worse positions than the Warriors when their star player asks to be traded. Other teams already know they wanna get rid of the their star and can lowball them, but guess what happens? You end up with high amounts of drafts picks/young stars getting moved either way like with AD, etc etc.   Even guys with crazy high salaries can be moved like Paul, Conley, Westbrook etc multiple times. Teams have managed to find trades time and time again for aging stars making over 40m. The Warriors can 100% find a worthwhile trade considering how well they did on draft night.   Even in lopsided trades like how we got Kawhi the Spurs still ended up with Keldon Johnson who has high potential. The issue is the Warriors FO."
"No, but they also need to fill out a roster somehow.  The current forward rotation is Keldon Johnson, Luka Samanic, and...that’s it."
"Seriuosly, he makes Keldon Johnson look like the younger 7th grader that hangs out with the 8th graders. Except Keldon is 6'7''."
Tatum hits a stepback 3 and stares down at Keldon Johnson on the bench [who's just like](https://media.tenor.com/images/6186566e30a9ed6d4be745d11beb89a4/tenor.gif)
"Yes, we should bring the likes of Keldon Johnson in international competition, and not bring the stars"
"Except for Trae Young, cause Team USA just had to have Keldon Johnson."
We gonna see some keldon Johnson minutes now?
"Defense is the only way to win.  Need to punish these teams so they are tired on the offensive side, turn that defense to offense.  But Team USA has 2 players who play defense and then 9 shooters and whatever Keldon Johnson is, a warthog, lol."
"He was one of the top 5 or so guys from the combine based on the Woo article. Maybe stellar was the wrong word, but definitely standout and all those guys moved up in the draft while others dropped because they didn't do as well or didn't show up at all. Now Spurs can to put him through their development cycle so I am happy with that.   He doesn't have to be better than the other Spurs guards right now. He's still so young. He can still get bigger. Keldon Johnson has grown since they drafted him. David Robinson was 6'6 at 18. Not that I think he'll be 7 foot, but he has potential to see physical growth too. I'm happy with it.   Spurs have a solid scouting / FO program and development team, so they definitely saw something and he checked off a lot of boxes.  They definitely see something more in him than Sengun, probably on the athletic defensive wing side of things. Wright also made note of him playing PG in addition to position-less."
"Insane that he won't admit not having Ja or Trae Young on the selected squad was a mistake and says ""they didn't fit the bill"" when freaking Keldon Johnson is on the team. So frustrating"
"Fuck Colangelo for addressing it like that. I wish Randle and Trae were on the team, they wanted it so bad and were never even invited. Meanwhile we have Keldon Johnson representing us….."
But Keldon Johnson does? Fuck LP.
Keldon Johnson
"Murray, White, Walker IV, Keldon Johnson, Vassell, and shit even Kyle Anderson are all solid starter level to rotation level players. Primo could end up being a reach but can't deny the potential. Throw in Kawhi/Cory and to me that seems like hitting on 9/13 picks in that stretch. Casual take."
"I don’t watch a ton of Hawks, but how does trae play off the ball?  I feel like his lack of defense, off ball offensive impact, and reliance on foulbaiting are enough to exclude him from the team.   Still think he (or a number of players) should be in over Keldon Johnson but i don’t think that trae solves our problems overnight"
"I mean.. dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson were both 29. Derrick white too.   You can put quotes around ""contributing players"" but I think you'll have a hard time arguing that those 3 guys don't contribute."
Only if you expect Spurs drafting all-star in high teens or twenties. And Keldon Johnson still could be one.
Yes. Kawhi Leonard at 15 - incredible pick. Kyle Anderson at 30 - great pick. Dejounte Murray at 29 - great pick. Derrick White at 29 - great pick. Keldon Johnson at 29 - great pick. We drafted an MVP caliber player and 4 starter level players while having no lottery picks until last year.
You forgot keldon Johnson so that's literally four starters picked after #26. Is there even another team who can say that?
It also ignores keldon Johnson at 29 aswell. There is a lot of hits for that low of a spot
"&gt;  I guess, that's why Keldon Johnson earned a spot, he's teaching others how to run the SAS offense.   This line is so funny 😂"
But they added defenseive stalwarts Javalve McGee and Keldon Johnson?? 😱 how could this be?!?
"Yup, Javele McGee, White, and Keldon Johnson definitely ""earned"" their right to represent the USA in international play. Can't believe politics play such a massive role, in what should be, a merit based selection process."
You can’t convince me that Keldon johnson would be more useful than trae on team USA especially on a team with one playmaker at best
"2019 29th pick Keldon Johnson  2017 29th pick Derrick White  2016 29th pick Dejounte Murray  2014 30th pick Kyle Anderson  These are all picks within the last decade that are solid role players for any team. All picked late first round, which is more than what some teams hope to get at that spot. Maybe I'm wrong and Primo becomes a bust, but their track record has been pretty good imo"
"Huge Kentucky fan here: his offensive limitations are similar to what people thought about keldon Johnson coming into the league except Jackson has way more upside IMO. As you said, he had a limited preseason to get accustomed to college ball. I think he’ll make an immediate impact for the team he’s on and after a couple of seasons of nba weightlifting he will make a name for himself."
You guys chose Keldon Johnson over Trae Young
"Worst draft pick of the night. The entire Spurs scouting team and management should be forced to donate their salary for the entire 2021-2022 season to a worthy charity. Seriously this guy had 1 team that had him as 1st round pick, they were drafting at the bottom of the draft. The Spurs must have forgotten it's 2021, and thought they were back in 2012 or something picking from the back of the draft order again.  I hope I'm wrong in this kid develops and becomes a star, but there is no way he becomes a star in time to make a difference next season. They need Big Men, they have 2 post players guaranteed on their roster for the 2021-2022 season and Keldon Johnson who's forced to play as a defacto big man. The Spurs actually have a solid young team, but there were two glaring holes. 1st they lacked talented big men. Kai Jones, Alperen Sengun, Usman... they had their pick at 12. They could have had a big that would help at least eat up some minutes next year.   At least at 41 they took a guy who can help with perimeter scoring, but he's another guard not a big. I'm hoping they are able to land some quality free agent biggs that went undrafted and again when NBA free agency started, but barring Kawhi coming back this pick likely means they might not win 25 games next year. What a terrible ending for a legendary coach.  The Spurs draft philosophy is just stupid and out of wack. Trying to be the smartest guys in the room, but actually doing dumb crap. The Spurs are a great organization and once again I hope I'm wrong, but some times doing what is 'expected' is the actual smartest thing you can do."
"Dude, I don't even know what a good fit for Pop is anymore.  I have lost quite a bit of the confidence I once had in him.  Right now, the pick seems pretty odd.  Like, what a re we gonna do, play 4 young guards all like 6-4 or 6-5 and then Keldon Johnson at the 5 just so we can switch every single action on defense?"
Gregg popovich best bet to win gold this year is  Pg jrue holiday or dame  Sg khris Middleton Sf jayson tatum  Pf draymond green or Keldon Johnson  C bambam or javele McGee
Keon Johnson is a L and a D away from being Keldon Johnson so that’s an appropriate draft comp
"Future All-Star Keldon ""Big Body"" Johnson."
"Why is this shit upvoted? You’re literally describing Demar from 3 years ago. The Spurs had a 113Offensive rating(T-11th), when was it off it dropped down 104.8(29th). That 113 is with Dejountae Murray and Keldon Johnson as his 2nd and 3rd options most of the year who combined made 1.8 3s on 32% shooting. Demar is a legit playmaker in the half court now. He’s a 59% TS, 2% above leave average the last two seasons. And he shoots above league from every where but the 3. Everything you said is cap. It’s like nobody has paid attention to Demar since he went to the Spurs smh"
"Bruh Keldon got like 20 minutes over the span of 4 games, just stop.  ""Can be used in the future"", cool, use him in the future then. Melo can still score in the NBA, he could score in the Olympics too. Meanwhile Johnson got the spot because he's a ""hard worker"" lol."
We all know why Keldon Johnson is getting minutes over grant
"Jrue is that dude. What a difference he makes. Super underrated. Also that Keldon Johnson needs to not get minutes with a -11 in 9 mins, and Draymond is still a bum."
&gt;Pop playing Keldon Johnson heavy minutes while Jerami Grant and Khris Middleton are wasting away on the bench. Him and Colangelo gotta go.  Bumping this comment.
Mason Plumlee would be more useful than Keldon Johnson for this team
But Keldon Johnson plays so hard and BIG BODY memes.
Pop playing Keldon Johnson heavy minutes while Jerami Grant and Khris Middleton are wasting away on the bench. Him and Colangelo gotta go.
No Keldon Johnson slander please
Come on Pop. Is Keldon Johnson and Mcgee gonna play over Jerami Grant?!
he's available but pop is playing Keldon Johnson instead for some ungodly reason
How the fuck is Keldon Johnson playing major minutes for USA
Why does Keldon Johnson play over Jerami Grant????
Keldon Johnson over Kris Middleton?
"Who needs Zion, Trae or Ja when you can have Keldon Johnson and Javale!"
Who tf is Keldon Johnson and why is he getting minutes?
who the hell is Keldon Johnson?
"Foul-baiting seems to be the one the most wrong for the team. I probably say the national pride element. I feel no pride from the USA national team compared to the other national teams. Pride is able to make you accomplish so many things. Hell, no one in the US team came to help up Keldon Johnson( who was their best player in the Spain game and had more pride than those people.) Pride in yourself and team goes a long way"
I am once again asking you to put in Keldon Johnson
Enough dicking around  Put in Keldon Johnson
"Obviously, the US have 10 guys around the All Star teams plus Keldon Johnson and Javale, while France only have one in Gobert. But are the US really gonna be in constant foul trouble?"
"Keldon Johnson n'est pas un tireur de place en place, il ne va pas courir au coin pour tirer comme s'il était un troisième choix, salope ce n'est pas jj redick, c'est un demi-dieu putain, steph curry réincarné mais cette fois il n'est pas une lâche putain, il tire du logo putain et vous battre en même temps"
Keldon Johnson. The Olympic experience will give him much needed experience to add to his young game.
Keldon Johnson aka BIG BODY
"""top 3"" So..... Zion, Ja, and Jordan Poole? For reference, this ranks Jordan Poole above: RJ Barret, Deandre Hunter, Darius Garland, and Tyler Herro. Those four are ***definitely*** above Poole, and most would have talents like KPJ and Keldon Johnson ahead of him too."
keldon johnson. big body.
"Kawhi was important in us winning that chip, but he didn’t straight win it for us like he did the raptors. He did shut down lebron tho.  But yes. If keldon Johnson didn’t work out, the return we got has been pretty fucking medium at best. Kawhi throwing a fit cost us at least 2 firsts. I’ve never been a demar fan, and poeltl is medium. So we’ve been in the worst spot a pro franchise can be in: just outside of the playoffs or barely in the playoffs ever since kawhi left. No way to significantly improve, and never going to win. That’s a dynasty that kawhi ruined.  Raptors fans were just happy to be there, but they gave up a ton to get that, and y’all see where they are now. So they got wrecked too.  LA gave up everything for kawhis demands and if he bounces then that’s another team he’s gutted for no reason. Just on a whim lol."
beal didn't make it Tokyo because of covid unfortunately. got replaced by keldon johnson
"Zion, Ja, RJ, Hunter, Garland, Cam Johnson, Washington, Rui, NAW, KPJ, and Keldon are all better. After that you have guys like White, Thybulle, Herro, and Gafford who all have solid arguments."
"Second half of the lottery probably?   Zion, Ja, Barrett, and Garland would be top 4.  The rest of the lottery would probably be (in some order): DeAndre Hunter, Coby White, Tyler Herro, PJ Washington, Matisse Thybulle, Cam Johnson, Keldon Johnson, Kevin Porter Jr., Jordan Poole, Rui Hachimura. Maybe throw in Gafford or Clarke or Reddish or someone else instead.  Pretty weak draft so far, looking back on it."
Keldon Johnson is your guy. Not taking anything from anyone else. He’s just…something special.
"Getting Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, and Keldon Johnson at the 29th pick is incredible. In a redraft all those guys go in the lottery."
KPJ  Keldon Johnson
Keldon Johnson
Y’all would have beat the Bucks if you had a ball boy like Keldon Johnson.
MVP: LeBron  ROTY: Cade  6MOTY: Clarkson  MIP: Wiseman (EDIT: Keldon Johnson may win tbh)  DPOY: Giannis  COTY: Vogel
"God damnit time to go back to the alamo, don’t worry keldon johnson will protect us"
"Eh, the Kawhi deal was risky, they traded their franchise player in DeMar, their best centre prospect in Poeltl (he's now one of the best defenders at his position), and a late 1st (which turned out to be Keldon Johnson) for a 1 year rental superstar that [didn't want to be there](https://mobile.twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1019500916880240640?lang=en), had uncertain injury issues, and just burnt bridges with one of the most respected franchises in the league.   They also made this 'all-in' trade while the KD Warriors still existed.  If the Raptors lost to Philly that year, they would've looked like fools now, especially given their current centre issues."
"But they have KD, Dame, and Keldon Johnson. It will be ok"

"Yea, that late first we gave to the Spurs for Kawhi turned out to be Keldon Johnson, San Antonio's scouting department is incredible."
Get Keldon Johnson some help
Gary Trent. Keldon Johnson and now the 3rd all star starter - Desmond bane.
"Ah shit, we're gonna have to trade Keldon Johnson after he becomes a superstar for an aging Siakam in a few years, aren't we?"
"Absolutely not. He’s not even Top 5 tbh.  First up, using per-36 in an argument for a guy who isn’t averaging anywhere close to it is kinda silly. Jalen Leque is the per-36 lol king in the NBA right now, averaging 29 pts 29 reb and 10 asts on 50% FG. How many of you even know which team he’s from? Means nothing.  Now coming to who is actually likely to win it - here are my top 5: 1. Christian Wood 2. Michael Porter Jr. - Grand Canyon sized gap - 3. Jeremi Grant 4. Keldon Johnson 5. Mikal Bridges/Mike Conley  Honestly, it’s really just between Christian Wood and Michael Porter Jr. right now."
Keldon Johnson for Spurs. Bill Land has been calling him the mustang and Spurs fans calling him Big Body. It’s gotta get settled.
we got future MVP Keldon Johnson!!!!
"Just off the top of my head Wood, Jalen Brown and Sexton are probably turning out to be the best value picks in fantasy right now. Keldon Johnson maybe the best for a guy absolutely zero people drafted."
"I have a feeling Keldon Johnson will be, just have a gut feeling he’s going to by somewhere between Russ and Kawhi"
"Did you actually watch the game yesterday? Because this comment pretty much confirms you didn't. DeMar didn't guard Davis, like at all. Keldon Johnson, Derrick White, Jakob Poeltl and Drew Eubanks were the primary defenders for him for the entirety of the game.   I'm not disagreeing that DeMar is a bad defender but you sure as hell didn't come to that conclusion by watching the game..."
"Naw, DeMar and the rove of guards can all shoot, dribble, drive, and dish. They attack the basket relentlessly and with efficiency, and they swarm on defense as best they can. They're good. They can't compare to Timmy era spurs, early or late end, but they're still good alright.  DeJounte looks ready, Keldon Johnson looks like the real deal, Derrick White is back, Lonnie Walker is hitting 3s, and most importantly y'all got rid of Bryn Forbes. God he blew."
The Deep State doesn't want you to know about Keldon Johnson
Keldon Johnson does everything you'd want a strong wing player to do. Future star.
He kind of did that the whole playoffs last year I think he’s individually better than lebron but lebron runs the team so well and makes everyone better while AD can dominate the paint defense and also take over on offense   Keldon Johnson looked really good too he looked like the best young prospect on the team

"BIG BODYYYYY. I love him so much man, he's even added a couple rip through moves from Demar to get to the free throw line so you know Demar has has a good influence and Demar said Keldon Johnson was his favourite rookie last year and Keldon used to interrupt his interviews. I don't love him at the 4 but he competes and when he can add better ball handling and a pullup midrange shot he could be in all star contention"
yeah your big man rotation at 4/5 these games has been Keldon Johnson//Rudy Gay and Poeltl//Eubanks. That's just a bit rough.
I love how he plays in the bubble and today I'm officially a Keldon Johnson fan.
I honestly think Keldon Johnson is the Spurs PF not DeMar. Although it doesn’t really matter nowadays
How did Keldon Johnson have more FTAs than LBJ &amp; AD when over 80% of his FG attempts were from the 3 point line???
"You expect AD to score like that though, or at least more than you expect it from Keldon Johnson."
Keldon Johnson
"hard fought win, Spurs played us super tough and Keldon Johnson was splashing everything wtf"
Keldon Johnson could not fucking miss tonight
I for one am tired of going against the Lakers  but also Keldon Johnson

"Now if we could just get Keldon Johnson, Popovich, and Pierce off the team."
Well the original question is why Keldon Johnson and Derrick white over Trae and Ja and that was your response….🤔🤔
Keldon Johnson!
And Keldon Johnson can?
Keldon Johnson is not 25 and did not go undrafted lol
Keon Johnson vs Keldon Johnson Nikola Jovic vs Nikola Jokic
Keldon Johnson
How does team USA include Derrick White and Keldon Johnson over Ja Morant and Trae Young?
"&gt; Keldon Johnson, Darius garland, and saddiq bey to the reserve team.  What the heck. And no Trae, Zion, or Ja?"
Then why is Keldon Johnson there
"They have Kevin love on the team and invited Keldon Johnson, Darius garland, and saddiq bey to the reserve team. Them not even reaching out to Ja is simply bad recruiting on their part"
"My guess is Keldon Johnson. He's already played a lot, he's a bigger body and with Middleton and Booker coming in a guard isn't as needed.  Garland solves the bench creator role and while he's played good, Johnson fills a much bigger need for the team."
Keldon 'BIG BODY' Johnson Time
Keldon Johnson took his spot
Keldon Johnson took his spot
Time for Keldon Big Body Johnson to take over!
Keldon Johnson getting moved up confirmed
Keldon Johnson is winning MIP.
"Maybe it's cause Lavine is pretty thin, but Keldon Johnson looks huge"
"Darius Garland will be among three guys promoted to Team USA for the team’s exhibition games, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic.   Keldon Johnson and Saddiq Bey will also join Garland, as the trio will replace Devin Booker, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday up until the conclusion of the NBA Finals.  source : https://fortyeightminutes.com/darius-garland-among-select-team-players-promoted-to-team-usa/"
"Darius Garland, Keldon Johnson, and Saddiq Bey"
"If they're trying to go all in before Pop retires, trade Dejounte and Derrick to the Mavs for KP and a 2025 1st.   Then use your crazy cap space to try to sign one of CP3, Kyle Lowry, or Mike Conley. If you strike out on them, settle for someone who you know is just chasing the bag and a starting spot, like Dennis Schroeder or Spencer Dinwiddie.   Use your leftover money to add another quality starter, if possible, particularly a shooting guard. Maybe you can entice Oladipo with an overpay, or Kelly Oubre. If Josh Richardson opts out, maybe you get him.  Round out the bench with some vets.   Ideal lineup would be CP3/Oladipo/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Vassell, Justise Winslow, Otto Porter, Cody Zeller off the bench.   More likely scenario would be Schroeder/Vassell/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, James Johnson, Robin Lopez"
"I find it hilarious, BUT it is worth noting that the roster currently playing is the worst it's been since pros started playing for Team USA.  Guys like Draymond (a solid 1/3/5 stat line) and Love (a solid 0/0/0 stat line) are only there as token guys for their past rather than anything they actually currently offer.  Jerami Grant played 13 minutes. Known ""stats on bad teams"" guy LaVine played 13 minutes as well. I literally have no idea who Keldon Johnson is and he also played 13 minutes.   Booker, Middleton and Holiday will join the team soon. Even then, is anyone going to confuse this year's roster with the Dream Team or Redeem Team? Of course not. But, say those three do nothing more than take the minutes of Grant, LaVine and Johnson. That's one hell of a better team automatically."
Are my eyes deceiving me or is Keldon fucking Johnson the primary ball handler for the second unit?
keldon johnson useless
"I don’t think Holiday or Booker would take any minutes from grant, unless the US is playing smurf ball.  Keldon Johnson got 13-minutes last game.  Middleton will be taking those and I think some of Lavine’s come the big games.  I think there’s space for a defensive-oriented athletic four."
"Another reason why having a rookie or college guy on the team is good for team. They play physical because they don't know any better, Keldon Johnson was excellent."
"We’re giving Keldon Johnson and Darius Garland minutes right now, with Booker/Holiday/Middleton not on the team yet. Not like this is the full strength squad either."
Is Keldon Johnson just a fill in for Booker or is he actually on the squad?
Jerami Grant got less minutes than Keldon Johnson… ouch
How about Keldon Johnson? That guy can ball
Well the USA played basketball for the first 5 minutes then just stopped playing defense and passing. Glad Pop got to play Keldon Johnson 30 minutes to provide absolutely nothing though! Stellar coaching.
At least Keldon Johnson got some experience lmao. Keep up the good work guys
"Keldon Johnson isn't on the lineup though, he's just a placeholder while Book, Middleton and Jrue are out. No reason to play him than personal bias"
Keldon Johnson
Keldon Johnson?  Is that a real name or did I make that up?  We need a box score
keldon johnson
Keldon Johnson getting minutes on Team USA lol. Pop really using this as a way to get his guy experience.
why is keldon johnson getting all the select minutes over bey
*and Keldon Big Body Johnson
"Yeah I’m ready to say it, keldon johnson is the best in the league right now"
KELDON JOHNSON.
Keldon Johnson
Keldon Johnson
KELDON MOTHERFUCKING JOHNSON IS COMING
KELDON JOHNSON SIGHTING
Until Popovich puts in Keldon Johnson I will identify as a Australian Male and pray on America’s downfall.
Team USA is 0-1 this season when Keldon Johnson doesn’t play
Id MUCH rather have wiggins and those picks than derozan  poeltl and keldon Johnson
"Even if it had just been Ingram and a late 1st round pick, wouldn't they be better off if they'd taken that? Instead they're just gonna have Poeltl and what ended up being the 29th pick in the 2019 draft (Keldon Johnson). Or if not they should have tried to flip DeRozan before now."
Keldon Johnson wouldn’t have let this happened
Pop didn’t put in Keldon Johnson. I now hate America and identity myself as an Australian man. Go boomers 🇦🇺
"Keldon Johnson 0 minutes, it's like Pop wants to lose."
I’m just here for Keldon Johnson and Saddiq Bey
"Keldon Johnson is going to surprise people, I think he has a strong chance to be MIP. If word from USA basketball camp is true, he’s been making huge leaps with his offensive game this offseason (better mid range and 3 point shooting while also being more comfortable with the ball in his hands and initiating offense off the drive).   In my most optimistic projection, I could see him averaging close to 20 a game (assuming DeMar leaves, as someone will need to take on a bigger scoring role)."
Keldon Johnson
"Zion is 6’6, but he’s a special case so let’s look at keldon Johnson who’s a a 6’5 pf. I really don’t like the concept of small pf’s but it’s definitely possible with the right hustle and Heart"
"Honestly I wouldn't feel that bad about it, even kinda positive about it tbh. We recently talked about it our sub so I'll leave you down here my thoughts!  I like it, really. What we mainly need is a PF that can play for a couple of years while our prospects at this position (Samanic+Future Picks) develop. Kuzma is good for this! He has a 2+PO Contract; he earns 13M, not that much and in case really tradable; relatively young; played under not that great circumstances; Pop and our development stuff can fix some stuff, Lakers' one is not great and it showed with other young players they traded away. I mean, defintely let's not consider him as a cornerstone of the franchise, he is not, but he can be a great rotational piece for us while better prospects develop! Also, I highly doubt the trade would be just Kuzma, but other stuff will be included. The 22th Pick alone would be awesome, imagine attached to Kuzma too! Also maybe another filler that we can maybe flip for a couple of 2nds, we don't have one in 2022 so...  We are not that trash. With guys like DJ, Derrick, Keldon... we ain't doing what OKC did, we will still try to win games. For example Samanic could start next year, but he is just not ready for that role yet, also we tend to develop prospects slowly in roder to avoid major issues in the future. Also, if we somehow these projects show they deserve more, then just bench Kuz or even trade him, he has a nice contract (13M, 2yrs+PO).  Yeah, I mean, you kinda know my ideas on this team and that I'm really high on basically anyone and I think they all gonna make a major if not a solid jump next year if we finally decide to part away with all our vets. DeMar, as much as I love him, really, I just think that wasn't THAT important on our team if we had Derrick. I mean, we will prolly be a bit worse, but not that much in my opinion. Consider also that defense and size was a big problem last year and without DeMar this will go away, not fully, but still a bit.  Now lemme be the GM for the sake of doing it, you know I like it lmao. So, we will now assume that the [trade](https://imgur.com/qxd8AUj) goes through. LAL get: DeMar DeRozan / SAS get: Kyle Kuzma + Montrezl Harrell + 22th Pick. We then decide to trade Harrell to the Hornets and we get the 57th Pick (via Nets) and the 2022 2nd Round Pick (via Raptors). We do this because we will get a big in the draft and we will play him. We know have the 12th Pick, the 22nd Pick, the 41st Pick, the 57th Pick. (sadly for you lmao) I assume that the player I will choose are available so in order we draft: Alperen Sengun, Ziaire Williams, Isaiah Todd, Ibou Badji. Sengun will immediately play off the bench behind Jakob. I would be surprised tho if Drew played over him at the beginning of the season and they shared minutes. Ziaire Williams had a really inefficient season with Stanford and has ton of things to work on so I wouldn't be surprised if he spent most of his time in the G-League and I'm a fan of it, it went really good for us! Isaiah Todd most definitely will play with Austin, he has things to work on too. Ibou Badji then is my favourite prospect in this draft (I even made [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/od6bo9/ibou_dianko_badji_15_every_highlights_13p_8r_7b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)/[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/odv548/ibou_dianko_badji_15_green_jersey_highlights_23p/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Highlights for the U19 World Cup), he has a crazy high potential for me and taking a gamble with such a low pick is the real deal, all assuming he doesn't withdraw and he is available. He would be a Draft and Stash in Barcelona. If he does withdraw, then idk, maybe ask something else instead to Charlotte or maybe just select someone else.  At the end, as you know I love lmao, here is the final table! I would be kinda excited tbh.  |*Starters*|*Bench Unit*|*Third String*| |:-|:-|:-| |Dejounte Murray|Tre Jones|*Brad Wanamaker*| |Derrick White|Lonnie Walker IV|Wayne Ellington| |Keldon Johnson|Devin Vassell|Ziaire Williams| |Kyle Kuzma|Luka Samanic|Isaiah Todd| |Jakob Poeltl|Alperen Sengun|Drew Eubanks ^(+Ibou Badji (Draft&amp;Stash))|  For minutes I would say the same things I said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)."
It’s about to be Keldon Johnson vs team USA in a little while
"From what I remember, Lakers refused to include Ingram which was kinda the deal breaker.  And the Spurs had no interest in Lonzo, since we have a ton of young guards already and didn't want to deal with Lavar's craziness.  So even a package of Randle+Kuzma+picks is probably not as good as what SA got from Toronto (DeMar+Poeltl+the pick that became Keldon Johnson)...and I say that knowing full well that DeRozan is no Kawhi and is probably leaving this summer."
1. Keldon Johnson.
"&gt;So to answer that question, how I feel having Poetl, DeMar AND (you forgot one) Keldon Johnson vs. Ingram and what would likely have been the 30th pick? (That was the reported package)  Well now it's my turn to correct you, as you forgot the trade also included Danny Green, and they didn't trade for Keldon Johnson, but rather Toronto's 1st round pick in 2019, which turned out to be the 29th pick in the draft. If the Lakers had LeBron and Kawhi I'm sure the pick they sent San Antonio would have been no worse than that, as the Warriors still had KD that year and Milwaukee had the league's best record with 60 wins (the Warriors had 57).   So what we're actually talking about is Danny Green and Kawhi for DeRozan, Poeltl and the 29th pick vs. Ingram and basically the same pick for just Kawhi. So really it's a question of whether you'd rather have Ingram and possibly Danny Green or just Jacob Poeltl, since the pick would have been the same and DeRozan is probably gone. Was the DeRozan era really that great in San Antonio that you're happy with that return?"
"Yeesh, I’ll fix it then. I’m on mobile so inputs doesn’t always go through, but ill concede on that point.  So to answer that question, how I feel having Poetl, DeMar AND (you forgot one) Keldon Johnson vs. Ingram and what would likely have been the 30th pick? (That was the reported package)  I like the Raptors package now but I didn’t at the time I’ll confess. Ingram is a phenomenal player, young, has great scoring but poor defense and can’t seem to make it work with Zion nor help lead his team to wins. He’s also getting over $150 mil ($31 mil avg) which in my eyes is an overpay. It’s not the worst situation, and spending a chunk of the cap on a player who may not be franchise material is worry-some but it would have been fine if the Spurs were actively tanking. In the long run though, I think the Raptors package ended up being much better than expected for the Spurs.  You seem to downplay Poetl but he’s one of the top defensive bigs in the league now and on a remarkably cheap $8 million dollar contract for the next several years. Pretty much a top 3 defensive player according to RAPTOR.  Keldon Johnson was the Raptors pick and if you don’t know how great he’s been I don’t know what to tell you. He’s going to be awesome given time to grow.  Finally DeMar, likely to leave this season, but did a great job being a vet that the other young guys looked up to, as well as helped keep the Spurs in the playoff race during the pandemic. Even if the Spurs do not manage to S&amp;T him for assets, I’ll still be grateful for the Raptors package because our young guys learned a TON from DeMar on how to be a hard working professional.   Overall, I liked the Raptors package more because even if Spurs didn’t make the playoffs and DeMar ends up leaving, Spurs still played much better than the Pels with Ingram and have a ton of options with their cap flexibility going forward. Once Pop gets his 26 wins and the tank actually starts, things will work out the same way anyways.   Only difference would be we would have to hear a few Raptors fans brag about their trade for a few years vs. what would have been endless trolling from Lakers fans if they got Kawhi."
Ability now  1. Bridges 2. Hunter 3. Johnson 4. Reddish   Potential 1. Hunter 2. Reddish 3. Bridges 4. Keldon
"He's really good at finishing through contact and rebounding   He's kinda bad when it comes to defensive awareness and getting baited into offensive fouls  However, what you should check out immediately is the Keldon Johnson and Mariah Carey video"
"I would just say they're doing OK. I'm probably more pessimistic than some other fans but Derrick and Lonnie may just be who they are. More so Derrick at 27yo but  after this year I think we'll know a bit more about both of their longer term projections. I've personally been putting more stock into Dejounte (obviously), Keldon Johnson, &amp; our rookie Devin Vassell."
Keldon Johnson is nice but overall...yeah
am i the only one who can close his eyes and see Keldon Johnson as the next Kawhi in the making?
"Between picks 21-30 seems like you have maybe a 35% chance on hitting at least a rotation player, and then maybe 10-15% on getting a really legitimate piece.   1/3 might not seem super high, but that’s also at a very low salary that you have a ton of control over.   **2011**  Mirotic (23rd)  Reggie Jackson (24th)  Cory Joseph (29th)  Butler (30th)  **2012**  *no one notable*  **2013**  THJ (24th)  Reggie Bullock (25th)  Roberson (26th)  Gobert (27th)   **2014**  Capela (25th)  Bogdan Bogdanovic (27th)  Kyle Anderson (30th)  **2015**  Bobby Portis (22nd)  RHJ (23rd)  Tyus Jones (24th)  Nance (27th)  Looney (30th)  **2016**  Korkmaz (26th)  Siakam (27th)  Dejounte Murray (30th)  **2017**  Jarrett Allen (22nd)  OG (23rd)  Kuzma (27th)  Derrick White (29th)  Josh Hart (30th)  **2018**  Grayson Allen (21st)  Aaron Holiday (23rd)  Simons (24th)  Shamet (26th)  Robert Williams (27th)  **2019**  Clarke (21st)  Bazley (23rd)  Keldon Johnson (29th)  KPJ (30th)  **2020**  Maxey (21st)  Nnaji (22nd)  Hampton (24th)  Quickley (25th)  Printchard (26th)  Bane (30th)"
"While your math is really good (it's not) I'd encourage you to remember The Spurs also got Poeltl and the pick that turned into Keldon Johnson, both of whom will probably start for us.  Adding Kuzma to that and you've got two quality starters and an Amber Rose impersonator."
"Dude stop wasting my time. I don't care if you believe it or not. Magic literally stated that the Kawhi trade didn't go through because Pop wanted 4 first round picks and all the Lakers young guys. Keep telling yourself that it's cool to trade a superstar for Poeltl, Keldon Johnson, and DeRozan who is about to be traded for fucking Kuzma lol. Ingram by himself is worth more than what y'all got."
"ah yes, the never proposed package that with a generational all star talent like zion williamson ended up being worse tham us and one of them is done instead of olympian keldon johnson, third (according to bball index) defensive big man on a 3-yyear 27M contract and an amazing vet  like demar that helped the groupp grow, ah yes."
*Olympian Keldon Johnson
"Kawhi got them Derozan, Poetl and a pick than turned out to be Keldon Johnson."
Kuzma bout to become Paul George once he lands in SA lol. Keldon Johnson + Kuzma &gt;&gt; Kawhi + PG lmao
