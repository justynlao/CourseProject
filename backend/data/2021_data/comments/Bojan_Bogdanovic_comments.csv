"Dude Bojan Bogdanovic is our only other starter above 6’4” and does basically nothing on defense. We’ve been dead last in opponent turnover rate the last two years because we don’t put any pressure on people at the perimeter. Royce is only a little above average, Mitchell is below average defensively, and Conley was awful last year despite a big improvement this year. Any defensive success we have is 95% because of Rudy."
Bojan Bogdanovic
"Royce O'Neale and Bojan Bogdanovic are our forwards. Obviously, Green isn't starting over Rudy. You could, maybe, make a case to start Green over Royce, but I wouldn't do it."
"Damn, they almost won last year too but Bojan Bogdanovic hit a buzzer beating 3 pointer for the win"
"Lots of role players have averaged 18+ points a game. Just looking at the past few seasons: Kelly Oubre, TJ Warren, Bojan Bogdanovic, JJ Redick, Marcus Morris, etc. DeAndre Hunter is having a great season, but we're talking about someone who is at 19 USG% this year and barely averaging 3 assists per 100 possessions. He's got a bigger skillset than most ""role players"" between his face-up and pull-up game. But he's still, at least right now, a role player who's asked to play defense, shoot spot-up threes and occasionally work in the mid-post. He could certainly continue to develop and become much more though, as we've seen with a lot of wings in the past"
"Joe Harris, Dinwiddie for pennies. Caris LeVert for Thad Young. Jarrett Allen for Bojan Bogdanovic.  He built a solid core with no lottery picks. Only lottery pick was D'Lo thru the Mozgov dump which worked out great.   So just saying the Nets did nothing and got 3 superstars is a pretty weak take."
"Bogdan Bogdanovic, if only for the confusion it would create with Bojan.  To echo, Nitro, Lu Dort would be a-frickin-mazing. Similarly, Marcus Smart would be cool too."

"Why stop there? Trade KP for Jusuf Nurkic, get Bojan Bogdanovic from Utah and then Bogdan Bogdanovic as well from Atlanta.  Then we rename Dallas Mavericks to The Yugo Slavs and we all jointly convert to communism comrade."
"It's insane. Dragic-Doncic-Bojan Bogdanovic-Saric-Jokic was right there.    Nurk backup 5, Vucevic backup 4 because he can shoot and Nurk can probably guard the 4 spot when they're in together, and Bogdan Bogdanovic handles 30 of the 40 minutes the perimeter 3 starters sit and surprisingly Montegrin Javonte Green gets the final 10.   Maybe even close with Bogdan in for Saric and Doncic at the 4."

"A team being significantly better 4-8 makes a world of difference come playoff time, especially considering that the given the chemistry issues and the fit issues that the Nets have with their top 3 (if kyrie doesnt retire, top 2 if he does), the Bucks/Heat/Celtics/76ers are all close enough top end wise that having much better depth would more than make up for the difference  You can hype up the Nets scrubs all you want, but Harris is no better than DiVincenzo, Seth Curry, Duncan Robinson, Justin Holiday, KCP, Bojan Bogdanovic, Mikal Bridges, Trent Jr, etc etc etc  And even if Harris was a hair better than any of those guys, which again he's not, each of those teams are sooo much better 5-8 that it isn't even comparable. Bruce Brown, Shamet, TLC, Chiozza are all players that only see playing time because of how bad the depth is on the Nets. Okay maybe Brown would get bench time on other teams, but even that is stretching  I'm not grasping at anything. I'm literally spitting facts of why the Nets are not title contenders as currently constructed, and I have evidence to back it up considering that they struggled to beat the worst team in the league yesterday  Keep spinning the facts, whatchu got next?"

"Yea facts there has not been much talk about how nice he's been this year. Really just suffering from the lack of coverage of the Jazz and it seems to be a trend for smaller market teams in general. Seems like the media, only makes room for two players from small market teams (Donovan and Gobert, Ingram and Zion, KAT and DLo, Sabonis and Brogdon, Jokic and Murray). I mean it's true that most teams have two players that garner a lot of media attention, but for small market teams there no room for the other important players. I mean it seem's like the only other dude on the Jazz who get's mentioned is Joe Ingles (although deservedly so because he's the greatest basketball player in the history of the game /s) lol but ofc he's a really more known as a meme, although he is a good role player. I mean there's barely any coverage of Bojan Bogdanovic and the dude literally averaged 20ppg last year on 60% TS..."
Kyrie aside if both Durant and Harden sign a 2yr extension the trade is worth it.   They would finish their deals at the end of the 2024-25 season. The Rockets would have the 2026 1st and 2027 Swap when Harden is 35 and Durant is 36 and both possibly out of Brooklyn. Kyrie would be like 32.   Nets would open up a ton of Cap Space so they could sign Free Agents. The Celtics trade went bad because Lin and other FA’s got hurt so Marks stripped the team even more and got assets for Brook Lopez(D’Lo) and Bojan Bogdanovic(Allen). Thad Young was traded for LeVert before the season.   Just have to figure out if Kyrie will retire or get it together or can they somehow flip him for depth?   Pick Swaps don’t guarantee the Rockets will be better than the Nets years from now.
"This is just not true. Jarrett Allen was picked with Wizards' pick from Bojan Bogdanovic trade. Dzanan Musa was picked with Toronto's pick from Demarre Carroll trade. Neither were traded before they played with the Nets.  Nets picks ended up in Boston/Cleveland until 2018. Their 2019 pick was traded for philly's 2020 first, which was traded for Shamet in a 3 team trade."
It was indeed. Part of the Bojan Bogdanovic trade in February 2017
"It's hard to take anything significant away from this game, really. The Cavs were severely short-handed, so a lot of bench guys got some good burn, while the Jazz were really only missing Joe Ingles (which, to be fair, is significant for them).   It's like the Jazz are the only team not dealing with COVID right now, maybe because they started this whole thing back in March. Fingers cross that it stays that way.  Bogdanovic was good again tonight. His wrist is just causing him to be so inconsistent, it's hard to know what to expect from him night to night. Sorta like Conley last season. At least Conley is back to his normal nightly performance. Once Bojan gets right, Jazz should be pretty good compared to the rest of the league.  I posted this stat in the PGT but there was a graphic that before last night's game, the Jazz were 5-1 against teams &gt;.500, but 1-3 against teams &lt;.500. They really seem to struggle to maintain a high level of play against teams they're ""supposed"" to beat. Hell, even the Pistons came back from down 20 on Sunday to make the game closer than the end results - Jazz won by 10 but it was like a 3 point game with a minute left.  Hard to put the Jazz anywhere on the power rankings when they're being so inconsistent - they're a top-4 team in the west record-wise but then they've also lost to the Timberwolves and the Knicks."

"FVV, Jrue, Bojan Bogdanovic, Michael Porter Jr., Myles Turner"
Bogdan Bogdanovic.  I've watched Jazz local broadcasts and I think they sometimes call Bojan Bogdanovic Bogi as well.
"It’s not entirely on birthplace — Zubac and Bojan Bogdanovic are both (correctly) listed under Croatia but were both born in Bosnia&amp;Herzegovina. However, both are Croats and play for the Croatian national team, so it’s certainly correct to list them under Croatia.  That makes me think - has Chris Boucher never played for Team Canada? That could explain why this wasn’t caught earlier and why he’s not listed under Canada. Or did the author merely seek to make the “number of countries” bigger.  Also, has Argentina annexed some land to the West of the Andes? Because that wasn’t Argentina last time I checked."
Bojan Bogdanovic  OG Anunoby   DeMar DeRozan  Kyle Kuzma   Mikal Bridges   Caris LeVert  Joe Harris
"A tale of two halves, probably due partly to the Jazz being on a back to back. Conley and Bogdanovic struggled a lot in the third quarter, Mike with several unexpected turnovers and Bojan still in his shooting slump.   Credit to the Knicks for keeping trying, Randle who struggled in the first half came back in a good stretch as center against Favors and Rivers hit several tough shots to extend the lead.  But Conley, Bogdanovic and Mitchell shooting 3/23 from three makes it nearly impossible for the Jazz to win even when the bench has a good offensive output."

"Their second scorer is Bogdanovic, who was out for that series. That’s 20 high efficiency PPG Utah were missing when they played.  Mitchell averaged 24 PPG for the season so you can see how the load was shared before they lost their best shooter (Bojan shot 41% from 3)"

"Apart from half a season with Butler, KAT hasn’t had someone as good as Bojan Bogdanovic on his team, much less a player like Mitchell"
"I wanted to argue because Ayton or Holiday as the best 3rd option seems crazy but then I looked and it's probably true. I think I'd personally go with Holiday as the best 3rd option or Brown in Boston behind Tatum and Kemba or even Gallinari in Atlanta behind Young/Collins, with Klay injured there are very few teams with an all star caliber 3rd option. If Wall returns to 80% of his 2018 form, then him or Christian Wood could be the best 3rd option out there.   Other candidates are:   * Mike Conley/Bojan Bogdanovic (Utah) * Jusuf Nurkic/RoCo (Portland) * Josh Richardson (Dallas) * Tobias Harris (Philly) * Eric Bledsoe (New Orleans) * Anthony Edwards/Ricky Rubio (Minny) * Jonas Valanciunas (Memphis) * Myles Turner/Warren/Brogdan (Indiana) * Millsap/MPJ (Denver)"

"but thats what they had to do.  in a vacuum, of course it makes no sense...as did the offer to Tyler Johnson and Alan crabbe.  but nets had no draft picks for the next 4 years when those contracts were offered.  how were they going to get quality young players? they weren't going to sign superstars or Allstars.  a 4 yr max to YOUNG guys with promise was a risk worth taking.  if they amount to something, great.  if they don't well the contract is up right when nets can start drafting players again.    and nets were brook lopez, thad young and bojan bogdanovic with no draft picks when Sean marks took over.  many GMs would have pushed that trio. lopez was up for a contract and he would have had to be maxed to stay.   what was that team winning but many gms would have just maxed lopez to try to win as many games as possible to make sure its not a top 3 pick going to Boston.  and if a GM did that then sure boston doesn't get Tatum or brown but where would nets be right now?"
TIL that Bojan Bogdanovic stans exist
"Every time someone mentions X player is playing pretty good this season, 9 times out of 10 dude is averaging 40% from 3.   Mikal Bridges, Tobias Harris, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nicholas Batum, and even Jeff Green are all averaging above 40%.  Frank Kraminsky is averaging 42%.  Even Kent Bazemore.  Come on."
"It's like people saying Gobert is overpaid. Who the fuck else are we going to replace him with? Our biggest FA signing ever is Bojan Bogdanovic. If teams can see how well we're doing with this roster, it should eventually lead to bigger FAs wanting to sign or play with Utah."
"Biggest change is improved offensive schemes and a reliably solid 8 to 9 man rotation.    For offensive schemes, we now do a much better job passing out in ways that avoid passing lanes.  Mitchell is not letting the ball stick in his hands as much as he used to.  Clarkson has the green light to do what he wants.    It helps that most everyone looks better too.  I don't think anyone has regressed. Bojan Bogdanovic has his off nights, I think he's the most inconsistent of the bunch."
"Good points there. I don't think the team being middle of the pack is really relevant, as we have fairly weak defenders outside of Turner right now. The Jazz have Mike Conley (above average), Donovan Mitchell (above average), Bojan Bogdanovic (average), Royce O'Neal (elite), and Ingles (borderline elite) off the bench."
"Nikola Jokic, Luka Doncic, Domantas Sabonis, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nikola Vucevic, Goran Dragic"
"Bojan Bogdanovic for the first month of the season was in a terrible shooting slump, was dropped in thousands of fantasy leagues and ripped his jersey in frustration. Then on Jan 29 vs DAL he found his stroke and has been on a correction streak for the next month. Kemba needs the 7 for 9 from deep game to start the correction."
"2011 had Isaiah Thomas, Bojan Bogdanovic, Davis Bertans, Chandler Parsons (who was good once upon a time) and E'twaun Moore.  2003 had Jason Kapono, Kyle Korver, Luke Walton, Willie Green, Zaza Pachulia, James Jones, Mo Williams. and Keith Bogans. There's two All-Star selections and nine championships between them, in addition to long careers."
"Exactly. The Jazz have been a perennial playoff team for a long time, obviously went to the finals twice in the late 90s and are having a record breaking year right now and perhaps our biggest free agent signing in franchise history was Bojan Bogdanovic haha. No major all star is leaving their team to join us up in the mountains no matter how good our franchise can operate, just reality for a lot of teams in the league."
"I would want big, athletic wings that can shoot and a switchy, rim-protecting big that can play defense, be an outlet in the pick n roll and do everything possible to cover up for Dame's lack of size on defense.  Here's who I would want (not just picking the very best NBA players to stack alongside him):  Jaylen Brown  Gordon Hayward  Bojan Bogdanovic  Bam Adebayo   This team has size, play-making, shooting and would play defense well enough around Dame to cover up for his lack of size.  Jaylen Brown &amp; Bam are perfect compliments to Dame, giving him another creator with size who can defend tough options in the back-court/on the wing and a switchy big that would be great in the PnR and can do everything on defense.  Combine with some great shooting and a bit more scoring juice in Bojan &amp; Hayward and you've got a damn good squad."
I’m sure Bojan Bogdanovic is going to make a HUGE impact. Gonna win the championship for sure
"Bojan bogdanovic instead of bjelica, huuuuge upgrade"
"We will def need to dip into the Euro player pool for this as well.    C position is obv the deepest. Usually teams carry 3 Cs. Jokic, Vucevic and Nurkic would be the voices here. Boban is also available, Zubac. In Europe if needed there’s others, Zizic, Petrusev, Miro Bilan. Raduljica is pretty washed at this point. Kuzmic has looked bad, since coming back, Milutinov is always injured. I’m sure there’s others I’m overlooking.   At PF Bjelica, Saric are obv main choices. Dubljevic is a beast too, especially if you need a beefier PF.   SF - Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic. Kalinic for hustle, defense, versatility. Lucic, Djedovic. Maybe Davidovac if you’re desperate.   SG - Bogdan Bogdanovic, Guduric, Klemen Prepelic, Jaka Blazic. Nedovic if healthy.   PG - Presumably Dragic and Teodosic are still retired from international play. That leaves the the position pretty thin. Micic, Jovic are probably next."
"Ehh, I mean Gobert IS our entire defense, which is what 2nd or 3rd overall in the league, if we take him and just replace him with Favors and Azubuike then I think our defense falls off a cliff - Favors is great in his own way, but I don't think our defense would be nearly as good with him at the helm full-time instead of Rudy. Favs is better on the perimeter, but Rudy is in a league of his own when it comes to protecting the paint. He allows our guards and wings to be aggressive on defense and play the passing lanes, knowing that Rudy is usually there to back them up at the rim.  Mitchell is a bit of a weird case. While I think he is a legit All-Star and could be an All-NBA player, I feel like a lineup of Conley-Ingles-O'Neale-Bogdanovic-Gobert with Clarkson and Favors off the bench is nearly a 50-win team, while Conley-Mitchell-O'Neale-Bogdanovic-Favors with Clarkson, Ingles, and Azuibuike off the bench is about a 40-win team. The defense just drops off so much with the loss of Gobert, it's hard to imagine them being able to just rely on purely scoring from the guards and the Bojan/Ingles duo"
"&gt; I think most would agree that **Utah's top two players are clearly better than anyone on 14-15 Atlanta**. Beyond that, I am not sure that you could place anyone on that Hawks team above Conley, Clarkson, or even Bogdanovic with 100% certainty.   Certainly Horford and probably Millsap are better than those 3, and they're a lot closer to Mitchell than Bojan. That team made the ECF and won 60 games for a reason. This Jazz team can be talented without their entire starting 5 and 6th man being better than 2 all-stars"

"I feel like having an all Balkan team and all USA team isn't the same though because the Balkans are \~1/4 of Europe, population size highly benefits team USA.

I think I'd put my money on team West Coast but it's not a landslide."
"The Wiz deservedly get a lot of shit for signing Ian Mahinmi to a 4/64m deal back in the summer of 2016. What most people forget about, however, is that the Wiz also signed Andrew Nicholson to a 3 year 26 million deal that same summer. That contract was as disastrous for DC as the Mahinmi one. Then Wizards GM Ernie Grunfeld sent our 2017 first to the Nets to unload Nicholson, getting back half a year of Bojan Bogdanovic in the process. That Washington pick ended up being Jarett Allen, a type of player the Wizards have desperately needed for 4 years now.   That 2016 Free Agency (and injuries) ended up killing any chance the Wizards had of contending during the Wall era. Thankfully, it was one of the final nails in Ernie Grunfeld's coffin."
Bojan Bogdanovic
"The Jazz are another great example of this. They have the best record in the league and currently have 7 players averaging over 20 minutes a game. Of those 7 players, 5 of them are:  - Rudy Gobert - Drafted 27th overall - Bojan Bogdanovic - Drafted 31st overall - Jordan Clarkson - Drafted 46th overall - Joe Ingles - Undrafted - Royce O'Neale - Undrafted  The only players on the roster drafted higher than 27th overall are Conley, Favors, and Mitchell. Granted, some of those players like Bogie and Clarkson were well-established with other teams before joining the Jazz but I think it's cool to see a team doing so well that is mostly comprised of late-round/undrafted guys"
Bojan Bogdanovic and Derrick Favors are nothing to you? Stop. Your casual is showing.
It cannot be said enough that Taylor Jenkins looks like Bojan Bogdanovic after retirement.
Bojan bogdanovic for John Collins and tony snell
"Bojan Bogdanovic, Joe Ingles, Royce O'Neale, and Georges Niang are all like that for Utah as well.  Mike Conley is pretty close to making it too, lol.  Still totally crazy for someone like Steph, though.  His offensive load is huge for Golden State."
wait you're really telling me bojan bogdanovic has more dunks this season than russell westbrook
"What a weird tweet lol  Bojan Bogdanovic averaged 20 ppg last season, where were you Magic"
Wigs not playing up to salary is the reason GSW is hovering around .500  If you swap Wigs(30mil) for Bojan Bogdanovic(18mil) and 1-2 quality role players I bet GSW would be top4 in WC now.
"If the Blazers could build a 2011 Mavs style team around Dame it could be possible.  If you surrounded Dame with Jaylen Brown (or Jrue Holiday), Mikal Bridges, Bojan Bogdanovic and Bam Adebayo with Ingles, Norman Powell, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder and Ivica Zubac that'd be a true championship contending roster.  That squad has the size, defense &amp; versatility to cover up for Dame on defense, a playmaking big to help beat the trap on a PnR, enough secondary scoring to make teams pay for loading up on Dame and enough shooting to keep the lane open for him.   It's much harder to build a team around a small guard but not impossible."

"It was so damn good. Of course, I'm both an NBA fan and a GoT fan. So it was kind of perfect for me. As a Nets fan though, it was a bit rough. We barely got mentioned and the one episode in which we got a lot of coverage it was about a player getting away from the Nets (Bojan Bogdanovic celebrated getting traded). Though it was all very fair in its treatment of the Nets, so I can't complain in that regards. And, frankly, as a Nets fan, I can't complain about much these days. ;-)"
"Since 2011, the Jazz, Nuggets, and Blazers draft picks have combined for 13 all star appearances (Lillard 6, Jokic 3, Gobert 2, Mitchell 2).

Notable acquisitions via free agency in recent years (please let me know if I missed any notables. This was weirdly difficult to dig up.) :  * Evan Turner * Derrick Jones Jr. * Carmelo Anthony * Paul Millsap * Bojan Bogdanovic    Since 2011, the Lakers, Clippers, and Nets draft picks have combined for 3 all star appearances (D'Lo '19, Ingram '20, Randle '21), yet all 3 teams are championship contenders.

"&gt;Bigs shoot differently to wings. They're a little more cautious, they're often slower to get their shots off and they prefer different types of shots. Decent shooting for a C in a PnP situation doesn't translate to decent shooting out on the wings.  Yeah all of this. Al Horford for a 5 is better than most 5s at floor spacing. Which is a very low bar to clear but it's true because he'll take 3s basically. Al Horford for a 4 is not better than most 4s at floor spacing. Not at all it's the opposite. Not in today's NBA where the 4's are all these Bojan Bogdanovic types.   Everything is relative to position and the types of 3s you shoot. You can count on one hand the number of 5s that are true floor spacers with real gravity. %s arent what dictate that. And unless your a Porzingis/KAT type, there are just more valuable things to be doing offensively if your a 5 than standing on the perimeter taking 4 3s a night.   Turner is great at what he does defensively. That makes him worth $18 mil. But he's really no different than these other defensive oriented centers who's value is just on one end of the court. That's why nobody wants to give up meaningful assets for him."
Bojan bogdanovic is fucking awful tonight

"I think so. Something I like to think about is, what would saying about (insert veteran player) if he was a rookie? Like, would bojan bogdanovic or Kelly oubre be the rookie of the year if they were playing like they are as rookies? What would people say about their potential?"
"For the Pacers, Lance Stephenson, Bojan Bogdanovic, and Thad Young in recent years."
"Lol looks like not a single team from any country of ex-Yugoslavia will be there. You know, just the countries that produced current NBA scrubs like Jokic, Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Dragic, Vucevic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Saric, Nurkic, Zubac, Poku, Marjanovic, Bjelica etc..., and previously players like Drazen Petrovic, Toni Kukoc, Peja Stojakovic etc... The teams haven't been to successful in last few years, but clubs from Yugoslavia won 6 Euroleagues in 8 years back in 80s and 90s."
Never thought I'll see hate for Bojan Bogdanovic.
"Powell, KCP, and Bojan Bogdanovic usually go off on us whenever we play them."
"Hmmm. I see your question. If we are assuming at full health, and if we are not including an all out super star, you ideally want a star/extremely good role player who can space the floor to complement your duo.   A healthy Klay Thompspn brings all time great shooting and good perimeter defense to a team. You could plug him into any dynamic duo, and he will seamlessly fit in as the third wheel. He does not need to be ball dominant. He can get hot quickly. Tremendous off ball movement and great hustle.    If we are assuming full health right now? I would probably want Joe Harris or Bojan Bogdanovic. They bring elite shooting and good scoring. But I don't think they can be a 2nd option night in, and night out every night."
Bojan bogdanovic was pretty much cast off from the wiz who apparently didn't see him as worth $10m per. He also improved a fair bit on defense while on the pacers
"Sorry, we need Bojan. We also need to acquire Bogdan. The goal is to have an unstoppable all Bogdanovic starting lineup, at which point the Jazz will have assembled Bogxodia and will go undefeated for the rest of the season(s)."
How are Bogdan Bogdanović and Bojan Bogdanovic not on the same team?
Bojan is a legend and we do not deserve him. This Nets fan is thrilled to see him thriving in the league.   Truly the greatest Bogdanovic.

"Well like  Aaron Gordon, KD, Tatum, Marcus Morris, Bojan Bogdanovic, these are your “forwards”, and are players you probably wouldn’t want playing either SG (struggle to guard quicker players), or C (too small, not strong enough, for bigs)"
"the same way bojan bogdanovic is utah's best free agent signing in franchise history. small markets typically just don't attract big names, even if they're doing everything right"
"Winning the series is one thing, but making just the most basic adjustments is another. Like at some point he should have realized along with the rest of us that switching onto and then driving directly at Bam Adebayo every possession wasn't getting us many points, or that spamming Bojan Bogdanovic ISO wasn't a terribly efficient way to play the game."
Bojan 'Air' Bogdanovic
"We managed to finally recognize Bojan from Bogdan Bogdanovic, we can do it again."
"Bojan Bogdanovic has longer streaks than this, accounting for minutes played."
"1. conley, SS - good defender, will get on base, has never struck out in his entire career. great table setter  2. mitchell, CF - good speed and range, can hit for power as well  3. gobert, C - Big man with a huge bat, insane range defensively  4. bojan bogdanovic, DH - swings for the fences every time  5. joe ingles, LF - if bojan didnt bat them in joey vegemite will  6. jordan clarkson, RF - also swings for the fences every time  7. Georges Niang, 1B - hes in the league for his hitting, but also surprisingly decent defender for his position   8. royce oneale, 2B - good individual defender, not a huge offensive threat but he can make plays  9. derrick favors, 3b - quietly does the dirty work like a professional"
"No I’m not, go watch the damn games. We were the better team in that series. I think we had a point differential of about + 35 and we blew game 7 when we had control because Nate McMillan let Kevin Love score like 9 straight points on pick n pop 3s while LeBron was off the court. Our offense that entire series was Oladipo isolation and Bojan Bogdanovic chuck up a 3 at the buzzer."
"I think the best thing the Jazz can do is run the offense through Bogdanovic in the first quarter. The Jazz have struggled to find offense early in games, and Mitchell is more of a second half guy, whereas Bojan historically plays his best in the first quarter.

"Lmao. Jazz are 1st in allowing fewest 3s and 2nd in opponents 3P%, … Warriors are also 20th in points in the paint. Utah do a fantastic job at defending the perimeter and the paint. Conley exists, Bogdanovic exists, Mitchell and Gobert exist, the rest of the excellent role players like Ingles exist too.

"That's great, because Bojan Bogdanovic is the best Croatian in the league. Easily"
"&gt;The celtics swept them yet the margin was barely 5+ points (not sure exact numbers) because the Pacers could never close anything when it counted.  The Pacers also played that series with the marvelous, stupendous, superstar Bojan Bogdanovic as their primary scorer, with a bunch of role player quality players around him (Sabonis was a bench player). Getting swept in that series without Oladipo shouldn't be surprising. The fact they were even in those games should be lauded, not criticized like this.  Last year, definitely should've put up more fight but this is the same Miami team that slapped the hell of out the Bucks, and the Bucks were quite a lot better than the Pacers. Playoff Jimmy Butler is a scary beast.   The Pacers also distinctly lack a closer. Warren is the closest thing they have, but he isn't anywhere close to the level of cutting it for the playoffs. Injuries or not, the 2019 squad only had Dipo for 36 games and still managed to win 48 games under McMillan led, again, by Bojan Bogdanovic on a squad composed entirely of average starter caliber players (at the time, Sabonis was a bench guy) and very good role players.  This year, they've only been missing Warren for most of it. Turner's hurt now, yeah, but he played 47 of their 60 games. Everyone else has missed sparingly.  Sabonis has progressed massively and Brogdon keeps getting better... yet they're poised to barely scrape into the play-in with a much, much, MUCH better roster (even without Warren) than the 2018-swept squad had. Maybe it's time we accept that the Pacers just aren't as good as we think they are, and McMillan elevated them dramatically."

This gives off heavy Bojan Bogdanovic and Bogdan Bogdanovic vibes
I once accidentally drafted Bogdan Bogdanovic instead of Bojan Bogdanovic on Draftkings. Happy accident that led to winning $50
This is Bojan Bogdanovic and Bogdan Bogdanovic all over again.
"Honestly, to differentiate Bogdan from Bojan Bogdanovic is only tough for the people who can't be arsed to do so"
"Think it'll be easier tbh, Bojan and Bogdan have similar first names but the same last name while Jokic and Jovic have same first name but different past name.  People call most players by their last name anyways so it'll be Jokic and Jovic instead of Bogdanovic and Bogdanovic."
&gt;I think its already tough for a lot of people to differenciate Bogdan Bogdanovic (Atlanta Hawks) and Bojan Bogdanovic (Utah Jazz)  you're right about that bro!
"&gt; He was still in top five of points per touch last year.  Yeah just behind offensive engine Bojan Bogdanovic!   Look at that list and tell me what the difference is between it, and a list of the best offensive players.  It's literally just all the guys that can score but don't affect the offense much outside that.    None of the top offensive players are at the top lol(Lebron, Jokic, Harden, Curry, Dame, Doncic crew).  Why do you think that is?"
"Rubio and Pau would fit there.   However this is kinda difficult to judge because a lot of Euroleague players get drafted but choose to stay in Europe longer for development.   Off the top of my head, players like Marc Gasol, Bojan Bogdanovic and Bogdan Bogdanovic would definitely be lottery picks at their European primes but they get drafted waaay before that."

"Bojan Bogdanovic 1/5 at the half. Lmao, is this guy supposed to be a borderline all star or something"
Embarrassed to say I only just now realized that there are both a Bogdan AND a Bojan Bogdanovic
Bojan Bogdanovic has worn the same red pair of Adidas pro bounce for as long as he has been on the Jazz. There was a small stint where he was wearing DON's and he occasionally wears something obscure but he's always gone back to the red pro bounce
"&gt;  I seriously doubt Utah + Towns would be any lower than a two.  The team is literally built to optimize Gobert's strengths.  The defensive system is basically packing the perimeter and funneling everyone into Rudy.  It's what allows the Jazz to play Bojan Bogdanovic (who, recent defense on Kawhi aside, isn't exactly regarded as an elite defender) at PF without getting wrecked.    On offense the system is low key reliant on Gobert being one of the best screeners in the league.  People meme about his screen assists, but he's vital to getting a lot of people open looks. So I'd very much dispute that this Utah team is anywhere near as good w/ Towns instead of Rudy.  Maybe if you gave the management team an offseason to make trades / adjustments.    Minnesota + Gobert - KAT obviously isn't a top seed either, FWIW."
"I don’t understand the position that Sabonis is a negative in the playoffs. We didnt make the playoffs this year, and he didn’t play in the playoffs last season (injury). Last time he played in the playoffs, our team was lead by Bojan Bogdanovic and Vic had just been injured that first time. Domas is a completely different player now."

"Vucevic, Dragic, Saric and Zubac.  And those are both Bogdanovic (Bojan and Bogdan, not related)"
Both Bojan and Bogdan have the same last name which is Bogdanovic. You messed it up both times and you didn't even mess it up in the same way lmao.
He didn't have to deal with the 2022 DPOY Bojan Bogdanovic
"Reggie Jackson can't win with these cats  Also how fucking insane is **Bojan Bogdanovic**? Dude's defense against Kawhi in the 4th quarter was truly something to behold.   I used to think Bogdan was the better Bogdanovic because I enjoyed his game so much, but man Bojan is fucking insane.  Obviously the 3pt that he's known for, but he can also handle the ball well, finish around the rim, or pull up from mid-range. And that defense is a god damn revelation. I didn't know he was that legit of a defender."

yeah the jazz arent really a defensive lineup. we start bojan bogdanovic as a power forward.  its just that we have rudy gobert and hes that good
"Bojan primarily defended Batum and Morris. He did not do a very good job stopping George, but he did get Kawhi to shoot 2/7 against him.  Mitchell also did not spend much time on George, and he did not get scored on. Similar story with Kawhi, except he made one bucket on him.   Matchup data in general is really hard to use with the Jazz because Gobert is the one that contests shots, so guys like Mitchell and Bogdanovic won't have their stats reflected once they finished funneling a player to Gobert."
bojan bogdanovic
"It is absolutely ridiculous how people thought KD would automatically join a Nets team when it had a starting lineup at one point of Donald Sloan, Wayne Ellington, Bojan Bogdanovic, Thomas Robinson, and Willie Reed. Like no. Sean Marks developed talent and poached players like D'Lo and LeVert to get to where they are now."
Man you know Bojan Bogdanovic got that Harry Potter dick. He's packing nine and three quarters.
"Conley is far better than Bogdan. You can make an argument the he's on same level as Bojan Bogdanovic, but not Conley."
"Knicks are dumb if they max Randle. Best move would be trading him for a haul.   You might even be able to get a guy like Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neal or Joe Ingles. Could call the Kings about Harrison Barnes and Bagley or Hield. Ask Detroit for Jerami Grant? Try to swap him out for Wiggins &amp; FRP? Lauri and Young? Deni and Bertans? Robinson/Herro and Oladipo? Collins and Reddish? Joe Harris and Green/Brown? Hardaway &amp; Kleber or Richardson and DFS? RoCo/DJJ &amp; Powell? White and Walker? Poku and Dort?  Hayward + PJW for Randle &amp; Bullock?  Turner + Warren for Randle and Knox?  Randle + FRP for Tobias?  Randle, Quickley and Robinson + FRPs for George, Bev Oturu?"
How does Taylor Jenkins feel to be coaching against his son? And how does Bojan Bogdanovic feel to be playing against his dad?
"Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Nikola Vucevic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Bogdan Bogdanovic."
"Johnnie Bryant from the New York Knicks  It might be a coincidence that Randle put up an all nba year and RJ jumped in year 2 but it may also have something to do with Bryant; his history speaks for itself. The following players have had their best professional seasons when Johnnie Bryant was on the coaching staff. Gordon Hayward, Rodney Hood, George Hill, Rudy Gobert, Bojan Bogdanovic, Donovan Mitchell(before this year), Julius Randle, RJ Barrett. At some point I think the league takes notice and someone lets him run an entire team."
"They missed a fuckton of open 3s against Houston in the 2019 playoffs, so added Conley and Bogdanovic to try to get more of a threat and not let teams just focus on Mitchell. Then Bojan missed the bubble and Snyder had them take more 3s to make up for him missing. They realized that that worked pretty well so supercharged it this season."
I think he's worth 20mil. Bojan Bogdanovic type money. They might overpay him though.
"I heard if you stack Bojan Bogdanovic and Bogdan Bogdanovic on top of each other, you create a Boban Marjanovic"
"No, Bogdan Bogdanovic and Bojan Bogdanovic are the sampe person. I mean, look at how similar their names are"
And his name is Bojan Bogdanovic
"Leonard as a ridiculously souped up bojan bogdanovic would be insanely fun to watch, conley and Mitch can allow him to focus on just scoring and defense too instead of carrying"
"While they are at it, they can sign the other European players as well  Goran Dragic, Luka Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nikola Vucevic, Nikola Jokic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Davis Bertans, Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert, Ricky Rubio, Evan Fournier, Danilo Gallinari, Domantas Sabonis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Dennis Schroeder"
"Jazz have a few undrafted legends on their squad in Royce Oneal and Joe Ingles. Sixth man of the year Jordan Clarkson was also a second round pick. Of those 3 only Royce was originally signed/drafted by the Jazz. Bojan Bogdanovic was also the first pick of the second round, also not drafted by Utah."
"Goran Dragic, Luka Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic   Dennis Schroeder, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Davis Bertans, Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert  Ricky Rubio, Evan Fournier, Danilo Gallinari, Domantas Sabonis, Nikola Vucevic (this squad could almost be all big men)  # EURO SQUAD, ASSEMBLE"

"Rudy Gobert and Bogdanovic had interesting quotes postgame about Mitchell being out  &gt; [When he woke up from his afternoon nap, Rudy Gobert was surprised to hear that Donovan Mitchell had been ruled out.

Bogey is technically both their nicknames but Brooks confused Bojan Bogdanovic who is on the Jazz with Bogdan Bogdanovic who is on the Hawks
"&gt; Are Bogdan and Bojan Bogdanovic related?   Bogdan is related to the late noted Serbian architect Bogdan Bogdanović, sharing the same name. However, he is not related to fellow NBA basketball player Bojan Bogdanović, who is Croatian."
Bojan? You're thinking of the wrong Bogdanovic
Starting to think that Bojan Bogdanovic and Bogdan Bogdanovic  arn't actually the same player
"That prick who injured him, did it on purpose like Bojan Bogdanovic said."
Why is Bojan Bogdanovic coaching the Grizzlies?
Is Bojan Bogdanovic going to be the first person to play and coach on opposing sides in the same series?
"In his first 3 seasons (excluding 18-19 because he was out for the grand majority of it) Dillon Brooks has ...  - Played more minutes per game in each season than Danny has ever in his career - Has a usage % higher than Danny has ever had in his career - Is averaging 6 ppg more than Danny has ever had his career          - Averaged 5 more ppg in his sophomore season than Danny's best   Dillon is much more than a spot up shooter, he can handle the ball, he can play off and break through pick and rolls, he's an insanely good finisher, and he combines that with a very decent shooting game. Obviously Green has had a much more successful career, one that has been super exceptional for a role player. But no one would say Danny Green is better than players like Bojan Bogdanovic, Jaylen Brown or Tobias Harris, even though their careers nowhere compare to Danny's.  Dillon already seems to be a player who doesn't have to hide as the 4th or 5th best player on a VERY good team to be useful. Outside of that role, Danny is okay, and that's a very narrow role. He's been very lucky to bounce from Spurs, to Raptors to 76ers.   Tony Parker isn't better than Tracy McGrady, I think this is a similar sort of situation."
Taylor Jenkins with the mask on vs Bojan Bogdanovic will be very entertaining for me
"Quin is very up and down with end of game scenarios. Bojan Bogdanovic had two game winners last season, and I know we’ve had some other good play designs, but also some serious head scratchers this season at the end of games. Quin seems like an excellent coach in terms of building a system and adapting it with counters throughout the season though"
Isaiah is way too high at 6. Mirotic before Bojan Bogdanovic? Are you writing this in 2015?
"Bojan Bogdanovic had wrist surgery right before the bubble. He was back for the start of this season, but he didn't really seem like he was fully recovered until a month or two into the season. Wrists are really finnicky."
"1. Kawhi 2. Kyrie 3. Butler 4. Klay 5. Kemba 6. Isaiah 7. Vucevic 8. Mook Morris 9. Tobi Harris 10. Valanciunas 11. Mirotic 12. Bojan Bogdanovic 13. Reggie Jackson 14. Tristan 15. Kanter 16. Kieff Morris 17. Bertans 18. Burks  I stopped there, the other guys are pretty irrelavant even if some had a decent career (Bismack, Knight, Shump), had a lot of trouble ranking Isaiah"
I mean impact is the whole case for Gobert DPOY and MVP to some people. Jazz have a top 5 defense and top defense based on some stats. Their second best defender is Royce O’Neale who is 6’4 and always guarding the opposing teams best guard/forwards.  We got two undersized guards in Mitch and Conley and then Bojan Bogdanovic.  That impact of Rudy Gobert carrying the defense is directly comparable to a superstar leading an offense and making players around him better.
"Wiggins, Oubre and Wiseman aren't big names, unless you're referring to people's knowledge of them. But just because more people know Wiggins than Bojan Bogdanovic doesn't mean he's a better player"
"Every time I see Taylor Jenkins with his mask on, I think it's Bojan Bogdanovic"
Taylor Jenkins always looks like Bojan Bogdanovic to me lol

Bojan Bogdanovic - Wizards
Bojan Bogdanovic is closest thing to Klay imo. Not as athletic and could easily give an efficient 20+ if given more opportunities.
"I think he’s talking more about the D’Lo version of the Nets vs signing KD and Kyrie as Free Agents.   Sean Marks creating a Playoff team in Brooklyn is what lured Free Agents.    Even if the Nets didn’t get Kyrie and Durant I fully believe that the Nets would still be in that 5-8 seed range even without the Play In stuff they added.   Sean Marks flipped Thad Young to the Pacers for a 1st that became Caris LeVert and Pacers owe Nets their 2nd round pick  this year as part of it.   Traded Bojan Bogdanovic to the Wizards at the deadline for a 1st that became Jarrett Allen. Had to take on Andrew Nicholson’s $ that was later traded for Allen Crabbe.   Traded away Brook Lopez to the Lakers and got back D’Lo for taking on Mozgov’s terrible contract.    Even though Marks did make a boneheaded move in taking on Allen Crabbe’s contract without getting “Draft Capital” when Portland didn’t want to pay him anymore. He was still able to dump Andrew Nicholson’s contract to help mitigate the $ since Crabbe was a solid player for the Nets before his knee gave out. Just overpaid because of the massive 2016 Cap bump.   Sean Marks with no control over Brooklyns picks created the Nets core of D’Lo, LeVert, and Allen out of Thad Young, Bojan Bogdanovic, and Brook Lopez. That’s a pretty solid return considering Wizards let Bojan walk after a few months, Lakers let Lopez walk to chase “Stars”, and Thad Young left Indiana for Chicago.   Not to mention hitting on Dinwiddie and Harris who were in the scrap heap."
Kenyon Martin----Aaron Gordon(there isnt a great one for this)  Keith Van Horn---Bojan Bogdanovic/Tobias Harris   Kerry Kittles----Will Barton  Richard Jefferson----yeah I guess Bridges isnt bad

Who can't he guard here? LeBron? If that's the standard to hold people to then noone can defend the 3.   That list is chopped liver. That list is ass^2.   The problem isn't Klay at the 3. It's your other 2 perimeter defenders are too small to guard the 3 and not good enough to defend premiere 1's and 2's. Klay at PG, SG, and SF is a good defensive team. Andre checked the Wing's because he does have more size (fair) but also because Klay was taking their best guard (most often the best player on the opposing team). He didn't get the assignment because the Warriors had another premiere defensive wing so he didn't have to, not because he couldn't."

What if MJ doesn’t make The Shot to beat the Jazz in 6  What if Bojan Bogdanovic didn’t get injured last year before the bubble  What if Mike Conley had made the three in Game 7 vs Nuggets   And what if he had been healthy vs Clippers
"I think the Clippers/Rockets/Suns are all built differently from one another, that goes to show that it CP3 is way more malleable than he's given credit for.  In terms of maximising his team, he needs to be the primary ball handler to be at his most effective. Great scorers who don't need the ball in their hands and benefit from being able to focus solely on scoring (I'm thinking Booker and KD)  A defensive centre who can help him bring the defence together (prime CP3 with current Ayton would be an even crazier defence) but the key factor here is (*setting good screens.** That's CP3's #1 necessity and I can't see him doing well without an elite screen setter.  And really after that, you're looking at pretty basic team structures that would work. 3nD wings/guards, a good bench, a stretch 4 (or an efficient post up big)   His all-time ideal team (without going for the best player in each position)   Note: players in bold aren't selected together.  CP3  Smart/THJ/ **Booker**  **KD/Tatum/Kawhi**/Ingles/Bojan Bogdanovic  Gallinari/LMA/**Giannis**/PJ Tucker/Crowder  Ayton/Gobert/Embiid   And if I had to pick just one iteration  CP3  Smart  KD  PJ  Gobert  I think CP3 and KD alone would make a top 3 offence in any situation, this team ensures that they'd be elite defensively too."
Yeah I still get PTSD every time I see Bojan Bogdanovic
"&gt;But it still might be closer than it seems because marginal US players are more likely to be in the NBA than non-US players, and not all the top 500 are in the NBA.  I actually agree with this, as much as international scouting has improved, I get the feeling that there's still a lot of guys kicking around the upper tiers of European basketball who could have been nba players but just slipped through the cracks. Of course this is more my gut feeling than a data backed hypothesis.  I would be really interested in a closer look at the topic of basketball in ex-Yugoslavia. My casual count has put the total around ~~17~~16, but I might be missing some, and this includes an iffy one in Cedi Osman.  Serbia: Bjelica, Jokic, Marjanovic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Smailagic, Pokusevski  Slovenia: Doncic, Dragic, Cancar   Croatia: Bojan Bogdanovic, Samanic, Saric, Zubac  Bosnia: ~~Bender~~(overseas this season), Nurkic  North Macedonia: Osman (born there, plays for the Turkish NT)  Montenegro: Vucevic"
Can someone explain how some of these teams with a decent amount of NBA talent have to play all these qualifiers while others don’t?  Also Bojan the better Bogdanovic
"&gt; Doncic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Jokic, Vucevic - starting lineup  Team USA would beat that team. If anything, because they'd know there's an actual rival you'd see a full US A-list roster and then the deck would be overwhelmingly stacked."
"If hypothetically  Yugoslavia was still a country which is area of just 20 million people, that team could rival USA in a one off game at Olympics for sure.   Doncic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Jokic, Vucevic - starting lineup"
"(I could be getting wooooshed) This is Bojan Bogdanovic, who plays for the Jazz.   Bogdan Bogdanovic (no relation afaik) plays for the Hawks.   Very similar and confusing names."
Rajon Rondo  DeMar DeRozan  James Johnson  Kyle Kuzma  Clint Capela  Ricky Rubio  Bradley Beal  Bojan Bogdanovic  Al-Farouq Aminu  Kosta Koufos  Jarrett Jack  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Kyle Korver  Gerald Green  Markieff Morris  Marcus Morris  Bismack Biyombo  Tristan Thompson
"Saw him destroy Bojan Bogdanovic the other day in the Olympic Qualifiers. Bruno was all over the floor, almost had a double double. His 3pt% in the French league was like 43% I think."
No. He tore his wrist and had surgery on it like Bojan Bogdanovic and Romeo Langford the last two seasons.
Currently Bojan Bogdanovic. All-time I think the consensus is Drazen Petrovic.
"That's basically what happened with the Pacers, too, when he was here. Everyone was quick to credit Dan Burke, but McMillan coaches up defense everywhere he goes. Guys like TJ Warren, Doug McDermott, Bojan Bogdanovic, etc. were all known as scorers and sub-par defenders before playing for the Pacers. I'd categorize all of those guys as average or above-average defenders now. McDermott mentioned in an interview that a big part of it was approach and buy-in. They tailored specific defensive assignments based on likely player matchups, so it was easier to follow from a defensive standpoint."
"Literally nobody else except for Mike James can create their own shot on the Hospital-edition Nets during the Bucks series...I wouldn't trust Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, Jeff Green, or Blake Griffin dribbling the ball in their hands the way shot creators would to find their shots. The fact that KD dropped 49 and 48 while playing the entire game and being the only focus on defense for Milwaukee as well as being guarded by PJ Tucker who has been regarded as ""the KD stopper"" going back years now, yeah that's insane  At least for the Jazz, an on-and-off Conley, Jordan Clarkson, Bojan Bogdanovic, and even Joe Inglés can kinda create their own shot, the other Nets played as the beneficiaries of playmakers like Harden and him being hobbled showed consequences on the court"
"We have Conley's expiring that we could sign and trade to match him if the Blazers wanted to tear it all down and rebuild, but i don't think it solves the Jazz' problems, and I don't think that Blazers are going to just deal their best player in franchise history for a bunch of bad picks. If the Jazz were going to sign and trade Conley for anyone it'd be an athletic switchable two-way wing or smth like that.   We could also trade Gobert for him too, but again, I think both teams say no to that because then the Jazz are fielding a roster where our second biggest player is Bojan Bogdanovic and we're starting three undersized guards which just sounds like a terrible idea that would crater our defense, and i don't think that a Gobert / CJ /Nurk big 3 is really a stellar idea for the Blazers either lol."
"I dunno he's just born tall lol. Not biggest fan of most centers, especially limited ones like Zubac.   Bojan Bogdanovic is only true baller in Croatian team."
"LeBron's most hyped up run where he carried a ""weak team"" (2018) was such a cakewalk (and Kevin Love was an all star that year btw).  Victor Oladipo and Bojan Bogdanovic took him to 7 in round 1. Got the mentally weak star-less Raptors in round 2. Then got taken to 7 by the baby Celtics with Kyrie and Hayward out and Tatum a rookie.  KD would have easily carried Cleveland to the finals that year too."
Nets almost traded Bojan Bogdanovic for Noel back in 2017.   Brooklyn ended up sending Bojan to the Wizards for a 1st that became Jarrett Allen instead.   Believe the trade broke down over draft compensation. Noel was also dealing with a bunch of off court stuff that made him look bad at the time like the reports of him trashing the house he rented.   Without the Wizard trade the Nets likely don’t get Harden since Allen wouldn’t be on the roster.   It’s the same kinda butterfly effect of OKC bailing on the Lopez for Reggie Jackson trade that eventually led to KD and Kyrie in Brooklyn.   OKC at the last second sends Reggie to Detroit who then Max him before his injuries instead of Brooklyn. Nets trade Lopez to LA for D’Lo which leads to them making the playoffs and become attractive to Free Agents.
Nope https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/sports/basketball/bojan-bogdanovic-brooklyn-nets-washington-wizards-trade.html
"G - Jamal Murray  G - Mikal Bridges  F - Bojan Bogdanovic  F - Ben Simmons  C - Klieber  Bench:  F - Covington  G - Hardaway Jr  C - Gasol  Everyone on this team are good 3 point shooter and do not require the ball to be effective.  Murray and Bogdan are capable of getting their own shots and play-making.  Simmons would be the main ball handler as well as the main screener and roller.    Defensively, this group can switch 1-5.  Switch Kleiber or Bog with Covington for an even more elite defensive unit depending on the matchup,  Switch Gasol in when facing embid, jokic etc"
"2017 - give the ball to Paul George and let him do whatever he wants. Fair enough at the time, but given what other coaches were doing in the conference it was definitely uninspiring.  2018 - Surprising to even be at that spot, but Vic was playing like a top 10 player at the time of the playoffs but the Cavs countered simply by double-teaming him and we just couldn't figure it out at all.  2019 - Did not make a single adjustment once Vic went down, so much to the point that out late game crunch time offence consisted of Bojan Bogdanovic ISO-ball, because that's what we did with Oladipo in.  2020 - Did not seem to know what to do on offense with Sabonis out that didn't involve hoping TJ Warren goes nuclear. Ran tons of pointless weaves against the Heat that almost always involved switching onto and then driving straight at Bam Adebayo for some reason.   Neither of our descriptions of what happened between those years are fair but it's quite a bit more complex than you might be making it appear."
Bojan Bogdanovic had 4 despite playing in all 72.
"Sixers need more shooting. I could see them being interested in the likes of Bojan Bogdanovic, Bertans, Ingles, Harris, Kennard, Mook, Gallo, Eric Gordon"
"The real question is what if every NBA player with the surname ending in “ic” just formed an Eastern European basketball squad go play against an iteration of Team USA.  You’d have Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Nikola Vucevic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Boban Marjanovich, Jusuf Nurkic, and Goran Dragic.  That in and of itself of NBA players is a ridiculously good team and would probably require the BEST American NBA players to commit to beat."
"Bogdan Bogdanovic, Bojan Bogdanovic  More Bogdans available across various sports and in general across most of Eastern Europe."
"I wanted to see him get some minutes, but Ersan isn't a good defender at all now. He's slower than Gobert and Favors, and he can't defend drives.   The spacing would be nice to have, but therein lies another issue this series exposed that I don't see enough discussion about: the Jazz lack isolation scoring. You can space the floor all you want, but Joe Ingles and Bojan Bogdanovic can't beat their man off the dribble. The only healthy player we have that could do that is Clarkson. When the Clippers switched 1-5, they forced the Jazz to beat them via isolation, and they couldn't do it."
"Why do they not let Bogdanovic shoot. Why is Donovan asking him for the ball just to chuck the shots, just like last game, after Bojan hit 2 threes in row this quarter."
"He seems like a likeable person, and, I think he's a decent offensive coach, but, it didn't seem like he and previous Washington GM, Ernie Grunfeld, were on the same page during his hiring in 2016. The moves the Washington front office made that summer did almost nothing to help further the team's success, as they relied in the starting unit all season, along with some production from Bojan Bogdanovic, after a trade for his services.  After Brooks' initial season, Washington became financially stuck (*NOT including Wall's supermax, since it didn't kick in for 2 more seasons. In 2017, Otto Porter received a max contract, making him the highest paid player at $27M/yr, while Ian Mahinmi already signed to make $16M/yr, as a frequently injured 30+ yr old, back up C*), so, the team could hardly make substantial roster changes."

Sign Bogdam Bogdanovic and Bojan Bogdanovic and it’s the spiderman meme all around
"Joe Ingles and Bojan Bogdanovic are not available for trade. ""According to sources"" smh"
"It was actually 80 million and here’s a list of players making the same or more than him next season.  Bojan Bogdanovic, Jarrett Allen, Clint Capela, Jerami Grant, Harrison Barnes, Gallinari, Gary Harris, Tim Hardaway, Buddy Hield  It’s honestly hilarious how Pelicans fans think losing a 38% 3PT shooter on high volume that plays borderline elite defense and has great synergy with Zion is a good thing…  That defense is going to be godawful this season.  Who’s your best defender? Hart? JV? Lmfao"
Bojan Bogdanovic? Isn’t he Crotian?
"This article right there means when you see a player from Turkey on second round, get him. Mehmet Okur, Ersan Ilyasova, Omer Asik, Cedi Osman, Zaza Pachulia, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nemanja Bjelica..."
Isaiah Thomas is not better than Bojan Bogdanovic.

"Deandre Ayton, OG Anunoby, Draymond Green, Malcolm Brogdon, Bojan Bogdanovic, Jonas Valanciunas, Tobias Harris, Gordon Hayward nkt on the list.  I would take out Michael Porter, Collins, Ball, Edwards and replace them with Draymond, Hayward, Harris, Ayton.  But I guess the sentiment is correct and Id have Collins at least top 60"
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."

"FIBA allows national teams to have 1 naturalized player, so some Euro teams offer citizenship to decent US players who have no chance to play for US national team. Cedric Simmons is one of those. I'm not sure now, are you talking about the place of birth or citizenship or ethnicity of these players? I see that you placed Bojan Bogdanovic in Bosnia so I'm guessing it's the place of birth?"
"Washington's offseason 2016 moves was an extreme blunder that should be talked about as much as draft busts. The moves they made that summe, and the next summer, left them stuck, well before Wall's supermax kicked in.   *Quick run down (after being paid dust by KD, and, missing out on signing Al Horford):   Signed Scott Brooks at $35M/5yr, making him one of the highest paid coaches at the time. Also, hired another former coach of KD to the staff. Frank Vogel was hired twice during the span of that deal, first by division rival, Orlando Magic.  Signed Ian Mahinmi at $64M/4yr, making him a higher paid player than then-starting C, Marcin Gortat. Mahinmi was also turning 30, while coming off a severe injury that kept him out for a heavy majority of the subsequent season.   (*Horford was also about that age, but, also significantly better than Mahinmi).  Signed Jason Smith at $16M/3yr, adding another 30+ year old C to the mix. In that first season with Washington, he averaged less than 15 minutes per game, for the first time in 5 years.  Signed Andrew Nicholson at $26M/4yr, after being a benchwarmer for a poor Orlando Magic team. Theoretically, he could shoot, but, he couldn't play, resulting in Washington trading away a first round pick (who became Jarrett Allen) to the Nets, for Bojan Bogdanovic. Nicholson was then traded to the Trailblazers (for Allen Crabbe), who stretched his contract.   In 2017, Washington signed Otto Porter at $106M/4yr, making him the highest paid player on the team, two years before Wall's supermax kicked in (Wall signed his new deal that summer). It also resulted in Bogdanovic leaving, meaning the first round pick they traded was for a rental of Bogdanovic.  None of those players were tradable for a roster upgrade, besides possibly Otto Porter (seemed like inking Porter's deal put a time clock on Kelly Oubre's time in Washington). Otto was a highly useful player, but, that contract was a brutal amongst everything else. And, for about 3 years, Washington was reduced to signing players to vet minimum deals (or, splitting the taxpayer MLE) so the team was stuck in place, while surrounding EC opponents built rosters with depth."
"Team World reshuffled:  Starters: Doncic, Murray, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Giannis, Jokic  Bench: Rubio, SGA, Bojan Bogdanovic, Sabonis, Embiid  Wildcards: Simmons, Gobert, Siakam  Unsure if he counts: Kyrie"
"i dunno this seems like fair market value for a guy with his numbers  17/3/4 on 45/41/75 shooting  that's around where THJ was and he got 18m/yr without the team option.    thats around what bojan bogdanovic scored and he is on 18m/yr.  and fournier is 4 years younger than bojan.  its better numbers than kelly oubre and dennis schroeder who each want over 20m  and amusingly that's close to what buddy hield had last year and he is on a max deal, albeit a really dumb contract to give out by the kings"
"tbf, that's just sort of what you sign up for when you draft someone as good as Zion right away. Mitchell's signing accelerated the timeline of a Utah team that people thought would be tanking after Hayward left, and after his sophomore season they went all-in with the Conley trade and Bojan signing. Luka being as good as he is has done the same thing for the Mavs. Hawks wouldn't have gone after Bogdanovic, Capella, or Gallo if Trae Young didn't pop off as a rookie and a sophomore. That's just what happens when you draft someone with the potential to be a superstar nowadays."
This is the reporter version of the Bojan vs Bogdan Bogdanovic issue.
"But specifically the Kahn era. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2G-s67xp70) chronicling David Kahn's reign of terror makes me sad and angry every time. Everyone remembers passing on Steph twice, but we also gave away guys like Ty Lawson, Chandler Parsons, Nikola Mirotic, and Bojan Bogdanovic to name a few, for cash basically."
"yeah, like a joe ingles, jordan clarkson, bojan bogdanovic"
"He's not any less athletic than most other players though. People honestly only say he's unathletic because he's white. I saw a thread a few weeks ago where some people were calling Bojan Bogdanovic unathletic, but he has some great lower body strength.  You don't see people talking about Harden or Lowry or Boogie being unathletic. \*shrug\*"
"No one in this draft will be better next year than JV was last year. I'm guessing JV will be better than whoever they draft for the next 3 years at least, the only issue is you can't foresee injuries.  The trade works because the teams are working on two different time frames. The next two years don't matter as much for Memphis as they do for the Pelicans. The trade may also be expanded. At the very least the trade will allow them to sign or cheaply trade for another starting caliber player, likely 2 starters or Lowry. That, plus development from Zion, BI, NAW and possibly Jax makes them a playoff team and possibly a top 5 seed.   There are still a lot of unknowns though, so I'm holding off my grading of the trade and prediction for next year for now.   It is possible Griff bungles the next part. But I'd be shocked if we don't add at least one of  Lowry, Brogdon, Duncan Robinson, Ingles or Bojan Bogdanovic and there is a good chance we get two guys off that list because of that trade."
"Trading one of those picks for the Jazz Bojan Bogdanovic would be nice.  But Aside from trading Wiggins or getting a large exception from an Oubre sign and trade, it'll be tough for the warriors to match the salary."
"""Bojan Bogdanovic, Joe Ingles, Josh Richardson, Landry Shamet, Aaron Holiday, and a variety of picks are being dangled in trades talks.""  With all due respects to those players, no player goes from untouchable to ""Landry Shamet's available; let's test it out!""   Keep in mind the organization we're talking about. They pissed away a dynasty with KD/Westbrook/Harden because they *might* (and turns out wouldn't have) gone into the luxury tax by resigning him. Shai's getting $100+ million after this coming season. OKC is far from being good and have confused themselves with an NFL team where a bunch of mid-to-late-first-round draft picks actually are worth more than a star player."
Bojan and Bogdan Bogdanovic
"3 Bigs and no shooting guard?  Yeah you lose, even from a worse (on paper) team.  Starting 5 is never your best 5. You have to have team that can execute plays and defend on the other end. How can you defend the perimeter with 3 bigs (+Bojan). Fournier would go for 40 against such a team, not 28.  In short , replace Vucevic w Bogdan bogdanovic and you have something resembling a team. I mean you still get cooked in the perimeter . At least you do not have 3 big bodies being stuck in screens for half the game."
"Luka - Bogdan Bogdanovic - Bojan Bogdanovic - Vucevic - Jokic   Dragic Micic Saric Nurkic Zubac Bjelica   I dunno if they win, but that roster is probably on par with the US roster."
I think his best comp would be Bojan Bogdanovic for his ceiling. Wouldn’t take him before the end of the lottery.
"Agree on Euro players not being soft anymore, but Gobert and Giannis are bad examples. Gobert is one the biggest athletic bigs with one of the longest winspan and limited offensive game. I'd consider him a better smarter version of Javale McGee. Wouldn't have matter where he was born. Giannis started playing very late and barely played in Europe. If anything, his game and body was developed in the NBA.  Better examples would someone like Bojan Bogdanovic or Tomas Satornsky. Guys who learned and played in the Euro League as adults before joining the NBA."
Nuggets win it all with PJ Tucker and Bojan Bogdanovic.
you could easily bench Sabonis and put in the other Bogdanovic - he's been pretty good. That way Bogdan could play the 2 and Bojan could play the 3. Both natural positions too
Just using NBA players they are all pretty stacked:   &amp;#x200B;  **East Europe**:   C: Nikola Jokic / Nikola Vucevic / Jonas Valanciunas  PF: Domas Sabonis / Kristaps Porziņģis / Lauri Markkanen  SF: Giannis / Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic /   PG: Luka Dončić / Goran Dragic   &amp;#x200B;  **West Europe:**  C: Rudy Gobert / Clint Capella / Mac Gasol  PF: Maxi Kleber / Pau Gasol / Jakob Poeltl  SF: Danilo Gallinari / Nic Batum   SG: Evan Fournier / Frank Ntilikina  PG: Dennis Schröder / Ricky Rubio  &amp;#x200B;  **Asia/Oceana :**   C: Steven Adams / Aron Baynes  PF: Rui Hachimura / Andray Blatche  SF:  Joe Ingles   SG: Jordan Clarkson / Matisse Thybulle  PG: Ben Simmons / Patty Mills  &amp;#x200B;  **Non-USA Americas:**   C: Chris Boucher / Dwight Powell / Lucas Nogueira  PF: Kelly Olynyk / Tristan Thompson  SF: Andrew Wiggins / Bruno Caboclo / Nicolas Brussino  SG: RJ Barrett / Dillon Brooks   PG: Jamal Murray / Facundo Campazzo / Raul Neto
"Luka, Bogdanovic, Bogdanovic, Giannis, Gobert  Jokic&gt;Gobert, but not on this team imo. Gobert and Giannis create an incredible defensive frontcourt, which is especially important when none of the other 3 are good defenders. Jokic also shines when the play is run through him, which wouldn’t happen as often as you’d want with Luka and Giannis out there  Chose both Bojan and Bogdan because their shooting is needed, and really there just aren’t  many great options for European players outside of the big men"
"The clip you can't find is the Rockets-Jazz game in 2020. Westbrook kicked it out to PJ Tucker in the corner, and he buried a three to put the rockets on top with just a couple seconds left. The rockets announcer was like ""PJ TUCKER FOR THE WINNNNNNN""  Subsequently, Bojan Bogdanovic went on the other side and nailed a tough 3 on the inbounds play and the Jazz won.   Search up ""Bojan Bogdanovic Game Winner vs Rockets"" and you'll find the clip"
Stephen Curry  Bradley Beal  Jerami Grant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Myles Turner   With a bench of  Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine  Bojan Bogdanovic
That's child's play. Bojan Bogdanovic had a 35/0/0/0/0. The man is on the court to get buckets and he knows it.
casual take and you're 100% wrong lmao. you think the jazz has been a top defensive team lately because of bojan bogdanovic/jordan clarkson/georges niang/arguable their second best defender royce  o'neale(who struggles against quicker smaller guards)?  tell me you don't watch basketball without telling me you don't watch basketball
"Idk about myself but a National Bogdanovic Association would be fun, Bojan and Bogdan just going at each other for 82 games + playoffs"
"The best Kawhi defender I've seen is freaking Bojan Bogdanovic of all people. Unfortunately, that's the only guy he can defend."
"Corey Kispert, Doug McDermott, Bojan Bogdanovic"
"ideally-   a true lead playmaking point guard that can shoot. i.e Kyle Lowry   wings- one wing that can shot create and shoot, one wing that is a good catch and shoot threat on volume. i.e: Zach Lavine and Bojan Bogdanovic   center- kristaps porzingis or (if we’re trying to make the cap work) jaren jackson jr. dario saric or kelly olynyk off the bench.   that gives him ample spacing, competent defense and other guys that can shoulder on ball creation loads. don’t think that’s like a tile team but that team would “maximize” ben simmons.  they would struggle on the boards"
"Bogdanovic has Olympic, World, European, Euroleague and East NBA finals. He has a far better career than Bojan and he is a better player and it is funny to compare. Sabonis and Vucevic have stats in weak clubs where they have huge usage. See now how many stats Vucevic will have besides LaVine, DeRozan, Ball etc. Not even close from Orlando."

"Not the best class, but I instantly thought of Isaiah Thomas in 2011. #60 pick   Besides him, they had Bojan Bogdanovic, Chandler Parsons(before injuries), Etwaun Moore, and Davis Bertrans.   Justin Holiday was undrafted that year too."
"lol. I wish, we didn't have a decent NBA player in last 25 years. Edit : forgot about from Bojan Bogdanovic"
"Everyone is always worried about ruining a team's relationship with future free agents.    Presumably, free agents want to get paid.  If you are willing to be the top bidder for (non-max) free agents, they will go to you.  You could have a horrible image as a franchise...if you had max cap space and offered Fred Van Vleet, Bojan Bogdanovic, or Malcolm Brogdon a four-year, 25% max contract in free agency with 5% raises, they'd sign with you.  You'd be offering them more than anyone else did.  And you'd get a high-character, highly-skilled good player."
Bojan Bogdanovic for Bogdan Bogdanovic
"Look Gay has never been a good defensive player. He's solid no more no less. Just like Bogdanovic.   On the other hand , Bojan is their best shooter , can create his own shot and attack the basket efficiently. I still believe he can the best 4th man in a championship team.   Look at it this way: In all the favorites to win a championship this year (Bucks, Nets ,Lakers), their 4th best player is not better than Bojan."
"No Joe ingles, Rudy Gobert, Hassan Whiteside, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley, Bojan Bogdanovic, or Rudy Gay.  Let's go, Royce, lmao."
Bojan Bogdanovic the most athletic player in the league https://c.tenor.com/3fHNTJbpz08AAAAC/strong-big-arms.gif

She said she just saw it in a store somewhere and thought it looked cool"
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
I was going to joke that Bojan Bogdanovic is like John Smith in Croatia but there are more Bo*an Bogdanovices in the NBA than there ever were John Smiths.

"He's a bust relative to his draft position. He's the former #1 pick, athleticism reminiscent of a young Vince Carter, and easily had the potential to be the next superstar.      He's NOT a bust relative to the rest of the NBA. He's a Harrison Barnes, Otto Porter, Bojan Bogdanovic type of player. Strong scoring wing who can play defense when necessary."
"CJ has literally been one of the best 2nd options at guard in the league for the past 5 years. 76ers fans don’t understand that for most teams a 2nd option is not Anthony Davis or James Harden.

You don't have to make the all star team but your name should be in the 5 or 6 ""snubs"". Like Lou williams that one year."
"i swear every time bojan bogdanovic drives to the basket it's a turnover. he came to the jazz has a 3pt sniper, still pretty decent at it, but i cannot stand how often he drives (ily still bogey)"
Bojan Bogdanovic - Bogdan Bogdanovic
"Bojan Bogdanovic. Dude has been putting up 17+ PPG on really good percentages for the last 4 years, is a borderline all-star, can create his own shot, is actually really fun to watch, and he barely gets talked about.   I would put Evan Fournier in this category too, but he's been getting some media attention lately."
Bojan Bogdanovic averaged 23ppg on 48/41/91 shooting in the 15+ games that Donovan Mitchell missed through injury last season.       He gets less consistent shot attempts since our system has a lot of ball movement but he can absolutely step up and be an automatic bucket when needed.
"G clarkson  F ingles  F bojan bogdanovic  C rudy gobert   ...and now we just need to yoink a point guard, so lets take doncic there"
"Bojan ""the better Bogdanovic"" Bogdanovic"
Are you seriously saying Donovan Mitchell and Bojan Bogdanovic are average shooters? We literally broke the record for most 3s made per game last year. Plus Clarkson and O’neale are hardly poor shooters either.   The Jazz have a lot more offensive firepower than the warriors. This isn’t 2017 anymore. Golden State was a bottom 10 offense last year and it’s not like they made *that* many changes in the offseason. Utah has still been a top 5 offense this year despite shooting very poor from 3 to start.
"I was recently shocked to learn Bojan Bogdanovic played for the Nets and Wizards . . . I just assumed he was a career Pacer before joining the Jazz, even though he only played two seasons in Indy. I also think of Thad Young as a Pacer, even though he spent three years there and seven in Philly."
