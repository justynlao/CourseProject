nets listing their social media coordinator on the injury report  who the fuck is nicolas claxton
How many players do you expect to be part of most teamâ€™s playoff rotation?  3 open roster spots. The Brooklyn Nets just need a wing to replace TimothÃ© Luwawu-Cabarrot. DeAndre Jordan has played well in national televised games this season. I believe in Nicolas Claxton more than JaVale McGee...
Donâ€™t sleep on Nicolas Claxton. I just hope Steve Nash plays him when he is available. Never know with a coach that gives TimothÃ© Luwawu-Cabarrot and Landry Shamet too much playing time.   The Charlotte Hornets are lacking a big man though.
"nah man, that's Nicolas Claxton"
I donâ€™t want JaVale McGee on the Brooklyn Nets. Heâ€™s too small. I trust James Harden defending bigs more  than JaVale McGee. Man is shooting 3 point shots now too. Hard pass.  Nicolas Claxton is a more talented and smarter version of JaVale McGee.
"Imagine thinking one of Kyrie Irving, James Harden or Kevin Durant wonâ€™t be at the court at all times excluding blowouts. Embarrassing.   Youâ€™re sleeping on Nicolas Claxton. Nets getting a DPE for Dinwiddie too?"
Does this mean their backup Center at the moment is Nicolas Claxton??? And they literally have no assets now to try and make a trade to improve bench.
all this to stop nicolas claxton
"I'm amazed at their ability to just produce these guys. I thought it was pretty much going to be the big 3, and then Joe Harris...and the rest would be trash.  I happily admit I was wrong. Bruce Brown and Nicolas Claxton have really showed up."
We dont need KD when we have the real goat Nicolas Claxton
"To all the non-nets fans, remember the name Nicolas Claxton. Because in the playoffs you wonâ€™t forget it."
Future MVP Nicolas Claxton.
nicolas claxton
Nicolas Claxton should be coming back soon (he's listed as questionable for the tomorrow for the first time this season).   He's someone who a lot of Nets fans like and can hopefully be much better than Jordan - though I guess it still wouldn't hurt to have another center just in case.
"It's something bigs or rolenplayers do in games. Sometimes you can go long stretches withojt touching the ball in gsmes if you're not the primary ball handler. Going 15 mins without touching it and then immediately being expected to catch it and dunk/lay it up in 1.2 seconds can be a bit jarring so players will ask to touch it during free throw situations if they are right under the hoop just to remember the ""feeling"". Deandre Jordan used to hand it out to the rookie Nicolas Claxton during free throws as a little vet move just so they can both get to touch it a little bit in these situations."
"OP listed Bruce Brown, Nicolas Claxton and Landry Shamet for the nets lol  Rambis was a solid enough role player"
2019 was a big draft year for the Warriors. Really though the only real mistake they made was not taking Nicolas Claxton.   2018 was the bigger mistake not going with Mitchell Robinson.
Nicolas Claxton is the best center in the NBA.
Everyone is crying about Blake and LMA. But the player they should be crying about is Nicolas Claxton. He's clearly the Nets' best big.
"underrated: nicolas claxton  overrated: jaylen brown, smart"
"Hey man, they also didn't get Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, or Nicolas Claxton"
"&gt;Yes the Brooklyn nets are being carried by joe Harris, Spencer dinwiddie, and Nicolas Claxton. Definitely not the other players on your team.  That's not what you said. You said that we have 0 homegrown talent on the team, not players carrying the team. Stop shifting the goalposts.  &gt;Youâ€™re being downvoted because youâ€™re acting like he created some amazing feat.  Going from being the worst team in the league, to title favourites in the space of 5 years is an incredible feat. I sense jealousy  &gt;You were the only place that kd and Kyrie could come together that was better than the knicks. Thatâ€™s it.  There's 30 teams in the NBA. It's not just the Knicks and Nets.   Brooklyn had no draft picks or young talent when Marks took over. He regained draft picks by taking on salary dumps (Zeller, Mozgov, etc.) attached with picks, and drafted very well, landing guys like LeVert, Allen and Claxton. He found some absolute hidden gems in the g-league in Harris and Dinwiddie, and took a chance on guys with high potential like DLo. He hired Atkinson as coach, who was terrific in developing these young guys, and making them play incredibly hard, fun basketball. Marks targeted 2019 offseason to make a splash in free agency, as he made enough space for 2 max players. Our change in culture, combined with our very promising young core, and respected coaching staff/front office made KD and Kyrie want to come here.  I can't tell if you're being intentionally ignorant or you're just salty. Why don't you educate yourself on everything Sean Marks has done as GM since he got the job in 2016. It's absolutely nothing to do with being ""straight lucky"". He's a guy that Popovich constantly talks about being one of the most intelligent individuals he's ever coached/worked with."
"Yes the Brooklyn nets are being carried by joe Harris, Spencer dinwiddie, and Nicolas Claxton. Definitely not the other players on your team. Youâ€™re being downvoted because youâ€™re acting like he created some amazing feat. No. You were the only place that kd and Kyrie could come together that was better than the knicks. Thatâ€™s it. Now you have a bunch of ring chasers chasing the ring this year thatâ€™ll inevitably come after harden forced his way out of Houston onto the nets. You had almost no rebuild. It was straight lucky"
"So Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie and Nicolas Claxton don't exist then?  Why the fuck have I been downvoted into oblivion for stating that our GM has done a terrific job rebuilding this franchise from absolutely nothing, to the best in the league? You people are so fucking delusional."
1. KD 2. Harden 3. Kyrie 4. Joe Harris 5. Nicolas Claxton 6. Jeff Green 7. Bruce Brown 8. DeAndre Jordan 9. Blake Griffin 10. LMA
Nicolas Claxton
Nicolas Claxton
get used to hearing nicolas claxton
Nicolas Devir Claxton.
Kevin Durant   James Harden   Kyrie Irving   Blake Griffin   PJ Tucker   LaMarcus Aldridge   Andre Drummond   DeMarcus Cousins   DeAndre Jordan   Joe Harris   Jeff Green   Landry Shamet   Bruce Brown   Iman Shumpert   Nicolas Claxton   Tyler Johnson
"Two major things I think get overlooked by people who doubt the Nets.   Number One is that James Harden is an offense all by himself.. The idea there is no chemistry is a little overstated because Harden has the ability to just say I got everything and I'll get everyone their shots. And while the big 3 havent played much together, all the role players have with each guy, and there's no visible case of anyone not understanding their role, which brings me to number 2, their role players are kinda underrated.  Joe Harris you all already know and recognize what he brings  Blake Griffin is averaging 10/5/3 on 51/40/78 shooting. He serves as an additional playmaker and veteran presence that can knock down his shot.   Nicolas Claxton has been great. He's a very versatile big defensively and has really good on/off splits this season.   Bruce Brown is also a solid guy off the bench. Plays hard and solid defense and is a tremendous rebounder for a guard."
James Harden - Back  Landry Shamet - Slump busted  Nicolas Claxton - Fucking beast  Patty Mills - Nets Killer  Our Defensive Rebounding - Trash  Our Defense Against 3rd Stringers - Still Trash  Game Over - W!!!!!
Nicolas Devir Claxton and James Edward Harden  that is all
Nicolas Devir Claxton   that is all
"Nets have played 27.  In order of total minutes: Joe Harris, Kyrie Irving, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, James Harden, Landry Shamet, DeAndre Jordan, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Kevin Durant, Tyler Johnson, Nicolas Claxton, Blake Griffin, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Chris Chiozza, Taurean Prince, Reggie Perry, Alize Johnson, LaMarcus Aldridge, Mike James, Spencer Dinwiddie, Andre Roberson, Norvel Pelle, Tyler Cook, Rodions Kurucs, Iman Shumpert, Noah Vonleh"
Nicolas Claxton
"Not only have we barely seen the Big 3, but we've never seen the team at full strength overall.  Nicolas Claxton made his season debut after the last game that the Big 3 played together. Blake Griffin signed after that too. Both guys have become key pieces.   So we have yet to see a game where all of KD, Harden, Kyrie, Harris, Claxton, Blake, Green, Shamet, Brown, etc. play.  Like, if Harden was able to play in the last two games and Claxton was able to play more than 5 minutes in one game (coming off of COVID), I think the results may have been much different."
"You are VASTLY overstimating how much those picks are worth. 31st pick int he draft:  2020 Tyrell Terry, Stanford - Dallas Mavericks   2019 Nicolas Claxton, Georgia â€“ Brooklyn Nets   2018 Elie Okobo, France â€“ Phoenix Suns   2017 Frank Jackson, Duke â€“ Charlotte Hornets   2016 Deyonta Davis, Michigan State â€“ Boston Celtics   2015 Cedi Osman, Anadolu Efes â€“ Minnesota Timberwolves   2014 Damien Inglis, France â€“ Milwaukee Bucks   2013 Allen Crabbe, California â€“ Cleveland Cavaliers   2012 Jeff Taylor, Vanderbilt â€“ Charlotte Bobcats"
"Lol that 2019 season that the Nets made the playoffs was also the first year they got their pick back, so of course it wasn't a lottery pick ðŸ˜‘ they traded that pick anyway for a 2nd rounder, which became Nicolas Claxton"
"A lot of guys on the Nets honestly.   Landry Shamet, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, Jeff Green, Blake Griffin, Nicolas Claxton...  I can see any one of them stepping and making a big contribution."
Yeah no you're right but the exact reason is wrong Nicolas Claxton LEBRON doesn't add up to the amount listed here.
"Well obviously the stat's flawed, it has Nicolas Claxton as a top 10 impact center."
The requirement to start at center for us is to not be named Nicolas Claxton clearly

I too think Nicolas Claxton is really handsome
"I was watching a Nets game with my dad the other day and apropos of nothing other than him being onscreen, my 60-year old mother wanted to know who Nicolas Claxton was because she thought he was really handsome."

"""Aye, this is Nicolas Claxton, Kevin Durant is trying to get in the locker room!"""
Nicolas Claxton has been impressive for role player. Dude really fucking hustles and gets some key blocks and rebounds.
Posting up against Blake Griffin and Nicolas Claxton?  Oh he's gonna struggle badly against them. /s
and nicolas claxton
don't you dare forget about nicolas claxton
"Jeff Green is injured and Nicolas Claxton is basically a rookie who is still learning. Deandre is terrible, so we need to give Blake minutes."
Not sure why this was downvoted. Nicolas Claxton is going to be very good for them very soonâ€¦ if healthy next year they are going to terrorize the league.
Nicolas Claxton
That's sir Nicolas Claxton for you
Slim reaper for KD  The Alchemist for Nicolas Claxton
"PG - Harden SG - Irving SF - Joe Harris PF - Durant C - DeAndre Jordan / Nicolas Claxton  They need a back up forward and back up guard and the 8 man rotation is set.  I can see two of the players below deciding to sign a cheap deal to get a ring with the Nets.  Guard - Victor Oladipo, Goran Dragic, Lou Williams, Derrick Rose, Eâ€™Twaun Moore  Forward - Danny Green, Andre Iguodala, Paul Millsap, Reggie Bullock, Markieff Morris"
"Breakout: Nicolas Claxton, Cam Reddish, Darius Garland(if they trade Sexton)  Fall off: Julius Randle, Lebron(injuries and old age are piling on him) and Klay Thompson(if his injuries zap his full star power)"
"I believe the Nets traded Trevor Booker for Nik Stauskas, Jahlil Okafor, and a second-rounder. That pick turned into Nicolas Claxton, who seems to be the entirety of the Nets' young core."
How did Nicolas Claxton manage to play exactly 1 second?
Nicolas Claxton: *0:01*
Trade everyone and build around Nicolas Claxton
"Nets bench with ZERO shots.  2 rebounds, 1 assist, 3 fouls.  Jeff Green with 13 minutes.  Landry Shamet with 7 minutes.  Nicolas Claxton with 1 second."
found the worlds biggest nicolas claxton fan apparently
did nicolas claxton actually play for 1 second or is that a typo lol
Nicolas Claxton	0:01  &amp;#x200B;  lol
"I feel like this says everything that needs to be said about this metric  11 - Nicolas Claxton  12  - Dorian Finney-Smith  13 - Nikola Jokic  tie 17 - Kawhi Leonard, Ben Simmons"
You mean how much help Nicolas claxton need
Ehhh its close but yes I would take KAT and Ant over the two best Nets players (DeAndre Jordan and Nicolas Claxton ofc)
Nicolas Claxton
"&gt; Nets - Mills **Harris** Brown Claxton  Joe Harris? He's not coming off the bench.  Right now the only guys who seem to have guaranteed rotation minutes off the bench are Patty Mills, Bruce Brown, and Nicolas Claxton.   I would not put the Nets in the top 5."
"1. What do you mean ""another""? 2. What were they realistically supposed to get in the trade? Spencer Dinwiddie was a UFA who everyone knew was leaving. He could've just signed with a cap space team and the Nets would have gotten nothing.  3. That completely random Capela ""rumor"" by the random fan (not even some low-level writer, but literally just a random fan) on Twitter seems to have given people completely unrealistic expectations of what was going to happen. 4. The current roster includes Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, Patty Mills, Bruce Brown, and Nicolas Claxton. I think they'll be fine."
Nicolas Claxton
"Harder to build a great team around Giannis than KD because Giannis needs much more space to work with.  KD can thrive next to Bruce Brown, Nicolas Claxton, etc.  Giannis needs four shooters around him to do what he just did."
"Nicolas Claxton, Al Horford, Rudy Gobert, Deandre Ayton, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Clint Capela, Semi Ojeleye (lol), Myles Turner, Kawhi Leonard, Marc Gasol, and Bam Adebayo have all been ""Giannis stoppers"" at some point or another. Last two have been pretty good though"
Is Nicolas Claxton that beautiful? I guess he's kinda cute.  Oubre is on a whole nubba lebel doe
Go traditional Brooklyn... Big 3. James Johnson. Nicolas Claxton. Save the bodies of Blake and LaMarcus for the playoffs. Bruce Brown starting is laughable. Save Joe Harris and the Big 3 for end of games.
"Nicolas Claxton. His defensive potential is DPOY levels IMO and Iâ€™m not saying this because heâ€™s on our team. He has nearly the same body like Giannis did when he came into the league so he can definitely put on major muscle on in the future.   And while he never did this in the season, he can shoot the ball and dribble well for a big man as he did in college. He has all the intangibles, he just need to put on strength and work on offense."
I think Nicolas Claxton is the prefect guy to play next to KAT.
"Decent depth?  Be honest, had you even heard of Bruce Brown or Nicolas Claxton a year ago? Them being on the Nets makes them seem better than they are. Just like overrated ass Caruso and Kuzma on the Lakers"
Nicolas Claxton. That man has the KD/Giannis body and itâ€™s oozing with potential
"&gt;*Can James Harden do for Nicolas Claxton what he did for Clint Capela?*  To me this is more *'Can Claxton do for Harden what Capela did for Harden?""*  Clint is a big part of the Hawks offense and defense and he's easily one of the best centers in the league. His defensive IQ is high and man can just go up and grab anything. (He can also go up and block almost anything, making players second guess if they want to put any feet in the paint. A great, great power to have on your team!)  And Trae's floater looking exactly like a lob is a damn game changer for Clint."
Nicolas Claxton is genuinely trash.
Idc Nicolas Claxton the hottest NBA player more than Kelly Oubre
"Claxton at 31 still has massive potential too, in my opinion.  Kevin Porter Jr, Jordan Poole, KZ Okpala, Keldon Johnson, Nicolas Claxton is a seriously solid team of late, consecutive picks. KZ should be set to step up a bit in Miami this season."
"&gt;ere might be another Draymond Green or Paul Millsap who's about to make his breakout that was drafted in like 2019 that just isn't on our radar right now  That 2019 second round coincidentally has a lot of guys who could pop off this season:   Nicolas Claxton, KZ Okpala, Daniel Gafford, Eric Paschall, Isaiah Roby, Talen Horton-Tucker, Terance Mann, Jalen McDaniels.  Then there's the ultimate wildcard in Bol Bol."
really havenâ€™t been impressed with nicolas claxton. is he usually like this or is this just an off game?
Jevon Carter-Bruce Brown-Sekou-LaMarcus Aldridge-Nicolas Claxton starting lineup lets go
"1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett 4. DeAndre Hunter  5. Darius Garland  6. Tyler Herro  7. PJ Washington  8. Rui Hachimura 9. Brandon Clarke  10. Matisse Thybulle 11. Keldon Johnson  12. Kevin Porter Jr   I'd take all of those guys ahead of him for sure, and then the debate for thw other two top-14 spots is between:  * Jordan Poole * Nickeil Alexander-Walker * Cam Johnson  * Cam Reddish * Darius Bazley * Nicolas Claxton * Terance Mann  * Lu Dort (whowent undrafted)  There's definitely a debate to be had, but I'd be leaning Cam Johnson and Lu Dort."
KPJ -&gt; Nicolas Claxton
"Yâ€™all are the No. 1 seed purely on the back of beating bad teams, lmao.  Believe me. No contenders fear those pretenders without Kyrie.   But keep pretending that washed James Harden (one of the biggest chokers in NBA history), Nicolas Claxton (a G-League player) and Joe Harris will be the saviors here, lmao."
