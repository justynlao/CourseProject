"Hornets:  Ball  Bridges  Washington  Graham RFA rights  McDaniels  Hayward  Rozier  Monk RFA rights  Unprotected: Cody Martin, Caleb Martin, Vernon Carey, Nick Richards, Grant Riller"
Nick Richards has been doing really well in the G League!
nick richards can never be called up now
"I’ve been saying the jury is still out on the Hornets FO. Word around the street is that MJ isn’t taking the Hornets seriously (more concerned with the 200 mil he lost in the GME thing atm) , which worries me a lot . Mitch Kupchak doesn’t inspire so much trust , and I don’t think the Hornets expected Lamelo to be this good this early just like everyone else    Ideally you want a big guard to pair with Lamelo in the backcourt of the future , and get a young center to grow and develop with the team (Vernon Carey and Nick Richards are developing in the G league rn, Biyombo and Zeller simply wont cut it so I hope they develop into something special)  A young wing would also be nice , since Hayward is going to be more injury prone the older he gets . So Big Guard - Lamelo - Bridges - 2 way Wing - Above average Center   As a fan of the Ball family I’d love it if Lonzo went to Charlotte but I don’t think the Hornets want to give Lavar more power lmao   There’s a lot of politics but I hope things work out for the better"
Nick Richards looks shockingly competent compared to where I assumed he might be at based on the total lack of playtime he got when Cody was out. Could be solid if he gets more minutes.
"We gotta give Nick Richards more play. No way he’s worse than Biyombo , right?"
"there might be a lot of new blood in the playoffs this year. 12 members of the Hornets were drafted (or went undrafted and picked up) by Charlotte since the last time we made the playoffs in 2016, and have never played anywhere else. We're not a lock for the playoffs now, but are a play-in team.  Malik Monk, Miles Bridges, Devonte' Graham, PJ Washington, Jalen McDaniels, Cody Martin, Caleb Martin, LaMelo Ball, Vernon Carey, Nick Richards, Grant Riller, and Nate Darling have never seen the NBA playoffs.  Hayward (Utah and Boston), Rozier (Boston), Wanamaker (Boston), Biyombo (Charlotte and Toronto), and Zeller (Charlotte) have been there before."
"This is pretty misleading.    The three second rounders were Grant Riller (PG), Vernon Carey Jr (C) and Nick Richards (C)   Riller has barely played any minutes and as one of the last picks in the draft he is likely very raw.  Graham, Rozier, Monk, Wanamaker and a Martin in front of him makes sense if the team is trying to be competitive. If it's garbage time the HC has gone with two-way player Nate Darling, whom I would assume is closer to being ready for minutes than Riller is.    The Martin problem: Cody Martin has been a decent bench guy throughout the season and has no reason to be replaced by Riller or Darling at any competitive moment of basketball.  There was an in-depth writeup on this on /r/CharlotteHornets the other day.    Caleb Martin, the UDFA Martin, is quite raw but has shown flashes.  He just came off a 15-10-3 game against the Lakers, one of the best teams in the NBA.  I could still see Caleb being significantly better than Darling/Riller at any competitive stages of basketball.    Bismack Biyombo may have stone hands but he is the only defensive player and true rim protector  the team has in the front court. If there's anyone on the roster that even has a chance to attempt to slow down the other team's best bigs it's going to be Biyombo.  Throwing out Vernon Carey (who I really believe in) or Nick Richards at this point will get them eaten alive on the defensive end in the paint, while still allowing the shooters to drop buckets from 3 as we've seen all season.    I do think we will see some of these players in the closing weeks, and really there is no point not to because the Hornets players are dropping fast, but to say that there's no reason why these second rounders haven't played is just inaccurate."
"Hornets protect:  Ball, Rozier, Bridges, Washington, Monk (RFA rights), Graham (RFA rights), McDaniels, Hayward*  Hornets leave unprotected:  Vernon Carey, Nick Richards, Cody Martin, Caleb Martin  UFAs unable to be claimed:  Biyombo, Zeller, Wanamaker, Riller, Darling  --  * I would honestly consider leaving Hayward unprotected- I really don't think an expansion team would want him taking up so much cap room given they operate under a reduced cap for the first couple years, it would be incredibly restrictive. But I do think that Hayward does have some amount of trade value,  so we shouldn't risk it just to save Vernon Carey, who would definitely get snatched up by an expansion team."
"If Mobley falls to the Cavs and they are insistent on trading Jarrett Allen, I wonder how this trade stacks up...  New York receives 11  Charlotte receives 19 + Jarrett Allen  Cleveland receives 21 + one of Nick Richards/Vernon Carey  New York consolidates quantity into quality and gets into the lottery, Charlotte receives their new big man and still stays in the 1st, Cleveland gets a decent 1st round pick for Allen"
You just have to be really extreme to get attention on here. You can’t just say “he has some weaknesses”   You gotta say Gobert is a fraud who shouldn’t even be starting in the NBA and you’d rather have Nick Richards on tour team.
"Mirotic's contract with Barcelona was for 6 years and $79 million and he signed it before Covid. Covid is why he took such a big paycut the following year. Not disagreeing with the rest of your points, but I'd still like to know about which exact players somebody's talking about when they're supposedly better than some NBA players. I think the figure is 90-95%, and not necessarily higher than 95%.  I have trouble believing that Mo Bamba would have a good career with Real Madrid, or that James Wiseman would be a whole lot better with Fenerbahce. Here's a short list of Eastern Conference players currently with contracts for 2021-22 who I don't think should be in the NBA:  1. Udonis Haslem  2. Devin Cannady (Magic)  3. Mo Bamba  4. Cassius Winston (Wizards)  5. Nick Richards (Hornets)  6. Sam Merrill (Bucks)  7. Kelan Martin (Pacers)  8. Sekou Doumbouya  9. Cory Joseph  10. Kevin Knox  11. Jabari Parker  12. Paul Reed (Sixers)  13. Sam Dekker  I'm sure there's a few more in there."
"We got rid of Zeller and Biz, and now have Miles Plumlee, two young centers we drafted last year (Vernon Carey Jr and Nick Richards), small ball PJ at the 5, and Kai Jones.   So I'd say it's improved a fair bit, but it's not amazing. I'm expecting bigger things for Richards and VCJ this year. We'll probably be alright."
"to comply with all the sign and trade rules, there's almost a guarantee that Mason Plumlee + Martin twins are heading out to one of these teams, maybe one or both of Carey and Nick Richards. We do not have a way to acquire both of Oubre and Markkanen using cap space or salary matching from Devonte' Graham S&amp;T unless Markkanen is making less than $8M or something"
I’d be surprised if nick richards is still on the roster. I expect Thor and Kai to be in the g-league a lot
"Plumlee/Kai Jones/JT Thor/Vernon Carey/Nick Richards/PJ Washington is the full list of guys who’ll likely play at C. Richards is absolutely ass so I doubt he’s on the roster past next season, PJ is a smallball 5, Plumlee is the vet/likely starter and the rest are projects."
"Hornets protect LaMelo, Bridges, Washington, Hayward, Rozier, McDaniels, and the RFA rights on Graham and Monk. That means one of Vernon Carey, Nick Richards, Cody Martin, Caleb Martin is available to be selected. I don't like parting with Carey but ours is a pretty easy top 8."
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but Nick Richards should start over Plumlee"
Kai Jones is raw and will only see g league action for like a year or two. He has severe tunnel vision and doesn’t understand defensive positioning yet. The current backup bigs are pj and nick Richards. Bol bol can easily take Richards minutes.
Today we love Nick Richards
We will be seeing Nick Richards minutes tonight...   Oh god. Congrats on the W Boston
We will give you Nick richards and mason plumlee
"Oh no, what will they do without Thon Maker, Cedi Osman or Nick Richards?!"
"Nick Richards, Cody Martin, and Vernon Carey won roster spots over him, so draw your own conclusions."
I have always hated Nick Richards. He is one of my least favorite UK players in recent memory.
Bismarck biymbo and Nick richards are worse
Plumlee at this point is nothing more than a mediocre C who will only hurt Lamelo as he is neither a good rim runner or spacer. Zeller's biggest issue has always been health but when playing he was easily better than Plumlee. Honestly I wouldn't dislike the Plumlee move as much if we paired him with another rotation big instead of having Nick fucking Richards as the backup center

bruh why do we keep playing Nick Richards
"I'm mildly worried about Vernon Carey not making the roster, he's hardly played in the preseason while bum ass Nick Richards plays.  I think I'd rather have an empty roster spot over Nick Richards or Wes Iwundu... maybe Cody Martin too, but I'm indifferent on him.   As long as our roster includes:   Ball/Smith   Rozier/Bouk   Hayward/Oubre/McDaniels     Miles/PJ/Thor   Plumlee/Kai Jones  I don't really care who the end of the bench guys are."
"This matchup is light work for him lmao, he's going up against PJ (literally 6'7) and Nick Richards (pretty much no NBA experience). Straight manhandling both of them."
"How is Nick Richards nowadays? I absolutely could not stand him at UK, and seriously think that I took some time off of my life with how much he would piss me off. But I always deep down liked him and thought he had some potential."
now switch Harden and KD with Cody Martin and Nick Richards
"Gotta be honest. He hasn't been remotely rotation caliber this year. Our center room is him, Nick Richards, Kai Jones, and Vernon Carey and I have no real desire to ever see Plumlee play again."
"The Hornets don't have a center, hence the strategy. Nick Richards was on pace to foul out in like 12 minutes. There is nobody else"
Peep Nick Richards crying laughing on the bench
Gordon  Terry  LaMelo  Miles  PJ  Cody Martin  Bouknight  Kai   Honorable mentions to Jalen McDaniels and Nick Richards
"Basically ever since Kupchak came in the Hornets have rarely made a wrong move:  * Hired Borrego, who's done a great job of cultivating a strong culture and atmosphere around the team, and has helped develop a lot of our guys. He's got his flaws no doubt, but he's nevertheless done a solid job.  * Drafting. His first draft netted us Bridges and Graham, Bridges is a stud and Graham turned out to be good (just didn't have a role by the time his deal was up). His second draft got us PJ (who's solid when healthy), Cody Martin, and Jalen McDaniels (both of whom are among our better defenders). Then last year he drafted LaMelo along with Nick Richards, who out of nowhere has become probably our best center (as recently as preseason he looked like trash).   * The Kemba-Rozier swap looks better every day.   * Hayward's provided the perfect vet savvy for a young team, although I still hate that we stretched Batum to make the $ work."
"I like Nick Richards, and think he can be a solid back up in due time, but hes not a starter. Hes basically playing because Pj's been out."
"Wizards making hornets bench look incredible defensively. Nick Richards, Cody Martin and Jalen McDaniels own the 3rd quarter tonight"
Melo's hit some 3's.  Only has a foul but he's lucky he doesn't have two. Kyle Kuzma thinks he's much better than he is. Nick Richards met his dad Daniel Gafford. Good first quarter but you haven't missed much.
Love to see it. Nick Richards does look afraid tho lol.
"Uk graduate reporting to say I sure thought we had a chance to win a championship the year he was here. In an a non Covid season cut short timeline, the Maxey, Quickley, and Nick Richards team was rounding into form for a run. Congrats to having him as the PG of your future."
"Ok I didn’t ask yesterday but I gotta know, who the fuck is Nick Richards?"
"Mason Plumlee has been hot garbage this year. If we had anybody else at center, he'd certainly be out of the rotation already, but nope, Mitch Kupchak looked at the roster and thought Plumlee, Kai Jones, Nick Richards, and Vernon Carey was good enough."
"It's rare I go to bat for JB, but he's pretty far down the list of things wrong with the team at the moment. No coach is getting this team to the top 6 in the east as long as Mason Plumlee, Nick Richards, Kai Jones, Vernon Carey is our center rotation. We could cut all of them but Kai, replace them with free agents  like Noah Vonleh, John Henson, Harry Giles... And be noticeably better off than we are now, that's the state of our frontcourt. I thought Plumlee would basically be Zeller with less ball skills and more physicality but he hasn't even been replacement level, he's disgustingly bad."
the best center in the league is whoever Mason Plumlee or Nick Richards is going up against at the time
"I agree, which is why it's so baffling why Nick Richards is getting so few minutes and Kai Jones has yet to see the floor. Idk, maybe they're hoping Vernon Carey Jr. will bloom. He's in the G league rn"
"Or we wind up having our wings dig so much on drives that we give up wide open threes (thank god we're not doing that so far this year, but might have to against someone like Embiid)  Point being, it's completely unacceptable to neglect the C position like Kupchak has. Kai Jones might be the answer in like 4 years, but if we're trying to do anything with the Hayward/Rozier timeline, don't do some half measure BS, go out and get a legit starter... plugging that hole with Mason Plumlee barely even qualifies as a half measure.  And the backup situation is rough, at least make it look like you care, by trying out some competent C's that don't have a team at the moment. Dieng, Vonleh... The idea of having Plumlee as a starter and Nick Richards as a backup in a playoff series against Embiid or even Adebayo/Capela is laughable."
Really impressed with the Hornets resilience. We’ve only had 1 game where we have been ahead at halftime. This was a 26 point game that we closed to 5 I think in the 4th. This should have been a blowout. Some notes: Lamelo has had 2 bad shooting games in a row. I think they said on the broadcast he was a little sick. Gonna need more from him down the stretch.  I don’t really like Borrego’s reluctance to play his youngest players Ish and McDaniels weren’t on today you gotta see if Bouknight gives you more. I’m not sure why Nick Richards didn’t get any time when we are getting killed on the boards.   Overall it’s impressive what this team is doing without their leading scorer from last year but I’m worried about long term because this team needs its draft picks to develop and learn to play as quickly as possible.   Heat defense is legit. Bam killed us on boards. In the first half it felt like the Hornets get one shot-Heat get 2-3 every possession. Being sound defensively and having Herro getting 20 from the bench every night is a lethal combination.
"Kai Jones, JT Thor and even Nick Richards all not getting playing time seems rough. Plumlee is good but limited and can get lit up in certain matchups. Those guys can’t be that much worse."
