CJ 2.0 or CJ Elleby
"It depends if you mean players overall or players who should actually get minutes at the NBA level. CJ Elleby is technically on our team, but the thought of relying on him is terrifying."
Oh god CJ Elleby is in and on Westbrook LOL
CJ Elleby is about to get significant minutes. Oof.
"&gt;the Blazers are definitely dealing w more injuries  I don't care who you think should start, only replying to the quoted bit -- and that's not true.  Blazers have played 17 games thus far, and every one of their rotation players played at least 12/17 games (70.5%). CJ played 13/17 (76.5%). The only ones playing fewer than 12 games were Little, Elleby and Blevins -- not rotational players -- and Collins who's been out since before the season started.  Mavs have played 18 games thus far, and 4 players in the expected 8-man rotation have played 9 or fewer games (that's 50% or less). The 8-man rotation have missed a combined 60 (that is 41.7%) of available games."
"It's Game 4 of the NBA Finals. Dame has valiantly led an 8-man Blazers squad of Melo, Ant, Nas, Giles, Kanter, Elleby, and Hood to this point, but they simply don't have the firepower to take on the Nets star trio of KD, Kyrie, and Harden, as the Blazers are currently down 0-3 in the series. Kanter is even questionable for Game 4 after breaking his Ramadan fast with 77 McDonald's cheeseburgers.   The Rose Garden goes dark for player introductions, when faintly over the arena speakers you hear CJ say...   ""On your left.""   ...   ...   ...  Nets in 5"
"I dont need a dumb format, all you need to know is CJ Elleby is the next GOAT"
CJ Elleby is a poor mans bruno mars
Seth Curry for CJ Elleby? Score!

"There was a game we had this season vs philly, where we sat dame. CJ Elleby, our rookie 2nd round pick, got heavy minutes. There was SO MANY philly fans reassuring us how they were going to lose etc. This is the opposite - we've been so fucking bad against top teams, if the jazz are even halfway playing like their normal game, we're not going to win this lol"
CJ Elleby is already a top 2 CJ on our team.
Damn CJ Elleby shade?
"CJ actually has the second best def rating on our roster this season behind nurk (blevins and elleby dont play enough to count). obviously hes not a better defender than djj or roco (3rd and 4th) but he was actually pretty good this year, much better than usual"
"CJ is definitely on the table. CJ Elleby, that is."
Shame that CJ (the good one: Elleby) didn't pop off in garbage time smh
"Yes players can improve.  That doesn't mean they will.  My whole point was it feels like Elleby peaked in his first real game, and I predict he'll be out of the NBA soon.   Calling someone's floor a 10th man means garbage time.  Almost no team runs 10 man rotations, especially after the early season games where teams sort out who get minutes.   Elleby frankly has no floor, as he has never played a minute outside garbage time save that one game.  We were also missing 4 starters (Dame, CJ, DJJ, Nurkic) and two other pieces in Collins and Little in order for him to get those 31 minutes, which was the 6th most for our team that game."
"So mine doesn't fulfill the requirements.  I didn't think he'd be a star, and he isn't out of the league yet.   CJ Elleby.   After we drafted him last season, he didn't get an opportunity until disaster struck and we were missing 4 starters and like 3 bench pieces for a game against the 1-seeded 76ers.  Elleby was basically the reason we won that game in a massive upset, despite Embiid putting up gaudy numbers.   That was his first opportunity for minutes, and he showed up big time.   The hype went into full effect.   Us Blazers fans thought Olshey had done it again, continuing a trend of good 2nd round picks.    He has not looked good since.  While we will probably ride out the season since his contract is guaranteed, many have called to cut him to sign a training camp player such as Marquis Chriss.  It was a short lived hype, but Elleby's first game with minutes may end up being the best of a short-lived NBA career.   All that said, I'd be ecstatic to be proven wrong and for Elleby to become a rotation quality player for us."
"If we're talking about CJ Elleby, yes"
CJ “The Closer” Elleby at the table
Looking at you CJ Elleby
Cj Elleby for Embiid and you got a deal
I'll tell CJ to start packing.  Elleby that is.
Hell yes…I’d absolutely take Simmons straight up for CJ (Elleby).
"Yo Nets, CJ Elleby and Keljin Blevins for Kyrie right now, let's do this"
"I would love to keep Marquese Chriss because we need a 3rd big, and waive CJ Elleby"
"It would be a steal for Portland if CJ Elleby is traded for Ben Simmons.    But seriously, a straight up swap is the ideal transaction. Morey is just asking for too much. CJ McCollum would be fantastic for the 76ers. He would do 99% of what Lillard could do for them. Ben would finally fill the hole in the wing that the blazers needed since Batum left."
Neil then countered by saying we'll do a CJ for Simmons swap and left off the Elleby part
Just keep driving his trade value into the ground. Sixers will beg Portland for CJ Elleby by the time this is over.
"when Rodney Hood and CJ Elleby receive all-star game votes, it's a sign players should not vote on any award."
"At this point, the Sixers will be lucky to get CJ Elleby straight up for Simmons."
Westbrook.   Dragic.  Simmons.  CJ Elleby.
Cj elleby
CJ Elleby also came up through the Wazzu system. He knows how Klay thinks. He'll be our secret weapon to shut him down.  /s
CJ Elleby and Blevins if you’re lucky
Enjoy CJ....Elleby
They mean Cj Elleby.
Well I mean you can have Cj...Elleby.
"And CJ Elleby, not McCollum."
You'll take CJ Elleby and you'll like him.
Cj Elleby is worth more than your entire roster combined.
"Ok, CJ Elleby for Simmons straight up, final offer."
"Excuses. The Blazers entire starting lineup besides Covington missed that game, while the Sixers were only missing Ben Simmons. And even if you guys were missing more players, you still got torched by CJ Elleby, who honestly doesn't belong in the NBA right now.  It's literally two games under .500, at the start of the year, and with Dame in a horrible slump. Not to mention how they absolutely destroyed the Suns, Grizzlies, and Clippers. I guess the Bucks, Hawks, and Celtics will miss the playoffs this year by your logic."
If this keeps going it will probably be CJ Elleby and picks. lol   Norman Powell or CJ McCollum is too good for just Ben Simmons at this point in time. Philly will have to throw in a pick or two if they want CJ McCollum.
"That game reminded me of when Blazers 2nd and 3rd string won against a great team and I just looked it up and it happened to be versus the 76ers on February 4th lol. Damian, McCollum, Zach Collins and Nurkic were all hurt. We had CJ Elleby (not McCollum) on the floor for 31 minutes. I guess ya'll got your revenge"
It's blasphemy in r/ripcity but CJ for Simmons is still on the table...  CJ Elleby
"Hes washed, winner gets CJ elleby the goat"
CJ Elleby is nasty
Dame/CJ Elleby
"I don't think either team does this, but Zach Collins+ CJ Elleby for PJ Tucker, straight up.    I would rather have Collins if he were healthy, but he's missed a lot of time recently.  I don't think he will be in rhythm or have chemistry come playoff time, and he needs a new contract next year, both for which are detrimental for a 'contending' team in Portland.  Tucker is very reliable and a strong vet.  He provides defense and 3pt shooting, which would be a great complement for our back court.    Elleby is an unknown.  In a couple of games, he's shown potential, especially that 76er game where we had only 1 starter and 6 missing players total.  But, one game isn't enough to give him high value.  I would think the Blazers would be higher on him than any other team.  Still, I think Rockets could be smart to take a swing on Collins.  Worst case, he's expiring.  Best case, he has a lot of potential.  You could argue he overlaps with Wood, but I think they could coexist.    I would be sad to see Z. Collins leave and not fulfill his potential here.  But, if we do not have him involved in a bigger trade deal before the deadline, I'd like to see him swapped with Tucker"
Fine. CJ Elleby isn't too bad of a haul
Green Lantern (cj Elleby)
"Hey now, the Dameless (and down 3 other starters) Blazers led by CJ Elleby blew out the 76ers led by Joel Embiid just a couple weeks ago"
"Worst player is the rookie CJ Elleby. Worst in the rotation? Hard to answer because current rotation vs healthy rotation is different, but I'll say Giles"
He's got nothing on CJ Elleby.
Dame has CJ Elleby
Game before last Portland played CJ Elleby and Keljin Blevins.
Crazy to think we're really just 1 healthy CJ Elleby away from the NBA Finals...
No CJ Elleby
"anytime we play a seriously short handed team, I rightfully expect some no-name bench player to go off  I was eyeing the recent Blazers game and was like “hmmmm, looks like it’ll be The CJ Elleby Game” and he had like 16 points or something lol"
Hey man don’t throw around the FrailBlazers like CJ Elleby isn’t the second coming of Christ step back from three steal the inbound dunk on your head 😤  please basketball gods just let us end the season healthy
CJ Elleby watches anime as part of his pregame routine but I don’t know if he watches basketball anime.
But who’s guarding CJ Elleby? 🤔
"the rule is that if you get lit TF up by CJ Elleby, you are ineligible for player of the week"
So does CJ Elleby now that I look at it.
CJ Elleby
"Most recent 2nd round pick by Portland, CJ Elleby."
"I try not to think about the possibility of him, CJ Elleby, and no COVID last year. It only brings pain."
"You just had to get CJ Elleby out of the picture, huh?"
Yeah- CJ Elleby
"Okay, what's Joel's excuse for losing to the Blazers last year when Dame, CJ, DJJ, Nurkic, (and Collins if you wanna count him) were all out with injury?  Our starting lineup was Gary Trent Jr., Rodney Hood, Robert Covington, Carmelo Anthony, and Enes Kanter.  Our bench was Simons, CJ Elleby, and Harry Giles.  And Joel Embiid lost.  Can you just accept that single game results are just that, single games?  Nearly anything can happen on a daily basis, and you should not come in here and belittle or gatekeep it."
"I want the Damian Lillard experience. I mean, can you imagine? Getting to hang out with CJ Elleby *every day*?"
CJ Elleby. He seems lost out on the court. Even in SL he looked awful. I don’t know why he’s taking up a roster spot
Roco and CJ Elleby is fine too!
"Siakam for CJ Elleby, straight up."
What they don’t realize if they keep this up they might only be getting CJ Elleby and not McCollum.
He’s not worth RoCo and a pick more. CJ + a lottery protected 1st + a 1st round swap. If you really want more you can have the god that is CJ Elleby
Ok add CJ Elleby and a first and that’s gotta be good
Simmons for CJ                                                   Elleby.
Sixers are going to be pretty pissed when CJ Elleby steps off the plane in Philly.
Cj elleby and 2045 2nd round pick.
"Ok NBA trade machine accepted this:  Portland Receives: Jrue Holiday, Donte Divencenzo, Pat Connaughton  Milwaukee receives: Dame Lillard, Anfernee Simons, CJ Elleby"
"CJ Elleby didn’t plays that why we loss, Cj in 4. Cj Elleby."
"Ok, ok, lets all agree if mj saw cj elleby on the court he would run in terror, but if he saw hakeem on the court he would go for the and 1. Two things to from this, Cj Elleby is the goat, and Mj is scared of cj elleby and is afro."
Cj Elleby will be the pioneer for the out of bounds jumping sideways upside down mid range
“Cj Elleby would wipe the floor with these chumps” -me in 2021 describing how good cj would be in 1990s.
"Neither I think CJ Elleby would be good fit, but he is gonna cost 7th and 14th and wisemen and wiggins. I'm a honest warrior fan and this is what we NEED!"
"Kyle Kuzma,Eric Bledsoe,CJ Elleby,Keljin Blevins,Jahlil Okafor,Mason Plumlee,Austin Rivers,Marvin Bagley,Jeff Green,Udonis Haslem,Kevin Love,Andre Drummond,Lebron James,Joe Harris and Deandre Jordan."
Upvoting not because true but because CJ Elleby.
Cj elleby.
Not even for cj elleby. Why will anyone want to pay these guys? Dennis is highly expensive and kuzma is just kuzma
CJ Elleby has all star potential too!
"&gt;	Zach Collins as the lottery pick  &gt;	Trading away Gary Trent Jr  &gt;	Traded 2021 pick to Houston   &gt;	Only young people on the team are Anfernee Simons (good), Nassir Little (eh) and CJ Elleby (no)  If the Blazers don’t win it then we’re not going to have a good time"
"CJ Elleby, I presume"
"Hey now, CJ Elleby has literal GOAT potential. Just look at that hair."
"I will try my best for this bulls fans. Sorry I’m advance if this is shit. Pat Williams, Zach LaVine, Alfarouq Aminu, 2025 bulls 1st unprotected, Bulls 2022 1st rounder unprotected, and bulls 2027 first top 4 protected, Coby White and bulls 2nd rounder this year for Dame and CJ Elleby."
Cj elleby
No way dude. CJ is too important. We’d never give him up. CJ Elleby is too valuable to give up.
"Will Barton 2nd round in 2012  2013 CJ pick #10  Then traded with the cavs for the rights to  Allen Crabbe with low value picks  2014 no draft picks from the Gerald Wallace trade  2015 drafted Rondae Hollis Jefferson with #23 traded to get Mason Plumlee. Drafted Pat Connoughton in the 2nd round  2016 traded for 47th pick Jake Layman  2017 Zach Collins with a trade up to #10, Caleb Swanigan in the 2nd round  2018 Anfernee Simons with #24 and Gary Trent in the late 2nd round  2019 Nassir Little with a late pick  2020 CJ Elleby in the 2nd round.    All these guys got significant playing time for the blazers. Only Caleb Swanigan and Allen Crabbe is not in the league right now.   Crabbe got a huge payday before fizzling out. Barton is a significant role player in Denver. Pat is playing big minutes with Milwaukee. Gary Trent is about to get a fat ass pay check and Simons shot for over 40% on 3 point shooting.   Most of these guys are low value projects turned into solid role players and low end starters. Pretty good draft resume for not having a top 8 pick since Damian Lillard"
Cj elleby
"I wonder if the Mavs would take CJ for KP. CJ Elleby, that is."
"2016: none 2017: none 2018: devontae graham, deanthony Melton 2019: Kevin porter jr 2020: tyrese Halliburton, CJ Elleby  Our bad picks really aren’t the issue"
Simmons for CJ Elleby? Who says no?
Cj elleby?
We will give u cj elleby as well. Djj/cj /Rhj for draymond. 3j for one
Our lord and savior is CJ Elleby
"Thanks Magic. We have two CJs to get the job done. As if CJ McCollum isn't enough, I'm willing to throw in the GOAT, CJ Elleby."
and cj elleby
"If you are really interested in this kinda stuff you should really look into the salary cap rules and contract types  From the quick math i did blazers would already be at $122M before signing the 5 FAs you mention with only dame, beal, turner, DJJ, CJ elleby on the roster"
"We beat the sixers this year when they didn’t have Simmons and we had a literal G-league team (as in, Dame, CJ and Nurk were out and CJ Elleby got major minutes). The team looked lost"
The disrespect to CJ Elleby is clear
"CJ Elleby is a defensive god, only half joking."
"Simons, Kanter, Melo have been the 3 that have played most recently  RHJ has gotten some run during this series  Nas Little has shown some promise but doesn’t get much time  The rest are all varying levels of bad  Derrick Jones Jr, Harry Giles, CJ Elleby, TJ Leaf and Dames cousin Keljin Blevins"
The majestic hair of CJ Elleby has checked in
Give me some CJ Elleby and a Go Cougs in the chat
"They're a team that needs a rebuild or at least a retool but won't. As long as Neil Olshey is in charge they'll be the perennial solid playoff team that won't do anything in the playoffs unless the draw is exactly perfect like in 2019, similar to the Pacers of the West. Olshey is perfectly content just being a middle of the road team. Stotts isn't good but if they lose to the Nuggets he'll likely get way too much of the blame that Olshey should be getting. Don't know how anyone can hope to craft even a top 25 NBA defense starting three players 6' 3"" or smaller and having your two main reserves be Melo and Kanter.   They won't trade Dame but could get a solid wing for CJ which is their biggest need and could maybe a fleece a guard needy team into getting something decent for Simons if they decided to deal him. Need to invest in more young guys like Nas Little or Elleby instead of signing subpar veterans like DJJ or Kanter. They're best draft pick since CJ was Gary Trent and he's not even on the team anymore. Hard to get good players when you're drafting so low every year but they've consistently missed on guys.   Hard to attract free agents to Portland but this team clearly needs a retool even if they beat Denver but I'd be surprised if the front office did anything."
"Let me just go down the roster. There's a lot of unknowns.   Dame - definitely staying  CJ - if we make it out of the first round, I'd say he's definitely staying. If we lose in the first round, who knows. Total wildcard  Norm - another total wildcard. Will he want to stay somewhere he's the 3rd best guard? If he does, how much are we willing to pay a 3rd 6'3 guard who we'll have to play at SF? Repeater tax is an issue as well  RoCo - definitely staying  Nurk - definitely staying  Melo - likely upto him if he wants to play another season. I don't see us not signing him if he wants to come back  DJJ - has a PO for 10mil so he could leave for a bigger role, but idk how much money he'll find. I think he stays  Anfernee Simons - definitely staying (unless we put him in a package for a big trade)  Enes Kanter - likely gonna re-sign him, but definitely possible that we let him walk  RHJ - unless he gets a better offer from somewhere else, I think we'd keep him on a min  Nassir Little - definitely staying (unless we put him in a package for a big trade)  Harry Giles - probably going somewhere else where he'll either get more than a minimum or will get more mins  Zach Collins - another wildcard. How do you come to a fair contract value with someone who essentially hasn't played in 2 years. Gun to my head, we re-sign him even if it's just the QO  CJ Elleby - staying"
MVP: Damian Lillard  DPOY: Robert Covington  MIP: Carmelo Anthony   6th Man: Anfernee Simons  ROTY: CJ Elleby  COTY: N/A
I don’t understand why CJ Elleby is on the team. Dude looks like a college player in the NBA.
"This is a clip of Lillard, not CJ Elleby."
Nope. I think Simmons is more in the CJ Elleby territory now.
I’m sold. Embiid to Pdx for Cj Elleby and some second round picks. Who says no?
I like Thad in Portland actually. And Portland don't need CJ Elleby if they seem themselves as trying to be playoff competitive.
CJ Elleby &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; KD &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Booker and Jrue &gt;&gt;&gt; everyone else

"It's one day into free agency and with their cap space, they only have minimums and the TPMLE available for signings. Both the signings you mentioned are guards. We also have Dame &amp; Ant as dedicated guards and Nas, Snell &amp; Elleby who can play minutes at the 2. That's a lot of guards, it certainly looks like we're setting up for a CJ trade."
"Not even mentioning the GOAT Charles James ""RoLo Jr."" ""Better CJ"" ""sideshow Bob"" Elleby smh"
CJ Elleby holds the crown now.
CJ Elleby doing gods work being with Norm every chance he gets
"A lot of curry missed shots, CJ Elleby would never."
Cj Elleby will be better then his entire career. I'm calling it.
"Dame doesn't allow that much points, I think he is ahead of everyone on his team who plays minutes, I think CJ Elleby, Keljin and Giles are ahead but they only play garbage minutes.  However I do watch a lot of Portland games so I'm not surprised, but generally dame is considered a terrible defender but doesn't allow players to score on him as much as others."
"No, CJ Miles, why would Portland trade Elleby smh."
Cj Elleby
"CJ Elleby, 2 late 2nd rounders and a bag of Doritos Cool Ranch."
Blazers have now amended their offer from CJ McCollum and 3 firsts for Simmons to CJ Elleby and a protected 2nd.
"Washington State:  PG: Dejounte Murray  SG: Avery Bradley  SF: Zach Lavine  PF: Michael Porter Jr  C: Jaden McDaniels  Reserves:  Jaden McDaniels, Kevin Porter, Malachi Flynn, CJ Elleby, Jaylen Nowell, Joe Harris, Isaiah Thomas, Corey Kispert, Robert Franks, Paolo Banchero (Need some size).   Notes:  Michael Porter Jr only played senior year in Seattle so not sure if he really counts.   Avery Bradley played his senior year in Vegas but was at a prep school so I don’t really count it."
"Blazers trade cj for a top 4 pick, that team not understanding they traded for Cj ELLEBY not Cj Mcollum."
"He staying, we have cj elleby and he is his best friend."
"He's been spending the summer in Portland I believe, i've seen videos of him hanging out with CJ Elleby and a few other guys from the team. I think he'll stick with us unless we try to lowball him."
