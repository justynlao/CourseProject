Jaylen brown dropped a 40 piece on the Sixers I think Mitchell will be ok
Clearly you haven't considered Jaylen Brown
"Huh?  He's not very different from his typical career season.  Your numbers are off too.  The only major difference is he's been shooting the 3-ball better, but that is more likely a hot streak than something sustainable.  Bottom line, he's not even a candidate.  Jerami Grant or Christian Wood look like leading contenders right now.  Jaylen Brown has a strong argument too, but he won't get the award given his steady development path."
Imo it should be Christian wood. Love that guy and his mentality. Jaylen brown and Julius Randle are the other candidates if any
Jaylen Brown.  Nuff said.
"Jaylen  brown, Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart, Kemba Walker, Fast PP"
"Here is our roster after your mentioned players:   2 Veterans: Tristan Thompson and washed Jeff Teague   2 Euroleague pickups: Daniel Theis and Javonte Green   9 rookie contracts: Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Rob Williams   Our team routinely is packed with young players with midlevel upside. It's not so much Brad isn't creative enough with his offense, it's just a matter of ability. The team is top heavy and most of these young guys don't know what their ceiling is going to be. Ainge sat on the draft picks and decided he was going to try and build out the roster with young talent instead of trading for established names. It's worked out because Jaylen, Tatum, and to a degree Smart have all worked out, but it's left us top heavy. A contested Tatum 3 is better than Semi Ojeleye doing literally anything. Replace a handful of the rookies with solid veterans and the offense would look a lot better. Despite the fact that it seems like it's not working, Boston is one of 3 teams with a top 10 offense and defense, even with the rotating cast of young players.   Stevens has gotten more than his money's worth in Theis and spun gold out of guys like Jordan Crawford, Jae Crowder, Evan Turner, and others. A good number of former Celtics have gone from Steven's system where they had success to flounder elsewhere.   It may seem boring or uncreative or like bad coaching but if you look at this roster it's a borderline G-League team after the starting 5. This IS the optimized Celtics offense.   Here's the Offensive Rating of the Celtics for each year Stevens has been coach: 27th, 18th, 10th, 8th, 18th, 10th, 4th, 9th   The season we spiked back up to the 18th best offense Ainge made Brad take on **7!!!** rookies, 2nd year Jaylen Brown, no Gordon Hayward, and a hobbled Kyrie Irving.   I hope this doesn't come off as a rant because I really built this comment as I went and it's actually been a frustration of mine with the team overall that we have so many young players, and often undrafted guys rounding out the roster, instead of giving Stevens some older guys to work with. When Stevens had a roster of mid career guys he led us to the #1 seed in the East.   TL;DR  Stevens is a good offensive coach. Boston doesn't have the personnel to do much more than whats on the court right now, but even that is a top 10 offense. When given more established players Brad can spin gold."
Jaylen Brown only knows these people because he's good at basketball though??? You think he's putting up 27 a game because he knows Steve Kerr.
"Jaylen Brown and then Zion, BI, NAW, and Kira Lewis, Jr."
Our Teague is Brad Wanamaker. Oubre is our Jaylen Brown lmao.
I covet Jaylen Brown.
"meanwhile, [this is a representation of Jaylen Brown negotiating his way to the rim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TyxxLHfBwE)"
"He‚Äôs playing like an All NBA player, the discussion should be should Jaylen Brown be an All Star Starter at this point, not if he‚Äôs gonna make All Star"
still wish that jaylen brown would‚Äôve been a rocket...
Jaylen Marselles Brown
JAYLEN MF BROWN
Consider **JAYLEN BROWN**
Jaylen Brown
Have you considered Jaylen Brown?
JAYLEN BROWN.
Jaylen Brown trims his beard like they are hedges in front of a government building.
JAYLEN BROWNüò≥
"For the last hour I thought Kerr was being literal and that he had Jaylen Brown silent in his car for some obscure NCAA reason, lul."
Jaylen Brown is who Wiggins thinks he is
Who wouldve though  Jaylen brown playing worse than wiggins
Would be somewhat interested in Jaylen Brown. He seems to disproportionately struggle with free throws relative to his other shooting splits.
literally everyone in the nba does this except maybe for Jaylen Brown
"&gt; But I can‚Äôt take Jaylen Brown seriously as a top 10-15 player or an elite player for some reason   Probably because his rise was sudden to other fans. But he‚Äôs always been this good, him leading us in scoring against the ECF 17‚Äô proved that.  Unfortunately he got shafted when Gordon came that season after, now that he‚Äôs gone he‚Äôs picking up where he left off."
"Not trying to hate or anything, not baiting you Celtics fans  But I can‚Äôt take Jaylen Brown seriously as a top 10-15 player or an elite player for some reason  I have no idea why, it‚Äôs strange cause he‚Äôs good"
That's just straight up not true.      I made a comment about Tobias Harris' competition but Ben Simmons is also no chance. There are 8 guards in the East (only a maximum of 6 can make the team) that are having a better season than Simmons.      |Player|Pos|Conf|Tm|G|PTS‚ñº|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|3P|FG%|3P%|FT%| :--|:--|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Jaylen Brown|G|E|BOS|18|27.1|5.4|3.5|1.4|0.6|2.6|0.531|0.443|0.756| |James Harden|G|E|BRK|16|24.5|6.4|11.1|1.0|0.7|3.1|0.463|0.371|0.880| |Trae Young|G|E|ATL|19|26.9|4.2|9.0|0.7|0.2|2.3|0.422|0.364|0.887| |Kyrie Irving|G|E|BRK|14|27.6|4.8|6.0|1.0|0.7|2.9|0.525|0.421|0.945| |Zach LaVine|G|E|CHI|19|26.6|5.3|5.1|1.3|0.6|3.5|0.510|0.419|0.881| |Bradley Beal|G|E|WAS|15|34.9|5.1|4.7|1.3|0.6|2.4|0.479|0.340|0.891| |Collin Sexton|G|E|CLE|16|24.1|2.6|4.1|1.0|0.2|1.7|0.498|0.435|0.824| |Malcolm Brogdon|G|E|IND|20|22.9|4.3|7.0|1.4|0.3|3.0|0.457|0.404|0.896|.
"Nice list. I think Jaylen Brown is on the ballot as a guard if that means anything.      Ultimately I feel like 11/12 positions are as good as locked in. The only difference will be the final forward spot. Does it go to Middleton, Bam, Hayward, Randle or Tobias? There's an argument to be made for each of them."
Watching Boston - GSW game and man how good Jaylen  Brown and Tatum actually are. Also how bad Kemba Walker and Tristan Thompson play. It is a good chance using this two maybe even add Marcus Smart and maybe even draft rights to get a good big man. Then we might actually see Boston is one of the best teams in NBA
"As someone who has loved Jaylen Brown from a afar for a few years, I haven‚Äôt actually gotten to see him play much over the years.    He is so different now. It‚Äôs crazy. Like it‚Äôs a 180.   He used to cough up the ball all the time. He couldn‚Äôt dribble. He couldnt drive and finish.  It was like I loved him in spite of those realities.    So now it‚Äôs actually surprising that he kills it in all those areas now.  He danced right around Oubre on that last bucket.   Two years ago Jaylen would have tripped and kicked the ball into the monitors"
If jaylen brown is off tonight  the game's over already
who else remembers that weird jaylen brown steph beef
Jaylen Brown was from the KG PP trade.  Jamal Murray was from the Melo to NY trade.  Dame was from a trade for Gerald Wallace.  Kyrie was from a trade involving Baron Davis and Mo Williams.
The Jaylen Brown Slander.
I hope for another night of Jaylen Brown consideration.
"Unlikely. He'd have to beat out Kyrie, Harden, Trae, Beal, Lavine and Jaylen Brown at least, (Not even including Brogdon and Sexton too) which isn't happening with the Raptors underwhelming season."
The one that comes to mind for me was the Celtics acquiring all those Brooklyn picks. One became Jaylen Brown one indirectly became Tatum.
Shaved head Jaylen Brown
Then you have the Celtics who seem to draft solely based on looks. I‚Äôm not embarrassed to say that the C‚Äôs have the best dynamic duo based on looks with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.
The Jaylen Brown pick was the Nets pick that year which we got from trading Paul Pierce and KG to the Nets. We used another Nets pick to draft Jayson Tatum. That pick was from the same trade.
"How is Jaylen Brown better than Kyrie?,"
Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic are better than either Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Is that really a hot take?
‚Äújaylen brown draft pick‚Äù  first result gives you the answer
I mean Jaylen ‚ÄúMichael Jordan‚Äù Brown is just better sooooooooo.......
Tatum isn't even playing better than Jaylen Brown lol
"PG: Trae, Luka, Fox, Ja, Lamelo   SG: Booker, Beal, Lavine, Jaylen Brown, Murray  SF: Tatum, Ingram, Hunter, MPJ, Bates  PF: Davis, Giannis, Zion, John Collins, JJJ  C: Jokic, KAT, Bam, Allen, Wiseman  I tried my best I hope I didn‚Äôt fuck it royally"
"Jaylen Brown definitely got some new tricks. Jerami Grant ring a bell for you? Wiggins got a huge boost in consistency. Zach Lavine seems levelled up. there's tons of guys that are bringing new or drastically improved skills, in spite of the lack of any off-season to speak of"
"The hill I've apparently decided to die on is that Trae should not be an All-Star this year.  LaVine is on fire this year and should get the nod over him.  Guards: Kyrie, Harden, Jaylen Brown, Beal  Forwards: KD, Giannis, Middleton, Tatum  Centers: Embiid, Sabonis  Wildcards: LaVine, Harris/Hayward"
"PG: Luka, Ja, Trae, De'Aaron Fox, a future player.  SG: Jaylen Brown. Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Donovan Mitchell, Future player  SF: Jayson Tatum, De'Andre Hunter, Keldon Johnson, 2 future players  PF: Giannis, AD, Sabonis, John Collins, Kristaps Porzingis  C: Jokic, Embiid, Bam Adebayo, James Wiseman, a future player"
"Hey its me. Bit late but hopefully the nephews in 6 years will have the patience to scroll down to see the hot takes  PG - Luka, Trae, Ja, Sexton, Lamelo (burning hot take there that definitely won't backfire)  SG - Donovan Mitchell, Booker, Murray, Beal, Lavine  SF - Tatum, Ingram, Jaylen Brown, LeBrons corpse, Wiggins  PF - Giannis, AD, Zion, Sabonis, Simmons (he's a power forward who just likes playing at point guard shoot me),   C - Jokic, Embiid, Bam, KAT, Gobert/Sabonis"
"Well there‚Äôs always gonna be a few guys who aren‚Äôt even in the league right now so doing all 5 for each is a waste of time   But   PG : Luka, Trae, Ja   SG: Donovan Mitchell, Booker   SF: MPJ, Jaylen Brown,   PF: Zion, Tatum, Giannis   C: Jokic, Bam   Left some blanks where I think a player who‚Äôs not in the league will take that spot"
"On the plus side, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are unbelievable."
"I agree Danny Green would be one of the better defenders, the steps Caruso has taken as a defender have made me feel better about the loss. Not sure how how much credit he got for this, but he saved the game against the Celtics a few days ago by defending the easy layup from Jaylen Brown causing Kemba to miss the game winner. Also Danny Green was so frustrating in the playoffs last year I‚Äôm not sure my blood pressure could handle too much more of that Lmaooo"
"Thought Ingram was clearly better then Tatum, but right now he isn't even better then Jaylen Brown. I still think he's around Brown's level despite the difference in their starts but I was not even close about him better then Tatum"
"Note: This is purely fiddling with words, but...  Rookies do need a much longer leash than what fans give them in basically any sport, but admittedly the #1 more pick is rightfully going to get a shorter leash by the media/fans than a guy who went #41, not the best comparison here.  A better recent example is probably Jaylen Brown tbh."
"Bradley Beal, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic, CJ McCollum, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, James Harden, Collin Sexton, Zion Williamson, Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward, Devin Booker, Malcolm Brogdon, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Anthony Davis, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, De'Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell (Bam Adebayo, DeMar DeRozan, and Pascal Siakam are all above 19.5).   How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
"Ok, so then I can spin this back on you and say that Anthony Davis is only 2 years away from requesting a trade from the Lakers if they don't build an adequate roster around him in the event that LeBron suffers a serious injury and is never the same player anymore.   Do you realize how stupid that sounds?   I don't expect Anthony Davis to leave LA. I don't expect Kawhi Leonard or Paul George to leave LA. You shouldn't expect Jayson Tatum or Jaylen Brown to leave Boston."
pleasant: Jaylen Brown becoming an All-NBA player  unpleasant: tristan thompson plays like a grandfather
"Jaylen Brown is definitely part of why you guys are making playoff runs too.  - Harden was already planning to leave the Rockets before Morey and MDA left per Woj.  - I was referencing the Heat when I listed LeBron, not the Cavs.  - CP3, Kyrie, KD and Kawhi all left ""well run organizations"" for personal reasons  Lol keep on looking down at the Hawks, they have a solid team and could very well turn into the Warriors of the next generation if things go right.  Giannis staying in Milwaukee is one example of a star staying counteracted by the many examples of stars leaving. Building a ""proper roster"" is not a guarantee that a star will stay."
"RAPTOR has CJ 7th with Capela, ahead of Lebron, AD, Gobert, KD. It also has Jordan Clarkson and Fred VanVleet as the 15th and 16th most impactful players, above Steph and Beal. It also has Patty Mills ahead of Giannis, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, and Lillard. What an accurate statistic! Advanced stats are meaningless, just use your eyes and you can see Lebron is clearly the most impactful player in the league  edit: Not to mention Shake Milton, Delon Wright, Terry Rozier, Bobby Portis, and Monte Morris have a higher RAPTOR than Donovan Mitchell despite him playing with Conley like you said. Since RAPTOR is such a good stat, Utah's GM should have been fired yesterday for giving 82nd best player in the NBA a max contract when he's no better than Josh Hart."
he's not second to none lmao ever heard of james harden? it'll be even harder for beal this year since harden moved to the east and jaylen brown got much better and actually plays defense. to me brown and harden are the starting guards but you could make a case for kyrie and harden instead
The Celtics trade was actually [KP for Brown and the pick (or a pick swap for the pick) that would have become Tatum](https://celticswire.usatoday.com/2019/11/08/celtics-offered-jaylen-brown-first-round-pick-kristaps-porzingis-2016/).
He‚Äôs no worse than 3rd behind Brown and Ingram. Right now. Personally I‚Äôd put him 2nd behind Jaylen now.   Sabonis is fast closing that gap though. Brogdon is older so not sure if he‚Äôs got another gear but he‚Äôs not far behind either.   Murray is still way behind and I don‚Äôt think Siakam will ever pass Simmons.
Jaylen brown??
You say Jaylen brown &gt; ben simmons as if that alone puts simmons outside the top 5? When brown is top 2? I'm not following the logic
No Ben Simmons wouldn‚Äôt get picked top 5 in redraft  Jaylen Brown &gt; Ben Simmons  Can‚Äôt wait until he doesn‚Äôt make all star team and he can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm ‚Äúall star‚Äù for his reason for not shooting
Jaylen Brown
"I get that Steph is a LOT of people's favorite player, but this sub is wild lol  Really surprised to see Jaylen Brown that high!"
Why?  Why do you want some manufactured personal disdain between athletes?    Grownups can compete their hardest and not make it personal.  You think if AD and Jaylen Brown were best buddies their games would mean any less?  They are grown men with similar lives and similar interests.  Of course they are going to friendly
Jaylen Brown is one
You get the label superstar by doing this regularly for years and showing up in the playoffs and possibly even taking it to another level. Not with a 20 game sample size. I do think Jaylen brown has potential tho.
"East is loaded though. You still have Harden, Kyrie, Trae, Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Collin Sexton is improving quickly.  Not saying RJ has no chance, but good chance is a little optimistic imo  Though the Knicks do have a ton of fans so it‚Äôs possible he gets voted in"
It‚Äôs the dunk last year where Lebron got like 2 inches off the ground and Jaylen Brown had an easy poster.
Booker is 47TS% in the 4th. Bradley beal is 45 TS%. Jamal Murray is 44 TS%. Donovan Mitchell is 52 TS%. Kawhi is 49TS%. AD is 51%. Lebron is 53TS%.  Jaylen Brown is 48TS%.   I will tell them their stats don't matter if they aren't efficient in the 4th lol.
"Maybe I'd agree that Jaylen Brown is a lock, but the other three sure as hell are NOT locks right now. I think LaVine is more deserving than all three ATM."
My team-  QB Jokic  RB Russ  WR LeBron  WR Giannis  Slot KD  TE Zion  RT Anthony Davis  RG DeMarcus Cousins  C Steven Adams  LG DeAndre Jordan  LT Gobert  DE Kawhi  DE Nurkic  DT Embiid  DT Dwight   LB Draymond  LB Butler  LB Jaylen Brown  CB Wall  CB Jrue  FS Lowry  SS Smart
I'd say Jaylen Brown would be the front runner.
"His shot will come around. He‚Äôs probably always going to look overpaid given the numbers he‚Äôs going to put up as the 3rd option, but he‚Äôs still exactly what the Celtics need for a PG next to Tatum/Brown.   They could‚Äôve gotten the same type of player for less money, yes, but hindsight is 20/20. Tatum and Jaylen both have ascended to All-NBA caliber players in only 18 months since signing Kemba - even the most optimistic fans of the Jays didn‚Äôt see this coming this fast. They signed Kemba to score 25 points a night and now they just don‚Äôt need that, but that‚Äôs a good problem to have."
"Best coach is subjective, but I genuinely believe that he is a coach that maximizes his roster and gets players to develop. Jaylen Brown went from a guy who couldn‚Äôt shoot foul shots to a guy who is a knock down 3 point shooter. Marcus Smart went from a walking punchline to a solid defender and passer. Jayson Tatum has steadily improved. I mean, hell, Isaiah Thomas turned into an MVP candidate under him."
Jaylen Brown is significantly better at basketball than Kemba Walker. There‚Äôs not a whole lot to it
has jaylen brown been considered?
"Same can be said about Jaylen ""Michael Jordan"" Brown and Jayson ""Kobe Bryant"" Tatum"
"There‚Äôs two forms of empty stats players.  You have guys like Vucevic and D‚ÄôLo who score 20 points, but on below average efficiency.  Then you have guys like Lavine and Beal. Their offense is good, but look at the effort being given on defense. If you don‚Äôt expend any energy on the defensive end, it‚Äôs easier to produce on the offensive end compared to someone like Jimmy Butler or Jaylen Brown who expend a lot of energy on defense."
But have you considered Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum?
Jaylen brown should be a all-star starter instead of harden
Bro that wasn‚Äôt even Jaylen Brown...
"Jaylen Brown, Tatum, AD, and Lebron should dump these guys and form their own team. Dennis can come too."
"I don't think he can make it with the amount of games he's missed.       These players should all make it before him for the final team:  |East|Pos|Team| :--|:--|:--| |Kyrie Irving|G|BRK|.   |Bradley Beal|G|WAS| |Kevin Durant|F|BRK| |Joel Embiid|F|PHI| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|F|MIL| |Trae Young|G|ATL| |James Harden|G|BRK| |Jayson Tatum|F|BOS| |Khris Middleton|F|MIL| |Domantans Sabonis|F|IND| |Zach LaVine|WC|CHI| |Jaylen Brown|WC|BOS|.        That's not even including other contenders like Bam, Vic, Randle, Hayward, Tobi, Brogdon and Sexton."
Jaylen Brown missed two free throws that were gifted to him by the refs at the end.
"Yes because defensive Specialist ""Kyle Kuzma"", a DPOY candidate can guard Jason Tatum and Brown of Jaylen better than Montrezl.   Let me remind you this:  Jayson Tatum dropped 41 pts on Kuzma's head on insane efficiency.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRzq7rz4QQo  Do you honestly believe Kuzma or the Morris dude can do better than Montrezl Harrell? You need to think hard about this before answering me. If your answer is yes then we won't argue anymore. I can't change your mind/opinion. it is what it is."
Jaylen Brown better be selected as an all star or I swear I‚Äôll sell my shares of Dogecoin.
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum
I don‚Äôt want to see Boston in Playoffs again. Jaylen Brown last year scared me and this version of him is more terrifying
Jaylen Brown is so trash ball don‚Äôt lie babg
"""Jaylen Brown wanted to take the foul""  Based on what exactly?"
I don‚Äôt understand how Jaylen Brown intentionally elbowing AD in the nuts isn‚Äôt even a Flagrant 1.
Lmao Jaylen brown isn‚Äôt trying to destroy ADs balls on purpose. Relax
Jaylen Brown has entered the chat
"Marcus Smart catches fire from 3 all the time, he‚Äôs a streaky shooter. Blame nick nurse for leaving Jaylen Brown and Smart open in the corner to stop Tatum and Kemba.   The best regular season team of all time blew a 3-1 lead, I guess they aren‚Äôt good anymore! LOL"
Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown
"Jaylen Brown, so I could foul FVV at the end of game 7 shooting a 3 to send him to the line to tie or win the game"
"Oh yeah last year was something special. Maybe it's just the lineups that were playing and I'd assume that there was more pressure last year due to the score being closer, but man watching Dame and Steph (and Jaylen Brown) just absolutely score multiple 3s in a row made this a relatively short affair."
What‚Äôs wrong with Jaylen Brown? I enjoyed watching him play double half the minutes.
"Plus 25 points great defense Paul George, almost a starter jaylen brown, DPOY gobert, and versatile big man sabonis. It also helps that team Durant lost embiid, booker, and Durant which was replaced by Conley, while team lebron lost just Ben Simmons"
He opted out for rest (which i dont understand as he was playing in the game and the 3pt contest is not very taxing at all) and hes been in it before but it woudlve been fun to see him in there instead of Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown
"To be fair i dont think any of players gave a shit about the game except maybe jaylen brown a bit, dame definitely saw steph draining some and decided to ham. And cp always tryna win"
jaylen brown had the toughest shot with that turnaround stepback in the corner
I exclusively like women.  I would 100% have sex with Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown could get into modeling and kill It if he never plays another min of basketball. This man won the genetic lottery.
Jaylen Brown yes sir
"""Jaylen Brown adds to the lead as Paul George knocks it down."""

EVERY POSSESSION THAT DOES NOT END WITH A JAYLEN BROWN SHOT IS A WASTED POSSESSION
Half of the choir looks related to Jaylen Brown.
"And they faced their consequences. Nunn was let go by his school and the victim agreed to their settlement. Seems like you want to see black men be punished. Don't even believe in rehabilitation, that everyone should be punished. Typical celtics fan, supporting the status quo and a system the leads to more black people being trapped in a cycle instead of being able to make the most of their situation. You'd rather them be out of the league and be unable to use their talents instead of seeing them be successful. Someone clearly doesn't listen to what Jaylen Brown says."
JAYLEN BROWN IS HOT
Never was a Jaylen brown fan but whatever

Jaylen Brown is incapable of missing just FYI guys
As a Jaylen Brown truther/Stan this post hurts me. Mostly because you did a great job outlining and arguing your point. I def don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a net negative but those clips you‚Äôve linked are just... dreadful to watch
"&gt;""Trae Young is the 19th most popular player in the league"" is hardly a flex.  I would say being top 20 without being on a playoff team counts as pretty popular.   &gt;Also, last year, he had 2.8m votes on a team that was outside the playoffs.   Yeah, that's hard to do. Last year was his breakout and his team was complete garbage, this year he had a better supporting cast and was held more accountable for their underperformance.   &gt;His popularity is declining as a result of all the controversy with his playstyle.  This is a fun narrative, but I don't think it's actually true from a fan perspective.   He plays on a mid-market team that's performing poorly, and his stats aren't better than last year. His conference also got more competition at the Guard spot, with Kyrie being healthy, Brad Beal leading the league in scoring(and having snub sympathy from last year), Zach Lavine and Jaylen Brown breaking out, and James Harden joining the conference.   If you somehow put Trae Young's perception from last year in a time capsule, and open it up this year, he still gets way less votes.  If the Hawks were where the Knicks are Trae makes the All-Star team pretty easily."
"Considering his team was solidly out of playoff position at the time of the vote, and there were breakout players like Jaylen Brown and Zach Lavine, I think that qualifies as popular.   It's really hard to make the All-Star team from a bottom team, especially as a backcourt player. Brad Beal had to get snubbed last year and lead the league in scoring this year to do it."
I agree with you. I think we're at the irrational confidence stage with Jaylen Brown. He's a favorite of r/nba and Celtic fans alike. Just give it a couple of years for reality to set in.
"That‚Äôs kinda how I feel about Jaylen Brown this season too. In general, I feel like the jump from a 20ppg player to a 25ppg player is harder than the jump from 10ppg to 20ppg. But the second group tends to win more MIP awards.  Oh well, at the end of the day all of these guys would be deserving in some capacity. Makes me wonder what an ‚ÄúAll-Improvement‚Äù team would look like at the end of the season though lmao"
Good write up. I read all the awards and liked the analysis with the exception of the sophomore leap one. It's not because I disagree (I have rarely watched him play) but because it doesn't use any numbers to show your reasoning. All the other awards made great use of stats to justify your opinion but the one that is supposed to be a year to year improvement included no comparison of any kind for each season. It sounds like just an eye test and comparison (not through stats) to Jaylen Brown. Would be nice to see a % of the kind of shots he took this season vs last or something else verifiable. I hope this is helpful and appreciate the good original content.
1. Even though its true it's so weird to call kyrie a sg 2. Correct me if I'm wrong but isnt Jaylen brown a sf? Edit yep Jaylen is a sg
"Not even a little bit. If anything he was the most impressive player in that play.   * He covered his own man * He switched onto Marcus' man (who was eventually going to become Theis' man) * Theis and Tatum have a miscommunication on the switch which leaves both of them on the perimeter guarding the same guy, leaving the man in the paint wide open (2PT game), Jaylen is stuck guarding him for longer than anticipated  * As the pass is made, Brown then closes out on OG and gets within an inch or 2 of making the block  If Jaylen gets the block (very close to happening) or OG misses the shot (&gt;50% chance) or Lowry's pass is slightly off, giving Jaylen more time to closeout (&gt;50% chance) then Jaylen's defensive performance would have been celebrated as being Draymond-like."
"Yep, which is why I think it's ridiculous that people say Jaylen Brown is a better defender than Tatum."
Exactly  It‚Äôs Jaylen Brown btw
"Jaylen Brown is definitely my favorite player currently in the NBA, but having watched nearly every Celtics game this year I got to say his off-ball defense definitely does need some work. For every possession where he makes a great on-ball defensive play there also seems to be another possession where he'll overhelp or make a mistake. The Celtics aren't a great defensive team this year, I'm just hoping this all-star break gives Brad some times to focus on what's been going wrong on that end and help fix some of our player's bad habits."
A net negative simply means you give up more points to the other team than you are responsible for creating for your team  I highly doubt Jaylen Brown alone is responsible for allowing 25 points a night
"everybody's telling me, i hear it all the time. people stop me on the street and they say to me, they say ""mr president, you wouldn't believe the kind of off-ball defense jaylen brown is playing! it's true!"""
"Using a one game sample size to prove a point is one of the dumbest things people on the internet do lol. Jaylen Brown simply isn‚Äôt a very good defender anymore, nor an elite 1 v 1 defender because he has to shoulder more offensive load. This happens to every wing player that breaks our offensively. Idk why you guys are so salty about this."
jaylen brown cost us the finals? did you really say that &amp; mean it?
OK fine... I‚Äôll offer Jared Dudley for Jaylen Brown just to take him off your hands. Ainge got himself the heist of the decade there
"See there‚Äôs the problem. OG May be a better on ball defender than offball defender, but he‚Äôs still an excellent off-ball defender. You need to cite guys like Jaylen Brown who play exclusively on ball defense for these comparisons"
"it‚Äôs not really ‚Äúfake‚Äù, it‚Äôs just not black and white   like this post suggests, his off ball defense is definitely his biggest weakness, but his on ball defense when he turns it on, is elite.  a motivated locked down jaylen brown in a 1v1 defensive matchup is not what you want to see as the opposing player believe me, problem is that team defense is more valuable these days"
"Not even really, check out the Jaylen Brown post a few minutes ago. Teams like the Jazz and Heat will endlessly hound you if you have bad offball defense"
"Great player but yeah ive been saying this for multiple years his defense is all fake.   He has this reputation as a ""two way player"" because he looks the part of a good physical wing and people assume because he's really smart in real life he must be this cerebral heady defender. But he's completely lost off ball and in help defense. Spo and Nick Nurse went at this in the playoffs last year Brad Stevens is very good at his job but I still have no idea where the hell he got this idea that he thought he should be putting Jaylen Brown on Duncan Robinson those first two games of that series.  His man to man defense is good but on totality this year he's been closer to a negative than a positive defensively because the help defense and off ball stuff matters more."
"How did Kawhi‚Äôs season in Toronto go? I can‚Äôt remember  How is that relevant?  Davis and Jaylen brown could absolutely win something, especially with Hayward and smart  I thought the Celtics had a bunch of great young players, now they‚Äôre scrubs?? Make up your mind"
"So we should have traded Jaylen Brown, a 24 year old all-star under contract for 4 more years, for one year of Kawhi Butler and 2 years of Harden. And Tatum for one year of Davis. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôd be in a better position now lol. Do you guys think before making these comments?"
"&gt;Kawhi  Walked after one season in Toronto.   &gt;Butler  Has been on 3 teams since we were linked to him  &gt;Davis  A team of Jaylen Brown and Anthony Davis isn‚Äôt winning anything, and Davis was very open about not wanting to play for Boston. We‚Äôd have only Jaylen Brown now after Davis inevitably went to LA.  &gt;Harden  Again, is a team of Harden-Kemba-Tatum with a bunch of scrubs enough to beat LA or Brooklyn?"
Yeah like those bums Jaylen Brown and Tatum we were really overvaluing them huh
"I love Jaylen Brown, but him over Trae is a pretty bad look imo"
"You can‚Äôt stop them, but the Celtics have a bunch of guys who can score the ball too. I obviously don‚Äôt favour the Celtics in this series but I think they‚Äôd do better than a lot of other teams. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are elite defenders and Boston is a great defensive team overall."
"embiid last playoffs was on a 7 seed team. This playoffs, top of the east.  He‚Äôs also nowhere near MVP last season. He‚Äôs MVP this season.  That‚Äôs like asking why rookie Jaylen Brown is trash compared to all-star Jaylen Brown this season. It‚Äôs not even the same player no more."
"If the Blazers could build a 2011 Mavs style team around Dame it could be possible.  If you surrounded Dame with Jaylen Brown (or Jrue Holiday), Mikal Bridges, Bojan Bogdanovic and Bam Adebayo with Ingles, Norman Powell, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder and Ivica Zubac that'd be a true championship contending roster.  That squad has the size, defense &amp; versatility to cover up for Dame on defense, a playmaking big to help beat the trap on a PnR, enough secondary scoring to make teams pay for loading up on Dame and enough shooting to keep the lane open for him.   It's much harder to build a team around a small guard but not impossible."
"Interesting that you bring up 2011 because I saw a good comparison of Dirk and Carmelo Anthony one time. That Melo at his peak was arguably a top 7 player or so, and the question was could he be the best player on a championship team? And they said similar to Dirk in 2011, he doesn‚Äôt just fit ANY team, but if a team were expertly crafted around Carmelo Anthony, The author said he could be  I think a similar fact about Damian Lillard is true. This current iteration of the blazers isn‚Äôt a title contender, but that isn‚Äôt his fault. He‚Äôs dealt with injuries the last two years to his team, and they‚Äôre still on a 48 win pace over an 82 game season.  If he had an elite defensive center and shooting, basically replace Mitchell on the Jazz with him, then that‚Äôs a title contender. Or if he had a great wing to run with who also was a good passer, someone like Jaylen Brown, then yeah.   I think he definitely could be the best player on a finals team. It‚Äôs just so hard to build that team."
"&gt; But it happened also because there wasn't any good defender in guard position and back to 2000's they were more strict about positions  Yes. This has really changed the past 5 years also. [If you look at the seasons where defenders spent the most time guarding the most positions and showing the most versatility since 2014 its all within the past 3 yrs](https://apanalytics.shinyapps.io/knarsu3/). Ex Kyle Lowry  2014: 64% of his time guarding 1s, 21% guarding 2s, 9% guarding 3s, 4% guarding 4s, 2% guarding 5s  2020: 18% guarding 1s, 34% guarding 2s, 22% guarding 3s, 17% guarding 4s, 8% guarding 5s.   He was guarding Tatum and Jaylen Brown in the playoffs last year, even with these stocky bulky guards this just would never happen 15 years ago.   &gt;Right now he's still a great defender but not remotely as good as he was  Yeah definitely not what he was 5 yrs ago, do think he's definitely better right now defensively than post 2002 Kobe. He earned an All NBA defense spot last yr, I think he's a deserving candidate this year.   Really people think it's more ""virtuous"" or ""superior"" if Kobe was some elite 2 way player his whole career. It's all just signaling really to act like he still played top defense it wasnt actually that important if he did or didnt at his spot it just makes people feel better to claim he did."
Jamal Murray maybe? Jaylen Brown? Donovan Mitchell? Devin Booker is probably the one
Really don't understand how Aaron Gordon and Lonzo Ball are in the same category as Jaylen Brown and Brandon Ingram.    Gordon has been in the league for 7 years and hasn't sniffed an ASG. Lonzo will never get there. BI and Brown (and KP for that matter) are already All Stars.
"I'm just hoping he develops like Jaylen Brown, good defense and a spot up shooter but turns into a great off the dribbe guy"
They actually don't have similar playstyles. Jaylen Brown plays nothing like Donovan Mitchell or Zach Lavine. So on top of not being a SG.. he doesn't belong here lol
"Lavine &gt; Mitchell &gt; Brown  I don't think Mitchell is that much better than Lavine defensively, and honestly Jaylen hasn't impressed me at all on that end this season so I'd take them in order of how good they are offensively"
And they're all wrong because Jaylen Brown isn't a shooting guard lol. The fuck do people think Smart is? A 6'3 SF? Cmon now lol
"But Tatum had half the shot attempts and didn‚Äôt really have a chance to get in rhythm. He had fifty five attempts the whole series and kyrie had 104 on a lower ts. Horford had the second most attempts with 63 total. Jaylen brown had 16 ppg on a ts% of 60.2 as opposed to Kyrie‚Äôs 20 ppg on 44.7 but Jaylen only got 58 attempts. Tatum was passing but Kyrie wasn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs the difference."
Lavine  Mitchell  brown.  Mitchell‚Äôs shot creation is so clutch in the playoffs. But I‚Äôd rather have Jaylen as a secondary star over the other two.
Everyone was playing extremely selfishly. Hayward was returning from injury and was straight up bad. The development  of Tatum and Brown suffered because of how many shot chuckers were on the team.   Rozier and Morris were playing for a contract. Rozier straight up wanted to start over Kyrie. Guys weren‚Äôt happy with Hayward starting games right off the bat after missing a whole year. Jaylen wasn‚Äôt happy coming off the bench after leading the team in scoring in a ECF run the previous year.    The fact we even got to the 2nd round was incredible. That was one of the most dysfunctional teams I‚Äôve ever seen
"I mean, when you come into the league as good as Doncic already was, then yeah, he already was WAYYYY closer to his peak than your average 19 year old.  It's not a slam on Doncic at all, it's just there's only so much room to grow from 29/9/9 at 20 years old.  It's not like he can possibly go on a Jaylen Brown type improvement trajectory or he'd be putting up 60/20/20 lines.  He'll obviously polish his game and grow veteran savvy, but much like Lebron or Durant, by year 2 or 3 these types of stars are already close to what they're going to be."
"Donovan's efficiency this season is average for guards. Not good, not bad. Right in the middle. Certainly not elite. Numbers wise, he's slightly more efficient than Jayson Tatum and slightly less efficient than Jaylen Brown."
That does him no favors but he seems to lack high end athleticism. For example there was a loose ball late in that 4th where jaylen brown just absolutely torched him speed wise and got it.  Now brown is a high end athlete of course but I don‚Äôt think Barrett has the explosiveness of the top scorers in the game. He needs to work on his ball handling and try to model his game around harden and luka using physicality and stop and start
"Fine, call him a 2.   Jrue. FVV. Jaylen. Jimmy. Danny Green. Whichever guy the Pacers are starting at the 2--is it Holiday now? Josh Richardson. Will Barton. Rozier. Derrick White. Lonzo. That's 13.   Sterling Brown, if you count him as the Rockets 2. I could probably argue Wiggins and Josh Jackson, too.   Depending on which guy you consider a team's 2, the list changes. If you want to go just ""wings"" in general, it's even harder for me to consider him in that top-24 (because so many of the worst defenders in the league are starting 2s)"

"Nah, [I like when they combine](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/19/jaylen-brown-coronavirus-covid-19-nba-basketball-boston-celtics)"
"Just from that list of top 100 FTA/FGA, he's above Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Draymond Green, etc."
"I feel like it's partly on the player though.   Part of your job as a star is to force your way into those possessions.  You hear Shaq talk about it a lot. He used to bully his way into the paint and force his teammates to either pass or take the 3-second violation.  We have a similar issue. Much like the Luka/Porzingis dynamic, we have issues of being so Tatum-focused down the stretch that Brown sometimes gets ignored. Sometimes he just accepts it and sits in the 'Jaylen corner', sometimes (like tonight against the Knicks) he steps up and makes his presence felt.  He moved off-ball. He got some stops and rebounds. He pushed hard in transition.   Once you force your way into the possessions, guys start looking for you."
For whatever it‚Äôs worth Jaylen Brown tweeted out that it was cap and Kemba even tweeted that it was BS. Kemba hadn‚Äôt tweeted in months before that.
I‚Äôm going to say it... Jaylen Brown is actually the Celtics most valuable player
"I dont think its fair to call a 20 year old a not really star. We dont know how good rj can be. His most common comparisons are Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown, Demar Derozan. Look at those guys at 20 years old. Of course situations are different but I think RJs production at 20 years old is way to much for him to be writen off over near 25 year olds who haven't even been close to making an allstar game. 18-22 is perfectly fine for RJ and might even be a little too high"
The team has NO POINT GUARD or player from another position to play point guard. In modern NBA you need a player to play point. Jaylen Brown is overrated and Kemba is done as far as a NBA starter is concerned.
If Jaylen brown could take one more small leap and get to bookers level I‚Äôd be ecstatic. Booker has great footwork and shot selection
"trae young is on the list and Lonzo ball isnt ranked over either of those guys. If you mean Lamelo, id probably disagree with you on that Lamelo&gt;Jaylen Brown if we are going off of potential"
same could be said for Jaylen Brown tonight :(
Gonna give my best guesses here not in any particular order....  Zion  Luka  Tatum  Ja Morant   SGA (Shai Gilgeous-Alexander)  Jaylen Brown   Ben Simmons  Donovan Mitchell  Devin Booker  Brandon Ingram
Jaylen. Brown.
trying to iso on smart and then on Jaylen Brown isn't really good offense with 1 minute to go
Celtics fans complain about not getting to the line.  r/nba: dRiVe ThE lAnE  Jaylen and Jayson get face smashed every game and nothing. Brown was T'd up for waiving at the ref the last elbow he took off the nose.
"I also agree.  I'm going to exclude rookies because we haven't seen enough of them.  My top 10 based on potential as a championship guys are:  1) Luka clearly can be 1st option has historic offensive load  2) Zion if his jumper, passing and defence improve he can conceivably be the Goat.  3) Tatum - Clearly ultratalented only 22. He's struggling this season but once his playmaking improves clear top 10 potential for me with top 5 as his ceiling aka ring as 1st option.  4) SGA absolute beast. Super efficient scorer good defender. We're concerns about his playmaking and he's put them to bed. His team is trash but he was making games close. I think will be top 10 player.  5) Mitchell - is there really anything to say here?  6) Booker - Same with Mitchell.  7) Simmons - DPOY calibre guy. Think he'd be much better as the secondary ball handler with him playing in the short roll and cutting.  8) Bam - 63% TS 20/10 guy. All-defence. Dude is going to be all-nba calibre either next season or the following year. He is already better than KAT.  9) Fox - Been great lately. I think his passing is greta and shooting has improved. His defence is also very good. Why is he above trae because he doesn't need to dominate the ball to be good whereas trae does. And he needs foul baiting which gets shut down in the playoffs.  10) Jaylen Brown - same as tatum except he took a big leap this year. I expect he will continue to improve."
"For the top tier, maybe Kerr? Kerr took a 51-31 1st round exit team, and the next year with the exact same team (and 18 minutes per game of Livingston) implemented his offense and went 67-15, doubled the team‚Äôs SRS, and cruised to a title.   That is one of the best coaching jobs in sports history. Going from mediocre coach to great coach was all it took for GS to go from good team to all-time great team.   When a coach makes that big of a difference it‚Äôs clear that he‚Äôs a top coach in the league. He‚Äôs not maybe a borderline tier one coach, he‚Äôs solidly in tier one.  I‚Äôd say that you can only for sure put Pop ahead of him. Kerr is for sure above Snyder, and that‚Äôs no knock on Quinn Snyder he‚Äôs a great coach, just talk to me when Snyder goes to 5 straight finals.   Carlisle is great, I‚Äôd put Kerr slightly above him, but I won‚Äôt argue if you have Carlisle above Kerr, it‚Äôs splitting hairs. Kerr has a better resume, but Carlisle has coached so many different styles of teams and always figures it out, so that‚Äôs a wash. Same argument goes for Spo. I personally think Kerr is a bit better, but if you wanna take Spo, it‚Äôs not egregious.  Kerr &gt; Nurse, pretty easily too. Nurse is also great, and I fucking wish the Bucks went for him instead of Bud, but Kerr has 3 titles in 6 years and Nurse doesn‚Äôt have the lengthy resume of Carlisle or Spo to help his case.  I‚Äôd take Brad Stevens over Nurse to be honest. Nurse is great, and like I said I wish the Bucks had him, but Kawhi carried Toronto to that title. If Ainge would‚Äôve been willing to trade Jaylen Brown for that Kawhi rental, I‚Äôm sure Boston would‚Äôve been in the same spot as Toronto.  So going off of your criteria, the top coaches in order for me are  1. Pop  2. Carlisle/Kerr  3. Kerr/Carlisle  4. Spoelstra  5. Stevens  6. Nurse  Those are the coaches to me that having them instead of a mediocre coach can potentially lead you to a title. Snyder is in the next tier for me, at the top of the tier, but still below the top 6. Snyder is in the Snyder/Thibs/Bud tier of coaches that can lead great regular season teams, but not coaches that‚Äôll take you to the promised land of Titleville."
"Wiseman, the Minny pick back (even if it‚Äôs their 2022, if KAT is leaving that pick is gold), and a bunch of draft compensation is way better for a rebuilding team than a Jaylen Brown they have to pay."
Jaylen brown &gt; jayson Tatum In the long run
Why would the wolves want jaylen brown? He'd be a season away from requesting a trade.  Its gotta be picks and guys on rookie contracts.  I.e. the warriors
Because Jaylen Brown will lead the Bucks to a championship üíØ
"Their identity on offense is 4  perimeter players (Tatum, Brown, Smart and Kemba) who take a bunch of really difficult, bad shots. Particularly Tatum- he makes some insanely difficult shots, especially that step back move he has, but every time I watch him I feel like the majority of his shots are just bad shots. Tough to win when you don't at least have a big who can rebound all of those bad shots too. They also don't attack the rim much, and as a result don't get to the line a lot.  On defense, they have no good interior defenders, and Brown &amp; Tatum just seem really lazy most of the time on rotations and help D. Jaylen can lock in sometimes when he's guarding on ball, but not always. Smart is the only dude who seems to take a lot of pride in his defense this season.  If I were a celtics fan I'd be most worried that obvious shit like this isn't getting corrected, even though I'm sure Stevens is harping on it. Seems like the stars have tuned him out or something."
Jaylen Brown hate account
"he's a great defender. has had some struggles this year but through his career has proven to be above average. i don't know what he means by ""i expect this from jaylen brown"". makes zero sense. JT is great too and is getting better."
Is jaylen brown not a good defender?
"Booker is better, but not cause he was name dropped  Gucci is a big Jaylen Brown fan, that doesn't make JB any better"
Nah Tatum is definitely a good defender. He just had a bad game last night. He hasn‚Äôt been as good defensively this year as last but he‚Äôs still been a solid plus defender   Jaylen brown on the other hand unfortunately I cannot say the same for
"Doesn't make for a good segment on a talk show but they just haven't had enough good players healthy.  If you look at their totals half of their minutes are being played by dudes that I'm not sure belong in a rotation, forgetting about how crappy Smart and Kemba looked as they were first returning from injury.  For example Ojeyele, Grant Williams and Tremont Waters have played more minutes than Tatum.  TT and Pritchard have played more minutes than Jaylen Brown. Jeff Teague and Aaron Nesmith have played more than Kemba.    Looking at teams who are gonna hit the over on their win totals the Jazz have 10 players who have played 100 minutes, the Knicks have 12, the Hornets have 11 and the Celtics have 17.  Tough to establish an identity with bad players and no continuity."
"I know it's been mentioned here but it's very hard to find an identity as a team when you have key pieces hurt every game.  \-Kemba missed the first 11 games. Right when he comes back, Tatum gets COVID.  \-Tatum gets back (and is 70% of his former self), and Smart goes down for 18 games.  \-Kemba still hasn't played a back to back since returning and it's noticeable how bad our team is without him.  \-We trade for Fournier and right when he's hitting his stride and added much needed scoring off the bench, he gets COVID.  \-Jaylen has been struggling with knee issues all year.  \-Romeo just came back and is proving to be a great depth piece.  I'm not saying we're the only team going through injuries but ours seem to be in the perfect timing where we are always missing 1-2 key players so it leads to Tatum and Brown having to resort to ISO ball because no one on the court would get minutes if people were healthy."
What happened to Jaylen Brown? Isn‚Äôt he a good slasher anymore?
This dude is the biggest Jaylen Brown hater in the nba. He called him the worst starter the league the other day--imagine.
Hey guys!!!! I found the Celtics troll that doesn‚Äôt know that Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown carried to the ECF last year.
"The problem is that Jaylen Brown is among the worst defenders in the NBA right now. Green teamers rag on Kemba because he's small but he has actually been better than Brown on defense since he is generally in position to contest a lot of shots, just without a lot of success because he's small. Brown is not only losing a ton of players on off-ball cuts but also letting 90% of the ball-handlers drive past him. It is to the point where a traffic cone could do a better job defending than Brown can.  Then you add in the fact that Brown cannot create shots for his teammates and he is inefficient as a shot-creator himself, he's probably the biggest problem on the Celtics right now."
Defensively [I expect this from Jaylen brown but when your two best help defenders smart and Tatum are doing shit like this it‚Äôs a wrap](https://twitter.com/jaredweissnba/status/1379773411879231489?s=21). Just slept walked through the entire game last night
"Maybe not most, but Jaylen Brown is definitely up there."
Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown should guard 2's and 3's but Celtics don't have actual PF that can defend so they move him to 3's and 4's. That caused Sixers hunted him in the post every play
Ah yes the los angeles lakers. famous for not being able to attract free agents to pair with a 25m salary jaylen brown
You mean All Star Jaylen Brown??
/r/bostonceltics legitimately believes Tatum is a top 10 player in the NBA and that the Celtics are making the Finals and that Jaylen Brown was being disrespected by not being put ahead of Bam and Fox and Booker on the ESPN best players under 25 list. Collective IQ of that sub is like -20.
"Swap LeBron and Jaylen Brown, which team is better?"
imagine making this post with jayson tatum and jaylen brown on your team lmao
embiid wanted a turn abusing Jaylen Brown
Ben Simmons is a +17 rn  Jaylen Brown is a -17  You‚Äôre getting beat down by the 76ers right now have some shame.
"Damn the sixers don't think Jaylen Brown is a good post defender, they're going at him every time"
whoever offense on Jaylen Brown he can‚Äôt guard anybody LMAO
"i respect jaylen brown so much for not demanding a trade at this point. dude gets completely neglected on offense even when he‚Äôs having a great game, always just put on the corner. smart should never have more shots than him and neither should kemba really."
"Jaylen Brown did not make a jump in defense, if anything his defense has regressed this season."
If he does it again maybe he‚Äôll be better than Jaylen Brown
&gt;The slight advantage Simmons has in defense  It's not slight at all.  I'd argue Simmons defense is far more impactful than Browns offense as Simmons is also a much better passer. Only thing brown does is score.  For such a high IQ player Jaylen is an awful off ball defender
Jaylen Brown.
"Anybody who says Ben Simmons is better than Jaylen Brown is wrong  ‚ÄúB...B....But his defense!!!‚Äù Yes Ben Simmons is a great defender, but so is Brown. The slight advantage Simmons has in defense is outweighed by the fact that he doesn‚Äôt bring much value to halfcourt offense"
"Well obviously, you can read right? The difference is I have numbers to my support my argument where as you don't.   Also It's better to have a higher number for an offensive rating and a lower number for a defensive rating, so Fox doesn't have a better offensive rating than Booker who beats him quite convincedly in both categories. How are you going to call it a ""noisy metric"" when you don't even understand how it works?  According to defensive ratings, Marcus Smart and Kyle Lowry are having the worst defensive seasons of their entire careers. Smarts defense has been criticised this season (he's missed 17 games through injury and probably isn't 100%) and Lowry is 35 years old so not an absolute shock to be honest. Jaylen Brown is a very overrated defender. Refer to this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mcn8yw/is_jaylen_brown_an_overrated_defender/). Their are even Celtics fans who are saying his defense has been bad this season. Do your research."
I mean just because a guy was a high pick doesn‚Äôt mean he didn‚Äôt develop. Jaylen Brown as an example was a pretty widely panned pick and he definitely wasn‚Äôt ready to step into a significant role without years of development. Coming across better to scouts in college doesn‚Äôt even necessarily mean a guy has less need for good player development ‚Äî we see late picks thrive right away all the time and high picks struggle and bust too.
"If Kyrie is tier 1 Tatum is also. Jaylen Brown should be tier 2, Zion also."
Why would KAT demand a trade from the dubs? Playing with Steph Curry amd Draymond for a chance at a title?  And how many young players are available? I cant really think of many better than eiseman off the top of my head who might be out there. Maybe guys like Jaylen Brown and Ben Simmons but they would have shitty picks attached and are both not really on the minny timeline if they trade KAT. They need a lamelo or a trae young or someone 21 and under to pair with Edwards and those picks
Jayson Tatum is 23 right now.  Jaylen Brown is 24.  Zion is 20.    so everyone's clocks are all fucked up by these guys.
Been a tough season for the Celtics. Brown of Jaylen is still there?
I agree he played bad but we don't know anything what really happened in there. It's obvious that there is a problem that's why he left but it's not only kyrie who left almost anyone and only the Jay's and Smart are still there.   I just think that Boston team has too many players who wants to have a better role. That's why Ainge should've trade some that yrs deadline. Jaylen brown is being bench and is on a reduce role certainly doesn't help.   So you can't really conclude anything in it and says he's a bad 1st option when we have a big sample size that he is a good 1st option.
Jaylen Brown for Luka. Who says no?
Ok but why isn‚Äôt Jaylen Brown getting some MVP respect?
I remember when Tyler Herro was better then Jaylen Brown
"Why does this sub struggle to understand the Celtics drastically and unexpectedly overachieved the last few years because Tatum/Brown developed so much faster than expected?  This year's team may not be it - but those two guys are still getting better every year and the post-Kemba era is what the Celtics organization was always really angling for.  You're going to have prime Tatum, prime Jaylen, and prime Jokic/KAT/somebody for a good 4-5 year run.  Everything before then has always been gravy."
Jaylen Brown easy
"As a nuggets fan, its jaylen brown. For non nuggets fan, its jaylen brown also"
His handles and strength are subpar. If the defender got into his body he would likely settle for a mid-range. He aint that Jimmy Butler or even Jaylen Brown type of strong slasher.
This question is disrespectful to jaylen brown
"It gotta be Jaylen Brown, he's younger, more athletic, a better shooter/scorer and is on the rise while Siakam has taken a dip this year."
Easily jaylen brown
You‚Äôre absolutely right. I think Jaylen Brown applies to that as well so I‚Äôm twice as behind on my ‚Äúrules for unreasonable fanbases‚Äù.
Jaylen Brown
Yaa but brown isn‚Äôt the guy every team is trying to stop night in and night out.. Siakam is doubled and tripled team consistently. Anyway jaylen has more upside but growth isn‚Äôt linear. At the end of the day both players are better suited as a second third option. Siakam has already proven to be great at that with the chip in 2019. We just gotta see jaylen do that too.
"You‚Äôre right about Jaylen being a number 1 option, he‚Äôd probably struggle although with seen flashes of him becoming an elite scorer (e.g Philly) and good playmaking (throughout this season he‚Äôs improved dramatically). Let‚Äôs not forget that Siakam has plays with Lowry, FVV, OG and Norm/Trent Jr. Jaylen has played with JT, and regressing Kemba and a cold Marcus Smart.  Also, we‚Äôre talking about drafting players. Considering upside is huge factor in drafting there‚Äôs no way you don‚Äôt take a 24 year old JB doing what‚Äôs he‚Äôs doing over Siakam rn. I know development isn‚Äôt linear but I‚Äôm taking Brown every time."
A bouncer at a bar in Faneuil Hall suggested the Celtics should trade Jaylen Brown for JR Smith during the 2018 NBA Finals
Ingram  Simmons  Murray  Savings Brown   Look - I love Jaylen - really. All good  But if he wasn‚Äôt one of the ‚ÄòJ‚Äôs‚Äô and not playing for the Celtics he‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt receive nearly as much pub  Murray is tough as nails - clutch - can go one on one sans pick - and a deadly free throw shooter
wiggins has been in the league for a while now you think he wouldn‚Äôt do it if he could? and it‚Äôs not just a matter of ‚Äúkiller mentality‚Äù otherwise a lot of dudes in the league could do what jaylen brown does
"His handle isn‚Äôt good. That‚Äôs legit what he‚Äôs missing. Look at DeRozan, Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Kawhi etc when they developed their handle, it makes all the difference in the world."
Jaylen Brown is the best recent example
Why would he somehow develop a handle with more college experience? Some dudes just don't got it. It's very rare for guys to develop a handle. You either got it or you don't. Guys like Jaylen Brown are far and few between.
"I mean listen to any of the now-retired players. LeBron in his first few seasons traveled and double-dribbled all the time. You got guys like KCP, Zach LaVine, Rondae, hell Jaylen Brown had zero handles. So many guys in the last 10 years entered the league without at least passable dribbling or handles. Yeah you learn it over time or teams mask it but it was hilariously obvious in about 2014-2016 period where all the older players kept getting young players to foul, travel and turn it over without them realizing what had happened.   I remember one of the older refs, Joey or Dick Bavetta, talking about having to teach a player what double-dribble even was in the middle of a game, because he thought a pump fake was illegal"
Sometimes it feels we consider Jaylen Brown so much we forget to consider Jayson Tatum
"Not really. Ingram does a lot more of his damage as a creator from the 2/3 where KD is now at a point where he gets a lot of his off-ball and as a 4. But no way you trade Zion for curry/KD. Too much of a future with Zion right now IMo. Felt like before the injuries he, bi and crew were really on the verge of getting ‚Äúit‚Äù.   Having said that, even tho he‚Äôs my favorite player. I‚Äôd say BI....Also Jaylen,PG, murray, sabonis. But to me no ‚Äústar‚Äù considered untouchable is as overrated as Tatum. He‚Äôs not a guy I‚Äôd have turned down AD for. Brown just brings way too much similarly for that to be a stopping point. Tatum to me has become very overrated. He‚Äôs on the same level as the aforementioned guys imo. But treated like he‚Äôs already a little Kobe."
Jaylen Brown is definitely better than a lot of guys franchises consider untouchable
Maybe Jaylen Brown? I think most ‚Äústars‚Äù could get moved if the offer is good enough.
"Trey Young, Gobert, Tatum, Capella are his best 4 vs Steph, Draymond, Jaylen Brown, and Donovan Mitchel are my best 4.  I had a shot if Curry kept up his hot scoring but no chance without him."
"that‚Äôs not the most likely scenario.   Nets stay at 2 seed. If Wizards win vs Cleveland and Charlotte loses to the Knicks, they would be even in the standings (CHA has tiebreaker). Wizards would them have a shot at the 8 seed if they beat Charlotte on the last day of the season.  they‚Äôd face Boston in the playins (with no Jaylen Brown) and if they won they‚Äôd face Brooklyn  All of those are likely outcomes... if Beal plays vs. Charlotte and Boston"
"Well to be fair..they traded for Kyrie and then he leaves to join the Nets, pretty much sucks.   Then they sign Kemba and have Hayward back and then no one saw Hayward declining a $30 million PO to sign with another team.   Then Kemba gets injured, now he's just ok for them but a bad contract overall.   They completely failed last off season, didn't manage to sign anyone to fix their team. Not getting Myles Turner is looking like a total mistake. Just tons of little things added up. It's really questionable what they do in the next off-season to fix their issues, Fournier is just ok for them, it would be a miracle for them trade Kemba. Boston is of course in a much better position than at least 90% of the league just because they have Jayson Tatum who is one of the most valuable young superstars in the league. Jaylen Brown helps too. All Boston needs is to figure out their center problem big time and they'll look so much better, plug the hole that Hayward left behind too."
I mean if we are going by this stat Melo has the edge on him. He‚Äôs been absurd in isolation scoring 1.16 ppp which is the same as KD on similar number of isolations per game as Jokic and Jaylen Brown.

"The only trade for a superstar that‚Äôs ever even possibly on the table was swapping Jaylen Brown for Kawhi a few years back. And given that was during the peak KD Warriors years, I think holding onto Jaylen for potentially the long term was the move.  There has never been a star trade on the table that didn‚Äôt involve either Brown or Tatum.  Also all of this is forgetting that the Celtics did use a pick from the Nets that later became Collin Sexton to trade for Kyrie."
"The only candidates I see are Randle (runaway), Jerami Grant, MPJ, Jordan Clarkson, and Jaylen Brown"
Is Jaylen Brown better than CJ McCollum?
My vote is for Jaylen Brown
Add Donovan Mitchell to that list and any of them would be very deserving. I'd probably go Jaylen Brown if I had any input.
Jaylen Brown should definitely be I‚Äôm the conversation. Dude walks the walk...
&gt; player but I'd much rather have Jaylen Brown who can create for others.  Wut?  Where do you people come up with these things?  Tatum is 10x the facilitator and passer that Jaylen is. He‚Äôs been working on it all year long and is getting really good at it.
"Jaylen Brown, Jrue Holiday, Donovan Mitchell, Brogdon off the top of my head."
Jaylen Brown
i feel like he‚Äôs just to a great fit with jayson tatum and jaylen brown. they need a pure playmaker on that squad and kemba isn‚Äôt that
"&gt;but I'd much rather have Jaylen Brown who can create for others.   Brown is a below average playmaker, there a reason why we don't try in run the offense with Brown a whole lot."
"Jaylen Brown wasn‚Äôt even close to being the player he was today and Tatum was just showing flashes   Hayward had a peg leg  Rozier is the definition of average   Smart is an amazing defender but he was a legit awful shooter 3 years ago  Morris, Theis, and Baynesis are career role players    the only person on your team who was that good was Kyrie"
The real reason to consider Jaylen Brown
Ez LeBron award  On the real probably someone like Jaylen Brown
Jaylen brown kyrie or Jeremy Lin all deserving players
Jaylen brown most deserving

"Ah yes the terrible, healthy in the playoffs starting line up of Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward and Al Horford with Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Daniel Theis, Aron Baynes and Robert Williams of the bench 3 years ago. A 4-1 loss in the second round is all that could be expected of such a subpar roster. PJ Dozier on a two way then"
"Nothing. Just a couple of scrubs called Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Kyrie Irving."
I do like how the sympathy for the Celts / Jaylen Brown lasted all of like 5 minutes lmao  I'm just morosely waiting for the bandwagon flairs to be released like I'm in a bread line in Soviet Russia
"Yep, so the Nets traded the following picks:          - 2014 1st round draft pick.   - 2016 1st round draft pick (Jaylen Brown was later selected),    - a 2017 1st round draft pick (this was traded for the Philly's 2017 1st on draft day with the Fultz pick trade and was used on Jayson Tatum).  -  a 2018 1st round draft pick (was used in the Kyrie trade)"
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum.
Jaylen Brown is injured bro they're not the same as the ECF team
What a dumb post. They have Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum. They're in a far better position than most teams.
He‚Äôs come off the bench basically all year even when it‚Äôs meant us having to do things like start Jaylen Brown at point guard against the Hawks one game. Think more than anything it‚Äôs that we need a steady presence of the bench and Payton has had taken on that role quite well despite being a rookie
What you want to see from him is a Jaylen Brown-like improvement in that area.
"I guess fuck ainge, but what is there to hate about jaylen brown or tatum? I loved brown coming out of cal and hating tatum just cus hes on the celtics sucks cus you miss out on appreciating a guy who might be an alltime great"

Jaylen Brown? Why would he be All NBA over anyone here?
&gt;he's ass. ben simmons repertoire featuring spin move. anyone who can stand straight up makes him inefficient. see jaylen brown absolute lockdown.    You call this criticism? Just seems like trolling to me
"I like Jaylen Brown a lot, despite the fact that he's a C. Plays hard on both ends. Improves every year. Smart guy. Makes any team better."
Honestly I think ainge should be getting way more blame for this Celtics season. He has not put a good team together next to jaylen brown and Tatum and it shouldn‚Äôt be that hard to build around two really good wings
"Jaylen brown is out, and there's still players like kemba and smart who just had an injury not to long ago."
"Tatum and Kemba will singlehandedly carry the C‚Äôs into the 6 seed and they will be the sleeper of the East.  Plus, Jaylen Brown Ewing Theory"
"Lol who knew Jaylen Brown was a bench bum, today I learned"
Live in KC and my favorite team is the Celtics. KG was one of my favorites in high school and I got sucked in during their title run in 08 or whenever. Been a Celtics fan ever sense. Now I‚Äôm a huge fan of Jaylen Brown. So bummed he‚Äôs out
"Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown.  Fight me Celtics fans"
Jaylen Brown is demanding a trade in 2 years.
"No, unless they acquire a major free agent + that free agent brings a friend. Will probably involve trading Jaylen Brown"
"Well if you asked this around 4 years ago the Celtics were the #1 pick for this question.   That roster will be a conundrum for people in the future  &gt;Kyrie Irving &gt;Jaylen Brown &gt;Jayson Tatum &gt;Gordon Hayward  &gt;Al Horford  That‚Äôs just insane considering the role players like Marcus Smart, Aaron Baynes, Daniel Theis, Terry Rozier, and Marcus Morris. They also had draft picks galore, a great young coach, and solid management.  The point is it is a lot harder to win irl than it is on paper, and it‚Äôs hard to forecast the future.  Can‚Äôt believe that got fucked up so hard in so many different ways."
"If Ben Simmons could shoot, he‚Äôd still be worse than Jaylen Brown. But that‚Äôs nothing to be ashamed of"
"I agree with you on unselfish play. There's nothing wrong with passing instead of shooting. My point was that the star players are the stars because they make the shots at the end of the game. They're the best ones on the team.  Kobe shot game winners after horrible shooting performances multiple times. A couple games ago Jaylen Brown hit a three to win after a terrible game performance. My point is that regardless of Game performance I'd rather have a star player take the shot cause that's what they're built for.  Of course, I'm talking about top 15-20 players, not every team has a star or a superstar."
"Am I the only one to support two teams? I am from Germany and found it difficult to decide which team to root for. Ended up with the wolves, because I watched Fargo and thought Minnesota looked kinda cool. Also ended with the Celtics because I really liked Kemba and Jaylen Brown and they seemed to have a bright future. I didn‚Äôt want to root for a team that‚Äôs complete garbage because I already do that in soccer. They rarely play each other and probably never will play each other in the post season. So I can watch twice the amount of basketball games in which I am invested in."
"Both Celtics bias.  Tatum is better than Luka   Jaylen Brown is the closest to Michael Jordan in play style in the current NBA   Edit: Also, Pierce over Wade"
That'd be highway robbery.  &amp;#x200B;  If Jaylen Brown gets on and he doesn't...

"I like this iteration of the Celtics, and I've always been high on Jaylen Brown. This fucking sucks man."

Big Jaylen Brown fan but I think he needs his own team. He and Tatum not a good fit together.
Lakers fan here but that really sucks. Love Jaylen Brown. Hope he has a speedy recovery.
This is slightly less fun given the news about Jaylen Brown...but the idea of getting to watch the Celtics lose then immediately watch the Knicks beat the Lakers to clinch a playoff spot in the year of our lord 2021 has me ready to run through a wall.
Did you hear the one about Jaylen Brown? üòÇüòÇüòÇ /s
Jaylen Brown seems like a really good dude too. It's even worse when players like that get hurt.
It's been F the Cs for a while but Jaylen Brown is so good. You guys are too good for a lottery pick but I hope you find some gem in the draft. I do also think your bench needs to be upended.
"Team rivalry is just a sports thing. But we don't ask for injuries, and it's hard to dislike Jaylen Brown. One of the smartest, most thoughtful and progressive kids in the game right now. We're a better league for having him."
"Without Jaylen Brown, boston"
"it sucks to be injured  1. atleast this isnt a serious injury, these tend to heal alright and dont impact mobility  2. celtics were kinda meh this season so it might be a blessing to take jaylen brown out a bit early and essentially call it a day,. a lot of guys come back from less serious injuries more motivated too."
Stop embarrassing us. Siakam got slapped by jaylen brown. He had no answer like 6 possessions in a roll they forced him to take shots and he got stuffed every time. Forget rankings and watch the games
"Of the 2016 draft class, Jaylen Brown is #1 in total games played (398). Buddy Hield in 2nd with 383.  In terms of minutes, Jaylen Brown is #2 in the class (11,083) behind only Jamal Murray (11,645)."
"Jaylen Brown was the only reason i didnt completely hate yall, hope he heals quickly and it doesnt affect his career, he is a dog on the court and an outstanding young man in general"
Jaylen Brown just got ruled out of being in the playoffs due to injury so he can‚Äôt hold this postseasons inevitable failure against the org
"Got my ESPN headliines ready for tomorrow.  **If Celtics beat Heat:**  Are the Celtics better without Jaylen Brown?  **If Celtics lose:**  Is Jaylen Brown the most important ""Jay"" In C-Town?"
"No, Jaylen tweaked his ankle in that collision. Sounds like Brown has been playing with this awhile now and the team didn‚Äôt figure it out until now. Who the fuck knows how that happens."
Mannnn fuck the Celtics but I love Jaylen Brown :/ it‚Äôs not fun laughing at the Celtics if they‚Äôre injured
"Gotta return the favor from last year.   Heal up to Jaylen Brown though, fuck injuries."
"Definitely, kind of reminds me of the Jaylen Brown deal. Everyone called us crazy at the time but you just can't let a talent like that walk. Jaylen is probably one of my favorite players, and I think Mikal can be better than him, so yeah you just can't let him leave over money"
"I don‚Äôt see it being Beal tbh, think he stays‚Ä¶ my pipe dream is Jaylen Brown if the Celtics collapsed in the playoffs and next year."
"Favorite player is Jaylen Brown, but I feel like LeBron when I play. I‚Äôm in shape, and pretty huge. Flying to the rim, occasional runner off glass, but not afraid to post up into fade-away with a three here and there."
"Jaylen Brown is one step behind AJ Bouye in a race, but that‚Äôs all I know pretty much"

"Yea Caruso won‚Äôt get 20 but your forgetting the people that will. You literally forgot the best player in the league that didn‚Äôt even play today. Then Shroder can give u 15 or 20 a night.   It‚Äôs both hard matchups for u but I think u have a better chance against the Clips because your interior defense is so weak. Lakers best offense is in the paint and the Clippers are best at shooting 3s.  Lakers also have the number one defense in the league and clamped up elite guards from last year playoffs like Westbrook, Harden, Dame, McCollum, and Murray. I feel like the lakers can lock up booker and Cp3 too.   We struggle against elite wings like Kawhi, PG, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Jimmy and even Jermi Grant from last year on the defensive end."
They beat the Celtics led by jaylen brown

&gt;Maybe like Jaylen Brown is becoming what Andrew Wiggins should have been.
"He‚Äôs asking which players met expectations that were set for another player that ended up becoming a bust. So take any bust ( his case Wiggins ), and see if there‚Äôs a player out there who ended up being what we expected Wiggins to become ( Jaylen brown in this case )  Idk if that is any simpler or not"
Yes no way they are gonna give Brad Beal or Jaylen Brown All-NBA over Harden let alone LeBron
"Luke Kornet is not a bum, he has been really solid for us but go on.  Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that he plays guys like Grant who do literally nothing positive over someone like Jabari Parker who can at least score, or Langford who can at least defend.  Kemba, Smart, Brown, Tatum, Williams  Pritchard, Langford, Nesmith, Parker, Thompson  That‚Äôs a really solid, 4 seed type lineup.   Yes, a lot of those guys have been hurt. But they aren‚Äôt now. Jaylen is the only one out but some of those other guys still don‚Äôt see minutes, and the ones that do do not get them consistently enough.  Sure, this isn‚Äôt a championship roster, but even with the injuries a good coach would have this team easily at least 8 games above .500."
&gt;The only common denominator between both teams is Stevens   Well Actually the common denominators are the Jays. I think that they both should be traded this off season for the way the team has underperformed. Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum for Ty Jerome and Al Horford who says no?
"Their shooting isn‚Äôt really some massive dip.  The Celtics have the same issues that the sixers do in that they can‚Äôt put 4 shooters on the floor at the same time.   So they put out grant Williams, tatum gets doubled, kemba gets Bam to guard him, Williams probably airballs, and they continue with doubling tatum because there is nobody else that can get buckets.  Unless they get jaylen brown back at halftime they probably end the game shooting under 20% from 3."
"I honestly think Tatum and Brown needed the gut check this season.  They get credit for the playoff runs, but Tatum wasn't on the first ECF team, and Brown barely played.  Tatum was a rookie on the second one, while Jaylen was averaging like 12 points a game.  Last year they beat the Sixers without Simmons, and a Toronto team that had lost Kawhi in FA.    I think they thought they were entitled to a deep playoff run, and they're not players who can coast during the regular season and figure it out.  They have to play with passion and heart, and they have to set the tone for the entire team to do so."
No Jaylen Brown but Robert williams is back and starting
"I do think RJ‚Äôs definitely improved (the shooting and defense stand out the most), but I just don‚Äôt really see the traits of a star player. I think he lacks high-end athleticism or wiggle, and while he‚Äôs definitely an improving shooter, you have to be a super dynamic one to be a star without top physical tools. All in all, I just don‚Äôt think he has any elite skill, which pretty much every star player has one of (be it elite size, athleticism, skill, vision, etc.). The one possibility that I do acknowledge is that he could be like Jaylen Brown and he just gets markedly better each year. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs the athlete Brown is, but his improvements in shooting and ball handling have facilitated his ascent. Maybe Barrett can follow that path.   I‚Äôm also admittedly bullish on Ja, and he‚Äôs struggled more this year than I would have expected, but he has those elite traits in spades. He‚Äôs a top tier athlete and has excellent passing vision. Those two things together make for a higher ceiling than Barrett has (to me at least). I‚Äôm just rolling the dice on a guy who I can envision being a star player.   As for Quickley, I just have a hard time envisioning him being a starting guard. He‚Äôs not a plus distributor, so you don‚Äôt really want him being the primary facilitator. And really, I just don‚Äôt think he can score efficiently enough to be real solid starter: he‚Äôs shooting 40.1% from 2 on the season! That‚Äôs REALLY bad. And thanks largely against backups. I don‚Äôt really see him being efficient enough against NBA starters to be a real stable piece of a starting lineup. Whereas with Bane it‚Äôs easy to see: he stands in the corner and makes 40+ percent of the 3s that come his way while trying to fit in around the margins."
How a Jaylen Brown led Celtics team lost to this team is beyond me
"The only passable Celtic was Jaylen Brown in that series. They got torched by George Hill, Pat Connaughton, and Ersan Ilyasova. Its a team game and most of the Celtics looked completely scared and shook. Horford, Tatum, Hayward were also very poor offensively. I assume anyone blaming Kyrie just looked at the box score and didn't watch any games."
The pairing of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown won't work.
"I think it's more just a downstream effect Embiid taking up a bunch of F votes might affect the candidates at the F spots. But yeah it's not a big deal  I do think if we are letting Embiid be counted as an F we should really just do away with positional designations at this point for good. Outside of the true Cs everything else is interchangeable. Even guards like Kyle Lowry will spend playoff series guarding Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, technically they are playing a ""forward"" spot defensively those times. Doncic counts as a G, Ben Simmons counts as a G but LeBron has to count as an F, it's all just arbitrary as hell."
"I don‚Äôt know about that, I don‚Äôt think most lottery talents in the past 5-10 years have done much in their first year unless they‚Äôre drafted to be a franchise player. Jaylen Brown averaged 6.6 points as a rookie, Fox averaged 11 on bad effeciency his first year, Sabonis averaged 6. I can‚Äôt think of any lottery pick that had an immediate impact the last 5 years other than Trae (who they built the system specifically for, Luka (same thing), and like Ben Simmons who is a top player in the league. Taking projects in the lottery is very acceptable, if you think their potential is out of this world."
"Jaylen brown and fox def, maybe Lavine but depends what ur team needs"
"ok heres 20-25 (im not gonna do 25+) ppg scorers. i was curious so i looked. i think hes better (on offense) than only rozier and grant on offense (and im not even sure). i understand simmons plays a non-traditional role on the sixers, but seth is still wrong imo  List of 20-25 ppg scorers: Jaylen Brown, Collin Sexton, Julius Randle, Nikola Vucevic, Brandon Ingram, Paul George, Jerami Grant, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan, Pascal Siakam, Jamal Murray, Malcolm Brogdon, Khris Middleton, Domantas Sabonis, Terry Rozier"
1st seed with crowder Bradley horford smart. No good sidekick like jaylen brown for IT as brown wasnt in the rotation. IT led those celtics better

"Danny Ainge, the guy who assembled the roster of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker (who was coming off a starting all-star season when we signed him), Marcus Smart, Robert Williams, Evan Fournier, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, and Tristan Thompson? one of the most solid and YOUNG 9-man rotations in the league? there are problems with this team, and none of them are Ainge"
Jaylen Brown
"If 3 conference finals in the last 4 years is wasting Jaylen Brown and 2 in the last 3 years is wasting Jayson Tatum, I don't know what the fuck your expectations are. 1/30 teams win a title everywhere. The obvious move would be to exchange Kemba out for a different guard."
"EVERYONE hated the Brown pick though, right? Wasn't it a consensus over reach by Danny at the time, that's what I remember. His destiny was supposed to be bench 3&amp;D role player max. One of his smartest picks ever. So who's to say they'd even take Jaylen, I would assume not"
jaylen brown out too
"Bro are you drunk lmao, man made no mention of IQ whatsoever just said than Jaylen Brown is a pretty good volume scorer (which is a fact)"
Jaylen brown. Not close. Only philly fans think Ben Simmons can net someone like James harden/dame kind. Like the other side will hang up asap
I‚Äôm taking jaylen brown over this fraud 12/10 times
How is comparing Simmons to Brown considered slander?     I wasn't aware that Jaylen Brown was considered to be so much better than Simmons that it would be insulting to compare the two.
I‚Äôd have current Jaylen brown with his injury over simmons
Jaylen Brown all day long
Jaylen Brown pretty easily
Jaylen brown but you're just baiting for more slander on Ben
"You do realize that doing 2.1 points better/game and 1.1 rebounds better/game don‚Äôt matter nearly as much as doing 4.5 assists better/game, right? It‚Äôs not like Lavine is destroying Trae in scoring, but Trae is absolutely crushing him in facilitating, nearly doubling up Lavine in assists.   For subjectivity, Trae has higher bbiq, more poise in tough situations (two comebacks vs the 1 seed in case you‚Äôve watched any basketball lately), and is a proven leader of a team that isn‚Äôt in the gutter of the eastern conference. I‚Äôm sure the Bulls will be better at some point in the next few years, but it sure as hell isn‚Äôt the current situation.  Still, the Jaylen Brown &gt; Trae Young guy probably doesn‚Äôt care about much except for hating on Trae."
"He‚Äôs a better player, sorry that you can‚Äôt see it. Bet you were one of the people that said Trae had ‚Äúempty stats‚Äù when he scored 30/game last year.   And rebounds for a PG are far less relevant. Also do you want to refute me saying that Trae is a better facilitator than Lavine? Would love to see what you have to say for that.  Anyways, you‚Äôre the person that thinks Jaylen Brown is better than Trae. Some people just can‚Äôt be reasoned with ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"There was a thread before the season started asking to rank these players in order: Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, Ben Simmons. I was shocked that my ranking in that order was controversial."
"I would rather have Murray, BI, Jaylen Brown, Sabonis, or Siakam right now than Ben Simmons, just looking at that draft class."
"James Young, Jaylen Brown, Fultz/Tatum, Sexton  Pretty good"
They are so uneven with it too.. Embiid does the absolute most off these dunk type plays and gets nothing.. same with giannis.. but when other guys like Jaylen Brown dunk and do a little flex they hit them with a T. Stupid rule that isnt enforced equally..
How so?  Is extra rest going to prevent kyrie Irving from falling awkwardly and spraining his ankle??  Is the extra rest going to prevent Jamal Murray from landing on one leg and injured his ACL?  Jaylen Brown landed on his wrist after getting fouled. Had season ending surgery. Can these thing be prevented with rest?  These injuries are Accidents that happen when playing a game. Yeah we don‚Äôt talk about other guys on non playoff teams cause they aren‚Äôt the ones playing right now.
", Vucevic easily. Maybe Jaylen Brown too but I can‚Äôt remember how good he was doing at that point in the year.    , Never mind forgot Ben was forward for all star"
"Jaylen brown is a similar type of player i terms of overall value imo.  On offense he‚Äôs just fucking scary. He‚Äôs got a monster handle, one of the best midrange games today, and is a flamethrower from 3 while being able to finish through everything.   There are games where he just doesn‚Äôt miss and it‚Äôs absolutely absurd.   But on defense he‚Äôs a complete liability, similar to Simmons on offense. His off ball D basically cost the Cs at their chance at a finals berth last year (if Hayward comes back 2 weeks later and is actually healthy they probably win it).  The difference comes from Jaylen improving every season on both ends, and Simmons getting worse on offense."
Lol who in his right mind would pass Jaylen Brown for Ben Simmons.   Ben is a complete liability on offense.
"The 76ers had back-to-back #1 picks, and they wasted them on Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz  In 2016, Simmons was picked ahead of Brandon Ingram (#2) and Jaylen Brown (#3)  In 2017, Fultz was picked ahead of Lonzo Ball (#2) and Jayson Tatum (#3)  Which goes to show how successful the Celtics have been with those two drafts"
I can‚Äôt believe we didn‚Äôt pick Jaylen Brown what a waste of talent
"He was really good on Oregon. Took them to the Elite 8 five years ago and beat Duke, also had a game winner on an undefeated UCLA team  I‚Äôm a Celtics fan and he‚Äôs kind of the Grizzlies version of Jaylen Brown in the fact that he was drafted first and is a fantastic Robin to their respective superstar"
I think at this point I would rather have jaylen brown than Ben Simmons
"Show me even one lol.  He didn‚Äôt play the game due to injury but he was selected as an injury replacement.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bookede01.html Basketball reference is saying hes an all star in 2021.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker Wikipedia also lists him as an all star in 2021.   I‚Äôm being punked right? Next you‚Äôre going to tell me that Jaylen Brown wasn‚Äôt an all star but he‚Äôs obviously better than DLo, so whatever point you were making stands."
"If rather have Ingram, Murray, Jaylen brown, sabonis. Siakam is arguable"
No one I'd rather have than Jaylen Brown.
"Friendly reminder that the 76ers could have drafted Brandon ingram/jaylen brown and/or Jason Tatum. Instead,  they got Markelle Fultz and Bum Simmons"
This sub told me they‚Äôd take him over Jaylen Brown lmfao I didn‚Äôt forget ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
I was trashed once for saying I'd rather have Jaylen Brown in the Playoffs.
"Amazing the fall from grace Ben Simmons had, just like 3 months ago you still had sixers fans saying he was better than Jaylen Brown lol"
Why you leave us out? We lost 3/5 of our starters. 2 went down in the playoffs. No Jaylen Brown.
Also Jaylen Brown with a broken wrist
simmons and shake for jaylen brown and smart
Jaylen Brown injury.    Trae Young's mysterious shoulder.
Jaylen Brown didn't even make the playoffs :(
"Lots of teams have better players than Jaylen Brown. Is there a reason why you feel like he is the most coveted trade asset in the league? Those picks are something, but they're not great. Lots of teams could trade their best player. The Jazz could offer Donovan Mitchell, the Bucks could offer Giannis, the Hawks could offer Trae, the Sixers could offer Embiid, etc. All those teams would almost certainly rather have Luka than those guys.   But even if we're going with the assumption that teams won't trade legit All NBA talent for Luka (which is a poor assumption, IMO), the Thunder could trade SGA, Dort and like 15 picks, or the Pelicans could trade Ingram and like 10 picks. Those packages leave the Celtics in the dust. Sorry."
"I see you didn't go into Harden, LeBron, Murray or Jaylen Brown for some reason. Curious."
Nobody has a Jaylen brown plus the draft capital to offer like we do. We would easily trade all of our future picks for luka
"Since we are missing a representative, I am just here to say that Jaylen Brown also got hurt"
No Jaylen Brown either (not that they would‚Äôve got by the Nets but still)
I never said Turner was a great defender 1-5 I said he was pretty good and able to defend 1-5 if need be.  I would say Myles Turner‚Äôs contract being between Clint capella and jaylen brown is pretty good considering he‚Äôs been a dpoy candidate the last 3-4 and years and is arguably better than capella in everything except rebounding.  There‚Äôs a reason Myles Turner is included in so many trade propositions. Teams want a 5 who can play good d and stretch the floor on the end
"Don't forget:  \- Michael Porter Jr. playing with a messed up back.  \- Beal and Westbrook playing hurt hurt  \- Jaylen Brown broken wrist  \- Lebron playing hurt  \- Luka playing hurt  &amp;#x200B;  The only healthy ""stars"" right now are Giannis, Holiday, Middleton, Trae Young, PG, Ben Simmons, Tobais Harris, Booker, and Durant.  Atlanta and Milwaukee are the only teams with all their stars healthy right now.  And let's not forget this list is way way worse if you look at the regular season.  Almost no star player got through the season without at least one significant injury."
Jaylen Brown - torn wrist ligament
Did LeBron not load manage? Did Kawhi not load manage? Were Chris Paul and Kyrie Irving‚Äôs injuires not contact injuries? Did Harden not take 15% of the season off to go to the club?  Jaylen Brown hurt is hand. Anthony Davis always picks up injuries. Joel Embiid always picks up injuries.   Injuries are a reality.
"They picked their defense up. But playoff defensive rankings aren't that relevant.   Especially since in a conversation about Milwaukee underperforming offensively, that itself is adding to why the Nets playoff defense is what it is. If Milwaukee was performing how they should offensively then the Nets aren't top 3 in playoff defense.   They also faced a Celtics team without Jaylen Brown."
I would also add Celtics being shit because Jaylen Brown injury
Add to that Jaylen Brown was out with a season ending wrist injury.
"Turner isn‚Äôt a great defender 1-5.   An example of that would be someone like Bam. If I put Myles on a good PG he‚Äôs getting cooked.  &gt;Myles has a good contract  Myles deal is between guys like capella, bogdanovic (high tier starter)  and guys like vanvleet and jaylen brown (borderline allstar).  He‚Äôs nowhere close to good enough when healthy to justify that kind of deal."
Jaylen brown? What does a broken hand have to do with anything? Thanks for proving my point
Jaylen Brown? Murray? AD? Theres so many cf teams with injuries.
yeah it's actually pretty telling that the last 4 teams in the playoffs last year:  Lakers: significant injuries to AD and LeBron  Heat: battling injuries up and down the roster all season  Celtics: Jaylen Brown  Nuggets: Jamaal Murray
Some people might think of him more as a slasher thanks to his athleticism but Jaylen Brown was far more of a mid-range player this year.
"First team all-hospital:  CP3, Kyrie, Kawhi, AD, Embiid  Second team all-hospital:  Conley, Murray, Harden, Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams  Honorable mentions: Kemba, Cam Reddish, Donte Divincenzo, Jeff Green, Jayson Tatum for like half of game 2"
"Harden, Lebron, and Jaylen Brown should be there."
Anthony Davis - Groin - LIMITED    LeBron James - Ankle - LIMITED    Chris Paul - Shoulder/COVID-19 -LIMITED    Joel Embiid - Meniscus tear - LIMITED    Luka Doncic - Neck - LIMITED    Donovan Mitchell - Ankle - LIMITED    Donte DiVencenzo - Foot - OUT    Jaylen Brown - Torn ligament - OUT    Jamal Murray - ACL - OUT    Kawhi Leonard - Knee - LIMITED    Mike Conley - Hamstring - OUT         Did I miss anyone?
"Yep, it's 100% due to the shortened off-season. And notice how the players who went deep in the playoffs last year either got hurt late in the season or in the first round (Jaylen Brown, AD, LeBron, Jamal Murray), and now we're seeing the guys who were eliminated in the second round last year get hurt (Kawhi and Harden)? I can't help but wonder how many other injuries we're gonna see as these playoffs continue. Let's hope we don't see any truly career-altering injuries so we can just get past this madness without totally screwing over next year as well.   Oh wait, this off-season is going to be almost as short as last year's was! ü§¶"
Jaylen Brown (Hand )
NBA All Star Jaylen Brown
OP has yet to consider Jaylen Brown
"The bench would be stacked if that is your starting five, CP3, Jaylen Brown, Mitchell.... and the list goes on and on"
Does Harden count? He‚Äôs clearly not back from the hamstring injury. Add CP3 too. Jaylen Brown can come off the bench.
"This is why the owners love the players unions.   The players, in a direct democracy, cannot properly advocate for themselves as a class, because the bench guys will do whatever the owners say since they need to get paid. They can't afford to vote for a lockout. NBPA needs to just say ""we elected Chris Paul and Jaylen Brown as our reps, we trust them to make the decisions"", but until then, the players as a whole will keep getting shafted."
Jaylen Brown for the Celtics.
Jaylen Brown also missed the playoffs  Not saying they would win vs BKN but it would certainly have been closer
"True to form, these playoffs will really be a war of attrition.   AD, KCP, Donte, CP3, Doncic, Embiid, Jaylen Brown, Kemba, Robert Williams, Ibaka.   Even the players who were out previously or recently injured, Lebron, Tank Bryant, Oladipo, Spida, Jamal Murray.  Now Kawhi could be out. Harden, Kyrie, Embiid, Conley have lingering issues. CP3 Covid-positive."
"My B on Jaylen Brown. For some reason was thinking Tatum had been the only all-star named from the Celtics this year.  To answer your question, I‚Äôd trade a healthy Conley for a healthy Jaylen Brown or Murray any day. Dude is one of the most slept on PGs in the league‚Äîput up almost identical numbers to CP13 for most of the season and people talk about CP13 as being a best all-time PG and forget that Conley exists. There‚Äôs a reason he‚Äôs getting paid the money he is.  My bigger point is that folks out here all morning talking about this being an asterisk championship and largely ignoring that one of the teams still in the running‚Äîthe Jazz‚Äîhad the best record in the regular season even though they had two all-stars injured for large parts of that and are now 2-2 with the Clips even though Conley has been out 4 games. If the Jazz win the series we‚Äôll hear forever about how we wouldn‚Äôt have won if Kawhi was injured, but the Clips never woulda heard (besides from Jazz fans) that they never would have won if Conley‚Äîa critical part of the Jazz‚Äôs defense and offense‚Äîhadn‚Äôt been injured. The Double-Standard is trash, and your Conley-ignoring list buys right into that."
"Literally made the all star team this year after multiple injuries c‚Äômon man lol. Jaylen brown made an all star team this year - what? He made it as a reserve - not as an injury replacement either.   Jamal Murray showed up in the playoffs. I consider him the breakout player from last year‚Äôs playoffs. He‚Äôs inconsistent as hell during the regular season tho. If you don‚Äôt want to include him above, you don‚Äôt have to. Conley is not in that class of guys.   Look at it this way. Who says no if you offered Conley straight up for any of the guys I mentioned? I think everyone says no to y‚Äôall. Do you say no to any of them?"
Jaylen Brown
You listed two non all-stars on your list (Murray and jaylen brown) and didn‚Äôt list Conley‚Äîan all-star who would be a perennial all-star if WC guards weren‚Äôt so stacked.  And if you think he‚Äôs the 4th or 5th most important person on the Jazz‚Äôs team you‚Äôre cracked. Through the regular season depending on the night the dude was never less than the third most important player on the team and was very often more consistent and more valuable defensively and in his ability to run the offense than Mitchell.  People not including the Jazz in conversations about teams dealing with injuries are casuals. Jazz are 2-2 against a healthy Clippers without an all-star PG. Sucks for Kawhi and the Clips but this injury balanced an imbalanced series more than anything. Put some respect on Mike Conley‚Äôs name.
Jaylen Brown?
jaylen brown...
"The Lakers were the best team in the conference until Davis got injured. Then we began our descent from 1 to 7 lol.   The nets would‚Äôve been a pretty easy no. 1 seed if Durant, harden, and Kyrie played. Not to mention they were missing Dinwiddie too.   Y‚Äôall and the Suns managed to have the healthiest seasons. Some teams, like the Celtics, were rocked by Covid as well. It‚Äôs not to take away from y‚Äôall, but injuries have played a massive role this year, especially because it‚Äôs been a lot of superstars and stars.   Lebron   Davis   Harden   Kyrie   Jaylen Brown   Murray   Klay   Embiid‚Äôs not healthy   And now Kawhi   That‚Äôs a pretty long fucking list lol"
Interesting. I wonder if you'd like to see jaylen brown and Jayson Tatum split up.. I mean one more big trade and they are in BKN territory in terms of star power are they not??
"Based on their listed positions, you have Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Zach Lavine, and Jrue Holiday contending for the two spots in a hypothetical 5th team. One of those players is going to be relegated to the 8th team All-NBA. The guard talent in the NBA is insane right now."
"Bro he literally took a game off of the most talented NBA team ever assembled without Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams, or Kemba Walker.  Miss me with that shit. Tatum had the most 50 point games this season (45% of them). He‚Äôs one of the great scorers miss me with that shit."
the thing for Mitchell n Tatum Is that the spotlight for their team wasn‚Äôt really on them during the regular season and was on their teammates. Like jaylen brown really raised his value the most on that Celtics team. And both Conley and Gobert took center stage throughout the season for the jazz.
As a C's fan i got roasted in the Celtics sub for not wanting to trade Jaylen Brown for Giannis.......
Jaylen Brown
"You mentioned RJ, Noel, Bullock, and Quickley. RJ is a sophomore who didn't even make an all rookie team (wasn't a top 15 rookie last year). Noel and Bullock are journeymen who no one would have talked about has assets to a team until this year. And Quickley is a rookie who was picked with the 25th pick. All those guys played way better than were expected this year but a big reason for that is because Randle made them better.   And yes they were available more often than the supporting cast of Celtics but none of those guys are even close to being an all star.  Meanwhile Celtics had 58 games from a current all star in Jaylen Brown. 43 games from Kemba a 2020 all star. 48 games from Marcus Smart who is more of an asset than any of the Knicks players above.  Maybe you can make the argument that the Knicks supporting cast is better due to health but it's not a huge advantage.  The biggest difference was Randle played 10% more games. And I know you weren't arguing against Randle to start but that is the reason why he is clearly above Tatum for all nba this year."
Yeah to beat a healthy Nets team while missing Jaylen Brown.
Celtics Fans were convinced that missing jaylen brown was more important than the nets missing uncle jeff
"Lazy/arrogant whatever.  Jaylen Brown was a clown with the ball in his hands his first two seasons. He didn't think, ""I don't need to learn how to dribble."" He worked on his handles every year and has been leaps and bounds better every year.  Ben Simmons either doesn't want to shoot, is afraid to shoot, or thinks he doesn't need to shoot. He's a massive liability at the free throw line and can't finish games. So instead of getting better at the thing he's the worst at, he'd rather shit the bed in the playoffs.  So he's either lazy or arrogant."
"I mean, Mitchell, gobert and Conley(remember the start of the season?) all spent time at center stage for the jazz throughout the year.    Just like jaylen brown hurt Tatum‚Äôs chances."
"Notable guys on Winning Teams that didn‚Äôt make the cut:  James Harden (lol)  Donovan Mitchell (literally averaged 26 and led the 1 seed)  Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum  Russell Westbrook  Trae Young  Anthony Davis  Ben Simmons/Tobias Harris (can these guys be combined into one elite first team player instead)  Jaylen Brown   Pretty ridiculous omissions especially Donovan Mitchell. James Harden would‚Äôve definitely made it on if he didn‚Äôt get injured, maybe he‚Äôd have replaced Beal"
Jaylen Brown was the better player for most of the season. Tatum turned it on at the very end.
Jaylen Brown.
"OG is a fantastic role player, another smart draft pick and extension by Masai, he‚Äôs not Jaylen Brown or Kawhi, way too many NBA fans think that development track or something like in 2k is normal. OG can‚Äôt just buy VC to improve his handle rating lmao."
"People think OG has superstar potential. Guys who can't dribble don't become stars unless they're super athletic. Credit to Jaylen Brown for taking that leap but guys like him are the exception not the rule, he was also always a more natural scorer."
There are people on the Celtics sub who unironically say they wouldn't trade Jaylen Brown for Luka
"Given identical circumstances, I'd easily go Jaylen. They may have met in the middle somewhat this season, but I don't see any reason to believe that Wiggins is a straight-up better defender than Brown now and in the future."
"I understand that, but I‚Äôm still taking Jaylen Brown. I will also wait to see another year of Wiggins giving a shit before I mentally deem him ‚Äúgood‚Äù in an area. He‚Äôs always had the ability and the tools, but I want to see at least 1 more year of consistent play before I do"
Is CJ McCollum a better defender than Jaylen Brown then? I‚Äôll have some of what he‚Äôs smoking
Jaylen Brown
‚Ä¶are you serious?  I am taking Jaylen Brown every single time.
"That‚Äôs the kind of dialogue worth having about Tayshaun Prince, not a number 1 draft pick from 5 years ago that was supposed to be the second coming of Lebron James. The dudes motor just isn‚Äôt there with regard to on court offensive aggression/offensive development. Guys like Jaylen Brown, BI, and Mitchell (I know not the same draft class but they‚Äôll forever be compared bc of their ROY race) have continued time and again to add different layers to their game and Simmons has arguably become worse."
Jaylen Brown gonna end up being the best player in his ‚Äútwo guy draft‚Äù draft class wow  My guy please retire a Celtic young king we love you
we need Jaylen Brown and Anthony Edwards and Steven Adams or something.
Simmons is definitely a better defender but jaylen is still a good defender and far from a liability there  I would still take jaylen on almost any team over simmons if I am starting a franchise   Outside of the clippers I can‚Äôt think of many teams that would rather have simmons over jaylen brown
Every Suns fan on earth would be stupid not to. I‚Äôm sure they love him but that‚Äôs like me saying I wouldn‚Äôt trade Jaylen Brown for Luka. It‚Äôs delusional.
Warriors win a title in the next 2 years  Lebron never reaches another Finals cause he ain't in the shitty East no mo  Dame gives in and joins KD's team   both Tatum and Jaylen Brown leave the Celtics   Zion joins Memphis with Morant
If they were to nab a player like Jaylen Brown he‚Äôd definitely stay
Lmao mans said Zach LaVine and Jaylen Brown
So much disrespect on jaylen brown in here
"Booker, Lavine, KAT, Beal, Young, Mitchell and Jaylen Brown are in no way shape or form better overall players than Butler, are you high? ESPECIALLY not Book, that‚Äôs the worst recency bias take I‚Äôve ever seen."
"This is such a leading question lmao. You probably can‚Äôt name 20 guys in NBA history to do that, are you gonna argue that Jimmy is a top 20 player of all time too?  Off the top of my head, these players are better imo (in no particular order):  -	Giannis -	Lebron -	Steph -	KD -	Kawhi -	Harden -	Jokic  -	Luka -	Embiid -	Dame -	Tatum -	AD -	Booker -	DMitch -	PG -	Beal -	Kyrie -	Young -	Lavine -	KAT -	Zion -	Jaylen Brown  And probably more too, I def wasn‚Äôt rigorous making this list (I think I count 22 people on here?). Westbrook isn‚Äôt on this list and he‚Äôd prob average a 30 point triple double in the finals too LOL"
"They hate Kyrie cuz he was a flop and he lied to them about wanting to stay. If you have the memory to go 2 years back you‚Äôll remember that the cities favorite player Isaiah Thomas, was black. Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Al Horford, Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett all are black. No they don‚Äôt hate Kylie cuz he‚Äôs black they hate him cuz he ditched them."
"I agree, I think Beal is the best of the bunch.  Lavine, Mitch, Book and Brown are all very close and similar in a way. I think SGA is last and that's no knock on him, he's super young and definitely going to be a beast. Lavine and Book is interchangeable for me. Both similar on defense with Zach being the better finisher around the rim and 3pt shooter. While book is better at mid range. My list would probably go Beal, Mitchell, Lavine = Book, Brown, SGA. Watch out for my boy Jaylen, he's coming for that 2nd best SG title next year."
Jaylen Brown ends up on the Pistons and he and Cade lead the Pistons deep into the playoffs every year.
Jimmy doesn't even have the best JB name (Jaylen Brown). Name an NBA player with the initials AE that has a better name than Edwards... I'll wait.
"Easily lol  It‚Äôs between Brown and Ingram, with Murray as an hm if he comes back from injury the same as before, and though he had a down year on the defensive end Jaylen can still lock up if it‚Äôs necessary which is why I give the edge to him.  But Ben isn‚Äôt even in the discussion. He isn‚Äôt even top 4 and there is a solid argument to be made he isn‚Äôt top 5 depending on how good you think Sabonis is."
Is he worth so much more than Marcus Smart?   I hope so because I don‚Äôt want Marcus at even 20 mil. Maybe 15 or so.   Jaylen Brown got 26.5 average and put up 25-6-4 on 48-39-75  Seems like Lonzo should be somewhere between.
"The celtics if they're willing to offer jaylen brown (which i dont think so)  Realistically its the sixers because they can offer a combination of simmons, thybulle, maxey, and they have all their future picks"
"Yeah - he is basically a 3&amp;D wing who can't shoot yet.    Your upside is he figures out how to shoot one day and rolls all that athleticism into being the next Jaylen Brown in a few years.  Your downside is you've got another Matisse Thybulle on your hands that you just burned a Top 5 pick on.  Problem is it gets dicey quick after 4.  Some of these guys will hit of course, but good luck guessing right.  So at that point, if Kuminga has the highest ceiling, well, maybe he is the right call at #5."
The best team I could come up with:  PG: Trae Young  SG: Jaylen Brown  SF: Andre Iguodala  PF: Zion Williamson  C: Bam Adebayo
"Calling Jimmy Butler a superstar is a stretch imo, but fair enough. I stand by not wanting to ship out Jaylen Brown for Butler though.   Harden again demanded to go to a very short list of teams (Philly, Miami, Brooklyn) and had shown a willingness to stop trying when discontent. Not a reasonable example.  So out of all listed: we could have traded for a 1 year rental of Kawhi, or for Jimmy Butler. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs 1, maybe 2 times, that Ainge passed on moving for a superstar, I don‚Äôt see the pattern."

I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs 1, maybe 2 times, that Ainge passed on moving for a superstar, I don‚Äôt see the pattern."
"Absolutely false narrative that there have been many star players available. There have been 3: a Kawhi rental that would have cost Jaylen Brown, AD who would only go to the Lakers, and Paul George who moved for an enormous package that the Celtics couldn‚Äôt realistically meet.  People like you love to create this false narrative that Ainge was just passing up superstars to hold onto role players/ picks. There just aren‚Äôt many superstar guys in the league, you can‚Äôt just force a team to move them or force a guy to want to be in Boston.  What‚Äôs your example of all these star players that moved who Ainge didn‚Äôt pull the trigger on?"
"People like you act like there have been a ton of available superstars that Ainge was just like ‚Äúnah I‚Äôll pass‚Äù on. Renting Kawhi would have cost Jaylen Brown, AD was only going to LA, very difficult to match the Paul George asking price, and then no other elite guys have moved.  Also, Tatum is 23 and imo you are wrong if you don‚Äôt think he can be a true #1 eventually/ soon."
"Trying to avoid the young guys like Jaylen Brown or Trae Young who will almost certainly get another AS nod.  C: Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is  PF: Meta World Peace  SF: Josh Howard  SG: Jrue Holiday  PG: Goran Dragic  &amp;#x200B;  Great defensive team. Okay spacing, MWP and Howard could both hit 3s and Holiday and Dragic are decent 3PT guys, All Star Porzi≈Üƒ£is was a 40% 3PT shooter and averaged 23 ppg Dragic has shown he can be a 21 ppg guy, let him go off. Everyone on this team can shoot the 3, you have two ball handlers, a great rim protector in Porzi≈Üƒ£is and elite defenders in MWP and Holiday. If healthy (big if with Josh Howard, and Porzi≈Üƒ£is) this team would win 60+ games IMO."
Trae young  Jaylen brown   Iggy  Zion  Bam adebayo  Maybe goes against the spirit of your question since all of these guys will probably end with multiple All-stars. But right now it's probably the most talented lineup
Here's a list of all stars that were drafted by small market teams in the past 20 years (MVPs in bold):  * Zion * Donovan Mitchell * Bam * Sabonis * KAT * LaVine * **Jokic** * Oladipo * **Giannis** * Gobert * AD * Lillard * Drummond * Middleton * Kyrie * Kemba * Vucevic * Kawhi * Isaiah Thomas * Cousins * Hawyward * PG * **Harden** * Tyreke Evans * **WB** * Love * Hibbert * Lopez * Dragic * **Durant** * Conley * Roy * Rondo * Lowry * Millsap * Bogut * Deron * CP3 * Granger * Dwight * Emeka Okafor * Deng * Jameer Nelson * **Lebron** * Melo * Wade * David West * Mo Williams * Kyle Korver * Amare * Caron Butler * Boozer  Here are those drafted by big markets (top 10: https://mediatracks.com/resources/nielsen-dma-rankings-2020/)  * Trae * Tatum * Ben Simmons * Ingram * Jaylen Brown * Porzingis * D'Angelo Russell * Embiid * Randle * Siakam (I think Toronto is a pretty damn big market) * Beal * Dray * Klay * Butler * Wall * Griffin * **Steph** * DeRozan * Jrue Holiday * Jeff Teague * Rose * DeAndre Jordan * Horford * Noah * Gasol * Aldridge * Bynum * Lee * Devin Harris * Iguodala * Al Jefferson * Bosh * Kaman * Josh Howard * Yao Ming  **A lot more all stars and a lot more superstars were drafted by small market teams.**
"&gt; They could have had Ingram though  By many accounts they couldn't have IIRC, and if they could the deal was basically Ingram and shitty salary filler or something. Boston wouldn't even start discussions about parting with Jaylen Brown, and Philly was the same with Simmons.  The entire reason Toronto was able to whittle them down from OG or Siakam + a 1st, to Poeltl + a heavily protected 1st was because other teams had basically hung the phone up on Sam Antonio at that point."
"&gt;  statistically the best.  That's a very stupid argument. DRtg over two playoff series is incredibly noisy and can't be compared straight up since everyone is playing different opponents. Nets were a bottom 10 defensive team in a 72 game regular season. That's more meaningful that shutting down an injury depleted Celtics team with 1 viable scoring option, or limiting a Bucks team that made basically zero adjustments the entire series.  Actually I just checked, they did an awful job on the Celtics.  Celtics had a 114 ORtg in the regular season with Jaylen Brown, and a 118 ORtg in round 1 vs Brooklyn without their 2nd best scorer. That's absurdly bad defense and tracks with how bad the Nets were defensively in the regular season. Tatum had 31-6-5 that series, so Giannis' 32-13-3 doesn't look that impressive."
"brown went out of his way to get in front of him tho, no? like the defender was runnin straight and jaylen brown was clear of him and then ran into him  giannis was right behind payne"
"‚ÄúLet me tell you why he WILL be an all star, for sure, BUT ONLY IF xyz‚Äù wow what a prediction. Jaylen Brown will be an all star player if he can maintain his numbers, avoid injury, and play good defense, he can definitely make the All Star Game. LeBron will an all star player if he can maintain his numbers, avoid injury, etc. See you can say this stuff about almost anyone‚Ä¶."
"Pistons are championship contenders  Thunder trade picks for an All-Star   Jaylen Brown somehow leaves Boston  Anthony Edwards becomes a top 10 player   AD retired earlier than expected to injuries   Vegas has their own basketball club, and is one of the most successful franchises in the NBA  Chris Paul is a coach   James Wiseman is one of the best centers in the league   Matisse Thybulle is the best defender we've seen in years   Wizards have a core with Avdija, Hachimura, and Gafford   LeBron has a front office position   Cade Cunningham doesn't live up to his potential  THT is an All-Star"
"I mean I obviously realize that but the guy I responded to said it‚Äôd be more smart for them to keep brown who will only keep improving rather than get an aging lillard. So I was saying if they want to test their beliefs that jaylen will keep ascending and they‚Äôll be able to make the leap to championship contenders, they could play the development waiting it out game or do a win now move and go for lillard"
Jaylen Brown has a nasty 3/4 court bounce pass in transition. The other passes range from aight to needs work.
IDK about the Brown trade  Celtics fans said they didnt want to trade Jaylen Brown for Kawhi or AD when they were available  lmfaoo
Boston is not trading Jaylen Brown for that poopoo platter package lmao
"It really depends what else is on offer.  The Harden deal was reportedly Ben 2 FRPs and any 2 out of 2 more FRPs, Maxey, or Thybulle. Houston asked for basically all of that.  I‚Äôm interested to see what other legitimate offers are out there. Guys like Jaylen Brown are a better prize but who knows if they‚Äôre willing to deal."
"Makes sense. Jaylen Brown not exactly the youngest a year into his 2nd deal already, but I could see RJ"
"Maybe I‚Äôm just optimistic but I just see Dame+Zion being *really good* and the Lakers will likely always be able to grab the next big free agent. That‚Äôs just how it is. They got Lebron after being as dysfunctional as they could be.   Though you never know, no one anticipated this Lakers pick being 22, so anything could happen. I‚Äôm just saying if the Knicks offered RJ + half as many picks, I‚Äôd take that over 9 picks. Or Boston offered Jaylen Brown, or Toronto offered 4 + 4 more picks, etc."
"Yeah but Dame is also the focal point of the team. While this is a small sample size, in the 7 games Brown played without Tatum this year his stats are better.  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/jaylen-brown-stats-without-tatum-in-2021"
"This kid's handles look so inaccurate and just slow in general, if he plays the same kind of ISO - slash n' shoot game he forced in college but in the NBA, he's going to just get eaten alive.  Check out like college highlights of Jamal Murray or Lamelo in Euro league if you wanna see how sloppy this dude looks. Even Jaylen Brown in college looked cleaner. He's maybe a great guard one day with some work, but having this much hype on yourself when you don't got the ball on a rope ain't a good sign."
Jaylen Brown is significantly better though
"The Nets are in the Finals if they are healthy.  Tatum+Dame is probably the best 1-2 duo in the league after LeBron/AD. If the Celtics balk at trading Brown, they are missing the boat. Lillard is a top-10 player in the NBA and at times can be the very best offensive player in the NBA. Sure, if he costs Brown, Pritchard, 5 firsts and one of Langford/Nesmith, it's probably not worth it, but Lillard is on an entirely different tier from Jaylen Brown, and he'd be the best player the Celtics have had since Kevin Garnett."
"I love Jaylen Brown the person and player, but man, he is overrated amongst Celtics fans.   He is much closer to being the next Khris Middleton than the next Kawhi Leonard.   I swear a lot of our fans don't really want to win a championship. Making 2 ECFs isn't some guarantee of future success like our fans seem to think it is."
"One of our shittiest years was also when we were led by Jaylen and Jayson.  And I'd disagree -- there was no ""building around"" IT or Kemba. IT was like hitting the lottery -- they didn't draft and trade to build the team around him, he was just in the perfect place at the perfect time, hitting his peak with a coach who got him. Kemba was an added piece. The only PG we arguably tried to build around was Kyrie, and it obviously failed. But for the most part, what has remained consistent with the team-building philosophy is sticking with guys they draft -- Brown, Tatum, and all the rest of the bench garbage they overvalue."
"Damian Lillard is 31 years old in an era where primes are longer and later into guy's careers than ever in NBA history. You act like Jaylen is a lock to be better than Dame, a lock to stay here for his next contract, and that Tatum's a lock to be here as well. Well, if you want to keep one or both of those guys around, you better get some fucking help. Because the rest of this team is dogshit. Dame is better than Brown now -- and you know what? he'll probably be better than him 4 years, too.  And Marcus Smart fucking sucks. Most overrated player on the Celtics for like 10 years."
I don't get why trading Jaylen Brown is a nonstarter.    Dame + Tatum would be a very serious title threat for the next 2-3 years in a way that Tatum + Brown would not be.   You've gotta at least ponder that as an option.
"Jaylen Brown is not a two way wing. Every defensive metric says he‚Äôs below average, he gets lost off ball more than most rookies, his playmaking is a massive negative. He has 3 years left on his deal and he‚Äôs not a lock to stay long term. Kicking the can down the road only further risks losing both of them    Bringing in Lillard instantly makes the Celtics much better and if it‚Äôs something Tatum wants. You absolutely do it"
"&gt;Unless you‚Äôre willing to give up Jaylen Brown as the centerpiece of a trade package  I mean...wouldn't you lol? I'm a Celtics fan and you have to at least consider it. Brown, Smart, whatever. Take them all for Dame lol."
"Good lord no.  r/nba is delusional about looking past the upcoming season.  24 year old two way 6'6 wing who has gotten significantly better every single year in the league and was an All-Star last year.  Locked up next 3 years at $25M-ish.  vs  31 year old undersized PG who has atrocious defense and is on the hook for 4/$176M through age 35.  Like - even lets toss the contracts aside here.  (Which we shouldn't, but...)  If Jaylen Brown makes one more good step forward he's quite arguably a better player than Lillard next year.  And he's still not even in his prime yet.  This is the kind of deal people will look back on in 2-3 years as ""what the fuck the Celtics were insane to ever consider that"".  Which is why they're not."
"If you are actually trying to win the championship, trading Jaylen Brown for Damian Lillard shouldn't be a nonstarter."
"I like your takes.  Question: As a Celtics fan would you trade Jaylen Brown to Philadelphia for Ben Simmons, Tyrese Maxey and 1/2 unprotected 1sts?"
"I got an interesting 3 team trade.   Lillard to Boston  CJ to 76ers  Portland gets: Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, and Ben Simmons.   No picks or filler needed.  Portland can resign Powell and Kanter. Then go with a Simmons, Powell, Brown, RoCo, Nurkic starting lineup. Smart and Kanter on the bench.  The defense would be very good. Just no true #1 scoring option."
"Jaylen brown would be so good for this team if he wasn‚Äôt hurt. I mean so would Harden, Kyrie, FVV, and Zion. Then some big men, but idk."
They could get Ben Simmons+ or Jaylen Brown+.
If Dame really wants out and I'm Portland I'm looking at Jaylen Brown.
"Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, and picks. Who says no? Don‚Äôt @ me"
"Giannis, Luka, Jokic, Tatum, SGA (in order) with HM to Jaylen Brown, Trae, Zion, and Poku  !remindme 5 years"
"Please don't be a delusional Dubs fan spouting superlatives like this...  I'd take KD, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, OG Anunuby, Khris Middleton and Jaylen Brown immediately, as well as a healthy Kawhi and Lebron, but it's unlikely any of them are available. I'd also highly consider Nic Batum, Tobias Harris, Micheal Porter, and Harry Barnes  Wiggs is good enough and important to fill a specific role on the GSW, and he's vital to holding on to that max salary slot for trade purposes.  But he'll always be an overpaid #1 pick with significant limitations. The lack of ball handling and passing vision/BBIQ, poor FT shooting, poor rebounding, and generally bad shot selection all contribute to being an average player who has always been net-negative by BPM, RPM, RAPTOR, etc."
"Personally? Resign Smart and Fournier, trade TT, use the rest of the Hayward TPE on Larry Nance Jr, sign TJ McConnell on the taxpayer MLE. I'm comfortable starting Smart at the 1 for this season, the numbers on it are solid enough that I think it's worth exploring more in depth, but we need rotational pieces at the 1 and 4 more than anything. That leaves us with a twelve-man of:  PG: Smart/McConnell/Pritchard  SG: Jaylen/Langford  SF: Fournier/Nesmith  PF: Tatum/Nance  C: Horford/Williams/Brown  I think Fournier starts over Nance for spacing purposes, but there's a ton of lineup flexibility here, and there's opportunity for all of Pritchard/Nesmith/Langford to get regular minutes while not relying on them to do too much. Are we a championship-caliber team? I dunno, probably not unless someone takes another leap, but we're a solid playoff team with upside and flexibility going forward. Not to mention actual depth for the first time since 2019."
"Luka, Tatum, Zion, Giannis, Jaylen Brown"
"they're just talking about this finals lmao. I havent been less interested in a finals since I started watching the NBA. I think with the injuries to Kawhi, AD, Embiid, Harden, Kyrie, Jamal Murray and Jaylen Brown people just know it's not the 2 best teams in the finals"
"Some have even said he's like our version of Jaylen Brown or could be better, and I'm like no... Let's pump the brakes."
"I've seen people on the Warriors sub argue they should keep Wiggins over Jaylen Brown in a potential trade. Just absolute numbskulls on that sub. I enjoy it at times, but just delusional people all around."
I completely agree. I watch Jaylen Brown and he's...good? But I haven't seen him dominate or be the dude.
Probably from that infamous jaylen brown hater troll
"&gt;that Romeo Langford has higher potential than Jaylen Brown just one of the dumbest takes I've ever seen.  You talking about C's fan or r/NBA, because I guarantee you there's only a few handful of people I know, and some C's fan on our sub who actually think that, but I won't @ them lol. I still think Langford has good potential, but people hype him up so much. Just let the dude live and develop jeez."
"Simmons, Jaylen Brown, Westbrook, George, Kristaps  all feel like pretty clear #2 roles to me."
Jaylen Brown?
Middleton is legitimately a better player than some of the guys who are bigger names. Much rather have him on Milwaukee‚Äôs roster than Jaylen Brown.
"Different Era. 25ppg back then is as good if not better than 30ppg now, especially on the efficiency Dirk had. I mean, look at how many good, but not quite great guards put up ~25 ppg this season: Collin Sexton, Deaaron Fox, SGA, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young, Jaylen Brown, etc.  Those numbers were a rarity back in the day only the best of the best could reach"
Jaylen brown also has a YouTube channel mostly year old vlogs. I got one in my home page and it was above average but I don‚Äôt like vlogs
I‚Äôm not overrating. I just think Jaylen Brown is one of the best two-way guys in the league
I know this is all hindsight but even Brandon Ingram/jaylen brown haha
Okay but why the fuck would the C‚Äôs trade Jaylen Brown to the Sixers of all fucking people.   It doesn‚Äôt make sense we have Jaylen and Jayson that‚Äôs a young core we are meant to be building around them not blowing it up. Much less shipping them to rivals.  Stupidest trade I‚Äôve heard in a while.
Why the fuck would the C‚Äôs trade Jaylen Brown?
"3 picks from the kings are nice though. They are probably still floundering in the lottery after the trade. If you start them 2-3 years from now instead of next year, so that you can begin getting them after Ben inevitably asks out to play in LA/NYC (he‚Äôs exactly the kind of player to go there for insta hoe booty), those are 3 top 5 picks.  Given how shitty the kings are, they could probably get some pieces for that.  Maybe trade them+tobi for jaylen brown and Marcus smart?"
"2019 was a way worse roster than this one. The roster was Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Mason fucking Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Tatum, Myles Turner, Kemba, and Derrick White. Their best player at the time was Kemba. This team‚Äôs best player is Kevin Durant."
Jaylen Brown and Celtics. Gauranteed ring. John Wall and the Rockets. Easily a ring
"Let‚Äôs give some context.   They drafted Kuzma late, solid pick  They drafted BI with the second pick one before Jaylen Brown, mediocre pick and he wasn‚Äôt productive until the Lakers traded him to a team with a real development staff  They drafted Lonzo with the second pick, one ahead of Jayson Tatum, bad pick  Thomas Bryant, similar to Ingram was good when he went to a team with a real development staff, fine pick  Randle, was a bust until last year where he continued to fizzle out in the playoffs. Drafted ahead of LaVine. okay pick, before last year would‚Äôve been considered a terrible pick  Moe Wagner, dude fucking sucks, why are you  including him  THT, you guys hype this kid up wayyyy too much, he‚Äôs a good pick, definitely not as good as Lakers fans say he was  Zubac, I mean he‚Äôs fine, I guess."
Nice write up. I thought Jaylen Brown and Payton Prichard would be busts. I thought Semi Olejeye and Marcus Smart would be better than they turned out!
"Thybulle defense is special, and the special type that doesn‚Äôt come across too often. He‚Äôs not even the Tony Allen or Lu Dort type of guy that can clamp you up with physicality or laterally sliding his feet. Thybulle is a savant with length, instinct and timing, he can fit perfectly in about any defensive scheme, can clamp a lot of dribble penetration from fast guards like Kemba and Lavine with his length and timing.. struggles a little bit rn bc he‚Äôs not strong against bigger wings like Jaylen Brown or Jayson Tatum but that can easily be improved, another thing is his defense turns into live turnovers: steals, blocks that lead to transition offense is so valuable.."
"PG- Malcolm Brogdan SG- Collin Sexton SF-Jaylen Brown PF-Jae Crowder C-Dwight Howard Bench:  Antony Edward, Derrick Favors, Malik Beasley, Wendell Carter  Overall team ga wouldn't be bad, especially if Dwight was back in prime form."
"Ben Simmons for Jaylen brown, who says no"
"If we‚Äôre doing current NBA players, Hawks would look something like:  - PG: Malcolm Brogdon/Sexton/Lou Will (if you count Sexton as a PG) - SG: Jaylen Brown/Anthony Edwards/Malik Beasley - SF: Devin Vassell/Okoro/Okeke - PF: Jae Crowder/Derrick Favors/Aminu? (We‚Äôre lacking at PF) - C: Wendell Carter Jr/Dwight Howard  I can‚Äôt think of a third center but honestly not bad at all.  Edit: I‚Äôm leaving r/Dwight in there, formatting be damned"
"Yeah I think it‚Äôs much easier to build around and win with Brown and Tatum than it is with Trae and Collins. With another true star besides Trae I‚Äôll look at them in a different light.   And I don‚Äôt really know about The Celtics but them being frauds was never really something people said. We didn‚Äôt have Jaylen in the playoffs and he‚Äôs crucial to the teams success. Assuming that Brown is back next year and him and Tatum both take another leap I see the Celtics being an extremely talented team. Replacing Kemba with Horford is a great decision as well and the Celtics have the 5th youngest roster in the league. With more development to key players like Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, Robert Williams III, Grant Williams, and hopefully the addition of last year‚Äôs draft and stash Yam Madar the team should take a big step forward."
"Celtics management have gone to the eastern conference finals 3 times in the last 5 years, drafted Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and managed to build a roster one year of Kyrie, pre-injury Hayward, Brown, Tatum, and Horford with Smart, Rozier, Mook, etc. off the bench.   It‚Äôs new management anyway. I don‚Äôt think people would agree with you on that. The Celtics had been the most consistently good team in the NBA over the 2010‚Äôs."
"I know OP said 15, but I'm picking 12 because that's what we actually send to the Olympics/FIBA events.  Starters: Steph Klay KD LeBron AD  Bench: Kyrie Harden Butler Kawhi Tatum Draymond Bam  And since that's basically the 2016 Rio roster with a few minor changes, here's one for Paris 2024 just for fun.  Starters: Trae Booker Jaylen Brown Tatum AD  Bench: Ja Fox Spida Ingram Zion Bam ...and the wild card. I'm fairly certain that Ayton still has the option to apply for a US passport and play for Team USA (if he chooses). In that case he becomes the starter over an aging AD. Otherwise that last spot could go to MPJ if they need a stretch big to play next to Zion, Jarrett Allen for another rim protector, or maybe even John Collins."
This reminds me of the Jaylen Brown or a top pick in the 2018 draft.  Risky moves can either pay off or cost a GM‚Äôs job.
"Zion injured.  AD injured.  Isaac did not play in 2021 due to injury.  Collins can't play the 5.  JJJ barely played in 2021 due to injury and was not that good on his return.  Allen declined.  Turner was so bad in 2019, that Jaylen Brown was put in to play the 5 against France.  &amp;#x200B;  Don't know if you have a hate boner for Love, but everyone you mentioned is either hurt or also bad.  US simply doesn't have a lot of quality bigs."
"So many dudes opted out or are injured.   Reading through [this list](https://www.usab.com/news-events/news/2021/03/m-oly-finalists.aspx) doesn't seem like there a ton of better options.   Allen would have been nice but just about every elite two-way wing opted out or is hurt. LeBron, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown, etc."
"His nickname is literally ""the Yank"". He was never considered to be ""part of the country"". He doesn't live here, he has an American accent, and he would rather go to Wimbledon than play for Australia.  Jaylen Brown now has a better Australian following.  None of this gets his citizenship revoked, we're just happy for him to fuck off voluntarily."
"We're talking about *currently*, not a few years ago.  He doesn't even crack the top 10.  Most recent rankings:  1. LaMelo Ball, Charlotte Hornets  2. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors  3. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers  4. Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets  5. Russell Westbrook, Washington Wizards  6. Luka Donƒçiƒá, Dallas Mavericks  7. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks  8. Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks  9. Steven Adams, New Orleans Pelicans  10. Jaylen Brown, Boston Celtics  He's behind *Jaylen fucking Brown*."
"We‚Äôll trade you one jaylen brown. Thank you! No trade backsies!  Edit: backsies, not backsides"
"big men have have always gone high in the draft, so I would not extrapolate too much from that, just look at the 2018 draft where both Ayton &amp; Bagley went ahead of Luka Doncic.  I do think we're seeing a new era of more skilled bigs, which makes sense as the game continues to evolve into a more 5 out style game with tons of emphasis on shooting &amp; creation.  But bigs with the Jokic/Embiid/KAT skillset are super, duper rare and will continue to be just because there's fewer giants in the world than there are guard/wing body-types.  Think about who the 10th best wing (anyone 6'5""-6'8"") is the the NBA vs. the 10th best big-man, someone like Jaylen Brown/Jimmy Butler (this is off the top of my head, don't nit-pick too much) has so much more impact than the 10th best big (someone like Clint Capela or Sabonis), and if you looked went further the supply of wings stays deep &amp; the pool of bigs dries up quickly."
"He's mean, he's green, and he smells like aubergines, Jaylen Brown üëèüëè Jaylen Brown..."
"We did send a younger squad in Mitchell, Tatum, Middleton, Jaylen Brown, etc. at the FIBA and that didn't work out to well"
Where‚Äôs Jaylen Brown?
"I mean, he‚Äôs certain no Jaylen Brown"
"How is Klay at 70% one of the best defenders in the league lol. That would definitely not work out imo. 2 undersized/defensive-liability point guards as your backcourt...At least one of them is going to get picked apart on defense. Imagine Curry trying to defend Zach Lavine, Jaylen Brown, Devin Booker, etc lmao yeah right"
"Ah yes, our talented roster of Jaylen Brown, hobbled Kemba Walker and...who?"
Jaylen Brown isn't quite the shooter Seth Curry is but yeah thats a decent comparison. If Jaylen had Seth Curry level shooting though I think he'd be a superstar that's at least on Tatum's level.
"This deal would be arguably be more than what we got in that deal from the Nets, assuming we are considering Dame equal to Pierce, KG, and Jason Terry, which I think is fair. It was 4 picks (went on to be James Young, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Colin Sexton) along with Kris Humphries, Gerald Wallace, MarShon Brooks (waived), and Keith Bogans (refused to come to Boston) Wiseman and Wiggins are significantly better than Humphries and Wallace."
Eh I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs even average. EPM doesn‚Äôt always live up to the eye test. Seth Curry is above avg defender while Tatum is not. Jaylen brown is same defense as Luka. Drummond has like a 2.0 epm. Demar is one of the worst defenders in the league. PJ Tuckers defense is quite a bit worse than Trae Young. All these statements are according to epm
"That‚Äôs fine, as long as you understand that a players development is heavily affected by the situations they are in. And Tatums defense is average. Jaylen Brown plays strong defense, Tatum does not. In fact, Jaylen Brown may very well wind up the better player overall."
Jaylen Marselles Brown
Jaylen Brown all nba. Ja Morant all star.
Jaylen Brown...
De'Aaron Fox  De'Andre Hunter  Jaylen Brown
Jrue Holiday  Klay Thompson  Jaylen Brown   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Boban Marjanovic
"Schroder, Richardson, and Horford will be better than Kemba, Fournier, and Thompson.   Plus a full season of healthy Jayson Tatum that's not affected by COVID and full season of Jaylen Brown who is not playing through knee tendinitis."
"Also a Celtics fan who thinks we will be better (not top 2 though). NBA is a star driven league, and our star player hasn‚Äôt hit his peak yet. I just think we‚Äôll get better every year until he does.  Also, Jaylen Brown has consistently improved every year as well, so there‚Äôs always a chance we‚Äôll see more from him as well (but he‚Äôs closer to his ceiling than Tatum for sure)."
The game is just different today than even ten years ago. This past year Buddy Hield made more 3s than Ray Allen ever did in his best year. Tatum is a lock to take the #1 spot from Pierce. Smart may end up #2 and Jaylen Brown will be close behind.
"Kid honestly sounds like Jaylen Brown, hopefully he‚Äôll actually be good tho"
"Beal, booker, maybe even dame, Mitchell, jaylen brown, Simmons.  But would they have the balls instead of passing out to a shooter, that's another question"
"Also saying we would throw everything for bam, weird how I have never seen that mentioned on the celtics sub or even twitter lmao, jaylen brown and tatum are our stars and I'd safely say 99% fans are happy with not trading them away for a player like Bam"
"Besides the obvious choice of Mickael Pietrus (no explanation needed), Jaylen Brown is my favorite player.   He‚Äôs a really interesting guy off the court and I really like how he‚Äôs trying to use his status as a professional athlete to get involved in technology and make the world a better place.  On the court, he‚Äôs so fun to watch. Super athletic with some of the nicest layups I‚Äôve seen in a long time. He‚Äôs a good defender and has worked really hard to improve so much over his career already"
You will never have skin in this game with that CP3 contract lmaooo. I‚Äôll make sure to tell Adam Silver that those rings don‚Äôt count since u/gastricacid wasn‚Äôt alive yet (not). Jaylen Brown &gt; Book
Jaylen Brown will have a better career than Tatum. Tatum is not a superstar.
2011 Rondo was disgustingggg. Very much extended the big 3s values. Which led to Brooklyn sending a massive package for Pierce and KG‚Ä¶. Which led to Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. I love sports.
"Jaylen Brown just put up 25ppg and is an all-star at 24. He wouldn't be the centerpiece in the Beal scenario.  For reference, Miami gave up Josh Richardson to get Jimmy Butler."
Kanter would have a solid team  **G:** Russell Westbrook  **G:** Dame Lillard   **F:** Jaylen Brown  **F:** Jayson Tatum  **C:** Kevin Durant  **Bench:** Marcus Smart / CJ McCollum / Carmelo Anthony / Serge Ibaka / Kristaps Porzingis / Jusuf Nurkic
"Yeah, I got you. Maybe that‚Äôs what‚Äôs getting me. Raptors draft these guys and fans say they‚Äôre always the next Kawhi. OG Anunoby was/is supposed to be the next Kawhi. Scottie Barnes is supposed to be the next Kawhi. It seems like a cop out to suggest any NBA prospect with length and an unpolished offensive game is going to be Kawhi Leonard.  Before the draft analysts suggested if all went well for Kuminga he could have a game similar to Jaylen Brown and if they don‚Äôt go super well, Al Farouq Aminu. That tracks for me. Nothing in his game says Kawhi Leonard and no one was making that comparison until GSW drafted him."
Not a superstar but Marc Gasol was All NBA 2nd team and 1st team in that span  It wouldn't be a stretch to say he was a fringe top 15 player  You don't think those Grizzlies plus Bradley Beal or even Jaylen Brown can win it?
"This feels so much like the Jaylen Brown extension. Fairly valued if Rob kinda just slightly improves, but huge potential to be an underpay"
Im old enough to remember people clowning the Jaylen Brown contract this same way.
FCHWPO is Jaylen Brown. He's up around 1.8 million.
"Agree that a trade would be the most likely option. And Tommy Shepard (Wizards GM) seems to have a good read on Beal and what he wants. So if Beal is going to walk, the Wizards likely deal him at the deadline. If that‚Äôs the case, GS or Philly probably have the most assets to offer in return unless the Celtics offer Jaylen Brown."
"Interesting, Boston literally had multiple marches for BLM and while it isn‚Äôt the most racism free city, Jaylen and others rave about it. And I‚Äôm a brown dude, so not the same thing, but Boston isn‚Äôt anywhere near as racist as the south or Midwest."
Why not just trade for him and use the bird rights to go over the cap and sign him to the max?   Doing a sign and trade seems pointless because Jaylen Brown would be the centrepiece in either scenario.
"That‚Äôs a lot of words without naming at least one other team you‚Äôre thinking of.   Simmons, Thybulle/Maxey, 4 firsts, 3 pick swaps. That‚Äôs the best offer the Sixers have and I don‚Äôt see any other team putting together a package that comes close to that type of return unless you start including the teams stockpiling assets in the lottery.   I mean I guess you could start putting together trade packages that blow up young cores like the Celtics sending out Jaylen Brown or GSW going all in on a backcourt of Dame and Steph."
I don‚Äôt necessarily agree with OP but I‚Äôll see if I can name 30 (not in order obviously).   Ad/ Lebron/ Harden/ Curry/ KD/ Jokic/ JoJo/ Kawhi/ Dame/ Jimmy/ PG13/ Giannis/ Luka/ Kyrie/ Tatum/ Middleton/ KAT/ Lavine/ Mitchell/ Dbook/ Ingram/ Zion/ Lowry/ Trae/ Gobert/ Fox.    That‚Äôs 26 I‚Äôd for sure take then we gotta debate between Jaylen brown/ Bam/ CP3/ Siakam/ Derozan/ Vucevic/ Jrue/ Collins/ Sabonis/ Ja/ Murray
Jaylen Brown man. He just clamped him. His man to man defence is insane.
"Last season's garbage time Celtics consisting of Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, and Semi Ojeleye. They'll win one game against the regular Celtics because Jayson Tatum gets COVID and Jaylen Brown injures his hand, leaving Marcus Smart as our only offensive option. He shoots 50 threes, hitting only 25% of them."
"Idk Lavine, Ja Morant, Bam, LaMelo, Anthony Edwards, Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Mitchell, Jamal Murray, SGA, KAT,"
It‚Äôs honestly an interesting timeline to see you progress from strictly a Jaylen Brown hate troll all the way to a full on Celtics hate troll
If only they could've had Jaylen Brown
LeBron had the same shot kobe made here but as a Laker vs Jaylen Brown a while back.
2.5M/year less than Jaylen Brown.  Last season:  25/6/3 - Jaylen  20/4/4 - Terry  And both are good defenders so idk it's probably about market.
Celtics:  PG: Malcolm Brogdon (23rd pick in 2016)  SG: Jaylen Brown (3rd pick in 2016)  SF: Jayson Tatum (3rd pick in 2017)  PF: Pascal Siakam (16th pick in 2016)  C: Mitchell Robinson (27th pick in 2018)
Celtics did with the corpse of Kemba and without Jaylen Brown
Yeah these are the guys who could make it in the weaker east.  Jaylen brown too
"Not over Trae, Jrue, Lowry, and/or Jaylen Brown."
"He‚Äôd have to beat out Lavine, Trae, Jrue, Jaylen Brown, Lowry, Simmons, and now Lonzo and Derozan for one of the last two guard spots in the East. I dont see Smart pulling that off."
"&gt; but I don't see the point of talking up Danny's acumen if he wasn't really able to accrue those benefits from the pick.  Because it shows he's a good evaluator of talent?   In 5 consecutive years, he drafted Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Robert Williams.   All 5 of those guys are going to be making at least 15 mill per year starting next year and are all Top 100 players in the league."
"He definitely wasn‚Äôt the best drafter, but he did make one of the best picks of the last decade with Jaylen Brown in 2016."
"Christ that‚Äôs unfairly low.   Jaylen Brown at age 24 was just better than pretty much every older star in this league was at 24 besides Lebron/KD.   Jaylen has 2-3 more years before a typical player reaches their prime, and he‚Äôs improved by leaps and bounds every season.    Jaylen has no ceiling."
"Wouldn't necessarily say both are good contracts, compared to their teammates Jaylen Brown and OG who I'd consider being on extremely good contracts."
Brandon Ingram and Jaylen Brown/Ben Simmons
"You're not wrong. But if you've seen Fultz driving to the rim or running a set through himself, im sure you'll know what I mean.  They both just move in a way that's different from everyone else.  The opposite of really fluid players like PG and Jaylen Brown.  Not saying it makes Fultz as good as anyone else we are talking about but im sure someone gets what I mean."
"- Jayson Tatum  - Jaylen Brown  - Marcus Smart  - Robert Williams  - Payton Pritchard  - Aaron Nesmith  - Dennis Schroder  - Romeo Langford  Al would be nice to keep, but if he's taken that means we get off of his contract. Richardson isn't a long-term player for us. The rest of the young guys can go."
"Not enough fighting, so... Power Rankings:    1. New Orleans Pelicans - Luka Doncic LeBron James    2. Portland Trail Blazers - Kawhi Leonard Stephen Curry    3.

"Dame is a decent rapper and has a couple songs with big artists, Oladipo has a great voice and some rnb songs and i know Jaylen Brown used to make beats but i dont think he takes it too seriously"
"I'm excited for the Kings this season, but you are big cappin about Brown. Jaylen cooks Fox and that's facts."
"simmons for a FRP and brogdon was rumored as an offer philly turned down. If Portland doesnt want Brogdon, flip him for a FRP. Philly can give 4 FRPs of their own 3 pick swaps like the Harden Nets package, + Thybulle + Maxey as young players. Thats 6 FRPs , 3 pick swaps, + Mayxey + Thybulle, their the only team with the incentive to give the farm like the nets did with Harden to compete now, and I bet you they wouldn't have to give ALL of that probably minus 3-4 things.  Pelicans are the only ones who could top or the celtics around a farm + Jaylen Brown package but it seems like they don't want to trade away Brown."
Jaylen Brown is a bit of a surprise. The others are about as expected.
"Cool and Jaylen Brown made it to a conference final more recently than Harden has. I think very few non-Suns fans would disagree that Harden would‚Äôve given you a better chance of winning than Booker did despite Booker going further in the postseason recently - it‚Äôs a team game and injuries happen.  I‚Äôm not saying you should regret not trading Book for Harden. I wouldn‚Äôt if I were a Suns fan. But if you don‚Äôt regret it, you probably shouldn‚Äôt be claiming other teams do."
No way Boston trades Jaylen Brown for 31-year-old Dame.
Definitely jaylen brown unless he goes MJ on us
"In the style of Stephen Biko, Jaylen appears Brown (to me)."
I would like to hear what Jaylen Brown thinks of this subject.
"Are you actually brain dead? I said the duo of Tatum and Brown were the most efficient in the NBA. I'll break it down even simpler so someone of your IQ can understand it. When Jaylen and Jayson play together, at the same time, in the same line-up, they are one of the most efficient duos in the NBA. If you can't understand that then I don't know what you're doing in the NBA subreddit.  Huh even with that racism Jaylen doesn't want to leave. What does that say about New Orleans if every player wants to get out of dodge?"
"Tatum and brown are, individually, very talented. I don‚Äôt recall insinuating otherwise. They are two very good players who will never win a championship until they are split. BI/Zion: same.   But don‚Äôt listen to me, time will hammer that point home. Keep running it back with a drawer full of Mismatched socks.   You are correct that New Orleans is known for violence and public drinking. That is accurate.   Boston is known for championships and overt racism. After the next couple of seasons, at least you guys will still have the racism.  https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/celtics-jaylen-brown-delivers-powerful-statement-systemic-racism?amp"
"The Nets faced a Celtics team without Jaylen Brown, and were on track to beating a Bucks team without Donte Divincenzo"
"Jaylen Brown wasn't better than Siakam in 2019 bro. In 2021 I agree with you, but in 2020 Siakam had a much better regular season (2nd team all nba) though for sure Brown was better in the bubble/playoffs. But Brown was not  better in the 2019 playoffs or regular season. Jaylen Brown would've been only 22 and had a worse 3 point shot back then and wasn't the player he is now. Mind you Siakam dropped 32 on 14-17 shooting and 26 in those finals to help win the series. Brown was still a 13 ppg scorer Vs Siakam being a 17ppg guy and 19ppg in 2019 playoffs."
Considering Jaylen Brown
Are you comparing Jaylen Brown(stud) with Marcus Smart?
Jaylen Brown didn‚Äôt have an agent as a rookie. Don‚Äôt know about now.
Jaylen brown never had an agent But got one for his extension
Jaylen Brown represented himself for his first contract I believe. Not sure if he has an agent now or not.
Jaylen Brown or Devin Booker?
"Delusional Raptor fans have themselves convince Siakam is better than this man. Give Kawhi Jaylen Brown and they'd have finished off the Sixers, Bucks, and Warriors in quicker fashion."
"If there is one positive part of Kyrie's legacy in Boston, it's that Jaylen Brown watched him handle the ball said to himself ""well if this idiot can do it...""   BTW, I don't care what anyone says, the banner whites are tight"
"Jaylen Brown is going to get a LOT of NBA FO fired, because a lot of GMs are going to look at athletic freaks with no skill like JB was and convince themselves ‚Äúif Jaylen Brown could develop skill around elite athleticism, I‚Äôm sure this kid could too‚Äù not realising JB is the exception, not the rule."
It‚Äôs cute how that was the same season as Jaylen Brown and everyone acted like Hield was a great signing and Jaylen was a disaster.    Those threads are hilarious in retrospect
"Please, if you can't even defend him vs Jaylen Brown, then you had no argument against me that you truly believed in."
"Ok can people stop saying Siakam is good enough for a 2nd option. He's not on that level of AD, Paul George, Chris Paul, Kyrie, Klay, Middleton or even Jaylen Brown, which are all ideal 2nd options. Kawhi carried that Raptors team."
"I know this ain‚Äôt popular but I‚Äôd take Ingram over Brown. Yes I know Brown‚Äôs D is much better. I just think Ingram‚Äôs offensive upside is on another Level from Jaylen.   Brown is amazing too, don‚Äôt kill me Celtic fans. Just an opinion."
Luka-Bradley Beal-Jaylen Brown-Jayson Tatum-Joel Embiid with RJ Barrett-Otto Porter- and Enes Kanter off the bench.
What about Jaylen Brown
"Jaylen Brown was a massive reach and people made fun of the Celtics at the time, but it clearly turned out okay."
"I think based on their current skillset and what they‚Äôve showed so far, it‚Äôs fair to say that Tatum has a higher offensive ceiling. I just have a hard time ignoring the insane growth that Brown has showed since he entered the league. It didn‚Äôt seem like many people expected much out of Jaylen offensively at all, so his meteoric rise the past couple years really makes me believe his potential on offense is a lot higher than people think.  My comparison is not a knock on Tatum, I‚Äôm a huge Cs fan and have loved to see how he has improved since we drafted him. I think he has the potential to be a Hall of Famer. But it seems like he gets all the love and attention from the National and local media, and Jaylen has taken a backseat. I‚Äôm not saying the attention isn‚Äôt well deserved, but people are forgetting, or have never realized, how good Jaylen can actually be"
"Zion is definitely better than Jaylen Brown and Jimmy Butler.  Ingram is ranked too low, while Ja is ranked too high."
"Comparing their age 20 seasons Zion is scoring 10 more ppg on better efficiency than Tatum. Put Zion on a team with Kyrie, Hayward, non-washed Al Horford and Jaylen Brown and he would make the playoffs too. There are some arguments for Tatum over Zion but this isn‚Äôt one."
Lmao. Like the Boston was getting there solely on the back of Tatum. What is it with idiots in here conflating team performance and Individual performance?  Give Zion Jaylen Brown and Hayward and stick him in the east he will make the playoffs too. N
"Jaylen Brown &gt; Jayson Tatum.  This sub and the NBA community has had a hard-on for Tatum for years. He was a more heralded recruit, is the subject of the infamous Fultz disaster for the 76ers, was better as a rookie when he was super young for his class, etc etc.  Since then Tatum has gotten a lot better but hasn't gotten better at nearly the same rate as Brown. Brown has been more efficient, just as good an outside shooter if not better, and in my opinion has a much higher ceiling as a defender because of his lateral quickness and strength."
"Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Khris Middleton, Jaylen Brown"
He meant Jaylen Brown lol but took me a second too
"Before we start just naming players, let‚Äôs think about what kind of skillset we‚Äôre looking for. Since this team is made up of clones, both teams will be switching everything on defense, and there won‚Äôt really be any matchup hunting. Because of this, wouldn‚Äôt expect to see very many ball screens. Instead, I‚Äôd be looking for a versatile, switchable defender with a good handle, a good isolation scoring game, and solid spacing. Passing wouldn‚Äôt need to be elite, but the ability to make basic reads (drive and kick, find the open man, etc.) would be preferred, and obviously better passing is a bonus.   I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs the WORST player (he‚Äôs very good) who would be able to do it but I would be fascinated to watch a team of 5 Scottie Pippens. Obviously the defense and passing are there, and although his career 3pt% is low, his 3pt volume and efficiency were both higher in the mid 90s and I think he could improve on his 3pt shooting if he were to devote as much time and effort to it as players do today.   People in this thread have mentioned Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton, and Paul George, who could all work pretty well I think. As a Spurs fan, I‚Äôm hoping that Keldon Johnson can develop into the kind of player who would be able to do this, but he‚Äôs obviously young and still developing, so we don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôll look like in 5 years. Also, at 6‚Äô5‚Äù, he might just be too small to defend bigger players, even with his famous ‚ÄúBig Body.‚Äù   P.S. Another interesting question is who‚Äôs the BEST player who WOULDN‚ÄôT succeed on a team of clones of himself. I‚Äôd be looking for players who lack defensive versatility (Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Trae Young) or lack ball handling and isolation scoring ability (Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert). All of that said, it‚Äôs hard for me to say for sure that these clone teams wouldn‚Äôt still win, given the immense amount of talent present."
"Hell play mainly G league this year playing 1-3 while being either primary or 2ndry ball handler. Hopefully towards end of season we bring him into the main team off the bench but no rush.    He's flashed the skills to play 1-3 so far although looking like a 2 so far given his size.   Actually has decent length, big hands and with his young age I'm hoping he grows a couple inches to put him in line length wise with Jaylen Brown.    Needs to add some strength and weight and he'll have time to do that with us.    He's put a clock on Lonnie to either step up or leave so let's see if he actually taps into some of the potential he's shown"
Are you still salty that Jaylen brown fucked your mom and didn‚Äôt call her back?
"luka doncic, jrue holiday, jaylen brown, brandon ingram, anthony edwards, deandre ayton, SGA"
Jaylen Brown &gt; Devin Booker
Jaylen Brown &gt; Jayson Tatum
"Decent mental exercise.   1st look at who they have to beat.   They're gonna face elite LONG BOIS. Likes of Giannis, KD, AD. Bigs like Jokic, Embiid. long wings like Kawhi.   Also elite guards like Curry, Harden, Irving, Jrue, Trae, Booker, CP3, et al.    So I'd say they'll need to be 6'6 with long wingspan but ideally 6'7 to 6'9 and mobile.    They'll need to have good to elite help defence and at least above average on ball defence.    Should be a 35+% 3pt shooter. Need to be an established ball handler so ideally primary or 2ndry ball handler for their team.    Realistically then we're looking at a wing.   I'd say **Jaylen Brown** would be interesting esp if continues to develop. 6'6 with a 7ft wingspan (according to Google)   Likes of Middleton, Tatum etc"
"I remember arguing with some guy at the beginning of last season that Timelord should be starting, and the other dude was ADAMANT that ""if we was that good, he would be staring already"". Lol. Some people really are incapable of actually seeing and understanding what a winning basketball player looks like.  Reminds me of how I ranted for years that Kemba was overrated garbage and only recently did people wake the fuck up.  My latest hot take that absolutely nobody is on board with: Tatum is overrated as hell. Jaylen Brown was actually better than him overall last year. I have a feeling that this prediction will be more of a slow burn where the statheads will agree with me for a long time before everyone else agrees that Tatum is basically just Melo 2.0 - inefficient chucker that will make the all-star game for years but never be on a championship winning team unless he gets carried because his defense, passing, and efficiency are all too meh to make him a real star despite him eating up most of your cap space."
"No, a winning player is someone who, when they're injured or unavailable, their team performs objectively worse and when missing other key players, the winning percentage doesn't drop significantly (it's always expected that it will drop when you lose key players but to what degree?). Name a Kyrie team where that was true. You don't have to win NBA championships to be a winning player. Chris Paul is a winning player for example. DeAndre Ayton is a winning player. Jaylen Brown. Donovan Mitchell. There are plenty of them in the league. Kyrie isn't one of them.  Basketball is like the one team sport outside of being a QB where a truly exceptional player is capable of determining the outcome by themselves. This sub often acts like Kyrie is amazing and is one of those exceptional players, when he really isn't.  Like I said, it's a crazy take no one agrees with. But it's my take so I posted to answer the question."
"I really hope Jaylen Brown isnt. I could see it with him, but I feel like if you play for the Celtics, you gonna be ok. I think we should factor franchise into consideration as well. Some of these franchises like the Knicks/Celtics/Lakers/Bulls sort of make you remember certain players"
"Got a real one. RJ Barrett &gt; Jaylen Brown  Not only do I believe it but it genuinely fits the thread or else I never would have said it anywhere because I don't like to annoy people for no reason. I do think in time RJ's talent will make it a less crazy opinion, but I don't think it will ever be popular even if that does pan out."
Jaylen Brown &gt; Bradley Beal
"Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Both good players and on stable teams. Good enough to be All-stars for a stretch, but they don't really generate headlines that casual fans would remember."
"Yes and that's pretty much when it started in the NBA. I think it was just him doing it at that point. He also literally said he's trying to set an example for the young players.    Then like a season later, Jaylen Brown comes in with even shorter shorts."
"Derrick Rose, Bradley Beal (unless he makes some very strong playoff runs), KAT, Kemba Walker, Gordon Hayward, Jaylen Brown.  And totally agree, Carmelo reminiscent of Dantley and Alex English, albeit with slightly larger fanbase."
"I'm a massive Jaylen fan, like he's my favorite player by far, but even i can't agree with this. I thought at times this could possibly be true, especially this last year while Jaylen was balling. But Tatum is getting really good defensively and both are pretty even for playmaking. I still give Tatum the edge because he has a higher offensive ceiling, but I agree that it's much closer than anyone, including most Celtics fans, realize.  In my mind, Brown is just as untradable (especially under current nonmax contract). Every time his name is brought up for trading it makes me sick to my stomach."
"Jaylen Brown &gt; Jayson Tatum  Jaylen has gotten better every single year he‚Äôs been in the league. His defensive impact is huge, and the strides he‚Äôs made offensively since his rookie year have been absurd. It seems like it‚Äôs widely accepted that Tatum is the more valuable piece, but I think the career progression so far matched with his supreme leadership makes Jaylen one of the most valuable players in the league right now"
"This is commented a lot but I don't think it's true.  Many NBA players (both active and retired) gave him props:  * [NBA PLAYERS REACT TO GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO WINNING FINALS MVP 2021 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9yOhfBKHwM) * [NBA PLAYERS REACT TO MILWAUKEE BUCKS WINNING NBA CHAMPIONSHIP 2021 | GIANNIS REACTIONS (LeBron etc) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqGBut87sqw)  Some examples from these two videos: Lebron, Jaylen Brown, CJ, Draymond Green, Pau Gasol, Andre Iguodala, Miles Bridges, Christian Wood, Larry Nance Jr, Magic, Isiah Thomas, Donovan Mitchell, Jordan Clarkson, Ja Morant, Dejounte Murray, Covington, McGee, Haliburton, Gobert, and others."
I hate how much I like Jaylen Brown.
"Jaylen Brown has been the same aspiring superstar for the last 4 seasons. If you're a Superstar with true superstar in Tatum you don't go .500. Jaylen Brown is 25 in a month. Superstars already at 25 or under better than Brown: Doncic, Tatum, Mitchell, Murray, Zion, Booker, Young,  Morant, Adebayo.  Then add in Ball and Alexander who are still young up and coming.  Jaylen Brown is not NBA young anymore."
"That is all good but you got to improve as a wannabe superstar. Jaylen Brown has been a wannabe superstar for 4 seasons now and Celtics haven't made the Finals since the Big 3. Lost to the Heat because Butler is a good player, but you have Tatum and Brown. Next year you go .500, you don't go .500 with two superstars.   The Jaylen says all the right things but doesn't make the leap  as a player."
"He is currently my favorite player in the entire league. Love his attitude, his ability to communicate his feelings and thought process, and most of all how he seems like just a genuinely great person.  My list goes:  1. Matisse Thybulle  2. Jaylen Brown  3. Lebron James  4. Larry Nance Jr.  5. Jamal Murray"
"Nets aren't unbeatable even if healthy. Their defense was crap and their loss of Jeff Green only made it worse.  People use a useless stat of an irrelevant sample size to defend this point.  I know they were 3rd in DRtg in the playoffs. But that stat is meaningless. In the regular season DRtg is useful because everyone plays the same teams (not the same number of times but it roughly balances out).  In the playoffs which offenses you play are going to completely skew your DRtg.  So in round 1 the Rockets played the Celtics who had a 114.0 ORtg in the regular season (with Jaylen playing 60 games). In the playoffs against Brooklyn they had a 118.3 ORtg with no Jaylen.   In round 2 the Bucks struggled offensively, but they also only shot 30% from deep as a team, after shooting 39% in the regular season. Studies have shown opponent 3PT% is more luck than anything else.  If you just normalise 3PT% then Milwaukee would have had 114.3 ORtg in round 2 against Brooklyn, which is only slightly worse than their regular season 117.2 ORtg. But beyond that part of the reason Milwaukee struggled offensively was because Brooklyn wasn't playing Kyrie and Harden at the same time, and used lineups with more defensive talent.  So all in all :  They were a crap defense in the regular season (23rd in the league), they were crap defensively against Boston (who outperformed their regular season ORtg despite slightly unlucky shooting and missing fringe All-Star Jaylen Brown) and were mostly just very lucky defensively against Milwaukee (only slightly held them down offensively, in part thanks to the Kyrie/Harden injuries forcing better defenders on the floor).  So I still don't see any evidence whatsoever that Brooklyn's defense can even be league average, and there's literally no precedent for a team that bad defensively to win a title, no matter how good they are offensively.  I'd pick Milwaukee to beat them in a rematch even at full health."
Just something to add about the part that jb doesn‚Äôt get defended as hard because Tatum is playing. While that‚Äôs true it‚Äôs also true that Tatum is the number 1 option so he gets to control the flow of the game and make all the plays for himself. Jaylen brown averaged over 30 ppg on 50.6 fg% and 39.7 3p% in the 7 games tatum was out. So he‚Äôs not better because Tatum draws all the defense. Because he‚Äôs a much better player when Tatum is not in the game at all.  Brown has a better fg percentage and a better 3p% and he only takes 1 less shot per game.  Take away free throws and they are both top ten scorers in the league. Brown is more consistent and his averages are more on par with his day to day performance.  Before the last 2 months of the regular season I would have said brown was the better of the two Tatum is just flashier. However tatum has shown that he has that next level of game that only a handful of people that have ever played in the nba possess. That end of last season put Tatum from tier 2 to tier one. Jaylen brown is like Paul pierce. Tatum when he turns it on is like prime Carmelo with an alpha mentality and a much better shot there‚Äôs no player comparison available. He‚Äôs a 1 of 1. Not to mention Tatum got the same amount of 5 point games this season Carmelo had in his entire career.
Theres no way the Celtics have the best trade package for anything or anyone without including Jaylen Brown. Not that y‚Äôall would or should tho but their assets aren‚Äôt especially valuable
I hope to God MPJ doesn't become Jaylen Brown. Says everything how you're supposed to say it but no idea how to walk the talk.
Jaylen Brown
I guess that depends on your definition of invalidate. They‚Äôre obviously technically NBA champions. Nobody is trying to head to Wisconsin and physically take the Larry O‚ÄôBrien away from them. But some of the takes I‚Äôve seen are ridiculous. I‚Äôve seen people say it‚Äôs one of the best championship runs of all time. Like what?   Imo it‚Äôs just common sense that they‚Äôre the weakest champions in the all of the 2000‚Äôs. I wasn‚Äôt putting much stock in the Jaylen Brown injury because I still believe the Bucks would have won had he played. So yeah I agree with your overall point that the West suffered the most. Imo they wouldn‚Äôt have a shot at all against Lakers or Clippers and it‚Äôs split 50/50 with the Nuggets. And then obviously the Nets.
"None of my reply had anything to do with your flair, I am a full grown adult. I am just providing context.  I think we all also agree that there was a degree of luck in the Bucks finals run - I‚Äôm just not going to invalidate the run because of injury like other people on this sub. They beat who they played and that‚Äôs all they can do. They could only play 1 team from the West, and the West is really where injuries decimated teams. Coincidentally, they played a very good and healthy Suns team and handled them. Would they have beaten the Lakers, Clippers, or Nuggets? Maybe not. Would they have beaten the Celtics if they had Jaylen Brown? In 6 games, max. Was Embiid 100%? No, but he still managed to put up 30+ on multiple occasions against the Hawks."
"You skipped right over the real mistake‚Äî kawhi was going to leave no matter what, but they shouldn‚Äôt have traded for Derozan.  And I love Derozan, but if you‚Äôre trading Kawhi freaking Leonard, you need multiple legit high upside, already rock solid young players. You need Jaylen Brown and lots of picks. You need Ben Simmons. You can‚Äôt just settle for demar Derozan."
Report: Jaylen Brown is unhappy as he requested that Jokic have a black baby as the next child he brings into the world. May be considering a trade.
Star: Jaylen Brown  Emerging star: DeAndre Ayton  Unproven Youngster: Precious Achiuwa
Siakam has already proven he can be a #2 option on a championship level team. Jaylen Brown hasn‚Äôt been to the finals yet. Siakam has weaknesses but not the same depth as Simmons. Simmons is a better passer and defender than Siakam though. Siakam‚Äôs peak is all-star starter and 2nd team all-nba. If that is what he is going to top out at that‚Äôs a fair assessment. But we have to acknowledge Jaylen Brown hasn‚Äôt reached that level yet.
Sorry Wolves fans.  Ya'll don't deserve it.  I got to check out a game over there when Jaylen Brown dropped on his head.  That entire game and during ya'll were classy great fans.
I think siakam has become a bit underrated. Brown is more valuable because of upward growth but siakam still has an edge right now. I also think Simmons has an argument over jaylen even tho jaylen is a vastly superior trade asset and will likely have a much better career than simmons.
"Huge jaylen brown fan but up until this past season he didn‚Äôt have the 1 on 1 skill set to create for himself at an elite level. More to the game than just counting stats. Both are phenomenal , Tatum was and is the clear no. 1 option tho"
Jaylen Brown was literally just as good
"I don‚Äôt know why Tatum gets all the credit for that team Jaylen Brown had the exact same stats as Tatum with one less assist and you can argue Horford was just as important as both of them with Rozier, Morris, and Smart all playing well too"
I think Brad Stevens trying to rap is what made Jaylen Brown tell the front office that it was important to him that the next coach was black
Brad Steven's rap was pretty good too. Heard it was go enough to make Jaylen Brown ask to upgrade Steven's into the GM role
"Danny Ainge built a team with Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford, Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes, Daniel Theis, and Robert Williams.  At some point the GM can only do so much. Danny Ainge did everything in his power to start a dynasty, it just didn't work out for non-front office reasons."
"I love comments like this because they became the face of the argument against what things Jaylen Brown is saying.   The one black or person that gives their ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm black and I disagree‚Äù always becomes the barometer for white people (and others who disagree) to use against the argument being made. See, look, this minority agrees with us, what‚Äôs wrong with you?"
"Why would they need to do the opposite? If Jaylen Brown had said we need this specific Black coach, no one would bat an eye. The fact that he went up and said no matter what the coach needs to be black is just stupid"
Yeah this was really quite selfish of Jaylen Brown. Immediately undercuts his coach just to make himself appear better.
And right after Jaylen Brown became the first African-American player for the Celtics too. We're living in historic times.
Jaylen Brown
"If we talk about poverty and suffering, welfare should be provided to poor people no matter their race.  In terms of median household income - I really doubt racism is so bad that I would find many people that would pay 75% more just to have work done by white person instead of black one. If Jaylen Brown would told Celtics ownership to financially support underprivileged kids with access to better education then it would be less controversial and more efficient than hiring black coach with treating race as a factor in hiring. I don't really think black person considered for HC job would suffer without that specific job.  I'm gonna be honest - if NBA would ask teams to have at least one Chinese player in roster for marketing reasons and I would see Guo Haowen in OKC, I would be less sure if he is talented enough than if I would see Haowen joining NBA normally. NBA would be basically strenghtening my ""there is not many good enough Chinese basketball players"" view with making Chinese nationality as factor and I really doubt thinking like that is uncommon. Aren't you afraid hiring with caring about race is poisoning white people with either patronizing approach towards black people or reluctance towards hiring/working with them and it makes progress in racial equality actually going slower?"
"What star player could be traded for Simmons where the team would be happy with getting Simmons in return though? Like if Lillard or Beal asked out and were traded for Simmons, I seriously doubt the Blazers or Wizards would feel like by just getting Simmons in return that they'll just continue on as they were before having swapped one star for another.   Now lower it to the next tier down and say someone like Brandon Ingram or Jaylen Brown or SGA got traded for Simmons: would New Orleans, Boston or OKC be happy with that swap? Cause I don't think so. I think they'd feel like it was probably still a step down for what they want to do. It's only when you go down to the next level below that where I think the team receiving Simmons would feel happy, but then the Sixers probably would feel like they weren't getting enough in return."
These are the kinds of thoughtful and challenging conversations that need to be had and keep being had. I'm proud that Jaylen Brown represents the Celtics.
"You never get 100% on these trades. for AD you got London, Ingram, hart and picks, and Ingram has turned into a star  For George, they got SGA, filler and picks and SGA has turned into a future all star  For butler they got LaVine and stuff and Lavine turned into a star  Houston arguably bungled it, and wanted to reset with picks, and got Levert.  But in none of these trades did the team losing the superstar get equal value for their top 10 or so guy, and Simmons is not a top 10 or even top 20 player. So for Morey to think he‚Äôll get a perrenial all star like Lillard, Jaylen Brown, or anything in between is absolutely silly. Because most ‚Äúperennial all stars‚Äù are better than Simmons. The wizards would laugh if the 76ers called and asked for Beal."
[Early in his career I thought Jaylen Brown was a punk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWd3I8FaSgo) but it turns out he's really good person.
Trading Jaylen Brown for Ben Simmons is a fireable offence even in 2k.
Nah he's just gotta put in a word with Jaylen Brown and he's in.
&gt; And I‚Äôm saying what if Ime was just the most qualified and best choice.   It was a great hire.  He didn't need Jaylen Brown influencing the decision by pushing for a black coach.  &gt;People always try to act like people get hired bc they are black or diversity  People don't ALWAYS try to act like that.  But when things like what Jaylen Brown said come out it feeds that narrative for when people do act like that.   The message should be eliminate discrimination.  We don't achieve that by trying to balance the scales with an equal application of discrimination.
Jaylen Brown is going to shock everyone again. He wasn‚Äôt even healthy last year.
Then how come most top comments are supportive of Jaylen Brown and the decision to hire Udoka?
"I think that semantics are killing the idea.  If you have a (let's pretend that there are 2k ratings) white coach with a 85 rating and a black coach with a 88 and you pick the white one, it smells weird.   If you have a white coach with a 88 rating and you pick a black coach with a 85 rating, that doesn't smell too bad because I bet there are going to be some cultural things that the players could prefer.  But it all depends on the context. If Jaylen Brown is in a team like the Mavs with a lot of European players and he tells Cuban ""You have to find a black coach"" it doesn't make too much sense.  I'm always scratching my head when it's like ""Fire this great assistant and hire this unknown [race/sexual orientation] guy"". You have to hire the best coach and the coach that makes your players better. You can hire the best coach, but if he hates the hiphop culture (for example) and 80% of your roster loves that culture, they are not going to feel comfortable, low chemistry, etc.  IMHO"
So will you acknowledge that Jaylen Brown was being racist in this instance?
"Jaylen Brown is that dude. Wish he was on any other team, but I‚Äôll still root for him any day."
Huge Jaylen Brown fan but I‚Äôm sick of hearing ‚Äúend racism‚Äù then have him care about the skin color of the coach. If you end racism it shouldn‚Äôt matter
"Just pointing out the facts. This sub is 90% white, and most are saying Jaylen Brown is wrong. You can do what you want, idrc, just found that funny"
"Dude. I‚Äôve never been big on the Jaylen Brown hype train in terms of his performance (he‚Äôs great, just never thought he should‚Äôve been hyped so much in trades.) but his intelligence and attitude are incredible. Wish I could see more in depth interviews with him. He could be a future NBPA president for real."
"I can‚Äôt wait for this sub Reddit, which is like 90% white, to tell Jaylen Brown he‚Äôs wrong"
Jaylen Brown knows all about terrible urban planning policy since he's from Atlanta suburbs lol
I understand Jaylen brown completely. That‚Äôs the problem‚Ä¶ Jaylen browns thinking is racist.   It‚Äôs no different than a bunch of white I Bankers wanting their boss to be white because he fits their culture better.
"KG to the 1996 Bulls would keep them a dynasty after MJ left.  Derrick Rose to the Grizzlies would be interesting, maybe they never trade Pau to the Lakers.  D-Wade to the Bucks with Michael Redd would be a contender.   OKC might have forfeited Harden to get Blake Griffin.  Jaylen Brown on the Warriors maybe makes them still legit contenders."
Wait so Jaylen brown wanting a black head coach is not racist?
"The comments are going about as expected. White people in here that don't understand privilege and optics. Or that there aren't enough black head coaches because qualified black head coaches don't get their fair go due to age old racism that goes ""white man smart, black man just athlete.""  I'll just say, good for Jaylen Brown for fighting for this."
"It‚Äôs supposedly not ok for Jaylen Brown to want a black coach. That‚Äôs very racist. So when you hear this stuff as a white person, you think, wow that‚Äôs hypocritical.  I‚Äôm a hedge fund manager, I want my new CFO to be white so he can get along with our business partners better, but I will accept if a black person is the best candidate."
So Jaylen Brown basicly forced positive discrimination on the Celtics okay
"This isn't a wrong.  Udoka was not just hired because he was black.  He was hired because they thought he was the best choice.  People who understand diversity hiring understand it's about opportunity - fill that pipeline up with diverse candidates and make your best choice.  The Celtics cast a wide and diverse net, including white coaches, and even considered two women.  In the end they went with Udoka.  Did Jaylen Brown want a black coach?  Yeah, obviously.  But would he be upset if the perfect coach ended up being white?  Not if he felt the Celtics did a genuine thorough search and understood how they came to that conclusion.  The issue Jaylen and many others have is that there are many well qualified black coaches who are not getting the chance, yet the same white coaches keep failing and getting hired elsewhere over them."
"Assuming a coach with decades of coaching experience for one of the best run organizations ever is under qualified just because Jaylen Brown said ‚ÄúI want to work with a black coach‚Äù is an even worse thought process.  Can you prove, with facts, that there was a more deserving candidate than Udoka? Or is it just ‚Äúgeneric white coach A is better because he‚Äôs better‚Äù?"
"I‚Äôm positive Jaylen Brown is aware of Russell, KC Jones, Doc, and the other black coaches the Celtics have had. It was more about league wide representation, and it just happened that he‚Äôs only got a voice in this organization. If he played for Charlotte or Denver, he‚Äôd have said the same thing."
"&gt;Why even mention race?  ""If Jaylen Brown thinks he can relate more to a black HC and that the team will play better through having one than I have no issue with him requesting that."""
"If Jaylen Brown thinks he can relate more to a black HC and that the team will play better through having one than I have no issue with him requesting that. Ime Udoka is more than qualified, as Jaylen said, he was my top choice for the team from the start."
Jaylen brown
"Yep, so far the pieces from the original trade (along with some added free agency pieces and the occasional conditional pick that frequently didn't convey) have been turned into 4 total all stars:  Jaylen Brown (via draft)   Jayson Tatum (via draft)   Isaiah Thomas (via trade)  Kyrie Irving (via trade that included Thomas, Jae crowder, and the 2018 nets pick)   As well as a list of players who have logged playoff minutes for the Celtics:  Semi Ojeleye  Romeo Langford  Tyler Zeller  Jonas Jerebko  James Young (not very good playoff minutes, but he did log minutes on the 2017 ecf team)   Jordan Mickey (see above)  Abdel Nader   Gerald Wallace  Jae Crowder (IF and only IF we include the Rondo to Dallas deal as an extended part of the rebuild)   Juancho Hernangomez is the latest player to find his way to the Celtics as a direct result of the nets trade, so if he is traded away then I'll have to add more lines to my spreadsheet"
"&gt;Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are great players, no one is denying that, but Brown is coming off of injuries and I don't think he is going to be any better than last season, more of the same with probably a slower start to the season  Brown's injury wasn't major and he got surgery early so that he would be ready for this upcoming season. You're making a bigger deal of his injury than it really is. And Brown has made massive leaps every year (outside of 2019 for obvious reasons, that whole team was a mess).  Jaylen Brown PPG/FG% from his rookie year until now:  2016/17: 6.6/45%  2017/2018: 14.5/47%  2018/2019 (outlier for obvious reasons): 13.0/47%  2019/2020: 20.3/47%  2020-2021: 24.7/48% (both career highs)  It's clear he's made massive leaps basically every year and is still young, it's more likely he takes a leap since he isn't even in his prime yet...He's going to be a much better player this year than he was last year  &gt; I'm not as high on Tatum as most everyone else is, he is a fantastic player, but I don't see him as one of the next faces of the league.  You're underrating Tatum. Not much to say here, but get prepared to eat your words lol. He's 23 and already a top 12 player. This year he's going to be top 10. Keep sleeping on him though  &gt;Marcus smart is fantastic, but I don't necessarily like having him be the guy having to run the offense much at all, but regardless he is still elite defensively and has proven he can shoot to a certain degree in this league  Both Tatum/Brown's numbers were much better with only Smart on the court and not Kemba (they both scored more and on higher %'s) last year. Smart becoming the full time PG is a good thing. He is a mix bag I'll give you that, but Smart is a good player overall because of everything he brings like you said (defense and is a streaky shooter)  &gt;Dennis Schroder is the antithesis of Marcus Smart. He is going to be a negative on defense, but bring in a scoring touch off the bench, but if he shares the floor with the two star forwards, I see him taking opportunities away from them.  Schroder isn't a negative on defense overall. I do agree his defense is overhyped, but to say he is a negative is a little overkill. Guys like IT, Kemba, Trae are negatives on defense, not Schroder. And he's not taking shots away from the Jays lmao, we need MORE good players who can get baskets and create for themselves. I don't think you have ever watched the Celtics lol. Kemba is gone which means we need another scorer who can give us between 15-20 PPG like Kemba did, and Schroder can do that. Schroder off the bench is a major weapon for the Celtics, he's super underrated just because he had a few bad playoff games with an injured Lakers team.  &gt;I just don't like his fit necessarily with this roster.  Again, you don't really follow/know the Celtics lol. We fixed a lot of our issues this offseason. We have a better big man rotation (Horford/Williams/Kanter&gt;&gt;&gt;Theis/Williams/Kornet) which allows us a lot of versatility now because of Horford. With Horford we can start him at the 5 (Smart/Richardson (or Nesmith)/Brown/Tatum/Horford is a lineup that can switch everything on defense and play 5 out offensively. We also have Williams who has a lot of potential and is starting to put it together. He gives us a massive shot-blocking/lob presence on defense/offense. We also have a stronger bench with Schroder as the 6th man and Williams (or Horford) off the bench. We have a bunch of 2nd year players with promise as well (I personally think Nesmith is going to be a key role player for us this year, and maybe Pritchard as well)  &gt;I see potential with Josh Richardson, but I'm not sure if that potential is going to come to fruition with this team nd the role that will be asked of him.  For once, I agree with you. I have no idea how the JR experiment will go  &gt;I am not a believer in Robert Williams either. It feels like he has barely played and the Boston fans are already saying he is a top tier center in the making. I personally don't see anything more than a lower end starting caliber center from him  Once again, you're underrating him lol. Injuries are 100% a real concern with him no question, but his talent/impact is there when he is healthy. He has a Clint Capela career type, and that is not low end lol. He had 9 blocks in a single game in the playoffs last year, he's special  &gt;Horford is a imo going to just be decent for short stretches, the guy is getting old.  He's still good, go watch him in OKC. They shut him down because they didn't want to win games...  I'll come back to this comment once the regular season ends don't worry!"
Jaylen Brown.  I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd see this man be anything other than a serviceable 3&amp;D guy for his first 3 years in the league. He just couldn‚Äôt dribble and his bad free throw numbers were concerning.   Ironically as his offensive skillset has blossomed his defense has taken a step back. He‚Äôs actually a pretty poor defender now but a fantastic all around offensive player.
"Yeah I didn't realize that it pretty much directly turned in Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Kyrie (for a couple years). Ainge was probably ecstatic that that opportunity fell into his lap like that"
He is absolutely not better than Jaylen Brown that is not even a conversation.
Steph-Jrue-Jaylen Brown-Giannis-Embiid
"Didn't Jamal avg 26.5/4.8/6.6, come back from 3-1 twice in the same run, and was 1 Buzzer beater from going up 2-1 on the eventual champs in the 2020 playoffs, including having a 3 game run of 50,42,50 on the 1st 3-1 come back? Didnt he do a 360 layup around a 3 time DPOY in that come back? Didnt he do a fake up and under reverse in those playoffs around Lebron James who most consider to be top 3 all time? Who tf do y'all think Jaylen Brown is God disguised as Jaylen Brown gtfo. If Jaylen Brown was Jamal Murray you would havr won a ring in the last 5 years. They said Jaylen not Jason Tatum."
"He‚Äôs a super athletic guard who is also a pretty decent playmaker. Idk about him being better than Jamal Murray, holiday, or Zion but you could definitely make an argument for him being better than fox and jaylen brown."
"Kyrie, Jaylen Brown, Kawhi, Giannis, Myles Turner  Dragic, KCP, Huerter, Galinari, Nerlens Noel"
"Someone who has an all star selection but isn‚Äôt consistently getting 1st/2nd team all NBA like Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Lavine, Randle, or Zion versus the likes of Curry, Luka, LeBron, Jokic, Giannis, KD."
Jaylen Brown was not a borderline all star in 2020
"JJJ is more switchable, takes shots that aren‚Äôt just open dunks, and wasn‚Äôt really used all that well.  A jaylen brown style improvement isn‚Äôt out of the question for him with his potential. He‚Äôs a better passer, shooter, and has better handles than Allen by the way."
Because a black person is treated as a black person not a ‚Äújust a person‚Äù in North America. Kind of obvious that you celebrate excellence given those unique challenges as well as be a role model to those who are other wise told they can‚Äôt by society (see: Jaylen Brown for example).   I‚Äôm assuming you also don‚Äôt know what an HBCU is either. Do some reading instead of expecting the naive overwhelmingly privileged white redditors to answer imo.   I‚Äôm hoping you‚Äôre not from North America to be asking such a question.
"I get Jaylen Brown vibes from this deal and JJJ's progression.   They'll clown it now because they haven't actually watched JJJ for more than a few games but a year from now they'll be saying ""what a steal"" when he gets a full season under his belt."
"&gt;Jaylen Brown took about 70% of his shots assisted in 2019, and he lowered that to 63% the next season and 58% this season.  So it took him 3 years and even his development has been extremely unique. Players don't usually progress as fast as Brown has."
"Only 70% of his shots assisted is actually pretty impressive for a 3&amp;D wing, enough to be at least *somewhat* encouraging. Mikal Bridges, another guy in that mold that people seem to be pretty high on, takes 87% of his shots assisted. Jaylen Brown took about 70% of his shots assisted in 2019, and he lowered that to 63% the next season and 58% this season.  More specifically, OG takes nearly all of his threes off the catch, but he self-creates about half of his twos. It's not like he has *no* self-creation ability, he's actually a pretty solid off-the-dribble slasher‚Äî adding even a halfway efficient pull-up three or midrange game would open things up for him immensely. Again, that's still not *easy* to do, but it's also a lot more straightforward than if he had no handles to speak of."
"Well that's a process that takes a couple of years. it took Jaylen Brown like 4 years to ""take a leap"" and develop good handles."
&gt; I‚Äôm just arguing against the original point that Brown showed more than JJJ has at his point in his career  Oh yeah you‚Äôre right about that. I don‚Äôt think jaren will improve like jaylen but I still like the signing.
Disagree a fair bit with the last stretch of ur list.   1. KD 2. Giannis 3. Steph 4. Bron 5. Kawhi 6. Harden  7. Jokic 8. Embiid 9. Luka 10. Dame 11. AD 12. PG 13. Kyrie  14. Trae 15. Tatum  16. Jimmy Butler 17. Chris Paul 18. Donavan Mitchell  19. KAT  20. Zion  21. Bam 22. Booker  23. Lavine 24. Beal 25. Gobert  26. Shai 27. Middleton 28. Russ  29. Jaylen Brown 30. De‚Äôaaron Fox
Jaylen brown played basketball games
"Hunter is a super smart+fundamentally sound defender and can guard most guys 1-4 except for really quick 1s or really big 4s, 2nd best defensive player on the team after Capela.   Seemed like he was gonna mostly be a catch-and-shoot guy after his rookie year, but showed a massively improved self-creation game his 2nd year, both in the midrange and getting to the basket.   Overall, he's the player with the most realistic upside on the team as far as becoming a 2nd star beside Trae. His improvement from Year 1-&gt;Year 2 was insane.  -------  Reddish is a pretty bad player with an elite highlight reel. Solid defender with great physical tools 6'8 w/ 7' wingspan, hyperaggressive on-ball and hunts steals/deflections, which makes his defense get overrated by a lot of the fanbase. Not great off-ball and has plenty of lapses that push him into the Jaylen Brown area of just being kinda good on that end.   Offensively, he's pretty much just a pull-up jumper guy, and he's pretty terrible at shooting pull-up jumpers.   He has a ton of space creation moves and looks comfortable getting into his pull-up, but it just doesn't go in much.  Maybe the worst passer on the team, and rarely actually gets all the way to the basket, which plays into his reliance on pull-up jumpers.   If he bought into a role as a pure catch-and-shoot 3 and D guy, he could end up being valuable, but as his offensive game stands now, it's hard to justify playing him."
"We can have an actual discussion if you want. I understand injuries happen every year. What doesn‚Äôt happen is the literal most injured playoffs in nba history. [It‚Äôs not even an exaggeration.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/sports/basketball/nba-record-all-stars-playoffs-injuries.html). It broke the all time record for most all stars missing. Not just that, it gets even worse when you consider exactly who was missing. You have Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, and James Harden all either leaving early or playing on one leg. That‚Äôs 3 of the top 5 players and another top 10 player. Then you have Kyrie, Jaylen brown, Jamal Murray. All great players that would have changed the tides of their respective series. It‚Äôs clearly not just another ‚Äúan injury happened‚Äù year. It‚Äôs very rare for both the eastern and western teams to make it through because the best teams in the conference all suffered major injuries. Most years the clear cut best team in the league wins, some seasons the second best team wins because of an injury, but it‚Äôs very rare for the 4-5 best teams in the league to Duke it out because 1,2, and 3 all got hurt. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying."
Jaylen Brown is so nice man he always improves a shit ton every season
"Well for one injuries. Kemba, Smart, Brown, and Tatum only played 18 games together last season. Ik Kenna‚Äôs gone obviously, But just having Smart, Brown, and Tatum on the court together will make the team improve. A lot of games last year they were playing with just one or 2 of them. Also theCeltics were right in that 3-4 seed range when Tatum came down with COVID, and when he came back we were in the 8 seed range. Even with a month left In the season they were at the 4 seed, then a losing streak dropped them down to 7.   Other than injuries which were a big part of last season for most teams, the Celtics defense should improve, getting rid of Kemba and Tristian, bringing in better defensive players like Horford and Richardson. Also Aaron Nesmith played well last year, and could make a jump to a pretty good rotation piece, he was already solid defensively last year, and his offense should improve this year, he was a knockdown shooter in college I could see him having a very good year.   Next is Robert Williams, who is an all star level player if Healthy, which I know is a big if. Next is ball movement, where the Celtics really struggled last year, but with bringing in a new coach I think some of those problems like the offense getting stagnant and iso ball will change.   And finally, The biggest reason is Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum. I think that duo is better than any one in the east besides Nets/Bucks, and expect each to take a step forward, Tatum has MVP potential imo. Obviously it might not all work out, but if each team reaches their ceiling I could see the Celtics being as high as the 3rd seed, and I think it‚Äôs really close between them and the Heat, but I give the Celtics the edge because of the stars. But it is very close, not much difference between the 3-6 seeds it seems."
You think jaylen brown is better than Tatum?
"Just find them hard to like in all honesty outside of jaylen brown, the fans are annoying too"
It's not possible but Gobert fir Jaylen brown and Clint capela would be insane.
Yep. Bill Russell and Jaylen Brown or Larry Bird and Jaylen Brown would do damage
"Jaylen Brown - Luigi. He's a star in his own right, but is resigned to playing second fiddle to Mario / Jayson Tatum. And he rocks a green outfit."
SGA and Jaylen Brown.
Jaylen brown. I know he‚Äôs a good two way guy and the prototypical modern wing but what ways does he like to score? Is he more of an offball guy or does he get the ball and get his own shot
Jaylen Brown?
Jaylen Brown stole his powers
Jaylen brown fuck it downvote me
"Jaylen Brown   You never really see his name for debates about the third best shooting guard in the league among names like Beal, Booker, and Mitchell even though his defense is miles better than all three and is also a three level scorer"
Jaylen Brown. Dude had one half of a season where he shot unsustainable hot from midrange and suddenly he's some amazing star. Gonna go back to being mediocre next year. He is at best a solid 4th option on a championship team.
People really underestimate how valuable the ability to create for yourself and others is (aka the most valuable skill in basketball)‚Ä¶..plus they kill Jaylen Brown for his questionable off-ball defense despite his great on-ball defense even tho it‚Äôs the same situation with Klay
Jaylen brown and picks! üòë
Jrue / Jaylen Brown / Pat or Divi / Kash / Giannis
And you know Tatum and brown will both improve. They always do. I‚Äôm really excited to see what new skill jaylen brings to the table this year
Who would you pick as your 2nd option. Jaylen Brown or John Collins?
I doubt Jaylen Brown is that mentally weak.
"Just imagine how good this team is if we could get (and I know this is a silly thing to say because you can‚Äôt just go pick up a superstar) a Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Paul George type guy.  How wild would that team be?  Add more defensive capability and keep the floor stretched.  I think it would be so cool to watch."
Thanks man. On a side note Jaylen Brown is my fav player not on the Dubs. I like his game SO FREAKING MUCH.
"Seriously. Loving me some Drummond, also love me some Jaylen Brown with his intelligent ass"
Are you suggesting jaylen brown isn‚Äôt a star?   Also purely number wise he‚Äôs been incredibly consistent for a number of years now
"Jaylen ""CJ McCollum"" Brown"
Doesn‚Äôt help that Boston is a racist city (at least according to Jaylen Brown).
he has jaylen brown as his wingman. why would he leave?
"I also saw Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, and Amir Johnson at the same store!"
"Don't look at his box score tonight, but Jaylen Brown."
I could see jaylen brown leaving first
"I disagree w the sentiment but the harsh truth is that Jaylen Brown does not currently have the mentality to be a #2 on a championship team. His defensive energy is too dependent on offensive production, and that's not a recipe for success."
"Raptors defense is lockdown bro. We‚Äôve done this to Beal, Jaylen Brown etc."
Fam I‚Äôm really not over here and it‚Äôs really weird that you would remember me anyway I must‚Äôve really pissed you off lol  Nothing I said was ‚Äúdumb‚Äù. Morey would trade Simmons for Ingram or Brown today. It makes you look like a moron that you‚Äôre still defending Simmons as if he didn‚Äôt just have that playoff series from a few months back. Bet you‚Äôre one of the people who think y‚Äôall can still finesse a Beal or Dame for Him   I never argued with you that Simmons was better in earlier Seasons than Jaylen read the message over again
Jaylen Brown
Are you talking about Jaylen Brown?
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum both need to become more consistent scorers.
Jaylen Brown
Darkhorse is jaylen brown in a few years. Underrated imo
"How about the Clippers screwing themselves with Luke Kennard on this deal:  Nets receive: G Landry Shamet and draft rights to F Reggie Perry (57th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft) from Los Angeles; G Bruce Brown from Detroit  Clippers receive: G Luke Kennard, C Justin Patton and four second-round draft picks (Portland 2023, Detroit 2024, 2025 and 2026) from Detroit; draft rights to G/F Jay Scrubb (55th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft) from Brooklyn  Pistons receive: Draft rights to Saddiq Bey (19th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft), F Dzanan Musa, draft rights to G Jaylen Hands and Toronto's 2021 second-round draft pick from Brooklyn; G Rodney McGruder and cash considerations from Los Angeles  You get .. Kennard, who you proceed to extend for a crazy price of 14 mil a year,(Mavs fans even mock the clips over it  https://fansided.com/2021/06/04/mavs-fans-are-taunting-luke-kennard-contract/#:~:text=In%20December%2C%20Kennard%20inked%20a,63%20games%20played%20this%20season )  and you gave away what would have been Saddiq Bey.  Saddiq is already much better than Kennard, and has a cheap rookie contract.  Disaster for the clips, payback for dealing the Pistons Blake hah.  The blake griffin trade is worse, in retrospect.  Pistons gave up Tobias Harris, Avery Bradley, Boban Marjanovic and future first- and second-round draft picks"
"For real. Since 2010, the number 3 has been:  Derrick Favors Enes Kanter Bradley Beal Otto Porter Jr Joel Embiid Jahlil Okafor Jaylen Brown Jayson Tatum Luka Doncic RJ Barrett LaMelo Ball Evan Mobley  And Harden went 3 in 2009.   In total, that's 5 all stars, 3 developing players, 3 good role players, and one bust. That's a great return."
The discussion is about draft night and drafting the best player at the time on that draft night. Simmons was better than Brown in 2016 draft night.  How are you not getting this? Where in the blue hell did I ever say Ben Simmons is better than Jaylen Brown as of currently??
That‚Äôs not a fair one:  Jaylen Brown did not look like a top-3 pick out of the gate.   Sixers would have been *killed* for taking him over Ben.
76ers had the number 1 pick on 2016 draft night.. the consensus best player of the draft was Simmons..   Jaylen Brown was a reach even at 3rd for most of the scouts and execs out there on that night
They could have had Jaylen Brown over Simmons too...
"&gt;The 76ers could have had Embiid, *Jaylen Brown*, Tatum and Mikal Bridges had they just picked the best available player with their own pick  FTFY"
"When I was originally making my comment I had Baron Davis in mind which is what my athleticism part was referencing. I think he can be a floor general in the same way Davis was but Davis was a freak athlete who was really physical getting to the basket. Suggs doesn‚Äôt have that kinda bounce/explosion where he‚Äôs gonna be putting people on posters but does have that aggressive, physical play style when he attacks.   I agree his shot doesn‚Äôt look broken or anything but he isn‚Äôt really getting much separation in the half court so he can‚Äôt really get good looks for himself (which in turn draws the D and opens passing lanes) outside of people going under on screens (for good reason it‚Äôs looking)  Marshall was also a gifted passer when he was in the league and people had high hopes if he could become more of a scorer (not close to as good of a defender as Suggs) but if Suggs doesn‚Äôt either tighten up his handle ala Jaylen Brown (compare him now to his rookie season) or up his shooting numbers his offensive impact won‚Äôt be all that great."
"1. It's LeBron.   2. I actually like this one a lot because he kind of goes right at and through LeBron. For a lot of posters that you see, the defender is a step late because it's a fast break or a late contest. Like LeBron gets to the spot first by a fair amount in Jaylen's dunk and Jaylen is pretty much going over him. Meanwhile, with Tatum's, even though it's more aesthetically pleasing, LeBron is a step late on the contest and Tatum is able to kind of dunk around LeBron. The Brown on Bridges dunk is very similar. By the time Bridges is able to contest, it's already too late."
I thought Levert is better than Jaylen Brown. Unfortunately injuries have halted Levert‚Äôs development but Brown still would be better slightly.
"lilmozee posts a thread titled ""NBA's official YouTube posts a video titled ""Better Think Twice Before Jumping With Jaylen Brown"" but leaves out his poster on LeBron"" but leaves out [the poster on LeBron](https://youtu.be/aq76i7sxE58)"
Brown got drafted after a game changing point forward and a forward that was getting compared to KD.  It was not exciting.  Nowadays though every single team wants more Jaylen Browns.  I think we‚Äôre much more concerned about scorers who only score in todays nba and we as fans might be getting a better understanding of why guys are valuable.
"I wasn't directly comparing Jaylen and CJ's game. I'm saying they don't have any signature elements about their play-style. There's nothing that would make you say ""that move was Jaylen Brown-esque"" when looking at a prospect.     That Tony Parker opinion is insane btw he was literally dominating in the finals like 7 years ago."
"I mean Jaylen Brown and CJ McCollum are pretty far off from each other.  No one plays similar to Giannis, KD, Jokic, Curry, Kyrie, to name a few.   The talent is just better now. To take a couple of your examples, there are more players like AI nowadays. A player with Tony Parker‚Äôs game wouldn‚Äôt be a good player in today‚Äôs NBA. To be honest TP would get smoked against today‚Äôs talent."
"Just traded for Him, Jaylen Brown, and Bam for KD, garland, and John Collins"
"I thought Luka would be a bust   i thought Tatum would be a bust   i thought Simmons, Ingram and Jaylen Brown would be busts  i thought KAT would be a bust   i thought Embiid would be a bust and specifically thought Jokic would be a bust at #41  i thought Bennett would be the GOAT and Giannis would be a bust   i thought AD, Beal and Dame would be busts and Miami should have traded LeBron to draft MKG #1  i thought Kyrie would be a bust and Kawhi was a massive reach at #15  i thought Wall and Cousins and Paul George would be busts   i thought Blake, Harden, Curry, DeRozan and Jrue would be the five worst players in the draft   i thought Rose and Love would be busts and that Westbrook would play for 20 years and never get a triple double   i thought Durant was too skinny and should have gone in the second round  i thought LMA was a bust and Rondo and Lowry were the two worst PGs in the draft   i thought Deron Williams and Chris Paul were busts  i thought Dwight was a bust   i thought LeBron was a bust"
I wasn't a believer in either the Jaylen Brown or Jayson Tatum picks at the time of their drafts.  Brown I was *sure* would bust. He was so raw and had terrible advanced stats at Cal. Tatum struck me as an old-fashioned player too inefficient for the modern game. The kind of player that would score points but not contribute to winning basketball.  Very happy to be wrong on both counts.
"Jaylen Brown would never be more than a fringe All-Star, because he wouldn't be able to create for himself at a high level. And I was literally saying this while having him as my favorite player on the team, just didn't think he'd somehow go from a player with no handles to one of the best ball-handling wings in the league"
Where‚Äôs jaylen brown
Wow I just saw him in the jaylen brown dunks video otherwise I forgot about him!
Russell Westbrook is the Best PG since Magic Johnson.  Jaylen Brown has more potential than Jayson Tatum.  Kevin Durant is the GOAT 2nd fiddle.   Porzingis is the most predictable player in the NBA. Second is Carmelo  Giannis is more dominant than SHAQ
"i'm sure some of them do still. i bet jaylen brown does, he kinda has a cohesive style. ditto with zach lavine"
Jaylen Brown has a higher ceiling than Jayson Tatum
"This is a good one.  I think players who are genuinely educated on what goes on in all of the different demographics have the right to be active and speak about such matters.  As such, there is only ONE player who can do so and it is Jaylen Brown."
"Ray Allen should have won Finals MVP in 2008.  Lebron should have won Finals MVP in 2015, if not him, Curry.  Jaylen Brown is a better all around player than Jayson Tatum."
Give me Jaylen Brown over both of them.
It depends on the context. If you‚Äôre really outmatched you are risking a 3 point play by contesting. If you‚Äôre Miles Bridges and it‚Äôs Jaylen Brown you should contest.   There‚Äôs actually an episode in Slam Dunk (basketball anime) where a player starts to contest a dunk and then at the last second pulls his hand back lets the other guy dunk it to tie it up and send the game to overtime. He avoids risking the three point play and his team wins in overtime. It‚Äôs a viable strategy in that context because he was outmatched by the dunker.
"Fuckin what?  Look up Malcom Brogdon, Jaylen Brown, or Giannis' work in the community  Just because it doesn't focus on China and focuses on their own home and people doesn't mean they aren't activists"
I like to see Giannis &amp; Jaylen Brown do well.
Jaylen brown &gt; Tatum
Jaylen Brown is the best player on the Celtics.
Jaylen Brown EMASCULATES Miles Bridges with the jam!!
Idk of all the contending teams we would probably be most willing to put in a good package of Simmons + Maxey/Thybulle/Green/Curry etc. + like 2-3 first round picks. Otherwise Dame/Beal would have to be traded to the Pelicans or Knicks or Kings etc. When are Boston gonna trade Jaylen Brown or Denver with Murray/MPJ? Golden State is very realistic but they're not really in the market for guards.  Since you know where they're gonna go who beats our offer of Simmons + Maxey + Curry + 3 firsts?
Who out of these 30 are you taking Gobert over? Serious question  Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Joel Embiid  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Bradley Beal  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Kyrie Irving  Trae Young  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Karl-Anthony Towns  Bam Adebayo  Jaylen Brown  Jrue Holiday  Zach LaVine  Deandre Ayton   Ja Morant  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
"Anyone who's watched the Celtics play more than like 2 games can tell Tatum is significantly better than Brown at both sides of the ball   Better scorer, better scorer, better ball handler, better facilitator, better defender     And Jaylen is a better offensive and defensive player than *Ingram* to the point where i'd hesitate saying JB and BI are even on the same tier     So to say *Tatum and BI* are on the same tier is just absolutely asinine. Tatum is closer to being a top 10 player than he is to being on the same tier as Ingram"
Let‚Äôs dispel once and for all this fiction that Jaylen Brown doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing. He knows exactly what he‚Äôs doing.

I was watching The First Purge and i wondering why Jaylen Brown gave up NBA for acting in mediocre movies.  https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/291/fc3/8e356f0ed56ac8a602aadf9a48949055ce-02-the-first-purge.rhorizontal.w700.jpg
"PER is a trash stat fyi but since you want to use it Drummond has a PER of 23.5 in 2018-2019. Whiteside has a PER of 25 in 2019-2020.  19.5 is a really bad PER lol. Youre just showing me how bad he is.  BPM is basically just representation of a players box score. Inaccurate stat as well.  Jaylen Brown, Middleton all have BPM lower than Westbrook. Westbrook isnt better than them.  Jimmy Butler has BPM higher than Lillard, PG13, Luka etc fyi"
Dude had Jaylen Brown running the lane! Thought that was the play for sure
"Jaylen Brown is 25, he should already be a superstar if he is going to become one."
"where's that brown hater at lmao, he's real quiet when there's nothing to say about jaylen"
"Relegation would definitely be one way to solve tanking, but of course *you'd* be fine with the idea. Celtics would be one of the top teams! Disregarding yesterday's scoreline, Celtics and Lakers would be the Manchester United and Liverpool of the NBA. Not necessarily in that order, I just honestly don't know enough about the history of the NBA to make a good comparison.  But yeah man, you guys seem to have a good team growing together, and I think Stevens is a really smart dude. Just jealous you have Jaylen Brown on your team, of course, he should be a Hawk."
"Stfu and consider Jaylen ""Michael Jordan"" Brown hater."
After all bs talks of Jaylen Brown ain‚Äôt elite this week shows don‚Äôt play with his name.
Jaylen Brown said congrats to Miles Bridges the best way possible.
"Jaylen Brown on the poster on Miles Bridges: ""I knew if I tried to lay it up, he was going to send it back to Boston. So I was going up with bad intentionsüòèüòèüòè."""
Jaylen Brown.
"Giannis very easily, he‚Äôs easily my second favorite player in the league.   Apart from that I really like Jamal Murray - he gives me Baby Steph vibes, Jokic, Seth Curry, Jaylen Brown, KD and Lavine."
"Report: does Jaylen Brown abide by, or even consider, the terms of the Geneva Convention?"
What a awesome game. Hornets are fun af and JAYLEN BROWN HOW DO YOU DOOOO
#HVE YOU CONSIDERED JAYLEN BROWN
Homicidal Jaylen Brown. I missed it
"""I burned Bridges."" - Jaylen Brown"
"""I am the one who dunks"" - Jaylen Brown"
Jaylen Brown is the owner of this team. I hope everyone knows that.
#HAVE YOU CONSIDERED JAYLEN BROWN
My guy should have considered Jaylen Brown
God I miss homicidal Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown just turned into Toguro
I'm in love with a man...and his name is Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown is an MVP candidate.
He's improved a heap in that area but Jaylen Brown still isn't the best ball handler going around
Lamelo trying to work in iso on Jaylen Brown is objectively hilarious
KD‚Äôs game is extremely aesthetically pleasing. Steph is also up there.  The next tier down:  Lavine  PG  Jaylen Brown  Ja  Zion
"man i truly love jaylen brown, but he seems so young to be the president   i know they have agents and lawyers and stuff, but he literally just turned 25 yesterday   idk, i think i‚Äôd rather have somebody who‚Äôs been around longer be in charge?"
"With the disclaimer that I think it's highly unlikely on a case by case basis that any of these guys would be available.  Guards: Dame, Beal, Kyrie, Conley, SGA, LaVine, FVV  Forwards: Paul George, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Gordon Hayward  Maybe I'm missing someone but that's 11 guys. I'd say there's a small chance at least one of them is available at some point. That's what we're playing for."
Didn‚Äôt Jaylen Brown score 24 against the Knicks in the first quarter?
I believe CJ McCollum is the players association President and Kyrie is Vice President. Not sure if Jaylen brown is involved but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised considering how smart and outspoken Jaylen is
Was that against the Boston Celtics? Who were without Jaylen Brown and Tatum eventually too when he got eye poked.
"If you saw him lock up Kawaii, Lebron, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Paul George every time they played last year you‚Äôd change your mind about him being a DPOY. He‚Äôs one of the very best on ball defenders in the league now and is also an excellent team defender.  Being a number 3 option on a championship contending team is worth a max nowadays. Especially for durable players like Wiggins."
"If Brown would have played this game would have featured a Jayson, a Jae'Sean, a Jaylen, and a Jalen."
"Elite 3 and D is worth more than the slight offensive advantage Miles comes with. Unless you think he‚Äôs got Jaylen Brown level offense I don‚Äôt see him being worth much more than a guy that can get 20 AND be your teams main first option wing defender deep in the playoffs. Miles was guarding LeBron, Kawhi, PG, Middleton/Holiday. I don‚Äôt think Miles has proven he can do that consistently enough to get more money."
&gt;Jaylen Brown  I‚Äôd say Tatum more so
"I agree with PG, but not Jaylen Brown."
"They have this same restriction for supermax players, like Giannis last season: if he didn't sign his extension before the season started he'd have had to wait until after the season to do so.   I'm not totally sure why the owners wanted it set like that (you can be sure the players would always be in favor of more chances for them to get paid), but my guess is the owners probably thought they could use that deadline as a way to pressure players into taking less money in exchange for getting that security a year earlier. Like ""this offer is on the table now, and if you don't sign it by tonight then you'll have to wait a whole year before we can even discuss this again, and hopefully you're still healthy next summer..."" Like would Jaylen Brown have signed the deal he did if he had that whole season to keep negotiating? Probably not. He might have felt like ""let's revisit this in a couple weeks after I have a hot start to the season."""
Jaylen brown and Tatum no good match
Jaylen Brown put too much fear in my heart the other night that I could see him averaging 35 for a playoff series if he had Tatum and Lillard next to him.

Jaylen brown had that against the Knicks too
"I like Lonzo, but 25 mil a year is waayyyyy too much. Especially when much better players make around that much money, like Jaylen Brown, Draymond, and Vooch."
"Joel Embiid just had it bad, and Jaylen Brown has had lasting effects."
"I have LeBron Jaylen Brown and RJ Barrett (and Valanciunas), trust me you're in better shape than I am in Fantasy rn"
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are darkhorse candidates. Horford isn‚Äôt close to the discussion of even being a darkhorse
Same here as someone that owns him with Lebron/Jaylen Brown out multiple weeks he was my only source of fantasy points üòî
Die hard Knicks fan here and will happily say I am a fan of jaylen brown (hate JT tho) I also like harden and KD even tho I‚Äôm always rooting against the nets which is weird but it is what it is
Idk if you wanna watch that series or not but we were terrible defensively because our guards couldn't stay in front of anything and we were playing an injured Al Horford at the 4 guarding Jaylen Brown.
Great post.   It would be interesting to put Jaylen Brown on the graphs to try to rule out the team just getting worse (tho of course Tatum's performance has ripple effects across the whole squad).
Let me put it this way: Kobe had more assists when he played with smush parker and kwame brown than Tatum has playing with Jaylen Brown and Al Horford. The quality of teammates isn't the issue. His attitude is.
"Not trying to be rude but I really think that's incorrect. Brown absolutely disappears from games, and is a much worse help defender which means unless he's locking a guy down on the perimeter or has his scoring game going, he's really not very helpful. Tatum at his absolute worse draws regular double teams which opens up opportunities for teammates, and defensively he is always engaged off ball and good enough on ball to be a plus defensively.  I just think its disingenuous to Tatum to say that Brown is more consistently impacting his teams performance. Tatum has for the last two seasons been by far the biggest impactor of the Celtics offensive production. The games where Tatum goes 5/19 with a bunch of assists are often still quite impactful. I can't say the same for Jaylen, yet  https://www.nba.com/stats/team/1610612738/onoffcourt-summary/?sort=DIFF_OFF_RATING&amp;dir=1"

"Here's the thing: Jaylen Brown can be the 2nd best player on a title team. Jayson Tatum has the allure of a star, but is really a hyped up Zach LaVine."
"Trae is safely top 20 but not any higher. KD, Steph, Giannis, Lebron, Jokic, Kawhi, Luka, Embiid, Dame, AD, Harden, PG, Tatum, Butler, KAT, Booker, are all clear of him then you can argue for guys like Jaylen Brown, Brad Beal, Donovan Mitchell etc."
"If you think Brad Stevens was a good coach and that Ime Udoka is a coach with potential, the only logical person to blame is Jayson Tatum. By the way, he is also the reason Jaylen Brown is requesting a trade in approximately 13 months."
Jaylen Brown is basically Klay for us and has those same strengths/weaknesses
Jaylen Brown is goin‚Äô to have a better season than Booker if he stays healthy‚Ä¶ The healthy part isn‚Äôt as solid but my point still stands
"&gt;Though I guess it's not hard when you get so many assets back lol  Got them James Young, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Kyrie.  2 out of 4 is pretty good for guys not in your future."
Tatum gets a lot of hate from Jaylen Brown fans.
Jaylen Brown &gt; Jayson Tatum
"Cade‚Äôs gonna be a nightly triple double threat (he already is). Once his shot is consistent it‚Äôs pretty easy to see multiple all stars &amp; all-NBA‚Äôs for the vegan man, just a well rounded player that‚Äôs good at everything even defence.   Mobley‚Äôs length, skill, defensive IQ, passing ability/court vision &amp; soft touch is every team‚Äôs wet dream in a big man. He‚Äôs also almost a lock for all stars &amp; all-NBAs, and will definitely contend for DPOYs.   Scottie Barnes has a ton of upside due to his monstrous frame - not to mention his skill. He‚Äôs a little too unselfish to a fault for me to consider him a future bonafide superstar, but his upside is certainly there, as a do-it-all forward that connects the offence and the defence by himself. He could play the Draymond role quite easily.    Jalen Green might not have as much upside cause of how one-dimensional he is - a pure scorer - but man can you see stardom when his shit works out right.   Then shoutout to Kuminga who got crazy potential - I see a world in which my man becomes a Jaylen Brown type, a true 2-way star - and also big shoutout to Franz Wagner, a less athletic Scottie Barnes but better on both ends.   Not to mention Sengun, such a talented big man workin down in that low block or operating in the short roll, his potential is sky high. It might be limited due to his height (only 6‚Äô9) but his passing skill is crazy, handling is nice, and IQ well beyond his years. Gotta work on his fouling tho, which will differentiate him from a starter to a backup."

"Jaylen Brown has always been as valuable to the Celtics as Tatum, and his decision-making is better."
"Jaylen Brown just turned 25 last month too, im not sure where he would be on this list tho"
"Jimmy butler, Jason Tatum and Jaylen Brown are not as goid and never will be better than Paul George."
A two-way wing who can shoot the three and slot in at SF. Jaylen Brown would be sweet.
"It's obviously hard to compare but I think there is more weight to the wall video.  Like lebron probably isn't worried about proving himself there or balling out. Brown was going HARD.  I watch the celts regularly and he was going the same intensity as a normal game (he also missed the end of the season due to wrist surgery so I think he was trying hard to restore his form)...not to mention he was dribbling circles around Simmons and nailing 3s in his face.(I know Simmons is a laughing stock now but that still a 6 10 guy in your face)  In your example the evidence obviously doesn't support Beasley being better than lebron...I don't think that wall is better than jaylen but wall was practicing with 5 allstars in these videos (don't remember the rest this was back in July) and he just outplayed them hard....I agree this doesn't mean much, but I think its shows he at least has a shadow of his former talent and would still probably be performing if it wasn't for injuries."
"Idk I was watching some of his recorded practices with jaylen brown and a few other guys during the off-season, I know it's just practice but everyone was going pretty hard (they were clearly competing amongst themselves and were hustling hard) and wall looked like the best one there...and I'm a huge brown fan.  I know again this very far from actual game but he still looked extremely talented."
Think rookie Jaylen Brown.   Athletically gifted so he does a good job of staying in front of his man but still very raw in terms of being a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù defensive player.  Defensive IQ comes with time like it did for Jaylen so Ant would be fine in the long term too. He‚Äôs too athletic to not be a good defender in the long run.
Sounds like my guy Jaylen Brown. Using superior athleticism to be a good on ball defender but still lacking in awareness off ball
I think u shoulda specified that the 6‚Äô7‚Äù shooting guard has been injured so people know it‚Äôs Jaylen Brown who you‚Äôre talking about
"Here's what he's said on vaccines:  &gt;‚ÄúThe WNBA is 99% vaccinated and I think the NBA is over 90%,‚Äù Brown said in September. ‚ÄúI think the NBA and the [players] union have done a great job. In certain states and certain entities, they‚Äôre not at that percentage level.‚Äù   &gt;‚ÄúEverybody has their own thoughts about it,‚Äù Brown added on the vaccine. ‚ÄúPersonally, my closest family members are vaccinated. I have family members who are vaccinated that are concerned about getting a booster shot or multiple booster shots. And I have some people in my family who aren‚Äôt vaccinated at all.‚Äù  And when he caught covid it was labelled a breakthrough case:  &gt;[Jaylen Brown is expected to be cleared in time to play next Wednesday after testing positive for COVID-19 last Friday. League sources indicated to MassLive.com that both Horford and Brown suffered breakthrough cases and are vaccinated.](https://www.masslive.com/celtics/2021/10/payton-pritchard-likely-broke-his-nose-celtics-guard-will-travel-back-to-boston-for-evaluation.html)  He's also given talks at venues with strict vaccine rules [\(i.e. Berkeley\).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXbg0v377Bw)"
The evidence that Tatum is uncoachable is borderline overwhelming. Jaylen Brown getting sick of it. He'll ask out within a calendar year. Very sad.
Reminder: Jaylen Brown isn't vaccinated
Wish Jaylen Brown was on a likable team
The Celtics are whack af. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown on the team yet this is the quality of basketball they put forth.
"I agree. Boston has made some good incremental changes, but at this point, I think they need to either get a 3rd star or upgrade Jaylen Brown for someone."
"Got it, so ‚Äúpretty much anyone‚Äù other than Jaylen Brown himself or people who follow the team üòÇ"
Ha!  poor Jaylen Brown
I agree he gives off that energy that he‚Äôs only about him. Jaylen Brown gives off a more positive energy
Why would you want the more efficient of the two to not shoot?  Have you watched Jaylen Brown shoot a basketball?  He doesn't do a lot of missing.
That settles it! Time to trade Jaylen Brown for Fox and a 1st round pick.   *Ducks*
"I‚Äôm assuming you just googled key terms that aligned with the narrative you‚Äôre going for here and didn‚Äôt actually read anything    ‚ÄúI see two guys that really like each other,‚Äù Ainge said on 98.5 The Sports Hub‚Äôs ‚ÄúToucher and Rich.‚Äù   ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs definitely not 15 players, 15 cabs. I see these guys every day at practice. They get along great. And they have fun, they‚Äôre laughing, they‚Äôre hanging out,‚Äù Ainge said.  Brown said. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day we‚Äôve been playing basketball together for a long time ‚Äì all of us, especially our core group. So when it comes down to it, it‚Äôs all about trying to find ways to win. And that‚Äôs what most of the conversation was about.‚Äù  Jaylen Brown, for one, was not angry at Smart for his postgame outburst.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we love him,‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúHe plays with passion, he‚Äôs full of fire, and that‚Äôs what I love about him most to be honest. He has that desire and that will, and we need him to continue to have that. ... Who Marcus is, I love him for it. We‚Äôve got to get ready to come back with that same fire‚Äù"
Yup. Only three and a half months ago. [https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/jaylen-brown-jayson-tatum-celebrate-team-usas-olympic-gold-medal](https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/jaylen-brown-jayson-tatum-celebrate-team-usas-olympic-gold-medal)
"Ok so let‚Äôs just pretend that luka demands a trade after losing in the first round of the playoffs again, since that‚Äôs hypothetically the only way the Mavericks would listen to offers. You‚Äôd have to look for something like the Harden package but way, way better, because 1) the Harden trade sucked for the rockets and 2) Luka is only 22. So the most competitive offers would probably look like:  Boston offering Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams, Aaron Nesmith, and Marcus Smart (maybe? idk how the contracts would work) and all their picks  Pelicans offer Ingram, Alexander-Walker, Herb Jones and picks  Sixers offer Simmons, Maxey, Danny Green, Korkmaz and picks  Timberwolves send a paltry offer of Malik Beasley, D-Lo, McDaniels, Nowell and all their picks  Kings send a slightly less insulting offer of Fox, Bagley, and Davion Mitchell along with all of their picks  Maybe the Pacers get involved with Brogdon and Duarte?  Thunder could be in the mix with their millions of picks, although there‚Äôs no way Luka would demand a trade just to get sent to OKC lol.   Off the top of my head those are the only teams that could/would throw together some big trade package if Luka wants out.   Plus, when it comes to picks, you‚Äôd be looking at ~8 firsts (4 unprotected firsts, 4 pick swaps)  Obviously none of these trades match his value, but when your star player publicly demands a trade you begin to lose leverage and have to start looking for the best deal available.   Pelicans and Thunder have the best draft assets of the teams listed, Sixers and Celtics have the best talent offered. I‚Äôd be most inclined to take the either the Sixers or Pelicans deal, but I‚Äôd still try to squeeze every last asset I could get out of them."
Sounds like the same person that said we were in talks with Philly to trade Ben Simmons for Jaylen Brown
If it‚Äôs any consolation we‚Äôre down joe Harris Bruce brown and claxton. If Jaylen brown plays I think it‚Äôll be a decent matchup.
"""Drafted well"" or have been drafting at the top of the lottery for quite a bit? I think they'd be looked at as more successful talent evaluators if they took Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown instead of Lonzo/Ingram. Caruso was undrafted.  I'll give some credit to the later rounders (add Kuz, THT, Zubac) but Randle, D-Lo, Lonzo, Ingram, etc. were good picks but had much higher expectations given where they were taken and overshadowed by the success of players taken a little after them like Lavine, Booker, Brown, Tatum... But at least they didn't go Jahlil Okafor or trade into the #1 spot to take Fultz."
"I‚Äôm a Celtics fan. I have always hated Ben Simmons for his social-media driven personality and obviously being a somewhat rival of ours (we always beat them so no rivalry), and I despise of Kyrie Irving for the empty promises that he made to our team and the flaky selfish attitude and honestly just the bad memories. LeBron struggling right now, lookin old‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not ready to tease Harden just yet‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶ As far as basketball karma goes for me, I‚Äôm sitting back with my feet up this year listening to the wisdom of Jaylen Brown while eating popcorn just LAUGHING at my foes crumbling.   I should add that I am fully aware of the mediocre season we have had to start, and yes I am still scared of Brooklyn."
"There isn‚Äôt a consensus, and would depend more on whom you would be getting in the transaction / rest of the team.    Jayson has a higher ceiling but is less of a natural leader - will take home time to get there (much like how both Pierce &amp; Kobe were not natural leaders for some time).  Jaylen seems more fit for that, but his ceiling is a little lower.  There‚Äôs recency bias though; Brown has been amazing and Tatum has slumped at the beginning of the season - but that looks turned around.  The probably correct answer is keep Tatum.  The most natural pairing &amp; hardest role to fill would be a top PF/C. Tatum can play PF, but when he does Boston can be a little undersized. There‚Äôs a reason Danny Ainge lusted after AD, and why we‚Äôre especially furious that LA &amp; Paul tampered their way into that one sided trade while both Boston &amp; Portland had superior offers for him.  I digress.  I mean, the most gettable star that fits that description is KAT.  I think there‚Äôs a world where we don‚Äôt have to give up either to get him, but if we do I still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs obvious of whom would be a better pairing with him."
Ingram or Jaylen Brown
"Jaylen Brown is a saint, I love that man. Jayson Tatum can go cry in a corner, always complaining to the refs, always pushing off, thinks he‚Äôs basketball Jesus. Can‚Äôt stand Tatum."
"This isn't a petty take nor a hot take for that matter. Literally most of the celtics sub has been saying that for years. Hell a lot of ppl there prefer Jaylen Brown because he's much more efficient with the limited shots he takes compared to Tatum. Now personally, I think they're both amazing players but I do wish Tatum would fix his shot selection 100%, been saying it for a while. We even had a post showing that he's one of the worst iso player in the league while being one of the very best pnr/driving player in the league. Idk why he's so narrow minded on trying to emulate Kobe instead of doing what makes him near that superstar level like you said. It's infuriating tbh.  The other thing they BOTH need to change is their off the ball movement which is literally none existent which is holding them both AND the team back. Just looking at Curry/Klay off the ball movement vs Tatum/Brown is night and day.  Fix both those points and we're instantly a contender. I truly believe that."
The only reason y'all says he's good cuz he went to Duke imo he's a ball hog JAYLEN BROWN IS BETTER
"This is not a petty take (or even a hot one on this subreddit), but I honest to god believe Jaylen Brown is better than Jayson Tatum because Brown has consistently proved he‚Äôs willing to improve and play around his team"

Bad Bad Jaylen Brown  Baddest man in the whole damn town
‚ÄúJayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown can‚Äôt play together‚Äù
"Now don't get me wrong, I'm no basketball expert or anything, but it appears to me that Jaylen Brown might just be good at playing basketball.   I know, I know, hot take and all that."
"If Morey isn‚Äôt giving him up for anyone short of Jaylen Brown or Damian Lillard, he‚Äôs not giving him up for nothing"
I mean the Celtics were missing 2/3 of their best players for a chunk of this year in Jaylen Brown and Timelord. So they haven't been the definition of healthy either...
"And he's bad, bad Jaylen Brown The baddest man in the whole damn town"
Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown defeats Jaylen Green in the battle of Jaylens whose last names are colors.
"Who tf needs an offense when you have Jaylen ""Michael ""Jaylen Brown"" Jordan"" Brown???"
Downtown Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown is coming
Fun fact: Jaylen Brown isn't vaccinated
Jaylen Brown too
The Celtics haven‚Äôt had Jaylen Brown much?
I should clarify that Jaylen Brown and Rob Williams were both absent for the recent Celtics blowout with the big 3 active
"Not all young players are in the same situation as they are on the Rockets where they‚Äôre given reps to work through mistakes as they lead the team to a 1-15 record.   I doubt guys like Jalen Green or KPJ would be in the Celtics rotation much more if at all than they are. Rookie Jaylen Brown had better efficiency and advanced stats than both with similar per 100 numbers by this point in the season and overall. And yet by the new year of his rookie season, he was averaging just a bit over 13 mpg over his first 34 games. Priorities are different on different teams."
"He's doing everything in his convenient power. He's calling out LeBron. OK. Is he gonna call out Jaylen Brown, a huge BLM activist, who had a take no sides comment on China?"
"First time a Mavs fan dropped JB in /r/nba I did a double take. That's CLEARLY Jaylen Brown, even though it's pushing it for Celtics to lay claim to JB and JT. (The Jays is cute though)"
"Again, I know he hates Jaylen brown but how does that comment show that? How did he hate on Jaylen Brown in that comment?"
"Nah, it just seems that way because Tatum‚Äôs bad games are really bad and get more attention. When brown has a terrible game it usually goes under the radar because he‚Äôll only shoot like 2/11 compared to Tatum‚Äôs 2/18 or whatever.  Tatum is better on the average night (clearly better) and both at their best Tatum clears him. That‚Äôs not a slight to Jaylen Brown but it seems like saying something like ‚ÄúTatum has the higher ceiling brown has the higher floor‚Äù just seems like trying really hard to find a way to avoid saying ‚ÄúTatum is better‚Äù"
He hates Jaylen Brown.
"I think everyone is kinda downplaying the ‚Äúsuperstar‚Äù angle here, we need a guy who keeps on getting better and how shown absolutely crazy flashes of taking over games, most of the guys listed I think aren‚Äôt far along enough to have this conversation, we should be talking fringe level all stars who can make the next jump, guys to me like ja Morant and Jaylen brown, these guys have the potential to become true superstars, most guys listed really don‚Äôt have that kind of trajectory right now and might an all star team someday but OP is asking for superstars, and I think you need to lean into the guys who are already pretty damn good to think about for this exercise"
We don‚Äôt suck. Adjusting to a new coach and JT was slumping hard. Now that the defense is worked out we are fine. We are 7-3 in our last 10 I believe. All but one of those without Jaylen brown.
Biased: Mann    Unbiased:  Jaylen Brown.
"Right when Jaylen Brown is injured he gets into a groove. It's not a coincidence lol, their playstyles don't work together"
He‚Äôs averaging like 20 points and has been going off ever since Jaylen Brown went down.
Jaylen brown will surprise you all!
"If you were Jaylen brown, you‚Äôd be Andrew wiggins. Don‚Äôt lie to yourself"
That's a lot of ifs. I didn't even mention Jaylen Brown/Khris Middleton. Cole Anthony was just a random east guard that I mentioned that has comparable if not better stats. I could've replaced his name with FVV.
"Jaylen Brown is a proven star, but I think a change of scenery would really make him into a superstar. He is talented enough to be a #1 option on a team."
"Jaylen Brown will be an All-Star, as will Gobert and Mitchell. Paul George right now is an all star starter over either laker. Draymond's not an allstar, neither is Valanciunas. Khris middleton will be an all-star. Jarrett Allen will not be an all-star.   &amp;#x200B;  Brogdon, randle KP, wiggins, are not deserving of all-star consideration."
"I fucking wish  Edit: I traded lebron in 2K for Jaylen Brown, Josh Richardson and a couple of late 1sts. Totally worth it"
Definitely not. No team that wants Ben Simmons will be that desperate   Literally the only possibility is the Celtics but giving Jaylen brown for Simmons should be an obvious no
"Exactly. ""wOW tHe siXErS aRe sO rIdiCUlOUs aSKiNG fOr jAyLeN bROwN"" yes he's worth more than ben but who else are you expecting to the sixers to be interested on the celtics?"
"Maybe true for non-Celtics fans, but I‚Äôm talking about Celtics fans. Tatum gets hate by them because they‚Äôre Jaylen Brown fanboys who can‚Äôt stand that Tatum gets more media attention and is always said to be the best player.   There‚Äôs a handful of users in the Celtics sub with Jaylen Brown flairs that just nitpick Tatum all day."
"A lot of people on the sub love to say ‚Äúconstructive criticism isn‚Äôt hating‚Äù, but it definitely can be when you‚Äôre constantly nitpicking, even during a good game, but never ‚Äúconstructively criticize‚Äù Jaylen Brown. Which is a common occurrence."
Jaylen Brown should 100% be over Tatum in the east rn
Yep! Miles had always had the passing and finishing ability to be a star. He just couldn‚Äôt fully make use of those skills because he couldn‚Äôt handle the ball very well. Improving his handle unlocked all his other skills. Jaylen Brown went through the same process with the Celtics.
"To me the big problem is the lack of capable defenders. Last night you had THT and Melo trying to guard Tatum. They don‚Äôt have a single bulldog type guy (e.g. guys like KCP, Caruso, PJ Tucker) who can hound the other team‚Äôs best player all night or be really aggressive about getting in passing lanes. Who‚Äôs guarding Paul George, Harden, Jimmy Butler, KD, Jaylen Brown, Middleton, Booker, etc? All of those guys will feast on this team.  Lebron and AD can do it somewhat, but then you‚Äôre either moving AD off the other team‚Äôs big man, which obviously doesn‚Äôt work when that guy is someone like Bam, Giannis, or Ayton. Or you‚Äôre asking Lebron to guard the other team‚Äôs best guy for an entire game, which he obviously prefers not to do. And even if Lebron is willing to do that, it‚Äôs easy enough to get a switch and find a weaker defender.  Conclusion: this team is hopeless without a major roster reconstruction."
If I‚Äôm jaylen brown I‚Äôm coming back and dropping 60
Imagine if they had Jaylen Brown
Jaylen brown is made of glass? News to me
Turns out Jaylen Brown leading his own team looks.... very good?
Mans been playing at like all-nba level type of player this season. Jaylen Brown is the truth.
Jaylen brown
"Yeah, even if/when we see a return to earth it's not like he's going to average 16ppg.   He averaged 20ppg for the entirety of last season and 22ppg in the playoffs. Since then, he's shown visible playmaking improvements this season which has opened more space on the floor and more opportunities for him to get touches.   Last season he added some [Iverson-esque full-court bounce passes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HXQzMZGuLc) to his repertoire but now he's making passes in the half-court he just couldn't make 4 months ago, [he's throwing lobs to the roll man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLmRDtahBNg) and that's opened up all sorts of PnR opportunities for him.  He's no world-beating playmaker, but this is the same Jaylen Brown who used to have more turnovers than assists. In the past, he was working without a lot of space because defenders knew he couldn't pass out of a bad possession. Because he's seeing the floor better, defenders now have to guard the guys around him as well and that opens space on the floor.  A return to earth on his shooting splits still leaves him around 23ppg."
Ben was on both all nba teams lmao Jaylen brown wasn‚Äôt even an all star
Jaylen Brown easily
Jaylen Brown and it's not close.
"jaylen brown easily, in playoffs vs good teams jaylen shows up while simmons is a liability in halfcourt offense in the playoffs"
Need to see more Jaylen Brown but Simmons value decreases day by day
"The amount of hype he got going into college and the draft was like LeBron level. It‚Äôs not weird that he didn‚Äôt live up to that, few players do. I think what feeds into the Simmons hate is the fact that other guys were taken after him (both in that draft and in subsequent drafts) who have added to their games offensively and become 20+ ppg scorers while Simmons has appeared relatively stagnant to casual watchers. Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, De‚ÄôAaron Fox, Trae Young, Ja Morant, the list goes on. Would I rather have any of those guys? Maybe some of them. It‚Äôs probably too early to tell, but if Simmons gets traded away, the Sixers will be quantitatively worse in a lot of ways and people will see his true value."
MVP : Jokic Finals : Nets vs Clippers Beal gets traded to Denver Oladipo traded to Miami MIP : Jaylen Brown ROY : LaMelo
"Cade is the dream but I'd rather not let myself get attached again with a prospect who's certainly the 1st pick. While I'd say Kuminga, Mobley, and Green are on the same tier currently, I much prefer Kuminga or Mobley because they fit a lot better with our core. Sexton is a 2, Okoro is a 3/2 like Jaylen Brown, and so far no news from KPJ but I trust he'll get it together.  Garland/Sexton/Okoro/Kuminga or Mobley/Allen with KPJ as 6th man is a nasty young core."
"&gt; **9 Payton Pritchard has a nose for the ball**  &gt; Where would the Celtics be without Pritchard? They are plus-45 in his 229 minutes, and minus-27 in the remaining 251 minutes. All but nearly 50 of Pritchard's minutes have come with one of Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, but not both, meaning Pritchard has been crucial in Boston's offense staying afloat in minutes that are precarious without Kemba Walker.  &gt; The Celtics have gutted out a 7-3 record despite outsourcing opponents by just 18 points total. They have four wins by five or fewer points. Scrounging games you maybe shouldn't pays off in playoff seeding.  &gt; Pritchard is active on defense, with a knack for anticipating when it is safe to gamble for steals. Turn your back on him in some location Pritchard deems non-threatening, and beware a Pritchard sneak.  &gt; There are guys who read the game at such a high level -- and move fast enough -- that for them, gambling isn't really gambling. They have an edge. They count cards, basically. Manu Ginobili was a card-counter. What was reckless for most was not so for him because he operated one step ahead.  &gt; Pritchard might be a card-counter. He's averaging two steals per 36 minutes -- an elite number."
"But is he better than Jaylen Brown? Yeah, I‚Äôm salty about the player of the week deal, whatever"
"Exactly what happened. If Im the nuggest, I'd throw mpj for harden and picks in a heart beat. If I'm the sixers, Maxey is getting included. Morey got greedy on that one. if I'm the celtics, Jaylen brown and marcus smart are gone because maybe they'll throw PJ in.  Now all these easy teams have to hope KD and Harden dont get along or someone gets hurt because they have no fucking way of stopping them defensively."
"Yeah draft picks are so overrated, thanks again for Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown."
"Jaylen Brown might be mine, but I've missed a week of basketball."
"maybe something like the treasure trove of picks (and swaps) Houston got + a real young asset.  So Boston's Jaylen Brown plus all the picks possible or Sixers Simmons plus all the picks imaginable.  You can make the argument he deserves more, but i think you reach a point were the risk for any GM becomes too great and it's safer for job security to make no deal.  Overall, i agree that Curry probably stays with the Warriors for life, which is great."
"Yeah but I also have: Jimmy, Nurkic, Seth Curry, MPJ, Covington, Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, and so on. It‚Äôs a struggle to find GP and/or players not shitting the bed every week so far."
"Jaylen Brown, OG, Brogdon, CJ McCollum.  Some of the best non-all stars in the league who are versatile defenders (except CJ) and can all shoot very well to create space for Shaq to eat BBQ chicken."
Jaylen Brown 2.0
Keldon literally plays the same position and is the same size as Jaylen Brown. I love Keldon to pieces (saving my fantasy team this year) but he wouldn't have had the same opportunities on the Celts
"1. LeBron 2. Giannis 3. KD 4. AD 5. Steph 6. Kawhi 7. Harden 8. Dame 9. Luka 10. Jokic 11. Embiid 12. Paul George 13. Bradley Beal 14. Jayson Tatum 15. Devon Booker 16. Jimmy Butler 17. Jaylen Brown 18. KAT 19. Ben Simmons 20. Kyrie 21. CJ 22. Khris Middleton 23. Sabonis 24. Brandon Ingram 25. Chris Paul 26. Trae Young  I would take any of these players over Westbrook in a heartbeat and I'm probably forgetting others. He might compete for that next spot with Donovan Mitchell, Zach Lavine, and Vucevic."
"Jaylen Brown, Lu Dort, KCP"
"&gt; Harden is a player the fans love a lot more than GMs. There's no way you give up someone like Michael Porter, Jaylen Brown, etc. for him. I'm willing to bet there's at least partial relief in Philly that they're keeping Simmons.  This all comes back to are you serious about wanting to win a title or not. Or are you cool with just being a good small market team who won‚Äôt part with guys like Michael Porter Jr and then whine about how the league is so unfair to small market teams and they can never win? I‚Äôm not referring to you specifically I‚Äôm talking about these teams. Because not being willing to trade any of these guys for harden is code word for you aren‚Äôt serious about wanting to win a title. Title windows don‚Äôt last 5-10 years in the nba they last 2-3 and you retool and regroup. If you aren‚Äôt willing to live with the fact you‚Äôll only get a 2-3 year title window again it just means you aren‚Äôt serious   About the harden choker thing this all comes back to expectations and price. Harden gets held to superstar expectation: if you hold Jaylen MPJ Simmons etc to those expectations at any point in their career you‚Äôll be far more critical of them. And then finally it‚Äôs about price you aren‚Äôt giving up the price associated with a superstar. You are giving up basically one more pick and a better expiring than the Jrue holiday price. So when that‚Äôs the price it doesn‚Äôt matter if harden underperforms vs GSW relative to top 3 superstars. You aren‚Äôt giving up close to that kind of value here   Which if an owner just wants a good team and doesn‚Äôt want to take risks ok. But this is what being serious about wanting to win a title means it means taking a level of risk to get a substantially better player than any of those guys you mentioned will ever be. None of those teams are in great title positions right now they are all just in the tier of always being good to very good"
"See: _the entire 2016 draft class_  Nearly every single prospect from that class was looking like boiled ass their rookie years. Like, they were all _horrendous_.  From the lottery, not a single one of Brandon Ingram, Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, or Domantas Sabonis managed to break past averaging 10 ppg their rookie years, without much positives to show besides maybe the very occasional ""oh look at this huge game/huge play he just had! See, he has potential!"" game."
"Jaylen brown is like freaky smart intellectually (like he‚Äôs prob as smart as Kyrie thinks he is), and I always felt that was a big reason he keeps getting better and better. He just seems to be able to figure out what he needs to improve and how to do it way better than most players I‚Äôve watched"
"Harden is a player the fans love a lot more than GMs. There's no way you give up someone like Michael Porter, Jaylen Brown, etc. for him. I'm willing to bet there's at least partial relief in Philly that they're keeping Simmons.  Don't get me wrong, Harden is an offensive beast and a regular season monster, but his game has never translated well in the playoffs (go ahead, bring up the Warriors series again), and he's had issues with everyone he's playing with.   Add to the fact that his off-court conduct isn't spectacular, you don't really want to give him a contract at the end of the current contract *and* you know that if things don't work, he's going to flip around and do another trade request... I see why there isn't that big of a market."
"What about a team with three Jamal Murray‚Äôs, four Myles turners and just the one jaylen brown??? This is also real important REPLY SOON"
If either one makes it before Jaylen Brown there‚Äôs going to be some tables flipped. But honestly I don‚Äôt think either will make one any time soon.
"Rusillo podcast had 2/3 scouts say they would take Jaylen. Small sample size but a year or 2 ago it would be Simmons 100%   Brown gets exponentially  better every year, Simmons has gotten better but not to the extent most people thought"
"Giannis is better than Tatum  Brown = Middleton (fair to have either higher, but I think its Middleton)  Jrue might be more valuable than Kemba in the playoffs.   It's extremely close either way, and hard to tell right now which trio is really better, especially because we need to see if this is going to continue for Jaylen Brown."
"I'd love to go back in time a couple years and see the look on your face when you learn that by 2021 Simmons will be averaging less than half as many points as Jaylen Brown to go along with career worsts in efficiency, assists, and turnovers."
"You‚Äôre gonna take the ball out of LeBron and AD‚Äôs hands and what? Give it to Simmons? What‚Äôs Simmons gonna do when LeBron has the ball? He provides absolutely zero spacing for the Lakers and clogs the lane for both guys. Jaylen Brown would be a much better fit than Simmons. He requires the ball a lot less to be effective on the offensive side of things. You see, for a point guard, there are a lot of them that are effective off-ball on offense. Simmons is the complete opposite, and would be hell for a team who‚Äôs possessions are largely controlled by their forwards in LeBron and AD."
"I'm going to be called biased because of my flair (maybe I am) but I would take Brown.  Jaylen is a great offensive player and is at least serviceable defensively (he's good on ball but struggles off ball/as a team defender) and has added to his game every single year.  He's always working on refining his skillset and filling holes in his game and has made leaps every single year.  Can we honestly say the same thing about Simmons?  He's been the same guy for his entire NBA career, which is a good player for sure, but the glaringly huge holes that become very problematic in the postseason are still there &amp; aren't going away any time soon it seems."
Jaylen Brown is so much better its not funny .          Ben Simmons is a defensive specialist.           Brown is a budding superstar two way player who is already better than Paul George
"There would, of course, have to be some combination of young guys headed Washington's way as well. Maybe a Kemba/Smart too, or maybe those guys are flipped to a third team for assets that are more to Washington's liking.  You tell me though, what other teams out there provide the right combination of good enough trade assets + good enough chance to retain Beal long term? Miami, Denver, Philly? None of those teams are offering a Jaylen Brown level guy either."
"Who cares what the fit is with Wall? He's irrelevant. Your future right now regardless is a lotto team without any of your own picks lol.   So you passed up on tangible talent you hope turns into quality players like Jaylen Brown, Ben Simmons or Tyler Herro? Particularly with the Sixers, but also those other teams, your asking prices were way too high. So now you get to either wait for middle schoolers to turn into elite college players when you can draft them...and get to be what exactly in the meantime?"
The trade resulted in Jaylen Brown/Jayson Tatum (and a Kyrie rental) for my Cs sooooo yeah I mean....
"The same Roster turnover always happens.   Look at the Celtics team with Brad Stevens.    Marcus Smart is the only player left that played in those first 2 Playoff Series under Brad Stevens. Jaylen Brown came in during the 3rd Year of the Celtics making the Playoffs and Tatum after that.   Celtics got rid of Isiah Thomas, Avery Bradley, Jae Crowder, Kelly Olynik, Etc.   Even later on they lost Kyrie, Rozier, Morris, and Horford."
"It really is astounding to me that you think you‚Äôre some three dimensional chess god while Danny Ainge has no idea what he‚Äôs doing. If you were the Celtics GM, you would‚Äôve traded Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, and multiple firsts for Blake Griffin or Jimmy Butler years ago and the team would currently be at the bottom of the league with no draft capital. It‚Äôs hard to get to the finals. It really is. Not only has Ainge shown he can consistently get to the conference finals, he‚Äôs shown he can do it with purely homegrown talent. That‚Äôs no small feat. He‚Äôs got a huge trade exception to work with this off-season and the future looks bright. Ainge is 20 times the GM the Lakers have ever had and isn‚Äôt going anywhere anytime soon"
"Jaylen Brown is currently showing that his ceiling is high 20‚Äôs PPG with much better defense and great efficiency, not sure how that‚Äôs ‚Äúfaaaar lower‚Äù than Harden at all. not to mention he‚Äôs under contract for much longer and is way younger. Not to mention he was drafted and developed in Boston; plus Smart is the heart of the team. You can‚Äôt just build teams like you‚Äôre playing 2k"
wtf? you take that deal 100/100 times. the ceiling for jaylen brown is faaaar lower than harden's current output
Jaylen Brown and Michael Jordan
"&gt; You keep Tatum and Brown at all costs and build around them  Which is 100% where Ainge's head has been at for years now.  Which is precisely why they didn't do the deal for the George rental, or the Kawhi rental, or the Davis rental, or the now Harden rental...   Like, yeah, in a vacuum Harden is better than Jaylen.  But 2 years of Harden is not better than the next decade of Jaylen."
The Rockets team with Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart would actually be pretty competitive.
"&gt; Who cares about short term assets?  They're going into a full rebuild.  Ya most teams going into a full rebuild like to have a couple sure thing assets to serve as a foundation for the rebuild. The rockets have nothing close to resembling a sure thing from this trade either now or in 5 years.   &gt; Did people learn absolutely nothing from the Nets-Celts trade?  Your comment could have been transferred to that deal almost verbatim.  Celtics got jack shit except picks from the Nets, and many people thought the Nets were about to run the table and make those picks worthless.  Well, those picks turned into Tatum, Jaylen, and Sexton.  The Celtics nets trade was the best possible scenario for Boston, worst possible for Brooklyn. And yet Brooklyn is still a title contender faster since the trade. That should alone illustrate why banking on picks is a bad idea. Even if it all goes perfect and you end up with a few studs it doesn‚Äôt promise you anything. And statistically speaking it‚Äôs more likely that the rockets get middling assets from these picks than it is that they get brown/Tatum level assets.   &gt; Houston is going to be sitting here in 5-6 years with their own version of Tatum and Jaylen ripping up the league while the Nets are bottom feeders.  I‚Äôll list all the things that have to go exactly right for Houston in order to make this fantasy a reality and you tell me how likely it is that every one of these things happens.   1) nets completely crater to the worst team in the league over 2024-2027.  2) the rockets get lotto luck and end up with multiple top 3 picks over this time.  3) the rockets draft atleast 2 absolute studs with those top 3 picks.   4) the rockets develop those studs into stars."
"I wanted Jaylen Brown, but it's apparent the market wasn't that hot for Harden. I'm pleased with the picks."
And people compare him to Jaylen Brown lol why would Houston want Simmons at what they were asking? For what? Possible potential to be great if he ever learns to shoot consistently? For and mvp?? Come on Philly
"Idk I feel like he‚Äôd have to be someone pretty wholesome and mature, no one immediately springs to mind maybe someone like jaylen brown?"
That wasn‚Äôt available though. Everything we‚Äôve heard from Philly‚Äôs camp was that they are not giving up Simmons and a lot of picks. The Simmons talk was mostly coming from Houston saying ‚Äúwe want this guy‚Äù. Same with Jaylen Brown.
"best record in the east, 26/6/4 on 54/42/77, 63% TS, great defense   this puts him about equal to ingram this year offensively, even though jaylen is scoring more on better efficiency i‚Äôll give them ‚Äúequal‚Äù cause ingram is a better playmaker   haul me is averaging about 10 ppg more than bam, and only 1 less assist, offensively it isn‚Äôt even remotely close   defensively bam is great, but the heat are losing a lot and embiid just dropped 42 on him  booker? have you even looked at his stats this year? 23/3/4 on 60% TS is worse than jaylen in every way in addition to booker being a lesser defender   and simmons, idk why hes treated like a protected child in this sub but the facts are his numbers are basically lonzo rookie year numbers with much better defense   i‚Äôll give you his defense is better, but offensively you have a point guard who cannot shoot and averages 13 points less per game than brown, and about 4 more assists, AT BEST those 4 assists account for 12 points if they‚Äôre all threes, which means jaylen defintely provides more offensively   you can make the argument for either there   point of this is; he deserves to be there based on *this season*"
Jaylen brown was and is a great asset. I feel like I‚Äôm talking to a bunch of lunatics. I shouldn‚Äôt have to convince raptors fans that OG is a good young asset
you actually think jaylen brown wont have to be involved in a trade for beal?
"Theres a bunch of VPs. Igoudala is the 1st VP then the other VPs are Biyombo, Brogdon, Jaylen Brown, Kylie, CJ McCollum and Garrett Temple."
I remember seeing this comment but with Kyrie being the 'Alfred' to Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum a couple years back when he played on the Celtics and the Jays were outplaying him.
"I'm definitey sad that it's over and I'm also pretty sad that nothing new is starting right now.  I do like our team as long as we have Wall and a few of our other fan favorites. I'm decently excited about Kurucs tbh. I just hope we get something nice for Gordon and/or Tucker. I don't need a Jaylen Brown to be happy, but somebody young would be nice."
"He's still a rookie, volume will only help his shooting in the long run won't it? Unless the problem is with his shot selection, where i understand he should get a shorter leash (like rookie Jaylen Brown)"
But why tho? They already have Jaylen brown. Its gonna be the Hayward situation again where hes the 6th man. Doesnt make sense for the celtics.
The disrespect to Jaylen Brown
"This package isn‚Äôt close to what people thought he would fetch.  The trades were even worse when Harden first requested.  People were agreeing with Jaylen Brown, Smart, and picks for example.  I would send this all day for BK."
"Ben Simmons with less picks would have been a great package, he‚Äôs a proven star and #1 pick  A trade for CJ, who Imo is better than oladipo to pair James Harden with Lillard  A trade for Anthony Edwards, to team James Harden with KAT and DLO. Minnesota is desperate to win something, and there‚Äôs no guarantee any of those draft picks are a #1 pick and Anthony Edwards has looked good  James Wiseman maybe, with Wiggins or Oubre or Draymond. Gives Curry help and Harden might fit well in the Warriors offense  Clippers for Paul George  Nuggets maybe for Harris, Michael Porter JR, some other players  Bucks for Middleton and some picks  They‚Äôre other trades they could have pursued Celtics Jaylen Brown, Raptors Siakam,   It‚Äôs not 2K and I‚Äôm not a GM and I don‚Äôt know of any of these salaries match but they‚Äôre ideas. Oladipo is a great player but I think the players I listed above are better and Oladipo has been dealing with a lot of injury issues the past few seasons"
"Proclaiming you know where the picks are going to land is just as irrational as the people over-rating them. No one knows what these teams will look like in half a decade, it's a gamble.  The last time Brooklyn made a similar trade, two of the picks ended up being top 3 and netted Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum"
yea the last time nets traded picks it turned into jaylen brown and jayson tatum so we just gotta see
No I will not trade Jaylen Brown for James Harden.  No I will not consider Andre Drummond.  I get it. You guys are content with fighting for 4th in the East.
Or they could be Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum
Houston's just collecting picks to draft Deuce and Jaylen Brown Jr.
ALL of this is pure speculation and I have been a huge kyrie hater for a long time now but I think this is a PR stunt that his team leaked deliberately after the maskless partying video. If he was sitting out for social justice wouldn't saying that's why you were sitting out go a long way towards helping social justice? The media put the idea in play after they hadn't heard from him and I think his PR team is now trying to run with it. I sincerely think his protest of the bubble was a PR stunt and if he thought the Nets had any chance of winning he would of been there.  Jaylen brown is a man everyone should want to emulate. He has been one of the most poised and we'll spoken protesters I have seen out of anyone and he is only 24 years old. I can't wait to watch him after basketball. Kyrie just comes of as someone who did peyote for the first time and now knows all of life's secrets.
"Jaylen Brown, Christian Wood, Domantas Sabonis, Marcus Smart, idk, dozens of other contracts."
Jaylen Brown
Most likely 2 finals appearances at least is not enough for Jaylen Brown? Lol
Lol it's hilarious how much Boston fans hate Siakam just cause some random people said he's better than Jaylen Brown like 2 years ago.
"It's not just reports, there arent realistic better offers than simmons you could come up with unless jaylen brown was secretly available and I really just dont buy that"
"&gt; nets fan thats acknowledging we've had it rough for a long time  &gt; random celtics fan: lmao git gud idiot, gj trading jaylen brown and tatum xD  &gt; nets fan talks shit back  &gt; wow lmao jesus christ take a joke, holy shit wow nets fans are so sensitive, fairweather, and new lol!"
"At this stage in 2007, Dirk was on a 3-4 team he won MVP. Phoenix was 4-5 in 2006 to star the year. Cleveland was 4-3 in 2010. MVP rankings shouldn't be allowed until like 20 games in.  Because if we are being honest, Joel Embiid, CJ McCollum, Jaylen Brown or Gordon Hayward have been the most valuable players through 8-9 games. Anyone saying LeBron, Luka, Steph etc... are all projecting."
Thanks for Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown btw
This isn't Jaylen Brown to the Rockets.
It'll be funner when we trade him for Jaylen Brown and the Celtics sweep y'all in the second round.
I can‚Äôt imagine being a sixers or Celtics fan and not want to trade jaylen brown or Simmons. Just wait until those teams actually play the lakers in the playoffs. They‚Äôll wish they had him then lol.
"Jaylen Brown is a borderline all NBA player right now, that‚Äôs about the best you can hope for in a disgruntled superstar trade"
"Quick question - why does OG hype exist?  These young wings don't become stars unless they can handle the ball at a high level. Right now, he's like Jaylen Brown 2 years ago at best."
"Idk if he‚Äôs top 20 tbh. Bron, AD, KD, Harden, Steph, Luka, Giannis, Jokic, Embiid, Tatum, Kawhi, PG, Butler, Dame are all for sure better. Then I‚Äôd take Kyrie, Beal, Trae, Donovan, Jaylen Brown, KAT, and Bam over him as well. I think Booker, Ja, Ingram, and CP3 all have arguments too over him"
"Luckily there are a lot of those in the league rn, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, obviously Steph and Bron..."
"Draymond, CJ McCollum, Jaylen Brown"
"Fellow Laker fan here. A lot of what's going on in the world, along with normal maturation, has really helped erase something like a jersey. You eventually start seeing the good person and it's hard to ignore that more and more, especially when it feels like there are fewer good people in the world. It's refreshing to hear someone like Dame be reasonable and well informed on tv. Hell, I love Jaylen Brown and he's a Celtic. Short of him clotheslining AD, I don't think I'll ever be able to hate him, even if he wins a title in green. The rivalry stops mattering after you listen a few times. You just have to be happy for someone like him and Dame."
"Id take jaylen brown all day. And lol to the fair trade thing, he doesnr deserve anything, we trade him to get the maximum return, if he wants to leave thats on him"
"I'll be downvoted to hell by Celtics fans but I still think Jaylen Brown is the best option out of the more realistic options available. I don't think they have a chance against the current Philly roster with Harden on it instead of Simmons, and this might be enough for Ainge to pull the trigger."
Would Ben Simmons still be picked first out of Jaylen Brown &amp; Brandon Ingram in that draft today?
"Jaylen Brown, Siakam, Simmons, Ingram, Murray, Herro"
"Herro is the worst of these players, but he's the youngest. Simmons is the best, but he might be close to his ceiling if he doesn't start shooting. If Jaylen Brown sustains something close to this form, the Celtics should not and will not trade him for Harden"
Brandon Ingram  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons  Jamal Murray  Pascal Siakam  Tyler Herro
"I‚Äôd love to have Harden, but I don‚Äôt think we have the necessary assets to get him without Jaylen Brown. I‚Äôd have to have long term commitment from Harden to do this trade, otherwise I‚Äôd be scared he‚Äôd walk. If he agreed to stay long term it would be sick"
Jaylen Brown will look great in a Rockets jersey though.
Oh ho ho but all I‚Äôve seen talked about lately is how Ben Simmons is better than Siakam and Jaylen Brown and how he‚Äôs the absolute undisputed best option available if Harden were to be traded this year. It‚Äôs just one game but Simmons is not the guy so many want to make him out to be
Why do sixers fans think this defensive specialist is as good as Jaylen Brown?
Is Jaylen Brown still available?
jaylen brown? really?
"Jaylen Brown above Brandon Ingram, Bam, Booker, Simmons lmfao"
Jaylen Brown would like a word
Yea Oubre has been so trash this year I really wasn‚Äôt expecting that. I think I dropped him for either Dillion Brooks or Joe Harris. But Sabonis and Jaylen Brown have been keeping my team legit still.
"Alright, it's fuck Jaylen Brown now. That looked intentional."
"Two successful shot attempts from Jaylen Brown in that offensive possession, lol"
Jaylen brown just elbowed him in the dick. That would drop any guy.
Jaylen brown with the all ball play
"Jayson ""Jaylen ""Michael Jordan"" Brown"" Tatum."
Jaylen Brown might be my favorite player ever on a team I hate.  Sigh.
"Danny Ainge knows what he's building. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown could easily be All-NBA players. Not trading for AD, a player that didn't want to be here, was the smart move. Not trading for a one year rental of Kawhi was the smart move."
I will say that I never seen jaylen brown and Michael Jordan in the same room together...
That‚Äôs Georgia Senator Jaylen Brown to you
imagine not having jaylen brown on your favorite basketball team ü§¢ü§¢
Jaylen brown is a really good basketball player i think
I do not like how good Jaylen Brown is
Vote Jaylen Brown as an All Star!
thinking about how much worse life would be without jaylen brown on my nba team
Jaylen Brown
"A few years ago I thought it would be foolish of the Celtics to include Jaylen Brown in a trade package for Kawhi.  I still think that's true, sorta."
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum
C'mon dude. As a Celtics fan you benefited from trading away former All-Stars for picks and assets.  - Nets 2016 1st Round Pick used to get Jaylen Brown at 3. - Nets 2017 1st Round Pick used to get Markelle Fultz later traded for #3 Jayson Tatum and some future pick.
Imagine if we traded KP when Phil wanted to.   Reports had both Devin Booker and Jaylen Brown being offered for KP. Instead we got Dennis Smith lol
"Shaq was the Big Shamrock   Jaylen ""Michael 'Jaylen Brown' Jordan"" Brown   zyGOAT    Smarf   Aron ""All of Australia"" Baynes"
Does Jaylen Brown qualify? He gets better by the week.
Vote in Jaylen Brown and I‚Äôll give you Conley
"""lack of faith"" oh god the revision history cracks me up. We forgetting that he started over Jaylen Brown the year after his injury and healthy? He had his opportunity but never took advantage of it. Remember Draymond calling him a liability on defense?"
Jaylen Brown 35 pts book it son
"Imagine thinking Luka Donƒçiƒá was a top 5 player in the NBA and had GOAT potential because he won two games against the Los Angeles Clippers and lost in the first round lol. Couldn‚Äôt be me. Luka Donƒçiƒá isn‚Äôt even a top 15 player in the NBA.   Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokiƒá, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young and Jaylen Brown are better."
"I vote based on how well a player is playing and how much i think they deserve it and how impactful their play is... I dont vote for box office players just because theyre box office players. my list this year west: mike conley, steph curry, bron, AD, Rudy gobert.   east:  jaylen brown, harden, KD, Embiid, randle"
Jaylen brown
"everyone is so quick to hate on a 20 year old. RJ looks like a franchise piece. he‚Äôs our less-athletic Jaylen Brown.   plays excellent defense, does everything offensively - shooting is a work in progress but clearly improving - and is likely best suited as a second option that can carry the load on a lot of nights."
After his injury and recovery he was starting before Jaylen Brown
Why? Jaylen Brown is having a far better season
1st Team:   Stephen Curry Luka Doncic  Lebron James Kevin Durant  Joel Embiid  2nd Team:   Damian Lillard Bradley Beal Kawhi Leonard Giannis Antetekounmpo Nikola Jokic  3rd Team:   Kyrie Irving Jaylen Brown Paul George  Anthony Davis Andre Drummond
Jaylen Brown is gonna make it over Beal when the Wizards finish in the bottom 5 and the Celts are top 3 in the East.
"Why would the Wizard want an actual star in return? They have Westbrooks contract, so that can‚Äôt do shit until that contract has expired. After they trade Beal there isn‚Äôt even the chance to wiff at the play in tournament. So if at all those above trades would have to be 3-way trades where other teams throw in their FRP‚Äôs for a star that the team receiving Beal is giving up, but then those hypotheticals above don‚Äôt make sense.  IMHO any hypotheticals should be based on below 25 (maybe even below 23) year old players with all-star potential and draft picks (likely lottery vs. late). Nothing else should interest the Wizards. So you if you want to talk about Jaylen Brown being moved for Beal, then talk about which team will send which young players and draft picks to the Wizards in his place."
Celtics laugh they‚Äôre ass off if the wizards want jaylen brown. We‚Äôre not getting him unless the wizards decide they want Kemba plus some other stuff
"Vucevic, Hayward, Grant and Randle for sure, and if you‚Äôre talking about Jaylen Brown he is classified as a guard in the voting, which adds up to 5."
"&gt; Barnes, Otto Porter, OG, Jerami Grant, Jaylen - to name a quick few that are of similar quality to Hunter.   &gt;Jaylen Brown, who just made the jump out of the role player group  &gt;Hunter is a very good player, but he's ultimately a role player  So which is it?"
IM NOT ASKING ANYMORE JAYLEN BROWN IS A STARTER üî´üî´üî´üî´üî´
"Tony Parker, Jaylen Brown, John Wall, George Hill, Jo Jo White, Elton Brand"
"Yeah see the difference is.. kyrie is back and James harden is in the East and Jaylen Brown is on another level. 3 players with great stats(Kyrie and Brwon with great efficiency) and on winning teams. If it was like this last year trae wouldn‚Äôt have been a starter.  I understand he‚Äôs averaging 35 and if he was averaging 35 and his team was 6-9 I‚Äôd be cool, his stats actually mean nothing. He has 10 straight games of 40 points and a loss. This isn‚Äôt KD or LeBron or Kobe or MJ, guys that put up historical numbers and can lead a horrible team to a playoffs,  This is a 3rd option on championship team who decided he wanted to stay a first option and get money on a losing squad and now he cries every game. They‚Äôve been trying to trade him for YEARS bro. I definitely think he‚Äôs an all star, but a starter? Hell nah"
"That‚Äôs a false equivalency, and even then, I‚Äôm not saying that I personally voted Brown over Harden. I‚Äôm just saying that holding that position isn‚Äôt blasphemy. Jaylen Brown is averaging 27 points on 62% TS."
We should make Wayne Ellington an all-star then. He‚Äôs got a higher RAPTOR than Jaylen Brown.
"Even a quick glance at bpm for last year shows a ton of discrepancies that are pretty irreconcilable.   For example: Steven Adams, Bradley Beal, Montrezll Harrell, and Mitchell Robinson all have a 2.9 bpm and that's a wide range of player value right there. They all have a lower bpm than Whiteside, and from what I heard he wasn't positive value for Portland last year. It's full of stuff that contextually makes no sense. Jaylen Brown had a 0.8 bpm while Hayward had a 2.7, Smart had a 1.4, Tatum had a 4.0, and Kemba topped them off at a 4.6. Not only is that wrong, I'd go so far as to say it's pretty much completely off in terms of which players played the best and which players had the most impact"
"Harden, Kyrie, Simmons, Jrue, Beal, Brogdon, Lowry, Sexton, LaVine, and Jaylen Brown"
Am I watching a different Jaylen Brown? How is he playing elite defense?  Still an all star though.
Get my boy Jaylen Brown in there.
contract doesn't match again gotta add jaylen brown now lmao
"You brought up Trae Young and his record last year. Kemba Walker was also an Eastern Conference starter. That‚Äôs a dumb argument. Were there Eastern Conference players last year playing as well as Kyrie Irving and Jaylen Brown? That were winning games as well?  The Kyrie Irving hate is unreal on this sub. I‚Äôm not even going to vote and Kyrie Irving and James Harden will easily be named Eastern Conference All Star starters. They deserve it too, unlike the overrated player that wanted to be in Washington and has the worst record in the NBA."
Why would Bradley Beal start? Bradley Beal is so overrated. He might not even be a top 20 player in the league.   Kyrie Irving and Jaylen Brown deserve to start over Bradley Beal. They‚Äôve both been better and have been winning games.
"2021 celtics: kemba, tatum, jaylen brown, marcus smart  ^jk"
"Plz vote for Vuc guys.  We need it to be a thing.  I had Vuc, Bam, KD, Beal, and Jaylen Brown for East  Kawhi, Paul George, Jokic, Steph and Luka for west.  But most important we need Vuc in.  Plz.  Plz. Plz.  Magic fan shave nothing don‚Äôt deprive us of this and sweet sweet mid range jumpers in the all star game."
"Tbh I don't see the point of voting in locks like LeBron, Giannis, Steph etc since they are assured spots whether I vote for them or not.   Mine are -   East:  Jaylen Brown  Brad Beal  Tobias Harris  Domantas Sabonis  Jerami Grant   West:  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Chris Paul  Brandon Ingram  Paul George  Andrew Wiggins"
"AD isn't a wing and is the best lob threat in the league, so of course his assist rate is higher lol. That's basic basketball. You keep using exceptions and act like that disproves trends. Hunter is generally considered a role player due to both his counting stats, his advanced stats, and eye test. It's not simply ""durr 2 numbers determine who a player is"" - it's a bunch of factors coming together. Hunter can work his way out of being a role player the same way Jaylen Brown did.   The Rockets and 7-9 and the Hawks are 9-9, but Eric Gordon's stats don't count and Hunter's do? Let's try to not be so biased here. The Hawks aren't some team kicking ass out here either.   You can be a 6man candidate and be a role player. That's been Lou Williams entire freaking career. Clarkson is a bona-fide role player - has been his whole career. Same with THJ - he's still a role player who had to step up due to injuries.   I think ultimately, our ideas of role player is quite different."
"Plenty of role players average 18. Hardaway JR is 17.6, Clarkson is 17.9, Eric Gordon is 18, Malik Beasley is 19.9. Bonafide role players. Points per game over a 18 game sample size doesn't really mean anything.   69.5% of Hunter's shots are assisted, for example. Jaylen Brown, who just made the jump out of the role player group, is sitting at 52.6 assist rate. Those things and stuff like the eye test are more important in determining whether someone is a role player rather than raw ppg.   Being a role player isn't a big diss or anything. They make up the majority of players and good role players are absolutely needed to have a successful team. But stars are needed more. Having a star on your team always takes precedence over having a role player. Hunter is a very good player, but he's ultimately a role player.   If I'm building a team from scratch, and my choice to start the team is between Zion and Hunter, it's a quick answer from me."
"Is the formatting off, or did Jaylen Brown actually play PF?"
"Assisted vs unassisted on bball ref, go to the players shooting page  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/brownja02/shooting/2021  There is Jaylen Brown for ex"
how the fuck is jaylen brown not on the teams
"Fair he's been out, but the point stands. As far as the east he's not making it over Kyrie, Harden, KD, Giannis, Embiid, Jaylen Brown, Beal, Middleton, Tatum, Levine, Hayward, and Bam/Sobonis. Trae, Sexton, Brogdon, Randle and Tobias are in for disappointment unless one of them balls out."
Jaylen Brown
Swap Middleton with Jaylen Brown
EDIT:  I almost forgot about Jaylen Brown and I put him on at the end. There's an argument to be made that one of the snubs should get one of the final spots over one of the centers and I'd completely understand.
Better than Jayson Tatum and certainly better than Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown became borderline all-star when he dunked on Bron and trash talked him while hanging on the rim and ref had to T him up so Bron doesnt cry a river.
"Tatum has 4 years left on his contract not including this year, and Jaylen Brown has 3 years left. I think they‚Äôre gonna be on the Celtics for a while"
"Who would you have over him? Obviously guys like Giannis, Tatum, and Hayward. But he's about on the same level as Middleton, and so far he's been better than Jimmy and Siakam. Is Jaylen Brown considered a forward now? If the Sixers maintain the top seed, I don't think it would be a stretch to see Harris as the Sixers second all-star."
Jaylen Brown happened
"If some people were wondering about the presence of outliers, I've created a sorted table using interquartile range (IQR) as a measure of consistency.    |**Rk**|**PLAYER**|**TEAM**|**PPG**|**PPG SDev**|**PPG IQR**| --:|:--|:--|--:|:--|:--| |12|Jayson Tatum|BOS|26.6|¬±6.3|¬±6.0| |22|Christian Wood|HOU|23.5|¬±4.0|¬±6.0| |18|Jerami Grant|DET|24.3|¬±6.3|¬±6.0| |16|LeBron James|LAL|25.2|¬±6.8|¬±6.75| |2|Kevin Durant|BKN|30.4|¬±5.9|¬±7.0| |17|Collin Sexton|CLE|24.8|¬±7.5|¬±7.5| |11|CJ McCollum|POR|26.7|¬±7.4|¬±8.0| |21|Paul George|LAC|23.9|¬±6.8|¬±8.5| |1|Bradley Beal|WAS|34.4|¬±9.1|¬±8.75| |25|Donovan Mitchell|UTA|23.4|¬±6.7|¬±9.0| |22|Nikola Vucevic|ORL|23.5|¬±7.7|¬±9.8| |14|Kawhi Leonard|LAC|25.9|¬±6.1|¬±10.0| |15|Nikola Jokic|DEN|25.4|¬±6.7|¬±10.5| |24|Zion Williamson|NOP|23.4|¬±7.5|¬±10.8| |7|Jaylen Brown|BOS|27.3|¬±7.4|¬±11.5| |9|Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|27|¬±8.4|¬±12.0| |3|Damian Lillard|POR|28.7|¬±8.9|¬±13.5| |7|Luka Doncic|DAL|27.3|¬±8.5|¬±13.8| |9|Zach LaVine|CHI|27|¬±9.5|¬±14.5| |4|Stephen Curry|GSW|28.4|¬±11.7|¬±15.5| |20|James Harden|BKN|24|¬±11.5|¬±17.5| |19|Gordon Hayward|CHA|24.1|¬±10.0|¬±18.0| |5|Kyrie Irving|BKN|28.1|¬±7.3|¬±18.3| |6|Joel Embiid|PHI|27.7|¬±10.7|¬±18.3| |13|Trae Young|ATL|26.1|¬±11.5|¬±19.8|  What is interesting to note is the prevalence of high volume three point shooters at the bottom (LaVine, Curry, Harden, Irving, Young).  As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."
If Jaylen Brown continued his season season averages of (27/6/4/1.5/.5) on 60% eFg with great defense would he be a top 10 player in the league? He‚Äôs due for some regression but I‚Äôve been seriously impressed so far.
I'll vote for both if you vote for Jaylen Brown. Well I'm voting for both anyway but vote for Jaylen too please.
Jaylen brown&gt;Trae
I hear Jaylen brown being called 6'8 as well lol
Jerami Grant is way more than just a role player  Mike Conley isn't washed  Luka plays D and has a mid range game  Jaylen Brown and Tatum might be 1A and 1B  John Wall is still pretty good  SEXLAND
Paul George is better than Jaylen Brown
"Agreed. Even with the proper amount of games played, it‚Äôs clear that up-and-coming wings like Jaylen Brown and Jerami Grant have surpassed him as All Stars.  James Harden &amp; KD coming East also means even less spots for guards and forwards on the periphery of the East All Star team."
&gt;I don't know what East Guard currently has the resume to get the starter nod  Jaylen brown. Celtics are 2nd in the east. But harden and Kyrie will most likely be the starting backcourt
"Jaylen Brown was already a great player. Christian Wood went from 13/6 to 23/10. Grant from 12/3 last year, to 23/6 so far. Grant has made the biggest jump."

"Boston needs bench depth, but Wings... as crazy as that sounds. last year we had Brown, Tatum, Hayward so there was no reason to get a wing because 1 of them was always on the floor and most of the time 2 of them were out there. Without Hayward this year on the wing we have Jaylen and Jayson. after that the depth is really: Javonte Green, Semi Ojeleye, Romeo Langford (injured), Aaron Neismith. the back up ball handlers are Teague, Pritchard, Edwards and Waters. IT was one of my favorite players, but we couldn‚Äôt really use any point guard help right now unless we move some guys."
"It is kinda interesting to think about players' scoring outside of just a plain per-game average.  Here's the current top ten players in PPG with their scoring standard deviation.  I added columns for their PPG plus and minus their standard deviation to give a sense of range.  Then I added their median score just for fun since I had the numbers there.     Player | PPG | STD | PPG+STD | PPG-STD | Median ---|---|----|----|----|---- Bradley Beal | 34.4 | 9.1 | 43.5 | 25.3 | 31.0 Kevin Durant | 30.4 | 5.9 | 36.3 | 24.5 | 29.5 Damian Lillard | 28.7 | 8.9 | 37.6 | 19.8 | 31.5 Stephen Curry | 28.4 | 11.7 | 40.1 | 16.7 | 26.0 Joel Embiid | 27.7 | 10.7 | 38.4 | 17.0 | 28.0 Jaylen Brown | 27.3 | 7.4 | 34.7 | 19.9 | 26.0 Luka Donƒçiƒá | 27.3 | 8.5 | 35.8 | 18.8 | 27.5 Giannis Antetokounmpo | 27.0 | 8.4 | 35.4 | 18.6 | 27.0 Zach LaVine | 27.0 | 9.5 | 36.5 | 17.5 | 25.0 CJ McCollum | 26.7 | 7.4 | 34.1 | 19.3 | 26.0  I don't have any takeaways from this really, but it's interesting."

"Trae, Harden, KD, Embiid, Giannis, Beal, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, Bam, Sabionis, Randle, Kyrie People, Jimmy Butler, Russell Westbrook, Kemba Walker, Vucevic, Lowry, Spicy P, Ben Simmons. Would Seth be better than any of these guys?"
Jaylen Brown is 10000% better than Ben What is this this lol
"Half our sub still thinks he's an all star.  It's absolutely mind boggling when you can just look to last year and see that Booker, Ja Morant, Jaylen Brown, Lavine, Derozan, Beal, and Brogdon all got left out, and now we have Sexton and Shai and others passing him by as well.  I'm convinced that these people aren't watching the same sport as the rest of us."
"Most, not all. I haven't watched the Wizards or Pistons play yet this season.  However:  &gt; Wiggins‚Äô on-ball defense has opponents shooting 40.0 percent, better than such respected defenders as Oklahoma City‚Äôs Luguentz Dort (43.3), Boston‚Äôs Jaylen Brown (43.5) and Toronto‚Äôs Pascal Siakam (44.0).  &gt; On shots from 15 feet or further, where many wings thrive, the failure rate against Wiggins is 67.4 percent, roughly the same as Los Angeles Lakers star Anthony Davis (67.5) and better than Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard (61.4) and Portland‚Äôs 3-and-D wing Robert Covington (59.3).

"Yeah he definitely does get to run with the 2nd units. Although this was a little surprising to me I looked [it up](https://www.pbpstats.com/totals/nba/player?Season=2020-21,2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;TeamId=1610612738&amp;StarterState=5v3,5v1,5v2,5v0,4v2,4v1,4v0,3v0,3v1,2v0,2v1,1v0,3v2,4v3,5v4) filtered by the number of times each guy got to play with at least one more starter on their team than the number of starters the opponent had on the court at that time.   This season and last Jayson Tatum has 816 of such minutes. Jaylen Brown has 684 the gap isnt as big as I expected. In other words I dont think there's a big gap in terms of how much time each guy gets to spend in favorable settings in terms of having more starters on the court than the opponent does at that time.  One thing I would say is that alot more teams do this kind of rotation where the star rests early plays the start of the 2nd than 10 years ago. So it's not necessarily the advantage it sounds."

Lmao not this crap. So adding Tatum to the game automatically adds 27 to Boston‚Äôs score right? Jaylen Brown would still shoot 30 times and Tatum‚Äôs shots would magically fit into the offense right? Thats definitely how it works good job bro
"I think if you swap Anthony Davis for Jaylen Brown and make Brown the second option on the Lakers then they're probably not winning the title either, and they're one of the deepest teams in the league. I think we have to at least entertain the idea that Brown is not good enough to be the second best player on a championship team, or at least he's not good enough yet."
"Yeah I need a bigger sample size with Jaylen Brown to really evaluate it but tbh having watched both closely for years Im really not surprised Tatum no Jaylen lineups easily beat Jaylen no Tatum lineups.   Now one thing is that Jaylen has taken an offensive leap this year so you want more sample size of this year alone. But at the same time I want to see what it looks like when the shooting samples start regressing he's not going to maintain 54% from mid range, 42% from 3 AND 78% at the rim. With the on/off data with Jaylen part of this is Jaylen is an overrated defender. Jaylen does the stuff that people notice on TV and looks cool like on ball defense, Tatum is far better at the stuff like help defense and rotations that matters more.   Tatum has always been one of those types that the analytics people liked even when 2-3 yrs ago his ISO data wasnt good and his strength wasnt as a shot creator per se. One of those guys where it's kind of why you have the impact metrics he does stuff you notice that dont always get encapsulated in a box score but that just help teams wins. Super scalable, fits any role, big positive on both ends of the court."
"It‚Äôs the same thing that‚Äôs starting to come up with Jaylen Brown. His on/off is frequently in the negatives, I believe -5 this year even as he‚Äôs had his best season so far. Not sure exactly what to make of it. I know he‚Äôs never exactly been an ‚Äúanalytics darling‚Äù, even dating back to college, but it‚Äôs still kinda weird to see"
9 point lead with 50 seconds left is not a guaranteed lead. It‚Äôs pretty good odds you win but hardly guaranteed. Lmao like Tracy McGrady‚Äôs most famous play(s) of his career is his 13 points in 33 seconds to win a game down by three possessions... And the Celtics are a good three point shooting team too. Not to mention Jaylen Brown literally had 42 points and we couldn‚Äôt stop him for most of the night...
"Kyrie, Harden, Middleton, Trae Young, Jaylen Brown to me seems like the list. Guys like Sexton or Brogdon even have a chance if their teams are still in playoff spots. I hope Lavine makes it but its unlikely."
Embiid is a monster but his damn is Jaylen brown a ridiculous player   Love his game
As of this year Jaylen Brown is a better basketball player than Ben Simmons. And it‚Äôs not that close lol
Cmon man. Ainge picked Jaylen Brown 3rd overall when he was a total projection. He didn‚Äôt get enamored with Fultz and not only stuck with his read that Tatum was the right pick but got a great 1st to trade down and still take his guy. Letting Hayward walk was an unforced error and yeah. they need a big but he‚Äôs a good GM.

Have you considered Jaylen ‚ÄúJaylen Brown‚Äù Brown??
"Yeah also in the running if Lakers can stay atop the west, but Embiid is putting up slightly better numbers and doesn't have AD on his team. There's a few other players who would also be in the running if they can get a top seed like Luka, Jaylen Brown or Jokic"
"What the fuck? Do you not realize how broad and negative of a generalization that is? That's genuinely super fucking disrespectful of you, and pretty idiotic to boot. ""They're dumb as fuck"" yeah just lump guys like Jaylen Brown into the assertion that these guys are not uneducated but aggressively unintelligent. Would you feel as comfortable calling a group of 450 white guys ""dumb as fuck""?"
Who do we get back Jayson Tatum or Jaylen Brown? ü§†
"Rondo, Paul Pierce, Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, KG  Dennis Johnson, IT, Ray Allen, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Robert Parish, Bill Walton"
"I mean, besides pulling off one of the best/most lopsided trades of recent NBA history and using the haul to draft Jaylen Brown &amp; Jayson Tatum and build a contender that's been to the Conference Finals 3 of the last 4 years I guess the Celtics have no vision/plan?"
"It's Tatum and he still has a gap on Jaylen. As good as JB has been this year he is a far less willing playmaker and often has tunnel vision. His mid range is elite but he goes to it too often and doesn't draw fouls at an elite rate and only makes 75% at the line when he gets there. Defensively he's a great man defender but Tatum is elite at help defence, rotations and playing the passing lanes and I think he consistently impacts the game more on that end. Offensively Tatum draws way more attention than Brown and is a very willing playmaker in these scenarios and this keeps the celtics offensive humming when they have been struggling for ball movement recently. Having an off the dribble 3pt PnR threat opens up so much for the team as it means he has to be trapped constantly. Tatum draws fouls at a similar rate but is shooting 87% at the line, and Tatum is a better 3pt shooter and is actually one of the elite 3pt shooters of the NBA. Yes Tatum struggles to finish inside at times but he's consistently the more impactful player on both ends."
"People defending that argument is ridiculous  I don't care what off the court stuff Harden did, he's the 2nd best player in the East bar none and should be an All Star lock. Him having guys like Jaylen Brown or Bam (I forgot who it was) as locks over him is ridiculous  [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lj9tbl/zach\_lowe\_says\_his\_10\_eastern\_conference\_all\_star/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lj9tbl/zach_lowe_says_his_10_eastern_conference_all_star/)"
All of them besides Jaylen Brown
"You really dont understand what subjective means lmao. you cant be this dense.   &gt;players such as Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Khris Middleton are clearly better and he's on the same level as players like Devin Booker and DeMar DeRozan (who is crazy underrated these days). Making your teammates better is a real thing.  What is this based on oh your opinions lol.....right again you lack comprehension. Even your points are inconsistent and you dont realize how off your logic is lol.    Brown, Irving, Harden, Kris, all play with MVP caliber players on their team, and have played with multiple Allstars on their teams throughout their entire careers.  Since you value winning so much, Young, Beal are both players who have never played on a winning NBA team, and their stats also dont transfer to wins. Beal is an older, less efficient shooter and doesnt translates to wins. Young is younger but is a lot less efficient in shooting, is completely terrible a defensive to the point where the team went through lengths to cover his flaws and doesnt translate to winning.  ( Some more inconsistency in your logic). Devon Booker and Demar are both leading their teams to the playoffs on winning teams....Hahaha.   It's so easy to rebuttal you because you continue to base everything on your own opinions but you're very illogical and inconsistent with your arguments lol. You've been exposed lmao"
Jaylen Brown for me
"I shouldn't bite but I will.   &gt;Dude learn the definition of Subjective.  Learn that things are absolute.  &gt;LaVine is now averaging a career-high 28.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 5.3 assists while shooting 51.8% overall, 42.5% on 3-pointers, and 86.3% on free throws. His true shooting percentage sits at a whopping 65.2%, which is fifth among players with a usage rate over 25 (he‚Äôs right around 30). Truly impressive stuff, a combination of offensive volume and efficiency Eclipsing the best of Derrick Rose and Jimmy Butler Bulls seasons into a historic stratosphere. Four players this season (Kawhi, KD, LaVine, Jokic) are averaging 25-5-5 or better with 50% from the field and 40% from 3 Only four players in NBA history had done that before this season.....he is also only 25 and continuing to develop. really great for young player who hasn't even entered his prime.  Yes you've posted the same numbers three times. They are incredible numbers. No argument here. I'm not debating what his scoring, assist, and rebounds numbers are. I'm not arguing what his shooting splits. I'm not saying they are bad. I'm not saying they at the expense of the Bulls' offense. I'm saying despite Lavine's great numbers, players such as Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Khris Middleton are clearly better and he's on the same level as players like Devin Booker and DeMar DeRozan (who is crazy underrated these days). Making your teammates better is a real thing. Playing defense is a real thing. It's hard to quantify that in a stat, but the stats that do try do that show Lavine isn't on the level you want him to be. You can see it when the game is happening. Do you honestly not see where Lavine needs to improve as a play maker or on defense?  &gt;Are you delusional? you've been exposed lol. Nothing you say is backed up and you continue to think that your opinions are an actual source of evidence for your argument.  Exposed? Again, I've shown numbers and gave examples from games, not sure what else you need.  &gt;All you do is try and attack my character which you know nothing about because you dont have an argument. Making assumptions about people also discredit you, its just very lazy and subjective. Just stick to objective facts, kid  When have I attacked you're character? You're the one saying things like ""delusional"", ""kid"", exposed"" and other demeaning phrases. I don't care at all, I just find it funny you're saying I'm the one attacking your character. You're the one making assumptions, I've never questioned anything you've said, I'm just addressing what you have said.  If you want to stick to objective facts then fine, the objective fact is Lavine has never been on a winning team. That should end the argument right there. We aren't discussing what Lavine is averaging or whether he should be an all-star, we are discussing is Lavine is a ""winning"" player, and if were aren't adding context to the objective facts, then Lavine is the very definition of a losing player.  Now obviously that's ridiculous and you need to look at his team, just like you need to look at how he gets his stats, now just what his final stats are."
Jaylen Brown
"Grant, Wood, Jaylen Brown all solid options."
"Strip club jokes are tired, and yet shitting on fan bases for not trading Harden isn't? I mean the dude went maskless during a pandemic at the club during the NBA season. Lol.   Anyways, on a serious note, yes I would've loved Harden on the Celtics. There were only a few users on our sub-reddit that seemed inclined on bringing him here, while 90% of the fanbase was convinced he was washed. (I lol'ed hard at that.) But at the end of the day, I'm 100% okay with either decision. Jaylen Brown is looking like a stud, and that's what it would've cost."
Kyrie and Beal will likely start with Jaylen Brown and Harden behind in 3rd/4th.
"My thinking would be that the absolute locks are:  1. Giannis 2. KD 3. Emiid 4. Tatum 5. Beal 6. Kyrie 7. Harden  I'm genuinely not convinced Harden deserves it, but we all know he's going to get in so I'll chalk him up as a lock.   Then I assume Zach LaVine, Trae Young and Jaylen Brown gets the nod so we're down to two spots left. Lots of competition for those two spots, and at the moment, that's only 1 player from each of the top two teams. Usually they find a way to shoe-horn in two players from the top teams. Middleton is easy, but 76ers is a tougher call.   It'll be interesting to see."
"Lot here firstly on Justise Winslow I think there a few issues   1) There was a time I was also once really high on Winslow but I think that ship has set sail. Injuries are a big issue. But beyond that his skill set really is much more a 6th man/3rd wing off the bench type. Needs the ball in his hands to really have an impact. Nobody guards him on the perimeter. And for a wing he's actually quite bad finishing at the rim. Also his playmaking is good for a wing but relative to guards its nothing crazy I dont think he's a better playmaker than Marcus Smart who youre right you dont want him being the best playmaker on your team.   2)   &gt;Barnes is your Jeff Green-type small-ball 5.   Honestly I think Jaylen Brown is probably bulkier and better at guarding bigger guys. He's closer to a small ball 5 to me. But Brad has never really shown much desire even last year when his 5 best players were Jaylen/Hayward/Tatum/Kemba/Smart to go small like that. Just not who he really is. As a changeup to close games late you can do it once in a while but I think Brad tends to like having a C and traditional rim protector for how he structures his defense.   3)   &gt;Tatum is honestly this odd blend of Harden/KD where he's not as good as either of them at their strengths.  I've comp'd Tatum to pre injury Grant Hill in the past, not sure I see Harden beyond the step back 3s element can see Durant some. I agree his playmaking isnt there to be a no 1 guy yet but there's also consistent gradual improvement with it. Beyond that though in terms of potential improvement, [Ive monitored this for years with him](http://nbashotcharts.com/zoned?id=-5546440) there's a big gap in his %s on shots outside the paint from the left vs right side of the court. Like 45% vs 36% for his career I havent seen a split like it over a large sample size before. And I dont have a good explanation for it. But alot of those difficult jumpers he takes, it really just comes down to whether he's on the left vs right side of the court in terms of whether they are good shots. And Im surprised tbh I havent really seen teams in the playoffs gameplan around this directional tendency.   4)  &gt;I'm treating Kemba as if he's closer to the player he is now as opposed to the player he used to be, and if that's really the case like I think it is, the Celtics are fucked.  Yeah....so this is tough. The gravity he provides coming off pick and rolls is really important to this offense its part of why for this team to reach its ceiling he needs to be out there and Im not necessarily in favor of trying to build lineups without him for key stretches in the playoffs he's too important/unique. But that said I agree with you physically he's not gonna get better with age. Was talking about this with a celtics fan I know last week ultimately we both kind of concluded if your Boston you kind of just have to hope you get lucky and Kemba turns it around and becomes 80% of what he was last yr. Are the odds of it happening great no but I think it's the only way they end up having a high enough ceiling to really contend at the top level potentially. I just think you are capping your ceiling too much putting in someone like Justise Winslow instead of him.   &gt;a guard who is great on offense but bad on defense is worth it, like can you win at the highest level with Kemba Walker as your point guard defensively?   Depends on specifics if its an Isaiah Thomas level defender this becomes an issue. But for someone like Kemba who I think is just a generic poor defender not some absolute disaster yes I do think you can win with that. I think  GSW wouldve been fine if Steph was a worse defender. San Antonio won with Tony Parker. The Celtics defensive rating when Kemba was on the court vs Toronto was 100. Vs Miami it was 112-113 is that great no but the Lakers beat Denver in 5 games with a 113 defensive rating in today's NBA its not a death sentence.   One thing Ive noticed over the years is that teams can excessively hunt a weaker guard to their own detriment. You get out of your own offense too much and there's an elements of fools gold with it you stagnate your offense too much worrying too much about trying to go at that one defender. It's part of why to me the most detrimental guard defenders to have aren't necessarily the small ones who can be overpowered 1 v1 its the ones who are horrible with help defense, give no effort and are lost off ball. Those are the ones who hurt you the most to me, it's why Im not surprised guys like Bradley Beal end up at the bottom of defensive metrics every year.   &gt;John Collins would be nice, but I don't see him getting moved. Thad Young  Yeah I was gonna bring up Thad also that's a good one he can let you downsize the way you were referring to earlier also. I actually do think JC does get moved before the summer it's just how much do you give up. Atl probably really pushes for Marcus Smart I tend to lean against doing that if Boston ultimately"
"Grant, Boucher, Jaylen Brown all have claims to being MIP, but he's in that mix for sure"
How is Tatum a SF when he starts next to Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart?
It‚Äôs like that Jaylen Brown stat the other day. Lou or Jamal could have had 40 points in less than 30 minutes but they most likely played more than 30 minutes so then they don‚Äôt meet the criteria
"A lot of comments in this thread about how Bill is a casual, how the Celtics are short handed and that the problem comes down to not having the guys. While all this may be true (it is for the most part IMO), it is all ignoring a larger point-- Stevens has not developed any young talent other than Tatum/Brown. Here are their picks:   2020: Pritchard (26) and Nesmith (14)   2019: Langford (14) and Grant Williams (22)  2018: Timelord (27)   2017: Tatum (3)  2016: Jaylen (3), Yabusele (16)   I think that more than a fair share of the blame needs to be put on Ainge because his track record drafting outside the lottery is bad. That said, Stevens certainly plays a role in selecting and developing the talent. The irony is that the Celtics problems are the as the Pats-- shitty drafting in the late first round."
"I would take CJ, Booker, and Middleton over him. Maybe Jaylen Brown also."
"There is no doubt Europe has the advantage in the front court, but The gap between AD and Jokic isn‚Äôt as big when you factor in defense, and you are underselling the overall disadvantage Europe has.  Europe has a great team, but the US has an insane team. Lebron, Steph, and Kawhi are too much regardless, and the US ‚ÄúB team‚Äù PG, Kyrie, KD, Dame, Kat would probably beat the Euro starters too. That‚Äôs without even including Harden, Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Jaylen Brown, etc."
"I think he's worthy, the question is: who are you kicking off this list?   Giannis  KD  Harden  Kyrie  Embiid  Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Trae Young  Bam  Beal  Khris Middleton  Zach Lavine   And that's without mentioning Gordon Hayward, Sabonis/Turner from Indy, FVV/Lowry/Siakam or Vucevic plus whoever else I am forgetting (and I am undoubtedly forgetting some good candidates).  All-Star is no joke this year in either conference."
https://www.spotrac.com/nba/boston-celtics/jaylen-brown-20208/  He is in Y1 of a 4 years deal.
Hunh? Jaylen Brown has 3 years left on his deal and 2 years until they have to make the supermax decision.
"No it‚Äôs not, only the starters get a fan vote and now the fan vote is only 50% of the overall selection vote. Ja isn‚Äôt a starter, and coaches pick the reserves.  And let‚Äôs see: Giannis Embiid Beal KD Irving Tatum Jaylen Brown Sabonis Harden Randle Trae  Zach Lavine  Honorable mention: Middleton, Tobias Harris, Vucevic, Jerami Grant, Lowry, Sexton, Siakam, Simmons, Terry Rozier, Gordon Hayward, Brogdon  So right now, I‚Äôd say bam doesn‚Äôt make it"
I don't even think that would do it considering they didn't want to give up Jaylen Brown for Harden  the only way Brown and Tatum are let go at this point is if if they demand a trade
Better than Jaylen Brown
"Alright. Firstly, I wouldn‚Äôt say Durant and Kahwi are much clutch than Kyrie. Clearly much better players but not more clutch. What have they done to be considered more clutch than Kyrie? 2016 Is not the only clutch shot Kyrie has, he makes game winners every season. He has so many clutch moments and if you want me to point them out, I will.   Durant is clutch but his reputation as a clutch player is overrated because of 2017 and 2018. Both of those Game 3 shots were great shots but there was little to no pressure. Before that, in 2016 he choked away the 3-1 lead to GS by shooting 10/32 in game 6 at home. In 2013 against Memphis he was awful in those 4th quarters as they were eliminated.  He scored like 8 points in the last 3 total 4th quarters of that series. Total.  If you tell me why you think KD and Kahwi are more clutch than Kyrie, and make a good point, I may agree with you.   What player am I making Kyrie out to be? I have clearly said so many times that I understand why anyone would take PG over Kyrie or Jaylen Brown over Kyrie. PGs defense is way better than Kyries and he‚Äôs taller and a much better rebounder obviously. I just don‚Äôt think you can count on him to be the offensive player that he usually is when it matters most and he‚Äôs proven to be a choker. That‚Äôs a huge thing for me. Paul George as far as talent is definitely better than Kyrie. As far as talent he should be a top 5 player but there‚Äôs a reason that he‚Äôs not. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying and that‚Äôs not unreasonable, neither does it show that I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about. It‚Äôs just my opinion and it‚Äôs different than yours. I never stated where I think Kyrie ranks in the NBA so I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôm making him out to be a player he‚Äôs not, I just think he‚Äôs definitely, undoubtedly, better than Bradley BealüòÇ"
"It isn't dumb in any facet if your goal is to win a Championship. 2 years for a bonafide superstar who elevates everyone around him instead of a lower tier allstar who won't ever be as good as James Harden. This is a no brainer if you wanna win; I'm tired of homers insulting Harden with thinking Brown (or even worse, Heat fans with Herro) are worth more than Harden  Only someone as stupid as a Celtics fan would covet all his worthless assets in the hope they'll all develop into major Championship contributors on your team instead of taking the necessary risks to win a Championship. You're all over doing damage control for Ainge because you're coping with the fact your philosophy has majorly failed. **Most of these assets in the past 5 years haven't panned out to be Championship core pieces or have left and done even better after leaving Boston, like guys like Terry Rozier.**   Dumping Kemba, and a couple of picks along with Brown as the centerpiece would be more than enough for Harden and Tucker, but you guys scoffed at the idea because why would you trade your 'young core' for a bonafide Top 5 player over the past 6 years? What a stupid idea. You guys are so insistent on fleecing teams and hoarding picks you won't even make basic, common sense moves like a S&amp;T with a player who's gonna leave anyway for a Center who's a perfect fit your team because you held out to try to get even more than what you were offered.  The only contenders are the ones who took real risks to win a Championship. The Lakers did with AD, the Clips did with PG to assure Kawhi's signing and the Nets did with James Harden... and it's going to work out for any one of those teams this year, and it already has for one of them last year.  Remember this, because this is the last time I'm gonna talk about the Celtics situation; Jaylen Brown (along with Tatum) is the one who'll be gone in a few years anyway (through a trade or FA) when he realizes he isn't winning shit with your obsession with hoarding warchests of assets instead of taking the right risks. **The Thunder thought they would had Russ, Harden, KD and Ibaka for longer**, who are muuuuch better than what you have now, and they left before they ever won a Championship. What makes you think it won't happen to you?"
Big Dick Bey went for 7 for 7 from three (NBA record for rookie)   and put Jaylen Brown in the torture chamber
"This is a terrible take. Maybe if your the Lakers you can do this because your team always gets the big free agents based off of location alone but it‚Äôs mind numbingly stupid to give up Jaylen Brown, a 24 year old player on contract for the next 43 years for James Harden, a 31 year old who probably wouldn‚Äôt stay with the team."
You are out of your fucking mind if you think Langford has a higher ceiling than Jaylen Brown. That‚Äôs such a fuckin putrid take. I‚Äôm not sure you should even be allowed to make comments about basketball anymore after that.   Wow. Thanks for the laugh though.
nah man Ainge won a chip back in the day as a GM and he picked Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown so he's totally immune from any criticism
They need a Center. I think Jaylen Brown for Aaron Baynes is a fair trade
"Lonzo, Jaylen Brown, Jimmy Butler, Aaron Gordon, and AD at the 5"
"Hell, throw in Jaylen Brown to match salary."
$1 Lonzo  $4 Jaylen Brown  $4 Jimmy Butler  $1 Aaron Gordon  $5 Jokic
"&gt; The same Miami team that took Lebron + AD to 6 games without Bam or Dragic?  I mean Lakers probably should have swept them or won in 5. Lakers got decently unlucky in game 5 and didn't really show up for game 3.   &gt;Saying the bucks are 5th best in the East is just laughable dude, like come on. You can say the celtics beat the bucks but we beat them 4-1 in the semis the year before. Granted, could they have? Of course. Because prior years results don't dictate the next years - but that's not your argument.  Not really. Celtics lost in 6 and looked like the better team for large stretches. Obviously things change year to year. Tatum got considerably better and so did Jaylen Brown. Giannis? No. He did not get considerably better from 2019 to 2021. Every team I mentioned had the ability to form the Giannis wall.    &gt;I'm not sure what you're basing ""that is a statistical fact"" on, as there would be a variety of ways you can measure or define variability.   It's actually fairly simple. Take regular season winning % and see how that is correlated with playoff success (measure a). Then figure out elo scores and measure that against actual regular season success vs playoff success. It ends up being pretty stable. It's why we in the last 20 years we've seen a crappy 9-7 Giants team beat a great Patriots team, but have yet to see a 6 seed win a championship. Hell it's rare to see a team not considered top 3 going into the playoffs win.   2020: Lakers (1-3 favorite)   2019: Consensus dark horse, won because of injuries   2018: Warriors: Duh   2017: Warriors: Duh   2016: Cavs: Preseason favorites   2015: Warriors: Top 3 favorite   2014: Spurs: Top 2 favorite   2013: Heat: #1 favorite   2012: Heat: #1 Favorite   2011: Mavs: Somewhat of a surprise, won like 19 of last 20 games tho   2010: LAkers: #1 Favorite   2009: Lakers: Top 2 favorite   2008: Celtics: #1 favorite   2007: Spurs: Top 3 favorite   2006: Heat: Top 4 Favorite (52-30 with 18 games of .500 ball without  Shaq)   2005: Spurs Top 2 Favorite   2004: Pistons: Decent surprise here since Lakers were heavy favorites, but  still top 4 favorites   2003: Spurs: Top 3 favorites   2002: Lakers: Duh   2001: Lakers: Duh   2000: Lakers: Top 3 favorites     &gt;But the simple truth of the matter is in any playoff series a team that's shooting hot from 3 can beat a better team, and a 2 year sample size of a players postseason performance is never going to be a good indicator lol  Sure but the point is Giannis has fundamental flaws that force his team to rely heavily on 3 point shots that are pretty well contested. It is exposed every time he's gone up against a good playoff team."
but what if boston trades kemba for drummond and jaylen brown just turns into lebron (6'8 forward playing point)
"Yea, but there's 0 reason to bring up the C's. We have literally no way of getting him outside of throwing Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, or Kemba Walker at them"
"Yep, no way in hell am I trading Jaylen Brown for James Harden.  He's on a terrific contract.  Has a great head on his shoulders, keeps his nose clean, etc. etc."
"The Fact that Terry Rozier, rookie Jayson Tatum and 2nd year Jaylen Brown marched through the playoffs and just about made the NBA finals is crazy"
"Nah I'm a Celtics fan and everything /u/dropdatdurkadurk is saying is on point with Tatum and Brown. They're good compliments for each other, but Tatum is the more impactful player, Jaylen is the better individual player, and everything Jaylen does, you can see with your eyes, which is why he pops to more of the casual fans."
"I thought Jaylen Brown would peak as a elite role player/borderline all star, think prime Iggy level.  Easily wrong on that.  I thought Okogie would continue improving and eventually be a least a competent offensive player.  Looks bad so far.  I was wrong on Wiggins in GSW.  I thought he would be his old inconsistent self that will have a lot of bad nights and some good nights.  Instead he turned a corner defensively and found some consistency.    There's a lot of other stuff but yea that's off the top of my head."
Nuggets have the best player out of the 6. Celtics have the better core. Both jaylen brown and Tatum are better than Murray and smart is better than MPJ(but he has a lot of potential for growth).
Jokic is the best player here by far but he's also over 3 years older than Tatum. Jaylen Brown is a lot better than Murray or MPJ. I like the Nuggets core better for the next 2-3 years but after that I prefer the Celtics core.

"It's not something people care about in Europe or South America though. I agree it's a trend in the middle east, especially with the Palestinian conflict, and in general in predominantly Muslim countries, but that's arguably more religious than anything. Nobody cares about what Messi thinks outside of the football pitch in Spain and Argentina where he is a God, same goes for Ronaldo. It's true that they are excessively venerated, but they aren't looked to for political guidance. It's pretty clear that they're not educated enough to be guides in that sense. The idea that one should care about or even worse follow the political ideas of a professional athlete to me is baffling. Of course there are a ton of exceptions (LeBron, Jaylen Brown) but in general a pro athlete is not competent enough to be a political guide."
"They should use the TPE, but Vuc is going to command at least one first-round pick, if not more. Why would they give up a package like that when it's not going to make them title contenders this year. Vuc is also not a cheap contract and has two years left. Do you really want to be paying Kemba and Vuc $60 million in two years when Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are starting to make decisions about their future? It's too early into Tatum and Brown's careers with the Celtics to make an all-in move like that."
"AD would never have re-signed and would have cost Brown. Paul George would likely have cost Brown. Kawhii would never have re-signed and would have cost Brown.  until recently, the *treasure chest* was Jaylen Brown. he was good enough to be attractive to other teams but not so good that they thought they were asking for too much.  It's almost like the only reason Boston is in as good a position for the next 5 years as they are is because they didn't make foolish, short-sighted trades."
Jaylen Brown &gt;&gt;&gt; Demar DeRozan. Over the next 5-10 years at least.
I watched the game and let me tell you that Garrison Mathews had the best 0 point performance I've ever seen live. Man got 3 steals/deflections on Jaylen Brown in a row. Fun to watch him play defense
"&gt;No it's more that we know our team situation better than you do...   &gt;   &gt;The trade included Smart so take him out of your listYou now have 3 players. One of which is coming back from a serious knee injury and is in wait-and-see mode.You now have 2 players.  You coulda probably gotten away with Brown &amp; Kemba for Harden considering how Harden tanked his value so hard to make it affordable. Include some filler &amp; picks and you likely get Harden and PJ Tucker, which is a veeeerrry good haul  &gt;Yeah Tatum + Harden + ? - picks (so we can't go grab a role player) = definitely a championshop contender.../s  Yes. Considering the Nets then don't get Harden and you do, you're better than Philly and just as good as Brooklyn. Harden is one of the best floor raisers of all time, up there with LeBron, Steve Nash, etc.  &gt;You mean that team that had Capella, Ariza, Tucker and Gordon all playing some of the best basketball of their careers?   &gt;   &gt;Who are Boston's depth pieces to fill out the roster?  They were all playing the best basketball of their career then, and now they're not...... I wonder why.... who is the common denominator for all their success? It couldn't have been the superstar who elevates every role player he plays with as he's been carrying rosters averaging 30 &amp; 10 for years now, could it?  &gt;Yeah... imagine... all those good defensive pieces we have...We're the 15th defense in the league right now and you want to trade 2 of our 4 plus defenders for James Harden.  Harden, Smart, Tatum, Tucker and Theiss/TT is much better than what you have right now. Hell, if you played the S&amp;T properly, you coulda had Myles Turner for fucking pennies. Didn't Turner come with McDermott and a 1st? Or something like that?  And Ainge hesitated likely because he wanted even *more* for a player who was gonna leave anyway? Hayward went to Charlotte because you guys took too long to make an easy decision that woulda elevated your team.  Imagine, I know this is absolute best case scenario but:  PG: Harden  SG: Smart  SF: Tatum  PF: Tucker  C: Turner  Top 3 team.  &gt;That's stupid. Siakam was the #2 on a championship team. Jaylen is more than qualified.You don't Billie King yourself for 2 uncompetitive seasons.  Siakam was the #3 behind Kawhi &amp; Lowry. Just because Siakam averaged a lotta points in the Finals doesn't mean he was the #2 when Lowry was the leader, playmaker, best shooter and heart/soul of that Raps team who was almost as integral as Kawhi. He was even better than Kawhi in some of those games at Oracle... Brown isn't as good as that Lowry.  Also, if KD, Klay, Iggy and Looney are healthy, Siakam is getting clamped tf up. So is Brown. That's an unfair comparison.  Now put Brown on any of the Main 3 Championship Frontrunners right now. Lakers, Clips, Nets. How is he the 2nd best player on any of those teams?"
"&gt; Stop it. Cs fans have been confident 20 year old Tatum Kyrie and Horford was a championship caliber team but now Harden, Tatum, Kemba (if you keep him) and Smart aren't? BS, that's just another excuse  No it's more that we know our team situation better than you do...  1. The trade included Smart so take him out of your list 2. You now have 3 players. One of which is coming back from a serious knee injury and is in wait-and-see mode. 3. You now have 2 players.  Yeah Tatum + Harden + ? - picks (so we can't go grab a role player) = definitely a championshop contender.../s  &gt;People forgot, even if he underperforms at times in the playoffs, Harden with CP3 &amp; Capela was up 3-2 on the KD Warriors before CP3 got hurt.  You mean that team that had Capella, Ariza, Tucker and Gordon all playing some of the best basketball of their careers?  Who are Boston's depth pieces to fill out the roster?  &gt;Now imagine Harden, Tatum, Kemba, Smart and some good defensive pieces around them  Yeah... imagine... all those good defensive pieces we have...We're the 15th defense in the league right now and you want to trade 2 of our 4 plus defenders for James Harden.  &gt;You have to take that risk because 4-5 more years with Jaylen Brown as you 2nd best player has no shot no matter what.  1. That's stupid. Siakam was the #2 on a championship team. Jaylen is more than qualified. 2. You don't Billie King yourself for 2 uncompetitive seasons."
"A) Jaylen isn't a fringe all star, he's playing at an All NBA level  B) Did you ever think Brown would be the player he is today? He's only 24 and has still so much room to grow.   C) James Harden the guy who's never even made the finals?   D) it would take Brown, Smart and more to get him which would leave you with zero depth.   E) James Harden will be making $47 million at age 34. Jaylen at age 26 will be making $27 million. That Harden contract is terrible"
trade Jaylen Brown
We have had our top guys for a total of 21 minutes this whole season. Lets see what we look like healthy. James Harden is not worth Jaylen Brown at this point
"Jaylen Brown has played like an all NBA player this year. He's 24, a better defender and on a WAY better contract...."
"There is really no point in comparing them...  BUT IF YOU INSIST:  Starting with defense. Brown is a bit better on ball, he‚Äôs actually fantastic, but Tatum is great there too. Last season, Brown was miles ahead in on ball defense but he has regressed in the sense that he is back to jumping on a ton of fakes. Still great in that regard. Off-ball. Tatum is miles ahead here. This may be because of coaching or may just be Brown, but he helps *WAY* too much. It always either ends up with him fouling the guy he helps on or an open three. Tatum isn‚Äôt some amazing off ball defender but he is still above average. In the past I would 100% say Brown was the better defender, but this season Tatum has definitely been better on that side of the ball.  Onto offense. Let me just start by saying either of these guys can just get his. But, Brown is the much more efficient ISO scorer (not actually looking at stats, just more of an eye test thing). He has cooled down a little from his insane, historic start from mid range, but he is still elite there. Tatum in the ISO forces up a LOT of bad shots. I‚Äôm not completely mad about this because I‚Äôm the future I am sure he will make them at a higher rate, but I would definitely rather him chill out on those a little for now. All this majorly helps out Brown in the argument considering Brad Stevens doesn‚Äôt really run an offense and is a big ISO coach (which is infuriating). Last season, a lot of times we actually ran a good offense and Tatum thrives in this (especially the month he averages like 30). Tatum is amazing with any space whatsoever so plays that gives him this will work. Everytime. Right now, this season, he is being passed the ball with a defender hanging on his back and it ends up with a bad shot. Finishing. For now I would give the slight edge to Jaylen. Jayson started off the season really bad at finishing but has definitely picked it up a lot. Both are pretty good here but I would give it to Brown. Mid range. Brown. Three point. Tatum. Both are good at each, but both are also a good bit better then the other in their respective categories. Overall, in this offense Brown is given the advantage. But it‚Äôs not like it makes Tatum ineffective as he still puts up incredible numbers.  Rebounding. They are basically a wash here. Not much to say about it.  Playmaking. This easily goes to Tatum. Brown has ok assist numbers, but a lot of that is from drive and kicks drawing multiple defenders. This is still playmaking I guess, but it doesn‚Äôt require an insane amount of skill. Tatum literally runs point sometimes.   Overall if you are starting a team I think everytime you pick Tatum. He is still like two years younger and can easily and justifiable be argued as the better player.  But either way you go you can definitely make an argument for all around player. Personally, as of now I would go with Tatum but I can easily see someone picking Brown.  In the end, we have both so honestly who cares."
Jaylen Brown is better.  That was my hot take to start the season.  They are similar offensively but Brown is far better defensively
"First off, we're talkin about Championship teams *right now*, not 2 years ago. If you wanna talk about teams from 2 years ago, then we have to use 2019 Jaylen Brown for comparison  Even then, Jaylen Brown *now* is not quite as good as Lowry then, especially when you insert him into the Lowry role. Lowry's BBIQ, leadership, playmaking and range were instrumental in that win and he was better than Kawhi at a lotta times in the Finals, especially when he was raining bombs from 3 in Oracle. Jaylen Brown now is on a statistically unsustainable hot streak but will cool off by the end of the year.  You're the one who made the Braindead take bud. Without all the intangibles Lowry brings the Raps aren't making it out of the 2nd round.  Now put 2021 Jaylen Brown on the Lakers instead of AD. Or on the Clippers instead of 50/40/90 Paul George. Lmao at thinkin Brown is anywhere near those players"
"We still bagging on the Celtics for not trading for Paul George? It would have required giving up Jaylen Brown who‚Äôs arguably a starter for the ASG this season. AD would have required giving up Tatum and Brown and there‚Äôs no guarantee that he sticks around after last season, especially if Kyrie still bolts for the Nets. Also, if memory serves correctly the Celtics weren‚Äôt allowed to trade for AD until the offseason due to the Rose rule. The Lakers made the move before the Celtics were even allowed to get involved. There are a lot more questions around Myles Turner but the Celtics can‚Äôt trade for him unless Hayward consents to the deal, which he might not have done."
Lmao what a brain dead take. Jaylen Brown is 100% good enough to be a second option of a championship team.
idk but Jaylen Brown had like 31 points in 19 minutes against us
"Brown is better, the media likes the Tatum hype. I think brown is more consistent and is a better all-around player though. People just like to compare Tatum to Kobe because they worked out together.  Uhhh, Na bruh... give me Jaylen any day."
"&gt;I don‚Äôt think that was an option though, Charlotte offered a bigger bag to Hayward so why would he accept a sign and trade?  Revisionist history  Hayward went to Charlotte AFTER he couldn't get a deal done for a S&amp;T in Indiana, which is a place he's preferred for a long time. Charlotte swooped in with a deal after they realize the Cs were sitting on their fuckin hands  &gt;And with Harden, the biggest concern was his contract. If the Celtics weren‚Äôt able to win with him and he left after 2 years, they‚Äôd be completely fucked - and i‚Äôm not entirely convinced JT+ Harden would have been enough to beat the Lakers/Clips/Nets (even with just KD and Kyrie), hell even the sixers this year  Stop it. Cs fans have been confident 20 year old Tatum Kyrie and Horford was a championship caliber team but now Harden, Tatum, Kemba (if you keep him) and Smart aren't? BS, that's just another excuse  **Even if you're not a shoo-in for a ring, you still take that risk because you have 2 years of prime James Harden and if you don't take him then either Philly or Brooklyn (your 2 biggest rivals) will most definitely take him.** Harden on your team would be easily better than the Sixers (the Sixers aren't a Championship team), and just as good as Brooklyn, if not better if things gel well. Then you gotta deal with LA   **People forgot, even if he underperforms at times in the playoffs, Harden with CP3 &amp; Capela was up 3-2 on the KD Warriors before CP3 got hur**t... Now imagine Harden, Tatum, Kemba, Smart and some good defensive pieces around them and a good system under Stevens (and not 'do everything for us Harden' under MDA). You guys are Championship caliber. **You have to take that risk because 4-5 more years with Jaylen Brown as you 2nd best player has no shot no matter what.**"
"&gt; Tatums superior feel for the game on both ends is also evident there‚Äôs nothing surprising about how Tatum beats Jaylen in the impact metrics every year  As a Nets fan, I think you're crazy for typing that. Brown has one of the best ""feels"" for the game I've seen in years. He reminds me of Lowry. Always at the right place at the right time and it's fucking annoying. With Tatum, it literally comes down to ""is he making his jumpshots?"" Then he's scary and a threat. If not, im not worried about him impacting the game. Brown is the opposite   &gt;Let‚Äôs not talk about defense either. Jaylen has a good defensive reputation because he looks the part and plays good post defense [bur this type of stuff happens with him on defense](https://twitter.com/raptorsrepublic/status/1360027636379095041?s=21) ALL the time.  One example means jackshit.   &gt; Both nick nurse and spolestra went at his off ball defense in the playoffs last year it‚Äôll happen again this year  No they didn't lol? Spolestra abused the middle and Adabayo while the Celtics ran around chasing the Heat's 3 point shooters"
"&gt; The flaw to that is it would have cost them Jaylen Brown.  They‚Äôd have another banner in the rafters, so it‚Äôd have been worth it"
"The flaw to that is it would have cost them Jaylen Brown.  In a world where KD and Klay don't get injured, Kawhi, Tatum and Irving were not going to beat the Warriors.  Can't rely on two massive injuries to get a title.  In that case the Celtics would just be Tatum right now and that'd be even worse."
"Totally agree. People overestimate his driving ability and mid range shooting. He's not elite at either of those, but his deep shooting is definitely among the leagues best. Physically he looks like someone that would be good at driving and finishing at the rim but he's not. He doesn't have the greatest fast twitch explosiveness in the lane compared to like jaylen brown for example and he's not super crafty with his touch like luka"
"Delusional that someone can have an argument to vote for Jaylen Brown over Harden? I don't even agree with Lowe, I'm just saying that he's not a fucking idiot for accounting for different things. At least name a stat for how I'm being delusional or something.  Jesus, it's the All Star vote, people can vote for who they want. I disagree with Simmons putting Dame and Luka ahead of Steph, but I don't think he's an idiot."
"I still can't get over how indignant Celts fans were over passing up on a S&amp;T for Myles Turner because.... reasons  That extra draft pick you traded wasn't gonna be worth missing out on a player who perfectly fits your team, the $18 mil Turner cost wasn't much to give up and all these excuses that your young 2nd rookie will eventually turn into a superstar given time and isn't worth trading for Turner is BS  The mental gymnastics some people engaged in to not trade for Harden when he was at his cheapest value was absolutely ridiculous. 'Hurts team chemistry' or 'this 2nd year player who had a nice couple playoff games is too valuable to trade' are absolute BS.   **Harden is a superstar worth more than Tyler Herro and some filler, worth more than Simmons, Thybulle, Maxey and picks and is worth more than Jaylen Brown and filler**"
Jaylen Brown is legitimately better than him (and should be getting hype as a top 15 player). He's clearly surpassed Tatum as a scorer and defender. Tatum is still the better facilitator as of now though.
"Total historical revisionism, people were clowning Ainge for passing on Markelle Fultz to take Jayson Tatum. People were *destroying* Ainge for taking Jaylen Brown.   Most players who are drafted into the NBA don't pan out (how many second round picks can you name right now other than Draymond and Jokic). Ainge isn't perfect but people shitting on him for not drafting starters or 6MOY players in the teens and 20s of the draft are mistaken."
the lack of consideration for Jaylen Brown in here is making me sick.
What happened to the Celtics? I remember them having a good start with Jaylen Brown having a career year did injuries/covid affect them?
"What do you think they need? I don't really understand why they're not better, with Brown and Tatum playing so well. I have become a fan of Jaylen Brown with the leap he's taken this year. What does this team need to be a contender?"
Jaylen Brown has shown a clear jump in his FTA this season. Tatum still at the same level as last season  From the eye test in the games I watched he looks much more aggressive
"Michael Redd is one - Dude was known as a lockdown defender in college. Kawhi is the most recent example of this one.     Edit: Jaylen Brown, Rozier, Bosh, Griffin"
Jaylen Brown
He singlehandedly won them 10+ more games than they should have won that one year they had the Jaylen Brown pick
bruh you‚Äôre still crying bout this LOOOL go back to your sub &amp; complain about how detroit is too physical for jaylen brown w the rest of you pussies
Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown
"If not worse this trade is as bad. Harden, Durant, and Ky will all get angry and leave when they have a chance. That means that the Nets won‚Äôt have a single pick, no Kyrie, no Durant, and no Harden without a single way to get young players for the future. Just like the Celtics getting Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum the Rockets will be able to get top 3 picks yearly while still being a good team centered around Wood. It‚Äôs the same situation as the Celtics. It will be a rebuild where the team doesn‚Äôt even need to rebuild."
"??? This is like saying imagine Bucks won‚Äôt make the finals for last season. We know the ceiling on this Nets team is a championship, but statistically there are other contenders in the east so it‚Äôs more likely Nets don‚Äôt make the finals than the Nets do. At least I feel like that‚Äôs the reasonable thing to say. Philly and Milwaukee are good man, and of course we can‚Äôt count out Miami and even Boston since they got that Jaylen Brown level up"
"&gt;I don't mind his reasoning, Harden fucked around to start the season, came in out of shape and gave half hearted effort to force his trade.  But how does that have a bearing on whether or not he is a good enough player to be an All Star? He didn't actually miss too many games compared to a lotta other potential allstars  Even in his first game, 'out of shape' (which is a narrative not grounded in reality, he always looks 'out of shape' early every year), he dropped 44 points and 17 assists like he just picked up where he left off  [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lj9tbl/zach\_lowe\_says\_his\_10\_eastern\_conference\_all\_star/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lj9tbl/zach_lowe_says_his_10_eastern_conference_all_star/)  There's no way guys like Jaylen Brown are a lock over James Harden."
"&gt; Zach Lowe is braindead for his reasoning as why Harden isn't an All Star. He has guys like Jaylen Brown as a lock over Harden I think... which is ridiculous &gt;  &gt;   Ok come on, Lowe has been very clear that Harden's play isn't what's keeping him from an all-star spot on his fake all star team, but his actions to force his way out of Houston. He's never said he's not playing like an all-star or not good enough."
"Zach Lowe is braindead for his reasoning as why Harden isn't an All Star. He has guys like Jaylen Brown as a lock over Harden I think... which is ridiculous  Harden is the best SG in the league and it ain't close, he's a damn lock for the ASG."
Worst might be Jaylen Brown or Tobias Harris?
"Someone who can actually create half court offense, Tobias Harris as the half court initiator does not work and Simmons is in Dunker spot mode at the end of games.  I also think they need more wing defense to deal with secondary players like Jaylen Brown or Kyrie Irving. Danny Green ain‚Äôt it at this point in his career"
Do we not count Jaylen Brown as a SF?  I'd have him in at 8 at least.
Ya no we want Jaylen Brown. Kemba is trash and fits none of our needs. Marcus Smart is good but we are loaded at the 2 and sort of at the 1. This trade just doesn‚Äôt make sense and we‚Äôd absolutely need Jaylen brown to get it done.
"My list, with short explanations:  1) Donnic - it's not close, he's the next great star in the NBA.  If I could pick any player in the league to start a team with, it would be Luka right now.    2) Ben Simmons - there are going to be MVP considerations in his future.  Even if he never learns to shoot, Simmons will be, at worst, a Millionaire's Russell Westbrook in terms of size, athleticism and talent.   3) Jason Tatum - one of the absolute best young players in the game, I thought, long and hard, about including Jaylen Brown in this list, and if it were top 10, Brown would have easily made it.    4) Donovan Mitchell - he is a star, in every sense of the word, and will be a star for the next decade to come.    5) Devin Booker - this last slot came down to him or De'aron Fox.  It was close between them.    Next five for me, in no particular order:  6) Fox 7) Jaylen Brown 8) Jamal Murray 9) Domantas Sabonis 10) John Collins"
"if you‚Äôre calling jaylen brown a guard, it‚Äôs him for sure   his finishing in the paint is crazy good"
"i agree he should be an all-star, but for the sake of discourse I think one could make the argument that Harden was a net negative to Houston where he played 8/21 games this season with the way he handled his departure (I don't think we can write this off as ""narrative"" since basketball is not played on a spreadsheet and we saw the reactions from his teammates).  There's also the super simplistic view of ""he's only played 13 games in the East"" so he shouldn't start over guys like Jaylen Brown or Kyrie"
"This is hilarious. Apparently, people forget it takes years to know who was good from a rookie class. Giannis scored 7ppg. Jaylen brown scored 6. Ingram was at 9ppg with 40% fg."
"Why Mitchell over Ja (on a much more favorable contract) or Booker or Fox or Trae or Jaylen Brown or Shai or LaMelo (again, contract)?  What about Beal or LaVine?  And that doesn't even include the fact that Gobert belongs higher than most of those guys.  There's just too many guards that are basically in the same tier to draft Mitchell that high."
"&gt;Yeah, you're playing him there because you drafted a guard when you already had guards . Which is my entire point. You can play guys at other positions if you want.  No we are playing him at SF and PF is because our FO wants to play with a PG - 3 Wings - Stretch 5. Our FO sees him as a wing not a guard (well the lines are blurred nowadays).  &gt;You guys drafted him because you thought he was better - and that was your mistake  We always knew he was going to be a raw project (similar to jaylen brown)  So idk why comment all of this when you know nothing about the Wolves."
"[Sabonis](https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=sabondo01&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;player_id2=youngtr01&amp;p2yrfrom=2021) or [Jaylen Brown](https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=brownja02&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;player_id2=youngtr01&amp;p2yrfrom=2021) , take your pick"
"Nah dude, I'm a pretty good hooper and have played against and guarded guys who have played pro internationally, I've guarded college players, D3, D2, and D1, I've even had the opportunity to guard Nate Robinson and I played against Jaylen Brown when he was in college. Some of those games eye pretty advanced, but guarding guys in a gym is nowhere near the same as guarding someone in a competitive setting when every other person on the floor is playing to that level. You and I might feel like Tony Allen in the gym but if we stepped on an NBA court guys would be coming around screens and shooting before we had the chance to dodge the screen or get a hand up. It's a completely different speed. Everyone on the floor in an NBA game is totally comfortable playing at 100% speed constantly."
Jaylen Brown isn‚Äôt even a top 5 3pt shooters in the league  Didn‚Äôt watch the video - was he being sarcastic/joking or why was he so cocky?
The Notoriously Unlikeable Jaylen Brown
"They should let Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zack LaVine and Jaylen Brown do all of the dunk contest, 3p contest and skills challenge. /r/nba will go wilding"
Legit don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen Jaylen Brown miss a corner 3
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen Jaylen Brown Miss a corner 3
"&gt; so why should that be a given?  Your homerism is showing. Jaylen Brown would then by your own standards be a poor FT shooter. 72% last year and sub 70% his entire career before that. Why should it be a given that he maintains his 78% (which is average btw, not ""good"") going forward?   &gt; Good should be read as average-slightly above average  So you're just completely redefining words to fit your argument now? No sane person would ever view the word good as average-slightly above average.  When you have to do mental gymnastics of this level, redefining words and having a blatant bias towards your team's player while not giving the same benefit of the doubt towards the other player you know you've lost. Just stop it, get some help."
"This is the way. Some people are too impatient. Jaylen Brown was a 6 ppg scorer who barely got minutes in his rookie season, now he‚Äôs an All-Star and will be for years to come. Stephen Curry was doubted for a couple of years until he became an MVP caliber player in 2015.   Lamelo is great, and IMO the best player in the draft. But it‚Äôs silly to think Warriors should regret picking Wiseman when he has shown flashes of raw talent and athletic ability. Not everyone figures it all out in their first two years."
Jaylen Brown (and I tune into every game)
&gt;‚ÄúDanny Ainge sucks at drafting.‚Äù  Danny Ainge drafting Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum in consecutive years doesn't get talked about enough. Sure they're both top 3 picks but how many gms hit one top 3 pick ever let alone 2 in back to back years?
"Dude this sub called Reddish a bust after half a year, trae a bust after a summer league game, jaylen brown a bust for years, Lonzo a bust for years, Ayton a bust (despite averaging 16-11 on 55% fg), it's like no one on this sub has put in work to improve anything in their lives so they expect players to stagnate or regress too I guess"
Yeah I think it mainly comes down to us not having a star big man. Embiid and Jokic might age well but with their sheer size they probably won't be MVP-caliber in their mid 30s. Vince Carter didn't dip below 20 ppg until he hit 33 so who knows if a similar decline hits Jaylen Brown
they should trade jaylen brown for a duncan donuts coffee
The Celtics need to get Jaylen Brown  some help
Jaylen Brown is an All Star
Im dying at that Jaylen Brown screen at reggie jackson away from the ball and just leveled right into him for absolutely no reason lol
I guess the Clippers haven't had a chance to consider Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown is on point tonight
i've been a huge fan of Jaylen Brown since he entered the league. I'll always take an opportunity to watch him play against another contender.
This reminds of the Jaylen Brown thread after he had one bad game last season in that I think a lot of people are going to regret this take sooner or later.   Also   &gt; and is a beast on defense  may be one of the funniest things I've ever heard
"&gt; Yeah except he's averaging 67% from the line this year and has consistently trended up his entire career so 70+% should be a given going forward.  He has never shot 70% from the FT line in his career, so why should that be a given? 67% is 10% below league average.  &gt; You think giving up 1.4~ points isn't the worst thing you can do? The only play worse than that would be giving up an open 3 to an elite shooter.  I would argue giving up 2 points instead of contesting a shot would be worse. As I said he's a good finisher and it will result in a lot of and-1s, so obviously fouling him isn't the best thing to do, but I'd rather him shooting FTs than most players.  &gt; Consistently being the top or one of the top creators of open 3s along with 8 assists per game isn't elite? Meanwhile you label Jaylen ""4 assists with 3 turnovers per game"" Brown as a ""good"" passer?  Simmons is currently 11th in assists, obviously very good, but I would put that a tier below elite. hence ++, not elite. Of course he's one of the best passes in the NBA, and saying he's a ++ passer is not a knock on him.  &gt; Meanwhile you label Jaylen ""4 assists with 3 turnovers per game"" Brown as a ""good"" passer?  Good should be read as average-slightly above average. Also Brown averages less turnovers per game on 30% usage compared to 20% usage for Simmons.  Brown also offers *way* better floor spacing, which in itself gives his teammates open looks either at the basket or around the perimeter, and as I mentioned can pull-up from basically anywhere on the floor and score, as well as create his own shots.  I think Simmons is a very effective player, and I think his inability to shoot is overstated a bit, but that doesn't mean it isn't still a hinderance to his value.   It's ok to be a homer, but don't be delusional. Ben is absolutely not the clear better player right now, and it's perfectly reasonable for anyone to say Brown is better."
"no it's a great stat, i agree that devin booker is a better defender than PG and jaylen brown. numbers don't lie."
"&gt; Not a good FT shooter so fouling him isn't the worst thing you can do  Yeah except he's averaging 67% from the line this year and has consistently trended up his entire career so 70+% should be a given going forward. You think giving up 1.4~ points isn't the worst thing you can do? The only play worse than that would be giving up an open 3 to an elite shooter.  &gt; ++ passer  Consistently being the top or one of the top creators of open 3s along with 8 assists per game isn't elite? Meanwhile you label Jaylen ""4 assists with 3 turnovers per game"" Brown as a ""good"" passer?   &gt; and it might be my homerism talking  It definitely is. It's ok to be a homer but don't be delusional. Ben is the clear better player right now and it's not even close."
Yeah cuz 19 year olds who cant catch occasionally are busts right? They cant improve anymore for sure. They should also be able to shoot at least 35% from the field and have great handles. With that logic I wont be surprised if a few years ago you thought Jaylen Brown is a bust
Tyler Herro and Jaylen brown are just too good to be traded for one of the greatest scorers in the history of basketball. Duh
"No way it's intense like last year. Lebron, Giannis, Kawhi, Harden too I believe, have commented negatively about it. Plus no KD or AD, maybe not even Jaylen Brown. I don't see guys going hard in All Star in a shortened season.  Then you add no crowd. Could be wrong though."
"I think he‚Äôs following Gerald Green‚Äôs advice from his rookie year:   &gt; ""You get in the dunk contest and they kind of label you as 'just this, or just that,' "" Green said. ""I think for him it's something that if he wants to do it, he should do it. If it's kind of up in the air, I don't think he should do it.  &gt; ""Doing the dunk contest is not important. It's something that you either dreamed about as a little kid, or you want to go out there and get a little more recognition. But other than that, once it's over, it's over. It's nothing you can really hold onto.  &gt; ""Believe me, I know from experience.""  https://www.telegram.com/sports/20170121/gerald-green-slams-dunk-contest-as-jaylen-brown-mulls-invitation-to-participate"
&gt;Brown is a much better scorer and spaces the floor better.  Ben Simmons 3pt% on his last 3: 100%  Jaylen Brown 3pt% on his last 3: 0%  checkmate
" Jaylen ""The Platonic Ideal"" Brown"
I‚Äôve been hoping for jaylen brown for 2 years now
Jaylen Brown didn‚Äôt have Covid
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d‚Äôanglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
"Of course they would do that trade, they weren't giving up Jaylen Brown, they were giving up DeMar DeRozan."
Jaylen brown
"‚ÄúJrue Holiday, Norman Powell and Jaylen Brown are overrated‚Äù"
"I lumped them all up as the FO. Quite frankly, i don‚Äôt care for BoB or the other personnel of the Texans FO. Regardless of whoever made the final call, the Hopkins trade is still horrendously bad.   Hopkins was never the problem with the Texans. And him getting traded did not solve any of the team‚Äôs problems, and the picks themselves undervalued Hopkins...   Imagine knowing the Jrue got traded for like 3 FRPs, and the Celtics traded away Jaylen Brown, who is balling out rn, for idk, Drummond and a second round pick... the year prior, OBJ, after two straight down years with the Giants, was traded for two picks (a first and a third), and two players. Hopkins just threepeated as a first team all-pro only to be traded for scraps..."
HOOOOOOOOW!??? Jaylen Brown is out playing him
Jaylen brown chasing around any kind of off ball shooter is just playing with fire defensively
Miami is stronger with Jimmy but you must view this in retrospect at the time that the reserves were selected. Jason tatum and jaylen brown would certainly lose stock if they were judged off their teams current success rate.
"Because Jaylen Brown actually deserved it, but it felt wrong to make Brown an All-Star and not Tatum, so they just put both."
Jaylen brown been better than him all year he should‚Äôve got the start
Jaylen Brown has been better
"After his awful start to the season, he's averaging 16ppg on 47/44/76 with solid D. There is room for improvement and sometimes he has to improve his shot selection, but he's been a good piece for us. I think he will be like Jaylen Brown where we see his worth in Year 4, 5, etc."
"Stanley Johnson, Jaylen Brown, Josh Jackson, Mikal Bridges, Rui Hachimura, DeAndre Hunter, Patrick Williams, Issac Okoro"
I love Cade and Suggs a ton.. But Kuminga is looking like the #1 pick to me. His improvement from last year to this is startling and shows his work ethic.. I seriously think he could be a jaylen brown type of player.
Jaylen Brown
The disrespect to Jaylen brown and downtown freddy brown.
I think Jaylen Brown or Jayson Tatum or the right  combo of still being young but already being good enough to not worry about future potential. I‚Äôll take a 100% chance at perennial all stars with some MVP potential over a guy who might have more MVP potential but could also not even reach their level currently.
"Beal was first in fan vote, player vote, and media vote. Harden was third across the board.   Compare that to luka and dame. Luka was second in fan vote, third in player vote, and third in media vote. Dame was third in fan vote, second in player vote and second in media vote. His player and media votes were both double Luka‚Äôs votes in those categories.   Your claim that the media has no consistency makes little sense. The media also hates Harden, if it was up to them Jaylen Brown would have started over both Harden and Kyrie."
Nah dude. James Harden is James Harden. But Jaylen Brown could be anyone...he could even be James Harden!
"Exactly. He was never touted to be a scorer like Tatum. The way he‚Äôs playing now is the exact player we were hoping he would be. Now he just has to primarily work on his handles and finishing   If jaylen brown can make a massive jump on those areas, I‚Äôm 100% sure Lonzo can improve those parts aswell"
"I'll give you my side. This is going to be long, so buckle the fuckle up.  Brown and Tatum can be the best players on a championship-winning team.  However, they can't be the *only* players on a championship-winning team.  Smart is a good player, who is actually a bad player, because he thinks he's *a lot* better than he is. He takes shots away from Tatum and Brown in big playoff moments, and it costs us dearly each time. Smart thinks he's Steph, meanwhile when the game is hanging on a thread in the last few minutes/seconds, Smart will lay brick after clanging brick, thinking just *maybe* they'll start going in after the *next* one.   *Narrator voice:*  They don't.  Kemba was, in theory, a fantastic signing! But his knee turned into shredded fucking wheat, the *moment* he landed at Logan. It's unbelievable.  Ainge doesn't like centers. He either drafts, or finds in the bargain bin, bench-quality 6' 8"" guys, and throws them out there against the fucking Embiids and ADs of the world, and goes all Surprised Pikachu when they get utterly destroyed. And then they leave, and he trolls the bargain bin for two more 6' 8"" guys the next year.  And the bench? It's a college team. Go on r/bostonceltics. and they'll try to convince you that Carsen Edwards just needs three years to develop, and Robert Williams is really *such a great center, really!*, and Grant Williams is such a great... center, I guess. They tried to convince me the same about James Young. You're a Miami fan, tell me -- have *you* ever heard of James Young?  Can Ainge construct a roster? I mean, *yes.* He put together one of the most insanely stacked teams in '08. And during the Doc Rivers era, he kept it pretty legit the entire time.  But since then? Ainge has absolutely *wanked away* all his draft picks, choosing to take those picks, rather than package them for real players.  There's a very vocal segment of Celtics fandom that reminds me of the cartoon with the dog in the burning house. ""This is fine!"".  No, no it's not. Don't keep telling me how much time we have to develop new draftees each year, because Tatum and Brown are still so young. Guess what? Paul Pierce was young too. Right up until he wasn't, and you look back and realize his prime was wasted on shitty Celtics teams for *years*, until Ainge put his nuts on the table, and traded Al Jefferson, and several others for KG.  This is where we are. Ainge needs to put his nuts back on the table, and fucking *clear* this roster of everyone not named Jaylen or Jayson. Or maybe even one of them, if it can get you the right return. Sometimes you need to give up someone you like, to get someone better. You should have heard the Celtics fandom bitching and moaning when we traded for KG. Everyone liked Al Jefferson. He was a really good player! But trading him allowed us to make *real* moves to get better. But damn, in the moment, you'd think Ainge had run afoul of the Geneva Convention.  Switching from one really-good point guard to the next every two years, and signing cheap 6' 8"" ""centers"", and relying on college kids as a bench you expect to contend for titles... all of that shit is just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.  If you couldn't tell, it pisses me off."
Lebron  Dame  AD  Booker  CP3  Kawhi  PG  Steph  Klay  Donovan Mitchell  Gobert   Jokic  Murray (arguable)  KAT  SGA (arguable)  Luka  DeMar   Ja   Zion  Tatum  Jaylen Brown (arguable)  Kyrie   Harden  KD   Embiid   Ben Simmons   Beal  Russ (arguable)  Butler  Trae Young (arguable)  Giannis   That‚Äôs 30. Doesn‚Äôt even include fringe guys like Lavine or badass rookies like LaMelo.
"Did I say anything inaccurate? You‚Äôre saying the Celtics have made 6 first round picks which isn‚Äôt true at all.   Also your post has nothing to do with getting a ‚Äú2nd player‚Äù (idk what that means).   In 2017 they traded a high level pick for star, and also signed an all star in FA. They also signed an all star in FA in 2019. So they had 2-4 players at an all star level last year on many nights.   They have 2 all stars this year, and a 3rd guy coming off an all star starter year, but also knee surgery, so he‚Äôs still working on getting back to top level.   People like you should be throwing out real, tangible alternatives. Saying shit like ‚Äúhe should have gotten a star or an all star‚Äù is useless. No shit. You don‚Äôt think any GM is trying to get stars and all stars? What specific move should Ainge have done? They were over the cap. Hayward wanted to go to Charlotte, what stars could we have gotten from them in a S&amp;T? Do you trade Smart and the whole bench for a guy making 18-20 million? Who is he? Is he available? Name him. Do you trade Jaylen Brown? Since were operating in hindsight, absolutely not. Package Tatum and Smart? For who?"
"Star - A **good** player / Key piece on a contender. Think Lou Williams or Kyle Kuzma  All-Star - An all-star.. pretty self explanatory. Randle, Jaylen Brown, Bam Adebayo  Superstar - Good enough to be the best player on a championship level team. LeBron, Kawhi, AD, KD, Jokic, Steph, etc."
"Conveniently cutting off at 2019.   If you go to years prior you could see he got Smart, Rozier, Brown, Tatum, and Rob Williams In consecutive years.   Also Nesmith, Pritchard and Langford have all played less than 40 games. Those guys make up half of the 6 picks you mentioned and you‚Äôre acting as if they‚Äôre already wastes.   And they traded 2 of the other picks (Thybulle, Bane) so Ainge didn‚Äôt actually make those selections. They were made for the purposes of the trades (clearing cap for Kemba first, and opening a 5.2 million dollar trade exception 2nd).   Last point I‚Äôll make is any other GM in 2016 and 2017 ends up with Kris Dunn and Markelle Fultz. Ainge drafted two all stars in Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and ended up with a future pick he used on Langford who, again, the jury is still out on."
"As much as I love him, Jaylen Brown has become overrated a little bit. I've seen a lot of people saying he should have been the only all star on the Celtics or saying he's better than Tatum, hell i've seen ppl say he's better than Beal. Still a great player and deserves to be an all star but slightly overrated now.     On the other hand Marcus Smart is incredibly underrated. All Defense 1st team, legitimately great playmaker, and he's actually a decent 3pt shooter. One of the best deal in the league at 12m per year too."
Jaylen Brown was definitely a project. Look at his numbers for his rookie season.
" Bron ad giannis embiid jokic dame kd Kyrie harden kawhi luka are all superstars ‚Äî I think the best stars are jimmy butler and Donovan Mitchell , PG, dbook, jaylen brown , cp3 etc Worst stars are Middleton , derozan, draymond etc"
"they also drafted jaylen brown over kris dunn smh. ainge a fucken hack, still havent recovered from that one. celtics dunn fucked up."
A career of Jaylen Brown + Smart + first rounders ... I am happy to stick with Brown. There's no guarantee that Harden + Tatum with no depth would win.   It would be a shit situation after Harden left and there's no picks and no support for Tatum.   Kawhi got traded for an allstar. The spurs were pretty clear about wanting an established player + a young player + a first round pick.
PG: Ja Morant  SG: Jaylen Brown  SF: Tatum  PF: John Collins  C: Deandre Ayton  6th man: Clarkson

"Damian Lillard &amp; Jaylen Brown.  They'd be a very complimentary back-court pairing, also they're my 2 favorite players in the NBA"
Jaylen brown
Jaylen Brown will probably never be as good as Harden or close to him. Missed opportunity tbh.
"We never had the role player depth that any of those teams had. In the case of brooklyn, having guys like levert, dinwiddie, harris, and allen gave them tons of flexibility to not only get free agents but make a trade.   The kawhi trade was a bad trade from the start because the spurs needed kawhi gone. I still don't like that possibility for the Celtics though because the raptors championship required immense luck in the warriors being completely broken that series. I wouldn't have wanted to trade a guy like jaylen brown for a one year rental when the durant warriors were still around. That was probably our best chance at a ring but there's no guarantees and it's still possible that the same chemistry issues that ruined that year still happen with kawhi on the team.   The lakers aren't really comparable. They did a great job building young talent, but lebron going there bailed them out in a way that wouldn't happen to the Celtics. AD clearly never wanted to come to Boston so that set up perfectly for him to go to the lakers."
The Celtics are the only team i understand not making a move  Jaylen Brown is rly good and they still have time to make it work
"Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart and Kemba are all the future GOAT or Ainge can't construct a roster? Which is it? You can't have it both ways.  According to Celtics fans your players are both simultaneously the best in the league and the roster isn't good enough and it's all Ainge's fault."
"yep... or he traded the good picks that he had for nothing. last year he did it with matisse and this year with bane, both players that could have helped them right away.  he hoarded all those picks from one of the worst trades in nba history and he has nothing other than jaylen brown and jayson tatum, who are both great players but they need a better support cast."
"Don‚Äôt forget Jaylen brown, Jayson Tatum as well"
Did Collin Sexton and Jaylen Brown die? They definitely make a good case this season as well.

"See that's also an oversimplification.   Yes, ideally Tatum needs to be more efficient. I'm not going to argue there.    However, the mistake you're making is assuming players should be compared to league averages and not team averages. I would love for Tatum to defer his shots to LeBron James more frequently, but unfortunately, we don't have LeBron James on the team.   Tatum often can't pass out of a bad shot because if he passes out we get an even worse shot. He can't defer to Jeff Teague, Semi Ojeleye and Grant Williams.   Kyrie on the other hand, had: Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Morris and Terry Rozier. There were guys he could have deferred to. Instead, he took shots away from them to focus on his own volume stats.  There is an argument to be said that Tatum could offload a couple of extra scoring attempts (and I've been wary of his low assist numbers and poor body language lately), but we really need him scoring ~20-25ppg at least, even at this efficiency because we can't get those points in a more efficient way.   &gt;Does that mean you'd rather have Deandre Jordan as a scorer than Tatum?  No.   Because as much as Tatum has struggled recently:  1. His efficiency isn't bad for a perimeter player (TS% is warped by highly efficient bigs on low volume) 2. His efficiency needs to be seen in the context of the team, not the league."
Is Jaylen Brown a good stats bad team guy?
"How? The dude has nothing to work with. You can‚Äôt just come up with the excuse that ‚ÄúHe HaS 3 AlL sTaRs iN kEmBa aNd ThE tWo JaYs‚Äù. Kemba has regressed, Tatum had covid, and Jaylen Brown isn‚Äôt always healthy. He‚Äôs a great coach with a terrible roster. Not to mention that their bench is full of G leaguers"
"&gt; they have enough  They have Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, neither of whom are high enough level ball handlers. Kemba Walker is a shell of his former self. Marcus Smart is out for a while. The rest of the team is very one dimensional and there's like one role player shooter who defences actually respect."
"In no particular order.   1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. James Harden   5. Giannis   6. Nikola Jokic   7. Luka Doncic   8. Stephen Curry   9. Damian Lillard   10. Joel Embiid   11. Paul George   12. Kyrie Irving   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Jayson Tatum   15. Trae Young  16. Anthony Davis   17. KAT   18. Rudy Gobert   19. Zach Lavine   20. Bradley Beal   21. CJ Mccollum   22. Chris Paul   23. Donovan Mitchell   24. Domantas Sabonis   Those are 24 guys that are better. I think Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton and some others are better too but that‚Äôs an opinion."
"Bradley Beal was scoring an efficient 30 for the last place Wizards while we had, I believe, the second best record in the east at that time.   The Pacers are currently one game ahead of the Celtics in the standings. If you can't see the difference between those situations I dont know what to tell you.   If you believe Sabonis has been playing better than Jaylen Brown, he deserves it. If you can't say that Sabonis has been better than Brown, Sabonis doesn't deserve it."
"I think the most logical explanation is he caught hype as some young emerging super star winning most improved player of the year, and then people realized he‚Äôs already 26 and his numbers stagnated.  I remember like two years ago people were absolutely certain his trade value was higher than Tatum, Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown when in hindsight that clearly wasn‚Äôt the case"
"Just so people are aware, this guy rocks a Jaylen Brown flair in r/bostonceltics but is pretty much 100% ""trade Jaylen for scraps"".   &gt;FVV 100% deserved it over Brown.  This isn't even an opinion, it's just a bait."
I support it. Jaylen Brown does not deserve the selection.
Jayson Tatum &gt; Jimmy Butler   Jaylen Brown &gt; Bam Adebayo    Checks out
"They have two all stars but neither of them are good at running an offense. so that forces them to play through Kemba facilitating which isn‚Äôt honestly a good offense. Tatum and Brown are good at ISO scoring but aren‚Äôt strong in other areas. Doncic, lebron, Steph, harden, KD, Jokic, Kawhi, and now recently Embiid can have the offense run through them. It‚Äôs an entirely different dynamic. jaylen brown particularly doesn‚Äôt have a good enough dribble yet."
He's better than Jaylen Brown. I'm insanely jealous of the Thunder.
"Brad Stevens, Danny Ainge, and Jaylen Brown are all very good, you are just spoiled"
Yo Shut the fuck up about Jaylen Brown don‚Äôt ever speak on him like that again
"This franchise's championship window is closed. There is no competing with Brad Stevens as the head coach, Danny Ainge as the GM, and Jaylen Brown as our #2 option."
He deserved the All-Star selection over Jaylen Brown.
You can thank jaylen brown for that
"It is definitely possible imo. I would point to John Urschel who isn't an MVP NBA player, but getting accepted by MIT to do a PhD in math while playing in the NFL suggests to me it would be possible--maybe if he had genetics that favored basketball physically. There's also really smart, talented players in the NBA, Jaylen Brown and Myles Turner come to mind. Plus admission into Stanford is heavily extracurricular-based, and well basketball is an extracurricular so it'd be impossible to even tell if all the variables in this hypothetical aren't confounded."
"Boston fans have to accept the fact that Kyrie was not the issue in 2018/19, nor was Rozier. Notice how neither Horford nor Hayward wanted to stay in Boston despite its ""bright future"". The issue was always that there is a locker room cancer in our core, namely Brad Stevens, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Marcus Smart.  Smart has been out for most of the season, so it can't be him. I have been a vocal proponent of firing Brad Stevens, but we cannot rule out the possibility that Tatum and Brown do not like each other."
"Sabonas for Vuc, FVV for Jaylen Brown."
So I re-watched the play my mistake it was Finley-Smith that was the open man. Theis showing hard forced Jaylen Brown to decide whether to leave Smith open or trap Doncic. JB was in good position after the pick because he fought through the screen really well. He didn't need to switch at the time because he was still solid on Doncic.
"Congrats on being the only person stupid enough to not understand that me using an example of one player being significantly more skilled and showing much more ability, adding to its significance because it was a head to head, is not the only example of it being true, just a very good one used as a explanation for the case  FVV has been better than Middleton all year.   It was just a good example of how much better FVV has been, that you could go watch and see clearly. Not the entirety of FVV case of being better this season, go watch his orolando game, or his philly games, or his nets game, or a bunch of other games where he was fantastic, just look at his impact numbers, that show him above plenty of all stars in basically every impact metric like the likes of Jaylen Brown.   The bucks have been bad all season against teams over .500 and Middleton has been not good most of the year. He really isn't helping them on the defensive end and he makes so many mistakes on offense these days."
"Jaylen Brown, Vucevic, Randle, Simmons to start. He didnt make it in the past because ""he wasnt winning"", but now that he started winning, everyone flipped the script and is like, ""well winning shouldnt really matter when discusssing stars"". I think thats bullshit."
Jaylen brown needs to be replaced. The celtics record is not deserving of two all stars. Should be Middleton or Sabonis. And I rather have Tatum replaced but he‚Äôs got more games over brown this year I think
Don‚Äôt underestimate the ‚ÄúJaylen Brown playing in his hometown‚Äù factor either
Boston might as well trade Jaylen Brown for Vuc.  Come on plz
That guy hates Jaylen Brown more than any Sixers fans lol
"&gt; Rozier, Hayward, and LaMelo are all better than Jaylen Brown.   That is a scorching hot take. I do love Celtic self hate though."
"We need a better second option than Jaylen Brown, it's that simple. The Celtics fall apart whenever Tatum sits and that always reflects in +/-. No coincidence that Tatum was a team-high and Brown was a team-worst.  Brown is really a slightly better Semi Ojeleye. You need a real creator on the floor with Brown, and Kemba hasn't been consistent. Still hoping that he gets back to form in the Playoffs."
"Because Tatum is the only great player on the Celtics, and Rob Williams is only getting there.  Kemba hasn't been consistent since hurting his knee, remains to be seen whether he will ever get back to that level.  And Rozier, Hayward, and LaMelo are all better than Jaylen Brown."

"They would need a roster on par with like the 2019 Raptors or current Jazz talent wise where 1-8 every dude is solid. Dame, Trent, CJ, Nurkic, Melo, and Covington are all solid. The Derrick Jones Jr role is the weak link, but he would be fine off the bench. Rodney Hood was also playing crunch time minutes for them and I just don't have much faith in him anymore. Even when Zach Collins is healthy he wouldn't be enough. They need defense. The dream replacement would be Draymond but that will never happen. The only hope would be to take a gamble on an Aaron Gordon type player or younger and hope you can turn them into Draymond lite. I don't see Dame and CJ breaking up either. It's not like CJ would fetch much. If you could replace CJ with like Gordon Hayward or Jaylen Brown that might help but again I would doubt that would happen. Maybe Myles Turner? But that may just create more problems."
"Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell. Those 3 were super active and are always working with the community. There are def more but those 3 are the first to come to mind"
"Yep, welcome to Boston, where everyone except Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart mentally checks out every second game."
"He's still playing better than Jaylen Brown, who has been atrocious since his hot start to the season. Not including tonight, since the beginning of February, Kemba is on average +2.5. Jaylen Brown is on average +0.5, and that's going to go down after tonight's team-worst -14.  This is why basic stats are misleading. A hobbled Kemba Walker is still a more effective player than Jaylen Brown."
Why was Jaylen Brown even in that commercial?
"Jaylen Brown should have just kept it on the perimeter, that's where Gobert is useless /s"
Team-worst -14. Jaylen Brown is the new king of empty-stats.  The Celtics management isn't dumb. When will they realize that Jaylen Brown should not be untouchable and should be traded for a real star player.
Jaylen Brown is a scary man
"In that case, we will take 1 Jaylen Brown please"
"Lol, says the guy with the Marcus Smart tag. Remember game 6 vs the Heat when he took 22 shots? 5 more than Jaylen Brown? Yeah that‚Äôs stupid"
"lol what a hater. Rudy is a 7 foot big man, of course he's not gonna shuffle his feet as quick as jaylen brown. Doesn't mean that his length and defensive instincts didn't lock him down."
"The sooner the Celtics management realizes that Jaylen Brown only produces empty stats and has no effects on winning basketball, the sooner we can see a big trade for a real star player. Tatum deserves so much better than Brown."
Does Jaylen Brown always have this much arc on his shot? Maybe it's just my screen lol but to me today it seems like he is shooting it higher.
They're now saying Jaylen Brown is considered
Does that make Jaylen Brown a two-way bass?
"I think a Dame, Curry, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Jokic line-up would be pretty, pretty good."
"Jaylen Brown got knee tendinitis too and it fucking sucks to see, although from what he said it's not as bad as bams"
"He‚Äôd be the perfect center alongside Zion. I would be thrilled if the Pelicans were able to pull something together. They give the Pacers Steven Adams, one of Nickeil, Jaxon, Kira, and a draft pick a couple years down the road? Probably would have to give up another young piece/draft pick, but of all these teams, they have the most attractive collection of assets to make that trade. My big dream is either Jaylen Brown or Jayson Tatum wants out of Boston by the beginning of next season and the Pels make a big trade for one of them. Who the team gets to finish off their Big 3 is going to determine what kind of success the team has during Zion‚Äôs early days."
"**Kemba in Feb 2021 (bounceback):**  20.3ppg, 39.2% shooting, 38% from 3, 4.5APG, 2.2 TO  **Kemba in March 2021 (4 games):**   16.8PPG, 39.6% shooting, 37% from 3, 4.8 APG, 2.8 TO  **Kemba Regular Season 2019:**  20PPG, 42.5% shooting, 38% from 3, 4.5 APG, 2.2 TO  **Kemba Playoff Stats 2020:**  19.6PPG, 42% shooting, 33% from 3, 4.9 APG, 1.9 TO  Even without factoring the slow start, he's still not at the same level he was last year or when he was in Charlotte. He clearly lost a step as his driving ability doesn't offer the same separation as it did pre knee surgery too.  &gt; Every single season he's performed better in the playoffs than the regular season. His game is built for the playoffs.   Eh, JB is more aggressive in the playoffs for sure, but last playoffs he was more or less the same as his regular season self production wise.  **Jaylen Brown Regular Season 2019:**  20ppg, 48% shooting, 38% from 3, 5.5 RPG, 3.9 APG, 2.8 TO  **Jaylen Brown Playoff Stats 2020:**  22ppg, 48% shooting, 35% from 3, 7.5 RPG, 2.3 APG, 2.4 TO  Then there's the recent drop, probably due to a sore knee or just typical shooting averages regressing to the mean. I do believe JB has improved this year overall, but I doubt he'll hit his historic December/January numbers for a while, so as of right now if there was any improvement, it's not showing anymore given his recent struggles handling the ball and poor decision making.  **Jaylen Brown in Feb 2021:**  22.2ppg, 44% shooting, 30% from 3, 4.8 RPG, 4.6 APG, 3.5 TO  **Jaylen Brown in March so far (4 games):**  19ppg, 42% shooting, 37% from 3, 4.8 RPG, 3.0 APG, 2.5 TO  I didn't mention Pritchard, Teague and Thompson because they weren't on last years rosters."
"But no one was picking us to win that let alone dominate them. With Rozier, a rookie Tatum and 2nd year Jaylen Brown. That was a huge upset"
"I don‚Äôt know how the season will play out given how close all these teams are to each other, but I do think there‚Äôs some context missing about our losses to you. Not only didn‚Äôt we have Kemba in both our losses, but we were also missing Smart (who we‚Äôve been missing all year) and in our first loss, we also didn‚Äôt have Theis. As a result we had Jaylen Brown as point guard in our first game against you in a lineup with Tatum/Javonte Green/Semi Ojeleye/Tristan Thompson. This was against Trae/Huerter/Reddish/Collins/Capela. In our second loss, we were on a back to back on the road having played four games in six days and we had Jeff Teague starting. In the one game Kemba played, he led our team in scoring, plus minus, and steals and really was the difference throughout the game."
Jaylen Brown is an all-star lmao
Any other young piece and this gets massive upvotes. Sake way when someone posts how good we are defensively.   Replace us with the Jazz and replace THT with Jaylen Brown and they'd upvote it to the moon.
"No they won't, that's jaylen brown money. Norm is not worth that much, he's a good shooter and finisher who's a little undersized with average defence. If someone gave him 25 mil a year he'd be the 45th highest paid player in the league, that's insane."
"... that‚Äôs not my point.   The whole OP explains why Nets half court defense isn‚Äôt as bad as advertised. You mentioned the change of style during the playoffs, and they lean towards the Nets defense.   My point is even with a highly rated defense like the Miami Heat last year, stopping them when the game slows down is impossible. In fact, based on the logic of the OP, getting stopped by them might be more probable.  This isn‚Äôt Giannis and Khris Middleton or Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown."
"Definitely both. I'm a big Celtics fan, but I might actually be in love with Jaylen Brown."
Jaylen Brown.
"The great thing about Ben is his positional flexibility on both sides of the ball. He can play PG or a big on offense depending on who‚Äôs around him. He can legitimately guard 1-4 at an elite level. While he does need a specific type of player around him, they don‚Äôt have to be anything more than a shooter with average defense.  Jaylen Brown is a more dynamic scorer, but he isn‚Äôt running an offense and his defense is a tier or two below Ben‚Äôs.  If either are your 3rd best player, you‚Äôre favorites to win a championship. As #2‚Äôs I think it would heavily depend on the rest of the roster."
Trezz has a defensive rating of 111.7 and lights out 106 in the last 5 games.   Jaylen Brown has a defensive rating of 113.6
Ben would clamp Jaylen Brown with ease
"That's all accurate, but the real variable was that while he was out, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown BOTH ended up not only NBA players, but the type of guys you re-sign and build around. It's kind of unprecedented that both of them ended up working out like they did, basically because they were forced into the minutes by Hayward's injury. Very few people besides Jaylen Brown himself thought he would grow into what he is now, a lot of Celtics fans hated that draft pick because we already had one athletic guard who can't shoot in Marcus Smart.   So, does this same thing happen, or happen anywhere near this quickly if Hayward doesn't get hurt like that? Or, if one of Tatum or Brown happens to be just meh or a bust, is there still room for Hayward? It's just crazy because none of it is his fault, but there was no spot in Boston for him to do what he's doing now"
Jaylen brown is the better player if that‚Äôs what your asking...at least there is hope he can be a 2 on a championship team...I don‚Äôt think ben will ever be that guy
Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown is not even a top 100 player.
"Look at Brown right now. He's playing the best ball of his career and is the second best player on the Celtics and they're nowhere near good enough to be considered a title team. They're barely above .500. Jaylen Brown isn't as good as Lowry was two years ago, and even that was a pretty extreme outlier year, given that KD, Klay and Boogie were all hurt for the Warriors. Take that year out and the second best player of past title teams are AD then Steph, Steph and Kyrie. Jaylen isn't anywhere near that level."
"This makes no sense. Anthony Davis was a first option on a .500 team lol, he just won a ring cause he played with LeBron. Jaylen Brown absolutely has potential to be a 2nd option. Look at Siakam and Lowry with the Raptors, he can play at that level. AD isn‚Äôt the benchmark"
"I have admitted that Jaylen Brown isn‚Äôt a first option on a title team, but he can definitely get you a bucket in crunch time when you need one"
"&gt; Jaylen Brown has all of the attributes to be a secondary player on a championship team  Reality check for you though: Jaylen Brown is currently the second best player on a .500 team. He's an All Star and is obviously a very good player, but I mean, Anthony Davis was the second best player on last year's title team, and there's a pretty significant difference between AD and Jaylen Brown."
"If your best player is either Jaylen Brown or Ben Simmons, then your team is not winning the championship. Those guys can be 2nd or 3rd options (probably 3rd) on a title team, but they're not good enough to be the best player on a champion."
Jaylen Brown and shooter wouldn‚Äôt be winning playoff games
Jaylen is a better fit for plug-and-play for any team.  But I think Simmons likely has a bit more value and is a slightly better player/higher upside if a roster is built with his tools and shortcomings in mind.    Tough to say since I'm unreasonably high on Jaylen Brown.  It'll be interesting to see where both their careers go
Loool Jaylen Brown
"Both can‚Äôt be a 1st option, but I am suspect that Simmons could be a 2nd option, whereas I think Jaylen Brown could be. Jaylen Brown has all of the attributes to be a secondary player on a championship team.   I think you need another guy on your team who can give you 20 + a night in the playoffs, as well as a first option if you have Simmons on your team."
Ben Simmons shooting 28% from 3 is a concern. I‚Äôm choosing Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown is better than Tatum
Jaylen Brown &gt; Jayson Tatum
"&gt; perennial all-star but with very few all NBA teams  That's just how it works out sometimes. Paul Pierce had 10 All-Star/4 All-NBA. Vince Carter had 8/2, Ray Allen had 10/2.   He might make it this year, but he's not a sure thing. Harden, Curry, Dame, Luka, Ben Simmons are all likely. He's in the mix with players like Beal, Lavine, Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown. Russ won't make it this year, so that frees up a spot."
They didn‚Äôt do shit prior to 5 years ago.   5 years ago was one of the lowest their team was. It was post KG but Pre-Sean Marks moves  5 years ago Jaylen Brown wasn‚Äôt even picked yet.
Sounds like what we thought of Jaylen Brown!
"It 100% was a hit job.  Teams outside of the top 3 were no doubt angling to grab him if he fell.  Same shit happened to Jaylen Brown where you read all these pre draft articles dumping on his motivation and then read about teams outside the top 8 desperately trying to put together packages to move up if he fell to 4.  People knew Wiseman was going to be taken by Golden State or Charlotte, so it was just a matter of whether you could drum up enough *I don't know guys* on Edwards or Ball to make everyone collectively forget those were the clear top 3 guys."
"&gt; Don't forget Butler has been rising steadily in terms of stats and doesn't look likely to slow down anytime soon.  Out of his last ten games *two* were against teams with a win% higher than .500. This season he has played seven games against teams that are currently .500 or higher, and against those teams he has an average BPM of... 3.2. So no, I disagree that the numbers of his recent games (which still fall short of the basic averages of other MVP candidates) are bound to continue.  &gt; Nobody is saying they'd vote Butler if the season ended today.  I responded to someone saying he should be a candidate. Someone else has said he is a top 8 candidate.  Once again:  * He has missed 14 games so far * He falls significantly short of other candidates on basic metrics that yes, are *not* advanced, and are *not* the full picture, but nontheless MVP voting has generally followed in the last five years.  It would be unprecedented on *multiple* levels if he were to receive significant votes. It would be so unprecedented basketball-reference doesn't even list him in their tracker, which goes down to Rudy Gobert at 1.6%. Here are some players that an unnamed betting exchange valued at over $2 billion has listed as *more likely* to win MVP this season:  * Jaylen Brown * Domantas Sabonis * Kyrie Irving * Bradley Beal * Jayson Tatum * Anthony Davis * Devin Booker  If your argument for 'serious consideration' is 'But what if?' then I can throw up hypotheticals for, say, Julius Randle (he has a higher VORP! They have an easier schedule ahead! Not missed a game yet!) and the whole thing can be meaningless."

Do people really expect the 76ers and Pelicans to hate each other? I mean it's not like they watched Jaylen Brown dunk on KD or something.
"&gt;He wasn‚Äôt complaining about the call itself really, just whining that ‚Äúall star‚Äù Jaylen Brown didn‚Äôt get the call.  He was though. He was still saying it was a bad call. The all-star comments came from the fact it was a bad call even by bad call standards.  Normally bad calls favour stars or ball-handlers. This bad call didn't even do that.  A defender ran in front of Brown (who had the ball) and then stopped, with Brown running into the back of him. That's not a foul by Brown.   1. Brown was the ball handler - who usually gets the favourable call  2. Brown was the star vs a rookie - the star normally wins the 50-50  Scal was saying this was a bad call that didn't even carry the excuses that usually come with being a bad call."
"&gt; I think Stan's answer was wonderfully diplomatic and politically expedient. But the harsh truth is, most of these players are not educated, and vaccine skepticism is very strongly correlated with education.  I can normally rely on SVG and Doc Rivers to give great statements that are sound, logical, and emotionally/culturally relevant.  Also like you mentioned, athletes being millionaires with exposure to some of the highest medical advancements doesn't mean shit considering how most of them have very little education. You also have to consider the part of modern medicine that athletes regularly come into contact with, which is surgery, rehab, nutrition, how muscles and tendons work, stuff like that. Does that mean they should automatically trust all fields of medicine when they're uneducated, especially stuff like epidemiology, infectious diseases, internal medicine, etc?   Jaylen Brown took his education at Cal seriously. I bet (and I hope I'm not wrong about this for my sake and for his sake too) that he is not a vaccine skeptic. I don't know what CJ's take on this whole thing is, but Lehigh is a great school - if he took his education there seriously, I doubt he'd be a vaccine skeptic either.  And let's not pretend that there aren't large portions of white Americans that are skeptical about the vaccine. In general the whole of American society is way more skeptical about the COVID vaccine (and vaccines in general) than many other countries with citizenry that have higher average education levels."
"my guy Jaylen Brown is a two way player and has made the ECF three times even though he is pretty young so far in his career and has been efficient af as a second option. He has improved each and every year, except for 2019 where the celtics were dysfunctional. He has potential to be a superstar, Idk why u think Jaylen Brown is not great smh."
"I think many people still assume that the path towards becoming an NBA ref is similar to that of the players. I always figured there was some sort of system to recruit great high school refs to college, then the best there get to the NBA eventually. Or something along those lines. Made a lot of sense to me but never something I thought to look into.  Then like a month ago I see those Mark Cuban quotes and realized how naive I was being. It was really easy for me to excuse incompetent NBA officiating by thinking ‚Äúthese guys are the best at what they do, it‚Äôs just a really difficult job‚Äù but turns out, these guys aren‚Äôt the best at what they do, or even that close to it.  Like if James Harden is talented enough at drawing fouls to convince the best refs in the world he was slapped, I guess I can tell myself that‚Äôs an elite skill he developed, even if I don‚Äôt enjoy that aspect of the game. But when he‚Äôs tricking someone who only has that job because their uncle was once an NBA ref or whatever, idk that just feels very different to me.  The NBA is amazing because it‚Äôs the best basketball players in the world competing in one league. It‚Äôs really unfortunate that for whatever combination of reasons, the officiating is not held to an equivalent standard.  It‚Äôs comical how resigned to poor officiating the entire league has been. Scal was on the Celtics broadcast tonight complaining about how Jaylen Brown didn‚Äôt get some call over an absolute nobody. He wasn‚Äôt complaining about the call itself really, just whining that ‚Äúall star‚Äù Jaylen Brown didn‚Äôt get the call. Why have we all accepted that star players get different whistles? It‚Äôs definitely a thing in other sports (protect the QB, can‚Äôt rough Conor McDavid, etc) but I really think the NBA has gone way way too far with it."
"As a Sixers fan and a Ben stan, I will respectfully agree with you.  Jaylen Brown is the real deal and anyone denying that is just a homer."
I too happen to be a Jaylen Brown Bitch
"1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Stephen Curry   5. James Harden  6. Giannis Antetounkounmpo   7. Nikola Jokic   8. Damian Lillard   9. Luka Doncic   10. Joel Embiid   11. Jimmy Butler   12. Jayson Tatum   13. Bradley Beal   14. KAT   15. Bam Adebayo  16. Kyrie Irving   17. Paul George   18. Rudy Gobert   19. Anthony Davis   20. Chris Paul   21. Klay Thompson   22. Jaylen Brown   23. Devin Booker   24. Trae Young   25. Zach Lavine  Named 25 players I‚Äôd rather have, just for you champ. There‚Äôs more too."
"That‚Äôs fair. But out of Bron, Giannis, Harden, Kd, Steph, Ad, Embid, Jokic, Luka, Dame, Kyrie, Kawhi, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, who can Middleton go above? Plus there‚Äôs still arguments for Jaylen Brown, Ben Simmons, Beal, Lavigne, and Mitchell over Middleton."
Jaylen Brown is killing it in this first half.
So much better than Jaylen Brown.
"It's completely irresponsible and egotistical that Jaylen Brown chose to attend the All-Star game instead of resting his knee. It's clear the guy cares more about his image than actually winning. Mike Gorman was completely right about Brown playing for himself.  Jaylen Brown since February: 21/6/4.5, shooting 43/31/78 from the field, with 3.3 turnovers a game.  What happens when you combine an overrated player with a bum knee worse than Kemba's? You get the worst starter in the NBA.  Danny Ainge will regret not trading Brown for James Harden. The biggest mistake of his career. Green teamers will scream ""the future is bright"" until they are red in the face while we watch Kyrie lift another trophy before we do."
If only Jaylen Brown is as good as Wiggins...
"Dude a team of KAT and Tatum with lack of supporting cast after trading Brown + other players for KAT is miserable. Idk if you remember last series in the bubble but Jaylen Brown was the guy that gave us the most trouble, especially in transition"
Players like Jaylen brown are the biggest trap in the league especially if their young.   Good players that aren‚Äôt great enough to be a second option on a championship team but because of their goodwill and potential teams keep holding on to them and tweak around the role players. Afraid to admit to themselves that they aren‚Äôt it.  If the goal is to win a chip than these are the type of players you want to trade for true difference makers.
Obvious: Zach Lavine  Hot takes: Jaylen Brown or Anfernee Simons.  -Simons already won the dunk contest (controversy aside) and is a great shooter. Still young and should improve.  -Jaylen Brown has been a great shooter the last 2 years (and trending up) and is crazy athletic  Skills challenge is a crapshoot
I think its a moot point really.  If the Wolvea trade KAT it won't be for a jaylen brown type guy.  Brown would be requesting a trade within a year of being on the wolves
For a ship ton of players and Jaylen Brown
"We trade Jaylen Brown + others, what‚Äôs gonna be left of our roster? People think that‚Äôs still gonna be a contending team lol"
More like Jaylen brown and smart
Jaylen Brown is such a bonafide stud though
Heat fans are delusional about Herro. We all saw how he disappeared in the Finals. He is going to be a second-tier star at best. A poor man's Jaylen Brown
"Which, according to this sub, is led by an overrated GM, coach, and another overrated wing in Jaylen Brown."
Jaylen Brown or Mitchell
"Jaylen is capable of things and he's proven it. Tatum is overrated imo. He can bring it but doesn't always know how to do it, whereas Brown doesn't choose to because he tried to facilitate too much"
Jaylen brown  Jayson tatum  Daniel theis  Tristan thompson  Robert williams  Grant williams  Jeff teague  Kemba walker  Payton pritchard  Tacko fall  Tremont waters  Carsen edwards  Semi ojeleye  Javonte green  Marcus smart  Aaron nesmith  Romeo langford
Used to be Mitchell but I now I think it‚Äôs Jaylen Brown
Celtics fans gonna come for me but I think Jaylen Brown has gotten a little overrated. His hot start really boosted his stock but he‚Äôs closely been on a decline statistically since the start of the season and his off-ball defense/ball watching is still a big issue defensively.
Tbh this sounds like a lot of coping. I think ainge is a good gm but he doesn‚Äôt have an unlimited amount of time with jaylen brown and Tatum. He has to make a move soon or those guys will start wanting out   I feel like a Harrison Barnes move makes the Celtics better and is so easy to make. Literally send a first and you‚Äôre good.
"You say that he sits on his hands when he has made multiple big time trades (one that even won a championship) in his tenure. Recently we made the Kyrie trade which was a massive deal. We also traded Markelle Fultz for Jayson Tatum and Romeo Langford, we traded Pierce and KG for the picks that got us Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown + more, we traded for Kevin Garnett and went from the worst team in the league to the NBA champions the next year, we traded for Isaiah Thomas who became 4th in MVP voting. This narrative is straight bullshit. This sub seems to think that we need to make a major roster shaking deal each year which is straight up dumb. Our 2 best players are 23 and 24, we have no reason to rush the process and shorten their championship window to win now when neither of them are in their prime yet."
"Lets actually look at this list....   **Good Picks**   Luke Harangody - played 70 games as a 52nd pick   Avery Bradley - Good starter in playoff runs for Boston   Etwaun Moore - long career, 594 games and counting, 191 starts as the 55th pick   Jared Sullinger - started 182 games for Boston as a pick in the 20s   Marcus Smart   Terry Rozier - 16th pick, mocked as 2nd round, started a ECFs run for Boston, playing great   Abdel Nader - currently playing in Phoenix, 184 games as the 58th pick   Jaylen Brown   Semi Ojeleye - rotation player drafted in the 2nd round   Jayson Tatum   Robert Williams   Payton Pritchard   **No Value Expected**   Kris Joseph   Marcus Thornton   Ben Bentil   Demetrius Jackson   Jabari Bird   Kadeem Allen   **Moderate Value**   Jordan Mickey - 64 games, 4 starts as a 2nd round pick   **Bad Picks**   Fab Melo   James Young   RJ Hunter - only 45 ganes as 28th pick, not that bad   Ante Zizic &amp; Guerschon Yabusele - not great picks but they needed to draft stashes   **Not Drafted by Boston**   Marshon Brooks   Lucas Nogueira   **To be decided**   Grant Williams - has already closed playoff games for Boston but has had minutes reduced this season   Romeo Langford - looked pretty good, but injured   Yam Madar    Aaron Nesmith"
"True, but I never thought he had potential of a Jaylen Brown. I think he can be a better version of Thybulle"
I'm not going to excuse Boston the city and it's clear racism but if involvement with the BLM movement is his goal then he could do worse than working with social justice leader Jaylen Brown. Kid is absolutely a prominent voice and could do a lot of cool work with another ambitious mind like Grant.
"Whats a realistic price then? Because 2 middling first round picks ain't it. Really doubt you guys would consider Jaylen Brown, but I don't see how that deal gets done otherwise."
"Okoro was always looked at as a project. But he's got really good size and athleticism. Ceiling, I can see him potentially becoming like a Jaylen Brown type of guy, and before someone flips out at me... I distinctly remember people asking the same thing about Jaylen Brown his first couple years."
"My man, I like this dude but your tripping lol. PG, CJ, Lavine, Beal, SGA, Jaylen Brown, Mitchell, Booker and either Harden or Kyrie and maybe Levert; the list isn‚Äôt the longest but it‚Äôs definitely not short lol"
He was reportedly going to trade us the Jaylen Brown Nets pick for Okafor... until we pulled out lol (?????)
PG: Steph Curry  SG: Marcus Smart  SF: Jaylen Brown  PF: Zion Williamson  C: Joel Embiid
Jaylen Brown^/s
Did Jaylen Brown not call him out in the media?
i dont know why are mad at anyone beside your team. celtic were ahead until 3rd quarter. Jaylen brown and tatum were no show last night that can t happen against good team.
Jaylen brown is bitch made
"Argentina beat USA with a team that had basically no NBA players in 2019. I'm not sure how many players exactly in their team is in Euroleague now but I'm sure it'll be somewhat competitive. For reference here's the team USA squad that year  &gt; The official 2019 USA World Cup Team includes 2016 Olympic gold medalist¬†**Harrison Barnes**¬†(Sacramento Kings);¬†**Jaylen Brown**¬†(Boston Celtics);¬†**Joe Harris**¬†(Brooklyn Nets);¬†**Brook Lopez**¬†(Milwaukee Bucks);¬†**Khris Middleton** (Milwaukee Bucks);¬†**Donovan Mitchell**¬†(Utah Jazz); 2014 World Cup gold medalist¬†**Mason Plumlee**¬†(Denver Nuggets),¬†**Marcus Smart**¬†(Boston Celtics);¬†**Jayson Tatum**¬†(Boston Celtics);¬†**Myles Turner**¬†(Indiana Pacers);¬†**Kemba Walker**¬†(Boston Celtics); and¬†**Derrick White**¬†(San Antonio Spurs).   Not great, but still respectable. If we are going by the worst of the NBA, e.g. Rockets, I think that Euro will win."
The correct answer is any laker or Jaylen brown ez
"He's got some injury concerns, but just about any team would pay a King's ransom for a stretch 5 that's at his level  Feel like Celtics fans might not go for this but Jaylen Brown for KAT would make the Celtics nasty"
"Indeed but I‚Äôd actually hate losing to the Small Dicks even more since we‚Äôre battling for playoff seeding with them, which is absolutely hilarious. We‚Äôre almost 3/4s through the season and Brad Stevens, Jayson Tatum, and Jaylen Brown are looking up in the standings at Tommy Thibodeau, Julius Randle, and Reggie Bullock.   #BUCK FOSTON"
"&gt; Not a single one of those guys averaged even 10 points a game their first years, and they all had awful efficiency.  Second-year stats below Domantas Sabonis 11.6 57%TS Jamal Murray 16.7 58% TS Jaylen Brown 14.5 58%TS Pascal Siakam 7.3 55% TS"
"Lol everyone in the 2016 draft class was a late bloomer -- think about the other good players from that draft:  * Domantas Sabonis * Jamal Murray * Jaylen Brown * Pascal Siakam  Not a single one of those guys averaged even 10 points a game their first years, and they all had awful efficiency.  The only players that were good right away from that draft were Brogdon and Simmons.  Growth just takes a lot of time for some players."
Jayson Tatum and jaylen Brown
"bron, curry, kd, harden, kyrie, AD, dame, kawhi, PG, giannis, butler, jokic, doncic, embiid, zion, beal, westbrook, cp3, booker, lavine, vuch tatum, jaylen brown, cj, KP, KAT, murray, gobert -&gt; last 5-7 you can debate but that's easily 20 and I prob forgot a few - also klay is out with an injury too... not a top 20 player sorry, you gotta be objective bruh"
He's playing better than Jaylen Brown did at 20 years old

"Lots of highlight dunks tonight. This, Jaylen Brown, Caruso, THT."
"There isn't, as I said before, I agree many of the techs he has gotten were all his fault, but I will say that he has been getting reputation calls last 2-3 times. Look at his tech vs Celtics, and you'll agree. He wasn't even aggressive, just straight up talking like normally, while Jaylen Brown screamed in the refs face after he didn't get a call. Even the commentators did remark that he got away with a tech there. And also, he complains because he doesn't get the calls. Look at today's game itself where the defense clearly grabbed his arm while driving which caused him to lose the ball, or end of the 4th quarter where 2 players clearly fouled him and he threw the ball out. They reviewed it whether to see if it was out of Luka or the defender, while ignoring the very obvious and clear foul. Happens in all games. I understand why he would be pissed."
"The top 5 nba draft picks from from 2012-2016 (to weed out players who are still on rookie deals)  * 2012:  AD at 1, Brad Beal at 3, to be fair then Dame at 6. AD and Dame were All Stars quickly, but Beal didn't make an All-Star team until 2018 * 2013: Victor Oladipo made one all star game. A famously pretty bad draft,, though * 2014: Joel Embiid is a slam dunk. Meanwhile people are still waiting to see if Aaron Gordon figures it out, and it's taken Andrew Wiggins 6 years to (maybe) become a good player.  * 2015: KAT, DLo, Zinger all took a while and there are still big questions surrounding all of them.  * 2016: Ben Simmons, Brandon Ingram, and Jaylen Brown all look to be good players but have also all had weird paths to get where they are now.    My point in all of that even top 5 picks are rarely immediately good. It usually takes a couple of seasons to really know what you have, especially when they're entering the league at 18 years old."
"The Nets track records from 2016 to 2018 suggest the picks will be top 3-5 surely, thats how the Celtics got Jaylen Brown and Jaysen Tatum. And yes Ben Simmons is an average top 5 pick, even in an average draft class hes only the 4-6th best player from 2016 draft. Ingram, Brown and Murray are all better than him, while Sabonis and Siakam are arguably as good as him."
Jaylen Brown  Come on home
Jaylen should consider... Jaylen Brown
  That is just one of those.   Jaylen brown only start 25 out of 74 games that yr while started all games the yr before. His minutes is reduce too and his touch I guess.  Keeping rozier and Morris after trade deadline when it is known that rozier isn't happy with his role.   Hayward starting and being 1st yr of Hayward since returning from injury.   The Jay's being young.    Morris started 53 out of 75. This guy should've got traded.   Didn't kyrie grandfather died that yr?  The young guys full of themselves after that ecf weak run. Then imagine jaylen brown suddenly not starting. Rozier reduce role etc etc. Ainge should've shipped other Morris and rozier.  But I guess blame it all on kyrie right? Might as well blame him again this time.
"Blocked Boban and Gobert, but nobody can stop an angry Jaylen Brown ü§£"
Jaylen Brown gets no respect from the refs when he drives
"Why you probably shouldn't necessarily worry about the #1 HS Junior and waste time studying their games:   Zion was the #5 recruit in his class.  Bol Bol was 4. Romeo Langford was 6.  Nassir Little was 2.   Trevon Duval was ranked ahead of Collin Sexton and Trae Young.  Josh Jackson and Harry Giles? 1-2 over Tatum.   Skal Labissierre was ahead of Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown, and Brandon Ingram.  Karl Towns was 5th. Cliff Alexander was 4th, ahead of him. So were Mudiay, Jah, and Stanley Johnson.  Austin Rivers was ahead of Anthony Davis and Bradley Beal   Josh Selby was #1 in his class. Kyrie was 4th."
"Lol  Worst team in 2007, won championship in 2008.   Drafted Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.  Built a team of Kyrie, Jaylen, Hayward, Jayson, Horford, Smart, Marcus Morris, Rozier"
[Jaylen Brown](https://youtu.be/Alo6QLaIUnE)
"Ainge putting the blame on the shitty players he decided to build around. Shitty gm, Brooklyn gave him the whole bag and he muffed it. Priced himself of the Harden sweepstakes because of Jaylen brown lol.  Suffer Boston this is your mans"
Wow even Eric Bledsoe huh  Tatum had kyrie irving/Marcus Morris/Marcus smart/al horford/jaylen brown and couldn‚Äôt even get out the second round
"Jayden Brown is intelligent as fuck.. my point was the intelligent being insulting only really applies when it's not really what is meant.   So saying anytime it's used to describe a POC it pisses you off is just dumb. Sometimes people are actually being genuine and are actually saying someone is intelligent. Other times they mean something else.  You on the other hand, clearly had trouble comprehending what I was getting at. Maybe next time, be less quick to jump on the offensive. Unless you don't think Jaylen Brown is intelligent?"
Lol at jaylen brown and Kat swap.   Edit: just saw you‚Äôre a Celtics fan. Get real dude
Sounds like KAT may be available this offseason. We will see what happens but i cant imagine they keep plugging away with this group expecting a magical turn around. Deal DLO and KAT for some other young star and build around that player and Edwards.  I woyld talk about a Jaylen Brown for KAT swap
"&gt; If we imagine the NBA decided to put all its players and coaches in a draft, and let the 30 teams pick among them, I think Stevens would probably go in the top 30 or 40 -- that is, late in the first round or maybe early in the second. That would put him in the same range as current or future All-Star players.  This was a bad take at the time, as was this one from KOC:  &gt; There‚Äôs not a single general manager who would take Stevens over Giannis in a draft that includes both players and coaches. But Stevens is not that far off. He‚Äôs undoubtedly entered the top tier of coaches across all of sports. So what would his value be in a hypothetical draft that included players, coaches, and general managers, with all salaries falling under the same salary cap? &gt;  &gt; I‚Äôd take Stevens over impressive young players like Jaylen Brown and Brandon Ingram, which means he‚Äôs ahead of high lottery picks. I‚Äôd take Stevens over the Jrue Holidays and Steven Adamses of the world, which automatically puts his value in the $20 million range.  If Stevens were worth $20 million per season, teams would be offering him $20 million per season. But the very top coaches make half that much, despite the fact that their salaries don't count against the cap or the tax."
Jaylen brown. dudes help defense IQ is absolutely atrocious
"Such as making it to the ECF with a line up of   IT, Bradley, Crowder, Amir Johnson, and Al Horford  and pushed LeBron to 7 in the ECF  Terry Rozier, sophomore Jaylen Brown, rookie Jayson Tatum, Marcus Morris and Al Horford.  Which of those is ""less with more""?"
Tatum and jaylen brown if you consider him a young player
"As a fellow Celtics fan I must agree, they‚Äôd be much better off trading Jaylen Brown. To Dallas."
"I‚Äôve seen so many Celtics games where the other team is up by 7 with 45 secs left and the announcer says ‚Äúit looks like Celtics are going to come up short,‚Äù only for jaylen brown to hit a 3 from the corner, the announcer gets excited for a comeback, and the final 30 seconds last 10 mins and the Celtics ultimately lose"
"You can't read too much into it, he's an anti-Jaylen troll who likes to karma farm on r/nba.   His whole 'schtick' on our sub was having a Jaylen flair and talking about how bad Jaylen was.    He's learning to hide it better because he keeps getting called out but if you read his comment history you'll see gems like ""he's among the worst defenders in the league right now"" and saying he's worse than Duncan Robinson overall.    So Tatum + Brown &lt; Luka is really him saying Tatum + (a huge negative) &lt; Luka."
Jaylen Brown is so fun to watch.
"Rose   Jaylen Brown  Kawhi  Timelord  Jokic  Easily a playoff starting lineup, any Kawhi+Jokic combo would be, and Brown would make the best big 3 in the league"
"Luka, Jaylen Brown, Jj Redick, Duncan Robinson, Nikola Jokic.   Pretty stacked offensively. Team defense will definitely be an issue. I see them making it to conference finals."
"Damian Lillard, Devin Booker, Paul George, Jaylen Brown, and Myles Turner.  That's a mighty fine team in my opinion."
"underrated: nicolas claxton  overrated: jaylen brown, smart"
"Sheesh, from a Celtics fan? Jaylen Brown shot 29% from 3 in college and 33.6% through March his rookie season. He's now a 38% career shooter in the NBA."
Jaylen brown maybe?
"It's crazy how those picks basically turned into Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Colin Sexton (who was traded for Kyrie Irving) and yet it is likely that the Nets will end up winning a title before the Celtics."
"18 first rounders is a ton, and I think you have to take into account just how random drafting can be. One thing I did that I found quite interesting is just pick any 7 year stretch and use a random number generator to randomly pick a list of 18 first rounders. Almost every time, you end up with a great, multiple time all-star, player.   I did it once from the 2005-2011 draft and got a team with DeMarre Carroll, Joakim Noah, Jrue Holiday and Steph Curryand then did it again with 2012-2018 draft and got Jaylen Brown, Micheal Porter Jr, Jonathan Isaac, Jamal Murray, Clint Capela, and Dennis Schroder.   18 first rounders doesn‚Äôt mean that you automatically win a championship, but it definitely means you get a top 10-15 player. You have to get really unlucky to not stumble into at least one elite player."
The one time I talked to Jaylen Brown in college was to tell him that his friends were at the frat party next door
&gt; How did Hayward not make the all star team?   Kevin Durant  Domatas Sabonis  Julius Randle  James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons  Joel Embiid  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Nikola Vucevic  Zach Lavine  Bradley Beal
I mean yeah Jaylen Brown works well with Tatum. Ingram played 1-4 with the Lakers.
Jaylen Brown?
What are some you got right? I can confidently say I defended the Jaylen Brown pick on draft night when it was getting criticized.  I remember thinking the Lakers should‚Äôve hung onto Randle but I think getting Lebron and him needing minutes to grow means it wouldn‚Äôt have worked if he stayed.
"Think about it this way.  Ben Simmons was a consensus #1 pick.  The likelihood that any of those picks ends up being #1, let alone #1 in a year where there's a clear frontrunner, is pretty low.  Yeah, you could get lucky like the Celtics did and pull off multiple top 3 picks, but that trade looks way better in hindsight and could have easily been 3 top 10-15 picks.   I'm not saying it was a bad decision necessarily, but it is true that the likelihood of any of those picks being better than Ben Simmons as a prospect is low. That doesn't even count savvy/lucky drafting on the Celtics part.  Tatum could have easily been Fultz or Lonzo (or Josh Jackson), and the next two picks after Jaylen Brown was Dragan Bender and Kris Dunn.  Just saying, 4 picks and 4 swaps isn't a guarantee of anything."
"Not in a specific order but below are the players i would take above zion.  lbj, ad, giannis, luka, kawhi, kd, dame, steph, harden, jokic, embiid, tatum, butler, jaylen brown, ben simmons, kat, chris paul  Thats 17   i think bam, simmons, booker, and paul george. are all around where zion is.   so calling him top 20 is reasonable."
We indirectly handed you Jaylen brown. How the hell you hate us?
"I don't think it will be either of those guys.  It's gotta be someone with multiple years on his deal, or has ties to Oklahoma/ the Thunder, or is on a rookie scale deal.   Ben Simmons has been in a lot of trade rumors. Jaylen Brown maybe? Trae Young? Brandon Ingram? Deandra Ayton?"
"So lets say we land a top 5 pick and snag a Mobley or Kuminga, Presti could very well use his draft assets for the future and say trade one or two of Bazley/Muscala/Horford to go get players on the caliber of say maybe a Beal, Jaylen Brown, Siakam, Sabonis. Something like that maybe. Then you would have SGA/Dort/Poku/(new draft pick)/ and one of the people mentioned above."
"It's not logic, it's math. And like I said, guys have somehow pushed their abilities to a point where they can accommodate it, but for example: Jaylen Brown had a rough game last week and he said the coaches told him he should be taking more 3's. If you check his game logs for the past week or so, it's fucking infuriating, and he's not playing well either. The guy is having a career year so far, 25 PPG scorer, and his own coaches are fucking with his shit over some math garbage. You let the dude play to his strengths, because basketball the sport still takes precedence over basketball the academic subject at a certain point.  Buckets are buckets and there is no mathematical formula to derive what happens when an excellent midrange player like JB hits a handful of easy shots when the long ones aren't falling. Telling him to keep more chucking 3's so he can score ~2-3 more points if and only if his efficiency is the same is fucking absurd."
"Seriously.    That team looked like a leading contender before anyone even knew how good Tatum and Brown were.  Tatum was a rookie that year, and Jaylen showed some stuff but was inconsistent the year before as a rookie himself.  Knowing what we know now, if things went to plan that was probably the best team in the NBA that year on paper.    Will always be a huge ""what if"" scenario.  If Hayward doesn't go down, maybe Kyrie stays engaged, and that squad goes onto win a ring or two before passing the torch over to Tatum/Brown."
"It sounds better than it is because of who Tatum and Jaylen are now. Brown had a rough season that year.   Lowry/Green/Kawhi/Siakam/Gasol with FVV/Norman/Anunoby/Ibaka off the bench is a better 9-man rotation. Pretty much everyone can defend and shoot the 3  Boston also just lost to a better team in Milwuakee. They won 60+ games. Bledsoe/Brogdon/Middleton/Giannis/Lopez in the starting lineup with Hill/Connaughton/Ilyasova/Mirotic off the bench. The bench doesn't quite stack up to Boston's, but is still so9lid. I like their starting lineup a lot more though. Two 50/40/90 type guys with 3 potential All-NBA defenders.  The difference between Kyrie as your best player and Kawhi/Giannis as your best player is a little bigger than I think people recognize."
"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily about ‚Äúwinning trades‚Äù. It‚Äôs more about establishing what you believe the value is throughout the roster currently and long term . GM‚Äôs make calls constantly asking about players. How a GM reacts establishes what the value is for that player.   So when teams ask about Jaylen Brown the last few years, they may be looking more for how Boston values that particular player. Whether if it‚Äôs to try and make a deal w Boston or to try and compare to other talent across the league or even their own roster. Ainge is going to respond in a certain way to let them know. It‚Äôs a market that‚Äôs always fluctuating. What a good young player is worth today may not be the same as last year or 5 years ago. It‚Äôs the GM‚Äôs job to constantly asses what the current market looks like so in case they want to make move, it‚Äôs in line with the demand"
"They need someone to slow down likes of LeBron, Kawhi, KD... level players.           Probably OG Anunoby, Jaylen Brown level defender."
ew i saw jaylen brown in a sixers uniform ü§Æ
"what those people don't realize is that Tatum and Brown started off the year extremely strong and then their bodies broke down trying to carry their trash can teammates. tatum catching covid only made things worse because he can't breathe properly. Also, the offensive load has caused knee issues for Jaylen and he's still playing 35 mpg every night because we have no shot at winning if he doesn't since the supporting cast sucks ass cheeks"
"I like Jaylen Brown, but he will never come close to winning an MVP"
"Miami. I feel like we'll resign Oladipo and trade him down the line for somebody else, maybe Jaylen Brown or Jason Tatum since we steal a Celtic every once in a while."
"Hey now, some of us are trying to sponsor a program where every racist Celtics fan gets dunked on by Jaylen Brown"
Celtics. My evidence is Jaylen Brown through the years.
"He would be rooting for the Nets, not against them üòÇ  But it would be like, ‚ÄúJaylen Brown is so bad, the Celtics should trade him to the Nets for Joe Harris so they can get over .500‚Äù"
Spida and Jaylen Brown  Just in Utah please
"Ah, Cedi Osman. The guy people would prefer to Jaylen Brown..."
But then Drummond will miss out on the rise to Goat status of the Celtics superstar Jaylen Brown. üòéüòéüòé
"Lol.   You had Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown on your team, signed an all star in Gordon Hayward, then traded for Kyrie Irving all while still having a decent abundance of assets.   If issues and injuries didn‚Äôt get in the way, you could have had a team with 4 elite top 20 talents."
"Gotta say, 3 ECF in the last 4 years is nothing to sneeze at. However, I will say very few players from those first two ECF runs ('16-'17 and '17-'18) and even big contributors from '18-'19 are still around, especially when you consider Jaylen Brown was playing 12 minutes a game in the first one. The only guy playing at a high level in each of the 4 years has been Marcus Smart. Like, I get there's been success, but to lump them all together is pretty disingenuous."
"Rockets ride or die but I also follow players that used to be here or that if I just like their playstyle, like Harden, RoCo, CP3, Myles Turner, Kawhi, Westbrook, KD, Dwight Howard, and Jaylen Brown off the top of my head"
Kawhi was extremely poor shooter in college. His strictly shot middies and his shots were more of a long range floater than a pure jumpshot. The Spurs shooting coach is well known as one of the best fundamentals coach in the NBA and look at Kawhi now.   Jaylen Brown couldn‚Äôt shoot a lick in college and in his  rookie year either.

Jaylen Brown gets less calls than these no-names
Sounds like describing Jaylen Brown lol
People here are underrating the pick haul. The rockets could end up with a Tatum-Jaylen Brown type young core that they can build around for 10 years on the back end as KD-Harden are retired or washed vets (they‚Äôre already in their late primes and the picks convey until 2027).  Houston messed up with the oladipo portion of the trade because he was an expiring. All to flex and say they got an ‚Äúall-star‚Äù. There was no reason to spin off Jarrett Allen and Lavert when Allen is a young stud on a restricted contract and Lavert is cost controlled.
Jaylen Brown posted this and gave all the awards
"One speed players have a much harder time than guys who shift gears well. One of the biggest developments for Jaylen Brown was getting comfortable slowing down, and keeping the guy on his hip, rather than going full speed at the rim."
Whaaaa Jaylen Brown is Muslim?  Alhumdulliah that‚Äôs pretty cool.
"Jaylen Brown has been seen in a lotta Mosques in the Atlanta area, I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs a practicing Muslim"
Jaylen Brown as well
So he's officially said he's Muslim? Because some people just fast Ramadan even without being Muslim if they got Muslim friends or family. I think Jaylen Brown is like that.
"Fournier 1st game off covid, Rob Williams out, Jaylen Brown out, Kemba Walker out, Grant Williams has played."
If Boston was smart they would trade Brown for Towns this offseason.  Jaylen and Tatum seem to get in each other's way imo. They never both really dominated a game together it is always one or the other has a great game
Jaylen Brown not getting MIP is a fucking disgrace
"ECF preview (without Durant, Harden, Jaylen Brown and Kemba)"
"I think Pat Williams is gonna fall under the archetypal wing where he slowly improves every season and eventually becomes an all star. Kinda like Jimmy, Jaylen Brown, and Kawhi."
Wasn't there some kp for jaylen brown noise too
"I got you. I‚Äôll go by the positions they are playing this year.   PG: Stephen Curry, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Damian Lillard, CP3  SG: Paul George, Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell   SF: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Julius Randle   C: Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, KAT   Top 10 in order:  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Stephen Curry  5. James Harden  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Nikola Jokic   8. Luka Doncic   9. Anthony Davis   10. Damian Lillard"
That Jaylen Brown hater salivating  right now
jaylen brown is awesome. i think tho last year was the year he had the higher chance of winning it i thought the jump he made last season was incredible even tho he‚Äôs continuing to improve now
"You're not looking at the league if you think a former mvp avergaing a triple double on an 8-2 run isn't a top 30 player. Only way to believe that is to clutch onto his struggles last year and the first month of this season without introspecting and belief-updating based on what's clearly happening in the current state of the nba.  Like, the washington wizards are sweeping the Jazz if you put brandom ingram in for russ? Jaylen brown in? Consider those hypotheticals. The list where you can confidently say 'yes' is not close to 30."
I also love Jaylen Brown. He was also neck and neck with Ingram for MIP a year back
I love Jaylen Brown but Randle deserves MIP
LeBron  Curry  KD  Harden  Kawhi  Giannis  Embiid  Jokic  Dame  Luka  Paul George  Kyrie  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Trae Young   Julias Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Ben Simmons  Zack LaVine  Nikola Vucevic  Bradley Beal  Rudy Gobert  Donovan Mitchell  Anthony Davis  CJ McCollum  Demar Derozan  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  DeAaron Fox  SGA  KAT  He‚Äôs better then 15 of these guys?

I think he has an argument, but it isn‚Äôt easily."
Lebron acting like he‚Äôs the Jaylen Brown of social consciousness
What the fuck is a Jaylen Brown
"All those years of Marv Albert calling Jaylen Brown ‚ÄúJaylen Green‚Äù by confusing him with Jeff Green, and now there‚Äôs gonna be an actual Jalen Green"
"They are asking him to play on ball instead of off ball. It‚Äôs an adjustment. Off the top of my head, tatum, booker, jaylen brown, Lavine, sexton have all struggled with the adjustment and come out better than before.  We all remember kuzma &gt; tatum during tatums second season. Or when people called sexton a 6-1 shooting guard. Or when people called dbook and Lavine chuckers.   Herro just going through the same thing"
"They keep drafting ‚Äúthe Danny Ainge special‚Äù   6‚Äô4-6‚Äô7 can defend at a high level and switch everything, but shoots like a sack of ass, banking on being able to develop that part of their game. When it works it‚Äôs stellar and you get a kid like Jaylen Brown, when it doesn‚Äôt you break remotes watching 25% shooters hoist up 3‚Äôs"
"Yeah people are too harsh on kids.   Jaylen Brown came under fire for his rough 2018-19 season, but it was really just him being injured at the start of the season.   He had an injured hand, foot, and back all in a 1-2 month span that *coincidentally* lined up with a big shooting slump. Apparently, that meant he'd forgotten how to play basketball forever.  Then he got healthy and bounced back, people were legitimately surprised.   Plus;  &gt;It‚Äôs telling that the Heat were also concerned about similar issues when they were winning big with Dwyane Wade, LeBron James and Chris Bosh.  That's not telling at all. Those are 3 incredibly dedicated and successful basketball players. If you're having the same concerns about Herro that you had about LeBron then it's not even a concern."
"Are any of those guys top 30 though?   Semi ordered ranking:   1. LeBron James  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Nikola Jokic  5. Anthony Davis 6. James Harden  7. Steph Curry  8. Kevin Durant  9. Luka Doncic 10. Joel Embiid 11. Damian Lillard  12. Jimmy Butler 13. Jayson Tatum 14. Chris Paul  15. Paul George  16. Bradley Beal 17. Karl-Anthony Towns 18. Devin Booker  19.

Khris Middleton   30. Jaylen Brown   Then you've got guys like Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is, Nikola Vucevic, Malcolm Brogdon, Domas Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, CJ McCollum, Kyle Lowry, Brandon Ingram, DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, Christian Wood that you could argue for the next 10 spots or maybe as high as 25-30th?"
Danny Green/Jaylen Brown/Jeff Green/Wiggins/Barrett/Divincenzo
I think he‚Äôs better than Jaylen Brown honestly
"Would you take Brandon Ingram over any of the following: Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, Pascal Siakam, or De'Aaron Fox? Didn't even bother including Ben Simmons or Jayson Tatum because BI isn't in the same convo add those two.  I feel like Ingram doesn't have that 2nd skill that you point to when his shot isn't falling. All of the other guys are able to impact the game outside of just scoring. I feel like the hair trigger answer might be Siakam, but I feel like even his scoring ability has more layers than just contested jumpers.  I just wonder if the Pels are risking mediocrity by trying to make Zion and Ingram work just because they maxed him already."
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown were middle schoolers as well one day.
"Jaylen brown, a few years ago, said he expected to have about 5 rings pretty early on in career."
&gt; Jaylen Brown .438  This stat helps with my Brown &gt; Tatum narrative.
If that‚Äôs the case why did we only lose by six without 4 of our six best players? Jaylen Brown sucked too? What about Pritchard?   Loser.
"Ooof completely off topic but Bally Sports needs to be criticized for messing up the graphics on the bottom ticker, showing the Bulls graphic for Jaylen Brown and the Celtics graphic for Vucevic ü§¢"
"I mean Shai was ahead up until he got hurt, and it was even more significant before the Celtics went on this run. I don‚Äôt see how we can knock Shai for being hurt and shut down by a tanking team who‚Äôs in no hurry to bring him back (because he‚Äôs too good).  Jaylen and Jayson are both historically not highly efficient players. You‚Äôre making my point for me when you argue Jaylen and Jayson play with other primary playmakers, because they NEED that to succeed, we saw the Celtics slump badly until Kamba stepped up a bit as a playmaker.  Shai put up better numbers with a G-League team around him, while Tatum/Brown have one of the best coaches in the league and have plenty of talent around them.  So yeah, you can make the sample size argument, but you‚Äôd have to actually watch Shai to see that he‚Äôs legitimately elevated this year. Like I said though, I understand taking Tatum with how he‚Äôs looked the past month or so, but Brown is too far."
I‚Äôm taking everyone in tier 7 over Jaylen Brown
Jaylen brown is too high and by a decent bit. Tatum is significantly better  Hot take but I would have KD lower than 5  Harden at 11 is joke city   Jokic at 9 oh man lol
Jaylen Brown isn't tier 6 imo

"**Positives:**  Tatum had arguably his best game of his career in every aspect outside of scoring.  Tremont Waters redemption arc.  Romeo Langford D  Jabari Parker looks solid  Jaylen Brown continues to be hot  Danny Ainge commentary was great.  **Negatives:**  We lost, obviously.  Tatum had his worst scoring game in a while.   Brad continues to play Grant even though he is absolutely terrible.  Brad.  Jaylen only 15 shots and got iced out in the fourth.   All around I‚Äôm not too worried about Tatum, I mean, he has been amazing for weeks, just had an off night. Layups he makes every time going halfway down and rolling out, not to mention our best three guards and two best playmakers were out. Losing the win streak and the current seeding (obviously there is still season left) sucks, but it isn‚Äôt a loss to freak out about."
I am considering Jaylen Brown
"~~Probably~~ **Significantly**  P.S - The average YMCA recreational player would demolish the average fan. The worst NBA player would absolutely wreck the best YMCA recreational player. Like the great Jaylen Brown said: ""There's levels to this shit."""
"He‚Äôs 26.  I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs in the same tier of value as Ben Simmons, jaylen brown, or jamal Murray aka the second tier of young prospects."
"He‚Äôs a 22 year old player. There isn‚Äôt a shortage of guys who put up 18 a game as 22 year olds.   Most of them do it without half the spacing that porter jr has. MPJ is one of those cases like Myles Turner where he sounds good in theory but not great in practice.    He seems like a siakam level player, and I think that siakam is a good contract to base him on.  And jaylen brown fleeced the Celtics with his deal. He could not dribble, defend, or shoot very well and he got 120/4. His agent deserves a blowjob for that.  Obviously he improved but yeah."
"Ok let's go through all the players putting up those numbers on that efficiency at under 2500 minutes played in the last 5 years regardless of how open they are or aren't.   Only Zion beats the efficiency. And everyone else who was even in that realm has been given a max extension. And none of them were in that realm until hitting around 4k to 5k minutes played.   Tatum at under 2500 minutes? Not even close. Donovan? Had the ppg but on like 53%ts. Jaylen? Not close and rival exec's said they would've maxed him. Ingram? Again not close. Harrison barnes got 24 a year 4 years ago and again, not close to that production at that experience.   The only way MPJ doesn't get the max is if the nuggets negotiate him out of it like Boston did with Brown. I am certain someone will ink him to a max offer sheet if he hits rfa"
"&gt;I don‚Äôt watch mpj  Do you? Getting nice steal numbers doesn‚Äôt make you a good defender.   Losing your man off ball as much as mpj does it awful. When siakam did it, the raptors got cooked by the Celtics.   When jaylen brown did it, OG slaughtered the Celtics. His defense is just not that good."
The sub is not ‚Äúfull of trade Jayson Tatum and trade Jaylen Brown‚Äù. You clearly haven‚Äôt been on there.
"Because you deleted your comment I‚Äôll reply here:  &gt;mpj has dominant stretches defensively   His defense isn‚Äôt good. It‚Äôs not just about playing on ball D. If he lets his guy just run past him off ball and get an easy cut to layup that isn‚Äôt good. That happens a lot. He doesn‚Äôt have the speed to prevent top tier wings from blowing past him either.   It‚Äôs like how people on r/nba say that Donovan, pascal siakam, or jaylen brown are ‚Äúplus defenders‚Äù.   They are all pretty mediocre defenders because their off ball skills are bad (except siakam). MPJ is in the same vein, but not nearly as good on ball as those 3.   And 2 years of coaching isn‚Äôt that far from ‚Äúbeing on the court‚Äù.  There are tons of guys like terry rozier who mostly get their experience from practice early on rather than game time. Practice makes them improve just as much. Just throwing a random rookie and giving him minutes isn‚Äôt some magical way to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù a player. He doesn‚Äôt magically have a way steeper growth curve than the other guys in his draft class because of playing time.   MPJ is a one way play finisher who puts up decent stats on easy buckets. His contract will probably be slightly less than what the raptors gave siakam, who is a significantly better player (though older). That‚Äôs about 25 mil a year."
"MPJ is worth it for them. It's kind of like the Jaylen Brown contract talks for us. People were calling it an overpay, and granted he's played his way into our #2 player (#1 on some nights), but who were we going to replace him with? We want to keep making playoff runs and he was our guy. Denver is in the same situation. They'll pay him because they like their core and think they can contend."
I think it‚Äôll be a Jaylen Brown situation where it looks like a huge overpay in the first year but looks much more reasonable as the player develops
Jaylen Brown can get hot like that.
"This year so far? Yes, and that's not a slight on Tatum, it's a compliment to just how efficient Jaylen has been and now that Tatum is ramping his game back up after COVID, I still expect Tatum to take over.  If you take a look at both Tatum and Browns splits and tracking shot dashboard on NBA.com, you would be pretty floored at Jaylens shooting numbers compared to Tatums.   Shot area:  Jaylen beats Tatum out in every area of the court except at the right corner 3.   Shot type:  Tatum only beats out Jaylen in bank shots, dunks and tip shot shooting %'s.   Shot range:  Tatum only beats Jaylen in less than 5ft shots and 30-34ft shots.   Jaylen has taken more catch and shoot shots and beats Tatum out there from 3.  Jaylen has been better pulling up from 2 but Tatum has been better pulling up from 3.   % off dribbles:  Tatum has been better off 0 dribbles from 2 but Jaylen has been better off 0 dribbles from 3  Tatum has been significantly better on 1 dribble shots  Jaylen has been better off 2 dribbles from 2 and Tatum has been better off 2 dribbles from 3.  Jaylen has been pretty significantly better off 3-6 dribbles.  Jaylen has been better off 7+ dribbles.   Closest defender:  Tatum is significantly better when defenders are 0-2 ft very tight defense.  Brown is better when defenders are 2-4ft tight defense.   Brown is better when defenders are 4-6ft open defense  Tatum is significantly better when left wide open.  I recommend checking out their numbers on NBA.com because I am too lazy to type out all of the numbers. Brown has been our best 3 level scorer so far this year. The tide might be changing though with Tatum back to early season and last season form."
"Jaylen is his second most frequent target with a pass at 6.4 a game. He averages .8 assists to Brown a game. Kemba is first, Tatum passes to him 10.1 passes a game, but only .4 assists. I think the Kemba number is so high because of the dribble/handoff/pick churn that we engage in at the start of most possessions.    https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1628369/passes-dash/?sort=FREQUENCY&amp;dir=1"
"Yeah it's what they need I think they utilize him well, this is also why every opponent who plays the Celtics focuses on Tatum he's the one who sees all the blitzes, shading defenses his way etc. He's what drives the offense.   I think the ideal version of the Celtics offense is just being a read and react on the fly type unit, everybody plays off each other and is in synch it's why I think Brad doesnt really draw up many plays. Obviously this year the offense has gotten kind of static and probably too uncreative but how they use Jaylen is in line with what they envision their offense being and why they wanted another wing. Jaylen's improvement making basic reads as a playmaker tbh I think is probably more important than his scoring for that offense and his role.  &gt;Fournier ends up being used similarly to Brown  Yeah the weak side action stuff for sure, Fournier can cut and is a good DHO guy also. Probably still also a little ahead of Jaylen in terms of reads he can make as a playmaker so you can initiate with him running pick and rolls more while he also lacks Brown's athleticism as a finisher. So I think there's where therell be some difference but overall as an archetype yeah for sure. A guy who fits in to the read and react system and isnt there to be a lead initiator more to integrate his specific strengths."
"Man if there‚Äôs anything this season has taught me it‚Äôs  the NBA is just run by narratives from assholes like Windhorst and Bill Simmons and these people spout bullshit so often that it becomes reality.   The Heat have been title contenders this entire season for no discernible reason.   Jaylen Brown and Tatum are both all stars and Young isn‚Äôt despite being more successful.  Zach Lavine has been an ‚Äúempty stats guy‚Äù his entire career and now suddenly he‚Äôs an all NBA level talent that the bulls should build around even though their record is still hot garbage.  The knicks being mediocre will save the NBA despite just being another giant market for young stars to go after their rookie contract expires.   Lamelo Ball is better than SGA, Trae Young, Ja Morant, Jason Tatum, and Dearon Fox.  I could go on and on"
Here is the full list updated on the season:  Julius Randle: 7/22  Kyrie Irving: 4/14  Giannis Antetokounmpo: 5/13  Devin Booker: 3/11  Steph Curry: 1/5  LeBron James: 2/8  Bradley Beal: 1/7  Domantas Sabonis: 2/6  Jayson Tatum: 2/6  Jaylen Brown: 2/6  John Collins: 1/7  DeAaron Fox: 1/6
"How moronically ironic are you. Lol. 'Recency bias' when Tatum's been trash for like all season up till last few weeks and you have the balls to talk about recency bias. Lol.  You'd be sitting at the couch crying about making not making playoffs instead of typing stupid comments now if Tatum didn't pop off for 2 weeks.   Yes, I said Tatum, cause he's Celtics' best player. Not Jaylen fkin' Brown."
Put Jaylen Brown as the best player on those Phoenix teams and they'll be getting top 2 picks every season. LOL.  &gt; Who are you?  Somebody who doesn't hide behind Tatum yet still getting a much worse record than Booker in a weaker conference.
"Have ja turn into a fringe mvp candidate   Have jjj be poor mans AD  Package two or three of their good role players for either a player with the potential to be a star (ie, a MPJ type of guy) or a guy who is already a fringe star (ie, Jaylen Brown) and then pray like hell there are no injuries.   No star is going to sign in Memphis as a free agent and they‚Äôre already too good to tank to draft another star so they have to be in the right position at the right time to nab someone in a trade"
Dort for Jaylen Brown let's go
"Jaylen Brown is the best ""if only he actually dunked it"" dunk attempter. He always soars over the defense and cocks it back impossibly far only to lose control once he hears the whistle and then goes to the line. Bridges actually does the damn thing and it's just gorgeous to watch"
"Ok, say McMillan says ‚ÄúCam, we are going to play you every minute (about 36) that Jaylen Brown is on the floor. Your sole purpose is to guard him. If you can limit him to 20, that‚Äôs going to be great‚Äù.  Cam can limit Jaylen to 20, whilst giving you 8 of his own, on even WORSE shooting than what Jaylen is putting up. Jaylen Brown‚Äôs shooting efficiency is .593 TS% so you‚Äôre telling jokes if you think he‚Äôs an inefficient chucker.   What happens when somebody needs to double Tatum? Is Cam excluded from that play? What if Cam is switched onto Kemba in a PNR situation and Trae is switched onto Jaylen. Do you send Cam to double Jaylen and leave Kemba wide open?  Or you‚Äôre ok with living with a 4 on 5 scenario with Jayson Tatum on the floor?  Who will be sent for the help defense? Will it be Capela? Cause Capela is such a versatile, switchable defender like Siakam and Bam are.  No I forgot, D‚ÄôAndre Hunter is going to slow him down.  The entire game is going to consist of 1 on 1 matchups between Tatum/Hunter and Jaylen/Reddish, and Atlanta are going to win the +/- of those matchups lmao."
I promise you Jaylen Brown is a better player than Devin Booker.
"Jaylen Brown averaged 19.5ppg on 18/48 shooting against us with Cam has his primary defender. Is he:   A) An inefficient chucker   B) Able to be affected and slowed down by Cam Reddish and that's why he shot 18/48   It literally has to be one of these, which is it? And you've really devolved to insults, like immediately. So funny"
"My bad! I messed up on the last part. I‚Äôll add a note that I was wrong.  I think the difference in who both teams were missing is more about the way they affected team lineups. I love Jaylen Brown but he‚Äôs not a point guard. Jeff Teague is... Teague though he did have a relatively good game for him.  You guys have other people in those positions that could play.  I don‚Äôt think those are excuses. Things wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be different otherwise, but there are such things as ‚Äúscheduled losses‚Äù so to speak. It would be especially impactful with Tatum having difficulties with fatigue and that was reflected in his offense and defense on the back to back.   Again you guys have had a lot to deal with too. But if anything that means those games should mean even less rather than be relied upon in judging either team"
Jaylen Brown is not better than Booker
"&gt; First loss, we had no kemba, smart, or theis. Jaylen brown played point guard in a lineup with Tatum (struggling with coming back from covid), Javonte Greene, Semi Ojeleye, and Tristan Thompson. We played against Trae/Huerter/Reddish/Collins/Capela and still only lost by 8.   Fair, but we were missing Hunter and Bogi - two starters. You can argue Smart/Walker are more important sure.    &gt; Next loss was the second game of a back to back on the road having played four games in six days. You were also coming off a back to back but hadn‚Äôt had such a condensed schedule. We had just played the Mavericks and you had just played the Cavs. Tatum was having fatigue issues and scored 13 points on 4/20 which I doubt will happen when we play you again.    This is honestly just kind of excuses. That's literally your schedule   &gt; we had Kemba who scored 28 points on 62.5/62.5/100 which would have made him the highest scoring player in either of the two losses.   This is literally not even true: Trae had 40 and Tatum had 35 in the first game. Trae had 31 in our loss. Trae had 33 in the 3rd game and Gallo had 38"
"Jaylen isn‚Äôt exactly a lockdown defender himself. He‚Äôs above average on-ball, but I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs equally below average off-ball.  Booker is having a down year, but I can see what you mean there. I‚Äôm just not sure the defensive argument works for the gap between Lavine and Brown though"
Tbh I think Lavine vs Brown depends on what you need. Lavine is a way better scorer so I think he's a better first option but Jaylen is a 2 way star so he's a better supporting star. Overall I think you could say Brown &gt; Lavine or Lavine &gt; Brown and it would be fair imo
And Jaylen Brown.
1. Paul George   2. Kyrie Irving  3. Bradley Beal  4. Zach Lavine   5. Jaylen Brown
"Bam guards 1-5 too and did it the entire playoffs last year.   Bam this szn against teams best players:  Lebron: 2/8 25%  Jaylen brown: 4-14 28%  Julius randle: 7-18 39%  Brad beal: 1-7 14%  Giannis: 5-13 38%  Sabonis: 1-5 20%  John collins: 1-7 14%  He has multiple game winning blocks this year as well, and hes now 3 or 4 in dpoy ranking. Idk why only now is he getting put into the conversation"
"Love it. Is it just me or have several top players stepped up their game since the bubble and early season criticism? I'm not sure Kemba has been openly criticized. However, Tatum and Jaylen Brown positively dominant presence on the floor has positioned Kemba in a lesser role.  Steph, Russ, Simmons and Embiid all got dragged last season or early this season by fans and/or media for lackluster play. All of them are BALLING OUT now."
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown
He tweeted that Bogi &gt; Jaylen Brown. Why would anyone take him seriously anymore?
"jaylen brown will focus on whatever jaylen brown wants to focus on. boston fans will do well to pay attention, lord knows history is not on that city's side."
"If it's anything below manslaughter or a 'not guilty' verdict, there will be protests. Hell, I think NBA players like Jaylen Brown would be out there protesting too.  I'm hoping the justice system does something right in this case..."
"No Kemba to start the year, Smart missed a month , Tatum had bad covid sysmptoms, we lead the league in games missed to covid by a wide margin, the roster consists of mostly 1st and 2nd year players, rob williams is on minutes restrictions, Jaylen Brown has been run into the geound because he is the only one staying healthy. There are a ton of reasons for the disappointing record. Team is finally getting healthy and we added a huge depth piece in Fournier, watch out for this squad they got a fat chip on the shoulder right now"
If I could make the case for the Boston Celtics.  1. 17 championships is tied for most ever. 2. Larry Bird was a fucking monster. 3. Jayson Tatum is a 23 year old superstar and Jaylen Brown is pretty damn good himself.  4. Bill Russell can‚Äôt fit all of his rings on two hands.  5. Tacko Fall
"Hell, I've liked him since he started turning heads his sophomore season, and I'm not a Celtics fan. Same goes for Jaylen Brown.   Having 2 highly successful wings is no joke in the modern NBA, kinda like the Kawhi/PG pairing. Just need to round out the roster a bit to get to that next level. Too bad the Kyrie/Hayward thing didn't work out while the Jays were showing promise."
That one fucked me up so bad sir. JAYSON TATUM AND JAYLEN BROWN HAVE PEAKED TOGETHER
It's devic3 bro the biggest jaylen brown fan
B-Town Jaylen Brown
"Yeah from my perspective getting Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Romeo Langford, Kyrie Irving because of a trade was a terrible idea"
"Jaylen Brown, Simmons and Randle off the bench"
"Totally ignoring that Philadelphia went out and got shooters (Seth Curry, Danny Green, George Hill).  Thompson is a fine Kanter replacement comparison but Robert Williams and Daniel Theis are 2 totally different players where the offense is run differently and have different defensive styles.  We also don‚Äôt have Hayward and we have yet to see what Fournier (and Jabari Parker if you want to include him) can bring to the team at full strength.  This is also ignoring the context that Simmons was injured and didn‚Äôt play in the series last year, and Embiid is dominating way more this season than he has in the past. Plus Jaylen Brown has emerged more as a ball handler (with Hayward‚Äôs departure).  Both teams are totally different."
It‚Äôs clear you dont actually watch basketball. Your unrelenting negativity about Jaylen Brown specifically is baffling. He‚Äôs scored 40 3x this year and one was without Tatum. This is either Donavan Mitchell‚Äôs  burner account having fun at browns expense or your just an idiot who picked a name on the roster at random to slander.
Draymond is being nice. Boston is like 20-5 without Jaylen Brown in the lineup or something like that. They generally play better without Brown.
You said Jaylen Brown would never score 40 without Tatum playing and he did it 3 months ago against a top 3 team in the league you're an ignorant negative fool
Him and jaylen brown are my favorite duo.
Jaylen Brown was out.
There was a video where he was telling jaylen brown ‚Äúi own you‚Äù after hitting a 3 in his face in the most sociopathic way. Curry rubs me the wrong way in all his celebrations.
Also in r/nba: ‚ÄúWe should trade Jaylen Brown for Norman Powell.‚Äù  I think everyone in this sub can guess who said it.
Jaylen Brown &gt; Siakam
Jayson Tatum is worse than Jaylen Brown and the most overrated player in the league
Jaylen Brown exists
Lmao nice one  All I‚Äôm saying is those picks could be Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum or they could be Dragan Bender and Josh Jackson but right now they are nothing. You disagree?
"if your going to determine a young player potential on a stat that has Jordan Clarkson, kemba Walker, Danillo Galinari as is best 3 players, than I dont think you understand how player development works.  Being able to hit the three opens up the rest of your game. Hes been extremly accurate from three as of late Im not gonna penalize his potential because hes not shooting 6-8 threes a game  You keep talking about his fg% so I looked at it  **Heres three wing/foward players relatively similar to RJ and were drafted in the same spot at RJ:**  Jayson tatum second year: 45%  Bradley Beal second year: 41%  Jaylen Brown at second year: 46%  **Now lets look at Rjs most common player comps that i¬¥ve seen: Im sure there are others but I dont see many player comps for RJ**  Jimmy Butler at sceond year: 47%  Demar Derozan at second year: 47%  Im not saying hes any of those players but the numbers are pretty similar and on top of that he also brings good defense to his team.   **Heres some more wings/fowards  in case you think im just cherry picking**  Brandon Ingram(#2 overall) second year: 47%  Luka Doncic (3rd overall) second year: 46% Luka and RJ aren¬¥t nearly on the same level and im not trying to compare them. Just showing different wings   Devin Booker (#13 overall) 42% (shitty comparison as well but also somewhat fits the requirements of this list)  What im trying to say is harping on efficiency splits for a 20 year old wing isnt the way to go"
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are still particularly *soft*
"Trust me bro, being modest is one thing, but you don‚Äôt want to make the mistake of calling Herro a good defender.  Ant is sort of like Jaylen Brown on defense, he‚Äôs pretty amazing to watch when he‚Äôs locked in, and he hasn‚Äôt learned the team defense yet. That‚Äôs better that Herro"
"Jaylen Brown probably, but not a big enough leap. He was already a fringe all star last year (although so was randle)"
"zion aint a good example of young all star level, hes more like all nba and a franchise guy.  try someone like jamal murray or jaylen brown, its still probably the all star level guy though"
Evan Fournier is already a better fit with the starters. Jaylen Brown should never start again but Brad is too scared to bench him.
2016 is an argument as many feel Jaylen Brown has a realistic claim there and I don't think anyone is gonna be close to Zion in 2019 draft class. But the rest of the years are locks
"Yes, yes in fact they are.  Blake doesn‚Äôt have to put any effort into trying to score, meaning other things come easier.  For another example of this :  Jaylen Brown didn‚Äôt just magically lose all of his defensive skills this year. He is a worse defender because he is putting in more effort and energy on offense. This is a real thing that exist, yes. Trying to denying it is just stupid.  Kyrie and KD 100% make those things easier for him."
I wish we have Garland instead of Jaylen Brown. He's so much better.
"I mean you can literally see how Melo has influenced Randle's game. He's also trained Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Cole Anthony, and so many others."
"He just needs to improve his handle, he doesnt get to his spots consistently, and its limiting his game. Thats what unlocked Jaylen Brown this year, Siakam is soooo close to being a legit franchise player"
Jaylen Brown
"In theory, anybody who shoots 33% from 3, is shooting it higher when they are ‚Äúwide open‚Äù. Jaylen Brown shot 34% in 2018, and lol if you wanna leave him wide open like you‚Äôd leave Simmons open, good luck with that."
"Turner isn‚Äôt worth 20 million dollars a year for being a pure rim protector. He‚Äôs not a great shooter, passer, or screener on offense.   20 mil is around what Randle, jerami grant, Lavine earn and a touch less than jaylen brown. Also a bit more than capella.   That‚Äôs not a plus contract given that he‚Äôs not close to as good as any of these guys. He‚Äôs not an albatross like Bertrans is at 20 a year, but he‚Äôs still not a great deal.  And ainge wasn‚Äôt the only person who made that valuation. He emphasized that he shopped Turner around to see what his value was, and nobody wanted to give up anyone good for him.   Indy played themselves, just like they always do by refusing trades with Boston."
"The Heat. Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown, and Jayson Tatum feels way more scary to face when hot."
I think he might be my new favorite non-heat player. Step aside Jaylen Brown
"I‚Äôm in the championship too but I have goddamn Lebron and jaylen brown and Brandon Ingram and Christian wood and all those fuckers missing games. Anderson had a baller game last night tho, dude consistently fills up the stat sheet, can make you some 3s, score double digits, get you assists, get 5+ rebounds, get you a steal and close to a blk, he‚Äôs really a super underrated fantasy player because he helps you in so many categories and that‚Äôs valuable."
a reverse Jaylen Brown
Me too! Drafting Julius Randle in the 8th round and Jaylen Brown in the 4th really put me on top this year.
"Tatum had been our only good defender for most of this year. Our bad team defence isn‚Äôt on him. I watch every Celtics game, jaylen brown had been bad, Tatum is still elite in that end."
We are better without Jaylen Brown.
"Feel bad he got hurt but yeah, Boston plays so much better without Jaylen Brown. Evan Fournier is 10 times better alongside Jayson Tatum.  It would be in everyone's best interest to move on. I've said this before but Ainge blew it by not trading Brown for Harden. Now he has to sell Brown at a loss."
"You're not wrong. I think Tatum is overrated and Brown is underrated, but let's put that aside.  My question then would be: Why hasn't Jaylen made the leap? Even when Kemba has been healthy, he hasn't been that good. Some of that has to be on Stevens. Maybe Ainge is more to blame, maybe they share the blame."
Jaylen Brown falls asleep off ball quite a bit.
Jaylen Brown looks like he is good at defense.
In no particular order. -Ben Simmons -Joel Embiid -Steph Curry -Jaylen Brown -Kyle Lowry
Even though it‚Äôs FTC I have to admit I love jaylen brown for his work off the court and I hope he continues to combat systemic oppression
"Dame, Giannis, Jaylen Brown, Kyrie, Gary Trent Jr"
Jaylen Brown is a pseudo intellectual just like Kyrie
"The hypothetical player BI could be traded for doesn't exist. Ingram checks most of the boxes such as shooting, age, and he actually isn't a ballhog contrary to popular belief. He is malleable to what the team needs. The big issue with him is defense. Players like Jaylen Brown or Tatum would be a better fit with the Pelicans due to the defense but there isn't a realistic way to get them."
"Probably because the top questions aren't ""hey tatum do you and jaylen brown scissor"""
Yeah I remember that one too. Jaylen Brown half told the media that the Warriors needed to be more humble after the Warriors has beaten them during their 24 game wins streak.  I‚Äôm just saying it takes a lot to get him in this mode lol
He talks shit.[ Here‚Äôs him chirping Jaylen brown ](https://youtu.be/7UOzhJhACOY) but ya he basically only does it if someone tries to instigate it first it seems
&gt;Not sure Tatum and Brown are good enough to win a title .  Tatum is on his way to being a top 5 player in the next few years. Jaylen is gonna be a top 15 player. Are we really going to ask this after a season where Boston has been absolutely demolished by injuries and covid?
"Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown:  A combined 51/13/8 with 5.4 turnovers on 57.8% TS and 58.6% TS respectively  Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo:  40/16/12 with 4.8 turnovers on 60.1% TS and 62.6% TS respectively, with better defense.   Scoring at high volume isnt everything guys, Bam and Jimmy generate the same amount of offense with better efficiency, rebounding, and defense."
"sigh of relief, does not seem like Jaylen Brown has a significant injury"
"If you're talking about Trae I honestly don't think they would have him top 30 either. Their next five would probably be something like Simmons, SGA, Middleton, LaMelo, and Jaylen Brown."
"Yeah. Most of the heavy hitters drafted in the past 10 years have all ended up in the West. AD, Luka, Zion, Dame, Towns (even though his team sucks), Booker, Donovan Mitchell, SGA, Gobert, Fox, Ingram, Morant, Jokic.  Meanwhile, the East drafted Giannis, Embiid, Trae Young, Beal, Tatum, Simmons, Jaylen Brown, Bam."
Nobody can convince me that this isn‚Äôt the second account of the ‚ÄúCeltics fan‚Äù who shits on Jaylen Brown at every opportunity
Sure. Throw in Beal. Throw in Booker. Hell Lavine and Jaylen Brown
"The problem is the league has had an influx of talent the past few years, and people can't separate that just because a ton of star caliber players enter the league in a short period doesn't mean Westbrook is a washed up bum because some of these young guys surpass him, while some of the other top players from his MVP season like Curry, LeBron, Davis, Durant, Kyrie, Butler, Dame, etc. haven't really fallen off.   Just since Westbrook's MVP season, we've added Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, Luka Doncic, Trae Young, SGA, Zion, and Ja Morant through the draft. Combine that with other rookie contract guys from his MVP season like Ben Simmons, Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, Domantis Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Towns, Embiid, Lavine, Capela, Oladipo, Jokic, Giannis, and Gobert all developing into star level players."
Jaylen Brown?
Jaylen Brown would be my pick for a president out of Nba players. Dude is a fucking genius.
"The amount of dumb takes in this thread are making my nose bleed.  The Celtics have good talent on their team - they‚Äôre having a rough year where their best player and pretty much everyone else has gotten COVID (and that dude is matching records made by Larry Fucking Bird just this week). They‚Äôve experienced significant talent drain at a variety of positions and are filling them out with rookies (some performing admirably, some not). They‚Äôll suck this year and try and figure it out the next.  I wanna know who all of these GMs are that would do a better job than Ainge at constructing this team. PP and Nesmith look like good picks. Robert Williams looks like a fucking steal. Jayson Tatum may be one of the best draft moves of all time. Jaylen Brown is also great. Sorry we don‚Äôt have the location pull of a Brooklyn or New York.  Ainge and Stevens are here to stay. We‚Äôre gonna win a ton of games. And if for some reason one of them gets fired around 25-27 other teams will be climbing over eachother to sign them. Peace out."
"&gt; What is the TS % of other 20 ppg scorers?  Um.....much better than that lol Here's the top 20 by PPG with their TS%  Steph Curry, 66%  Beal 59%  Luka 59%  Giannis 63%  Lillard 61%  Lavine 63%  Zion 65%  Kyrie 60%  Tatum 58%  Mitchell 57%  Jokic 65%  Booker 59%  Trae - 59%  Kawhi 62%  Fox 57%  Jaylen Brown 59%  Sexton 58%  Randle 58%  Ingram 59%  Vuc 58%"

"I disagree, the 2018 team was much more playoff competent than this team. You need a guy like Butler in the playoffs, your team now has nobody even close to that. Embiid can only do so much in the post. You‚Äôll see come playoff time that the rest of the team is gonna let Embiid down.   That‚Äôs mostly speculation about having Dwight in 2018, he was a much different player at that time and it‚Äôs not really relevant tbh.   Kemba has a rough time against a lot of people, because he is washed. Kyrie will make him look silly. Jaylen brown is roughly the same height as him and owned him as well. It‚Äôs pretty disrespectful to Kyrie to suggest Thybulle will even make him break a sweat lol. This is coming from a Celtics fan."
"You have some points, but to say ""a mf like lebron who been rich his whole life""... 1 sentence later ""Eliminated in a play in game. At the hand of curry""  You realise LeBron was raised as a broke mfer till 15+ right? And Curry was born with a millionaire dad who was a role model for him on work ethic, success etc?  Calm down man. Hate to tell you but they were all cowards about Hong Kong and except for Jaylen Brown and a couple others, no one said/did anything significant regarding George Floyd/BLM.  Also they all jump to superteams...AD, Kd, Irving, harden, kawhi, PG, Cp3 have all moved in last 2 years to favourable teams. You only  have jokic, Curry, doncic, dame and Giannis basically that stayed."
I got downvoted yesterday for saying Jaylen Brown had a bad game even though he hit a game winner
Why is Jaylen Brown always leaving his defensive assignment??
"Not even close. Kawhi, Siakam, Jaylen Brown."
Jaylen Brown is an All-Star
Jaylen Brown is averaging 33 ppg when Tatum is not playing this season. Using career highs is stupid as shit. I guess Tatum is a much better offensive force than Joel Embiid and Kevin Durant because his career high is more than both. Saying that Jaylen is subpar on defense is legitimately stupid. He‚Äôs one of the best on-ball defenders in the league and takes the toughest matchup each night. His off-ball D is slightly above average.
If Jaylen Brown is so good then why does your team suck shit?
"Simmons' career high is 1 point less than Jaylen's =, he provides all defensive defense and Jaylen has been subpar on that end, and has great playmaking. I wouldn't start want him as my primary scorer by any means but if there are 2 teams with Simmons and Brown as the best player, all things the same, I think Simmons' team is better"
Jaylen Brown got him once in a regular season game a couple years back
"Every single GM in the league including Morey would trade Simmons for Jaylen Brown lmfao  Context is that Jaylen took a massive leap this season, produces in the playoffs, can score from all three levels at an elite level, plays both ways, and was higher than Simmons in All-Star voting while Simmons is the same player he was in his rookie year."
Lets just say no GM in the league would trade Simmons for Jaylen Brown. What context do you want? Brown has been playing in a better team  in his years and Simmons has been much more decorated
And he‚Äôs still worse than Jaylen Brown. Context is important.
"Charlie Brown Jr, Jaylen Hoard, Gabriel Deck, Josh Hall, Justin Robinson  Heard any of those names before?  Our best player the past month is an undrafted Sophomore."
Khalid = Jaylen Brown
Yup and he often gets in zions way. Rather trade ingram for a 3 and D wing like Jaylen Brown.
"Jaylen Brown is a borderline superstar, Tatum is no question a superstar"
Javonte Green = DaBaby  Jaylen Brown = Khalid  Kyrie Irving = Uncle Drew
Jaylen Brown and Y‚Äôlan Noel
I have him tagged as Jaylen Brown fucked his mom
Same but Jaylen Brown.
I don't know if Jaylen Brown has missed a corner three in his entire life.
https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2021/04/28/mike-gorman-says-jayson-tatum-jaylen-brown-not-celtics-leaders/amp basically says they need more veterans but he did say this.
"Jaylen Brown and Ben Simmons are, in fact, different players. WTF is this post?"
"Jaylen brown was a god damn bum tonight, and Fournier has been the worst trade deal in the history of trade deals"
He's shown more hustle and heart than Jaylen Brown ever did.  We really need more athletes like him and Mac Jones in Boston.
Really need to direct some of that to Jaylen Brown.  My guy hasn't played a single possession of defense the entire season.
Jayson Tatum deserves so much better than someone like Jaylen Brown.  Jaylen Brown is an embarrassment to the Celtics jersey and he should be embarrassed he even considered himself to be Tatum's equal. Aaron Nesmith showed more hustle and heart in one game last game than Brown did for the entire season. But we all know Brown is going to make some feel-good PR message after the game so green teamers will forgive him.  Brown needs to personally apologize to Jayson Tatum and the rest of the team at the very minimum. I hope Danny Ainge trades him in the off-season.
Game probably wouldn't be this close if Jaylen Brown didn't have this shitty of a game....
He has been tragically bad. Tatum deserves better than someone like Jaylen Brown.
Jaylen brown sulking emo ass what a fuckin loser
JAYLEN BROWN IS LOCKED THE FUCK IN
Downtown Jaylen Brown
Fucking Jaylen Brown
"Jaylen Brown should be embarrassed, he's holding Tatum back."
lol Jaylen Brown trying to play hero ball now
Jaylen Brown clearly jealous of Jayson Tatum and is trying to be the overtime hero - terrible basketball IQ
Jaylen Brown should personally apologize to this man for being so bad.
Jaylen Brown bro
Jaylen Brown is worse than N'Keal Harry.
wtf is jaylen brown doing today
"Brown/Tatum have both taken huge steps to try and become better playmakers   and considering they're only 24/22, i imagine they'll get even better  Tatum has gone from 2.1 to 3 to now 4.4 apg the last 3 seasons  Jaylen has gone from 1.4 to 2.1 to 3.4 apg the last 3 seasons  to think of them as like these two guys that just wanna score and not pass is untrue"
Jaylen Brown is the greatest San Antonio Spur since Tim Duncan
jaylen brown is the best player on the spurs
"You would think Jaylen Brown, Tatum, and Smart would have some shame/pride at this point...It shouldn't be all on Stevens."
Lavine &gt; SGA &gt;= Booker &gt; Jaylen Brown &gt; Mitchell
Already significantly better than Jaylen Brown.
correction jaylen brown boomed you
"For sure. Basketball reference has an adjusted shooting section that attempts to do that. I just did the math myself and depending on if you use raw numbers or percentages, Kobe's TS% of .548 in 1997-98 is equivalent to about .596-.598 this season, which is slightly above Luka, CP3, Jamal Murray, and right around Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, and Jimmy Butler."
I would not trade Jaylen Brown for Ben Simmons
"Yeah a lineup of  PG: Dame  SG: Marcus Smart  SF: Jaylen Brown  PF: Jayson Tatum  C: Tim Duncan   Could be absolutely absurd on both ends of the court. The worst guy is Smart and he completely covers for Dames weakness as a defender. The only hole would be if teams tried to go big and attack Tatum, but that would almost definitely cause more problems for them trying to cover Tatum than it would for the Celtics since Tatum could easily beat almost any PF big enough to create a mismatch and could honestly still probably hold his own defensively."
"Lol he actually was fired before KP was traded, but was reportedly fired for attempting to trade him. A big rumor at the time was that Boston was offering Jaylen Brown and a 1st, which I really wish we took"
PG: Jalen Brunson  SG: Jaylen Brown  SF: Jimmy Butler  PF: Jordan Bell  C: Uhh... Jaron Blossomgame
"Yes. But I don't consider it that much of ""a point"" unless he tells us what exactly is Wiseman worth in 5 years. If the answer is ""maybe more, who knows"", then I can counter it with ""maybe less, who knows"", because Jaylen Brown is not the only top pick we know. There is nothing connecting Brown to him of all people particularly."
Half y‚Äôall woulda traded Jaylen Brown his rookie year
Jaylen Brown please
Jaylen Brown!
"At scoring sure they are even I would say, but Tatum is a far better passer and defender than Jaylen Brown is."
"It feels like a fantasy 2k matchup between an 80s team and a modern team. I still don‚Äôt like Trae and his antics but he can ball. Knicks haven‚Äôt got a good one, but you‚Äôve gotta cover him with a big wing.  Julius so far in his own head... but I like him being aggressive. And for Knicks fans, do you see a Jaylen brown progression being possible for RJ?"
I could definitely see him making it as an all-star/near all-star one day in a Jaylen Brown-esque role. Plenty of guys improve a ton from 20 to 24 years old. We'll just have to see.
Selecting Jaylen Brown at 3 is the other. He wasn't ranked anywhere near there pre-draft
He talks a lot of shit but tons of nba writers and podcasters im a fan of think he was an all NBA level player this season and one of the best two way players in the league. If you watched Miami this year you‚Äôd know they kinda sucked without him and were great when he was healthy playing. He‚Äôs very very very overtly obviously better than Jaylen Brown at least. Brown couldn‚Äôt do what Jimmy did last year.
"Lol. If the Jaylen Brown-less Celtics can push it to 5, a Giannis/Jrue/Khris led team can push it further than that."
That‚Äôs not how sports works. The fact that the Celtics without Jaylen Brown missing pulled off a win is insane because that team is literally Tatum and G league players
I think SGA and Jaylen Brown would definitely be all-stars
Ingram is 23 so I think he‚Äôs a good bet .  I personally think Jaylen brown will be perennial all star
Sports as a whole create a very interesting dynamic between how people view athletes and race. I‚Äôll keep my thoughts to myself since I know the demographics of Reddit..but kyrie nor jaylen brown are wrong with their statements. This is also one of the reasons people hate lebron for no reason.
"All you can rely on is counting stats which is pretty weak, especially considering how slowly jimmy got to come along. Barely played his first year in the league. Right now he‚Äôs a way better more complete player than Jaylen Brown. Browns great but I don‚Äôt see how anyone picks him over Jimmy Butler right now"
"Ah yes, boston is going to get knocked out by a super stacked team while missing Jaylen brown, they should blow it up."
if tyler herro doesn't become jaylen brown level at bare minimum the trades that miami passed up on are gonna look not too great. people make fun of Boston for not trading Brown for paul george or butler so what are they gonna say about HERRO?
"Please tell me this man is better than Paul George, Jaylen Brown, and Jayson Tatum again Heat fans"
‚ÄúBetter than Jaylen Brown‚Äù
I remember being told this man was better than Jayson Tatum or Jaylen Brown by some people.
I mean I don‚Äôt actually think Celtics will beat the nets if they did without Jaylen brown that‚Äôd be prob the biggest disappointment in nba history
"Celtics with Jaylen Brown could make it a series. Heat are still getting swept regardless. They should've traded for Harden, but heat culture..."
"&gt; If Tatum can just drop 50 points every night, I think Boston might have a real shot here.  Or if Jaylen Brown was there so they could combine for 50-60 ... T_T"
"Jaylen Brown doesn't get hurt, this might have been an interesting series.  Instead, the C's are probably going to go down in a gentleman's sweep, 4-1.  And I say this as a Celtics fan.  Pity.  Brown's one of the best perimeter defenders I've ever seen."
just cause joe harris came out hot which jaylen brown on the floor could‚Äôve prevented doubles early on
If they didn't have Harden they'd lose to the celtics without Jaylen Brown
"Hot take, if the Nets didn‚Äôt have Harden there is a legitimately chance that they lose against the Celtics with Jaylen Brown in the first round. It‚Äôs crazy how much Harden makes them better"
"jaylen brown is wrong about this, sorry. he prob means well, but all he's saying here is we should be prioritizing the feelings of people you might accuse of being racist, than racists or racism.   racism is so pervasive in america, your schools literally teach it. why is it so far off the pail to be assumed to be racist? over half the people in the comments have racialized beliefs they dont even reflect about.   if you dont think you're a racist, and someone calls you one, its not as big a deal as, say, racism that keeps most black people in impoverished neighborhoods, getting harassed and murdered by cops while a select few of them are allowed to play with rubber balls to entertain people for millions of dollars?   yea boston has a reputation for being racist. so stop being racist, instead of sorting who should and shouldn't be called a racist. the NBA is a structurally racist institution, look at its demographic breakdown by organizational position. yea there's lots of work to do.... it's not spending your platform defending assholes because they *might* not be racist."
Jamal Murray  Paul George  CJ McCollum  Anthony Davis  Brandon Ingram  Christian Wood  Kevin Durant / James Harden  Khris Middleton  Jaylen Brown  Russell Westbrook  Caris Levert  Nikola Vucevic  All averaged more PPG than KP
"For the longest time I thought Tatum was overhyped, and took attention away from jaylen brown. I‚Äôm fucking stupid. Tatum is daddy now"
"Phil jackson predicted many things but fans didnt wanna aknowledge them. Fans went crazy when phil tried to trade KP for jaylen brown, the nets picks that ended up tatum and crowder and got him fired only for KP to get traded for DSJ and 2 picks next season"
"I can‚Äôt imagine having your head so far up your anus that you think JAYLEN BROWN is downplaying racism. JAYLEN.  BROWN.   Literally the most outspoken player in the NBA when it comes to social justice. He‚Äôs calling it like it is, Kyrie being a convoluted narcissist who can‚Äôt take negativity"
"Curry deserves all the credit more so than KD, because Curry and Draymond were the LEADERS of that team, leadership men‚Äôs s a lot outside of the stat line. Also Curry and Kyrie were the last great All star guards to be on the finals, besides Lowry of course who is also a great leader. Before that we have to go back to Tony Parker and Jason Kidd, this goes to show how‚Äôs difficult is to make it to the final when led by a small guard as your best player. Nash couldn‚Äôt do it, AI almost did. Kobe is a big guard who can play forward, as is Dwayne. This is why Curry and Dame get a pass more so than KD, Lebron, Giannis or Embiid. Also Dame loses series where he is expected to lose, he has also won when he wasn‚Äôt suppose to.  The player who doesn‚Äôt get enough criticism in my book is Porzingis who has fell off which can be chalked up to injuries, but still. Demand Derozan use to be talked about with Klay, PG and Jimmy. Jimmy redeemed himself from losing that series up 2-0 on the Celtics after rondo got hurt, thanks to his finals run, but now his performance this series another disappointment, even as the underdog. Kawhis leadership in the clutch, as well as James Harden. Russ Westbrook only gets triple double in the regular season has made 1 second round appearance since KD departure. Brandon Brandon Ingram with a third straight season of leading his team to the lottery. Jayson Tatum is #1, Jaylen Brown is second fiddle, that convo is over."
Clippers series is a 50-50 to me the Celtics go 0 chance minus jaylen brown. Sorry Celtics fans
"Love that answer, and starting to love Jaylen Brown more and more off the court.  Kyrie as usual meant well but threw out a blanket statement without the nuance or intelligent thought that JB‚Äôs statement has."
"I'm not saying its rigged, just that the NBA has a preferred outcome, Nets dropping a game or two makes them look mortal and beatable, which hurts the hype/marketing for the MIL series, which the NBA cares more about than this series.  Now if Jaylen Brown were healthy this'd be a whole nother story but alas hes hurt"
Jaylen Brown is a special human being
"Bradley Beal, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Jaylen Brown made the All Star game over Trae. Julius is a Forward."
I know the Celtics are missing Jaylen Brown but man Kemba isn't the same guy he was in Charlotte. It's time for them to move on
The Celtics might actually had a chance if Jaylen Brown were healthy. Nets couldn't defend anything despite the referees doing their best to keep them in the game.
Oh imo it's jaylen brown though
That‚Äôs like the first rule of Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown is who Kyrie thinks he is.
You should consider Jaylen Brown.
God Jaylen Brown would be such a difference maker right now
This was an excellent response both acknowledging the problem and deflecting responsibility from his fan base. The problem I have is that his exact wording ‚ÄúI do not like the way it was brought up in the construct of a playoff game‚Äù is such a high bar for a proper conversation of racism and was the same construct for the response that people had against Colin Kaepernick. If you set the ground rules for when it‚Äôs proper to have the discussion of racism in the US you‚Äôre battling a losing argument. The league cancelled postseason games due to racism when they were in the bubble and Jaylen Brown was vocally supportive of the cancellations to protest racism.
"Lmao imagine having Kyrie, KD, and Harden and the refs and losing to the Celtics without Jaylen Brown."
"Remember that intelligence is not one size fits all; there are different types and aspects of intelligence.  Rondo seems like a basketball obsessive with incredible spatial intelligence and pattern recognition.  OTOH, Jaylen Brown seems to excel as an analytical thinker who can untangle complex ideas in a really sophisticated way.   Both are 'smart' but in totally different ways."
I miss Jaylen Brown sooooo much
someone like...Jaylen Brown?
Now imagine this team with Jaylen Brown
If the Celtics kept SCARY TERRY and didn't get Kemba they could take this series to 6. Maybe even win if Jaylen Brown was healthy!
Trade Jaylen brown for kawhi? Relive that shit again? Lmao
Jaylen Brown: He won't break into your house and wreck up the place when you're asleep
Double digit lead in the 3rd quarter? Imagine if we still had Jaylen Brown!
Is Jaylen Brown out for the series?
God bless Jaylen Brown.  He is a good man who will make our city a better place.
Jaylen Brown is everything Kyrie thinks he is intelligence wise
Jaylen Brown is one of those people that makes me proud to be a Cal grad
Losing to a Celtics team without Jaylen Brown with your starting C getting sonned by Tristan Thompson...
Jaylen Brown always seems to know the right thing to say. Great dude
Jaylen Brown is a very smart young man.
I am willing to credit the institution for Jaylen Brown and ignore DeSean Jackson.
"*Brown took a masters-level class in Berkeley's Cultural Studies of Sport in Education program during his first semester in college.[14] He also gained some fluency in Spanish, stating a goal of learning three more languages by the age of 25.*   From Wikipedia. I think you may be right, though. Reading through his bio, it seems Jaylen is just a smart guy who WENT to Cal rather than a guy who's smart BECASUE of Cal. He's gonna be a great guy to follow for years because basketball is just a chapter in what will look to be a life of (sounds grandiose but srsly) greatness. I love JB."
"Jaylen Brown is nowhere to be seen in this series, bruh. Bust confirmed. /s"
"Jaylen Brown gave a well-reasoned, nuanced, and great take on racism and how we should address it and process it  which means naturally 100% he's going to attract all sorts of haters from both sides on this because the loud folks are emboldened by Twitter to say all sorts of dumb things"
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are busts?
It's been an incredibly frustrating week as a Celtics fan and I've been really conflicted about cheering for this team going forward but I will always be a Jaylen Brown fan
"He did manage to have a Hall of Fame career, to be fair! ^^^Jaylen ^^^Brown ^^^being ^^^smart ^^^is ^^^good"
"""In my 26 years with the Boston Celtics I have never heard of Jaylen Brown"""
Thad young Jaylen Brown Dillion Brooks
I‚Äôm not downplaying kyries response and I don‚Äôt think jaylen brown is downplaying his response. In all seriousness what about what jaylen said was so bad in your opinion? Jaylen addressed the fan interactions.
"My head is going to explode because we BEEN saying this.  Over the last 2.5 days, I've seen seen so many Celtics fans on this sub say something similar &amp; get downvoted simply because of the flair or they were ""deflecting"".  Jaylen Brown says it &amp; everyone on this sub has fucking amnesia"
Anytime I hear Jaylen Brown talk I‚Äôm proud he‚Äôs a Celtic.
Jaylen ‚Äújaylen brown‚Äù brown. I wish he was playing tonight.
"I disagree with the ""it being centered around a playoff game"" thing. But Jaylen Brown is a smart dude and this sub relishes any opportunity to hate on Kyrie, so we know how this will go.  Kyrie has done a lot of social justice activism. The dude is the most outspoken player in the league. He doesn't need to use a playoff game to start that dialogue. He was asked a question and gave a honest answer. It's not like he gave randomly came out and said I hope the crowd isn't racist.   Kyrie's comments seem to have to do much less with it being a playoff game than the simple fact that this is his first game back in Boston with a decent sized crowd. Also, as we've seen this week, playoff intensity brings out the worst in fans. Incidents similar to Russ and Trae ones don't happen at the same rate in the regular season as the postseason."
Jaylen Brown is always money on these kind of topics.
If you don't love Jaylen Brown then we can't be friends.
No Jaylen Brown and also Brooklyn lol
CJ for Jaylen Brown

"Because the Celtics have made waves in the playoffs in non-bubble years as well, so imo they get a little more slack from fans in general than the heat. Also, they have missed the most amount of games due to COVID this year, Jaylen Brown is hurt, Kemba is a shadow of his former self, Hayward left, after 1-8 on the roster the players are not NBA quality, and every single starter has had a big injury/sickness that disrupted their season (Tatum -covid, JB - knee/wrist, smart - calf, kemba - knee, timelord - hip/foot)  To put it in perspective, if the Mavs had Luka get COVID mid season, THJ with a mid season calf strain, Porzingis unable to play more than 25 mins a night consistently, DFS out for the playoffs, they‚Äôd struggle too.  On top of that Brad‚Äôs coaching has been a step down (not saying he should be fired or anything, still love him) and the East in general has gotten much much better at the top. Tough season, let‚Äôs just move on to next year"
"simply wouldnt call jaylen brown or kemba walker top 15 lol, well about the clippers, theyre.... the clippers"
"Because every player not named Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Kemba Walker were injured in those games."
"In games that Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Kemba Walker all played the Celtics went 17-16.   The injuries definitely took a toll and losing the 50 games Hayward played for them last year hurt too, but they definitely underperformed even when close to healthy."
&gt; Yes they don‚Äôt have Jaylen Brown and some of their rotation players from last season  You answered your own question.
"Tl;dr: No I‚Äôm not. I think this years performance was expected given fatigue, injuries, and covid - the first two I assumed would be a problem before the season started. People expected the Celtics to be way better because they assumed certain things about the team‚Äôs health that didn‚Äôt end up happening.  Kemba/Smart/the Jays have played less minutes together the entire regular season than they did in the bubble last year. Our ideal lineup in Kemba/Smart/Jaylen/Jayson/Rob Will has started only 7 games together. We went 6-1 with our only loss being against Philly and we beat teams like the Bucks and blew out teams like the Nuggets.  Only three guys have played at least 60 games: Pritchard has the most with 66 then Tatum with 64 and Grant Williams with 63. Every other team with a rookie leading the team in games played is in the lottery.   In this scenario, especially given that we are a top heavy team, you get things like Mo Wagner as a starting center, Jaylen Brown playing out of position as the starting point guard, or starting our two way player at point guard with our rookie point guard coming off the bench.  Atlanta, despite the many injuries, had John Collins, Trae Young, Clint Capela, Kevin Huerter, and Solomon Hill all play over 60 games. The Knicks had RJ and Randle play 72 and 71 games respectively plus all of Bullock, Noel, Quickley, Payton, and Obi play at least 60. Miami‚Äôs probably had the closest situation to us but their rookie was at least fourth in games played as they had Robinson play all 72 games and Bam, Iggy, and Precious play at least 60. Bucks had Lopez and Forbes play 70 games and Pat, Middleton, Donte, Portis, and Giannis all play over 60.  There‚Äôs actually a ton more reasons I‚Äôm very optimistic about our future after having lower expectations than most this year but this is already way too long. I‚Äôm happy to share if you‚Äôre interested though."
Tatum May never win an MVP tbh. Jaylen Brown will take votes plus Luka gets stronger every year and eventually Zion will start making the playoffs. Oh also AD is still around and so are a lot of other players who are better.
"&gt;Jayson Tatum ... people were saying he should have had Rookie of the Year    He was on the very fringes of that discussion. It was all Mitchell vs Simmons.   &gt; but his first two seasons weren't even great compared to other players in his class.    He scored the second most playoff points in NBA history for a rookie and almost lead a team to the finals in his age 19 season, but you don't understand the hype?    &gt; I think Jayson Tatum is a great basketball player ... Jayson Tatum is one of the players that are the future of the NBA he will be around for a long time ... He is a smooth handled, 2 way guard, that has a slow pace at times and quick one at other times. He can shoot, drive, rebound, and defend. He is as talented as players come in the NBA, and he is coming off a fantastic season    It sounds like you think that he is worth the hype. Did I mention that he dropped 50 a few times this year?   (And Im ignoring that you called him a guard)   &gt; but my secondary issue with the love that surrounds him is the amount people ignore other talent with similar age and play style. Brandon Ingram and Jaylen Brown    What is this logic? Is there only so much love to go around?   Your issue with Tatum is the Ingram and Brown don't get enough credit? What does that have to do with Tatum getting his rightful credit?   &gt; nobody showers these two with the same kind of love.    Didn't Brandon Ingram win MIP last season and then plateau this season?   And Jaylen gets a ton of credit for his improvements."
"Not if he doesn‚Äôt win a title. There will be plenty of guys getting gaudy stats like Luka. If one of those guys also gets rings while doing it, they will pass Luka.    Kobe is a good example of where you‚Äôre drafted completely dictates your path. Yes Kobe was also great but if you swap his draft situation with Tmac it‚Äôs a different ball game   Guys i could see surpassing Luka as player of the decade if they luck into the right setting:   -Tatum (Luka may never have a sidekick better then Jaylen brown)  -Lamelo,   -Trae Young   -Jokic (in 2 years if both LA teams are out the way, Jokic could have the best team in the west and 2 all star sidekicks in Murray and MPJ). Simile to how Kobe had better stats than Duncan but Duncan to many had the better career , I could see happening   -The wild card is OKC. They could have a team that‚Äôs like (ironically) the old OKC with lottery picks after lottery picks. If one of those picks is an Emoni bates or Case Cunningham , they could be just as good as Luka AND have a stacked supporting cast and start taking over the league the 2nd half of the decade   Remind me! 5 years"
"You're being pedantic, his point is that Herro is not a good playmaker which is true. As an example, ""he doesn't pass"" a common criticism of Jaylen Brown, who also has similar averages to Herro in the playmaking department."
"Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Kemba Walker are clearly their 3 best players."
"Don't be mean, celtics without jaylen brown are barely a 10 seed they don't deserve to be there."
"Kawhi, Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown were all more project guys than established scorers coming in."
Come to Toronto Jaylen! We'll give you the penthouse suite Kawhi never took and all the food you want. #Brown&amp;ChowDown or something. Bring Tatum too!
Jaylen Brown is too good a dude to have to hear this shit from his own GM. I hope he says something.
Kyrie  Marcus Smart  Jaylen Brown   Am I missing any other active players who played for the Celtics who have called their fans racists?
"Jimmy Butler, Kawhi, PG, Jaylen Brown"
"&gt;Wtf does this have to do with Boston sports?  It adds the appropriate context. Boston has the most vocal racist fans, and everybody knows it.  Kyrie throws out random jibberish, but he isn't doing that here.  When you say ""calling Danny Ainge a liar because he is white"", you are making a pathetic attempt at playing the race card, and I dismiss it with a chuckle.   LOL.  None of this has anything to do with his skin colour.  Danny Ainge is a disingenuous asshole BECAUSE he is claiming ignorance about something plainly obvious to anyone paying attention. If, by chance, he *is* naively ignorant, he needs to grow up and pay more attention to the world around him outside of sports.   But this is Danny Ainge we are talking about. A highly calculated, highly competitive and highly successful man. So, I do not believe for one second that he is naively ignorant.  I'd love to hear what Jaylen Brown has to say about these comments from Danny."
"imagine how smart, jaylen brown, etc feel seeing this"
imagine how jaylen brown feels
imagine being jaylen brown and seeing this comment
"Russ is one of my favorite guards all time. Consistently a top 10-15 player in the league throughout his career. This season though, putting him right at 25 is generous. Here‚Äôs the 24 players I have before him, and I can‚Äôt see there being an argument he outplayed any of them this year:  Joker embiid curry Durant  harden Giannis Chris Paul Devin Booker Ja morant  Kyrie Irving  Dame Ben Simmons  Rudy gobert Donovan Mitchell  Trey Young  Luka Kawhi  LeBron Anthony Davis Jayson Tatum Sabonis  Bradley Beal PG-13 Khris Middleton   That would put him at 25. I think a case could be made that Jimmy Butler or Bam would be more deserving of this spot. Also you‚Äôd have to put Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray higher if they weren‚Äôt injured."
I would say that‚Äôs a mix of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown getting better and Brad Stevens finding defined roles for everyone. I‚Äôd say the reason they were worse with Kyrie was Brad Stevens failing to find defined roles for everyone and not being able to get the team on the same page.
it's crazy that a guy can average 24ppg but still only be the 7th leading scorer by PPG in his own division. All the guys OP mentioned plus Jaylen Brown averaged more points per game.
Jaylen Brown deserves a few more votes
"Plus your losing a really good defender. If I were to trade Simmons I‚Äôd try and target Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, or player of similar caliber def someone not over 28"
I kinda missed that Jaylen Brown was an All-Star.
"I think given his age and talent, he'll get more than that. More like a Jaylen Brown deal, 4 years 107 mil"
"Hey Brad, what‚Äôs the price for Jaylen Brown?"
"Booker: was not heavily featured in the Kentucky offense, questions around his lack of length making him too much of a liability on defense. People otherwise loved his shooting ability.  Mitchell: No fucking idea. He looked like a stud at Louisville.  LaVine: raw at UCLA, beautiful shooting motion, but outside of spot up shooting and his athleticism, really didn‚Äôt look ready at all at the time.  Murray: he *was* a top prospect though. He was in the conversation for top 3, top 5. Jaylen Brown was the only real surprise selection ahead of him (was considered a bit of a disappointment at Cal, but was seen as a high-upside raw talent), but Murray was highly touted out of Kentucky. Season was somewhat overshadowed by Hield looking like Steph Curry at Oklahoma."
I would take jaylen brown easily over simmons  He‚Äôs a much better scorer plays pretty good defense and is improving every year. Only thing simmons has on him is playmaking
"I‚Äôm taking Jaylen Brown and never looking back, then MPJ"
10/10   Jaylen Brown everytime  He‚Äôs so goood
Jaylen Brown vs Ben Simmons is not even a debate at this point
"If your superstar wants out, who is realistic young player you can get? Jaylen Brown, Micheal Porter?"
"Got a good one and it‚Äôs my own team. The Celtics in 2018 when Hayward and Kyrie were both out (#1 and #2 at the time). Terry Rozier (3rd year), Jaylen Brown (2nd year), Jayson Tatum (rook) and a bunch of role players beat the Sixers, Bucks and were minutes away from making the finals against LeBron, who was still completely unstoppable. Tatum dunked in LeBrons grill and then chest bumped him after. The 2018 playoff Celtics were really an awesome team that I believe would‚Äôve given the warriors a run for their money had they gotten through LeBron."
Last time I went to a game was Celtics-Jazz in Utah. Jaylen Brown couldn‚Äôt hit shit from 3 in warm-ups yet barely missed a shot in game and then Enes Kanter was stroking it from the free throw line with a perfect spin that would bounce right back to him every. Single. Time.
"What? The celtics wouldn't do that lol, Jaylen Brown is one of the consistent playoff performers who is a two way scorer. Oh wait, he also has one of the cheapest contracts in the NBA. Heat would do it in a heartbeat."
yeah how do y'all feel about Jaylen Brown and four firsts
Sounds about right. Russ been a bum in the playoffs for the past 3 years but I‚Äôd still take him above some of those in his tier and maybe I don‚Äôt watch the Celtics enough but Jaylen Brown does not seem like he should be that high
Jaylen Brown? Lol
They have no assets to get Jaylen Brown.
Mavs should go for jaylen brown. That duo would win the west
"I can see it now.                    ""Before anyone accuses me of sexism, I happen to like Becky Hammond as a person, and what I'm about to say has nothing to do with her gender. In fact, I have a mother and sister myself and I'm quite fond of females in general.        However, does anyone else feel like she just doesn't have what it takes to lead a locker room of men at the professional level? I mean come on, there's no way guys like Tatum and Jaylen can respect her in the huddle, given she's never played in an NBA game before and -- let's be honest -- only got this job because of Popovich promoting 'equal candidates' and the new wave of Woke Culture. Once again, she seems fine as a person or as a team trainer or doctor or something, but I'd rather have an old-school X's and O's coach who just *gets* basketball, like George Karl, or Larry Brown.""                *Thread: 12 upvotes, 859 replies*"
"It‚Äôs not about the loss. It‚Äôs about *how* they lost. The got humiliated in game two even without Harden. The Celtics put up a bigger fight without Jaylen Brown. That shouldn‚Äôt happen.   I‚Äôm not certain Bud should be fired, but the Bucks would have to at least think about it after the way they got blown out in game 2. Especially if they think they can get a guy like Carlisle. It reminds me of the Nick Nurse/Dwane Casey situation in Toronto."
[Jaylen Brown isn‚Äôt a star?](https://celticswire.usatoday.com/2021/03/08/nba-boston-celtics-jaylen-brown-2021-all-star/)
yeah Lukas not leaving without a star coming back in return. jaylen brown isn‚Äôt one and the Celtics aren‚Äôt going to have high lottery picks that would allow the mavs to easily get one. the mavs won‚Äôt let luka leave for a contender unless that contender has a guaranteed high lotto pick or is willing to trade their no 1 in return (basically kawhi for derozen but with more picks)
This dude hates Jaylen Brown so fucking much.  What a dumbass.
Dude it was a joke lmao satire I was trolling both side like trolling bucks fans as well as making fun of people that were acting like it was over do you not get that vibe by me saying keep Jaylen brown out
It‚Äôs easier to get Lonzo ball then a better quality wing than jaylen brown.
"Cool but over the full season Brown had a TS% of 58, Sabonis 60, Towns 61, Beal 59. Even if we use your smaller Jaylen sample size, 62 isn't ""much much better"" than 61.    Those other players also offer things Jaylen doesn't. Beal is a better scorer and is Tatum's best friend. Towns is a better rebounder, adds size, and adds incredible spacing from the 5. Sabonis is a better playmaker, rebounder, adds spacing from the 5, and is more multi-faceted."
"Brown was the second option and is **levels** better on defense than everyone you named (while being younger than Towns and Beal). He also is making significantly less than everyone in your comment.  When playing as the first option (no Jayson Tatum) Brown averaged 30.5, 3.4, and 6.4 on 50/40/82. Without Jayson Jaylen had a true shooting percentage of 62% which is also much much better than everyone in your list."
"I also don't think Jaylen is traded. BUT if he was I'd say his value is roughly the same as:   Bradley Beal. Ben Simmons. Karl Anthony Towns. Sabonis. Ingram.    Add picks + players to either side. Again totally hypothetical, assuming any of those players would ever want out, Boston would want to trade Brown, and any of those players would be a good fit."
"He's bordering on untradeable, and the list of guys you would trade him for is a very short one and generally lends itself to other guys that teams won't trade either.  Ergo, he's never getting traded.  &gt;  but I think the Jay duo is not a championship winning team. They are good enough to play extremely well together but it‚Äôs obvious that Jaylen plays better without Tatum. Tatum is the better player so I think Jaylen is the one to go.  This is the dumbest thing I've read on r/nba in a while.  The two play terrific together.  Yes Jaylen gets more shots with Tatum is not playing, but that's how literally every team in the NBA works when the lead scorer is absent - somebody needs to step up and fill the missing volume.  Jaylen just put up a 25/6/4 on excellent efficiency while playing all but a couple of games next to Tatum this year.    &gt; I think he‚Äôs worth a Paul George package  31 year old Paul George who has an absurdly expensive extension coming up is not worth 24 year old Jaylen Brown on a relatively cheap deal.    Besides, Jaylen has made a significant step forward every single season in this league.  He does it again next year and he's probably a better player than George.  Boston keeps the Jays together until they both hit their primes in 2 years and then they finally go all in."
I like Paul George especially this play off run but he ain‚Äôt worth Jaylen brown .A perfect package would be jaylen&amp;Walker plus a pick or 2  for Damian
"Giannis, Jaylen Brown, John Collins"
Jaylen Brown can take over a game and win. He‚Äôs trollin
"This is a peak reactionary r/nba take. There‚Äôs a reason Jae crowder makes 7 million a year, and teams would line up to hand jaylen brown a max right now. Unless you‚Äôre trolling you really don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about."
One day he might even be as good as Jaylen Brown.
"Crowder is unironically better than Jaylen Brown. At least Crowder knows his role and doesn't do things he can't do, and he plays solid defense. Brown is terrible, I truly wish we have Crowder instead of Brown right now. He'd be a much better #2 option next to Tatum."
I wish we had Devin Booker instead of Jaylen Brown. Booker is so much better.
"Tobias is significantly better than Jaylen Brown. Honestly, I don't know what Boston can do to overtake Philadelphia. Tatum is good, but one man is nothing against a star trio of Simmons/Embiid/Tobias. Jaylen is terrible and is overpaid."
Jaylen Brown I think
"Among the top 10ish players major injuries are way up. If you compare 2020 star injuries vs 2021 for example, in 2020 we had Kd, Klay, Steph, Embid, and Simmons as the main guys with injuries. In 2021 we had Kd, Klay, Harden, Lebron, Embid, Davis, Murray, and Butler injuries. Perhaps Kyrie now too.  Way more top level players missing a lot of games this year than usual. Then if you go down a level you have guys like Jaylen Brown, CJ McCollum, and Jaren Jackson Jr. missing a ton of games too which really hurt their respective teams."
So let me get this straight   Kemba Jaylen brown get hurt  ‚Äúinjuries are part of game‚Äù   Anthony Davis gets hurt  ‚Äústreet clothes‚Äù ‚ÄúAnthony Day-to-day-vis‚Äù   Kyrie and James harden get hurt ‚Äúinjuries ruined us‚Äù ‚Äúdoesnt count‚Äù   With all due respect nets fans are delusional.
she needs Jaylen Brown
"LeBron, AD, Harden, Kyrie, Embiid, Murray, Conley, Mitchell, CP3, Jaylen Brown  Half the goddamn All Star team was hurt these playoffs"
"It's always good to be humble and not associate real world racism problems with your fucking basketball game. See, Jaylen Brown.  Kyrie is such a narcissistic bitch. That wasn't about racism, it was about his ego. Sociopathic people tend to do such things. Work everything in your favor at the expense of anyone in your way."
"That was one series. The injuries this year, caused by the 13-day offseason and super compressed schedule, have been a constant throughout the season and postseason. Let‚Äôs just look at these playoffs: LeBron, AD, Chris Paul (who is obvisohyl looking better now), Harden, Mike Conley, Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Dontae Divencenzo, Embiid, Kyrie, Hunter+Reddish. Basically every team had a very significant injury or two.  Yeah, everyone is usually banged up by this time but this has been different. Half the stars in the playoffs were either out or not even close to their real selves."
"With young players it makes sense. Like some people felt Jaylen Brown may never be an All Star due to his handles being bad even 2 years ago. Now it's a relative strength. He isn't Kyrie in that department,  but he is good which has unlocked his play a lot.  I think Doncic can improve. He may never be a sharpshooter st the line, but he can be good enough."
and why jaylen brown got and deserved (later learned) the max
I thought this was a weird joke but from your post history you legitimately hate Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown. Worst player in all of Boston sports right now and is being paid $20M+. Negative defense and can't score without teams double-teaming Tatum or Kemba.
Jaylen Brown isn‚Äôt winning you a chip either.
Jaylen Brown is by far their second best player and didn't play at all in the playoffs. I give them a pass for that alone.  Miami on the other hand...
"Yup, his midrange still abysmal. Way worse than CJ or Jaylen Brown. If he can shooting that at their level, he'll be elite on offense even without post up. But his defense is that we badly need. If he stay, i dont know if we play him as center or as PF again on defense"
Jamal Murray and Jaylen brown too
"Yeah Beasley. They traded him so they didn‚Äôt have to pay him.  He would‚Äôve been a nice player to have this off-season considering the injuries.  Honestly with Mpjs emergence, I don‚Äôt know how much better the nuggets actually are with Jamal. They revert back to constant pick and roll negating mpjs effectiveness.  They need to trade 1 of them and upgrade at point or at SG. Jaylen brown, Beal, and lonzo should all be targets for them this off-season, and then hire some better 3 point shooters.  Jokic and Malone deserve a ton of praise for remaining competitive with what they‚Äôre putting out there against a really great team"
Jaylen Brown ~~and it isn‚Äôt close~~
"Jaylen Brown has been better for the Celtics, this postseason, than Kemba Walker"
Stfu u literally exist only to shit on Jaylen Brown get a fucking life. U constantly talk about how Jaylen wouldn't be able to do well without Tatum / Kemba meanwhile MPJ wouldn't be able to create a shot for himself with a gun to his head
"Why? MPJ is already better than Jaylen Brown currently right now. Nuggets have a stud, just gotta be patient."
"oh yes and I really haven't complained on how Celtics would be a top 2 seed in East if it weren't for Jaylen Brown and Kemba's injuries. I suppose two things Lakers are better at than us, signing free agents and making excuses."
DeAndre Jordan and Jaylen Brown are the realest dudes in the NBA. And honorable mention Jeremy Lin and Steve Kerr.
"&gt;Jaylen  *Checks 2016 draft list*  ...I could've sworn Tatum went 2016 and Brown went 2017. I've been calling Tatum ""one of the best players from 2016"" this whole time :/"
"I think Simmons is a great player but more and more I‚Äôm starting to feel like come playoff time having a guy with no flaws is more useful than a guy with big strengths and weaknesses. For example, prime Kemba is a great scorer but gets abused on defense, Jaylen brown is a less polished scorer but his ability to defend makes him much more valuable. Not exactly saying that Jaylen &gt; Ben but as a Sixers fan you have to admit Ben‚Äôs glaring weaknesses can sometimes dull his amazing defense and transition basketball. At the very least Brown is much easier to put pieces next to than Simmons, so for a rebuilding franchise that might be ideal"
"you're about to be downvoted into oblivion for suggesting Ben (3x all-star, 1x all-nba, 2x all-defense, 2nd place DPOY) is not hot garbage and 1x All-Star Jaylen ""GOAT"" Brown is not 3 times as good as him."
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown will not lead the Celtics to a ring.
Jackie MacMullen specifically called out what I mentioned on Ryen Russillo podcast where they discussed the future of the Celtics after Ainge stepped down last week. there were also a few incidents including this one when they were both in Boston https://boston.cbslocal.com/2019/01/11/marcus-morris-jaylen-brown-celtics-bench-altercation-shove-miami-heat-nba/
Why do we even need to offer Timelord in this scenario? Jaylen Brown is the most valuable thing in these trade proposals by far (besides maybe Bam). I'd reckon he's more valuable than some of these entire packages by himself.
Did Jaylen Brown do anything? Why is he not on the list?   &amp;#x200B;  I think Harden did something in Houston as well I forgot what it was
"Jaylen Brown should be on that list, tbh"
Where‚Äôs Jaylen Brownüò¢
Surprised Jaylen Brown isn‚Äôt up for it with how much he did in KY after Brianna Taylor
Jaylen Brown. Muhammad Ali.

"Fox, simmons, zion, ingram jaylen brown what bout injured player murray and klay? I am very confident if there was league draft rudy would not go in the first round ..thats 32 teams."
"There's so many young young superstars its crazy. Trae,  Mitchell, Tatum, Luka, Ja, even Shai, as well as Booker, Porter Jr, Jaylen Brown, Ingram, and Zion. Pretty insane"
"You don't have to stan only good players lmao. Some of my favorites have been fringe all-stars or bench guys. Tony Wroten, Michael Redd, Tyreke Evans, now Jaylen Brown. Only great player is LeBron because I'm from Cleveland."
Robert Williams vs. Jaylen Brown who‚Äôs better?
I mean what's the point tho lol. It would be like when Jaylen Brown did it for one game and dominated but probably even more so.
"  I have respect for almost all great athletes, but in terms of personal heroes, I only have a few. My all time personal hero is Bill Russell. I have read all of his books, watched everyone old highlight reel of his out there and am a deep believer in what he stands for. A more modern personal hero of my in recent years has been Jaylen Brown. Another guy up there for me is Big Papi. Xander Bogearts, and Al Horford probably round out the top 5 of my personal heroes. I like Phil Mickelson, but he is more of the Tom Brady kinda of guy I like. Mostly the on field/course personality. I wouldn‚Äôt go as far to say I enjoy all of their off course/field beliefs and issues. Whether that is political alignment, or Phil Mickelson‚Äôs insider trading scandal."
"Pelicans are prob another good option, they have a lot of assets and could use a more scoring centric pg.  with Jaylen Brown and Jason Tatum as primary scorers for boston, Pelicans would include Lonzo for sure and then offload a few other players + some first rounders to get Kemba.  Kemba/Ingram/Zion could be a playoff capable combination and I think Zo would fill a solid Rondo type role for Boston.  could be mutually beneficial"
"&gt; The national basketball team for Yugoslavia if it still existed would be nuts and could 100% take down Team USA.  I think 100% beating Team USA is hyperbolic unless they're playing the same 2019 roster, in this hypothetical scenario, which included: Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Mason Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum, Myles Turner, Kemba Walker, Derrick White.  That being said, a Yugoslavian team would wreck shop."
"Jaylen Brown averaged 30.4 points, 6.4 rebounds and 3.7 assists in 7 games without Jayson Tatum this season. He did so on 50.6% from the field, 39.7% from three and 82.9% from the free throw line. #1 Option JB is really good."
"The gap between the team the US put out two years ago and its best team is massive. If the US actually sent their best players, you're looking at something like:  Steph curry, LeBron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, Draymond Green, and DeAndre Ayton.   The team that they actually sent was:  Marcus smart, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Harrison Barnes, Derrick white, Mason plumlee, Khris Middleton, Kemba walker, Joe Harris, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and Donovan Mitchell."
I'm glad because non-stop negative sports radio sucks. When Jaylen Brown got season-ending surgery this year one of the shows was trying to decide if he actually needed it then or if he used it as a way to get out of a bad season for the team.
"Jamal Murray  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons  Brandon Ingram  Domantas Sabonis  Pascal Siakim  Jaylen brown and Ben Simmons are extremely close imo. Although Ben is an elite defender, Jaylen can create his own shot and defend really good as well. Which is why I give him the edge"
Are you looking at career stats for Simmons vs Brown? Because Jaylen has a higher ts than Simmons this year. Not drastically higher but still more efficient despite Jaylen averaging over ten points more a game (his career high vs Simmons‚Äô career low in ppg).  I can understand preferring Simmons for playmaking/defensive reasons and can agree to disagree on ballhandling but it doesn‚Äôt make sense to compare career stats since Jaylen‚Äôs been improving every year and his rookie year averages of 6.6 ppg on 53.9% ts are an extreme outlier.
"There are pretty much always 2-3 guys that are better long term than Simmons in any given draft.  Last draft: Zion, Ja, possibly RJ or Garland.  Draft before: luka and Trae.  Before that: Tatum, dmitch, Bam.  Even his draft year, which was pretty weak, you have jaylen brown as being better.  Rolling the dice on someone better than Simmons isn‚Äôt a losing bet."
"Jaylen Brown, love his game and I love how he is off the court"
"1. Ben Simmons - biggest difference maker in the draft. Compare his stats with Brown and you'll see that despite not shooting threes and being bad at free throws Ben has higher efg% and ts%. Better in every other element of the game too. Top 3 defender in the league behind Kawhi and Gobert. Great playmaker. Handles. Unselfish. It's ridiculous to me that this could be the minority opinion. Yeah, the team around him has to fit, but guess what? Every other team in the Association is learning they need to be able to go four out too. He'd have a ring by now if the Sixers hadn't gone with Colangelo. You build around a player like this.   2. Jaylen Brown - Also really damn good. Obviously things went rotten in Boston but this guy is like the textbook example of what you want your second best player to be, and if he was in a feature role in his own team built around him his game could blossom like Harden's did. That's not too say he could be as good as Harden, but I do think he does everything so well he'd really thrive.  3. Jamal Murray - basing this on where he was pre-injury, but when he's going he's unstoppable. Also a great teammate.  4. Domantas Sabonis - Needs a good coach and a team with a plan, hopefully that's Indiana. I'm worried he's going to look a lot worse without Turner (on offense!) because I don't think the Pacers consistently were able to consistently trot out 5 competent players at the same time last year. Dude is more fluid and creative than he gets credit for. I don't think he's that bad of a defender, either, just not a rim protector, but people act like he's Enes Kanter. He was the only thing holding Indiana together at times.  5. Pascal Siakam - Toronto was set up to fail this year obviously so I don't hold this season against him. He got a bit exposed though and looks like he's more Trevor Ariza than Kobe Bryant. He's a good second option but a great third option.  6. Brandon Ingram - I'm not an Ingram believer at all. Career 14.7 PER.  Not a great Rebound%. It's Zion's team and BI will probably be the guy they flip to get him help. When I hear about how good he is it's like NO fans have something to sell, like it's a long con to pump up his trade value. For some reason I think he'll end up in Sacramento as part of a package that nets Zion a running mate like Fox."
He averaged 33 points per game when Tatum wasn‚Äôt playing and averaged 25 points on 60% true shooting last year.   To be honest I could care less about who you think a ‚Äútrue allstar‚Äù is. Fact of the matter is Jaylen Brown is quite literally a Star.
Damn this is actually pretty close between all these guys 5 years into their careers. They‚Äôre all  great in their own different ways so it‚Äôs tough to perfectly list them. I‚Äôd probably say something like:  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons   Jamal Murray  Pascal Siakam  Brandon Ingram  Domantas Sabonis   I‚Äôm mainly basing this off who I would want in the playoffs.
I‚Äôm loving the Jaylen Brown love
"Jaylen Brown - best 2 way  Jamal Murray - best offensively  Ben Simmons - best defensively   Brandon Ingram - solid 2way wing, still want more  Pascal Siakam - will need to prove he's up to his pre-ASB 2020 self to jump ahead  Domantas Sabonis - Worst defensively, very talented, but not sure if it drives winning"
1) Jamal Murray  2) Jaylen Brown  3) Ben Simmons  4) Pascal Siakam  5) Domantas Sabonis  5) Brandon Ingram

Jaylen Brown: I‚Äôm a biased Celtics fan  Jamal Murray: established second star on an elite team  Brandon Ingram: already a second star to a rising Zion but has shown consistent improvement  Pascal Siakam: championship winning 3rd option that would be a beautiful fit on the Celtics according to this biased Celtics fan  Ben Simmons: above Sabonis because he is elite at everything except shooting  Sabonis: below Simmons because as good as he is on offense he can‚Äôt defend well enough to be a primary big

"Also Harden, AD, CP (kinda), Embiid, Jaylen Brown, Serge Ibaka, and so many other players. Whoever makes the finals with at least one star will automatically win."
You forgot about Jaylen Brown but yeah tons of injuries
"Celtics - no Jaylen Brown at all, missed Kemba for a few games, lost Tatum for half a game with an eye poke."
"Your bench is missing Chris Paul, Jaylen Brown, Donovan Mitchell, Booker, Embiid, Divincenzo, Dinwiddie, Beal, and Conley.  Thats like 2 fucking all star teams. Theyd probably have salary cap issues though."
Anthony Davis  James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Kawhi Leonard  Donovan Mitchell  Joel Embiid  Mike Conley  Jaylen Brown  Chris Paul  ---  No Trae or Jamal Murray
"This list isn't even complete! Add Chris Paul, Doncic, Ball, Hayward (play in game counts!) and Jaylen Brown to the mix. This season was cursed."
Jaylen Brown too
"Genuinely didn't know how much he did, surprised to not see it go to someone like Jaylen Brown or Kyrie. Cheers to Melo tho, glad this is being recognized"
"Jaylen Brown, Lebron, Mitchell, and Cam Payne should be there too."
Jaylen Brown and Malcom Brogdon robbed
Jaylen brown
Jaylen Brown. He's a better leader.
Jaylen Brown*
Jaylen Brown
"I would say Jaylen Brown has the 4 years of playoff experience as well and has been amazing in the playoffs while still being efficient so the only thing that Ingram is better at is playmaking. Other than that, JB u could is better at every thing else even as a shooter."
"Jaylen Brown, if u see his stats and play then u will see that he has gotten better every year and he is also a pretty great defender. He didn't have consistent shot or a handle coming into the league, but he developed it and has become one of the best scorers so give me JB."
That guy with the Celtics flair that hates Jaylen Brown:  &gt;It's showtime.
Jaylen brown
"I said it after Tatum's rookie season but I still think that when all is said and done, Jaylen Brown will have a better career than Tatum."
Him and Jaylen Brown had a strong bromance going on in the bubble. I am not implying anything else.
"Not total turnover but after the 16-17 season, the Celtics got rid of everyone but Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Al Horford, and Jaylen Brown. Smart and Rozier were also the only guys left from the 15-16 team."
I was gonna say Jaylen Brown but god damn Curry for 8.5m? They must have frontloaded his contract huh
Donovan is amazing. He and Jaylen Brown are the type of players who have my respect. So many stars out there only concerned about image and followers on IG.
"&gt; Important to remember that he's still really young.  He's a few months older than Jaylen Brown, who has noticeably improved a part of his game every offseason.  Even if we don't do a 1 to 1 comparison, he's 24 (25 in less than a month) and has been in the league 5 years. He is not a ""young player"" anymore, he's a guy at the start of his prime. Being young is not a valid excuse for not improving a single aspect of his game since entering the league at this point."
If they trade Murray and picks they don't need to add Porter.  Nobody is beating Murray and picks but Boston with Jaylen Brown.
Jaylen Brown not being on a rookie max is wild. Had he waited and bet on himself he‚Äôd get max offers from a few teams this offseason
Marcus Smart and Jaylen Brown are both up there.
"Tatum and Brown are absolutely not redundant. In fact, they're both the type of player that every team in the NBA wants more of - switchable wings with credible defense that can shoot well from multiple locations and score at multiple levels. To really unlock their play with each other they both could stand to be better passers (especially Jaylen) and they could both play more off-ball. But those are improvements that they can both make - as opposed to the alternative of replacing the player wholesale because they're 'redundant'.   Like the comparison from the other response - Kawhi and PG - do you consider that combination 'redundant'?"
"that president fucked it all up.    nixed a trade of Okafor for the future Jaylen Brown pick.  Then placed his son in charge who immediately traded Jerami Grant for Ersan among other wasted assets.  Then, after burnergate brought in Philly Vlade who then turned in so many assets into Max Tobi and Seth Curry"
"I don't think the Celtics would do that trade, but the best way to convince Jayson Tatum to stay with the Boston Celtics beyond his current contract is to win a championship. I think it's much more likely than Celtic fans want to admit that Tatum will leave if they don't win a chip or at least make the Finals by the time his second contract is up.   And the best way to win a championship is by having great players, preferably, generally, 2 of the best 10-15 in the league. Celtics would have that in Dame and Tatum, and unlike Tatum/Brown, there is no redundancy or skill overlap, Dame/Tatum complement each other as a guard/wing do.   All 3 of Kawhi/PG, Tatum/Brown, and Dame/CJ have some diminishing returns to them as duos. All 3 of the Robins (PG, Jaylen, CJ) are better off when you force them into a more prominent role and ask them to do more, and they can kind of disappear and become inconsistent if they aren't in a featured role, even if they aren't good enough for it."
"Murray is 24. Jokic is 26. MPJ is 23. Don't rush em for no reason. They have time, aka not win now.  Tatum is 23. Jaylen Brown is 24. Not win now."
"I love Jaylen Brown very very much, but you significantly increase your chances of winning a championship in the next 2-3 years by trading for Damian Lillard.  Dame, Smart, Tatum, Horford, with a couple vet additions could absolutely be like this year's Suns and maybe win it all."
I agree with the handle. That'll be the key to opening up his game fully. The creativity off the bounce is what took Jaylen Brown to the next level.
"Odom, Wallace and Capela are just entirely different players.   Wallace was a 6'7 wing. Odom a 6'10 point pf. Capela a rim running centre.   Wallace would matchup with players similar to Kawhi, Jimmy Butler or Jaylen Brown types."
"I mean there‚Äôs a lot that goes into defence. Rotations, on-ball, off-ball, etc. And he‚Äôs just not a smart defender who gets exposed in a lot of ways.  He‚Äôs certainly not a ‚Äúgreat‚Äù defender unless you think there are 100+ ‚Äúgreat‚Äù defenders.  OG Anunoby is a great defender. Jaylen Brown is great. Jrue Holiday is great. Ayton is great. Wiggins is just good."
"It‚Äôs been fun I‚Äôm just saying it would be cool to see these playoffs with everyone healthy.  Specifically: Kawhi, AD, Harden, Jamal Murray, Kyrie, Joel, Donavan, Mike Conley, and Jaylen Brown.  You‚Äôre taking this too seriously lol. It‚Äôs not that deep my man"
Jaylen Brown is such a cool guy
Jaylen Brown
Its actually so Utah can get Jaylen Brown.
"Chick I know in Boston met him when the Celtics were doing an outreach program at her daughter's elementary. Next thing I see is her with near court side tickets to Celtics games the following month. Asked her about it and she wasn't shy, been fucking Jaylen Brown ever since that day."
It‚Äôs been ridiculous  Every player who missed time off the top of my head:  Davis/James Murray Kawhi/Ibaka Embiid/Green Trae/Hunter/Bogdonovic Paul Harden/Irving Mitchell/Conley Jaylen Brown  Anyone else?
Two guys who are massively overrated  Jk I believe in Jaylen Brown
Is there anyone on actual left in the NBA? Like someone who doesn‚Äôt affirm establishment liberalism? I know Justin Jackson is in the NFL and he is pretty outspoken about radical politics and I actually love Jaylen Brown but I‚Äôm curious if there are any leftists. Seems like most the NBA is the Obama/Biden/Kamala brand of politics
Start the Jaylen brown to the bulls rumors
"KAT to Celtics, Jaylen Brown to Philly, Simmons to Wolves"
"As an honest Jaylen Brown fan I must admit that he deserves to be traded for Norman Powell. If we must, we should throw in a pick as well. Not only that but Jaylen is worthless and his 40 point games are all flukes. If Tatum and Jaylen are stars, why aren‚Äôt the Celtics winn- oh shit they are- the Celtics are only winning because of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown is doing nothing. The Green Teamers will disagree but you know it‚Äôs true, Jaylen is not a good player. Remember, all this is coming from an honest fan. Me, u/devic3."

Jaylen Brown. The king of empty stats.
Just like people gave up on Randle before he got to the knicks. This sub would trade Simmons for John Wall and a second round pick and wouldn't trade Cam Payne for Jaylen Brown. It's ridiculous.
"Dude, makes as much as Draymond and Jaylen Brown. Maybe they can trade him in that final year, he's still over 20M next season."
"Lonzo almost certainly wouldn't be involved because he's a RFA. It's possible, but complicated.   The real question is if BI goes or not.   If BI stays, a starting lineup of Dame, Lonzo, BI, Zion and Adams or Jaxson Hayes will put up record breaking offense and the only question will be defense and depth.   They can use Bledsoe and remaining picks to grab defense and depth though, targeting guys like Hield, Barnes, Duncan Robinson, Norman Powell, OG Anunoby and maybe PJ Tucker.  Regardless of whl they get to fill out the roster, that's definitely a top 3 seed if healthy.   If BI goes, that'll likely leave the Pelicans with 5ish tradable 1st round picks along with 5ish swaps and at least one promising young player. Basically what the Clippers gave up for PG.   They could use those to go for the 3rd star, along with salary from Bledsoe or Adams to go after a guy like Jeremi Grant, Jaylen Brown, Siakam, Sabonis, Donovan Mitchell, PG, SGA or KAT, depending on who becomes available."
Jaylen Brown now
"I would love Dame here but I don‚Äôt think we can get him without giving up Jaylen, and the idea is to bring in a 3rd star, but not sure we will have the cap space/assets if we bring in Lillard, especially going forward when he‚Äôs making $50M in a few years  If you‚Äôre telling me in 2 years if I want a team of Tatum + Lillard vs. Tatum, Brown and let‚Äôs say Bradley Beal, I think the second option makes more sense even if Lillard is better than both Brown and Beal. I think we‚Äôre trying to keep both Jays and bring in a third guy to contend.  I think the Knicks are a potential landing spot since they have a lot of good young talent and the cap space to take on his massive contract. We‚Äôre capped and our young guys just aren‚Äôt as good of an offer to a team that‚Äôs rebuilding (some mix of Barrett, Quickley, Robinson, Toppin vs. Pritchard, Nesmith, Time Lord, Langford)"
"You *can't* use players that won titles? You're kinda fucking us here but let's give it a go:  PG: Kyrie Irving  SG: Jaylen Brown  SF: Jayson Tatum  PF: Antoine Walker  C: Bob McAdoo?  Reggie Lewis vs Jaylen Brown was tough for me, but we never really got to see Reggie's prime. I also *wanted* to put IT here, especially considering how Kyrie's Celtics tenure went, but I can't really argue that IT was the better player. We only had Bob McAdoo for 20 games, but he was still pretty damn good that year, so fuck it, it counts. He's better than Ed Macauley."
"TLDR: Basically the finals streak is when Lebron became Lebron and zoomed past other all timers to #2 on the all time list and some even think #1 (lol). This is when the ""he can drag anyone to the finals"" type arguments started.  But I wonder when this actually happened b/c in almost all of his series wins, he usually had a teammate or two who was better than the other teams best player.  So when you analyze his supporting casts compared to the teams he faced, I think you can make the case that there are a lot of other all timers who would've had a similar runs (10 finals, 4 titles) if they played Lebron's career out.   KD, Kobe, Shaq, Duncan, Bird, Magic etc.  They would likely make all of those finals except 2007 and win 4 (2011 Dallas swaps with 2016 GSW so still 4).  KD is early teens all-time on most lists.  But I think he would have 4 titles and 9 finals appearances if you swap him with Lebron.  So really the 2007 Detroit Series and the 2016 GSW series is the difference between Lebron being at the top/ in the discussion with those other guys 2-12 or whatever all time and just being automatically, unanimously put ahead of them at #2 without any thought at all.     A huge piece of Lebron's legacy is the finals streak.  You always hear ""Lebron dragged worse teams to the finals"" or ""lebron could drag any team to the finals"" etc etc.   But most of the finals runs, his team was way better than anyone he beat along the way.  It just worked out for him that when his team wasn't what you would expect to be talented enough to make the finals (2017 and 2018), they basically didn't face anyone.  Exception being 2007 when they beat 1 good team in Detroit.  Which is very impressive, but its also 1 series in 10 finals appearances.   IT got hurt in 2017 and Boston's leading scorers were Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder and Lebron had Kyrie and Love lmao.  Then Kyrie got hurt in 2018 and Boston's leading scorers were 20 year old Jaylen Brown (not close to what he is now) and rookie 19 year old Tatum.  And Kyrie was hurt, but Cleveland still had Love.  Forget teams, who are the best players Lebron had to go thru to get to the finals?  Everyone knows stars win playoff series.   Most of the stars he beat were either really young (D Rose 22, PG 22,23) or really old (Celtics Big 3 was 35).   Its just a bunch of borderline ""stars"" like Derozen, Lowrey, Al Horford, Paul Milsap, David West, Luol Deng. I'm sure I'm missing some, but its a pretty weak cast.  Basically, how many series has Lebron ever won where his supporting cast was actually worse than the other team's best players supporting cast?  2, maybe 3?  To compare, KD went nuts, but Brooklyn lost because he had to face a 2x MVP with 2 other all- stars.  Luka went nuts and they lost b/c he played a 2x champ and top 3 guy in the league in Kawhi plus prime PG and a good supporting cast (compared to 22 year old PG with David West, Hibbert, Lance etc but Lebron had Wade and Bosh).   Trae went nuts and beat Philly.  Embiid is way better than anyone Lebron ever beat in the East. and Philly is better than almost all the teams he ever beat.   Joker went nuts, but ran into a team who had 3 guys who are better than his 2nd best guy.  Dame went nuts, but he faced the league MVP.  This is all just this year.  The point is, a lot of stars have had great playoff series and lost, so nobody gives them credit or remembers them for ""dragging a less talented roster"" b/c they ran into great players/ teams.  Lebron just lucked out that when his team was sub-par, the competition was bad.  And when he won, his team was significantly more talented.  How many playoff series has Lebron ever won since he went to miami where his teammate wasn't the best player in the series (other than him)?  A lot of times he had the 2 best players.  Miami he had the 2 best guys in every series other than Chicago with Rose.  15 and 16 with Cleveland every series until the finals he had the 2 best guys in most of those series (prime love is better than Derozen, Horford etc).  Lakers nobody yet (AD best non bron player).   So 2007 Detroit is like the only series Lebron won en route to the finals where his teammate wasn't the best player other than him in the series.  And most of those he had the 2 best guys too."
Have you considered jaylen brown?
"I more meant that it‚Äôs unreasonable to expect that we can get Dame without giving up RJ. If Portland wants young talent, they‚Äôre gonna demand all of our best young talent bc we don‚Äôt have one young all-star like Jaylen brown, Ben Simmons or Brandon Ingram to offer"
"Seriously going through comments to talk more trash over people saying Jaylen Brown isnt good enough for all NBA yet and this is the one you choose?  Well done buddy,  well done."
What tf do the Wolves have to do w Jaylen Brown being All-NBA
Celtics   PG Kyrie Irving  SG Jaylen Brown   SF Jayson Tatum   PF Antoine Walker  C Al Horford

Ah yes bench All-Star Jaylen Brown? Man you are the worst troll ever.
Dillon Brooks blew by Jaylen Brown for a clutch shot that beat Boston.
I agree Id love to have some Jaylen Brown
"Which is it? Those trades or your other ideas ""I would trade Jaylen Brown for a 2nd round pick"" &amp; ""I would trade Jaylen + 3FRP FOR Ben Simmons"" both from the genius mind of devic"
I think the best time to trade Jaylen Brown will be when he's Lillard's age.
"He's untouchable from an asset standpoint even more than being a 24 year old All-Star 25 PPG scoring wing. We are not in a great cap situation even after the Kemba trade, we have SOME flexibility, but losing Jaylen at 25 Mil and replacing him with Lillard means that one of Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, or Grant Williams is now a starter, and there isn't really a ton we can do about it. If we don't re-sign Fournier  and we also trade JB, our wing depth (which is already not good) is totally fucked. I realize I'm comparing a bunch of pieces to a top 10 player, but I think losing JB would make it incredibly hard to put an actually dangerous team around Lillard and Tatum.   I doubt the Celtics are in on that if it requires Brown, and I don't think we can put together anything good enough without him. r/bostonceltics is OBSESSED with the Beal/Tatum St. Louis connection, but the same thing applies there as well. Just doesn't seem realistic."
"The best time to trade Jaylen Brown was a year ago when James Harden was available.  The second best time to trade Jaylen Brown is today, for Damian Lillard."
"Luka or Zion? For MPJ?    MPJ wouldn‚Äôt even be able to return Jaylen Brown straight up. Every GM would laugh in your face if you tried asking for any of Tatum, Mitchell, Booker, or Simmons straight up.     MPJ is ‚Äúlights out,‚Äù but the dude isn‚Äôt a good shot creator and is not a playmaker. He‚Äôs also horrendous on defense. His injury history is also a huge concern."
"The guy is puts up better stats than Jaylen Brown and has a positive impact on his team despite being what, three years younger? Perennial All-Star is easy."
"Klay, Jaylen Brown, Kawhi."
Jaylen brown even said he watches the women's game for ideas for his own game.
"And Jamal Murray, and Jaylen brown"
Yes and even more. Dont forget Jaylen Brown was an all star
Man I REALLY don't want to watch Jaylen Brown go but thats the only way we get in the conversation for real. Would be cool to win it with drafted guys.
"I don't doubt Celtics could make a package around Jaylen Brown for Dame, and would be better in the immediate future,  but Dame's gonna be a shell of his prime in less than 4 seasons where Brown has the potential to be an All Star for a good while."
"Likely suitors are Philly and Denver imo.   Denver could offer Murray, MPJ + picks   Philly can offer Simmons, Thybulle, maxey + picks   Maybe the Celtics offer Jaylen Brown as well. Who knows what they want to do with the management change over there."
my statement was hes overrated as fuck on reddit so obviously I‚Äôm gonna use reddit posts and comment to show that people on reddit overrate the fuck out of him   I didn‚Äôt say people were saying that OG is  better than jaylen brown ... I said people were saying OG is on jaylen level... Which they were .. u/kobmug_v2 was adamant about it     Also didn‚Äôt say og wasn‚Äôt on ben Simmons level ... I said that saying OG is a better basketball player than Ben Simmons is ridiculous ...which it is lmao were talkin 3x allstar  2x first team defense  1x all nba 1x DPOY runner up and y‚Äôall really wanna tell me that og is now a better player because he averaged 15 ppg and shot the 3 ball at a good clip on a team where he was like the 4th or 5th option that didn‚Äôt even sniff the play ins lmao
I mean Simmons is honestly the best young player you can legitimately expect outside of Ingram and maybe maybe maybe Jaylen Brown. Young guys of that caliber almost never get traded.
"Trading someone like Dame is tough because trading for him is clearly a win now move, but there are so few young players in the league that are both good enough to be a starting point for a Dame trade, but also not so good that swapping them for Dame wouldn't result in a serious contender.   Its a really short list: Jaylen Brown, Ben Simmons (depends how highly the blazers value him tbh), Bam Adebayo, and past that I'm struggling the think of anyone"
"If Blazers trade Dame, they go full rebuild. There‚Äôs no need for a player like Jaylen Brown."
"Celtics need to add more for sure, but if Lillard demands out, I think Jaylen Brown is the caliber of young player that a team would need to build a trade around."
"If he's available, seems like malpractice to not even try for him. It gives me pains to consider because I'm a massive Jaylen Brown Stan. I do genuinely wonder if Stevens has the balls to try that though because we'd have no shot at him with just a non Jaylen included, Smart/Williams/Nesmith and picks kind of package."
Elton brand didn‚Äôt give up anything nearly as good as Jaylen Brown
When are Celtics fans going to snap back to reality and realise that they'll likely need to trade Jaylen Brown if they want a (super)star? Putting him off limits is bizarre.
"This stupid sub overrates youth and potential so fuckin much it's actually hilarious. Dame is a top 10 player, who's under contract for like 4 more years. Does Jaylen Brown regularly carry his team, singlehandedly sometimes?   ""He's been to conference finals 3 times"" you say this like he carried them there üòÇ"
Jaylen Brown and picks?
He just missed the entire playoffs to a torn ligament in his wrist. He has knee issues that held him out of games the last couple seasons. What am I missing? Jaylen Brown gets injured more  than Damian Lillard.
Jaylen brown doesn‚Äôt have injury issues lol
"Sure, that's a risk I'll take. Jaylen Brown gets injured all the time anyway. If Lillard is worse than Brown in 2022 then it's because of some freak injury."
Jaylen brown may not ever be as good as damian Lillard is right now but damian Lillard might not be as good as Jaylen brown in 2022. Small guards fall off fast.
If Ainge didn't trade Brown for Harden then he's a dipshit or he knew that Harden would just opt out as soon as possible or whatever. Also he's gone and Zarren/Stevens are in charge now. Jaylen Brown will never be as good as  Damian Lillard and Lillard has no opt-outs until 2024-25.
I believe we have the best package to offer‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think boston would offer jaylen Brown and I‚Äôm 99% sure that Denver wouldn‚Äôt trade Jamal/MPJ
"You would have to build a package around a prime young asset like Edwards, Simmons, or Jaylen Brown. I'm not sure exactly what the market value would look like, as some teams may rate the younger players higher."
He‚Äôd be off the table for me as well.  I‚Äôm not trading jaylen brown for an undersized 31 year old point guard.  The best offer for dame would probably be a Ben Simmons package from philly? Ben Simmons is not in the same tier as brown. Don‚Äôt pay 2 times as much as another team for the same player.
"Yes if you can get the Blazers to accept an offer of Timelord, Nesmith, all the picks etc you should do that instead. But that's a fantasy world. In reality what it will actually take is Jaylen Brown and if the goal is to really actually try to win a title the only player who should be off limits for Dame is Jayson Tatum."
"The problem is Dame and Tatum might not be enough to beat the Nets, or the super team that follows, and there isn‚Äôt really a way to add a third star unless they‚Äôre already in Boston like Jaylen.   I actually do think I‚Äôd still do it or at least think long and hard about it because Dame has 4 years on his contract and at least one of those is bound to be a year like this one where things are pretty wide open, but I can definitely see the argument for standing pat. Those 4 years can quickly become a bad thing for a point guard on the wrong side of 30 while keeping Tatum and Brown together makes the Celtics a destination team once stars around their age start looking to move."
"If you search ""hardwood houdini curry"" on google and click the link under Top Stories, you can still get it.  Here's the text   ``` Boston Celtics: How recent moves point to Cs signing Stephen Curry  After a quiet draft, the Boston Celtics had one of their most active offseason days in a long time, acquiring Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, Bruno Fernando, and a second-round pick for Tristan Thompson and their remaining Gordon Hayward Traded Player Exception.  The two deals signaled two things ‚Äî Brad intends to keep the Boston Celtics competitive with a good defense but is also looking towards next summer when the Cs can create a max slot if they move some money around.  Bradley Beal looks likely to be staying another year with the Washington Wizards despite them trading his co-star, Russell Westbrook, and the team headed towards a struggle to make the play-in.  One could logically assume Beal is out of his mind to waste another year of his career confined in Washington D.C., but some things on the outside are controlling his decision-making.  Jayson Tatum, a long-time friend of Beal‚Äôs, must have convinced him to stay during his days of contemplating putting in a trade request.  Boston was not going to trade Jaylen Brown for Bradley Beal, so the two St. Louis natives needed to work out a way to play together while not requiring the front office to give up its young star.  The 28-year-old scoring superstar has a player option in the summer of 2022, which he will likely opt-out of to enter free agency as the Wizards embrace a rebuild.  The market for Beal will be a competitive one, but the Boston Celtics have stacked the deck to their favor with just one card: Jayson Tatum.  The two‚Äôs friendship has been well-documented, and their dream of playing together has been well known. Next summer, they can make their dream come true, and all of Boston has to do is move some money around to create a $34.1 million max slot.  That‚Äôs why Brad Stevens is taking on many expiring deals to make creating that max slot even easier.  The other target the Boston Celtics should prioritize is Stephen Curry.  The all-time great point guard and best shooter in league history looks to be on track to forgo an extension with Golden State and find a new club to support his talents.  Although the Warriors have a fantastic track record of building highly efficient and talented teams, their management has struggled to put a team like that around Steph Curry since the departure of Kevin Durant.  Part of this struggle can be placed on bad luck, like Klay Thompson‚Äôs injury scaring away potential free agents, but for the most part, Golden State has failed to be aggressive and make moves to win now.  Their draft speaks to that, utilizing both of their lottery picks instead of trading them for some experienced help and using their highest pick on the biggest project in the draft, Jonathan Kaminga.  There‚Äôs still time for the Warriors to make moves in free agency and trade for some veteran support, but nothing Golden State has done in the past year indicates they‚Äôll do that, which could lead to Curry leaving and the franchise having to embrace a rebuild.  The Boston Celtics are arguably the best suitor in the league for Steph Curry.  They have two young but postseason experienced stars with a solid defense in place and a front office that‚Äôs intent on winning soon.  Steph Curry‚Äôs fit next to the Jays should not have to be explained, but to give you a quick idea of what he‚Äôll provide, the Boston Celtics will have the best spacing possibly in league history.  They‚Äôll have the best offense in league with a top 10 defense, which will directly equate to high-level playoff success.  If the Boston Celtics have any chance at Stephen Curry next summer, they need to take a swing.  ```"
People said this about Jaylen Brown.
"The year is 2034, Jayson Tatum has retired. Brad Stevens is rolling out a starting five of Isaiah Thomas, Avery Bradley, Jaylen Brown, Jae Crowder, and Al Horford"
"Man's traded Tatum, Jaylen brown, and sexton for a geriatric ward"
"We were pretty damn healthy in the most important game of our season in Game 6 2020 ECF when Marcus Smart decided it was a good idea to chuck up 22 shots, more than Kemba Walker and Jaylen Brown.   He is a terrible decision maker, especially when it matters the most, no doubt about it."
"&gt;Third team all nba to arguably not even third best player on your own team  Yep, injuries suck. Doesn't mean Boston didn't sign a top 15 player in the league despite muh mistreated Isaiah screeches.   &gt;You missed out on AD and KD  Oh wow, one year rental of AD who only wanted to re-sign in LA, that would have been great. Who needs Jaylen Brown anyways. KD considered Boston in '16 (even if you consider that a ""miss""), not '19. In '19, he was going home.   &gt;Kemba proved even as a top 15 all nba third team player to not make a difference  Unfortunately, yes. Great player, awful injury history. Would have loved for him to be the third star, but alas. At least he got the bag."
No Jaylen Brown!? I‚Äôm disgusted
"Ziaire Williams over Jaylen Brown, Bam, Jalen Suggs, Ingram, RJ, Chet and Kyrie?"
"Ah ok lol that makes way more sense  I was thinking ""where the fuck was this guy lurking where people thought a one legged Kemba and Jaylen brown-less Celtics was expected to beat the nets"""
"Ziaire Williams over Jaylen Brown, Bam, Jalen Suggs, Ingram, RJ and Kyrie?"
"Couple of others saying the same thing, and that's just using my phone on the toilet.   https://www.clnsmedia.com/podcasts/danny-ainge-says-isaiah-thomas-receive-second-opinion-injured-hip-jaylen-brown-vs-houston-rockets/  Man said during a radio call so can imagine why there isn't a WSJ Editorial about it. Also not even that controversial, this isn't 1950s and these players have their own medical consultants, especially for something  that seemed to affect IT for so long. There weren't any disputes about it at the time - the team and the player seemed to be on the same page, and it just happened to not work out for him.   Compare that to Kawhi's situ, when there was a clear disagreement between Spurs/non-Spurs medics."
"What free agents, let's see? AD who said he would only re-sign with LA? Kawhi? Any other big fish that was actually available?   Perhaps we should have just given away Jaylen Brown and others for a one year rental of these guys (or Harden). That would have surely been a smart move approved by all the esteemed reddit GMs."
Hawks getting Jaylen Brown and a 1st
Fox for Jaylen Brown?
Damn that's a fucking complete highlight. I think his ceiling is on the level of Jaylen Brown.
no gm would ever bet on jaylen brown being out for the season with a freak injury
Lol I remember there was a joke years ago about Jaylen Brown being flat top Jeff Green and Jayson Tatum being light skin Rudy Gay
They weren‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs not complicated.   Okafor was chosen to trade after putting up big numbers as a rookie.  Just like MCW.     Hinkie had him traded to Boston for what became the Jaylen Brown pick.   New advisor to the team Jerry Colangelo wanted to swing his wrinkled Dick around his new team and squashed it.      The three bigs weren‚Äôt supposed to play together.
"&gt;I think the Js are Celtic true no matter what.    It's clear that Boston's ownership certainly thinks that. I don't know why it would be any different with them than it is with every other star player though. Eventually these guys want to win more than they want to just stay with the same team their whole career.   People always talk about how the clock is ticking with the Mavs and Luka or the Pelicans and Zion, but let me tell you what: the clock is ticking in Boston too, and it's ticking on *two* players. If either one of them wants out, the then the other one will probably be sure to follow.   Jaylen Brown will be a free agent in three years. In two years, when he has one left on his contract, that's about the time when players either commit with an extension or ask for a trade, so realistically Boston has two years to make their pitch to him. Cause if Brown asks for a trade, or worse, just leaves in free agency, then it's going to be *very* tough to get Tatum to recommit a year later."
"Lol and what teams did the Nets beat this year? The 7th seeded, Jaylen Brown-less Boston Celtics?"

If you keep predicting everyone to the Lakers you‚Äôre getting it right eventually lmao  [Joel Turner] Sources indicate Jamal Murray and Jaylen Brown could team up in LA down the line  Let‚Äôs see if I‚Äôm eight years from now
Jaylen Brown please (pipe dream I know)
"Reminds me of Jaylen Brown and Buddy Heild. They were drafted 5 years ago and are going into year 6. Jaylen Brown is 24, which is the same age Heild was as a rookie."
"Look, you can say that all of those guys got overpaid all day long, but it doesn't change the fact that the Celtics have gotten progressively worse as they keep losing these players to other teams willing to pay them. You lose Kyrie, Horford and Hayward to free agency, then this summer you lose Kemba and replace him with Horford, who's not very good anymore, and who also will probably be gone again in a year. Now you're also losing Fournier, and what happens if Marcus Smart also wants a big contract? Do you just let him walk too? What about Robert Williams? What if someone makes him a giant offer next summer?   At some point you have to start retaining some of these guys, even if it's expensive to do so. If you don't and the Celtics spend the next couple years like they did this year, what makes you think Jaylen Brown is going to feel comfortable with the direction of the team and their commitment to building a winner? For whatever reason, Boston fans seem to think that the same thing that's happened to so many other teams can't happen to them, and that Tatum and Brown will be Celtics for their whole career. All you have to do is look around at how many star players have asked out or bailed in free agency just because they didn't like the situation. Don't get too comfortable, those guys could bolt too."
LeBron. AD. Kawhi. PG. Giannis. Booker. KD. Curry. Harden. Embiid. Jokic. Doncic. Tatum. Brown. Mitchell. Trae. Dame. Beal. Bam. Jaylen. Ja. Zion. Butler. Irving. Randle. CP3. Even KAT. I take any of those guys over Siakam any day of the week.
"Here'e the list of players who made 22.5-27.5 million this year (25 million give or take 10%)  Al Horford 27 million  Jaylen Brown 26.7 million  Draymond Green 24 million  Nikola Vucecic 24 million  Buddy Hield 22.7 million  Well, he ain't the worst among them if he was paid 25 mill"
Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown
"Yeah I think Williams is my favorite to become a true star other then the two guys I mentioned previously. The way he moves and shoots really reminds me of Kawhi, and they have very very similar rookie year numbers. Different situations obviously but I can see him reaching that ceiling, or maybe like a bigger Jaylen Brown possibly"
Celtics notable draft pick over the last 5 years;  - Jayson Tatum - Jaylen Brown - Robert Williams - Aaron Nesmith - Payton Pritchard  - Romeo Langford - Grant Williams - Semi Ojeleye  - yeah it falls off pretty hard now
Have you considered jaylen brown?
"I'm genuinely curious what ""win now"" trades Andy Liu and others are talking about when they complain about Meyers refusing to trade Wiseman, Wiggins, Kuminga and Moody.  I'd love to trade them for Dame, Beal, PG, Jaylen Brown or some other superstar and I'm sure Meyers would love to also... The problem is, those teams/players aren't available at the moment and it takes two parties to conduct a trade.  Wiggins, Wiseman, 7 &amp; 14th for Siakam?  Seem too high a price for perhaps a marginal upgrade.  Maybe Wiggins, Kuminga, Moody and Paschal for Harrison Barnes and Hield?  Not sure if Kings would do this without more from the warriors, but I think it does improve the warriors, just not sure how much."
Giving some love for Ja scorer/ Jaylen brown defender
Damn‚Ä¶ dude was supposed to be Jaylen Brown-like coming out of Duke. Been a rough few seasons for him due to injuries. Wonder if he‚Äôs got it in him to bounce back.   Lakers could give him a look as a high IQ. High effort guy who can D up well and make the right plays without needing too big a role on offense (because he‚Äôs atrocious right now trying to score)
"Those guys don't fit here. That's the bigger issue: the players that MIGHT be available aren't great fits.  Now if Jaylen Brown or SGA become available, go for it.  But I like Lacob's approach. It's how a 10-year run potentially turns into a 20 year run."
I believe this also. Is Fox for Jaylen Brown a good trade for both teams?
"Shai doesn't see the types of coverage that Tatum does no offense. Whenever teams play the OKC Thunder, they're not working as hard to watch film and stuff because they know that you guys aren't trying to win any games anyway Lol no offense.  To say that hes a better scorer than year 3 Tatum is just not true Lmfao. You can see in the raptors series 2020 specifically how well Tatum handled basically every type of coverage a player could see. Nick Nurse through everything at him that he possibly could, but Tatum was still playing as well as anyone possibly could. Shai crumbled in the one playoffs series where he saw any kind of double coverage against Houston.  Shai also played less games. If he played a full season, his averages wouldn't be as high. He had a few really good games (i know specifically because I really like watching him a lot as a player).  Shai is great but hes not in the same league as Tatum (but not far off). There is no young player in this league who has the arsenal of offensive weapons that Tatum does.   I would say Shai is more like Dbook which is still an amazing compliment because Dbook is a fantastic player in his own right. Tatum, Luka, and Zion are in a league of their own followed by the other young players like Shai, Dbook, Dmitch, Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, and obviously more."
He‚Äôs actually closer to Jayson Tatum because this is his 3rd year and he put up about the same numbers as Tatum did in his 3rd year except Shai was more efficient.   Jaylen Brown 3rd year of production isn‚Äôt close to Shai.
"He‚Äôs closer to Jaylen Brown than Jayson Tatum. That‚Äôs not an issue, you guys just need to find the top-10 player."
"They easily are so much better.    Curry/Harden/PG/Lebron/AD with CP3/Kyrie/Butler/Zion/Turner off the bench and add Trae and Jaylen Brown.  Theres like 6 great playmakers with Curry, Harden, Lebron, CP3, Butler, and Trae. You have a stretch 5 that can protect the rim at all times. an elite wing defender on the floor at all times. 4 elite shooters in Curry/Harden/Pg/Kyrie. Just an overall smarter and more experienced team as well."
Tatum overrated. Jaylen Brown better
Again I'm asking you. Why would he be asking you about who Boston picked with the Nets pick if you were criticizing the Nets. I know our pick was used for Jaylen Brown. He's asking about who the Nets picked in the 2016 draft.
Bro are you alright?   The Nets pick was used to draft Jaylen Brown   Just like the timberwolves pick was used to draft Johnathen Kuminga   Boston‚Äôs pick was Ante Zizic
The Nets 2016 pick was literally used to draft Jaylen Brown???
"The guy I replied to said name the Nets Draft Pick   The Nets draft picks in 2016 got Boston Jaylen Brown and the Pelicans Diallo that‚Äôs just facts   They traded for the contract rights of LeVert a solid player, and Marcus Paige a no name   And it would‚Äôve been totally reasonable in 2016 when the Nets draft LeVert to say RIP LeVert‚Äôs career Brooklyn is where careers go to die like the asshole at the top of the chain did"
"Kris Dunn, Buddy Hield, Jaylen Brown... Whata Chriss and Bender up to?"
It's true. Jason Tatum and Jaylen Brown materializing into better players than the ex-Lakers Lonzo and Ingram is what counts for a win for them these days.
Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown gives Siakam nightmares. Single-handedly derailed Siakam‚Äôs game.
"I absolutely LOVE watching good defense, and OG was already my favorite Raptors player to watch. (the team can go suck on a Habanero pepper though...)   Reminds me of a raw-er Jaylen Brown."
"Scottie Barnes will be in the league for 5 years tops.  I actually have no idea but so far the mold of players with his scouting profile (long and athletic with a bad shot) have often not worked out.  Everyone thinks they‚Äôre getting Jaylen Brown/Kawhi Leonard, but just as often you get Stanley Johnson/Josh Jackson"
"what fuck up, drafting Jaylen Brown?"
Steph  Klay  Kawhi  KD  Anthony Davis   Chris Paul Kyle Lowry  Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Bam   Zion  Booker
If raps saw Scottie shoot well in their workout and think he can get better than it was the right pick. I remember Jaylen Brown had similar shooting splits to Scottie in college. Boston worked him out and he shot really well in their workout so they picked him at 3 and everyone said it was a bad pick
"&gt;I‚Äôd imagine the warriors can get a minimum 2 border line Allstars or 1 borderline superstar/ top tier alll star.  Who?  I mean seriously. Last year's all star teams included al to of ""borderline all-stars"" because of the number of players who dropped out. Here are the rosters:  Beal, Irving, Giannis, KD, Emiid, Jaylen Brown, Harden, Lavine, Simmons, Randle, Sabonis, Tatum, Vucevic, Curry, Doncic, LeBron, Kawhi, Jozic, Booker, Conley, Lillard, Mitchell, CP3, AD, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert.   Which of those players is available?   Maybe Lavine, if you make a godfather offer?  Does Lavine turn these Warriors into title contenders? Maybe Vucevic? Maybe Conley.   That's probably it.   Which of those deals get you excited? I mean, you're talking two borderline all-stars, so if the Warriors can get Lavine and Vuce ... okay, that's interesting. Does it strike you as somethign that might actually happen?"
"Boston was close in 2016  They had 8 total picks, 2 in the top 20 (3 - Jaylen Brown, 16 - Yabusele), and pick 23 (Zizic)  Brown was obviously a good pick but out of the other 7 I believe Nader is the only one that is still in the NBA"
Jaylen Brown trajectory?
Jaylen Brown is vegan I believe. Or at least vegetarian
I say the Celtics not only are him and lebron gonna face off a lot but him and a developing jaylen brown and Isaiah Thomas but it‚Äôs interesting on where jayson tatum will be drafted
"Maybe but he has a higher BPM than Tatum and Brown.  Let me just give you the list of players with over 900 minutes (Rob has a thousand):  Jokic  Giannis  Curry  Butler  LeBron  Embiid  KD  Harden  Doncic  Kawhi  **Timelord**  Lillard  Zion  Kyrie  Vucevic  Bam  CP3  AD  Gobert  Conley  KAT  Sabonis  That‚Äôs the list up to 28 (Tatum is 33, Jaylen is 55). If that isn‚Äôt All NBA level BPM for Timelord I don‚Äôt know what is. We were like &gt; .750 when he started games and around .480 when he didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs says enough."
"I can make a list of point guards better than him and then add on other guys as well from other positions and he's clearly in the 30 to 40 range as a player.  Off the top of my head.  CP3 Steph Dame Trae Young Jrue Holiday Ja Morant Kyrie Irving are all point guards better than Russ.  You can argue Ben Simmons (I won't) but that's the range where Russ is.  And then we have players who are better like Beal, Bam, Butler, PG 13, Middleton, Booker, Tatum, Lavine, Jaylen Brown, Gobert, KAT.  And then you add Harden Lebron Jokic AD Giannis Luka Kawhi Donovan Mitchell so yeah he's in the thirties clearly."
"Well i wouldn't call 3 championships and 5 finals appearances with the best record in NBA history a blip but yeah it could be the difference between a regular dynasty and an all time one. But yeah I agree, those are pretty much the only guys I'd consider trading the farm for. Tatum too and mayyyybe Jaylen Brown. And yeah a sign and trade with Oubre could be the best option for us to get even better this off-season. Wiggins should be kept, he's a quality quality piece. Consistent 15-25 points with great defense and no ego. That's super useful for a contender so i don't want to get rid of him unless it's for one of the aforementioned guys."
"Yeah this the part no one seems to understand. If like, Paul George or Kawhi, maybe even Jaylen Brown, was available then yeah bye bye to all the young guys on the team. But Beal and Lillard? Nah, they're redundant. Siakam? Tbh Wiseman and/or Kuminga can probably be as good as him within a couple years and he won't push us over the edge this year anyways"
"Just be happy you guys have rational and competent management. If Gilbert and Friends...um, I mean Altman ran the Celtics, I have the utmost belief they would have traded Jaylen Brown for picks and kicked Tatum to the curb for absolutely nothing, just because the emperor wears no clothes. The only hope for Cleveland is one or the other James return, nothing else srs"
"Jaylen Brown isn‚Äôt a Top 2 player on almost all real championship teams, if any at all. His impact in his role is too small, even if he‚Äôs real efficient at it.  He could keep getting even better, but it‚Äôs unlikely he‚Äôll get to that point. The #2 on the top tier contenders are the likes of AD, Harden. The Bucks with Jrue/Middleton are more of an outlier.  That being said, they definitely should keep Brown. I thought they shoulda looked into tradin him for Harden and makin some other moves last year, but now no one else available is worth it"
Celtics will not trade Jaylen Brown.
As soon as he compared I think Barnes to Jaylen Brown I was done listening to him
"No luxury taxation without representation.  - Jaylen Brown, NBAPA VP"
"Wiggins because he didn't care early on (though I feel his handle was something most people overlook as his weakness and is actually a big reason why he is not aggressive).   Jaylen Brown actually overachieved  Otto Porter Jr was good enough for a massive overpay but not really good at all    Oladipo maybe? Took a while to develop (but more of a PG/SG)   Barnes could shoot better but general archetype is the same. He has had a good career despite 2016 finals.   PG was ok but a much better free throw shooter (even from the field too and he wasn't that great)    Hayward in college was much more athletic and his long range shooting was quite bad but he developed in that front.   Evan Turner looked quite good in college (more so than Kuminga now) but his skills didn't translate    I would wager in the top 10 as a whole, most wings develop pretty good success, even when raw, but there are a decent few that are at best role players. Much harder for a wing to bust completely though given their defensive advantages"
"Jaylen Brown, Josh Jackson  That‚Äôs pretty much best and worst case scenario right there ^"
Ceiling is jaylen brown
"Raw athletic wing players? Off the top of my head: Patrick Williams, Jaylen Brown, Cam Reddish, Kevin Knox."
Jaylen Brown became a star  Gerald Green was a bust (despite ending up with a great career)
"I was really pissed they didn‚Äôt trade Lonzo in the offseason.   For whatever reason it‚Äôs clear they don‚Äôt like him long term.  Surely they could have gotten something.  I was hoping for WCJ and a pic from Chicago, but hopefully they can still get something for him.    I really hope the Pelicans don‚Äôt do too much to tie up long term cap space. The Pels have the cap space and draft capital to trade for the next disgruntled star.  I really hope they dont waste it in Lowry in some short sighted approach to win now.   If they just have a goal of making the playoffs this year I‚Äôm happy.  The BI and Zion can work great together and this year should just be about seeing who fits best out of NAW, Kira, Jax, new guys around them and the make a big play for someone next offseason.   There‚Äôs always someone disgruntled who wants out surprisingly.  Jaylen Brown please?"
"Jaylen Suggs, Jaylen Brown, Jalen Johnson, Jalen Smith - all I got"
God damnit why can't Boston ever get this guy?!?! He would fit perfectly with Jaylen Brown and Jason Tatum. Add Bradley Beal into the mix next year and the team is legit scary.
tbt when celtics fans booed jaylen brown and wanted fultz over tatum
Apparently Ben Simmons is better than Jaylen Brown.
Perk said he didn‚Äôt like the Kuminga/Jaylen Brown comparison and thought Jordan Bell was a better one.
"Yea, they always say that about Jaylen Brown to be fair though.  Last year it was Tyrell Terry (‚Äúbroke the iq test!!!‚Äù)"
"Man, I hope this shuts r/bostonceltics the fuck up for at least a couple weeks. I love Beal but he's a horrible fit for the Jays and we're not giving up Jaylen Brown to do it, so it's not gonna happen. Him not wanting to leave seals it."

Jaylen Brown fans smiling
How about Jaylen Brown instead?
"No way the Celtics get him without Jaylen Brown involved I feel like, unless Wizards are that high on picks"
"&gt;The Sixers asked for Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams, former lottery picks Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith along with two future first-rounders in exchange for Ben Simmons, according to multiple sources. The Celtics quickly turned down the offer.  This will be the next report. 5....4....3....2....1"

"I made a comment in the thread earlier about it, I guess I should have like mentioned you in it or something? There was no context about non all star, and probably rightfully so, because I don‚Äôt really think a non all star could do it. Maybe someone like Hayward, but even that is pretty tough. So Hayward or Jaylen Brown were my answers."
Jaylen Brown would be the next Magnus Carlsen
Now they‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs Jaylen Brown
Maybe Jaylen Brown?
"As a Celtics fan, I was fairly confident he was going to re-sign with OKC, but thought that if he left for ANYWHERE it would be Boston.  Didn't think he'd break the NBA by going to GS, and none of his other suitors seemed primed to win-now and win for the forseeable future as the Celtics did.  KD, Horford, Crowder, Smart, IT (or maybe Kyrie), Avery Bradley, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum.  Wouldn't have automatically been title favorites but it would've been a great team that could have competed with Lebron's Cavs to go to the Finals."
"I think Beal is a better player than Jaylen. Not sure if Beal is a better fit, but i think both are great fits next to Tatum. As a Celtics fan, my concern is ""Does this trade make the Celtics an actual contender?"" My gut says no, and if that trade doesn't make us a contender, then I'd prefer not to do it. Keep the extra contract years (and lower age) of Jaylen Brown"
"Before Jaylen became a deep threat, I'd have said he was the second coming of Howard. I guess I'm going to say you'd use him like Jaylen Brown!"
"I see him being drafted as a trade piece for warriors. (I HOPE SO)  IDK why some of these dudes compare him to Jaylen Brown, this guy is more like Westbrook. Athletic with no jumpers, but watching his highlights, you can really see the future of this dude. I don't know about his lowlights though."
Of course it's a reach. It's a ceiling. The most appealing thing about Kuminga is his crazy potential though. Debating Kawhi vs Limitless Jaylen Brown is just splitting hairs.  Any team that drafts him would probably be happy if he reaches Loul Deng levels.
A much better Jaylen Brown is a top 10 player in the league. You think Kuminga's ceiling is the best player in the league or something?
"Most ceilings are realistic though, or else everyone's ceiling would just be Lebron, MJ or Wilt.    Kuminga needs to develop every aspect of his game. Brown alone is a very generous ceiling and would be an AMAZING outcome for whoever drafted him. Cyborg Jaylen or Kawhi seems like a reach."
Wouldn‚Äôt go that far. Jaylen Brown is 6‚Äô6 with a 7‚Äô wingspan who shoots 40% from deep and has WAY more well-rounded offensive skills than Seth Curry. And his perimeter D is very good.   Yet he‚Äôs certainly not an MVP.   A 45% shooting 3&amp;D guy would be absurdly valuable but not an MVP. And that‚Äôs what you‚Äôd get crossing Curry and Thybulle.
From 2020-2029?   1. Luka Doncic  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo   3. Zion Williamson  4. Emoji Bates  5. Jayson Tatum  6. Trae Young  7. Ja Morant  8. Nikola Jokic  9. Karl-Anthony Towns  10.

LaMelo Ball  21. Deandre Ayton  22. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  23. Jaylen Brown  24. Bam Adebayo  25. Jalen Green
"&gt; I'd hold out for someone that really has top 15 upside  There's really just not many players like this that would be available for trade. Part of the problem with this, and we ran into it with Harden, is that you can't trade these guys to non-contending teams. Those teams won't want a player that doesn't want to be there, these guys want to compete for a ring.   I really looked around the league for realistic players like that we could get for Harden and the only two answers I had were Ben Simmons and Jaylen Brown, and obviously we're all reconsidering Simmons now.   If Boston puts Brown + Picks on the table I think you really consider that, but I cant think of another young blue-chipper that would potentially be available on a contending team. There's some older guys that like *maybe* you could swap Dame for like Paul George or Kyrie that are borderline top 15, but that doesn't put the Trail Blazers any better off than just keeping Dame and if Portland doesn't compete they'll probably just want out themselves. The player empowerment aspect where players can kind of force themselves out regardless of contract really hurts this.  Everyone is also downplaying that if the Warriors deal includes future unprotected picks, those could be very valuable down the line. Every big player on the Warriors will be on the wrong side of 30, they are capped out, and they don't have many assets after a trade like this. If they offer up like two unprotected picks in the like 2025-2029 years, those could end up being real valuable later. I feel that way about the Brooklyn picks we got in the Harden trade. Thats assuming the Warriors agree to give that up though. If they don't give up extra future 1sts, I look elsewhere as Portland  Disclaimer that I dont actually know what all tradeable picks GS has and dont feel like looking it up"
"Blazers would never.. as long as that Celtics package of Jaylen Brown exists, IF Blazers decide to trade him, it will be to Boston."
"&gt; Where are the better deals for him this offseason? Serious question.  You're not going to find much better than a Wiseman/Ben Simmons type this season. Nobody is going to give up a prospect like SGA or Anthony Edwards, most of those teams would trade their key young guy for Dame and be in the same position: unable to contend. Everyone in this thread just hasn't thought long enough about who could realistically trade for Dame and what would make sense.  Like Jamal Murray, Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown etc. are your BEST case scenario players. Guy on their second contract making near Max or max money, on a team that has a realistic chance to compete if they trade for Dame."

"In terms of ability I have him top 10. He challenged 2018 Lebron as a rookie or sophomore taking him seven games hitting tons of clutch shots. His skill set, size, and overall game is top 10. He‚Äôs been to multiple conference finals, performed extremely well in the playoffs, his team has had some bad injury luck but he‚Äôs young and deserves time to make a finals. Everyone isn‚Äôt Magic, Bird, or Duncan. He deserves to be in that convo. He played KD to a draw in production that first round. But the Nets had Harden healthy and Kyrie. Jaylen Brown was gone they had no shot but that 50 point masterpiece was beautiful. He‚Äôs that dude! My biggest disappointment with the Sixers was letting Danny Ainge convince them not to take Tatum and they took Fultz smh. Imagine Tatum and Embiid. They no doubt beat ATL and I think they‚Äôd beat the Bucks and win the whole damn thing against any team."
"Agreed. Unless Jaylen Brown goes from all-star level to all-NBA level like JT has, Celts will be hard pressed to win the East."
"If I‚Äôm considering possible movements, regression, and injuries I have East Guards | Zach LaVine, Trae Young, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, Collin Sexton East Forwards | Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo East Replacements/Snubs | LaMelo Ball, Cade Cunningham, Domantas Sabonis, Jimmy Butler, Khris Middleton, Jaylen Brown, Caris LeVert, Julius Randle West Guards | Stephen Curry, Donovan Mitchell, Ja Morant, Damian Lillard, De‚ÄôAaron Fox, Devin Booker West Forwards | Nikola Jokic, LeBron James, Ben Simmons, Zion Williamson, Karl-Anthony Towns, Paul George West Replacements/Snubs | Chris Paul, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Michael Porter Jr,  Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Brandon Ingram, Rudy Gobert  Hopefully I‚Äôm not forgetting anyone"
Jaylen Brown just wanted to be different... close enough
Also a lot of Jalen/Jaylen‚Äôs:  Jalen Green (2021 draft)  Jaylen Brown  Jalen McDaniels  Jalen Johnson (2021 draft)  Jalen Lecque  Jalen Smith  Jalen Suggs (2021 draft)
Jaylen Brown &gt; Booker easily too
"I wasn't comparing Jaylen Brown to LeBron. When ""LeBron"" was on top, everyone can point to the ""2011 NBA finals"" or the ""2016 NBA finals"" as his ""best album"". Now that ""Jaylen Brown"" is on top, what is his ""best album"". That's what I was asking.  Obviously the metaphor doesn't work, but this was all your idea, not mine lol"
I know there‚Äôs a Jaylen Brown and Jalen Green but we need more. Someday some team can field the Power Ja[y]lens team.
"Jaylen Brown has a pretty similar style as well.  T-Mac was his favorite player, so it makes sense.  JB's mid-range fadeaway is one of the prettiest/smoothest moves to watch in the league today, like a hot knife through butter."
Jaylen Brown too even tho it‚Äôs spelled different.
Why can't Jaylen Brown just become Lebron James?   If you compare everyone to some of the greatest artists then everything is mediocre
Jaylen Brown  Jalen Green  Jalin Blue...
"Who'd win ? Jaylen Brown, Jalen Rose or Jalen Green?"
They obviously need them some Jaylen Brown.
"Donovan Mitchell, Derrick White, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Mason Plumlee, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Smart, and Joe Harris.  Not the best team we could have sent, but they definitely should have finished better than 7th."
Lillard-Brown-Tatum-KD-Draymond would have been the closing 5. Jaylen would've been an incredible glue piece
"JT is the truth, I wish Jaylen Brown could've been on this squad"
Thank you. Jaylen Brown is one of my favorite players. Pretty much all his stats have gone up very quickly while keeping his percentages very consistent. Great future for the Celtics with Brown and Tatum on the roster.
Awesome work man! Would love to see you keep building this out and get a sale to a major network for cool visualization techniques. It's cool to see how a guy like Jaylen Brown has slightly improved his free throws less by hitting them at a higher percentage and more by eliminating his 0 for games from the line.

Hey look its the jaylen brown hater troll !
young players that are about to get paid their dues get shit on constantly on this sub for years. john collins and collin sexton are the victims this year  jamal murray and jaylen brown are also recent examples
"It‚Äôs hard to even classify who plays what position anymore now. But Lavine is definitely not better than Booker, Mitchell, and Jaylen Brown."
"What? No he is not lol. James Harden, PG13, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, Booker, Beal, and SGA I would say are better. I think u can flip between Shai and Zach but Shai have made huge improvements this year but ppl barely have watched OKC. His efficiency is still high despite being on a team with no help and his playmaking has gotten better plus he is an pretty good defender."
"Sir, no. You are forgetting Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Fred VanVleet, Donovan Mitchell, Shia Gilgeous-Alexander, CJ McCollum and Terry Rozier who could arguably be better than him. Booker, Brown, Mitchell and George are all definitely better."
"He‚Äôs also not better than Julius Randle, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Westbrook, AD, Lavine, Vucevic, Kemba, McCollum, Jimmy Butler, Paul George, Kawhi, Shai Gilgeous Alexander."
Lol did you just say a healthy celtics teamüòÇwe were basically watching the celtics future minus jaylen brown this post season
"As a blazer fan I don‚Äôt like the idea if trading but if we had to I would want. Mpj and Murray and 2 1st for Dame and Nasir little and a 2nd.   Jaylen Brown, smart, moses brown, and 2 first. For dame and other filler players to make it possible  Kat and delo and 2nd for dame and roco.  Beal and 1st for dame  Dame and 1st for tatum."
"How about this, defensive RAPTOR rates Kemba Walker as a better defender than Jaylen Brown. They each started all their games, and they both even played for the same team."
Boston centered around Jaylen Brown or New Orleans centered around BI + all their picks
Jaylen Brown or Donovan Mitchell - both of whom are arguably preferable over anyone in that list.
I'd have all three over Jaylen Brown.
I know nothing about this kid but I'd bet he plays better defense than Jaylen Brown.
"In future seasons when there are a lot less injuries, the path to the Finals will be a lot more difficult. The Celtics will get Jaylen Brown back with a healthy Kemba, the Nets, who would have beat the Bucks if not for injuries, will be near impossible to stop when heathy and teams like the Knicks, Hawks and 76ers will be getting more experience and getting better.   This year is 100% their best chance to get to and win the Finals. They might not ever get this chance again. Middleton and Jrue has got to be better."
"I was hesitant to put Beal cuz he is a few years older than the other two.  Yet, the next best SG I could think of who is also young is probably Jaylen Brown"
"When you think about it; Sixers could really have had Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, alongside Embiid. And that's just the start. Mad."
Congrats and it still ended up 4-1 vs a garbage Celtics team missing Jaylen brown
"To think, we had a heated debate between drafting him and Jaylen Brown."
Jaylen brown
"‚ÄúMake their money back‚Äù is a sunk cost fallacy and perusing this with a condensed season and postseason lead to Giannis, Trae, AD, Chris Paul, Jaylen Brown, Kawhi Leanard, etc injuries"
Jaylen Brown is going to make another leap next season and make all these responses not including him look silly.    Short of injury he's about to go on a major run of all-star nods.
"West  S - Stephen Curry S - Luka Doncic S - LeBron James S - Kawhi Leonard S - Nikola Jokic B - Damian Lillard B - Devin Booker B - Paul George B - Zion Williamson B - Anthony Davis WC - Donovan Mitchell WC - Karl-Anthony Towns or Ja Morant or Chris Paul  Snubs - 2 omissions above and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Klay Thompson, and De‚ÄôAaron Fox  East  S - James Harden S - Kyrie Irving S - Kevin Durant S - Giannis Antetokounmpo S - Joel Embiid B - Trae Young B - Bradley Beal B - Jimmy Butler B - Jayson Tatum B - Bam Adebayo WC - choose 2 of Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Khris Middleton, Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis, and Pascal Siakam"
He has a point. The shortened offseason ravaged teams with injuries. Just look at the past four conference finalists. 3 out of 4 got kicked out in the first round. Heat got fucked by injuries and COVID early on and were never the same. Celtics had a season ending injury to Jaylen Brown. Lakers had debilitating injuries to both Lebron and AD.  Denver made it past the first round but they never had a chance because they lost Jamal Murray to a season ending injury.
"Is there even proof the majority of the injuries came from the schedule? Trae stepped on a refs foot, James Harden intentionally came into the season fat and out of shape, Giannis landed in a way that made his knee bend backwards, Davis is always hurt, Kawhi is always hurt plus load managed a ton and definitely got a lot of rest, Kyrie gets hurt in half of the playoff series' his teams are in, Jaylen Brown was a wrist injury that has nothing to do with resting, etc"
"How does that tweet contradict what /u/lakerswiz said about LeBron giving his opinion? And LeBron isn't a vice president of the NBAPA (his term expired 2.5 years ago). [Here's the player leadership:](https://nbpa.com/leadership)  * Chris Paul, President * Andre Iguodala, First VP * Harrison Barnes, Secretary-Treasurer * Bismack Biyombo, VP * Malcolm Brogdon, VP * Jaylen Brown, VP * Kyrie Irving, VP * CJ McCollum, VP * Garrett Temple, VP  LeBron isn't even the Lakers' rep (that's Jared Dudley, with Alex Caruso as alternate)."
"Brogdon will make 21 mil, Jaylen Brown, Vucevic and Draymond will make 24 Mil, Bam, Donovan, Fox and Tatum will make 28 mil, and Ingram will make 29 mil. If any team gives Reggie Jackson anywhere in this range, they are basically signing up for salary cap issues. He's simply not in the range of those players."
Jaylen Brown has a bigger impact &amp; a higher ceiling than Jayson Tatum.
I‚Äôd bet him and Jaylen Brown are on the same page
Jaylen brown and sabonis get 25 million a year btw.  That‚Äôs like the going rate for a 3-D athletic wing that can get you 20 a game. Or a big that can be the first option on a 6 seed.
Jaylen Brown + a decade's worth of first-round picks or swaps for Luka please.
He plays better defense than Jaylen Brown.
All three &gt;&gt;&gt; Jaylen Brown
"Not me, but I have a friend who thinks Ben Simmons and Jaylen Brown are better than Luka and Giannis.  He also thinks that Giannis should've never been in all star and the only reason he's in the league is bc he's athletic.  I avoid all basketball conversation with him for this reason. He has plenty of similar takes that give me aneurysms"
&gt; Jaylen Brown for Cam Reddish and Onyeka Okongwu and the **hawks** say no
"For the bulls I can think of 3: DeRozan, Ingram, and Jaylen Brown"
"brown is 24, improving, just averaged 25 a game, plays defense. I'll take Jaylen all day long"
"The NBA draft is practically just a huge group think draft it seems like now. It feels like GM's can just go on any of the media draft boards of the consensus to take the ""safe"" pick without worrying about any backlash from fans and media. Due to this group think nature imo is how you still get your Donovan Mitchell or Bam type of players that weren't top 10 picks that become All-Star caliber players, so how can GM's and the media both really explain missing on these players? Scouting is hard, but the actual hard decision making in the draft is actually taking someone that actually goes against the consensus imo, rather than just taking the safe pick that anybody can do. Pistons taking Cunningham would be an easy and safe decision, but if Green or Mosley end up being the better player, how can the media or GM's in general explain what went wrong? Taking Green or Mosley would take real guts to do for the Pistons, while going with Cunningham is the safe group think selection.   The top 3 media consensus barely, if ever goes according to plan outside of the 2016 draft, where Simmons, Ingram, and Jaylen Brown all went to be All-Stars. It seems like figuring out who in the consensus top 3-5 of the media boards that won't pan out pre-draft is the real scouting and hard work."
"My B.  He‚Äôs not ‚Äúyoung star‚Äù talent. The worst player id call a ‚Äúyoung star‚Äù is probably jaylen brown, and Ingram is nowhere close to him in terms of skill or athleticism.  And if he‚Äôs an all star (which he wasn‚Äôt this year), he‚Äôs probably at the bottom of the list. Only dudes who are all star that are worse than Ingram are Conley, vooch, maybe sabonis.  Cade is worth significantly more than Ingram."
Siakam is not a great fit. Siakam is alow IQ player. You people thought oubre was agood fit till he came and we saw how bad he was. Siakam is an african who probably started playing bball late. We saw how jaylen brown locked him up and he had no counters.. u cant put him in a read and react offense
"Jaylen Brown and multiple picks for Cade Cunningham, who says no?"
Jaylen Brown has been considered
"Jaylen Brown is better than Ben Simmons. Would the Celtics trade Jaylen straight up for Simmons? Probably not, even thought PG is a hole for them. But the sizers would definitely trade Simmons for Jaylen straight up.   Jaylen has improved every facet of his game every year he has been in the league.  And is a fantastic teammate. Simmons has barely improved since his rookie year.   As a Celtics fan, I don‚Äôt have to worry about Jaylen, sure he has off nights, he doesn‚Äôt have a glaring flaw that I know will be exploited by the other team and drive me crazy.   Ben is a better on defense and a passer. Jaylen is a better all around offensive player who can hit free throws and shoot 3 pointer, while playing good defense."
"I see you've considered Jaylen Brown, well done"
Definitely. Dark horse that people don‚Äôt acknowledge enough imo is definitely Jaylen Brown. Every time I watch him I‚Äôm amazed by his strength. Dudes strong as a bull.
"Well, the comment you replied to stated that they would be ok with 4/100 *instead* of a max. That's Jaylen Brown money and some would argue his contract is a steal. If Capela wasn't there he would average 10 boards and he has already averaged 22 for a season. Obviously I made a comment to piss you off, it worked."
looks like someone neglected to consider Jaylen Brown
"I understand that most nets fans started watching basketball like 2 months ago, but you need to Atleast know who‚Äôs on which roster before making team comparisons.  PG-Hill pacers didn‚Äôt have anyone at the level of jaylen brown as a secondary scorer."
"You've kind of answered your own question.   &gt;Without a superstar point guard to pair with **an elite wing (or two)**, is there any reason to think the Celtics have a higher ceiling than the George Hill/Paul George Pacers?  The Clippers have an elite offence because they have two elite wings who can initiate. As opposed to the Pacers who only had Paul George.   Just as a quick side-by-side here's the scoring hierarchy of the two George/Hill teams:  2013-14 Pacers| PPG ---|--- George| 21.7 West | 14.0 Stephenson |13.8 Bynum| 11.5 Hibbert |10.8  Hill | 10.3     2015-16 Pacers| PPG ---|--- George| 23.1 Ellis | 13.8 Hill | 12.1 Miles | 11.8 Turner | 10.3 Mahinmi | 9.3   The Pacers had a grind it out offence because they didn't have much talent offensively. It was Paul George + Role Players.    The Celtics have Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, two wings who were top 20 in the league for scoring this past season. Then you add in Fournier and Horford. A wing and a big who can both score and act as secondary facilitators.  They just have a lot more firepower than what the Pacers were ever working with."
That's because Jaylen Brown is a fuckin beast. Stops quicker guards... stops bigger forwards. Siakam still gets nightmares from that series
"Because they do all the time dumb ass.   [Eric Gordon is ""mini Lebron""?? You call him that too?](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bledser01.html)   [ Rodney Stuckey is ""Young 50""](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/stuckro01.html)    [Who the fuck calls Jaylen Brown ""Old Man""](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/brownja02.html)?  Your ignorance is cute."
Didnt Jaylen Brown question the so-called ‚ÄúCeltics culture‚Äù when Isaiah Thomas got traded? I might be remembering incorrectly
"Yeah I guess you‚Äôre right, at least for people at the talent level of the NBA draft.   Jaylen Brown is known to be super smart and he went to Berkeley and took advanced courses but only for 1 year. But he‚Äôs reportedly an autodidact who loves to study history and philosophy on his own time. I could see him continuing his academic career at some point and doing some very interesting things after the NBA."
"Jaylen Brown and Tatum didn‚Äôt do much, just Smart and Kemba lmao"
"I definitely agree that Tatum has another leap coming but I came to this thread to say Jaylen Brown. Brown just keeps improving year after year and this past season scored 24.7ppg on 48/39/76 splits. He‚Äôs a 50/40/90 player if he gets his FT% up and he‚Äôs only 24. He‚Äôs super efficient, can defend, and is as unselfish as they come. Im not sure if he takes the leap being on the same team as Tatum though as much as I hate to say it. It‚Äôs a foregone conclusion that Tatum is the guy on the C‚Äôs and I think Brown is fine being Robin but let‚Äôs say Tatum goes down for a season or Jaylen gets traded (fuck either of those things happening btw) I could see him really showing out and taking a big leap to that next level."
"he also misses badly a lot of times.. he tought taking jaylen brown over dragan bender made the celtics the losers of the draft and said phx couldve missed everything after the #4 pick and still be the winners cause they got dragan. Got JJJ over luka and ayton, while i think JJJ is a great player, having him over luka is a insane miss. Said miami won the 15 draft by getting Justise winslow..."
"Tatum, Ja, Jaylen Brown, Ben Simmons"
"‚ÄúSuper well‚Äù is an interesting way to describe passing up on Jaylen brown and jayson Tatum for Lonzo ball and Brandon Ingram. Not a correct way, but definitely an interesting way."
"In the 2019 FIBA World Cup the US had a roster that had Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner and other NBA players coached by Gregg Popovich.  They didn't even make it to the Bronze game. They absolutely would not medal in the Olympics with those players."
Jaylen Brown is better
"&gt;Jaylen Brown   I'm not sure you can replace a forward with a guard.  The east reserves were 3 guards (Harden, LaVine, Simmons), 3 forwards (Brown, Randle, Tatum), and a center (Vuc). Sabonis was an injury replacement for KD another forward.  &gt;Bum Simmons  this feels like recency bias  &gt;Beal for 3rd team  I don't think Beal was getting left off after he almost won the scoring title."
Kyrie just wants a black king for a coach. Kyrie to Boston for Jaylen Brown. Let's make Kyrie happy.
Hes got a better handle than Jaylen Brown did coming into the league and is a better defender now because JB gets lost offball so bad (maybe a hot take I'm #CamFam)
"MVP is ludicrous, he doesn't have the handle nor the vision to reach that ceiling.  He's very athletic, great size, the hope would be that he develops into a bigger Jaylen Brown but he has a long way to go."
"While I think Atlanta should probably bring Collins back, it‚Äôs pretty obvious that Jaylen Brown had more upside and is a different kind of player than collins"
iirc this sub almost had a thread for almost every Jaylen Brown game after the extension
"Well I mean it's kind of weird to think about #1 picks because almost every time, the #1 pick isn't the best in the class   2020- LaMelo #3 (so far but can change) 2019- Ja #2(only because Zions health is a huge question for his career)  2018 - Luka #3 (I don't need to explain this one) 2017 - Jayson Tatum #3 (Markelle and Zo went before him)  2016 - Jaylen Brown #3  2015 - Devin Booker #13 2014- Nikola Jokic or Embiid at #41 and #3 respectively   And this is just in the last 7 draft classes, there are plenty more examples, and for quite a few of these there is obviously still plenty of time before their career are over, but right now none of the last 7 #1 picks are the best player in their draft. That's why the #1 pick isn't really as valuable to me in general because usually even if a guy seems like a can't miss, someone else could always end up being better"
You‚Äôre jumping through hoops to find merit and explanation for something that doesn‚Äôt need it.  We are not comparing Trae young and Jaylen brown defensively. There is no conversation to have.

"Hawks fans have been hoping all year to get John on a Jaylen Brown type contract.  Probably won‚Äôt happen now, but our GM is saying that no matter what, John Collins isn‚Äôt walking for free. He will be matched, or signed and traded"
"marcus smart, evan fournier, jaylen brown, jayson tatum, and al horford."
"[Over 60 percent of games in this postseason have featured a starting lineup a team hadn‚Äôt used before. That‚Äôs the highest share in nearly 40 years](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/obqjtd/over_60_percent_of_games_in_this_postseason_have/)  10 all stars have missed at least 1 playoff game this year (AD, Harden, Kyrie, Kawhi, Jaylen Brown, Mitchell, Conley, Embiid, CP3, Giannis). [the previous NBA record was 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nzya1u/goldsberry_kyrie_irving_will_be_the_7th_different/)  Never before has basically every playoff team's best player got injured like this year. Maybe a 2 month offseason + a condensed schedule wasn't a good idea"
"How about you actually say why he‚Äôs worth matching a max contract?   Just because he was on the team during this run isn‚Äôt a good enough reason. Cause he‚Äôs been like the 3rd-5th option a lot of these games behind Trae, Gallo, Bogdan, sometimes even Heurter   He doesn‚Äôt have a handle, can‚Äôt post up, can‚Äôt create his own shot reliably, can‚Äôt create for others, can only shoot off the catch and mostly just in the corner, is not a rim protector, not elite on the perimeter for defense  Can he improve ? Yeah he‚Äôs still young but how many of these things are likely?  Jaylen Brown was a top pick with huge potential, higher than Collins. And Brown didn‚Äôt even get a max"
"The first statement is definitely wrong. Jaylen brown got a 4 year 107 mill contract, hield was 4 year 94 million. I remember people initially clowning the Celtics for paying brown more than hield when the contract details first came out."
"And like I said, there's more to it than just the regular season PPG.  * Collins does well within the flow of the offence and shows flashes of good defensive potential. When Trae went down he sort of disappeared.  * Jaylen did well within the flor of the offence and was a leading defender on a top defensive team. When Kyrie went down Jaylen became our leading scorer.    I think Collins should get paid but Brown had a lot more going for him.   Jaylen played a bigger role on a better team."
I have a few.  1. Jaylen Brown &gt;&gt;&gt; Jayson Tatum  2. Russell Westbrook &gt;&gt;&gt; Damian Lillard  3. I also think James Harden was the best player in the NBA from 2017-2019.
Jaylen Brown too
Jaylen Brown &gt; jayson taytum
Siakam &gt; Jaylen Brown  üòú
"This is a tricky question.  All the NBA players are very good at the basketball thing. A guy like Luke Garza was the player of the year in college and a late-second-round pick whose only pro potential is overseas. But, very few can be superstars in the way you described.  There's the added layer of there being a lot of ""stats guys"" on bad teams. Putting up points on the Cavs or Magic or Kings is a lot different than being a superstar. I don't even think SGA is a good example. You can't have a young player on a team that is taught that losing and franchise turnover is good and then expect them to be more than a stats guy.  So, I suppose I will go with four options:  Jamal Murray - Is very close. So close that ""Could Denver have made the Finals if Murray was healthy?"" is a fairly legit argument. Being the second-best player on a Finals team means the player in question is really, really good.  Michael Porter Jr. - Nowhere near as close as Murray and much more unlikely to reach star level. But, if ability/health/work ethic ever comes together? Watch out.  Jaylen Brown - Will he ever be the best team on a Finals contender? Not sure. I do think he can be the second-best player on a Finals teams. Before you scoff at that, the second-best player for the most-recent Finals teams were Olympians.  Cade Cunningham - Don't want to hear top draft picks? Welp, don't give a fuck. The guy has never played a second of NBA ball and I think he will be the best #1 pick since LeBron. Will be a perennial all-star and will win a title sooner than LeBron, Giannis, KD, etc. That is delusional and far-fetched for many. But, I think he's that damn good. And, like MJ during his title spree and Duncan during the Spurs stretch, he has the chance for a run of greatness where the more established stars are aging out and where younger players aren't as developed."
Jaylen Brown in 2016  https://www.masslive.com/celtics/2016/11/jaylen_brown_wears_short_short.html
"Jaylen Brown. People say Tatum is the clear number 1 option on the Celtics, but I think Brown could continue to elevate and possibly be just as good. Both top ten players in the league eventually."
Until Jaylen Brown guards Paskal again üòÅ   OG and Scottie both have higher ceilings than Siakam. Siakam is limited if he can't get to the hoop üèÄ he almost got traded to golden state and still might (which would be in Raptors fans best interest for what you're building...getting wiseman moody and or Kuminga for Siakam and draft picks would really set up the squad for a big push in a couple years
Josh Christopher brought them back for the youngins. Then Jalen Green. Oubre and Jaylen Brown I know was wearing them early.
Tyrese Haliburton and Jaylen Brown.
"Not really a Boston fan, more a Boston troll.   Believes Jaylen Brown is one of the worst players in the NBA."
"The worst whatif for me is if the Celtics took Giannis over Kelly Olynik, we‚Äôd have tatum giannis and jaylen brown. Hell kyrie might have even stayed too"
"There‚Äôs a Jaylen Adam‚Äôs on the bulls and a Jalen Adams on the raptors. Jalen Crutcher, Jalen Green, Jaylen Hands, Jaylen Hoard, Jalen Johnson, Jalen Lecque, Jaylen Nowell, Jalen Smith, Jaleen smith (not a typo), Jalen Suggs, Jalen Tate.

Jaylen Brown?
Jaylen Brown is the best player in the NBA and it isn't close /s
Jaylen Brown
"Jaylen Brown has always been a very underrated midrange scorer ‚Äî I still have flashbacks to him posting up J.J. Redick over and over in the 2017-18 playoffs and shooting over him. Tatum's game definitely looks more aesthetically pleasing, though, and as an outside fan I feel like Tatum is more consistent night-to-night."
Not surprising for Celtics fans to see Jaylen Brown as a more efficient midrange scorer than Tatum. Tatum has a lot of volume from the midrange but is below average compared to peers who take similar number of shots.
"KAT dude is probably the third best center in the league and nobody has given a shit about him in years. (i mean its the timberwolves so no surprise there, but still).  since im biased, jaylen brown since i see a lot of rankings where tatum is way above brown when really they are both in like the 10-20 range for best players in the nba."
"Doc Rivers, De‚ÄôAaron Fox, Rajon Rondo, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kelly Oubre, Steve Nash, DeMarcus Cousins, Kevin Durant, Jaylen Brown, Lou Williams,  Chris Paul, John Wall, Ja Morant, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Draymond Green, Jayson Tatum, JJ Redick, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, and Udonis Haslem have all been guests on their podcast.   Obviously not all of these people are going to be anti-Semitic (one would hope), but just the fact that Jackson‚Äôs podcast has access to such a wide variety of NBA talent that hasn‚Äôt been disrupted despite Jackson‚Äôs track record shows that the hate being shown towards Meyers Leonard is partially insincere and probably coming from people who aren‚Äôt actually Jewish themselves."
Jaylen Brown
Not sure it counts but Jaylen Brown called Redick a bitch and ended up apologizing
"Better example might be KAT who averaged 13/7/2 on 40/00/73 shooting. Some other examples include Jokic (8/6/1 on 46/29/57), Cousins (15/10/2 on 33/00/74), Jaylen Brown (14/6/1 on 32/23/73), Steph (17/5/4 on 33/35/89), and Kemba (16/6/4 on 38/08/78).  Essentially, Summer League is such a small and skewed sample that shooting splits don‚Äôt matter, and such a guard-dominated setting with amateur-level point guard play that wings and bigs without the ball won‚Äôt get much shine."
"Jaylen Brown comes back hot from wrist recovery, and C‚Äôs trade him to Minnesota for KAT."
Sounds similar to Jaylen Brown
Beast. Warriors got another one. His athleticism reminds me of jaylen brown.
Jaylen Brown is 24 and hes a shooting guard. how come you don't want him man?
"The headline makes it sound worse than it is, I think. That‚Äôs the same level as Jaylen Brown, Draymond, Lavine, Siakam, and Westbrook."
"There is no one worthwhile for that. To trade for a star we would have to trade wiggins. Now that means the only real holes in our closing lineup are SF and PF but Dray plays PF at the start of gamss which means SF is the only position. Name any SF we could have gotten that is both a better defender and shooter than Wiggins and is overall better than him as well. You can't there are none.   The better players are KD (untouchable plus wouldn't come here), Kawhi (Untouchable), Pg13 (Untouchable unless Kawhi demands he goes), Tatum (Untouchable), Jaylen Brown (Borderline untouchable only would be moved for a superstar), Middleton (Bucks just won a freaking ring they aren't trading the guy that hit the closeout shot). MPJ could maybe count for this categroy but he can't defend, same with Ingram which is why I wouldn't trade for them.   That leaves guys who are in a similar tier to wiggins but are valued more highly due to contracts like Jerami Grant or OG. And at that point you are just using picks to save cash which is dumb looking at you Tillman."

"Ah yes, the Jaylen Brown defense. Man I hope brown starts ball watching less on help defense. He‚Äôs so good man to man he just needs more awareness."
"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There‚Äôs also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents‚Äô shooting data than what we‚Äôve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

"Saw the list and first thing I thought was ‚ÄòHow much is the difference between Bam and Gobert?‚Äô Looks like an unpopular opinion but:  I remember when they asked, around a year ago, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell who he would build a team around if he was a GM (he couldn‚Äôt pick a player on the Wolves). He said Bam, a modern big who can switch anything, pass, shoot, guard the rim, rebound. No weaknesses, has every intangible. Not a big Dlo fan but it really made me think, I can definitely see what he‚Äôs saying. As good as they are it is actually way easier to find a Jamal Murray PLUS a Jaylen Brown than to find one Bam. I would argue the only player who can do everything Bam does and doesn‚Äôt have a significant weakness that Bam doesn‚Äôt have is AD.. and that‚Äôs not even really true, with AD‚Äôs health. As crazy as it is, it‚Äôs easier to find an unstoppable offensive force like Harden/Luka/Lebron than to find a Bam. I guess the counter argument is you can win a title without a Bam but you can‚Äôt win it without an super dominant offensive player."

Jaylen Brown  Jaylen Nowell  Jalen Johnson   Jalen McDaniels  Jalen Brunson  Jalen Smith  Jaylen Hoard  There‚Äôs also 2-3 other Jalens/Jaylens who are young UFAs
Don't forget Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown will always be the best Jaylen
"Combine that with Jaylen Brown. Can't wait till they guard each other.   ""Jaylen checks Jalen. Jalen backing jaylen down in the post. Jalen looks to spin, ohhh jaylen pulls the chair out from under Jalen!"""
Have you considered Jaylen Brown?
The regular season is really gonna mess OP up when Jalen Green goes up against Jaylen Brown except Jaylen Brown is the one playing for the green team
Has someone warned the other Jalens yet? Is Jaylen Brown safe because of spelling?
The Heat will not make the ECF this year.  Jaylen Brown will be a dpoy candidate within the next two seasons.  Sporks should be a staple in every household.
Simmons for Schroder and Jaylen Brown
"IT doesn‚Äôt deserve to be on an NBA roster, his body is trashed and the people who say otherwise are living in the past. Furthermore Danny Ainge played that perfectly by flipping him for Kyrie. Why be loyal to a guy who can‚Äôt play?  If Jaylen Brown was a pelican then the Celtics would‚Äôve become a dynasty.   Trading for Kyrie was the last great move Danny Ainge had. (This isn‚Äôt controversial)"
"He had Jaylen Brown, but after Jaylen and Kemba got injured he was throwing passes to Luke Kornet and Grant Williams. I would say that is a cast of misfits..."
"Scorching hot take to call people ""overzealous"" for defending a guy who went for 26/7/4 despite [his most frequent lineup by minutes played](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/2021/lineups/) including a guy who was traded at the deadline (Theis) and one of the worst offensive players in the entire league (Thompson). The Celtics got Brooklyn in the first round and had no Jaylen Brown, no Kemba and no Robert Williams, but still took a game from them because Tatum dropped a 50 piece. He went for 50, 40 and 32 in those last 3 games...hard to put anything on him in terms of ""impact"". You can't hold it against him that 3 starters couldn't even suit up in the playoffs and during the regular season the Celtics had Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye playing 20 minutes a night."
The fact that you describe him as playing ‚Äúwith almost no help and a rotating cast of misfits‚Äù when Jaylen Brown is on the team makes me want to disregard your whole ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù.
Counterpoint: he just needs a better team around him and his ranking will skyrocket regardless of his passing. I don‚Äôt honestly think there‚Äôs a massive drop off in the top 15 players in the league but their team success absolutely dictates how they‚Äôre viewed. If Jaylen Brown takes a playmaking leap and if the other players on the roster fall into place we will be talking about Tatum as top 5 soon enough.
"It‚Äôs not like they made bad picks but I wouldn‚Äôt say they ‚Äúhit‚Äù on every single one   Like at the time Ingram Lonzo Russell were all the right picks but all underwhelmed at times on the Lakers, and guys behind them (Jaylen brown, jayson tatum, kristaps Porzingis ) have done better"
1. Bucks Nets Sixers Hawks are the only real contenders in the east  2. Jaylen brown might be the most overrated player in this sub  3. Westbrook is the best pg in the league
"Jayson Tatum, DBook, Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown, Zach Lavine have already peaked. I can‚Äôt see any more upward trajectory due to the fact that all of their games offensively are predictable and sometimes one-dimensional"
"Celtics played the fully healthy Nets without Jaylen Brown, Timelord, Marcus, and if you don‚Äôt count 4 ppg as playing, Kemba."
"Hassan Whiteside is a good NBA player.  Jaylen Brown is better than Tatum.  Russell Westbrook makes the Lakers worse, Dennis + KCP + Kuzma is more value  DeAndre Ayton can potentially be the best center in the NBA by 2025"
"I think you can add Jaylen Brown to the need to improve in this area as well. Especially if the Celtics are unable to acquire a talented pass first point, the two of them will need to continue to improve their passing."
"When people in the future read about the downfall of American society there will be a chapter on how destructive social media was. Twitter especially.   The culture on Twitter is really abrasive and rude. I had a take on Jaylen Brown a few years ago and had at least a dozen people call me a ""fucking idiot"". Say what you will about reddit, but something like that would never fly here."
"Jayson Tatum is overrated, BUT is still a good player. I think he, Brandon Ingram, and Jaylen Brown are all about the same."
"Jaylen Brown to the cavs Garland, Love and your wife to me."
"Yeah I saw a lot of Jaylen Brown comparisons but at this same age, Jaylen could barely handle the ball. Kuminga is far more advanced at this stage of his career."
I remember reading some Jaylen Brown comparisons for Kuminga but Kuminga is already far more advanced as a ball handler and shot creator then Jaylen was at this age.   Warriors got a good one.
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum in 2025. I'm from the future
"Hijacking top comment to say that I am now very confident Okoro will be the next Jaylen Brown.   In Jaylen‚Äôs second summer league (like Okoro), he pulled off [this dunk @3:43](https://youtu.be/nc35b_u2vxY). Almost identical to the Okoro one in the OP."
"I dont think Ingram is realistic but I‚Äôd rather have Simmons over Jaylen Brown. People are blowing up his flaws as impossible to overcome because of what happened in the playoffs, imo."
Simmons package isn't a bad option like the original comment implies but it shouldn't be the ideal package unless Simmons get traded to a third team in exchange for picks. I'd rather see if I could take Ingram from Pelicans or Jaylen Brown from the Celtics.
"being the counterexample I always think of when somebody makes the point that guys like Giannis, Gobert, and Jaylen Brown were all bottom players in the entire NBA as rookies"
"siakam was being guarded by jaylen brown, ibaka was guarded by some german guy with nice tats"
"Siakam was just bad in the bubble so some of that can probably be attributed to something mental or to being out of shape or something. On top of that, Jaylen Brown pretty much has Siakam's number more than anyone else in the league, going back to before the bubble, and Jaylen was on him almost the whole time, and nothing that Nick Nurse tried was able to get him a better matchup."

"I'm really not the one who needs to ""come back to reality"" when the Blazers are going to start the season with a team that Dame publicly said isn't good enough to compete for a championship. If he doesn't care about competing for a championship then he'll stay, and that's fine. But if you follow **what he's said**, it's only a matter of time before he asks out. This is not a championship level team in the West, and he said a coaching change isn't enough.  I think Maxey, Matisse, 3 of our firsts plus whatever you can flip Ben for, gives Portland a good package and send Dame somewhere he can compete for a championship. Pacers offered Brodgon and a first that we turned down, so AT LEAST you could get Maxey, Matisse, Brogdon, and 4 firsts lol. The whole issue is Dame saying he wants to compete for a ring, you could send him to Minnesota or New Orleans but I'd bet he'd end up really pissed at the front office when he's 31 and on a 4 year deal.  If the Warriors want him, they beat our offer. If the Celtics are willing to give up Jaylen Brown, they beat our offer. Otherwise I don't see a team that can both give Dame a real shot at getting to the finals, and include a large package with a bunch of 1st round picks"
No one on planet earth would give up Jaylen Brown for Zach Lavine
There were many games like that during the year and in the playoffs.  Who brought up Jaylen Brown? Im confused.
So a single game defines his career. How about jaylen brown locking him up in the bubble ecsf or last season going 0-6on game tying or winning shots..
Dipo is crazy for turning down a contract that would more than double his career earnings. One that would even make him more highly paid than players in his echelon like Jaylen Brown (assuming all healthy)
"I dont agree with Seth, and I'm afraid of getting a reddit copywrite notice so I wont directly copy the text but to paraphrase -   his argument for Lavine being 3C is that he has blanket skepticism towards players who have an outlier year career season until they have proven more. He raised his FG% on 2s by almost 10% vs his career marks, so he needs to see how much is sustainable, and how much is statistical noise.  His argument for Jaylen Brown is more about ""a recalibration of sub-tiers"" than a decline, but can't put him higher due to ""unproven in the playoffs at this level"" type stuff.  His argument for Shai going to 3B seems to be that his level of self-creation has only been bested by 8 other players in the NBA in terms of career best efficiency at that level of volume (Lebron, Harden, Kyrie, Paul, Luka, Dame.) He argues that Shai is already an elite self-creator esp at his age warranted the move up.  He also seems hesitant to move players more than 1 tier up/down during every update, but idk why Shai somehow gets the special treatment. Seems a little inconsistent from Seth."
"Tier 3A: Booker, Holiday, Trae, Zion  3B: Beal, Mitchell, Morant, Murray, Towns, Conley, Shai  3C: Simmons, Draymond, Siakam, Jaylen Brown, Westbrook, Lavine"
"Healthy Nets beat literally everybody, and by a lot.  Healthy Heat aught to beat healthy Celtics, but age is a huge wildcard. The play of Lowry, Tucker, and Horford factors significantly into that matchup and all three of them are old as fuck and might well get wiped off the board completely this season. The play of Herro, Bam, Brown, Tatum, Nesmith, and Timelord also factors in significantly, and out of them only Jaylen is yet hitting his prime. You should expect them to all look different than they did last year."
Jaylen Brown
"Yeah they should have just traded McCollum for Jaylen Brown, and traded Kanter for Ayton as well"
"That OKC roster had no business being in the playoffs after KD left. Russ did more that season than Kyrie ever did. People were saying OKC should have just blown up the roster once KD left. Stop being dumb. You're talking about Kyrie leading the 2019 Celtics as if the Celtics the prior year weren't playing better without him. You don't make any sense. He made it farther? Lmao, if your team is playing better without you than with you, then you don't get to claim that player is more impactful. Re-read how dumb your argument is.   You still haven't given me one season where Kyrie, being the best player, actually made a team better. Which team did he make better? I'm so confused. He didn't make Cleveland any better since they got two #1 picks with Kyrie as the leader. He leaves Cleveland and hasn't made an NBA finals since while Bron made one the very next season Kyrie left. Boston played better without him and once they got Kemba, they had a better record than the year prior with Kyrie. Did you forget that the Nets two years ago were playing better without Kyrie? They had a better record without him.   Also, Jaylen Brown and Tatum are arguably better players thsn Kyrie. Tatum is already better than him whereas Brown is right up there.  Your arguments have not been good and you know it."
"Jaylen Brown on the radar, celtics look out"
"I agree 100%. And in Schroder‚Äôs case-Lakers offered him around 21 mio per year, which in my opinion was a reasonable contract for both sides. Just if you compare the names that get that amount of money-he would definitely fit in (Grant, Brogdon, Vanvleet etc.) But players that get that extra 5/6 mio that his offered contract are in my opinion just way better than him/proven way more than him (Jaylen Brown, DeRozen, Tatum, Fox, etc.)"
Jaylen Brown is not a top 20 player respectfully
he looks a ton like early Jaylen Brown in this video
Better say Jaylen Brown is a bust too  These colors are full of shit
"&gt;You know there‚Äôs two guard positions right? So Smart and Dennis could play at the same time.   What is the Celtics rotation going to look like? Is Jaylen Brown going to play almost exclusively small forward with Tatum playing almost exclusively power forward? I was under the impression those guys would probably be mainly the 2/3 combo for Boston, but I could be wrong. I think if you put Smart and Schroder out there together that's a dangerous lack of shooting from your guards, but maybe they make it work.   &gt; And they could both be playing hard af for a contract next year. So how would that be a bad thing?   Having just watched a Lakers team that had a bunch of guys angling for free agency, I will say that guys playing hard for a contract does not necessarily mean they're doing what the team needs them to do. If one of Smart or Schroder feels like they're not getting enough minutes or touches, it could lead to poor chemistry with so much money on the line. That could be a lot for a first time coach to be trying to navigate.   &gt; Dennis played with LeBron, a ball dominant player who is basically a point guard, and still almost got that huge contract.  I don't know how close Schroder was this summer to getting a big contract. The Lakers offered him a big one back in February, but that was mainly because they had traded Danny Green and a 1st for him and didn't want him to just end up walking like he's going to. The Lakers were in a position where it was OK to overpay him to keep him, especially because LeBron has for years been looking for someone else to take over many of his ball handling duties. The Lakers also were going to be over the cap either way, so the money wasn't as much of an issue.  &gt;Also, I could totally see a rebuilding team sign him for 20m/yr  You shouldn't look at it like some stupid team will make a mistake and give Schroder a lot of money, you should look at it like if *your* team was bad and rebuilding, how happy would you be if their big splash in free agency was offering Schroder $20 million in cap space. Personally I don't think that market is going to be there for him. It wasn't even close to being there for him this summer, and that's after a year starting for a team. Having to share minutes with a couple other guards probably won't showcase him to the point where another team makes him a big offer. My guess is if he signs the MLE this summer, he'll be doing the same somewhere else next summer.   The only exception I'd make to this is if the Celtics really are planning on trading Marcus Smart as has been rumored a couple times. If they do that, then Schroder might be able to showcase himself to get something decent in free agency next summer. Not $20 million per year, but maybe $10-15 million."
Jaylen Brown
"I love Brown, I hope he never leaves.  If the FO trades Jaylen for Dame I get it though."
"It really depends on how young you are. Ingram turned down around a 5/100-120 extension when he got traded and balled out. Got the 5/158. He was in no way a max player at that time. Same thing for Jaylen Brown when he turned down 4/80 and got 4/107. It works sometimes, but only if you‚Äôre young. I‚Äôve never really seen an older player so what Dennis did."
"Danny Ainge tried to offer the Jaylen Brown and Tatum picks for Justice Winslow.   Sometimes GM's make mistakes, doesn't make them a bad GM overall."
Jaylen Brown is already my daddy so him
"Washington is running out of leverage with Beal, especially if he keeps dropping hints that he wants to sign with Boston next year anyways. We could definitely get Beal without giving up Brown but it would be a stupid move (IMO) and leave us with like 1/3 of a roster. For Lillard we‚Äôd definitely need to give up Jaylen though."
"The 2021 ring was more of a Mickey Mouse ring than the 2020 one. In 2020 the only big injuries were Steph and KD. In 2021, it was LeBron, AD, Harden, Kyrie, Kawhi, Murray, Jaylen Brown, and more"
Westbrook was far and away the least efficient player to score 20+ PPG last year:  |Rk|Player|PTS|TS%| |-:|:-|-:|-:| |1|Russell Westbrook|22.2|.509| |2|Pascal Siakam|21.4|.547| |3|Jerami Grant|22.3|.556| |4|Nikola Vucevic|23.4|.560| |5|Malcolm Brogdon|21.2|.561| |6|DeAaron Fox|25.2|.565| |7|Julius Randle|24.1|.567| |8|Donovan Mitchell|26.4|.569| |9|Collin Sexton|24.3|.573| |10|Terry Rozier|20.4|.575| |11|Jayson Tatum|26.4|.576| |12|Brandon Ingram|23.8|.584| |13|Jaylen Brown|24.7|.586| |14|Devin Booker|25.6|.587| |15|Luka Doncic|27.7|.587| |16|Khris Middleton|20.4|.588| |17|Trae Young|25.3|.589| |18|DeMar DeRozan|21.6|.591| |19|Bradley Beal|31.3|.593| |20|Paul George|23.3|.598| |21|Domantas Sabonis|20.3|.601| |22|Jimmy Butler|21.5|.607| |23|Kyrie Irving|26.9|.614| |24|Kawhi Leonard|24.8|.622| |25|Damian Lillard|28.8|.623| |26|Giannis Antetokounmpo|28.1|.633| |27|Zach LaVine|27.4|.634| |28|Joel Embiid|28.5|.636| |29|Nikola Jokic|26.4|.647| |30|Zion Williamson|27.0|.649| |31|Stephen Curry|32.0|.655|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/psl_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 8/10/2021.
"Ultimately, as a result of trading Pierce, Garnett, Jason Terry, and DJ White, the Celtics have gotten:  * Marcus Smart 6th overall in the 2014 draft (this was the Celtics' own pick, but it is unlikely they would've been drafting 6th if they kept their core)  * Jaylen Brown (pick from Nets)  * Jayson Tatum (pick from Nets, traded to 76ers for 3rd overall pick and 2019 15th overall pick)  *  2018 8th overall pick Colin Sexton (traded to Cavaliers for Kyrie Irving)  * Romeo Langford  The ***only*** thing I fault Ainge for and felt was completely boneheaded in the moment was giving an aging undersized guard a 4 year $141M contract.  Other than that, I can't really think of anything he did wrong.  Hayward was an awful contract but at the time of the signing it seemed great.  And I don't put much stock into ""rumors"" that don't pan out, because none of us are in these front offices, and I would bet that over 80% of NBA rumors are complete BS made up either by reporters or GMs just as a smokescreen."
"I mean he is raw, but people will naturally assume that a guy like that can't develop quickly. Jaylen Brown was considered raw coming into the league and within a few seasons he became very polished and addressed almost all of his weaknesses.  I think definitively saying he will or won't make an impact day 1 is a little premature, but I like what I've been seeing from him early on and I can see why he has so much upside...he has that Lebron-like frame and is used to playing at a higher level of competition than most rookies coming out of college."
I can see why some would say Jaylen Brown is better but it is not as one sided as you make it sound.  Lonzo Ball is not mediocre.  He is at the least a good player at his position especially after he fixed his shooting.  Josh Hart is a solid role player who does his job.  I think it was the best package available.  That being said it is almost impossible to get a fair compensation for a top 5-10 player without include another top player.
They let him go because for the money he makes it‚Äôs not worth it. The pelicans got a lot of mediocre talent in exchange for a top 10 player. Packages centered around Jaylen Brown from the Celtics or RJ Barrett from the Knicks would‚Äôve probably worked out better for the Pels than Brandon Ingram. Jaylen Brown is flat out better than Ingram and RJ Barrett is on the same timeline as Zion and would make an actually good sidekick to him unlike Ingram.
"I actually think Jaylen Brown often gets underrated tbh, when you look at his age and what he provides for the Cs vs the attention that goes to Tatum"
"i'm not arguing all of that - the guy said luka and jaylen would be a 3 or 4 seed. i'm saying tatum and brown already did that or better 3 times, so what's the benefit? we get to lose with luka instead of tatum?"
I agree with this completely. It goes both ways too though - a player gets labeled as a bad defender by somebody and it‚Äôs a tough label to shed even if they‚Äôre actually pretty good. Like Jaylen Brown - he‚Äôs got his issues off ball and he‚Äôs not perfect but overall he‚Äôs a good solid defender - yet I‚Äôve started hearing people say ‚ÄúJaylen Brown is an awful defender‚Äù.   Total aside - people actually say Devin Booker is a good defender?  My god he‚Äôs so bad and it was just on full display for the world to see in the Finals and the Olympics.
"The point I was making is he hasn't shored up any of his defects. Jaylen Brown has improved at most aspects of his game, you can see tangible results. Embiid improves in certain areas each season where you can see he and his trainers/coaches have identified where he needs work to improve and he works at it. For fucks sake, he shoots 3 for Ben!  Meanwhile, Simmons hasn't gotten any better at the shit he's mediocre to bad at. That's why I have ZERO faith he could learn to play the 5. If the dude won't even ATTEMPT a shot or a FT, why the hell would we expect him to learn anything else?"
"don't @ me.  trading for noel then failing to make him into anything.  MCW for 2 years of decent production and then gone?  then post Hinkie process,  ben simmons big mental block over jaylen brown/jamal murray/ingram  fultz, another big mental block over tatum/ball/fox  imagine drafting hometown kid mikal bridges and then trading him before he even puts on the jersey once and his moms works for the team.  sixers ""greatest"" hits all make me giggle.   sixers draft strategy:   is he hyped in the mock draft? yes.  can he shoot? who knows.  does he have the right temperament and intangibles? who the fuck cares."
Would you trade Jaylen brown or smart for him? I wouldn‚Äôt.
Giannis has a better career FT percentage than Jaylen Brown
Jaylen brown was around that in college  At least he takes 3s
"Likewise, Hinkie could have traded Okafor for the #3 pick in 2016 (Jaylen Brown). He turned that deal down and a year later Boston wasn't even willing to offer up a late 1st for Okafor.  That kneecapped them pretty hard too.  I'm not saying Colangelo/Brand did well. I'm saying let's hold Hinkie to the same standard."
President Jaylen Brown
"I don‚Äôt think Portland will have a choice but to sweeten the deal with at least one pick. Maybe with light protections.   But ultimately even if Dame left they shouldn‚Äôt necessarily tear it down to the studs immediately. Admittedly with Covington and Nurkic both on expiring deals maybe they would, but otherwise it might make sense to try to get Jaylen Brown from Boston or something and keep it moving."
Meanwhile the Celtics selected Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum in those very same drafts (very much NOT the consensus picks) but clowns on nba reddit will STILL insist Ainge is overrated trash lol
dead ass serious broseph. fox ain't a star. simmons ain't a star. jaylen brown ain't a star.   I can go on. I have different standards than most and I acknowledge as much. if you disagree that's fine.
"&gt; consildate Collins, Reddish, and picks for a second star to go along with Trae like Pascal Siakam or Jaylen Brown  If the Celtics didn't trade Brown for Harden there no way they trading for a package that would be a downgrade."
Yeah it was basically the equivalent of if jaylen brown died tomorrow and we had to keep his salary on the books until the end of the contract.
"I think rebuilding teams should keep stock piling picks and young players until they hit on the right one. Trade any attractive piece (over 26) for assets.  I think OKC are on the right path. They are the perfect example on how a small market team should rebuild.  Rockets also had took 4 guys in the first round this year and have two FRPs next year. Magic also did great by trading Vucevic for two firsts   Philly took the same approach. They made a bunch of mistakes but they still ended up with Joel Embiid. There‚Äôs a universe where Embiid, Jaylen Brown and Tatum are on the Sixers."
"If Hunter is a white klay, and Jaylen Brown is a black klay, then who is klay?  &amp;#x200B;  Now they are saying it is Huerter not Hunter."
"For sure I def get it and you cant just let talent like that go. But like the originally post that extra star internally needs to happen fast because you have extensions hitting fast. Hunter will get a max, Huerter and Cam will get decent deals as well. I think they should consildate Collins, Reddish, and picks for a second star to go along with Trae like Pascal Siakam or Jaylen Brown"
"How the hell are SGA, Zion, Zach Lavine, dearron fox and jaylen brown most improved candidates? They all took leaps LAST year."
Haliburton had a higher 3pt% on more attempts than rookie Harden. He has over twice as many assists per 36 (adjusting for minutes played just for you) than rookie Harden with fewer turnovers. If you think of humans as linear graphs who only improve their current skills then I totally understand your analysis of rookies. But if you see nba players as the malleable learners that they are you‚Äôll see how people can be so high on players who exhibit skill and the tenacity to improve. Jaylen Brown went from barely being able to dribble a basketball and a 29% 3pt shooter to an excellent ball handler who shot almost 40% from 3 this season. Because skilled players learn new skills and improve in broad areas. Any that don‚Äôt (I.e. Simmons) are a big red flag. I would rather have a younger player who shows that potential being paid less money than an older play who doesn‚Äôt.
"I agree. I think he has a ceiling right now of a very high end role player unless he starts opening up his 1 on 1 game. It can definitely happen but I haven‚Äôt seen too much of that out of him. It‚Äôs not like a rookie Jaylen Brown where you can see that on top of his defense he‚Äôs got a lot of potential as a consistent scoring option - high end role player was more of a floor.   Ben has shown to be a really legitimate floor raiser, and he‚Äôll do more for the Kings now and likely over the next few years. He‚Äôs an all star and nightly triple double threat at the end of the day.   Love Tyrese though. I‚Äôm sure Kings fans want him around long term."
Who would Boston give up? Jaylen Brown has way more value on his contract than Ben Simmons on his.
Ah yes. The fabled 42 points Ben Simmons the Ben Stans always bring up whenever they defend him and say he‚Äôs a top 10 player in the league and apparently better than Jaylen Brown etc.
Barrett probably. I think if Dame was available there would be way more people involved than we think. I‚Äôd love Jaylen Brown. I think Sac could put up a good offer. New Orleans could have but I got no clue what Griffin is doing. Simmons is a good player but he‚Äôs owed too much money for being a second star. Basically same complaint I have with CJ. And I wouldn‚Äôt want to blow my team up and start with CJ. Those guys are put you over the top guys not start from scratch guys.
"I'd take Jaylen Brown over him as well, he's actually demonstrated consistent improvement over his career and worked on his weaknesses, plus he's been an effective playoff performer for the Cs"
Youre not just trading for a superstar who wants out your bidding against the highest offer.   You uave to do better than Shai +youth + several 1sts or Jaylen Brown + youth and 1sts or who knows how high that price could soar
Simmons to Boston for Jaylen brown. I feel like that could make both teams better
To put it into Celtics terms he‚Äôs a marcus smart caliber. Player getting jaylen brown caliber money
The process was to get multiple generational talents to set themselves up for a championship. If they took Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown instead of Simmons and Fultz they‚Äôd be in that position but their drafting/scouting/development  was subpar
Clint Capela over Jaylen Brown? Lol
wtf i thought that was jaylen brown
"Had crazy luck in the playoffs. Nets went out to the 8 seed. Played the Bucks without Giannis. Played the Clippers in the finals and Paul George and Kawhi were both hurt.      Rest of my team is De'aaron Fox, Jaylen Brown, Porzingas, and Douggie Buckets."
I was rooting for the Celtics to take Dragon Bender over Jaylen Brown. Just one of the many I‚Äôm a fan and not in a front office
"I agree, jaylen brown is better than Devin booker and it‚Äôs not even close"
the Jaylen brown disrespect insane
There wasn‚Äôt. This was actually seen as a huge downside for the Raptors as they had just bid their franchise guy for a one year rental coming off an injury. Celtics turned down a trade that would‚Äôve sent Jaylen Brown to the Spurs iirc
Clown world. Jaylen Brown.
Jaylen Brown
"If a Dame trade HAD to happen, I'd be hoping the Celtics would be willing to part ways with Jaylen Brown."
"Put it this way, if Beal or Lillard suddenly want out, what's the superior trade package to Ben Simmons? Jaylen Brown maybe? Brandon Ingram if the Pelicans suddenly want to move the timeline up? Everything that GSW or Knicks have left? Honestly I think the 76ers can realistically assume they would be in the driver seat in those scenarios, still."
Klay or Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown? Moses Brown?
"&gt;Look at the Harden trade - Rockets didn't get anyone back to build around.  2 things wrong with this  1. Rockets gave up their 2024 and 2026 picks to the Thunder in the Westbrook trade so that is why they had took the Nets deal which replenished. Portland has all their draft picks except 2022 which is lottery protected until 2028 so they dont need a pick centered package 2. Everyone litterally says that the Harden trade was awful and the Rockets made a mistake lol  Portland can get back a bunch of picks if they trade all of CJ,Nurkic,Powell,Covington and Nance but from a Damian Lillard trade they need a star they can build around like Brandon Ingram or Jaylen Brown"
Klay hasn‚Äôt played a game in two years. There‚Äôs no way he should be #2 right now. I think the highest you can possibly put him is 6 (assuming Jaylen Brown is classified as a SF for this list in particular).
1. James Harden  2. Klay Thompson  3. Donovan Mitchell  4. Devin Booker  5. Zach LaVine  6. Bradley Beal  7. Jaylen Brown  8. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  9. Colin Sexton  10. CJ McCollum
The KG and Pierce trade. Still the dumbest trade I‚Äôve seen in my life. Even worse is that those first round pick Boston got ended up being Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum in the future. Well at least we got the big 3
Jaylen Brown?
I'm sorry but hes just not a good second option to win a title with. Mavs need to look elsewhere.   I even think Jaylen brown isn't a good second but THIRD option for a title team. But maybe it's just for us because we lack elite passers
Saw Jermaine O‚ÄôNeal at a barber shop that I go to in Dallas a few years back. Looked like he was in a rush so I didn‚Äôt bother him. Met Jaylen Brown in Los Angeles this past July and he was a real down to earth guy. He looked like he was heading somewhere but took the time to have like a 5-10 min conversation with me.
"The playoff run your referencing is certainly impressive, especially as a rookie. But ‚Äúleading‚Äù isn‚Äôt actually accurate. He was certainly one of the main driving forces, but it was a very by committee effort from that entire squad. I can also mention impressive regular season performances PG has had so that doesn‚Äôt really mean anything. And when PG missed those clutch free throws he was far and away the biggest threat and no one on his team was on the caliber of Jaylen Brown and he lead the playoffs in minutes significantly at that point. Reggie Jackson did help him a lot though.   I just think PG is better. He‚Äôs way better defensively, shoots better everywhere from the floor and is a better playmaker. Tatum‚Äôs ceiling is def higher though he can pass PG in 1-2 years easily"
"Brogdan comes from an academic family and matriculated in a five year program where he could get his MPA and his history degree at the same time, which he chose to do because he redshirted for a year.   That speaks to both his academic acumen and his acumen navigating academia (his mom's a VP at Morehouse, before that she chaired the department of psycology).    Jaylen Brown managed to convince his academic advisor to let him enroll in a master level course at his first semester.  That's not something you can do just because you are good at school and good at navigating bureaucracy.  It's very different."
Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray
Dwight Howard I guess   Jaylen Brown now   Sharife Cooper next üòà
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown you say?
"Interesting.  For Jaylen Brown however, it seems like this stigma followed him far past the draft.  Based on this, Malcom Brogdan seems much more impressive.  Just seems like there is a disproportionate amount coverage about Jaylen Brown's intellect."
"Jaylen Brown.  Everybody has always doubted JB while appreciating the incredible growth in his game, and the conventional wisdom has always put him on a lesser trajectory than Tatum and the other guys in that tier.   I don‚Äôt know about mvp but definitely 1st/2nd all-nba I can for sure see as possible."
JAYLEN BROWN!!!
Jaylen Brown
"I am a Celtics fan, so you can guess who I am gonna say.  Jaylen Brown.  He is obviously being outshined by Tatum, but Brown just gets better in very meaningful ways every year and has turned things that were once a weakness (handles) in strengths.   I think Brown just has the possibility of just becoming such a full package that he overtakes Tatum (though I think it will be hard for Brown to become a better scorer.) And becomes that guy. And one think I still appreciate about him is his consistency the past few years."
"Jaylen Brown as a prospect was covered heavily.  He took a different route academically and knew he would spend very little time at Berkley compared to the average student, so he designed much of his own curriculum and made arrangements with professors to get the most out of his time.  Most kids don't do that.  Rarely even the bright kids, especially in state schools.  There are a few players that the press just loves to laud their perceptiveness and worldliness, especially given their young age.  It's an awesome talking point, Mo Bamba had some favorable coverage where the press talked up his smarts, Malcolm Brogdan had a masters degree by the time he was drafted, etc etc.  Academic excellence can generate click throughs just as well as academic scandal.  In the end, much of draft coverage aims only to be amusing and have the audience come away feeling informed."
Dwight Howard after him Jaylen Brown
"Speaking of which, why is it always Jaylen Brown when people compare smart NBA players.  Even the broadcasters routinely mention it during Celtics games."
Jaylen Brown
jaylen brown is also one of those black guys perceived as being ‚Äúwell-spoken‚Äù and ‚Äúarticulate‚Äù
Like jaylen brown? Who went to college for a year? That's a pretty quick degree.
Celtics are up there too so glass houses and all that but there‚Äôs been quite a few Warriors fans with upvoted comments this offseason who seem to think there‚Äôs a real possibility the Celtics will trade them Jaylen Brown either directly or as part of a Beal trade where for some reason they‚Äôd get Jaylen instead of the Wizards who‚Äôd get picks (saw this before the draft most). Made no sense to me.
Maybe have Smart and Jaylen Brown play some defense next time ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Since 2016, the Celtics have been to the ECF every year except two: last year losing in the 1st round to the superteam Nets w/o Jaylen Brown, and 2019 in the Semis w/ dysfunctional Kyrie.   Their core has remained largely the same (Brown/Tatum/Smart)  So don't get confused and think last year's Celtics is representative of their actual talent."
"Jaylen Brown didn‚Äôt have one until late 2019 but even he eventually did, he‚Äôs a smart guy who wanted to go without one and even then ended up with an agent, so there‚Äôs gotta be a benefit"
Pretty sure Jaylen Brown doesn‚Äôt have one
"The NBA is not soft in terms of defense. The offense is just better than it was before. Defense will always remain the same because of the limited stuff you can do in defense. Offenses will continue to evolve over time.   Mid range jump shots will always be the key to winning team no matter what era. The best offensive perimeter players prove this. (MJ, Kobe, KD, LeBron, Steph, Bird, etc). Pretty confident the team stats will back this up too. Feel free to fact check this.   Physical defense does not mean better defense  Jayson Tatum, DBook, Jaylen Brown, BI, Bam have already peaked. Can‚Äôt see any further development in these guys.   MJ had less expectations coming in the league compared to Bron.   This maybe a preference thing but I would rather take a longer lasting prime than the highest peak ever for 3-5 years.   Robert Horry is a HoF candidate just not first ballot. (Sam Jones already set this precedent)  Reggie Miller is overrated. His legacy is built upon his moments and elevated playoff play only."
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. That's the answer you seek.
"He's 7'0, not a great dribbler, and not a great shooter. A lineup of Mobley, Markkanen, and Allen just will not score. This has been tried in the NBA and does not work. Basically no dribbling from positions 3-5 is a disaster.  His defensive versatility is great as a center, but his ability to defend the perimeter is good *for a center*, not a wing. He's still slow compared to NBA wings in general. Imagine him trying to guard Jaylen Brown, Middleton, Jimmy Butler, DeRozan, etc. That's a nightmare lol  I think Markkanen would have been a great move if you guys didn't already throw $100M at Allen. Your next 4 years barring trades are now locked in with those 3 guys....if I were a Cavs fans I'd have much preferred letting Mobley develop into a legit stretch 5. Gonna be hard to do with this big man logjam  Happy to be wrong, but having your franchise center develop at the 3 when he's clearly out of place screams disaster to me"

I want to go down from Boston in my Jaylen Brown jersey.
"&gt; NBA agent Rich Paul says he warned the Boston Celtics about trading for Anthony Davis for their own good.   &gt;Paul told ESPN‚Äôs Dave McMenamin ‚Äî in a report Tuesday about how the All-NBA big man‚Äôs blockbuster deal from the New Orleans Pelicans to the Los Angeles Lakers went down ‚Äî **that he tried to persuade other suiters, like the Celtics, against mortgaging their future for Davis.**  &gt; ‚ÄúThe last thing you want to do is put a GM in a situation where he trades away an asset and then the guy walks out the door,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLike, you can‚Äôt do business that way. So it‚Äôs not really a hard conversation to have.‚Äù  &gt; Paul ‚Äî who represents a number of high-profile stars, including Davis and his new Lakers teammate LeBron James ‚Äî **had made it clear at the time that his 26-year-old client would likely leave in free agency next summer if the Celtics acquired him from the Pelicans.**  &gt;‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it stopped Danny Ainge from trying,‚Äù he told ESPN.  &gt;The Celtics had tried to compete with the Lakers‚Äô trade offers last June and some fans urged the team to go all in for Davis, a franchise-caliber talent. Ainge has reportedly coveted the six-time All-Star for years. However, according to Paul, he ultimately ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt willing to give up the young players.‚Äù While the Celtics were reportedly open to trading some combination of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, or Marcus Smart, they weren‚Äôt willing to match the package of players and draft picks that the Lakers ultimately sent to the Pelicans for Davis ‚Äî especially if he might leave Boston after one season.   &gt;‚ÄúI don‚Äôt blame him,‚Äù Paul said. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt give them up either if the guy is not going to re-sign.‚Äù  &gt;Davis had narrowed his preferred destinations to the Lakers and the New York Knicks ‚Äî and Paul pushed to make sure other teams knew that. **David Griffin, the Pelicans executive vice president of basketball operations, told ESPN that Paul ‚Äúhad done such an effective job of smoking out all of the competition‚Äù that the team realized they wouldn‚Äôt get a better deal than what had been offered by the Lakers.**  &gt;**In May, Paul told Sports Illustrated that the Celtics could trade for Davis, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôll be for one year.‚Äù Shortly after Davis first requested a trade in February, his father also spoke out against the idea of his son playing for the Celtics, ‚Äúafter what they [had] done to Isaiah Thomas,‚Äù who was traded for Kyrie Irving while recovering from a hip injury he sustained during the 2017 playoffs, which derailed his career.**  &gt;Paul didn‚Äôt express opposition to the concept of Davis playing for the Celtics, but said he made the risk clear to the team.  &gt;‚Äú**If the Celtics traded for Anthony Davis, we would go there and we would abide by our contractual [obligations] and we would go into free agency in 2020,‚Äù he told SI. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve stated that to them. But in the event that he decides to walk away and you give away assets? Don‚Äôt blame Rich Paul.‚Äù**  The 'Ainge has no loyalty' narrative was steaming hot at this time and the quote was used at the perfect time when Celtics seemed ready to finally pull the trigger on AD now that it was clear he wasn't staying in New Orleans. Just seems awfully coincidental."
"I just looked at the odds, top 6 is SGA, Zion, KPJ, MPJ and Lavine, with Jaylen Brown not to far away at 9th. I would probs go with SGA looking at the odds now lol. I guess i just want Ben to do well being an Australian Sixers fan"
"What world are you living in?  First it would take at least Jaylen Brown from Boston.    Don‚Äôt bother roping a third team in, as this isn‚Äôt the Simmons situation. KAT isn‚Äôt a distressed asset because he wants out. He can shoot. He‚Äôs also not Klutch. Multiple teams will want to get in on KAT, and because of that market alone the cost of business will be a Jaylen Brown type - and more."
I mean we definitely have a great defence this year. Not sure if I can say the same thing about the offence. Plus I think Jaylen Brown is tradable as long as Marcus Smart stays
Jaylen Brown Paul George Kawhi Leonard
Jaylen brown
Jaylen brown
Jaylen brown
Technically not wrong with the hint I gave but it‚Äôs Jaylen Brown üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Is it Jaylen Brown?
"His trade value is high because he is irreplaceable. He brings things that nobody‚Äôs else in the nba brings. You look at players like mitchel, Jamal Murray, and such Jaylen brown who are All star calibers shooting guards but there are 10-15 1/2/3 guards who can get you points and play d maybe not as good but will only be a slight drop off. You can‚Äôt find another player who effects other teams offense like Gobert."
Mans really typed out Jaylen Brown and then followed it up with Donte Divcenzo. Bruh
"Simmons is 25 and is essentially the same offensive player today as he was when we walked in the NBA.   No one is trading for Simmons banking on him becoming a semi-competent shooter, or becoming a good pick and role player, abusing smaller guards in the post, rampaging to the rim like Giannis etc. 3 years ago you could. And, 3 years ago Simmons for Jaylen Brown or Mitchell was a thing. But, those days are gone.  You're describing some supped-up version of Lonzo Ball that is harder to fit on a team right? A really high-level role player with serious limitations.   Simmons is a good player and brings a lot to the table. But, the thing he is not good at is the most valued thing in basketball. Being able to create offence in the half-court. Adding to that, non-ballhandlers who can't space the floor are difficult to fit on teams.   I think most teams would be happy to have Simmons but we are talking about James Harden-type packages."
Jaylen Brown &gt; Brandon Ingram
Jaywatch. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen brown
"Yea doesn't right, Easier to replace someone like Brown than KAT. Jaylen Brown competition is what? PG, Harden, Mitchell, Booker, Lavine, Beal, Murray, CJ, SGA etc. and who is KAT's? Jokic, Embiid, AD, Gobert? Gimme KAT all day. KAT average more on like two less shots. Surround KAT properly like even the Nuggets are with Jokic and he would in the convo for top 10 in the league easily."
"Goddamn from ""It's a Simmons-Ingram draft"" to ""Jaylen Brown is the best player in that draft class""     Life comes at you fast ngl"
Oh well. Nets also faced a team without Jaylen Brown and then Donte DiVincenzo
"Even if he demanded a trade, enough suitors will be involved that it would cost Jaylen Brown and more."
Jimmy Butler or Jaylen Brown?
Surprised to see nobody mention Jaylen Brown or DeMar Derzon yet
"Not saying Ben isn‚Äôt worthy but Jamaal Murray, Jaylen Brown and Ingram definitely get taken over him in a redraft today.   Depending on how who you ask, Siakam and Sabonis might too."
- PG: Steph Curry $10 - SG: Jaylen Brown $4 - SF: Khris Middleton $5 - PF:  Giannis Antetokounmpo $10 - C: Myles Turner $1  I'd sacrifice my left nut to see Giannis and Steph play together.

"KAT, Giannis, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Lowry"
"You can have KD warriors plus Myles Turner lol  Alternatively, if Klay isn't back to normal, Jaylen Brown and Ayton instead."
"Steph, Jaylen Brown, Jimmy Butler, Julius Randle, Vucevic üî•"
"Nah. With Jaylen brown also growing, and now Dennis vein added, I actually see him going down from 26 to 24."
"Yeah, to be clear I do think it *is* an overpay, but the Hawks are probably hoping for it to end up more like the Jaylen Brown extension than the... I dunno, who's a guy who got overpaid in RFA but didn't get maxed? Buddy Hield?"
"Your right. The Celtics played the Nets with all of Durant, Harden, and Kyrie healthy in the first round. And without Jaylen brown. The degree of difficulty was much harder this year! And yes I understand they were the 7 seed, but that‚Äôs what happens when ur entire starting lineup misses at least a month of the regular season, and your best 5 players never are really on the court at the same time. And the Celtics with Kyrie beat the pacers, and after game 1 got smoked by the Bucks, and if u watched the series you should know Kyrie‚Äôs play had nothing to do with the Degree of difficulty, it had to do with the fact he had checked out and knew he was done in Boston months beforehand"
"2021 Worse than every year where you had kyrie? Kyrie was healthy for one playoff run as a Celtic, and Jaylen brown the 2nd best player on the Celtics was out for the playoffs in 2021, so what‚Äôs your point?"
"Even though he‚Äôs a Celtic, I don‚Äôt think anyone really hates Jaylen Brown: he‚Äôs cool, smart, obviously hard-working, and good (but clearly not the best on the team, so he doesn‚Äôt get the hater lightning rod effect)"
Jaylen Brown wasn‚Äôt very good
"I don't remember his username but he's also really hot on Jaylen Brown, said Lonnie is the only player with higher ceiling than him in the NBA right now. No Spurs flair I don't think."
"&gt;but Jaylen Brown is better at generating more points per field goal attempt.  except no cause if your fouled on a field goal and miss the shot efg% doesn't count for the free throws, ts% does. i dont understand why the goto stats isnt just pionts/fga tho, why would that not measure eficiency in the best possible way?"
"It's definitely unpopular. I'd probably say the idea of Ben Simmons &gt; Jaylen Brown. Simmons is obviously a better defender, passer, and rebounder. I'm don't know too much about Brown as a passer and rebounder but he's at the very least a solid defender and is a much better scorer. Simmons playing at his best is better than Brown playing at his best. The most ideal version of Simmons is better than the most ideal version of Brown, even though we're probably way past the point that Simmons will ever reach his absolute ceiling.  I feel like this comparison is entirely based on expectations. Simmons can raise a bad team's floor higher than Brown can because of his all-around impact. I think Brown raises a good team's ceiling higher than Simmons can because as far as I know there isn't an area of his game where he's a complete liability. The playoffs obviously weren't ideal for him but if Simmons suddenly flips a switch when he gets traded and starts scoring more this isn't even a debate (he's had some absolutely insane games that make you wish he was more aggressive). But right now I feel like there's a strong case for either one depending on how important you think scoring vs. all-around impact is."
Jaylen brown is better imo
"You brought up team performance when you had no argument for Brown on an individual level. Not me. I'm just gonna save my keyboardstrokes, I'll never change your opinon. I'm sure you'd want no part of Rudy Gobert either on your team since he's been exposed in the playoffs twice now too.   Keep talking yourself into Jaylen Brown, every Celtics fan I've ever interacted with online thinks he's more valuable than AD, PG or Kawhi who'dve been available for a trade if Brown was thrown in. Not even talking about the contract situations when either of these players was avilable. It's a waste of time, you couldn't convince me that Simmons is better than Bam either for bias reasons. Let's just save us both time"
"Jahlil Okafor for the 2016 #3 pick (that became Jaylen Brown) was a popular proposal right before the 2016 draft.  It was a reach even at the time, but I remember Sixers fans saying that wasn't enough for Jahlil."
"Jaylen brown &gt; Tatum, I'll go to the grave feeling that. JB is plug and play, he can fit on any team in any scenario. You have to build around Tatum. Also his shot selection is shoddy, and jb has improved much more consistently than jt"
that's definitely unpopular. It's a good example. I would easily take Jaylen Brown for an established team but Simmons would be better for a rebuilding team.
Caruso&gt;Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown &gt; Jayson Tatum
Him and Jaylen Brown were on the same trajectory at one point (2017). It's such a fucking bummer.
"In a vacuum I really don't disagree but I think Jaylen Brown is more valuable, if that makes sense?"
I think Jaylen Brown is a better and more important part of the Celtics than Jayson Tatum
"Jaylen Brown &gt; Booker, Lavine, Murray, Ja, Donovan Mitchell, Ben Simmons"
Ben Simmons had more points last playoff than Jaylen Brown.  So you are onto something.
"It's not bad at all, people just use it incorrectly all the time, such as when comparing who is a more efficient shot maker as opposed to raw scorer. TS% includes free throws, whereas something like eFG% does not, therefore TS% is better to see who can score more on a per possession basis, where eFG% is better to see who scores more on a per shot basis, e.g who is actually better at making shots. For example, Trae Young has a TS% of .589, to Jaylen Browns .586, but Trae Young only has an eFG% of .499 to Brown's .558. Trae is better at scoring per possession, but Jaylen Brown is better at generating more points per field goal attempt."
Jaylen brown&gt;Bradley beal
It‚Äôs was largely a one on one matchup my guy. Jaylen brown punked him the whole series
"Siakam was struggling to score against a depleted Nets team that our bench dropped 100 points on in a single game. Jaylen Brown has nothing to do with this, he is not that guy  Ridiculously delusional take that tells me you should not be taken seriously by anyone ever"
1.	Jaylen Brown 2.	Jamal Murray 3.	Ben Simmons 4.	Pascal Siakam 5.	Brandon Ingram 6.	Domantas Sabonis 7.	Dejounte Murray 8.	Fred VanVleet 9.	Malcolm Brogdon 10. Caris LeVert 11. Jakob Poeltl 12. Buddy Hield
More like extremely biased. Especially given that Jaylen Brown absolutely locked up Siakam in the playoffs
jaylen brown is better than donovan mitchell and zach lavine (and sometimes dbook)
I'd go siakam &gt; jaylen brown for a semi-biased one
"Idk if this is unpopular, but I still think that: Ben Simmons &gt; Jaylen Brown"
I would go with either Jaylen Brown or Jamal Murray or Pascal Siakam
After what I saw Jamal Murray do in the bubble...he gets the number one pick. Jaylen Brown 2nd cause of his two way skills but he still can't get a bucket like Jamal. Then it's between Simmons and Brandon Ingram depending on what you're looking for. Defense or offense. Actually you'd be better served with Siakim at 3rd or 2nd and then Simmons and BI can fight for that 4th pick.
"&gt; If Jaylen can get a little better with playmaking, it'll really open up their offense, because he's clearly the better decision maker  Uhhh, did you read my post? He turns it over just as often as Tatum despite having to do way less of the primary creation. His turnovers are usually live ball and he makes a lot of really terrible passes and bad decisions.      I also think it's disingenuous to say Jaylen's playmaking has gotten so much better, so he will be better than Tatum at it soon. Tatum's has also gotten a lot better and he's consistently been better than Brown at playmaking their entire careers'. I don't think that's going to change."
"Hence a story about the 2016 draft class which after all that has happened still lists a guy who can't shoot a free throw and shyed away from an open dunk as the top pick in a class that included Jaylen Brown, Sabonis, Ingram, and others.... total bs."
"Jaylen Brown is my pick too. All around great player, one of the best 2-way players in the game. Has a versatile game strategy and the flexibility to adapt to different defenses. He's one of my favorite players in the game based solely on his skillset and mentality. He's one of those players that you can slot in at multiple positions on any team and have something special every time.  Jamal Murray is a close 2nd in my mind. He's explosive, confident, and has the skillset to be the scoring option that many teams lack. Jokic and Murray are a great fit as they can pick up each other's slack on off days and command the floor when needed."
"I hope Jaylen Brown reads this, lol."
"1. Ben Simmons  2. Jaylen Brown  3. Domantas Sabonis  4. Brandon Ingram  5. Pascal Siakam  6. Jamal Murray  7. Malcolm Brogdan  8. Dejounte Murray  9. Caris LeVert  10. Buddy Hield  11. Fred VanVleet  12. Malik Beasely  13. Jakob Poeltl  14. Alex Caruso   I understand that this may be controversial so please enlighten me on how I'm wrong, but please keep the Ben Simmons slander to a decent level. We can't just pretend he isn't a great player."
Who tf puts these together and do they watch/like basketball? Forget Simmons still going #1 over players like Jamal Murray and Jaylen Brown where their GMs would hang up if Morey called with a straight swap‚Ä¶‚Ä¶But they have Zubac AND Poeltl going over Caris Levert this with the benefit of hindsight. What a pointless exercise. They zero credibility so it doesn‚Äôt even spark a real debate.
The disrespect to Jaylen Brown ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
&gt; Delusional about Jaylen Brown at this point.  the irony.
"Good shooter, passer, and defender for his position while being very young. All he needs to do is become elite at those things hes already good at or improve upon some of the flaws you mentioned. I think the most important would definitely be handle. If he can break down defenders the game will open up for him. Im a celtics fan and it isnt an exact comparison but jaylen brown had the similar strengths and weaknesses. Once his handle got tighter he became a different player, an all star."
"People said the same about James harden, and jaylen brown, and Bradley Beal. Remember when people were saying beal won‚Äôt be anything more than a 3 point shooter?"
They haven‚Äôt considered Jaylen Brown. They gotta put some respek on his name!
If the sixers had jaylen brown they probably make the ecf last year and maybe even make it in 2019
"Hell no give me jaylen brown, Brandon Ingram sabonis and Jamal Murray over simmons right now"
"So you‚Äôre talking about Jaylen Brown, yes?"
"Jaylen Brown, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Nash, Dirk, Miller  Maybe less than mediocre is a stretch, but they were all pretty damn pedestrian as rookies and showed occasional flashes"
Delusional about Jaylen Brown at this point. He's far and away the best player in this class already and has improved every single year
Jaylen Brown
As long as its not Jayson Tatum or Jaylen Brown
Why would the Celtics pick up Lavine when they already have Jaylen Brown? Actual question
"I think they‚Äôre actually pretty underrated. Tatum is only like 22 and has been to the eastern conference finals twice, semis, and only first round loss was against the nets without jaylen brown."
Jaylen Brown has been doing this kind of stuff. Obviously not as much hang time. But some of them are pretty close.Ôøº
"I really think the last guy who really had it was Kobe. None of the new era guys seem to have it as much - there‚Äôs a sense of spoiled entitlement rather than that old school killer instinct. To me it‚Äôs that hunger of wanting to beat the opponent and also be the guy to do it.  For example, Harden gives off the vibe that he thinks he‚Äôs the best player on the court at all times and a lot of times he‚Äôs not. A lot of times though if things aren‚Äôt going his way he gets kind of pissy and bails on plays like he‚Äôs owed the basket.   Occasionally, Lebron gives off a similar vibe. Game 6 Lebron was pure killer instinct, but you see at times when he‚Äôs disappointed in his teammates he gives off really negative body language, he whines about non-calls, and he seems to have shaky uncertainty about taking the last shot.   KD and Steph to me don‚Äôt really have it because they seem to be playing their own game. KD is zoned in on his ISO play but not in a way where he wants to dominate his opponent - he just seems to want the shot. Steph seems to play with a positive energy game where he feeds off good plays and good shots but you can see how psyched he his teammates are making shots and the fans are having a good time.   Paul Pierce also had it- he always wanted to take the last shot and throw down and beat his opponent and prove he was the best player on the court. Tatum and Jaylen Brown by contrast seem like new era guys - they accept losses, they are on good terms with their opponents, they don‚Äôt seem to revel in beating their opponents as much as just getting the W.   The closest new era guys that seems to give off the vibe is Jimmy Butler and Trae Young - both seem to really enjoy beating their opponents and being the guy that does it."
"Kyrie aint kyrie without AI in the league.  How quickly the past fades away for us. Perhaps Kyrie is ""better"" as you say, ok so he is.  AI played in a different era, where it was possible to play how he did and he crushed it.  But in sports, stats aren't everything.  There is no stat for Kyrie being a kook and teammates probably liking AI more or the fact Iverson had the balls to try to lead a team by himself against the likes of Kobe and Shaq, one of the most insane duos the L has ever seen, where as Kyrie needs 2 of the top 5-10 players in the league to team up with.  Iverson took a JV squad to the finals at the helm, Kyrie with the celts made the playoffs 1 out of two years and got bounced in the second rounds having baller teammates like, marcus smart, al horford, jayson tatum, jaylen brown plus a good coach.  Different players, different times.  Both hoopers.  Both got solid shoes too."

"Alrighty then. Counterpoint to that. Explain someone like Jaylen brown, who was known a s terrible 3 shooter through high school, and continued that too college, but has always been above average in the nba.   That came through adjusting of technique and repetition."
"A comparison would be like if a Jaylen Brown for Klay Thompson trade happened right now. You can sorta see the logic of it, but it's not a good idea"

"I wish I could've seen prime Larry Bird &amp; the 80s Celtics, I am old but not quite old enough to have seen them play.  Same for MJ &amp; the Bulls in the 90s, I watched them on TV all the time but never got to see the GOAT in person.     I feel very fortunate to have seen Dirk, KD, LeBron, the SSOL Suns (prime Amar'e Stoudemire was so fucking fast), the 2008 Celtics, Sonics era Ray Allen, Dame Lillard &amp; Brandon Roy (I even got to see healthy Greg Oden!), 2017 IT, Jayson Tatum (and Jaylen Brown) and Giannis in person.  I need to see Curry live this year if I can..."
Ya I agree with this too. Love Jaylen Brown the person as much as the player. True leader
You would really trade him for Jaylen Brown?
"&gt; The narrative is just untrue.  How is it not true?  They finished 23rd in Defensive Rating. They gave up a 118 Offensive Rating to the Celtics in the 1st round, without Jaylen Brown and without Kemba+Rob Williams for half the series.  The only evidence of the Nets being somewhat competent on defense is the 7-game series against the Bucks, of which there is a major asterisk on that, due to the fact that their Big 3 wasn't healthy. Everybody ignores this point about the Nets health, Kyrie/Harden getting injured made their defense *better*.   Obviously, it made their offense worse and they were a worse team overall than they would have otherwise been if they were healthy. But they were definitely a better defensive team with those minutes going to Bruce Brown.   Also let's not forget that Milwaukee is a team offensively that isn't set up to take advantage of Brooklyn's warts defensively, they don't have a guard that can abuse Kyrie/Harden in switches. A team like Atlanta or even Washington is so much more threatening to Brooklyn's defense than Milwaukee is.  There's a definitive ceiling as to how good your defense can be with a Kyrie/Harden backcourt."
"ofc I can, y‚Äôall were title favorites and got bounced by the suns. celtics lost jaylen brown and had to get in the playoffs playing the play in game with tatum dropping 50 bro"
*but he was a better player than Jaylen Brown* - Philly fans everywhere
"He's absolutely a star, he just isn't a superstar. He's in that Jaylen Brown/Devin Booker/Rudy Gobert/Khris Middleton/Donovan Mitchell"
"i think the biggest problem is they've lacked any real consistency, especially outside of Jaylen Brown and Tatum.  in 2020 Hayward and Kemba got big minutes and a ton of shot attempts when they played, but they could not be at all relied on to play regularly.  Kemba was the same way last year to an even worse degree.  due to injuries and covid, the celtics have had a bunch of lineups where the second best scorer/ball handler is marcus smart, who really shouldn't be a top-2 option on offense (i love him but that's not playing to his strengths).  and if its not him, its probably someone way worse/more inexperienced like brad wannamaker or romeo langford.  i think if they can just get consistency from their role players they can actually start to run a real offensive system, which they haven't really had in years.  in terms of personnel, this is the best i've felt about a celtics roster since they traded for Kyrie and signed Hayward (but before Hayward broke his leg)."
I remember when Philly fans clowned the Celtics for taking Jaylen Brown and when they rubbed Ben Simmons in our face. We‚Äôll look who‚Äôs clowning now..
The disrespect to Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown and Shai probably need to be in their own tier above CJ and Ant
"i just imagine if danny ainge traded Jayson Tatum or Jaylen Brown after 3 seasons for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb and a couple FRPs.  he wouldn't have stepped down as GM, he would've been absolutely chased out of town with pitchforks.  and the Celtics will be lucky if Tatum or Brown becomes anywhere near as great a player as Harden.  to Presti's credit, i do think he is particularly good at evaluating college talent.  but that is where his good qualities as a GM end."
Ben Simmons since he already has 3 and Jaylen Brown since he's the best player in the list aside from maybe Ben and he's in the east.
"Biased answer would be MPJ.   Realistic answer would probably Jaylen Brown.   Also, the inverse of these all-star snub threads are who are you taking out to put them in?"
"Good point about the Jaylen comparison, but the leap Barrett made last year I think speaks volumes to his work ethic and his capacity to improve. He is asked to do a lot as a rookie and a sophomore on the offense. He has multiple roles that he's trying to simultaneously fill and even last year that offense had no direction to it and had to deal with Payton at the 1. Brown got to be efficient because those Boston teams had scoring, playmaking, and shooting at every position.   Also I'm sorry, I really don't give a shit about defensive metrics. They are notoriously unreliable and defense is a team sport. Like you said, we were the third-best defense and RJ was second in the league in minutes played. It's not like we had any defensive stoppers on the team. True, most of that is Thibs, but I think it would be insane to say he was a negative on defense. The stats lie here, as they so often do with defensive metrics. And his heavy metrics also likely contribute to his decreased effeciency"
"It's not a crazy take I don't think, becoming Jaylen Brown would be a great get for the Knicks and for RJ's career."
"There‚Äôs no comparison, the question is whether he can eventually attain the level of play of a Jaylen Brown."
Jaylen Brown focus offball challenge
"I don't think his defense is far off from Jaylen Brown's at all. I think there's hardly a difference at all tbh.  The issue is that RJ is smaller and much less athletic than Brown, and 90% of guys don't improve their shooting the way Brown did"
"That's not an unreasonable take, I don't think RJ in his prime and current Jaylen Brown would be too different. I think biggest question is if he can get his defense up to Brown's level, which could be hard if he's expected to the be the #1 option in the future. Brown's also up there in efficiency which RJ could theoretically reach but it'd be hard as well."
"youre very clearly not over this, if you were you wouldnt still be getting upset about the things im telling you  jaylen brown has been the most consistent improver on a year to year basis i think the league has ever seen. the strides hes been taking are historic. unless anthony edwards (a guy who has yet to make any tangible improvements to his game in 3 years) can improve in similar ways to jaylen brown i have very serious doubts that he ever even sniffs an all-nba team  scoring is a facet of basketball, but unless you can do other things (which anthony edwards cant) youre not going to be a great player like youre affirming him to be"
"Lmao dude you‚Äôre so full of shit. Talkin bout ‚Äúpeople pretend they know so much when they don‚Äôt‚Äù and in the same comment saying ‚ÄúI know that jaylen brown works 10x harder than Anthony Edwards‚Äù. Get the fuck outta here with that shit, why would you think that you know that? Like I said, good luck with whatever package you end up getting back. I‚Äôm very much over this"
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vuƒçeviƒá Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
"Jayson Tatum.  He's trash compared to people's opinion of him, especially Celtics fans. He takes bad shots And a lot of them. He doesn't create good looks for his team mates. He takes away team mates opportunities. He's far too inconsistent, which again hurts the team, is he gonna shoot 3/20 tonight and get blown out by the Bulls, hit 3/15 and lose to the Wizards or go 20/30 and beat the Nets, who knows just roll a dice. Guess his teammates just hope Tatum pops off? Cause they aren't getting enough ball to get any rhythm going if he doesn't.  The more the Celtics rely on Tatum, and the less they have other players on court taking and creating shots the worse they do. I swear the Celtics roster should perform better every season, but they do worse year on year.  I also think that the way Tatum plays, he makes the players around him worse, like the opposite of the CP3 effect. Like for example, Evan Fornier joins the team and goes from scoing 19ppg to 13ppg despite the fact his shooting percentages went up. On the flip side, Thies had the opposite effect, he moved to the Bulls and his PPG went up, despite his 2pt% staying the same and his 3pt% going down... Look at everyone else who joined this team? Tristan Thompson went from 12ppg to 7ppg, Kemba went from 26ppg to 19ppg. Who could forget scary Terry? MF went from 9ppg to 20ppg. No player has joined this team and gotten better and all of them who left suddenly improved and everyone acts like it's a God damn mystery. Everyone just forgot the fact Rozier got a massive pay day? Dude looked great, but just never got his chance, and guess what he balled out when he was given the chance. If it wasn't predictable why did the Hornets pay him so much and let Kemba walk?   As Tatum's usage rate goes from 10% to 30%, the Celtics go from a Win % of 70% to 50%... Despite what everyone expected was to be the Celtics getting stronger every season due to their high draft stock and already strong roster with guys like Brown, Smart, Irving/Walker, while the team had Hayward on the roster taking the bulk of the salary space AND being out with injury.  He's a great player, with great potential, but his game has major floors which need to be fixed. He's an above average player, on an okay team. But jesus people suck him off like he's in MVP contention despite only going 36-36 with a very decent surrounding cast.   Like if you said to me 2 years ago, there will be a team with: Kemba Walker, Marcus Smart, an All NBA calibur player, Jaylen Brown, Tristan Thompson starting and a bench of Fornier, Teague,  Parker, Williams and Thies, I'd say holy shit that's a top 4 team. But no just 7th in the East, 36-36 record. What?"
"If you factor in defense, not even top 25. If you factor in availability, maybe even worse than that.  I understand what people say about his skills, like how Durant admires his ball handling and offensive talent, but I don't really think he's well-rounded enough to be considered better than someone like Jrue Holliday or Jaylen Brown"
"you were just complaining about how ben simmons wasnt committed to getting better. so the fact that you are completely willing to ignore anthony edwards being completely unchanged during the time that hes supposed to be undergoing the most amount of mental development is pretty telling to how much youre committed to understanding the situation  and youre acting like ants decision making isnt a *weakness* when it really is. most all-nba players, even when they are 19, are not as bad as ant is. and the only reason it looked like he was a better decision maker down the stretch of the season is because of how god damn easy it is for him to capitalize on his gravity (which is why its so frustrating that he isnt better). he can make the simplest of reads and make things happen, similar to zach lavine, but the value these have is limited and until he can prove that he can do more than just swing the ball when defenses start to commit (which he hasnt really)   i know that its popular to hate on ben simmons, which is why you do, but it kills me inside whenever people try to pretend like they know so much when they absolutely do not. i know that you guys lack some pretty fundamental knowledge, but just come on, use your brains, ben simmons has made 3 consecutive all star teams and the only reason he wouldnt make another is because of the public perception of him, not that his impact is lacking. you know this and still maintain that a guy whos realisitc ceiling is as a all-star completely eclipses his value  honestly, give me an example of a person going from being an absolutely awful to good decision maker? the only one i can think of is jaylen brown, and i *know* that jaylen brown works 10x harder than anthont edwards does"
Who on earth is downvoting this lmao. Do y‚Äôall think Simmons/Thybulle are more valuable than Jaylen Brown? Do y‚Äôall watch basketball?
I‚Äôll take pascal Siakam or Jaylen brown over those 2 turds
Jaylen Brown üíØ
Jaylen Brown
"So obviously there's the top 10, and in the next group of players I like over Beal you have Gobert, KAT, Zion, Tatum, PG, CP3. That's 16 players.  Then you have a bunch of guys who I think are in the same tier as Beal with Mitchell, Booker, Jaylen Brown, SGA, LaVine, Trae, Irving, Middleton, Murray, Butler, Fox, SGA. SOMEONE in that group has to be last. So I have Beal somewhere between the late teens and late twenties."
"Jaylen and Hayward were near all star level that next year, while Lonzo was an average starter and Josh Hart was an average role player. Plus 1 of Brown or Hayward would‚Äôve provided more scoring than Lonzo or Josh Hart."
I don't understand how people still think Jaylen Brown is better that Zach Lavine
There's really no evidence that he's vaccinated. He also said many of his family members aren't vaccinated and that he respects it's a personal choice. Where is this alleged quote that he was urging family or anyone to get vaccinated?  https://www.clnsmedia.com/jaylen-brown-covid-19-diagnosis-raises-questions-about-personal-vs-public-concerns/
He looks like an older Jaylen Brown lol.
"04 - D Wade &amp; LeBron coughing making fun of Dirk during the Heat/Mavs finals because Dirk was coming down with the flu.  06 - Russ not letting Steven answer a question from a local OKC beat reporter and constantly saying 'next question.'  13 - D Wade hits ridiculous game winning shot in last season with Heat.  15 - Westbrook/Durant cupcake debacle.  17 - Donovan Mitchell made a really funny video during the bubble about Jaylen Brown.  20 - Ball goes out of play in D Wade's final game and Melo pretends to shoot it in from the sidelines. He wasn't on a team at this point. Him, LeBron &amp; Chris Paul were all side of court watching it.  21 - How do you, as a RAPS FAN, not know this one? We went to town on the Celtics and the camera panned to Kyrie thinking 'I'm getting the fuck out of here.'"
Also remember Jaylen Brown isn't vaccinated.
Mikal Bridges comes to mind. Jaylen Brown has some great cuts as well
There is no justification for this opinion though. Jaylen Brown is better at every single aspect of Basketball offensively
Welp. I wore a Jaylen Brown shirt today. Remind me not to do that for awhile
About to get downvoted to oblivion but Siakam &gt; Jaylen Brown
No I‚Äôm all over this thread saying Jaylen Brown isn‚Äôt the intellectual he‚Äôs plays himself out to be.
"Yeah, how the fuck does that guy actually think that the Celtics would've been even competitive with the Warriors, what the actual fuck. Jaylen Brown was in his 2nd year averaging 14 a game and Tatum was a rookie, they had no shot to match Golden State's offensive firepower nor they had the personnel to defend them.  They would've beaten the Cavs, only to get beaten in five by the Warriors. The 2017 Cavs were a much better team than the healthy 2018 Celtics and they had no chance."
"That's a gross misunderstanding and usage of the word Union. The players represent the players, not the team. Jaylen Brown is not the president, he's one of six vice-presidents (seven if you include the first vice).   I cannot speak to your article as it is behind a paywall.  As well to your comments about THINK450, is the marketing and licensing arm of the Union and is owned by the Union. So no, that does not count as a political platform."
"to be anti-vax is just to be opposed to vaccination. You can opposed to many things and still do them.  I'm not sure what your point is to continue to argue with me. A few players have expressed they didn't want to get vaccinated, did because of their jobs, and continue to speak out against it.  As well, back to the topic of this string in the thread, Jaylen Brown represents the entire NBA. He has to advocate for all of their beliefs, whether he likes it or not."
There is no confirmation that Brown is vaccinated. A lot of people think he is because of a misreported tweet from a local bear writer that got corrected.  He danced around the question on media days. The team also specified Udoka was a breakthrough case when he tested positive - but has not done the same for Brown. He is reportedly asymptomatic as well which begs the question as to whether he was a part of the routine testing faced by unvaxxed players.  Jaylen is one of my all time favorite Celtics and I hate to say it but I would be surprised if he is vaxxed at this point.
Is Jaylen Brown anti vaxx?
Jaylen Brown sock account detected
"&gt;Jaylen Brown tested positive for COVID-19 today, per the Celtics. Team says he is asymptomatic and quarantining.  Bad timing but at least he's asymptomatic"
"BR: JT thinks Jaylen‚Äôs barber is trash, Celtics will look to move Jaylen Brown immediately. Here‚Äôs 5 trades for Ben Simmons"
"Jaylen brown is not untouchable if another star is available and he hasn‚Äôt been listed.  You don‚Äôt leave many options excluding all these guys lol.  Bkn, mil, Mia, den and the la teams aren‚Äôt breaking it up anytime soon.  Steph isn‚Äôt ever leaving GS imo and Dallas and Atlanta aren‚Äôt trading luka and trae"
don't let this video distract you from the fact that in 1998 jaylen brown threw jayson tatum off hell in a cell and plummeted 16 feet through an announcers table
"Very on-brand of Jaylen Brown to just casually drop ""dichotomizing"" in conversation like that while being entirely relatable and not coming off like he's just trying to sound smart. And even more impressive because it really is a perfect verb for describing the way sports writers and fans ask these questions."
"In hindsight, if the result of the Celtics rebuild which started with the Brooklyn Nets trade is Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, is that a huge L?"

"just for me, and ignoring the cavs, dame/steph, and the rookies (since they haven't played yet)   - for the east; jaylen brown, harden, the rose in the garden, vanvleet, derozan, Middleton, giannis, lamelo   - in the west; edwards, towns, SGA, cj, Mitchell, draymond (yes, watching draymond orchestrate/play D is really enjoyable), klay if he comes back, Westbrook, fox, haliburton, luka, kpj, ja, dejounte Murray   - i omitted a lot of bigs, so after looking back at the roster i'd say I'm also looking forward to watching embiid, sabonis, bam, mafuzzy chef, porzingis and adams"
"&gt;Check his teams' on-off, he's not a consistent positive!  Umm but he is, even on Boston: https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/1745/onoff#tab-team_efficiency  &gt;check post game interviews from Boston's playoffs, he gets selfish in the clutch and his skill in the clutch isn't great.  Every player on those Celtics teams besides Jaylen Brown has cited Kyrie as a positive influence, especially Tatum and Smart. I'm not saying Kyrie is some chemistry glue guy out here, but he's only detrimental off the court, not on it."
"Draymond is a great current up and comer, intelligent vet with an eye for the game and already involved in broadcasting. CP3 I think will want to stay involved in the league and has imparted knowledge to a lot of nba prospects. He may take more of that kobe mentor role and not broadcast however  Extrapolating out into the future there‚Äôs some young ones that will fun to see become vets who are very social and study the game a lot; Donovan Mitchell and Jaylen Brown are some amazing and bright personalities who study the game hard, are good public speakers I think would be cool to provide opinions and analysis when they‚Äôre older"
"In no particular order:    1. Lebron James   2. Steph Curry   3. Kevin Durant   4. James Harden   5. Kawhi Leonard   6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Anthony Davis   8. Nikola Jokic   9. Joel Embiid   10. Luka Doncic   11. Jayson Tatum   12. Bradley Beal   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Kyrie Irving   15. Bam Adebayo   16. Zion Williamson   17. Paul George   18. Chris Paul   19. Devin Booker   20. Damian Lillard   21. Donovan Mitchell   22. Zach Lavine   23. Trae Young   24. Nikola Vucevic   25. Jaylen Brown   26. Domantas Sobonis   27. Klay Thompson   28. Draymond Green   29. Khris Middelton   30. Russel Westbrook   These are the guys I can think of that I would say have an argument over Gobert right now.  As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."
"PG: Jalen Suggs  SG: Jalen Green  SF: Jaylen Brown  PF: Jalen McDaniels  C: Jalen Smith  For current players, ain't half bad"
It is less than a year since he won finals mvp and was a top 2 mvp candidate until he got hurt last year. He probably thinks Jaylen Brown is better than LeBron at this point
"&gt;I'm genuinely curious. Are you under the impression that shooting 29.7% from 5-9 feet and doing that at high volume is good?  He shot 40%. You‚Äôre looking at 10-14 feet. Either way the point here is that you were talking  out of your ass.   &gt;Literally the only player shooting a higher volume at a lower percentage is Andre Drummond. Most of the players shooting higher volumes are in the 40s and 50s of percentage. I mean, thanks for proving my point that Ben Simmons can't fucking shoot outside the restricted area, but, like... I did already know.  Before being a dick you should at least double check your info. Instead of just acknowledging you were wrong about him shooting in the paint you decided to triple down and pretend he shot only 30%.   His % from 5-9 is comparable to Jaylen Brown, Sabonis, Embiid to name a few."
Jayson Tatum underrated  Jaylen Brown overrated
So is Jaylen Brown
I really hope someone carries Kareem's torch when he's gone. I could see Jaylen Brown possibly doing it but it's kinda wild that the only NBA player that's really loose with his political statements has been retired 30+ years. Major respect that he's managed to stay active so long.

Didn't Jaylen Brown ask for the Celtics to make sure the new coach was black?  I mean it worked out for the best because Udoka seems like a great hire but that's straight-up prejudice on Brown's part.
Jaylen is an *actual* intellectual. He was taking masters classes at CAL his freshman year before the NBA.  Jaylen Brown is more than likely top-5 in intelligence for the NBA currently.  lmao
Did you want to add Jaylen Brown as well?
"I remember Jaylen Brown not really calling out Stephen and Desean Jackson and expressed some really weird and vague comments. I wouldnt really listen to Jaylen Brown. I would easily listen to KAJ, Barkley and Wade"
"Jaylen Brown, and Donovan Mitchel come to mind."
"Look at Jaylen brown. That‚Äôs a top 3 pick that was drafted to a team that hasn‚Äôt missed the playoffs since he got there. That winning environment hasn‚Äôt hindered his growth at all. He‚Äôs grinded and worked on his craft and look at him now- NBA all star.   Simmons was give way more talent and JB, put in a similar winning environment, and just lacks the growth. Shame on Ben really."
"Umm of his draft classmates, I'd take jaylen brown before him. There are arguments for siakam and Brandon Ingram as well"
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown like ü§î
"With everything we know today, I would for sure take Jaylen Brown over Simmons, Siakam and Jamal Murray are also 2 players I would think about taking over Simmons in that scenario."
3 way trade involving Jaylen Brown
"Well that's the situation the Sixers are in, yes. They drafted a 6'10 guy who can't shoot and for years ran him at PG without trying to change him into a useful player, and then gave him a max contract. Why? Why would you give max contract to a player you can't trade for another max contract? Celtics didn't give Jaylen Brown a max and the Sixers would have to package several first rounds with Ben just to make them think about that trade. So yeah, this is what the Sixers did themselves, is it not?"
Mikal hunter OG Og is very clearly just a role player I think hunter has the potential to be marcus smart+ mikal I think can be jaylen brown lite
"Top 15?  Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jimmy Butler, Jokic, KAT, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Chris Paul  These are all players I would rather have. Honorable mentions (aka: players I would still rather have, but aren't as good as the above) - Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, Draymond Green, Pascal Siakam, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Zach Lavine, Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell."
Jaylen Brown
"No, I meant 225pounds Zion can‚Äôt average 24ppg without a jumper. Jaylen Brown couldn‚Äôt score efficiently in his first two seasons. He could attack the rim but without a jumper defender stays near the basket."
"I‚Äôd like to contest this claim actually; not just because of the Siakam thing either.  Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, and Pascal Siakam have all enjoyed far more team success than the Sixers, all three of these teams have made conf finals. Ben Simmons has never led the Sixers to beat a team that was even good, stuck in the second round, and consistently is at the core of their issues. Sure, he made the all-star game a few times and is a defensive juggernaut, but all three of these other guys have displayed just as much all around talent I‚Äôd argue, and they‚Äôve all been able to bring it when it mattered the most.   Ingram is ehh to me tho"
While debatable I think Ben Simmons is the best player from that draft class. (Although personally i prefer jaylen brown)
Jaylen browns extension was *not* worth it at the time.  Every boston fan stated that they have no choice and that he could become a player worth it.  We can all go back and laugh at the doubters but Jaylen Brown was not even close to the player Ayton is now
"I hate to put ceilings on players who have legitimately improved every year since entering the league, like a Jaylen Brown"
"Jaylen Brown‚Äôs 3rd season was better? Off the bench for the C‚Äôs with 3 Win Shares for the season over the starting center and defensive anchor of a Finals team?  Jaylen Brown is good and has continued getting better, but you are nuts if you think Jaylen‚Äôs 3rd year was better."
People act likes he‚Äôs on Mitchell or tatums level. Jaylen brown had a better 3rd season and didn‚Äôt get the max
&gt;  A rookie max extension is given to basically anyone with all-star potential nowadays.  I think the John Collins and Jarrett Allen deals gives the Suns some leverage. High level shot creators get paid.  But a lot of other guys on the level of Jaylen Brown and Domantas Sabonis did not get maxed.
Dude of course.  Do ppl not realize Jaylen Brown was a 25ppg scorer last season?   In what way could Lavine‚Äôs advantage on offense outweigh the gap on defense?
"I do think they can be a 10 top defense but I really question Boston‚Äôs offense. Schroeder, Smart and Richardson will be the options after Jaylen and Tatum and all of them shoot below league average. I can see a lot of nights were Tatum and Brown score 30 and the Cs still lose due to everyone else assing it up. Historically having a good offense with a average defense works out better than the other way around."
Kyrie Irving and Buddy Hield were both born in 1992. Hield is also older than AD and Beal   Also Brandon Clarke is older than Jaylen Brown
"If you are going to be an off ball player who is on a max deal, the guys I‚Äôd be ok with are: Klay, Jaylen Brown, Draymond, khris (who plays on ball a lot), mpj.  Outside of draymond all of those guys can shoot lights out, and all except for brown and draymond are all-time great (or future all time great shooters).   Draymond is a better screener and makes faster reads on touch passes.   Ben can‚Äôt have Aaron Gordon‚Äôs role on offense while getting a max"
"He's definitely overrated. I'm not saying he was a bad GM, but all he did was tank more aggressively than any team before, yet Philly fans act like he invented the lightbulb or something. I've had people claim to me that if Hinkie was the GM, they would've taken Jaylen Brown over Simmons and Tatum over Fultz, and won the last few championships."
"Jaylen Brown spent one year at Cal? That isn't useful in any way shape or form. If he went back he'd likely have to start over with a new curriculum. Regardless, it's not a quarter of the time you  need to spend in topic-specific study to understand those experiments. Completing the first year of literally any degree is simply not enough.   I have a bachelor's degree and I know if I tried to understand the vaccination studies I would be grasping at straws."
"To be fair, there are still guys in the league who took full advantage of College to actually learn.   Off the top of my head, Matisse Thybulle and Jaylen Brown based on what they‚Äôve said about their college both actually have a shit about school."
Vegas favorite would have too be:  Chris Paul  Steph  Bron  Jimmy Butler  Jaylen Brown?
Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown
"Big named centers not named Anthony Davis(Jokic, Kat, Embiid, Bam), Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal, Westbrook, and CJ McCollum  Center position is just a valuable position anymore. The rest are just players I don't think do well in playoff series on a championship team."
"Yeah, and those same people would tell you Jaylen Brown is an elite defender. If you're great on-ball and have a good reputation, all the eye test people will call you a great defender."
"Saric is a good player, can start or be 6th man on a championship team imo. Okafor was in talks for the Jaylen Brown Nets pick in the 2015 season right before Hinkie got usurped by the league so he was trying to MCW him at his highest value."
‚ÄúJaylen Brown‚Äù  Lmao flair checks out.
"Klay's defense is pretty overrated. He's on the Jaylen Brown spectrum of being really good on-ball but pretty mediocre overall.   2013-14 was the only year he had a positive D-LEBRON, and he's never recorded a defensive RAPTOR over 1.   Obviously, he's still a significant defensive upgrade over Kyrie, but I definitely value Kyrie's self-creation over the defensive gap."
Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  These dudes are about to regress hard.
"&gt;kinda unnecessarily degrading to almost everyone in the league,   What are you talking about? He isn't saying that some of them aren't smart/knowledgeable. His issue is that they \*all\* think they are smart/knowledgeable when a ton of them clearly aren't.  Saying that a group of people *as a whole* thinks they are way fucking smarter than they really are isn't ""degrading"" to individuals in that group that actually *are* smart.  &gt;...should we say this anytime Jaylen Brown speaks up too...  Did OP suggest that we should do this ***""anytime""*** someone speaks up?   OP made his/her response in the context of Kuzma saying some dumb-ass shit. ***If Brown says something that is similarly dumb as shit,*** then yeah, dragging him for not being as smart as he thinks he is seems pretty reasonable. That doesn't mean it makes sense to do it ""anytime"" he speaks up."
That would be highway robbery if Portland snatch‚Äôs Brown for CJ. I like CJ but Jaylen is special and only growing
Jaylen brown and John Wall janitor now? Kool
"Personally, I think a perfect trade is a CJ and Covington for Jaylen Brown and salary filler trade. It works for both teams.   Boston would have a starting lineup of CJ, Smart, Tatum, Covington, Horford with Schroeder, Richardson, Kanter bench.  Portland would have a starting lineup of Lillard, Powell, Brown, Nance, Nurkic, but the bench of Simons, Snell, Little, Zeller would be weak and in need of a backup pg that can handle the ball in Lillards absence."
"kinda unnecessarily degrading to almost everyone in the league, should we say this anytime Jaylen Brown speaks up too because he doesnt have a college degree? just cause what Kuzma saying is dumb doesnt mean we should assume these guys can't have a good idea because they didnt go to college"
I‚Äôm very high on jaylen brown lol
Idk doesn‚Äôt Jaylen Brown do at least some activism and legitimate donations. There‚Äôs no evidence that Lebron even donates to his foundation. MJ never donated shit until really recently and idk if Kanye has either.
Jaylen brown goat
jaylen brown coming
Jaylen Brown good
"I mean there are a lot of athletes that are great role models like Bill Russell, Jaylen Brown, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, etc.  You just need to find the right guys."
What do you think Malcolm X would think about Jaylen Brown?
Imagine Jaylen Brown or  Jamal Murray next to Embiid
"PG. Terry Rozier SG. Jaylen Brown SF. OG Anunoby PF. Ben Simmons C. Myles Turner  PG. Rozier really excelled with the Hornets as a secondary ball handler. Really strong 3pt shooter and while he has a tendency to gamble on defense, should serve as a strong point of attack defender on opposing PGs.  SG. Jaylen is the secondary scorer here. Has shown to be a really strong 3pt shooter and has really developed his ability to handle the ball, but isn‚Äôt necessarily the kind of guy who needs to have the ball in his hands to be successful. Sus off-ball defense but certainly in the upper echelon of on-ball defenders.  SF. Love OG, he can slot into any team and be an asset. Really developing his 3pt shot and like Jaylen, in the upper echelon of wing defenders. Jaylen and OG on the wings is going to lock up opposing scorers.  PF. Simmons is really really the primary ball handler and facilitators but I‚Äôm slotting him at PF to make spacing work. In certain matchups he‚Äôs going to struggle to defend (thinking of teams with a legit PF like Randle or Domantas) but for the most part, teams are running a big wing at the 4. In those cases, Simmons defensive value will still be realized, and again, this is about putting a team of shooters around him.  C. Was thinking KAT but that would be a sus defense. Myles isn‚Äôt QUITE the 3pt shooter as KAT but I think he can anchor the defense better. He may struggle against true centers like Embiid, but again those are rarer occurrences. I‚Äôm trading off KAT‚Äôs better shooting for Myles‚Äô more balanced game and ability to anchor a team defense."
PG- Fox  SG- Lavine  SF- Jaylen Brown  PF- MPJ  C- Ben  I just think Ben would be best suited to play the 5 to hide his weaknesses. That surrounded by shooters would work very well IMO
21 and below sets this up extremely well.  PG- Ben  SG- Klay  SF-Jaylen Brown  PF- KAT  C- Gobert
Using SI's rankings which has Ben at 21:  PG Jamal Murray  SG Donovan Mitchell  SF Khris Middleton  PF Ben Simmons  C Zion Williamson  **Bench**  Russell Westbrook  Kyle Lowry  Trae Young  Jaylen Brown  Brandon Ingram  Nikola Vucevic  Kristaps Porzingis
Jaylen Brown.

Jaylen brown &gt; BI arguments
Stuff like this lmao:   https://www.sportscasting.com/jaylen-brown-is-so-smart-he-was-offered-a-nasa-internship-and-became-an-mit-fellow/?amp
"Damn Kwame Brown being better than Simmons is just wrong, but Jaylen Brown might have an argument"
"Celtics would‚Äôve never traded Tatum for AD, wasn‚Äôt the package centered around Jaylen Brown?"
"There is a 0% chance that the wolves would go ‚Äúyou know what, Joel is mad at Ben. We should only offer a first instead of a first and Beasley.‚Äù The Sixers hold Ben for 4 years. Until Joel demands the team trade Ben, Ben‚Äôs ‚Äúvalue‚Äù is his worth as a basketball player. As long as the sixers don‚Äôt have an imperative to sell, there‚Äôs no reason logically to trade Ben any earlier than the deadline or maybe even next offseason. Admittedly, by then the ticking clock on Embiid will force the sixers to sell and at that point they should cut their losses. But a star may request out by then, and that chance is worth burning this season as long as Embiid is okay with that. Of course, if Embiid says Ben has to go, then yeah the sixers will have to settle for whatever. Also, what packages would be better than the sixers‚Äô? Idk if the Celtics would give up jaylen brown or the nuggets MPJ and I don‚Äôt think teams like Houston or NO fit the timeline of a 30+ year old superstar. The sixers package could reasonably compete with anything"
"I always got the vibe that even though they seem like they would fit well and they have similar names, Jaylen and Jayson were never particularly close.   Honestly if Dame becomes available Boston could very well have the most tempting offer with Jaylen Brown and some draft consideration for Dame. Jaylen Brown is the perfect young star that a franchise would want to build with."
Gotta love jaylen brown üòÇ
og is like almost as good as jaylen brown
"Game 1, Knicks defense falling off is legit. Teams with two elite wing players are gonna torch us because Fournier has to guard one of them. Game 1 that was Jaylen Brown but it could also be Kd or Harden, Giannis or Middleton, for example."
"Jaylen Brown plays SG now, and I was considering Andrew Wiggins as well"
"Alright at least now I know you don‚Äôt bother knowing anything before talking.  OG had 1 turnover. Tatum had 1 block.   OG had 5 assists, led our team in free throws and just shut down Jaylen Brown embarrassingly.   I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôve never played basketball before because of your reason is simply Boston sucks, you don‚Äôt understand the game."
Jaylen brown is either sink or swim when he‚Äôs shooting holy shit lol
"right around jaylen brown, a defensive stopper too"
This the same Jaylen Brown that went crazy on the Knicks?
"Definitely is a troll account. They're known by most Celtic fans on this sub.   They get karma by shitting on Boston for easy upvotes and because they're always very quick to celebrate the Toronto Raptors as the best run franchise in the East there's always a steady flow of upvotes by gullible Toronto fans.  There was a point where they were arguing Jaylen Brown was one of the worst players in the NBA.  &gt;* Would trade Jaylen Brown for him. Powell is incredible.  &gt;* Norman Powell deserved All-Star selection over Jaylen Brown. The Raptors are incredible at developing players, arguably the best in the league.  &gt;* I'd trade Jaylen Brown and a decade's worth of first round picks and swaps for [Ayton]. He'd be an amazing fit next to Tatum instead of a black hole.  &gt;* Helps that Jaylen Brown was a traffic cone on defense.  &gt;* Green teamers have been working overtime trashing Tatum and Brown's supporting cast because no one wants to admit that Tatum and Brown (especially Brown) are just not that good.  &gt;* Would rather have Powell than Jaylen Brown.  &gt;* Brown is one of the worst defenders in the NBA right now because he doesn't know how to play off-ball defense. Tatum is still far and away the better player.  &gt;* Jaylen Brown for Norman Powell, God please!  &gt;* Boston lost to Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson because Spoelstra is so much better than Brad Stevens and Jaylen Brown was and still is the worst defender in the NBA. Credit to the Heat but Tatum deserved better from his team, we shouldn't have lost that series.  &gt;* Harden will make Ainge pay for not trading Jaylen Brown for him. The greatest offensive player in the history of the league was literally available and Ainge refused to trade him for Jaylen Brown, the most overrated player in the NBA.  &gt;* Brown did not deserve his All-Star selection. His defense is massively overrated considering how often he lets players cut around him, and his offense has been slumping for a month.  &gt;* [Randle's] better than Tatum and Brown combined. I'm insanely jealous of New York's future, especially considering RJ is already way better than Brown.  &gt;* The biggest problem is that Tatum and Brown are simply not good enough, especially Brown.  &gt;* Tatum, Brown, and Brad Stevens are embarrassments to the Celtics franchise.    Are you starting to see a theme here?  Because I could go on..."
"Didn‚Äôt watch the game. But just looking at the stat sheet and I‚Äôm super stumped. How do you play 29 minutes and put up a donut??? Also, Jaylen Brown being that off is just confusing."
Jaylen Brown: I'm making a team...
"tatum + jaylen brown combined = 27 points  scottie barnes, rookie of the year frontrunner = 25 points"
You are a troll. You have literally said many times that ‚ÄúJaylen Brown is the worst player in the league‚Äù shut the fuck up
Jaylen Brown shooting slump go brrr  OG Anunoby shooting slump go BRRRRRRR
Best player out there in a game with Jaylen Brown and Tatum on the court.
Ah the Jaylen Brown off-season special
No one would care too much about Jaylen Brown. And since I don‚Äôt see Lebron playing at 41 I‚Äôd say Tatum would still get some hate but not even half as much as Lebron/KD.
"Bro, this, and when Jaylen Brown missed the dunk in OT.  Thought for a moment we had it in the bag‚Ä¶ then tragedy."

Y‚Äôall definitely showed out against the Celtics the other night. If it wasn‚Äôt for Jaylen Brown having a career night it wouldn‚Äôt have been anywhere close.
"2001: Pau Gasol (3rd)  2002: Yao Ming (1st)  2003: LeBron James (1st), Carmelo Anthony (3rd)  2004: Dwight Howard (1st)  2005: Deron Williams (3rd)  2006: LaMarcus Aldridge (2nd)  2007: Kevin Durant (2nd)  2008: Derrick Rose (1st)  2009: Blake Griffin (1st), James Harden (3rd)  2010: John Wall (1st)  2011: Kyrie Irving (1st)  2012: Anthony Davis (1st), Bradley Beal (3rd)  2013: nil  2014: Joel Embiid (3rd)  2015: Karl-Anthony Towns (1st)  2016: Ben Simmons (1st), Brandon Ingram (2nd), Jaylen Brown (3rd)  2017: Jayson Tatum (3rd)  2018: Luka Doncic (3rd)  2019: Ja Morant (2nd)  You could argue that some of these players aren‚Äôt ‚Äúsuperstars‚Äù but everyone I‚Äôve listed is all-star calibre. Now you might be correct in that the top 3 in a draft does usually have a bust, but your claim that top picks don‚Äôt result in superstars is flat out wrong."
jaylen brown
"Ok I thought I was the only one. I was thinking of making a post. A lotta lottery picks really struggled too even for rookie debuts too.   Some non rookies and their fg numbers in their opening games:   Steph against the lakers: 5/21 FVV: 5/20 OG Anunoby: 3/17 Tatum: 7/30 Lauri: 4/14 JJJ: 3/12 Valanciunas: 3/19 (2/16 from 2, how does a huge 7 footer miss 14 shots from 2? Only 2fts too) Cole Anthony: 3/12 Mike Conley: 4/12 D Book: 3/15 Dame: 8/24 (0/9 from 3, missed the potentially game tying shot) K Midd: 4/14 Kristaps: 4/14 Finney-Smith: 2/12  Some rookie debuts: Jalen Suggs: 3/14, 1 assist, 3 TOs Jalen Green: 4/14 Scottie Barnes: 5/13, 1 assist, 6 TOs  Not so critical of the rooks cause they‚Äôre rooks but it did seem like a lotta people put up stinkers. Obviously some great performances like from Bron and Jaylen Brown but seems like more bad ones than is normal."
It's a pretty mediocre draft but I think it goes -  1. Jaylen Brown 2. Jamal Murray 3. Ben Simmons 4. Siakam 5. Ingram  With Dejonte and Sabonis right there
"I‚Äôd hardly call him boring. He‚Äôs highly intelligent, plays smart basketball and has improved a ton defensively.   Mostly he‚Äôs up there with Jaylen Brown in terms of leadership not just for his own team but for the league making a positive, non self-benefitting impact on society."
"No, he's just a notorious Jaylen Brown hater. A bunch of people recognize his name on this sub."
0 chance the Celtics would make a package with jaylen brown. I don‚Äôt know why you would want Bam over Simmons lol.
"Because Jaylen Brown, Bam, and their other players are better than what Sixers have to offer"
Just gonna completely ignore that Jaylen Brown had a career game that he doesn‚Äôt normally have that completely made up for Tatum‚Äôs shit game huh  Stay mad
Dlo Mitchell Jaylen brown Towns Gobert
Worked out better than drafting Bum Simmons over Jaylen ‚ÄúMichael Jordan‚Äù Brown
"Ignoring this saga completely, suppose you did a 2016 redraftables...just based on on-court stuff.   Even then, I don't think he's #1 anymore, is he?   I think you'd still take him over Brogdon, at least due to age. I'm not totally convinced he's a better player than Dejounte Murray. DJ has shown more development, and is nearly the same class of defender. I'm not totally convinced he's a better player than Sabonis. I think he's *clearly* behind Jaylen Brown. What about Ingram? Siakam? Jamal Murray? I think he's better, but not by much. You can talk yourself into ""Ben Simmons is not a top-5 guy from his draft class."""
"Jaylen also had poor handles when he got into the league, he's worked his ass off and improved them significantly in recent years. No reason to think RJ can't improve his even if he doesn't improve as much as Brown."
"I mean if RJ can develop into 80% of the player jaylen brown is that would be a big win, jaylen is a rare talent"
"Is Jaylen Brown the devil? That dude could NOT miss until the end of the game when he has 0 energy left.    Mitch was a beast, but there were points last night where I was really missing Noel. Mitch is gonna need a few weeks to get his conditioning right while letting all of that muscle he added stick. With Gibson out, we did get a nice run of the Obi/Randle frontcourt, which found great success. I do think in a game like this Noel would have been very helpful.   Celtics fans were right about Kemba's defense, but I didn't expect to get so frustrated with having a guard so small get blocked constantly. Our backups are very good, so it's not too bad. I just have to keep telling myself that as long as he's not Elfrid Payton, we stay winning."
RJ hitting that highly contested 3 with (I think) Jaylen Brown in his face was huge. RJ wasn't taking 3's like that last year. Most were wide open. If he's now stepping into them with little space confidently and hitting....oh boy
No Jaylen Brown? smh
Seeing Schr√∂der blow layups and open 3s and not on the Lakers was great.   Tatum wasted that Jaylen Brown performance.   What a game.
covid considered Jaylen Brown
"Me last night: NOOO, NOT THIS GUY. Fucking Jaylen Brown, man."
"Barrett did a good job for sure but I think Tatum had more of an off night. He definitely had open looks to get his, they just weren't falling. Either way Jaylen Brown MORE than made up for it so it's hard to say that if both were playing normal, knicks still don't win here.      Best game i've seen in a while. makes me really excited for the knicks this year."
"so far i'm loving this boston team. sure, tatum had a bad night, but jaylen brown had another super efficient 40 point game and schroeder looks like a great fit."
"what an insane game, great opener.   Jaylen Brown is the leader of these Celtics. So damn good at what he does! And Randle's back after that weird PO sequence. Also, props to Big Block Bob."

But ppl look at me crazy when I say Jaylen brown&gt;Tatum
Feel like Jaylen Brown gets 40 odd points every other game
Unbiased NBA Top 5  1. Giannis  2. Lonzo Ball  3. Alex Caruso  4. Jaylen Brown  5. PJ Tucker
Down-town Jaylen Brown!!
Jaylen Brown is coming
"They go back and forth, Jaylen has been my favorite for a while, but honestly I 100% think they‚Äôre on the same level. I feel like JT is more smooth and instinctual whereas JB is more cerebral in his approach to the game. I do think Tatum has a higher ceiling but I like watching Brown way more though."
Holy shit Jaylen Brown is averaging 46 points per game
Jaylen Brown could go for mvp
"Jaylen Brown, Dwayne Wade with a 3 ball, and more explosive less playmaking Harden, I‚Äôd say are the ceiling for him. Or just Michael Jordan."
Jaylen Brown was playing in God mode
"I know my downstairs neighbors hate my guts rn b/c I was screaming from the last few minutes of the 4th to the end of 2OT üòÇ GG Celtics though, Jaylen Brown is INSANE"
"Jaylen Brown is gonna be a perennial all-star, I just know it"
"celtics are my number two. literally tuned out of spurs handing the magic an L to fully focus on these celts. jaylen brown, man‚Ä¶"
But have you considered Jaylen Brown
Boston needs to get Jaylen Brown help
Great game. Jesus lord is Jaylen Brown terrifying
Jaylen Brown was fucking unguardable and unconscious today.  JFC.
Jaylen Brown is a good basketball player.
"Fournier is worth that money EASY   I‚Äôm gonna see Jaylen Brown in my nightmares   Entertaining as hell game. Turned into a fiesta at the end of regulation, but both OTs were amazing."
"Even though the Celtics lost, I'm sorry for ever thinking Jaylen Brown was overrated"
That game was so fucking insane. I feel so sorry for Jaylen Brown but shoutout to Evan Fournier for being the first Knick to score 30+ in their team debut.
Jaylen Brown does not deserve to be the loser of this game
Jaylen Brown is the best Celtic in history
He saw Jaylen Brown star shine bright so Jayson Tatum made it his mission to ruin JB career night
 Tatum needs to be fined or something for ruining that jaylen brown performance
It's very rare I'm nice to Boston but Great fucking game Boston. Jaylen Brown is the truth
Jayson Tatum hates Jaylen Brown
Feeling bad for Jaylen Brown rn
I feel so bad for Jaylen Brown right now
Jayson Tatum doesn't want Jaylen Brown to shine. He has ruined Jaylen Brown career night deliberately.
Jaysom Tatum yikes. Jaylen Brown is the best player on the Celtics don't @ me
give the ball to Jaylen Brown not Tatum
Ah yes. Now the perfect set up for another Fournier 3 and a jaylen brown layup and then both teams miss until 3OT
Jaylen Brown is way better than Gobert and Bam.
Imagine saying Gobert is better than Jaylen Brown.
Is there a more prestigious award than MVP that Jaylen Brown can get this year?  I don't want to insult him with such a pedestrian award.
Jaylen Brown is taking a brown on the Knicks
goddamn jaylen brown
JAYLEN BROWN WTF
Jaylen Brown is better than Jayson Tatum
Jaylen brown gotta leave lmao Tatum clearly doesn‚Äôt respect him at all
"This is the year that Jaylen Brown takes a step forward, then he and Tatum have friction over who the leader of the team is until eventually Tatum is traded to Miami."
I don't know how you don't go for a Jaylen Brown iso there
Jaylen Brown needs his own team. Tatum shouldn't have gotten the ball at all.
Jaylen Brown looks incredible tonight.
I wonder what Jaylen Brown would have to put up to get MIP.  30-8-8 might do it.
Jaylen Brown holy shit
Jaylen brown is a legend
If healthy Jaylen Brown will have better season than Tatum.
5 more minutes of Jaylen Brown.  LET'S GO
Jaylen ‚ÄúSteph Curry‚Äù Brown
This game is Jaylen Brown and Kemba Walker vs the Knicks
LOOOOOOL JAYLEN BROWN
HOLY JAYLEN BROWN
Dude what the fuck is Jaylen brown
JAYLEN BROWN HOLY SHIT
Jaylen brown said he‚Äôs not losing tonight
Ben Simmons TS% average over last 3 years: 58.93%  Jaylen Brown TS% average over last 3 years: 59.07%
"Brown has a slightly higher TS% in the playoffs, but the majority of his shots were assisted. Tatum was a creator who had to make his own shots, it's not the same type of efficiency. Brown is great in the playoffs, don't get me wrong, I love the guy. But he's not at Tatum's level.   They've played in the playoffs together 3 years.  In 2017-18 (19 games), Tatum had more PPG, APG, SPG, BPG, a higher TS% on a lower usg%, more WS, WS/48, VORP, and a higher BPM. Brown had more RPG.  In 2018-19 (9 games), Tatum had more PPG, RPG, APG, SPG, BPG, and a higher BPM. Brown had a better TS% on a lower usg% and more WS and WS/48.  In 2019-20 (17 games), Tatum had more PPG, RPG, APG, BPG, and more WS, WS/48, VORP and a higher BPM. Brown had more SPG and a higher TS% on a lower usg%.  The one year Jaylen was arguably better was in the smallest sample size of the 3 and Tatum was the second option on that team while Jaylen was pretty much a catch and shoot guy. Tatum's pretty clearly performed better in the playoffs, I don't see how that's arguable."
"ok my simplistic response to this is that trading brown is taking away 20+ppg, but adding ben doesn't return that.  the other issue is that you're saying trade brown and get some first round picks to go with ben so that if ben sucks, we get some new players too. sounds great, but then you remember that out of every draft there's maybe 1 guy who becomes all nba, and 5-6 who become all stars. it's not easy to pick in the draft, so why would you pick someone new when you already have an all star player, who's also all-nba calibre? and even if you do draft someone who will turn into an all star level player, are they going to work with tatum? or is it going to be a new jaylen brown?  from my pov, it sounds like you're telling us to gamble a good player we have in hopes of getting a player who disappears and some draft picks that MIGHT turn into something"
"&gt;You say that so casually - Simmons is just a better defender, playmaker, and rebounder. So is better in three of the four major categories for a player‚Ä¶  He grabs one more rebound per game than Brown despite having a few inches on him, and any difference in playmaking is far too marginal to be relevant. I'd even argue that Brown is the better playmaker but whatever. Brown is also more of a complete player than Ben - and doesn't have a glaring, exploitable weakness.   &gt;If Simmons could knock down literally even 40% from open mid range shots his game could go to the next level.   And if my gran had balls, she'd be my gramps. This has been the same story every year for Ben, and there has been absolutely nothing to suggest it's any more likely now than before. If anything, his stubborness now shows he's not likely to improve on his shortcomings in basketball so you can stop spouting that hypothetical.   &gt;I‚Äôm not sure how it‚Äôs trolling to say Simmons is a better player. The accolades speak for themselves‚Ä¶  Nobody gives a fuck about rookie awards when talking who is the better player today, and they were both all-stars last season. Of course, that was before Ben's abysmal playoffs where he got played off the court, and it doesn't look like he is working to fix those issues.   That's why I said - you have to be trolling to think Jaylen is the worse player of the two. Or, equally likely, you watch little to no basketball and you just went ahead with a dumb take, in which case fair enough. Either way, thank fuck you don't work for Celtics."
Well don't slander Ben if there's any chance you could fleece them for Jaylen Brown lol
I would trade Jayson Tatum before Jaylen Brown.
You hear you might get Ben Simmons on the Celtics for Jaylen Brown.
He‚Äôs not. Jason Tatum looks unique. Jaylen brown look like just another basketball player.  This is a really terrible thing to say as for the reason Tatum is more popular but it‚Äôs true. He‚Äôs more marketable.
"Tatum game 20-28 (9 games) last year: 37 FG%, 28.6% from 3 on 20 shots a game. Ended up with a 57.6 TS% on the year.  Jaylen Brown game 26-34 (9 games) last year: 39.1 FG%, 29.5% from 3 on 17 shots a game. Ended up with a 58.6 TS% on the year.  Tatum's game is suffering because he's shooting way below his averages from the rim (especially the rim), 3, and the FT line - none of which have anything to do with the new rules. He's never relied on the ""Harden moves"" to get calls. The shots just aren't dropping. It's a bad stretch, it happens to everyone. Brown is looking very good yes. It's still only been 9 games."
They want Jaylen Brown? I think the fuck not.
This has to be bologna. What sane person would trade Jaylen Brown to a rival for a worse player with serious psychological needs?
This is a mistake Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum will lead this team to a title! ............ Who am I kidding üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
What? How do you guys say stuff like this so confidently lol.   Jaylen Brown is pretty one dimensional on offense. Tatum‚Äôs role is just bigger.
"You said that even with four 1sts it would be a fleece, so I'm giving examples of trades that gave more than that and pointing out that they're all for better players than Jaylen Brown.  I don't even mean specifically for the Sixers to trade for Brown, just in general trading more than four 1sts is a lot, only happens for really top guys.  Also, look at [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kdr528/charania_breaking_giannis_antetokounmpo_says_he/) thread from when Giannis re-signed with Milwaukee, or [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/jvn7u5/jrue_holiday_traded_to_the_bucks_for_eric_bledsoe/) from when Holiday was traded. Not really that important to this discussion, but I think any argument that trading for Jrue was not in large part to keep Giannis around is revisionist history. There were a lot of people worried that he might leave and teams were clearing up cap space to make a play for him."
You got to be some kind of stupid to trade Jaylen Brown for Ben Simmons.
"I'll take Jaylen Brown, four first round picks and your firstborn child in exchange thank you very much"
"&gt;Jaylen Brown can shoot and is willing to shoot, that alone makes him more valuable in the playoffs than Ben Simmons.   This is a little extreme, no? Or are you saying you'd rather have guys like Campazzo, Pat Connaughton, or Landry Shamet than Simmons?  &gt;I'm not sure how anyone who's watched Ben Simmons play in his past 3 playoff series can even say he's better than Brown.  This I'd agree with, there's really no argument at this point"
"Brown is on one of the best contracts in the NBA, if not the best. If Philly wants Jaylen for Ben it's going to have to be a monster package. Even then, I'm not sure I want it. I think Ben would pull a Kyrie."
Lol Celtics probably called up Sixers to ask the price on Simmons and they responded Jaylen Brown. Celtics then said k bye and hung up.
"Yeah, I don't think so. Nobody around Jaylen's stature has ever commanded that much. Off the top of my head the guys who have commanded a haul bigger than that are:  AD (and by proxy LeBron)  Harden  Holiday (and by proxy Giannis)  PG (and by proxy Kawhi)  &amp;#x200B;  I think AD commanded as much as he did first because he's AD, but also because LeBron needed the help in LA. The Bucks were worried about losing Giannis and therefore overspent on Holiday to keep Giannis around. The Clippers overspent on Paul George to make sure Kawhi would sign with them. There aren't many guys who command picks like that on their own, I really think it's just Harden. He obviously helps the Nets, but they didn't need him in the same way as those other situations.  &amp;#x200B;  AD/LeBron, Harden, Holiday/Giannis, and PG/Kawhi are all way better than Jaylen Brown, good as he may be."
Hopefully the effects aren't everlasting like it was for Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown is a top-25 player in the league.  Ben Simmons is borderline unplayable in the playoffs.  The Sixers would need to trade all their best players (not named Embiid) and some picks to even get the Celtics on the phone.
Isn't it that Jaylen Brown would have to be included from a salary cap perspective - rather than Morey asking for him?
"&gt;I mean Simmons does everything else better than Brown aside from shooting/scoring. No? Obviously that‚Äôs a big piece but not the only important piece. Simmons is still a rookie of the year, three time all star, 3rd team all NBA, and 2 time defensive first team NBA player‚Ä¶Brown has made what, one all star team? With the versatility Simmons offers on defense I think there‚Äôs a legitimate argument to made for him as thee the best defender in the league.  You're looking at it the wrong way. Other than defense (and transition playmaking, fine), Brown is better than Simmons everywhere else. More importantly, he is still growing as a player and improving, and has remarkable work ethic by all accounts. Ben has stagnated and is nowhere the hard worker that JB is.   &gt;Somebody is going to believe that they can coach Simmons up. He has the tools to be one of the best players in the league‚Ä¶if a coach can get him to knock down a mid range jump shot the way Rondo developed one, he would be incredibly value. Maybe the best PG in the league.   Is it 2018 again? Hasn't this take aged horribly by now? Dude's gonna be 26 at the end of this season that he is spending on the bench and hasn't improved that much for a few years but yeah sure, he is still one jumper away.   &gt;From strictly a basketball standpoint there‚Äôs no world where Simmons is not a better basketball player than Brown  This is painfully dumb and I don't even know how to address it properly. Good trolling though bro, spot on - guy who can't shoot or dunk is definitely the better basketball player. Strictly basketball standpoint.   &gt;I just think Stevens and the Celtics are one of a handful of teams who have the right sort of organizational pieces to help Simmons maximize his game.   Our chemistry sucks, we don't have leaders or a lot of veteran presence, and Stevens is not a great players person. You know and understand fuck all about the Celtics.   &gt;Like I said, the Celtics current team ain‚Äôt winning nothing  No argument there, but I can safely say for all Celtics fans that we would rather continue on our current path million times over than trade (or even consider trading) Jaylen for Ben."
"If they trade Jaylen Brown for Ben Simmons, Bill Simmons is going to have a fucking heart attack...  Could you imagine giving up Brown for Simmons."
"Not a Sixers fan, and I'd be careful talking about who's getting fleeced when your organization is about to trade Jaylen Brown for Ben Simmons."
I'd fire the entire Celtic FO if they moved Jaylen Brown in a Simmons trade.
"Jayson Tatum: 26.4/7.4/4.3 on 57.6 TS%, shooting 38.6% from 3 on mostly unassisted 3s. 6.5 WS, 3.7 BPM, 3.3 VORP. Better help defender. Much better playoff performances.  Jaylen Brown: 24.7/6.0/3.4 on 58.6 TS%, shooting 39.7% from on mostly assisted 3s. 4.8 WS, 2.5 BPM, 2.3 VORP. Better on ball defender.  Brown is great, but Tatum is inarguably better. A small sample size so far this year doesn't change that. Both are still franchise guys though."
I bought league pass this year to enjoy myself. Not to watch Ben Simmons brick every shot he takes. Jaylen Brown is straight ballin' this year. Not even remotely worth it. Gtfoh
"He's tasked with taking harder shots late in the shot clock and down the stretch, the scoring talent is pretty large, as Tatum had great footwork and handles since college while Brown needed to develop into being a really good secondary.  The defensive is also pretty large, Jaylen Brown is an awful team defender while Tatum's really good."
"Jaylen Brown can shoot and is willing to shoot, that alone makes him more valuable in the playoffs than Ben Simmons. This is before we take into account his defensive game and scoring ability.  I'm not sure how anyone who's watched Ben Simmons play in his past 3 playoff series can even say he's better than Brown."
Jaylen brown is never getting played off the floor in a playoff game because of ft shooting
"If it‚Äôs not dame then they could pull that trigger at any time. Didn‚Äôt Portland and Philly talk about a cj trade in the off season but Philly wanted too much ?  And if Portland decides to move dame, plenty of teams could outbid Philly.  What‚Äôs Philly‚Äôs best case scenerio package ? Thybulle Ben maxey and some 1sts? Okc has their 2025 1st barring protections, which means they can‚Äôt trade 2026 or 2024. So 1sts from 2023 and 2027 ig?  Golden state could package together 1sts from 2022 and 2026 along with moody, kuminga, poole and wiseman. 3 very young lotto picks bursting with potential and a young MIP front runner.   Boston could offer more picks around Jaylen brown, maybe toss in Robert Williams and Aaron Nesmith.   Knicks could package RJ Barrett, all the picks they have which is like all of their own and a few from other teams, and young guys like Toppin and quickly"
"Seriously...  I'm firmly in the ""this is bullshit leaked by Philly to try to get any value whatsoever out of worthless Ben Simmons"" camp. Celtics aren't shipping Jaylen Brown for anyone, let alone Ben fucking Simmons."
"Just to be clear, the Celtics held onto ""assets"" for years when they could have made title runs (or at least get to the Finals) with the right move(s,) but now are considering Jaylen Brown for Ben Simmons?  If Boston does that, it may literally be the dumbest trade to ever happen. Yeah, there's Kobe for Vlade and Kawhi for Georgie Hill, but those were at least draft-night trades. And let's not act like Kobe and Kawhi were guaranteed stars like LeBron and Duncan. Both Bryant and Leonard didn't get drafted until the teens."
"The only trade I can imagine is:  Celtics trade Jaylen &amp; Hermongomez  for  Simmons, Maxey, Thybulle, and a first.  Philly gets a really good foundational piece, and is back in the championship conversation. Not to mention, they give Embiid a running mate he can play with for many years to come. Hernangomez is salary filler, but maybe he fits. They give up three young players (and a first) though...  If the Celtics situation is worse than what they let on (like they see a Brown/Tatum dealing needing to happen before the summer), they get in front of it like with Deron &amp; the Jazz. Celtics get a really good player in Simmons, along with two strong young players who fit their system.    Assuming Simmons is a sunk cost right now, using him as a key piece in getting a young 2-way all-star that spreads the floor is probably worth it."
"More like    ‚ÄúHey y‚Äôall want Ben Simmons?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI'm listening‚Äù  ""We're interested in Jaylen Brown. ...Hello? Hello?‚Äù"
You guys can't seriously believe you're getting jaylen brown
"Jaylen has been called out by both his coach (for inconsistent effort) and teammate (for not passing) and the team's been struggling, having player only meetings etc...It wouldn't be totally shocking if Brown demanded a trade privately."
"Morey: Greetings Brad, I came  to inquire about a possible trade of sorts. We would grant you Ben Simmons and you would give us Jaylen Brown and some other trinkets.  Brad: Spits on the floor  Morey: Thank you for gift of your body moisture, I will let you ponder on this further  Morey on cellphone: Greetings Charania, I am anonymous source and I would like you to know that trade talk about Jaylen Brown for Ben Simmons are very fluid."
"&gt;You‚Äôd ‚Äúprobably‚Äù trade Simmons and some picks for Jaylen Brown?  Use the whole quote  ""I'd probably do that, depending on how much is included in addition to Simmons.""  Brown is a great player and I'd love to have to him, but there does need to be some walk away point. If it has to be all the picks and swaps we can offer plus some young guys in addition to Simmons, then yeah I might not do that. Most things short of that I'd *probably* do."
Jaylen Brown for Jaylen LightBrown
Hahaha right. Philly fans are done so Boston will surely welcome him with open arms..  Boston is trolling Philly keeping Simmons price up. 0.0 percent chance Jaylen Brown leaves the celts for Ben Simmons.
"So by your own post, Jaylen has generally better counting stats. About that:  CJ's big thing is the 3-pointer obviously - Jaylen has shot almost identical % from 3 (CJ @ 2% better over their careers, within 1% last few seasons). CJ's scoring is completely dependent on the 3 because he's a pretty poor finisher around the basket - over 10% worse than Jaylen career-wise.  I won't bother going into defensive stuff as it's not worth it - Jaylen is obviously the better defender. Jaylen is also over 5 years younger.  I LIKE CJ - he went to school right outside Philly. He's a nice player - you're right, he's likely a top 2-3 player on a lot of teams...Brown is the same, easily. To put it colloquial terms: CJ is a 30YO Robin. Jaylen is a 25YO potential Batman."
"You‚Äôd ‚Äúprobably‚Äù trade Simmons and some picks for Jaylen Brown? This is a straight up delusional take and blows my mind how many Sixers fans are acting like Jaylen isn‚Äôt valuable or that Simmons is all of the sudden an equivalent asset or even close to it.  Feel free to downvote, it‚Äôs legitimately delusional to think you guys are about to swap out your maxed out, refusing to play, can‚Äôt shoot and won‚Äôt even try point guard for Jaylen Brown."
I'll concede that Jaylen Brown would better than our Kevin Love centered package
And in turn just pisses Jaylen Brown off lol.
Why why why is Brown‚Äôs name always in trade talks. Tatum is not THAT much better than him especially with both their starts this season. Whether it‚Äôs here in Boston or the national media it is always Jaylen Brown being shopped. Guy is an all star and right up there with those who are a tier below superstar level.
"But the post is about Philly demanding Jaylen Brown. That's a significant difference in value compared to Barnes, Davion and a 1st - even including how amazing Barnes has been to start the season.  Plus I'm not sure Philly has full use for Mitchell, as they already have a great perimeter defender with offensive limitations.  Philly taking that offer would be a reduction in their ask. I think the discussion is about which GMs would be willing to meet the current price (ie, a 25yo All Star), rather than a possible future discounted price."
But Jaylen Brown has a hamstring injury. He may never be the same. /s  The timing is too convenient for Morey's offer.
"1. It‚Äôs Monday, so rather than talk about on court basketball the jock sniffing media needs a story. 2. When you need a story to fill time you can pick from the following: Lebron, Lakers, Kyrie, Ben Simmons, Celtics. 3. Morey asked for Tatum in exchange for Simmons in the offseason. 4. This is a red herring to drum up interest from other teams. 5. Jaylen Brown is better the Ben Simmons and has been for at least 2 but closer to 3 years. 6. Ben Simmons is never going to get better."
Marcus Smart is about to learn the hard way that criticizing Jaylen and Tatum is not a smart thing to do.   I am hoping the Celtics are not going to include Tatum and Brown in any Simmons trade. Smart + picks + something will be a good trade for them
"That's my point. No framework makes sense. Either the 76ers are making the Celtics better, or the Celtics are trading Jaylen Brown for pennies on the dollar..  As much as I'd love to get Ben to partner with the Jays, I just don't see PHI doing it. And the only way I'd move brown is for a bonafide All-NBA player. Simmons is good, but we'd need both Tatum and Brown to hide is deficiencies."
Feels like Jaylen Brown for Simmons+picks would be fair.
Definitely not without a doubt. Here are last year's stats:  Ben Simmons  -	**WS/48: 0.153** -	VORP: 2.2 -	ppg: 14.3 -	**rpg: 7.2** -	**apg: 6.9** -	**spg: 1.6** -	bpg: 0.6 (tie) -	tov: 3.4  Jaylen Brown  -	WS/48: 0.115 -	**VORP: 2.3** -	**ppg: 24.7** -	rpg: 6.0 -	apg: 3.4 -	spg: 1.2 -	bpg: 0.6 (tie) -	**tov: 2.7**
If we get Jaylen Brown for Simmons it'll be the heist of the century.
Hmm. If the Jaylen Brown deal falls through it sounds like you guys may be a good fit for a certain young socialite.
I like the trade.  While Brown and Tatum have been successful I don‚Äôt see them winning a title.  Sorry.  I think Jaylen Brown will complement Embiid perfectly.  I think Simmons will be a star with Tatum and Smart.
There is no way that the Celtics would trade Jaylen Brown for Simmons.  Absolutely no way.
"As a Celtics fan, I prefer Brown, though I love Jayson also.  Jaylen is underrated and he continues to improve every year.  Jayson will also get better but I worry about the Mamba Mentality at times."
"2 PM: Ben Simmons announces he's returning to the team, is delighted to be a 76er, and wants to win a title in Philly.  3 PM: Shams reveals that the reason Simmons is staying is that the 76ers are catering to his demands, building the team around him, and are finalizing a trade of Joel Embiid for Jaylen Brown, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, and a 1st round pick."
Why is everyone acting like Ben can't do anything on a basketball court? I think his shot creation for himself **and** others trumps  what Jaylen Brown gives you. That's not even touching the defensive side of the ball which is literally 50% of the game.
"I agree that this is very unlikely to happen but I‚Äôm just gonna say this. Jaylen Brown is better than Ben Simmons. He‚Äôs a better shooter, more athletic and certainly a better teammate. This trade would leave such a bad taste in the mouth of any true Celtics fan. It‚Äôs borderline disrespectful to JB even put this rumor out there."
The Celtics are not gonna trade Jaylen brown for ben fucking simmons lmao
"i hope you show up in the ""Simmons traded for Jaylen Brown"" thread lmfao..."
"Thanks, I made it for the toxic Jaylen brown fan boys on r/bostonceltics   Shit was getting out of hand over there"
"Lmao. More delusional Celtics fans. No Jaylen Brown is not an elite player. He is a 25 year old who never made an all nba team. He really developed as a scorer but isn‚Äôt in the elite tier, he can‚Äôt playmake or pass, and is a spotty defensive player despite this earlier being his strength.   He is barely a top 20 player in the league. Certainly not untouchable by any means."
"So if you really read whats being said, the only thing being reported is that Boston has reached out about Ben Simmons.   The author of this news then makes the logical conclusion that Philly would want Jaylen Brown, which sensationalizes the bit that's actually news. If doesn't say Boston has offered him, and honestly it'd make more sense if Boston reached out offering Horford's expiring, young players, and picks."
Now watch they say Jaylen Brown is in health and safety protocols in a few hours.
"This is wildly delusional thinking. The Celtics would be the ones making their conference rival much better in this scenario. Jaylen would be the best player that Embiid has played with since Jimmy. Boston would not be more ‚Äúscary‚Äù with Simmons than Brown; they would be much, much worse."
"Unless the shooter is prime Klay or something it wouldn‚Äôt be worth it.  Trading a 50c for 2 quarters in the nba is usual my a terrible move.  The type of shooter that would be packaged with Simmons would be a guy who would be a poor defender and would likely get hunted in the playoffs, unlike brown who is an elite defender.  At the end of the day, Ben Simmons being a worthless offensive player in the halfcourt makes any trade with him and brown a pretty clear step down from the Celtics.  &gt;they all played a role on championship rosters  I think if I replaced championship lowry/rondo with current jaylen brown their teams would figure it out.   Cp3 is in another tier from all of these guys so those comparisons don‚Äôt make much sense."
"&gt; Celtics wouldn‚Äôt give up Jaylen and Smart for Simmons + Maxey and Thybulle and say 2-3 frp?   Absolutely not. Brown has firmly cemented himself as one of those guys you only trade up with, if at all especially with his contract.  I wouldnt trade Brown ALONE for that package, forget including Smart."
damn that's crazy  they still aren't trading jaylen brown for simmons
at least you didn't draft LeBron and Jaylen Brown like me X_X
"Man if this actually happens, Jaylen Brown on the 76ers would be SCARY"
"Simmons absolutely has games where he goes off in the playoffs and I agree the stats don't look terrible, I just know what my lyin' eyes have told me watching him in the playoffs over the years, especially when it comes to 4th quarters and close games.  &gt;He's not nearly as far from being a major contributor as people have convinced themselves  ""Major contributor"" is certainly more than fair. He still brings a lot to the table and will look like a star many nights. But he really ""wants"" a team built around his weaknesses or that happens to be great fit for him already, and the Celtics are, again, right now sort of the exact opposite of the kind of situation he'd do best in.  As I said in another comment in this thread I actually *get* why Morey would demand Brown: Boston has a pretty garbage set of assets to offer other than Brown and Tatum. If I were Morey I'd probably make the exact same demand. But if I were Stephens that demand would be a non-starter (again, unless Morey gives Stephens a blank check on how to design the rest of the deal).  &gt;He doesn't need to be surrounded by 4 shooters to excel  Depends what you mean by ""excel"" but he can certainly be a very good player without that... but the more shooting you have around him the better, especially come the playoffs, and the Celtics are shooting .332 from the arc this year.  You take Jaylen (.397 on 7.3 3PA) out of the equation? The other Celtics are shooting .321 from the arc.  For comparison, the 76ers shot .374 from the arc last year."
I‚Äôm confused. We‚Äôre these separate trades or was he actually going to get both players for Jaylen Brown? Either one is hilarious on its own.
If they somehow get Jaylen Brown I'd be astonished
"I'm sure every team has called, and Morey/Sixers camp probably realy said ""We'd want Jaylen Brown"". It's not a lie, even if doesn't have a chance in hell of happening."
"If the Celtics were willing to trade Jaylen Brown, they could get so much more for him than Ben Simmons."
So you wouldn‚Äôt trade Seth and 2 firsts for Jaylen Brown? Cause Simmons is literally just taking up 30+mil salary cap while not playing.
"If you think about it just a little bit deeper than the memes, this trade actually makes sense. The Celtics have been very disappointing this season, and their track record overall since Jaylen and Jayson became the two main guys has been a little bit of a let down. Imo the two guys overlap too much to the point where it doesn‚Äôt make sense to have them on the same team. Trading for Simmons, an all world defender, balances out the offense (he doesn‚Äôt demand a lot of shots) and reduces the playmaking pressure on Tatum. Plus, it maybe helps the locker room culture in Boston to shake things up (I know, it‚Äôs Ben, but it‚Äôs gotta be better than staying in the same place, right?). Obviously, makes sense for the Sixers in that they get a solid wing scorer who‚Äôs also a good perimeter defender. Sixers defense has been missing Simmons badly, replacing him with Brown at least helps."
"&gt; The appeal for Boston is that Simmons is guaranteed to be a great distributor and defender. Brown and Tatum just seem a bit duplicative on the court.  I think it's really obvious that ideally Simmons would be on a team where everyone around him was a good shooter and a pretty good threat from the arc. Maximize spacing, make it possible to keep the lane relatively unclogged even when Simmons has the ball and defenses are sagging off him, minimize the damage from his shooting weakness.  That is, um, kind of the opposite of what Boston is right now, especially if you're moving Jaylen to get Simmons.  &gt;Simmons + Smart + Stevens' gritty/defense attitude has some synergy.  Simmons and Smart have massive anti-synergy. Yes, the defensive potential's a bit tantalizing, but the spacing and efficiency issues on offense would be a nightmare.  &gt;The trade you're suggesting is extremely difficult to find  No argument! I think Boston's kind of in a Portland with Lillard over the last few years situation where they should be willing to take calls on the player but should have such high standards for a trade that realistically one doesn't crop up. You're open to the idea but you're not about to force anything.  &gt;Simmons at his peak is the same ballpark as Jaylen- the problem is getting him to stay at his peak against bad playoff matchups (which, to be fair, is arguably exact same issue Boston has with Tatum/Brown in the playoffs).  I'd say the issues are pretty different actually and I'm not at all sure what you mean by ""exact same issue.""  Simmons issues become MUCH bigger against better defenses and when teams play with more intensity, and the playoffs bring a lot of both of those things.  Again: with the situation the Celtics are in I totally see why they'd be willing to take a big gamble and try to make Simmons work *with* Brown and Tatum. But I don't think they have the assets to entice Philly into that sort of deal (as low as Simmons value is, Boston just doesn't have much that appeals other than Brown or Tatum, so I do get why Morey would say ""if you want to do a deal you'd need to include Brown"" but just as equally Boston should have next to no interest in that scenario barring Morey handing them a blank check on what the rest of the deal looks like).  Basically: these are two teams that are both a little desperate for different reasons (the 76ers desperate about the Simmons situation, the Celtics desperate about the Celtics situation) so it makes sense that they'd talk... but their assets and situations actually make them a terrible fit for a trade so it doesn't make sense to me that the talks would go anywhere.  Of course in r/nba tradition that probably means we get a trade tomorrow. Hi future redditors!"
"Lol dont worry you guys'll get a fresh ben simmons. Hopefully, for Jaylen Brown."
Jaylen Brown is nice but on what grounds his he Better then Ben Simmons? He more complete sure! But Ben Simmons has so much more up room considering that he already destroy JB in Acolades......
"Yes literally nothing. The only players he's worth trading for are players that are even more untradeable than him like Giannis, KD, Luka, etc. You don't trade a Jaylen Brown type player unless he's demanding out or you're going full tank."
"The appeal for Boston is that Simmons is guaranteed to be a great distributor and defender.  Brown and Tatum just seem a bit duplicative on the court.    If you believe in your player development, you are likely to think you can help Simmons improve as well (every basketball coach/development guy has ideas about how they can make a difference).  The other issue is that if you were to think of who the perfect fit would be for a non-star player to make it all come together... it'd be Kemba Walker- a PG/table-setter.  But that didn't work.  (same with Kyrie).  Simmons + Smart + Stevens' gritty/defense attitude has some synergy.  The trade you're suggesting is extremely difficult to find- Jaylen for Halliburton and extra?  It's a *huge* gamble, and it puts a ton of pressure on Halliburton- because once those pre-star guys hit, they're not available, and before they hit, their peak may turn out much lower than Jaylen.    Simmons at his peak is the same ballpark as Jaylen- the problem is getting him to stay at his peak against bad playoff matchups (which, to be fair, is arguably exact same issue Boston has with Tatum/Brown in the playoffs).  This is a long way of saying that this is a far better deal for both teams than a lot of Boston fans would admit.  I'm not saying Boston *should* take this deal- just that it's very reasonable to do so."
Also Jaylen Brown is not better then Ben Simmons. More complete? Sure! Better? The numbers and the Acolades don't match. It's just not close. You guys are letting his failures blind you of his brilliance. Quote me on this
Lmao if Boston really trades Jaylen Brown for Simmons‚Ä¶.
even if we‚Äôre having locker room problems and a bad start to the season Jaylen brown is in a different league than Simmons
"&gt;Eric Cartman  Me if Brad Stevens trades Jaylen Brown for Ben Simmons:  ""Screw you guys, I'm going home."""
And ‚Äúno deal is imminent‚Äù because the asking price is Jaylen Brown ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
You have to wonder how adding Jaylen Brown to this mix could mess with the Chemistry
They would be dumb AF to trade Jaylen brown. Once his name came up the talks would be done
Is Jaylen Brown even that good? I don't watch a lot of Celtics Games. It's an honest question.
"If the Celtics were seriously into moving Jaylen Brown and I'm the Nuggets, I'm on that phone crafting a better package than Ben Simmons"
&gt; There are NO players who are better than Ben and who become available for trade who are Simmons age.   I mean if Jaylen is actually available for trade then he absolutely fits this bill.  This is why if the Celtics were to trade Jaylen or Tatum I doubt it'd be a 1 for 1 trade with another 22-26 y.o. established star. You either go for an older superstar (yes there's a timeline mismatch but you do it hoping the superstar and whichever of the two you kept can be competitive now with other supplementary moves) or a package centered around a younger guy who's not yet a peer but has superstar potential. Or you just don't trade either guy and try to fix the rest of the team.  The Sixers should want to snap Boston's hand off for Jaylen. Even if he is arguably an imperfect fit he's a MUCH easier asset than Simmons to turn around and spin elsewhere for a big return. This move should absolutely be intriguing for Philly for obvious reasons: they go from a Chernobyl of a situation to having a hugely attractive 25 y.o. trade asset who helps the team right away in the meantime.  Why Boston should want to do such a deal is extremely unclear to me. There are obvious reasons for Boston to be interested in the risk of adding Simmons *without* moving Brown and Tatum (not a risk I love but there's an argument) but moving one of the two to do it really makes no sense.
"&gt;‚ÄúHey, Daryl, it‚Äôs Brad.‚Äù      ‚ÄúHey.‚Äù      ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on with that guy who quit on your team and now does the bare minimum and completely torpedoed his trade value?

Fire Marcus Smart into the sun to make this happen.  Jaylen Brown is a funny ask.  He's arguably better than Tatum.
"The healthy AD, Bron and westbrook that lost to Boston tonight without Jaylen Brown and Rob Williams üòÇ"
"Except when Tatum and Brown are on the floor the ball never, and i repeat, NEVER starts with Jaylen Brown. Not unless they're in transition and then Jaylen ""one of the best players in transition"" Brown takes it to the rack and we thank our lucky stars he doesn't pass in those situations."

last week one of my opponents tried to offer me a trade of Kelly Olynyk + Mitchell Robinson + Cory Joseph in exchange for  LeBron + Jaylen Brown üòî. I obviously declined the offer and still lost (still winless in my fantasy league) but damn those injuries have my team disrespected
It's time to seriously discuss whether Tatum is better without Jaylen Brown. It always seems like Tatum's best games all came with Jaylen Brown out of the game.
"dude's been my only beacon of hope in Fantasy with LeBron/Jaylen Brown being out for stretches and RJ Barrett in a bad shooting slump, where I currently have a 0% chance of making the playoffs in my league üòî"
Tatum and Brown don't work well together because Jaylen is a bad passer.
Jayson Tatum is back  No Jaylen Brown or Rob Williams and they still blew 'em out
No Jaylen Brown or Rob Williams for us either. A surprising result tbh
Holy shit I didn‚Äôt even realize this entire game Boston didn‚Äôt have Jaylen Brown lmfao  This is just sad for LA
"We have the Big 3 (LBJ/AD/Melo), Russ, and THT all healthy tonight, yet we're still getting blown out by a team without its best player (Jaylen Brown)  smh"
Tatum &gt; Jaylen Brown
"to be fair, the only reason the lakers are down 10 is because Jaylen Brown and Robert Williams aren‚Äôt playing"
"Sure wish Jaylen Brown and Rob Williams were here, because we're complete shit without them."
"The problem with Tatum is that he was too good too soon, but isn't actually good enough to carry a team. A real lose-lose situation. Won't be solved until Jaylen Brown requests a trade next year and they blow it up completely"
"I think I would move Jaylen Brown below Mitchell and Book. Also, if we‚Äôre going based on how this season has played out, Lebron definitely should not be number 1 at SF"
"Jimmy Butler has been significantly better than LeBron, given that LeBron has not played much. I would say  SF: Butler, George, Derozan, and then perhaps LeBron and Tatum  Even as a Mavs fan, I dont think I can say Luka has been the 2nd best PG.  PG: Steph, Ja Morant, Trae Young, Luka, and then I see one of CP3, Lillard, and SGA  I also don't think Harden has been the best SG. I would say that Lavine, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, and Jaylen Brown may all have had a slightly more successful season than Harden so far."
"Curry is not a top 4 guard defender in the league and even he knows it. The fact that people in this thread are taking this seriously is embarrassing.  He'd have to beat 6 of Jrue Holiday, Butler, CP3, Vanvleet, Thybulle, Bridges, Dort, Jaylen Brown, Caruso. Would be a joke if he makes all-defense, but voters love him so who knows."
there is a 0% chance the Celtics trade *Jaylen* Brown for De'Aaron Fox.
"I mean, Jaylen Brown is much better than both Fox and Simmons so I'd think so."
They stay with what they have and look for a better trade. Trade buddy and Haliburton for jaylen brown when the celtics reach 15 games under .500
"I mean - he is a borderline top 20 player‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt get me wrong, he‚Äôs having a top 10 season so far and ranking him 82nd is ridiculous, but if you were starting a team today, for only this next season‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs borderline going top 20.   Assuming no injury no question you take Steph, Jokic, KD, Lebron, Giannis, Harden, Luka, Kawhi, Embiid, AD, Butler, and PG13 over him. That‚Äôs 12 players.   Even though he‚Äôs having a better season so far than some of the following players I‚Äôd probably take them over him too: CP3, Dame, Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Booker, Ja, Beal, Middleton, Trae. Maybe you take DD over them, maybe not.   You‚Äôve then also got players like KAT, Bam, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, LaVine, and Lowry who it wouldn‚Äôt be crazy to pick over DD - maybe you do, maybe you don‚Äôt.   And, despite what I said on injury, I‚Äôm not even including Kyrie (who is a head case and I wouldn‚Äôt want close to my team) or Klay &amp; Jamal Murray (tbd on how they come back from injury)   So yea, I feel like borderline top 20 is very, very fair. Putting him any higher would be ridiculous."
Celtics will trade Jaylen Brown by the deadline.
"PG: Trae, Ja, Fox*, Schroeder   SG: Sexton, Mitchell, Jalen Green  SF: Lavine, Jaylen Brown, Ant Edwards  PF: Zion, Giannis, Jerami Grant   C: KAT, Bam, Turner   *idk if Fox is still as fast, after he bulked up he looks a lot slower"
"Tatum over Brown? I get that Jaylen has missed games, but, Tatum has honestly not been an All-Star level player this year, whilst Jaylen was great before his injury."
"Your best bet is a jaylen brown if the Celtics want change.   Dame, I guess but why would a small martket team trade their biggest draw in of money ?   None of these players you named who are franchise futures and or contending for a championship trading for ben simmons. It's counter productive."
"Morey is so delusional  first of all he's banking on having the best offer for Damian Lillard when the best return that Portland could get for Damian Lillard would actually be Jaylen Brown which any team would take over Ben Simmons. Also Dame might actually choose to go play for a guy that's looking to bring greatness to a franchise he's been loyal too, much like how Giannis said if he left Milwaukee it would be to play in Portland with Dame. Dame would probably want to play with another lone star guard who has been far too loyal to his franchise..a guy that many know as...Bradley Beal.   Like what if Morey thinks ""Portland has to say yes"" and Dame says ""I don't want to play for Philly"" and Portland is actually on board because they'd rather have picks than Ben Simmons?  Morey better pray he can grab Fox from the Kings, it really is looking like the best possible trade for them."
"Lol it wasn't just Brown though.  &gt;Any potential Simmons deal with the Celtics would have to include All Star Jaylen Brown.""  And the money doesn't work for a straight 1-for-1 swap, meaning we'd have to give up another contract as well.  In the heat of the moment r/sixers was talking about maybe sneaking someone like Pritchard into the deal."
"Randle? In 2024-2025 he is slated to make 27.5 mil.  Ben Simmons is getting 40 mil plus a 15 % trade kicker.  That is an increase of 46% over Randle.  Ben Simmons is currently the 20th highest paid player.  I wonder how many of those players have such massive yips? How many of those are locker room killers? I wonder how many of those guys would scoff at getting better.  Lebron, Durant, Steph, Harden, Giannis those guys are miles ahead of Ben Simmons.  You will never, never, NEVER, see them bitching about getting better. Ben Simmons is too good and arrogant to get better though.....  Ben Simmons makes more money than the current MVP, Jokic, you think Jokic gonna bitch and moan about getting better?  Ben makes more than Embiid.  More than Booker.  More than Jaylen Brown.  More than Tatum.  Tell me when we see a name thats also a locker room killer, spacing killer, pouting about getting better.  Those guys grind. Or at least know how to play the game off the court.  And lots of Knicks fans are losing patience with Randle.... still...  Even with his problems,  he never bitched about putting in the work. He would never hold the entire team/franchise hostage over, lol practice!"
"Westbrick, Rudy Gobert, Jaylen Brown, Jrue, Towns, Julius Randle."
"I can easily think of 30 players better than Simmons (I'll exclude Embiid from the list)  In no real order: 1. Lebron 2. KD 3. Giannis 4. Curry 5. Luka 6. Jokic 7. Harden 8. PG 9. Cp3 10. Kawhi 11. AD 12. Lillard 13. Tatum 14. Zion 15. Butler 16. Beal 17. Trae Young 18. Donovan Mitchell 19. KAT 20. Zach Lavine 21. Booker 22. Bam 23. Jaylen Brown 24. Jrue Holiday 25. SGA 26. Ja Morant 27. Rudy Gobert 28. Middleton 29. DeRozan 30. LaMelo Ball  Also Kyrie Irving if he actually wanted to play basketball  There is probably some you could make arguments for one way or the other and obviously fit comes into play so I doubt they're trying to trade for say Rudy Gobert, but I also probably forgot some players you could add to this list as well.  That being said you're also probably not getting a 1 for 1 trade for Simmons with the current situation. So I guess you hold out and hope the situation improves"
"Thus far stats --&gt;  Young 16 games, 25.1 ppg, 9.2 apg, 3.5 rbp, 0.9 spg, 0.1 bpg, 4.1 Tovpg,  .508 EFG%, .565 TS%, 3.0 BPM, .144 WS/48, 0.8 RAPTOR, 1.0 WAR  Harden 16 games, 20.3 ppg, 8.8 apg, 7.6 rpg, 1.2 spg, 0.8 bpg, 4.9 tovpg, .539 EFG%, .615 TS%, 3.6 BPM, .175 WS/48, 1.4 RAPTOR, 1.2 WAR  Beal 11 games, 23.4 PPG, 5.7 apg, 5.3 rpg, 1.3 spg, 0.5 bpg, 3.8 tovpg, .456 EFG%, .504 TS%, 0.46 WS/48,  -0.1 BPM,  1.9 RAPTOR, 1.0 WAR  LaMelo 16 games, 18.8 PPG, 7.5 apg, 7.4 rpg, 2.1 spg, 0.4 bpg, 3.0 tovpg, .496 EFG%, .528 TS%, .127 WS/48, 3.7  BPM,  6.0 RAPTOR , 2.4 WAR  Lavine 15 games,  26.2 PPG, 3.7 apg, 5.7 rpg,  0.5 spg, 0.3 bpg, 2.9 tovpg, .567 EFG%, .609 TS%, .157 WS/48, 2.6 BPM,  -0.3 RAPTOR,  0.6 WAR   Jaylen Brown has only played 8 games so currently his performance would not warrant an all star spot    so currently, Lamelo would easily be the #3 guard at worst in the east going strictly by numbers. his advance analystics blow everyone else out of the water, especially using the RAPTOR model.  so to answer your question, if the all star game was today, lamelo would definitely deserve one of the 5 guard spots and actually it would be a robbery of epic proportions if he did not make it. however, there is still a lot of games to be played"
"Dude Morey thinks ben is enough for Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal or Dame. All of his expectations aren't realistic."
Jaylen brown or beal potentially as they has been quite streaky
I personally really appreciate them taking Lonzo Ball &amp; Brandon Ingram over Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown   Sabonis   Ingram
You guys only won by 11 when we were missing Jaylen Brown and Timelord lmfao
"depends on who knows what?  if i know everything i know in 2021, and no one else does, then i'm drafting ben simmons first, playing him for a season, then drafting him for someone who won't fall off a cliff.  if everyone knows ben simmons is shit, then i'm taking jaylen brown first, siakam second, BI third."
Beal and Harden will most likely pick it up enough to get selected by the time the ASG comes around. If the Heat are good enough and Kyle Lowry picks it up he might get selected and if the Raptors are good enough VanVleet has a real chance. Jaylen Brown might not play enough games but he probably will.   A lot of guards in the east have started slow. Lavine and Trae are the only two guards in the east who haven‚Äôt really started slow. He‚Äôs got a pretty good chance imo.
Best player: Jaylen Brown  Who the 76ers would draft in hindsight and not trade him: Jamal Murray
Until jamal comes back I can't take him over jaylen brown
"They've done well, but those were some high picks also. Its a lot easier to draft well when you pick at #2 every year.  * Randle at 7 was a good pick, but not the best pick in that draft or anything. Still, I'd say he'd go higher in a redraft so props to them for the pick. * Rusell went #2 in 2015. People have a wide range of opinions, I tend to think he's overrated. Not a bust or anything, but you figure they'd pick up Booker in a redraft, and probably also take Porzingis and Myles Turner ahead of him. The Lakers got Larry Nance late in this draft, which I do think is actually a really good pick. I'd rather have him than Russell, honestly. * Ingram #2 in 2016. Another good, not great pick. Went before Siakam, Jaylen Brown, Sabonis, Jamal Murray, Brogdon and Dejounte Murray. Not sure how a redraft would go, but probably he isn't the 2nd best player in the draft. * Lonzo went #2 in 2017 right ahead of Tatum. Bam and Donovan Mitchell also went in the lottery that year. I think he goes behind those guys for sure in a redraft, and also maybe Fox, Jarret Allan, OG, and John Collins. Not a bust, but probably not like a great pick either.  Overall I'd say good but not great picks. They didn't get any real busts, so I give them credit, but they also picked super high 3 years in a row. They could have a team with Randle, Booker, Turner, Siakam, and Donovan Mitchell or something and win 70 games."
lesson learned: we are not a good team without Jaylen Brown and Rob Williams  also our bench sucks but what else is new
Or whatever LeBron or Jaylen Brown are grandstanding about
"This is what I've been saying all along. His value just keeps dropping, and at this point it's hard to believe it will ever recover, at least while he's in Philly. Morey is clinging to the sunk cost and doesn't want to sell low on him, but I don't think he has a choice.  I know this sounds crazy, but I'm not sure he has ANY trade value left. Despite his obvious upside, his contract may actually be an overall liability. I certainly wouldn't give up assets in a trade beyond making the cap numbers work. Certainly not giving up Jrue Holliday or Jaylen Brown for him"
"Why am I seeing articles with 3-team trade deals with Simmons-Kat-Brown at the center of them all?  KAT seems like he can be a 1 or 2 option on a championship Team. Brown seems like he can be a 2. And Ben is maybe a 3rd team option on a championship team? But without an ability to even TAKE a 3‚Ä¶it kind of diminishes his value there because how how negative his spacing is.  Is this just sunk cost fallacy on Morey‚Äôs part? He didn‚Äôt get a deal he liked last year at the deadline; after the playoffs the deals are worse, and now he‚Äôs asking for the same more more? What am I missing here? Why would anyone trade a cornerstone of their franchise for this dude without like‚Ä¶I dunno 4 unprotected picks coming back 7 years from now?  Like I could wrap my head around:  Dame  For  Simmons Unprotected first Pick swap Unprotected first Pick swap Unprotected first Pick swap Unprotected first   But‚Ä¶KAT for Simmons and change? Jaylen Brown? Wtf are people smoking?"
"Chris Paul, Jaylen Brown, Kawhi, Pat Bev, Lamelo Ball, Kyle Lowry, PJ Tucker, Markieff &amp; Marcus Morris, Jokic, Steph &amp; Seth Curry   All of these combined should result in chaos = I walk free"
"love this logic from Morey. Lets trash him in the media and talk about his unwillingness to improve as a player but lets also go to Portland, ask for Lillard and pick swaps. Lets go to Boston and as for Jaylen Brown + a couple of 1st round picks. Fantastic. No way anybody could have seen this backfire"
"Cause in all instances there, Morey is the one calling the other team and leaking details of his own asking price to the media.  Good job lil Daryl, you asked a rival gm for Jaylen Brown. Slink away now."
"&gt; I mean no one, including KD, could have seen the pandemic coming.  It doesn't take the pandemic for everyone to see that Kyrie is dumb as fucking rocks.   This guy was a dumb ass way before the pandemic.   He must have been so shook by the presence of Jaylen Brown."
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
Jaylen Brown although he's not a superstar like giannis and kawhi
"I highly doubt Morey trying to rob the raptors and finese Jaylen Brown were the only discussions on the table, not to mention all those are way higher value than Ben. There were probably some decent value offers out there. That said since I haven‚Äôt heard any of that pop-up, I agree."
"Well then he‚Äôs gonna have the same problems elsewhere because everyone does that. Marcus Smart just called out Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown like last week. Anthony Edwards called out Kat and Dlo. That‚Äôs what Teammates do when asked a specific question. None of them sulked and ghosted the team like Ben though, instead they listened and got better."
Yeah and we‚Äôre missing Jaylen Brown lol
"Probably. The 2020 East all-star guards were Beal, Kyrie, Jaylen Brown, Harden, Lavine and Simmons.   Simmons and Kyrie ain‚Äôt gonna make it this year, so that‚Äôs two extra spots. But the other 4 will likely be there. Trae is gonna get a spot.  That leaves 1. And a quick check of ESPN shows the two high guards are Ball and Brogdon. And Lamelo will easily take that based on hype value alone lol"
"Your right I forgot about them. I got him near top 20 after considering butler pg13 Jaylen brown, sga, Donovan, derozan, Murray."
Jaylen Brown baby üëÄ
"nope he‚Äôs talking about jaylen brown, he‚Äôs a notorious brown hater"
Better than Jaylen Brown? I don't think so
coby looks like jaylen brown out there lol
"It's impossible to say. They still don't have a single great win under their belt because the best teams they've beaten have been missing their best or second best players in those games, while the Mavs have been relatively healthy.   The Celtics were missing Jaylen Brown, the Nuggets were missing MPJ (and Murray), and the Raptors were missing Siakem."
"I don't think this thread is necessarily typical. Mobley and the Cavs are generally well-liked at the moment, but look at any similar thread about a Laker, James Harden, Kristaps Porzingus, etc and you'll see a whole different thread.  In years past I saw some of the worst, most reactionary takes ever in similar posts about rookie Trae Young/Brandon Ingram/Lonzo Ball/Jaylen Brown. I'm sure Hawks and Celtics fans haven't forgotten those. I think these posts usually feed into the worst parts of this sub's collective psyche and drag down the level of discourse."
Jaylen Brown
"Zoomers range from stars like Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown to current"
"Okay what about either Tatum or Jaylen Brown, one of those guys is better than Derozan"
"&gt;But I‚Äôm starting to think Kuminga has way better handle and passing skill than Jaylen Brown entering the league. Also he‚Äôs like an inch taller than Jaylen.   def, also think he's even more athletic  flipside I doubt Kuminga improves his shooting nearly as much as Brown did or as fast if at all, and I don't think he'll develop the same scoring prowess anywhere as quickly. And like you said few players improve as fast or as much as Jaylen Brown year to year"
LeBron and Jaylen Brown have been missing games but they should be All Stars once they‚Äôre back to playing  Dame has not been playing well so we‚Äôll see once he comes back healthy and if team actually wins because that kind of matters a lot in the loaded West
"There are some similarities and expected developmental blueprint to follow between Kuminga and Jaylen Brown  Defensively, NBA ready body and strength and athleticism are the most similar   But I‚Äôm starting to think Kuminga has way better handle and passing skill than Jaylen Brown entering the league. Also he‚Äôs like an inch taller than Jaylen.  Brown didn‚Äôt take a lot of 3 his rookie year but by his second year he was already a knock down spot up shooter, and he worked and worked to better his FT, handles and off the dribble game.. Brown improvement over the years are massive, and his handles unlock his off the dribble shooting‚Ä¶   I think rookie Kuminga could actually be more productive than rookie Jaylen Brown given how the Warriors can utilize him"
"Tatum is a good player in the L,  but he thinks he something he's not.  He would be so much better if he did a little self auditing and played more team ball.  Jaylen Brown is right there with him, better imo.  But I like Tatum, just not when he's your teams best or thinks he's the teams best player."
"Nah, Jaylen Brown was definitely more raw than Kuminga right now"
"Jaylen Brown as a rookie was incredibly raw. I think PF version of JB, JB leans more towards SG/SF whereas Kuminga is a SF/PF."
1 jaylen brown and timelord please for Kat. we'll give u Dlo for free.
"Jeff Green with better defense than advertised, but a less consistent jumpshot. Jaylen Brown but much more raw. Bigger Shawn Marion? Idk"
Jaylen Brown declined to hire an agent leading up to and following the draft; instead he elected to negotiate his first contract himself with a small group of mentors including Shareef Abdur-Rahim
"You mean like how they flipped on:  ""Nance is a bum that can only dunk"" to ""Nance is a quality, versatile role player for the Cavs""  ""Clarkson is a chucker that can never meaningful contribute""(this continued with Lebron) to ""Clarkson is such a great 6th man, just a flamethrower""  ""Brandon Ingram is such a bust and one pick before Jaylen Brown. He's a stick, can't finish through contact, can't shoot, Travis Outlaw"" to ""Ingram is turning the corner and living up to that Durant lite comparison""  ""Lonzo Ball is GARBAGE. I can't believe Lavar got the Lakers to believe he was worth the 2nd round pick"" *proceeds to post literally every negative statline and bad highlight from his rookie season"" to ""Lonzo's defense is amazing and he transformed his shot, amazing""  This list can go on and on. Zubac was maybe one of the few that didn't get shit while on the Lakers."
Trade Jaylen Brown build around Simmons
"The way the 76ers and Doc Rivers have mostly evaded any backlash for the current situation is astounding to me. Like okay, he passed up a wide open dunk, he bricked every shot, he was -100 on the court, fucking trade him and that‚Äôs it. bUt tHEy prOTeCTeD hIm fOr yEaRS aNd sTiLl dIdnT iMprOVE, okay, just fucking trade him then? So now we have a 3x All Star and All-NBA level player that‚Äôs allegedly worthless, but then they try to trade for players like Jaylen Brown lol. Is he garbage or is he not? Make up your fucking minds. I hope he pisses off the organization as much as he can, I would too if they **publicly** shat on me like they did"
Ok but don't underestimate how rudderless the Celtics are without Jaylen Brown and Al Horford.
When Jaylen Brown was playing in his rookie season people were asking whether there are any rookies as bad as him who improved tremendously.  When Jordan Poole was playing in his rookie season he was considered the worst player in the league by all advanced metrics  When Ben Simmons was in his rookie season he was called the next Lebron by many. People were saying Simmons has higher potential than Mitchell  Wiggins was called maple Jordan  Tyreke Evans was said to have higher potential than Steph Curry  And the list goes on  No way am I saying Wiseman has more potential than Lamelo but its way too early to say Lamelo will be better than Wiseman down the stretch. People who are saying that are also the same people who are gonna cry about how Warriors are stacked if Wiseman turns out to be a stud
"The consensus is Lamelo is much much better than Wiseman right now. As a Warriors fan, I agree  But seems like no one remembers when the consensus was Simmons &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jaylen Brown  Dont cry if Wiseman turns out to be a stud lmao"
"So no, you haven't watched Maxey then lol.   You don't know what the offers for Simmons are any more than I do. At best you might here about 1 proposed offer (like the Jaylen Brown one) but for that there are 20 more that you don't hear about.  The fact remains that we have no reason to trade Simmons for anything less than an all-star calbiur player. We already have the best role-players in the league, we don't need more depth."
"I hope we reward people who are actually playing well this year with good teams instead of just the usual picks. I think top 8 teams in the east all deserve at least one all-star this year so if I had to pick 1 all-star from each right now it would be:  Wizards - Beal  Nets - KD  Bulls - DeRozan  Cavs - Mobely  76ers - Embiid  Heat - Bam  Raptors - FVV  Knicks - Randle  Then that leaves 4 more spots. Harden and Lavine should be givens here. Then Giannis is the 3rd spot here.  That leaves 1 spot that is up for interpretation really and I think will be difficult to pick just one of them: Butler, Lowry, Lamelo Ball, Jaylen Brown, Trae (I don't think he deserves it but will be in the convo due to name), Garland/Sexton (depending on how that Cavs are looking in the standings near voting time), Scottie Barnes (depending on how raptors look in standings). I think media will give this one to Butler or Brown even though I'd like a new all-star here."
"i don't think browns really much of a playmaker but I can definitely agree on that second part though he's fucking insane, like i don't think this team has a true superstar (like top 10 player in the league) but at this point i feel like if one of the two j's were to become a top 10 player id bet on jaylen, simply because i think tatum is about as good as he's going to get while brown has consistently proven every projection i've had of him wrong."
"on the bright side for us while our offense is still hot garbage, they also only scored 91 points, so, our defense is definitely trending in the right direction, and hey, once jaylen brown comes back i think we should be okay.  we seriously need a playmaker though, fuck."
"&gt; Embid &amp; Randle lost to Wiggins  &gt; Jaylen Brown, Igram, Siakam lost to Brogdon  &gt; Tatum, Mitchell, BAM lost to Simmons  As rookies? That‚Äôs fair.   &gt; Bagley and Mobamba lost to Luka.  I mean it‚Äôs Luka."
Why do I suspect your basement is covered with pictures of Jaylen Brown with his face X'd out with a Sharpie?
"I think he'd need to average around 26 and the Heat as a top 2/3 seed, to get the all star nod (assuming not a lot of injuries).   Just in his own team you got Butler and likely Bam ahead of him.   Rosters are 12 players. Players almost definitely above him are KD, Harden, Beal, Embiid, Tatum, Giannis, Trae, Butler, Bam. So that's 9.   Then you got players like Jaylen Brown, Lavine, Derozan, Sabonis, Middleton, Lamelo, Randle, Siakam.   It's tough."
"&gt;Jaylen Brown, Ingram, Siakam lost to Brogdon  Brown, Ingram, and Siakam were all pretty ass in their rookie year."
"ROY of the year isn't that big of deal.    I'm sure ANT knows Curry and Harden lost ROY to Tyreke Evans.    Giannis &amp; Oladipo lost to MCW.   Embid &amp; Randle lost to Wiggins  Jaylen Brown, Igram, Siakam lost to Brogdon  Tatum, Mitchell, BAM lost to Simmons  Bagley and Mobamba lost to Luka."
Bad start but doing as expected now. Also are missing Jaylen Brown rn.
Jaylen Brown would be a passing machine if he was drafted by the Warriors tbh
I think I saw Jaylen Brown + Robert Williams more than that.
He‚Äôs got the body of Jaylen Brown but actually likes to pass‚Ä¶
"Jaylen Brown, buddy"
Lol probs the same quack who banned me for saying that Scottie Barnes basketball IQ is higher than Jaylen Brown. I may have been wrong but God damn dead sea levels of salt over there.
"The Boston Celtics OBLITERATE the defending champion Milwaukee Bucks behind WINNING performances from team LEADERS Jayson Tatum and Marcus Smart.    The Celtics held superstars Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton to ZERO points combined.  This was all done without Jaylen Brown, who was suspiciously ABSENT from the Celtics lineup with what is *alleged* to be a hamstring injury.  This performance begs the question: *are the Celtics better without Jaylen Brown?*  and certainly gives support to the whispers of respectable but yet-unnamed r/nba shitposters who insist that a Jaylen Brown for Ben Simmons trade is imminent."

"Jaylen ""DNP"" Brown (just wanted to fire back with an equally idiotic take)"
I feel like most of the younger guards in the league do the stupid heat-check thing. Jaylen Brown is liable to do it as well
"is it just me or does smart consistently take bad shots at the end of the game? similar thing happened against the pistons, just brown got the final look. im shocked the ball wasn't in either Jaylen or Jayson's hand at the end, even tho it did work out in the end."
"Forget Jaylen brown, I‚Äôd take bill Simmons over Ben."
The idea of Jaylen Brown starting at SG for my nets now that Din Din got hurt makes me sexually aroused
I'm a big fan of Jaylen Brown and it pains me when I think about how he lost his best friend at a young age.
Jaylen Brown
Seems like the Celtics are attention whoring   Probably all directed by Jaylen Brown who wants to be seen as so ‚Äúwoke‚Äù and ‚Äúsmart‚Äù
"I was just about to say, we got some nice guards but Jaylen Brown??? Right this way sir, let's get you outta that green and introduce you to the purple and gold."
"I don't even necessarily think it's entirely political. Today was a pretty freaking huge deal, an armed mob stormed the seat of American government and the sitting President basically cheered them on.  Particularly for guys like Jaylen Brown who we know are deeply invested in politics (or at least causes for justice and equality) it may just be that they didn't feel right playing basketball like it's business as usual.  That being said, if the team is comfortable playing then I'm obviously happy with that too. But I'd rather add an L to the column than force the team to play at a time when other shit might be occupying their thoughts (quite reasonably)"
"I love Jaylen fucking Brown  Please stop playing for Boston, Jaylen!"
Jaylen Brown seems like an amazing and brilliant dude I‚Äôm sure he has a lot to say today. I‚Äôm happy to see this
Jaylen brown would fit your team better I feel   Also maybe Ingram
Jaylen Brown a legend frfr
"Great for the Celtics.   Jaylen Brown been doing a lot overall for things like these, being a social/political activist, love the guy and love what the Celts are doing.  No wonder why Gordon Hayward left"
?? Jaylen brown seems like the best fit for our team.
Jaylen Brown. We get an all star caliber two way guard back.
"Our starting bigs scored two points last game. Our rookie point guard scored like 20. We have a rookie point guard playing like that, not to mention an all star point guard that is injured, an amazing defensive 2, that is hot or cold from 3, Jaylen freaking Brown, Jayson freaking Tatum, and oh lookie, an average center. I like Tristan and Theis both a lot, but that is by far our biggest weakness.  Their is your rebuttal"
Jaylen Brown.  Feels like he‚Äôs a breakout star if he can be the clear cut first option. Ja second.
Jaylen Brown is a monster but Ja for me
"I like how your last two comments are hating on Jaylen Brown üòÇ. You could be complementing Ben Simmons or something but no, choose to hate. Either way your just simply wrong and Jaylen is a fantastic defender."
Jaylen Brown
Tobi fills that role well for us right now. Give me Jaylen Brown to replace Danny on the wing.
A second Jaylen Brown. but i‚Äôd actually want Ja
For the Suns I think you take Jaylen Brown. The thought of him and Bridges together sounds perfect
Imagine thinking Jaylen Brown is gamechanger on defense
"Jaylen Brown. Why not two of them?  (Serious answer, Simmons. I think we have the spacing for him, and his playmaking and defense would be *incredible* for this roster. Sabonis would be a solid fit at the 5, too.)"
Jaylen Brown
Brandon Ingram or Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown at the 2 guard would be amazing.  Jrue/Brown/Middleton/Giannis/Lopez
Ben Simmons.   1. We already have Jaylen Brown. 2. We can hide a lot of Ben's key weaknesses 3. We could use another driving threat + playmaker 4. He fits our switchable defence  Walker / Brown / Tatum / Simmons / Thompson + Smart as 6th man.  He hasn't played like BPA but his fit in Boston would be unreal.
"Thats not the same situation though. Raptors beating the Sixers wasn't luck and no one would say it is. Raptors beating the Bucks wasn't luck and no one has ever even implied that it was. Raptors beating the Warriors? Yes some luck involved because KD and Klay both got injured. The Heat didn't face an opponent who faced these types of injuries. You can argue Sabonis and Hayward but they're no where near the talent level of KD and Klay. That would be like Celtics losing both Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum in the same series.   I still don't see what ""luck"" miami had. Their ""luck"" is that their players played up to the standard that they've been playing most of the season? and the weather?"
He should've been what Jaylen Brown is. Loved Stanley coming outta Arizona
Same thing with the Jaylen Brown one. It's just sad to be that petty
When has this concern actually played out lol? I've only also heard it with Jaylen Brown
"lol, you're looking hard through all his posts/comment history to discredit the dude, is his opinion if he thinks jaylen brown is in the mvp conversation  what would i expect from a dude named ""zionisfat"" you sound like a natural hater tbh..."
"Nah it wasn't tampering, no fines were laid lol. Kyrie bad mouthed his teammates to the media after playing sht, Terry Rozier and Jaylen brown talk and about Kyrie, and Draymond went on All the Smoke podcast and said KD ruined the Warriors lockeroom after he got jealous of LeBron lol  LeBron's cool with everyone, Kyrie and KD are bust jealous and toxic lol. You probably weren't even a fan of theirs before they joined lol, stop this nonsense, it's well known their toxic."
"Yeah, it's hard to figure out. What would be the most fair 1:1 trade?  Jaylen Brown? Brandon Ingram?  Am I too low on Towns?"
We don't have Jaylen Brown so we aren't a contender obviously
"Neither team would get better, because both teams have optimized their team personnel and schemes based off the talent on hand.  EDIT: For example, Ben Simmons wouldn't be the PG in GSW, which essentially makes him Jaylen Brown without the shooting skill, or Tony Allen with a handle. He is way less valuable off the ball."
Most of these ‚Äúprogression‚Äù is a result of better shooting. Maybe I‚Äôm sceptical but I don‚Äôt think Jaylen Brown and Collin Sexton are going to be averaging 57% and 55% shooting for the rest of the season
Surprised nobody has said Jaylen Brown yet
Not necessarily. I‚Äôd say Jaylen brown was a project
Brogdon and Jaylen Brown were considered very smart coming into the league. Hell some people pre-draft had concerns about Jaylen being too smart.
"Jaylen Brown averaged 20.3 PPG, not Gordon Hayward  Kemba Walker averaged 20.4 and Jayson Tatum averaged 23.4"
Celtics did it last year  Jayson Tatum: 23.4 ppg  Kemba Walker: 20.4 ppg  Jaylen Brown: 20.3 ppg  (Honorable mention that almost made it 4 players over 20 ppg)  Gordon Hayward: 17.5 ppg
"Seems foolish to wait to reveal to the world that in a 70 day offseason, Jaylen Brown got better than Jayson Tatum. If you can average 30 as the off ball scorer for 8 games , you can average 30 as the team leader for the rest of your career"
Drafting:   Small Forwards  - Larry Bird  - Hondo  - Paul Pierce  - Gerald Green  - Jaylen Brown  - Jayson Tatum   Recently good in acquiring PGs but small sample size   - Isaiah Thomas  - Kyrie Irving  - Kemba Walker
Simmons also didn't play in the playoffs this past year. It wouldn't make sense to judge the Celtics playoff performance of Jaylen Brown missed the whole thing.
Celtics  1. Jayson Tatum 2. Jaylen Brown 3. Marcus Smart 4. Peyton Pritchard 5. Robert Williams 6. Aaron Nesmith 7. Romeo Langford
Celtics and small forwards:  John Havlicek  Larry Bird  (Len Bias)  Reggie Lewis  Paul Pierce  Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown (probably his natural position)
Jaylen Brown  Jayson Tatum  Marcus Smart  Tristan Thompson  Grant Williams  Peyton Pritchard  Kemba Walker
"I love Jaylen and was one of the few people that liked the pick at the time. He is simply not a better player than Tatum on either end. Brown is a perfect second option type, but Tatum stabilizes the whole team on both ends when he's in. Just look at their on/offs or advanced stats."
Jaylen Brown just role player hot shooting comparing him to Tatum just so stupid Celtics can‚Äôt be even win game without Tatum
I thought the refs agree to start calling it an offensive foul after seeing the Jaylen Brown one lol
Jaylen Brown just gets overshadowed.  He is a legitimate star player. He has potential to be a top 10-15 guy in the NBA. But he's slept on and always in Tatum's shadows. He's been our best player since the season started.  Jaylen Brown is coming.
"Lol take off the bias goggles. I agree that it should be an offensive foul league wide, but in the context of the moment, Stewart just ran him over. Did Brown invite the contact? Definitely. But if we‚Äôre being consistent with the Trae stuff, then Stewart should‚Äôve been whistled, not Jaylen."
"The Celtics have a great history with Small Forward/wing players.  Havlicek, Cedric Maxwell, Larry Bird, Reggie Lewis (RIP), Paul Pierce and now Jaylen Brown &amp; Jayson Tatum."
"Yeah but wouldn't you rather have Mo Bamba instead of Jaylen Brown.  I mean Jaylen Brown is an All Star caliber player, but Mo Bamba can be anything.  He can even be an All Star caliber player (If your blindfolded.)"
"how are they getting superstars without trading tatum or brown? lmao.  The biggest misconception in basketball is that Ainge never pulls the trigger. He only pulls the trigger on the right deals.  When people mention ""He didn't trade for jimmy butler or paul george!"" they would have been trading the jaylen AND Tatum picks - which would have been TERRRRRRIBLE trades. The only somewhat questionable non-trade is Kawi but even that would have been Jaylen for 1 year of Kawhi, which very likely wouldn't have worked."
Oh my god. They called a foul on Jaylen because Isaiah Stewart wasn‚Äôt even playing defense on him. He wasn‚Äôt on his hip chasing him like Rivers. He was literally walking down the court to get to the low post and Brown had to jump a few feet to the side to even touch him. Rivers is right on top of Trae here. It‚Äôs completely different
Is it a hot take to say I think Jaylen Brown is better than Tatum and that maybe he was even better last year but Tatum gets the shine for being a closer.
"Tap the advanced stats page on bballref. If you still don‚Äôt get it, Brogdon vs Jaylen Brown  That‚Äôs a fine take, don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs because Pritchard looked better in 7 games and it‚Äôs not even a discussion. FWIW I had the same issue with Sixers fans and Thybulle last year."
Nah this isn't the regular shitty content we usually get. Jaylen Brown is a beast
I see that you considered Jaylen Brown
Tobias Harris winning player of the week over Jaylen Brown
"If I were a Rockets fan I would rather have Jaylen Brown over Ben Simmons and that's not something I would have said a month ago at all. However, Brown isn't getting traded now, he seems to have taken the leap and as a Celtics fan I don't want him gone. A month ago I would have been fine giving him up for Harden, but not anymore."
Steph   Christian Wood   Lamelo    Jaylen Brown     Lebron     Soxers vs lakers      Lakers
"MVP - Jaylen Brown MIP - Jaylen Brown ROTY - Jaylen Brown DPOTY - Jaylen Brown FMVP - Jaylen Brown EOTY - You guessed it, Jaylen Brown"
You think that's the reason Stevens didn't play anyone 42+ minutes? Both Barrett and Randle are averaging more minutes than Jaylen Brown has played in *any* game this season. Tatum has only topped 38 minutes once.  You can make all the excuses you want for Thibs. The fact is this is a long established pattern for him. He pushes guys too hard. He did this in Chicago. He did it in Minnesota. He's doing it again with the Knicks.
Joel Embiid  Jaylen Brown (prolly a stretch)  Wiseman (but my heart says P rabbit)  Embiid  Lebron  Lakers vs Nets  Nets
"Most of it is just team composure.  When you build around guys like Horford and Hayward, you're building a team first offense because that's how those guys play best.  But back when IT was running the show, Stevens had zero issues letting him put up 30 every night.  Now?  This team is simply built around Tatum and Jaylen.  Everybody else on the roster is either there to shoot, play big, or feed those two.  No more Horfords or Haywards who bring value by distributing the ball from non-dominant positions.  Going to be interesting to see what happens when Kemba comes back.  Best thing for the Celtics is he does what Pritchard did last night - put up a yeoman's 18 points a night and draw attention away from Tatum/Brown.  Worst thing will be if he tries to get 25 every night and the offense loses its identity because of it."
I feel like anyone would have been overrated\* compared to Jaylen Brown before the season started.
That's funny you mentioned that. I was saying in a comment the other day how Tatum is so over hyped strictly in comparison to Jaylen Brown
"The Celtics were without Kemba, Smart, Teague, Langford, and Green last night. Jaylen Brown led the team with 33 minutes.  This is a Thibs thing."
Really? Because Jaylen Brown was on the front page yesterday with a far less egregious play and he was called for an offensive foul. That's literally all they need to start doing- punish them for drawing bullshit like this.   If Jaylen got the reffing Trae gets he'd be the MVP favorite right now.
They called it an offensive foul on Jaylen Brown but Trae gets FTs. Ludicrous.
Remember when this same play was called as an offensive foul on Jaylen Brown 2 days ago and everyone said Trae would never be called the same way?
Call it an offensive like they did to Jaylen Brown against the Pistons
... And now they‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs an offensive foul on Jaylen Brown.
"Tobias Harris, Jaylen Brown, and Julius Randle are the top three imo"
"Jaylen Brown is the easiest answer. Tobias Harris will regress somewhat, even PG isn‚Äôt this good."
Jaylen Brown and Collin Sexton
my boy jaylen brown but he still gonna be nice
PG-Westbrook  SG-Jaylen Brown  SF-Jimmy Butler  PF-Draymond Green  C-KAT
"Jaylen Brown was way less valuable in their first run.  PG was the guy on those teams.  Averaged 19 - 7 -5 in 2013 playoffs, 23 - 8 - 4 in the 2014 playoffs.   You can prefer the Jays if you like but the receipts answered your trash comment:  &gt;What exactly has Pandemic P accomplished? That guy‚Äôs demeanor and attitude is pathetic. He‚Äôs never gonna win anything."
This man right here hasn't considered Jaylen Brown
Tbh even the  Jaylen Brown/ Siakam debate is over. At this point we‚Äôre gonna soon have the Marcus smart/Siakam debate lmao
He was probably more pissed that he was pulled in the first place. What‚Äôs the point if yanking him and letting Jaylen Brown continue to play? They‚Äôre both the franchise
Is ~~Jayson Tatum~~ ~~Jaylen Brown~~ Payton Pritchard better than Siakam?
the real next Kawhi was the friends we made along the way  kidding of course it's Jaylen Brown
They called a foul on Jaylen Brown for it last game. So apparently you can call it an offensive foul.  Edit: it also got challenged and they upheld it.
Why the fuck is Jaylen Brown still in the game but Tatum can‚Äôt go for 50????
jaylen brown couldnt miss if he tried right now
Jaylen Brown has 7 points and we're still getting cheesed
Any Raptor: Uses Spin Move  Jaylen Brown: How many times do I have to teach you this lesson
Kyrie Irving  Jaylen Brown  Gordon Hayward  Jayson Tatum  Al Horford
Jaylen Brown got robbed.
Jaylen Brown?
You have Jaylen Brown over Tobias Harris...  Did you even watch basketball this week???
"Outside of the players you mentioned, I think Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, John Collins and Brandon Ingram would play. Myles Tuner or James Wiseman would be solid if USA needed more depth at Center."
Pascal v Jaylen Brown 2020
"SG Jaylen Brown, BI, Hayward, Middleton."
I have no idea where Brad Stevens came up with this theory that it would be a good idea to put Jaylen Brown on Duncan Robinson.......but it wasnt and it just highlighted alot of his defensive limitations the first two games especially they went at him that ECF.
"He is also one of the few analysts that loved Jaylen Brown as a prospect. He's like any analyst, he has his hits and his misses.    He can be an arrogant dick and he digs his heels in on his takes pretty firmly and when he's wrong he is VERY wrong, but he's absolutely not an idiot."
I honestly don't see how Jaylen Brown can be ahead of Ingram
"I got called racist for criticizing Kyrie as a teammate, or regarding team chemistry. Even though Jaylen Brown is my favorite player right now, in large part because of his off the court work in the social justice movement.  But people see a Celtic flair and they see someone being critical, and they're just like ""yup, you're a racist!""   Fuck racists. Just let me enjoy the fact that Kyrie isn't on the Celtics"
"No one on that particular team is really going to call him out directly a it just wasn‚Äôt in their make up. Jaylen Brown is a pretty cerebral guy, and you could tell on several occasions how frustrated he was with him, particular during his post game interviews."
"Bad take, the Cs were up 72-71 with 6 minutes left and lost 87-79. They gave up 13 points in a little over 5 minutes before they started intentional fouling (the last 3 points for the Cavs). They shot like total shit as a collective in those 6 minutes too.  Smart was 0-1 from 3, and 1-2 from the line  Horford was 0-2, including 0-1 from 3  Marcus Morris was 1-3, including 0-2 from 3, and 1-2 from the line   Rozier was 0-2 from 3  Tatum was 0-1  Jaylen was 1-2 from 3.  That's 2-11 from the field, including 1-7 from 3 if you're counting. And 2-4 at the line for what it's worth.  For the game, Brown was 3-12 and Rozier was 0-10 from 3. 3-22 between them isn't gonna cut it.  The 6 extra free throws the Cavs got (25 vs 19) was not the difference maker, especially since 4 of those foul shots were intentional fouls. The real number is 21 vs 19."
"It's a lot of Boston and Philly fans. The Boston ones hate the fact that some people dared say Siakam was better than Jaylen Brown, and Philly because, well, they're Philly fans."
"I got Jaylen brown , smart , derozan , davis ,  bam and dragic  in my lineup.   So basically those are half of my team which won't be playing today due to covid.  Not a good start to this week for me . At lest I am 2-1"
"I hate how this tag only gets thrown on Siakam. Is Bam, Jaylen Brown, Ingram, Booker, Simmons that guy either?"
"Celtics need to start losing, so they can get desperate and trade us Jaylen Brown and maybe two picks.  I know C's fans hate the idea but I personally love it. He's the only young player in the NBA I would be happy with replacing Harden with (that *might be* realistically traded). So take it as a compliment to your guy lmao"
"based only on games played so far, i‚Äôll go with   **EAST**   G1: Bradley Beal  G2: Zach Lavine  G3: Malcolm Brogdon  G4: Jaylen Brown  FC1: Joel Embiid  FC2: Giannis Antetokounmpo   FC3: Kevin Durant  FC4: Jayson Tatum  FC5: Domantas Sabonis  FC6: Khris Middleton  WC1: Julius Randle  WC2: Nikola Vucevic   **WEST**  G1: James Harden  G2: Stephen Curry  G3: Damian Lillard  G4: CJ McCollum  FC1: Nikola Jokic  FC2: LeBron James  FC3: Kawhi Leonard  FC4: Paul George  FC5: Anthony Davis   FC6: Brandon Ingram  WC1: Luka Doncic   WC2: DeMar DeRozan  honorable mentions for jerami grant, trae young, collin sexton, tobias harris, gordon hayward, bam adebayo, shai gilgeous-alexander, devin booker, and anyone i forgot"
Jaylen Brown Jayson Tatum and Gordon Hayward
" Alright so looking through last years picks I think the players that look most likely to miss out this year in the East are:      - Kemba.   - Pascal.   - Lowry.   - Simmons (injury and poor form).      You can replace them with KD, Beal, Lavine and Jaylen Brown.        Looking through last years picks I think the players that look most likely to miss out this year in the West are:      - Westbrook.   - Paul.   - Gobert.       You can replace them with PG13, Curry and Derozan.      ----      Some dark horse contenders at this stage include Brogdon, Hayward, Tobias, CJ, Zion, Vucevic, Randle, Sexton and Grant."
jaylen brown tatum
"He is still slightly better than Brown. Better passer, better team defender, better ball handler, and equally good scorer. Celtics fans always downvote me for saying this but he's just a phenomenal player. I hope Jaylen can continue to elevate his game and surpass Hayward soon."
Siakam playing horrible has a lot to do with Jaylen Brown clamping his ass. Gasol was negative because he got shred by Kemba of PnR   Celtics just had no answer for zone defense. And Kemba got clamped from box n 1.. they also missed Hayward being the better play maker on the floor
Jaylen Brown in shambles
"I mean with the rise of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, unless Gordon was truly happy with being a forth option, or even third if Kemba gets traded, the fit was never going to be great. 3 wings is great but someone is going to have to guard tall athletic 4s like AD, Christian Wood and etc. and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going to work long term."
"They used to say Jaylen Brown was like a young Michael Jordan, now they say Michael Jordan is like a slightly lesser version of Jaylen Brown."
"&gt;I‚Äôd put my money on someone like Mitchell, PG, Jimmy or Jaylen Brown before them with how the early season is going.  Here its PG first than Jaylen second. The Jimmy and Mitchell haven't been really playing that well so far"
"What about Simmons, jaylen brown, cj, Jamal Murray, cp3, Lowry, Mitchell, Shai, Paul George, ja. Not saying they‚Äôll make it but they all have at least a chance"
"I'm pretty ecstatic with how Jaylen Brown has stepped up so far, and also with the addition of Pritchard"
Yeah it makes no sense for you guys. Like just because he‚Äôs more talented offensively than Jaylen Brown doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll be a seamless fit. Better to build with Tatum and Brown for the next decade or so than trade JB for a couple years of Harden
CJ isnt better than jaylen brown
Did anyone text you in the bubble claiming to be Jaylen Brown?
he's been eating his wheaties so he can be big and strong like his dad Jaylen Brown
"Steph, Dame, Harden, Luka, Booker, and either Trae or Lavine depending on who can get closer to the playoffs. But I‚Äôd put my money on someone like Mitchell, PG, Jimmy or Jaylen Brown before them with how the early season is going."
\#allstarszn! It's time. I think the East All-Stars right now should/would be (in no particular order):  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * Khris Middleton * Kyrie Irving * Joel Embiid * Malcolm Brogdon * Kevin Durant * Seth Curry * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Jaylen Brown * Jayson Tatum * Julius Randle
"mid range gods... jaylen brown, kd, kawhi, kobe etc"
Jaylen Brown?
Jaylen Brown will take Kemba‚Äôs spot
Y‚Äôall have Jaylen brown. Boss on and off the court.
He deserved most improved in 2018 in my opinion. People talk about how jaylen brown has gotten better linearly every year but so has this guy.
"And now, with the cap increase, guys like Rozier, Fultz, and Hield are getting that. No disrespect to those guys, but Zach is clearly on another level compared to them.  This sub also shat all over the Jaylen Brown extension, look how that‚Äôs going"
"Because for the most part NBA rookies are teenagers and MLB rookies are grown men. Devin Williams was a 25 year old rookie who had spent a lot of time developing in the minor leagues. He's older than Jokic, Tatum, Luka, Jaylen Brown, Donovan Mitchell, and is the same age as Giannis. You really can't compare a baseball rookie to other sports rookies.  Baseball rookies can even play a year in the majors and still be called rookies if they're called up late enough it's really not the same."
"nope not at all its more about you just being wrong and not facing facts. Stop being so senstive.  Who is pushing Jaylen brown, donovan mitchell, Cp3, etc to speak up. You just want to push your own narrative buddy its clear."
The captol stuff took over the news but this still made sports center and first take. I think you have to make a grand gesture esp after highly impactful events and rulings like the Blake ruling. The doc rivers. Jaylen brown. Lebron stuff hits because those guys a household names (jaylen to a lesser extent) but im not so.sure folks want to hear what Mason plumlee has to say about black lives matter.
The only one I remember from last year is a memorable one. It‚Äôs the one he hit on Jaylen Brown to close the game against the Celtics.
Why do you have to hurt me like this? I already know Edwards has been awful.  Now watch this be the game where he finally goes off for 8-11 on 3PAs and my one friend who still believes in him tries to brag about being right after he called Jaylen Brown awful for 3 years while I constantly defended him. I can already tell this bullshit is gonna happen.
Jaylen Brown maybe from the Celtics.
"Yeah, it's hard to use stats like that when Brown has literally been winning games for Celtics and the triple double guy is in dead last place. Also, Beal wasn't in playoff contention last year, that's why he wasn't in the all star game. Jaylen Brown has had a way better year than Westbrook, numbers aren't everything"
"I got morant injured as well and jaylen brown will possibly be out due to contact tracing, this fantasy season is tough so far lol"
"Does he make it over Ben Simmons, Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, or Bradley Beal?"
"Jaylen Brown and Payton Pritchard have both really impressed defensively. Jaylen has made big improvements and Payton is one of the better defending rookies I‚Äôve seen in recent memory.  The rest of the team hasn‚Äôt looked as hot, though that‚Äôs partly because we‚Äôre still experimenting with some weird lineups."
What about Jaylen Brown? He‚Äôs been incredible this season
Jaylen Brown deserves to be somewhere in this. Dude is popping off
Jaylen Brown is definitely making an All-NBA team at this rate.
I would move the Celtics into the contenders with Jaylen Brown playing like an all-star this year along with Tatum and Kemba when he gets healthy
"Last season had a lot of players make it for the first time, it seems unlikely to have a bunch more again  But actually projecting, not just based on season so far  West:   Projected: None  Contenders: CJ McCollum, Zion, Murray, Wood  CJ has been playing really well, but I'm not highly confident that at 29 he'll suddenly maintain the kind of shooting he's had so far. Zion has been playing well, but will need to be even better to have a chance, especially with Ingram on his team. Murray has also been playing really well, but guards have a lot of competition and I'm just not sure if it's enough, especially with another better all-star player on his team. Wood has the numbers, and if Harden leaves he has a good chance, but if he's still there I wouldn't bet on it   East:   Projected: Jaylen Brown, Malcolm Brogdon  Jaylen is playing fantastically, and without Kemba I think he'll get a lot of credit. Brogdon is also playing very well on the new Pacers, who are also playing very well. Jaylen is a much more clear pick than Brogdon  Contenders: Julius Randle, Zach Lavine, Jerami Grant  I think all three (especially Randle) are playing above their weight at the moment, the Knicks won't maintain anything like the 6th seed, and the Pistons suck. But it is the east and there seem like clear spots to be won, and they all have great 3 number splits so I could easily see at least one of them getting a spot"
yall have Jaylen Brown at home
Jaylen Brown most likely
&gt; I can't imagine why anyone didn't think Jaylen Brown would at least not be a future All-Star.  Feels like one too many negations %-]
"Christian wood, jaylen brown and Zion"
"Hasn‚Äôt Mitchell been a slow starter so far during his career? Gotta give it another month before he gets it going.  Popular opinions will always go with Tatum since he plays in Boston where there‚Äôs a lot of sports mediaheads. I mean, we already got people calling Jaylen Brown a superstar after 10 games. Lol  One thing is certain for me in terms of Tatum vs Mitchell, Mitchell has had two incredible signature playoff series (OKC W, Denver L) that I don‚Äôt think Tatum has matched yet."
If jaylen brown gets cleared and can play they can win games. If th aren't they are fucked until the next game where thompson and grant williams come back
I heard Jaylen Brown might get cleared
"100%.  This smells of 2016. Apparently, people at the time thought it was a ""weak"" class, but it ended up producing some amazing starter-caliber players. Siakam, Brogdon, Simmons, Murray (Jamal and Dejonte both), Sabonis, Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Hield, LeVert, Zubac, and so on. Heck, Fred VanVleet and Dorian Finney-Smith were *undrafted* that year."

Jaylen Brown is 24!?
"This comment is funny as fuck because I watch both Jaylen Brown and James Harden on a fairly consistent basis. Plus it literally took me five minutes to write so it‚Äôs not like it even took a long time out of my day. If you‚Äôre gonna come at me at least tell me where you think I‚Äôm wrong? Oh right, you can‚Äôt. Like even in these past 9 games where Jaylen has played top notch, Harden has STILL been better."
I can't imagine why anyone didn't think Jaylen Brown would at least not be a future All-Star.  He came in to the league very raw and basically improved every year (except maybe the Kyrie year).
Are we though. Jaylen and Tatum are good together. Brown will get more shots but also get focused on defence like crazy.
Jaylen brown mvp tour
"I don't know man, Jaylen Brown is just as good if not slightly better."
Jaylen Brown fantasy owners are bout to be hyped.
jaylen brown aka michael jordan will carry them
The Jaylen Brown show is going to be in full effect
Jaylen Brown is taking 40 shots in one of these games the next two weeks
I like the idea I just wouldn‚Äôt want it on the mainstream; I wouldn‚Äôt want some random defensive highlights to outshadow Jaylen Brown having a 40-piece that night or something.  But if there was something like a YouTube channel or ESPN show dedicated to showing defensive highlights that‚Äôd be awesome and I‚Äôd totally tune in.  (Speaking of which here was a YouTube channel that used to do something similar to this called ‚ÄúDefenseWinsChampionships‚Äù but they‚Äôve stopped as far as I know)
"Still FVV guards wings+guards , Jaylen Brown got locked up. On defense might as well label him as a wing. I'd argue that his playmaking is not anything above decent as well"
"After the first game of the season, I traded Hayward and Grant for Jaylen Brown and Jrue Holiday ü§£"
I remember a lot of Celtics fans wanted us to take Dunn over Jaylen Brown
"Speaking of facial hair, Jaylen Brown deserves some recognition. Now if he went back to the flat top AND had the rick ross beard, he'd be a leading candidate for hair mvp."
"Jaylen Brown was/is better than Kemba  Brogdan is as good of a pick as Sabonis. If healthy  Middleton was rightfully an all-star, but Beal is light years ahead tbh"
Jaylen Brown too
Jaylen brown taking another step this year has been fun to watch
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown become the worst pair of teammates in the last 20 seasons to each record 250+ points in their teams first 10 games.
"The question isn't what those guys were doing at the same age or if Zion or Jaylen Brown or Mitchell or Giannis will be the best.   I was just raising questions about what it would take in terms of surrounding pieces to create a championship contender. It seems really difficult to find great playmaking, center defense, and spacing all at the same time, all of which you would need to surround him with.   The reason you need an elite defensive center(not just competent) is because Zion occupies a really important position on defense as a PF and doesn't seem to have the defensive iq or foot speed to be strong in that area. You need elite playmaking because Zion himself is not a heliocentric, ball handling, offense dictating force. He has above average iq but he's not suddenly going to get Luka level passing. And then obviously you need a ton of spacing because he doesn't have outside shooting and his game is wholly paint based. It's not like he has a good shooting touch but just hasn't put it together on the NBA level either, as evidenced by his form and free throw percentages.   All in all, I'm just saying that it seems difficult for a team in a market that isn't naturally the most attractive location wise to get enough quality pieces to create a championship contender around him.  Ingram and Mitchell or Ingram and a budding two way all star theoretically feels like it would be much easier to build around, as Ingram is growing into a great playmaker and is above average defensively. And additionally, does not require a ton of spacing to operate."

Jaylen Brown and i'm not even biased (i am)
"If we're considering individual stats and team record then the top 4 in no particular order should be Embiid, Jaylen Brown, LeBron and Steph"
Front runner for MIP is definitely Jaylen Brown
"Jaylen Brown for Bradley, who says no?"
Jaylen Brown game-high 13 rebounds üëÄ
That is Sir Jaylen Brown
when I mutated.. i definitely had Jaylen Brown in mind.
Why does Marcus insist on taking the shots when jaylen Brown and Jason Tatum fucking exist

Jaylen Brown put the blade in BEYBLADE.
Jaylen Brown is also the best player in the NBA
Jaylen Brown is a top 10 player in the NBA
Jaylen Brown clearly bought VC this offseason
Two years ago Simmons advocated for trading Jaylen Brown to Dallas for a first round pick.
"How do the Celtics play tonight without their frontcourt guys? Are we gonna see some super small ball with Jaylen Brown at the 5? Walker just got cleared to practice today, but Pritchard has really been lights out so far. He's got some time to ease himself back into it."
"I love Jaylen Brown (probably my favorite Celtic) he is an all-star and an extremely smart dude but I don‚Äôt see him becoming a superstar. There is no way you don‚Äôt take a Brown, Smart, and picks trade for Harden. Harden is a top 5 SG of ALL TIME. He has an 11 assist season and MULTIPLE 30+ point seasons. The only other players to do that in ALL OF NBA HISTORY are Oscar Robertson and Tiny Archibald, 2 inner circle hall of famers. Jaylen Brown is a great player and an all star who is still developing but expecting him to get anywhere near Harden is an absolute fever dream. People are saying ‚Äúoh but in 4 years Harden will be washed‚Äù but sports medicine has improved dramatically recently and Harden was never a player who relied on overwhelming athleticism, his game is much more finesse and shooting oriented (skills less impacted by age). Furthermore, you don‚Äôt plan for 4 years in the future since that‚Äôs a fucking long time in sports, injuries happen and people leave so there is no guarantee the C‚Äôs will be better in 4 years than now. Plus with Giannis‚Äô extension they will still have to compete with him and the Bucks in the East and Luka in the West and those teams could also feasibly get better in 4 years."
"Jazz fans want Harden out of the west so bad /s  Seriously though, this seems like an L for Houston. I'm hoping the Celtics start losing and trade us Jaylen Brown. I think I would rather have MPJ over Simmons, yeah, but I don't know..."
"agreed.  BTW I don't really buy any Harden-to-Boston buzz.  The Celtics are a fashionable team to throw into these scenarios because they have young stars/coveted assets (more so when they had extra picks but they still have Brown/Tatum/Smart) and Danny is known as a ruthless trader (for good reason). Leaking rumors about Boston's involvement helps Houston's leverage to maximize a return from elsewhere, if they can act like Jaylen Brown &amp; Marcus Smart are on the table that might put pressure on another team to improve their offer."
"Definetly Jaylen Brown, far more complete and consistent"
"Frankly its better than not letting these posts happen.  People want to talk about it and the NBA is clearly signaling that they want to have a voice in the conversation.  So let‚Äôs talk about it.  Im sure guys like Jaylen Brown would want the basketball community, online or otherwise, to be involved in dialogue.   Yes we will get trolls and brigadiers but thats the expected price to pay."
"If you can get over the irish thing - Boston Celtics.   Look up Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Tako Fall - most well rounded young trio in the league."
"Such a good point. His agent‚Äôs name is Jason Glushon and the list of other players he represents or once did is interesting - Joe Johnson, Al Horford, Jrue Holiday, and Jaylen Brown are his 4 big contracts all over $100 mil. He also represents Dinwiddie who just signed that $32 mil Bitcoin contract. All his other clients look to be vet min guys but hard to believe he never got Jeff Green paid more."
"Denzel Washington‚Äôs son looks like Jaylen Brown with a pointy face, that‚Äôs a big life win for JB.  *ballers intro*"
Tatum is playing better than Luka and Jaylen Brown becomes most overrated player
Butler should not be on this list. Jaylen Brown should probably be higher
Malcolm Brogdon won Rory with 10/2/4 averages. Jaylen Brown and Brandon Ingram failed to score in double digits that same season so that 2017 rookie class comes to mind.
&gt; Jaylen Brown has a better beard than Harden and that‚Äôs a fact.  This is content that I subscribe for
I fucking despise how much I love Jaylen Brown.
Why did jaylen brown and Marcus smart just ignore pritchard afterward?
Jaylen Brown is absolutely ridiculous now.
Brandon Ingram rookie year: 9.4 ppg on 47% TS  Jaylen Brown rookie year: 6.6 ppg on 54% TS  he's got some time
"If you replace Lavine with Draymond, Jaylen Brown, Sabonis we are more 4-11 than  7-8, Ben Simmons maybe 6-9 tops. Lavine being able to score at 3 levels is worth more than Simmons defense"
He‚Äôs really improved his jumper and post moves. Sometimes he looks a bit sleepy on D but if he averages 30+ ppg I‚Äôll take it.  Jaylen Brown has a better beard than Harden and that‚Äôs a fact.
I‚Äôm taking solace in Jaylen brown being the best player on the court tonight
Embiid with the LeFuckYou three lmao. Awesome game from Jaylen Brown. Gotta be on the short list for MIP
"embiid is awesome but we already knew that  but holy fuck Jaylen Brown is a god damn PROBLEM now, his handle and shot just keep getting better"
Jaylen Brown deserved more help than he got tonight. Without Tatum we just don't have enough offense.
Jaylen Brown doesn‚Äôt get considered nearly enough
Jaylen Brown rules
FUCK YOU EMBID! HAVE YOU CONSIDERED JAYLEN FUCKING BROWN
Where is Rob Fischer to tell Jaylen Brown to lick it and stick it if his contacts fall out
Simmons said no to jaylen brown helping him up üòÇ
Really Jaylen Brown of him
Ben Simmons why are you not Jaylen Brown
I had a dream last night that Jaylen Brown broke Wilt's single game record by scoring 132 points so I think it's safe to say he might be an MVP candidate
Why are we forcing the ball to Korkmaz when Jaylen Brown is guarding him that‚Äôs literally a turnover every time
Jaylen Brown this season has become a very complete player
joel intentionally and skillfully draws contact while marcus smart and jaylen brown throwing themselves to the ground
"I dont think hed ask for a trade at all, but i think it could be a case where they sort of ended up with split timelines.  Curry will be 33, i know age impacts him less than most, but when the other key pieces of your team are Draymond and Klay (will both be 31 and coming off varying injuries) and you are pairing them with 19 yo Wiseman, and 25 yo Wiggins, it may feel like purgatory. Not quite good enough, but not quite bad enough.  If they could trade Curry for someone like say Jaylen Brown (made up the value, its just for example sake), then it would ""sync"" their timeline backup. They then have a young core that they can improve with and add pieces to. Similar to what Jaylen went through with Boston his first few years.       They dont have to tank by any means, but between all the money they spent in Durant era and their aging core it may be the best for both sides"
I understand that but Edwards was drafted as a raw athletic prospect (similar to Jaylen Brown).
"Even when not at full force, you still have lineups that probably could end up a top 2 seed in either conference. The much maligned world cup team from last time could have a starting lineup of Kemba Walker, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton, and Myles Turner with a pretty solid bench. They may not have the upper-end star power to match the elite teams, but that's a damn good lineup if given time to fully gel."
Jaylen brown?
Jaylen Brown
"Yeah Shaq was attempting to rile up Donavan and get a soundbite. It was a terrible premise and Donavan was super smart to ignore it.   Shaq tried to recover when he went into ""I've heard that since forever, I'm playin my game ---""   Shaq cut him off and said that's what I want to hear.   Like you're saying best way to do that is more or less be nice.   If your point is ""what's next?"" just say, Okay you got this far, last year you hit a wall a teammate got hurt. What's next? What's stopping you from winning a championship this year? What's stopping you from being the best player in the league?  I mean it was a weird convo because they were harping on Gobert's numbers being low... Mitchell's numbers haven't jumped at all. The eye test might be saying something different but Beal, Lavine, Jaylen Brown, Booker all look like better SG's and they're in his age range and that's still avoiding the older guys, Harden, Klay (injured), McCollum etc.   They were talking to him like he could be a top-5 guy this year. Idk if that's possible."
"Jaylen Brown definitely texted him after like ‚Äúbro don‚Äôt let them get to you. I‚Äôm here if you need to talk. I still think about the bubble and I wish we could just go back there and just...be‚Äù   Ok not like that, but something like that"
"Not really into favorites, but I do have players that I like to watch all around, besides the obvious ones I'd say Jordan Clarkson, Jaylen Brown, Draymond, Jeff Green, Jeremi Grant  From the new players I liked Quickley a lot and also Cole Anthony since their games against the Cavs."
Jaylen Brown looks really strong and has developed a lot as a player but also fuck you
"Brother behind James Harden, Beal is the second best 2 gaurd right now followed by Devin booker at 3, CJ McCollum at 4, Jaylen Brown at 5,  Middleton at 6. Even tho Middleton is playing as a 3 he‚Äôs really a 2."
"I think that Harden - Irving - Beal - Durant - Giannis - Embiid - Bam are all locks. That's only 8 players.   For the other 7 players I think that Simmons - Trae - Jrue - Lavine - Middleton - Tatum are also pretty likely to get in.  For the last player, either Vicevic, Sabonis, Jaylen Brown or Brogdan would be worthy selections."
Hard not to like Jaylen Brown
based jaylen brown
Klay has decent handles. He has enough handles to make the separation for his jumpshots. He just isn't as flashy and fast as the upper tier like Paul George or Jaylen Brown.
"""Wiggins‚Äô on-ball defense has opponents shooting 40.0 percent, better than such respected defenders as Oklahoma City‚Äôs Luguentz Dort (43.3), Boston‚Äôs Jaylen Brown (43.5) and Toronto‚Äôs Pascal Siakam (44.0).  On shots from 15 feet or further, where many wings thrive, the failure rate against Wiggins is 67.4 percent, roughly the same as Los Angeles Lakers star Anthony Davis (67.5) and better than Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard (61.4) and Portland‚Äôs 3-and-D wing Robert Covington (59.3). The failure rate against Mavericks forward Dorian Finney-Smith, considered a ‚Äúdefensive specialist,‚Äù is 63.9.""  Also has the highest contest rate for warriors  For all the people in sub wanting to check the stats .He really has had a good start to the campaign"
Someday everyone will find out that Tatum is a fraud and it‚Äôs really jaylen brown who is THAT dude.
Luka has 7.5 FTs per game and leads the league in drives with 24.6  Tatum has 3.6 FTs per game and has 12.9 drives.  Jaylen brown has 4.7 FTs per game and has 10.8 drives.   FTs just doesnt appear out of nowhere.Brown getting more FTs then Luka if u compare how much they drive.Stop being biased.
Giving up Oubre in place for Jaylen Brown at the 2 makes us about as close to whole as we‚Äôd be without Klay. Center would have to be by committee again though
"I generally like Keith Smith on Twitter, and the Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown combo is great! I worry about the Kemba contract, but their young depth pieces are interesting.     Sixers are so intriguing, because they're built the way 2016-2018 OKC should have been built so I may have to give them a try. Thanks!"
I have hated the Celtics for four decades and I think Jaylen Brown might be the first guy who eludes my ire.
"Not only should Jaylen Brown be a lock for the game, and not only should he have been in *last year's* game, but at this point I think he should start over Kyrie."
James Harden   Bradley Beal   Trae Young   Zach Lavine  Kevin Durant   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Jayson Tatum   Domantas Sabonis  Joel Embiid   Nikola Vucevic  Jaylen Brown   Bam Adebayo  My tiebreakers were based on winning and stuff like whether they actually show up to work.
How is Jaylen Brown not listed here?
"As a nets fan, they've traded away the draft rights to:  Dame Lillard (Gerald Wallace)  James Young (Paul Pierce/KG)  Jaylen Brown (Paul Pierce/KG)  Jayson Tatum (Paul Pierce/KG)  Collin Sexton (Paul PIerce/KG)  and now.... they traded 7 picks/swaps in the future... Yes they have 3 of the top 20 NBA players *right now* but if they don't go to the finals or win a ring, they're getting blown up in 2 years.  I don't even want to know what will happen with those picks if that's the case..."
"&gt;Evan Fournier - I think he gives you 80% of what Jaylen Brown does  Fournier is off to a good start, but this is still an absolutely absurd take. He‚Äôs mostly a spot up shooter that plays below average to bad defense. Brown is a top 20 player in the league. They aren‚Äôt in the same universe."
Jaylen Brown is for real man.  Celtics got a good one.
Caris LeVert - Highest ceiling out of anyone on here but meh from 3-point land and injury concerns   Evan Fournier - Always been high on him; I think he gives you 80% of what Jaylen Brown does   Bogdan Bogdanovic - Solid as your secondary ballhandler but having a down year and defense isn't great  Hard to rank the last 3 guys: Eric Gordon / Danny Green / Gary Harris. All of them are decent defenders but streaky shooters.
Jaylen Brown &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dwight currently.
"&gt; In the last 5 minutes Jaylen and Kemba combined 0/6 including multiple wide open looks  I just rewatched the last 8 minutes or so after Embiid re-entered the game. You went 5-15 with 4 TO's, scored 10 points.  Jaylen got one wide-open look from the top of the arc with 1 minute left. Pritchard got another open one off-the dribble with 7 minutes left from the left wing. The two-three other open looks you got were all inside the arc after a fast-break or a loose ball scramble, which is understandable. We also got away with 2 fouls IMO, so that has to be said too.  All in all, I thought we played phenomenal defense down the stretch and didn't allow much. We repeatedly forced Brown into contested mid-rangers and defended Kemba's PnR play as well as anyone could."
[Jaylen Brown delivered a great speech at Harvard and touched on the matter.](https://youtu.be/QK-4gO5I1Dg?t=248)    The forum is over an hour long but his speech is about 19 minutes.
"Jaylen brown drove, got swarmed and got grabbed in the 4th. Kemba got pushed on a drive, no call. Smart was in the act of shooting, but it got called a floor foul.  You guys won, but this statement sounds dumb as hell. Advantageous. A lot of the time it isn‚Äôt advantageous to foul but we sure as fuck did it a lot tonight."
"Jaylen Brown has put in that work to get to this point. He might be a Celtic, but I got nothing but love and respect for him. He entered the NBA insanely raw. Shot sub-30% from deep at Cal, and generally looked more like an athlete playing basketball, which considering his HS pedigree was a disappointment.  It‚Äôs stunning to see how good his handle and shot are now versus his one year in college. I just wish he wouldn‚Äôt do this sort of shit against us"
Yeah... having one of the worst TS% as a PF in the entire league sure warrants that. Judt explain to me how he was better than Middleton Ingram or Jaylen Brown for that matter...
I love me some jaylen brown highlights
"&gt;Jason ""tunnel vision"" Tatum  &gt;Kemba 'One Knee left, soon will need a"" Walker  &gt;Jaylen 'Anti-clutch' Brown"
Someone find me a 4th Jaylen Brown assist
"I would LOVE for you to actually address the main point of what I'm saying instead of condescendingly assuming we ""don't know the rules"", which is that Theis call is called but Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, and Marcus Smart are driving and not getting foul calls. Celts shot 21% from the paint. You're saying that was all clean and good?  I've said from the beginning this is a consistency argument."
kemba walker constantly bitching team btw jaylen brown constantly bitching team btw
giving Jaylen Brown a wide open 3 in crunch time is the defense I like to see
Because your superstars of Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart are deserving...
Jaylen Brown is my dad.
The Sixers will be considering Jaylen Brown after that one
Anybody think Jaylen Brown can pass up Tatum?
"Jaylen Brown has that Kobe, Jordan look.  Hope he puts it together, he could be a star in his own right"
Jaylen Brown is filthy
You mean Jaylen Brown*
"""Not going to argue"" and then throwing around insults lmaoooo, if you genuinely think vucevic is a bigger star then Jaylen Brown, Ingram, Fox, and Kemba YOU need your head checked"
That's not really an appropriate comparison since Kuzma isn't a lottery pick and performed more than what was expected from him so far.  A good comparison is asking whether having Jaylen Brown or Brandon Ingram would've been better
"Not with a player like Simmons.  We don‚Äôt need elite rebounders or playmakers.  We need franchise cornerstones. Simmons is not that guy and will prolly never be that guy.  If it was Jaylen Brown or MPJ, then sure"
"Currently, Jaylen Brown is the best player from Georgia."
"Should get in over Randle: Tatum, Giannis, KD  Similar tier: Jaylen Brown, Middleton, Sabonis+ Bam (if they're not  centers)  Randle currently outperforming: Tobias Harris, Pascal Siakam, Jimmy Butler  I think he should make it if he can keep near his current level of play.  IMO the knicks have shit tier point guards and spacing and his numbers don't even do justice to his full impact.  I'm not a big believer in players earning all-star nods because of past achievements, he's been really good and deserves the nod imo."
I‚Äôd say Jaylen Brown is pretty well-liked as well for good reasons.  More so than Tatum for us (though he usually receives pretty positive reactions) given how vanilla Tatum is.  Then we have our beloved Marcus Smart to balance things out.
"lmao okay buddy  Jaylen Brown and Kemba Walker can't handle Jimmy Butler, but they can KD/Harden/Kyrie, let alone AD and LeBron.  Come on. Don't be stupid."
"Zion had one game of 17 minutes because he was in foul trouble the whole time.  Remove that game and he's at 33.8 minutes per game, which is up around the level of Donovan Mitchell, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, Jaylen Brown.  He's playing exactly as much as you'd expect him to."
"Give Steph, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford, Marcus Smart, and Terry Rozier and I guarantee he doesn't flame out in the second round all the while talking about he should've shot more, when he's like 2 for fucking 17. Kyrie hasn't done shit without having a top three player on his team."
"&gt;Rocket fan salty that the rockets got a bunch of late firsts and oladipo instead of Danny bailing them out with Jaylen brown.  Keep crying for a team led by a 22 year old while Houston spends the next decade as a completely irrelevant franchise.   And also, nobody is trading anything of value for 2 months of oladipo. These ‚Äúspecial‚Äù thoughts are probably why you have trouble understanding GMing"
"just a minor note, but the Celtics-Nets trade was for 3 firsts (2014, 2016, 2018 - James Young, Jaylen Brown, traded to Cleveland for Kyrie) and a pick swap in '17 (Tatum)."
"&gt;‚ÄùHere‚Äôs the thing though: I‚Äôm not sure getting close and not making the deal has missed for Boston. Trade for a couple of guys and you don‚Äôt have (Jayson) Tatum or (Jaylen) Brown. Make a deal for AD (Anthony Davis), and you‚Äôre out players and picks, and he probably leaves anyway. I think Danny has been right to walk away and not overpay.‚Äù  This is logic that you rarely see on r/nba. 99% of the time Ainge didn‚Äôt make a trade that we knew of, it was the right move.  AD would‚Äôve absolutely left, unless Kyrie came back (which still doesn‚Äôt guarantee he stays).  Kawhi absolutely would‚Äôve left. Yes the Raptors won, but they gave up way less to get Kawhi than Boston would‚Äôve had to. So because of that, they were able to have an elite team around him. Plus, most people agree they don‚Äôt win if GS doesn‚Äôt lose Durant.   As for PG and Butler, is there anyone else who still believes *to this day* Ainge should‚Äôve traded one of the picks that became Brown or Tatum to get one of those guys? I mean cmon  These are the types of arguments made against Ainge. They always lack context.   Danny Ainge criticism has always been overblown in literally every aspect. He‚Äôs firmly a top 5 GM."
"So we‚Äôre losing Jaylen Brown and the locker room was a toxic mess. Add in a HUGE question mark with Kawhi as we have to load manage him, which the Celtics don‚Äôt really normally do, and the apparent drama that was contained in Toronto and kept sealed, we‚Äôd have that going up against a stacked sixers team and the bucks. Let‚Äôs really not forget kyries meltdown, Tatum had a down year, Morris and Terry were black holes because they were looking for their next contracts, Hayward and Theis were still not very good after coming back from their injuries and Horford apparently just sat back and let the whole thing happen.  Then there‚Äôs no guarantee that the warriors fall to freak accidents the way it happened for Toronto.  Then kawhi, kyrie, horford, Morris and Terry walk. We‚Äôre left with Tatum, no brown, a lot of lost draft capital and in a much worse position."
Agreed. Here's who I'd have on the East team right now (no particular order):  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * Khris Middleton * Kevin Durant * Joel Embiid * Malcolm Brogdon * Jaylen Brown * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Julius Randle * Jrue Holiday * Bradley Beal
"It hurts man...  Honestly a lot of Celtic fans haven't processed how much this Harden trade is going to fuck us.   Like, we have 3 20+ PPG scorers on our team and are one of the best offenses in the league and we're thoroughly underrated in how potent we can be on that end of the floor with a guard like Kemba, a wing like Tatum, and Jaylen as the 3rd guy who can get 20 points without having to run plays for him.   And the Nets make all look cute having Harden, KD, and Kyrie. It is just so utterly unfair, each of their players is better than ours when you look at individual matchups, KD &gt; Tatum, Harden &gt; Brown, Kyrie &gt; Kemba."
"Not really, he's 28, most of the better guards are going to start to decline somewhat soon and there isn't a deep pool of clear cut future all-NBA guards.      I mean, you put Dipo after Steph, Harden, Lillard, Kyrie if he shows up, CP for one or two years, Westbrook, Beal. I think that Jamal Murray and Mitchell both are around his level of performance. Those are 7 players above him, 2 on a similar level, if any two of them has a dip in performance or Dipo has better team success with a similar season he gets into a 3rd team this year.      As they get old and start to decline, he gets to compete with the younger guys, and other than Trae and Booker I don't think there are clear cut superstars, Jaylen Brown has potential, Herro too, Fox, but those are maybes, they might peak at around Dipo's level and he gets a few all NBA's"
"There's no way to make the trade, but I really want Jaylen Brown. Celtics got a great player there."
"We'll see. At age 23 and 24 they still have room left to grow. The /r/nba consensus opinion on Jaylen Brown has been consistently wrong.   &gt;And you were with Kemba/Kyrie, Hayward, Smart and Brown?   Yes. That '18-'19 team had absolutely ridiculous talent and depth. Up there with any of the non-KD-Warriors teams we've seen in recent memory. Sometimes things don't go your way, especially with a leader like Kyrie."
It's not like those others were big misses either. Ainge likely would have landed Kawhi or AD if they would have been willing to stay in Boston long term. And Jaylen Brown played himself out of any potential Harden deal so they didn't really have a package that made sense.
"How? Brandon Ingram is a border line all-star. I have no issue with his contract. A 25% max for a ~23 year old borderline all star is much much much better than ~$20M per year for a 25 year old RFA who is never going to be more than a 5th starter.  Look at the recent ones. Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, BI. All looking pretty good. Compare that to Buddy Hield."
"if the raps keep winning I think he has a shot. If they start losing I think he is just considered a guy that puts up empty numbers on a bad team.   I think Jaylen Brown will be in the mix for MIP too, if the Celtics keep this pace up and he makes an AllStar team."
"Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart.   Both were talented when they got to the league, but JB had no handle, and Smart had no shot."
"Paul George is an MVP candidate type of player, no one else on that list is close to that. I think Booker is the best of the rest, while the other 3 are all similar and can be swapped in any order.  1. Paul George  2. Devin Booker  3. Ben Simmons  4. Jaylen Brown  5. Donovan Mitchell"
Jaylen Brown has take taken a big jump happy for the guy.
Classic Celtics.  &gt;Saying Harden and KD will be a dynasty is like saying Jaylen Brown is paid too much at 26m/yr
Jaylen Brown vs. Jayson Tatum. A lot of jealousy on both sides of who is Batman and who is Robin.

"&gt; All Defensive Teams First off, Kobe is the most overrated defensive player in NBA history  12 all-defense selections when he deserved maybe 4, in this era, where people arent voting purely off reputation, he doesn't get half of those.  &gt;BPM to say why Curry is at the top, lmao. Only Redditors, particularly Curry fans, would do so  Yes, lets use raw points, where Carmelo Anthony is going to finish ahead of Hakeem and Larry Bird.  You know who the all-time leaders in BPM are? Jordan and Lebron. Magic is third. VoRP isn't a bad way to look at things! Still, there are problems with using a box score metric--it overrates high usage/ball dominant players and underrates off-ball movement--though **these are not things that would make Steph look better than he was in comparison to Kobe**, who was the higher usage player. Steph beats Kobe in box metrics *despite* being less of a stat-padder.  Maybe box score metrics overrate super-heliocentric players like Harden or Westbrook. It's not the full picture, certainly. So, [if we instead look at RAPM](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm)-- which keeps only keeps track of how well your team performs when you're on the court vs off, adjusting to the average performance of your teammates--maybe Kobe does better vs Curry?   You gotta already know he doesn't, right?  Since RPM has been tracked (1997) there are 4 multiple-time leaders: Shaq lead the league 4 times, Duncan 3, Lebron 5, and Steph 4. Whatever noise exists in this stat, that's clearly a murderer's row. Kobe lead the league zero times. In Kobe's defense, if you limit RPM to only offensive impact, Kobe did lead the league in ORPM in 2006, also his best BPM season, when he scored 35ppg and carried a weak Lakers team.  Of course, *if we're gonna limit it to ORPM*, Steph becomes a god. Steph has lead the league in ORPM every full season he's played since 2014. That's 6 seasons in a row, and he's way ahead again in 2021 (The distance between Steph and #2, Dame, is roughly equal to the distance between Dame and #17, Jaylen Brown).   When we use advanced stats that don't rely purely on box score impact (accounting for off-ball movement) Steph becomes possibly the greatest offensive player of all-time.  I can also use PIPM, whatever you want, and Steph's peak will come out in a different tier than kobe's. **Kobe has incredible longevity, but he was not better than peak steph, and peak steph is still happening.**  &gt;including one (teammate) better than him for a while  Steph and KD are equals. Both around 13-16 ever.  Both have a chance to pass Kobe. Steph beat peak KD in the playoffs on a similar team. Do you think Kobe ever was even close to prime shaq?   Here are BPM comparisons for Steph and Durant since 2014: ||Steph|Durant| :-:|:-:|:-:| |2014|7.4|10.2| |2015|9.9|10.0 (27 games)| |2016|11.9|9.9| |2017|6.9|8.9| |2018|7.7|7.3| |2019|6.6|5.5| |2021|7.6|5.9| |Career|6.4|6.7|  Very even. Certainly the same tier of player. Kobe's career BPM? 4.6. Of course that does account for his decline. On the other hand, Kobe only had a higher BPM than Steph or Durant's *career average* twice in his entire career.  Here's Kobe and Shaq during the 3peat. ||Kobe|Shaq| :-:|:-:|:-:| |2000|5.1|9.3| |2001|4.8|7.7| |2002|4.6|8.0|  This is despite Shaq taking the regular seasons easy. Steph and Durant were equals. Kobe was a sidekick. When Kobe stopped being a sidekick, it was partially because Shaq declined, and the Lakers stopped winning titles.  Kobe still has two titles has the inarguable man to Steph's one, so, like I said: Steph needs 2-3 more MVP quality seasons (7+BPM) and one more title to pass Kobe"
Melo smoothness + TMac athleticism + Bill Russell sense of justice = Jaylen Brown  Tommy Heinsohn + Baynes + shower = [All of Australia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTgQAail6HM)
Jaylen Brown
"I think we can sit here and discuss all season, but the tell on who the better player is will come around playoff time. The Jaylen Brown ranking is the biggest bit of recency bias I have ever seen lmao."
Don‚Äôt you know that‚Äôs how this works? And next week it will obviously be Booker&gt;Mitchell. /s.  They‚Äôre both great and I have no problem with anyone picking Booker over Mitchell even if I‚Äôm happy taking Mitchell.  I‚Äôm a bit perplexed at Jaylen Brown ranked above either of them to be honest but he is having an excellent year.
Your argument of a small sample size would be much more appropriate for Jaylen Brown and not CJ.
"Also because I'm talking to a Lakers fan, he's rapidly lost credibility with Celtics fans, for being all in on every win now trade that crosses the First Take ticker. He's probably the most prominent person who treated Jaylen Brown as a trade piece and not a potential all star until like halfway through the bubble"
Jaylen Brown is the 2nd best SG rn.
Three 20 point scorers and none of them are Tatum/Brown? Hell yeah.  Also the thought of Jaylen having 10 assists in a game even last season seemed somewhat far-fetched. Crazy how well-rounded his game is now.
When you study for Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown but you get Semi Ojeleye and Payton Pritchard on the test.
Jaylen Brown? hasn't he been Boston's 2nd option for years now?  Anyway I think Wood will get it.
"Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum aren't 1, 2, or 3 in points this game lmfao imagine betting that"
"I remember the guy who was ranting about using initials for players who are unknown or who don't deserve it  I feel the same way with using first names only of players. It's okay if it's Giannis, LeBron, Kawhi or Steph, but it's getting annoying when it's used for players like Khris (Middleton), Jaylen (Brown) or Jayson (Tatum)"
Who Jaylen Brown think he is Trae Young
..for the Celtics again in a blockbuster trade for Jaylen Brown. I agree
How is Jaylen Brown competing for MIP when he was a fringe all star last year?
Over Wood/Jaylen Brown/Sexton/Randle? Probably but even that isn't so clear
"Exactly true. i actually like Jaylen more, but Tatum is still the better player. Brown is amazing too though.  But we have both and i love them both."
"He's *scoring* better than Tatum this year, that's indisputable.   However, Tatum is still a much better defender and much better playmaker.   I love Jaylen, but he's quietly becoming overrated in the sense that he's only good at aspects of play that are individual: he can score efficiently and he's a good man defender.   However, his off-ball defense is legitimately awful, and the team's offensive rating sucks whenever he plays without Tatum, which, if he were as good as he is made out to be, wouldn't happen.   Tatum is the guy who still gets the lion share of attention from defenses (blitzed/doubled in PnRs), Tatum is still the guy who Brad trusts to run the offense more than Brown.   Ultimately, for all of Jaylen's progress this year, there's one thing that still hasn't changed from last year:  Whenever Jayson Tatum is on the floor, the Boston Celtics play at the level of a borderline elite team.  Whenever Jayson Tatum is off the floor, the Boston Celtics suck and play at the level of the Minnesota Timberwolves."
Jaylen Brown MIP ez
I would have put jaylen brown over kyrie irving since kyrie has missed a lot of games
"Imo it *should* be Jokic this year, like I thought it should have been Luka last year.  Realistically any player competing for All NBA spots will not get it (sorry Jaylen Brown), so my vote goes to Jerami, or Randle."
"yes but with more money. jaylen ""the private jet"" brown"
I don‚Äôt see Jaylen Brown flop
"If Jaylen Brown playing hard, and those knees are taking a beating with the way he moves on offense and defense."
Looks like early Jaylen Brown
No worries! I‚Äôm a raptors fan (kawhi fanboy turned raptors fan haha) so I actually am pulling for siakam to work on his offensive versatility in the offseason. I‚Äôm also a big OG fan (my fave on the team) but he‚Äôs a stiff like Siakam as well. He‚Äôs stronger than Grant i actually dont see him developing like a Grant/Kawhi type of player but I would love for him to be an ultra aggressive stretch 5. Sorta like how Jaylen Brown was used in the playoffs and in FIBA (correct me if im wrong). Would love to see OG develop as that solid 4 or 5 as the third option.
"Celtics I think can put together an interesting package around Jaylen Brown for KAT, not saying I think either team will or should, but the skeleton of a Jaylen Brown for KAT trade is definitely there."
Did he really improve? Or is it more of a result of him becoming the 1st option and getting more touches and green light? My pick is Jaylen Brown. He is transforming his game in front of our eyes.
Jaylen Brown exists
Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown
"It was nice to see the Jazz close out a game so well - props to the Celtics, Jaylen Brown looks like a stud. This is a good start to Utah‚Äôs brutal gauntlet- they play the top 2 teams in the East and both LA teams in the next few weeks"
Jaylen Brown was much closer as a player last year to Middleton than rookie LaMelo is to Simmons. Brown was arguably better than Middleton in the playoffs
"Jaylen Brown said he watches the WNBA to learn new things, and the skill is the same as the NBA."
"I said what I said! Lol I‚Äôll MAYBE give Simmons the edge this year and only this year. I‚Äôll give you that since Melo is fresh out the gates.   But in today‚Äôs game I don‚Äôt rubber stamp ‚Äòexperience‚Äô as makin guys better. For reference, over a year ago I said Jaylen brown was better than Khris Middleton ans this sub was up on arms. How does that look? So yea I don‚Äôt follow narratives or base it on experience, I go by their straight up game. So for for a list of best PGs for next year yea I‚Äôm ranking Melo higher. He‚Äôs that good and Ben is that bleh.   And I know what people will do: the first thing they‚Äôll mention when talking about Ben‚Äî-is the *Sixers* success. Dead giveaway. People do the same with Draymond green. I don‚Äôt conflate a team‚Äôs success with a players actual game. A player can be a good fit and you can‚Äôt get accustomed to seeing them win WITH him, but that doesn‚Äôt make the individual player better then what he is. 76ers are this good bc of Embiid, chemistry, Tobias, and Doc (contrary to popular belief he is a good reg season coach). Yes Ben plays good D but it‚Äôs overblown at this point. He will be the reason they get booted in the playoffs bc he can‚Äôt score"
As time goes on I expect the Luka draft (2018?) and the Tatum draft (2017) will be viewed as better drafts. But 2016 was a good draft class but it's just hard for me to see any of these guys as top 10 players besides maybe Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray if he ever gets his shit together.
This man just put Tobias Harris over Jaylen Brown what in the world
People are saying Siakim but he looks a lot more comfortable/natural as a ball handler and passer. I like current Jaylen Brown comp  but Brown wasn't anatural ball handler and passer coming out of Cal either. Brown went from prototype 3 and D to a very capable creator.
"Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis   Damian Lillard, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo   Then honestly take your pick for the last two spots out of:  Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, Khris Middleton, Trae Young, Myles Turner, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, DeMar DeRozan, Zion Williamson... etc etc..."
It's easier to score in the NBA than NCAA too and it's all because of spacing and rule differences  Jaylen Brown struggled his freshman year and would get called for about 2-3 charges a game attacking the hoop at Cal
"Kemba costs $6-10M less per year than John Wall and is a better shooter.  Wall is most effective with the ball in his hands, at this point I want the ball with the Jays as much as possible.  Kemba has been bad so far this year but he's coming back off an injury, I am withholding judgement and panic until he's had more time and until Marcus Smart is back.     As soon as Smart comes back, the double big lineup of TT &amp; Theis can go away and it'll be easier for the Celtics to have more playmakers on the floor all the time.  I am still concerned about Kemba's size &amp; issues driving to the rim when it matters, but a 27 PPG Jaylen Brown &amp; Jayson Tatum mean that Kemba won't need to do as much in the playoffs."
Seen Siakim and Jaylen Brown in other places https://www.nbadraft.net/players/jonathan-kuminga/
what kind of question is this Jaylen brown
"Checking to see if I'm in good standing with the community.  Edit: oh shit still have the Shaq flair, gotta change the to my boi Jaylen Brown asap"
"Isn‚Äôt the bigger issue that between Jaylen, Jason and Kemba you guys have 3 dudes who excel in midrange despite that being the most inefficient shot in the league rn?  I don‚Äôt think Tatum or Brown are bad nessicarily, but to be carrying your team with midrange as your basis you need to be playing at an MVP level which those guys are not.    Maybe I‚Äôm looking too much into this but it‚Äôs not like the looks you guys are taking are much different whether it be brown, Kemba, or Tatum creating on the perimeter."
Jaylen Brown is a better player than Kyrie I can really score but that's about all I bring Irving.
"Right now, I think the ratio is about 1 all star to every 5 players in the dataset, so that would be an improvement.  If I filter further, I will definitely post more results.  &amp;#x200B;  I also thought about that, and if you check out my team vs the top 20 scorers, it's not really close. Notable top PPG guys who aren't in my all star list: Zach LaVine, Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Donovan Mitchell, Jerami Grant, CJ McCollum, Kyrie Irving. It selected a lot of people who are really valuable under advanced statistics but don't put up huge numbers instead."
Idk why people are saying it's Jerami Grant's to lose. His points have gone up but his efficiency and other stats haven't changed that much. Jaylen Brown is my frontrunner since he's actually improved his points and efficiency across the board as well a career high in assists and other stats. Also not being on the worst team in the league helps
"Jaylen Brown playing with another superstar, game is easier for him."
So... Jaylen Brown is a better offensive player than LeBron James?
"I think he‚Äôs number 5/5.  You‚Äôll believe what you want to believe but all analytical evidence backs me up. Jaylen Brown is having the same development path of Kawhi and Jimmy Butler but it‚Äôs happening even faster. If Jaylen isn‚Äôt top 5 to you right. Now than you must admit that hell be there 1 day, Shai will simply not be a better scorer and absolutely will be a worse defender. I take JB every fucking day of the week."
"i havent watched shai nearly as closely as Jaylen, but jaylen. because jaylen brown."

Jaylen Brown is the better shooter and scorer. I‚Äôll take him. Franchise players need to be able to put the ball in the basket.
Jaylen Brown
You could argue that Jaylen Brown is better than both of them
"Dunno about all game. Ya'all had me on the edge of my seat a lot of the game. Jaylen Brown is such a beast, I love watching that man play ball.   GGs! The game really changed with Theis fouling out and Gobert closing the 4th instead of Favors."
Jaylen Brown was great in his return. Easily the best player for us this game. Tatum with the first half stinker really hurt our chances. Nice seeing Theis hit 5 threes.  Donovan and Rudy are just fantastic. No Conley and y'all still just tore us apart all game. O'Neale filled in nice for Conley. Ingles is the perfect role player. Does a bit of everything well. Y'all got a real title shot this year Utah. Rooting for y'all to come out of the West.
Jaylen Brown gonna be better than Tatum in 1-2 years
"Just makes me sad to think that Jayson Tatum is leaving the Celtics at the end of his contract or requesting a trade in two years. We have a head coach that has been regressing ever since Kyrie broke him, a president/GM that is becoming senile, and fans that constantly think an inferior player (Jaylen Brown) is better. This sad franchise has nothing but history left.  It's over. The rebuild has failed. We have to start over again."
"Gg Celtics, Jaylen Brown a beast"
what is that excuse of a mask jaylen brown is wearing
"Just makes me sad to think that Jayson Tatum is leaving the Celtics at the end of his contract or requesting a trade in two years.

This sad franchise has nothing but history left.  It's over. The rebuild has failed. We have to start over again."
"Man I love Jaylen Brown, hope he keeps playing this well"
"Jaylen Brown &amp; Devin Booker are ahead of  several of the guys on your list so let's include them.  I'd also say SGA, CJ McCollum, Siakam, Kyrie, Gordon Hayward, Ingram and Middleton are all better.  Julius Randle &amp; Ben Simmons are probably where the line is, so that's another 8-11 guys at least (I am probably forgetting some).  It's interesting to name the guys, something we almost never do, as a result there are 12 top 5 players in the league at any given time.  EDIT: I forgot De'Aaron Fox, Ja Morant and Zach Lavine, would take them over Murray comfortably."
"I'll give it a stab.  Jaylen Brown,  Zion Williamson, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, KAT (if healthy), Ja Morant, Kyrie, De'Aaron Fox (arguable, but I would say so), Brandon Ingram (same thing), McCollum until he got injured (this season),  Shai (I'm high on Shai), Maybe Kemba, Probably Vucevic, Lavine."
"People are smoking this novel concept that players should be able to contribute on defense, rebounding, playmaking, and in virtually any other way other than offensively. They also realize that things like leadership, chemistry, and availability are hard to quantify but just as important.   There isn't a universe in which you'd take Kyrie over LeBron, Kawhi, AD, Jokic, Tatum, Durant, Giannis, Curry, Lillard, Butler, Harden, or Luka. Until this year you may have made a case for him being better than Embiid, Jaylen Brown, or Paul George but realistically he's behind those guys too. That puts him, at best, 16th in the NBA. He's closer to outside the top 20 than he is top 10."
Theis is keeping Boston in this while nobody else but Jaylen Brown came to play.
Someone get Jaylen Brown some help
jaylen brown is so good yo
Jaylen Brown is absolutely cooking the Utah Jazz. Wow.
"Jaylen ""Steph Curry"" Brown"
"Just making a quick list (not very accurate) I‚Äôd put him in the 20-30 range. Your 16-22 range seems a little too optimistic.  Embiid, Giannis, Middleton, Durant, Harden, Kyrie, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Capela, Bam Adebayo, Gobert, LeBron, AD, Kawhi, Paul George, Chris Paul, DeRozan, Damian Lillard, Jokic, Steph, Christian Wood, Zion, Luka  That‚Äôs 24 players. All of these players besides Bam are on a team with a better record then the Knicks. You could probably put him over a few of them though.  Ben Simmons, Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, Lavine, Beal, Conley, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Fox  There‚Äôs 9 players kind of in that same range. Maybe below, maybe above Randle depending on your argument."
"Steph, lebron, KD, embiid = tier 1  Luka, jokic, giannis, kawhi = tier 2  Jaylen brown, dame, AD, PG, and Beal = t3"
Jaylen Brown was only widely talked about in his second year. Where he avg 14ppg on with near 40% from three. I‚Äôd be saying the same thing if he was this incredibly hyped on 6ppg on 45% shooting
"that's the body language of an mvp right there.   But seriously, it sucks taht the nuggets took a step back this year (or look to have).   Jokic is tied with Jaylen brown as my favorite non-sixer to watch. I don't follow the nuggets closely enough to really know how much changed for them but they just don't look like the same team this year."
"Laker fans LMFAOOO  they think they're 46th pick is gonna be a star lmao. How's Kyle ""better than Jaylen Brown and Tatum"" Kuzma looking these days."
&gt; He's not the playmaker guard that we need to suit Brown and Tatum.  hindsight bias. no one knew when jaylen or tatum were gonna take the leap to stardom.
"that's why Kobe, Melo, Lebron, Wade and Arenas scoring way more than 25ppg was absurd to see compared to the rest of the league.  Today we have jaylen brown and Lavine scoring 27ppg, easily and these 2 are damn good players, but not close to the level of the named above.  In retrospective, Kobe and T-mac ridiculous scoring averages in 2002-03 were bonkers considering that in that NBA you were elite with 22ppg. Kobe had how many? 10-12 straight games with 40+pts? Same for Iverson scoring numbers (even with bad efficiency) in 2001 and 2002."
"How about jaylen brown, simmons, Harris, sexton, lavine, grant, bam, brogdon? Shit jaylen brown should prob be a starter. Love how you act like sabonis, vuc, trae, kyrie, and Hayward are some kind of fringe guys lucky to make it in a weak east lol while you bring up guys like derozen, wall, oladipo,and porzingis are deserving guys that won't make it bc of stacked western conference lol"
"We talk about the war chest of assets like he didn‚Äôt do anything with it but that‚Äôs blatantly false. With that war chest he drafted 3 cornerstones in Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Marcus Smart. One high end rotation player in Payton Pritchard. Two high potential young guys in Nesmith and Langford. 3 solid 20 min a night guys in Timelord, Ojeleye, and Williams. To go with that he also traded some of the chest for Kyrie which sadly didn‚Äôt go well."
Jaylen Brown ain‚Äôt really flirting lol
You're tryna bolster Jaylen brown and Jayson Tatum? Good luck
"I haven't, but I am looking forward to the C's getting them tomorrow. Everyone is raving about them, so I'll definitely make sure to watch. I hope we have Jaylen Brown back though!"
"""Or"" isn't enough.    Over the past 5 years, Danny brought in:  Isaiah Thomas + Al Horford + Gordon Hayward + Kyrie Irving + Kemba Walker + Jayson Tatum + (soon to be All-Star) Jaylen Brown.   If ""or"" was enough then people would already be satisfied. Danny fell short because he didn't bring in all those guys ""and"" more.  You have to get every single All-Star in the NBA or you are a failure."
"Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, Klay, Ben Simmons, Embiid"
I‚Äôd trade him for Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum.
Kemba is the disaster of a contract that this sub thought Jaylen Brown was
"You can't evaluate IQ based on press interviews or public persona, that's mostly just going to measure pre-NBA socioeconomics, parental influence, the age when others encouraged them to pump the brakes academically in favor of focusing on basketball 40+ hours a week. and emotional intelligence not spatial/verbal. Tacko fall had great SATs and a difficult major, you can measurably say that he's likely pretty smart. But somebody like Russell Westbrook who is not great in the press and plays a style of basketball that is antithetical to modern analytics might not be called smart despite documented history of strong academics(Jeremy Lin also plays the same high turnover, high athleticism, middling efficiency game as Westbrook, but we can easily say hes smart cuz hatvard). Also I feel like if you went through a list of all white nba players you'd have a hard time saying that a guy is dumb even though statistically a few have to be.  These lists are fun and I love learning about dual excellence in people like Jaylen Brown or David Robinson who are gifted athletically and academically. But it's real easy to make mistakes like  Goldwater rule diagnosing from afar or Charles Murray's bell curve. I think it's best to assume that most people are reasonably smart and with effort can grasp most concepts and that with rare exceptions what we call smart when we see it in a press conference is mostly just socioeconomics merging with things like curiosity, incentives to learn, anxiety leading to over preparation and the presence of adult figures in childhood and mentors in early adulthood"
"OoOoO, forgot about Jaylen.   &gt; Brown committed to play for the University of California, Berkeley‚Äòs Golden Bears under the leadership of Coach Cuonzo Martin. While attending UC Berkeley, Brown studied magnet chemistry taking a master-level class during his first semester at Berkeley‚Äôs Cultural Studies of Sport in Education. One of the best members of the Berkeley Chess team, he also achieved a level of fluency in Spanish, declaring that it was his intention to learn three more languages before turning 25 years old. Brown has made it evident that basketball is merely one of his many interests; he has also focused on studying history, meditation, and philosophy. His ambitions go beyond basketball and he has been criticized as being ‚Äútoo smart‚Äù to play in the NBA. In 2016, CBA ran an article urging the NBA not to overlook Brown ‚Äúsimply because he was intelligent.‚Äù This concern turned out to be unwarranted as Brown was chosen during the first round of the NBA draft as pick #3.  A beard once represented wisdom, and with JB it's apropo. He wins."
"He‚Äôs right except for someone like jaylen brown this would be his first appearance and who knows whether or not he will continue to be at the same level next year and beyond.   Some people are just one time all stars, and it would be disappointing if the one time they were they didn‚Äôt get the opportunity to shine."
Lavine takes 2 more 3s a game shooting barely worse from there. His TS% is 65 to Brown's 61 which is a larger difference than you'd think. For instance the difference between 58 to 61 is huge. Lavine is also the number 1 option and his 3s are assisted on 30% less than Brown as in Jaylen is shooting way more catch and shoot. Lavine is creating his own opportunities. Lavine is a clear cut better scorer any way you slice it. It's not even a debatable point to me.
"Jaylen ""Cock it back and let it go down"" Brown.   It is known."
Jaylen Brown easy. Lavine can get buckets that‚Äôs about it. Brown keeps improving his all around game. He might be all-nba this year
Probably Jaylen Brown
See: Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown this season lol
"C: Nikola Jokic / Joel Embiid  PF: LeBron James / Giannis   SF: Kawhi Leonard / Kevin Durant  SG: Luka Donƒçiƒá  / Bradley Beal  PG: Steph Curry / Trae Young  6: Damian Lillard / Nikola Vucevic  7: DeMar DeRozan / Jaylen Brown  8: Christian Wood / Kyle Lowry  9: SGA / Zach LaVine  10: Chris Paul / Sexton  11: Donovan Mitchell / Jerami Grant   12: De'Aaron Fox / Sabonis  13: Zion Williamson / Randle  14: Ja Morant / Jimmy Butler  15: KAT / Hayward  &amp;#x200B;  All things considered it's not a horrible idea, each team has an All Star caliber player on it's roster, but the problem is injuries and all star players underperforming . Like in Miami's case, Butler is their clear cut all star but he's missed games, does Tyler Herro become their representative? Same thing with Minnesota who KAT is their best player, but Anthony Edwards has played more. Then you start having All Star nods becoming meaningless as guys like Herro would have All Star nods over James Harden."
"Out of: Kyrie, Beal, Harden, Lavine, Jaylen Brown, Ben Simmons  Who do you take him over? There‚Äôs only so many spots"
Jaylen Brown  expecially as defender
Put Jaylen Brown over FVV 1st team is ridiculous.
"No, you just have to be a DPOY candidate on a winning team for it to matter. You think FVV's defense makes up for the 9 more points per game that Zach Lavine scores or the 5 more points per game and equal defense that Jaylen Brown brings? Harden's scoring 5 more points and dishing 5 more assists per game than FVV too. Fred's defense isn't even that valuable based on just about every advanced defensive metric.   Just because you like him doesn't mean he deserves anything. There's a massive gap between the All-Stars and the Snubs this year and then there's an even larger gap between legitimate snubs like Sabonis and Booker and whatever FVV is this year."
" I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.   Demontas is a better rebounder because he is big? like yeah? If Jaylen Brown was 5,1 and weighed a 100 pounds he would suck everything he was supposed to do on court? That is true of every basketball player? But there are plenty of basketball players who are taller than Demontas who rebounds a lot less so this is such a weird hill for you to die on."
Being tall has nothing to do with role dude. Lebron gets a ton of rebounds for in stance despite playing on the wing like Jaylen.      &gt; I just think Brown is better. There's 0 argument that you can make to change my mind.   Okay then.
Jaylen brown to Utah confirmed
"or you know the fact that Sabonis is 6'11 and massive and Jaylen Brown is 6'6 and not massive.      Domantas is averaging 22-12-5, on basically the exact same true shooting percentage, so it's weird like you are acting like Brown has him beat in basic counting stats, most people would probably rather wont 6 rebounds and 1 assist than 4 points."
     Giannis (26)  Luka (21) wtf this dudes only 21...  \---  Embiid (26)  Jokic (26)  AD (27)  \---       Players that could age well and keep pace:  Trae Young (22)  Bam Adebayo (23)  Bradley Beal (27)  \---  Zach Lavine (25)  Donovan Mitchell (24)  Sabonis (24)  Jayson Tatum (22)  Jaylen Brown (24)

"Van Vleet, Butler and Bam all deserve it over Jaylen Brown."
"Celtics fans: we are the best team in the East, we deserve 4 all stars even though they all have average stat. [Insert player] has better stat but he's playing for a shit team so it doesn't count.  Also Celtics fans: Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have better stat than [Insert player], so they deserve all stars even though the team is worse. Being a better team doesn't garuentee an all star."
Yeah I mean this was an amazing finish by Luka and Jaylen Brown so it worked out. But they totally killed all momentum and half the time it ends up with free throws there instead of a big crazy buzzer beater.
"No problem.  Once elected, your first directive is to demand the trade of Jaylen Brown to the Denver Nuggets for a 2023 2nd round pick."
He‚Äôs 25 and putting up 23/11/2/2 on 56% from the field and 42% from 3. That‚Äôs all star caliber  He‚Äôs definitely the kind of player you want to build around. He‚Äôs literally younger than Lavine/Beal and one year older than Jaylen Brown
"Who said in the next 2 years? In the next 2 years isn‚Äôt impossible though. We have a better duo than the Sixers, they just have better role players. When we had Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum, and Jaylen Brown playing we started off the season 8-3. Marcus Smart is the most important player to this team winning. No Marcus Smart, no winning."
"Siakam was ass in the bubble true, but You‚Äôre ignorant asf if you don‚Äôt think Brown didn‚Äôt do anything. Sorry Jaylen and Jayson are both really good defenders don‚Äôt know how you could say they play ‚Äúzero defense‚Äù and expect me to take you seriously   Curry averaged 31 a game in that series don‚Äôt ever in your life say FVV ‚Äúlocked‚Äù him up lmaoooo"
"Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Pelicans are 1.5 games back despite having the tougher schedule till date and being in the tougher conference.  Most people seem to agree CP3 is the key guy in elevating the team to that record. Spurs are right behind y'all, and they don't have any. The guard spot in the West is packed."
Other then Jaylen Brown becoming a star not one good thing has happened this year. Not one single thing.
I thought Jaylen Brown should've stayed on him and just left Hardaway open because Brown was playing some hard D not allowing the switch for most of that possession. Once Doncic got the Theis switch I just got the feeling it was going in
"The problem is you cannot justify having one and not the other, their numbers are almost identical and they are indeed playing like All Stars. Hell Jaylen Brown was even in the very early MVP conversation"
The moment Luka gets the switch away from Jaylen Brown he gets two back to back 3s. Great game despite falling -.500
Jaylen fucking brown
"Came here to say amazing defence from Jaylen Brown, but wow what an incredible shot from Luka the magician."
Jaylen Brown!
#Where were you when Jaylen Brunson surpassed Jaylen Brown?!
"Draymond green was never a top 20 player. So we can just agree to disagree there. I view players separate from their circumstance. And I‚Äôd like to think Draymond‚Äôs current status‚Äî-he‚Äôs still in his prime, he aint been hurt, he‚Äôs still young, why wouldn‚Äôt he still be top 20 if he was then‚Äî- confirms that for everyone else.   As far as Gobert top 20, among many others you‚Äôd have to have him ahead of his own teammate‚Äî-which is comical considering the man averaged 45 a game in the playoffs‚Äî-as well as others who are vastly superior. Just bc it‚Äôs a fun practice my 20 in no order:   Bron, AD, Kawhi, PG, Harden, KD, Kyrie, Steph, Giannis, Embiid, Luka, Jokic, Lillard, Tatum, Brown, CP3, Jimmy, Beal, KAT, Mitchell.   How many of those are even debateable? Jaylen Brown? Only if you‚Äôre stuck on name recognition. Cp3? His argument is basically the same as Gobert.  ‚ÄúEffecting winning‚Äù. KAT? I‚Äôd much rather an elite offensive player like KAT and find a cheap defensive center as opposed to have Gobert and need to find elite offense."
Jaylen brown is not below average he's average. There's tons of defenders worse than him in the nba.
"&gt; most Cs fans aren‚Äôt ready to admit that Jaylen Brown is and has been the best player on that team  Celtics fans are obsessed with Jaylen Brown and their favorite thing is knowing how good he is (and other people not knowing). Also, Tatum hasn't been stellar but he's been better than Sabonis."
"[Woj]: The East is lasering in on James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic for the all star reserves."
"Jaylen Brown did not deserve an All-Star nod. If anything, this may give the Celtics management the wrong impression that Brown is an elite player when in reality, he is not.  Tatum deserves a better second option than Jaylen Brown."
He deserved it over Jaylen Brown. Sabonis is the Pacers #1 option and has dragged them to a better record than the Celtics.  Tatum is the only All-Star in Boston.
I think Sabonis deserves it more than jaylen brown
"Yeah Brown is good but I'll take the guy who can score 40 on the dude with elite defense over the guy who can get 25 on the ""poor defender"".   Also no disrespect to Jaylen 1 of my favorite players but Booker is 1 of the best scorers."
"&gt;Just like Kawhi?  Kawhi just wanted to play in LA, not in another country. It's a pure geographical reason as to why. I don't think Harden loved living in Brooklyn more than he did in Houston, so I doubt that's why he wanted to get traded  &gt;Jaylen Brown is likely to earn himself some All-NBA honors, starting this year.   Cool? Siakam was All NBA 2nd team last year, was he a superstar? Or anything close to it? Lmao  &gt;It also in no way would be a 1 for 1 Brown for Harden. The rumors were minimum Brown, Smart, bench players, and picks.   No, there were also rumors that you didn't need to throw in Smart too; the focal point was Brown and throwing in Kemba with some of your bad bench players (who aren't fucking helping you anyway, as most Celtics fans even admit) and picks (which you've miffed on for a while now) woulda been a better offer than Brookyln's. Just depends on if Ainge is willing to give up his war chest  &gt;So there's a future All-Star/All-NBA, a first team All-Defense, and then the picks you'd need to refill the bench you just traded away.   Still worth it, even if you gave up Brown. You're trying to tack on accolades to make it seem like you're giving up an insane amount but you're really not. DeAndre Jordan was 1st Team All NBA in 2016 or 17 I believe but he's nowhere near superstar level even in his peak.  &gt;Tatum and Harden cannot win the championship with role players.  Harden *alone* is capable of taking a bunch of bum role players to the 2nd round at least, and in the East that would be the Conference Finals, which has been your ceiling with the Jays. Do you fucking realize what he's doing with the corpse of DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green and other forgotten role players like Bruce Brown, TLC and Tyler Johnson?  Harden, Tatum, Smart, Tucker (assuming you added him as a solid vet rotational piece at the wing position who works well with Harden) and any Center who knows how to catch lobs is much better than you have now. It's also arguably better than the Nets pre Harden trade  &gt;Their primes are 5 years away. Everyone compares them to players who are 28+ when Brown is only 24.  Lmao, this is what's wrong with fanbases of this sub. Everyone says ""THEY'RE ONLY 24, THEY'RE NOT IN THEIR PRIME"" when defending their coveted young prospects as an excuse not to take the necessary risks to win when in reality being 24 means you're already in your prime.   This is about as good as Brown is going to be, especially considering his super hot shooting numbers are arguably statistically unsustainable and will continue to fall by the end of the year into the playoffs. That'll be the case pretty soon with Tatum. You need to realize you're in win now mode, and if you haven't made the Finals in the next couple years they'll want out  I get it; you're attached to your guys. Jaylen Brown is a stand up guy and great player. However, if your goal is to win a Championship, then you'll take the risks you have to in order to make it work."
Jaylen Brown and Ben Simmons over Trae is actually ridiculous
"JAYLEN BROWN IS AN ALL STAR!   From getting booed on draft nigh, to getting clowned for his contract. This guy worked his ass off for 4 1/2 years for this!"
Because jaylen brown is better?
"[Charania] Sources: The East are tantalised by James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic. And the West are enamoured with Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis"
"West: Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis   East: James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic  Just a feeling I have"
"Happy for Randle, LaVine and Vuc  Edit: Jaylen Brown as well."
"Don't say there's so many things wrong and then spew idiotic shit like that.  &gt; Harden could stay if you actually make it enticing enough for him to stay, like winning a Championship. Even if you win one ring the trade is an automatic W  Just like Kawhi?  &gt; Jaylen Brown is not, in anyway, a 'superstar', nor will likely ever be one as nearly as good as James Harden.  Jaylen Brown is likely to earn himself some All-NBA honors, starting this year. It also in no way would be a 1 for 1 Brown for Harden. The rumors were minimum Brown, Smart, bench players, and picks. So there's a future All-Star/All-NBA, a first team All-Defense, and then the picks you'd need to refill the bench you just traded away. Tatum and Harden cannot win the championship with role players.  &gt; If you continue to stagnate and/or regress as you you build nothing around the Jays, they'll leave or force a trade while in their prime anyway.  Their primes are 5 years away. Everyone compares them to players who are 28+ when Brown is only 24."
Who are your seven reserves? For the guards harden is a lock and coaches could make the case for butler or jaylen brown over him because of the past so idk
"To be fair, their window to get to the Finals only opened up 2 seasons ago after Lebron left the east. The first year, Kawhi and the raptors happened. Also, Hayward got a freak injury and Kyrie didn't work out in Boston. They still would've been screwed had they kept an injured IT. Then, the second year, pandemic happened and the Bubble Heat were unstoppable until they faced the Lakers.  Having said that, I thought they should've traded Jaylen Brown and Kemba to get Harden. Houston would've jumped on that deal. As much as Brown has improved, Harden is better. Hate Harden all you want, but he is easily a walking 30/8/8 player. You combine that firepower with Tatum and the Celtics are scary."
Jaylen Brown **and** Marcus Smart **and** FRP‚Äôs
Huh? Danny didn‚Äôt trade for Harden because he didn‚Äôt want to give up Marcus Smart and Jaylen Brown. Great revisionist history though.
‚ÄúJaylen Brown‚Äù
"So many things wrong with that sentence  1. Harden could stay if you actually make it enticing enough for him to stay, like winning a Championship. Even if you win one ring the trade is an automatic W 2. Jaylen Brown is not, in anyway, a 'superstar', nor will likely ever be one as nearly as good as James Harden. I don't think you understand how good James Harden is, especially in comparison to a 1 time All Star in Brown. He's on another level when it comes to finishing, playmaking, shot creating and scoring in general; it's absolutely worth trading for 3. If you continue to stagnate and/or regress as you you build nothing around the Jays, they'll leave or force a trade while in their prime anyway. In today's NBA, 'under contract' for stars doesn't mean shit"
"&gt; Seeing a post titled ""Jaylen Brown had 32p on 55/50/80 shooting splits"" legit tells us nothing.   I get your point, but it still tells you something, not nothing. I'd argue that it's better than ""Player X had 24p on 7/2/8"". Then you have no idea how well the player shot. Did they do that in 10 FGAs or 25 FGAs? The first would be a great game, the second would be a bad game.  Of course, the ideal is put the made+attempts: Player X had 24pts on 7-14/2-4/8-10.  &gt; Shooting averages are meant to be used for full seasons or playoff series/runs.  It's fine for single games too. That's what you calculate anyways when you look at 7-14 and say, ""oh he shot 50% FG, that's a good game""."
"embiid, harden, kyrie, durant, jaylen brown, giannis, sabonis, lavine, butler, adebayo, trae young, vucevic, beal, luka, zion, ingram, mitchell, gobert, lillard, jokic, kahwhi, paul geroge, lebron, anthony davis, curry"
"Okay. Jaylen brown has a higher usage rate than AD, tied with JT on the Celtics for the highest but they still managed to beat the clippers without him."
"The celtics, jaylen brown went to my school"
"except he is lmao. the only player you can really say we missed on was kawhi, and he was 1000% a one year rental, which means we would've given up on jaylen for a one year shot, which may or may not have worked out(especially with the chemistry of that 18-19 team).   If you think we should've traded tatum for PG then I can't help you there lmao. AD's father literally shit all over us on national media so I would doubt AD would be locked in ready to sign a 5 year deal with us. Harden is TBD but trading brown+smart AND picks would still not make us a contender"
"I wrote a 3 page article for a sports journalism class in college in I believe 2017 about how the Celtics absolutely cannot afford to lose Avery Bradley... he went to Detroit and has bounced around a few disappointing stops since, while the Celtics made multiple ecf‚Äôs, and jaylen brown is objectively 10x better at that role in stevens system than Bradley ever could be."
"So let's walk through those guys:  Kawhi would have commanded *at least* Jaylen Brown and multiple firsts. You think the Celtics should've done that deal?  Anthony Davis would have commanded Jayson Tatum, probably Jaylen Brown and multiple firsts. You think the Celtics should've done that deal?  James Harden would have commanded Tatum or Brown and multiple firsts, and he was actively sabotaging a team he didn't want to be on.  Russell Westbrook is not a player the Celtics should have traded for under any circumstances.  Jimmy Butler would have commanded at least Jaylen Brown, and he ditched a contender for Miami. You think the Celtics should've made that trade?  Chris Paul I agree with but the Celtics would've needed to include Brown and Smart for salary matching purposes, and no one in the league thought he'd be a positive asset.  The Celtics were objectively right in hindsight not to trade for Cousins.  &gt;The fact that the Raptors are currently ahead of Boston in the standings and went game 7 against them after they lost Kawhi is pretty telling as well.  In that series when Hayward was out with injury and Kemba played only 3 games after coming back from a knee injury? Yeah, it's telling, just not the way you think."
"&gt;If Celtics are serious about contending you make trades like that to have a chance.  The Celtics made exactly the type of trade you're talking about with Kyrie and people clown them because it didn't work out, even though without Kyrie *and* Hayward that team went to game 7 of the ECF against LeBron.   Should the Celtics have traded Jaylen Brown for one year of Kawhi? Jayson Tatum for one year of AD? Because that's what you're advocating for the Celtics to do when you say they should have ""taken a chance"" with those trades."
Jaylen Brown &gt; Vucevic and CP3 &gt; Booker  Agree with the rest tho
We lost to Celtics without Jaylen Brown... fuck
Sounds like jaylen brown when they played the lakers
"This is my prediction for the East All-Stars to provide some examples as to why the Raptors don't get in.      |PLAYER|TEAM|Conference|Position| :--|:--|:--|:--| |Joel Embiid|PHI|E|F| |Kevin Durant|BKN|E|F| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|E|F| |Bradley Beal|WAS|E|G| |Kyrie Irving|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Jayson Tatum|BOS|E|F| |Domantas Sabonis|IND|E|F| |Julius Randle|NYK|E|F| |Jaylen Brown|BOS|E|G| |James Harden|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Zach LaVine|CHI|E|G| |Trae Young|ATL|E|G| ||||| |Nikola Vucevic|ORL|*Unlucky Miss|F| |Bam Adebayo|MIA|*Unlucky Miss|F|       The Raptors two best chances for a spot are FVV, who I don't think is better than any of the 4 guards I listed in addition to the starters revealed. Then for Siakam I don't think he's better than Vuc or Bam who I think are going to be an unlucky miss among the forwards."
"People say that, but then you see quotes form Jaylen Brown after the team is .500 and you wonder how bad it is going to get if they miss the playoffs.  Things start going sideways awful fast when you lose.  Wouldn't be the first time a star player decided they wanted to be ""the man"" on a new team.  That's how you got Irving in the first place."
We need to move on from this. The new empty stats king should be Jaylen Brown.
"I sat down and did this exercise before starters got announced:   I‚Äôd have:    EAST STARTERS G - James Harden G - Jaylen Brown F - Giannis Antetekounmpo F - Kevin Durant F - Joel Embiid  EAST RESERVES 1 - Kyrie Irving 2 - Jason Tatum 3 - Bam Adebayo 4 - Nikola Vucevic 5 - Ben Simmons 6 - Bradley Beal 7 - Domantas Sabonis ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî 1st OUT - Jimmy Butler 2nd OUT - Zach LaVine 3rd OUT - Trae Young 4th OUT - Julius Randle 5th OUT -  Khris Middleton 6th OUT - Fred Vanvleet 7th OUT - Jerami Grant 8th OUT - Gordon Hayward 9th OUT - Jrue Holiday 10th OUT - Tobias Harris 11th OUT - Malcom Brogdan  I could see reasonable arguments for all the guys listed there and the high scoring bad team guys are admittedly the toughest to deal with.  Hell, there are probably a few omissions there too -  but IMO all these guys are having the kind of seasons where a ton of players will get shafted.   Each has a great cases depending on your own personal criteria."
"And win? Jrue, Jaylen Brown, Kawhi, Simmons, Embiid."
"Yeah I see the baggage as mainly the Kemba contract, the cap situation (though in fairness some of that is allocated to the guys who are the other team's future), and the lack of assets to create flexibility.  As for draft capital, to me it's a matter of having made too many selections and seeing too many of those selections ultimately return 0 value. Like let's go all the way back to 2013 and the draft day when the Brooklyn trade happened.  In 2013, the C's pick Kelly Olynyk. He walks away for nothing in 2017.  In 2014, they pick Marcus Smart (indisputably a big fat W), but they also pick James Young, who flames out of the league almost immediately.  In 2015, they grab Rozier. Turns out he's a great pick, but ultimately he's dumped to get Kemba Walker, who has produced mixed results so far and will likely either leave in free agency or cost picks to move. He's followed up by RJ Hunter (out of the league), Jordan Mickey (out of the league), and Marcus Thornton (out of the league).  In 2016, the Brooklyn trade pays off in a big way and they take Jaylen Brown. Unfortunately, they hang onto the #16 and #23 pick# too long and they becomes cap casualties in the form of Yabu and Zizic as necessary draft-and-stashes who never develop into an NBA players. He does manage to turn two seconds into a Memphis 1st (from the Clippers). But that becomes the Thybulle selection in 2019 and turned into #24 (Ty Jerome) and #33 (Carsen Edwards). Jerome returned the #30 pick in 2020, which has since been turned back into two seconds. Edwards got a guaranteed deal for no real reason and likely will be out of the league soon.  The C's then still take 3 second round picks in this draft, two of whom drop out of the league (Demetrius Jackson, Ben Bentil). The other was Abdel Nader, who ultimately was dumped for Rodney Purvis, who was promptly waived.  2017 is another strong start with the Tatum selection. At 37, they also get Semi, who has over-performed for being drafted that late. But will he be here long-term? Or end up as another selection who walks away for nothing? Still not sure he belongs in a real contender's rotation. We also end up taking two more guys in the second round (Kadeem Allen and Jabari Bird) who do not play NBA basketball anymore.  In 2018, the last Brooklyn pick gets shipped out for Kyrie, who will leave for nothing. I don't blame Ainge for this one as I don't think many people understood what a headcase Kyrie actually was. They also get Robert Williams in this draft, which looks great so far.  I'm going to set aside the 2019 and 2020 drafts because they are too recent. But I will say the Edwards and Waters picks are really baffling and seemed destined to fail pretty early on. Why is the team so focused on getting undersized guards?  Anyway, the team has made so many draft selections, but aside from the three home runs and Kemba, they've turned into what 2 other guys that fans can feel confident may be rotation players (Robert and Pritchard)? We've got our fingers crossed that Langford and Nesmith will join them, but who knows. Maybe Semi and Grant can contribute, but they are so inconsistent still. That's why I feel those assets were mismanaged."
"I dunno man, every time I hear Jaylen Brown answer ""No comment,"" it makes me think something is broken."
"&gt; Not sure about Tatum  Why?  Anyone putting Brown in over Tatum isn‚Äôt paying attention. Tatum is getting absolutely swarmed by teams constantly and still putting up a rock solid 26/7/5 with elite defense. Jaylen almost never faces a double team and is not as good of a defender as Tatum.   They‚Äôre both deserving of all star, but this narrative that Brown is somehow more deserving because he gets easier looks is silly."
No Jaylen Brown?   I think he deserves to go over Tatum
Where is Jaylen Brown. You clearly have not considered him
"We all blamed Kyrie for the 2018 disaster, but it turns out he was right.  The next in-line are Brad Stevens and Jaylen Brown, with Danny Ainge not too far behind. All three of them need to go before this team can contend."
And if they didn't win a ring? They would have gotten rid of Jaylen Brown for nothing.   Not a risk worth taking.
Jaylen Brown is currently set to be an unrestricted free agent in 3 years time. What is this decade you speak of?
Lmao if the Celtics traded Jaylen Brown for 1 year of Kawhi or AD that would be one of the worst deals in NBA history
Yeah but narratives fuck that up Cus nobody cares about Orlando and everybody feels Jaylen brown got snubbed last year and nobody likes Ben due to his lack of shooting confidence
"""The team is seriously considering sending Jaylen Brown to the Raptors"" wow I'm surprised the article just comes out and says it, but alright."
"This stat has Mike Muscala over Bradley Beal, and Devonte Graham over Kawhi Leonard, Rudy Gobert, Jaylen Brown and KD. Seems like a pretty worthless stat.   Oh it also has Chris Boucher over Rudy Gobert."
"This is the same Bill Simmons that wanted to [trade Jaylen Brown for Atlanta's Dallas pick \(that was ~17th at the time and landed ~10th by draft night\).](https://np.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/a46tsl/bill_simmons_wants_to_see_boston_trade_jaylen/)   Guy loves his bad takes.   [He was pleading for Doc Rivers to be fired before 2008 as well.](https://proxy.espn.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/060112)  And Doc claims he even went as far as contacting the higher-ups:  &gt;In a radio interview Friday on WEEI, Rivers accused Simmons of doing ‚Äúeverything he could to get me fired,‚Äù and went on to say that Simmons even wrote letters to Celtics ownership and requested meetings to share his plans for firing the coach.  &gt; ‚ÄúHe had an agenda, but thank God our owners didn‚Äôt believe him,‚Äù said Rivers. ‚ÄúThey actually laughed at him and thought he was a joke.‚Äù  &gt;https://nesn.com/2013/06/doc-rivers-says-bill-simmons-did-everything-he-could-to-get-me-fired/   Bill obviously got his start as a Boston fan, but he's never been the most rational or reasonable Boston fan."
"&gt;miss used so many of their   I think people are looking to clown DA...but it‚Äôs not like he let his war chest evaporate w nothing to show for it.  * BOS 2014 1st, tanking year: Marcus Smart  * BKN 2014 1st: James Young  * BKN 2016 1st: Jaylen Brown  * BKN 2017 1st: Jayson Tatum  * BKN 2018 1st: traded for Kyrie Irving  * SAC 2019 1st: Romeo Langford  * MEM 2020 1st: Aaron Nesmith  Langford/Nesmith are incomplete. Jays + Marcus are hits. James Young (at #17) was an obvious whiff, and you could make an argument that the Cs would have been better off not trading for Kyrie."
"Yep. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are bonafide stars, All-Defense 1st team Marcus Smart is out. Celtics will turn it around soon. These hot takes are so annoying"
Not the same  If I were to make a thread saying the Celtics should trade Jaylen Brown for Malik Beasley Jarred Vanderbilt and a first then we would be talking
"Okay, let's go through them:  Definitely better: LeBron, KD, Kawhi, Giannis, AD (games played is iffy), Taytum. That's when you get into the Julius Randle, Zion, Jaylen Brown, Hayward, Jeremi Grant, sort of area where I can see Pascal finishing the season in that same category - and then it comes down to how much you value team success, if guys get injured, how much guys regress to the mean, how much have guys rested, etc."
"Yeah, FVV is good, but he's only $5 million/year cheaper than Jaylen Brown, and FVV's contract has a player option in the last year.   Dudes ring chasing on 1 year vet mins should probably be excluded from ""best contract"" discussions though (as well as rookie/max contracts that are artificially limited). Frankly, I don't think any 1 year deal can be in contention for ""best contract"", but especially for guys like Batum, it's not really a fair representation of his actual free agency value.   Dort, Brown, and Seth Curry are my 3 ""best contracts"". I love the Grizzlies books overall, but no single contract sticks out to me as being especially good."
"My man, you are not benching Jaylen Brown right now. Even with the team defense problems."
My guess is they would only move him for an overpay that franchise loves him too much. I legitimately think like if Boston were to call they would be asking for Jaylen brown and obviously Boston would hang up. I don‚Äôt even know if like Devin Vassell Lonnie Walker and next years pick would get it done. So yeah I don‚Äôt expect a deal anytime soon
Can we have jaylen brown

Boston was also panned for drafting Jaylen Brown over Kris Dunn at the time. Hindsight is 2020.
"Who do you take, Ingram or Tatum?   This season:  Tatum: 25.8/7.0/4.8 with 1.3 stls 0.5 blks and 2.6 TOs. Shooting 450/388/888 on 51.6 efg%. He's had covid and is sharing with Jaylen Brown and now Kemba. 22 years old, 23 in a week or so.  Ingram: 23.6/5.2/4.8 with 0.7 stls and 0.8 blks and 2.4 TOs. Shooting 468/392/877 on 53.7 efg%. He's sharing with Zion. 23.5 years old."
"Simmons, Smart  Jrue Holiday, Jaylen Brown (categorized as guard in All Star)  and my homer pick, Matisse Thybulle. Throw in Beverly, Gary Trent Jr., Paul George, Gary Harris, etc.  I‚Äôm not saying all of these guys are better than Vanvleet, I‚Äôm just saying he‚Äôs not one of the top 4."
"Jaylen brown comes to mind.  If we're talking non max guys who are playing above their pay grade.  But I do think FVV is up there. Statistically he's having a great season. Needs to get more consistent, and it'll come with time.  There are a lot of min guys that are playing at a way higher level. Guys like batum"
"Tatum is good at his age. He has a unique court vision. Look at them full court pass highlights.  Even in the halfcourt setting , i don‚Äôt know if he makes super passes like Lebron but he knows how to utilize screens to score.    Jaylen brown though!"
"He has a better shot at the MIP than 6th man in my opinion.    Look at it historically, Bocuher would need to be getting a lot more shots to get the 17-20 PPG he'd need to pull down the MIP, but if he start getting starting minutes he might get to 13-14 shots and might get up to 18 PPG which puts him in the discussion.  The Blocks will help and might get him some traction but Jerami Grant is putting up 23 PPG right now on 18 shots.  He's running away with it.   Christian Wood also has a good shot, but he's been injured, so if he doesn't play 40+ games, he might not get it.  Some people have Jaylen Brown in the mix, but I don't see them giving the award to someone who went from 20 to 25 PPG.  I think Bocuher comes in 3rd unless both Wood and Grant come back down to earth or miss too many games."
"LeBron, Steph, Jaylen Brown."
"Who does he make it over  Jaylen, harden, or lavine?  Maybe brown right? Idk if he's slowed down"
"I like the other parts of the analysis so I'll offer insight on some Cs stuff. I'll offer some insight on Tatum and then my overall analysis from what I see.  Tatum has been coming along better as a playmaker. He just has to do so much right now. Kemba hopefully is going to improve and help with playmaker, but right now he hasn't been there.  Jaylen is able to be a usually efficient player, this game not withstanding, due to Tatum eating a lot of the defenses attention. Jaylen relies on explosiveness and doing that every possession is a lot to ask too. He also is improving with his playmaker, but Tatum is better from what I have seen.  The other part is, when Tatum plays with the second unit, who is Tatum going to kick to in order to further put pressure on defenses? Semi started the season off well, but has cooled off. Nesmith is not there yet and seems to still be building confidence. Pritchard has been pretty good, but can't be relied on all the time. Grant Williams is getting better, but he is kind of match-up dependent.  Tatum and Brown developed into great players, but they still miss someone like Hayward. Hayward is someone you can drive and kick to and he can further continue putting pressure doing the same thing. He is a good passer too and is someone who can also defend some of the better wings at least to give Tatum some breathing room on defense. Also, I think confidence wise, it was good for him to move to Charlotte where it looks like he has been great for Lamelo, Bridges, Washington and ironically Rozier! (The Celts used to have a 'too many guys problem' and rozier was kinda the odd man out).  Hayward is probably a perfect 3rd guy for this team, however, he obviously was too expensive for the Cs in addition to the fact he felt (and did obviously) he could get paid.  So this off-season, Turner would have been great, but still doesn't solve the 'drive and kick' flow of Stevens offense. He would have been a better 5 than TT, but is also more expensive. The celts will get better with Smart coming back filling in that Hayward role again as he did last season when Hayward was hurt.  Looking at TT, he sorta helps with rebounding, but then creates more traffic in the paint. He can't sit at the 3 point line unless he is doing some kind of dribble hand off. Same with Rob Williams. Theis can do his imitation Horford pick and pop 3 or elbow jumper, but not the whole game.  So the Cs have less space for Jaylen, Tatum, Kemba, Pritchard to operate. Not to mention Teague who is now getting DNPs.  This is all to say too, that when I see the Cs having these 3-4 minute scoring droughts in general, it feels it is role guys not hitting 3s (Doris mentioned the Celts have a terrible record when they don't hit 12 3s a game). It is guys clogging the paint a bit too much. Lastly, bench/foundation inconsistency in general, Grant Williams now getting DNPs, Teague, guys who got like 20 minutes a game at times before."
Shoulda saw that foul on Jaylen brown against trae young it was absolutely horrendous
That girl in the purple looked like Jaylen Brown lmfao.
I thought Jaylen Brown was the problem as well
Which Jaylen Brown? All-star Jaylen Brown?

"""We in here talking about *Jalen.* I mean, listen, we talking about Jalen. Not Jaylen. Not Jaylen. Not Jaylen. We talking about Jalen. Not Jaylen. Not the Jaylen Brown on the Boston Celtics, who played the Nets today. Not Jaylen. We talking about *Jalen,* man."""
You realize for that statement to be true all 30 teams would need to have 3.33 players better than Jaylen brown on their roster....he comfortably sits inside the top 50..very comfortably
I would do:  Jaylen Brown + three FRPs for Zach LaVine.
"If Jaylen brown is an all defensive player, then so is Kelly oubre."
"this thinking is why the celtics are 19-18 and just got shit on by the KD-less Nets. jaylen brown is great. he isn't better than harden, or even close, and shouldn't be untouchable in a trade. but i mean ainge will be ainge. and the celtics will be the celtics. sometimes trading ""what ifs"" for ""sure things"" works out."
"&gt;the one thing i will say is that wiseman needs to get more playing time right now, regardless of how he's playing  I think the issue is that more playing time ‚â† better development.   Yes there's value in letting guys play and get more experience but giving guys free rein to play regardless of performance can often form bad habits.   We benched the shit out of Jaylen Brown and it probably made him a better player. Whereas Tatum was given a longer leash because we were setting him up for a bigger role. It's dependent on the players.  They don't need Wiseman to develop empty volume skills they need him precise and elite within his role. If he has to work on the fundamentals to get playing time then that might benefit him more long term."
I meant that he regressed to the Jaylen Brown he was before the hot start to the season. Obviously that was never going to be sustainable.
Jaylen said that was a misquote actually.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/jaylen-brown-insists-comments-kyrie-135028954.html
"An article came out before the 2019-20 season by Jaylen Brown how he was struggling through the previous season.  That + another report I saw convinced me that if Kyrie re-signed, Jaylen was going to demand a trade."
"I have never seen Jaylen Brown come dap up Kyrie whenever we play the Celtics. Even when he didn't play but traveled with us, he would go and greet Tatum and Smart. Definitely some beef between JB and Kyrie"
"You don‚Äôt get the point. Why lash this out to the media about being a leader? Those were shots to Tatum, Brown and the rest of the young guys. He fucked up their chemistry, heck even Brown responded to his comments.  Kyrie was never a great leader and was never the first option to a championship team.   Im glad all of them are in good terms now.  https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/nba-rumors-kyrie-irvings-relationship-jaylen-brown-probably-worst-celtics"
"Look at who isn't there and wasn't there last time either. Jaylen Brown and Kyrie were not cool AT ALL.   I think it was a mix of Kyrie, JB, Morris, and Rozier causing those chemistry issues. Clearly Smart, Tatum, and the rest of their core still have love for Kyrie."
"Well it perfectly addresses that comment lmao. I don't blame the Celtics for not trading for harden because jaylen brown is amazing, but the stupid fucking attitude people had on that sub about it is so funny. Everyone was calling him a fat flopper who plays no defense lmao"
"Not me, I've been pretty consistent with my opinion that giving up Jaylen is worth taking a chance to try to make a run at a chip.  I understand why people feel otherwise, but me saying that isn't a reaction based off of tonight.  It's me looking at who Harden is and who Brown is and saying that I personally think it is worth giving him and Smart up."
"Gotta love watching Jaylen run with the bench scrubs that wouldn‚Äôt even get minutes on the other team to start the fourth quarter meanwhile the only guy consistently hitting shots, Jayson, sits on the bench, as we go down double digits.  Then Jayson comes in and immediately makes two beautiful shots and cuts the lead to like five drawing a double team also to lead to an easy bucket. What do we do after that you may be asking? Give the ball to Jaylen Brown, and Kemba for a few plays, but mostly Jaylen Brown to miss shot after shot and turn it over, over and over again. I know what your thinking, genius game plan by Brad because then he lets Tatum loose the last two minutes so you can go crazy? Nah. Instead we give it to the guy living on Antarctica over there.  Great game plan Brad, very inspirational.  Also, would like to here your opinions. Do you think Silver comes up to Brad before every game and tells him if he uses his challenge Adam will kill a puppy?  None of that really matters tho. Still fun to watch because we had a couple good scores off of in bounds plays.  On a serious note, every game Marcus Smart plays he moves up on my favorite players of all time list (well mostly every game). Glad he is back."
"&gt; Jayson Tatum looks back. Jaylen Brown. 5/23, 4 turnovers. &gt;  &gt; Get Tatum more help!  Imagine a scenario where a team could have potentially traded said player in a package for ""one of the greatest players in NBA history"""
Did we not watch the same game? Jaylen Brown clearly was not there.
Is there beef between Kyrie and Jaylen Brown? Seemed like Kyrie gave hugs to everyone but Brown after the game. Also noticed they were kinda going at it during the game as well
Jaylen Brown bro üò≠
"Jayson Tatum looks to his friend Kyrie. He has James Harden, one of the greatest players in NBA history.  Jayson Tatum looks back. Jaylen Brown. 5/23, 4 turnovers.  Get Tatum more help!"
Mr Jaylen brown stank it up    5-23 LMFAO what
I was totally wrong on Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown nice
"The four other starters: 16/29 from the field.  Jaylen Brown: 1/9.  I don't want to hear Celtics fans criticize anyone else tonight. They keep criticizing Kemba, Tatum, and the rest of the team but they never talk about Jaylen, who has been shocking for most of the month."
Jaylen Brown is shooting around 20% from downtown in the last seven games.
"sorry guys it‚Äôs my fault, first celts game this season i tune in to and jaylen brown looks like doo doo"
Jaylen Brown is 1/9 right now and somehow Celtics fans are talking about Tatum needs to do this or that better? The cult-following of Jaylen Brown is kind of absurd considering he's not even the Celtics' best player.
"He is so, so good. Insane that Celtics fans refuse to even think about trading Jaylen Brown for Harden."
"Considering how Kemba has looked as of late, a core of Kemba/Tatum/Harden absolutely could have won the championship this year, and it was a doable trade. Jaylen Brown + multiple FRPs could have gotten the trade done.  When KD was healthy Brooklyn looked absolutely unstoppable. I don't see how this season ends in any way other than a Brooklyn championship unless KD gets injured again."
Jaylen Brown might be the worst player in the NBA right now. Really should have traded him for Harden when Danny had the chance. The biggest mistake of Danny's lifetime.
hey celtics - i'm rooting for ya.   I love jaylen brown.   Tatum is underrated  go squadron  i feel dirty  oh fuck i puked  fuck fuck fuck
Brown vs Brown violence  Jaylen vs Bruce
"Lamelo Ball, Ja Morant, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zion Williamson, Luka Doncic"
"The biggest X-factor (even greater than Pascal being awful somehow) was Marcus Smart shooting 39% on 9 attempts from 3. His offensive output was backbreaking for the Raptors. He singlehandedly killed their defensive scheme. They wanted to ice Kemba and Tatum out, and Smart punished them hard. Jaylen Brown also played well but there was a clear cut effort to try and stifle the Celtics offense by smothering their two distributors."
"&gt;And had the worst record in the league and never sniffed the playoffs. Your point? We were talking about playoff teams both of them have played on.  He was a rookie and played 33 games...  My point is that you lied.   &gt;I'm not blamin him at all, those teams were trash, but no one is makin an actual effective argument detailing Embiid's playoff success because he has zilch.   Wow...  First of all, Embiid is a stretch 5 who shoots mid-range and 3s so naturally his FG% is going to be lower. This is why we use EFG% and TS%.  Second of all, he literally took the eventual champions to 7 games.  &gt;He shoots &lt;45% in the playoffs as a 7'0"" Center   Dude, are you just gonna continue to make shit up? TIL 45.9% &lt; 45%...   &gt;and hasn't show he can elevate his team in the playoffs like prime Dwight - yet.  I‚Äôm sure Dwight was elevating his team a ton with his 1.2 assists per game.  Embiid averages 2.9 apg in the playoffs btw, over twice as much.  &gt;He had Butler (the guy who took the Lakers to 6 games in the Finals) &amp; Simmons healthy one year and the furthest he got was the 2nd round, and that team was better than any Orlando team Dwight played with.  Yes, and they literally took the eventual champions to 7 games (which took a historical performance and a game winner by Kawhi for the Raptors to win).  &gt;Lol, disprove what I actually said then.  Gladly.   You said   &gt;Even if he didn't have Ben, getting swept by two 20 year olds and an allstar who's never won a playoff series before is laughable.  Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown were 22 and 23 years old, respectively, in that series, not ‚Äú20 years old.‚Äù"
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have already won 5 playoff series in 3 years. None of the players/teams you mentioned have won any. That's why the only teams I said can rival us are the Nuggets who have won 3 and the Sixers who have won 2. Forgive me if I don't take teams seriously who haven't accomplished anything.   RemindMe! 2 years  Let's have a discussion on the state of the Celtics then.
Jaylen Brown has gotten a lot better. Bucks have been worse this year and Philly made only marginal improvements like Seth Curry. Boston swept them last year
"&gt;  Boston, Miami and Denver have been three of the most banged up teams in the league but only the first two get acknowledged because they are big market.  But again no... As I said:  &gt;Even then, we got plenty of comments talking about how Boston was disappointing, it's only now we're out of the woods the media is willing to acknowledge most of those injuries were even a factor.  &gt;Hell, about 2 weeks ago DWade was on national television saying the reason we were losing was because Tatum and Brown needed to 'learn how to win', nevermind those two have been historic in their ability to win at a young age.  Plus we had about 1-2 months of ""who is more to blame, Danny Ainge or Brad Stevens?""  You're comparing Boston's media reception as they're coming out injuries to Jamal's media reception while he was still dealing with injuries.  The complaints you think we weren't getting, we were getting. Go to ESPN's youtube account and scroll back, you'll see plenty of examples.    * [Danny Ainge is not blaming Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown for the Celtics' 'major funk' | KJZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VPgwKQ-2e8)  * [This is rock bottom for the Boston Celtics - Kendrick Perkins | KJZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE3Gj60BPBw)  * [Brad Stevens is in trouble - Stephen A. thinks the Celtics head coach is on the hot seat |First Take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JYx7OuTHWI)  * [The Celtics are walking over Brad Stevens - Kendrick Perkins | First Take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-CBhYWQCqo)  The national media doesn't give anyone credit for being banged up until those guys start playing better and then the credit is applied retrospectively. It's not about Denver being a smaller market than Boston, because our team has gone through the same scrutiny."
"He's been exclusively a SG this year. Not in the past, but even he and Nash have said so.  I would also include Booker, Jaylen Brown, Zach Lavine, Donovan Mitchell and Shai Gilgeous Alexander"
"Not really though. We get a passing mention but most people would be amazed with the injuries Boston has had.   Remember when Jaylen got benched during the turbulent 2018-19 season?  In November/December he had:  * Back Spasms * Plantar Fasciitis * Shooting Hand Injury (never explained but his hand was wrapped for about a month)  None of that was really talked about as a reason for his struggles. It was all ""Brown is struggling in a new role"" and ""the young Celtics were pushing too hard for responsibilities they weren't ready for"".   Then the media started reporting that he was figuring things out and adapting to his new role towards the end of the season. No, he just got healthy.  Exact same thing Murray is dealing with now. His injuries were ignored while he was struggling then as he got better people started to retrospectively accept them.  &gt;""Denver doesn't have the same excuses as Boston""   Even here, you're sort of proving yourself wrong. We're 36 games into the season... Our starters have played together once. Yes, your team is banged up, but Jamal having issues isn't comparable to what our team has dealt with so far.   We were 8-3 before a 3-week period where:  * Tatum was diagnosed with symptomatic covid * Brown started missing games with tendonitis * Smart went down with a calf strain * Kemba came back slow from a knee procedure * Pritchard went down with an MCL sprain  That's our 5 best perimeter players all severely limited in a 3-week span. Denver doesn't have the same excuses as Boston.  Even then, we got plenty of comments talking about how Boston was disappointing, it's only now we're out of the woods the media is willing to acknowledge most of those injuries were even a factor.   Hell, about 2 weeks ago DWade was on national television saying the reason we were losing was because Tatum and Brown needed to 'learn how to win', nevermind those two have been historic in their ability to win at a young age."
I don‚Äôt think so . He just started playing basketball a couple of years ago and is a very hard worker. I feel like I can see him following a jaylen brown trajectory.
"&gt; If you keep thinking your window is later you‚Äôre gonna reach a point where Tatum and browns deals are gonna be up and it‚Äôs not a lock the resign.   Our window isn't now because Tatum and Brown aren't good enough as players yet.   All you dumb Nets and Lakers fans who have an agenda against the Celtics like to create this faux state of urgency for the Celtics, when, if you actually fucking watched a Celtics game, you'd know that both players have a LONG way to go as players if they want to compete for a championship if they are the best players on the team. Neither of them know how to make anybody on their team better.   &gt; People aren‚Äôt clowning you for not trading for jrue they‚Äôre clowning you guys for having the best draft capital haul in history and not making a title contender with it  The 2018-19 Celtics had a starting 5 of Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford and a bench of Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes.   That was the best 9-man rotation anybody in the NBA had that year. Vegas had us as favorites to make it out of the Eastern Conference.   Not Danny Ainge's fault that Gordon Hayward was a shell of himself after he broke his fucking leg and couldn't be the 2nd best player on the team like he was supposed to be."
"Tatum.   Brown is the better man defender, Tatum is the better help defender, which is why they pair well together. Tatum is a better man defender than Brown is help defender though, Jaylen isn't great at staying engaged in the play when he's not involved in it."
"Beal, Lavine, Jaylen Brown, probably could get some guys from the Rockets(Gordon, Tucker, Oladipo, maybe Wood would be available), Pacers(Brogdon &amp; Myles Turner), Demar Derozan, Aaron Gordon, John Collins, Kevin Love &amp; another piece from Cavs. Lotta help out there."
No order btw  1. LeBron James 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. Anthony Davis 4. James Harden 5. Kevin Durant 6. Stephen Curry 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Paul  George 9. Damian Lillard 10. Joel Embiid 11. Nikola Jokic 12. Luka Doncic 13. Zion Williamson (yes that's right) 14. Chris Paul 15. Giannis  16. Rudy Gobert 17. Donovan Mitchell 18. Jimmy Butler 19. Jaylen Brown 20. Ben Simmons  maybe a healthy KP top 25
" we would have had to gave up Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart . We didn't have the same team the Raps had also so you can't say we would have won, and the Spurs wanted a  proven player. Jaylen Brown just came off a great playoff run but didn't have the resum as Derozen and the Spurs probably would have still took the Derozan deal. Also in 2019-20 are roster would have been  garbage with both Kyrie and Kawhi leaving."
"lamelo is unique, jaylen is more unique to say than brown, with luka you can go either way tbh"
And jaylen brown went to the conference Finals in 2020 as well
Jaylen Brown averaged 14 PPG on league average TS% &amp; 18 PPG on better efficiency in the playoffs as a second option an ECF team in his second year
Let's compare him to Jaylen Brown in his 2nd year. 6.6 points on below average efficiency oh boy he's a future Kawhi!
"Even if he's fully healthy there are definitely 15 players better  LeBron, KD, Steph, harden, Kawhi, Giannis, Doncic, Jokic, embiid, Lillard, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Bradley Beal, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Ben Simmons, Booker"
No? thats why I said hes the best young guy they could expect to get. They aint getting anyone like jaylen brown.
Boston would have been pretty low odds of winning a chip with Kawhi. Probably 10% at best. Do you give up Jaylen Brown for a 10% chance at a title?   Even the Raptors were pretty low odds before it happened. A lot has to fall your way to win it all.
"Rob looks elite, Pritchard is solid, and the league is about to recognize Romeo now that he is back. I actually like our young guys a lot. Those ""young assets"" you refer to became Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum. What could they have traded them away for that would be better than ending up with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown?"
Jaylen Brown and 3 first round picks for LMA. Boston also throws in $5mil cash to me for suggesting this brilliant idea. Who says no?
"First of all just lol. Got Lakers fans are ridiculous. I‚Äôm not gonna hold my players to the same standards as the literal GOAT/Second best player of all time.  Secondly, never called them a superstar...no one does. They are stars, all stars, but superstars are like the top 7 or so players.  I can‚Äôt get over the fact you just said we should hold Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown to the same playmaking standard as LeBron freaking James lol what"
"Bro not offering them is disingenuous lol. Your point didn‚Äôt disprove mines that we still didn‚Äôt and don‚Äôt have the assets that Brooklyn did to make the deal work. You didn‚Äôt refute my point at all about us not having an Allen, I don‚Äôt care if Smart and Levert are close to each other as players   All the reports that came out said Houston wanted Brown and Smart. We weren‚Äôt getting the deal done replacing Jaylen Brown with a bunch of low 1st round picks"
'#5 recruit coming out of highschool.  1. Ben Simmons  2. Skal Labissiere  3. Brandon Ingram  4. Jaylen Brown  5. Henry Ellenson
Wiseman reminds me of a big man version of Jaylen brown. Gifted athletically but lacking skill wise. I think wiseman is more polished on the skill level than brown was coming into their rookie years by their respective positions. I don‚Äôt know why people are joking on him?   Wiseman is problem.
Clutch those Jaylen brown pearls Celtic fans
"Why was an article about the upcoming trade deadline written where the Celtics potential pursuit of Harrison Barnes using the Hayward TPE was discussed, probably because the trade deadline is happening soon.  Who Amick‚Äôs sources are and what they suggested Ainge did differently than Ainge publicly suggested he did in pursuit of James Harden, I don‚Äôt know because Amick didn‚Äôt say.   The article links to an NBC Sports Boston article/video of a radio interview Ainge gave. In the interview Ainge said they had conversations with the Rockets but not recently as they were not coming down on the price they were asking for and the Celtics didn‚Äôt want to pay that. Given how trades work and assuming the Rockets didn‚Äôt want Kemba, Jaylen Brown would have needed to have been traded for the Celtics to get Harden. I don‚Äôt really see how if the Celtics actually offered Brown why the Rockets wouldn‚Äôt have gone for that instead of what they did get. And if the sources are saying, ‚ÄúAinge said he didn‚Äôt have talks recently before the trade had happened, but actually the Celtics did have a recent phone call before the trade,‚Äù then I certainly get why they left that tid bit ambiguous."
Jaylen Brown isn't top20 player.
If we‚Äôre talking about currently Od have to say Jaylen Brown
"I can definitely believe Danny repeatedly called Houston's FO and ""showed"" interest.   What I dont buy is that he ever included Jaylen Brown.   So his ""interest"" in Harden wasnt actually real, he never actually made an offer that was probably serious."
Ainge would never have traded Jaylen Brown for Harden. Especially with only 2 years left on his deal.
"during that time, didn‚Äôt jaylen brown really break out and now they‚Äôre running more plays for brown? it also could be covid, idk"
kyrie wont get it over beal or jaylen brown (source: the media voting for the all star game)
I would be careful about giving up this much for Barnes   Weighing the most recent 35 game sample size of a guys career over his entire career is the type of thing bad franchises do when making trades   I also don‚Äôt think Barnes can be an actual small ball 5 which would help Boston. His improved playmaking is cool but he‚Äôs not keeping up 63% TS his defense is Jaylen brown esque switchable guy who looks the part but gets overrated because his on ball defense is a lot better than off ball.  He‚Äôs fine....but he‚Äôs also the classic prototype of a player who through the totality of his career the idea of Harrison Barnes is better than the reality of him. I would just be very careful this is easily the type of move that a year from now people can look back on and be like ‚Äúwait what did they do‚Äù
"I would say his offensive peak is like a bit below Jaylen Brown but his defense is really high, like easily 1st team all defense kind of player"
"I‚Äôm not trying to hate on Randle, and I think he‚Äôs closer to too 30, but since I already did 19 players I‚Äôll keep going:  Curry, KD, LeBron, Harden, Giannis, Dame, AD, Kawhi, George, Embiid, Jokic, Butler, Simmons, Gobert, Booker, Paul, Kyrie, Beal, Vucevic, KAT, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zion, Zach Lavine, Trae Young, SGA, Luka,  Bam Adebayo  That‚Äôs 28, there‚Äôs probably some players that are slipping my mind right now. But that puts him right around top 30, like I said. Idk about 36th though, unless we start counting guys that are out like Klay Thompson, Nurkic, CJ, etc."
..Jaylen Brown?
Getting Paul George vs Jaylen Brown was a legitimately stressful moment I love this.
"Reggie is just too corny for me in a bad way. Both those dudes are like listening to younger kids getting excited about something but don‚Äôt know what to say. Most recently when he said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a foul‚Äù like 4 times in a row louder every time after jaylen brown hit the 3pt contest rack. He came up with something clever and then just shouted it over and over. I think what makes a great commentator is being able to keep your wits about you when you get excited or come up with something clever, a-la Richard Jefferson or the Hornets announcer in crunch time"
Jaylen Brown having a reputation as a great defender baffles me. I don't get it at all.
I support Jaylen Brown and Jaylen Brown alone.
Nah Jayson just has ‚Äúit‚Äù he‚Äôs gonna be a perennial All NBA player and probably MVP. Can‚Äôt see Jaylen brown reaching that point
Jaylen brown is quite arguable. Still might take Simmons.
I don't understand what you want to say? Edwards has shown plenty of promise and was always a project pick like Jaylen Brown.
You didn't even consider Jaylen Brown.
Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown
"Jaylen Brown.  Very good player on the court, even better person off it."
Meyers for Jaylen Brown who says no?
If your playmaking consists of 'creating' many low value shots the defense actually wants you to take you are not a great playmaker.  Tatum has a flashy style and reminds people of the Kobe archetype and that's why he gets overated .  Jaylen Brown is less flashy but the  better and more efficient basketball player
"&gt; Jalen Brown is the better player and should play a larger role   Only thing Jaylen got on Tatum is efficiency. Tatum is a better playmaker/defender/shooter. Jaylen is good, but there a reason why teams put they best defenders on Tatum."
Either Playoff P or Jaylen Brown.
Jaylen Brown
"Look I love Jaylen Brown but Tatum is a significantly better playmaker than him and a very good defender. He‚Äôs just the better player than Brown, and that‚Äôs fine. Both very good. He needs to get more efficient sure, but he‚Äôs not an ‚Äúiso-chucker‚Äù, he‚Äôs a very good all-around player that settles for jumpers too much."
"Jaylen Brown isn‚Äôt an important role player though, he‚Äôs an all star all-nba type player"
*Finally* making me look good for wanting him over Jaylen Brown in the 2016 Draft   ............  ....
"yea Dame and Steph should have the greenlight to do this, an occasional lefuckyou 3 is fine as well but no way in hell should jaylen brown be pulling up from 35 feet"
"Smart is the best passer on the team, youre right.  Smart to Jaylen Brown was a deadly 2 man game this year as well."
Jaylen Brown is also out there.
"I actually agree. I'd put him as 1b to Randle's 1a above guys like Grant, Wood, etc. I think Randle's got a better chance to win because he's got a better narrative in terms of the Knicks becoming a (fingers crossed) playoff team and the whole beyblade meme he had going for him in prior years, but Jaylen Brown's improvement has been monstrous. I think Brown probably showed off too much of his improvement in the bubble though to get fair consideration, and having Tatum on the same team probably doesn't help in terms of visibility."
"I know I'm a C's fan but, Jaylen Brown has a solid case. His numbers and percentages are all way up. Like Randle he was a first time all-star. Very similar growth, just second fiddle."
kuzma - 5 million  tatum - 3.6 million  jaylen - 1.4 million  kuzma = tatum + brown CONFIRMED
"Nah, I wrote it out because saying ‚Äúhonest mavs fan‚Äù reminds me of how the biggest Jaylen Brown hater Devic3 has a Jaylen Brown flair and pfp"
"u/devic3: As an honest Jaylen Brown fan I must admit that he deserves to be traded for Norman Powell. If we must, we should throw in a pick as well. Not only that but Jaylen is worthless and his 40 pt game was a fluke. If Tatum and Jaylen are stars, why aren‚Äôt the Celtics winn- oh shit they are- the Celtics are only winning because of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown is doing nothing. The Green Teamers will disagree but you know it‚Äôs true, Jaylen is not a good player. Remember, all this is coming from an honest fan. Me, u/devic3."
"im not sure if it was on hoop collective, but during the second kyrie season jackie mac went on some pod to talk about why the celtics were struggling. she had this really weird segment where she went on about how jaylen brown isn't as smart as he thinks he is, and the team secretly laughs at him behind his back about it. the whole conversation had this weird vibe like they were trying to call him uppity in different words. wish i could find it but i dont feel like searching, prime r/agedlikemilk material"
"It is inconsequential but I actually prefer Wagner over Parker. At least Wagner tries, even though he's just not good. Parker doesn't even try on defense, and we already have Jaylen Brown for that so why do we need a second one?"
Yeah....but then it has enes kanter ahead of jaylen brown.....
[POV: You're Siakam in the playoffs last year and Jaylen Brown was just assigned to guard you](https://www.acsh.org/sites/default/files/images/No_spin_zone_Home_Inspections.jpg)
"Exactly. I guarantee this guy wouldn't be mad if Tatum or Jaylen Brown said some shit like that, he'd be hype. Like Embiid does that shit all the time and everyone loves that shit here in Philly"
Jaylen Brown considered
I am still not so sure on that theory. I‚Äôd really like to see what a fully healthy and integrated lineup of Smart-Fournier-Jaylen-Tatum-RWIII looks like. The size upgrade of slotting Fournier in at the 2 alone increases our defensive upside a lot and if him and smart primarily operate as passers and open look shooters while Tatum and Brown take most of the shots I think we could be great. No disrespect to Kemba as he‚Äôs been a lot better lately but I think that lineup has more upside
Did Jaylen Brown die?
"1st - Harden, Luka, LeBron, Giannis, Jokic  2nd - Dame, Curry, Leonard, Durant, Embiid  3rd - Mitchell, Booker, Williamson, George, Gobert   HM - CP3 (no arguments if you swap him for Book), Beal, Lavine, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum"

Jaylen Brown isn't even on a bag of chips!
"Seriously. If Celtics fans were really impressed by this performance tonight against a Lakers team that's missing half their players, then I dunno, maybe the bar for what they expect has just been set unbelievably low for them this year. Outside of Jaylen Brown who seemingly couldn't miss, I didn't see much at all from Boston that was very impressive tonight.  To answer the OP's question, no, I don't think the Celtics have a chance in hell of beating Philly if both teams are fully healthy."
"Yeah Jaylen Brown just took over at the end there to put us ahead, good game Laker fans"
I really like Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Hope they're Celtic lifers.
Try to guard Jaylen and you too can get an education at Brown University
"goddamn, jaylen brown couldn't miss"
I choose to celebrate Jaylen Brown rather than denigrate the bench.
I didn't know Lebron already came back and played for the celtics. Goddamn what a dad-dicking by Jaylen Brown.

Jaylen Brown? Or Michael Jordan?
"Brown is a better scorer, Tatum is the better player.   It's kind of bizarre how it's turned out that way considering what was thought about them coming out of college. Tatum is way better at all the things I thought he wouldn't be good at, and less good at the thing I thought he'd be great at (scoring), and Jaylen is the opposite, he's way better as a scorer than I ever thought I'd be, and I'm a bit disappointed in the other aspects of his game, like off-ball defense and total lack of playmaking, although he's gotten better with that this year."
"Jaylen Brown is having the game of his life, how are you surprised lol. Man is a flamethrower right now."
Jaylen fucking brown. He‚Äôs goin for 40 tonight
Jaylen Brown is good at dribbling and shooting and scoring

He made a post in the Boston sub about not wanting to trade Jaylen Brown for James Harden that got over 1k upvotes and no one realized he was being sarcastic except me I guess. Trolled our whole sub and it was truly embarrassing.

"Celtics could have traded for him. It would have taken Jaylen Brown...   I love Brown, but that upsets me almost every day."
"Because no one wants to play, especially not this year. This was the starting 5 in 2019 give or take a few players ( Jaylen Brown and Tatum). I think it might be worse this year, any player making it past the 1st round will probably sit out the olympics."
"He‚Äôs on my all good dude/guy to have a beer with   Steph  Kris Jaylen Brown Ant Edwards Dame time   My starting 5   Not to great on the glass, but we would score some puntos!!"

I really thought Kris Dunn was going to be an all-star at some point. I also thought the Celtics we're absolute morons for taking Jaylen Brown over him which goes to show what I know.

"And is Jaylen Brown not doing exactly that?   ""If you're watching this, listening or tuning in, I want you to know your life has value."" He didn't say ""black people tuning in"", he said 'you'.   People advocating for black rights want equality. And right now, raising black people up is the first step in that direction. You can find a shitty human being of any race, but when a whole race is being mistreated we're never talking about white people, because they're not being mistreated."
I love Jaylen brown
"Jaylen Brown is such an amazing person. For a guy who is so young, he's really become a leader in the league when it comes to BLM movement. Definitely a player I have the utmost respect for."
Thank you for proving my point. Tell that to the NBA. Nothing matters to them except an opportunity to make more money. So all this talk about politics is gonna keep happening. Remember the good old days when sports was actually bringing people together? So long as players like Jaylen Brown keep towing the corporate line those days will never come back. It's sad that we have lost sight of what amazing things sports could do and have sold out for money.
"&gt;Playstyle wise, Damian Lillard and Trae Young are the most similar players to Stephen Curry  They're similar player in that they're small, (kind of) skinny and happy to pull up from anywhere, but their playstyle as in how often they run what sort of actions on court is very different. Curry famously engages in a lot of off-ball movement where fewer fouls are generally called and even then are less likely to not lead to FTs (pre-bonus), and less PnR/iso where it's the ball-handler that's getting fouled. But when he runs PnR/iso plays, he gets fouled at similar rates to the other guys mentioned.  *This isn't to say refs fail to call lots of fouls committed by defensive players on Curry -- just looking if there are disparities in how often he gets a call when running a PnR/Iso play.*  (Data from this season, just as a sanity check, not as a be all end all. Using the 4 players mentioned above and a few other notable high usage ball-handlers/non-bigs.)  [PnR Ball Handler](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/ball-handler/):  |player|possessions/game|SFL frequency (%)| |:-|:-|:-| |Curry|7.5|11.0| |Dame|12.8|11.9| |Trae|14.3|11.9| |Harden (BKN)|8.4|11.6| |Luka|13.5|10.8| |LeBron|5.3|12.8| |Booker|6.2|10.9|  &amp;#x200B;  [Isolation](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/isolation/):  |player|possessions/game|SFL frequency (%)| |:-|:-|:-| |Curry|1.6|15.1| |Dame|4.8|13.4| |Trae|2.1|15.5| |Harden (BKN)|8.3|14.9| |Luka|4.9|7.7| |LeBron|4.6|7.9| |Giannis|4.5|15.1| |Booker|3.1|13.7|  Curry doesn't exactly stand-out in terms of how often he gets a foul call. He does stand out in terms of how often he runs an action he's likely to get a shooting foul on.   &amp;#x200B;  Curry does however lead in how many handoff plays he runs -- [let's look at the top-10 guys in terms of handoff possessions](https://go.nba.com/mc0m) and Booker since he's close and appears in tables above:  |player|possessions/game|SFL frequency (%)| |:-|:-|:-| |Murray|3.2|7.2| |Curry|2.9|9.8| |Duncan Robinson|2.8|3.3| |Beal|2.8|9.9| |McDermott|2.4|5.9| |Jaylen Brown|2.3|8.8| |Jerami Grant|2.1|10.9| |Hayward|2.0|9.3| |LaVine|1.9|7.1| |Dame|1.9|8.1| |Booker|1.6|6.7|  Two things to note -- Curry is not low on the list of Shooting Foul frequency. Also, the overall shooting-foul-frequency is lower than on PnR/Iso plays -- defenders know not to foul the 3pt shooter.  This is just a quick, sanity-check look at why Curry probably has a lower baseline of foul calls and FTA than some other players -- running plays with a lower likelihood of a shooting foul more often, not simply getting calls less often on the same kind of plays.  *Again, this isn't to say refs fail to call lots of fouls committed by defensive players on Curry -- just looking if there are disparities in how often he gets a call when running a PnR/Iso play.*"
Lol your comment history talks about how he sucks and how Jaylen brown should be the untouchable one
I‚Äôm still not sure the Celtics understand that Jaylen Brown is as good as Jayson Tatum.
"KPJ and Wood were steals, but it is a shame they couldn't get a better return for Harden. Was Ben Simmons or Jaylen Brown really not available? Porter, Wood, plus either Simmons or Brown would be a really nice guard/wing/big combo to build around."
Timoth√© Luwawu-Cabarrot   Ben Simmons   Jaylen Brown
"Our last five years :  Jaylen Brown, Semi Ojeleye, Jayson Tatum, Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard  The Heats last five years :  Achiuwa, Herro, Adebayo  How is theirs better lol"
He's not even the Celtics' most valuable player! Jaylen Brown brings more impact to Boston's game.
I gotta imagine Jaylen Brown is gonna be president at some point

Jaylen Brown is observing Ramadan?
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum.  And Aaron Nesmith.
No but Jaylen Brown just made a fuck you three and is the new Michael Jordan
"Jaylen Brown would smoke Dr. J's All-NBA first team, even without Tatum"
Jaylen ‚ÄúI took that personally‚Äù Brown
Jaylen Brown is the best SG in the league I don‚Äôt care how biased I am fuck y‚Äôall hes amazing
JAYLEN BROWN: 20  HORNETS: 19
Jaylen Brown just outscored the Hornets in the 1st quarter
"I mean you're kinda proving my point. Kemba got more media votes than almost every other eastern conference guard combined. His % of media votes was similar to Luka, Harden, Lebron, AD, and Giannis.   Compare that to player vote % and those players were all significantly higher. Like Kemba's number of player votes is by far the lowest amount of votes for every player that finished #1 across every category for the past 3 years.   He was also #3 in fan votes by a very slim margin.   If you need anymore proof, just look at how well Jaylen Brown did in media votes this year."

"seven completed seasons  * missed playoffs first season, made it in six straight since * knocked out of playoffs first round twice, made it to second round four straight since * made conference finals three times, lost to greatest player of this generation twice * coached a team of rookies to the finals * helped coach jayson tatum from a raw player with awful shot selection to a team leader, 2 x all star, 1 x all nba, high level defensive and offensive player * helped coach jaylen brown from a player most people cringed to watch into one a legitimate all star with solid handles, leadership, and scoring ability * has done all of this with one(?) season of a fully healthy team  i think finishing top 4 three times in a thirty team league is pretty solid accomplishment considering he's had no superstars to work with"
thank you. Jrue gives off the same vibe as Jaylen Brown: calm and in control. and smooooth
Lol Jaylen Brown had 9 of his 40 points against the Lakers in the 4th on 4/15. Boston at one point was up by 27 with like 9 mins left.   He was 17/20 for the night. Dude just had it going and went for his career high (fell two points short).
"But you agree Lebron is better than a normal all star right? Because then you can‚Äôt have the same expectations for Jaylen Brown as Lebron. If it isn‚Äôt crazy for Lebron to win by 1, then it isn‚Äôt crazy for Jaylen to lose by 5 if you think Lebron is a better enough player to be expected to add at least six more points via scoring/assists. For the most part, players try to win on the court. Both our teams were missing our best and third best scorer and we were missing our starting big man and our sixth man is still struging with long term covid effects after coming back a couple games ago. Besides Jaylen, our starters went 4/17 4/14 1/3 and 1/4. Our rookie off the bench was our second best scorer and of the eight other players in the game, four scored two points, one scored five, one scored eleven and one scored fourteen."
Jaylen ‚ÄúDespite the Loss‚Äù Brown
"I feel like OG is gonna make a Jaylen Brown type of leap into a 20+ PPG scorer. Frankly, I'm not thrilled about it.   Toronto is always ready with the gimmick defenses. Doubling KD everytime he touched it. Classic KD didn't force anything. We have some serious shooters so Toronto kinda dodged a bullet but it took us out of rhythm."
So Jaylen Brown is better then Kyrie? Cmon dude. Stop being a clown.
"Absolutely it is.     Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Evan Fournier ... we had an all-star, they don't have anybody close to being an all-star."
My question is how much of that is coaching and how much of that is personnel? Because that just sounds a lot like Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum's games
If we are being honest ainge has been a bad drafter outside of jaylen brown and jayson Tatum   He should have either traded some of those picks for veterans who can shoot or used those picks for guys with maybe lower upside but guys who could be solid rotation guys.
"Jaylen Brown and Payton Pritchard: 67 points, 22/41 shooting, 8/20 from 3, 5 turnovers  Rest of the Celtics: 48 points, 19/55 shooting, 3/29 from 3, 9 turnovers"
They were missing some guys but come on the fact you have Jaylen brown should‚Äôve been an automatic win ü§£
Naw man okc is sitting out a ton of guys and basically are trying to lose games right now. Jaylen brown smart and co should be enough to beat this okc team with no sga and horford
The only players that should be shooting are Payton Pritchard and Jaylen Brown.
"We have 2 players in double digits, Payton Pritchard and Jaylen Brown. sad"
"Would have loved to see SGA play. He's so much better than Jaylen Brown, I wish we had him instead."
"That was not the opinion at the time. Jayson Tatum was the prize and the Celtics had Jaylen Brown too. Especially since Julius Randle left in free agency and was not on the team Lebron joined.  But there were many other teams. For example the Suns, who had Devin Booker and Josh Jackson. The Jazz with Donovan Mitchell and Dante Exum. The Sixers with Simmons and Fultz. Heck he could have gone to the Timberwolves and flipped KAT for Ad."
yeah maybe he'll be as good as jaylen brown one day if he's lucky. kawhi is a pipe dream
Jaylen Brown  Jalen Green  Coby White  Michael Redd  Tarik Black  Aaron Gray  Derek Rose  Hassan Whiteside  Cam Reddish  Red Robbins
"Kevin Durant wouldn't join a Nets team that already have Jaylen Brown, Jason Tatum &amp; Shai Gilgeous Alexander."
I was hoping for Jaylen Brown contract but it's pretty much a max now.
"&gt;**They could have** a starting line up with Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie Irving , James Harden, and Kevin Durant   But they wouldn't"
"I hate to entertain this post but you forgot Colin Sexton. He was selected with one of Nets picks. To go back even further, we traded the 6th pick for Gerald Wallace. 6th pick turned into Damian Lillard.   So really its:  Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie Irving , James Harden, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, and Colin Sexton"
"Yeah the Wizards were top 5 in pace &amp; transition points last season in the games with Beal, and their offensive rank was about 10 spots higher (they also had more team assists and fewer turnovers).  Westbrook is definitely underrated in a lot of ways bc of the hustle he brings, his rebounding is flat out impressive when you watch it up close every day. But I don't think its an unfair criticism to point out that he isn't really an ideal player to build around as a 1st or 2nd option. Ideally the Wizards would have a more efficient 2nd option (like a Jaylen Brown type) and Russ would be slotted as a #3 who can give you a steady 16/6/8 and occasionally go off here and there."
Who's your favorite teammate ever? Crossing my fingers for Jaylen brown lmao
Can you find me a black Jaylen Brown Jersey? He's my favorite player (you're a close second) I live in LA and want to rock one but they are sold out everywhere online.
"part of Boston's problem with trades over the past few years was that every potential trade partner was demanding Jaylen. he was good enough that Boston didn't want to part with him and everyone wanted him, but he wasn't so good that Boston could credibly declare him untouchable.   so every meaningful trade would have involved trading the future for the present, which doesn't seem like a great idea when your best asset (Tatum) is really young. they possibly could have won a title a couple years ago by trading Jaylen for Kawhi, but that would have cost them 5+ years of Brown alongside Tatum in exchange for a 1-year window.  thankfully that period should be over and Boston can now make substantive trades without the other team thinking they can get Jaylen back.  they did make the Kemba deal not that long ago. it hasn't worked out but it was a pretty big move.  as for Vuc, they were not going to pay the tax this year and Vuc would have put them into the tax. by staying out of the tax this year they reset, meaning they will have fewer salary limitations when Tatum/Brown have hopefully matured into a tandem that can win a title.   NBA teams outside of San Antonio just don't have 10 year windows, and acting like they were in a window this year would have robbed their potential window on the other end. if Boston has a chance to have a real window during Tatum's age 25-30 seasons they shouldn't damage that so they can win a playoff series as a non-contender this year. 2021 Tatum is not good enough to be the best player on a championship team."
How has it been having Jaylen Brown as a teammate?
Does the locker room or team get kinda uncomfortable right before the trade deadline? I‚Äôm a huge Jaylen brown fan and I was nervous to hear his name getting thrown around.
Wiseman and pick for Jaylen Brown?
"it's not a false equivalency you're suggesting we trade our best player and get nothing of value immediately back  tatum is 3 years younger than randle.. wow  randle - 24/10/6  20 PER  tatum - 25/7.4/4.3  20 PER  such a fAlSE eQuIvalEnCy  so again, do you want to give up your best player for a ""collection of assets"" that you can maybe trade for someone to pair with jaylen brown?"
"Hi Tatum.   1. Do you find it weird when you get referred to as Tatum instead of Jayson?  2. You and Jaylen Brown are quite the tandem. Given that you get to watch him, both on the court and off the court, what do you admire most in his game? Is there something you see in his game/personality that you wish you had or are trying to emulate?"
Who would win: you and Jaylen brown vs 100 animatronic bags of delicious Ruffles potato chips assuming the refs are also animatronic Ruffles and the shot clock is turned off?
What relationship do you have with Jaylen Brown?
"My biggest question is what is it like to play with Jaylen Brown? A fellow rising superstar, how do you guys motivate each other?"
Who wins the 1v1s between you and jaylen brown
fist fight to the death who wins you or jaylen brown
You mean all-star and all-defense player Al Horford? 1st team all-defense Marcus Smart? And another lottery pick in Jaylen Brown? That roster?
Apparently Jaylen Brown is also fasting? Didn't know he was Muslim
"Mavs need another legitimate star bro. Porzingis isn't gonna cut it. He's injured half the time, and is a defensive liability for the C position. A strong defensive big is very important, especially in this era of Giannis, AD, Embiid and Jokic. Or we need a top defensive wing who can also score 20 a game, like a Middleton or Jaylen Brown. It's very difficult for Luka to win by himself against these stacked western conference teams."
"&gt; I hope they draft a player who turns into a complete stud  Maybe someone like Jayson Tatum? Or what about a guy like Jaylen Brown? Yeah, having either one of them on your team would be great I think."

You know Jaylen Brown is Muslim as well right? Celtics fans have their own Muslim
"Ok, harden in 2015 was the second highest scorer in the league. Donovan mitchell is 11th this year. You‚Äôre committing the same error people make when they compare true shooting percentages across eras. A lot has changed in basketball since warriors mania.   I never said Donovan mitchell will not improve, but there are a lot of players that are also young that are more likely to be the next generation of ‚Äúsuper stars.‚Äù Luka and giannis are already superstars. Zion already seems more likely to be a super star than mitchell. To name a few others, we got Devin booker, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Ja Morant, and then a few more that I really think will be better even though there‚Äôs not a lot to go on I.e. lamelo ball and Michael Porter jr. Not to mention there will be more and more players pouring into the league, other guys that improve as well like maybe Anthony Edwards, and some current super stars that are still decently young like Anthony Davis and will be taking up those spots for the next while in Mitchell‚Äôs career.   Basically, I don‚Äôt really believe mitchell will ever be a borderline top 5 player and I actually believe he‚Äôll probably stay at around 15-20 for most of his career  Edit: ad is actually 28, but there‚Äôs others like jokic that are 26 and will be considered better than mitchell for like the next 6 to 8 years probably"
"He finished 9th and won a total of 7 points. In that sense Robert Covington, Jrue Holiday and Jaylen Brown were in the conversation for DPOTY because they all finished with a similar amount of points. His own teammate finished 3 spots higher than him."
"&gt; Nets missing KD/Harden   Jaylen Brown,Kemba Walker, Robert Williams III did not play that game"
You have a longer window with luka because he hasn‚Äôt even reached his second contract yet. Jaylen brown is on the clock for some teams to ask about him and those rumors being real in about 2 years or so. Luka not for another 4 years.  I imagine Dallas will start hearing similar questions in a year or 2. I also think Dallas has been more aggressive than Boston has so far.  The logical way to go about team building is to improve your team and it doesn‚Äôt feel like ainge did that last offseason and if he keeps these same guys this offseason that also isn‚Äôt a way to improve the team
"Jaylen brown absolutely could leave.  But so could luka. You wouldn‚Äôt be saying that the mavs should be throwing in all their chips to make win now moves because luka might leave today, right?  Why would the Celtics do that when brown has gotten a lot more success than luka has in the playoffs?   If the Celtics players are leaving, pretty much any young player not on the warriors or lakers would be leaving too. I don‚Äôt think that that‚Äôs a logical way to go about team building."
"Fair point but comparing the pistons situation to the Celtics situation isn‚Äôt really accurate. Pistons doing win now moves when their main option was Andre Drummond was stupid but the Celtics have already shown they are contenders, to take the next step they have to go for it at some point.  Boston still has a somewhat long window but stars these days are dictating where they want to go and if Boston doesn‚Äôt improve in the next few years I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if jaylen brown decides he wants to go somewhere else in two years if the Celtics don‚Äôt advance far enough. Do the Celtics want to waste another year of brown and Tatum because that‚Äôs what they will likely do if they bring this same roster back next year. I am not saying trade jaylen brown or jayson Tatum but get some vets to surround these guys with. If they need to trade a first to get a solid vet they should go for that move"
"Damn, I‚Äôm a huge SGA defender on this sub, but this is just out of pocket lol  How can you put him over Curry, KD, Giannis, Kawhi, Dame, Luka, Zion, Beal, Kyrie, Harden, I can just go on... lol  He‚Äôs a better scorer than Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, and arguably Booker and Tatum too"
Bridges just erased jaylen brown there
think Jaylen Brown is pretty clearly more of a threat than Bogdanovic
"This is what a clown take looks like "" Kemba Walker, Jaylen Brown, and Marcus Smart aren't threats like Bogdanovic and Gobert are. "" like huh wtf u even talking about."
"Embiid is good, but the players you have around him in that scenario aren't as good as the Jazz. I just think Luka would feast, although I feel he'd kinda overlap with Mitchell. Luka would probably play the point in that scenario, though.  Each player on that Jazz team is a threat. Kemba Walker, Jaylen Brown, and Marcus Smart aren't threats like Bogdanovic and Gobert are. Gobert's defense alone can win the Jazz games.  Utah is also just far too deep. Evan Fournier doesn't come close to Jordan Clarkson, in my opinion. Clarkson just fits that system they've got going on perfectly."
"Celtics depth is fine now (especially if we running an 8 man like the playoffs with Embiid)  Kemba Walker  Marcus Smart  Jaylen Brown  Jayson Tatum  Joel Embiid  Evan Fournier  Robert Williams III  Tristan Thompson  That‚Äôs 5 people averaging 20 with one averaging 30, another averaging 25, and another also averaging 25"
"Yep, and also i just wanna say homerism aside. Its unrealistic to hope for a development like Tatum has had. He is a superstar, and will be a perennial top 5 player.   If RJ can just follow Brown‚Äôs development(shot creation and tighter handles), we will be 100% satisfied considering RJs already high upside on defense. I always say, the ability to create their own looks and make shots is what makes or break a superstar. The top 10 lists are all people who can create on their own (aside from already good skillsets, of course).  Jaylen Brown came into the league looking nowhere like a 25PPG scorer. Yet here we are. Although he‚Äôs only shooting 25-30% of his shots off the dribble and on ISOs (saw in a post) its still a massive improvement from what we saw his early days.  RJ still cannot reliably create space or pull up, so i hope he gets there"
Jaylen Brown has the best efficiency on the Celtics. RJ has a 53% ts this year. I‚Äôm not quite sure why op is choosing to get rid of the beginning of the season
"let's be real, swap RJ for Jaylen Brown and RJ averages &gt;22 points. Any player that is even SOMEWHAT competent on offense could easily average 22 on a team as iffy as the Celtics"
"I feel like Tatum upside on offense for RJ is quite unrealistic, possible but not likely.   However, a Jaylen Brown type of offense is definitely possible, and considering his upside on defense thats all-NBA caliber in his prime.  Its just that Tatum definitely came into the league already with some semblance of an offensive arsenal, and whereas JB started with 0 similar to where RJ is now. (0 is hyperbole)  This isn‚Äôt even a slight against RJ. Tatum looks like Kobe with his handle and offensive moves, its just incredible. Tatum will be a top 5 player in his prime.  Again, we‚Äôll be completely satisfied if he turns into a Jaylen Brown 25/6/3 type of player with all-defensive selections. Jaylens improvement on handling and shot creation should be something RJ must emulate."
"Usage doesn‚Äôt mean anything. Usage is literally the percentage of plays per game a player is involved in, it‚Äôs an irrelevant statistic.   That‚Äôs because Tatum was the first option offensively. I don‚Äôt think he will stop improving. I think he‚Äôll be a great player and I‚Äôm really impressed by his year. He‚Äôs made a leap, but I think what went into Tatum and Brown‚Äôs expectations was how well they performed in the post-season.  Also, prior to last year, many people didn‚Äôt think Jaylen Brown would be as good as he is, and I don‚Äôt think anyone predicted he‚Äôd be an all-star. He‚Äôs made huge leaps every year too.  RJ absolutely has star potential. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs there yet though, but people didn‚Äôt think the same about Brown. Tatum had a somewhat forced narrative, but he definitely filled those shoes, and some."
"I am not a Hawks fan but I really believe in Cam Reddish. He will put it together and be an great role player as his floor. Some of his best moments are show how insane his natural skill level is and he is super long, super tall. I think he has grown in height and strength a lot since draft combine. He looks massive compared to other wings to me. Floor of Trevor Ariza, ceiling of someone like current Jaylen Brown as an absolute reach if everything comes together for him."
"Player A is SGA   Player B is D-Mitch  Player C is Booker   Player D is Jaylen Brown   Booker, Mitch, Brown, SGA."
Player D is Jaylen Brown.
"PG: Luka Doncic SG: Jaylen Brown, SF:  Jayson Tatum, PF: Ben Simmons, C: Jokic  Not only do I have scoring, defense, length and multiple ball handlers mixed through out this line up, I have longevity.   Picking guys like Steph, Lebron, Kawhi and KD would be better.....for a couple years. All of them are in their 30s and have a lot of mileage. KD, Kawhi and Lebron are getting hurt more than they ever have recently which shows they are slowing down. My line up is tearing up the league for a decade+."
Jaylen Brown 18.6/6/1.7 splits and subpar-average defense  Beal 24/4.1/3.4/1.5 splits 55.2 TS %
"I‚Äôm not mad about Randle, but Jaylen Brown"
"Jaylen Brown, mostly because he's a hometown kid"
I like Jaylen Brown too but I think i like Tatum a little bit more
"Jaylen Brown, Boston Celtics"
Jaylen Brown
Michael Jordan and Jaylen Brown is my favorite
Jaylen Brown
Tie between Jaylen Brown and DA Hunter
"My favorite is from the 2017 finals there was a play where Lebron slipped when he was late to rotate and KD dunked it, and the title was ‚ÄúKD banishes LeBron to the shadow realm‚Äù and it had like 15k upvotes. I also remember a Jaylen Brown dunk on LeBron which was called a ‚Äúmurder‚Äù but it was a good dunk but nothing like a highlight of the year play."
"Jaylen Brown, probably."
wut the Celtics didn't have Jaylen Brown and their starting center got hurt mid game. Westbrook routinely plays bad in the playoffs. doesn't matter who the matchup is
"Nets blow out every game by 50+ unless Tatum averages 50 himself. We are already lucky that Jaylen Brown, the worst defender in the league, isn't playing because otherwise, we'd lose by 70."
Hopefully Jaylen Brown. Biggest black hole in the league.
And all because Terry Rozier and Marcus Smart didn't want to pass to Jaylen Brown...
"Lol this series will not be competitive in any way, that is not good TV. If Jaylen Brown was playing then yeah itd be KINDA interesting. You guys are gonna get your ass torn apart. And your fanbase will probably bitch the entire series. Well see how fun it is for then."
[What about Jaylen Brown](https://i.imgur.com/mlgnO3q.png)
"It's weird he randomly mentions Jaylen Brown out of all the players, too. I don't even watch Celtics games but know that Jaylen isn't the primary ballhandler and is likely the third option when a fully healthy Kemba and Tatum are out there. Just really weird he decided to mention Jaylen."
"Why do you randomly bring up Jaylen Brown who clearly had to share the ball with some ball dominant players like Kyrie, Tatum, Kemba, and then you add in Smart, etc.,? Jaylen is a scorer/defender. That's his bread-and-butter. Cavs drafted Sexton under the assumption that he could be their next playmaker. Jaylen has improved his game every year in the league. Sexton is practically the same player he was when he came into the league."
"Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown. Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Terry Rozier. Sounds like a pretty solid team to me. Except it wasn't, and we know exactly why, because only one of those guys is still a shitty teammate. And it just so happens he was supposed to be the one that held it all together."
Isnt Jaylen Brown considered a mediocre defender now?
Sexton hate is overrated. He's averaged more assists than Jaylen Brown every year since he came into the league.  Actually:  Jaylen Brown -&gt; 5 seasons -&gt; 591 total assists  Collin Sexton -&gt; 3 seasons -&gt; 697 total assists
Most guys on the rookie extension typically it‚Äôs a bit of a hope they develop to be worth it. Jaylen brown is one example same with Jamal Murray. Some guys do end up being worth it and some don‚Äôt
"I agree with both of you. Like you said, it really depends on how were defining mediocre.  Warning: I'm putting my homer glasses on. Over the past ~12 years, the Celtics have been pretty consistently good aside from a couple years in there. Despite ""only"" one ring, the Big 3 Celtics were title contenders for about 5 years there, and we've made the ECSF or ECF every year since drafting Jaylen Brown in 2016. In general, it's been a pleasure to be a fan of those teams.  Mediocre is when you're a 7-10 seed year after year, with no actual shot of winning, no potential superstar, no asset that can become a superstar, and no real hope. Raps haven't actually been mediocre for 6+ years, which feels like a lifetime in sports fandom. No offense, but I agree the Pistons have been a prime example of mediocre for what feels like a decade. Some of the Drummond years were interesting, but it's been bleak for awhile. Knicks and Hornets were the same way until just this year."
‚Äúfantastic complimentary piece‚Äùs shouldn‚Äôt be getting $100M just because teams aren‚Äôt getting better guys. you know who got one of those extensions recently? Jaylen Brown - and Allen hasn‚Äôt shown to be even half the player Jaylen was even before this year
"I was so confused reading. I was like Kyrie and Bruce Brown got injured, since when. You meant Jaylen Brown. Lol"
"I was so confused reading. I was like Kyrie and Bruce Brown got injured, since when. You meant Jaylen Brown. Lol"
I‚Äôd still trade back for Jalen green.  Dudes being slept on so hard and I don‚Äôt get it. His floor is jaylen brown.

"Have you seen the Celtics play defense this year? It's still going to be a sweep. If Tatum can steal a single game it will be an incredible accomplishment.   The Nets could not possibly be a worse matchup for the Celtics this year. Celtics are bottom third in almost every defensive metric, Brooklyn is like top 3 in everything offensively. Especially the perimeter situation, this isn't going to be pretty. We have lost big to 3 different iterations of the Nets this year, including one pre-Harden trade, and we will be without Jaylen Brown.   The Celtics have no chance."
Jaylen Brown
"Yeah but a few of those guys had a monster game before.   If Jaylen and Terry had more help in G6 there wouldn't have been a G7.   Brown had 27. Terry had 28. Smart had 10 points, 8 assists on 57% shooting."
If you actually think the Harden trade didn't go down because of Maxey you're definitely one of those people who thinks Jaylen Brown is a genius for saying that basketball only exists to distract the masses.
"Why didn't they just lose to Washington, beat Indiana and then play Philly in the First Round ?? You don't have Jaylen Brown why would you want to play Brooklyn in the first Round for ??"
"When Kyrie hugged it out with Jaylen Brown this season, I stopped caring about the ‚Äúbeef‚Äù. I wanted KD, Russ, and Harden on the court again in the playoffs."
Sometimes someone's energy just don't jive with ya that's all. I hate the Celtics but I still love me some Marcus smart and Jaylen Brown. For some reason I just don't feel that with Tatum. A certain je ne sais quois no?
He looked like jaylen brown on the court
Jayson ‚ÄúJaylen ‚ÄòJaylen ‚ÄòMichael ‚ÄòGod‚Äô Jordan‚Äô Brown‚Äô Brown‚Äù Tatum
"Genuine Question:  Why would the Celtics want to win this? Why not just lose to Washington, beat Indiana and then play Philly in the first round which is an easier matchup? Why would you wanna play Brooklyn in Round 1 without Jaylen Brown ?"
fuck man. imagine if jaylen wasn't injured. this was definitely our year with brown making the all star team and tatum taking a step to the next level
Jaylen brown was also invisible
U really must have a problem trolling or hating on jaylen brown this much
Jayson ‚ÄúJaylen ‚ÄòMichael ‚ÄòGod‚Äô Jordan‚Äô Brown‚Äù Tatum  Edit: What the fuck did I just type
"We are so much better when Jaylen is holding Jayson Tatum back. Boston needs to trade away Brown for a better #2 option, especially when his value is at its highest."
He plays so much better without Jaylen Brown holding him back.
i‚Äôm really bummed out that Jaylen Brown got injured. i wish the Knicks could face the sorry ass Celtics round one üò≠
"Wizards are TRASH, losing to Boston with no Jaylen Brown?!?!"
Jaylen Brown is shaking in disbelief that the Celts are winning without him lol
Jaylen Brown absolutely quaking in fear on the bench
Don't forget Jaylen Brown almost walking away from basketball so he could focus on hosting symposiums and encouraging dialogue.
Does Jaylen Brown have a Blue's Clues bandaid on his face?
Jaylen Brown looking like a cartoon character LMFAO
Yeah. It‚Äôs like Jaylen brown isn‚Äôt even out there
Jaylen Brown
"For no particular reason I think a ""duo"" of a pass first veteran point guard, Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, and Robert Williams would be awesome HAHAHAHA jk but what if?"
Missing Jaylen Brown and maybe Rob Williams also
I don't think Celtics have a real chance without Jaylen Brown
Wizards for both. The Celtics really look like they are about to mail it in and without jaylen brown I think the wizards are just better
ANT IS BETTER THAN JAYLEN BROWN
Is Jaylen Brown coming back?
Boston has been bad without Jaylen Brown. To me he has shown he is more valuable than Tatum.
Celtics are 2-5 since Jaylen Brown got injured. I don‚Äôt think they will be too much trouble for the Wizards
"I like the Celtics too but they don't have jaylen brown this season anyway, let Westbrook go battle against Brooklyn. They won't stand a chance but the Westbrook vs Durant and harden too good to pass up"
"Yeah, even as the biggest Jaylen fan, I agree with you.  And it‚Äôs not even disrespect to Jaylen, ben simmons is really good at basketball.  He‚Äôs an elite defender with well above average playmaking skills and despite not being able to shoot he still scores a decent amount on above average efficiency.  Ben simmons is awesome, and so is Jaylen brown.  To say simmons is better than brown is debatable at best.  And again that‚Äôs not an insult to brown in the slightest.  The amount of simmons disrespect on this subreddit is crazy.  Giannis just won back to back MVPs without a great jump shot, and Russ won MVP and he would probably be better off not shooting the ball lol."
Jaylen Brown is easily better than Simmons and it isn't particularly close either
"Not really. Good players are just concentrated on contenders because of salary limitations individually. You could have 30 stars lead every team if spread out nicely.  1. Jokic 2. Giannis 3. Curry 4. Luka 5. Lebron 6. Dame 7. Butler 8. Kawhi 9. Randle 10. Zion 11. Embiid 12. CP3 13. Harden 14. Kyrie 15. KD 16. Westbrook 17. Tatum 18. Young 19. AD 20. Beal 21. KAT 22. PG 23. Mitchell 24. Simmons 25. Ingram 26. BAM 27. SGA 28. Morant 29. Siakam 30. Booker  You still have guys like McCollum, Klay, Gobert, Sabonis, Lavine, Derozan, Tobias Harris, Jrue Holiday, Jaylen Brown, Vucevic, Middleton, Draymond, Murray, Gordon, Kemba Walker, D'lo, Hayward to pair up with any guys above to balanced out really strong individuals like Lebron/Giannis/Curry/KD"
I don‚Äôt want to be rude but jaylen brown is a better player than Ben Simmons.
"Eh, the supporting cast wasn‚Äôt much better last year. The thing was we had Kemba, Hayward, Tatum, and Brown - four star talents who were capable of putting up 25+ on any night.   This year it‚Äôs just Kemba, Tatum, and Brown, and even before Jaylen went out for the season they were often missing one or two of those guys most nights. Combine that with the fact that Kemba and Tatum both went through significant slumps while they came back from a serious injury/Covid, it makes the lack of depth feel much more impactful."
"This is awesome.     Those early season boston threads are amazing lol ""I wouldn't trade jaylen brown straight up for harden"" just endless gold to be found in there"
&gt;Also the east 7-8 has pretty solid star power and large markets with the same possibility  Jaylen Brown is out and Beal might be headed that way too.  If the Hornets beat the 7/8 loser they might actually have a better series.
Without Jaylen Brown??
Really hope we get the chance to kick your ass first round.   Can already hear the WAHHH NO JAYLEN BROWN... like we had Ben last year lol
"I agree, but Shai hesi drives don't define our season. If we look back on this year we'll remember tanking, developing guys, plumbing the depths of our g league roster for hidden gems. So it makes sense for 'season defining shot' to be a Jaylen Hoard brick, or Moses Brown putback. I'd submit Poku's missed dunk/murder attempt as a pretty good encapsulation of our season. Lots of potential and a long way to go. https://streamable.com/2cz734"
"**Most games as top scorer - best on team**  1. Stephen Curry - 52 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo - 50 3. Luka Doncic - 49  **Most games as top scorer - second best on team**  1.

Andre Drummond, Khris Middleton - 8  **Fewest games as top scorer - third best on team**  1. Rui Hachimura - 3 2. Carmelo Anthony, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Orlando Magic - 4"
I mean yeah if we look at old threads from a year ago everything would look bad. It‚Äôs just how it works. The Jaylen brown thing aged like milk but at the time he didn‚Äôt look like he deserved it.
"By that logic, the Celtics should have never wasted a top 3 pick on Jaylen Brown because he didn‚Äôt look like a star in his rookie season."
"Celtics are a dead team walking. Guys have packed it in already. No Jaylen Brown, it‚Äôs gonna be all on Tatum to carry them through. That team is fading hard. Wiz are on a tear. They got this."
"What does it matter that it‚Äôs a single game? Celtics are a dead team walking. Guys have packed it in already. No Jaylen Brown, it‚Äôs gonna be all on Tatum to carry them through. The team is fading hard. Wiz on a tear, will have 2 of the 3 best players on the court Tuesday.   As for the Hornets, the Wiz just beat them with Beal playing on one leg and a horrible shooting night from their big 2."
I'd trade Jaylen Brown for Cole Anthony straight up.
He was the same player. You were probably too busy making excuses for Brad Stevens and Jaylen Brown to notice.
He's already better than Jaylen Brown.
I mean you guys went on and on about how you beat us without Kemba/Smart/Timelord with our point guards being either Teague or Jaylen Brown so
Watch how fvv locked up jaylen brown last year in the playoffs
"What's the best draft class currently in the NBA? 2003 always good until Lebron retires - ridiculous (Melo not doing anything noteworthy anymore).  Only Howard left from 2004 and CP3 from 2005.   2006 - Reddick, Rondo, LMA, Lowry, Gay  2007 - Durant, Horford, Conley, Thad Young, Gasol  2008 - Rose, Westbrook, Love, Lopezes, Dragic, Batum, Hill, Ibaka (starting to see more players around, only going to list stars and very good starters now)  2009 - Harden, Curry, Derozan,  JRue, Danny Green, Mills  2010 - Hayward, PG (rest are low level starts, pretty weak draft)  2011- Kyrie, Tobias, Marcus Morris, Kawhi, Vuvecic, Corey Joseph, Jimmy Buckets,   2012 - AD, Beal, Lillard, Barnes, Terrence Ross, (does Drummond count as a good starter?), Fournier, Middleton, Barton  2013 - Oladipo, KCP, McCollum, Adams, Giannis, Schroeder, Hardaway  2014 - See OP  2015 - KAT, DLo, Turner, Oubre, Booker, Rozier, Norman Powell  2016 - Simmons, Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Murray, Hield, Sabonis, Beasley, Levert, Siakam, Brogdon, (Surprisingly strong year)  All the rest are too early to judge.  Talent is really spread out by age right now.  I'd say 2009 or 2012 or 2014 are the best left maybe?  Hard to judge  2003 still going to get that title though, haha."
"For the last 5 years Definitely remembered: LeBron, Curry, Giannis, Durant, Klay, Davis, Lillard, Harden, Russ, CP3, Embiid, Kyrie, Wade, Kobe  Likely remembered: Jokic, Tatum, Korver, Griffin, Derrick Rose, Donovan Mitchell  Potentially forgotten: Jimmy Butler, Kemba, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Bradley Beal, Al Horford, Devin Booker  Likely forgotten: Lowry, Aldridge, Millsap, Kevin Love, Marc Gasol, Bosh, DeMar DeRozan, John Wall, Ben Simmons, Mike Conley, Rudy Gobert"
"He‚Äôs not better than Kyrie, Harden, Beal, Jaylen Brown, LaVine, or Simmons in the East.  I would also put Trae Young and Jrue Holiday up there. He‚Äôs a very solid player though, guard position is just incredibly stacked."
"Yeah I mean it's always frustrating I just think you can come up with a narrative however you spin it.  If Zach missed the first ten games we could say ""well they got into a hole and the team got discouraged, couldn't build the momentum they would have had if the team started healthy"".  You look at the other teams bulls would be competing with and they all got shot in the leg too.  Indiana lost Warren for the season, Turner has missed more games than Zach and LeVert had a fuckin tumor lol.  Washington lost their starting C and Beal missed the same amount of games as Zach.  Toronto doesn't have a single player who played more games than Zach.  Jaylen Brown is out for the season and Kemba missed like 30 games.  If Orlando didn't lose Isaac they may not have even blown up the team and traded Vucevic.  Bulls had other injuries as well but nothing super significant imo, at least comparatively.  I just don't think the original ""well if we were healthy all year we'd be in the playoffs"" during a global pandemic is a useful comment lol."
"Only answer is OKC. They already have an all nba guard in the making in SGA. If they continue to develop to their potential you can picture a pretty good team just based on the prospects on the roster already. They literally had to bench all of their good players so they could lose and land another top pick. This team could‚Äôve easily been in the play in if they tried.  Dort - elite defender, has continued to refine his scoring and shooting. I don‚Äôt know if all star is in future but I can see developing similar to how Jaylen Brown came into the league and developed to what he is today.  Poku - wide range of outcomes for him but his ceiling could even be higher than Dort‚Äôs  Bazley - athletic wing, if he can get his shot down he can be a killer small ball 4.   Also additional guys like Jerome, Maledon and Moses Brown are solid role players.  Not even to mention the best part, they could potentially have 2 top 5 picks in this draft. Oh and tbh own all of the entire clippers future plus many additional picks.   When horford is traded they‚Äôll have basically of their cap space. Not that it means they‚Äôll get big free agents to come to play in OKC but they can round out their roster with smart signings or use it to take on additional bad contracts to get picks."
Miami and Philly is a second round matchup I really want to see. Suns and Blazers would be a good series too. I would‚Äôve liked Celtics and Sixers before the Jaylen Brown injury though.
"His main competition were Grant, Wood, Jaylen Brown.   I think only Brown could make a semi case against him. It‚Äôs üîí."
"I hate less than time stats because players like Doncic, Sabonis, and others have recorded that line in around 30 minutes. The less than time stat is misleading because it‚Äôs not the fastest time to get that stat line, just least amount of minutes they played in the game. It‚Äôs similar to Jaylen Brown earlier this year most points all time under 20 minutes"
"r/nba stay sleeping on Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Ingram and MPJ and Jamal Murray and Simmons, all of these guys are also under 25"
1-5 JAYLEN BROWN
"Jaylen Brown, the next Micheal Jordan"
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum gunning for that spot lol (sorry my biased shamrock colored glasses got the best of me there)
"That‚Äôs fine. They were 3-1 against the Wizards and all 3 wins didn‚Äôt have Jaylen Brown, including a blowout in the play in."
Nope. But the Celtics beat the Wizards 3x without Jaylen Brown. Nice try though.
"Jrue still gets cooked by Luka when they play, the only person I've seen not get cooked by Luka 1v1 is Simmons. Jaylen brown also does a decent job but not as good as ben."
This is exactly why i wanted my celtics to  play the nets in the first round.. atleast i did before Jaylen brown was out for the season.
"Well I‚Äôm arguing with a 76ers fan and a Nets fan so this will probably fall on deaf ears but I‚Äôll make an attempt. We‚Äôve learned absolutely nothing about the Celtics this season other than Jaylen Brown can carry a larger offensive load. The Celtics missed the most days do to covid and they missed about 40 more days than the next closest team. This coupled with Smart being out for half the season, and Kemba not playing b2bs in a condensed season. So I don‚Äôt think you can really tell much about them one way or another. The season record isn‚Äôt representative of the quality of the team this year.  We would have been able to test that in the playoffs if Brown wasn‚Äôt out. They could be just as good as they have been in the past or this may be a real result, but there‚Äôs been enough variance do to injuries and covid that I don‚Äôt think you can accurately judge them. Honestly as a C‚Äôs that‚Äôs worse than being bad because you know you are bad and can make trades. We just don‚Äôt know"
Oddly enough the lakers Twitter tonight (maybe because we won) was so nice and sweet going all Jaylen Hands to Moses brown to KCP   Character development haha
"&gt;Plus he just made the fans triple down on it. His mind is truly operating at another level.  He's always in his head, but the Nets are too OP and without Jaylen Brown the Celtics don't have a prayer. Kyrie could shoot 6/23 for 19 points and still get carried to a 10pt victory.  Sucks that it is the way it is."
Wait so what happened to jaylen brown? Is he hurt?
The Nets only look like a cheat code cause Boston is terrible and missing Jaylen Brown.   Let‚Äôs calm down until the next round when they play the Bucks.
Doubt the Celtics have a shot with jaylen brown out
Celtics are missing one of their wings (Jaylen Brown). Clippers don't have such an excuse.
Nitpick but Jaylen brown is 6‚Äô6 and Tatum is 6‚Äô8. Mj is 6‚Äô6 Scottie is 6‚Äô8.
Are we sure Hardaway and Jaylen Brown aren‚Äôt long lost brothers?
Doesn‚Äôt Jaylen Brown regularly sage too?
The only thing missing is that smug ass Jaylen Brown isn't on the court with his scrub ass team as they get swept. Hey Celts we'll spot ya another 5 draft picks maybe you can do something with it this time and be decent contenders by 2030 lmao
Yeah what? Even with Jaylen Brown they're not really a part of the conversation
Wow you finally decided to blame someone other than Jaylen Brown.
Are you really asking KD how the Nets turned it on defensively the last two games? Maybe it has a little bit to do with fact they're one of the most stacked teams of all time playing a low seed celtics with no Jaylen Brown OR Tatum. Idiotic.
Their defense still might get exposed against a decent team. This series really isn‚Äôt a challenge for them especially without Jaylen Brown.
"He has too long of a contract, but Jaylen Brown will want out in just 2 short years. And I wonder how Ainge will spin it to not take the blame."
Jaylen Brown
I love Jaylen Brown and would hate to see him go.. but the Celtics front office  have put themselves in a spot where I see that‚Äôs the only option..
"I said it before the play in games: Boston would have been better off just losing both of those games and getting a lottery pick. They already have a bunch of playoff experience, so just getting into these games wasn't gonna pay any dividends down the line, and there's nothing to be gained by getting obliterated by the Nets. Kudos to them for not tanking, but this whole thing is pretty pointless for them. Once Jaylen Brown got hurt their season was effectively over."
"This is the new ""Jaylen Brown for AD"" like it was straight up lol the nephews around here"
the celtics should be allowed to get larry bird to replace jaylen brown to make this more competitive
Would Jaylen Brown even make a difference in this series? Maybe they would make one of the losses close with him I guess
Yea but if the Celtics had Jaylen Brown they‚Äôd probably only be down 15.
"Imagine almost 8 years later the Celtics still haven't built a championship contender AND they passed on Harden because Jaylen Brown is just ""too valuable"". Give me a break.  If you're a Celtics fan and aren't pissed at Ainge you gotta give your head a shake."
Can‚Äôt even imagine how much Jaylen Brown must be burning on the inside to play this series
nahh Jaylen Brown aint doing shit about this lmao
"Celtics need to trade Jaylen Brown  Tatum and Jaylen wont be able to win together, they both too similar of players."
i wish jaylen brown was playing
"Jaylen Brown got like 23 per year, didn't he? I feel like there's no way Sexton gets more than Brown"
Guy hates jaylen brown more than New York fans hate trae young. Guy is always talking shit for no reason
If Jaylen Brown was playing Boston would have lost by 50 every game. I hope people stop talking about him as some X-factor when in fact Boston plays better without him. He is the worst defender in the league for a reason.
Kenny stop mentioning Jaylen Brown you're making me depressed :(
People have been slandering the heat since before dragic tried to injure jrue.  Tyler herro slander is probably behind maybe Simmons slander and jaylen brown slander in terms of best players to slander on this sub.
"You've overestimating Jaylen Brown man, he's not even as good as JT /s"
This an accute observation and it's great. But Jaylen Brown goes more in the last cagetory (initials) JB rather than just Jaylen. He is also referred to as Brown.
"We will get Jaylen Brown, you take KP"
Jaylen brown would be valuable to every team lol.  High level 3&amp;D guards with good size down grow on trees. Bonus points for any ball handling skills.
"Kawhi had a big part in that. It allowed Siakam to be the second/third option, and he‚Äôs kind of proven the last couple of years that he gets exposed when he‚Äôs the primary focus. He‚Äôs a lot like Jaylen Brown where he‚Äôs not good enough to be a #1 option because he‚Äôll get closed in on but when you have a superstar next to him it frees him up and allows him to be very efficient. Lowry and Gasol have just had very long, great careers. That Raptors team had a great foundation where they were in the Semi-Finals/Conference Finals nearly every year, Kawhi just put them over the top because DeRozan isn‚Äôt that guy and trading for Gasol at the deadline was a great move. I give their FO a lot of credit for building that team when they knew they had a real chance to win"
"Probably not, they think very highly of Jaylen Brown."
"People were crowning him the next Klay Thompson/Devin Booker after the bubble.   Speaking of Rockets fans, a good portion liked the idea of Herro on a rookie deal which we would be able to extend over Ben Simmons, who was already making 30+M in a Harden trade. I was pretty close into buying into the hype (Jaylen Brown was the player I wanted the most).   Herro can still be a great player but it seems like he‚Äôs been pretty up and down this year. The next 2-3 years are going to be telling for his career. Will he be a top5-10 SG or just a nice player than is maybe the 3rd best guy on a competitive team."
"Pritchard at 27 isn‚Äôt anything overly special. He is an Ok player, looks like he could potentially get 2nd team All-Rookie. Like that‚Äôs solid, but for a 23 year old rookie it isn‚Äôt like he is considered a huge steal. Quickly was picked right in front of him and looks better, and there were multiple guards after him that could easily carve out a better career.   Brown at 3 was considered a reach at the time, and that was a great move. Angie trading down from the 1 pick to get Tatum and another lotto pick was big too.   However considering how many picks Boston has had the last few years and how many misses they had, it‚Äôs concerning.   Great/Solid picks - Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard    Picks that were nothing;  James Young - 2014 17th pick  RJ Hunter - 2015 28th pick  Jordan Mickey - 2015 33rd pick  Marcus Thornton - 2015 45th pick  Guerschon Yabusele - 2016 16th pick  Ante Zizic - 2016 23rd pick  Demetrius Jackson - 2016 45th pick   Ben Bentil - 2016 51st pick  Abdel Nader - 2016 58th pick  Semi Ojeleye - 2017 37th pick  Kadeem Allen - 2017 53rd pick  Jabari Bird - 2017 56th pick  Romeo Langford - 2019 14th pick  Grant Williams - 2019 22nd pick  Carsen Edwards - 2019 33rd pick  Tremont Waters - 2019 51st pick  Aaron Neismith - 2020 14th pick   Yam Madar - 2020 47th pick    So there is 18 players that didn‚Äôt pan out since 2014 (granted some were bad picks but still a lot hit rate) and only 3 non lotto picks really panned out (with the Jury still being out of Pritchard). Not to mention they let Rozier walk for nothing."
"The problem is that Jaylen Brown has the tools to be a great player but he has an extremely low basketball IQ.   He's one of the worst defenders in the league even when his on-ball defense is okay because he gets lost on screens and backdoor cuts on every possession. A traffic cone is legitimately a better defender than Jaylen Brown.   He's also the biggest black hole on offense. When the ball enters his hands, it's either a missed shot or a turnover. He can only score because he's elite in transition and taking wide-open shots generated by Tatum or Kemba.  I'd trade Jaylen for just about anything at this point. He's a negative player on the court and I also believe he was one of the few reasons why Kyrie left Boston. I'd hate to see him drive Tatum out of town."
"Jaylen Brown, Kawhi, Giannis"
Jaylen brown &gt; butler
"i mean how can you leave out the race stuff? basically calling for a cop's head who just saved a life and did their job as we currently ask of them, as arguably the most famous athlete on the planet, and then saying that bullshit non-apology when getting called out for it? in addition to saying ""we"" (as in roughly 34 million individual black americans) ""can't even go for a jog without being killed."" like, this shit is a huge part of the problem. claiming that the moment they walk out the door, regardless of class, geography, any context, every single black american should be scared of being murdered. it's just fucking sad how dumb and un-informed, yet arrogant, so many of these athletes are. i wish ppl of Kobe's intelligence (and others like Jaylen Brown and Kareem) weren't so fucking rare."
Jaylen Brown was a top 25 player this year idk wtf you‚Äôre talking about
"Right, and I totally get that the guys missing for Atlanta arent nothing but there‚Äôs also consideration for the idea that you have to expect a certain level of injury over the course of a season you‚Äôre never gonna have your full rotation go the full 82. Comparing their game log to Miami‚Äôs, Indy‚Äôs, or Boston‚Äôs (or even Brooklyn‚Äôs or Philly‚Äôs) you have Jaylen Brown, Kemba, Marcus Smart, Jimmy, Kendrick Nunn, Goran Dragic, Myles Turner, Malcolm Brogdon, Kyrie, KD, and Joel Embiid all miss  20% of the season (15 games) or more. That‚Äôs a lot of important guys from the East‚Äôs playoff picture and that‚Äôs not even mentioning what‚Äôs gonna happen next year when Toronto retools because that‚Äôs gonna be another set of stubborn motherfuckers if they don‚Äôt tear it down (which they 100% shouldn‚Äôt they have Nurse, FVV, and Siakam)  Props to McMillan and I think he‚Äôs earned an extension in Atlanta, I just don‚Äôt wanna see this team rest on their laurels by saying ‚Äúhey, we broke in to the 5 seed‚Äù because when you put it into context against the rest of the East it‚Äôs a pretty tight arms race up for the end of the ‚Äúcontending in the East‚Äù tier"
Did Jaylen Brown fuck your mom?
I'd trade Jaylen Brown and a decade's worth of first round picks and swaps for him. He'd be an amazing fit next to Tatum instead of a black hole.
"Pretty sure [this](https://youtu.be/rHc8-fTxJ4M) is where he first came up with that line. Watch 2:35 in this video. Pretty cool move by Jaylen Brown, leaving Thybulle in the dark."
Offensively Jaylen Brown statistically had an almost identical post season 2018 as Jayson Tatum. And Al Horford statistically had a superior post season 2018 than both of them. So ‚Äúlead‚Äù is a reach.
I could name about 22 guys fairly easily. Once you get to like Donovan Mitchell and jaylen brown it‚Äôs a toss up.
"I thinks empty and inflated are synonymous, one just sounds a bit more harsh. At the end of the day dude is scoring at a rate comparable to guys like Jaylen Brown, Julius Randle Paul George. He‚Äôs not an all star caliber player though, and his PPG misrepresent his actual impact on the game."
"They‚Äôve had a lot of bad games this season, lost Jaylen Brown and they‚Äôre up against the fcking big 3 Nets."
"Not really imo, if Jaylen Brown was healthy this would be a 1-0 lead for Boston.   They are beating the worst team in the playoffs and it looked sorta tough"
?? 2018 Kyrie and Hayward didn‚Äôt play at all at Jaylen Brown wasn‚Äôt all star caliber and 2020 Tatum was unquestionably the leader and best player even if he had an all star candidate
"Kyrie, when he cared, clearly made his teammates better. Kemba just can't do that consistently(he was starting to bring up his Assist #s when Jaylen was the clear #2, then went back to shoot-first mode after Jaylen got shut down). Like Kyrie would have several ""how tf did he even see that open guy"" moments a game. And this team doesn't really need 3 ball-dominant scorers.  With Brown back/healthy, I'd rather see Kemba at 12/9 or something, rather than his career of 20/5."
Knicks - Randle  Nets- Jarret Allen  Raptors- Bosh  Celtics- Jaylen Brown  76ers- Iverson  Pacers- Danny Granger  Bulls- MJ  Pistons- Billups  Cavaliers- Kyrie Irving  Bucks- Ray Allen  Heat- Jimmy Butler  Magic- T Mac  Hawks- Dominique Wilkins  Hornets- Baron Davis  Wizards- Beal  Spurs- Derozan  Mavs- Luka  Rockets- Hakeem  Pelicans- AD  Grizzlies- Ja Morant  Suns- Booker  Lakers- Kobe   Warriors- Steph  Kings- Jason Williams  Clippers- Blake Griffin   Nuggets- Carmelo Anthony  Blazers- Dame   Twolves- KG  Jazz- Deron Willians  Thunder (or Sonics)- Westbrook
"Very true for the Celtics.  **Jayson Tatum** got COVID in January and needed an inhaler during games afterward. He didn't appear fully recovered until late March.  **Robert Williams** only played 52 games, missing time with various injuries, including a knee injury that kept him out for a couple of key weeks down the stretch in April.  **Jaylen Brown** tore a ligament in his wrist in early May, missing the end of the regular season and the *entire playoffs*.  **Kemba Walker** missed the first month of the season with a knee injury.  **Marcus Smart** missed 1.5 months with a calf injury.  Those are arguably the five most important Celtics. Since late March, when Tatum appeared fully recovered from COVID, the Celtics are 7-2 in games all five of them play. Unfortunately, with JB out for the playoffs, we won't see anything close to a full-strength Celtics team in the playoffs."
Imagine what we would have to give up to get Jaylen brown. We would probably have to trade second overall pick Jabari Parker to get him.
boston needs jaylen brown
Jaylen Brown exists as well but yes
Same here OKC fan but damn I wish Jaylen Brown was healthy. Timelord dominating the paint and Tatum battling KD was awesome.
"It's so wack because with Jaylen I'm 100% confident that Celts are taking the Nets in 6 or 7. I've believed that since mid-season.   Y'all have dogs man, I seriously wish Tatum and Brown were at full capacity because y'all are one of the few teams that can get in the nets' head. I know Tatums doing numbers, but he got injured a little while back, right?"
"That‚Äôs not true though. Jaylen, Horford, and Morris were all incredibly efficient that series especially in comparison. The first two had over 60% ts while Morris had a 77% ts.   Points and attempts for the series: Kyrie: 102 points on 104 attempts Brown: 81 on 58 (21 less points on 46 fewer attempts) Horford: 81 on 63 (21 less on 43 less attempts) Morris: 74 on 40 (28 less on 62 less attempts)  So yeah I think Kyrie should‚Äôve been passing to the more efficient shooters when he was shooting 36 from the field and 22 from 3 rounded up. Morris made 4 more threes than kyrie on 12 less attempts but he wasn‚Äôt being passed the ball and nobody else really was either."
"Yeah but they aren't very beatable, but they need to improve their defense since the Celtics managed to hang with them with a cold Tatum and Kemba and without Jaylen Brown."
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are not the much ballyhooed Nets pick.
"If only we had another all star wing. Someone like Jaylen Brown would be great, and he‚Äôs young enough to fit their timeline too."
I‚Äôm a warrior fan just picked jaylen brown lol
"they really missed Jaylen Brown, his rim attacking and midrange game would‚Äôve really helped Boston on offense. in any case, we‚Äôll def see Rob in the starting 5 from here on out"
Username: jaylen brown Flair: nets bandwagon Comment: we winning the championship ...
I was never a Celtics fan I just picked jaylen brown as my user
Against a .500 Celtics team without Jaylen Brown shooting 37% from the floor  IDK how anyone could watch this game and still Brooklyn are heavy championship favorites
"If Jaylen Brown played this would have been a 50 point blowout, Boston has exceeded expectations."
Would have been way more fun with Jaylen Brown healthy :/
Yea jaylen brown didn‚Äôt even score tonight smh
And everyone saying jaylen brown needed to go. The guy is your other 20 -30 ppg player would make a big difference this game.
I mean the Celtics are missing Jaylen Brown and tatums playing like garbage
Sure it is. Brad and Rondo clashed. Couldn't handle Morris and Rozier. Lost his BFF Hayward's confidence. Soon Jaylen Brown will be asking for a trade.
Anthony Davis and kawhi Leonard. I‚Äôd of much rather had one year of championship contention than the potential of jaylen brown. Franchises are way too worried about potential than winning right now.
No Jaylen brown hurting right now
See here's where the Jaylen Brown theory falls apart: if he was playing and the Celtics were down by 10 in the 4th it would be Hero Ball‚Ñ¢
Jabari has played better defense this game than Jaylen Brown did the whole season.
Imagine thinking you need a healthy Jaylen Brown when you have Jabari Parker.
Jaylen Brown is not walking through that door
Watching all these players play...Jaylen Brown would easily be the worst player on the court.
Have you ever said anything that wasn't about hating Jaylen Brown?
"Boston is literally playing so much better because a certain blackhole isn't playing. Jaylen Brown needs to go, he cannot stay on this team next year."
Wtf is with the Jaylen Brown haters
We‚Äôd be up 60 if we had Jaylen brown
Just look at the box score. If Jaylen Brown was healthy the Celtics would actually win this game.
i still don‚Äôt think the celtics win the series once the nets shake the rust off a bit but jaylen brown would‚Äôve definitely helped balance this thing out
Jaylen Brown 4 years 107mil
jaylen brown
Adding on to the other guy‚Äôs comments about the Jewish controversy with Stephen Jackson &amp; other players:   Jaylen Brown is constantly engaged in social justice work but this sub and most ppl respect him bc he doesn‚Äôt go too extreme with it and he‚Äôs sincere. It‚Äôs not bullshit like Lebron. There‚Äôs no backing out when his money is on the line. There‚Äôs no backing a regime that flattens ppl with tanks and incinerates their remains to hose them down gutters like they were trash and not human beings.   He‚Äôs just a good dude who really seems to want to help his community. Lebron only seems to want to do anything that makes Lebron look better.
"It was a debate for one day between a few dumb fans lol That's like me saying in every Harden or Jaylen Brown thread in existence ""LOL Celtics fans thought Brown was better than Harden"" because some of your fans didn't want to trade Brown for Harden. That's asinine logic."
Jaylen Brown for a non-max/rookie
Dame to the East confirmed. Jaylen Brown and Kemba for Dame FTW.  /s
Jaylen brown
"If you‚Äôre going to rebuild you want pick and young prospects in the hope that you don‚Äôt have to pay them for a little bit. The reason why Tatum, Brown, Ingram, etc. were so coveted was because they were starter/star caliber players on rookie deals which allowed teams to use cap space to build around them (look at how the Celtics were able to get Jaylen Brown and Tatum and still make a run at Horford and Durant and Hayward)  The cap space is just as valuable as the player."
"Man if Murray was playing, Denver would be the team hands down right now. I just don‚Äôt see how anyone could‚Äôve beat them. If Jaylen Brown was healthy against the nets that series would‚Äôve gone to 7. Just sucks that a lot of these series have been lackluster due to injury."
You can thank Jaylen Brown.  [He brought back the booty shorts.](https://www.masslive.com/celtics/2016/11/jaylen_brown_wears_short_short.html)
"Trading Brown for Dame would be going all-in right now, and I think that's just dumb.  Tatum isn't even in his prime yet, and Jaylen can absolutely still be a better player than Dame when he hits his prime.  Perhaps the package isn't there, just saying that's what it would have to look like."
y'all would be okay with letting jaylen brown go?
Jaylen Brown has grown on me the past couple of months
"Depends on what the Blazers are looking for. Full rebuild? Then you're looking at an amount of young players and picks like the PG to LA trade. If they want to try to win next year and see if they can build a complete team then real contenders should look out. Like what would Denver give up? Murray, Porter, and picks? The Nuggets would instantly be the favorites and the Blazers would have a lot of talent. What teams could match salaries, still have draft picks, and have young guys who can be a building block like what OKC got from the Clippers? Nets, Lakers, Bucks, Clippers, and Nuggets don't have the firsts or the young talent for that. Could the Heat do it? It would cost them Bam and Herro and a lot of future picks. What about the Celtics? They've got picks and Jaylen Brown. Not a lot but it's there.    Lillard is a megastar and he wouldn't be cheap at all. Any team is writing off their future and even then the Blazers would have to take dimes for a dollar."
"Yeah Theo is def the closest, just not sure it moves the needle enough for Portland, especially since what they need is not really guard help and Theo's ceiling is probably below all-star caliber.  As for PG/Beal that's definitely more of the direction, but I'd bet that Presti &amp; gang are looking younger for the next round of possibly disgruntled or need a change of scenery type stars. Guys like LaVine, Towns, maybe Siakam or even Jaylen Brown if Boston really looks to shake it up, shoot would've said Booker before this season. Obviously not many of those guys ever become available, but if they're gonna empty the war chest they'll want someone who's closer to 25 than 30 in all likelihood."
Yeah but we are missing another scorer like Jaylen brown.
"Yup he retweeted a post about Dray joining the Blazers lol just after the Warriors lost their play-in game against the Grizzlies  True - Dame/Embiid pairing would be nuts and would keep the Sixers contending for the East for at least 3/4 years.  For the warriors, if they really want to move on from Wiseman.. Jaylen Brown for Wiseman, Wiggins and picks (maybe 2 1's)??"
"longgggg shot but Jaylen Brown for Wiseman, Wiggins and picks"
dame needs to partner with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. that would be lethal
You want Dame you're gonna need to put Jaylen Brown on the table at the very least
"Jaylen Brown for Wiggins, Wiseman, and 2 1‚Äôs"
"Beal is even worse defensively when you consider Wiggins might be our best 1 on 1 defender next year. Beal is most certainly not our guy to me. If we're trading for a wing, a Jaylen Brown or PG type is most attractive. 2 way potential. Personally, I think ""our guy"" should be a coveted Vet PG that shoots, playmakes, can lead a bench and isn't a sieve defensively. I think a stronger bench will lead us to more victories than a better starters group."
Boston didn't have Jaylen Brown...
brad stevens is not trading jaylen brown. kemba on the other hand.
I'm speaking Jaylen Brown into existence
jaylen brown for cj? who says no?
"There needs to be a conversation about resting after this season is over. I think teams should go as far as not allowing their superstars to go play in the olympics. Shouldn't have let players go to the all star break. Its no surprise that the two teams that played the longest are so dramatically worse this year. Tons of superstars are hurt and nether the Lakers or the Miami heat look ANYTHING like they did last year. As much as people whine about resting their players, lets see the same energy when they are \*\*supposed to rest\*\*. The turnaround was way too quick and there will be more injuries of superstars by the end of the playoffs. The Miami heat looked horrible and tired and jimmy butler was a shell. The Lakers looked tired and absent. Seeing Lebron gassed like that was straight depressing. If we want great basketball we gotta give players a break. Jamal Murray getting hurt was the difference between them being legit contenders later in the playoffs and just a strong team. The same with the Celtics man, I went to school in Boston and I love the Celtics and seeing those 3 extra fully rested superstars just beat down on them without J.B.... I couldn't watch it.   Chris Paul is playing hurt hopefully he'll feel much better with the days off   Jaylen Brown is out   Jamal Murray is out   Anthony Davis is out   Also shoutout to my man Cailluo Caruso Ernie Jr getting hurt they missed him out there   Joel Emid is out   TLDR screw the NBA for restarting so soon. 4 major teams just got rocked with injuries that left them with no chance"

"AD/Lebron, half the Heat roster, Murray, and jaylen brown. Signifcant injuries to all the teams that made it to the conference finals."
With Jaylen brown yeah
"CJ is a tough case, he's a good versatile player but looks uncomfortably inconsistent. Emphasized by this first round against Denver.  **Hypothetically speaking** would yall entertain a straight-up trade, CJ for Jaylen Brown?"
"If anyone talks shit on their team, I have no doubt Jaylen Brown will shut that shit down. If him and Tatum are on board, I'm all for it. Anyone else on the team will follow their lead. And when someone outside the org disrespects her, that just gives the team bulletin board material."
I'd give Jaylen Brown &amp; Marcus Smart + 1st rounders for him...
"But the last 2 times you played the Bucks you put up less then 120 &amp; lost both times?  Your not playing against the Celtics without Jaylen Brown, your playing against the best D in the league"
Maybe the issue with kemba is that the Celtics team isn‚Äôt as good as Celtics fans think it is?  Jaylen brown is a chucker with no defense.   Smart is a chucker who plays dirty on defense.  Tatum is probably the most overrated nba player on the planet atm (herro tier).  He puts up solid numbers on that team and attracts a good bit of attention. I can‚Äôt blame him for tatum not knowing how to pass out of a double.
"The Celtics don't really have a whole lot of time to waste, just burning the next two seasons waiting for Kemba's contract to expire. By the time that happens Jaylen Brown will be eligible for an extension, and you don't want him to get to that point after three straight years of the Celtics being shitty. That's the kind of thing that makes players demand a trade.  Boston could just suck it up and pay deep into the luxury tax to bring this same team back next year, but [Boston's ownership is always *extremely* reluctant to pay into the tax,](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/cba/tax/) and they sure won't do it for a .500 team that just got killed in the 1st round. Unfortunately the choice probably is keep Kemba and most likely lose Fournier and probably Smart (either to FA or in a trade this summer), or find a way to dump Kemba and get out from under his toxic contract and then keep those other guys."
"Only if you're a casual fan imo. Golden State had a bunch of very entertaining series where they were challenged, Miami's Big 3 was consistently challenged, if Jaylen Brown had been healthy, we might've been able to make our series vs Brooklyn decently entertaining.   I don't think the Nets should be any form of overwhelming favorite to make it out of the East this year.   The NBA has always had dominant teams, I don't think this era is any worse than any other the way people make it seem. The days of Celtics vs Lakers are some of the most romanticized times in NBA history."
"Yeah people don‚Äôt realize it but Atlanta/GA is one of the hotbeds for basketball talent. Dwight, Jaylen Brown, Lou Will, Collin Sexton, Malcolm Brogdon, Derrick Favors, KCP, WCJ, Jae Crowder all currently in the league...then you have Shareef Abdur-Rahim World B Free, Horace Grant, Josh Smith, just to name a few historically"
My dream offseason acquisition would be Jaylen Brown.
"Paul George, Derrick Rose, Robert Covington, Markell Fultz, Tim Hardaway Jr., DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, TJ McConnell, Russell Westbrook, Jabari Parker, Jaylen Brown, Bryn Forbes, Julius Randle, Kelly Oubre, and many others can't name off the top of my head."
"Miami is defo better, Boston I‚Äôll agree just because Jaylen Brown was injured. Even then they blew out the wizards in the play-in"
Tim Hardaway Jr &amp; Jaylen Brown
Bradley Beal is going to get traded to the Celtics for Kemba Walker and Jaylen Brown. Mark my words.
"If Chris Paul gets a $100 million deal for three years, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a bad price. Think about it this way: you pay him $20 million a year to be a player, $10 million a year to be a coach. The primary issue here is that coaches salaries don‚Äôt get counted against the cap.   That said, if you have cap space and you have a team that needs to develop a rising young core, Chris Paul is the asset you must get.  Chris Paul would look great on the Knicks, the Heat, The Suns, the Timberwolves, The Celtics, and the Bulls.    I can imagine the Suns doing a sign and trade Giving Chris Paul and a first round pick to the Celtics, and receiving Kemba Walker‚Äôs contract and Jaylen Brown in return."
"&gt; they were likely to give up would have included Jaylen Brown. Time will tell if that was the right decision  I really like Brown and think he's underrated, but it's a pretty easy decision imo.  &gt; I doubt Toronto minds declining after they knew kawhi was basically a rental for a ring but it can go either way  Of course. I doubt Ainge would have declined if he knew he'd bring the Cs a ring as well. But the difference is that Masai was willing to take the risk."
"Danny Ainge could have traded Jaylen Brown and some picks for the spot in the draft that doncic was taken (allegedly).  I wish that had happened, as much as I love brown, Doncic and Tatum together would be unstoppable."
"Also these executive surveys/interviews are always disappointing because you get an idea for how out of touch some of them are.  &gt;‚ÄúI think they‚Äôll trade Smart this summer if I had to guess,‚Äù an NBA executive told HoopsHype. ‚ÄúRetool around Tatum and Brown if they can get real value for Smart, but a lot up in the air there.‚Äù   Looking at the leading players assisting the Jays:    Jayson| Jaylen ---|--- Marcus |Marcus  Jaylen|	Jayson Kemba|	Kemba Rob |	Payton Grant |	Rob     Looking at their Offensive Rating with Marcus On/OFF:  Player| Marcus OFF| Marcus ON ---|---|---- Jayson | 112.2| 116.8	 Jaylen| 112.3	| 112.2   Looking at their worst scoring nights:   * With Marcus: Jaylen and/or Jayson had ‚â§5FGM in 4/48 games when Marcus played.   * Without Marcus: Jaylen and/or Jayson had ‚â§5FGM in 10/24 games when Marcus didn't play.  The Jays are 5 times more likely to have a terrible scoring night when Marcus sits.   ***  He's a pass-first PG who leads the charge in getting the Jays involved and their worst scoring nights are often when Smart sits.   He's a big switchable and highly regarded defender which capitalises on the Jay's switchable defensive skills.   He's able to impact the game from a very limited role which gives the Jays more freedom to take over.     If we were to build around the Jays we'd trade **for** Marcus Smart."
"Neither PG or Kawhi are options. I expect the Lakers to sell out their bench and young talent to get a talent like Jaylen Brown, not him specifically but that level of player. If he's available, I could see a Zach Lavine going to the Lakers. Someone like that. Next season is likely Brons last season as a top 3 player in the league, so he's gonna go all out for the ring, full LeGM and LeCoach mode."
"Serious question, you'd take Jaylen Brown over Trae? Maybe I'm just not a fan of JB, but I'm curious what the consensus is between these 2."
no mention of Booker and Jokic only as an honorable mention (on the same level as guys like Jamal Murray and Jaylen Brown???)
"1. Luka Doncic 2. Zion Williamson 3. LaMelo Ball 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jayson Tatum 6. De‚ÄôAaron Fox 7. Ben Simmons 8. Devin Booker 9. Bam Adebayo 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Brandon Ingram 12. Jaylen Brown 13. Jamal Murray 14. Michael Porter Jr. 15. Ja Morant 16. Trae Young  I love Trae, but this list isn't absurd.   There's a few positions I would change but a lot of those guys don't have the physical limitations Trae does.  I do think, just like many others on this list, Trae has HoF potential."
I love budget Jaylen Brown
"&gt;Sweep or Gentlemen sweep...that is a big disappointment compared to last year and a piss poor performance. So you think this years version of Oladipo is a needle mover for Miami like AD, Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray. Got it.  I think for the Heat loss of Jae and Olynk from last year would have been ok by adding Dipo. Yes i think another person that can create his own shot would have helped this Heat squad.   &gt;I guess you don't like stats? Less injuries =/= more injuries.  Stop comparing discussing league wide statistics, when its clear the discussion at hand is regards to the bubble teams. The only teams that had short off seasons were those that got invited to the bubble and then even more for those that made the bubble playoffs.   Why would i care about league wide data? The shortened off season is going to affect specific teams."
"Excuses ? All 4 teams that were in the conference championship have dealt with injuries. Jamal Murray ? (Torn ACL), Jaylen Brown (Broken wrist), LeBron (High  Ankle sprain), AD (Achilles), Butler (COVID &amp; Back &amp; Knee), Herro (Foot). These aren‚Äôt bench players either these are key impactful players. This season really didn‚Äôt benefit those teams, it‚Äôs very unfortunate because this season would‚Äôve been better."
In mean Jaylen Brown is the best centerpiece for a Beal trade.
&gt; But the best they were able to do was get to the Eastern Conference Finals in a really shitty conference twice. Ainge repeatedly refused to trade young assets for proven stars in order to get over the hump and compete for a championship. This is what the Lakers did and they won a championship. This is what the Nets did and they're most likely going to win a championship.  You do realize Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum haven't left the Celtics right
Jaylen Brown tier*
Siakam played bad with jaylen brown and Tatum guarding him two elite defensive wings while Randle was getting guarded by no one and is a lottery pick and more years in the league and did worse looool
"Also, Kemba's contract doesn't expire until 2023. The Celtics can't afford to just be shitty for two years while they wait on that. That's the summer that Jaylen Brown will be extension eligible, and if the Celtics at that point have just suffered through three straight mediocre seasons, it's possible he might prefer to move on rather than re-sign.   Boston is like any other team with young stars on their first post-rookie contracts: the clock is ticking. They only have a couple years to make the case that Boston is where they want to be. If they fuck around and waste a couple years instead, they may see Tatum and Brown start making trade demands."
He literally got us  ~~Micheal Jordan~~ Jaylen Brown
"Exactly.  Jimmy Butler? Left Minny for Miami after just a couple seasons.  Paul George? Left OKC after just a couple seasons.  Kawhi Leonard? Left Tornoto after just a season.  Anthony Davis? Made it clear he would refuse to re-sign with any team other than the Lakers, which he did.  The Kawhi trade only looks good because the Raptors won a ring against a depleted Warriors. Remove the hindsight bias and we could have lost Jaylen Brown for a ECF or Finals loss before losing Kawhi. No thanks. Respectfully to DeRozen, the Raptors didn't give up much - DeRozen's value is significantly lower than Brown's and their timetable was win-now.  IMO the player we should have made more of an effort for Harden."
"Wow ... this sure seems like Karma fallout from Kyrie's time in Boston.  That said, building with Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum as the current foundation isn't a bad place to try to re-launch their title hopes."
trade embiid and simmons for jaylen brown
"So you try and compete year in and year out which is what we've been doing. We had a down year due to injuries (down 3 starters in the first round of the playoffs) across the board, including Tatum himself catching covid. Why the fuck would this season make him think he can't win with Brown and the Celtics when he didn't play a single postseason minute with Jaylen? AGAIN,  I'm not saying you stand by and wait for Tatum to develop and hope he wants to stay for another contract then compete. We've been to multiple conference finals with Tatum. How is it unrealistic to be in the finals (and win) in the next 2-3 years? Only because YOU don't believe in them. There's no argument to have here if YOU just don't think Tatum and Brown are good enough. But I disagree, Brad &amp; Danny disagree, and Tatum &amp; Brown sure as hell disagree. Any comparisons of them to Dame &amp; CJ are ridiculous bc it ignores a complete half of the ball game (defense). Brown is already arguably better and I would argue Tatum over Dame moving forward these next years"
"Tatum and Brown are building pieces, would it be fair to criticize Pelicans because Zion and Ingram are plenty to build around? He fucked up crucially once in the past few years and that was keeping Rozier and Mook on contract years and telling them to take a back seat for an injured underperforming star after they got pretty far without him. Dude drafted Tatum and Jaylen when people were criticizing him for not drafting Dunn, Buddy, Dragan, Fultz, Jackson or Lonzo. Injuries basically killed whatever he's built in recent years so now the Celtics are punting for Jaylen and Jayson prime timeline"
"Your comment on player movement were so vague originally. It seemed like you insinuating a change in guard for Lebron and Kawhi's off season movement but not a reason for this years changes...  Sweep or Gentlemen sweep...that is a big disappointment compared to last year and a piss poor performance. So you think this years version of Oladipo is a needle mover for Miami like AD, Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray. Got it.  [I guess you don't like stats?](https://www.nba.com/news/nba-says-injury-rate-down-slightly-from-normal) Less injuries =/= more injuries."
"I actually agree in principle, but my line is much further than KOC's. I probably **would** take him over Steven Adams going into the 2021-2022 season. But definitely not Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Jrue Holiday, or some of the other players in this list.  As a proximation, there are probably 60-90 players I'd take over Stevens. But at a certain point, I'd take him over some player at their contract.  And for a coach like Nurse, it might be closer to 40-70."
I‚Äôm convinced no one on this sub has ever watched Jaylen Brown play
"Well now that you wrote it down correctly, everyone and their mother would have done Brown and Smart for Davis but that trade couldn‚Äôt be done without Tatum.   I was very much in favor of trading Jaylen for Harden, and Jaylen‚Äôs my favorite player. It didn‚Äôt happen tho.   The only one I‚Äôll admit I got wrong was Kawhi, when he was coming off the weirdest season I‚Äôve ever seen from a superstar and there were valid concerns about whether he‚Äôd play or not. Looks dumb now that he won a title in Toronto, but hindsight changes perspective."
Damn. Definitely should have done the Jaylen Brown + Smart for Tatum trade
And all those draft picks which netted them Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown
"Absolutely not.   At no time, during his stretch, was the Boston roster the best team in the East.   He made the playoffs in 2015 when no one thought they would. They made the 5th seed the next year when the East was good. Atlanta had a better roster and beat them in 6. He made the ECF the next year, and without their leading scorer, took a game from the Cavs. They make the ECF again without Kyrie and Hayward.  The 2019 season, they weren‚Äôt better than Milwaukee even if Kyrie played like a star, so ECSF or ECF was their limit. From 2017-2019, at no time, even thought Stevens has done well against the Warriors big 4, does Boston beat them in the series. Maybe 2019, but that would require Kyrie to play like a star and not quit on the Celts.  2020, they underachieved against Miami in the ECF, but that was also a limit for me. I expected them to lose in the ECSF to a healthy Philly team or lose in the ECF to Milwaukee. And he outcoached a good HC in Nick Nurse in a great 7-game series.  And this year, team struggled with COVID. The lack of depth showed. A super overrated coach does not beat Brooklyn, playing their 3 stars, with this roster, period. That is also without their 2nd best player in Jaylen Brown, and with Kemba Walker bricking everything until the end."
"I like how people still talk about the pick haul as if it didn‚Äôt turn into jayson tatum and jaylen brown, plus some players who have the potential to develop further and smart rob and pritchard with our own picks. You can criticize him for not maximizing on some of the whiffs (yabu...) but to act like he failed because he only got an all nba player, an all star, an all defense player, a guy who just blocked 9 shots a week ago and more guys with promise is nuts. If he traded tatum or brown for one season rentals of AD, PG, kawhi or butler we‚Äôd be in a much worse position than we are now"
"I feel like he can‚Äôt assemble a winning team, just good players. I get they didn‚Äôt have Jaylen brown, but I don‚Äôt think that saves them from the nets."
"Paul Pierce, Antoine Walker, Rajon Rondo, Jaylen Brown, and Jayson Tatum?????"
"I assure you, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are already fully developed, strong, handsome players :*)"
Would've been a great move for them until he trades away Jaylen Brown to make space to re-sign Tristan Thompson
Not a big fan of Fournier slander; honestly thought he gives you like 75% of what Jaylen Brown does at half the cost...Now you have him and Jaylen Brown on the same team lol
"Kenny is good for culture and for instilling a somewhat old school program with new school tendencies (he holds players accountable while also not playing his players high minutes).   In game, he‚Äôs stubborn (he‚Äôs like Coach Bud of yesteryear in that drop coverage is all he believes in defensively). His rotations are rigid (if Jaylen brown makes 5 threes in a row but he usually comes out at the 6 minute mark of the 1st quarter, he‚Äôs coming out no matter what). He also doesn‚Äôt read momentum very well, and will call timeouts too late  Overall, he‚Äôs a good coach, &amp; he‚Äôll empower young players to find their way and play through mistakes. He‚Äôd develop your bench for sure but I‚Äôm not sure where the ceiling would be"
"He did a good job. Made some mistakes, got unlucky, and probably could've shot for the fences more in the 2020 season, but I've generally thought that, aside from not blowing up half of the 2019 team, his decision making aged well. He gets criticized a lot for not going for that list of stars, but in the end most of those players wouldn't have been championship-level difference makers for us and would likely have left, and in the end he gets to come away with both Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, who each have at least an argument for being the best players in their drafts. And aside from all of that, I think people would look at him and Brad Stevens very differently had Gordon Hayward never broken his leg."
"Lmaaaaaooooo this is such a shitty take.   2015-2017: WHY ARENT THE CS TRADING FOR BOOGIE TO BECOME 2ND ROUND EXITS???  2017: Celtics trade for Kyrie Irving   2017-2019: OHMYGOD THE CELTICS CANT STAY HEALTHY. THEY SHOULD TRADE THEIR FUTURE PIECES FOR A YEAR LONG RENTAL.   Irving leaves, Hayward breaks his legs, horford leaves, etc etc etc....  That was all freak luck. When you break it down, Ainge provided the Celtics an amazing championship window from 2017-2020 but it fell short. You can't blame him for not trading for Kawhi. I would rather have Jaylen brown. Ask any C's fan.   The only bad, unjustifiable moves that have happened have been from late 2019-now, when he signed panic signed Kemba. In hindsight he should've kept Terry and have him start but he the Charlotte contract at the time was huge.   ALSO, everyone keeps bringing up: OHMYGOD AINGE COULSVE HAD MYKES TURNER BUT HE ASKED FOR TOO MUCH!!!!   No. No. That's not what fucking happened. Hayward was asking for too much money to sign and trade and Ainge was asking for those players becuase they needed to be included to make a deal work. Then MJ swooped in with the bag and killed the deal. Long story short, Indy didn't want Hayward for the price MJ was offering becuase they didn't have the fucking cap space to make it work without sending over someone like McDermott with Turner.   Rant over. You're being way too harsh in Ainge, especially coming from a goddamn Bulls fan. What has your gm done besides land Zach Lavine and an aging Vuc?"
"is there any combination of realistic moves or choices he could have made that would've gotten them another title, defeating a superteam? highly doubtful   getting AD wasn't a realistic option, he only wanted to play in LA. kawhi....maybe that was possible? but would have cost them jaylen brown and more. and like AD, kawhi was always going to leave whatever team he was traded to for LA."
"Yeah, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are both huge wastes of assets"
"I think it‚Äôs maybe a bit premature to say that Jaylen Brown doesn‚Äôt move the needle for them in the playoffs. This season was arguably his breakout year, and besides for maybe Smart he‚Äôs easily the best perimeter defender on the team. I think if the Celtics were fully healthy it‚Äôs possible they steal another game or 2 from brooklyn this past series. Like you said the Kyrie thing wasn‚Äôt really something they could control and I think they made the best of a bad situation with signing Kemba. As I mentioned above I think there were much better options with the Hayward sign and trade, but keeping him around for 30m a year wasn‚Äôt really a serious option. The only other place to point to is the draft picks and I think the young guys like Romeo still have a lot of room to grow and at the very least play solid defense."
"consider him, like they do with Jaylen Brown"
"Tatum for multiple years over a likely AD rental of one year, yeah, that's a no-brainer.  It's also why I'm still grateful Ainge didn't trade Jaylen Brown for a Kawhi Leonard one year rental, either."
"So Jaylen Brown just doesn‚Äôt exist?... Celtics have a good young core. Timelord showed a ton of promise when he was healthy in the playoffs and there‚Äôs still plenty of time on this teams timeline to put together a championship contender. Admittedly, wasting the years that Tatum and Brown were absolutely balling on rookie scale contracts is a bit of a bummer. I fear we may be heading for that consistent 8 seed, not good enough for a title and not bad enough for a solid pick, position. Also getting greedy and asking for VO with the Hayward for Turner sign and trade was completely idiotic."
"Bruh it‚Äôs not even Brads fault that they got whooped by the Nets. No Jaylen Brown and against KD, Kyrie and Harden...   What outcome did they expect from this series in Boston?"
Any plan for that Jaylen Brown foe? Do you think he is a qualified piece for Frank Ntilikina?
"I'm not arguing that the Celtics should have traded for him. Giving up Jaylen Brown AND picks AND Smart for Harden is simply not worth it.  This is more that Houston took a terrible deal. When Ben Simmons is on the table, he's easily worth more than anything the Nets did offer."
"I agree he was flawed but the same time the players they were likely to give up would have included Jaylen Brown. Time will tell if that was the right decision, but it‚Äôs also important to realize that historically nba players peak around age 28 or so and Tatum and brown aren‚Äôt there yet   All of those other guys were likely to be one year rentals. Of course there‚Äôs the argument winning a ring or competing is better than keeping guys around for their potential to win one down the road, but it was the decision that was made. I doubt Toronto minds declining after they knew kawhi was basically a rental for a ring but it can go either way  From a different perspective some Celtics fans have been calling for Kemba to be traded. The thing is that he probably doesn‚Äôt have much value. Jimmy was great last year though less great this season. Is it worth giving up brown to be better short term but potentially worse long term? Again no one can say but that‚Äôs how the Celtics decided to proceed"
"I mean, I agreed with what you said initially. And regardless of the Single Point of Failure offense, D'Antoni isn't big on defense too. So no matter how good Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart can be, unless you have a scheme that can keep the offense guessing, it's pretty redundant because the team won't be executing the same thing."
"On paper that team was insane. A team where Jaylen Brown is the fourth best player, and you have Al Horford, Marcus Smart, and Marcus Morris too. Plus Baynes and Theis who were good role players. They were 1 win away from making the conference finals without Kyrie or Hayward and got 55 wins while missing a max player for the entire season."
"the thing is the other teams had to give up the farm for harden, but the nets didn‚Äôt, they gave up jarrett allen and caris levert plus some picks and swaps, the other teams‚Äô rumored deals included young all stars like ben simmons and jaylen brown"
They're not that close. They were super mediocre with Jaylen Brown as well. Lowry could make them more competitive but he's more of a large boost for a team already competing than someone who's going to make a mediocre team great.
"Celtics literally couldn‚Äôt trade for AD with Kyrie on the team, before Kyrie signed a new contract, and we know what happened with that.  And yeah, we‚Äôll be okay, we have Jaylen Brown."
"I don‚Äôt think Malik Beasley would stop them from getting Jaylen Brown lol  Not that they‚Äôd do that trade in the first place, but still."
We were a .500 team with a perfectly healthy Jaylen Brown.
Jaylen Brown as well
Pretty dope to be able to get Harden but decide not to because you don‚Äôt want to trade Jaylen fucking Brown lmao
1. Jaylen Brown 2. Ben Simmons 3. Jamal Murray 4. Domantas Sabonis  5. Brandon Ingram 6. Pascal Siakam
You are not getting Damian Lillard without including Jaylen Brown. He's your most valuable trade asset and trading him is your best chance at building a contender. Tatum+Lillard is a top 2 seed and immediate contender where as with Brown you risk being a very mediocre .500 basketball team. Floor and ceiling rises significantly. If I'm the celtics I'm doing everything I can to move Brown for Lillard IF dame actually wants out
"Who's on the All-Harvard team? Jokic, Jaylen Brown, Jeremy Lin, and who else?"
Celtics did get Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum out of that trade though
"I heard a source say that the Atlanta Hawks weren't interested in Jaylen Brown on that draft night.  If we could have dangled more picks, including the 2018 Brooklyn pick, who knows"
"dru is good, but he's more of a 2 guard (similar to jaylen brown), what they need is a creator, giannis shouldn't have the ball at the top of the key, with his shooting it makes no sense.   Giving up brogdon was their worst decision by far. dru is a great player but they still need a creator."
"Boston's window is already closed because we just had to pay Jaylen Brown, the most overrated player in the NBA."
"Tatum couldn't beat Milwaukee with Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Marcus Smart and Al Horford, with Brad Stevens as a coach. Cope how you want, Embiid is better. OH, and Luka will ALWAYS be a better player than Trash Young."
"I don't think it would ever happen, but can you imagine a Jaylen Brown on the Hawks.  That would make the Hawks a top 3 team in the east...and by top 3 I mean Sixers,  Nets then Hawks battling for ranking.  They need another top scorer at the 2 or 3, like a JB or a PG."

"you trippin, jaylen brown has definitely improved"
Steph is an excellent playmaker who makes good passes.  Mitchell is like a shorter jaylen brown with a much better handle and defense.  That‚Äôs his closest Comp imo.
"you don't have to tell me, people spent the whole year acting like Jaylen Brown &amp; Jayson Tatum need to be split up or that Danny Ainge, the GM that won a title, pulled off one of the greatest trades in NBA history that netted the team 2 under 25 All-NBA level talents was Vlade Divac level bad."
Jaylen Brown also acceptable.
Trae Young is not better than Jaylen Brown. And def can‚Äôt guard anyone
Insane isn‚Äôt it? Have you considered Jaylen Brown is overrated?
"yeah, that's why it's impossible to tell right now. Everything hinges on just a couple of those picks becoming good. Brooklyn was only really bad for two years before Marks was able to kinda right the ship, but those two years got Boston Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, essentially setting up their franchise to be at least competitive for the majority of the 2020s.  Also the tank can allow Houston to keep their pick this year. There's a chance that a top 3 pick this year lands them a future star on that level, so that alone is huge for the rebuild, and there's no realistic chance of keeping the pick if Houston kept Harden, or swapped him for a package revolving around a few good players."
"Same here... I basically had 3 borderline-second-round-caliber guys in addition to Luka Legend (Ayton, Middleton, Jaylen Brown). Luck definitely played a big role for me as well."
"Were you a threat to the Nets? Yay or nay?   Are you watching this Bucks series? Do they look far more committed defensively?  Literally no need to be a homer about it, your team wasn't taken seriously with Jaylen Brown out and then Kemba out. Tatum was still a fucking beast and there was no stopping him offensively, but Nets were flat out not going as hard defensively for the role players either."
&gt; it's better now btw  honest question. in what way is it better...?   round 1: Celtics without Jaylen Brown  round 2: Bucks doing their best impersonation of the 2013-2016 Raptors (or better yet... that 60+ win Hawks team coach Bud coached that LeBron promptly swept...)  round 3: 1 legged Embiid? assuming they get past ATL?
The Celtics without Jaylen Brown and no Kemba or Rob Williams for the last few games gave up a better fight that the Bucks who lost by 50 without Harden playing   You really think it‚Äôs the Nets being op in contrast to the Bucks being trash?
&gt;missing Jaylen Brown  And Kemba and Rob Williams. We were playing with 2/5 of our starting lineup most of the series.
Of course he can :)  PG: Damian Lilliard  SG: Klay Thompson  SF: Jaylen Brown  PF: Serge Ibaka  C: Deandre Ayton
"Russell Westbrook, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, Shaq"
U need jaylen brown
I‚Äôm not expecting it and I understand what you are saying but I don‚Äôt think most people realize his time playing has been with an injured nurkic or CJ as #2.   Even a Jaylen Brown or Bam level player would be a game changer. Not to mention an actual deep bench. I‚Äôm not saying it would be easy or even likely - but I wish we got to see it before commenting definitively about his chances as a #1.
Simmons isn't good enough to be a centerpiece in a trade. Portland should look elsewhere like maybe the Celtics for Jaylen Brown and other stuff
"Jaylen Brown, Tatum, and Lillard, with a side of Robert Williams."
They need Jaylen Brown IMO.
...without Jaylen Brown. And Kemba Walker for half the series.
"The Bucks were really down by 49 at one point in the fourth, the whole team should be embarrassed. That Celtics team missing Jaylen Brown put up a wayyy better fight than this weak shit"
U guys played way better while having to deal with no jaylen brown and harden actually played that series  Bucks look so gross
Celtics look more like a championship team than the Bucks right now without Jaylen Brown
Celtics without Jaylen Brown&gt;Bucks
"Jaylen Brown, Ingram can‚Äôt play D and plays too much hero ball&amp; MPJ has negative IQ points so he‚Äôll always be a liability no matter how talented he is at scoring"
"I think it is a lot more players than people think.  Look at some of the players on here [for example](https://www.espn.com/basketball/story/_/id/30482938/ranking-best-nba-players-2020-21-50-11). I think there are over 20 players that can be the best player on the team and still win it all if the rest of the team is really good as well. If you have a team like Jrue Holiday, Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert for example I think that team can win it all."
"I bet if Jaylen Brown were on a team with a young, All-NBA-level forward, that team would be a lock for top-4 in its conference."
and Jaylen Brown.
"I‚Äôm not sure you can make them a contender. I would say trade CJ for some scoring wing (Brandon Ingram?)or interior presence but even then that doesn‚Äôt make them drastically better. They are pretty much what they are going to be middling western conference playoff team. Trade dame for Ben Simmons, Maxey, pick(s) and or Jaylen brown pick(s) and Payton Pritchard. That would be real of them to do for dame, they would still be competitive too"
"I know this will never happen but if they were able to have Jaylen Brown, that will be the perfect #2 for Luka. Can create shot for himself, a great slasher, hit the open shot and the cherry on the top, defense."
"I can't believe this guy got paid more than Giannis Antetokounmpo, Bradley Beal, Jrue Holiday, Julius Randle, Jamal Murray and Jaylen Brown this season."
"He's 12th in the league in Offensive Rebounds.  It's actually his defensive rebounds that are so low. Below Steph, LaMelo, Jaylen Brown, RJ Barrett. etc."
"Some guys I was REALLY high on at recent Celtics draft positions:  -  * 2020, Pick #26: **Tyrell Terry** ‚Äì got Payton Pritchard instead  * 2019, Pick #14: **Sekou Doumbouya or Goga Bitadze** ‚Äì I'd still take either over Romeo Langford but none are really blowing up the league  * 2017, Pick #1: **Markelle Fultz** ‚Äì got Jayson Tatum instead  * 2016, Pick #3: Take **Dragan Bender** or trade down and get **Jakob Poeltl** ‚Äì got Jaylen Brown instead  * 2014, Pick #6: I thought **Noah Vonleh** was the new Chris Bosh ‚Äì got Marcus Smart instead"
"For a more apt comparison - Jaylen Brown doesn't hold a candle to Giannis or LeBron but he's gotten much better at absorbing contact and finishing at the rim. He can get 24-25 a game, not necessarily super efficiently, but definitely as a more versatile and polished scorer than Simmons.  Jaylen's a threat as a shooter which helps a lot but purely in terms of driving ability I'd argue he's better (at this stage at least) than Simmons."
"You do realise Team USA brought Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Harrison Barnes, Myles Turner, and Khris Middleton to the 2019 World Cup and still finished seventh, right?"
Atleast it was injuries. They have a fully healthy squad. I don't think Jaylen Brown has hit his ceiling yet
It was all because Myles Turner sucked. They had to play Jaylen Brown at center multiple times.
"Serious question ‚Äî why would Tatum leave Boston? A storied franchise in a beloved city playing for a team with a great basketball mind for a GM. They‚Äôre really only one or two pieces away from being serious contenders, especially when Jaylen Brown comes back."
"Until you have fans making fun of Jayson Tatum or Jaylen Brown for admitting they have depression, or purposefully misrepresenting every quote they say as some type of ""cocky""/disrespectful attitude, then no, your franchise isn't hated more than the Clippers."
"I hope so. Michigan bball (my main squeeze) recruited him hard, and I always get attached to those dudes and wanna see them succeed, even if they shun us (like Jaylen Brown). I also have always liked Dallas, love Luka's game, plus they have two Wolverines in THJ &amp; Trey (though, I would guess he moght not stick around, after the way he played).  I know Dallas is in a tight spot with possibilities for acquisitions, so if Brunson plays up to his potential and they can make some moves, they should be contenders again."
"In my opinion...  Top 10 (no order): Kawhi, LeBron, KD, Curry, Harden, Giannis, Embiid, Jokic, Luka, Dame  10-20 (no order): Booker, Beal, Westbrook, AD, Kyrie, Gobert, Mitchell, CP3, Trae, Tatum  Debatables: LaVine, Zion, Morant, Jaylen Brown, KAT, Fox, Ingram, Hayward, Randle, Bam, Butler, Middleton, Sabonis"
"That aren‚Äôt? It took the Bucks shooting like Playoffs Randle for the Nets to squeeze out a win without Harden. And the previous series, the Nets were up against a team that went .500 in the regular season *with* Jaylen Brown, and Tatum still made it somewhat interesting."
"Would loooooove KP on the Celtics. Not sure we have anything to get that done without throwing in Jaylen Brown tho, which sorta defeats the purpose."
"Maybe similar to Jaylen this year ?   He has All Star/Borderline All Star potential but I don‚Äôt see him ever being a ‚Äúsuperstar‚Äù like the 2 guys picked before him.  If he‚Äôs able to get numbers similar to Jaylen Brown this year and play similar level of defence, he‚Äôll be great for years."
"Jaylen brown, fournier and timelord are better than any player in the mavs not named luka"
Yall basically have a giant Jaylen Brown sized hole.
"Boston seems like a good team, tatum is still young. Trade Jaylen Brown. Boston isnt a definite championship team but with Dame and some other adjustments they can be good contenders"
Metta World Peace and Jaylen Brown would have the best conversations ever
Delusional if you think Portland trades Dame for a post-injury Jaylen Brown unless it's raining picks.
"If Boston hires Kidd, and offers Portland a package for Lillard centered around Jaylen Brown, I could see all parties accepting it."
I can just imagine him showing a Glock to Jaylen Brown and saying 'You know Jaylen. Sometimes peace isn't an option'
I think LaVine is still underrated because of his team's record. I think he's better than Jaylen Brown and on par with Donovan Mitchell.
"Lakers?  Let‚Äôs see. Off the top of my head:   Lebron, kd, curry, harden, kyrie, mitchel, trae, luka, giannis, Jokic, embiid, Simmons, Lillard, Beal, Westbrook, Zion, Morant, booker, Tatum, jaylen brown, sabonis, lavine, pg13, cp3, and maybe even gorbet and Ayton.   That‚Äôs who id honestly have over ad. So he‚Äôs right there close to the 25 spot for me"
Bradley Beal  Devin Booker  Donovan Mitchell  Zach LaVine  Jaylen Brown (count him as a SF though)
hijacking top comment to ask.. how is jaylen brown even considered a SG?  is marcus smart considered a SF? lol
I can‚Äôt believe some of you guys are putting Beal this low...he‚Äôs so good. It‚Äôs booker Beal mitchell lavine jaylen to me. And that‚Äôs not saying much bc jaylen brown is incredible. They‚Äôre all amazing players
1: Devin Booker  2: Bradley Beal  3: Spida  4: Jaylen   5: Brown      99: Trash ass Ben Simmons
"I like Jaylen the most even though he‚Äôs probably the worst. Seems much more plug and play than the rest.   Probably Booker, Lavine, Beal, Mitchell, Brown"
Jaylen Brown/Marcus Smart/1st round picks for Lillard
"There‚Äôs a very upvoted post in their sub talking about every playoffs team has at least one better second option than THJ this playoffs and that‚Äôs why people should start considering Luka as the best player in the nba if he wins this series.  Some guys they named as better on the Celtics: Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Evan Fournier when only one of them was healthy   Some guys from other teams: Herro, maybe Kendrick Nunn, and ‚Äúarguably‚Äù Kuzma, Drummond, and Harrell"
"Yup.  Robert Williams of the Celtics is amazing, but I keep saying he has to learn to use his length and trick his brain into thinking he can‚Äôt jump.  Jaylen Brown has the idea‚Äîhe almost never dunks anymore.  That old man game isn‚Äôt just good for when you‚Äôre old, it‚Äôs good to learn young and then still have your body intact when you get old"
"I assume you are talking about the 6% down number from the NBA report right? That number is just player games missed, and I would expect the NBA to publish whatever number reflects the best on them. It shouldn't be ignored, but there are other ways of analyzing the numbers.  Just one example of a player I would argue is being undercounted by play games missed: Jaylen Brown played 58 games, but he had a season ender."
"‚ÄúFelicitations, malefactors! I am endeavoring to misappropiate the formulary for affordable comestibles!‚Äù - Jaylen Brown  Felicitations = congratulations   Malefactors = criminal   Endeavoring = to try hard   Misappropiate = unfairly taking something   Formulary = collection of formula   Comestibles = food   Translation: Congrats, bad guys. I am trying to steal the formula for cheap food."
Jaylen Brown did go to college  nearby at Cal üëÄ
Jaylen Brown
Remember in 2021 when AD/Harden/Embiid/CP3/Jaylen Brown/Jamal Murray got injured
"‚ÄúFelicitations, malefactors! I am endeavoring to misappropiate the formulary for affordable comestibles!‚Äù - Jaylen Brown"
"Jaylen Brown came into the league as a pure athlete that provided energy on defense but no ball-handling or shooting and has become a legit 3 level scorer, obviously nowhere near Kawhi‚Äôs level though"
Every time I see THJ play in their green jerseys I start to get Jaylen Brown vibes and it's not just the beard
The way it would work is Dame would choose a team he wants to go to and the team would need to acquire enough assets for Blazers to be comfortable in trading or they hold onto Dame. It doesn't matter if Philly has Ben Simmons or Celtics has Jaylen Brown to offer unless Dame wants to go there
Wiseman is garbage. Jaylen Brown is a future superstar if Boston offered that its easily the best thing you can get for Dame
Boston by far.       Jaylen Brown is far better than anything those other teams can offer
Dame can score the points needed as a number 1 but he needs a real number 2. If they could get a 2 that scores like 18-20 a game and plays great defense they could contend for a title. Jimmy Butler/PG/Jaylen Brown.
Jaylen Brown or Ben Simmons anything else eff off
I think the Celtics would be interested. They might offer Jaylen Brown if that's what it cost. The only reason the Celtics never traded for Harden/AD/Kawhi was because of the risk of them walking soon after. Dame is under contract for 4 more years after this season so there's no risk of that.    Celtics are under new management so I guess we'll have to see if they are bigger risk takers than Ainge used to be.
I think Zach Lowe had a great point on his latest pod. The league views CJ as at best the third best player on a championship team. Accordingly other teams are not willing to give up a star second option. Who could the Blazers possibly get in return that would make them considerably better? I don‚Äôt see them getting Jaylen Brown or Brandon Ingram. A Heat-package of Herro and other young players would not be a win-now move to satisfy Lillard. Tough spot.
makes me feel better knowing we have jaylen brown as tatums 2nd
"Jaylen Brown is good, but outside of that you‚Äôre pretty much right"
"BOS gets: CJ McCollum, Kristaps Porzingis, Josh Richardson, POR 2023 1st, POR 2027 1st, DAL 2025 1st, CLE 2025 2nd  POR gets: Kevin Love, Jaylen Brown, Collin Sexton  DAL gets: Norman Powell, Taurean Prince, Tristan Thompson  CLE gets: Kemba Walker, POR 2025 1st, DAL 2024 2nd  It‚Äôs not realistic, nor does it make sense, but here is one."
Tim hardaway reminds me of jaylen brown cause of the look
jaylen brown and its not close
Honestly? Jaylen Brown. I feel like next season he'll be better than PG
random question. who would you rather have on your team: paul george or jaylen brown?
"What does that have to do with Jaylen Brown? Why does no one hate him even tho he‚Äôs outspoken? Maybe it‚Äôs bc he‚Äôs genuine and seems sincere. He doesn‚Äôt resort to hot takes and making everything about him. It‚Äôs about the cause for him.   And even at the time those events especially the Eric Garner one were consensus abuses of excessive force by the police that opened a lot of ppl‚Äôs eyes to policing in this country. So being against mindless police violence is not a controversial position to take. Even then. Idk why that‚Äôs relevant to you, but the way ppl treat Jaylen Brown (who is actually an activist) differently than Lebron isn‚Äôt.   You and I both know the reason why Brown and Lebron are treated diff. It has nothing to do with politics and nothing to do with race. It‚Äôs all about authenticity and not choosing profit over morals."
Kemba is awful and always injured . That return is 1st round exit every year. If your going to trade dame you might as well blow it all up . Shift the franchise to rebuild not take on massive contracts. Jaylen brown would be great but I‚Äôd want the Celtics to find a 3rd team to ship kemba.
"I miss that 2016 team so much. IT, Smart, Jae, Avery Bradley, Olynyk, Horford, Jaylen Brown. That team had so much heart"
"He is legit. Bosh is one of those athletes I would love to have a conversation with about stuff, just because of how smart he is. Him and Jaylen Brown."
The only package I would think about for Dame is Jaylen Brown + Kemba + young talent + picks
"For some reason I always knew Jaylen was going to be a 20+ppg scorer with the defense to go along with it. Even when people were raving about Jayson during his first playoff tear, Jaylen was right there with him. I understand that Jayson maybe has more upside, but never thought Jaylen Brown would just be a role player averaging 16ppg or something.  I just thought I was crazy for having expecting this of him for the last 3 or so years while everyone else here thought he wouldn't be this his."
Pelicans probably. If only because a rookie Brandon Ingram or a rookie Jaylen Brown is still an upgrade over Solomon Hill and an injured Quincy Pondexter. But Demps would have been criticized even more for passing on the LSU guy.
"That was why I wanted Ingram or even Jaylen Brown at the time. I Knew Simmons had the most innate talent, and the highest upside, everyone did, but I also knew that he was the least likely to reach that ceiling, especially with the comparisons he was getting like LeBron and Magic."
"Nope. He had Horford his rookie year and none of them when he made it last year. He did have Kemba but Kemba got injured midway through.  His rookie year was actually really crazy. Not only were Kyrie and Hayward out, but so was Theis. Marcus Smart was out for the first four games after a bad thumb injury that needed surgery and clearly affected his shot once he was back. Jaylen Brown tore his hamstring game 7 vs the Bucks and missed the first sixers game before being on a minutes restriction off the bench until the fifth and final game of the series.  What that meant was we had a starting lineup of Terry/Tatum/Horford with either Jaylen or Smart and one of Baynes/Morris/Semi. The others came off the bench along with Shane Larkin who was averaging 14 minutes a game and Greg Monroe with a bit less than 10."
"Dinwiddie an UFA. Pay Dinwiddie to run second unit and sign Lowry. Trade Ben and get first rounders plus nice rotational 3/d pieces, or bundle Maxey/Thybulle + Ben for a Brad Beal or Jaylen brown"
"I know you're being sarcastic, but it's kinda close. Really only missing LeBron, Steph and Russ, and that's pretty much the best group of USA players currently playing. Maybe LaVine and Jaylen Brown to round out the roster?"
Jaylen brown is on a bargain contract
"Does the change in scenery wake him up, or is this his new ceiling?  Jaylen Brown looks like a steal and the much better player, similar to Tatum vs Fultz.  76's and Celtics were so important in those drafts and there is a clear winner."
"The most recent one I can think of was when [Ryen Rusillo reported on his podcast](https://www.theringer.com/2021/1/6/22217604/real-nba-scouting-reports-ben-simmons-vs-jaylen-brown-former-broncos-linebacker-brandon-marshall) a conversation he had with a scout:  &gt;	‚ÄúHe does not put in the time to improve.  &gt;	‚ÄúVery poor perimeter shooter and like he doesn‚Äôt look at the rim,‚Äù Russillo reports.  &gt;	‚ÄúTotal non-three-point shooter. Doc says he‚Äôs not concerned but come playoff time he will be. He must improve as a free-throw shooter, especially in the playoffs. Career 60-percent on five attempts per game.  &gt;	‚ÄúI know some of what‚Äôs going on in Philly the past three seasons. One of his problems is he does not put in the time to improve. Don‚Äôt believe the IG or Twitter workouts you see his brother post. It‚Äôs all phony. He does not work on his shooting. Everyone can see the mechanical problems, but he is not and probably will not address it.  &gt;	‚ÄúHe loves LA and spends most of his time there in the offseason. He definitely has some Hollywood in him. If he ever gets serious about improving his shooting and free throws he could be as good as Giannis, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs wired that way. lots of cool guy with him.  &gt;	‚ÄúI would take Jaylen over Ben moving forward the next 8 to 10 years,‚Äù Russillo report says. ‚ÄúThere is very little separation on difference defensively. Both are excellent in today‚Äôs game. Shooting is so important and Jaylen is clearly better and always will be, in my opinion. Both are fantastic open court players, Jaylen also has a more serious workman like approach to improving.‚Äù"
"He was only here for 2.5 years.    All his picks had value and would have been traded for more value if allowed.  Some were.     Draft 1 Noel - consensus #1.    BC held onto him too long.  Mostly due to elective surgery Nerlens got   MCW- traded for future pick, Mikal Bridges.  Again, subsequent GM couldn‚Äôt convert the layup and just take the hometown kid  Draft 2   Embiid - MVP candidate  Dario- half of Butler trade.  Again future GM messed it up.    Also picked up an extra 1st which was later Shamet.  Who also was pissed away by Brand in Tobi deal.   And also selected Jerami grant who in Bryan Colangelo first move was traded for ersan.     Year 3   Okafor - was traded to Boston for the Jaylen brown pick.  Newly installed Advisor Jerry Colangelo cancelled.   Bunch of 2s- one of which was Richaun Holmes who was later given away in a cash dump so we could compete a trade for Mike Muscala  It wasn‚Äôt perfect.    But a lot of the mistakes were bc of subsequent GMs.    Put another way, Embiid, Dario, Grant and Holmes isn‚Äôt a bad haul for 3 drafts.  Plus UD free agents RoCo and TJ.    If he was allowed to complete the Jaylen trade bad if brown didn‚Äôt fuck up Bridges it would be even better.  But those are out of his control."
"He was scapegoated but he was also pretty shit.   They had a lot of issues and he was only responsible for some of them.   For example, in one of the early games against Boston in the 2018 series these were the primary defensive assignments:  * 6'3 Redick (with a 6'2 wingspan) on Tatum  * Slow-footed Covington on lightning-quick Terry Rozier * Simmons resting against an easier assignment in Smart * Saric struggling on Horford   Jaylen was injured for that game and yet Philly still struggled to contain our 1-4 purely because Brett Brown had misunderstood all our players. They had enough bodies to defend our guys if they used those guys correctly.  Tatum was a top 4 pick purely based on his ability to abuse mismatches against small white guys in college. Terry Rozier's breakout that season was 50% improving his shooting and 50% learning to control his insane speed.  Normally we would have schemed to get the mismatches he was giving us on a silver platter.   I remember as a fan being insulted by how poorly organised those 76ers were coming into the series. The same way it felt insulting when Budenholzer kept playing drop coverage against Durant in the recent MIL/BRK series.  He didn't deserve all the blame but he did need to go."
"There is literally no reason the Celtics would want CJ, we have Jaylen Brown. Our need is a floor general style PG and a reliable 4."
Nobody had considered Jaylen Brown at that point
"Easy to say, harder to actually do. What better options are even available for a trade? Not like we can just go to the Celtics and force them to give up Jaylen Brown. Most of the guys available are available for a reason"
"The thing with the blazers is that they do have Norman Powell, and if he is willing to resign, he can totally slot into CJ's starting spot. He would be cheaper,  play better defense, and be better driving to the hoop,  even if he does not have CJ's elite midrange handles.   The ideal situation would be to trade CJ for a good wing player with size,  defense, and playmaking. More the question would be is Ben Simmons the best wing we can fetch for CJ? Simmons certainly has the size,  defense, and playmaking, but his shooting is perhaps irrevocably broken and he doesn't appear to care to try to fix his game.   Still this still might be the best the blazers can get to try to make a final run in Dame's prime. It's not like we can turn CJ into Jaylen Brown or Paul George or Kris Middleton."
"What do you mean? Danny Ainge said racism doesnt exist in Boston, right? Jaylen Brown cured the racism problems of Boston by himself"
1. BI 1. Jaylen Brown 1. Sabonis 1. Siakam 1. Brogdan 1. J Murray 1. LeVert 1. D Murray 1. Simmons 1. Beasley 1. Buddy 1. Jacob 1. Zubac 1. Valentine
"1. Jaylen Brown   2. Jamal Murray   3. Brandon Ingram   People live Ingram I know but the thing people have to remember is we‚Äôve never seen Murray or Brown as a #1 full time, so everything we‚Äôve seen from them is actually only a portion of their potential. Murray‚Äôs ceiling is bubble Murray , 1st team all nba caliber. Brown for those few games Tatum was out was ‚Ä¶putting up the same numbers as Tatum. He‚Äôs a 27-5-5 type wing . They are all-nba, alpha , lead a team to a title type studs   Ingram? Imo is a notch down. A true #2. I like him but he‚Äôs kinda on the flip side as far as opportunities. We‚Äôve seen him as a #1 and we‚Äôve probably seen his max level. He‚Äôs good, very good, but not as high a ceilings the other 2‚Ä¶  Oh and since it‚Äôs relatively close I‚Äôd also factor in his demeanor. I don‚Äôt see Brandon ingram as a leader of a team, whereas I see Murray as a good one and Jaylen brown ascending to a GREAT one"
"This narrative really needs to die. I‚Äôm fine saying that we blew the trade, but we did not try to spite the Lakers. We tried to get more.   The move we pulled is literally what OKC did to the Clippers. LeBron hadn‚Äôt committed yet and we were selling the ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not trading for Kawhi, you‚Äôre trading for Kawhi AND LeBron‚Äù line. Last minute, Lakers said fuck it and they‚Äôd roll the dice and LeBron came anyways, meaning the initial offer was off the table.   To add to that, Kawhi‚Äôs stock was in the toilet because nobody had seen him play meaningful minutes in a year, his injury was mysterious to everyone, and the rumors were that anyone trading for him was getting a one year rental before he went to LA. Jaylen Brown and Ben Simmons were both names that were floating but neither teams wanted to touch that situation with a 10 foot pole because there were too many question marks.   I think we really screwed up the Kawhi trade. I think we should‚Äôve just held on until the season started, but the Spurs buckled under pressure. For the first time in over 20+ years, Spurs were the topic of rumors and that dysfunctional team. They were so desperate to get out of that position, they took the first trade with an All-Star that was available."
"They have him listed at 6'7"" on basketball reference, but I always assume they have undershot it. Like, there's no fucking way Shaq was 325 lbs by the end of his career, but that's what they have him at. They still have KD listed at 6'10"" as well. I don't have the opportunity to watch Zion as much as I'd like, but when he played the Celtics he definitely seemed taller than Jaylen Brown. In any case Zion is a fucking tank. He's somewhere between 6'6"" and 6'8"", about 285-290 lbs. It's unbelievable how strong he is to have the hops he does. I hope he can stay healthy on that frame, he is going to be in the MVP conversation as long as he stays healthy."
"Maybe but more than anything, I think it was just a bad pick. Imagine this Philly team with Jaylen Brown on it."
Yeah and jaylen brown specifically asked for a black coach .
"God one of my favorite threads to go back to is the Jaylen Brown draft thread, where people are laughing at Ainge for not accepting Noel+24+26 for the third overall."
"Usually when teams pick that high (top 3) they‚Äôll have their guy chosen way before the draft and they‚Äôre focusing more on other offseason moves. The draft is just a formality at that point. Just look at most mock drafts, the top 3 is almost always spot on, the last time I remember genuinely being surprised was when we took Jaylen Brown 3rd and he was projected to go between 5-10. Rarely will teams that high call an audible on or close to draft night."
"Because Harden tanked his value   In an ideal world, harden‚Äôs actual value is closer to Jaylen Brown and Smart, Dame, MPJ and Murray"
"Players especially young players usually shoot poorly in game 7s like sabonis and jaylen brown in 2018 game 7s, this is trae young's first playoffs and first game 7. In the end of the day his feel for the game and decision making on the floor was pivotal throughout the series and the game to win it"
"I certainly think all those teams expect to be fighting for a play in spot next season. I‚Äôm not saying no one wants him or will take him, but the days of potential trades consisting of players like Donavan Mitchell and Jaylen Brown are long fucking gone. I think it will be hard to find an acceptable trade."
imagine if the sixers had jaylen brown and jayson tatum instead of ben simmons and markelle fultz (RIP)   TRUST THE PROCESS
"Crazy to think that in that span 76ers hit big on Embiied and missed with Michael Carter/Nerlens Noel in the 2013 draft (could have had CJ Mccolllum, Giannis, Gobert), Elfrid Payton in the 2014 Draft (could have had Lavine or TJ Warren), Jhalil Okafor in the 2015 Draft (could have had Kristaps or Booker), Simmons in 2016 Draft (this may not be fair yet but could have had Jaylen Brown or Jamal Murray) and finally Fultz in the 2017 Draft (could have had Tatum or Fox).     Really is not fair to do that, because hindisght is 20:20 and at the time a lot of those picks lined up with conesensus expectations.  I also like to exclude Giannis because over half the nba passed on him but it's crazy to think Philly could trot out a starting 5 of:   PG: McCollum/Murray  SG:Booker  SF:Tatum  PF: Warren  C: Embiid"
Simmons was the consensus #1 pick. The only better player in the top 10 has been Jaylen Brown and he was considered a reach at #3 when the Celtics drafted him. Criticizing the Simmons pick is revisionist history at its worst.
"Idk you‚Äôre forgetting about guys like LaMelo, Fox, Ben Simmons, Bam, SGA, Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, MPJ, and Ja."
"I was only really looking at Jaylen BI and Simmons since the other 3 weren't in a top 5 discussion at the time (I also don't think anyone would take Sabonis over Simmons full stop). Me personally I would take Jaylen Brown 1st but there are many arguments for Simmons. He is clearly the best defender and the best passer of the bunch but he also clearly struggles on offense and has a Tony Allen-like effect on the offensive end.   He still has the best winshare/48 minutes in that draft, the highest VORP, etc. I think people overreact to one bad series. People assume everyone else will continue to up in skill while Simmons will continue to stay the same or decrease. He can still have a Julius Randle career where you start off well, stall off, then wake up and improve."
You‚Äôre not paying attention if you think jaylen brown played excellent on ball defense this year. He was not good at all. He‚Äôs regressed on that end hard since his offense went up
"Anthony Davis- Yes  Andrew Wiggins- No, but not terrible either  DeMarcus Cousins- Body broke down  Kevin Durant- Yes  Russell Westbrook- Yes  Kyrie Irving- Yes  Blake Griffin- Body broke down  Stephen Curry- Yes  Paul George- Yes  James Harden- Yes  Giannis Antetokounmpo- Yes  Klay Thompson- Yes but injured   Karl-Anthony Towns- Yes  Andre Drummond- No  Bradley Beal- Yes  John Wall- Body broke down  Deandre Jordan- No  Jahlil Okafor- No  Dragan Bender- lol   Jaylen Brown- Yes   ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-  Pretty good set of predictions all things said and done.   Among the players whom they predicted wrongly, 3/5 are centers who were negatively affected by small ball(Deandre Jordan, Drummond, Okafor). Worth noting that both Jordan and Drummond made the All-Star team, All-NBA, and led the league in rebounds   Wiggins is a solid starter and 2nd star. He can still make an All-Star game eventually, but he isn‚Äôt the perennial Star they predicted   Dragan Bender was a bust"
"Jaylen brown, taTum, Middleton, lavine, butler, hayward,klay, demar, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal murray, cj mcollum Are all better than him easily. Powell, Anthony Edwards, hield, mikal bridges, etc are arguably better."
Jaylen Brown  Jamal Murray  Brandon Ingram  Domantas Sabonis  Pascal Siakam
"So he's better than booker, bogdanovic, jaylen brown and will barton?"
"I have been on this sub fora while now, and I can remember every outrages take this sub made for Jaylen Brown and Tatum, and who r/nba thought was better then the two. It's just so fucking laughable now and it feels so fucking good to laugh back.  I can even link you post from Laker fans saying Kuzma, Ingram and Lonzo were better then the two, because they had more 30 point games. This sub at one time had Fox, and Levert better then Tatum. This is the same sub that clowned Jaylen for his contract."
Wasn't Trae pretty mediocre by his standards early in the season? Jaylen Brown was also playing out of his mind back then too
Celtics got the best player out of the four and a competent co-star in Jaylen Brown. It‚Äôs them obviously.
I thought they were but weren‚Äôt willing to give up Jaylen Brown. Which I never understood but ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"1. Celtics: They have both Jaylen Brown and Tatum. 2. Sixers: lost to the Hawks, but they still got Embiid.  3. Knicks: had a mediocre season where they made the playoffs and got beat in the first round, however, they really riled up New York, and this excitement can attract many stars, especially with their cap space 4. Raptors: Currently in a retool, having a lottery pick in what seems forever. They already got their chip, and are pretty much in a decline rn, this position can change based on how good their draft pick is."
Jaylen brown would be ideal
Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown would have dunked the shit out of that.
"Man, I was here when y'all were saying Nerlens Noel was worth Jaylen Brown and two first round picks.  I don't want to hear any of that shit from you guys."
Didn't know Jaylen changed his name to Al. But sure Ben for Al Brown it is. I'd add a 2nd. Round pick as well.
"Simmons was the consensus number one pick though, he had next lebron hype. He was clear cut over Ingram and if they took jaylen brown or jamal murray number one they get laughed out of the room  He had all the tools he just doesn‚Äôt give a shit about basketball"
"But that's the point. There's a fair bit of luck involved in the draft.  Look at the 2017 draft. How many of the guys in the top 10 have been worth their draft pick? Tatum and ... maybe that's it? Maybe Fox. Lonzo's probably earned a top 10 selection and but not a #2.   2018, 2/5 of the top five were clearly bad picks only 3 years later.   2016, Jaylen Brown - who was considered a reach by almost everyone at 3- is clearly the best pick of the top 10. At what draft position was the second-best player in the 2015 draft taken? 13?   You have to assume that you are going to miss on more of your top picks than you're going to hit on, because that's what EVERYBODY does.   It's true further down the draft. The Nuggets didn't know what they were getting with Jokic. The Warriors didn't know what they were getting at Draymond. In neither case if you asked the team, ""What's the best-case scenario for this guy?"" nobody in Denver would have said ""MVP"" and nobody at Golden State would have said, ""One of the best, most revolutionary defenders in the history of the league.""  Even Jerry West, who is regarded as one of the greatest draft basketball minds of all time, evidently was a huge advocate of Dion Waiters and wanted him to drop to the Warriors. (And speaking of 2012, the number of smart draft people who thought that MKG was going to be an all-world player was substantial. He went #2 over Damien Lillard, Bradley Beal, Kris Middleton, and Draymond Green among others).   If your strategy involve you hitting on multiple top draft picks, you have to understand that you have to get lucky and you have to expect to miss a bunch."
Yeah but if trading for Kyrie/Kemba was the right move then not trading for Kawhi was also the right move.  You can't ignore hindsight in one case and then bring up hindsight in another.   * The Kyrie/Kemba trades made sense at the time but were detrimental in hindsight.   * The Kawhi trade made no sense at the time but would have been hugely beneficial in hindsight.  The AD trade wouldn't have done much for us because it would have cost us Brown + Smart + picks as a bare minimum. Tatum and AD aren't winning a chip the way LeBron + AD did.  So now the only other trades we missed were Jaylen/Jayson for Paul George or Jimmy Butler and quite frankly I'd rather have Jaylen/Jayson.
2019?  You mean when the best player we sent was either Middleton or Jaylen Brown?
I was told for years he was better than Jaylen Brown.
"The Raptors won because GS lost both Klay and KD to injury, and the Raptors made the trade for 1 year of Kawhi because they weren't asked for anything remotely as valuable for Jaylen Brown.  If Boston trades Brown for Kawhi they still aren't favorites to win the title, because Golden State.   What other opportunities did they have? Trading Tatum for 1.5 years of AD?   Boston made their move when they got Kyrie and it didn't work."
"I'm sure you can do this for pretty much every team, but here are the players they missed out on during the Process era:  2013: Giannis  2015: Booker  2016: Jaylen Brown  2017: Jayson Tatum  2018: SGA, or keep Mikal Bridges"
"Imagine this sixers team with Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, or Jamal Murray"
"In the same timespan the Celtics, who have been said to be wasting their duo of 2 #3 picks in Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, have made three ECFs, and have a second round and first round exit the other two years."
Imagine if they drafted Ingram or Jaylen Brown
"In the same timespan the Celtics, who have been said to be wasting their duo of 2 #3 picks in Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, have made three ECFs, and have a second round and first round exit the other two years."
I remember I got downvoted for saying Jaylen brown is the best player in 2016 draft.
"I don‚Äôt want to ever hear that Ben Simmons is better then Jaylen Brown, this guy is a legit joke hinderance for his team living off his draft status."
Jaylen Brown as well
Years of history yes but Celtics claim that Jaylen Brown being an activist erases years of Boston fans being blatantly racist.
Thats my team since jaylen brown got hurt
"Ehh agree to disagree. I think a star is like Middleton, Murray, Jaylen Brown, Lavine etc. I wouldn‚Äôt put Ayton in that"
Mikal is underrated. Jaylen Brown-esque in that first Boston playoff run.
"Jaylen Brown was averaging 26 points, 6 rebounds and 4 assists on 60%TS.   He deserved to be an allstar.   The bucks were also only 1.5 games ahead of Boston at the time. Boston were 15-14 and Milwaukee were 17-13."
"The NBA and NFL are now providing education classes and seminars and it‚Äôs growing with programs with players like Jaylen Brown adding seminars through out the season. That‚Äôs all the NBA needs to do. I played div 1 football and they just threw us in the easiest classes for first year so we wouldn‚Äôt flunk out. Even the scholastic players were dissuaded from taking hard classes or classes in inconvenient hours. I‚Äôm a big proponent of continuing education for the sake of learning, but the ncaa and schools don‚Äôt give a fuck about you being a well rounded person."
He's a year older than Jaylen Brown.
Never forget it was a bonafide r/nba opinion that if you thought jaylen brown would be better than kuzma you were insufferable and ‚Äòneeded help‚Äô
"no, I think it has to do with this season being terrible for the health of the players in the league. Just look at the list of top players who have either missed time, were out completely or played through injury this playoffs:  - AD - Kawhi - Harden - Kyrie - Embiid - Jamal Murray - Conley - Mitchell - Jaylen Brown - Kemba  I'm probably missing some guys too, this is just off the top of my head. Not a good look for the league and not good for the quality of play, the teams left in the playoffs might look different if there weren't as many injuries."
"That‚Äôs an exaggeration though, right? I‚Äôve seen Jaylen Brown talked about more in r/nba than Kuzma. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs as popular as he was two years ago."
Didn't care about his college classes and hasn't improved since entering the NBA  Ben Simmons is the anti-Jaylen Brown
"Its great but honestly feel like the Nuggets with Murray are title contenders, Lakers w AD are title Contenders, Nets w stars are front runners for the chip, Kawhi would be the best player in the playoffs rn‚Ä¶shit even Jaylen Brown would have made the first nets series a lil interesting. Its good to see teams playing hard and new teams in the driver seat, but I personally wanna see the playoffs with some of the best players in the league actually playing with mostly healthy teams."
"Wtf is lamelo doing so high, he hasn‚Äôt proven shit and is higher than ayton and Jaylen brown? Lol"
"Shoutout to Jaylen Brown. For a guy who was so raw when he was drafted, the amount of work he's put into skill development is pretty incredible. Plus ""hard work"" is literally in his twitter handle"
"If you look at any individual injury sure, but the problem is the critical mass and accumulation of so many big players getting injured all in these playoffs. You can write off any one of Harden, Kyrie, Embiid, Lebron, AD, CP3, Kawhi, Mitchell, Conley, Jaylen Brown, Ibaka as ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt have been avoided anyways‚Äù but it‚Äôs all of them together where you see the problem."
"A super team Nets team needed an injured Jaylen Brown, an injured Kemba, an injured Robert Williams, and the refs in order to beat the Celtics. We can come up with hypotheticals all day long. Nets are going to probably lose Bruce Brown, Dinwiddie, and possibly Blake Griffin and Jeff Green in the off season. Also Kyrie Durant and Harden are getting up there in age and it‚Äôs no guarantee they will stay healthy. I think this was the Nets year to win it"
"Yes you‚Äôre correct. Even today‚Äôs game was entertaining to watch. Just saying we didn‚Äôt get to see Murray with the Nuggets, Jaylen brown, AD and Bron at full strength, and now Kawhi is injured"
"did you read what i said? no it's not. i'm white, and i cannot fully understand the experience jaylen brown has been through as a black person. and i never will, because i can never properly experience that.   that's not racist, that's being honest about the different ways black and white people experience america.  if you're claiming you are white and can connect with a black person just as well as another black person, you're the one being ignorant. how could you ever hope to fully understand what being black in america means?"
Jaylen Brown doesn‚Äôt move the needle enough
"imagine wanting an irish culture symbol to be black lol  come on man, there's racism for sure, players certainly suffered from that, what Ainge did was at the very least a trash statement and they should hire a black coach because the players already signaled they'd be more at ease by this decision, but this is so dumb  I can't fathom Jaylen Brown, as bright as that man is, would be pissed because the Boston CELTICS have an irish mascot which happens to be white due to cultural heritage.  Can you fucking imagine a ginger, black little guy wearing a green outfit, smoking a cigar?"
Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown for sure.
"Jaylen Brown can actually dribble, create his own shot, and play defense so I‚Äôd go with him."
"Jaylen Brown, Im biased but I fully believe in his growth, and he‚Äôs shown the ability identify his weaknesses, work on them and get better every single season.   MPJ‚Äôs back will always be a concern. He also benefits greatly by having the best facilitator in the NBA and MVP on his team giving him WIDE OPEN looks. Jaylen and Jayson ranked in the top 10 for hardest 3pt shots and at the rim shots suggesting they isolating they‚Äôre way to pts. Boston desperately needs a true facilitator. Also, MPJ has played as the third option in Denver and hasn‚Äôt been targeted like JB has. Off the court is no contest. Once an anti-Vaxxer and the other is Jaylen Brown. MPJ will be great in this league, but gimme Jaylen."
JB 100%. Jaylen Brown could be Pacers Paul George on his own team. MPJ is injury prone and doesn‚Äôt have a handle.
"""Never lived up to the billing, for whatever reason?"" This sounds like some revisionist history, let me refresh your memory.  2013-15: Rebuilding years, no expectations yet arguably exceeded them by making the playoffs in 2015 in a weak eastern conference.   2015-16: Lost to 4th seeded Atlanta hawks in the first round as the 5th seed. One of ONLY two teams to beat the Warriors at home this year. In fact, was the team to break their NBA record 54 game home winning streak. Both games with the NBA best warriors that year were highly competitive with the first being a double OT loss at home. Arguably no other team was as competitive with the warriors this season and Celtics would continue to be one of the most competitive teams with the warriors in the next couple seasons. (this is objectively the definition of not meeting but exceeding your billing)  2016-17: Lost in the conference finals as the one seed to the Lebron James led cavaliers, something James has a history of doing to top seeds. Went down to Chicago 0-2 AT HOME in the first round but after Brad Stevens made the decision to bench Amir Johnson in favor of Gerald Green the Celtics went on to win four straight. Three of which were in Chicago. Great coaching decision led to a series win.  2017-18: Acquired Gordon Hayward and Kyrie (via trade) and lost Hayward on DAY ONE of the season, and Kyrie later that season. Still took the cavs to seven games and eventually lost. Cavs would get swept by the dubs. Celtics split the season series with the Warriors and steph curry remarked ""It's looking very, very likely right now"" as to answer a question asking if they would see the Celtics in the finals. This was Jayson Tatum's first season and Brown's second, yet still made it very far without Kyrie at the end and Gordon for the entire year spare for a few minutes.  2018-19: Highly dysfunctional team with logjams at multiple positions. However, I do NOT pin this on Brad. As a Celtics fan I will never forgive Danny Ainge for being a giant pussy and not making a big trade this year. We had the assets and the NEED to given the crowded roster and he didn't do shit.   2019-20: Lost to Miami Heat in conference finals. Could not figure out Miami's zone. I'll give you this year. Kemba totally sucked all playoffs but still should have beaten the Heat.  2020-21: Celtics led the league in games missed due to Covid protocol. On top of that injuries to Marcus Smart, Kemba Walker (who never played back to backs and missed many other games), and eventually a season ending one to Jaylen Brown never allowed the team to gain any continuity. Celtics lost in the first round to arguably the most talented team ever assembled in the Brooklyn Nets.   Even if you blame Brad partially for this past season that's stil only 1.5 out of 8 seasons in which they didn't live up to the hype. To say his teams ""never"" lived up to the billing is just incorrect. I spent way more time on this than I should have"
"This post is disgusting üòÇ the Celtics gonna trade for Donovan Mitchell without attaching Jaylen brown, the Knicks are gonna offer some low ceiling rookies just bc they peaked early, ditto for the Spurs, and my favorite of all is the overall theme of just adding  ‚Äúpicks‚Äù to anything like that apparently makes it appealing. Yll are delusional"
"I think the Celtics main issue was that the Nets had Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden all playing while the Celtics were missing Jaylen Brown. Was Tatum not showing enough competitive spirit when he scored 50 points in a playoff game?"
Probably the only players on that list. Kemba is a no and Marcus Smart won't make the Olympic team. Nobody else was that good.  (Unless Jaylen Brown was on the team but he's hurt anyways)
"When have you seen a postseason where almost every team in both conference dealt with injuries to their stars. Lakers- James, AD, Nuggets- Jamal Murray, Clippers- Kawhi, Brooklyn- Harden, Washington- Beal was hurt, Jazz- Spida, Celtics- Jaylen Brown. Sixers- Joel Embiid, Hawks- Trae Young"
"That's Jaylen ""Michael Jordan"" Brown to you."

"Jaylen Brown wasnt the best player on the celtics in 2018 come on they had Kyrie, Tatum and Horford"
Michael Porter over Jaylen Brown is a truly embarrassing take
jaylen brown
Jaylen Brown wasn‚Äôt even the second best player on his team until like 10am this morning.
"Devin Booker is the best player on a team that beat the defending champs and swept the mvp, jaylen brown is the second best player on a 7th seed"
"Imagine Curry and Jaylen Brown backcourt, that would be the sickest"
"Damian Lillard would make the Celtics instant contenders. Also who the fuck cares he's 31, he's Damian Lillard. He will better than whatever player Jaylen Brown will turn into"
If the Celtics are serious about wanting to win a title Jaylen Brown should not be off any table for Dame Lillard.
Kawhi? Now that‚Äôs a stretch. He‚Äôs more like OG or Jaylen Brown
"All he is right now is an elite NBA body. We don‚Äôt know how his skills will develop, but he‚Äôs got the body to be an elite player. It‚Äôs all about potential. I liked his BBIQ tho he‚Äôs a really decent playmaker and with his frame can be a great defender. He‚Äôs very mobile and agile and moves his feet well on defence.   He‚Äôs 6-8 220 pounds at 18 years old. That‚Äôs literally the only reason he‚Äôll be a high draft pick.   Imo, he can develop to be OG Anunoby, or even Jaylen Brown"
"ya but if you pick a guy with this level of athleticism and they‚Äôre willing to learn and work hard, a competent professional organization can develop them into something special. that‚Äôs what happened with giannis and jaylen brown for example"
"jaylen brown was pretty raw coming out of Cal, i think they‚Äôre pretty similar as prospects at this point in time"
You know how I Know you didn't read this article because jaylen brown is one off the all-stars they talk about
Jaylen Brown is an all star tho
Jaylen Brown as well
Jaylen Brown when going for a layup?
"&gt; so devin booker and jaylen brown at 58% ts% are just ever so slightly above average?  Literally yes  &gt; .573 is good for guards, especially considering his 34% usage%  I'm not convinced taking the ball out of Sexton's hands will make him more efficient, given his shot selection"
"Has always been since teams these days switch everything, which is why Jaylen Brown is such a terrible defender despite being average at on-ball defense. Boston's defense sucked this year because Kemba and Jaylen were major defensive liabilities and it's impossible to hide two players on the court, in addition to Smart's defense getting worse."
"But why would they do that? I bet they can get Jaylen Brown and Smart for Dame, isn't it way way better than Simmons?"
"This is a terrible stat and has such a small sample that it should be absolutely ignored. How many possessions do you think any individual player defends in isolation against any other player? And it completely ignores how a player fits into an overall team defense. Jaylen Brown for instance is a good post defender, but a truly awful defensive player overall when his inability to defend in a team concept is taken into account."
"Jaylen Brown comes off as intelligent to me, but I'm more calling you out for saying dumb things with flawed arguments than defending Jaylen Brown lol"
Jaylen Brown doesn‚Äôt exist?
"Why are you trying so hard to shoe horn politics into this conversation?  All anyone has said is he seems to be very emotionally and interpersonally intelligent and giving the example of him advocating for STEM education  No one is talking about education reform or racial equality except for you trying to force it into the conversation after trying suspiciously hard to minimize Brown's intelligence just because he's rich (and I'm betting there's another reason because you're trying so hard to force conservative talking points in this conversation)  You're also trying extremely hard to make this conversation black and white. No one said either of these things:  &gt;Is that to imply everyone who doesnt promote social equality is dumb?  &gt;Is being socially aware the litmus test for intelligence these days?  I'm not quite sure where you are getting those ideas when it's obvious anyone is trying to tell you that there are multiple different aspects of intelligence and that Jaylen Brown's **actions** comes off as being highly intelligent, which you continue to ignore  Jaylen Brown is a VP in the NBPA as well as continuously promoting the importance of education and is extremely well spoken in interviews. For some reason you want to dismiss all of these things and just chalk it up to being rich, somehow, between the two of you, I'm betting one of you is low on emotional and social intelligence, and it's not Jaylen Brown."
"The guy your responding to is a real life meme. Every post on his profile is about Jaylen Brown being terrible. r/bostonceltics even has a copypasta about him (all real things he‚Äôs said).  &gt;u/devic3: As an honest Jaylen Brown fan I must admit that he deserves to be traded for Norman Powell. If we must, we should throw in a pick as well. Not only that but Jaylen is worthless and his 40 point games are all flukes. If Tatum and Jaylen are stars, why aren‚Äôt the Celtics winn- oh shit they are- the Celtics are only winning because of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown is doing nothing. The Green Teamers will disagree but you know it‚Äôs true, Jaylen is not a good player. Remember, all this is coming from an honest fan. Me, u/devic3."
"Jaylen Brown. It's literally better to play 4 vs. 5 than to have Jaylen on the team because his defense is so bad, and on offense he's a ballhog."
He went to uc Berkely and has frequently spoken out about the importance of education. Like it‚Äôs the one of the only things I ever hear about him caring about besides basketball   https://celticswire.usatoday.com/2020/12/01/nba-boston-celtics-jaylen-brown-nasa-talk/
Yea my bad I mean Jaylen Brown. And Trae was more sure fire because he did something nobody ever did in the NCAA. And that was lead D1 basketball in scoring and assists in the same season. And he did it as a freshman. Trae was considered hit or miss because of his size like I pointed out to you before üòÇ. But as a basketball player he was great offensively. Jimmer was strictly a shooter and was a senior
"There are no sure fire bets. I assume you meant Jaylen Brown, since we're talking about Green.  Trae wasn't even sure fire just because he was great offensively in college, cause then Jimmer Fredette would be all nba."
So we just gonna skip over game 7 in 2018 where Giannis didn't show up against a hobbled Celtics team with no Kyrie and Jaylen Brown getting injured mid game? What about in 2019 where they lost 4 in a row to the Raptors after being up 2-0? What about last year against Miami? Giannis has a pretty questionable track record in the playoffs as well so it's a bit rich to hear any Bucks fan talk about anyone else in the playoffs.
Jaylen brown loses his man off ball way too often to be a good defender.
Jaylen Brown as well
"you are of course right re. blame and responsibility for following protocols - all of that is ultimately on the individual, and unless some insider dishes on a name-by-name basis, it's just unfair speculation (i.e., fallacy that all those who followed/didn't follow protocols were/weren't infected).  but as a classic cynical celtics fan, the problem with the org has ultimately been that the front office has been too fucking crafty in acquiring that ""third superstar"" and consequently disrespecting the GENERATIONAL talent combo of jaylen and jayson. danny has this predilection for undersized guards because he was one, and it screws the trade value of acquiring quality roleplayers to complement our superstars' skills. no one should be getting paid more than them.   this is a fucking essay and a half but i'm just chomping at the bit to give context lol.  stevens got clout for taking rag-tag players and skyrocketing their value by playing them properly in min-max situations (isaiah thomas is on the floor no matter how shit his defense). as far as i'm concerned, danny kept wasting that net growth in value on the next ""superstar guard"" (kyrie, kemba), which is fucked up considering how ace the celtics front office was in doing the tatum pick and giving brown that payday."
Jaylen brown?
"This is legit the biggest asterisk year ever though. No playoffs ever have had this crazy an amount of injuries. Harden, Kawhi, Kyrie, AD, LeBron, CP3 partially, Jaylen Brown, Embiid (maybe), Jamal Murray, and all the starters who are out."
You‚Äôd trade Jaylen Brown for either? Hunh. Didn‚Äôt expect that
"As an honest Mavericks fan I‚Äôm taking Jaylen Brown over Luka any day of the week. It‚Äôs sad to admit but Luka just is not that guy pal. As someone who‚Äôs absolutely watched all of his games I feel Luka‚Äôs just not good enough, especially in the playoffs. Luka is honestly not good in anyway. In fact, as a Mavs fan I‚Äôd trade him for a player with heart, like Tremont Waters!"
"I feel like the same situation applies to the Celtics. Brand new GM with no experience, brand new head coach with no experience and two young stars. If Brad Stevens and Ime Udoka turn out to not be very good at their jobs then the heat there is gonna get turned up real quick with Jaylen Brown extension eligible in two years."
"Boston lost to Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson because Spoelstra is so much better than Brad Stevens and Jaylen Brown was and still is the worst defender in the NBA. Credit to the Heat but Tatum deserved better from his team, we shouldn't have lost that series."
"Due to the shortened offseason, teams can trade recently-acquired players just 19 days after acquiring them.   **I am aware that the following would never happen. I just got a kick out of thinking about it and wanted to share.**  Imagine if Brad Stevens decides to blow it up and does this in a few weeks:   Thunder get:   * Jaylen Brown  * Jayson Tatum  Celtics get:   * Kemba Walker  * Luguentz Dort  * Theo Maledon  * Aleksej Pokusevski  * 13 1sts (the max OKC can send at this point)   Celtics basically inherit the OKC rebuild, minus Shai. Meanwhile OKC now goes forward with Shai/Brown/Tatum/Bazley/Bradley. I'm sure they could improve with free agent signings or other trades, too."
"I've noticed that the only time I get really annoyed with Marv is when the game I'm watching is already annoying me or not going my way. Fucking Jaylen Brown takes a long contested-two, no time on the clock, literally both feet in front of the line and drains it. ""THREE POINTS FROM BROWN""  Like fuck off no it wasn't"
"There are a lot of young Black players like Jerami Grant &amp; Jaylen Brown who openly talk about wanting to be a part of an organization that values them as human beings, not just players. And guys like Jerami talk about how they want to be in Detroit because we have a Black GM &amp; Black Head Coach, and play in a Black city. We even have all Black beat writers.   Also, what has changed is that the franchise moved operations from Auburn Hills (a suburb with absolutely nothing around the stadium) to Downtown Detroit (which is buzzing with all major sports teams within walking distance and a robust food/music/art scene).   This is a new world. I don't anticipate someone like Lebron coming here. But a guy like Jaylen Brown wanting to be in Detroit? I could see it."
"Green teamers often compare the Celtics to the Clippers. The difference is that Jaylen Brown would be sitting at the end of the bench in LA. Reggie Jackson is so much better than Jaylen, it's sad at this point."

"Embiid is good enough to be the #1 guy on a contender.  Jaylen Brown would be a low-quality #2 guy, or good-quality #3 guy on a contender.  If you replaced Simmons in that Atlanta series with almost any other #2 guy from a healthy playoff team, Philly would still be playing right now."
Not as cute a couple as Donovan Mitchell and Jaylen Brown.  I miss those bubble moments.  I wish those two could play together sometime.  Imagine Brown on the Jazz to help Mitchell.
"We lost in the last world cup, because that team barely had any chemistry plus if we're being honest the team wasn't good with Baby Jaylen Brown and Kemba chucking games away + tatum injured. Even though the talent isn't as much, the chemistry is much stronger compared to that world cup roster. These are nba players btw, who are much better than any other league, and those players from other leagues are the main proponents of literally every single nation other than the US/canada. Therefore they'd easily get a gold, it isn't that hard to understand."
fun fact:  Terance Mann is older than Jaylen Brown
"there is a new kobe in the league, he is in Boston, his name is jaylen brown. He let's work ethic do the talking like kobe"
"I think they just wanted another big body.  Last US team was Plumlee so I guess it's better than that.  I don't even know which American big is more deserving.  I know people are suggesting Myles Turner, but he was ass in 2019.  He was so bad, that they put in Jaylen Brown at the 5 to guard France's centers.  Useless on both ends."
Jaylen brown
CJ and what for Jaylen Brown
Just like Jaylen Brown is better than Trae Young. See I can make stupid assertions too.
Jaylen Brown is severely underpaid. I‚Äôm thinking a Bertrans/Joe Harris type contract.
Nobody is paying Reggie Jackson anywhere close to what Jaylen Brown makes
"I fully agree that CJ is much better than Smart, in my scenario Smart would have to go to make room for the 2022 FA class.   The big difference between DLo to GS and CJ potentially coming here is that the Warriors core had already won. There wasn‚Äôt the pressure to win now or lose their stars that we could potentially be facing. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt want CJ. Even if he is the 3rd guy I‚Äôm not sure if Jaylen isn‚Äôt a 3rd guy as well. That still puts us in the ECF at best.   Im willing to take the risk in 2022 on Beal or Lavine vs running with Tatum, Brown, and CJ. If Tatum and Beal are as tight as reported we should have a good idea by the end of the offseason if that move gels with both sides."
I remember a ton of people calling jaylen brown Stanley Johnson 2.0
"He‚Äôs a thoroughly pedestrian shooter, 44/34/89 58.9 TS% who jacks up 3-4 35 footers per game. He has an atrocious defensive rating 116.1. He‚Äôs an elite playmaker, but that doesn‚Äôt make him top 15.  Specifically, your list is missing Mitchell, Harden, Kyrie at least, and I‚Äôd personally put PG, Beal, Westbrook, Zion and CP above him. You can even make a case for putting Fox, Booker, Lavine, and Jaylen Brown in his class or above him. And Gobert isn‚Äôt a good comp but he‚Äôs a top 25 player, so throw his name in the mix.  I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs safely top 30, and maybe top 20-25."
It was mostly trolling but back when Jaylen Brown and Osman signed their extensions I used to bring up their production (pretty similar at the time) compared to their new salaries ($30m/4y vs. $105m/4y).
Jaylen Brown
"How about a Beasley, Rubio, 2 lottery protected firsts for Jaylen Brown trade? You get a top ten shooter and a good facilitating PG and some draft capital. We get to run a lineup of DLo Ant Brown McDaniels and Towns. If y‚Äôall wanted more I‚Äôd understand."
ok. but what was the plan? and how was sitting out better than what Jaylen Brown did in the bubble for social justice for example?
all homie said is jaylen brown is the only player worth trading  for and even then called it something that could never happen then you right that condescending ass comment
Brown would be way too steep in a league where two-way wings are the most valuable commodity.   I think the only player (who might realistically end up on the trade market) that Brad would trade Jaylen for is Towns.
Not youth at a premium but a factor more so play style. Example being Brandon Ingram or jaylen brown in my mind are first option scorers where as gobert is a defensive stalwart so I‚Äôd take those younger guys not necessarily because age but because their games can evolve more. Whereas with Zion I‚Äôd be hard pressed to say I‚Äôd rather have him right NOW because idk how his game will translate to playoff basketball yet and long term health so if I wanted to win now I‚Äôd take gobert over Zion even though Zion is probably better than all 3 guys mentioned long term.
"Although I don‚Äôt know that the Pistons trade Cade for a lot of them. For a team a long way out from competing it doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense to trade the number 1 pick who you have years of control over, a lot of them on a rookie deal where he‚Äôs ideally extremely discounted, for someone who is either already off their rookie deal or close to it. A good example is Jaylen Brown who may be worth more in a vacuum but would only be in Detroit for a few years before he‚Äôd be able to walk."
"I mean people ridiculed the Jaylen Brown contract. He's outperformed his contract for sure, but he wasn't seen as a sure thing like Simmons/Embiid/Tatum.  Simmons and Tatum have the same contract, Tatum just missed All-NBA to elevate it."
"I mean Brown over Trae isn't absurd. You can easily make an argument either way. Jaylen was lighting it up for Boston while Tatum was out and recovering from COVID.   Also, there was only like 25 games played when all star voting ended. I'm sure there were plenty of teams ""game planning to stop Jaylen Brown"", which isn't really how people vote for all stars anyway."
"Which of the east guards would you remove to put in Trae?  Keep in mind this was a halfway through the regular season award. I can see arguments of him over Kyrie, Ben Simmons and Jaylen Brown, but I can easily see any of those guys over Trae too.  Kyrie was averaging 27 with ridiculous efficiency. Jaylen was doing 24-25 with great defense, and Ben Simmons was at 15/7/7 and was in conversation for DPOY.  ""Horrifically snubbed"" implies someone much worse got into the all-star game while he was left out. I don't really think that was the case. Every east guard was plenty deserving."
He should be in over vuc and Lavine at least.  Not to mention who is ‚Äúgame planning to stop jaylen brown?‚Äù
"Jaylen Brown as well, Conley on the Jazz, Donovan Mitchell was clearly playing hurt. Oladipo on the Heat."
"15 players according to Bobby Marks, Kevin Pelton, and Mike Schmitz of ESPN this year. Here are the 15 players they‚Äôd take ahead of Trae:  1. Luka Doncic 2. Zion Williamson 3. LaMelo Ball 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jayson Tatum 6. De‚ÄôAaron Fox 7. Ben Simmons 8. Devin Booker 9. Bam Adebayo 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Brandon Ingram 12. Jaylen Brown 13. Jamal Murray 14. Michael Porter Jr. 15. Ja Morant"
"Jaylen Brown doesn't turn into a pumpkin in the fourth quarter. If you had Brown instead of Simmons, you might not have lost against the Hawks."
"trae was uhh.. doing most of the same stuff back then man  like the team wasnt as good but idk. love u jaylen brown but like.. nobody game planning around ""how do we stop jaylen""  and the ben simmons thing idk i dont gotta touch on that lol"
"This does appear to be a personality problem and less an AAU pampered problem, Jaylen Brown got picked 2 picks later, was also in the AAU circuit but he's actually a ""I need to go to the gym and get better"" personality. Its all on Ben himself."
"I think that racism can manifest in many different ways. For example, segregation. If you look at the racial breakdown of neighborhoods, and correlate that to aggregate family wealth, the numbers are staggering. Also, Boston is a very cliquey place. This creates a division of social circles, which exacerbates the issue of segregation, as it goes from where you live to who you associate with. A lot of Boston is made up of moderately wealthy young adults, and the suburbs are a lot of older-thinking townies who are your classic racists: the n word saying people who don‚Äôt like interracial relationships. Those people tend to be the ones at games, ergo the behavior exhibited at times (see Marcus Smart). I can bet you a million bucks the lady who called Marcus the n word was a suburban dwelling, moderately wealthy person. The racist behaviors in Boston are so meshed with class/wealth/social status, that the overt nature of racism doesn‚Äôt need to be displayed in order for it to have an effect on Bostonians of color.   You‚Äôre right: every major city in the US has these same issues. And Boston shouldn‚Äôt be held up as the only place who has these issues, but it‚Äôs always important to point out. I think Jaylen had the best comments about this when asked after Kyrie‚Äôs dig:  https://www.celticsblog.com/2021/5/28/22459234/jaylen-brown-boston-celtics-brooklyn-nets-kyrie-irving-marcus-smart-danny-ainge-racism  A lot of this ‚ÄúBoston is so racist!‚Äù Stuff ends up diluting the actual conversation, because it gets into a back and forth about who lives in a more racist place, which is absolutely bizarre."
You think Portland is gonna trade dame somewhere he doesn‚Äôt want to go. No chance the organization fucks him like that.   So what can any of those teams offer that‚Äôs better than Simmons. Let‚Äôs hear it. And dame wouldn‚Äôt want to go the knicks Pelicans and hawks and none of those other teams have good offers.   Best I could see is someone like jaylen brown but he‚Äôs not signvicantly better than Simmons.
I'm still confused. Jaylen brown who was drafted in 2016?
Lol at thinking Jaylen Brown would ever play for Carlisle.  He said he wanted a black coach.  He posted that analytics say hiring a black coach increases their chance of success given the fact 4 out of 7 coaches left in the playoffs at the time were black.
Gotchu bro.  Jaylen ‚ÄúWorst Starter in the League‚Äù Brown
"I mean, almost every NBA team has significant injuries.  The Bucks faces the Nets with injuries to Kyrie and Harden.  Hawks beat the 76ers with an injured Embiid. Nets beat the Celtics without Boston having Jaylen Brown.  Suns just beat a Leonard-less Clippers twice, while missing their own CP3.  The oddity isn't the Suns - it's the number of high profile injuries across the league."
"If he was taking at 3rd and Embiid was taken at 1st I think he'd have way less of the bust reputation. He's now in his prime and has become a 20/5/3 player with good defense and decent shooting splits. Easily the second best player in the top 10 from 2014 and easily the third best in the lottery from that year (Lavine is higher).   Past 10 3rd overall picks: Kanter, Beal, Otto Porter, ""Wiggins"" for the sake of discussion, Okafor, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Luka, RJ, Lamelo. Wiggins belongs right in the middle of those guys."
Should I just get ahead of it &amp; comment Jaylen ‚ÄúWorst Starter in the League‚Äù Brown for him?
Jaylen Brown definitely approves
"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs disrespectful of the media as you imply. It‚Äôs just the fact that the vast majority of teams outside of Atl and Mil have experienced injuries. The absence of stars in a star-centric league is objectively bad and decreases the excitement of the playoffs.   Lebron and AD were hurt, CP3 is sick, Embiid was banged up, Harden and Kyrie were hurt, jamaal Murray was hurt, Mitchell and Conley were hurt, Kawhi is hurt, Jaylen Brown was hurt, Warriors roster was decimated by injuries  I sincerely don‚Äôt mean this in a disrespectful way whatsoever because what the suns have achieved is remarkable and praiseworthy. But, the teams remaining in the playoffs are clearly not the best teams in the NBA. It‚Äôs no knock on them Bc you can‚Äôt control who you play, but all the best teams had injuries that prevented them from performing at their highest.   While I love watching basketball, I‚Äôd be lying if I said I would rather watch suns bucks than a Lebron v. KD showdown in the finals"
"Also at this point there is no way on earth the Celtics trade Jaylen Brown for Ben Simmons unless several FRPs are coming from the 6ers. Jaylen is a proven playoff performer who has gotten markedly better every year in the league, and Simmons is the opposite of what I just said. Also Jaylen's on a way better contract."
I‚Äôm the Jaylen Brown EG. Future MVP and president of the United States.
"&gt; Jaylen Brown  &gt; Bam Adebayo  &gt; Klay Thompson  &gt; DeAndre Ayton  &gt; Ja Morant  All of these guys are very good defenders outside of Morant, but his offense more than makes up for it.  Look dude you got shown up and proven wrong, just take the L and say thanks for the education. Idk why that's so hard on this sub ha"
"Probably #1, certainly no worse than #2.   With all of the other guys, there's a chance that they won't be able to actually do it at the NBA level. Not a large one, but it happens non-trivially often.   Furthermore, even if they CAN do it at the NBA level, there's very little confidence that they'll be better than Jaylen.   Let's go through the last 20 #1 picks and count how many you would rather have than Jaylen Brown:   Yes:  Zion, AD, Rose, Dwight, LeBron,  No:  Edwards, Fultz, Simmons, Wiggins, Bennet, Oden, Bargnani, Yao, Kwame, Kenyon  Unclear:  KAT, Kyrie, Wall, Blake, Bogut  You might quibble with one or two of my placements. The important thing is that they're broadly correct. (It's not clear that Zion, for example, belongs in the better group - if his body breaks down, which seems like a real risk, then he'll be a ""no."" I tend to think Rose is a little overrated and didn't deserve his MVP, so you could knock him down, too: it seems likely that when all is said and done Jaylen will have the better career. Blake could maybe be a ""yes"".)   In other words: with the #1 pick, you're twice as likely to get a player who is clearly worse than Jaylen Brown than you are a player who is clearly better.   Furthermore, I think it's even worse than that, because every so often there's a holy-shit, can't-miss prospect. LeBron, AD, and Zion were players who everyone knew were special long before they were drafted. I know we get all hyped about some young player and ""fade for Cade"" but there's a difference. (That kind of hype isn't a guarantee, either: I think Blake and Wall had similar levels of hype although even at the time I was skeptical about Wall's hype, and Blake was dealing with injuries when he was drafted, IIRC. OTOH, Simmons was hyped similarly, too with those guys, too - but LeBron, AD, and Zion were something else).   There's a real chance that Cade ends up a better player, absolutely. But there's also a chance that Cade ends up much worse."
Same I want Green as well I don‚Äôt think ppl actually realize how good that kid is gonna be mannn (his floor is Jaylen Brown type production imo at minimum and his ceiling could be crazy) I see a lot of Zach Lavine in him. KPJ Green and wood are a phenomenal young core to structure this rebuild around and they have a great young supporting cast as well in Tate and Marin Jr
No shit no one is saying Jaylen Brown is Devin Booker lol read my comment again that‚Äôs one of the dumbest trades I‚Äôve ever seen in my life
If Jaylen Brown was in the draft right now he'd go number 1. This ain't the Zion draft or the AD draft.
"Suggs could be anything, he could even be a Jaylen Brown!"
If I'm Detroit. I would want to watch Cade for 8+ years instead of Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown as in the same dude who was putting up almost Devin Booker type numbers in the regular season.....literally had a career year for y‚Äôall lol
"Jaylen Brown might be the most overrated player in the history of the NBA. I have never seen a player who is putting up 24/6/3 with negative impact on the court, but Jaylen is exactly that. He does nothing for his teammates offensive and his defense is worse than non-existent."
"Horford playing at whatever level is better than Kemba on the bench every playoffs.  Addition by subtraction is the wrong term for it, but him constantly being unavailable when we need him is as much a waste of a max contact slot as you can get. It's better to spend that money on a big man that will more likely be available and that already has good chemistry with the team.  I think Kemba isn't shit, but he isn't as good as his numbers indicate. He was only really good for about a month, during which he embraced playmaking and opening the floor up for others, but also got his buckets in a relatively efficient manner. Beyond that, 55%TS is nothing to be proud of lol, his efficiency was wank for most of the season, and it was even worse in the playoffs (same as last season).. Jaylen Brown has a higher efficiency despite taking more shots, and more difficult shots, and struggling to clear 75% from the free throw line. Shit, Marcus smart is one of the most notoriously inefficient guys in the league and he constantly gets clowned for it but he's like a 53%TS, just slightly lower than Kemba."
Jae Crowder &gt;&gt;&gt; Jaylen Brown
The same pick Jaylen Brown got picked. They don‚Äôt call him Michael ‚ÄúJaylen Brown‚Äù Jordan for nothing.
"Username checks out.  According to DBPM, Nikola Jokic is the 6th best defender in the league. And Luka Doncic is a better defender than guys like paul george, richuan holmes, capela, and smart. And Duncan Robinson is a better defender than Lugentz Dort and Jaylen Brown."
"Can already hear Adam Silver ""with the 4th pick in the 2021 draft, the Toronto raptors select Jaylen Brown from the Boston Celtics""  That dude will be a lock for ROTY."

"Yeah he‚Äôs a terrible GM. Selecting trash players like Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams, Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Avery Bradley, etc.  What a stupid comment"

"Last season:  **Jaylen Brown:** 24.7/6.0/3.4/1.2/0.6 on 48/40/76 shooting.   **Ben Simmons:** 15.9/8/1/7.7/1.6/0.6 on 56/30(lol)/61 shooting.   My guy, I'm not sure this is an argument you want to be making."
"I'm assuming Brown will be significantly better defensively while taking minor offensive steps that significantly outweighs the age difference. Not only that but you said Jaylen does not show flashes. Beal at 24 dropped 30+ 15 times, Jaylen did it 11 times on a shortened, unhealthy season compared to Beal doing it on an 82 game season"
Jaylen Brown is 2.6% better without free throws. Foul baiters are gonna take a massive hit next season with significant rule changes. Whats so hard to understand about that?
"You heard of Jabari Bird? Dude lost his entire career for a ‚Äúdomestic disturbance‚Äù (i.e. he beat and choked his gf during a psychotic episode).   Just signed his contract with the Cs, was friends with Jaylen Brown from college and then in one horrible event he seriously hurt someone he supposedly loved, got charged with criminal assault, and then his career was terminated.   Hayes is much higher profile, but if the ‚Äòdomestic disturbance‚Äô part turns out bad then this could be very serious. Brown was assaulted by cops due to very obvious racial profiling, he then successfully sued the city. Not sure Hayes is going to get that outcome here."

ahahaha it's the guy that thinks Jaylen Brown is Michael Jordan !!
"Ahahaha you again, the one who thinks Jaylen Brown is Michael Jordan.. you're one funny guy man"
Dudes a 24 year old 25ppg scorer. I really don't get the Jaylen Brown slander. He's made huge jumps in his time in the league. It's not worth giving him up for 1 year of Beal.
"&amp;#x200B;  lmao, this how celtics fans see jaylen brown:  &amp;#x200B;  https://imgur.com/gallery/JqvaqTX"
If they aren‚Äôt giving up Jaylen Brown then they might as well try to sign him next year.
"If you're not giving up Jaylen Brown, how would you outbid teams like Philly, Miami, and Golden State? Y'all dont even have a first this year to offer."
"Beal is a better overall scorer and creates better for himself and team mates. Jaylen is really good, but he is no where near the iso scorer Beal is. The Celtics rely on a lot of Iso scoring with Tatum and Brown. I'd rather have Beal doing that then Jaylen."
"Why is there a need for that restriction? Lol. You can‚Äôt take it that the USA is just better overall. Plus, who could go against this kind of lineup:  PG: Trae Young, Jalen Suggs SG: Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown SF: Jayson Tatum, Mikal Bridges, Trey Murphy PF: Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis C: Evan Mobley, Myles Turner   Show me an all Euro lineup under 30 that‚Äôs better than all those all stars lol"
&gt;  with an injured Jaylen Brown.  What injury?  He had a non-shooting hand injury that will be cleared up before camp.
"Tatum will take a leap and lead the Celtics to a 2nd seed, with an injured Jaylen Brown."
"Sure!  1. Adrian Dantley 2. Alex English 3. Wilkins 4. Kidd 5. Melo 6. Pau Gasol 7. Tony Parker 8. Chris Mullin 9. Mitch Redmond 10. Webber 11. Penny Hardaway 12. Brandon Roy 13. David West 14.

"Y‚Äôall remember when the Celtics were absolutely clowned on for picking Jaylen Brown instead of Dunn? No? Didn‚Äôt think so. Everyone laughed at the Celtics for picking Brown 3rd. In a redraft, I‚Äôm probably taking Brown first. Ingram is the only other player I‚Äôd consider with the first pick in that draft."
Jaylen Brown is a better 3 point shooter than Larry Bird
"You think half these guys have a shot at that?   Most of these guys are dumb as shit outside of basketball. There's smart guys like Jaylen Brown, CJ, Brogdan, Cam Johnson, Gasol bros and so on.  There's more guys with the same brain cells as Terry Rozier in the league though who can barely read a book."
Celtics Dunn fucked up!! Imagine if they drafted Jaylen Brown üòÇ
"https://www.nba.com/stats/players/bio/?sort=PLAYER\_HEIGHT\_INCHES&amp;dir=1  It's definitely a shorter team than this, though it's hard to find interior defense.      I think I'd go with the 6'7 team, would be impossible to stop with that much shooting around Luka and Butler, Kawhi and one of Zion or Anunoby at the 5 could probably do okay at the 5.  6'9 team - Not enough shooting, but Siakam might be able to guard 1s okay and if he can the D should be quite good.  Adebayo - Siakam - John Collins - Kyle Anderson - Lebron   6'8 team - little light on playmaking but Okongwu looked like a decent center   Okongwu-Tobias Harris - Paul George- Tatum - Ingles   6'7 team - Light on interior D, but tons of skill and a proper PG to run the O  Zion/OG - Jimmy Butler - Kawhi - Middleton - Luka Doncic  6'6 team seems too light   Draymond Green - Mikal Bridges - Jaylen Brown - Shai Gilgeous Alexander - Lamelo Ball"
"My 6‚Äô6‚Äù Line up can run with anybody PG - Zach LaVine, SG - Klay Thompson, SF - Jaylen Brown, PF - DeMar DeRozen, C - Draymond Green"
"Yeah this was a killer draft for the C's. Jaylen Brown, a future 1st that turned into multiple players and picks - I believe the 2nds we got from the eventual trade downs from the LAC 1st from MEM was used to trade for Evan Fournier - and like you said Zizic being drafted to be apart of the Kyrie trade."
"Getting Jaylen Brown and an asset needed for the Kyrie trade to happen, this was a good draft for the C's. Kyrie didn't work out, but it's not too often you get 2 all-stars out of your draft assets."
The point that Brown ‚Äúscores at a high level‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean anything. Beal is a better offensive player than Jaylen at this point. Beal also doesn‚Äôt need to be the first option either. He performed very well when Wall was the first option and primary ball handler for years. You should check out Beal‚Äôs playoff performances during that time.  The argument that a team can‚Äôt win a championship with Beal as their top scorer doesn‚Äôt make any sense when you also can‚Äôt win a championship with Jaylen Brown as your top scorer.
Jaylen Brown and that‚Äôs pretty much it. He‚Äôs good af but we‚Äôve sucked since he left.
"Duncan Robinson.   And then next offseason trade him, Kira, and picks to Boston for Jaylen Brown, my baseless pick for the inevitable star that gets disgruntled and asks out of town."
"zach, spida, jaylen brown come to mind"
Jaylen Brown
"Ben is not a second option on offense lol. He was supposed to be but since he hasn't grown at all, he is the third or fourth option now. OG is a perimeter player obviously he's going to have less attempts at the rim. Ben can't shoot outside of five feet so all his shots have to be at the rim. The fact that you don't know that is and you're still trying to act like you have any knowledge on the matter is just confounding. Being a ball handler or even the primary ball handler doesn't automatically make you the better player. OG is a lot more versatile and flexible on offense, if you take the ball out of Simmons hands he becomes useless. OG has come a long way as a ball handler and he's excellent off the ball. Simmons either has the ball in his hands or has to stand at the dunkers spot. You can't put Simmons outside of the paint because no defender respects him enough to stay close to him. Simmons is more one-dimensional than OG. OG is decent on the ball and excellent off the ball. Simmons is excellent on the ball (I'm being generous) and terrible off the ball.   &gt; stop overrating role players and acting like they are in the same tier as primary ball handlers  Primary ball handler is literally a role. It has nothing to do with how good of player you are in other areas. Marcus Smart was a primary ball handler for the Celtics, and not one person is going to say he ain't a role player. Jaylen Brown is not primary ball handler so are you trying to say that Smart is better than JB? You are just showing off your basketball ignorance. You should stop commenting cause every time you comment you just look dumber."
So the Celtics just give up Jaylen Brown in exchange for a bad contract?
Jaylen Brown fans RISE UP
Boston is not giving up Jaylen Brown for Randle lol.
I think jaylen brown is a good player but not a franchise player like dame
"&gt;He can score at a high level  What does this mean?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;If Beal is your primary scorer then you‚Äôre not winning a championship.  Same goes for Jaylen Brown, what's your point?"
"Tristan Thompson is easily more handsome than Jaylen Brown, what is this nonsense."
Jaylen Brown easily
"If you look into what some scouts said about him years ago, this is the epitome of who he is. He doesn‚Äôt care about the game of basketball he cares about being famous and living in LA and living the famous person life, he doesn‚Äôt train to get better in the off season. I saw a 3 diff scouts compare him to Jaylen brown before Jaylen broke out and 2 out of the 3 said brown was what you wanted in an nba player because he focuses on getting better every year. Ben just doesn‚Äôt care."
"Yeah AD is going to be a popular choice and for good reason. To mix it up a little I'll add KAT, Jaylen Brown, and PG"
"Jaylen Brown or Paul George. Both are elite catch &amp; shoot players that‚Äôll let Luka dominate the ball. But at the same time when Luka needs a break, both guys can still create their own shot and handle the ball. Both also excel as defenders which is pretty important given that DAL‚Äôs wing players will often be tasked with the opponent‚Äôs lead guards to hide Luka.   Lot of people naming big men (Giannis, AD, etc.) as a roll partner which makes perfect sense. I‚Äôd just preferably want a secondary ball handler just so that Luka doesn‚Äôt have to do *everything* on the perimeter by himself especially in the postseason when he‚Äôll be playing 40+ minutes."
Jaylen took a step slightly back defensively with his offensive involvement increase.  They were pretty much even in steals/blocks/ defensive rating and defensive win shares. I have a hard time comparing Dbpm when brown has timelord covering for him vs Alex Len (need more gafford).  Browns defense is overrated imo. Especially as his offensive role has increased.    Brown better than the (almost) league scoring champ?   You realize that brown commits as many turnovers as Beal handling the ball way less and doesn‚Äôt create nearly as many assists despite playing on a better team.   Who says that Brown with even more usage and more fga can sustain the same efficiency?   Brown also hasn‚Äôt proven consistently to score like this as Beal has. Beal just had back to back 30+ ppg seasons
AD I guess. But i really want to see Jaylen Brown next to him
Beals usage is higher but so are his Assists. Jaylens assist to TO ratio is ASS.  He also took a step back in defensive production with his usage increase.  Could Jaylen be as efficient with 4 more shots and more usage? Idk. Like I said he will never sniff 30. And if he keeps adding usage his 1.25 assists per turnover will be even worse.   Imagine thinking Jaylen brown is worth a 27 year old in his prime basically scoring champ who is from st Louis and would make your other star more happy Lmao
"Idk this is kind of subjective. If we are talking most important draft picks, Ainge ‚Äúreaching‚Äù for Jaylen Brown at 3, and then trading back to get Tatum, is significantly more important than missing on late first round picks. People really overrate the average value of picks outside of the top 5-10- Kelly Olynyk was a great pick, so was Rozier, Marcus Smart was a great pick (weak draft), Avery Bradley also a good find way back when.  All of that being said, no matter how you slice it, other teams overall have drafted better given circumstances. Toronto comes to mind off the top- all of those guys are home grown/ drafted. GSW has also done very well, Heat seem to find some diamonds in the rough, I‚Äôm sure others I‚Äôm forgetting."
Google Jaylen brown juice. It‚Äôs a clothing store and a foundation that he runs.
"Thanks god. I‚Äôm ok moving Beal and getting on with the rebuild but Jaylen Brown is the most insufferable and ill informed player in the league (with the possible exception of Kyrie, but I feel like he‚Äôs in his own ‚Äúspecial‚Äù category)"
Maybe but he‚Äôs shown that he can improve. he is so much better than his rookie season. He could continue to take big leaps each season similar to Jaylen brown.
"So interestingly, even though Beal has been struggling from three in recent years compared to the start of his career, he still scores at more or less the same efficiency as Brown since he's absolutely elite at getting to the line, although I think Tommy would have a few words about how Jaylen is officiated.  Beal is a little bit higher as far as TS% goes but the difference is fairly negligible.  With the extra assists (Beal is a 5+ guy, the Wizards were just ass and Westbrook eats a lot of possessions) on top of the extra scoring at the same general efficiency, Brad is definitely the more potent offensive weapon.  The big thing working against Jaylen right now is that his actual defensive output doesn't live up to his potential on that end.  He's very good guarding just about anyone 1-4 that isn't a major size outlier, and in particular he can feast against athleticism-reliant guys without deep bags like we saw a couple of seasons ago against Siakam.  But those possessions only make up a fraction of a given game, and the rest of his defensive skillset just isn't where it should be.  He does a ton of ball-watching, his positioning is poor, and he gets caught flat-footed a lot.  It's most notable when his man is in the corner.  He'll either over-commit to helping against the drive and not be able to recover to defend against the kickout to the corner three, or he'll get caught in a daze and his man will punish him backdoor.  Considering that the corner three is one of the most valuable shots in the game it's really not ideal to have such a glaring weakness in defending it.  You can attribute it maybe to the increased offensive burden he carried this year, but the thing is that if we're doing a current ranking we need to take into account current performance, and Jaylen grades out as a minus defender at the moment just like Beal does.  That said, I obviously am not advocating for a trade.  His issues are fixable, whereas Beal is not going to suddenly grow a few inches and become an athletic monster lol.  If Fournier comes back and maybe we get a couple of guys who can lighten the offensive burden for Jaylen and Jayson I think we can finally see that defensive leap from JB, I just don't want to assume it quite yet."
"Curry cant carry the load alone because wiggins is underperforming  his contract.. wiggins is on a max contract and scoring 18ppg.. for context jeremi grant earns 20m/yr and is dropping 23ppg.. jaylen brown is on same salary scale as wiggins and is dropping 26ppg.. draymond cant score.. idgaf if he is whatever kind of best defender he calls himself. He cant be earning 25m/yr and be scoring 7ppg.. warriors lost so many games in which curry scored more than 40pts and draymond score less than 5pts and warriors lost by 2-3pts. Besides curry, every other big contract warriors have is underperforming.."
"Firstly, it's three consecutive seasons of serious injury issues. Doesn't have to be season ending to have injury affect play.  **Players definitively better than Westbrook (23)**  Embiid, Harden, Kyrie, KD, Giannis, Middleton, Trae Young, Tatum, Butler, Beal, Gobert, Mitchell, Chris Paul, Booker, Jokic, Kawhi, Paul George, Luka, Lillard, LeBron, AD, Curry, KAT,  If you disagree with any player on this list, we just have fundamental differences in how we understand basketball.  **Players that rank around where Westbrook is (15)**  Simmons, Holiday, Randle, Bam, Jaylen Brown,  Sabonis, Brogdon, Zach Lavine, Kyle Lowry, Siakam, CJ McCollum, Ja Morant, Demar Derozan, Zion, Dearon Fox.  Notable omissions from this list include Jamal Murray and Klay Thompson.  I personally have him behind pretty much everyone except McCollum, and DeRozan which puts him number 37.  If just half the guys on the second list are better (ranking them is splitting hairs), Westbrook is in that 30-45 range that I have him at.  If you list the players like that it really isn't that outrageous  or disrespectful to have Westbrook where I have him.   If you have him better than everyone on the second list, which puts him at 24, I'll just think you're a biased fan."
Kuminga is all about projection and development. You have to consider the possible outcomes for him and believe that he can get to that Jaylen Brown level eventually or at least become a better Jeff Green type player. If they have no faith in that then it‚Äôs gonna be a hard sell.
"I mean specific to what you are asking, Tatum, Booker and Bam will all be 27-28 which for the vast majority of NBA players is entering/ in their prime. Beal will be 30 which is in the same ball park.  Other guys on that list who are already proven: Donovan Mitchell, Ja Morant, Trae, Jaylen Brown, Ingram, Zion and Ayton will all be somewhere in their 24-26 year old seasons which is also their prime.  This is an all time weak USA olympic team. But there are a ton of very talented 22-26 year old NBA players who will be 26-30 at the next olympics. If we bring the best of the best it could be an all time great team, but that is assuming progression from everyone listed above."
"4 years from now 12 man roster could realistically be any combination of:  PG: Cade Cunningham, Ja Morant, De‚ÄôAron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young SG: Brad Beal, Jaylen Brown, Jalen Green, Devin Booker SF: Jayson Tatum, Brandon Ingram,  PF: Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson C: Evan Mobley, Anthony Davis, DeAndre Ayton  That is an absolutely stacked, deep talent pool. There was an unprecedented number of injuries and players sitting out this time around, but the USA talent pool is so incredibly deep."

Jaylen Brown
Why would the celtics offer up jaylen brown when he has the potential to become better than beal? Not saying he is right or he is a lock be better in the future but his upside is huge as a guy who can defend really well and score from all 3 levels. Beal is a great player but it‚Äôs not much of an improvement from a guy who put up almost the same exact numbers this past year and is 4 years younger.
"In order, AD, Lebron, Kawhi, Curry, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown and more, but basically superstars or anybody that could overwhelm the opposition defensively"
"Good. Yes its Beal, but unless you're on the cusp of acquiring a superstar like Dame or Kawhi, Jaylen Brown shouldn't be in any trade considerations imo."
"Starting 5:  Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Evan Mobley  Bench: Cade Cunninghan, Mikal Bridges, Bam Adebayo, Ja Morant, Jaylen Brown, De‚ÄôAndre Hunter, Kevin Durant (will be like Melo in 2016)  Coach:  Pop, Monty, Kerr, Spo"
"Starting 5:  Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Evan Mobley  Bench: Cade Cunninghan, Mikal Bridges, Bam Adebayo, Ja Morant, Jaylen Brown, De‚ÄôAndre Hunter, Kevin Durant (will be like Melo in 2016)   Coach:  Pop, Monty, Kerr, Spo"
is it even clear that beal is better than jaylen brown?
"If Jaylen Brown was healthy, we win by 40 easily"
"Cool, negotiations start with Jaylen Brown and 2 1sts."
"Fuck off. The 2nd pick in the draft is going to one of the best teams in the league and dies before he ever touches the floor. Imagine if the 73 win Warriors had added Brandon Ingram or Jaylen Brown and they died 2 days after the draft. That would be memorable, wouldn't it?  Fucking troll."
"Fuck that Nellyville connection they got goin on, trade Civil Rights activist Jaylen ‚ÄúCivil Rights activist‚Äù Brown and we riot."
Jaylen Brown averaged 30 ppg/6 rpg/4 apg on 51/40/83 shooting without Tatum lol
Not a hot take at all. Or at least I hope not. Jaylen Brown is a bit worse offensively but a massively better defender. Also younger and he has gotten better every single year. Tatum forcing the front office to trade Jaylen would be gut wrenching.
"I doubt it happens. Unless the Celtics are willing to give up Jaylen Brown and/or Marcus Smart, they would have one of the worst offers for Washington out of all the teams rumored to trade for Beal. And the Celtics would not win a championship even if they added Beal to this current Celtics team without giving up anyone."
"Jaylen Brown occasionally, Jrue holiday  You have to have a solid base and quick feet, it seems tough to time"
It would be a bad move because jaylen brown isn‚Äôt even in his prime yet
"Personally wouldn‚Äôt move Wiggins, he was incredibly consistent this year and looked really good on defense. He can be a better version of Harrison Barnes for them. If the player is Beal/Lillard, you give up whatever you can. But I agree a fringe guy like Holiday level wouldn‚Äôt really be worth it. Jaylen Brown maybe?  Curry Klay Brown Wiggins Draymond  Would be a really fun lineup, awesome switching on defense and good shot making/slashing. I think that lineup makes the WCF but I agree with you dude, it ALL depends on how Klay looks."
"The Celtics don't have a single player after Jaylen Brown on the level of LeVert and Allen, unless you want to count Fournier, who is technically a Free Agent, and it's still questionable. The Celtics could not put together a Harden style package without Jaylen Brown, so the Beal thing will never happen. Stars that shoot their way out of town generally don't get traded for another star, but people still underrate what Brooklyn gave up to get him. Basically every team in the league could have used LeVert or Allen this past year, including Brooklyn. The Wiz would be comically stupid to trade Beal for Aaron Nesmith and Robert Williams, for example."
Warriors need to trade wiggins but i think the ideal replacement is jaylen brown
"[ESPN] Does Jayson Tatum hate his teammates, Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart?"
I can't imagine the Wizards would be OK trading Beal to Boston and not getting Jaylen Brown back. What do they want with a bunch of late round picks and salary filler? You'd have to imagine there are much better offers out there than that.
"This is still in the ""if"" phase, which it has been since literally the beginning of this past season. Also, the Wiz would be dumb to take any package they doesn't involve Jaylen Brown, which defeats the purpose. I'm still very skeptical this could actually happen even if Beal wanted it.   And before anyone says ""reeee Brooklyn!"", the Celtics don't have anywhere near the package of picks and young upside players that Brooklyn used in that deal. Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen are not Romeo Langford and Robert Williams."
LeBron AD Jayson Tatum Jaylen Brown
Could Siakam? Porzingis? DeRozan? Jaylen Brown? I don't think so. They have to be physically dominant and be able to dribble and pass well to get out of all the traps and double/triple teams. Plus they'll be full court pressured the whole game.
Would be ecstatic to get Jaylen Brown but probably a non starter for Boston. Hoping for a bidding war if Beal does request a trade sometime this next week
"Trading Brown for Beal will only make Boston marginally better. Beal is the better offensive player but Jaylen is the better 2-way player. Factor in Jaylen‚Äôs age and contract, then Brad would be foolish to let go of Jaylen."
With jaylen brown it would be
"If you have Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Bradley Beal, why do you need your first round picks for the next 5 years?"
"Don‚Äôt like the Shai and Cade comp. Shai is significantly better as a ball handler but Cade is stronger and a better defender. Shai is more of a Kyrie type player whereas Cade is like Tatum or a less athletic PG13 but with somewhat better playmaking.  Green and LaVine is pretty solid.  Mobley and Bosh is a bit optimistic for Mobleys offense but not bad.  Suggs is super athletic, he‚Äôs more of a Jrue Holiday IMO.  Moody and Mikal is fine but pretty optimistic  Kuminga‚Äôs ceiling comp is more of a Jaylen Brown. Less optimistically, I guess Kelly Oubre. Floor is maybe more explosive Stanley Johnson.  Bouk is more of a Jordan Clarkson or Raptors Demar Derozan, an athletic scoring guard.  Davion and Jrue is fine. Realistically he‚Äôs a more athletic Pat Bev though.  Wagner-Ariza is ok I guess.  Scottie is much more of a big than OG, and OG, while a solid passer, doesn‚Äôt playmake like Scottie. I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs more like Draymond at the very high end, Rondae Hollis Jefferson on the low end."
That's cold. Jaylen Brown knows he's on the chopping block if that happens.
jaylen brown :(
[Live look at Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum at practice tonight](https://youtu.be/lCF6_l8gtdA)
Jaylen Brown? LMAO not trying to disrespect CJ but come on now.
Yeah like not including Jaylen Brown for Beal lmfao
"&gt; Even guys like George and Kawhi stopped being a shut down defender after they became better scorers.  Funny you mention those two names.   Feb 14, 2020: [Forget his 39 points, Jayson Tatum‚Äôs defense on Kawhi Leonard stood out](https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/celtics/2020/02/14/forget-his-points-jayson-tatum-defense-kawhi-leonard-stood-out/6JTplPDN335t03OtBpFvDO/story.html)  Mar 4, 2021: [Here's how Brown, Tatum shut down Paul George in Celtics' win over Clippers](https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/heres-how-jaylen-brown-jayson-tatum-shut-down-paul-george-celtics-win-vs-clippers)"
"Jaylen Brown is what every team is desperately looking for in today‚Äôs game. Celtics bet on him making a leap and he did.   John Collins is a very good player who isn‚Äôt quite the perfect skill set for the modern game. Even if he continues to improve he‚Äôs not suddenly going to have handles and perimeter athleticism.   The other issue is the Hawks can‚Äôt sign everybody. Trae is a max. Hunter is basically a max (just like Jaylen, Hunter is what every team desperately wants). Is Collins really the best 3rd guy to complement those two?  And what about the other players on the team?  Reddish, Huerter, Okongwu. These guys will all need to get paid to varying degrees.   I think they absolutely sign Collins to a reasonable deal but they really can‚Äôt go max on him.   It‚Äôs the proverbial good problem to have - too much young talent to keep everyone. I just think Collins is the odd man out."
"Totally different skill sets. Jaylen Brown was theoretically the two-way wing that everyone wants and his development bore that out. Collins is harder to fit into a modern team as a big man tweener-type who isn't particularly rangy (he's one of those players who shoots a good percentage from 3 but doesn't take them enough to command a ton of attention out there), doesn't pass much and isn't really a good defender. The Hawks would be better off paying someone like Bobby Portis a fraction of that, or finding the next Portis/Wood etc off the scrap heap if they really want that archetype of player."
But for a lot of guys it ends up being true. Some never have the defensive effort levels necessary. Also some guys who are projected as average nba defenders like Klay or Jaylen Brown ended up being very good because of their effort level and basketball intelligence.
JC is nowhere near Jaylen Brown lol what
If brown is a bad player how does a sign and trade swap of Oubre and Jaylen Brown sound to you
"Hope Jayson Tatum still has room for improvement and get rid of Jaylen Brown for a real, better #2 option. Green teamers will dodge this and blame everyone else but at the end of the day, your team is as good as your best players. LeBron James was dragging worse rosters to deep Playoff runs year after year but two ""All-Stars"" struggled so much just to get in? Heck, is Julius Randle's supporting cast that much better than Boston's that New York is in the 4th seed but Boston needs to play in the Play-In?  Tatum has only shown flashes of superstardom while Brown is just a bad player."
"Jaylen Brown can actually create his own shot, Collins has to get fed by Trae in order to get shots  You can't consider an offensively minded player who can't go get their own bucket a star."
"This is my dream scenario. Someone like Jaylen Brown(just an example) at the 3, an improved Cam at the 2 and Hunter at the 4 is frightening"
That‚Äôs a very bold take that JC is as good as Jaylen Brown
"He's definitely above role player status. He's getting a max contract, role players don't get max contracts. He's as good as jaylen brown for example and if the hawks didn't have so much offensive firepower he'd be averaging 25 and 10 with around the same elite efficiency he's at now. Hawks made an incredible postseason run and the majority of the team is still very young. They should keep this core together for the next 10 years because they're building something extremely special in atl"
"Almost every star this playoff got injured though, especially on the teams they faced.  You saying almost every team built a team of injury prone players?  Anthony Davis,  Lebron James, Jamal Murray, Mike Conley, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Jaylen Brown  I mean even Chris Paul got hurt, and Booker broke his nose.  Those are just the guys who would be considered stars."
"Nah, let Jaylen Brown come home. Then you've got a deal"
"They probably can't compete with a healthy Brooklyn/Milwaukee for now but longterm, as long as Atlanta don't overpay Collins + find a way to dump Gallo, they should be straight . With all their pieces, I see them being able to make a consolidation trade in a few years if they time their window right.  There are some young star players around Trae's age that will be reaching unrestricted free agency or pre-agency within 2-3 years.. off my head thinking about Jaylen Brown, Karl Anthony Towns etc"
"Been saying this.   Trae for Luka is an L for the Hawks. But if reddish capitalizes on his potential, he‚Äôs got Jaylen Brown to Paul George potential.  That‚Äôs a win for the Hawks."
"Yes Khris just had an amazing game. Yes the Bucks are going to the finals. Yes Jaylen Brown is just a little bit below Khris rn, but he‚Äôs also younger. Perspective is nice, and you‚Äôre entitled to your opinion... but get that deer cock out ya mouth."
Do u do anything but hate on Jaylen Brown? Genuine question
"Dude. Your entire comment history is specifically hating on Jaylen Brown. What the hell is wrong with you. How much time a day on average do you spend thinking about him? I get not liking a specific player on your team, but holy shit dude.  Edit: there‚Äôs no way your actually a Celtics fan. This has to be a troll account. A very dedicated troll account."
"Devic3 and bringing up Jaylen Brown on every thread, name a more iconoc duo."
Still way better than Jaylen Brown.
Jaylen Brown
"Jaylen Brown shot 50% with 1.4 makes a game. Of everyone who made at least 1 per game and played at least a third of the season (24 games), he‚Äôs sixth in the league in percentage after Kyrie, CP3, Jokic, Aldridge and Durant."
"I don't think that Jaylen gets traded this offseason even if it was for Dame. That would be a horizontal move for the Celtics. It would be subtraction by addition. Brown is on a team friendly deal, his 24 years old , and his numbers looked like this:  **JBs Stats 2020-21**  PTS 24.7 TRB 6.0 AST 3.4 FG% 48.4 FG3% 39.7 FT% 76.4 eFG% 55.8  **Dames Stats 2020-21**  PTS 28.8 TRB 4.2 AST 7.5 FG% 45.1 FG3% 39.1 FT% 92.8 eFG% 55.4  **JBs Cost 2020-21        2021-22        2022-23         2023-24**  Boston Celtics $22,991,071 $24,830,357 $26,669,643 $28,508,929  **Dames Cost 2020-21        2021-22        2022-23          2023-24        2024-25**  Portland Trail Blazers $31,626,953 $43,750,000 $47,250,000 $50,750,000 $54,250,000  Also why trade for Bradley Beal when Jaylen is almost statistically identical to Bradley Beal at this age in development.

Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown and I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs close
"Harden, Beal, Mitchell, Booker, and Lavine all have a pretty good case over him if he comes back only slightly worse. Jaylen Brown and SGA would as well if he comes back a lot worse. PG might be a 3 or 4 now, but if he‚Äôs considered a 2 he‚Äôs also better."
Jaylen Brown gets memed a lot so I don‚Äôt know if sarcasm on the internet is just over your head. You really out here making it seem like a whole sub is dumb enough to not make this trade when it‚Äôs like 2 people. Very weird and just screams that you‚Äôre looking for attention.
"Rofl Beal for Jaylen Brown, what a joke."
"You don't give up Jaylen Brown for an ""audition"" lmao especially given Tatum's existing relationship with Beal."
"I really hope some time down the line there‚Äôs some hilarious punch line to this, because it‚Äôs insane how much you waste your time trashing Jaylen Brown if there isn‚Äôt some joke it‚Äôs building up to or something."
Both over Jaylen Brown by a mile.
Jaylen Brown
Dame for Jaylen Brown is nowhere near a realistic option.
"No. Jaylen Brown, contrary to what some people think, has been a great defender in the postseason. Last postseason for example, he had more total defensive win shares (4th in the league behind Tatum, Lebron, AD) than Butler or Bam despite playing 4 less games.   His d-bpm was 1.1. Guys who had lower ones last playoffs include Dort, PG, Gobert, and Embiid. In this playoffs, that includes Bridges, Ayton, Capela, Hunter, Jrue, and PG.  He had a plus 3 d-raptor, tied with Tatum. Guys with lower ones last year included Myles Turner, Bam, Covington, Theis, Embiid, OG, Giannis, Butler, and Gobert. This postseason, the following guys have a plus 2.5 at most: Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Hunter, Durant, Jrue, Patrick Beverley, Kawhi, Simmons, and PG."
&gt; Beal does only 1 thing great and that‚Äôs score.  You just described Jaylen Brown
Jaylen brown 1 Ingram 2 Murray 3 Simmons 4
"I mean I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any meaning behind the article, but he does seem to be very good friends with Jaylen Brown and if him and Tatum are both still with the Celtics in a few years they‚Äôre likely to be a premier destination for other young stars as they‚Äôd already have two in place.  Again with that said this article is just meaningless speculation, but the point that the Celtics can become a premier destination by keeping those two around and avoiding the wheels falling off with the rest of the roster is probably true. Granted the article didn‚Äôt make that point as far as I know, I‚Äôm just explaining why Mitchell or another young star might want to go to Boston."
Jaylen Brown probably goes 1 or Jamal Murray
Jaylen Brown is the best player of the 2016 draft.
Jaylen Brown quite easily.
Jaylen Brown 1 BI 2
"lol as much as i hate to admit it, you are right celtic fan.  add jaylen brown to the mix"
Bad attempt at trolling Jaylen Brown.
It‚Äôs a long shot and this is going to sound crazy but how about Simmons for Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart just for the hell of it lol
"True but, they're acting like teams will trade someone like Jaylen Brown or Mitchell for Simmons."
"The 2019 world cup roster:  Derrick White, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Harris, Marcus Smart, Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Mason Plumlee, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker"
"2014 Nets: Paul Peirce leaves in offseason, beginning a slow, brutal decline  2015 Wizards: Paul Peirce leaves in offseason and team gets much worse  2016 Cavs: the exception  2017 Cavs: Kyrie leaves  2018 Cavs: LeBron leaves, team bottoms out  2020 Celtics: Hayward leaves, team gets worse, Jaylen Brown forgets how to play defence"
And how many games has Embiid has missed over his career because of injuries? Now compare that to the number of games Jaylen Brown has missed.  You do the math. Soldier lol
Jaylen Brown sat out the entire playoffs with a injury. Embiid sucked it up and played with a torn meniscus.  You do the math.
"Unless teams are willing to send like Jaylen Brown, MPJ/Murray, Bam, etc I don‚Äôt think there is a better package to be had. It would likely include multiple firsts and swaps and some combination of Maxey, Thybulle, Shake, etc.  Bad teams will have zero interest in making the trade (so rule out like OKC and their stash of picks for example) and teams like the Lakers, Clippers, Nets, Bucks, etc don‚Äôt really have any great assets left to move."
"Not really sure how 3p% matters much if they end up having the same fg%. It just means Tatum was worse at 2p than Paul George. The only real thing that Tatum may be better at than George is ft% but even then, 77% isn‚Äôt so bad to the point where he‚Äôs ‚Äúshooting them out of the game‚Äù. The difference is hardly there. My point is that ppl were praising Tatum for taking on the stacked nets team without jaylen brown despite his ‚Äúbad‚Äù efficiency, which in all honesty isn‚Äôt that bad. So it makes sense for ppl to praise PG for taking on the stacked suns team without kawhi. If you‚Äôre fine with the Tatum praise but are against the PG praise then you might just be a PG hater."
&gt;Tatum has always been in the center in all those teams     But also   &gt;Jaylen Brown averaged 5 pts/game in their first ECF run and Tatum wasn‚Äôt even on the team.
"Why do people always say this as if Brown and Tatum were the sole reasons for that.  A. Jaylen Brown averaged 5 pts/game in their first ECF run and Tatum wasn‚Äôt even on the team.  B. The year after Al Horford was their best player and Rozier went off.  Their third appearance was definitely because of them but I mean they always had a cupcake path to the ECF. The one time they had a good second round opponent they got smoked.  Now the ‚Äúother guys‚Äù on Boston are objectively worse and the Bucks, Nets, 76ers, and Hawks ain‚Äôt going anywhere. Their future is not as promising as it sounds."
"It is coincidence for most of them. Giannis, Kyrie, Jaylen Brown, and Trae Young had freak injuries. AD and Kawhi are always getting hurt. LeBron regular season injury and Harden are the only ones that might have to do with the condensed season, but a 36 year old breaking down after playing so much isn't rare or unique and Harden was famously in bad shape to start the year."
I mean when you‚Äôre playing with Tingus Pingus I would pass to Jaylen Brown with a smaller beard too
There is virtually no way you can convince Brad Stevens that a near supermax defensive center that's an offensive liability that gets targeted constantly every playoffs is worth Jaylen Brown lol.
"I‚Äôll explain.  The argument was that ‚Äúayton and booker are the best young duo in the game‚Äù  The response that tried to justify that statement over Tatum and brown being better was that the suns are in the finals.  Getting injured one out of five seasons does not make you a worse player, and being on a team where more people got injured especially doesn‚Äôt make you a worse player. The stupidity of this argument reeks of recency bias. If the whole suns team had caught covid because of an irresponsible staffer, no gm is changing their evaluation of ayton and booker as players and that didn‚Äôt make the suns any better or worse as a team. Just dumb luck.  Judging players on their amount of success in their most recent playoff run is such a weird way to judge individual players. So what, rookie jaylen brown in the ECF was a better player than Devin booker last season, because one made the playoffs and the other didn‚Äôt? Crowder is better than Levine because his teams was healthy and won?  The suns are a better team than the Celtics this year, especially with health factored in. I‚Äôm not sure who you think you‚Äôre replying to or what you‚Äôre reading."
Gobert for Jaylen brown ü§£ü§£ü§£
Why would Celtics trade jaylen brown for Rudy trash gobert lmfao
"Somehow Kawhi, Jaylen Brown, Ben Simmons don't an accidental shot to the head or legs every single game."
"I would take Luka, Trae, and Zion over Booker without thinking about it at all. I think Tatum has a strong case as well. Mitchell and Murray I think are probably not as good (especially Murray who I think is very inconsistent.) Morant I'm not sure. Jaylen Brown should be considered as well."
That reminds me of Jaylen Brown being ranked 101st in Pelton's WARP among 2016 prospects (with a *negative* WARP).
did they not give the social justice award to jaylen brown because he's a communist?
Jaylen Brown is definitely going to win that Kareem Social Justice award at some point in his career
Jaylen Brown too
And Jaylen Brown
Jaywatch for Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown CP3 - 6 weeks for Chris Paul
I‚Äôm kinda annoyed you didn‚Äôt include Jaylen Brown
"Jaylen Brown is a reserve here too, don't forget"
Tatum and Brown lost in the second round once lol Jaylen didn't even play this year we lost round 1.
I‚Äôm not the one that brought up 538. I‚Äôm just pointing out that if you‚Äôre going to use it to criticize Jaylen Brown you might want to first make sure it doesn‚Äôt criticize Trae even worse.
"So despite how awesome 3 of those drafts look (just due to the star factor), I wouldn't wanna move Bam who I think is the perfect center in today's NBA (outside of the elite Jokic/Embiid tier). May be missing out on a superstar but even for a Jaylen Brown caliber player, I feel like Bam for him is an even trade."
I'd rather have Jaylen Brown. Honestly i'm probably even taking JB over the #1 pick.
"Pick #3 seems to always be so damn good, #6 not so much.  I‚Äôd rather have Jaylen Brown than like Mobley and Barnes."
"Nothing worse than Laker fan pages on social media lmao. Not that other people don't also have these shitty asterisk takes, but I can't stand these fan pages always finding ways to gas up the Lakers. There's no asterisk for the Lakers just like there's no asterisk for whoever wins this year.  Also, take yourself seriously and spell the damn players' names right... It's JAYlen Brown not Jalen for fuck's sakes he's a 5th year All-Star  The JAYS not the JAs"
Comparing herro to Jaylen brown is fucking dumb
"Jaylen Brown&gt;Ingram&gt;Simmons (personal opinion)  Also Simmons for Lillard isn‚Äôt even close, Sixers need to give a lot more"
"This is precious. Out of context volume stats compared across different team situations &amp; years as proof Jaylen Brown is better than ‚Äúalmost any #2 in NBA history‚Äù is peak r/nba. Yall blindly use stats like these to say your favorite player is better when Brown is not better than 90+% of #2s  No team in the league would win with Brown as their #2. Healthy Nets and Lakers &gt;&gt;&gt;. Unless you play the most injury riddled Finals team ever you have no chance, and even then Lowry was clearly the 2nd best player on that Raps team with Siakam only being relevant for a couple games in the Finals.  If this is the hill you wanna die on, so be it."
"&gt; You can bookmark my comment that says Brown is reaching his ceiling and isn‚Äôt enough to be a #2 on a Championship team for the next 6 years.  It's not worth bookmarking though.  Jaylen Brown is putting up an efficient 26/6/3. That's better than almost every #2 in championship history. Plus his playoff performances have outperformed his regular-season performances 4 times out of 4, his game translates really well to the post-season.   If 3rd year Pascal Siakam can be the #2 scoring option on a title team [\(as part of a historic scoring duo\)](https://np.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/ivab0t/fun_fact_pascal_kawhi_are_tied_for_the_2nd_most/) then so can Jaylen Brown.   The question isn't on Brown. It's on the coaching and FO. Our title chances depend on whether we can adequately build around Jayson and Jaylen."
It would take them up a bit but I don‚Äôt think Brown for Dame gets a ring. The Celtics front office will probably prefer a much longer time frame attempting to build around Jayson and Jaylen. But who knows.   Add Dame to Tatum and Brown it‚Äôs more likely. But that‚Äôs just not going to happen.
"Every day we see people taking future potential over proven talent right now   If you trade jaylen for dame and get a chip for it, you're not going to lament the loss of jaylen brown   Dame takes that roster up a notch with actual bigs protecting the rim"
Luka had neck issues. Mike Conley was out for a good portion. Cp3 had his left shoulder all messed up. Donovan Mitchell was out for one game and had lingering issues. Could count Jaylen brown before the playoffs as well. Klay been out the whole season.
"and the Hawks werent?  Gallo, Bogi, Hunter, Reddish, Capela, OO all missed time before the all star break.  Some of them large chunks of the first half.  The Hawks finished the year with the 4th most games lost to injuries in the league.  Hawks are the last team to try and use the injury argument against.  His [defense is just that reputation outside the versatility](https://craftednba.com/players/jaylen-brown).  He ended the year as basically exactly neutral as a defender this year according to 538.  I don't place all my eggs in that basket, but it's a measurement.  In terms of defensive rating the Celtics had a 111.2 DRtg at the break and the Hawks had a 112.2 when these two played.  So again not much of a difference but the Hawks had a better Net Rtg with Trae than the Celtics did with Jaylen.These playoffs have also proven it's not exactly easy to attack Trae defensively and that PG defense is overrated and that with a great defensive coach you can scheme around it."
I mean Jaylen Brown had a stat line of 24/5/4 on 3 turnovers a game at the break and the Celtics were 19-17 overall and 17-16 in the games Brown played so not exactly lighting up the world.  I would say Trae would have been a better selection on 26/4.4/9.4.
Jaylen Brown should be considered
Jaylen Brown
Kyrie is better than Trae  Giannis #7 behind Steph Harden  Jokic Luka  I think Jaylen Brown is better than Simmons...
Jaylen brown
It's not. Jaylen Brown has to be one of the most overrated defenders. Dude is a traffic cone at off-ball defense.
"Ready to get downvoted, but I'd take him over Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, and maybe Westbrook."
Zion is definitely better than Jaylen Brown and Russell Westbrook in that list above. You have to understand that both Brown and Westbrook‚Äôs defense are actually atrocious. He‚Äôs around a few of the other players.
"Jaylen Brown and Russell Westbrook are the only one I could say for sure I‚Äôd rather have Zion over at this very moment. But going into next season I‚Äôd take Zion over CP3, Gobert, Booker, Mitchell. I‚Äôll take the two way wings in Butler, Tatum, PG though."
"Hell no lmao  Kuminga is an uber athletic small forward with slashing and some post up scoring skill, way higher offensive upside. His comps are Jaylen Brown, Jeff Green  You‚Äôre prob thinking of Usman Garuba, the only guy who gets  the Draymond comp in the draft"
"Outside of the OKC anomaly season‚Ä¶this guy is realistically worth around $12-$15 million a year. It‚Äôs simply baffling what he was asking for.   $25-$30 million per year is Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Brandon Ingram, etc money‚Ä¶aka bonafide all star. Just a perfect example of not knowing your worth and horrible risk assessment."
Isn't Jaylen Brown also his own agent?
The guy who doubted the Jaylen Brown contract is probably fuming rn
Fans have waaaaaaay higher hopes for their number 1 pick than logic dictates. I would not be elated for a Jaylen Brown. Jaylen Brown isn't winning a chip as the best player on a team.   Expectations don't match reality when it comes to being a sports fan. So just taking the average of former top picks is irrelevant because no one uses that as a metric of setting expectations.
These are the last 17 years of #1 overall picks:  Cade Cunningham  Anthony Edwards  Zion Williamson  DeAndre Ayton  Markelle Fultz  Ben Simmons  Karl-Anthony Towns  Andrew Wiggins  Anthony Bennett  Anthony Davis  Kyrie Irving  John Wall  Blake Griffin  Derrick Rose  Greg Oden  Andrea Bargnani  Andrew Bogut  I think you take Jaylen Brown over all but 4 of those players. When you draft #1 you hope to get someone as good as Jaylen Brown when they are his age. Number 1 picks are nowhere near surefire.  You should be nowhere near expecting a #1 option on a championship team player with your #1 overall pick. Literally none of the people on this list have done that.
"I've watched and been disappointed by them in the playoffs. You can see I'm in the PNW too.  CJ is not a AD or Klay or Jaylen Brown or Khris Middleton. Not to say Dame would be happy with just that alone, but I think he and most people expected CJ the last few years to be that good but he's not."
‚ÄúKD‚Äôs dubs‚Äù lmaoooo the Jaylen Brown flair makes sense
I would definitely not be elated if my number one pick and face of the franchise hopeful was a Jaylen Brown type player. I'd be content but not even close to elated. Brown ain't that guy lol.
"You do know he‚Äôs landed with the best development team in the league right? Players develop so quickly these days. Take Jaylen Brown. After his first couple years let alone 1 summer league game, people would‚Äôve said he‚Äôll never be an elite scorer but look at him now. That‚Äôs why putting ceilings on these guys right after they‚Äôre drafted is fucking moronic lmao"
"- The roster?  - We traded for Brown with Boston and signed Brown and Reggie.  - Jaylen Brown, Bruce Brown and Reggie Jackson?  - Not quite ...."
"I don‚Äôt think he has the size or athleticism to even come close to being Jaylen brown. If there‚Äôs anyone in this draft I feel would draw that comparison, it would be Kuminga not Cade"
"I mean I don‚Äôt think everything changes though. I just think that on an NBA floor Cade will look and play more like Jaylen Brown than Jayson Tatum.  Also Jaylen isn‚Äôt an upside comp. It‚Äôs a play style comp. There‚Äôs a chance he can be better than Jaylen, it‚Äôs unlikely, but there‚Äôs a chance."
Jaylen Brown &gt; Trae Young
Cade isn‚Äôt gonna be near the playmaker Harden or Luka is. I personally feel like both comps suck. Jaylen Brown is my favorite comp right now for Cade.
"That‚Äôs true, it doesn‚Äôt indicate skill but Jaylen Brown is incredibly skilled so I used him as a comp. If the Pistons got someone as good as Jaylen Brown #1 you‚Äôd be elated. Jaylen is an absolutely incredible player. If you are expecting your 6‚Äô6‚Äù guard to be a 6‚Äô8‚Äù guard/forward you‚Äôll be disappointed.  Do you think it‚Äôs an insult for Cade to be Jaylen Brown or something? Jaylen is an elite two-way shooting guard/small forward with great playmaking prowess and elite scoring ability.   If Cade Cunningham becomes close to Jaylen Brown‚Äôs level by the time his age 23 season comes around that would be an extremely good pick. Don‚Äôt go in expecting your rookie to be on Jayson or Luka‚Äôs level by the time he‚Äôs 22, you‚Äôre setting yourself up for disappointment. Those two are an exception to the rule, not the rule."
"I was comparing Saddiq to his contemporaries not trying to criticize him.  I was thinking of players versatility like Kelly Oubre, Michael Porter Jr, Jason  Tatum. Jaylen Brown, Cameron Johnson,  Kawhi Leonard,  Paul George,  John Collins etc."
"Get out of here haha Jaylen Brown would manhandle Jalen Green like the little boy he still is. Browns strength, handle, and footwork are on a deferent level than Green‚Äôs at the moment. They are comparable athletes and shooters. JB was just an all star lmao."
Yeah but right now Jaylen Brown and Brandon Ingram are better than Jalen Green. It‚Äôs all about how much he is willing to work on his game. No doubt he could be a very very very good NBA player if he puts in the necessary work.
"I mean him being 2 inches shorter than he says certainly changes his role. I get that you‚Äôre a Pistons fan but it‚Äôs delusional to think that his height being 2 inches shorter than it really is doesn‚Äôt matter in any way.   To me his comp goes from Jayson Tatum and Luka Doncic to Zach Lavine and Jaylen Brown.   That‚Äôs not a bad thing, those two players are amazing, they just aren‚Äôt as amazing as the freaks of nature that are Jayson and Luka."
No comparison is the best comparison. Personally haven‚Äôt seen an athlete like Jalen Green. Maybe he reminds me of a smaller less strong Jaylen Brown but Green is already significantly better than Brown was at this age.
"Definitely. We have seen high risk high reward rookie wings in Jaylen Brown and Brandon Ingram, they took 3-4 years to figure everything out. Green already made tremendous strides since he joined the G League, I am optimistic about him."
His trajectory could be Wiggins or Jaylen Brown. Just depends on how much work he puts in. Brown didn't develop his handles until year 3. Hope people don't shit on this kid if he's not an all-star his rookie year.
Enjoy future Piston Jaylen Brown while you still can my guy.
Has it? If ownership got out of the way he would have traded KP for Jaylen Brown and multiple firsts.
He could if he had a Middleton/Booker/Jaylen Brown type player as his number two that‚Äôs gonna consistently get 20-25+ per night in the playoffs while he goes off.
Didn‚Äôt Jaylen Brown just breakout last season
He's too young now but I'd really love to see Jaylen Brown go for it eventually. Based off everything we have heard about how intelligent he is.
"He's not good on switches and he's a little undersized for the 2 in the modern NBA. I think he's a better defender than Mills but you probably don't want him to guard a position up, whereas a guy like Jaylen Brown, SGA or FVV can switch more effectively at the 2"
Jaylen Brown Lonnie Walker Keldon Johnson
"Michael ""Jaylen Brown"" Jordan"
"Well yes every team without essentially 2 all-stars is a lotto team in the west and the east it will be this year.   Lavine, Lonzo, Simmons, Covington/Crowder/Bridges, Turner (not really many floorspacing centres). That's a lineup with about 100 mil in cost. Leaving about 15-20 mil in good players off the bench then a couple of 5 mils, rookies and mins. I think that team. Would make the playoffs in the west.  Alternatively a small ball lineup which might work better. Lavine, Lonzo, Wiggins, Covington (you have to go him for his rim protection here), Simmons. Wiggins is a place holder here. Ideally you want someone at the 3 who can get their own bucket, defend and hit 3s. Wiggins fits that criteria. Obviously another star would be Jaylen Brown as a better fit."
"JAYLEN BROWN WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!"
Jaylen ‚ÄúMichael Jordan‚Äù Brown
the election was rigged Jaylen Brown is the rightful winner.
Not my president.  Jaylen Brown 2024
"Jaylen Brown def isn't the MOST underrated but imo is up there. I honestly think he's just as good as Tatum, just a little more defense oriented. If he can become a better creator, his game is gonna burst wide open"
"Jaylen brown is smartest IQ-wise, lebron is smartest basketball-wise"
"Lebron/cp3/rondo for bball iq but just intelligence ,  Jaylen Brown or Lin (got his degree from harvard )"
Jaylen Brown easily  He‚Äôs extremely well educated and may be the smartest player in the NBA‚Äôs history next to Kareem
"Intelligence/BBall IQ/Creativeness are all very different things that may get called high iq play  LeBrons probably got the highest BBall IQ, Jaylen Brown sounds like the smartest person, and Jokic/Lebron/Rondo/Paul all deserve shouts for their quick thinking and creativeness."
Jaylen Brown seems smart
He wants to go to a contender so the only realistic locations/packages would be...  To the Clippers for Paul George  To the Lakers for Russell Westbrook  To the Nuggets for Jamal Murray  To the Suns for Chris Paul  To the Nets for Kyrie Irving  To the 76ers for Ben Simmons  To the Celtics for Jaylen Brown  I doubt half of these deals would ever happen tho. Philly seems the most realistic.
"Be more open to banning people. Ban that guy named painguen who dedicates his account to hating on Curry and people who are Warriors fans, ban that Jaylen Brown hating account, ban accounts designed to hate Lebron/Steph, etc etc. That's the first and most important step. From there, steps to improve the quality of the subs discussion can be taken, but you HAVE to root out the toxic kids first."

"Lmao no way  It‚Äôs hard to argue that we have 2 players that even SNIFF Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum in terms of current talent. There may be an argument that we have the deeper bench, but good benches don‚Äôt win games without good starters"
"So many of these make no sense lmao, SGA, Zion, LaVine, Jaylen Brown, winning MIP for any of these guys would mean being comfortably on an All-NBA team, probably 2nd team at least.   Seems like a pretty crazy thing to bet on, especially with how mediocre the odds are."
"Oh I don't know if I'm gonna be able to keep up with someone who spent 2 whole minutes on a player bref page after hearing about him for the first time. That kinda dedication to analysis just can't be matched. I salute your analytical prowess.   Every advanced stat backs him up:   1.6 Lebron (compares to: Derozan, Ja Morant, Robert Covington, Myles Turner)   1.7 EPM (compares to: Lowry, Middleton, Sabonis)   2.0 Raptor (compares to: Ayton, Vuc, Royce O'Neale, Joe Harris, Jaylen Brown)     He started in the closeout game for a championship team. He's a fantastic guard defender, hustles for loose balls, and has great IQ.   But I can see how all of that is easy to miss when the entirety of your bball knowledge is listening to Microsoft Narrator read you bref pages since your blindness prevents you from actually watching games."
"That‚Äôs not the fucking same lmao. We‚Äôve seen rookies struggle who end up becoming stars. I have proof from past situations. Jaylen Brown who‚Äôs on my team. Brandon Ingram, De‚ÄôAaron Fox, Bam, just to name a few.   Really weird that you‚Äôre so down on a 19-20 year old kid from overseas who got drafted to dysfunctional organization during a global pandemic and surprise surprise didn‚Äôt hit the ground running."
"You do know that CJ was re-elected for a second term as one of the VPs for the players association, a position voted in by the players? He's going to be serving through 2024 in that role. And CJ probably also would have been an all-star if he was on the Celtics; he and Jaylen Brown, as your example, are about the same caliber of player. Not that Brown wouldn't be another good candidate, he certainly would, but you're literally using your own dislike of CJ to project that the players don't like/respect him when that's clearly not the case. In fact, they've voted him as a representative twice now, and may see him as something more."
I miss ainge.   Calling Jaylen brown a bust 2 years ago was a sure fire way to make rNBA‚Äôs redhead population seethe
"Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Myles Turner would be an awesome team"
I mean yeah. But have you also considered Jaylen Brown?
Atlanta was a shit defense too lmao.  The hospital Celtics had a higher ORtg against you guys in round 1 than they had had in the regular season with Jaylen Brown lmao.  Not playing Harden and Kyrie certainly did not hurt your defense lol.  Also our starting lineup and small ball lineup demolished the Suns. Then we lost AD which actually hurts our defense.
"I mean, I'm just giving my perspective as a neutral fan. The talent level of these finals was lower than years past. Each team got to the finals fair and square, however sometimes the NBA is a game of attrition. Injuries to AD, Jaylen Brown, Mike Conley, Jamal Murray, Kawhi, Kyrie, Harden, and to a lesser extent Trae, Giannis, and CP3 made these playoffs not as interesting.  That being said this is coming from a fan whose team didn't make the playoffs so I'm purely neutral"
Only player that‚Äôs acceptable for is Jaylen Brown
"Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Pascal Siakim, and probably Sabonis.  You could talk me into taking him ahead of any of those last three, but there's no scenario where he's ahead of either of the first two."
"Jaylen Brown was out of playoffs and their 3rd star Kemba was injured then undrperform when he return. They go 1-4 against Nets, so I think they'd be fine adding Horford."
"I mean, a lot of that has to do with playing next to Embiid. I'd be pretty comfortable taking the bet that, 20 years from now people will think Ingram, Murray and maybe Jaylen Brown had better careers."
Giannis Middleton Jrue KD Harden Kyrie Trae Lebron AD Butler Tatum Steph Klay? Randle Beal Lillard Embiid Kawhi PG CP3 Booker Jokic Derozan? Luka Zion Jaylen Brown? Sabonis? Fox? Adebayo? Ayton? Donovan Mitchell John Collins? Jamal Murray? Zach Lavine? Lowry?   That‚Äôs 25 guys if you don‚Äôt include any of the question marks. 36 including question marks that I‚Äôm not sure are better but are close at this point in his career.
"You'd rather have Simmons than Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray? Embiid would do some truly heinous things if it meant he could get a do-over with one of those guys instead.  I guess you could make the argument that Simmons is better than Ingram, Siakam, and Sabonis, but it's close. I'm sure that a lot of teams would pick one of those three knowing what we know now."
"In a game with five players on the court, and the best playing 75% of the game, and on both ends, it's honestly impossible for the best player not to be on a top 64 team.   In retrospect, I think if you redraft that year, Simmons goes 5 or 6. I really doubt there's anybody picking him ahead of Jaylen Brown or Jamal Murray, that's for damn sure.   When did we forget that elite athleticism only matters if the guy has high BBIQ and gives a shit?"
Eh I mean Ingram jaylen brown and Murray are better players and have passed simmons imo
"I'll actually give myself credit for this one  I nailed ""Brandon Ingram should have gone number 1""  Of course I also thought Jaylen Brown going 3 was a joke and an awful pick so...  Win some, lose some  That said the red flags were there for Simmons. Especially about that LSU team not even being bad and the academics"
Didn‚Äôt jaylen brown improve his shooting a lot last year too? Is that a statistical Anomaly because both players have improved year to year?
Dude might be as smart as Jaylen Brown
Why Jaylen Brown over Jayson Tatum? also Demar Derozan is on the Bulls.
Reminds me Jaylen Brown
"He can be a solid second option, but definitely not for a championship team. He‚Äôs not better than George, Paul, Murray, Jaylen Brown‚Ä¶ among others who haven‚Äôt won."
"Jaylen Brown is definitely a max guy though, so it wasn't really all that fair. Best price value for an all-star, sure, but I wouldn't suggest it's necessarily fair."
"‚ÄúIn a bizarre sequence of events, Jayson Tatum is forcing a trade to the Lakers and Jaylen Brown is retiring from professional basketball to become an entrepreneur.‚Äù"
would they have included Jaylen Brown?

this thread is so fucking funny. the knicks have one fluke season and lose in the first round and suddenly they're better than a team with jayson tatum and jaylen brown. good grief lol
Yes. Give us Tatum. You already have Jaylen Brown.
Jaylen Brown and Tatum popping off as like children to get to the conference finals when Kyrie went down was CRAZY. Tatum is a ridiculously good player at only 23 years old.
"I like how Thibs continue to get shit on for this when:  Kerr: Curry, Klay, KD, Chriss, among others had surgery/season ending injuries under him just in the last 2-3 years.  Brad Stevens: Jaylen Brown wrist surgery, Kemba knee woes, and didn‚Äôt Marcus Smart miss a big chunk of the season this past year?  Steve Nash: Already has three stars that can barely play a 60-70% of a season. And this is his first year as a HC.  Mike D‚ÄôAntoni: Had Amare, Chandler in their primes, and didn‚Äôt he try coach that hobbled Lakers team with Kobe Dwight and Nash? I guess he‚Äôs to blame for all their injuries too?  I can go on if you want me to knit pick."
"Not the best one obviously, but wouldn‚Äôt mind starting my team with   Ben Simmons  Brandon Ingram  Jaylen Brown"
Jaylen Brown and its not that close lol
Tatum is a poor man's Jaylen Brown.
No they wouldn't. Jaylen Brown + MJ isn't winning the East.
I'd have to go with Jaylen Brown. But I think the dark horse nobody's bringing up is Jonas Jerebko.
your people tell me Julius randle is better than jaylen brown all the time so i wanted to see how jaylen brown matches up against julius randle in the eyes of the public. No need to get upset.

Jaylen Brown vs Bradley Beal
I'd give up jaylen brown for him
"I think his trade value is extremely high until he demands a trade in a contract year. Right now, just for the fuck of trading for him you absolutely have to send Jaylen Brown."
Idk why people thought that contract was an overpay. I remember that 2017 playoffs I thought he was fantastic. Definitely showcased a ton of potential to be the second scorer behind Kyrie. He didn‚Äôt get a ton of touches early on because Boston drafted a lottery pick onto a contender. The initial numbers were not eye popping but he showcased plenty of two way versatility. I had no doubt Jaylen Brown had it in him to become an All Star. Earlier on I kept wondering why they ignored Jaylen so hard for Jayson. I thought Jaylen honestly deserved a decent amount of spotlight despite Tatum‚Äôs brilliance. Glad to see last year he proved he could be an amazing primary scorer for a solid team.
"I can't speak to HS but he was definitely not a good playmaker/ball handler in college. I get this isn't the best source but NBAdraft.net rated his ball handling as his worst skill at 6. The way I remember it, he was obviously able so strong and athletic that he could drive to the rim against anyone at that level, but he didn't have the dribbling skills to translate that to the NBA   https://www.nbadraft.net/players/jaylen-brown/"

When you watch him, you can see that there are clearly better players in the league. But when you watch demar you can clearly see that you‚Äôre watching an all star caliber player.  Another difference I could point out is that the current MVP is an objectively better player than Russ. Whereas there are at least a few all star selections who demar has a strong case for being better than. Jaylen Brown, Ben Simmons, Sabonis and Mike Conley are a few examples."
"A max is not and has never been just for superstars, basically anybody at or around All-Star level gets one. Jaylen Brown is at that level."
He‚Äôs not a playmaker  His off ball defense is poor  A max is typically for superstar and Jaylen Brown is just a star
Completely agree. Tatum is not plug and play like brown is. He's ball dominant and you have to mold your play style around him. Give me jaylen over Tatum all day
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have both been described as insanely hard workers that are always the first ones in last ones out in the gym. Brad Stevens once told a story about how one day they were still there like an 2 hours after practice ended training and he took a photo for his son of them to show what it takes to be great.
"I really doubt you watch more Nuggets game than I had the past 4 years, you‚Äôre just behind multiple burners taking on different team flairs dude, stats are cute but you would know better if you actually watch games, or unless you just a huge homer that you can‚Äôt just deal with it.  Murray playmaking is average at best, he‚Äôs not that PnR savant, not ideal to be a primarily lead guard in an offensive engine if he was to be put as a number 1 guy.. hence like I said he‚Äôs a combo guard. Murray works best with Jokic in PnR and their 2 men game and chemistry are what drive Murray play making much better..  For me Murray is like on the same playmaking tier as Jrue Holiday or Kemba Walker. His passing out of PnR into cross court corner 3 are not even as accurate as say someone like Dame or Conley.. and he‚Äôs of course way behind than the likes of Brogdon or Fox when it comes to playmaking.  Also you‚Äôre already flat out wrong about Murray and Brown defense being a tie. Take the L boi. Murray for the most part have been below average on that end, on ball and off ball were bad, got better off ball first, then recently got better on ball but by no means it‚Äôs a toss up when it comes to comparing him to Jaylen Brown. Brown is a multi positional defender able to check 2-4, He clamped Pascal Siakam in the Playoffs all by himself for example. He can legit provide lock down defense where as Murray has been more a liability on that end more often than not."
Idk about that.. Jaylen was very much the clear cut number 2 guy in 2020 bubble and he was very much the closer in a lot of games for the Celtics in his second year I think 2018 Playoffs? They faced the Bucks for 7 games and beat the 76ers in 5 all this without Hayward and Kyrie and Brown was huge for them in the Bucks series then got injured then played well when he was available for the 76ers series
"Jaylen Brown isn't better than Tatum but I can see why people think that, from the eye test it seems like when one of them goes off the other has a quiet/bad game so if you happen to catch a couple of those in a row that idea is normal to have"
Controversial but I believe Jaylen Brown is a better player than Jayson Tatum.   Tatum maybe the better 1-on-1 iso scorer but Brown is the higher impact player and would pair alongside another All Star/ Superstar player a lot more seamlessly.
"I get it by the letter of the law it may be correct, but i just don't like how it's called differently. That situation can happen 15 times in the first 46 minutes of the game and i would bet that it will be called out on the defender every time, but the last 2 minutes that will happen once or twice? Nah forget about it.  For me, it's like if a coach decided to challenge a player traveling because he picked up his pivot foot 0.1 second before the ball was dribbled to the ground. This shit happens dozens of time a game but nobody is able to tell in real time unless it's extremely obvious.  Booker one was the latest one I remembered. Also one involving Jaylen Brown, but i can't remember exactly which game (pretty sure a regular season game) There was a few more earlier in the season as well"
"36% of Jaylen Brown passes are ranked good in the 66th percentile. Brown creates about 6 points with passing per game. 31% of Tatum passes are ranked good in the 66th percentile creating about 9 points per game with his passing per shot quality. Judging by these advance stats that measure every pass and sums up the points that are accumulated from each pass, neither of them are really that good at passing. It does seem that Brown has the edge when it comes to interior passes and Tatum has the edge when it comes to perimeter passing."
"&gt;a lot  I sincerely doubt that unless the sub is brigaded by some super far right sub during political topics that involve the NBA. Do you see in any racism when they lock the comments to just r/NBA users when they usually have to?  The people saying/yelling slurs are not true fans. They just have money to go to the game. And it‚Äôs not a widespread issue. I‚Äôve been to like 20 Celtics games in the past 10 years and I can speak for my city l when I say the audience is diverse and that no fan has yelled or even whispered anything obscene near me, from the nose bleeds to close to the front row.  And it‚Äôs everywhere. It‚Äôs just lumped with Boston because of how badly we treated Bill. Granted that was over half a century ago. You don‚Äôt see stories of Jaylen Brown finding a shit in his bed at his crib. I‚Äôm sure there have been horrible stories in other cities as well.   I‚Äôm not excusing any racism or past actions of Boston residents but the tainting of my city as some scum filled White power place is ridiculous."
"It is a strange talent comparison. Jaylen Brown is one of the more prototypical wings, he does exactly what you want from your wing players, and he does it well. KAT on the other hand stretches the floor better than any other big, pair that with some great posts moves he is close to unstoppable on offense, but he doesn't rim protect and that is a big deal when your center can not do it.   Brown can fit into any lineup ever, KAT makes the lineups unique but has the problem that you need to cater to his weaknesses to be successful."
"Steph Curry, Jaylen Brown"
Definitely legal. Jaylen Brown did it with his left hand [earlier this season (@2:49 mark)](https://youtu.be/KZ72DTeMq10) and transitioned into a step back 3.
I heard OP doesn‚Äôt like Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown is my dream fit next to Trae. Not related but I just want Jaylen to come home.
Your choice of flair confuses me because I‚Äôm fairly certain anyone who‚Äôs comparing the three point abilities of Ben Simmons and Jaylen Brown has never watched a Celtics game before.
is shirtless jaylen brown the GOAt shooter
Because Jaylen Brown hasn't been good enough as a ball handler/PnR player to warrant being higher in the pecking order.
"Funnily enough, SVG told the media he was using Jaylen Brown and Tatum (along with Lebron/AD and Kawhi/PG) as examples for BI and Zion in that they‚Äôre two way players who help a team win on both ends of the court. People go after Jaylen defensively but he‚Äôs got a bunch of respect from people in the league."
Jaylen Brown. Murray turns it up during the playoffs but has never really taken that next step and carry it into th regular season. BI is good but needs to improve defensively
"I don't know what the stats say, but anybody who watches Jaylen Brown know how talented at defense he is. He always defends the best guys. If you watched him in the Raptors series, he almost singlehandedly made Spicy P look like a G League  player. I haven't looked at the indivual stats, but Jaylen Brown is a good defender..."
Jaylen Brown was also always 3rd or 4th Option in the Playoffs unlike Murray and who was 2nd Option
"I just replied to u/dougiejones22 in a different comment, but to address your points.  - 2016 had Smart and Jaylen Brown as well, going that far back is a stretch but 2017 Tatum came in and that‚Äôs where I should of stopped.  - they definitely had a talent drain that they tried to stop with going from Irving -&gt; Kemba -&gt; Fournier -&gt; Dennis. While that talent drain happened each season Brown, Tatum, and Smart got better  - you‚Äôre definitely right with the young guys on the Sixers like Thybulle, Milton and Maxey will all improve from last year  I might be a little to high on this Celtics team, but again this is for the regular season, I don‚Äôt expect them making it far in the East, I just think they should win a lot of regular season games. So maybe Sixers 3 Celtics 4, but due to age I think they‚Äôll win more regular season games than the Heat who will have to rest either Jimmy and Kyle more than Brown or Tatum need"
Jaylen ‚ÄúMichael ‚ÄúJaylen Brown‚Äù Jordan‚Äù Brown
Is Jaylen Brown in that tier as well?
"Dudes wanted Jaylen Brown for him. I get at the time Jaylen was NOTHING like he is now, but it was pretty insane at the time too."
"Tatum has lead his team to 2 ECFs in his first 4 years  And wtf, Tatum had to play against the full strength Nets with no Jaylen Brown, the fucks he supposed to do?"
Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Robert Williams III  Payton Pritchard  Aaron Nesmith   Romeo Langford  Grant Williams   Uhh Carsen Edwards / Bruno Fernando   Certainly gives the Hawks a run for their money
"KD, Kris, and Don are better than Lebron, Jaylen brown, and Ben.   At least currently.   If we're talking primes of the players, I take group one."
prime Klay&gt;Jaylen brown
"Is there a reason why no one is saying Jaylen Brown  I think it‚Äôs Brown, Ingram and then Murray"
"I feel like Jaylen Brown started rocking the shorter shorts in 2018, and now it's a lowkey trend"
"Surprised at Jaylen Brown being on the list, but not Jason Tatum..."
"Got hurt in college too, and you ignored the most important part- he‚Äôs not remotely close to jaylen brown."
"Deandre hunter is insanely injury prone and is nowhere close to jaylen brown.   NBA is about quality over quantity. I‚Äôll take a solid all star and Tatum over the hawks collection of average players + trae any day.   Taking that into account, the Celtics aren‚Äôt the only team with a better young core than atlanta- you are forgetting about Dallas as well. Luka is much better than anyone on atlanta."
"Assuming no injuries and maintaining current trajectories, our next line up might look like:  -Trae Young/LaMelo/Fox -Donovan Mitchell/SGA/Zach LaVine -Jayson Tatum/Michael Porter/Brandon Ingram/Jaylen Brown -Anthony Davis/Zion Williamson -Bam/Jarret Allen/Christian wood  That's not a dream team but it's still all star loaded, and on paper with preparation should be a 5-10 pt favorite over every other matchup if not more."
Jaylen Brown
surprised nobody said Jaylen Brown
Did they get Jaylen Brown right? That doesn't seem unreasonable
It says antics. Not bad things. Find me an article about Jaylen Brown off the court antics. Or Malcom Bronson off the court antics. Or Giannis off the court antics. If you have your name in these articles it‚Äôs for a reason.
"Who asked JR to act up his whole career? Why doesn‚Äôt the media push a Jaylen Brown is dumb narrative? People treat you on how you act and that‚Äôs in every sphere of life.   When you go out of bounds in the middle of the play to go dab a guy sitting on the bench, look high almost everyday, and just generally act strange people will treat you like that."
"Jaylen Brown was absolutely balling out prior to the all star game, no way he makes it over him.  Maybe he makes it over Lavine?  but he's definitely no lock like you're making it out to be.  He would absolutely be a bubble guy."
Surprised Jaylen brown is on this tbh
They did.  Jaylen Brown.
"Probably the most underrated player in the league just because he's on the Kings. If he and Jaylen Brown were switched, for example, he'd be a very highly regarded player and in a lot more discussion.  I know it's a meme now, but I also can't think of a team that would be better with Ben Simmons over Fox."
Lol they underestimated jaylen brown and yikes curry at 8
"They were pretty close on Jaylen Brown, remarkably."
Jaylen Brown wasn't even in the league.
Jaylen Brown was a nice throw in for it being 6 years ago
Jaylen Brown in 2015 what the fuck
"   1. Anthony Davis. Pretty close, AD has been a solid top 10 player for a few years now.    2. Andrew Wiggins. One of the only ones where there's no injury excuse for why the player isn't as good as predicted.    3. DeMarcus Cousins. DeMarcus could be here if it wasnt for his injuries.    4. Kevin Durant. Pretty good Guess, they probably taught KD would have regressed a bit by now, which he hasn't, since he's almost consensus top 2 player right now.    5. Russell Westbrook. Wrong, but not that insane, I guess Russ would be in the 20-30 range.    6. Kyrie Irving. Pretty close, since he's considered about top 10 right, would be higher if he wasn't injured all the time.    7. Blake Griffin. Way off because of injuries.    8. Stephen Curry. Pretty close,    9. Paul George. Also really close, actually this might be spot on in my eyes.    10. James Harden. Pretty close.    11. Giannis Antetokounmpo. Kind of close.    12. Klay Thompson. I would say spot on if we assume Klay is as good as the last time we saw him.    13. Karl-Anthony Towns. Honestly, for me this is right where Kat belongs, except he's on Timberwolves. I know some people rank him like top25 which is insane to me.    14. Andre Drummond. Way off.    15. Bradley Beal. Really good guess.    16. John Wall. Could be correct if not for the injuries.    17. DeAndre Jordan. Way off    18. Jahlil Okafor. Way off.    19. Dragan Bender. Lol.    20. Jaylen Brown. Spot on Id say.      So to summarise,   Incorrect because of injuries - Demarcus, Blake, John Wall.   Spot on - KD, PG13, Klay, Kat, Bradley, Jaylen Brown.   Way off with no injury excuse - Wiggins, maybe Westbrook?, Drummond, Jordan, Okafor, Bender.   ‚Äã"
The jazz need jaylen brown
"He‚Äôs a UFA after this season.    The only way he gets traded is if he has made it clear he doesn‚Äôt want to stay in Washington.    And if he doesn‚Äôt want to stay in Washington, the wizards have no leverage.  There will not be a shortage of teams that could sign him into space. Including New Orleans.    If Beal is a free agent and has said he chooses Boston, of course Washington will trade him to Boston and it‚Äôs not going to take Jaylen Brown or Marcus Smart.   Horford, Richardson, Nesmith/Langford/RWIII/Pritchard and maybe a first would be the gist.   Washington has no leverage. Just like the Pels didn‚Äôt this year and only got a second and some expirings.   Because Lonzo could have just signed with the Knicks into space and left Nola with nothing.  Beal could sign in San Antonio or New Orleans or a few places and leave Washington with nothing"
"They nailed the Jaylen Brown pick, a lot of people thought he'd never be more than an athletic role player."
Throw in Jaylen Brown and 4 picks and it's a deal. - Tommy
Beal isn‚Äôt going to Boston without Jaylen Brown heading over to Washington. This isn‚Äôt Ernie you‚Äôre negotiating with.
"OG, Jaylen Brown. Brown probably would have got a max"
VP Jaylen Brown for Socialite Simmons lol. Like trading Giannis for Drummond.
"This was my point in that above comment. In what world do you think the Celtics are trading Jaylen Brown and Dennis Schroder for Ben Simmons? There's absolutely zero chance that happens, or the Raptors send Siakam there for Simmons, or the Nuggets send Murray there for Simmons. Simmons has low trade value right now, Philly can't just flip him for players like that. TBH I doubt they could get Brogdon and LeVert for him either. You're acting like Simmons will get you some great return but that's just not the reality right now, and that's why I think there's reason to be concerned for the Sixers."
"Jaylen brown, jamal, siakam.  One of Those 3 + a mle point guard like Schroeder + embiid is enough for a ring.   If Simmons didn‚Äôt shit the bed this season, they would have Atleast made it to 6 in the conference finals.  Even if they flip Simmons for good starters (levert+brogdon) tier players, they are contenders. Embiid is easily the best big in the game rn, and they don‚Äôt need much."
"I think mine is Kawhi, my guess is #2 but im not sure. LeBron is 23 and AD is 3 right? I know all of the superstars if those are right I believe, know prolly about the top 25 or so. Sabonis, Jaylen Brown, SGA, guys like that the shittiest all stars who aren't big names and stars who just don't get a ton of attention is where I start having no clue."
"[Highlight] LeBron signals to Frank Vogel to take Westbrook out of the game  [Wojnarowski] The Portland Trailblazers have traded superstar point guard Damian Lillard to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Jaylen Brown and 2 first round picks  [Highlight] Kanye and Drake realize their seats are right next to each others  [Highlight] Ben Simmons hits the game winning three point shot at the buzzer  [Charania] LeBron James has personally met with Adam Silver and has informed the NBA that he will not get vaccinated and will sit out the rest of the 2021-22 NBA season, sources tell The Ringer"
"Off top of my head: Ben Simmons, Embiid, Kemba, Booker, Harden(13 in Hou?), Ant (popular but not star yet), Kris Middleton, Murray, Jaylen Brown‚Ä¶shit ton more. Yikes."
Jaylen brown is on a long deal with great value
"Wouldn't you rather be able to say ""I called it"" believing in someone others were tearing down though? Used to get into Jaylen Brown arguments all the time on our sub with people who genuinely seemed to want him to fail, just so they could say ""I told you so.""  But doesn't being able to say ""I told you he would be good"" feel much better?"
So true king. I‚Äôll take Jaylen Brown over Steph Curry any day üò§üò§üò§
he doesn't deserve a max. give him whatever jaylen brown got in 2019
"Jaylen brown, I mean he‚Äôs still making good money but he‚Äôs not getting paid a max even though he‚Äôs definitely worth one"
"There‚Äôs been a couple of NBA players that have entered the NBA with no agents (Jaylen Brown for example, he was drafted higher than projected too). The NBAPA has been great in getting those guys the necessary help they need in regards to the NBA draft process without having an agent. I get what you‚Äôre saying, but I think the guys at the top of the draft (top 15-20) the talent and their ability is what gets them there. Most of them were on national tv in college, have been scouted by every team ect. the teams know who they are and what to expect. The guys towards the end of the end of the first round and second round picks yea definitely agents work and get those guys extra workouts, into workouts they weren‚Äôt suppose to be in ect."
"It was discussed that it was Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Salary + Picks (#14, #16, and the super-valuable-before-Ja Memphis pick) to bring AD in to play with Kyrie, Smart, Horford, and Hayward. That was unequivocally off the table once Davis had his fucking dad come out to bat against Boston.   NOLA wanted Tatum over any other player at the time.   Celtics could have easily beaten the Lakers offer by a significant gap. There was just no longer a bidding war because Davis was just going to leave in FA because the Lakers could have just cut cap space the next season and sign him outright.   Side note: KD sign+trade for Hayward was the next logical move the following season when KD wanted to come team up with Kyrie.   Think of a Jrue Holliday, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, and Robert Williams Pelicans core and a Kyrie, Smart, KD, AD, and Horford + ring chasers Celtics.   Makes me feel dirty as a Celtics fan but wouldn't it have been better for basketball? Pelicans drafted a potentially generational player and still couldn't build a competitive team with that Lakers roster."
Jaylen brown some people think hes better than tatum LMAO
"At the time Jaylen Brown was far superior to Lonzo and Ingram as far as the media viewed his potential. Those two outplayed their expectations I think by a wide margin. That being said, Tatum may also have been on the table since they still had Kyrie and Hayward. So Tatum plus picks is probably as good or better than what they got."
"yeh Lakers fans looked crazy for saying it at the time but Ingram had already shown he was, over a *short* period, basically the player he‚Äôs been with the Pelicans. The stats loved him. Brown, at the time of the Kyrie season, couldn‚Äôt start for the Celtics‚Äî not polished enough as a shooter, still giving away those automatic turnovers while driving.   Jaylen covered a ton of ground in the 2020 season to be still clearly worse than Ingram at that time. He covered even more ground before the 2021 season, to where people generally prefer him now. You‚Äôd have been reefer mad to choose Brown after the 2019 season."
"He's a 3rd-year undersized guard averaging 27ppg over the last 2 years on 59% TS. What more do you possibly want from him?  He's more efficient than Jaylen Brown, along with Jayson Tatum who you probably think is the next coming of Christ."
higher TS% than both Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown... yikes
"Because it‚Äôs a truckload of decent assets? Most good teams don‚Äôt have the assets to compete with a trade like that. The knicks and the pels probably won‚Äôt want to mortgage the future for dame. The warriors could and might beat this offer, but Lacob has been clear he wants to build for the future. The nuggets would have to trade murray MPJ and all their firsts to beat the sixers offer, and it‚Äôs not clear they‚Äôd be willing to go all in. So there are teams that could beat the sixers offer but it‚Äôs far from clear if any of them would go all in.  I don‚Äôt really see who else is realistically gonna be offering a lot. You can say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want a playoff team‚Äôs crappy picks‚Äù, but unprotected draft picks way down the line are valuable. And it‚Äôs not like some team like the magic are gonna be trading for dame, whatever team you trade him to are gonna be in the playoffs. And you‚Äôre not gonna be getting a blue chip prospect like jaylen brown."
Jaylen brown but a realistic option would be Christian wood IMO
I doubt a jaylen brown type would be available. First name to pop up is mpj but he‚Äôs quite risky
Jaylen Brown was a massive overpay at the time. Jerami Grant was an overpay too.
"There‚Äôs more factors to FT shooting than just practice. In fact, the majority of FT shooting is mental when it comes to in game situations   With 3 point shooting, a lot of the makes come down to repetition and having/creating a good jumper.   Big reason Jaylen Brown is in the 70s for FT% but nearly 40% from 3; there‚Äôs more to free throws than just practice, whereas that isn‚Äôt really the case with 3 point shooting."
Jaylen Brown ain't no PG13 or Butler....not yet at least.
Plenty of players develop outside shots once they get to the league. Jaylen Brown was a bad shooting prospect and shot nearly 40% last season from deep.   Al Horford shot like 8 3s his first 5 seasons and then became a ~40% shooter as well. Shooting can be learned. Being the perfect basketball build cannot.
Have you considered Jaylen Brown?
"Or Jaylen Brown. Who has drastically improved every year and it clearly shows.  I‚Äôve been saying for years now tho, Simmons cares more about being  a Hollywood type dude and being a celebrity than putting in work to better his game. Dude just tryna live life and I guess I can‚Äôt blame him for that."
"If I may, I‚Äôll add Jaylen Brown to that list too."
Very true. But I watched  Jaylen Brown go from offensively shit to very very good.  So these kids can def improve
I just hope Denver gets injury provisions in there.  If they could sign him to a Jaylen Brown contract that‚Äôs near max with incentives and injury provisions that would be a win win imo.
"youre not wrong.  we see super athletic wings being drafted high on physical attributes constantly under the guise of hoping they develop a shot.  but its more than just the shot.  kawhi isnt where he is because he just has a good jumper.  he has some of the most efficient handles and footwork you will ever see from a wing.  which makes his development even more rare.  but thats what every team wants.  when you have a wing with elite defensive attributes that develops into an elite offensive player, well thats simply the most valuable construct you can have.  kawhis a huge outlier, but there will be those guys who look day-and-night from their college days.  look at jaylen brown.  showed some creativity with bad spacing in college, but the shot was suspect and he came into the league getting stripped every drive.  but the development came.  lot of risk/reward.  im just sick of the analysts trying to compare everyone to kawhi/bam/dray as if they are some common player expectations."
"Honestly, if he doesn‚Äôt get offered a max he should just go to RFA. I know it‚Äôs kind of nitpicking since these dudes got paid, and likely would‚Äôve stayed with their same teams either way, but Jaylen Brown and OG are 2 guys that could‚Äôve gotten max offer sheets had they gone to their respective free agencies. The biggest thing here is the fact that he could get guaranteed money right now which would be big for him due to his previous back problems, but I think even if he unfortunately goes down with some injury he‚Äôll still get a bag thrown at him."
"Ingram is much better at creating his own shot, is a much better playmaker, is a more versatile scorer, a better shooter at all 3 levels, and Jaylen Brown off-ball defense is extremely lackluster too  I‚Äôm not being biased here but Ingram is objectively better"
We aren't really a trade match with Boston but this thread was supposed to be realistic trades not jokes. I am not even sure what a realistic trade with Boston would be but maybe Simmons/Shake Milton/Seth Curry and 2 firsts for Jaylen Brown? Obviously a trade like this wouldn't happen but it's semi-realistic
Jaylen brown
"Luka's insane on all 3 major offensive stats. His ability to pull up under any conditions and help his team is insane. Take the Olympics. His first game, he popped 48 pts in abt 3.5 quarters. The next game, he made a near triple double. Against france, he got 18 assists bc he simply couldn't score well being guarded by the DPOY.  No matter what happens, he finds a way to DOMINATE.  Spida is better defensively, but I am sure that, in 3 yrs which is the ae diff between him and Spida, Luka will be a solid defender (def not someone I'd look to to guard the other team's best player but someone who could guard a second option, like Jaylen Brown)."
"Fans aren't a wall lol.  The bubble affected the game in a lot of ways, but throw-in angle was not one of them. That throw would have been just as possible in a regular season. If anything, Jaylen Brown wouldn't have been as close to blocking the shot because he'd end up landing in the 3rd row of fans.  I'm not getting defensive, I'm pointing out that your take makes no sense."
"He hadn‚Äôt practiced for 3 months and was already playing poorly. That isn‚Äôt exactly being exposed. It‚Äôs a testament to Jaylen Brown being a really good defensive player, but it isn‚Äôt exactly exposing anything outside of him not being prepared for the bubble. I just really don‚Äôt like people treating it as him getting exposed as a player in general, when I feel like his lack of preparation was a major factor as well."
"He most definitely did get exposed by Jaylen Brown.   Vs Brooklyn, he certainly was subpar, but not that bad: 21/8/5 on 41/28/71 splits. Poor efficiency but he was still productive in other aspects.  Vs Boston he was clearly much worse: 15/7/3 on 38/12/72 splits. Jaylen Brown clearly made things much harder on him."
"He clearly fell off to another worse level vs Boston.   Vs Brooklyn, he certainly was subpar, but not *that* bad: 21/8/5 on 41/28/71 splits. Poor efficiency but he was still productive in other aspects.   Vs Boston he was clearly much worse: 15/7/3 on 38/12/72 splits. Jaylen Brown clearly did make things much harder on him."
"This narrative is dumb as hell. Siakam playing like ass wasn‚Äôt because ‚Äúhe got exposed‚Äù. It‚Äôs because he didn‚Äôt didn‚Äôt practice for like 3 months beforehand (which is on him), and was rusty as hell for the entire bubble, and played like ass against the Nets as well. He didn‚Äôt get ‚Äúneutered by by playoff defence spearheaded by Jaylen Brown,‚Äù he decided to take a long ass break after the season was cancelled, and was not prepared enough for the bubble. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an excuse for him because he should‚Äôve been prepared, but I feel like people are drawing a lot of false conclusions based off of his performance."
"You mean Jaylen Brown? Brown single handed  stopped Siakam post up iso a bunch of times, it was never in Siakam advantage to post up Jaylen‚Ä¶ it was barely a complex scheme for defense against Siakam iso for Stevens to draw up"
I mean that‚Äôs just it‚Ä¶ the limitation of Siakam being ok as a number one option in regular season but get absolute neutered by Playoffs defense spear headed with primary assignment  in Jaylen Brown.  Maybe Siakam will come back better but as it stands right now his off the dribble game is not gonna take your far as a number one option
That Celtics Raptors series was one of the best chess match in a while. I feel like Nurse came out as winner based on how much more Stevens team struggled to figure out/ not even sure if they ever figure out the zone against Raptors this series.. and that it became abundantly clear there was a gap of talent of production between Jaylen Brown and Pascal Siakam‚Ä¶ yet it took Celtics 7 games to beat Raptors
"Nance was fine playing alongside Love (PF) and Allen (C).   Situationally, Harris has defended Fs while Simmons has taken on tougher PFs like Siakam, Giannis and Zion. You've had him on guys like Jaylen Brown, Og Anunoby and Kris Middleton."
"1) Who cares if Dragic doesn't play? We're not over the tax, we don't need to worry about dumping an expiring contract.  2) That 1st still doesn't make up the difference between Simmons and Siakam.  3) You know Pascal as a 2nd option beat Simmons's team when he was as a 3rd option, right? If Pascal is a bad 2nd option, what does that make Simmons? Siakam was shut down by Jaylen Brown... Simmons was shut down by... Gallinari?  4) The Raptors didn't come out and say that, we just had an article last week about how Siakam does not want to be traded.  5) Simmons needs a team that has floor spacers. We are a poor shooting team, he's not a good fit. Maybe the Wolves or Warriors would be better for him."
"I‚Äôm just making fun of Boston fans cuz when they signed the extension for Richardson C‚Äôs fans swore it was the move to trade for Beal later and thinks Wizards will trade Beal for Smart, Richardson, and whatever else without giving up Jaylen Brown"
"What about the best 3 picks from any given draft tho - because that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking in OP (except even more tilted in favor of the 3 because those are arguably all the best players from their own drafts - curry withstanding from garden‚Äôs class) and they all developed into elite players pretty quickly (unlike for example a Jaylen Brown who didn‚Äôt really blossom into a star until year 5).  I wouldn‚Äôt even take Lebron over the best 3 players from 2011 (Kyrie, Kawhi, Jimmy/Klay) let alone the best player from 2007, 2008, and 1b from 2009"
Jaylen Brown sitting there and giving relationship advice got to be one of the funniest things I've seen in a while
Jaylen Brown  Julius Randle  Pascal Siakam
"That's what ticked many of us off last season, easy to blame Melo and Kanter but hey, at least they were on the fucking court lol. Wasting roster spots on Jaylen Hoard, Moses Brown [before the breakout] Klejin Blevins, TJ Leaf knowing full well how injury prone our guys were was genuine muppetry. That's what had them gassed by the time the playoffs rolled around in my opinion."
If the Celtics ever traded Jaylen Brown for Simmons and Osman I would throw myself off the Tobin bridge before the ink dried.
"Simmons for Derrick White and Thad Young is interesting. SAS might have to throw in some future assets.   Simmons for Gordon Hayward would be interesting if you knew Hayward would be healthy.   Simmons for Jaylen Brown makes Boston a better team, but then the 6ers need a point guard. If they can do that while getting a PG somewhere else, I think they are better. A three way trade loosely built around Horford to Cleveland, Brown and Rubio to the Sixers, and Simmons and Osman to the Celtics works on the trade machine. Guessing picks would have to go to Cleveland for taking on Horfords salary.   If Zach LaVine tells Chicago he won't re-sign, a Simmons for LaVine + stuff package would be good for both teams."
"Easy, the Celtics. They had enough trade chips, probably still do, to trade for anyone. And that team was built young. AD, Tatum and Kyrie? I haven't even talked about Jaylen Brown. Or the Raptors if Kawhi stayed. Clippers if he didn't.   I'm not knocking the trade, I'm simply saying Lebron is 36. We're assuming he plays well for years. He could drop off in 1 or 2 while AD is 30, the age where you're supposed to win chips. Not the age of forcing another trade. He did what's best for himself to get a chip as soon as possible, I'm not arguing that. Simply thinking long term."
Jaylen Brown Love Guru
"Jaylen ""Sancho"" Brown jacking this dudes girl"
"&gt;Scary Terry and Jaylen Brown, two of the best guys in the league"
I think he was part of that legendary lineup the Celtics fielded vs the Lakers last year that went -20 in 5 minutes in what was supposed to be garbage time but ended up needing to have our starters come back in to bail out of the nosedive. It was maybe the single ugliest stretch of basketball I've seen in my life. Jaylen Brown went 17/20 from the field this game with 40 points and a +36 and we still won by less than 10 because of that fuckin suicide squad
Lol people downvoting. Gobert gets abused in the playoffs. The 25th best playoff player is probably like Jaylen Brown or Khris Middleton or KAT and I'd take all them over Rudy.
lol what. jaylen brown is one intelligent ass dude and jayson is one cool ass guy. who in the right mind thought they disliked each other?
"It's gotta be within the next year though. They can't wait around more than a year with this or you risk Embiid wanting to leave and Ben's value being even less having not played for over a year. Harden, KD, Lebron, AD, Tatum, Steph, Luka, Giannis, Kawhi, PG, Mitchell, Middleton, Booker, Jokic, Butler, Trae, KAT, CP3, Irving, Jaylen Brown, and Jamal Murray all seem to be off the table. Beal seems pretty adamant on staying and Lillard maybe next offseason is on the table so maybe a possibility. Fox isn't getting traded with 4 years left on his deal. Lavine if Chicago is terrible at the deadline maybe but that seems unlikely and even then he'll be a free agent. Just feels like they are putting all their eggs in the Lillard basket and if that doesn't work out they might walk away with the same thing they would have now with a year of Embiid wasted."
"He is already in bloom, but he shall bloom more: Jaylen Brown"
Did yall fr think Jaylen Brown wasnt vaccinated
"Smart and Duncan Robinson also have the same agent. I think you're making empty assumptions about what Boston was willing to offer, as well as knowing Smart's priorities or what was available elsewhere.  For reference, their same agent is also Jrue Holiday's agent, so I think he knows about bending a current team over a barrel (Jrue's 5 for 125M with New Orleans).  Also, Al Horford's agent, so I think he knows about a vet leading Boston to secure the bag elsewhere (when Al went to Philly).  Also reps Jaylen Brown, so there's a lot of familiarity and relationship history with the front office (although Danny left)."
Is Jaylen basically saying he‚Äôs Batman &amp; that Tatum is Robin ? do Tatum &amp; Brown hate each other? Is Tatum requesting a trade to the lakers ?
Who's going to outbid that? Maybe the Celtics could by giving up Jaylen Brown plus a ton of other assets but I just don't see Stevens making that trade. Not many teams are in win-now mode with a young star to give up in a trade
"Wow I‚Äôm a cavs fan. That‚Äôs really relevant! Excellent ad hominem attack.  I have no idea how to value the difference between an associates degree and a bachelors degree, and I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs relevant. 1 and done nba players don‚Äôt even need to finish a year of college, and these guys were not exactly getting into college based on their test scores. If you really don‚Äôt think bring college educated impacts a persons education, then I guess that says a great deal about your college education. I can‚Äôt imagine how people spend 4 years in college and leave with the same way of thinking that they entered with unless you apply yourself not at all.  https://www.statista.com/statistics/1251249/us-covid19-vaccination-and-intent-among-younger-adults-by-education/  I think this paints a pretty clear picture of the impact of education on Covid vaccine rates. People who are more educated are much more likely to believe in science.  The reality is if a group of people vote for a complete moron to represent them, I‚Äôm going to believe they are morons. Nba players haven‚Äôt really done a lot to make me think these guys are particularly intelligent as a group. Yea, there are a couple like jaylen brown who I believe are educated and value education, but most of the time they come across as spoiled self centered and not terribly informed. And why would it be otherwise? They‚Äôre spoiled multi-multi-millionsire children who drop out of college."
"NBA players as a whole have just gotten a lot bigger without people realising.   It's one of the big problems with the ""younger generations wouldn't make it in our era"" argument from older players. Younger generations would tower over the older generations.    Here's Gilbert Arenas talking about the 90s vs the 00s:  &gt; ""When the 90's players talking about how y'all soft, we would have put y'all on your ass...You're little! You're a little kid! We gain weight when we're older, these mfs are 60-70 years old, 185 lbs still. Like come on now, shut up. You're not even on a diet, you're just a little guy.  &gt; ""Like I remember... Even like GP (Gary Payton), he was a defensive stopper. He was literally a defensive stopper. My second year, I'm posting him up. You're little, 185. 'I was afraid of you my rookie year, I don't know why, you're little.' Even John Stockton, you guys are little!... You were guys were defensive guys?! It became a joke, like put the two-guard on me man, these point guards are just too little. That's what people don't understand, evolution. Like, these guys are just too little, you're not gonna hurt us.""   As another comparison, Jaylen Brown was 223lb as a rookie."
Jaylen Brown
Lmao.  Definitely.  Jaylen Brown or Murray would be killers on that roster.  High % 3P shooters.  Good handle.  Brown excellent on defense.
I thought Jaylen Brown was a Jaylen? Am I missing something?
"What really sucks about this is that the remaining 10% consists of a bunch of players that are very relevant to daily media coverage.  If some bench players were the most vocal about being anti-vax this wouldn't be an issue but people look up to Beal, Kyrie, Jaylen Brown and so on. I know it's just a rumor with Jaylen but anything that's not stating ""ofc im vaccinated wym"" is bad in my opinion.  So I'd also count LeBron hesitating to outright state he got the shots is actually very bad for the NBA and the pandemic. Young people look up to these guys, hell I'm at the end of my 20s and some of these guys are role models in terms of mental fortitude and work ethic for me. The African American community in the USA has the lowest vaccination rate, NBA players sharing anti-vax sentiments are incredibly poisonous to impressionable young people. What they are doing hurts society and progression. And it also feeds old racist rethoric as Kareem stated. It's of utmost importance to trust and believe in science for NBA players that have a large following and can share their stance to the media.  I feel there's some sort of ""bro code"" regarding vaccination comments by NBA players in the sense that pro vax players don't want to throw their teammates under the bus with straight forward comments about how legit stupid it is to not get vaccinated. And that's why so many players are hesitant to call others out. I'd love to have a Superstar just come out and be very blunt about it but instead they're all like ""I understand that people do their own research and it's a personal matter"" which really puts me off at this point."
He looks like Jaylen Brown lol
"As a Jaylen Brown Stan I will say that is easy to say now but I think the Philly pick was totally justifiable. Brown was extremely raw and his upside at the time was his athleticism and intelligence. We know now that his work ethic is insane but that is said about every lottery pick coming into the draft. Predicting Simmons would turn into this would have been crazy at the time or even two years ago. That said, I'm glad you didn't take Jaylen :)"
At some point you stop defending inconsistent players. At some point ‚Äúpotential‚Äù that everyone talks about isn‚Äôt enough anymore. You‚Äôre an NBA PG and you can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt shoot the ball. We‚Äôve been propping him up for too long. We should have drafted Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown lol
"I've noticed that the more ""intellectual"" players like Iguodala or Jaylen Brown (not to mention Kyrie lol) are below average in intelligence but obnoxious about it. In a league where 90% of the players are morons they just happen to stand out. Then you have players like JJ Redick or the Lopez twins, who actually went to great schools and have brains, who are incredibly down to earth without the need to prove how smart they are."
"I‚Äôll say the same shit about white athletes( nascar athletes are just as dumb) because, at the end of the day,  they‚Äôre famous for being athletes, and that doesn‚Äôt make them smart in other areas.   There‚Äôs obviously smart people in the league like Jaylen Brown, and this doesn‚Äôt mean that they shouldn‚Äôt speak up about issues they think are important, but if someone says consistently dumb stuff I can call them dumb."
"&gt;What is the benefit to being vaccinated, but refusing to ""disclose it""? Does he think he is going to hurt someone's feelings by saying he got a vaccine that EVERYONE SHOULD BE GETTING?  Basically. Jaylen Brown gave one of those lame ""I think it's a personal choice"" answers without confirming he was vaccinated yesterday, and a lot of fans think he's just being respectful because he wants to be President of the Player's Association one day."
"I find it hilarious that Simmons has made no attempt at improving his shooting game whatsoever. It's been, what, like, at least four years since he's been in the League? Jaylen Brown has been in the League for the same amount of time, yet has made strides in his shooting, finishing, defense, *and* playmaking, while the only thing Simmons has is his ego."
Do you have a source on that because Jaylen Brown sounds like an intelligent dude.
"What really sucks about this is that the remaining 10% consists of a bunch of players that are very relevant to daily media coverage.

That honor probably goes to Jaylen Brown. Malcolm Bronson probably has a future in either politics or sustainable humanitarianism as well. There are a bunch of really bright guys in the league.
Didn't Jaylen Brown call Kyrie out on this for using the race card to deflect criticism?
2016: Ingram to Jaylen Brown 2017: Ball to Jayson Tatum Too lazy to look up the rest lol
"Ah yes, athletes such as Jaylen Brown and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar are famous for being dumb, while Arnold Schwarzenegger and Kevin Johnson are known for their apoliticalness"
2016 - Ingram becomes Jaylen Brown  2017 - Ball becomes Tatum  2018- Wagner becomes Chamet   2019 - Hunter becomes Garland but we traded him for AD  2020 - Jaden McDaniels becomes Malachi Flynn
"Can we definitely say Kyrie does more than any other player with money? Lebron does a shitton and so does Jaylen Brown, most of these upper echelon players have their own charities and give back to their community. I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôs head and shoulders above any other player in the higher pay range"
"I will be very disappointed when it's confirmed Jaylen Brown isn't vaccinated.  Dude seemed intelligent.   What a shame.  Oh, well, who has time for Jaylen Brown's idiocy when you're aboard the Ja Morant bandwagon ?"
Here you go for Jaylen Brown https://twitter.com/fchwpo/status/1442645233666232325?s=21
2016 - Jaylen Brown for Dragan Bender  2017 - Jayson Tatum for Josh Jackson  2018 - Robert Williams for Jacob Evans   Fucking yikes.
i'd be highly surprised if he is not vaccinated. [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/19/jaylen-brown-coronavirus-covid-19-nba-basketball-boston-celtics) he wrote for the guardian suggests he never took covid lightly.
Source on Jaylen Brown studying chemistry? He seems likely to be anti-vaccine so that is surprising
tatum said he's vaccinated but Jaylen Brown is still a question mark and there's reason to suspect he may be anti-vaxx. Stay tuned.
Jaylen brown took grad courses as a freshman in college
Is there something on Jaylen Brown I missed?
Idk about smartest but Jaylen Brown and Grant Williams are both smart as hell
All these feel like the Jaylen Brown contract thread all over again.
Jaylen Brown pretty easily
I was a year ahead of Jaylen Brown at Wheeler (not friends by any means) and he was definitely an intelligent guy. I remember hearing he had very high SAT scores. I also know he had offers from Duke and a couple other heave hitter basketball schools but chose Berkeley instead.
"This post inspired me to read up on the smartest NBA players and I gotta say there's some real scholars   Jaylen Brown took masters level courses and studied chemistry while at Berkeley (As someone with a chemistry degree, I'm impressed)  Westbrook apparently got accepted to Standford with a 3.9 GPA but DIDN'T get recruited for basketball or offered an athletics scholarship, just his academic merit   Grant Williams apparently got accepted into Ivy League schools but didn't go to pursue the NBA, and his mom works at NASA   Malcom Brogdan got his degree in Public Policy and could have pursued studying Law   Hard to pin how much of this is true but it was just some quick Google searches. Very interesting stuff"
"Jaylen brown, CJ, malcom Brogdon, ahh CP3?"
Jaylen Brown
Maybe he can buy Jaylen Brown a car for his birthday
"wonderful, now let's get Jaylen Brown on board..."
"Just like you'd think it'd be pretty obvious someone like Jaylen Brown or Devin Booker is vaccinated, but at the end of the day we don't know these people, just the persona they allow us to see."
"This is why I'm not convinced guys like Jaylen Brown or Devin Booker are vaccinated. They just won't say so which makes zero sense. And all the Suns fans keep saying ""the team said so"" but never link this confirmation. At least the Celtics fans admit they are speculating when it comes to Jaylen Brown."
"&gt;Jaylen Brown on getting vaccinated: ""I think it's a personal decision. I have my own thoughts about it. I respect my teammate's decisions and things like that. I know everybody has their own opinion on it. I think it's a personal choice.""  I'm pretty worried it's Jaylen after his comments today."
"I hope it isn't Jaylen Brown like some were saying, has jt been confirmed he's vaccinated?"
"Actually defensive stats make him look good, but like you said they‚Äôre notoriously bad.  He is covered on defense by Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum and they make him look good.  If you watch him, he loses his man, can‚Äôt get past screens, gets bullied even without a mismatch, doesn‚Äôt contest shots and doesn‚Äôt help well.  I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs a bad player, but he was a borderline all star at his best and was never a good defender, now he‚Äôs getting older."
"I literally typed in because of his free throws and because he jacked up more threes and you ignored the second part so you could argue.  He shows up as a decent defender on stats because he had Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum covering him lol.  He fails the eye test miserably.  He can‚Äôt contest shots and doesn‚Äôt make it around screens and is constantly bullied on ball.  Marreese Speights led the league in charges for us off the bench and he was an awful defender.  People who go out of their way to take charges do it because they can‚Äôt otherwise play meaningful defense."
"I think players who are not willing to get vaccinated should spend a day in ER to see what covid patients are going through. And, what the staff puts up with. You can hear the lungs grasping for air while the staff putting 16 hour shifts try to save your ass because you chose not to be vaccinated.   Trying going to a place like North Philly and just look at how badly covid has decimated the black community. The fact is you, in a previlaged place with the best doctors on the team monitoring you constantly, don't grasp how you're negatively affecting your own community. You're in a position to influence as Jaylen Brown has said and to talk about helping your community, you should start off by not spewing garbage.  Yes, you don't want to be vaccinated, then don't. But don't be the reason why someone else is influenced by you to choose the same path."
Jaylen brown probably the only exception to this. Mans extremely intelligent.
Tatum is already a superstar. Jaylen Brown needs to step up.
"I mean those types of players exist i just dont think they are availble. Jrue would have been a great fit, players like Jimmy Butler and Jaylen Brown playing at the 2 are great pairs for about anyone, honestly Kyle Lowry or Lonzo Ball both moved this offseason and could have slotted in to help take some pressure off Dames ball handling responsibilities during the regular season."
Respect. Honestly just included him because there‚Äôs not that many elite shooting guards (I don‚Äôt really count Jaylen Brown as a SG either)
the last time where jaylen brown pushed for a black coach some people commented that black privilege is real lmfao. I have the screenshots
"These are all during BLM, the entire league had something to say about this which is cool but he actually didn‚Äôt do anything different there by speaking out. Many players did, including Jaylen. Yes it‚Äôs disappointing they only speak up on these things when its convenient for them hence why they are silent now that we need more people to speak up for vaccination.   Yes every single one of those players disappoints me immensely as well! And I will be sure to speak about that when a thread about them is created! Don‚Äôt you worry my dude! My opinion isn‚Äôt solely based around Murray or Jaylen! So you can relax with the defensiveness.   Unlike you people I will not settle for Jamal only speaking up about one thing, players only speaking on what is convenient for them. If they truly care about society then vaccination should also be talked about. Also my point that he doesn‚Äôt portray himself as an intellectual is important, Jaylen does so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm more upset at Jaylen.   I promise you I will not be silent about this situation when threads for other players are also created so you can put down your ‚ÄúJamal defense force‚Äù helmet now.   I singled out Brown because he has gone and given speeches, spoken up about social injustices but is completely silent when it comes to vaccination. I will not support this selective activism.   It‚Äôs not ridiculous to do it on a Jaylen or LeBron post, they are even more hypocritical because they have already taken strong social justice stances but don‚Äôt say a word for vaccination. This is called selective activism, do some research on this.   This world will get no where with you guys accepting the bare minimum from the people in society who have the most influence."
Jaylen Brown will become the MVP and then the president
"in no order top 5: chris paul, steph curry, kelly oubre, ben simmons, paul george  &amp;#x200B;  honorable mention: jayson tatum, jaylen brown, serge ibaka, rudy gay"
"This is going back a while--Jeff Green. He was the centerpiece of the Perk trade and had these flashes where he looked as good as Jaylen Brown last season (so, a solid all star player).   He just never did it consistently. I'm kind of astounded his career has been as long as it has."
Give us jaylen brown for him then
I think that‚Äôs not even a red flag. Jaylen brown went to cal as a one and done and was fine. The bigger red flag would be how ben Simmons didn‚Äôt even try in college
"I think it would have to be a non-American player to really be this. Giannis as you said, Luka, and  maybe Jokic could step up as well. I just don‚Äôt think any America‚Äôs players are really the ones to look to. At least not the major ones. Jaylen Brown would be the exception that comes to mind though"
Jaylen Brown is way too high
Jaylen Brown is still severely underrated
I love this.  I'm a big believer in Jaylen Brown.
"Trae will have more career success than Luka early on, then Luka will go to the Hawks in free agency 2025 to team up with him. They‚Äôll make the finals but lose to a tough Nuggets team led by Nikola Jokic, who gets his first ring and has an alltime great playoff performance where he knocks off a solid Blazers team, the prior year champion Lakers, and an on the rise OKC team led by young studs Emoni Bates, Josh Giddey, and Amari George. Luka and Trae then proceed to win the next two finals, but fail to threepeat due to the poetic basketball of the Warriors which serves as the last hurrah for Steph, Klay, and Draymond but is a coming out party for young stud Jordan Walsh. Luka then returns to the Mavs, forming an intense rivalry with the Celtics who have added walking mismatch and former MVP Zion Williamson to their already all-NBA core of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Bob Williams. The Mavs somehow triumph against the Celtics in Luka‚Äôs second year back, making him a Dallas legend. After a few years, he goes to the Lakers where he wins another chip and cements himself as a potential GOAT. By this point, Trae has retired largely due to recurring ankle injuries but is considered a top 10 PG of all time."
What woulda been best is if they maxed Jimmy and traded Simmons at his peak value. They could have gotten a Fox or Jaylen Brown level player I bet. But the spacing would have been pretty atrocious with Embiid Butler Simmons all on the court.
Jaylen Brown can't be the #2 guy on a championship team.
Jaylen Brown will soon be better than Devin Booker
PG Curry Harden Luka Dame Trae  SG PG13 Kyrie Booker Beal Lavine  SF LeBron Kawhi Butler Middleton Jaylen Brown  PF Giannis  KD AD Tatum  Zion  C Jokic Embiid KAT Gobert Adebayo
And the fans - watching the sixers self implode is so enjoyable. Also seeing Ben Simmons value reduced to rubble while Jaylen brown continues to excel is just beautiful
Tim Hardaway Jr &amp; Jaylen Brown
Do you seriously take Beal over Jaylen Brown?
"The entire argument can be summed up into 1 sentence: Jaylen Brown plays great defense, Booker plays above replacement level defense at best.  The only thing that could change my mind is a huge scoring or playmaking gap, but that doesn‚Äôt exist. They more or less put up the same numbers, with Booker having more success in the playoffs right now but not much else in his favor."
Jaylen Brown gets overrated because he pants with Tatum and people group the together as near equals
I‚Äôm curious for the argument of Booker being below Jaylen Brown.
You guys should watch the entire video. It‚Äôs actually pretty entertaining with Iso Joe cooking and John wall talking shit to jaylen brown   https://youtu.be/ljQrRhnYTfA
"Pretty sure jaylen brown is known to be one of the smartest guys in the NBA, i would be shocked if he isn‚Äôt vaccinated"
"He's a troll with a massive hate boner for Jaylen Brown, best to ignore him"
Lmao when did Jaylen Brown come into play
He‚Äôs going to better than Jaylen Brown by March
"We're not talking about a random b, lmao. Your experience is irrelevant to the conversation. Even more so if you're not a POC.....no offense of course.   &amp;nbsp;  We're talking about player experiences.   A team with fans who were so racist Bill Russell didn't even want to get his jersey retired publicly.   Kyrie came out and talked about his issues with the fans as well. So did Marcus Smart, Tristan Thompson, and I believe Jaylen Brown did as well."
"Harris looked like he could be a big scorer/star, he was really good around the rim + he could shoot. He was on the Jaylen Brown trajectory, not a role player trajectory.  Otto always projected to be a high level role player, and that's what he was at his best."
"Lol if you watched the video, he was clearly holding back laughter. Look up ‚ÄúJaylen flat earth‚Äù and you‚Äôll see articles talking about how he was joking and linking to his tweets which make it even clearer   https://nesn.com/2017/09/has-kyrie-irving-convinced-jaylen-brown-to-become-flat-earth-truther/"
Jaylen Brown is my favorite player in the entire league purely on his personality and intelligence alone. Not my favorite basketball player for being a basketball player though.
"Tbh if the Celtics were to hire shite coaches, mismanage the roster, struggle making it out of the 2nd round and get in an ugly dispute with Jaylen Brown, I would actually be happy for Tatum to ask out of that mess lol"
I bet it's Jaylen Brown. I read somewhere that he's into all sorts of weird conspiracy shit.
i think the celtics would have had a chance against philly even without Jaylen Brown.
Then put harden dame and Ingram as the team adidas too or kristaps or jaylen brown
Dude I loved this. Big Jaylen Brown fan
He was above average. Khris Middleton was really good. Jaylen Brown was really good.

Bruce Brown on the Nets  Ibaka for the Clippers  Jaylen Brown for the Celtics

Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown is gonna be in my fucking nightmares
HOLY SHIT JAYLEN BROWN!?
What the fuck is Jaylen Brown.
JAYLEN BROWN
JAYLEN BROWN MY GOD
JAYLEN FUCKING BROWN BABY
Jaylen Brown put on a masterclass just for everyone except Grant Williams (ironically) to sell
Poor Jaylen Brown
Jaylen Brown ain't an OG stopper.
Anyone else get annoyed by Jaylen Brown? He's like obnoxiously political
Jaylen Brown is insanely talented.
jesus Jaylen Brown is extremely unguardable
Jaylen brown is PG 2.0. damn that drive was smooth
Is Jaylen Brown usually this streaky where he disappears or did we just clamp down on him?
Why does Jaylen Brown only have 3 points in the past quarter and a half?
i hope Jaylen Brown can recover from that mauling
Jaylen brown
jaylen brown
"Wish woah woah, you don‚Äôt seriously believe Simmons is currently the best player from the 2016 draft, right?  Jaylen Brown is significantly better at a minimum."
That sounds nothing like Jaylen Brown
"I always said when jaylen brown was hurt it really fucked over the Celtics. If he and Tatum stay healthy the East is gonna have a lot of good matchups. Bucks,Nets,Knicks,Celtics,Heat, 76ers the league is looking good."
"In your opinion then, Donovan Mitchell or Jaylen Brown ?"
Jaylen brown is a much better player than Tatum. I‚Äôve always thought this and always will
Jaylen Brown putting on a masterclass this half just for Tatum to play like poo
Look at how this team looks with jaylen on the bench..it‚Äôs official; jaylen brown is the leader and best player on the Celtics.
Jaylen Brown gonna check in and immediately hit 2 3's in a row
Celtics need Jaylen Brown back in
Don't wanna overreact but Jaylen Brown might go for 70.
Jaylen brown just had to throw a pass that wasn‚Äôt absolutely awful and that woulda been a bucket
Jaylen brown is your moms favorite player and you should listen to her
Jaylen Brown winning the scoring title this year
So torn between watching my Hornets lose or watching Jaylen Brown go off. Love watching him play and hope he keeps this up so he gets the recognition he deserves.
Remember when Brad Stevens would ice a hot Jaylen Brown to give Kemba 10 horrible shots? Good times.
Jaylen Brown jesus
"knicks: *switch kemba or fournier or rose onto jaylen brown*  knicks fans: ""how is he so good???"""
Jaylen Brown got 20 in the 1st üò≥
Is Jaylen Brown as good as Giannis? Or KD? You think?
"Jaylen Brown is just as talented as Tatum, yeah I said it."
Has Jaylen Brown confirmed that COVID-19 is a Hoax?
"Jaylen Brown, silky smooth."
[Knicks defense after first quarter Jaylen Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZuvKp3OFIs&amp;ab_channel=MemementoM)
knicks outscored jaylen brown by 9 points
Fucking D up Jaylen brown guys.. dude got 20 already wtf
"Jaylen Brown, one of the most intelligent players in the league, absolutely going off"
not liking the jaylen brown experience
"I feel like it was a Celtics player, maybe Jaylen Brown, but I can't quite recall.  Unless this is a joke going over my head lol"
Is Jaylen Brown the best player in the NBA?      Yes.
Not to overreact but Jaylen Brown is clearly winning MVP this year
"Jaylen ""Jaylen Brown"" Brown is living up to his name"
member when jaylen brown was overpaid?
I fucking love Jaylen Brown
JAYLEN BROWN IS COMING
Jaylen Brown is fucking amazing
"Jaylen ""Fuck Evan Fournier"" Brown"
Jaylen 'Paul Pierce' Brown

Jaylen Brown
"This is silly. Neither of them were hit hard. People have died from COVID, many have needed to be hospitalized. Jaylen Brown is feeling ‚Äúawesome‚Äù after having it just a week ago."
My comp for Kuminga is Jaylen Brown. He played just like Jaylen did when he was at Cal. Both super athletic freaks who were/are super raw
"This dude could have had a team with Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Mikal Bridges, and Jimmy Butler around him the last 3 years. Theoretically if we take it that far could‚Äôve had Jrue still there too lol  That‚Äôs fucking bonkers."
you would rather have Bam over Jaylen Brown?
"22-year-old scoring a moderately efficient 24ppg.   47.5% from the field, 37.1% from 3, 57.3 TS%. He's not a chucker by any measure.  It's a very fair request.   Looking at all +24ppg scorers ‚â§25-years-old from last season:    Player| Age| PPG ---|---|---- Zion Williamson| 20 | 27.0 **Collin Sexton**| **22** | **24.3** Luka Doncic| 22 | 27.7 Trae Young | 22 | 25.3 De'Aaron Fox| 23 | 25.2 Jayson Tatum| 23 | 26.4 Devin Booker| 24 | 25.6 Donovan Mitchell | 24 | 26.4 Jaylen Brown| 24 | 24.7 Karl-Anthony Towns| 25 | 24.8   I just don't see how Sexton doesn't clear 100m easily if he can keep it up. If you're in that age bracket and you're in that scoring bracket, it's a no-brainer.  We're not even talking about a 5-year max either."
You‚Äôd miss a lot of good posts. Like the one of Jaylen Brown giving a lecture. If I can filter out individual comments tho I‚Äôd be juuuust fine.
"I have an old tweet where I trashed the Jaylen Brown pick. I wanted Jamal Murray at the #3 spot.  Every so often someone digs it up like ‚ÄúHMMMM????? HOWD THIS WORK OUT‚Äù. I still stand by feeling that way at the time, I‚Äôd still take Jamal Murray."
Jaylen Brown.  Great on defensively and very good offensive player.  Man came into the league with a suspect shot and dribble and has developed into an all-star player.   His yearly improvement &amp; work ethic has been tremendous.
Jaylen Brown
"Jaylen Brown, I know I'm biased, but for me, JB is the best option here"
"Obviously, Jaylen Brown."
"Which one? That Ainge would have never let Philadelphia draft Tatum or that Simmons was followed by Ingram and Jaylen Brown, not Lonzo and Tatum:"
Same people clowning on Ayton wanting a max are the same people who were clowning the Jaylen Brown extension as a bad contract. You‚Äôre spot on.
"Guarding Giannis man-to-man has never looked good for any defender, he demands a herd. But I still feel Ayton deserved that Pascal Siakam, Jaylen Brown type of contract. He hasn't proved more than they did on their rookie deals."
"Adebayo, KAT, McCollum, Simmons, Jaylen Brown, Ayton, are all borderline All-Stars in my book don‚Äôt know that being a top 25 player is that reliable when the players in the  20-35 range is so subjective and fluid."
You generally sign this kind of contract based on potential. People were pissing themselves when Jaylen Brown got a big 2nd deal and he made them look silly like 3 months later
"This post is about Jokic and his leadership. I think leadership and all of that is fickle in the NBA, they don‚Äôt actually care about being a leader they just care about money. A real leader doesn‚Äôt let a dumbass go about saying harmful shit that puts others health in danger.   What low standards we have to define a leader. Some things are just way more important than basketball, none of these players really understand that so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs appropriate to appreciate their leadership.   Low standards, low bar I guess. Reminds me of Jaylen Brown."
Only option now is to trade him to the Celtics for Jaylen Brown or maybe to the Hawks for Capela/Hunter/Collins and picks.
"Mikal bridges deserves it very well. He can creat off the dribble a lil, great 3&amp;D player, and does all the little things. He‚Äôs like a baby kawhi or a jaylen brown. There‚Äôs not many of those players in the league currently."
"I'm a Celtics fan, so I think there's a good chance I'm more tuned into this matter than you are. Back in 2018, Jaylen said that he didn't like taking pills or medicine in general. Then, during this past off-season, Danny Ainge mentioned that a few of the Celtics' players weren't vaccinated, one of whom opted against taking the shot because of his personal beliefs about medicine. That unknown player could obviously be someone else, but then you have the fact that Jaylen refused to say whether he's vaccinated, and then he literally just got COVID last week. If he is vaccinated, there's no reason to keep it a secret like this,.especially after he got COVID  At minimum, there's a very very good chance that Jaylen is not vaccinated (aka anti-vax), which was my only point. Given this uncertainly, it makes no sense to praise Jaylen Brown while shitting on anti-vax players in the same breath."
Did like nobody watch the grizz last year ?   J3 took a major step back. Isn‚Äôt this contract basically a Jaylen brown equivalent?
"Feels like the Jaylen Brown extension who got paid because of his potential despite underwhelming production and now his contract looks like a steal.  JJJ clearly has tons of upside, he just needs to stay healthy."
Starting 5  PG - Steph SG - Klay  SF - Kawhi PF - KD C - AD  Bench Harden Devin Booker Jaylen Brown Bam Embiid
"Steph,Harden,KD,LeBron,Lillard,Jokic,Giannis,CP3,Mitchell, Tatum,Trae,Bam,Butler,Davis,Kawhi,PG13,Embiid,KAT,Irving, Jaylen Brown,Beal,Luka,Booker,Lavine,Zion,Shai,Murray,Jrue, Lowry,Ayton,Middleton   Those are 31 guys I would rather have on my team if I where trying to win a championship"
I really want Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum to be a thing
"Jaylen Brown: *extremely insightful speech about the concepts of social homogenization, control, and conditioning and how they are reinforced through surveillance, youth counseling, and mass media*  Also Jaylen Brown: ""Science majors know that hydrogen is in everything. Hydrogen is an element of life. When they finally confirmed that there was life on Mars, it's because there was hydrogen particles found in the soil. Alright? And for hydrogen bonds to change forms, they must break those bonds. And how you do that, one of those adhesives is heat and pressure.""  The duality of man at its absolute fullest display ü§£ I love you JB but you probably should have run that one by literally any science major on Earth"
"Jaylen Brown is one of the few athletes that is actually worth carefully listening to outside of bb. That being said, I'm not sure if I agree with the non-necessity of being in an institutional environment to achieve success."
"Bruce Brown, Jaylen Brown, Moses Brown, Sterling Brown, Greg Brown III, Troy Brown Jr: they are all actually uh wait a second never mind, I pass, pay no heed to my flair"
"I don't understand why you would refer to Isaac, Beal, and Irving as idiots in a comment praising Jaylen Brown. The common thread among those three guys is that they're anti-vax, but isn't Jaylen anti-vax too? I know he didn't specify whether he got the vaccine, but all the evidence seems to indicate that he didn't. So I don't understand why you would make this comment, when you're clearly at risk of contradicting yourself."
"So if this post is about Jaylen Brown, why is Kyrie‚Äôs name anywhere near it?  Because now you‚Äôre making this about Kyrie instead of Jaylen"
"Not sure if anyone posted it yet, here is the full unedited video of Jaylen Brown at Berkeley  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXbg0v377Bw"
I think he‚Äôs just saying it‚Äôs weird. In a post about uplifting Jaylen Brown it‚Äôs just kinda weirdo shit to be like ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not like (insert other guy with a very loose connection here)‚Äù
Don‚Äôt forget his teammate Jaylen Brown: Is brown
"It's a shame that the general media focuses on the voices of guys like Kyrie instead of the really bright folks they have in the league, like Jaylen 'Noam Chomsky' Brown (I didn't know he was into this stuff).   Also... it's a shame that Noam Chomsky couldn't ball like LeBron."
"I never think it's too late to rule out a Wiggins' breakout season. He's still one of the best driver/finishers at the wing, he's really improved his shooting, and his defense has become positive. If he were to get more paint touches I could see him being a Jaylen Brown level all star."
is Jaylen Brown speaking about being pro-vaccine in this video? how do we know Jaylen is even vaccinated when he caught COVID last week?
nobody even knows if Jaylen Brown is vaccinated. he tested positive for COVID just a week ago
Klay Thompson would be a Hufflepuff prefect for sure.  Jaylen Brown - Ravenclaw  Chris Paul - Slytherin  Kemba Walker - Gryffindor
Jaylen Brown is who Kyrie thinks he is.  Shoutout to JB for actually reading Foccault's work. That shit was a drag.
"I want Jaylen Brown to teach me stuffs, I want to be his student. He's so fking smart."
"ok then use JJ Redick. he articulated being pro-vaccine yet nobody uses him as an indictment on why other white athletes don't do the same  yet yall use Jaylen Brown to compare other black athletes and say ""see why can't you be more like him?"""
"you're getting downvoted but Jaylen Brown being black is 100% the reason why some of these ""articulate"" comments are being made.  Imagine if it was ""Kyle Korver speakers at Berkeley"" and the replies were ""Meanwhile we got loud idiots like Isaac, Beal, and Irving"" ""Wow Kyle Korver is so articulate"" LOL"
"trae, lavine, beal, jaylen brown‚Ä¶ lamelo. damn he probably is an all star"
Jaylen Brown scored 22 in the first quarter against the Knicks lol
Herro cooked Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart in the NBA Eastern Conference finals  But he's playing against scrubs...
"Meanwhile:  &gt;Brad Stevens on Marcus Smart's comments last night: ""When you see [Marcus] &amp; Jayson sitting down eating breakfast together today &amp; talking about how to find our solution for our team... those guys want to win""   and:  &gt;Jaylen Brown responds to Ime Udoka‚Äôs criticism of his uneven performances: ‚ÄúIme came and talked to me about it [Thursday],‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt bother me. It‚Äôs mind-boggling to me, too. I was surprised that my body didn‚Äôt respond the way it normally responds. I‚Äôm usually able to have that zip, that pop, flying up and down the court, but it wasn‚Äôt there. I think that was obvious, I don‚Äôt think he was out of line or anything for that.   We've got drama and guys underperforming like crazy but at least they seem to be taking the criticisms on board."
"That Celtics team had Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, and Terry Rozier **coming off of the bench**. How did we go so wrong‚Ä¶"
This has got to be the last season of the two Jay's. It's not working out. And Jaylen Brown is clearly the better player.
"Yeah Ainge defenders will point to Tatum/Brown and say how any team would love to start a franchise with those two. That is completely true and Ainge and his staff deserves a ton of credit for getting too young potential super stars.  However, what else on the roster is all that exciting? And do they have pieces that really fit together? And honestly as Jaylen becomes a better scorer I actually don‚Äôt think him and Tatum make the best sense next to each other.  This roster is so far from being completed"
"I said this elsewhere in this thread, but Boston had legit chances to trade for all of the following players: Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Chris Paul. I feel like any one of those guys would have been huge difference makers. And I know Boston fans always say that would have compromised the future by giving up on Jaylen Brown, but honestly does the future look that bright as it is? I feel like the Celtics could have made actual legit runs at a championship, but you guys didn't because you didn't want to part with one or both of ""the Jays"". It was the wrong move, IMO."
Boston needs playmaking and they are struggling right now. Does a trade  built around Jaylen Brown and Ben Simmons make sense?
I think you guys need to find a Jaylen Brown but a taller one at that instead of Tatum
"Lol there's this clip from The Bachelor/Bachelorette where the woman took the man to the Celtics training facility back when Jaylen Brown was a rookie, and they shot around with JB and Rozier. The dude literally said ""This guy is one of the best players in the league"". This is when Jaylen was so raw, if he were a steak he'd be mooing.  Edit: https://www.facebook.com/theScore/videos/jaylen-brown-terry-rozier-make-cameo-on-the-bachelorette/840698366286418/"
"&gt;Jaylen Green  Brown?? lmao  I'm assuming you're saying that you have those guys as the net tier down after the sub-superstars: AD, Jimmy, Kyrie, PG"
"Trade idea:   Sixers get:   * Dame Lillard  Blazers get:   * Jaylen Brown  * Marcus Smart   * Tyrese Maxey  * Two Sixers 1sts  Celtics get:   * Ben Simmons  * Norman Powell  * Seth Curry  * One Sixers 1st  Sixers get their guy, run Dame/Milton/Green/Harris/Embiid  Blazers reset and remain competitive by running Smart/McCollum/Brown/RoCo/Nurkic   Celtics revamp and remain competitive by running Curry/Powell/Simmons/Tatum/Williams"
"So what you‚Äôre saying is they should trade for Ben Simmons. He ticks all the boxes. Playmaker, scared to shoot. Good defensively, huge, and historically durable.   I‚Äôm guessing Jaylen Brown has to go the other way in that deal though."
"Your team's problem is you will have to pay kevin porter and Jalen green one day. Both of them do the same thing. Jaylen brown is a capable defender though. You would still have cap space to sign a max contract for 2 more years. Now you got a core of Jalen green, Brown and Christian wood plus a  max level player.   The Celtics now got cap space again to do Celtic rental like signings they love to do since John wall contract finishes."
it's crazy that a few years ago Boston looked like a dynasty with Kyrie/Jaylen Brown/Tatum/Hayward/Horford with Smart and other assets and now they look like a middling 4/5 team with ECF as best case possibility
Jaylen Brown for Ben Simmons would be the perfect trade.
"Fair enough lmao, this dudes comments are just so bad though. He legitimately believes Jaylen Brown is the worst starter in the league &amp; is always talking about trading Jaylen + picks for Norman Powell &amp; other players of that caliber"
sell high on the bonafide stud that is jaylen brown
I think people need to understand that there‚Äôs a talent limit on players and they can‚Äôt simply become good at something just by practicing it. At some point expecting Jaylen Brown to become an effective passer will be like expecting Rudy Gobert to become a great 3 point shooter.
"Problem is, they only do it in spurts and when things are going well.   Through 3 quarters of that game last night, our offense was *great*.   But Tatum and Brown, and mainly more Tatum, as he's the one with the ball in his hands, and Smart too has issues with this, they panic when the game gets tight and they stop running their offense and it's fucking infuriating. Tatum defaults into his ISO hero-ball mode, Smart goes ""I got this"" and starts launching up 3s, and meanwhile Jaylen, who IMO deserves the least amount of blame, as he has actually tried to make improvements in this regard and generally plays within the team concept, just stands around and watches as we shit the bed in the clutch. The issue with Jaylen not being more of a featured player in the clutch is too often his handle lets him down and that makes it difficult for him to get the ball at the end of games when opposing teams are pressuring him."
"Not the guy you‚Äôre replying to, but Jaylen is more of a team player and a better defender. Tatum‚Äôs ceiling may be higher, especially on offense, but the past 2 two seasons have just been him being a ball hog, and taking contested mid range shots he barely makes, with the occasional statement game that makes fans think he‚Äôs growing before he regresses to the mean.  Couple that with the fact that we would probably get a better package for Tatum then if we traded Brown, at this point in time I‚Äôm higher on keeping Brown than Tatum."
The issue is they‚Äôre banking on Jaylen and Tatum to will the team to the Finals. Give up Brown - it‚Äôs the only way forward.
Jaylen brown is doing very well but Jayson Tatums efficiency has been shit this season.
"Jaylen Brown is 25, not 30."
"I've always been on the Tatum &gt; Brown train (despite Jaylen being my absolute favorite person in the NBA on and off the court) because of Tatum's ability to just take over and score at will, but that's looking more and more like it's actually forming bad habits. Melo is a fantastic comp and I think Jaylen just does more to help us win now. Not to mention he continually takes leaps each offseason"
"Pelicans also have a boatload of picks. Warriors could give Kuminga, Moody, Wiseman, and picks. Maybe the Celtics panic and make Jaylen Brown available because of all the dysfunction there.   also, the difference between Simmons and Dame is bigger than Maxey and Thybulle. Whatever 3rd team is paying for Simmons could be just as likely to pay a little more and get Dame instead"

I feel as though the Celtics have been the same team since Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum have been on the team. They need a new view. Boston is not it. Blow it up and rebuild!
I'm not. Why would the Rockets take that? What does Jaylen Brown do for our team?
"This is what I say to my friends too. At their peak, Tatum is obviously better, but Brown is easily the more consistent of the two. I know exactly what I'm getting from Jaylen nearly every single game, but who the hell knows if we're gonna see aggressive driving and unstoppable Tatum or inefficient chucker Tatum."
"I think they messed up is by  having so many high level guards and then letting them walk out for free while Tatum and brown were on their rookie contracts.   They're in no man's land. Your cap is maxed and your players are great but they aren't named durant, or giannas. Should just trade brown for everything the rockets have. Take John wall, Kenyon Martin Jr and Kevin porter u just got a 1 2 and 4 postion for jaylen brown."
"Surely some of this has to come down to the organization bleeding talent since that series right? They went from Younger Horford Kyrie Hayward to Theis Kemba Hayward to Older Horford Schroder Josh Richardson. Sure some of the young guys have come along during that time and Tatum and Brown have grown, but it's tough to maintain a high level of performance when you have key pieces leaving every season and your talent keeps downgrading. I don't think I'm being a super biased fan when I say the Raps have one of the best FOs in the league and even they couldn't avoid bottoming out for a season after losing Kawhi, Danny, Marc, and Serge. It's hard to replace top level talent.  I'm not saying that the roster with Kyrie was a good fit chemistry wise, or that the 2020 playoff roster with Kemba and Hayward didn't have its flaws and injury struggles, I'm just saying those groups were deeper and more talented around Jayson and Jaylen, and that counts for something too."
"I've been hearing this logic for over a year now. Timelines DO NOT MATTER in the NBA. Championship windows are extremely small and most often these ""solid"" teams end up accomplishing nothing. Do you think you will ever win a championship with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown as your two best players? The answer is NO, but since they ""fit the timeline"" apparently it's okay. If your team had traded Brown for Harden back when he first asked for a trade you'd never be in this situation."
Can‚Äôt wait for Simmons to mention us between talking about Tatum greatness and how jaylen brown is untradeable
"meh dude formed a roster of  kyrie irving, jaylen brown, jayson tatum, gordon hayward, al horford, terry rozier, and marcus morris  thats a really fucking good team. like.. really good lol.   but got hit with basically worst case scenario and then the celtics were too content with not making moves after it fell apart  while he made mistakes, he did legitimately form an amazing team in 2018. just unfortunate that it didnt work out"
"Wow, I felt the opposite. I was most worried about Jaylen and Kemba. Felt comfortable with Smart and Tatum knowing they‚Äôd be more likely to shoot them out of the game (smart took quick shots, Tatum iso‚Äôd). Almost certain the game plan for Spo was to let Smart shoot and hope he gets hot early, then hijacks the offence late game. Felt like that happened in all of our wins that series. Brown killed us when they actually moved the ball."
"i get the point you were trying to make but they are completely different players in completely different situations tho  however, jaylen brown is a much better player than tatum these past two and half years‚Ä¶he has his holes but that‚Äôs a guy who can be plugged into every team in the league and not distrupt a team one bit"
The amount of Ben Simmons for Jaylen brown takes are sickening.
He seems hell bent on outshooting Jaylen Brown whenever Brown‚Äôs outplaying him.
The fact of the matter is that the Jays just aren't that good. Jaylen Brown in particular is one of the most overrated players on this sub.
If it were up to me I would keep Jaylen Brown and trade Tatum away while his hype is still high. Tatum is probably better now but Brown has always had the athleticism to have a more versatile scoring game and play better defense.
I never seen Jaylen Brown talk so much trash till tonight. Mans had sum to say after every 3. They Had To Take The L. 81-1 babyyyyyyy
Jaylen brown said essentially the same thing in an interview
"Coddled is probably the wrong word, but sports media pretty much left it alone, Jaylen Brown was one of the most critical people of that quote and he plays for the team. I feel like more people(athletes, fans, media personalities) should have spoken up."
Ok alright we‚Äôll bring Jaylen Brown home to Atlanta in exchange for some picks and some guys who can pass &amp; shoot.
Because Jaylen Brown is good at PR. Without the good PR the Celtics would be scrutinized as well.
This has also become my spicy take this year. It feels like Jaylen Brown just keeps improving and I think he‚Äôs better than Tatum now.
Him and Jaylen Brown were throwing chairs all over the locker room arguing lmaooo
"Okay then, what about:  Playing Richardson almost the entire fourth quarter alongside smart (two worst offensive players in our current rotation, that are completely redundant together)  Having a nine man rotation less than ten games into the season and giving almost 1 healthy scratch a game to our younger players like nesmith and pritchard who showed potential last year and balled out in the summer league   Completely freezing out brown in second halves and having their offensive plan be just give Tatum the ball and watch him take shit jumpers   Benching Jaylen for almost the entire third quarter and half of the fourth tonight   Playing lineups that either have double bigs or lineups where our tallest player on the floor is 6‚Äô5   Do you want me to keep going because I can."
"Friendship ended with Ben Simmons trade, Jaylen Brown trade is my new best friend"
It's not an overpay until the late 2nd/3rd year. People said Jaylen Brown was an overpay way too soon and he's more than earned his contract.
Hey look its the jaylen brown troll
&gt; The Celtics could offer Jaylen Brown for Simmons  How many unprotected picks you throwing in?
For jaylen brown no less lol
"Not really. He's the perfect no.2 but the problem is Tatum isn't a good no.1 Jaylen Brown is a damn good player, don't get me wrong but he's been the same type of player the last 2 seasons."
No.  But if I can speak Jaylen Brown to the Magic into existence I will be all for it.  Isaac  and some firsts for Brown would make me happy.  But it'll never happen
"They won't because they shouldn't. Both are super young and locked up for the near future. Only real reason would be is if the two didn't like each other.  With that being said, I'd trade and swap the next 4 draft picks and players for Jaylen Brown. Would make so much sense for this roster."
"Yeah, I'd say Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown would be a fair trade"
"Jaylen Brown will be requesting a trade within 12 months, after that inevitably turns into a trainwreck Tatum will be next."
Wow Jaylen Brown is +1 and Tatum is -24. That‚Äôs wild
I‚Äôll always say the Celtics misuse Jaylen Brown. He could have 100 points in the first half and then only attempt three shots the rest of the game
Jaylen Brown is contagious
