"&gt; Raul Neto, Isaac Bonga, Anthony Gill, Robin Lopez, Cassius Winston, Garrison Matthews, Jerome Robinson, Jordan Bell, or Alex Len  oh my fucking god"
"We missing like 6 key guys lol ... Beal was playing with a bunch of bad players who shot worse than him.   Like do you want Raul Neto, Isaac Bonga, Anthony Gill, Robin Lopez, Cassius Winston, Garrison Matthews, Jerome Robinson, Jordan Bell, or Alex Len taking those shots instead?  Neto, Lopez, and Matthews are probably the only players there that may get playing time if the team is healthy."
"Best team here tbh.  PG: Raul Neto, Cassius Wintson, Westbrook   SG: Beal, Garrison Matthews, Isaac Bonga   SF: Avidja, Troy Brown Jr., Jerome Robinson   PF: Rui Hachimura , Davis Bertans,  Anthony Gill   C: Robin Lopez, Mo Wagner, Thomas Bryant"
"Kendall Gill, Rex Chapman, Jamario Moon, Anthony Mason, Keyon Clark, Orlando Woolridge, Clarence Weatherspoon,  Dan Majerle, Darius Miles, Jonathan Bender"
My man Anthony Gill with some garbage time points!
"Oh lawd, anthony gill"
Kendall Gill   Rex Chapman   Vernon Maxwell   Anthony Mason   Craig Hodges   Cliff Robinson   Craig Ehlo
"The Wizards have shooters. They aren't being utilized correctly. See below with 2019 3p % stats:  Bertrans (42.4%), Beal (35.3%), Neto (38.6% and 45% this season so far), Bryant (40.7%), Rui (28.7% but shooting 100% this year so far), Deni (NA but shooting 47.6% this year so far) can all shoot and probably in that order for efficiency  Then you have guys like: Troy Brown Jr (34.1%), Isaac Bonga (35.2%), Ish Smith (36.7%), Robin Lopez (33.3%), Moritz Wagner (31.3%), Anthony Gill (NA but he can shoot from what we saw in preseason), and Garrison Matthews (NA but he can shoot from what we saw in preseason)  All these dudes can shoot too.  The problem is you need some semblance of an offensive scheme generating semi-open looks and the Wizards don't have that."
"They have a few other end of benchers - Anthony Gill, Ty Jerome, Kyle Guy"
2 people voted for Anthony Gill
"Of course not, then we'd have to get rid of \*checks notes* Anthony Gill"
"Yea I mean I noted why he shot chucked. It was bad shots but hard to blame him. I would go insane if Anthony Gill, Chandler Hutchinson and Ish Smith can't stop chucking.  They are there to set picks and defend. Not to shoot."
Anthony Gill playing crunch time minutes ? TANK SZN
I'd argue he's better than Anthony Gill
"Anthony Mason, Kendall Gill, Kelly Tripucka, Rex Chapman"
"Anthony Mason, Kendall Gill, Kelly Tripucka, Rex Chapman"
You got lucky Brooks decided to put Russ and not Anthony Gill on Giannis
Anthony gill
"He wasn't bestbrook imo. He was more like ""solidbrook"".  He's had much better games.   And guys fucking relax. I stan for Russ. I'm just being realistic here. We were more amazed by Anthony Gill tonight than Russ.  It's not shade. Just the game."
Alex Len and Anthony Gill are a combined 13/15 for 28 points. They've both hit a 3 despite both of them being 24% shooters
Aight who is Anthony Gill and why is he destroying us
"i haven't seen the Wiz on this win streak, but are they seriously winning with a starting lineup of Alex Len, Anthony Gill, and Raul Neto?"
"The 2013-14 UVA basketball team that swept the ACC was surprisingly stacked despite zero 5* kids. Malcolm Brogdon, Joe Harris, Anthony Gill (plus future 1st round pick Justin Anderson off the bench).  Happy that Gill is finally getting his shot. Wish that Brooks would play him more, dude's such a hard worker"
Fellow unbiased opinion  MVP - Bradley Beal  DPOY - What’s defense  6MOTY - Davis Bertans  MIP - Daniel Gafford  COTY - Russel Westbrook  ROTY - Anthony Gill maybe Deni Avdija
anthony gill might be good?
Anthony Gill for First Team All NBA
Anthony Gill looks like if Enes Kanter and Danny Green had a kid
"GOATFORD, Neto, Anthony Gill."
"I'm glad we got gafford ... but our roster sucks in general ...   We're deciding between starting Raul Neto, Davis Bertans, Isaac Bonga, Chandley Hutchison, Anthony Gill, and Garrison Matthews at the starting SF spot ..."
Anthony gill should start wizards in 5
I think Anthony Gill is the only player I’ve never heard of.
"I mean this just completely disregards everything other than height wingspan and advanced stats lol. It disregards team chemistry, continuity. They’re in the playoffs because of the lineup they are playing. They are going to continue to play it. They are the 8th seed. Starting Anthony Gill “cuz stats” ain’t the way. You continue to do what you do, adjust your defensive schemes but not completely change your lineup, and honestly hope the 76ers have some bad games because you’re fighting an uphill battle anyway.  Shit like this that works on paper is completely irrelevant in reality. Not only would it not work and make the team worse in every other way, the coaching staff would never do it because it’s a dumb idea out of left field that is gonna end up not working anyway but make them look 100x worse for annihilating the only thing that was working for the team."
That’s if you guys can get past Anthony Gill and the Wizards.
Maybe we’ll see some anthony gill!!
"Unless you’re Westbrook, in which case you can average 11.7 APG and still not be considered a consensus top 5 playmaker because Anthony Gill can’t handle your passes"
LOL he called Anthony Gill Alex Len
"And called Anthony Gill,  Alex Len.  Which is even worse"
I'm just here to watch Anthony Gill
"Gafford, Neto, and Russ are probably the best defenders. Maybe Anthony Gill as well.  Problem is Russ is usually too gassed to defend. Like Beal last year (and this year)."
"Not defending Brooks, but if you have a basketball dilemma like guarding Jayson Tatum and your answer is Anthony Gill or Chandler Hutchinson, that problem remains unsolved."
Anthony gill is the best player nobody has heard of
I thought free agent wise he's mostly hit more than he's missed. Neto and Lopez both outplayed their contracts last year. Even Anthony Gill panned out well. But all of those contracts were low risk high reward. He hasn't had the opportunity to make a higher risk signing yet
"And it's just really random if you look at the drafts. Guys just never really had superstar leaps. Kenny Anderson, Terrell Brandon,  Greg Anthony, Kendall Gill, Dennis Scott, Nick Anderson, Chris Jackson, Rex Chapman were all super talented lottery prospects that flashed but for a multitude of reasons didn't come close to becoming great players"
"Anthony Gill averaged 8 points last year in Euroleague and got signed. Can’t just look at Euroleague stats the same way we look at NBA stats  Not saying anything about Thanasis’ deservingness, just pointing out that stats aren’t everything"
"Ok how about we trade you:  Anthony **”The Goliath”** Gill   For…  **”All we had to do was follow the damn Train, CJ!""** Ellerby  Deal?"
"Rui, kuzma, bertans, montrezl, anthony gill"
"UVA fan here, he was always half fan favorite half running joke at UVA - he's just slow and goofy but always loved contact and had a soft touch shooting the ball to go with surprisingly good post moves.   Still, he never played more than like 15 minutes per game and was firmly 3rd-choice forward behind Anthony Gill and Isaiah Wilkins his senior year. I'd be shocked if he can stay on the floor defensively in the NBA. He's tall and can board and sometimes score but he's just so damn slow (that being said, watched some of Slovenia's games and he does look lighter on his feet than in college somehow)."
Anthony gill played about 30 games but he didn’t have that many minutes but he was good in college
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
"Anthony Gill was Virginia basketball legend, he was on the same squad with Malcolm Brogdon and Joe Harris iirc"
Am I a casual if I have no idea who Anthony Gill or Caleb Homesley are?
Anthony Gill I know. Who’s this Caleb Hobo?
"If Westbrook was as good as people think he is, they would have won more games with him and Bradley Beal.   Getting thumped in the first round was pretty much expected for anyone with a realistic assessment of this Wizards team. They have a weak bench, zero positive defenders (except Anthony Gill) and only one star scorer"
How did fans overrate him to all defense team when he literally made the all defensive team this year 😂😂😂. He did it with like by far the lowest minutes out of everyone too.   Comparing him to a g-leaguer is a pretty terrible take. If his defensive talent was really “a dime a dozen” than  bad defensive teams would prob pick those guys up right?   Do you really think the worst defensive teams in the league have just been sitting on their ass looking at all those “all defensive g-leaguers” and thought hmmm we should just stick with our 12th man ya know some 28yr scrub like in the wizards case Anthony Gill who can’t contribute anywhere.
"Depends, if he's paired with Anthony Gill he has a chance"
"Anthony Gill a shooting guard?  Wut?  He’s a 6’8 power forward with an ok shot.   This team is garbage. It’s Beal and a bunch of role players. Like every other guy here is a fine 6-8 man, so I guess they’re deep in some strange sense of the term, but 4 of them are going to start. They’ll struggle just to make the playoffs."
"&gt;warriors haven't been a great defense without curry-klay-dray-(iggy/bogut/durant),   As I mentioned above, they were the #5 defense in the league *last year* without Klay, Iggy, Bogut, or Durant.   And let's not act like KG's teammates were ""barely in the NBA"" either:    KG managed a below-average defense with Chauncy Billups, Terrell Brandon, Wally Szerbiak, Anthony Peeler, and Laphonso Ellis. Not Ellis and Peeler aren't household names but you're talking about guys who had decade+ long NBA careers. Nor are Troy Hudson, Rasho Neshovic, or Kendall Gill guys who were ""barely in the NBA.""  Or you've got the teams with Latrell Sprewell, Ricky Davis, Sam Cassell, etc.  I just find it hard to fathom how you're claiming he was surrounded by guys who were ""barely in the NBA"" while conveniently forgetting (despite the fact that I talked about it upthread at length) what Draymond did *last year*. Because if you actually want to talk about guys who are ""barely in the NBA"" shouldn't we lead that list with Juan Toscano-Anderson, and Damien Lee, who were two-way contracts as recently as 2021 and 2020, respectively?"
Deni Avdija has just received the nickname “The Denitentiary” for his lockdown defense and I am **all for it**  Something more obscure though that I’ve seen is Mount Gillimanjaro for Anthony Gill lol
