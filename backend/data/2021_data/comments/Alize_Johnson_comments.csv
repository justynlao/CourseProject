lol these highlights are with Alize Johnson and Reggie Perry guarding Durant but still the hype!
But is he better than Alize Johnson?
All this to beat Alize Johnson
Nets are still doing a good job. Claxton is looking great for a second rounder. Tyler Johnson was a waiver guy and he’s been extremely useful role player for this year. Too early to tell but Alize Johnson might have some value. Marks consistently kills it on the scrap heap and the two first round picks he’s had he hit on well in the 20s with levert and Allen. Then obviously dinwiddie and Harris off the scrap heap and developing dlo
Idk if Blake takes away those Alize Johnson minutes we might’ve won! Haha
"To be fair, I look at the players that played last night. Joe Harris, Alize Johnson, Bruce Brown, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot...who the fuck are these players??? I've never heard of them."
"The reporter was clearly asking Bullock the other day about the Nets' Big 3 of Jeff Green, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, and Alize Johnson."
Fuck myself we got crashed in the boards by joe Harris and alize Johnson
"Give Alize Johnson that last roster spot, dude deserves it"
Nets got Alize Johnson to a 10-day contract.  They can't keep getting away with this!
1. I didn't realize the Nets had Alize Johnson. 2. He's playing well and might be another end-of-the-bench Pacers player that finds a niche with another team (Niang). Good for him!
Alize Johnson is so much better than TLC it’s not even funny. I’ve seen enough. Cut TLC and give Alize a regular contract
"GG bulls. Griffin and Aldridge as a combo to start may be a bit slow, so Claxton + Griffin / Aldridge could work better. On the other hand, if I were the coach, I would give more minutes to Alize Johnson and reduce TLC's minutes. Just food for thoughts."
"we got Alize Johnson, best forward in the league, so it's fine"
"You’re telling me guys would be down to play 2 weeks after the deaths of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Spencer Dinwiddie, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, TLC, Claxton, Alize Johnson, Bruce Brown, Chiozza, and Perry? You’re out of your goddamn mind.  And I used the Nets because they have the most stars, but the same is applicable with every team. You don’t have a mass casualty event like that and just keep playing like nothing happened. I know money talks but no league is that insensitive."
Alize Johnson with 5 rebounds in 4 minutes. Honestly hoping we sign him for the last roster spot if we can't get anything from the buyout market
You’re right. It’s Alize Johnson
You mean How much help does Alize Johnson need?
That's the all time leader in single Season PER Alize Johnson for your information
Wtf? Alize Johnson had a 23/15 game? That's like his career totals in Indiana
"You watch, I bet Alize Johnson will have his first dunk in two years during his first game with Nets.  Book it."
"real talk if otto porter doesnt get bought out, then its gonna be that g-league kid we just picked up, Alize Johnson aka 6'7 Lamar Jackson. a 6'7 wing that for some reason rebounds like crazy and brings hustle. a perfect 15th man"
"I just saw a picture of Alize Johnson for the first time, and that's actually Jimmy Butler, you think I'm dumb?"
Who is going to be in the rotation over BOTH Aldridge and Blake? Jeff green? Alize Johnson? Deandre Jordan?   Claxton is the only one that might. But he’s young and probably won’t play in the playoffs.
"Let's not forget the Nets trade away Caris Levert, Jarret Allen and Taurean Prince for Harden, then Kyrie switch to the SG role while Harden switch to PG role.  This all happen when Dinwiddie, the only good PG they have left was injured.  After that trade, Nets sign Andre Roberson (defensive SG), Iman Shumpert (another SG), Alize Johnson (wing player) Blake and Lamarcus (big men). None of them are PG. Until the Harden injury which the Nets sign Mike James as a stopgap measure until Harden return.   So yes, it was clear that Nets intend for Harden to be the playmaker."
"Nets have played 27.  In order of total minutes: Joe Harris, Kyrie Irving, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, James Harden, Landry Shamet, DeAndre Jordan, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Kevin Durant, Tyler Johnson, Nicolas Claxton, Blake Griffin, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Chris Chiozza, Taurean Prince, Reggie Perry, Alize Johnson, LaMarcus Aldridge, Mike James, Spencer Dinwiddie, Andre Roberson, Norvel Pelle, Tyler Cook, Rodions Kurucs, Iman Shumpert, Noah Vonleh"

"good point :)  well, if Nets hand't stolen Blake and Alize Johnson, their woes in the front court would be assesed more frequently than now.."
"This is legit the worst thing about the team  They can't get a board for their lives. Some of it is expected as they play a lot of small lineups, but they just have low effort guys with poor instincts who stand around and ball watch while some midget on the other team out hustles them. Only dude on the team who can get a goddamn rebound is Alize Johnson but I guess Nash hates him now"
Alize Johnson &amp; Bruce Brown
First Alize Johnson and now Oshae Brisset popping off. Raps development team doing a really good job.

Incoming Alize Johnson 30 and 30
"When you consider that Durant missed over half the year, harden is going to miss about half the year, and kyrie will probably end up missing around 20 games I think we did absolutely surpass expectations. I mean I’m guessing you don’t watch us much. Guys like Tyler Johnson, claxton, Bruce brown, shamet, now Alize Johnson, blake, also now mike James have been huge rotation players for us the entire season and he got all of those guys for virtually nothing.   Like we’ve literally been playing backups and random g/league guys for most of the year and they’ve been playing heavy minutes. We’re currently like 11-5 when only one of our stars play. We’ve had 34 different starting lineups.  This teams been making due with random guys all year"

who tf is alize johnson and how the hell did he get 21 boards and 20 points?
Alize Johnson
Alize Johnson with 20/20 off the bench. The revenge game was real
Shoutout to Alize Johnson with the 20/20 game
Alize Johnson
Pathetic performance by the rest of the guys outside of KD and Alize Johnson. KD shouldn't have played that much in the 4th with a back to back tomorrow. Also enjoyed LeVert vs Durant in the third quarter.
Give Alize Johnson the Max
Who tf is alize johnson?
Alize Johnson - 20 points and 21 rebounds
Alize Johnson is no joke. Sean Marks is amazing.
Why does Alize Johnson have 12/14 midway through the 3rd?
Alize Johnson is feasting goddamn
Alize Johnson revenge game
Alize Johnson is playing well for the nets too.
These 10 days getting full time contracts is great to see from Raptors fans  Freddie Gillespie (obviously)  ex-raptor Rondae Hollis Jefferson to the Blazer  Raptors 905 guy Alize Johnson to the Nets  and don't forget Oshae Brissett who is making an absolute name for himself with the Pacers
"Norvell Pelle, Noah Vonleh, Jordan Bell, khem Birch, Zach Collins, Henry Giles, Alize Johnson"
PG: Dinwiddie  SG: Harden  SF: Alize Johnson  PF: KD  C: Claxton
"but the real bullet the Celtics are dodging is Alize Johnson, [who is also out tonight](https://twitter.com/malika_andrews/status/1385689059037753344)"
Alize Johnson
"Without Kyrie it'd be Shamet, Harris, Green, Blake, DJ, Brown, TLC, and Alize Johnson..."
"The Sixers needed to put in their starters the last 5 minutes of the game to close out Landry Shamet, Alize Johnson, Bruce Brown and Tlc. That's quite pathetic and embrassing. You aren't winning anything when your second best player can't hit a jumpshot and your second best offensive weapon is a marginal 20 ppg scorer. The 76ers realistically aren't a threat to the Nets, EVERY nets fan knows that and see the Bucks as a bigger adversery. The 76ers are the most fraudulent team in recent memory."
Alize Johnson breakout game incoming
"Bruh they had to put their starters in for the last 6 minutes and the Nets still cut the lead down to 6 with Alize Johnson, Bruce Brown and Tlc. The Sixers aren't a realistic threat to the Nets."
"They made some huge roster changes this season and very quickly became the one of the favorites for the championships. As a result they have a lot of bandwagon fans that don’t really know too much about basketball or the team and those people are the most toxic. I don’t see that as a reason not to like them though. Just have a sense of humor about yourself and the team and you’re better than 90% of other people that started following this year.  The team itself is very entertaining to watch. Of our big three, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and James Harden, all of them have very different play styles. Harden is a monster of a point guard, very good at getting buckets and even better at assists. Kyrie is one of the best ball handlers playing the game today and his playing is always smooth. Durant is almost as famous for his antics on social media as he is for his bball skills and the man is on many lists as one of the top three players. He makes the difficult look easy, a master of his craft.   Besides the superstars, there’s Joe Harris, one of the best three point shooters in the NBA having the best year in his career. They have three young players, Alize Johnson, Shamet, and Nic Claxton, with a lot of hustle whenever they come off the bench.   Basically, it’s a team with a very new roster and high offensive potential but glaring defensive weaknesses. It’s a great opportunity to watch three future hall of famers play together."
"Really infuriating and perplexing to see Claxton only getting 8 minutes. And where the fuck is Alize Johnson? Green is playing horribly. Hornets are bringing a ton of energy and we are doing 0 to match it, primarily because these two geriatrics are doing fuckall on both ends of the court."
How much help does alize Johnson need
Don't forget Alize Johnson
Alize Johnson
I mean you guys were up 12 when you had to send Simmons and Embiid back in. Timothé and Alize Johnson then cut it to a 3 point game against them not your bench
Its funny cuz they were doing this as Alize Johnson made it like a 3 point hame
Lol they couldn't stop Alize Johnson
Alize Johnson plays hard as shit.
"Alize Johnson is our secret Embiid stopper. I'll take that.   2nd game of a back to back, missing 2 stars + 3 rotation guys. I liked the effort."
I’m sure the 76ers didnt have much game plan to stop the 3rd string.  As Danny Green suggested you hold back players to make it harder to game plan for them going fwd.  Same applies.  Who has plans or notes on Alize Johnson.
"Someone remind Alize Johnson what fucking sport hes playing, dudes a headcase and hes gonna hurt someone one day"
Well I am a fan of this Alize Johnson fella.
Alize Johnson straight up tackling people the whole fourth quarter
"You mad at him for telling the truth?? JV Nets went on a 21-2 run Embiid and “play defense” simmons in. What you think would happen if that’s KD/Harden in instead of TLC and alize Johnson, G-league MVP giving y’all hell this 4th quarter?"
"Alize ""the Bulldozer"" Johnson literally just started charging headfirst into anyone and anything and it worked for some reason"
"ok i realize the issue with alize johnson is the guy will foul of the game soon, but still that intensity is refreshing"
They chanting KD sucks and they can barely beat Alize Johnson
Alize Johnson has the same exact face as Tyler Johnson’s. It’s eerie
Alize Johnson is gonna be real nice for the Nets’ bench in the playoffs
"Alize ""Just bought my mom a house"" Johnson is secretly #3 of the big 3; KD is a hologram."
Alize Johnson being +17 in this game is fucking weird
ALIZE JOHNSON IS A GOD
ALIZE JOHNSON
Alize Johnson bringing that fire get it dawg
Alize Johnson looks like a character from the dark crystal
Is there even a point of playing Kyrie here? A win is very unlikely and I’d like to see how guys like claxton and alize Johnson play with more minutes.
The Alize Johnson game
"I love basketball, and even if the best of the best players in the world aren't on the court, I still enjoy watching these type of games.  Guys who might not have gotten a chance to play in a ""normal"" season are getting opportunities and making good on them. It's awesome to see.  &amp;#x200B;  Take Alize Johnson for example. He was out of the league at the beginning of 2021. Played a string with the Raptors G league team, helping them to the league's best record this year.  Brooklyn needed bodies, gave him a 10 day contract, he had a huge game in his debut, they signed him to another 10 day and just this week they signed him to a three-year deal. The 2nd and 3rd years aren't guaranteed, but he could make 4.1 million if he sticks.  Plus, and this is really neither here nor there, he does some good things with his money - check out his [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alize_Johnson#cite_note-24). It's hard not to be really happy for Alize Johnson!  So, I feel y'all who don't want to watch the games if the stars are out, but there are still some great stories and some (relatively) great basketball taking place every night."
Alize Johnson
"I don’t understand the logic right now. The nets are not in a win now situation.  They retain the following players for the next 2 seasons: - Kyrie Irving - Kevin Durant - James Harden - Joe Harris  They have the following under contract for next season: - Spencer Dinwiddie  - DeAndre Jordan - Landry Shamet - Nicholas Claxton - Alize Johnson  They potentially lose: - Blake Griffin (Starter minutes) - Bruce Brown (Bench/Starter minutes) - Jeff Green (bench/starter minutes) - Mike James (Bench Minutes) - Reggie Perry (Reserve) - Timothe LC (Reserve) - Tyler Johnson (Reserve)  Most of the expiring contracts are Minimum contracts or the MLE. The nets are in an ok spot going into next season, and they don’t need starter minutes they need decent or even meh bench minutes. They’ll be able to attract ring chasers. This is not a win or bust season. Keep James Harden healthy.  Even though I may be biased as a bucks fan it’s illogical to push someone injured to play, like a lot of nets fans are. Getting AD this season and KD from 2019 vibes."
Alize Johnson and Cabarot deserve more minutes
"You could make nearly 10 NBA-viable teams out of that draft. Not necessarily in complete ranking order:  1. Trae, Luka, MPJ, JJJ, Ayton  2. SGA, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Bagley, WCJ  3. Brunson, Trent Jr, Huerter, Miles Bridges, Robinson  4. Graham, DiVincenzo, Huerter, Brown Jr, Williams  5. Nunn, Robinson, Shamet, Vanderbilt, Bamba 6. Melton, Walker, Okogie, Tate, Wagner 7. Simons, Milton, Allen, Diallo, Alize Johnson 8. Holiday, Carter, Troy Brown Jr, Svi, Eubanks 9. McLaughlin, Chiozza, Kenrich Williams, Gary Clark, Metu 10. Trier, Bates-Diop, Hutchison, Khyri Thomas, Watanabe  The last few aren't amazing, but there's some decent role-players in them, which is pretty great value considering that's 50 players listed there."
"The 2018 draft is making bank this year. Multiple TRUE superstars at the top, and 20+ picks of incredible long term starter caliber and rotational depth. This is gonna be a hell of a redraft to mock in 10 years.  Some of the guys who just showed FLASHES this year... Alize Johnson? Hamidou Diallo? Anfernee Simons? On top of the established talent from the draft.  What a draft..."
"The funny thing is everyone besides Blake, Mike James and Alize Johnson were on the roster at the beginning of the season."
"Nets should offer Alize Johnson, take it or leave it"
"That would be true if the Harden trade was made last offseason vs during the season.   Nets lost Dinwiddie to injury and then gutted their depth for Harden.   Brooklyn had 3 open roster spots to fill with players that all 32 teams didn’t want to sign in Free Agency. Sure they got Blake but he’s nowhere near the player he was. Got lucky again with Aldridge and then he retires shortly after due to health reasons.   Nets had 3 open roster spots and they signed Blake Griffin, Mike James, and Alize Johnson. That’s not a plethora of riches once Aldridge retired.   Bucks had the advantage of putting their team together mostly in the offseason when the market still had quality talent in it to sign.   Nets this offseason have some options to build out their roster since they could have anywhere from 2-7 open roster spots.    Dinwiddie is most likely gone since he seems to want a larger role and his first real payday. Nets giving Dinwiddie around $18-20m per year (like he wants) would be like $35m a year when you add in the Luxury Tax.   Hopefully the Nets can work out a Sign and Trade so they can get a Trade Exception like the Celtics did with Hayward since Brooklyn is capped out.   Nets would also have the 2y/$7.4m Bi Annual Exception as well as the 3y/$18m Tax Mid Level Exception (which can be split I believe) to sign Free Agents this upcoming offseason.   Besides Dinwiddie the Nets also have Jeff Green, Blake Griffin, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, TLC and Mike James as Free Agents.   I think Bruce Brown and Jeff Green are most likely to stay with Blake Griffin the next on the list. Mike James comes down to his Euro Team and if he’s released since I think Nets could re sign him because he’d be a cheaper backup PG option vs what Dinwiddie would want."
"The Nets became villains when we formed a big 3 of TLC, Alize Johnson and Mike James"
"Alize Johnson is out, i think that evens it up"
As a Nets fan it’s a bit different.   Nets didn’t put their “Big 3” together until Mid-Season.   The Nets had 3 open Roster Spots created by the Harden trade they needed to fill with players that all 32 teams decided not to sign in the Offseason.   You add in Dinwiddie’s injury and the Nets essentially lost their entire 2nd Unit between Trade and Injury.   At one point the Nets roster looked really good when they had Aldridge and Griffin. Once they lost Aldridge to retirement it became Blake and 2 random guys in Alize Johnson and Mike Johnson.   This offseason Nets should have the 2yr/$7.4m Bi-Annual Exception as well as the 3y/$18m to fill out their roster.   Dinwiddie could also provide them with some Cap Space if he agrees to a Sign and Trade to create a Trade Exception similar to Hayward in Boston.   That would open up the market for Dinwiddie while also providing the Nets with a way to fill out their roster while being capped out.   If the Nets were running out this roster it would be different.   * Kyrie - Dinwiddie    * Harden - Brown   * Harris - Shamet    * Durant - Griffin   * Aldridge - Claxton
"Oh no, they'll run more Claxton/Griffin at center and put Alize Johnson as the backup 4. The humanity."
Time to unleash Claxton and Alize Johnson aka Bimbo Jutler
Oh shit Alize Johnson might get a ring.  Forgot he was on this team.
Alize Johnson so underrated
ALIZE JOHNSON
"It’s such a deep class too. You got Gary Trent Jr, Jalen Brunson, Mitchell Robinson, Shake Milton, De’Anthony Melton, Alize Johnson all carving out solid careers or showing flashes as second-round picks. 2018 might just turn out to be one of the best classes ever tbh."
Claxton and possibly Alize Johnson as well.  Bruce Brown was pretty much another find - traded Rodions Kurucs for him and also got some cap relief.  Fans of opposing contenders want to pin it on luck because the alternative reality is harder to deal with - that Brooklyn’s success is repeatable for a long time to come.
"While I was watching the game I felt Nash should had started Mike James, Alize Johnson and Tyler Johnson instead of the big 3.  This confirms it!"
"Nash is way better than Kenny. Ask any Nets fan, the people who actually watched Kenny Atkinson coach. Kenny was a worse version of Bud (no adjustments, terrible rotations). He was great at developing players but he was not a good in game coach. If he was as good as this sub think, he wouldn’t be getting passed over for so many head coaching positions.   Levert, Allen both had positive things to say when they were traded. Role players like Mike James, Alize Johnson, etc. have never felt isolated. Even when DJ got benched by Nash, he didn’t throw a tantrum. The culture problem that people think the Nets have only exists based on their feelings towards the Big 3 plus Blake."
[Alize Johnson](https://twitter.com/SNYNets/status/1374938802268078080)
"Barely anyone has said this. We all know what his issues were and we stand by them. Of course we're going to wish him the best, he's a nice dude.  The only people who are saying they never criticised him are people who barely go on the sub, and thrive off of negativity. We have like the most negative sub, every game thread had typical people who would complain and blame for no reason.  If you actually pay attention and go on our sub, you'll see that the main belief is that it was time to part ways.  Y'all motherfuckers don't watch us play.  Dude never utilised our shooters. We were 30th in 3-point attempts and I think 30th in FTA. He spammed PnR, even when Brogdon was driving into Bam. He liked ISO hero ball, with Oladipo handling the ball for 20 seconds before taking a long 2. He made no adjustments and let runs go on too far. We collapsed every 3rd quarter. He lost the locker room. He had no inbound plays, Brogdon even complimented Bjorkgren on drawing up plays. We never played our young guys, just look at Alize Johnson, Georges Niang, or Edmond Sumner.  His system works for Trae Young and Clint Capela, but it didn't work for us. You build a system around your players, not the other way around."
Alize “Jimmy Butler” Johnson gotta be one of them lmao
Alize Johnson
"Championship - speak it into existence! More likely a first round exit but I can’t stand the people saying we gave up our future to be perennial first round exits. We kept Coby White, who averaged 15/4/5 on 40/35/90 shooting splits in his second year!!! We kept our prized possession: Patrick Williams, who we’re banking on to succeed just like any other team with young talent. We picked up young prospects who still have the potential to be something in this league such as Tony Bradley, Alize Johnson, Troy Brown Jr. etc...we have two first round picks this year (our own! and Portland’s lottery protected FRP). This isn’t me just drinking the Kool-Aid, we’ve been rebuilding for awhile now and it wasn’t working so the new FO said fuck it, we’re going to compete and build a team around Lavine, who we believe has superstar potential, while also keeping a solid young core intact to fall back on if this iteration of the team fails."
"It's significant improvement. Even with all the injuries and stuff, Nash didn’t have faith in his bench and went 7 deep against the Bucks for much of the series, playing KD insane minutes. the remaining 8 from that bench are no longer with the team. Alize, Perry, Chiozza, DeAndre, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, TLC, Shamet replaced by Mills, Aldridge, Millsap, James Johnson. Just with their level of IQ, they'd see floor time imo."
"Patty Mills, Paul Millsap, Lamarcus Aldridge, James Johnson, Javon carter, D’andre bembry, Sekou Doumbouya, Cam Thomas, Day’ron sharpe, Kessler edwards is a massive upgrade on Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Alize Johnson, Luwawu-caberet, Reggie Perry"
"Wait. I just realized we have enough Johnson in the league for a starting 5  Tyler Johnson, Stanley Johnson, Keldon Johnson, Alize Johnson, James Johnson  At long last! We have 5!"
"We signed Alize Johnson and Stanley Johnson yesterday, bringing the guaranteed contracts to 15. We also have Matt Thomas on a non-guaranteed training camp deal. There's no more spots."
"Stanley Johnson, Matt Thomas and Alize Johnson would be a superstar"
"DeRozan, Stanley Johnson, Alize Johnson, Matt Thomas. All these former Raps is this a coincidence lmao."
Stanley Johnson AND Alize Johnson?  The Bulls are smart. They're getting the Johnson &amp; Johnson so they can't get COVID.
Alize Johnson and probably Okafor
"First Alize Johnson, now Stanley Johnson. Nets are just collecting defense specialist that Raptors cut."
Alize Johnson sounds like a pornstar name
"Alize Johnson is a playable centre? Hm, okay."
As it stands Nets roster looks like this:  Harden - Mills - Carter Irving - Brown - Thomas Harris - Bembry Durant - James Johnson - Alize Johnson Griffin - Claxton - Jordan - Sharpe  That’s fifteen. Would need to move someone. A lot of fans keep pointing to Alize Johnson as the odd man out but if I were Marks I’d stick Sharpe on the Long Island Nets for the year. The two have a similar skill set (rebounding) but I trust Johnson’s ability to defend more than Sharpe’s.
Alize Johnson. He put up buckets in very limited time with the nets.
Nets.   They literally need an entire 2nd Unit and all they’ve done is re sign Griffin.   * Harden - Carter? - ??   * Kyrie - Cam Thomas? - ??   * Harris - Kessler Edwards? - Alize Johnson   * Durant - Griffin - ??   * Claxton - Jordan - Day’Ron Sharpe?   That is not a good roster so far.
An injury to DeMar and Zach and Bulls are fucked either way. Coby isn’t changing that. He is currently stuck behind 3 players in minutes no argument. You don’t waste that talent while you trout out Alize Johnson as your number 1 big rotational player.   Right now Vuc is easily more valuable in terms of losing due to injury then one of the guards. Bulls lose Vuc and they have absolutely no big depth to carry.
"Still questions on whether Coby can be a consistent scorer too. He averages out to 15-20ppg, but he gets in his head quite a bit on 3pt shooting. I think he pans out though, he's got the skill &amp; overall mentality.   Vegas rates us at 7 on the moneyline, I think that's honestly pretty fair. The thing that's underrated is some of these bench pickups. I've really liked Javonte Green, Alize Johnson, and Troy brown Jr, their production has been key to our 4-0 streak imo."
"The Bulls need a big man off the bench far more than they need another scorer. Donovan has been staggering his lineups so Derozan or Lavine are always in. Alize Johnson has played well, but having him essentially be our big man depth off the bench is going to be trouble against teams like New York and Utah who have solid big man depth."
Alize Johnson is the man
"&gt; Thad Young, a guy who has played all of 9 minutes for the Spurs so far this year and who figures to play kind of deep in the rotation this year (and hey, he was great for Chicago last year but the great year screamed a one-year-wonder, sell-high situation)  I don't think that's due to Thad being over the hill, or overperforming last season. Thad has had a very good 14 year career doing largely the same things he did in Chicago last season. His style of play, numbers and impact were in line with his career averages, and his efficiency was up (in my opinion) mostly because he came off the bench and beat up on bench units as opposed to starting for most of his career.  If he was still in Chicago I have no doubt that he would be a big part of the Bulls' rotation, taking minutes that are currently going to Alize Johnson who has a grand total of 53 career NBA games under his belt. Thad's lack of usage for SA this year seems far more related to the Spurs beginning a full on youth-focused rebuild than him being finished.  That said, it was entirely a fair price to pay for DeRozan. I think anybody claiming that Thad + a 1st round pick for DeMar was an overpay listens to too much Lowe Post and is significantly overrating the impact that his poor defense would have on an overall team, and underrating the impact of his playmaking and shot creation.  I don't really care about the first 3 quarters here, but having another guy for Chicago to trust in close 4th quarter situations is *huge* in taking the burden off LaVine to win every single game."
"This team is so much better than this time last year. Lonzo, DeRozen, Caruso, Alize Johnson, Ayo Dosunmo are all new to the team this off-season.  Vucivic, Javonte Green, Troy Brown Jr joined at the trade deadline last year."
&gt; How has Alize Johnson been?  Good enough to make us not hit the panic button but not good enough to be the long term solution for Vuc’s backup.
I thought he's been the only guy that's a little disappointing so far. Those moments against the Raptors down the stretch were kind of concerning for how his defense will fare come playoff time.   I hope Chicago can acquire a solid defensive big to back him up. How has Alize Johnson been?
"I'm sorry, what ? Caruso is an amazing bench player, okay. Then afterwards none of these players would play minutes in the playoffs for a contender.   Coby White is the 7th best player on this team and he's shot 40% from the field in his career, he's not a good player. Then who ? Javonte Green is very average and hasn't played a lot of NBA basketball, I know Alize Johnson as a Nets fan, lots of potential but he's still very raw. He has only played in 50 NBA games and it's his 4th season. TBJ is average, Bradley is average and Ayo is a rookie.  You say that's a very good bench, I say that's a very bad bench and in the playoffs you will have to play liabilities a lot of minutes. One major injury and the team falls off hard"
"Troy brown jr, Alize johnson, and tony bradley all seem decent. The thing is though they run small lineups most of the time and it still seems to work out so far even against the cavs"
Alize Johnson
"The bench is pretty solld 1-3 but so thin on the front line we are playing 6'7"" Alize Johnson as the backup center right now.   He definitely plays bigger than that, but it makes for such a small lineup out there, I can't imagine it's sustainable."
"Why do you have green as a point guard? Lol.  Also I haven't seen Alize Johnson play anything but center, so idk why u have him as a 4."
Zach is filthy.  Alex and Lonzo...so good.  Having demar to take pressure off zach..so good  Vuc...so good  Alize Johnson...so good  Bulls defense....so good
"Kinda wish Bulls kept Gafford, Lonzo/Caruso would've been nice for him. TBJr is alright but who knows maybe they could've signed him as a FA instead of Bradley/Alize Johnson"
"last season we played mostly drop with Vuc, with better perimeter pressure defenders like Lonzo and Caruso, especially playing the passing lanes like we showed against the first game against the cavs, especially with more defensive minded bench pieces like Alize Johnson, Troy Brown Jr, and Devonte Green, you can't say our roster has become worst defensively."
"That's true, OG is one of the best defenders in the league.  My point was that the Bulls have recruited a ton of good defenders. Even if they aren't as good as OG (and very few players in the world are) guys like Caruso, Lonzo, Troy Brown, Javonte Green, Derrick Jones, Tony Bradley, Stanley Johnson, Alize Johnson, Pat Williams - up and down the roster Chicago is filled with lengthy, athletic wing defenders who can help offset the deficiencies of LaVine and DeRozan.  Toronto went the other way by finding solid two way players."

We can't afford Theis so we're putting our chips on Tony Bradley and Alize Johnson. Honestly keeping Theis would probably put us in Miami category because it shores up our shallowest position right now. Hoping Alize and Bradley are okay as rim protectors
"He might fuck around and make it to. I think we have two roster spots left. One for sure is going to Alize Johnson, he’s been rock solid. Thomas hasn’t shot amazing but he isn’t scared to shoot and can get his shot up quicker than anyone else on the bench, defense isn’t his strong suit though. If Coby was healthy he’d be useless but we might could use his shooting. Ironically It’ll probably be between him and Stanley Johnson."
Pacers draft well? Let's take a look....  2020 - Cassius Stanley  2019 - Goga Bitadze  2018 - Aaron Holiday and Alize Johnson  2017 - TJ Leaf and Ike Anigbogu  2016 - Georges Niang  2015 - Myles Turner and Joe Young  2014 - Nobody  2013 - Solomon Hill  2012 - Miles Plumlee  2011 - Nobody  10 years worth of draft picks and Myles Turner is the only one who has made any significant noise for the Pacers.

Devon Dotson Alize Johnson Matt Thomas Mario Simonovic Troy brown jr
"We’ve got Simonovic and Alize Johnson, but tell me more about the team *I* follow"
Right now this Bulls team is probably one of the most likeable groups I can remember. But every time Alize Johnson is on the court I cringe at how out of place he looks. Dude just doesn’t belong in the NBA.
"Meanwhile the Pacers (before this year) have drafted:  Cassius Stanley (cut after 1 year)  Goga Bitadze (a Center, when we already are starting 2 Centers, barely plays)  Aaron Holiday (traded him after 3 mediocre years for a pick upgrade to get Isaiah Jackson)  Alize Johnson (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Houston)  TJ Leaf (absolute trash)  Ike Anigbogu (barely played, cut after 2 years)  Georges Niang (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Philly)  Caris LeVert (pretty good pick, but we traded him)  Myles Turner (hey, we got one right)  Joe Young (barely played, cut after 3 years)  Solomon Hill (left after 3 years, was ok)  Miles Plumlee (played 14 games here)  Kawhi Leonard (awesome pick, so obviously we traded him draft night)  Davis Bertans (another good pick we traded draft night)"
"Can't give up a GOAT prospect for someone like this guy. If they really wanna play hardball, Alize Johnson can be added"
"RIP Alize Johnson, his body couldn't tolerate this much of awesomeness."
"How bout Alize Johnson, Matt Thomas, a Pizza hut coupon and 2 2nd round picks?"
Surprised we haven't seen any Alize Johnson?  Honestly I've thought he looked better than Bradley the past couple games although it feels like we've been playing small most of this game

"We have 11 players 6'7"" or shorter according to ESPN.  Thankfully 8 of them are 6'5"" or taller but it's still a big gap between 6'7"" and our 2 centers in Bradley and Vuc that I just don't think Alize Johnson can fill."
Raptors fucked up not signing him. Alize Johnson too tbh.
"It is too early to talk about a trade but our options at 4 are DeRozan, Javonte Green and Alize Johnson right now. I don't know if that's tenable for a full season.  Hopefully he'll come back better than ever, that's all I care about right now. I still believe in Patrick Williams and his future is gonna be bright."
