P.J Tucker in 34 minutes only 2 rebounds and 1 steal..? Was he playing as bad as the numbers suggest or am I missing something?
sign Rondae hollis jefferson and trade for P.J tucker
Which teams could use P.J. Tucker?
Who’s giving up a first for an overrated 36 year old P.J Tucker?
"&gt; He can't opt out.  He has a player option for 22/23, unless I'm either completely misunderstanding his contract or how contracts work in general.  &gt; If he were to demand a trade, they could at least recoup some of the asset value they lose in the deal.  Like what? P.J. Tucker? Some highly protected first that'll turn into a second?  &gt; With Doc and Morey in place, I think the odds of him forcing his way out are pretty small.   ""I think the odds of PG forcing his way out are pretty small."", etc.  &gt; You have to take risks to win a championship.  Of course, but don't take risks just for the sake of taking them. They still have to be sensible. Being reactionary is exactly what you *shouldn't* do as a GM."
"This is much ado about nothing.  The buyout market favors GOOD contending teams.  It has no extra incentive for players to go to big markets than they normally would as free agents.  The small-market execs might as well be complaining about how their smaller city doesn't offer the same kind of nightlife and business opportunities as LA, NY, or Chicago.  This is the typical small market whining spun to make it seem like a new argument when its not.    Beck's writeup takes liberties with what is considered a big market because it doesn't help his argument.  He begins that paragraph with ""Other contenders had to work a little harder to strengthen their rosters last week."" as if switching the focus to ""other contenders"" isn't supposed to support the main point that small markets are being hurt.  The word ""small"" appears 10 times in his article, and is ALWAYS referencing the size of the market.  The word ""contender/contending"" appears 6 times, with 5 of those times directly used as a synonym for ""big market"" teams instead of simply a stand-in for ""good"" teams.  Its a bait-and-switch, he's throwing in ""contender/contending"" to make it seem like the complaints are about contending teams as well when its in fact all about big markets.    And of the teams he listed like the Nuggets, Clippers, Bucks, Sixers, and Heat, 2 of them laughably not big markets, but they're in his list because it helps to prove his point AFTER he's got the reader already hooked on his point of view that big = contender.  Denver is a middling sized city (13th in city size, 16th in metro size) and the Bucks are 20th and 24th in city/metro.  They should not be lumped together with the other teams.  In fact, a more fair article would have them on *opposing* sides.  The paragraph should instead read:  &gt; ""Though other contenders had to work a little harder to strengthen their rosters last week, not all were big markets.  The Clippers had to give up Lou Williams, the three-time Sixth Man of the Year, to get Rajon Rondo.  The Sixers traded players and picks to get George Hill. The Heat traded players and draft considerations to get Victor Oladipo.  *However*, the Nuggets traded players and draft picks to get Aaron Gordon and the Bucks traded players and picks to get P.J. Tucker.""  This rewrite of his paragraph gives at least a cursory opposition view that not all big markets are benefiting, its the good teams, and that's by design and nobody's fault and not a problem.  But writing an article saying ""Nothing is wrong, everything is just fine"" doesn't draw clicks.  You know what would draw clicks though but probably get Beck blacklisted by half the NBA teams?  Writing about the real problem, which is that cheap/bad owners drive players away and destroy competitiveness.  If you want to talk about big vs. small market teams, why not bring up the fact that the Knicks haven't exactly been a robust destination in the buyout market cause they've sucked for 20 years?  How about part of this competitive balance being destroyed by a big market team in Houston?  Frittata got rid of anyone who mattered in Houston and drove away his best player because he's cheap and wouldn't pay guys.  Want more?  Paul George said himself that he recruited AD to Indiana but the Pacers owner didn't want to pay him, citing they're a small market.  You know what's not small about Herb Simon?  His $2.6 billion net worth.  You know who's considered a pauper by NBA owner standards?  Jeanie Buss, owner of the Lakers and valued at a mere $500 million.  In fact, the trust that her father set up splits the ownership between all 6 kids, so even though she's technically the owner, she owns only 1/6th of the Lakers not counting the AEG partial ownership, which is 27%.  So technically, she only owns 11% of the 66% percent the Buss siblings own.  Yet she'll spend money like its going out of style to make sure the Lakers are relevant.    If there is a problem with buyouts, then it is NOT a fight between big and small markets.  Its a fight between good and bad teams AS IT SHOULD BE, and a fight between owners willing to spend and owners not willing to spend AS IT SHOULD BE.  The unnamed small-market execs quoted in the article would do a lot better to bring their complaints up to their owners and tell them to open their wallets if they want talent.  Or these GMs should tell their owners to fire them and hire better GMs.  They won't do that though, and therein lies the real reason why this article was written."
Dubs need a Lebron stopper. They should trade for P.J. Tucker.
"Westbrook walking inbounds, Nick Young lookaway missed 3, Von Wafer missed dunk that led to a turnover,   P.J Tucker not grabbing the ball, J.R Smith walking off the court to talk to Jason Terry"
"[P.J. Tucker was arrested on suspicion of “super extreme DUI”](https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/nba/suns/2014/07/28/suns-player-pj-tucker-dui-arrest/13299361/)     &gt;	Tucker's blood alcohol content registered at .201 on a preliminary breath test in the field on May 10, according to Scottsdale police. A driver is considered legally drunk for a DUI charge in Arizona at .08 blood-alcohol content. A blood test administered after Tucker was taken to jail and later analyzed by the Arizona Department of Public Safety showed his blood alcohol-content to be .222, according to the police report. A super extreme DUI is .20 or more.     ROCKET CULTURE"
Your point is genuinely terrible. This rockets team is tanking and is terrible and P.J Tucker can't save that but put him on a contending team and you'll see him shine
The 4th one is really bad. Why would you give them a first if you trade rozier who currently plays better than Oladipo. Oladipo will walk. Also it would be stupid from Charlotte to give up assets for a player that helps contenders like P.J tucker. They are still a young team that could potentially make the playoffs but still has development to do. Giving up a 1st round pick   that probably ends up in the 10s for P.J tuckre  is a very stupid move in Charlottes case. Another question would p.j play in Charlotte i don’t think so. He wants to contend for the title. Do the Rockets have enough roster spots to take on two more players? No  Very bad trade idea I have to say.
"The Golden State Warriors reportedly have interest in a trade for Victor Oladipo, according to Kevin O'Connor of The Ringer.  O'Connor noted this shows the team's plans to add another ball-handler in the mold of Andre Iguodala or Shaun Livingston, who each played key roles during the team's three NBA titles.  Oladipo has appeared in 15 games with the Houston Rockets since coming over in a January trade from the Indiana Pacers, averaging 19.9 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.7 assists with his new team.  The 28-year-old is set to become a free agent in the offseason.  Several big names have already changed teams this season, including James Harden heading to the Brooklyn Nets as part of a blockbuster four-team deal and Derrick Rose returning to the New York Knicks from the Detroit Pistons.   The Pistons are keeping Blake Griffin on the bench for the time being as they continue to explore trade opportunities for the six-time All-Star. The Cleveland Cavaliers are also holding Andre Drummond out of games in hopes of dealing him.   Teams will try to pursue other impact players such as Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine ahead of the March 25 deadline, while a young playmaker like Lonzo Ball or veteran role players like JJ Redick, George Hill and P.J. Tucker could all be on the move to help contenders.  For more NBA coverage, check out B/R's surprise landing spots for the league's top trade targets.

"So you're telling me not a single one of you thought to mention the small ball goat himself, P.J. ""Sweet Feet"" Tucker?"
oh I thought you confused Dudley with P.J. Tucker like I did
he hit a game winner over P.J tucker against the suns a few years ago.

"Agreed. People need to realize that a “shooter” is someone who can shoot the basketball at a very high level, not just league average. Guys like Joe Harris, Seth Curry, and Marcus Morris are guys I think are perfect examples of real “shooters.” In contrast, guys like Danuel House (he had one good year with us when he shot 41% from three IIRC, but since then he’s been league average) and P.J Tucker (he’s money from the corners but overall he’s a decent shooter at best) are guys who some people may think are “shooters” but really aren’t."
"Yeah that doesn't really work either since starters can be role players, and starters aren't always better than bench players.  I guess I consider a role player a type of guy who does like the support stuff: hustling, setting screens, going hard for rebounds, playing hard on defense, etc. and isn't a featured player in the offense, or primary ball-handler, or top guy on a team.  Like P.J. Tucker being a perfect example."
"And you don't think Jrue Holiday can do that? And on top of that, in terms of versatility - P.J. Tucker??"
or him saying that P.J. Tucker is the greatest corner 3pt shooter of all time
"Imagine Jeff Green, P.J. Tucker, and Harden on the same team"
"&gt; You think fans are worse because you don't identify as an athlete,  i literalyl played soccer at youth level in brazil with huge crowds on multiple occasions, lol. the level of play was never as relevant to my personal experience as a bunch of grown man threatening to beat me and screaming (the most creative they could come with) personal insults 2 meters from me in the crowds. crazy, huh? playing against a huge hateful crowd gets the adrenaline pumping much more than playing against a top tier team in a library - simple as that.  &gt; Dude, I have professional basketball players in my family, I have known 30 plus d1 players, many of whom played over seas too. College arenas get as loud as those over seas one, too.  americans being excepcionalist and thinking their version of something is the most special, the most hardcore, the one with most pressure, lol. colour me surprised. and your version of the story completely ignores all i mentioned about how those players are coming into the league and europe, in their and their families countries, taking it completely seriously and professionally. nba players that go to europe are taking a downgrade / admitting failure, so from their perspectives, of course they are not going to see it as much pressure. and yes, ""not being good enough"" is a certain type of pressure, but that's not what we were talking about here - luka and giannis are not even close to not being good enough.   &gt;  there is no argument otherwise.  what a shitty way to end a reply, btw - specially since it's pretty fucking clear you are going to argue forever for the sake of arguing and make up stories about dozens of imaginary basketball players that played in europe and talked to you about this subject specifically, just not to give in. and you are a type too common on the internet.  and well, [argue with them](https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/1895785):  &gt; Nicolas Batum  Current team: Hornets Played for teams in France  I've played EuroLeague games where it gets pretty crazy. Serbia, Turkey, and Greece are the top three in my mind. My first NBA game, I had to play against the Lakers in Staples Center against Kobe (Bryant) - MVP Kobe. **Coach (Nate McMillan) was like, 'You won't be scared to play against Kobe in front of 20,000 people, will you?' I was like, 'Coach, I've played in Greece, in Belgrade … this will be nothing compared to that.'**  It's just different. The atmosphere is crazy. Panathinaikos, Partizan Belgrade, Fenerbahce, those places. The first EuroLeague game I ever played in Turkey, they had protection over the benches, and during the timeouts, while my coach was talking, all you could hear was things hitting the shield, like, 'bap, bap, bap.'   &gt; Bogdan Bogdanovic  Current team: Kings Played for teams in Serbia and Turkey  Here (in the NBA), there are lots of fans of individual players. **Over there, it's more about the teams. There are different cultures in every league in every country there. It's unbelievable. The fans there really take it personal, like they are in the games. They are really nervous and mad in the games like the players. But to me, that makes it nice to play there, even on the road. It's a different kind of pressure. You have to experience it for yourself.** For me, I'm used to it, so playing in a game where fans are throwing coins or lighters or phones is nothing new. Over there, it's normal. They're pointing lasers in your face while you shoot free throws.  &gt; Willy Hernangomez  Current team: Hornets Played for teams in Spain  When I was playing for Madrid, we had a EuroLeague game in Turkey. I'll always remember this: That I was warming up before the game, and I lost the ball, and it bounced and rolled all the way to the stands, and I remember, I didn't even think about going to get the ball like here (in the NBA). The fans there are really crazy. You really feel scared sometimes. There's no way here I would feel (scared) like that. The people there really support their teams and you have to respect them, but sometimes they also cross the line.  **There are some arenas here that are really quiet, you don't even notice people are there, so for us (who have played in Europe), not that the NBA is easier because you never want to say easy, but maybe getting used to the crowds there doing everything crazy, makes it easier for us to focus on the game here. Here, we don't even have to pay attention to the fans.**  &gt; Furkan Korkmaz  Current team: 76ers Played for teams in Turkey  **They will talk shit about your family, and not like here. About your mom, your dad, if you have sisters, they know everything. They will Google stuff about your family, and I was still really young when I played over there, so think how crazy that is.**  &gt; Frank Ntilikina  Current team: Knicks Played for a team in France  My craziest memory was the (2016) EuroCup final against Galatasaray. The away game in Turkey, I remember walking to the locker room before the game and the walls were shaking because the fans were already so crazy inside. We (SIG Strasbourg) couldn't hear our coach talking in the locker room, because of the fans in the arena.  &gt; Joe Ingles  Current team: Jazz Played for teams in Spain and Israel  Serbia and Turkey were always the craziest, but I remember in Greece one year, in Panathinaikos, someone threw a plastic cup of Coke at us during a timeout, and it landed right on our coach's whiteboard while he was drawing up a play. That's pretty funny, but it wasn't funny at the time. He was pretty mad, but what are you going to do? They don't kick people out for that stuff there or try to find out who did it.  One of my teammates, I don't remember if it was a lighter or a thick coin, but one of my teammates one year got his head split open from someone throwing something. But then there's a good kind of crazy, too. Maccabi (in Israel), where I played, no one was throwing anything, but to have 15,000 people love being such a part of the game, it was wild.  &gt; P.J. Tucker  Current team: Rockets Played for teams in Israel, Ukraine, Greece, Italy, and Germany  **There's nothing like Greece and Turkey. Israel's pretty turned up, too. But yeah, over there, it's not like fans. It's like gangs. It's like hoods. It's about where you're from, and they take it very personal. They love - love - their teams. When I was in Greece, I played for Aris, and when we played PAOK, I had to have a security detail, because it's a big, big rivalry in Thessaloniki. It splits the city. When we played, it got so crazy that they shut the fans out and we had to play a game (later) that season with no fans (in the arena).**  I played a game in Turkey where fans were lighting coins - like using a lighter to light the coins - then throwing them at us.  &gt; Goran Dragic  Current team: Heat Played for teams in Slovenia and Spain  I've played a lot of games in Belgrade and other places where if you're not careful, you can get hurt. They throw crazy stuff. I've been a part of one game in Olympiacos (Greece) where they threw oranges on the court. I never found out why. In Belgrade, they just throw coins and lighters. In Europe, most of the arenas, they put a protection, like a tunnel, behind the benches, so players don't get hit. When you're sitting on the road bench in Europe, all you hear is 'tick tick tick' - things hitting the tunnel. It's part of it. You get used to it.  One game I played in Croatia, in Zadar, and they have this organization of fans that are really crazy. We had an incident where one of our players got in a fight with a Zadar player, and these fans broke onto the court, and we just took off, we had to run (away) to the locker room in the middle of the game. I was only 16 at the time.  It's funny you know, over there, when you're on the road, you don't know if the security guys are with them or if they are going to protect you."
P.J. Tucker changed this series cus the Bucks were getting punked in the first two games. Also shouts to Khash Middleton
"&gt;A Brooklyn Nets security guard who provides security for Kevin Durant and assists him in all security related matters was involved in an incident during game 3 of the eastern conference semi-finals between the Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks. During an on court altercation, the security guard with ties to Kevin Durant appeared come onto the court and shove P.J Tucker, a player for the Milwaukee Bucks. This incident resulted in a disciplinary action of not allowing the security guard to be courtside for any more games during this series. In addition, he will also not be permitted to work in Milwaukee. The Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks will at least play another 2 games in a best of 7 series. The winner will go onto the Eastern Conference Finals with a chance to go to the NBA Finals. The winner of the NBA finals will be crowned the champion of the 2020-2021 season. Lebron James and the LA Lakers were eliminated in the 1st round and will not be able to win the championship this year."""
"Good thing it was a rent-a-cop, not a real one, or Silver would've told P.J. Tucker ""those are the kinds of situations he needs to learn to avoid."""
"Yea, if only they had a real center to neutralize Gobert like P.J. Tucker or Russell Westbrook."
"Why are people so dramatic?   Nobody's been ""dropped"" in a game since Rudy Tomjanovich and it ain't gonna be P.J. Tucker who crosses that line."
P.J. tucker vs KD's personal bodyguard..who wins?
"""If you're P.J. Tucker you have to be smarter..."" bro wtf you talking about, Kevin Durant is the superstar carrying his teams scoring load. A double tech is exactly the sort of thing Tucker would want."
"The NBA community likes analytics, narratives, and fun basketball. Rudy Gobert is the perfect representation of everything modern NBA fans don't want to see in basketball. He doesn't shoot 3's, doesn't defend multiple positions, slow, back to the basket, not flashy, analytics and modern basketball theory prove that Rudy Gobert sucks...But then he plays good and wins basketball games. Their Is a reason why players like Robert Covington, P.J Tucker, and Zion are beloved. They represent the type of basketball fans want to see. Gobert isn't that."
Durant posturing over P.J. Tucker as if a real fight wouldn’t get him slammed through the subfloor is a great argument for allowing hockey-style fist resolutions in the National Basketball Association.
Role players should look into how P.J. tucker revived his career
"I think you need to attend to the definitions of these terms that people provide. You've taken ""replacement level"" to basically mean ""unplayable"". That is *not* what the makers of BPM used the term to mean.  [From their explanation](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm2.html)  &gt;-2.0 is a bench player (this is also defined as ""replacement level"")  AKA they are saying that a very good g-league player/overseas player is capable of stepping into the role of the average player that comes off the bench and sees minutes. -2 also serves as a CUT OFF, with everything below that falling into a replacement level group. Replacement does *not* mean unplayable, and they demonstrate that by saying:  &gt;Below -2.0 are many end-of-bench players  AKA NBA teams all have a few of these players and they're typically the benchwarmers.   &gt;Zero wins doesn't mean that a player isn't hurting a team -- it means that they're a substantially liability when they're on the floor  Based on what? [Read how wins are estimated and calculated](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html). A player that does not get a share of the win does not mean the player hurt the team. That's what negative win shares are for. Because again, it would make no sense statistically or practically to assume that all players coming off the bench are hurting their team. If only we had a word that could communicate when something isn't significantly impacting something in one way or another....oh yea...neutral.  &gt;if the worst guys in the league who sometimes see minutes by necessity are neutral,  But as BPM states,  what you've described here is the replacement level group that falls below their replacement level cut off. You're assuming players *at the cut-off* should be described with everyone in the group. This isn't the case. It's why players at the cut-off are assigned neutral cumulative value AND why the person who helped to identify a replacement level group in the NBA identified that the players at the margins are always the issue. It is not meant to be a sharp cut-off at which players at the level contribute no value, and the author struggled with this because several players that were clearly contributors were falling into his replacement level group at the margin.   Because of this, a replacement level player, especially AT the cut-off, is capable of contributing to an NBA bench according to BPM. What you're confusing is the cut-off with end-of-bench level/deep into the replacement level group. Those players have *negative* wins added because they are *detrimental* to a team.   Replacement, especially at the cut-off, doesn't mean *this player shouldn't be in the league*. [Again, the person the cite for their discussion on replacement level  just did it by taking an arbitrary group of bench players are declaring them replacement and then played with the numbers post-hoc until he identified an acceptable group](http://tangotiger.com/index.php/site/comments/what-is-a-replacement-level-nba-player). Replacement is a concept taken from baseball used to assign the relative impact of a presumed player, in this case from the g-league. So statistically we know that replacement isn't set at the ""this player shouldn't be in the league"" or ""this player is actively hurting the team"" but rather ""another professional player could likely contribute this for the league minimum"". Which is why *I said* considering his role (bench) and salary (minimum), his impact was neutral at worst. That's *just* going off the impact and ignoring [chemistry](http://philipmaymin.com/papers/Maymin%20Maymin%20and%20Shen%20-%20NBA%20Chemistry%20-%20IJCSS.pdf), which dictates *why* the majority of teams will still have young guys and/or veterans that seem to be at replacement level in their rotation even during the playoffs.     It's because of this we can do a real world test and see most of the playoff teams have/had a player at that cut-off that is a part of their rotation: Shake Milton, Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, Solomon Hill, P.J. Tucker,  etc.   &gt;You should just name names for ""many of them"" because there are only five reputable all-in-ones, being generous to RPM, and they disagree about how to turn plus-minus into wins even though they're all designed to approximate RAPM.  I think part of our issue is I'm not sure you're interpreting replacement level correctly and I'd love for you to cite where *you're* getting your interpretation from."
"And that the Lakers didn't have good shooting in the first place. Drummond, AD, and Schröder in the starting lineup is a horrific three point shooting team today.  You also have to consider that a lot of these guys were able to just stand in the corner or wait for open threes previously but aren't sharpshooters. Like P.J. Tucker might shoot 37-38% from three standing in the corner but if you took away his spacing and put more pressure on him then that average goes down."
P.J. Tucker looks washed up bro.
"Bucks vs Nets big 3:  giannis elite in scoring, defense &lt;= KD more elite in offense, above avg defense.  Jrue Holliday solid on offense, elite defense == Kyrie much better offense, below avg defense. Khris Middleton solid on offense, above avg defender &lt;= Harden elite offense , avg defense. Lopez&gt; better than any Nets big Nets have shooters - harris shamet &gt;= Forbes, can't name another shooter. Bucks Defense&gt; Nets Defense ( big 3 plus p.j. Tucker and Lopez) Verdict: I'm neutral but I'd say Nets in 7."
"youre absolutely right, being in the game at the 2:43 mark does not count as being in with 2 mins left.   also  &gt;9:07		P.J. Tucker enters the game for Giannis Antetokounmpo	84 - 114  typical baby that always has to be ""proved right"" and cant just accept when theyve been embarassed and proved wrong and try to learn where they how they are misunderstanding the topic"
"When it’s Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Trevor Ariza, Jrue Holiday, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and P.J. Tucker on the floor? You’re not gonna see many easy buckets."
"Jimmy and Bam are both better than last season, our defense is finally turning the corner into a cohesive unit and all of our shooters are hot at the perfect time.  The Bucks as a playoff team are significantly, significantly better than last year. Turning Eric Bledsoe into Jrue Holiday cannot be overstated. P.J. Tucker gives them lineup versatility.   Bucks starting five &gt; Heat starting five. Bucks sacrifice bench depth for that. They have to hope Forbes, Connaughton, Portis can give them decent minutes. If they don't, that's where the Heat win this series.  Bucks in 7."
"Following the same criteria (no rookies, no injuries, starter-like minutes), 538 Raptor has:  Lonnie Walker IV -2.3 WAR  P.J. Tucker/ Dwayne Bacon -1.8 WAR  Bismack Biyomobo -1.4 WAR  Stanley Johnson -0.8 WAR"
"The (current) Bucks are basically hoping to outshoot their opponents on each and every game. And yes their offense is clearly better. However neither Portis, nor Forbes add anything defensively. Maybe P.J. Tucker does add to their defense, then again I trust in Bud to heavily misusing him and playing him alongside Lopez ... because why not? I have a switchable small ball C? Why not play him alongside the most unswitchable player in the modern game? Basically negate his superpower (defensively) by asking him to basically chase players?  So, yeah, obviously if the Heat go on a run (oh and they will) and the Bucks go to even bigger runs, the Bucks win. However if you are hoping to outshoot each and every opponent in your way to the trophy ... good luck.  In fact I'm doubter of the Nets even, who are even better at this style of basketball (""let them go in a run, we will run even faster"" type of nonsense) . Things that you think may work , don't in the playoffs. There the rules are different. The Lakers basically mangled those hapless Warriors to submission. The amount of ""missed"" calls were incredible. I sometimes joke that playoff basketball has more football in it than it has regular season basketball.  I wanna see Forbes and Portis shooting 45% when driven out of the court because the refs refuse to call the same things they do in the regular season. Shooting teams get roughed up in the post season ... Always. The Warriors ultimately won because on top of being a shooting (super)team they were also tough defensively and very switchable. Klay Thompson and Draymond Green were taking everything away (and Iggy earlier on). You *need* that, goonery. You won't go to the finals prancing like a princess. And yes the Bucks have goons of their own (defensively), however they are greatly misused by Bud's system. He puts no bodies in the perimeter, they are always chasing the shooter, like always. Those are NBA players, they don't need much to get hot. Leaving 3+ ft to shooters (consistently) is a recipe for disaster. Suddenly players like Duncan Robinson would look like superheroes on your a$$, all the while your very shooters would be roughed up on the other end (before even they are in a position to the get the ball), because Spoelstra has Bud's numbers.  So yes, better personel. The Bucks are blessed to have so many good players at once. Despite lacking a legit No2. They have 2-3 no 3s, and some good 4s and 5s. Not many teams can have that. Still.not.enough against good teams.  Even if you win over the Heat (on talent alone) then you get the Nets next.

"They're not anymore - which is an issue. It got him an open 3 he knocked down, however, and I think if Jrue/Khris/Giannis weren't all walking buckets he may have been used a bit more.  Either way, P.J. Tucker is a lesson in why the box-score is an incomplete picture."
It's embarrassing and it's usually a sign that you're one foot out of the league example  P.J Tucker
"You know Giannis isn't gonna get called for a damn thing.  Fuckin star ball.  It's that crap that makes me hate the NBA.  If that's P.J. Tucker driving there, they call the travel.  If it's Jae Crowder, they call the travel.  But because it's Giannis, nope, he gets three plus steps."
P.J. “Buzzfeed Quiz” Tucker
"&gt;Fournier, Joe Harris, RJ Barrett, Danny Green, OG Anunoby, P.J. Tucker, Justin Holiday, Saddiq Bey, Isaac Okoro, Patrick Williams, Kevin Huerter, Cody Martin, Jimmy Butler, Dwayne Bacon, Beal, MPJ, Okogie, Pokusevski, Norm Powell, Bojan Bogdanovic, Mo Harkless, Mikal Bridges, LeBron, Kawhi, Oubre, Dorian Finney-Smith, Jae'Sean Tate, Kyle Anderson, Brandon Ingram, DeRozan  There's ESPN's list of starting SF's in this league. Who can't he guard here? LeBron? If that's the standard to hold people to then noone can defend the 3.   That list is chopped liver. That list is ass^2.   The problem isn't Klay at the 3. It's your other 2 perimeter defenders are too small to guard the 3 and not good enough to defend premiere 1's and 2's. Klay at PG, SG, and SF is a good defensive team. Andre checked the Wing's because he does have more size (fair) but also because Klay was taking their best guard (most often the best player on the opposing team). He didn't get the assignment because the Warriors had another premiere defensive wing so he didn't have to, not because he couldn't."
Breaking News: P.J. Tucker retires mid game
Why P.J. Tucker out working us 💀
Another fun fact. P.J Tucker was the Israeli league MVP in 2008. Also he led his team (Hapoel Holon) to a historic title ending a run of 14 straight championships by Maccabi Tel Aviv.
"Yes.  Did you know that Bud adjusted this year after all the criticism and instituted more switching? Did you also know that CP3 and Booker are two of the best in the league -- CP3 literally one of the best ever -- from midrange, which is the exact weakness that killed the Bucks the past three years?  Bud got legit criticism because he's been slow to make adjustments. It's not just r/NBA, it's guys like Zach Lowe and John Hollinger who've written about it. Here's Hollinger from today:  *While Lopez is a master at this coverage and showed in the conference finals that he can play “drop” even against a player like Trae Young, who most teams wouldn’t chance it against, the Suns are an even steeper challenge. Paul is one of the best shooters ever from the free-throw-line area, while Booker has exceptional craft in either getting pull-ups or blasting off on the way to the rim. Against backup Payne, the Bucks are more likely to feel comfortable playing drop, especially since Payne has the speed to roast switches.      The Bucks can play switching lineups too, especially if they pull Lopez off the floor and opt to play Giannis as their center. That arrangement puts Pat Connaughton in at the wing and immediately forces Ayton into a tough spot at the other end, where he either must guard Giannis or stand in the corner with P.J. Tucker. Alas, the Bucks are going to try to roll with a 6.5-man rotation as much as possible, which means Lopez almost certainly must play at least half of each game regardless. I have a hard time seeing how Bryn Forbes stays on the court against the Suns’ guards, and Bobby Portis could have a tough time defensively as well.*"
"Personally, the Giannis-Ayton matchup in the post is too much work. The best tactic would be to attack the guard pair and force the rest of the team to win without them. If Giannis makes an effort to attack CP3 and Booker he'll have no less than a 6 inch height advantage everytime, and paired with defense from Holiday and Middleton will take a toll on those 2. Giannis will also be able to guard Ayton appropriately, Ayton has been incredible but the only defensive big of this caliber was AD who was injured during the first round. I don't think Giannis will be able to hold him perfectly, but he has the size and speed to keep up with him in a way that Jokic and Batum were not able to. It's also worth saying that putting Giannis at the 4 would be effective looking at potential match-ups of Dario Saric and Jae Crowder. Crowder is an elite defender who was able to put a dent in Lebron's production, but he will be giving up 5 inches of height, and cannot match Giannis' athletic ability.   On another note, P.J. Tucker will play a massive role on defense, he'll be able to guard 1-4 against this Phoenix team. With his performance against Kevin Durant, we can say with some certainty that he would be able to effectively guard someone like Booker, who is likely still feeling pain from his broken nose and who is the same size as P.J.  Some problems I see for the Bucks lie in the bench unit. Players like Brook Lopez, Bryn Forbes and Pat Connaughton may find themselves attacked by CP3's prodding offense. Taking advantage of Lopez's slow feet and lack of ability to close the distance on the mid range shot. This also applies to Booker, who will have the added benefit of size against Pat and Forbes. The Suns will likely be match-up hunting against this Milwaukee team and working to rotate the star defenders away from star offensive players. Defensively, I'm not sure what the Suns will be able to do. Bridges, Paul and Crowder are defensively diverse starters that can be swapped and changed around nearly interchangeably, so they will have an incredible amount of options to work through on the defensive end.   Ultimately, some key match-ups for this series will probably be  - Ayton vs Antetokounmpo   - Paul vs Holiday  - Booker vs Middleton  - Payne vs Teague  Especially without Giannis, Phoenix has an excellent opportunity to win this championship looking at the depth and versatility of their lineup. Barring injury, I expect Phoenix will take this series in 6-7 games."
P.J. Tucker and corner threes.   Name a better duo
"They were definitely a great team that year. A la #1 seed, taking the Warriors to 7, and having CP3, Harden, Ariza, Capela, Gordon, P.J. Tucker, Ryan Anderson etc. He's a great *system* coach but that has limitations in the playoffs (e.g. Budenholzer). I don't see him taking the current Blazers roster to the finals. If they acquire a stretch 5...maybe.     Either way, 'great' should be reserved for teams and coaches that at minimum make a finals appearance. I'd put him in the conversation with George Karl all-time."
We were ready to give Bogdan roughly the same as you did. 😆 🤣   I'm actually glad we didn't get him though. Wouldn't have P.J. Tucker if we got him and we needed that Tucker defense.
"I love p.j tucker , what a fighter"
P.J. Tucker might have made the difference for the Jazz

They are overselling this Giannis defending KD thing. Should have made adjustments when it started getting away from them but P.J. Tucker has been pretty damn amazing to me.
1. J.cole 2. Tracy Mcgrady (his age now) 3. Kris Middleton 4. P.j. tucker 5. Frank Kominsky  They beat the timberwolves because KAT and Russell both miss the game.
"&gt; And now he's an NBA and Olympic champ. Couldn't be happier for him and couldn't happen for a better guy.  Still needed a Longhorn to carry him across that line.  I'm, of course, referring to P.J. Tucker!  I keed.  Love guys like Middleton and Jimmy Butler prove how far you can go with hard work and a positive attitude."
"&gt;believe that the draft does not have to be nearly as hard as many teams will make it. I’m not interested in what the mocks say about where a guy should go. Five years will pass and when we look back at this 2018 draft, we’ll see a long line of players who fail to have real careers in the NBA. In the moment, the selections will not seem ludicrous because the mocks have brainwashed us to believe that the best prospects are listed in the correct range and order. So when I hear people say, “That is too high [or too low] to take [Player A],” I immediately cringe. Too high or too low according to what?  &gt;I care about one thing when it comes to the draft: getting a player who does not suck. Some of these guys will be stars, some might end up just being role players, but I am 100 percent confident none of them will fail. Enough with the small talk. Time to put my money where my mouth is. Vernodamus is here to save the day. These players will not suck (and if they do, I will absolutely blame the situation and the coaching):   * **Marvin Bagley III**   &gt;I seriously wonder if I have different eyeballs than everyone else. There is a 0 percent chance that Bagley is not awesome in the NBA. I’m not sure that he has ever played in a game in his life where he was not the best player on the floor. Coach K said the following regarding Bagley: “He is not a good runner; he’s an amazing runner. And then he’s an amazing repeated jumper. In other words, he doesn’t really take time to even land, he just pops right back up. He wants to learn, he has no demons, he’s a great kid, he’s smart, and has an incredible motor. He never has a bad day. He’s a treasure, really. He’s going to be one of the great players in the NBA during his time.” Coach K also said that in his 38 years at Duke he has had only one other player like him: Kyrie Irving. I honestly have no idea how he is not the consensus first pick in the draft.  * **Luka Doncic**  &gt;I have expressed my worry that Doncic might not have the athleticism it takes to be a massive star in the NBA. That being said, he is smart, he plays hard, and he can dribble, pass, and shoot. I’m positive he is not going to be a failure. He is too good at basketball to fail. He also has a massive tiger tattoo on his forearm, which is a big plus. More than anything, I have warmed up to him more and more since the word that NBA teams have cooled on him, because that means he is probably amazing.  * **Wendell Carter Jr.**  &gt;This is a little reminiscent of when Al Horford and Joakim Noah were in the same draft in 2007. I loved both of them and thought there was no chance that either of them would fail. It was just a matter of how good they were going to be. Bagley is the best prospect in the draft in my opinion, but Carter is also a beast. His fundamentals are ridiculous, he is huge and has a massive wingspan — and his shot looks as good as any player’s in the draft. A smart big that can run the floor, plays hard, and can shoot 3s? Those guys don’t fail.  * **Collin Sexton**  &gt;I love Sexton. He is smart, he is lightning fast, and he plays every game like it is his last game on earth. An absolute fighter who routinely plays his best against the best competition. You need guys like Sexton in the NBA playoffs. I think his ceiling is much higher than most people seem to think, and I know, no matter what, I will love having this guy on my team.  * **Miles Bridges**  &gt;He can dribble, pass, and shoot. He is a freak athlete. He is a smart kid that comes off great in all of his interviews. He is tough as nails. You can have the guys that you think are going to be good, and I’ll take the one that I know will be. Miles Bridges is a perfect example of why teams and analysts miss in the NBA draft. He will absolutely be better than many players taken in front of him and you can see it from a mile away.  * **Jacob Evans**  &gt;Cincinnati won a school-record 31 games, and Evans was the best prospect on the team. His sophomore season he was a finalist for the Jerry West Award, which goes to the best shooting guard in the country, and his junior year he was a finalist for the Julius Erving Award, which goes to the best small forward in the country. Cincy coach Mick Cronin had this to say about him: “He is a winner. He shoots a high percentage. He’s an elite defender. He blocks shots. He guards point guards. He rebounds. He just does so many things, and he’s a coach on the floor. He’s such a smart player.” Umm, sold.  * **Donte DiVincenzo**  &gt;At one point during this draft process, someone asked me, “If we saw DiVincenzo drop 31 in the title game, be great all season, and test physically off the charts, then why in the hell is he supposed to go late first round?” Great question, anonymous guy! The answer is because that is where the mock draft consensus has him slotted, and the mock draft consensus is dumb. He’s a big-time competitor, super athlete, can shoot the cover off the ball, and in the biggest game of the season, he looked like the best player on maybe the best college team I have ever seen.  * **Rawle Alkins**  &gt;Brooklyn in the house! Alkins was a high school force of nature who won three city titles and two state championships in New York. He had a foot issue that hampered his career at Arizona, but this kid has so many attributes that I love. Unstoppable motor, built like a linebacker, good-looking shot, and do-or-die playing style. He has been projected too low since this process started. Alkins will be a fan favorite wherever he plays. You want a Marcus Smart, Tony Allen, or P.J. Tucker–type player when you need a big play in a big game. I see that with Alkins.  * **Jevon Carter**  &gt;You do not want to be guarded by Jevon Carter. Bob Huggins called him “the best defensive player I have ever coached.” Whoa. Carter reminds me of the kind of guy who is playing in the park where the winner stays on the court, and you could leave for six hours and come back and his team would still be playing. He was conference defensive player of the year twice, and national defensive player of the year last year. He affects every game that he plays in. Bona fide bulldog. Every roster in the NBA could use a guy like him."

P.J. Tucker. He's one of the only players that can score 0-5 points in 20-30 minutes and you would still say he had an excellent game. One of the most physical defenders in the game.
"I stand to be corrected on the math but I think $250,000 is a little over 3 percent of his $8,000,000 salary in 2020-21.   For someone who makes, say, $40,000, that'd be like spending $1,250 on a pair of shoes.   Of course, there's this whole other thing where one must account for the fact that P.J. Tucker won't be making $8,000,000 per year for his entire life, the re-sale value of those shoes, whether he makes many, many purchases similar to this or whether it's a rarity, how he's invested the rest of his funds, etc., in order to understand the true financial ramisfications.  Then again, if someone making $40,000 spent over a thousand dollars on a pair of shoes there could be all sorts of questions about their lifestyle, too. None of it, really, would be our business, but I understand the curiosity."
"P.J. Tucker is 35. Although, he technically did join the NBA as a rookie in **2006**(!), after all his grind out of the league, he came back in 2012 and he was only widely know a bit later."

From the summer league games I watched reminded me of Patrick Williams and an early Kawhi, and his draft comp was a combination of Kawhi and Jabari Parker so I'm not sure what you're talking about when you say they are completely different.  But I guess I'm a fool for not thinking Toronto is going to have no issue being in contention for the playoffs."
"Superstars: KD &amp; Curry All-stars: Dame &amp; Zion Role players: Tobias Harris, Jamaal Murray, Jonas Valanciunas, Myles Turner, Deandre Ayton, Joe ingles, P.J. Tucker, Ja morant (who I consider a star but technically isn’t an all star yet)"
P.J. Tucker was playing like 35 minutes a night against the Warriors. Am I supposed to believe P.J. Tucker is that much better than Ben Wallace?
I'm still a believer. I wouldn't be surprised if in 10+ years he's the next P.J. Tucker.

Cam Johnson dunk on P.J. Tucker
"* My bold prediction is that Bogdan Bogdanovic will not hold onto the starting spot in Atlanta. Seems like a lot of younger guys are ready to break out for them. * Unsure of the Nets lineup--other than the Big 3 (and KD can play multiple positions), I think we'll see a variety of lineups. They sure have a lot of talent. * I know Charlotte played Rozier at the 2 and Ball at the 1 last year, but I think that will change depending on the matchup given LaMelo's size. * Porzingis at the 4 and Kleber at the 5 is not happening IMO. I see Porzingis at the 5 with Kleber or Finney-Smith at the 4, unless Moses Brown earns the starting center spot. Not sure why teams keep bouncing on that experiment, he had a great season last year. * I think Olynyk will start the season at the 4 for the Pistons, moving Grant to the 3. * I don't see any way Marc Gasol starts for the Lakers. Luckily LeBron can be slotted in almost anywhere, AD has some flexibility, and there are some other role players that can get a shot.  * Sorry, but P.J. Tucker should not be starting for the Heat. Even Markieff Morris would be better, ideal situation is Omer Yurtseven comes in off his hot Summer League and moves Bam out to the 4 for a twin towers effect IMO."
"That’s a little tougher because there are so many good role players that end up playing until they’re on the brink of retirement at like 5mins a game.  Maybe Shane Battier, Boris Diaw or P.J. Tucker? They’ve been able to contribute in the later stages of their careers."

this is what p.j. tucker does
If strength didn’t matter then how tf does small ass p.j. Tucker be guarding like dudes almost twice his size.
Let’s not forget P.J. Tucker locked down KD in the Bucks vs. Nets playoff matchup last year. It was a key part in the Bucks win.
"P.J Tucker, Alex Caruso, Mikal Bridges, Patrick Beverley, Myles Turner"
"Y&amp;eah, last season the Nets got in trouble because Durant's personal security guard was acting as arena security and started pushing P.J. Tucker during a skirmish."

"Full article:  ON A QUIET evening a few weeks before the start of the regular season, Wilson Taylor was deep inside Paycom Center's laundry room, which doubles as the Oklahoma City Thunder equipment manager's deep storage facility. At a rack pushed up against the wall, he ran his hands over a layer of dust on a cluster of black and gold Nike shoe boxes. Kobe 8 System TB, size 13.5.  He smiled, knowing the score he'd just uncovered. He pulled out his phone, took a picture and texted it to Thunder rookie guard Josh Giddey.  ""No way!"" Giddey wrote back. ""Can I come right now?""  Fifteen minutes later Giddey was in the building, cracking open the five pairs of orange-and-white Thunder-color Kobes that had originally been sent for Derek Fisher, who finished his playing career with the Thunder in the 2013-14 season and had previously been a longtime teammate of Kobe Bryant. Giddey, cradling the boxes like a child on Christmas, looked at Taylor and said: ""Can I have them all?""  For years, this might've seemed like an unusual request. In the world of excess and fashion celebrity that is the NBA, shoes are usually ubiquitous. They're always fresh, always everywhere and typically gratis.  Until now.  Last spring, Nike and Vanessa Bryant announced they were parting ways after the shoe giant's deal with the late Kobe Bryant ended. The sides are still talking with the hope they can eventually come to terms, sources told ESPN, but currently the partnership is off. There had already been production delays that prevented players from getting their normal supply during the 2020-21 season, and for now, there are no more Kobes being produced.  Suddenly, the most popular sneaker among NBA players is also the hardest to get.  ""If you don't already have them,"" says Portland Trail Blazers forward Larry Nance, ""you're not getting them.""  KOBE BRYANT'S SIGNATURE Nike sneaker had become unquestionably the most popular shoe for NBA players in recent years. During the 2019-20 season, more than 100 players were wearing the Kobe 4 Protro, a retro re-release of a sneaker Bryant originally wore in 2008. Today's players love the design, the feel and the statement of the Kobes.  ""This generation looks at Kobe like our Jordan,"" says Chicago Bulls guard DeMar DeRozan, known in the league as the dean of the Kobe shoe devotees. ""It's a great shoe to wear. Guys really fell in love with it.""  In the Orlando bubble in 2020, just months after Bryant's tragic death, nearly one-third of the 330 or so players were wearing a version of Kobe's signature shoe, and that figure was growing. Over the past two years, a number of players who'd previously been with Under Armour and Adidas did not have their sneaker endorsement contracts renewed, a trend that was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the new sneaker free agents went looking for Kobes. It all adds up to a large contingent of players who now have a source problem for their Kobe needs.  There are still supplies on sale at some retailers, but not in great numbers in the sizes NBA players typically need. The scarcity of larger sizes has driven a pricing boom on secondary shoe resale websites such as StockX, GOAT and eBay.  NBA players who wear size 14 or larger are looking at spending at least $800 for the most basic models of Kobes, and that's not what they typically wear. But the players are paying, with several telling ESPN they've spent more than five figures buying supplies of Kobes on the secondary market since last spring and summer.  ""I'm not going into a store and finding a [size] 17 in a Kobe. No way,"" says Anthony Davis, who switched to the Kobes when he joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 2019. ""I mean, it's guys' favorite shoes. ... A lot of people are inspired by him, and the shoe feels amazing. All of them feel amazing.""  Players previously used to wearing whatever colors they wanted -- particularly after the league relaxed its rules around sneakers before the 2018-19 season -- are now scouring the web and trying to hunt forgotten stockpiles to get shoes to wear in games. And they're competing against each other for the available large sizes in the marketplace.  ""If you weren't in on them for the last few years,"" says DeRozan, a longtime Kobe model enthusiast, ""you're having a tough time.""  Kobes are now considered ""deadstock,"" taking them into a vintage market that ups the ante. NBA players have chased deadstock shoes for years, often to add to their collections to wear or display off the court. Miami Heat forward P.J. Tucker is known for wearing high-end vintage models in games, but he's an outlier.  It's also not unheard of for players to occasionally buy shoes for game usage. Taylor says he sometimes helped players such as former Thunder center Steven Adams, who wears size 19 and really liked the way Derrick Rose's older Adidas models fit him, spend a few hundred dollars to chase down extra pairs. More commonly around the league, players wear what they're paid to wear and there's almost never a thought about supply.  The current situation around Kobes is a whole new game, even for players paid to wear Nikes. Giddey, who signed a multiyear deal with Nike before the season, and players like him are spending more than $1,500 on pairs of Kobes right now as they try to stock up for this season and beyond. Their agents are sniffing around for them, calling in favors and hunting the secondary market for their clients, but without much success.  ""I've had a few guys reach out to me for help,"" says Phoenix Suns star Devin Booker said. ""I'll never run out of Kobes."" Booker and DeRozan have a supply of PEs, shorthand for Player Exclusives, that Nike has set them up with as brand ambassadors for years. But they're in an elite class. The shortage is particularly hitting young players who adore Bryant and his shoe line but haven't had the benefit of being in the league long enough to create a backlog.  ""I'm working on it every day,"" says New Orleans Pelicans rookie Trey Murphy, who wore a pair of Kobes gifted to him by a teammate to start the season. ""It's hard out there right now. I'm not DeMar DeRozan.""  But even DeRozan can't be DeRozan.  ""I used to play in a pair once or twice and then give my shoes away to fans,"" DeRozan says. ""I may not be able to do that as much.""  THE RUMORS OF the end of the Bryant family agreement with Nike started circulating last season before becoming official in April. Nike reps quietly told team equipment managers to prepare their Kobe guys for an end.  ""Some of us got the word, and we started hoarding them,"" says Suns forward Jae Crowder. ""By the time the news came out, I had banked up enough for about two years.""  Stars with major shoe deals like LeBron James, who has given molds of his feet to Nike so custom shoes feel broken in on first wear, break out a new pair each game. Some players will wear them for a couple of games. Crowder says his two-year supply was 100 pairs, as he usually goes through about 50 in a year. Davis, on the other hand, uses fewer, as he says he will use around 20-25 pairs of his relatively shallow Kobe supply this season. Some players without a similarly deep supply have already been forced to switch. Several equipment managers say players have switched this season to the plentiful Nike Kyrie Irving Low model, which has design similarities to the Kobe model. Others are using Nike's new more generic line, the GT. But many custom shoes have been delayed as Nike and other shoe retailers deal with factory shutdowns in Asia due to COVID-19.  In the meantime, the players who still have Kobes are trying to get the most out of each box.  ""The guys I have wearing Kobes are wearing them until they damn near fall apart,"" one equipment manager says.  When discussing this situation with ESPN, players repeatedly expressed hope that Nike and the Bryant estate can come to a new agreement, a talking point that's been pervasive among sneakerheads this fall. But even if that comes to pass, it would be a long time before Kobes are available again -- to players or anyone else. Product lines typically take Nike 12-16 months to produce, sources say, and that was before the pandemic disrupted global supply chains.  Either way, as this season rolls on and the supplies of the remaining Kobes begin to dwindle with no replacements, the demand for the late Hall of Famer's beloved shoe design will only increase. In a time when some players are dabbling in cryptocurrency investments, there might be a new exchange developing as more players get desperate.  ""I've always had so many pairs, but I'm looking at them differently now. Guys are asking me [for them], but I can't go through them like I did,"" DeRozan says. ""If it gets bad, I may have to even go to my secret vault.""  ESPN's Dave McMenamin contributed to this story."

"[It's Winderman] ""P.J. Tucker, Heat Not Worried About Results, Just Focusing On Their Grindset And Putting In The Hours"" #HeatCulture"
"Paywall   Heat, P.J. Tucker not interested in hype, just beating opponents to a pulp  Ira Winderman South Florida Sun Sentinel  Oct 28, 2021 at 9:07 AM  MIAMI — P.J. Tucker did not arrive to the Miami Heat as some sort of promotional vehicle, even with his build as a compact Mack Truck.  So while Heat Nation, Heat Culture, The Kennel and other buzzwords have become part of the Miami Heat lexicon, the 6-foot-5, 245-pound veteran power forward shoos them aside, just as he does opposing big men when fighting for rebounds.  With the Heat at 3-1 after Wednesday night’s 106-93 victory over the Brooklyn Nets, Tucker bodied up against early-season Heat hype with the same vigor he utilized in defending Kevin Durant at Barclays Center.  “As players, you don’t think about it like that,” Tucker said of the catchphrases that supposedly crystalize and define this season’s Heat. “It’s not like I’m like, ‘Oh, he’s a dog.’ It’s just like an energy. The way y’all talk about it, it’s not like that. We just go out and play. We just play.”  If anything, Tucker said, it is as simple as a matter of trust, that with so many quality individual defenders alongside, including Bam Adebayo, Jimmy Butler and Kyle Lowry, there is no second thought about switching on defense and allowing a teammate to momentarily handle a challenge such as Durant.  “It’s good to be on a team where you can really be happy to trade off,” Tucker said. “I can be on KD and Bam will switch, and I’m like, ‘cool.’ Jimmy will switch, I’m like, ‘cool.’ Kyle will switch, it’s like ‘cool.’  “I know what those guys are going to do. They’re going to play hard, they’re going to give everything they got. Whether they score or not, do it again the next possession and we can talk to each other. Bam can say whatever to me, I can say whatever to him, and then we can yell at each other, and then go out there and we’re going to play and it’s done. To have that kind of chemistry with guys this early in the season, it’s nice.”  With the NBA back to a typical 82-game schedule after regular seasons were reduced to 73 and 72 games the past two years by the pandemic, the reality is the Heat are just a single week in, as they turn their attention to Friday’s visit by the Charlotte Hornets to FTX Arena.  “Who cares, man?” Tucker said when asked about quality victories over a pair of Eastern Conference favorites, in the Bucks and Nets. “Listen, man, we just played our fourth game. We got to build. We’re going to go through some stretches where we’re going to be bad. It’s just not going to be good. But it’s how we come out of that.  “Like [Wednesday], they took the lead. We could have given up and been like, ‘Aw.’ But we fought. To get that this early in the season, it’s nice regardless of how the game went, the refs, shots made, shots missed. I just like our competitiveness and how much we fought. This early in the season, that’s all you can ask for.”  Since the start of the season, Adebayo has spoken of how the Heat have come to view the locker room as a kennel, a place for hungry dogs, or dawgs, to fight their way to respect.  Such is the impetuousness of a 24-year-old.  But when the analogy was raised to Butler, 32, he rolled his eyes as he shared a glance at Tucker, 36."
