since when is frank kaminsky great?
"if i gotta rely on Frank Kaminsky to guard the paint with Luka and Book getting blown by on drives, i will die."
"Imagine saying ""Frank Kaminsky"" as justification of depth when he was waived by the fucking Kings"
MJ liked Frank Kaminsky SO MUCH that he saved Boston‚Äôs future  They wanted to trade the picks that became Brown and Tatum to move up and draft Justice Winslow but
Frank Kaminsky üòÇ
"Eh Cody has caught his fair share of bodies, the guy can really get up if he has a running start. Frank Kaminsky dunking on Giannis though... that was a sight to behold."
"Yes, I can, and no, not on Frank Kaminsky. Again, we are talking about KELLY OUBRE, not a random person on the street. Not to mention that the original comment was a joke that isn't meant to be taken seriously"
"Hard to dominate with my boi Frank Kaminsky giving you the business on both ends  But kidding aside, the Sixers is such an awful matchup for the Suns. Def not looking forward to those two games."
That's 2015 player of the year Frank Kaminsky to you
id rather take frank kaminsky back
Was this that year I remember as a kid that Frank Kaminsky went on that nutso run in the NCAA tournament? I don‚Äôt follow college basketball but I remember hearing that around the time.
Knocked out by Frank Kaminsky and Sam Dekker. Ooft
Confirmed: Frank Kaminsky has same handles as Magic Johnson. Kaminsky now considered greatest PF of all time.

You just got blown out by Frank ‚ÄúMichael ‚ÄúFrank Kaminsky‚Äù Jordan‚Äù Kaminsky
"Frank Kaminsky is just a slimmer, more dapper Jokic"
This was the most surprising performance of the day tbh. Fxckin Frank Kaminsky.
Frank Kaminsky
How the fuck do you lose to Frank Kaminsky and Nader?
"Frank Kaminsky woke up this morning and said ""Fuck the Warriors"""
"Frank ""Nikola Jokic"" Kaminsky"
Kings really waived Frank Kaminsky...
Is Frank Kaminsky the greatest player to ever wear #8?  I say yes
"I hate losing, but On the bright side, we took the Denver nuggets to double OT without Devin Booker, with Frank Kaminsky and Abdel Nader combining for 50 minutes. Additionally, Jokic, Murray, Morris, Kaminsky, and the refs were doing everything in their power to will the Nuggets to victory."
Easy to score on Frank Kaminsky
To be fair 12 of his points were against Frank Kaminsky. Ayton was a beast defensively
OT was basically Jokic abusing Frank Kaminsky for 10 mins
Just brutal to play hard for 50+ minutes and have to finish the game with Frank Kaminsky and Abdel Nader on the court
Yeah Jokic made Frank Kaminsky look like Frank Kaminsky
Frank Kaminsky guarding Joker was Tragic
Against Frank Kaminsky lol Ayton shut him down
good to know Frank Kaminsky is still dogshit. very questionable from Monty to put him in over Jalen Smith. Jokic cooking him bro.
Frank Kaminsky is going to foul out pretty soon
lmao Dozier felt the need to double sharpshooter Frank Kaminsky III
Frank Kaminsky almost. But they didn‚Äôt win.
Frank kaminsky is so bad. Paul starting to force stupid passes and no one setting screens or cutting. What a fucking joke
"I think the way NBA Draft Day trades work that would have been difficult.   Trades don‚Äôt happen that instant because it all happens in the old league year so that‚Äôs why you see Players wearing the hats of the wrong team even after they‚Äôre traded.   I assume as ugly as it would have been that Boston backs out of the deal before it‚Äôs officially finalized if Philly lies about Fultz and drafts Tatum.   Though if Micheal Jordan didn‚Äôt want Frank Kaminsky or Pat Riley didn‚Äôt want Justise Winslow then either the Hornets or Heat would have been in position to draft Tatum, Fultz, Ball, Fox, Etc  instead.   Danny Ainge desperately wanted Winslow in 2015 and was reported to have offered up the Nets picks in exchange but Jordan wanted Kaminsky and Riley wanted Winslow.   Nobody could have foreseen Sean Marks getting hired in Feb 2016 and tearing down the entire Roster for a Rebuild with barely any draft capital."
That's what you get when it's 2021 and you still have Frank Kaminsky getting playing time on your team. How is this person not in China yet?
"Haven‚Äôt been watching the game, why is big Frank Kaminsky gonna be playing the last 6 minutes of crunch time?"
Frank Kaminsky isos are the hallmark of an injured suns team
Frank ‚ÄòGary Harris‚Äô Kaminsky
Frank Kaminsky
I‚Äôm more amazed that Frank Kaminsky is still in the league.
Play kyle korver as a sf/pf? come on. It seems obvious to me they need to sign Dewayne Dedmon not Frank Kaminsky who is not a free agent.
"Frank ‚ÄúThe Clank‚Äù Kaminsky.  OK, I made that one up myself, but I felt good about it."
"Last year we lost Ayton, Baynes, and Rubio for stretches and were starting Frank Kaminsky at C while being forced to play Ty Jerome and Ellie Okobo at times. You just don‚Äôt know ball, it‚Äôs okay to admit it."
Add in the fact that we have available players (for now because I just jinxed that) as opposed to starting Frank Kaminsky at the 5 lol
Frank Kaminsky
Frank Kaminsky in shambles

We'll take him for Frank Kaminsky and a 2nd rounder in like 4 years
Way better than Frank Kaminsky and especially Damian Jones so no
"Wood is such a weird story. I was pretty high on him when Charlotte signed him in his second year. On paper he had all the tools to be a rotation big on a bad team.   Like even if he had zero basketball IQ, the 2016-17 Hornets should have been perfect for him- back then, if you could run pick and roll and kinda rebound and hustle a bit on defense, you could play center in Steve Clifford's system, and quite well at that.  Yet Wood saw a grand total of 107 minutes on a team that rolled out the following players at C/PF:  Cody Zeller - the incumbent started, played 62 games, starting most of them and playing 27mpg. The Hornets went 3-17 in his absence.  Frank Kaminsky - in his 2nd season, he played 75 games at 26mpg  Spencer Hawes - played 35 games, 18mpg before being traded  Roy Hibbert - played 42 games at 16mpg  Miles Plumlee - played 13 games 13mpg after a trade  Mike Tobey - played 2 games. His most memorable moment is because of our announcer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17do6ATYT_U  Johnny O'Bryant - played 4 games prior to an injury  Wood never even received an opportunity to get consistent minutes with that PF/C rotation. He must've really rubbed his coaches the wrong way or something, it made absolutely no sense at the time, and way less now."
"yeah ayton was suspended, baynes went down, FRANK KAMINSKY started 13 games. Cam Johnson and Mikal hadn‚Äôt found themselves yet. No cam payne. We still thought Dario was a PF. It‚Äôs just a totally different team this year. Obviously injuries and suspensions can still derail us this year but its just night and day with the roster."

"Honestly, I feel like that's an extra weird part for the Suns is that we've had a lot of player change as well.  I thought we were going to come off to a **WAY** slower start, because it takes time to build chemistry and we don't have the usual training camp this year.  * **Starters**    * Returning: Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges\*, Deandre Ayton    * New: Chris Paul, Jae Crowder * **Bench w/ 4+ GP**    * Returning: Cam Johnson,  Jevon Carter, Frank Kaminsky    * New: Langston Galloway, Damian Jones    * In-Between: Cam Payne\*\* * **Bench w/ 3- GP**    * Returning: Saric (2 GP)    * New: Jalen Smith (2 GP), E'Twaun Moore (1 GP), Ty-Shon Alexander (2 GP) * ***Notes***    * *(\*) Mikal noted as he started less than 50% of our games last year despite playing starter minutes*       * *Ayton not noted as the same as his lack of starting was due to Suspension.*    * *(\*\*) Cam Payne noted as in-between since we picked him up before the bubble.  Due to the chemistry we built in the bubble, I initially marked him as 'Returning', but think it's best to give him his own category as he was only with the team during the Bubble.*  Before we ended up grabbing Kaminsky after the Kings cut him, 50% of our roster is new (not including Payne.)  I think that the whole team deserves a fuckload of credit for making it work... Monty and CP3 for obvious reasons, but also the new guys for putting in the work and the returning players for helping bring them up to speed.  All that said, even though we're 5-1, it is clear that we're still trying to get our bearings as a team.  Mikal and Cam Johnson have been absolutely balling their fucking minds out as well as Payne this entire season -- and while their defense will stay, their shots will have to come down to earth, and then it will become more clear where our team is still needing to mesh.  * Mikal Bridges: 15.3 PPG on 53/50/100 Shooting Splits * Cam Johnson: 13.5 PPG on 52/43/100 Shoot Splits * Cam Payne: 8.5 PPG on 51/47/100 Shooting Splits  Where you'll start to see us struggle soon is going to be in comebacks.  The Suns strength is in dictating the pace of the game, and huge shoutout to Monty for this.  We're #30 in Pace, helping us to stay fresh while moving the ball around frequently for open shots.  In contrast, when we start trying to play too quickly, we turn the ball over frequently and get into offensive foul trouble.  It's honestly kind of Grizzlies-esque how they used to play with the Conley/Z-Bo/Gasol core with Tony Allen and various other role players.  Rather than being the 7SOL Suns, we're kind of the Grit &amp; Grind Suns with a 3-ball lol.  The secondary part that you'll see us start to struggle is when the 3 above-mentioned players have their shooting percentages come down to reasonable.  They are good shooters, but those are not sustainable splits... and our Offensive Rebounding Rate is 22nd in the NBA.  **We simply do not crash the offensive glass**, and this **will** hurt us when we start missing."
Frank Kaminsky plays basketball at an acceptable level.
"the suns weren‚Äôt exactly lucky when it came to injuries either lol, Frank Kaminsky and Elie Okobo were starters for a non-insignificant amount of time, and Oubre also missed a significant amount of time."
Timme isn't getting drafted or even an NBA level talent tbh.  Frank Kaminsky is barley sticking around in the league and he provides spacing.
I miss Frank Kaminsky lol
"But seriously yes.   I‚Äôve watched every suns game the last 3 years. I watched the suns be a shit stain of the NBA. A complete dumpster fire would be a compliment.   The Suns are a top team. With back to back Ws against the nuggets and jazz, 2-0 vs the leagues top team (for now), Ws against the Bucks, the 76ers, the Blazers, and the leagues best road record, an 8-0 bubble record, AND FRANK FUCKING KAMINSKY?   of course they are contenders.   Devin Booker has been embarrassing every single fucking defense this year with midrange mastery.  Chris Paul is State Farm.   Mikal Bridges puts the clamps on the opposing teams star day in and day out.   Luka Doncic is 1-7 vs. Deandre Ayton.   As an AZ sports fan, the real test comes in the playoffs where AZ sports always fall short, unless it‚Äôs the Phoenix Mercury or 2001 diamondbacks.   You‚Äôre god damn right we‚Äôre contenders."
Frank Kaminsky vs Matt Thomas
"For perspective, NBA superstars Frank Kaminsky and Sam Dekker carried there Wisconsin team to an NCAA championship where they lost to a squad of absolute league legends Jahlil Okafor, Justice Winslow, Tyus Jones, and Quinn Cook."
You misspelled Frank Kaminsky
They‚Äôd start Frank Kaminsky though
"don‚Äôt they rarely become good nba players though? I don‚Äôt watch enough cbb to know too many examples but Frank Mason, Yogi Ferrell, and Kaminsky were all college greats that never improved much after getting drafted"
I miss Frank Kaminsky
Mikal‚Äôs cutting makes Frank Kaminsky look like a passing savant. I can‚Äôt even imagine what he would look like with Jokic
"Frank Kaminsky.  The Suns are undefeated in games in which Frank the Tank comes off the bench and Phoenix outscores the opposition. The man is a living, breathing, four leaf clover."
Frank Kaminsky
Frank Kaminsky
"he was starting at the beginning of the season, but then the Suns went with Cam Johnson for a few games while Crowder missed a few games with injury. Then it was Frank Kaminsky for a while to match up with bigger lineups. They went back to Crowder starting this month cause he's the better starting 4."
Can we all take a moment and appreciate that Cam Payne and Frank Kaminsky are playing meaningful rotation minutes on the 3rd best record team in the league?  Shoutout Abdel Nader too
"Cam Payne and Frank Kaminsky looked like Stockton and Malone attacking Wiseman a few games ago. Wiseman has no clue what he‚Äôs supposed to be doing defensively, looks completely lost."
"Wait, your favorite Hornet isn‚Äôt Frank Kaminsky?!? Damn, no love."
What are you talking about? Frank Kaminsky never played with Bruce Brown.
He‚Äôs a 19 year old rollercoaster. Some games he looks like a mix of Giannis and Chris Bosh other games he‚Äôll make Frank Kaminsky look like Hakeem.
"Read about it here: https://www.barstoolsports.com/blog/529285/pardon-my-take-4-20-with-frank-kaminsky-and-spencer-hawes-from-the-charlotte-hornets  On the 4/20/2016 Pardon My Take episode, Hawes &amp; Kaminsky talked about it."
"He got addicted to buying gas station scratch-off tickets. Its some scary stuff, and it ruins lives. Ever since Spencer Hawes &amp; Frank Kaminsky got him hooked, Psycho T hasn't been the same."
All this to overcome prime Frank Kaminsky in the 2nd round
"Yeah, our comparison for ""whiffing on a pick"" is taking Frank Kaminsky instead of Devin Booker. We'll take Miles Bridges every day."
"The disrespect to Frank Kaminsky, good lord. Nephews out of control on this site"
I would prefer LMA to Frank Kaminsky
"i would seriously have to think about whether or not i would want him getting bench minutes over frank kaminsky. dario saric? absolutely not, not even close. and frank gets DNPs for us sometimes. he's scoring 12 points in 30mpg on under 50%ts, which is god awful. more than half his shots are threes and he shoots 30% from there."
Okc doesn‚Äôt need a budget Frank kaminsky lol
Don't throw the Moose away he's like a budget Frank Kaminsky.  He also showed loyalty to the franchise a few years ago; when Presti decided to blow it up he had signed both Alec Burks and Mike which is all that they could do since they were hard-capped. They gave both of those guys the chance to sign elsewhere. Burks left and Mike stayed.
"Generally speaking, once Kupchak was hired we started cutting losses from the end of the Bobcats-early Hornets 2.0 era and started drafting a lot better. We didn‚Äôt have much to build on and our picks were still in the 9-12 range for the several drafts before last year‚Äôs. We let Kemba walk in free agency, along with MKG, Marvin Williams, Frank Kaminsky, etc, as all were kinda one side of the ball limited players.   Kupchak has drafted Miles Bridges (12th), Devonte‚Äô Graham (35th), PJ Washington (12th), and LaMelo (2nd). We‚Äôve picked up Cody and Caleb Martin, and Jalen McDaniels as second rounders or undrafted free agents with some potential. We got Terry Rozier in a sign and trade with Boston when Kemba left and the contract was considered iffy, but he‚Äôs definitely lived up to it. We also signed Hayward this offseason with a similar reaction from the league and he‚Äôs still got a ways to go to earn it, but so far, so good. Only Malik Monk and Cody Zeller remain from the pre-Kupchak era and we brought Bismack Biyombo back.   We‚Äôre still kinda straddling building for the future and winning now, but the general consensus is that we‚Äôre young and competitive with potential to internally improve. We still need a solid big man or three, but otherwise we‚Äôve got a pretty solid roster for now and the future."
"Players that are no longer on the team from 2 years ago (not gonna name EVERYONE, just the notables):  Qunicy Acy, Ryan Anderson, Trevor Ariza, Dragen Bender, Isiah Canaan. Tyson Chandler. Jamal Crawford. Troy Daniels, Jimmer Freddette, Richaun Holmes, Josh Jackson, Tyler Johnson, TJ Warren  Players that remained on the team:  Deandre Ayton, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges  Players they have acquired since then that are on the team this year:  Cameron Johnson, Chris Paul, Jaw Crowder, Jalen Smith, Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky, Cameron Payne, E'Twuan Moore  I dont know about Monty but James Jones deserves a ton of credit."
FRANK KAMINSKY
Oh and Frank Kaminsky realized he's the best PF in the NBA
Jokic is a poor mans frank kaminsky
This game is ugly all around. Suns leaning on Frank Kaminsky for their offense is a...bold choice.
"MJ drafted Frank Kaminsky with the 9th overall pick. If that isn't shitposting, I don't know what is."
"It‚Äôs not even a rule change, that was just a ref intentionally being awful. Suspension or some accountability needs to happen, not only for this particular call but for the countless other awful ones throughout the game.   Malik Monk got called for a T after a dunk when he let out a normal hype yell in celebration. Booker got called for a T for a little bit of jawing toward the hornets bench after a fast break dunk. There was a no call when Frank kaminsky slashed Rozier across his cheek on a 3 point attempt and a no call on a LaMelo 3 attempt when two defenders clearly fouled him.  Just atrocious."
Fuck Frank Kaminsky and these goddamn zebras
Frank Kaminsky
"Honesty the team has just gotten way better overall. CP3 and book are obviously key, but giving either of them all the credit is short sided. Mikal has taken a leap. Cam Johnson is better. Ayton has improved  defensively and in rebounding while keeping decent offensive ability. We added crowder, etwuan Moore, Nader, and Langston Galloway. Also Dario and frank kaminsky have been playing some of their best basketball. It has really been a team effort.  Edit: I forgot Cam Payne who went from being out of the league to being a solid backup pg. he‚Äôs shooting 43% from 3 when he was closer to 32% previously."
Frank Kaminsky
"""CP"" is a weird way to spell ""Frank Kaminsky"""
"Everyone who is not a casual knows that the Suns being good is the result of many things:  ‚Ä¢ DBook being a bucket ‚Ä¢ Mikal stepping up and improving. Dude is a really good defender and his putting up good numbers on offense as well (while having a crazy drip too) ‚Ä¢ Ayton is not improving like crazy, but it‚Äôs a consistent center who I personally like a lot. ‚Ä¢ Cam Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Saric all being solid (especially Cam) ‚Ä¢ And then obviously adding an all star veteran like CP3 will do it"
"He definitely puts us over the top but it's more or less health and availability this year thats the biggest difference from last year. Last year starting with the Ayton suspension to Baynes getting injured and starting Frank Kaminsky at the 5 led to lot of bad losses. Once we had mostly everyone back from the bubble we went 8-0, and our play now is more reminiscent of that"
He would easily be the worst big man on our team. Including Frank Kaminsky. And at least Damien Jones can play Center.  Cousins is so bad now that the only reason you want him is because he's one of your favorite players
"Frank Kaminsky is, but only when he passes to Mikal Bridges."
"You misspelled Frank Kaminsky but it‚Äôs ok, I knew that‚Äôs what you meant."
"Mikal is a 3 and D guy who's developed a good feel for cuts and has acquired that 2K badge for scoring across the lane at least at a silver level irl.  We have two meme stats though - we're undefeated when Frank Kaminsky starts so far (9-0) as well as having a very, very high win percentage in games where Mikal makes his first 3"
The Suns will give you Dario Saric and Frank Kaminsky. Take it or leave it!
As a UA alum I hate Frank Kaminsky but I'm weirdly ok with this.
Suns are now 9-0 with Frank Kaminsky starting at PF
"born and raised in Ohio, got to go see us get pummeled by Frank Kaminsky &amp; Sam Dekker in the 2014-2015 season, but I loved D-Lo."
"Wait, you‚Äôre telling me paying Cody Zeller, Nic Batum, and drafting Frank the Tank Kaminsky are mistakes?"
"Yeah, I can't believe they let Frank Kaminsky walk"
Yeah and Charlotte declined the offer and used that pick on Frank Kaminsky
"There was one time a few seasons ago where we had a really fun W for the first time in ages and after a big Frank Kaminsky 3 late on the 4th, he goes ""This is fun!"" Like it was his first time watching a basketball game. Ever since that moment I have hoped for a team that would be fun every night purely for the sake of Eric Collins, and good golly miss molly I think we might have one here."
Suns are 8-0 when starting Frank Kaminsky
Suns are 8-0 when starting Frank Kaminsky
frank kaminsky
High upside ? What's the upside ? At the very best he shoots it well from 3 and then he's basically Frank Kaminsky. He can't defend or finish at the rim because he just can't move at all anymore.  Like for real I think he might be even less athletic than Marc Gasol
"He has showed that he was healthy for sure, not sure how someone can say he's proved that he was impactful, he's a center who can't defend in space, is a mediocre rim protector, has a 51%TS because he can't finish anything at the rim  So basically at this point he's Frank Kaminsky with better passing"
Imagine telling people a few years ago that Cameron Payne and Frank Kaminsky would drag a team to the playoffs.
Suns go 6-0 with Kaminsky in the starting lineup. Bench Frank and give him no play and the Suns blow a huge second half lead. True MVP /s
If you listen closely you can hear Frank Kaminsky fading back into obscurity
- Frank Kaminsky
"Frank Kaminsky looks like a regular guy that you stretched out and Mikal Bridges looks like Oscar from Shark Tale. Christian Wood looks like Scottie Pippen and I‚Äôm not even sure that Jae‚ÄôSean Tate is a real person.   2&gt;1. Sorry, I win, you lose."
Give me a duo and I‚Äôll promptly explain why the Frank Kaminsky/Mikal Bridges duo shits all over them.

because he's actually frank kaminsky
Why the fuck do you have frank kaminsky on your fantasy team
Frank Kaminsky is a poor man Chris Kaman
"Kaminsky put his left hand on Giannis right arm multiple times before that happened. Probably should have been a foul on the floor on Frank. Can't do that   https://twitter.com/TrevorMBooth/status/1359721709700411392?s=19  The baseline angle shows it even better, but clear in that video too.   Suns got some cheap stuff with CP3 rip throughs and fouls early in 3rd q."
Frank Kaminsky looking to challenge Jokic as the best passing 7 footer.
Bro  they finna lose offensive rebounds to fucking frank kaminsky
Now get me frank kaminsky
Frank Kaminsky and Cam Payne are both important members of the team. I would have laughed/cried in your face if you told me that a couple years back.
That‚Äôs the intimidating influence of Frank Kaminsky
Frank Kaminsky
Anybody got the gif of Frank Kaminsky giving the thumbs up to Javale McGee as he was ejected?
"I remember that one well, I was furious that we were getting cooked by Frank Kaminsky"
KEKW yea bro just like tonight. Frank Kaminsky and Jae Crowder will be ready come playoff time tho they are not players you want to fuck with
KEKW yea bro no way they can shut down Frank Kaminsky for a playoff series
Frank Kaminsky (except when filling in for injuries)
Hey man Frank Kaminsky also doesn‚Äôt have a FMVP but look where he is today. Don‚Äôt give up on Curry that easily!
Harden &gt; Frank Kaminsky
You think Frank Kaminsky normally gets minutes?
Exactly I‚Äôm clad you recognized that. Dell and Collins always praise the opponent they just don‚Äôt hype them up. Only guys I‚Äôve seen them act like dicks over is Frank Kaminsky and Marvin Bagley over his defense.
"Thats what happens when you rely on a 22 year old &amp; Frank Kaminsky for post defense &amp; rim protection. Its problematic vs a big like Anthony Davis, especially when hes aggressive."
"they had frank kaminsky on AD lmao, wtf he gonna do"
God Frank Kaminsky has been abused this game
Some people think Frank the Tank Kaminsky is better than Lauri Markkanen. This is 2021.
have you seen Frank Kaminsky?
"So like is your point that he‚Äôs bad, he‚Äôs good, he‚Äôs average, what? Nobody knows how you view frank kaminsky"
Really underselling frank kaminsky here
Frank Kaminsky
"Dude, DeAndre Ayton, Frank Kaminsky &amp; Dario Saric have no chance against AD &amp; LeBron. Even if they're not 100%. Suns would probably be your ideal first round matchup."
Frank Kaminsky is a decent rotation big. I've enjoyed how he's gone about his business during his time in Phoenix.
A team giving Frank Kaminsky and Cam Payne quality minutes does not have the best depth in the NBA
I had a teammate at a Canadian college who played againt Kaminsky at his previous school for an exhibition and he said he was amazing lol. This guy dominated the few games he played for us but was getting absolutely tossed by Frank the Tank the previous year.
The UK squad that couldn‚Äôt even beat the  Wisconsin team led by legends Frank Kaminsky and Sam Dekker?
Frank Kaminsky
Put Frank Kaminsky there are any three of them would‚Äôve gone back the other way with two more points on the stat sheet
That was a drive in which Frank Kaminsky brought Torrey in to the perfect spot to play help defense and he got the block from behind on the drive.
"&gt;Guess Frank is officially higher than Dario on the depth chart now, that‚Äôs definitely not something I anticipated happening.  Frank's only higher in the depth chart because Saric is still injured. If he has no further setbacks, he'll be over Kaminsky in the playoffs.  Saric has really struggled defensively since he first got injured, though. He's never been good defensively, but he plain sucks now. It's a big issue for us. But it gives Craig more minutes, and he's been amazing for us since the trade. He's going to be a weapon for us in the playoffs."
"Suns against 76ers...and they win in 6 (remember, we are assuming both the Lakers and Nets don't make the finals, which means we are assuming the Suns probably beat the Lakers en route to the Finals which would be an insane momentum booster for them).   Monty just has too many weapons in his disposal, he can make 3 teams from his roster (those who watch suns games regularly know) , especially his bench who we have seen beat the starters of other teams on numerous occasions on their current 53-18 run from last season's 8-0 run in the bubble!:  Team 1 : Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, DeAndre Ayton  Team 2 : Cameron Payne, Langston Galloway, Cameron Johnson, Torrey Craig, Dario Saric  Team 3 : E'Twaun Moore, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader, Jalen Smith, Frank Kaminsky  The only person among the 15 ppl here who is unproven is the 10th draft pick Jalen Smith who hasn't gotten any burn.   We've seen Team 2 outscore other starting lineups with their 3 pt shooting (3pt percentages = Payne 40.7%, Galloway 45.1%, Johnson 36%, Craig 38.2%, Saric 34.5 %) and defense  And We've seen team team 2 win it as well in pt differential with defense (Carter/Nader) and microwave offense as well (Moore, who's been a 7.9ppg scorer in his CAREER and Kaminsky who had a personal 7-0 run against the clippers just a few days ago).   The Suns haven't been this deep, even dating back to the late 80s and 90s KJ and Barkley teams as well as the SSOL teams. There isn't a drop off whenever the starters leave the court, both on offense and defense. Them sweeping the Jazz and being 27-9 against. 500 and above teams is also a solid indicator of how well they hold up against playoff teams.   I honestly think they have as great a chance as any even if the Lakers were at full strength because of the chemistry and cohesion that hasn't been seen in a Suns team in over a decade worth of basketball... And as u can see, it's not only because Of Chris Paul but because of their really good roster from top to bottom.   Suns will be champions this year, and will win 4 games before losing 4 games against any team in a 7 game SERIES (they haven't lost more than 2 in a row in months... Wc is also testament to Monty and his coaching staff) . GO SUNS!!!"
"Dario is more of a 5 than a 4. He prefers playing 5, he's been playing the 5, and he is better at playing the 5.  Also, Frank Kaminsky is Frank the Tank."
"Ranking our bench contributors:  1. Cameron Payne  2. Cameron Johnson  3. Dario Saric  4. Torrey Craig  5. Jevon Carter  Wild cards / unlikely to get playing time in the playoffs, but still threats:  1. Langston Galloway  2. Frank Kaminsky  3. Abdel Nader (if he is even healthy by the playoffs)  Payne is the go-to guy when book / cp3 are off the floor. Even when payne shares time with Book, they are 1A / 1B together. He leads our team in buckets near the end of the shot clock, and we sort of trust him to bail us out when nothing's going in.  Cameron Johnson is a guy who's gonna keep shooting no matter what. He could have 3 points on 1 of 9 and still get hot and make any game into a blowout. He's also an underrated defender, rebounder, and has a nice dribble-drive.   Saric has slumped hard for a few months but before that, he was the best backup big man in the entire league, almost averaging 50/40/90 on double digit scoring and elite defense. Those numbers have angrily regressed to the mean unfortunately, but we're all holding out hope that he progresses back somewhat.  Torrey Craig is one of the most valuable bench pieces regardless of scoring. He is maybe second to Ayton in terms of rebounding, aggressively chasing every defensive and offensive rebound. He's one of the few people on this team who can consistently play above the rim and has a trustworthy shot from 3. We never ask him to create but every now and then he will surprise with an end-of-shotclock midrange that goes in.  Jevon Carter is a guy who we've been trying to figure out his role on the team for a bit. He's usually the guy we sic on opposing guards to harass them for 94 feet but his shot has been solidly improving over the last month and a half or so. We've basically allowed him a green light on catch-and-shoot 3s to try and take out the decision making and it's had pretty solid success. He also has an underrated midrange but we don't ever really want him to take multiple in a game unless we're leading by double digits.  Wild cards:  Langston is instant offense. Second fastest slinger in the west behind Curry. When he's in we basically ask him to run the corners, spot up, and pull if he has 2 inches of space on the 3. Sometimes he gets supernova hot and ends up with double digits in 2-4 minutes of game time. He's a defensive liability unfortunately.  Kaminsky is our NONONOYES guy, but that also makes him our NONONONO guy. Sometimes he plays really, really well and that makes our weakness of relying on Saric less of a weakness. Unfortunately, if he makes 1 3, he'll try to go for another through a stepback.  Nader -- when he played -- was maybe the only guy on the team with a consistent ability to get to the line. He was also a big body who could sometimes hit crucial 3s, but nobody really trusted him over any of the wings. The addition of Torrey Craig has made his niche on the team mostly irrelevant, although it will be nice to see him back if he can recover from his knee arthroscopy before the end of the season (unlikely)."
There's also Frank Kaminsky and Dario Saric
"Gentle reminder that the first game Draymond played the Suns after saying this, he dropped 2p4r6a in 25 minutes against the booker-less Suns, ultimately getting blown out by 21 by two guys collecting DNPs, Abdel Nader and Frank Kaminsky, who combined for 28 points, 18 rebounds, and 11 assists.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202101280PHO.html"
You that high on frank kaminsky?
They had an amazing series against the heat in 2016. Kemba/Jeremy Lin/Courtney Lee were so fun to watch play together and Frank Kaminsky had a huge game 6 if I remember correctly. It was a shame they couldn‚Äôt win the series.
"This season he's averaging 16/4.5/9.  His scoring number need to be higher for the MVP. But, that's the beauty of this Suns team. It's pretty dang balanced. While CP3 and to a lesser extent Booker dominate in the clutch, everyone else put's together solid scoring games to keep us in. Cam Payne had a big stretch for us last night, as did Frank Kaminsky. 2 nights ago, Cam Johnson had a big 4th quarter, etc. etc."
Outside of our best 4 players we‚Äôve been pretty banged up. We have a deep enough backcourt/wing rotation that it hasn‚Äôt hurt us but there‚Äôs been plenty of games where Frank Kaminsky gets molested on defense
sign Frank Kaminsky
Frank Kaminsky
That Phoenix center rotation is going to be critical in the playoffs. I‚Äôm not sure if I trust ayton and frank kaminsky
So can we put Frank Kaminsky in the MVP conversation yet?
god i hope we don't lose to frank kaminsky. no offense frank
just got here. is Frank Kaminsky god?
Frank Kaminsky is literally better than all of them
Damian Jones cant really hang at center against the big bois either. Frank Kaminsky beat him out of a roster spot on the Suns...
"Frank Kaminsky. If it's a real player, probably Aaron Barnes or Valentine."
44 year old Lebron would be about as good as Frank Kaminsky with elite vision. So I'd say 48 would probably be the end of it.
We were not at 100%. Baynes and Oubre were both out for the entirety of the bubble. We had Cheick Diallo and Frank Kaminsky playing backup minutes.
He's just being noticed on Reddit more because he's getting more opportunities for amazing calls with Lamelo and Miles Bridges than he would have in years past with Nic Batum and Frank Kaminsky.
Jokic is a poor mans Frank Kaminsky nothing more nothing less
Frank Kaminsky effect
Frank Kaminsky is a ratings draw
I‚Äôm not an anti stats guy but more and more I think a lot of advanced stats must be seriously flawed. Maybe the difference is between the regular season and the playoffs. Many stats rate booker as closer to frank kaminsky offensively than CP3 and it just illustrates the foolishness of some of them.
Frank Kaminsky!
Fucking Frank Kaminsky. Fuck.
Fuck frank Kaminsky
"If Frank Kaminsky only gets in the game during garbage time for the remainder of the playoffs, will that impact his legacy?"
"FRANK KAMINSKY, BABY"
frank kaminsky won't have none of those
Frank kaminsky!
Frank Kaminsky was snacking on his mask
I remember thinking Frank Kaminsky was gonna be good
"pretty much. we only drafted two (Frank in 2015 and Zeller in 2013) but we had a bunch around that time  between 2015-16 and 2016-17 we had something like 6 of them. Kaminsky, Zeller, Hawes, Hansbrough, Miles Plumlee, Mike Tobey. and I definitely could be missing one.  We played all of them over a young Christian Wood. Fuck you Steve Clifford."
Is Frank Kaminsky the reason that Charlotte got the reputation of having big white centers?
Frank Kaminsky once he retires
"Hey now, Frank Kaminsky missed a random three pointer at the end of regulation and ended 0-1"
I love that whether or not Frank Kaminsky had minutes is an appropriate barometer for how close the game is
"Frank ""Cosmetic"" Kaminsky"
YES feed the flames of the classic Austin Rivers - Frank Kaminsky rivalry
Frank Kaminsky
Maybe Frank Kaminsky
"Suns starting lineup last year was #1 in net rating IIRC, but Ayton's suspension and Baynes injuries forced the team to start Frank Kaminsky at Center, and Rubio was always banged up"
"Bucks need another superstar so bad, better sign Frank Kaminsky asap"
"**Top 7 guaranteed protected for the Suns:**  Devin Booker  Chris Paul  Deandre Ayton  Mikal Bridges  Jae Crowder  Cam Johnson  Cam Payne  &amp;#x200B;  **Last protected slot:**  Either Torrey Craig or Dario Saric. Craig is a great spark plug and can hit the three ball well but Dario probably has a higher ceiling with his size, spacing, and passing ability. Saric is rather inconsistent though.  &amp;#x200B;  **So who would get poached:**  Whichever player out of Saric and Craig isn't protected would absolutely get taken.  Jevon Carter (his toughness on defense is great. When he gets in a rhythm/feel for the ball he has a decent shot)  &amp;#x200B;  **Possibly poached but not really rotation guys:**  E'twaun Moore (serviceable veteran backup guard)  Abdel Nader (haven't seen him in a while but we got a lot out of him when he played)  Frank Kaminsky (he's the tank)  &amp;#x200B;  **Unlikely to get poached due to inability to crack the Suns rotation:**  Jalen Smith (he plays a tough bruising style but is very raw)  Ty-Shon Alexander (I have never seen this man)  Langston Galloway (Probably has the highest percentage of and-1 3s out of total fgs made in nba history)"
Suns don‚Äôt win this game without frank kaminsky
"On the flip side, a world where Adam Morrison and Frank Kaminsky share three rings and the Hornets have none is rather bleak."
"chris paul is on a mission, everyone look out.   i want to see frank kaminsky in every single game. He is our victory cigar and i love him."
Frank Kaminsky era
GIVE US FRANK KAMINSKY VS BOL BOL YOU COWARDS
I'm only watching for Frank Kaminsky and he's not even on the floor
"Mikal Bridges and Frank Kaminsky. Those two love each other, wholesome af whenever they assist it to the other"
"Suns bench:  Guards - Cam Payne (can start on any team), Etwan Moore (proven vet) Langston Galloway (Microwave scorer from downtown and proven starter), Jevon Carter (best defender among the guards and capable 3pt shooter), Tyshon Alexander (rookie, 3 pt sniper)  Forwards - Cam Johnson (has been a starter as well), Torrey Craig (Proven Vet and rebounder w a sweet 3pt stroke)  PF/C - Dario Saric (proven stretch big), Frank Kaminsky (also proven stretch big) - both of them are capable passers btw ; Jalen Smith (Rookie but can shoot the 3 and block shots/rebound)  Just looking at the Bench, we can field another starting 5 with Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig and Dario Saric and still be able to defend and outscore another average NBA starting 5, and have capable backups in Galloway, Jevon Carter, and Frank Kaminsky to run vs other 2nd units...that's a DEEP bench right there...  I don't think the hawks have a much better bench TBH, outside of Gallinari, Lou Williams and Huerter... Quite the opposite TBH with the Suns probably having the best Bench composition in the entire league TBH.  The bench has been one of the major strengths of the Suns and will be for years to come . Go SUNS!!!!"
Frank Kaminsky
"They had the highest FG% in the league‚Ä¶ the top 2 jump shot percentage shooters (book&amp;paul) they shoot well man‚Ä¶ the suns roster is stacked with 3 and defense guys, Craig, crowder, Johnson, Payne‚Ä¶. Even sacric and frank kaminsky can shoot the 3"
The other option is Frank Kaminsky
"I saw a lot of trade down options but even those were going to be rough. I saw a lot of a lower pick and Trey Lyes, Frank Kaminsky, Josh Jackson, and Markennen (hind sight this would of been okay).   Signed Lamar Odom..... WHO WAS ON CRACK.   Traded away Jr Smith, Shumpert, and Tyson Chandler for peanuts. We did not get any value in return, only the tank commander Lance Thomas. Tyson went on to have a resurgent year while Jr and shump were key parts to the Cavs championship win.  Drafted Frank: I love and support Frank but after 4 seasons, he‚Äôs failed to live up to any expectations. I still think he needs more opportunity as he showed flashes but the general consensus is that he was a bad pick.   Hired Derrick Fisher and Hornacek while forcing them to implement the Triangle offense. I don‚Äôt think I need this mess.   Signed Joahkim Noah and Courtney Lee to 4 year deals: Lee was an average role player getting big money and Noah was a corpse of himself. We are still paying Noah....  Ruined Melo‚Äôs last years: this is more the organization as a whole but Melo stayed committed to NY but they still failed to bring him any real change of winning after the 2013 season."
Frank Kaminsky
I hope the suns win so Frank Kaminsky can finally get that chip
I'd definitely rather have Crowder on him than Kaminsky. We lost a game against them earlier this season and it was largely because Ayton fouled out late and Jokic just killed Frank.
Cameron Johnson  ‚ùå  Frank Kaminsky ‚ùå  Cameron Payne ‚ùå  Dario Saric ‚ùå  Torrey Craig ‚ùå  Jevon Carter ‚ùå  After those guys I'll consider Kuzma

More memorable than a Frank Kaminsky bucket in a blowout
That's NCAA championship runner up Frank Kaminsky to you
Naw there are like 8 posts about minor Lebron plays that are more upvoted than this because they feed the anti-Lebron circlejerk.  This is objectively a much cooler post and overall moment than Lebron not putting effort against Frank Kaminsky in a blowout loss.

"Frank ""Rim protector"" Kaminsky"
"The Suns were having a hard time against Anthony Davis alongside the rest of the mass the Lakers have inside. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a Suns fan around who didn‚Äôt expect the Lakers to be a tough matchup, because the Suns have only one true big, then just Dario Saric and Frank Kaminsky, both of whom more naturally play the 5 as a secondary position.  I also don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a reasonable Suns fan who thinks that the rest of the playoffs will be a cakewalk. But the way the team performed throughout the season, Suns fans have good reason to feel confident.  Winning the championship? Maybe. Maybe not. Paul‚Äôs super important as a facilitator and a leader. But you‚Äôre making this team sound worse than it‚Äôs played."

Why does Kaminsky get minutes over Saric? I get Saric is ‚Äúundersized‚Äù but man Frank isn‚Äôt it
Bro sub Kaminsky out  I dunno how Suns have the 2nd best record in the West with Saric and Frank as backup bigs
thankful for Frank Kaminsky thinking he should call his own number.
They lost to Wisconsin right. The only players I can remember who went to the NBA from that team were Frank Kaminsky ironically plays with Booker now and Sam Decker who I can‚Äôt remember the last time I heard his name called.
&gt; Edit: the math alone should tell you it's false. If they had an 138 ORTG in 40 minutes they'd have to score negative points to be at 107 for the game   Brutal indictment of Frank Kaminsky

How different is this series if Frank Kaminsky and Frank Vogel switch roles?
I never want to see Frank Kaminsky ever again.
lmao frank kaminsky in the playoffs? waving the white flag
"It‚Äôs not tho. Porzingis was the best option the Knicks honestly could‚Äôve gotten at the 4th pick. The picks after Porzingis were, in order, Mario hezonja, willie cauley stein, Emmanuel mudiay, Stanley johnson, frank kaminsky, and Justise Winslow. Porzingis, despite his problems, is still a significantly better player than all of those players. For it to be a cautionary tale, it has to be a bad pick or something the team regrets. I guarantee you the Knicks do not regret drafting Porzingis over someone like Emmanuel mudiay. Honestly this draft actually disproves your point. Jahlil okafor is the typical ‚Äúbig man‚Äù with typical ‚Äúbig man skills‚Äù contrary to Porzingis. However, jahlil okafor turned out to be way worse than Porzingis. A better point would honestly be that it‚Äôs a cautionary tale to not take typical big man over unicorn big men"
"Kwame is not saying he wasn't a bust. He is just sick and tired of his name being used as a punchline when he was a serviceable player that lasted 12 years in the league. His only crime was getting drafted No. 1 and he didn't draft himself. PG13% is not personal, it's a joke. If someone gets on TV calling him a scrub, saying he is less than a player or a fraud who fleeced the Clippers then that's personal. MJ has drafted several busts from Adam Morrison to Cody Zeller to Frank Kaminsky why don't they get similar disrespect? Kobe also played with several other busts too. Let him be. He has retired. I am surprised he waited 20 years to finally fire back at these idiots. It took way too long. Should have happened a mighty long time."
We need to clone him because once he‚Äôs off the floor we have Frank Kaminsky

Understandable Jalen Smith is a sweet player. What about Frank Kaminsky?
The Lakers will get better. Embiid is an MVP caliber player and doesnt fold under pressure like ADisney. Embiid can actually carry a team and score when it matters. ADisney got exposed by Frank Kaminsky this afternoon.
 Just wait until we put frank kaminsky in bitches
"God forbid I point out that we lost our only true backup big man in a series where the opponent's best player is a 6'11 Greek Adonis, forcing us to play either Frank Kaminsky or go super small with Cam Johnson or Torrey Craig at the 5. What a ridiculous notion."
"I'm trying lad i reall am lol how about you give us Jrue holiday for frank Kaminsky the 3rd? sound like a fair trade?????   I'm just salty lol congrats if you win it in 6 you'll have definitely deserved it if you do in fact win itü§ù, i pray you don't tho lol"
Saric means we don‚Äôt have to play Frank Kaminsky if we don‚Äôt want to be tiring out Ayton
"I love me some Frank Kaminsky but come on lol, he's tall but has short arms and gets pushed around too much down low"
Frank kaminsky
Weezy F Baby and the F is for Frank Kaminsky
Take your Suns for example.  I'm sure the coaches would want option to play Kevin Love instead of Frank Kaminsky if Ayton was in foul trouble.  Gives them extra flexibility.
think it‚Äôs a steal for the blazers if they trade dame to the suns for the GOAT frank kaminsky
"&gt;Lopez is not a better scorer than Olynk, I don‚Äôt see how anyone is gonna argue this. There‚Äôs a fucking reason teams don‚Äôt have him shooting 12 hook shots a game.  Theres also a fucking reason it took almost a decade for Kelly Olynyk to take 12 shots a game, and that's because it leads to losing basketball. Literally 29 other teams wouldn't allow it, congrats he found the #1.  You're coming soooo close to my point and still not getting it. If Robin Lopez averaged 12 shots a game the team would suck ass. Yes. You've gotten that point. Guess what happened when a team let Kelly Olynyk average 12 shots/game? Worst ORtg in the league.  **Its the same concept** we just saw one where the situation actually occurred. And it led to a predictably terrible product.  No decent team is actually gonna give him a decent contract based on his scoring because its not actually scalable - its just based on opportunity.   &gt;What you said about Olynk never averaging 10 PPG is objectively wrong as well.   I said never averaging more, and you're right I missed that he once averaged 11.5. Wowee!!  Frank Kaminsky is a better scorer for Robin Lopez too, but good thing we dont just judge value based on scoring especially from a career backup C."
"&gt;olynyk had a change of scenery and hit 39.2% of his 3s at 4.6 attempts a game (less 3pa than he was shooting with miami). he attempted 3 more shots a game and got his splits up across the board to 64/39/84 while averaging 19/8/4  He the opportunity to play 31.1 minutes per game because he was never pulled for being an absolutely terrible defender. Literally his shooting is the only reason Olynyk is still in the NBA - and he only got high volume due to being on a bad a team that didn't care about his defense because they were trying to lose.  Any decent team is going to severely restrict his minutes due to his influence on winning basketball on the defensive end. Houston had the 4th worst defense last year and would have been even worse if they had their post-trade roster all year.  A half season of 3 point shooting is a small sample size vs his entire career anyway, and when his ""normal"" is only taking 6-8 shots per game total, his offensive influence is going to be severely muted.  Give me any of those guys I mentioned for their defensive impact on every play over Olynyk giving me like 2-3 3s per game which is really negligible at the end of the day.  Like Miami was a team that *needed* spacing, and Olynyk wasn't good enough for them to want to keep him; his skillset is empirically proven to not really be scalable outside of being a backup big for a decent team.  Like Frank Kaminsky is a good shooter too, but you dont see any team actually trying to win games paying him big bucks."
"If they had a bigger 4 and at least a backup big who isn't Dario Saric or Frank Kaminsky they would be immensely better. It would never be as effective as the raptors, but the gameplan would be similar."
There‚Äôs not enough Frank Kaminsky in this game
My franchise drafted Frank Kaminsky over devin booker
Frank the tank Kaminsky
Frank Kaminsky
are you talking about Wisconsin legend Frank Kaminsky? He is ELITE
Giannis has a career FT% of 71.7% and Giannis often finishes the And-1 through contact.  He‚Äôs not comparable to Shaq as a free throw shooter and giving up over 1.4PPP is terrible defense.  Plus the suns are basically only playing 7 guys the only guy they can let foul him is Kaminsky but you can‚Äôt play Frank and Ayton together
doesn't matter? if Ayton fouls out they throwing Frank Kaminsky in.

"Well, it's kind of the Bucks put us away. But the Bucks only put us away in the 3rd because Monty inexplicably pulled the small ball lineup that cut the lead to 4 in the 3rd to insert... Frank Kaminsky and Abdel Nader. Then within 3minutes it was basically a 20pt lead.   He pulled a similar move in the second when the Suns were up by 6 and watched lead VANISH"
Jokic &gt; Frank Kaminsky fyi don't@me
you will soon and that‚Äôs called Cam Johnson at the 5 since their 2nd best option to backup Ayton rn is Frank Kaminsky
"Meanwhile, Dallas fans are furiously photoshopping our realistic option, Frank Kaminsky"
As an Arizona alum I hate Frank Kaminsky and Sam Dekker with all of my heart. I hope Dekker is an enterprise rent a car manager.
The day frank kaminsky can score 30 against the hawks is the day I die. So much brook disrespect here
I honestly and sincerely think that the frank kaminsky getting Dario saric‚Äôs minutes has 0 effect on who wins these finals
Frank Kaminsky doesn‚Äôt even watch Frank Kaminsky play.
"As a Bucks fan I always love playing a Frank Kaminsky team when he gets minutes lol. Badger pride, and Giannis and the Bucks always feast on him."
Is Frank Kaminsky a super star?
"Trading for Marc Gasol didn't make the Raptors definitively better than the 76ers, Bucks or Warriors in 2019, and it came at the price of two former first rounders (both drafted higher than Maxey and Thybulle!) that the Raptors spent years developing. But they did the trade anyways, the stars aligned, and the team won a championship.  The reality is that Lowry would have given the 76ers a golden opportunity to win it all this year considering the fact that the Nets got hobbled, the Bucks are coached by Bud, and the Suns' backup centers are Dario Saric and Frank Kaminsky. AND the reports indicated that Lowry would have re-signed with the team that traded for him, in case things didn't work out this year. Oh well."
Frank Kaminsky has played in a finals before Kemba and thats a damn crime.
Frank Kaminsky only ever got in before if it was a blowout so it's pretty understanding that someone who only plays when it doesn't matter is performing poorly when it does matter
"Random, but I was a 5th grader in Madison when the Badgers made that run in 2015. Frank the Tank, Sam Dekker, and Nigel Hayes made an appearance at our school field day and Kaminsky had to crouch a bit to walk around our building.  We had a karaoke setup in the schools band room (my dad was the karaoke host, it's his job), I have a video of me and my dad singing Build me up buttercup with them"
"HILARIOUS how bucks fans are now pro-referee after they‚Äôve gotten the majority of the calls for the past two games. Middleton takes 25+ shots without a ft attempt &amp; it‚Äôs *mass crying* booker does the same thing the very next game &amp; *crickets* ‚Ä¶  Ayton was in foul trouble early last night &amp; you guys don‚Äôt think that impacted the game? He got benched and we had to play Frank fucking Kaminsky. The Bucks IMMEDIATELY went on a run when Ayton was pulled. How do you ignore that?  Suns fans aren‚Äôt even complaining but you guys really are delusional. And by the way, half the time when Giannis was ‚Äúfouled‚Äù he has barely even been touched. Sometimes he is fouled hard but other times it‚Äôs like a feather lands on him and a whistle blows. I like the guy and I know he takes a lot of contact but holy cow man I just want to watch a single play where a foul isn‚Äôt called.  Just like the last time the suns were in the postseason when donaughy bet against the suns while reffing our game, it‚Äôs suns vs the league. Enjoy your preferential treatment, bucks fans"
Frank Kaminsky dominates having the same birthday I do.
I WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS WISCONSIN LEGEND FRANK KAMINSKY SLANDER! SIR!!!!!!!!
Frank Kaminsky couldn't do shit against him.
"at the time, that was a very common opinion. Winslow was highly thought of- so much so that both Charlotte and Miami declined pretty sweet offers from Boston to get him. We get shit for it because we drafted Frank Kaminsky. Miami was apparently offered the same package of picks for Winslow and declined it. He wasn't ever supposed to fall down to pick #9 or #10 that year. He just got hurt all the time and never developed much offensively, basically the same as MKG."
Frank Kaminsky: I'm tha joker baby
"He went out Game 2 - but fortunately the injury didn't seem to be severe and he played this game. It's just Saric injured right now. Your point still stands, it's just that it's Frank Kaminsky often having to play which is not ideal."
Frank kaminsky dominated my team in high school basketball tournament
Yea and Frank Kaminsky is having to get minutes now and he isn‚Äôt a threat on either end. The second he gets the ball he is immediately looking to pass.
Tier 0 - Frank tha tank Kaminsky
"Yeah and? Frank Kaminsky is in the finals and LeBron isn‚Äôt, does that mean we are saying he is better?"
&gt;	all you do is shit talk the opponent  https://i.imgur.com/8GnCTby.jpg  &gt;	while getting lucky with injuries  They just played Frank Kaminsky in the NBA Finals because of an injury  &gt;	and never actually winning anything yet  You‚Äôre a fucking Clippers fan. Shut the fuck up dude
You're calling the Suns' depth a strength when they had to give Frank Kaminsky significant minutes tonight? Giannis became only the 2nd player to ever post back-to-back 40+/10+ games in the Finals because the Suns have no one who can guard him. He's literally turned into Shaq in this series and you're citing career PPG averages hoping he regresses?
"I agree, to a point. Scott Foster didn't make Devin Booker build a Ben Simmons-style orphanage this game.  The one thing determined by the refs that changed the game was Ayton's fouls. Now, DA definitely played his way into a few foolish fouls. But there were a few rather questionable calls against the Suns that even the broadcast thought was weird. Once he was taken out and Kaminsky was put in his place, that was game. Frank tanked."
"True, Chris Paul and Frank Kaminsky have carried this team all playoffs"
This is how the game is fixed. Quick fouls no one pays attention to that change coaching decisions. Easy for Giannis to play well when he‚Äôs going at frank Kaminsky and Torrey Craig.... Wish we got to see him have to play Embiid and the Sixers defense.
"I understand that a bit (4 fouls). But the small ball lineup in the 3rd was working offensively... And then Monty put in Frank Kaminsky.üòê  You do not do that while you're still down, and if you do, you don't leave him out there with your Ice Cold guard instead of the one playing well. But mostly, you just don't do that. He provided ZERO offensive value in a game our offense was struggling, and he was just a warm body on defense."
I think we can all agree Jeff Teague end Frank kaminsky should not be on an nba roster
Is Frank Kaminsky the worst player in the NBA?
frank kaminsky is white privilege
Suns really got to the Finals with Frank Kaminsky as their backup center?
Frank Kaminsky about to be banned from Phoenix.
"I feel like MJ deciding to draft Frank Kaminsky over Devin Booker is glaring enough that it justifies calling LeBron the GOAT instead, unless and until LBJ ever makes an equally stupid front office decision."
Suns could use a casual 4th quarter comeback spearheaded by offensive juggernaut Frank Kaminsky
"Putting Kaminsky on the floor is NOT a Suns small lineup. He pulled people in the 3rd quarter to PUT Frank on the floor while the Suns were on a run, not the other way around."
"Now, I‚Äôm not too sure about how there is in common with Bucks fans and Badgers fans, but‚Ä¶  Frank Kaminsky, Naismith Award winner and legend of Wisconsin basketball, makes his truth to the Dairy State‚Ä¶but not to play *for* the local team, but to play *against* them instead.  It‚Äôs a minor storyline here, but damn‚Ä¶isn‚Äôt that bittersweet, yet also interesting?"
lol Frank Kaminsky is -13 in less than 5 minutes.
"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because Frank Kaminsky gave me cancer anyway."
Monty Williams be like ‚Äúyou show me Jeff Teague? i raise you Frank Kaminsky‚Äù
frank kaminsky vs jeff teague  who will hurt their team more?
Their second big is fucking frank Kaminsky. 100% facts
"This is the frank kaminsky game tho, in that the suns learned a lesson to never play him again for this series."
Frank Kaminsky is genuinely bad lmfao.
"A friend in my group hates Frank, so we all chipped in and surprised him with a Kaminsky jersey.   I just sent him a message letting him know his boy is shitting the bed defensively today."
"If anyone told me even last year that Frank Kaminsky would be getting meaningful buckets in the finals I would have said ""yeah, and Conor McGregor will snap a leg and lose to Dustin Poirier for a 2nd time"""
I don't know about you guys but I for one would LOVE more Frank Kaminsky minutes.
These Frank Kaminsky minutes are fuckin god awful lmao
Frank Kaminsky lineup is not working

Giannis &gt; Frank Kaminsky By FAR
Imagine telling Hornets fans that Frank Kaminsky would be an NBA Champion.
~~frank kaminsky~~
Frank Kaminsky wanted to be traded or bought out of his rookie contract
"Recent History shows the 9th pick as a real mixed bag, for what's its worth, all these players are still playing today (Vonleh might not last past this season). Only 3 of them were basically back ups from the start.  2010: Gordon Hayward (Utah, signed an extension) 15.6/4.5/3.5, made an all star game; 685 games played  2011: Kemba Walker (Charlotte, signed an extension) 19.9/3.8/5.4, multiple all star games, an all nba team; 704 games played  2012: Andre Drummond (Pistons, signed an extension) 14.5/13.7/1.4, all star, all nba, rebounding leader; 645 games played  2013: Trey Burke - starter, then quickly role player  2014: Noah Vonleh - role player, now third stringer  2015: Frank Kaminsky - role player  2016: Jakob Poetl - role player, current starter (usually)  2017: Dennis Smith Jr - starter, now role player  2018: Kevin Knox - role player  2019: Rui Hachimura - starter  2020: Deni Advija - role player"
We‚Äôre about to live in a world where Frank Kaminsky has an NBA ring
"Well if you win by 1, it would mean frank kaminsky made the game winning play."
"Cam Payne, Frank Kaminsky, and Abdel Nader"
Is plus-minus really even a useful stat to use in a playoff series? Look at Frank Kaminsky with a +1 and tell me with a straight face you see nothing wrong with it.
He also played 4 years at Michigan State. Not a lot of 4 years starters get drafted in the first round nowadays. On occasion you'd get a Damien Lillard or Frank Kaminsky but it's not that often
the loss is magnified when the other guys who will get those minutes are Frank the Tank &amp; Abdel Nader.  Both Saric &amp; Craig are versatile players and certainly better thank Kaminsky/Nader or Jalen Smith who is totally untested at this point.
Maybe beat Detroit if Darko has to guard Frank Kaminsky
Frank Kaminsky starting I would imagine.
frank kaminsky mvp
"Well, we're down to him or Frank Kaminsky for those minutes"
Frank Kaminsky III
Frank Kaminsky the 3rd.
"Monty Williams is a pussy if he doesn't make Frank Kaminsky the backup 5 if Craig can't play going forward.  Don't be a pussy, Monty. You know you want to see that heavy-eyelidded dork try to stop Giannis in the paint."
"With Saric and Craig out with torn ACLs, welcome to the Frank Kaminsky era"
"Wisconsin/Bucks fans, how does it feel to root against the great Frank Kaminsky?"
jeff teague against frank kaminsky in the nba finals is the hell we deserve
Frank Kaminsky getting minutes in the NBA Finals is just hilarious to me

Frank Kaminsky has busted his ass in this league for years and he‚Äôs finally made it to the Finals and no one is talking about it!
Frank Kaminsky. Charlotte turned down so many first round picks to have their spot to make a selection and Charlotte said no. They wanted Kaminsky that bad.
"&gt;He ranked 79th out of 84 NBA power forwards last season with a defensive real plus-minus of -1.7. The only players behind him were Zach Randolph, Ryan Anderson, Frank Kaminsky, Bobby Portis and T.J. Leaf.  Bobby Portis not only got his revenge but also became a man of the people.  Underdog alright!"
Or Frank Kaminsky is just goated
4 of me and Frank Kaminsky at center
"Brandon Roy is someone I mention because he went 6th, ahead of All-Star LaMarcus Aldridge, ahead of multiple high upside busts. But Roy was viewed, at the time anyway, as a can't miss starting quality player. He exceeded that obviously.  Very similar to what people were saying about Buddy Hield coming out of the draft. Who coincidentally also went 6th.  It's worth mentioning that NCAA player of the year winners have often amounted to very little, or sometimes nothing, in the NBA. Winners have included Tyler Hansbrough, Obi Toppin, Frank Mason, Frank Kaminsky, Jalen Brunson, etc. Lots and lots of guys that had zero business going 1st overall or even all that close to it.    Reddish has great shooting form and I always saw it as more of a decision making problem personally. I think he's going to figure it out and shoot a solid at least 34% eventually. He shoots over 80% from the FT line there's no way his 3 point percentage doesn't improve eventually."
"At worst case scenario, He'll be a Frank Kaminsky/Mike Muscala where he might get some time in the regular season as a 2nd or 3rd string big   Best case scenario, he improves as a shot blocker and keeps the weight off to be Brook Lopez lite or somewhere in the middle between those options  He has a spot in this league one way or another"
"Frank Kaminsky has had a 6-year NBA career getting 15+ minutes every season.  If Garza is Frank Kaminsky as an NBA player, that is a steal for where he got drafted."
"Yeah, I see him paralleling Frank Kaminsky in a couple years."
"Frank Kaminsky also dominated college ball, now he's an end of the bench player for depth. I honestly see Garza stuck in this same situation in a couple years"
Frank Kaminsky?
"Dude was a really polished inside scorer with huge hands and a 6-11 frame who I initially thought had a high floor as an nba player. Watching him try to guard frank kaminsky in the national championship really exposed his biggest flaw though, he could barely move and was pretty useless more than 10 feet from the basket. Turned out there was just no room for players like that in the modern nba."
"Frank Kaminsky would also go to your college and completely destroy them. Grant Williams had 300 ways of scoring in the paint in college. Olynyk, Willie Cauley-Stein, Jahlil Okafor, Marvin Bagley‚Ä¶  The college frontcourt just doesn‚Äôt project well into the NBA.   It‚Äôs better for guys like Olynyk who don‚Äôt get drafted with late-playoff starter expectations (the Hornets took 22 year old Kaminsky in the high lottery, which looked pretty similar at the time to how it looks now), because a lot of the players I just named actually can compete as 8th man high-scoring centers, but just aren‚Äôt athletic enough for NBA rim protection. Garza can be something good, but it‚Äôs not because he‚Äôs an excellent college player, all the excellent 22 year old college bigs that find a role in the NBA have to change a lot and rise to the challenge of low-volume efficiency."
"I was at the Bucks game in Charlotte in 2015 and my seats were a few rows behind Milwaukee's bench.  One thing that stood out was that John Henson was heated - I mean ready to fight somebody - for a really long stretch of the game. He was yelling at the coaching staff, but I couldn't tell if it was at Kidd or an assistant.  Other players and members of the staff had to restrain him.  Kidd and his close assistants just ignored him.  It was wild, a huge red flag and a level of dysfunction that I've never seen at any level of sports with the exception of a little leaguer flipping his shit and throwing a tantrum.  Reading this, it makes a bit more sense now.  I had the same seats in 2018 when the Raptors came to town - Casey's last season.  And that was the exact opposite.  I've never seen any team, at any level, run as smooth as the Raptors did.  Assistants working 1-on-1 or 2-on-1 with players, using Ipads to demonstrate coaching points and then walking through the spots and motions on the court.  Vets were helping the young guys.  Starters were supporting the bench unit.  And they kept it up the entire game.  They beat us by 20, and at one point they were up by about 40.  While the Raptors were running their clinic before the game the Hornets had one guy putting in work on the court - Aaron Harrison, who was shooting with a couple of coaches.  Maybe the Hornets did their prep-work before I showed up, but it didn't seem like it.  We came out and walked around, lazily put up shots and Frank Kaminsky hammed it up the whole time like a middle schooler."
"MJs real obsession is just with college guys who were NCAA tournament stars or who had lots of hype in college.   Since he took over with final basektball say in 2006   2006: Adam Morrison---NCAA star tons of hype   2008: DJ Augustin--1st team all American, SI cover boy  2009: Gerald Henderson--Dukie well known commodity especially amongst people in North Carolina   2011: Kemba Walker: Tourney hero rare pick that worked out like this   2013: Cody Zeller: All American, on a no 1 seed Indiana team  2015: Frank Kaminsky: Big name on a Wisconsin team that made the Finals  2017: Malik Monk: SEC player of the year, shooting/scorer on an elite 8 Kentucky team.  The scouting drafting process is akin to what I wouldve done in high school ""Who was the flashiest biggest name most recently on a stage like the NCAA tournament that's left? That's who I want""."
"I'll be real, if you guys sign him to a long-term deal you should be concerned. I've honestly never seen a player that r/nba is so ready to make excuses for than Lauri. Get ready to hear all about how he wasn't coached right, how he was scared to get injured, how he needs a specific line-up around him to not be a net-negative on the court. I don't know if it's a Euro thing, if I'm forgetting some nationally televised game where Lauri played well, or what exactly it is that has earned him this unwavering benefit of the doubt, but in the end I do not buy him as a starting caliber player in the NBA. He's a stretch-big off the bench who can't guard any position at even an average level. I see Bertans thrown around a lot, but to me he's more of a Frank Kaminsky. Is he worth a 'prove it' deal? Totally, he's got the talent and was a lottery pick. But as I said, anything long-term is a bad move and I'd bank on the Pels regretting it in less than half a season."
If he drops 100 we‚Äôll take him. He can share the floor with Frank Kaminsky.
"yes, his effort was always a bit of a problem but his final year here was just obscene.  For a while, he was attempting the fewest shots per possession or per minute of anybody getting anywhere close to rotation minutes in the entire NBA. He was just going through the motions, playing not to get injured, etc. He was talented enough to drop some 7 rebound, 7 assist games like he always has, but he straight up didn't care to score the ball.  Let me put it this way- Dell Curry never shits on any former Hornets/Bobcats on Charlotte broadcasts if he can help it. The only players I've ever heard him say negative stuff about after their exits are Batum and Frank Kaminsky."
It's not that uncommon for 4-year college stars. Denzel Valentine and Frank Kaminsky won player of the year in college.
"Why does Lauri have so many defenders who don't watch him? I feel like you all are just looking at his per game stats and that's it, watch a few games and tell me that guy is worth more out on the court than Frank Kaminsky. If he was as good as you all think, he'd be signed already."
"I hung out/ate dinner with Frank Kaminsky in a big group once, a friend of a friend had a house on Lake Minnetonka so we went there for a weekend and Frank was a friend of one of the families.  He was a pretty quiet guy but cool and down to earth, we asked him MJ stories and stuff. Other than that don't remember too much of the actual conversation  So yeah not very interesting but it's what I have"
Frank Kaminsky 1 year minimum with Phoenix
Frank Kaminsky looks like it's his very first day with the team every time he steps on the court. Completely lost and at least 2 steps behind on his rotations.
Frank Kaminsky.
Frank the Tank Kaminsky
"What if the Suns trade Frank Kaminsky and in the offseason he shrinks 9 inches, develops a 3 point shot and changes his name to Stephen Curry? Do the Suns fire Robert Sarver?"
Kaminsky is the only Frank the Tank.
"Haha, honestly I think we know way too much about all these negotiations. It can be interesting and noteworthy in some extreme cases (like Danny Ainge offering four picks to get Justise Winslow and the Hornets turning it down to draft Frank Kaminsky). But we really don't need to know all the little ins and outs of versions of trades tossed around before one was actually made. But hey, it's content, I guess."
Just waiting for Frank Kaminsky to join the team to pick up the scraps

Kevin Knox is one of the most Neil Olshey signings ever  Frank Kaminsky is the only player I can think of that would be more of a Neil Olshey signing
I‚Äôm surprised Mike Muscala is still in the league but not Mike Beasley. I know he shoots 37% from 3 for a big but he seems like a worse version of frank kaminsky or gorgi dieng.
"You're getting downvoted but I don't think you're wrong, Lauri is soft. The upvoted opinions on Lauri are always not actually how he's playing or what he's done on the floor, that's always replaced by some theoretical version of Lauri that actually uses his size and athleticism. I know you're all thinking that if someone smaller is on him he'll shoot over them or take them inside, and if it's someone his size he'll drive right past them, but Lauri will just shoot a contested three every damn time, or stand in the corner, or set a soft af screen that always turns into a good trap. That's his game, and aside from the occasional high-light reel put back or transition dunk, he'll never get near the rim. Don't even get me started on this guy's defense, I'd pick on him every play down the floor if I was the other team. I wish him well, but he's a stretch 4/5 off the bench on any playoff team IMO, guy's more likely to be Frank Kaminsky in 3 years than the Dirk-type player people act like he is or could be. I've heard all sorts of excuses for Lauri, at this point I just hope we can get something for him."
bro you guys have frank the tank Kaminsky /s
"What a joke, he didn't crumble, he was just overwhelmed by the sheer size advantage the bucks had on our team. If the requirements for deserving a max contract is being able to shut down Giannis, then nobody is worthy of a max contract. On top of that, he was literally the only guy we had above 7 ft that we could put in the game outside of Frank Kaminsky, who wasn't even in the rotation for the majority of the season."
that's NBA Finals contributor Frank Kaminsky to you
can't pass up dancin' frank kaminsky
"I did my best to hang ‚ÄúFrank the Clank‚Äù on Kaminsky, but it never caught on."
Ya that money is going to end up being used to get players like Caruso and frank kaminsky just because the mavs in free agency‚Ä¶.
And Charlotte turning down those four picks...so they could draft Frank Kaminsky.
Frank Kaminsky is another good example.
Frank Kaminsky approves.
"Shoot, Frank Kaminsky too   (/s to all my fellow Buzz City Bonkers)"
"Bro, Frank Kaminsky when he was rotting on the Hornets dropped his season high of that season on Drummond. The guy is straight up embarrassing and has no pride"
Hornets fan.   Nick Batum and Frank Kaminsky were errors seen a mile away
"McBuckets was a big star in college at least, being a 3x 1st team All-American and consensus Player of the Year as a senior. It's not any weirder to run into a McDermott fan than it would be to run into say, a fan of Jimmer Fredette, Jay Williams, Trey Burke, Jalen Brunson, Frank Kaminsky or Nick Collison - all great college players with underwhelming NBA careers.   Drummond, OTOH, fouled out of his only NCAA tournament game with 2 whole points in 26 minutes."
Frank Kaminsky and Sam Dekker. üò¨
"Well Frank Kaminsky just played real minutes in an NBA final, so I would say significantly better than Expected"
"You have to actually perform some analysis. It can't be just down to ""wins"" because Frank Kaminsky won just as many games as Devin Booker this year, because wins are a team result. It's not the Phoenix Bookers.  I never said Booker was an empty stats player, I don't believe any stats are truly empty, so don't pin some old grievances on me. His stats just have never been as good as he's supposed to be. Everyone shuts their eyes when he has god awful offensive games and then laser focuses when he has a good game, ignoring that when he is bad at shooting the ball he provides essentially nothing else to his team the way all other 'superstars' do. Yes, KAT and Zion are better players. I don't care about wins out of context - there are half a dozen shootings guards who would have made the finals with the suns (Mitchell, Beal, Harden, Lavine, SGA). I say those two are better because they contribute more to their team, and if you look beyond flashy turnaround midrange shots, it's very clear when you watch games. Advanced stats have always backed this up; if you think Booker's stats when the suns were bad were real (which they were), you should believe KAT is better, as KAT's stats (analytic &amp; box) are far greater than Booker's."
Should have invited frank kaminsky
It‚Äôs kinda weird how bad he often is in advanced metrics. I get some of them but Sometimes I just think they are way off for him for some reason. Maybe I‚Äôm a just a biased homer but for the regular season many advanced stats had him closer to frank kaminsky offensively than mikal bridges (mikal being better). I find that hard to believe
MJ effect. Frank the Tank Kaminsky lol
Having to get benched for Frank kaminsky was deeply unexpected
"He 100000% mailed it in his last year with us. He took the fewest shots per minute, and per possession, of anybody in the NBA that got minutes. His lack of effort was absolutely disgusting. Even Dell Curry dislikes him and he doesn't speak ill of any former players except him and Frank Kaminsky lol"
John Collins and Frank Kaminsky look identical
"Being a first round pick doesn‚Äôt mean shit to most people a year later anyway. Frank Kaminsky went in the top ten, I only know that guy because of that Badgers team"
"‚ÄúThe Bucks should‚Äôve won this series much quicker than 6. The Suns had to play Frank Kaminsky for gods sake. Coach Bud is allergic to adjusting his game plan,  and he gets overshadowed by better coaches. He won a ring for the Bucks but he‚Äôs not even a top 5 coach in the game right now.‚Äù      This is no explanation nephew, this is you confirming you don‚Äôt know shit about dick.      I tried to give you an opportunity to show that you do know your basketball, but you couldn‚Äôt find a fact if it smacked you in the face."
"Did you not watch this postseason or something  Ayton was amazing outside of this finals series and even then, they have no other bigs to go to on their bench besides *Frank Kaminsky*, and he‚Äôs having to guard Giannis straight-up.  Recency bias would make you believe Ayton can‚Äôt be a star but even then you just have to go back to Game 1 where the guy practically got a 20/20 in his first finals game ever.  The Suns were able to shoot lights out from 3 game 2 because of how much the Bucks D had to respect Ayton in the post. Game 3 they made the adjustment to put Giannis, a fucking perennial DPOY, on Ayton and they never looked back.  Cmon man this is weak"
"Monty Williams did a fantastic job. There‚Äôs a point where you can‚Äôt overcome your roster deficiencies. When your choice of who to guard Giannis in a close out game in the Finals is between Jae Crowder and Frank Kaminsky, well, you‚Äôre kinda fucked. Giannis was eating their lunch, over and over, all game long. Ayton, too  After six games, there really are no more adjustments to be made. Your players have to execute. Giannis and the Bucks did. The Suns did not"
"You said that coach Monty was an idiot for using kaminsky to guard Giannis. I said they didn‚Äôt. You insisted that Giannis was ‚Äúputting him in a blender‚Äù. I outlined every point Giannis scored with frank on the floor to show that you were wrong.  And what was that highlight supposed to show me? Giannis in transition with Ayton getting blown by? Stop back pedaling.   And what personnel do they have to build the wall? They tried it the first three games and it didn‚Äôt work at all, they got lucky that Middleton and jrue were dog shit games 1 and 2. Giannis was still scoring at will.  Game 6 they made a decision to shut down jrue and khris(which they did a fantastic job with), forcing Giannis to beat them. The game plan was fine, they held the bucks to 105, if Booker and ayton just play slightly better then they win that game.  As a former coach you should know that it‚Äôs always a ‚Äúpick your best option‚Äù against these teams, somebody is going to go off. There will be downsides to any decision they make"
"Neither Crowder or Ayton could guard Giannis. Frank Kaminsky was the only guy that even could do anything defensively on him, forced him in different directions and even blocked a shot"
Once again if you‚Äôre ever in some strange situation where you‚Äôre allowed to pick one NBA player to fight by your side with to the death:  Don‚Äôt pick Frank Kaminsky
"Don't worry, I promise if you left him on the court he would have blown it, I can speak from years of experience when I say Frank Kaminsky ain't shit."
"Lol Frank Kaminsky thinking he's hard, what a goob"
Frank Kaminsky clearly reads this subreddit because he knew he would get flamed again for not running in to help CP3 like when he just watched Pat Bev shove him
"Because he's Frank Kaminsky.  Trust me, we know all about the Tank"
"Example of how important it is for the next guy up to be able to fill a similar role. It's like with the Warriors vs the Cavs in 2016. Losing Bogut wasn't bad because they lost Bogut, it was bad because the next guy up was Ezeli who was close to unplayable. I did not enjoy the Frank Kaminsky minutes in this series"
"3:09 left in the third. Giannis makes an easy layup in the half court cause of a miscommunication by crowder. Kaminsky was at the top of the key guarding Portis out of the play  Crowder foul: Giannis was completely ISO‚Äôd on crowder. Again frank was away from the play, got fouled driving to the rim  28.3 left in the third: kaminsky gets the steal on Giannis  Foul on Bridges. Block by Giannis, leads to transition with Frank on the weak side. Crowder and Bridges on Giannis and bridges fouls  6:15 in the 4th. Giannis got the switch on Bridges in the post. Kaminsky is guarding Portis on the weak side corner. Middleton throws it in to the post, Bridges messes up the ball denial and crowder and frank rush in buts it‚Äôs too late. Giannis gets the dunk   But man I‚Äôm not a former NCAA assistant coach, what do I know ü•¥"
"The Bucks should‚Äôve won this series much quicker than 6. The Suns had to play Frank Kaminsky for gods sake. Coach Bud is allergic to adjusting his game plan,  and he gets overshadowed by better coaches. He won a ring for the Bucks but he‚Äôs not even a top 5 coach in the game right now."
"If he kept Frank out there and they still lost(very likely)?this post would be titled, ‚ÄúWhy DIDN‚ÄôT Monty Williams pull Frank Kaminsky‚Äù"
You don‚Äôt bench Ayton for Frank fuckin‚Äô Kaminsky. Got 4 of his points because the Bucks forgot he existed. Wouldn‚Äôt be the case in the final minutes. His defense would remain shit.
Because he knows Frank is actually bad and the longer he had him out there the more likely things would go South.  They lost but I doubt Kaminsky was saving them
Did Frank Kaminsky die?
"&gt; Frank Kaminsky being the Suns ""big response"" to being out-sized in the Finals   Yeah every time a big got bought out we were clamoring to sign them. Depth at the 5 has been a major issue and then losing Dario didn‚Äôt help.  I will wonder what if we had gotten Boogie, Blake, etc for the next twenty years.   &gt; feel like we don't realize how much this was the Suns 1 opportunity to win a title.  Oh we do, trust me."
Yes. Barely nudges out the Frank Kaminsky game
No words. Absolutely speechless that giannis played so well against top tier players like ayton and frank kaminsky. Truly the GOAT!
1. Bobby Portis   2. Frank Kaminsky  3. Akumpo  4. Jrue  5. Middleton
Someone get Frank Kaminsky some help smh.
Phoenix really just wasted a classic Frank Kaminsky game ... smh
Frank Kaminsky robbed
"&gt; Frank Kaminsky being the Suns ""big response"" to being out-sized in the Finals reminds me of Meyers Leonard being the Heat's ""response"" to AD in the Finals. &gt;   haha big white guy comparison good one"
Ayton got outplayed by Frank Kaminsky
and let frank Kaminsky launch the pivotal 3s?
"&gt; Frank Kaminsky being the Suns ""big response"" to being out-sized in the Finals reminds me of Meyers Leonard being the Heat's ""response"" to AD in the Finals.   They had no other option with Saric injured and Ayton in foul trouble."
Fantastic game by Frank Kaminsky
"This is going to be the **Giannis coronation,** and rightfully so. What a Finals man. He deserves all the praise in the universe for shooting 17/19 from the FT line in a pivotal Game #6 after all the struggles, in the biggest game of his life. Forget the Brooklyn got hurt asterisk nonsense, this is his iconic moment - and nothing can take away from that.  A couple other observations:  * Frank Kaminsky being the Suns ""big response"" to being out-sized in the Finals reminds me of Meyers Leonard being the Heat's ""response"" to AD in the Finals.  * CP3 missing that technical FT (94% FT shooter reg season) after Portis high-stepping is pure justice  * I feel like we don't realize how much this was the Suns 1 opportunity to win a title. I dunno if CP3 will be back, but the West in general is so vicious, I wouldn't expect them to even make the WCF next year. Just a hunch so don't crucify me.   Excellent Finals. Good season all things considered with the caveats. Let's hope for a fun offseason!"
"Frank Kaminsky is not the name of an NBA player, it's the name of a construction worker from Hoboken, NJ"
"Frank kaminsky, crunch time minutes"
Yo can frank kaminsky get some of what booby portis is getting
The Bucks are making a mistake attacking Ayton. That forces Frank ‚ÄúFMVP‚Äù Kaminsky into the game
the way the commentators are talking you would think frank kaminsky is the best player on the court
it‚Äôs frank ‚Äúthe tank‚Äù kaminsky vs bobby ‚Äúcrazy eyes‚Äù portis in a prime time punch for punch cage match i fucking LOVE IT
Frank ‚ÄúThe Clank‚Äù Kaminsky
Frank Kaminsky and Bobby Portis dueling in a decisive finals game. What a timeline
I didn't realize Frank Kaminsky was the GOAT
If in 2016 you told someone that Cameron Payne and Frank Kaminsky would be getting minutes in a finals series for Phoenix they‚Äôd shoot you in the face
The Bucks are really letting frank kaminsky have an FMVP game...
Frank kaminsky remembering he runs shit in Wisconsin
Frank Kaminsky holy shit
"Phoenix is more of a mid-tier market I guess but I‚Äôve seen Frank Kaminsky at target, my wife had seen Aron Baynes at Whole Foods multiple times, I know folks in r/Suns had seen cam payne around quite a bit too"
You are telling me Frank Kaminsky is not the best player in NBA?
"To his credit, Frank Kaminsky didn't cry or flop either. But yeah I have no idea how other fans weren't disgusted watching the Sun's behavior it was so annoying to watch"
It's funny Frank Kaminsky lasted longer than him it's looking like. Both busted from that championship showdown
Frank Kaminsky
"Frank Kaminsky. Actually, I really liked that whole Wisconsin team -- Bronson Koenig, Nigel Hayes, Sam Dekker -- and how they played. A shame that none of them ever panned out."
Frank the Tank Kaminsky is my pick
"Personally, I think he could get it done if you swap Rodney Hood for last season‚Äôs Reggie Bullock and Frank Kaminsky for Zubac"
"The 2018 Cavs wouldn't have beaten the Suns, or the 2018/2019 Rockets or any title worthy team. They went 7 against 2 meh teams   And no, Bron is good, but he's not beating ANY elite West team in the finals with Rodney Hood as his second best player and Frank Kaminsky as his rim protector.  &amp;#x200B;  But congrats you may have found the answer to another question : how bad of a supporting cast would you have to create for Prime Lebron to not win a playoff round ?"
Frank Kaminsky and Pat Bev
Frank Kaminsky
"KAT has been soft since college. I went to UK watch every game the fact he couldn't produce against sorry ass Frank Kaminsky and Sam ""Who"" Dekker in the final four he showed who he is.  Joel owns KAT, he's so far in his head he tries to fight him every time they play and that right there is why he is a tier below. He's soft mentally, I'm sure other people in the league have had family die but it didn't require tweets and sob stories. It's just another excuse for a dude that fails to step up."
Literally just the Hawks/Knicks first round series:  * Elfrid Payton * Julius Randle * Solomon Hill * Tony Snell * RJ Barrett  Even in the Lakers series how you coming away thinking you'd rather have Frank Kaminsky on your team.
They don't look alike at all but it still might be Frank Kaminsky because they have the 'eyes seem closer together than normal' feature.
Frank Kaminsky over Plumlee IMO
"Here is my quick attempt off the top of my head,  *Sabonis does not count even though he is American born. He represents Lithuania internationally and clearly has embraced that culture, his dad was just playing in the States when he was born.  1st Team  Tyler Herro- Joe Harris- Duncan Robinson- Gordon Hayward- Brook Lopez  2nd Team  Alex Caruso- Kevin Huerter- Pat Connaughton- Kevin Love- Cody Zeller  3rd Team  TJ McConnell- JJ Redick- Doug McDermott- Zach Collins- Mason Plumlee or Frank Kaminsky  The issue is that there are much better guards than forwards and especially centers. I feel like Donte is probably better than JJ at this point, but I gave Redick the legacy choice."
Frank Kaminsky
Who the fuck blames a bench player for the team's mediocrity? Do the Suns blame Frank Kaminsky for not beating the Bucks?
"This ones only all time bad if one of them was actually a Nets pick, but I‚Äôm pretty sure those 4 picks ended being Rozier (16),  Rj hunter (28) , Guerschon Yabusele (16) ,and Ante Zizic (23).       Rozier is the only good player and is already on the Hornets. The real crime is taking Frank Kaminsky #9 over the next 5 or so guys taken.       I‚Äôve yet to see anything that a insinuates a Nets pick was actually on the table."
"I have a candidate for best non-trade.  In the 2016 draft, Danny Ainge offered Charlotte 4 first round picks, including potentially a future Nets pick in order to trade up and select Justice Winslow.  Charlotte declined. Who did they select? The AP National Player of the Year.  #Frank Kaminsky."
Here's the list from 2019-2020. A lot of the same guys show up on both.

"&gt; James Jones likes high BBIQ, high motor guys   The first FA he signed was Jamal Crawford. Crawford was fun to watch, but he was the exact opposite of high BBIQ, and his motor only turned on when he had the ball.   His next big move after that was to trade for Kelly Oubre - another guy not known for his high BBIQ or motor.   Then he sold TJ Warren to Indy. Warren may not be the highest BBIQ player around, but he's smarter than Cash Considerations.   Here's his GM record, it's not exactly filled with the type of guys you're describing.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/executives/jonesja99x.html  It's basically Rubio, who was then traded for CP3, and then re-signing CP3. Maybe Crowder too, although he can't dribble or pass.   Cheick Diallo, Frank Kaminsky, Langston Galloway, Etwaun Moore, Cam Payne, Elfrid Payton - I mean, they're all NBA-caliber guys but I wouldn't say any of them are known for their high BBIQ or motors.   Granted, CP3 is top 2 in the entire league in BBIQ (Lebron), so the other guys don't have to be."
"The suns defense that had ayton, some mid size bigs, and...Frank Kaminsky? I'm not trying to detract from Giannis skill as a player. But it's worth noting the Suns were laughably equipped to defend the paint. Going by the numbers, Giannis's biggest challenge in the playoffs was Bam in the first round, where Giannis went 4-15 from the floor in the 59 partial possessions Bam was guarding him, with a 45% field goal percentage in the series."
We‚Äôre gonna have the best bench in the league.   CP3/cam Payne/Elfrid Payton   Booker/shamet  Mikal bridges/cam Johnson  Jae crowder / cam Johnson /jalen smith  Ayton / jevale McGee / Frank kaminsky
You can see it game to game.  There were stretches last year he took games off and was invisible.  He'll be essentially was benched for frank Kaminsky and Dario saric due to effort.
"There's no way they beat the Clippers without Ayton. You think Frank Kaminsky is going up over Zubac for an alley-oop game winner (game 2)? You think Torrey Craig is going to get the Suns 9 extra possessions in a game they won by 4 (game 4)?  Heck, they might not have even beat the Lakers."
Frank Kaminsky &gt; Luka confirmed
Say hello to your new Phoenix Suns starting center Frank Kaminsky! üòéüåû
"Not so hot take, that pass was so spot on any center could have completed that play. The ball was literally over the basket. That's not the highlight you show of you're Ayton. He needs to be showing defensive highlights of Kaminsky and Saric getting cooked, and then Ayton not getting cooked. Here's an issue for Ayton (that is 100% not his fault), in those highlights he's comparing himself to forwards because the  Suns decided not to have a **true** backup center last season. The Suns got one this season.   Note: I guess Kaminsky, but Kaminsky started a ton of games at Forward for the Suns last season. And Dario played more overall. 871 min for Dario compared to 715 for Frank"
"And 0 help. Our front court outside of ayton was very small or weak, and then saric tore his acl. Frank Kaminsky isn‚Äôt checking Giannis."
"casual take, someone didn‚Äôt watch the playoffs‚Ä¶bro really thinks that ayton being replaced by frank kaminsky is a better option than mikal or crowder being replaced lmao"
"Bro stop there is a huge difference between high school sharp shooters and E‚ÄôTwan Moore, Jevon Carter and Frank Kaminsky.   To say:  &gt; there‚Äôs kids in every high school that can shoot like that  Is such poor perspective considering two of those players are NBA guards and the third is Frank Kaminsky is a stretch big who was college player of the year. Jevon Carter was ranked top 5 in his position in high school and even he wasn‚Äôt shooting like that considering the fact that he has improved since and he wasn‚Äôt practicing at NBA range. There‚Äôs no highschool in Utah that has multiple players that can hit ‚Äúevery 3 point shot without missing‚Äù at NBA range at the rate remotely close to what these guys do."
NBA Finals participant Frank Kaminsky would like a word
"Smith and Kaminsky won't likely see the floor right away as back ups.  My guess is Nader will come in as the backup SF and Johnson will be at PF. When they want to go big, that's when Smith or Frank will get spot minutes at the 4 spot."
He'll probably be ahead of Frank Kaminsky and split time with Dario as Ayton's backup. There will also be some rotations with him and dario together since Dario can play C or PF. Hopefully Jalen Smith will get omse minutes in there too.
Denzel Valentine and Frank Kaminsky won player of the year in college
this is blatant frank kaminsky and cam payne erasure and I will not stand for it
"They tried a lot. Ayton is one of the better defenders in the league and Giannis got him in foul trouble early. They tried Jae Crowder, who is a good defender and sometimes matches with Giannis. It wasn't working, so they tried swarming him and had Frank Kaminsky out too. There wasn't much Phoenix can do. Elite offense triumphs."
Probably never lose another game again after Frank Kaminsky comes back
Nvm I forgot about Frank Kaminsky and Aron Baynes
No Frank Kaminsky was inactive
"Yall lucky Frank ""The Actual God"" Kaminsky III is out."
And we dont have Frank Kaminsky. Check and mate.
We don't Frank Kaminsky and Saric and they are better than Lee and Iggy.
Only way they repeat is if Frank Kaminsky isn‚Äôt healthy
The disrespect to University of Wisconsin-Madison legend Frank Kaminsky
If Frank Kaminsky didn't get injured he'd be on everyone's ass right now. Otherwise looks right to me.
Christian Wood might work as a replacement for Frank Kaminsky as a 3rd backup center.
‚ÄúThink twice before you leave me off the Top 75 list‚Äù  - Frank Kaminsky
"Yeah, but that's because Frank Kaminsky is taking the spot"
"high scoring games are better for me, because I love seeing young dudes go off, or dudes like Frank Kaminsky or Jeff Green put up a 30 piece randomly."

Frank Kaminsky can be your rim protector with those guys guarding the parameter
"Charlotte has been ""missing"" for a number of drafts but haven't exactly been ""swinging"". This analogy of swinging for the fences applies to instances wherein the team goes for a prospect with a higher potential ceiling (home run) over the ""proven"" product (single). A lot of times Charlotte has gone to the prospect who was productive, or came from an established program, or had his ""one shining moment"", or ""ready to play"" (or from North Carolina).  Swinging is going for small-school Dame over the ""winner"" MKG, or Giannis over Cody Zeller. Even if Dame or Giannis didn't pan out, it's better to have taken a chance at someone with the potential to be quite special instead of ""NBA-ready"" prospects with low ass ceilings. Given Charlotte's roster in all that time, they seemed to be drafting for a veteran team that was a solid bench contributor away from Finals contention when they should've rather crashed and burned with a Trey Lyles pick than go with a Frank Kaminsky.  I know that Miles was picked earlier but, now that they have LaMelo, this is actually the time go for the Bridges types over MPJ as you now have someone to build around. No one is saying that results don't matter - just that the ideal approach *at that time* called for more risk tolerance."
Frank Kaminsky.
"That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, he‚Äôs not up there quite yet but it‚Äôs not like the guys ahead of him are frank kaminsky or Cody seller"
"Counting stats can hardly enter the conversation to justify a CP3 all-nba team, and I'm really reluctant to lean heavily on things like WS/48 or BPM for a player on a team that is on such a win-streak because then we're looking at a take that says the difference between an all-nba player in Chris Paul (.232 WS/48) and Frank Kaminsky (.241 WS/48) is 9 assists a game (Kaminsky 10ppg on 63.5 TS% and CP3 14ppg on 58 TS%). Advanced stats, this early on don't have a steady connection to a players ability and CP3 has not got the counting stats to compete with players like Dejounte Murray even if we heavily weight them toward assists.  Basically, yes, I get it, you have to find the compromise somewhere but CP3 on the list reeks of advanced stats counting for *some* players, team record counting for *some* players, boxscores counting for *some* players."
"‚ÄúThe Celtics made a strong final push to multiple teams in spots 4-9 on draft day. It culminated with an all-in effort in attempt to get Charlotte to deliver the No. 9 pick with Boston lusting for Duke forward Justise Winslow (the same player they coveted while trying to shuffle higher).  According to sources, the Celtics' final offer to the Hornets was a package that could have featured as many as six draft picks, including four potential first-round selections (a combination of picks from this draft and in the future). But the Hornets could not be swayed and turned down multiple offers to select Wisconsin center Frank Kaminsky.‚Äú  From an SB Nation article"
"Yes, that Frank Kaminsky, was literally a better player than Chriss, Bender, Rookie DJJ, Ulis, retired Barbosa, and Dudley. He‚Äôs now better than everyone who played for the Suns that game outside of Booker"
"The Frank Kaminsky that was a bench player ~in Charlotte~ the next year?  Ulis getting cut by the Suns, who according to you were college team, but playing 37 min/game in Kentucky and earning All-American doesn‚Äôt help your case."
"Tyler Ulis is a 5‚Äô8 guard who couldn‚Äôt shoot and never got picked up after being cut by the Suns. Dragan Bender, 5 years later, isn‚Äôt a top 3 player on his Israeli team. Marquesse Chriss would be a g-league candidate if he wasn‚Äôt already 23 years old.   I understand that, but what you‚Äôre completely missing is that the Phoenix Suns that year did not have a legitimate 8 NBA players either, shown by the fact that the only non-Booker player still playing in the league is Derrick Jones Jr, who was a 19 year old 2-way at the time. Literally over half of that Suns team was out of the league by the end of the next year. Meanwhile, that Kentucky team has had more players with staying power in the league than anyone other than Booker.   FRANK KAMINSKY WOULD UNIRONICALLY BE BY FAR THE 2ND BEST PLAYER ON THAT SUNS TEAM"
"Yes, totally agree they were terrible by ‚ÄúNBA standards.‚Äù Sure, KAT was good enough to be an impact player in the NBA at 18. What you‚Äôre not getting is that 8 NBA players, yes even the ones that played for the Suns that night, would wipe the floor with KAT‚Äôs Kentucky team.  If it‚Äôs helpful, try to remember Frank Kaminsky sending the Wildcats home that March and then tune in and watch him flounder in the NBA. Maybe then it will click for you."
I want Frank Kaminsky to never win a ring. Ideally he‚Äôll be the 8th man in rotation for the rest of his life. Solely because I‚Äôm still mad about Wisconsin beating Arizona in the elite 8 in 2014 lead by Frank Kaminsky‚Äôs 28 point-11 rebound double-double.

Frank Kaminsky
"I'm a UK grad and huge fan. This was evident in college, that team with him and Booker that was undefeated lost to Frank fucking Kaminsky in the final four. He was small in that game and he's never been a killer."
"Not to the same extent. There are still a lot of majority white teams in D1, especially at smaller schools. And I have no data to back this up, but I feel like there are more prominent white players in college than the NBA.   Like generally some of the top college players in the country will be white juniors and seniors who end up getting drafted but not making as much of a splash in the NBA. Think Frank Kaminsky, Doug McDermott, Tyler Hansbrough, Luka Garza.   Almost all the white All-Stars in the NBA are European. Whereas you have plenty of white American superstars in other sports. Tom Brady, Mike Trout, etc"
"Frank Kaminsky  Last Season: 6.6/4.0/1.7/0.3/0.4,  54.7 TS%  This Season: 12.3/4.6/1.6/1.0/.9,  67.5 TS%  &amp;#x200B;  League fucked."
"If guys like Mike Muscala and Frank Kaminsky can cave out solid careers as bench contributors in the NBA, why can't Garza?"

"A pro-jokic point? What does that even mean lol. I get you hate Jokic. It's all you talk about judging by your comment history. And that's fine. But to me I don't really give a shit who it was that retaliated. It could have been Frank Kaminsky in that situation and I would still say Morris is reaping what he sowed, and clearly isn't as injured as it was made out to be."
Refs were letting both sides get away with a bit. On balance it was pretty even.   Frank Kaminsky couldn't buy a trip to the line despite drawing heavy contact quite a bit.
Frank Kaminsky for All-NBA
It‚Äôs official. I‚Äôm taking frank kaminsky over Michael Jordan
Frank Kaminsky / Danny Green / CJ McCollum
I love Jonas but you can see his limitations watching the recent Suns game. You see all the wide open jumpers Chris Paul and Frank Kaminsky we‚Äôre getting‚Ä¶He does a lot of drop coverage to hide his lack of speed and that just limits what kind of defense you can play.
Hard to get time when you‚Äôre behind a literal Basketball God in Frank Kaminsky

"Frank Kaminsky, best Sun?? Lol"
"The Suns don't have the talent to do it. What, is Frank Kaminsky going to score points?"
"We have just seen so little of him that it‚Äôs hard to say. He was like VERY end of the bench last year, came in after the second stringers had already been playing in blowouts with the 10 day contract guys. Summer league he looked ok, he‚Äôs a good rebounder and has some skills on offense but was really chucking. The fact that he couldn‚Äôt get minutes over frank kaminsky says more about him than anything we‚Äôve seen in game, so all we really know is that he‚Äôs raw and the coaching staff thinks he‚Äôs trash."
I think the hope was that he'd be better than Frank Kaminsky and he wasn't
"Can't wait for Anthony Davis to look Frank Kaminsky right in the eye, smack his lips..and clank a midrange fadeaway jumper just for the vibes"
Who are they gonna bench Ayton for? Frank Kaminsky?

True.  I guess the only way to settle this series fairly is a Jared Dudley - Frank Kaminsky MMA match.

"I don't see how he deserves it over Monty. Monty led the Suns from the 10th seed to a game behind the best record in the league.  He completely revitalized the career of Cam Payne, Dario found a new role as a small ball center in Monty's system, we brought Craig over from Milwaukee and he fit in right away. Obviously the CP3 addition helped but most people expected the Suns to be a 6 seed at best.  If someone told you Cam Payne, Dario Saric, Jevon Carter, Cam Johnson, and Frank Kaminsky would lead the best bench in the NBA before this year you wouldn't believe it, but they've all thrived under Monty's system."
Give the Suns Julius Randle instead of Frank Kaminsky and they go undefeated. Wow hypotheticals are fun!
"I don't see how he deserves it over Monty. I don't wanna hear bubble talk because everyone always says those games are overrated because almost all of our opponents were missing players.   Monty deserves immense credit for leading the Suns from the 10th seed to a game behind the best record in the league.  He completely revitalized the career of Cam Payne, Dario found a new role as a small ball center in Monty's system, we brought Craig over from Milwaukee and he fit in right away. Obviously the CP3 addition helped but most people expected the Suns to be a 6 seed at best.  If someone told you Cam Payne, Dario Saric, Jevon Carter, Cam Johnson, and Frank Kaminsky would lead one of the best benches before this year you wouldn't believe it, but they've all thrived under Monty's system."

Or we accept that Celtics offer of four first rounders instead of taking Frank Kaminsky, aka a tall white guy that MJ loves so much.  Or a well-known one, the Hornets don't *trade Kobe Bean Bryant away*. Of course,big not, he would've ended up in New Orleans once they moved,bso technically he still wouldn't have much Kobe history in Charlotte basketball"

Frank Kaminsky was closest and he was not about to square up on an actual psychopath
I still get flashbacks any time i'm reminded of Frank Kaminsky lol really had a good shot with the Brandon Knight team too but it was just Kemba's year
&gt; you don't want to put your availability at jeopardy  It's Frank Kaminsky... Why are people talking about his availability like he's some dude that plays actual minutes? Nobody's saying one of the starters should've done it.
"Mark Davis knew exactly what was going to happen but Frank Kaminsky, literally inches away from Pat, didn‚Äôt step in to try and stop him at all lol. C‚Äômon Frank! You gotta look out for your brothers."

Hornets get decimated by every above average big in the league but I feel like whenever we play KAT he doesn't seem aggressive as he nearly should be. Prime Boogie dropped 55 on us or some shit and fouled out all our bigs that we only had frank kaminsky left to put on him.

Hey you keep Frank kaminsky out of this!
"Look after this season, just trade Chris Paul for Damian Lillard. We'll even throw in Dario Saric and Frank Kaminsky."
Suns most valuable player is Ayton not CP3. The Suns have a good replacement in case of CP3/Booker injuries in Cam Payne.   A Kawhi injury to the Clippers is like a Ayton injury to the Suns. The Suns have nothing but Frank Kaminsky to back him up. The Clippers are in the position of relying on big games from Terrance Mann.

Comparing PG's with SG/SF Swingman and saying they play the same position because they both are guards is really dumb."
Huge turning point that night.  Our GM wanted Frank Kaminsky or Trey Lyles lol
"That's when a great front office will shine...for instance, getting Torrey Craig for Cash Considerations was an awesome move for the Suns to gain depth. The Suns stacked up on their positions to ensure if anybody goes down,they have quality players at EVERY position:  Point guard CP3 Backups - Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Tyshon Alexander  SG - Devin Booker Backups - Langston Galloway, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader,   SF - Mikal Bridges Backups - Cameron Johnson  PF - Jae Crowder Backups - Torrey Craig, Jalen Smith  C - DeAndre Ayton Backups - Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky  You could literally have the first five out of the game and a lineup of Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig and Dario Saric can win you games if needed...and that's all because the front office put this team together with a salary cap in mind. That's what I'm talking about regarding preparing your team to win if injuries do happen to your starters."

"Monty Williams needs to send in Frank Kaminsky to just punch Beverley in the face, end his series. Fuck that clown"

Ya and Frank Kaminsky could learn how to be elite 3 level scorer. Neither will actually happen tho
"KP didn't want to go to Philly and his agent wasn't going to let it happen.

It‚Äôs been confirmed by multiple people close to Chris Paul. Most athletes don‚Äôt just come out and say anything. But he volunteered at a mass vaccination site with Mikal Bridges and Frank Kaminsky back in February. You have to get vaccinated to do that in AZ. He also received Pfizer.

"Honestly, having watched a ton of warmups at Hornets games, there are those guys who don‚Äôt miss much at all and those who miss a shitload. Kemba would hit just about everything in warmups, but Frank Kaminsky seemed to shoot about the same percentage he‚Äôd shoot in games. It‚Äôs always interesting to see who‚Äôs what type of practice shooter."
