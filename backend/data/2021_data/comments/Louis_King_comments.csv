"Huh I mean from all the ones I know (sans the list below) I’m actually fine with it. I’m actually surprised by some of the people trump is putting on there like Woody guthrie who was a socialist and wrote a song shitting on trump’s dad and RBG who was a democrat.  Who I absolutely hate is on that list is colombus, Reagan, and Goldwater. I think Goldwater is the worst and most nonsensical.  I really like the trebek, tesla, tubman, guthrie, rbg, robinson, kobe, nat king cole, and louis armstrong choices.  I’m confused by alfred hitchcock though because he was british"
"He was hands down the best player in the PAC-12. Even with Isaiah Stewart, Oscar Da Silva, Okongwu, and Remy, it wasn’t really up for debate. Also that sweet 16 Oregon team with him, Bol Bol and Louis King was fucking sick. Got to catch one of their tourney games in person and he controlled everything. Knew he’d have a career in the NBA, he’s an absolute dog."
"thank you for the thoughtful reply.  &gt;Bitcoin uses up more energy every year than the entire country of Argentina. They're massively contributing to energy waste and climate change.  While that fact is true (BTC energy consumption &gt; Argentina energy consumption), whether BTC is a net force for good or bad is more nuanced, especially with regards to energy usage and its impact on the climate. Cryptocurrency mining actually presents a new way to make renewables more price-competitive. This can help us get off fossil fuels. Check out this article from the World Economic Forum for a more detailed explanation of that point: https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/09/mining-for-cryptocurrencies-could-be-the-future-of-energy-storage/  While you may not be a fan of BTC's energy consumption, in the long term the average person will be better off from the invention of this technology because it empowers individuals against large institutions. Based on what you've written so far, it seems like this would be an innovation you would support.  &gt; Snapchat is like the leading service for the exchange of child pornography.  This is a bold claim I've never heard before - do you have any data that backs that up (the claim that Snapchat is **the leading service** for the exchange of child pornography)?   In addition, child pornography isn't an issue specific to Snapchat, it's a problem that all internet services that enable any sort of data storage and sharing face (check out this transcript of a US congress sub-committee hearing on the issue in 1997 - https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-105shrg44512/html/CHRG-105shrg44512.htm).   Should we turn off the Internet and all the value it brings humanity because of this one issue it creates?   &gt; Also there's always arguments that there are major problems in the world that can be fixed with a few hundred million dollars, but every single billionaire chooses to sit on their money instead.  Do you have any examples of major world problems that can be fixed with a few hundred million dollars? I'm genuinely not aware of any - in the context of major world problems, 100s of millions is not that much money. For context the US federal budget for the 2020 fiscal year was set at $4.79 trillion. That means $100M would be .00212% of the budget!  Also I think it's more than a bit disingenuous to say ""every single billionaire chooses to sit on their money instead."" In fact, here's a list of 211 wealthy individuals, most of whom are billionaires, that have pledged to give away a majority (and for many, 99%) of their wealth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Giving_Pledge  Is the Giving Pledge a perfect system? No, I am not claiming that. But it's just untrue to say that every single billionaire chooses to sit on their money.  Bill Gates is deploying billions of dollars of aid to solve what he believes are the biggest problems in the world in the most effective way he can think of (and he's a pretty smart guy). You should read the Gates foundation's report on polio eradication: https://www.gatesfoundation.org/what-we-do/global-development/polio - it's really impressive work that has effected millions of lives for the better.   I've put a lot of effort into this response because I actually think it's a really dangerous game to villify wealth creation of any kind. With all the issues we (I say we as the US - I'm American and assuming you are too, though please correct me if I'm mistaken) still face as a country, there's a reason the average US citizen has a higher quality of life than European Kings did only 3 or 4 centuries ago. Did you know, for example, that Louis XIV (the King of France from 1643 - 1715) had over 500 rooms in his palace but no bathrooms, no heating or air conditioning, and constantly feared death from many diseases that we easily cure with cheap antibiotics?   Capitalism, with all of its flaws - and I agree there are many flaws! - is a *wealth creation engine*. Yes some people will get obscenely rich, but over the long term by aligning monetary incentives with innovation, the common person's quality of life improves.   Churchill famously said this of democracy, which I think aptly applies to capitalism as well: ""Indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.…""  Capitalism has issues. But it's the best system for the most people that we've found yet.  I hope this encourages you to write a reply. I'm genuinely interested in your thoughts. I'm not trying to have an Internet beef, I just believe in systems that help the most people possible, and all evidence points to me that capitalism is the best system for that goal we have discovered so far."

"KING LOUIS, CHIEF KEEF THAT'S THE CHI RIGHT????"
Cards are king but no one here really cares about the blues besides a certain small demographic. St Louis has a huge basketball love and the fans have always shown up. Although after how Kroenke fucked us over there will never be public support for a stadium.

"That Oregon team wasn't even projected to make the NIT (forget the NCAA tournament) but ripped off a 10 game winning streak, won the Pac-12 championship and made the Sweet 16 before finally losing to eventual champ Virginia.   Louis King and Payton Pritchard went the fuck off like every game, I watched every game of that run. Bol didn't do anything tho, he was hurt."
Switch it. He could be king Louis. I wanna walk like you talk like you
Who the fuck is Louis King
"did i ever say that. i personally HATE the branding of buildings with company names. Joe Louis arena is such a good name compared to little caesars arena, it's a building named after a person and legacy of winning instead of some soulless corp.   ...but, let's also be honest, the branding and logo of little caesars is still better than smoothie king. at least Caesar himself was an impressive historical figure and pizza is damn sure a better food/drink than a smoothie. seriously, smoothie king building is the biggest eyesore i've ever seen. even the logo on the building looks like it was done by a 10 year old in photoshop."

"https://www.forbes.com/sites/terencemoore/2020/08/24/the-dallas-mavericks-are-prospering-but-the-atlanta-hawks-still-made-right-decision-taking-trae-young-over-luka-doncic/?sh=424dc4407910  &gt; Here’s the biggest thing: Even though Young also could shoot and pass his way someday to a plaque in Springfield, Mass., the Hawks are better with Young over Doncic for more than just basketball reasons. &gt;  &gt; **It’s about demographics.** &gt;  &gt; **Young is Black.** &gt;  &gt; **Doncic isn’t.** &gt;  &gt; Atlanta is famously African American, with its background as the home of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement, and with its slew of hip-hop stars, and with its distinction as the hub for black entrepreneurs. &gt;  &gt; Not only that, but except for stretches during the 1980s and early 1990s, with Dominique Wilkins (a Black star and a hometown hero), the Hawks rarely have drawn well since moving from St. Louis to Atlanta in 1968. They finished 26th, 30th and 27th in average home attendance out of the NBA’s 30 teams in consecutive pre-coronavirus years through 2018-2019. &gt;  &gt; So, with the average ticket for a Hawks home game heading into last season at $105, I’m guessing Hawks officials figured in 2018 they’d have a better chance in the long run of filling all of those empty seats at State Farm Arena with a rising Black star instead of a nearly established white one. &gt;  &gt; That gamble still makes sense. &gt;  &gt; According to a 2018 Forbes.com story, Atlanta is tied with Washington D.C. as the nation’s No. 1 city in economic prosperity for Blacks."
The Kings got some good ones  Demarcus cousins DeAaron Fox John Salmons Louis King Corey Brewer Caron Butler Seth Curry Ron Artest (it’s a stretch lol)  I’m sure there’s way more.
Louis King to LeBron: You thought your you can be royalty by being a King? You merely adopted the name... I was born with it.  Another version is: You thought the Kings were your ally? You merely adopted the name... I was drafted in it.
"And him and Haliburton are gonna feast on steals from the rushed passes Davion forces opposing players to make. They’re both already good passing lane defenders with their length, anticipation and athleticism.   I’ve noticed a few games so far where you watch the game and it’s like Davion is everywhere on defense and creating all these turnovers with deflections and ball pressure, and it’s like “oh man he’s gotta have like 4 or 5 steals at least”. But you check the box score and he has one, while a couple of his teammates have like 4 to 5. Last night Louis King had 5 and Emanuel Terry had 5. He just brings the defensive intensity of the team up and creates a lot of opportunities for the team on that end."

Louis King sounds like the kinda guy who should be the new star of the Kings. Imagine... the King of Kings.
"The kings have a guy named Louis King, was it ever really in doubt?"
Louis King sounds like the name of a guy who played in the 1950s on the St. louis Royals
"Super random, but Louis King absolutely yammed on my 6’ 8” buddy that also plays professionally now when we were all back in high school. That dude is a freak athlete."
We have a gaping hole at the 3 right now. I’d love for Louis King to give us solid minutes there this season.
Louis King is so good
louis king doing his thing for the kings
Louis King plays for the Kings
"And then at the end of the clip, it's a former Oregon Duck (Louis King) holding back Metu from punching another former Oregon Duck (Eugene Omoruyi). Although they were never teammates."
"Louis King is a guy I totally forgot about after really liking his chances to be a pocket rocket pre-draft, hope he gets a minutes bump this year."
"Us Kings fans are desperate for Neemias to be a solid rim protector and are really high on the dude. He’s a second round pick so we’ll see. I love the dude already  Also, holy shit Louis King. I’m pretty high on him, I’m sure he’ll get some rotational minutes this year, he’s a solid big guard!"
"Still no. We have Metu and Louis King off the bench at PF, and Barnes and Harkless can also slide there. We also have Jones and Queta at C, and maybe even one of Whiteside and Thompson. I'd much rather see our existing youngsters get more minutes, so hopefully more of Metu and Queta."
"Easy there, King Louis"
"De'Aaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Harrison Barnes, Ben Simmons, Richaun Holmes.   Terence Davis, Louis King, Mo Harkless, Chimezie Metu, Tristan Thompson."
"KING of the Kings............""Louis King ! "" of the Sacramento Kings"
"I know nothing about King Louis XVI but based on this, did he get his head chopped off? By a guillotine or what?"
King Louis XVI was beheaded on the guillotine.
If he doesn't get much minutes he probably be a distraction to the team.  His ego too big. Terrance Davis is better and len gives size. We have Tristan Thompson and Holmes at center already.  Louis king not getting mins.  Len might not even play on most nights.
"i meaaan, to be fair... unless team is tanking, which by all accounts theyre not, at best he's 9th guy in the rotation. A bit surprising he's not expected to get minutes over some combination of Alex Len/Terrence Davis/Louis King, but if the 3 guard lineups that have been getting talked up are legitimately going to eat up a lot of minutes, easy to see how he's not in the initial rotation since he's not a viable small ball center."
Louis King not being here is atrocious
"For y'all's sake, I hope so too!  I just remember Queta had amazing measurables coming out of college. Tall, long, athletic, etc. I assume he must be pretty raw since he fell so far, but the potential seems to be there.  What do you think about the other guys at the roster fringe, like Jah'mius Ramsey, Robert Woodard II, and Louis King?"
