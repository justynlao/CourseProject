The disrespect to Reggie perry
glad to see harden is much more aggressive finding his own shot too cause he deferred like crazy the first couple games  like I get deferring to KD &amp; Kyrie but dude was passing up makeable shots for reggie perry
Reggie Perry
First Reggie perry slander will not be tolerated second TLC Isnt bad at all if you watched him last year
"The Brooklyn Nets defense will be good. It takes time to improve defensively. The Brooklyn Nets are also playing Timothé Luwawu-Clown, Landry Shamet and Reggie Perry. I’m not sure they belong in the NBA, but the Brooklyn Nets will pick up better players and shorten the rotation come playoff time. The Brooklyn Nets are fine.   Timothé Luwawu-Clown makes me sick."
Seriously what the fuck was that. Why weren't their minutes staggered with Harden out? Trying to load manage to the max? Cost us the game. Reggie Perry should not see minutes on the court again fwiw.
Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot makes me sick. Reggie Perry makes me sick. Landry Shamet makes me sick. Tyler Johnson makes me sick.
Nash has to work on rotations. You can’t sit KD and Kyrie then expect Tyler Johnson and Reggie Perry to properly carry the load
"I can confidently say Reggie Perry is one of the worst players in the NBA, jeez"
I still don’t get what’s the positive of Reggie Perry
Idk who reggie Perry is but this dude is helping the Wizards
"reggie Perry for 3...    next thing you know, DeAndre Jordan gonna be launching 3s"
"Yep, the team is figuring some stuff out. Basically we've just be getting by on talent and shooting. Not great offensive sets, not great defensive effort (and certainly not good defensive personnel). But three guys who can all ISO and catch and shoot from three (coupled with Joe Harris who is elite at catch and shoot from three) is a basically unstoppable offense.   And yeah, scary hours are coming. The defense is going to get better once the Nets fill the open roster spots and get back Nic Claxton. We are playing Reggie Perry at Center. Only ten minutes a game, but as a rookie second rounder he really shouldn't be on the court for a team that is expecting to win 60 to 70% of their games. Those minutes will be replaced by a better player shortly (TBD who) and the defense and offense will get a bit better."

Reggie Perry putting the league on notice
"we sure are good at putting the ball in the basket  also, shoutout Reggie Perry for his first career double double"
Landry Shamet has been so bad that he is now out of the rotation on a team that is playing Reggie Perry meaningful minutes. Wild how the Clippers got Kennard and 4 unprotected seconds for him.
Landry Shamet has been so bad that he is now out of the rotation on a team that is playing Reggie Perry meaningful minutes. Wild how the Clippers got Kennard and 4 unprotected seconds for him.
"Wouldn’t say I’m high on him, but I think Reggie Perry is a lot better than he’s played"
"The Brooklyn Nets defense will be good. A four game sample size is a small sample size. Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot and Reggie Perry got playing time in those games too. The Brooklyn Nets don’t need to bring in a center, especially not JaVale McGee. DeAndre Jordan is fine.  The Brooklyn Nets will easily win the championship."
&gt; Reggie Perry is actually doing okay.  Did I read that right?
I see so many people on nets subreddit constantly shit on Reggie Perry when he has been improving. He just needs more playing time to get more confidence in himself.
I highly doubt he’s worse than Reggie Perry - it doesn’t really matter anyway. We have Claxon who’s supposedly coming off injury soon. We’re looking to buy someone out. And Anyone who’s watched Nets games knows that bigs haven’t been what’s beating us. It’s mainly been young shooters driving. We looked worse against the Hawks than we did the Bucks.
lol i hate reggie perry so much.
Gets all the blame for L's and no credit for W's. I am not even a Kyrie stan I don't give a shit if we win games on the back of Reggie Perry or Michael Jordan himself but god damn some of you are so DUG IN on Kyrie and it's weird to see people with Nets' flairs rooting for him to fail. Wish the mods just gave player flairs at this point.
"it's not respectable to pass down open shots in favor of throwing it to reggie perry. Stop it. There is a point where passive crosses into stupid, and that is where Harden was tonight. This is not respectable. We didn't trade for him to play like a fat ricky rubio"
"Agreed on all your points. Gritty win by the nets, but so much to improve on. Harden needs to find his place in the offense, the turnovers NEED to be cut down, and Steve Nash has to never play Reggie Perry ever again."
"I’m perplexed as to why james harden isn’t being james harden. He’s playing so passive, even with the second unit. Like cmon man, I’d rather see you drive to the basket than see Reggie Perry fumble another pass.  This Nets team really has to cut down on turnovers as well. This game wouldn’t have been close if they didn’t have so many boneheaded turnovers. Yes, the officiating was horrible, but still not an excuse for such sloppy play."
For sure. Doesn’t take much processing to realize Reggie Perry is doodoo. A better chance at the offense is him attacking.
Sarah is the Reggie Perry of broadcasting
Going from Jarrett Allen to Reggie Perry is just so sad
Reggie Perry is ass
Reggie Perry thinks he’s playing as a defensive lineman lol
"Would rather see the second unit be run through Kyrie instead of Harden. Let him chuck when guys like Reggie Perry, TLC, and Brown are out there"
reggie perry needs to be cut to be honest.
Very much agree. I also cringe whenever Reggie Perry comes on. I don’t think it’s an overreaction to say he’s the worst rotation player in the league.
Reggie “Evans” Perry
Don’t forget about Reggie Perry.   No I’m just kidding you can completely forget about Reggie Perry the dude is just terrible.
"Reggie Perry belongs in the G-league, if that."
Nets still have 3 open roster spots and need a backup Center at the minimum. A Wing Defender also wouldn’t hurt.   It’s obvious they need to bring in someone to rotate w/ Jordan because Reggie Perry the Nets 2nd Round Pick this year just isn’t good enough yet.   Nets have a 2Way G-League Player as their Backup Center right now.   I assume that Marks is waiting for the “Buyout” market but that’s months away. We’re still in the 1st half of the season.
To be fair Reggie Perry has looked below average to adequate in other games. Tonight he was absolutely horrid though
The Brooklyn Nets will easily win the NBA championship. I’m not going to overreact to one regular season game where the Big 3 didn’t show up until the 4th quarter. Imagine thinking Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot and Reggie Perry are going to be part of the playoff rotation. Embarrassing.
Reggie Perry sounds like really bad weed lol
"James Harden is a good defender.   Kyrie Irving, Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot and Landry Shamet are terrible defenders though. Landry Shamet wasn’t part of the rotation today and I hope Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot and Reggie Perry aren’t part of the rotation soon.   Jarrett Allen was a big loss, but the Brooklyn Nets defense will be good. The Brooklyn Nets will easily win the NBA championship."
"Reggie perry, has been pretty bad."
You can’t sit there and tell me that Reggie Perry is better than Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. I just won’t have it.
Yeah the Nets might need a more ready Center than Reggie Perry.
Reggie Perry would not see minutes on any other playoff team
Bs they didn’t call a foul on Reggie Perry there
He's literally just Reggie Perry from the future
He was sonning Reggie Perry

Clippers Legend Reggie perry
Reggie Perry
reggie perry isnt ready
Reggie Perry stinks
"again, Perry the Platypus &gt; Reggie Perry"
Nah Reggie Perry
"Im tired of people saying the Nets have no depth after the trade as if their own team has All Stars down to the 15th man. *Here's the Clippers top 9*  Kawhi/PG/Ibaka/Lou/Beverly/Kennard/Morris/Batum/Zubac   Very impressive top nine. Id say better than the Nets. Now here's the rest of their roster. Amir Coffey/Reggie Jackson/Kabengale/Terrance Man,/Daniel OToru/Patt Patterson/Jay Scrubb Im sorry if im the only one who doesn't think any of those guys are above Average NBA players. That looks like a pretty shite back of rotation.    *Now here's the Nets top 9* KD/Kyrie/Harden/Harris/Green/Deandre/Shamet/Bruce Brown/TLC  And the rest of the roster  Dinwddie/Tyler Johnson/Nic Claxton/Reggie Perry/3 open roster spots The Nets have the bi annual exception and a disabled player exception to use to fill those open spots. As i said imo the Clippers top 9 is better than the Nets top 9 even though its close. But the Clippers ""depth"" doesn't seem better than the Nets at all. And the Nets have money to improve their depth and all their 2nd round picks to trade."
"Reggie Perry needs to go somewhere else, he’s not good enough to be on this team right now. Sorry rook"
There’s a decent chance Reggie Perry is gonna play meaningful playoff minutes for the Nets this year
Why does Nash play 57th pick in the draft Reggie Perry so much?
Reggie Perry is completely unplayable. Nets need a center ASAP
Reggie Perry needs a little work
love me some Reggie Perry
"Reggie ""the Platypus"" Perry"
"I think our post defense is rightly criticized as terrible but I think the bench thing isn't completely accurate and honestly sounds a lot like how people criticized the Lakers bench last year.  Our starting line-up fully healthy (physically and mentally) against the Lakers will probably be Kyrie-Harden-KD-Jeff Green-DJ (assuming no more additions to the team). The bench consists of Bruce Brown, Shamet, Joe Harris, TLC, Reggie Perry. Joe Harris is obviously a very good role player, and players like Brown, TLC, and Shamet are actually solid (Shamet started the year terribly, but since some random Nets fan called him bad on Twitter a week ago he's been shooting like 45% from 3). Reggie Perry looks aight in the 2 games so far, but he's a rookie who knows. Also, Harden and KD are some of the best floor raisers in the league. Surround those 2 with just mediocre players, and they draw so much attention it makes those average players look extremely competent."
"Did you not watch the Nets Knicks game last Wednesday? DJ sonned Mitch (whose way better than Noel and a quality Center) and then Reggie Perry outplayed Noel... In what world is Noel better than DJ. Actual basketball reasons please.  Also if Noel was solid at all he'd be on a solid contract for a contender considering his age and how cheap he is. However, literally no team wanted him. The Mavs went with Willie Cauley Stein whose a massive head case over re-signing Noel."
More depth than TLC and Reggie Perry bruh.   Also peak LeBron.
"When Draymond was in, KD was playing the 4 anyways so he wasn’t really a small ball 5. Also he’ll play small ball 5 in opportune times for a few minutes. Not for super long stretches. In the playoffs rotations tighten which means less minutes for guys like DJ and Reggie Perry and more for the stars and Jeff Green."
Don't forget Reggie Perry
my working theory is that the Harden trade actually occurred to clear up the log jam at center so Reggie Perry would get more minutes
"Facts. It's all shit talk during the season. Playoffs exposes everyone. Defense wins games. Every day of the year.   Though they have 4 months to establish that bench, I'm not writing them off. Reggie Perry looks like he's poised to have a double/double game and establish himself as a dominant forward off the bench. Luwawu, Shamet, Chiozza; decent guards with decent shooting ability.  **Waaay too early to write them off.** But yes, if playoffs started tomorrow, and Lakers took them on straight away: Lakers in 6."
Probably means Reggie Perry
"I do like Reggie Perry quite a bit but do you guys think he will be enough for the big man depth?   Cause outside of the big position, their bench is decent"
At this point Reggie Perry is going to be the starting center
"Reggie Perry and Nic Claxton are going to be thrown into the fire it seems. Not ideal for “win now”, but I can only imagine how beneficial this team and their journey will be for these two young big men."
"Tough to say due to small sample size, but I’m gonna go with Reggie Perry is currently a poor mans JaMychal Green. Perry is a 6’8/6’9 250lbs 4/5 that has the ability to shoot"
He bringing less value to the team at the moment than Reggie Perry so shit he may as well not be on the team lmao
DeAndre Jordan or Jeff Green when we go small. Give our rookie Reggie Perry some run. Hopefully sign Dedmon.  DeAndre's only skill nowadays is setting monster screens and tapping out o-rebounds haha
"It’s really not that bad, I know it’s the Knicks but guys like Bruce Brown, Reggie Perry have really been stepping up. Buyout market should be great for us. Shamet is starting to get confidence again. Tyler Johnson is a good player who will be back soon. We have high hopes for Claxton."
you’ve already got reggie perry
our bench wont even be that bad   Joe Harris or Bruce Brown/Shamet/Jeff Green/TLC/Tyler Johnson/Nic Claxton (when healthy)/Reggie Perry/Chiozza   will probably sign a few more players to fill it out
"Vince Carter forced his way out of Toronto, he quit even worse than Harden did. He was averaging like 13 a game lol. And it took one dunk on his first night with the Nets to become a fan favorite.  And ask Lakers fans how they feel about AD forcing his way off the Pelicans too. It happens a lot.  And what are you talking about no depth? They lost 3 rotation players and replaced one of them in the same position with Harden, Prince will be replaced with Brown/TLC. The only concern is who can give you 15ish minutes a night at center, and they have Claxton, Perry, 3 open roster spots and a DPE to figure that out.  Don't worry about the future when you have at least 2 years of 2 (hopefully 3) MVP candidates playing for the Nets. The NBA might not even exist in 3 years the way this country is headed, if it does we can all get excited about Reggie Perry as the future."
"Not only traded him for Bruce Brown, but in that same deal, got us Shamet and...would ya look at that...Reggie Perry."
"You know who he is.  Jordan surprisingly not a negative this time. Reggie Perry is thiccc.  Anyway, Bruce Brown with 14 rebounds. Let's goooo"
people really out here sleeping on reggie perry smh
I defo want to see more of Reggie Perry
Who tf is Reggie Perry
"There's also the issue of ball dominance, and the fact that their bench is kinda subpar at this point with Dinwiddie still out. Their only real center is looking straight up washed, and who's the backup? Reggie Perry? A 20 year old, 6'9 PF on a two-way? I'm not that familiar with the Nets rotation so someone can correct me here, but in all honesty that second unit looks rough.  I know this won't happen, but if I were in the Nets FO, I would be trying to move Flat Leaver for more depth."
reggie perry proving the “nets have no depth” crowd wrong
Reggie Perry&gt; DJ
reggie perry gonna be starting over dj lol
Reggie Perry👀
Maybe Jarrett had to go so Reggie Perry could shine
REGGIE PERRY IS THE GOAT   START HIM OVER DJ
"Reggie Perry, 57th pick of the draft this year"
"KD, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, Landry Shamet, TLC, Reggie Perry, Chris Chiozza"
"Cant wait for a lineup of Chiozza, Bruce Brown, Shemet, Luwawu, and Reggie Perry."
Who is going to play in the post for this team?? They're rolling with...  * the Ghost of DeAndre Jordan * Reggie Perry * Nic Claxton  NOT GREAT
"Here's my take. I don't think we're going to see the old Blake Griffin, because anyone who watched any minute of him playing saw that he had a serious decline in athleticism. What Blake mainly tried to do with the Pistons is to be passer and a playmaker, shoot the 3 and take high quality shots.   All of those abilities translate well with the Nets. Adding an extra layer of good passing, and playmaking will only make the current Nets offense even more deadly and efficient; the shooting numbers in Detroit were awful for Blake, but I do think they will improve, because he has now Durant, Harden and Irving.  What Blake doesn't bring to the Nets is defence, rebounding or any inside presence both offensively and defensively. But again, he will mainly play for 20-25 minutes a game and will take Jeff Greens, Reggie Perry and Claxton minutes. Even the worst Blake Griffin is better than those guys.  People need to realize that this team is better with Blake than without him, but anyone who expects that Blake Griffin will bring this team over the top then I have some bad news for you."
That had nothing to do with Harden. So many other factors they have played 7 games together and traded two of their best defenders. Reggie Perry was playing a lot of minutes and the team needed time to practice and get experience together
Ngl I have no clue who Reggie Perry is our what he looks like. Was he drafted this year? 2nd round or 1st round?
I’m glad to see that Reggie perry comment come back around
Reggie Perry balled out at mississippi state.
"Its so crazy to me.  I was just reading through the Nets box score, and I saw this dude ""R. Perry"". Hasn't played a minute tonight, still clicked his name cause I was like ""who the heck is R. Perry?""  Turns out its some dude named Reggie Perry that I had indeed never heard of. Now, I don't think I'll ever forget this dude's name is Reggie when I see ""R. Perry"" on the box score.  Shaq can't even do this for an All-Star, and it's his job! And just to clarify, I don't think I'm smart for remembering Reggie Perry's name, I think this is a super common thing for all NBA fans to do. It's outrageous this dude doesn't know Siakam's first name."
Wtf. Reggie Perry really proved me wrong lmao
It's safe to say Reggie Perry and Norvelle Pelle are averaging closer to 0 than 1
"We were playing reggie perry at center. He would do wonders if he just rebounds and sets screens. Will he adjust his game if he comes here? I think he will, same way harden adjusted his game to win a ring."
"While he isn't good defensively he's certainly better than DJ, he doesn't necessarily scare me rather than just fills a hole that Reggie perry was filling which is certainly an upgrade"
Reggie Perry
Time to send in the true goat Reggie Perry
lol these highlights are with Alize Johnson and Reggie Perry guarding Durant but still the hype!
Here's a list of Prestis first round picks   Player | Pick # ---|--- kevin Durant| 2nd Russell westbrook | 4th serge ibaka | 24th James Harden | 3rd rodrigue beaubois | 25th eric bledsoe | 18th craig brackins | 21st quincy pondexter | 26th reggie Jackson | 24th perry jones | 28th Steven Adams | 12th archie goodwin | 29th alex abrines | 32nd mitch mcgary | 21st josh huestis | 29th Cameron Payne | 14th Terrence ferguson | 21st Brandon Clark | 21st Immanuel Quickley | 25th
"A guy that sees very limited run in the playoffs but can play regular season minutes and take some load off of the big 3 that Brooklyn needs to keep healthy.  Some of those lineups Brooklyn was running with just Harden out there were really bad.  Slotting in guys like LMA and Blake, even though they aren't great, are big upgrades to those lineups.  LMA and Blake over guys like TLC and Reggie Perry are very good regular season upgrades."
Reggie Perry
"Just because it's not what a team ""needs"" doesn;t mean they aren;t solid NBA players and talent.  After the harden trade they were relying on 30+ minutes a night from luwawu cabarrot, Tyler Johnson and Reggie Perry.  Heck people were tickled they found norvel pelle so they actually had a body"
"because even washed up, he's still better than Reggie Perry or whoever played PF for them  it's not like he's Dirk in his last season when he could barely move"
reggie perry
"Nets have played 27.  In order of total minutes: Joe Harris, Kyrie Irving, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, James Harden, Landry Shamet, DeAndre Jordan, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Kevin Durant, Tyler Johnson, Nicolas Claxton, Blake Griffin, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Chris Chiozza, Taurean Prince, Reggie Perry, Alize Johnson, LaMarcus Aldridge, Mike James, Spencer Dinwiddie, Andre Roberson, Norvel Pelle, Tyler Cook, Rodions Kurucs, Iman Shumpert, Noah Vonleh"
"DAJ, Blake Griffin, Mike James, Reggie Perry, and Cabarot are actual bums, and Shamet is notriously inconsistent. Claxton has been injured really often."
"That’s because we didn’t have Blake yet and Claxton was still out at that time so we didn’t have any bigs other than DJ and Jeff Green (and our late 2nd round pick Reggie Perry). Also, Shamet was playing terribly back then"
"Reggie Jackson was a very solid point guard at that time. Perry Jones isn’t even in the league anymore. Kanter’s minutes didn’t eat up KD’s portion of the rotation either lmfao.  And hey, you’re totally right! KD did very well in 2013 against the Grizzlies without Westbrook, didn’t he?   Plus you’re making an egregious fallacy by using Westbrook’s performance after KD’s departure to reenforce your argument which pertains only to when the two played together. Maybe sharpen up your debating skills."
"Conversely, that win for the nets came without Harden and was also before Claxton and Blake. I mean Reggie perry is the very last man on the bench among the healthy bodies and he got rotation mins in that game"
"If Russ could win 55% on his own he was hardly getting carried. And you’re missing absolutely crucial context: when Russ was out, he was replaced by Reggie Jackson who played extremely well during that stretch. When KD went out, who replaced him? If I recall it was Perry Jones III. Not much more that needs to be said.   Neither KD or Russ carried each other on OKC, it was simply a fantastic duo."
"Also, when we were negotiating with Reggie, he had a physical problem. Scott Perry said to his agent that there was no way we were backing out of the deal or changing any number regarding his salary. His agent said that The Knicks were a first-class organization. Reggie rewarded the trust of the FO in him while he was in a difficult situation."
"No bullshit, can Reggie Perry play center? Like, how bad would a Clax / Perry rotation be? DJ's killing me."
"&gt;Nobody knew how good Marc Gasol would’ve been, he was basically a throw in  He won the MVP in La Liga that year.  You've zero idea what you are talking about.  &gt; Crittenton was solid but nothing spectacular at all   He was a prospect, who had just been drafted #19 overall.  Like I said.  &gt; First rounders don’t mean much for contending teams   Harden was just traded for them, among many other players.  &gt;It’s basically if Vucevic was traded to the Nets for Bruce Brown, DeAndre Jordan, two first rounders, and Reggie perry.   No, it's not like that at all -- and Orlando didn't get much more than that anyway,"
"Nobody knew how good Marc Gasol would’ve been, he was basically a throw in  Crittenton was solid but nothing spectacular at all, and his career blew up due to a multitude of things  First rounders don’t mean much for contending teams  Kwame sucked and actively held the team back when they had to play him for a couple games   It’s basically if Vucevic was traded to the Nets for Bruce Brown, DeAndre Jordan, two first rounders, and Reggie perry. That’s an awful deal for Orlando"
"God dammit Steve Nash play Deandre Jordan, Tyler Johnson, and Reggie Perry against this lineup you coward"
"I don’t understand the logic right now. The nets are not in a win now situation.  They retain the following players for the next 2 seasons: - Kyrie Irving - Kevin Durant - James Harden - Joe Harris  They have the following under contract for next season: - Spencer Dinwiddie  - DeAndre Jordan - Landry Shamet - Nicholas Claxton - Alize Johnson  They potentially lose: - Blake Griffin (Starter minutes) - Bruce Brown (Bench/Starter minutes) - Jeff Green (bench/starter minutes) - Mike James (Bench Minutes) - Reggie Perry (Reserve) - Timothe LC (Reserve) - Tyler Johnson (Reserve)  Most of the expiring contracts are Minimum contracts or the MLE. The nets are in an ok spot going into next season, and they don’t need starter minutes they need decent or even meh bench minutes. They’ll be able to attract ring chasers. This is not a win or bust season. Keep James Harden healthy.  Even though I may be biased as a bucks fan it’s illogical to push someone injured to play, like a lot of nets fans are. Getting AD this season and KD from 2019 vibes."
"i think it's more that the Nets are thin beyond their absurdly good big 3 and Harris, because, well, of course they would be, so if you're counting on bruce brown to sub for kyrie and, i dunno, reggie perry or somebody to replace Harden, then you're gonna have a bad time. Nets will have the best player on the floor but the Bucks will have more overall talent."
Reggie Perry to MIA confirmed
"Nets waved the white flag when Nash sub the current lineup of TLC and Reggie Perry on the floor. This is not a dagger, this is cherry on top"
"*OT sorta about ""Tecmo NBA Basketball"" for the NES (1992), the very first game with official NBA and NBPA licenses*:  I recently found out that I have a copy of ""Tecmo NBA Basketball"" for the NES *and* a working NES (*don't ask how I just figured this out*), so I gotta talk about this game. I don't want to discuss its gameplay because you already know it sucks. Rather I'd like to talk about the details it includes for the players (*nope, not graphically, because those are pretty generic*), chiefly their abilities. Each player's profile page ([MJ's profile as an example](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/nes/587685-tecmo-nba-basketball/images/22)) includes their FG%, FT%, 3FG%, and then 6 abilities: Running Speed, Jumping, Stealing, Blocking, Shooting Range, and Stamina. Those shooting percentages are from the 1990-91 season, and the rosters reflect the 1991-92 season. OK, you got the basics; time to look at this game's choices with player abilities.  * First, here is [a detailed scan of the game's front and back cover](https://www.covercentury.com/covers/nes/t/nes_tecmonbabasketball.jpg). Again, this is the first game ever with licenses from both the NBA and NBPA, so it can use all the real teams and players. It can put anyone it wants on the cover -- It was early-1992, so probably Michael Jordan, or Magic Johnson, or Larry Bird, or David Robinson. Look closely at the main player making the play on the cover -- that's Clipper **Loy Vaugt**. The Clippers weren't good in '91, weren't supposed to be good in '92, Vaught was a rookie of no note in '91 (*5.5 ppg, #13 pick in '90 draft*) .... I can't figure out the choice that was made here.  * Speaking of the timing of this game's release - it came out with rosters set for the 1991-92 season, including mega-star **Magic Johnson** on the Lakers. Except Magic retired in November of 1991 and never played for the '92 team. Oh well.   * **RUNNING SPEED:** The game shows you a bar graph for each player's ability, but over the years people have gone into the code and pulled out the specific number that Tecmo assigned to players' ratings ([all player ratings in the game are at this link](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/nes/587685-tecmo-nba-basketball/faqs/50445) - *scroll way down*). Ratings are out of 100, but few speeds topped 80; somehow Jeff Ruland and Magic Johnson both had an 80 speed. Ruland is a particularly egregious selection for this fast speed since he was just coming out of 4-year retirement at that point due to massive foot troubles. The fastest players in the game, with Speeds above 80, are: **1)** Michael Jordan (90), Charles Barkley (90), **3)** Tim Hardaway (85), Jerome ""Pooh"" Richardson (85), and **5)** Orlando Woolridge (81). Barkley, huh? For that matter, MJ also has no business with the best speed in the game.  * **JUMPING:** The best jumpers/leapers in the game, with Jumping above 70, are: **1)** Michael Jordan (80), Manute Bol (80), **3)** Dennis Rodman (78), Orlando Woolridge (78), **5)** Clyde Drexler (75), David Robinson (75), Hakeem Olajuwon (75), Scottie Pippen (75), Patrick Ewing (75), **10)** Elden Campbell (74), and **11)** Otis Thorpe (72). As you can see, this category sort of stands in for ""reach"" for tall centers who get lots of blocks.  * **Best Overall Athletes** in the game based on Running Speed &amp; Jumping (RS/J) are: **1)** Michael Jordan (90/80), **2)** Orlando Woolridge (81/78), **3)** Dennis Rodman (80/78), **4)** Scottie Pippen (80/75), **5)** Shawn Kemp (80/70), David Benoit (80/70), and **7)** Larry Johnson (75/70).   * **STEALING:** The best at stealing in the game, with ability above 60, are: **1)** Kevin Johnson (65), Tyrone ""Muggsy"" Bogues (65), Michael Jordan (65), Scottie Pippen (65), Maurice Cheeks (65), Terry Porter (65), John Stockton (65), Mark Price (65), Greg Anthony (65), Michael Adams (65), **11)** Isiah Thomas (63). I'll point out that **Gary Payton** only had a rating of 45, which is oddly low, even based on the circumstances. He had just completed his rookie season in 1990-91, and his 2.0 spg were 12th best in the league despite only playing 27 mpg (*his Steal% was 5th-best in the NBA*). He had been the Pac-10 Defensive POTY and had a ridiculous amount of steals in college (*#2 in NCAA career all-time at that point*). There was both his college reputation &amp; proof as an NBA rookie that the guy was a big-time ball theft, so I'm unsure why they kept his Stealing rating as low as they did going into his 2nd season. Weirder yet, Greg Anthony graduated in '91 right before the game was developed with nearly the same amount of college steals as Payton (329 vs 321), but had no NBA success yet since he hadn't played yet, but he got the great rating (65) and Payton didn't (45).   * **BLOCKING:** The best at blocking in the game, with ability above 60, are: **1)** David Robinson (90), **2)** Hakeem Olajuwon (80), **3)** Manute Bol (75), **4)** Elden Campbell (72), **5)** Rik Smits (70), John Salley (70), Chris Dudley (70), **8)** Larry Nance (65), Mark Eaton (65), **10)** Alton Lister (62)  * **Best Overall Defensive Abilities** in the game based on having 40+ in Stealing &amp; Blocking (S/B) are: **1)** John Salley (40/70), **2)** Scottie Pippen (65/40), Shawn Kemp (45/60), **4)** Larry Johnson (50/50), Chris Gatling (45/55), **6)** A.C. Green (53/43), **7)** Reggie Lewis (50/40), Billy Owens (45/45), **9)** Tim Perry (40/45), Jerome Kersey (45/40), **11)** Tyrone Hill (40/40), David Benoit (40/40)  * **SHOOTING DISTANCE:** This isn't 3-point ability, as that's measured by 3FG%, but I think this affects how consistent a player is at hitting that 3FG% ... something like that. There are a bunch of guys with a 100 in this category, mostly 3-point specialists who it makes sense to give that top score to: Dell Curry, Reggie Miller, Craig Hodges, Dale Ellis, Glen Rice, and even Larry Bird (*plus others*). But for some reason they simply decided to give a 100 shooting distance ability to Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, as well. I guess they just wanted to game their own game however they needed to to make sure the 2 biggest superstars ended up putting up superstar stats no matter what.   * **STAMINA:** If a guard played almost every game, they probably got an 80+ stamina. Players with a stamina above 80 are: **1)** Michael Adams (90), Kevin Johnson (90), Tim Hardaway (90), John Stockton (90), Tyrone ""Muggsy"" Bogues (90), **6)** Spud Webb (85), Terry Porter (85), Jerome ""Pooh"" Richardson (85), **9)** Sarunas Marciulionis (83), **10)** Gary Grant (81). This last one is an obvious error since Grant had played in only 65 and 44 games over the prior 2 seasons.  * **David Benoit:** You might have noticed that David Benoit is among the best athletes &amp; best overall defensive abilities. I'm as confused as you are -- sure he was a good athlete (*was in the '93 dunk contest*), but he was also an unheralded rookie in the 1991-92 season, meaning he never even played in the NBA before this game came out. He went undrafted in 1990, played in Spain for a year, then joined the Jazz. He was a decent-not-great player at Alabama at the same time as Robert Horry, but nothing he did there (*including his defensive stats*) leads anyone to believe the abilities given to him make any sense."
The NBA is a FUCKING JOKE!   REGGIE PERRY OUTPERFORMED JOCIK IN EVERY STAT CATEGORY    #REGGIEROBBED
"Those games against the Cavs were their first games together and we were playing basically a completely different rotation. Claxton was still hurt at the time, we didn't have Blake yet (or Mike James), DeAndre Jordan and Reggie Perry was our big man rotation and TLC was getting big minutes."
"He still got some guys mixed up, one I remember is that he called a TLC 3 when it was actually Reggie Perry. Those guys look nothing alike."
"Even Reggie Perry, our resident BUM, went 3 for 3 and 9 points in garbage time against the Bucks."
"Reggie Perry and Mike James made as many threes as Giannis, Middleton, and Jrue combined."
Reggie Perry back to back threes were a real back breaker
"Reggie Perry and Mike James made as many threes as Giannis, Middleton, and Jrue combined."
Good to see Reggie perry turned back into Reggie perry
Reggie Perry is pretty good. Hope he keeps developing.
When Reggie Perry starts hitting 3s it’s bad
Reggie Perry with 8 points in 2 minutes. Goat shit
I almost feel bad for the bucks but reggie perry hitting 3's is making me feel even worse
lol Reggie Perry is cooking
Reggie perry was a g leaguer and he’s crushing the bucks
Reggie Perry &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
You know its bad when Reggie Perry gets MVP chants
REGGIE PERRY!
WTF AT REGGIE PERRY
When Reggie Perry is splashing 3s on you that’s when you know you’re down bad
REGGIE PERRY
REGGIE PERRY HIT 2 3S WHAT THE FUCK LMFAO
"Marv, Reggie Perry and TLC look nothing alike"
REGGIE PERRY HITTING 3S JESUS
who is reggie perry?
JEEZUZ even reggie perry is scoring
Put Reggie Perry in you cowards
Reggie Perry in. Bucks in trouble.
"I was about to say what about Reggie Perry, but I forgot he was a draft day rights trade."
Reggie Perry
"Reggie Perry, our rookie, probably."
"I might have slightly exaggerated, Reggie Perry routinely had 20+ a game in January, not quite 30 :).     TLC got 30+ a bunch though, and even played 40 minutes in a game"
Lol TLC and Reggie Perry have never sniffed 30 min a game in their life 🤣
"This is why we always said depth is their biggest issue.  They were lucky buyout candidates wanted to ring chase, again they were playing Reggie Perry and TLC 30+ minutes a game earlier in the season.  Losing Aldridge was a huge blow, he would have wide open jumpers all game"
And Reggie perry if you count him being G-League
He’s a meme but he’s definitely better than Reggie Perry
"This “put up good numbers against professionals” stuff is hella overblown. I love Green too but we gotta stop pretending like the g league is something it ain’t. For one, there’s 0 rim protection down there, all the centres are 6’8 or smaller. He put up 17 points a game on OK splits in only 16 games, only 1 month of basketball. In that small sample size you’d wanna see better production from someone touted as a generational scorer, I mean Cade scored more &amp; shot better on double the games while being the focal point of the defence  &amp; a much worse supporting cast  Paul Reed, Henry Ellenson, KPJ, Jordan Poole, Jared Harper, Ignas Brazdeikas, Rayjon Tucker, Kobi Simmons, Moses Brown, Mamade Diakate, Jeremiah Martin, Brodric Thomas, BJ Johnson, Reggie Perry, Nik Staukas and Nico Mannion all averaged more points than Green on either similar or better efficiency man. Green’s numbers were just OK."
Ugh how about you guys take cavs legend joe Harris instead… maybe sprinkle in some REGGIE… Perry.
PG: Monte Morris/Jalen Brunson  SG: Shake Milton  SF: Matisse Thybulle/Jalen McDaniels  PF: OG Anunoby/George's Niang  C: Pascal Siakam/Reggie Perry  We don't get draft picks
They absolutely should. Tell Reggie Perry and Jordan that you regret that they only have six fouls to give for their team
"Lmfao yes!!! I am a PG on the raptors and 4 years in we have me, siakam, Wiseman and Reggie perry. Wiseman drops like 28 a game in the post"
"KD was for sure, but Westbrook and Harden definitely weren't no brainers. I specifically remember people saying the Thunder reached for Westbrook and there were other guys in Harden's class getting mocked to the Thunder (Rubio, Steph, Tyreke).  Other notable picks besides Ibaka:  -Reggie Jackson at 24   -Steven Adams at 12 was a great pick considering how trash the '13 class was   -Sabonis at 11 (he basically made the pick for the Magic in that trade)  -Cam Payne at 14 is now looking like it was a solid pick   -Maledon at 34    Presti has whiffed on some late first round guys like Josh Huestis, Perry Jones, and Mitch McGary, but has shown he's pretty solid at evaluating talent when he actually has picks to use imo."
"Whenever I see Reggie Perry on the court, I don’t need any other context to know that Steve Nash said “fuck it”"
Y'all ain't ready for Reggie Perry
we have a spot because we just took away the QO to reggie perry scrub ass
"Man I’m a terrible talent scout, I thought for sure Reggie Perry would be good coming out of MSU. So he’s that bad, huh?"
Reggie Perry
Sharpe looked like one of the best players on the court and he got benched for Reggie Perry smh
"It's a testament to how good BOTH of those dudes were in the OKC days. The 2014 team that lost in six in the WCF to the Spurs (who blasted the Heat by 20 ppg) had KD, Russ, and injured/hobbled Ibaka, a third-year Reggie Jackson, and then the rest of their playoff rotation was Kendrick Perkins, washed Caron Butler, rookie Steven Adams, Jeremy Lamb, and 39-year-old Derek Fisher. They won 59-games in the West that included Memphis, upstart Golden State, the peak lob city Clippers, and the champion Spurs.   KD and Russ were the only players in the Spurs series to average more than 12 ppg. Fisher was their fifth leading scorer with 5.7 ppg. Perry Jones, Lamb, Butler and Jackson combined to shoot 12/28 for three in the series. Fisher did shoot 8/17 from three, but was horrendous at everything else, including 3/13 from two in the series.  The 2016 Thunder beat the 67-win Spurs in six and then were up 3-1 on the 73-win Warriors before an epic collapse and a Klay Thompson miracle game 6. They lost the series because Klay and Steph combined to shoot 42% from three on over 21 combined attempts her game, and Harrison fuckin' Barnes somehow put in 10/19 from three over the series before turning into dogshit in the finals. While Russ didn't shoot well in the series, he did get to the line roughly nine time per game and shot 82% from there, and put up a statline of 27 / 11 / 7 and 3.7 steals per game. His defense was a key part of flummoxing the Warriors machine. The Thunder shot 32% in the series from three, and KD shot 29%.   They had a better overall roster in 2016 with Adams, Roberson, Waiters and Kanter, but still lacked a consistent supporting cast, had no outside shooting, and didn't have other creators on their roster. They still probably should have won the title.  In 2013, they had the best record in the West and Russ' knee was destroyed in the first playoff game. In 2015, KD hurt his foot and was out most of the season.  So, basically, even after Harden was gone they were in competitive WCF series against excellent teams every season Russ and KD were healthy. I am pretty confident they win a title or two over the next few seasons if KD stayed."
"I mean, he just has to be better than Reggie Perry and we'll take it tbh"
Reggie Perry always becomes a monster in a few years on 2k
"Yeah it was great to see, especially after we traded JA and we had as our bigs DJ and Reggie Perry for a hot second"
"Patty Mills, Paul Millsap, Lamarcus Aldridge, James Johnson, Javon carter, D’andre bembry, Sekou Doumbouya, Cam Thomas, Day’ron sharpe, Kessler edwards is a massive upgrade on Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Alize Johnson, Luwawu-caberet, Reggie Perry"
"Reading some of the comments that Millsap is washed, or he is a shell of his former self, or he can't play big minutes?  So?  Is he still better than anyone else the Nets can play at the 5 for limited minutes?  To me that's how you measure if it's a good move or not.  Running Millsap out for the minutes that Reggie Perry was getting is a big plus.  Getting DJ's minutes could be a plus too.  Allowing Griffin more rest (cause he sat out a large chunk of last year) would be a plus too."
"I've heard arguments that he's taking up a valuable roster spot but who is he taking a roster spot from in this market? Maybe Reggie Perry? I'd rather have DJ cheering from the bench and happily live with the fact that having KD, Kyrie and Harden cost us 4 roster spots."
"How about the Clippers screwing themselves with Luke Kennard on this deal:  Nets receive: G Landry Shamet and draft rights to F Reggie Perry (57th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft) from Los Angeles; G Bruce Brown from Detroit  Clippers receive: G Luke Kennard, C Justin Patton and four second-round draft picks (Portland 2023, Detroit 2024, 2025 and 2026) from Detroit; draft rights to G/F Jay Scrubb (55th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft) from Brooklyn  Pistons receive: Draft rights to Saddiq Bey (19th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft), F Dzanan Musa, draft rights to G Jaylen Hands and Toronto's 2021 second-round draft pick from Brooklyn; G Rodney McGruder and cash considerations from Los Angeles  You get .. Kennard, who you proceed to extend for a crazy price of 14 mil a year,(Mavs fans even mock the clips over it  https://fansided.com/2021/06/04/mavs-fans-are-taunting-luke-kennard-contract/#:~:text=In%20December%2C%20Kennard%20inked%20a,63%20games%20played%20this%20season )  and you gave away what would have been Saddiq Bey.  Saddiq is already much better than Kennard, and has a cheap rookie contract.  Disaster for the clips, payback for dealing the Pistons Blake hah.  The blake griffin trade is worse, in retrospect.  Pistons gave up Tobias Harris, Avery Bradley, Boban Marjanovic and future first- and second-round draft picks"
"Because the NBA doesn’t focus on real talent anymore, players like Reggie Perry and Mike James have been put on the back burner while players like Sabonis get paraded as all stars."
We had Nicholas Claxton who got winded if he got too many minutes. Then would run Green at the 5. We also had a G-leaguer named Reggie Perry who we’d throw in. Anyone but him. Harden hated him.
"KD, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, Landry Shamet, TLC, Reggie Perry, Chris Chiozza"
Nic Claxton and Reggie Perry on a 2-way
"KD, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, Landry Shamet, TLC, Reggie Perry, Chris Chiozza"
Hey don’t forget big man Reggie Perry...
"Nic Claxton, Reggie Perry, Deandre"
"The nets defense is going to be terrible, they desperately need to make another trade or signing. I mean look at this roster they will be playing now:  Kyrie Irving / Landry Shamet / Bruce Brown  James Harden / Tyler Johnson  Joe Harris / Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot  Kevin Durant / Jeff Green  Deandre Jordan / Reggie Perry  The offensive firepower is insane but who would stop Giannis and Lopez down low?"
Or Reggie Perry. His skillset fits with Harden
Reggie Perry slander will not be tolerated
"Chris Chiozza, Reggie Perry and Tyler Johnson"
