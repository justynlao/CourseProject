Ok so I know a cousin of miles bridges ex girlfriend's other ex boyfriend. I'll get miles to ask MJ
Miles Bridges hands down
BRING BACK MILES BRIDGES
"My thoughts exactly. Zion needs to play on the line somewhere with his size. Someone like Miles Bridges would be way better at TE than AD, He has decent size, but also the hops to go up and get contested balls in the endzone."
"Yes.  We should absolutely add a mediocre guard to fill in the gaps in our roster.  After all, we only have four players currently that can fill those two spots.  There is just no excuse in todays NBA to not trade for a guy who would be the fourth or fifth choice to get court time if he comes available.  The need here is even more drastic than our lack of a decent second option at center when our starter is made of tissue paper.    Do you think they'd take some combination of PJ Washington or Miles Bridges, and our next two first round picks to make this happen?"
"Borrego's usual rotation move of handcuffing him to Miles Bridges is helpful.  Miles does a great job of getting open, catches everything, and if it's around the rim, he's going to jam it with authority.  I felt bad for Miles trying to feed Biz ""Hands of Stone"" Biyombo for the first month of his career.  Imagine doing something incredibly creative to draw the defense, zipping a laser to a now-open center, and 75% of the time having him kick it out of bounds.  Had to be hell on his confidence."
Believe is was Miles Bridges. They connected on another pretty crazy Oop last night too
"For real, go find someone who makes you smile the way Lemelo makes Miles Bridges smile"
What about Miles Bridges? That‚Äôs 6
Seriously miles bridges dunk rating on 2k should be 90+ and his ability to catch lobs should be 95+. What other pair of teammates has this many lobs every game? You can count on 2-3 every single game
LaMelo is the best thing that could have happened to Miles Bridges career. By the end of the season we‚Äôll have a full 5 minute mixtape of just Lamelo -&gt; Bridges lobs
MILES BRIDGES HAS DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS üíéü§öüèª
"Miles Bridges, Zach Lavine and Bradley Beal"
"I love me some Cam Johnson but that just ain't it. Barnes, Anthony, White, and Green are all better players atm  &amp;#x200B;  Also, Miles Bridges is ballin out with Melon off the bench so can't forget about him."
I really enjoy Miles Bridges. I hope he finds a way to get a bigger role on this Hornets team.
"Ive got 7 pages to go of players, but heres how divisions are shaking out:       \*\*The Kitchen\*\*  Dwayne Bacon  Jordan Bone  Quinn Cook  Seth/Steph Curry       \*\*dopplenamers\*\*  LaMelo/Lonzo Ball  Jordan Bell  Rudy Gay  Kyle Guy       \*\*Scenic\*\*  Mikal/Miles Bridges  Dillon Brooks  Trent Forrest  Dearon Fox            \*\*Festive\*\*  Aaron/Jrue/Justin Holiday  Darius Garland"
"Miles Bridges measured 6'5.25 barefoot and PJ Washington measured 6'6.5 barefoot at their respective NBA combines. Lamelo does seem to be of similar height, so I'd guess he is in that 6'5-6'6 range."
"that was his listed height until a couple weeks ago, when they dropped it to 6'6.   He's similar in height to Miles Bridges and PJ Washington who are 6'6 and 6'7"
Another Hornet: Miles Bridges. He‚Äôs just fun. Catches a body at least once per game
"Win wise, the Hornets are performing about how I thought they would. I still don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll make the playoffs, but the play-in game is a real possibility.   Excitement wise, I‚Äôm feeling way more hyped than I thought I‚Äôd be. LaMelo looks more like a future Star than any Charlotte Hornets player I can remember. Our team is also extremely fun to watch; you can clearly see the Spurs influence in Borrego‚Äôs offense.   Other than LaMelo, I‚Äôm most surprised/excited about the jump Miles Bridges has made. The counting stats may not show it, but he‚Äôs playing *way* better than he was his first two seasons."
"A trade I'd be a big fan of is:  **Cavs trade:** Andre Drummond.   **Hornets trade:** Miles Bridges, Malik Monk, Cody Zeller.   Monk is out of favour there, Bridges has lost his starting job to Hayward, and Zeller expires at the end of this season just like Drummond.   Cavs get another wing in Bridges and the chance to take a swing on Monk."
I like to see what they‚Äôre talking about. Like I never would have known that miles bridges improved if I didn‚Äôt sub to the hornets sub.
"Idgaf if the pick is in the lottery, I‚Äôd rather take a established superstar that‚Äôs not that old over a lottery pick. That‚Äôs like saying would you rather have LeBron or devonte and miles bridges"
Aka miles bridges son
"Miles Bridges, Cody Zeller, PJ Washington, Biyombo.."
"I mean I‚Äôd pick guys with Length and Jumpin ability.   Giannis, Dwight, DJJ, Miles Plumlee, Miles Bridges, and Boban"
"Miles Bridges improved too, he‚Äôs making those threes now. LaMelo looking like an nba pg already."
who will the Hornets give? Miles Bridges?
"Beautiful pass, very love Miles Bridges his violent dunk!"
"romo also studies the specific teams and game the night before, its way more focused. barkley and shaq really only watch like 5-7 games a week, at worst probably just the tnt broadcast games, and theyre not watching the cavs or hornets lmao so theres no way theyll be able to know who dameyean dotson or miles bridges are."
Miles Bridges has really reinvented himself
Miles Bridges is nice bruh.
Miles Bridges is pretty much the second-coming of Christ imo
Miles Bridges.  Kilometers Overpasses.  Call him K.O.
"Well Zeller is a $15M expiring contract so he *could* be a pretty useful piece to help us match salaries in a trade where we would attach actual assets (picks, maybe somebody like Miles Bridges or PJ Washington, etc.). Probably doesn't get used (we had the same situation with MKG and Marv last season and just waived both at the deadline), but I still rather have that option available than to use it on Drummond. Basically I just don't want anything to do with the guy."
"Yeah less is more with AG offensively Zach Lowe has said it for years needs to be more like Draymond but he keeps wanting to play like Paul George.   I brought up Gordon because it's really hard to find good defensive wings who can play 30 min a night after the first round of the playoffs. The teams who have them arent looking to deal them.   Garrett Temple is another option but this team really needs a big wing, Durant types are the real issue. Maybe ""small forward"" Larry Nance is available. I havent kept up with Miles Bridges but that might be another one also"
I‚Äôm pretty sure last game miles bridges threw one from inbound to Melo under the basket. But I‚Äôm too lazy to hunt the highlight.
"Yea I gotcha. Miles Bridges, Patrick Williams, Tatum, etc. All of them have yet to surpass him though"
Miles Bridges
Miles bridges has been nice to watch. I hadn't noticed him until this year but he has been a nice surprise
"Devonte Graham, Terry Rozier, Gordan Hayward, Miles Bridges, PJ Washington, Bismack Biyombo, Caleb Martin, Cody Martin, Malik Monk, Jalen McDaniels, Cody Zeller"
"This team is proving to be more entertaining to watch than I gave them credit for coming into the season. Between the NOP game, Lamelo, Miles Bridges, and scary terry they‚Äôre starting to win me over as a must watch."
Miles Bridges and PJ Washington
I remember it was either last year or the year before everyone was calling Miles a bust. It is fun to see both Bridges from that draft are doing well.
"LaMelo, Scary Terry, Miles Bridges thunder dunks, PJ Washington big man 3's, Martin Twins go HAM and Hayward filling it up from the wing. Watch us Reddit!"
holy hell Miles Bridges with the 2 points +23? Nice
Miles bridges does them
I feel like he lost control but did push it to Bridges (that is Miles right?) i assume they‚Äôre not giving him credit cuz he lost the ball first and didnt really regain posession
Miles Bridges has hands down the best highlights of any non-star in the league. He was so fun to watch play for Sparty.
"You are correct, it was Miles Bridges not Biyombo. I apologize and edited my comment."
Miles Bridges... thats all
I've always thought Scary Terry was capable of dropping 60.  Miles Bridges has been a human highlight reel tonight. Sheesh. Idk how I like the Steven Adams/Zion fit. Smaller guards are gonna cook Adams if he keeps sitting back in the PnR.  Best lineup in crunch time should have Zo/JJ/Hart/Ingram/Zion.
Pelicans vs. The Miles Bridges Contest
"I said it once and I‚Äôll say it again, Lamelo Ball was the best player out of the 2020 draft. He‚Äôs playing well for charlotte creating, scoring and oddly enough he‚Äôs defending every once in a while, not every time though. He plays well with Gordon Hayward and Miles Bridges. He can also finish with the best of them."
"Even when they did, Batum was either mailing it in or playing really badly. Not surprised they decided to just say fuck it and play Miles Bridges more"
LaMelo  PJ Washington   Miles Bridges  Jalen McDaniels  Terry Rozier  Devonte Graham  Cody Zeller
Is this Mikal Bridges or Miles Bridges?
"MPJ and Bridges are miles better than Bagley. He has an outdated game, yet doesn't have an effective post game, and has not improved at all."
"Miles bridges, Dbacon, and Lou will are the best rappers"
"Finally someone said it, I remember seeing MB for Mikal Bridges as if there isn‚Äôt multiple people in the league with those initials (Miles Bridges, Malcolm Brogdon, Marvin Bagley, ETC)"
"I would almost be willing to bet some interior big man is going to drop 50 on the Hornets this season. Whether it happens without a 3 idk, but I can totally see Giannis or AD having their way with Charlotte's swiss cheese frontcourt.   Zeller is currently hurt, and we are asking Miles Bridges to play center when Biz and PJ Washington aren't on the floor.  60 would be wild. All the bigs capable of that can hit a three."
anyone want to discuss miles bridges weak turnaround shot?
how many travels is miles bridges going to get away with lol
"Charlotte I actually really like your team. We are just the best team in the NBA.   Why doesn't Miles Bridges start? I like PJ Washington as well, but Bridges is so high energy and actually closes out on shooters."
Miles Bridges doesn‚Äôt start
Hayward x Miles Bridges &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
"In myCareer on 2K; Charlotte ended up with a starting five of Lamelo, Paul George, Gordon Hayward, Miles Bridges, and Boogie. I‚Äôve had an irrational fear of the Hornets ever since they whipped me."
Miles bridges is probably top 5 in terms of players most likely to tear down the backboard the next 5 years
Miles Bridges or Anthony Edwards could've won this in their sleep
"Miles Bridges should‚Äôve made it, who else did a practical windmill"
"So you‚Äôre telling me. Derrick Jones, Lavine, Zion, Dwight, Connaughton, Diallo, DSJ, and Miles Bridges (more than those) all declined the dunk contest? Cant tell me there isn‚Äôt someone better than Cassius Stanley"
I know Miles Bridges declined.
"Ja vs. Zion vs. Miles Bridges vs. D Mitch next year dunk contest, that‚Äôs ratings gold"
"Generally speaking, once Kupchak was hired we started cutting losses from the end of the Bobcats-early Hornets 2.0 era and started drafting a lot better. We didn‚Äôt have much to build on and our picks were still in the 9-12 range for the several drafts before last year‚Äôs. We let Kemba walk in free agency, along with MKG, Marvin Williams, Frank Kaminsky, etc, as all were kinda one side of the ball limited players.   Kupchak has drafted Miles Bridges (12th), Devonte‚Äô Graham (35th), PJ Washington (12th), and LaMelo (2nd). We‚Äôve picked up Cody and Caleb Martin, and Jalen McDaniels as second rounders or undrafted free agents with some potential. We got Terry Rozier in a sign and trade with Boston when Kemba left and the contract was considered iffy, but he‚Äôs definitely lived up to it. We also signed Hayward this offseason with a similar reaction from the league and he‚Äôs still got a ways to go to earn it, but so far, so good. Only Malik Monk and Cody Zeller remain from the pre-Kupchak era and we brought Bismack Biyombo back.   We‚Äôre still kinda straddling building for the future and winning now, but the general consensus is that we‚Äôre young and competitive with potential to internally improve. We still need a solid big man or three, but otherwise we‚Äôve got a pretty solid roster for now and the future."
Lonzo for Miles Bridges or PJ Washington.  Call it in

"Miles Bridges does start, I think he's having a great year in general"
Nice but for some reason I'm more impressed by Miles Bridges' alley-oop dunks from Lamelo so far - like the extension/motion of his arms when catching and stuffing the ball.
"Miles bridges is already one of the biggest lob threats in the league, if you mean a big athletic c I def agree tho"
"Minutes aren't the problem. I'd expect a fully healthy rotation to look something like this:  LaMelo (16min)/Graham (24)/Monk (8)   Rozier (32)/Monk (16)   Hayward (24)/LaMelo (16min)/one Martin twin or flex spot for more guard minutes (8)   Washington (16)/Bridges (24)/Hayward (8)   Zeller (24)/Washington (16)/one of Biz/Carey/Richards/McDaniels or extra minutes for Miles or Zeller (8)    LaMelo, Rozier, Hayward, Washington play starter minutes (32 min)   Graham, Bridges, Monk, Zeller play 24 min   Martin, and one big play 8 min each"
"My first team all defense would be RuDPOY, Miles Turner, Simmons, Mikal Bridges, and   ##DORT"
Haven't been following this too closely but Miles Bridges better be in it
"Thing is, as well as he's scoring, he's a pass first PG. Just the eye test, but unless his team is tied or massively down, he doesn't force shots unless they come in the offense, atleast not anymore.  That's one of the major changes, when he first started games for Charlotte, he was chucking up threes like crazy, and the Efficiency wavered from 7/12 to 1/7 or 1/8. It was either he shoots you into the game, or out of it. Now he's much more composed. He drives whenever possible, and he doesn't force shots.   I remember being in the hornets sub Game thread, and end of third they were down by a lot. Lamelo went in, hit a three, came back, drew a foul and scored two more. In like a minute he took a five point swing to reduce the difference to 9 going into 4th. Same way vs Kings day before yesterday. As soon as they entered the fourth, down 8, lamelo assists Miles on a 3, then comes back a scores two layups and that's a quick 7 point swing. Then again a few days ago vs. the Suns, I remember CP3 tied it with a midrange at 110, lamelo instantly darts across the court and lobs it up to bridges to make it 112-110.   He has ELITE game sense, and I mean top tier. He knows when he absolutely needs to get points on the board, whether it's him scoring and someone else. I just wish sometimes he would stop trusting others to make shots, who aren't really capable of it at that moment (Cue Martin's Bricks)."
I think it was miles bridges
"MVP I believe, wait never mind that was miles bridges"
Hopefully we‚Äôll see Miles Bridges in it too
Is Miles Bridges not enough for you??
"Lamelo, Lebron, with your announcers and casual Miles Bridges and Cody Zeller murders would make me basketball horny all 96 games"
"bro imagine being a suns fan and somehow think you got fucked this game lmao! holy shit..... get real people. literally just off the top of my head.... lamelo getting tackled by 2 dudes shooting a 3 in the end of the first quarter, no call. miles bridges fouled on a putback dunk attempt no free throws, terry rozier scraped in the face no call, lamelo ball getting slapped in the face no call, egregious carry by chris paul directly in front of the ref no call, booker elbowing hayward in the face and getting rewarded, ball going out on saric and giving you the ball at the end of the game........ ok thats just off the top of my head"
Miles bridges for showmanship
Miles won the battle of the M. Bridges.
Lamelo had me pulling my damn hair out. When did Miles Bridges become such a knockdown shooter?
Miles Bridges? lmao ^^^
"What about Wiseman and Wiggins for Hayward, and Miles Bridges/PJ Washington/Malik Monk?"
Loving the hornets tid bit of you only got the answer of Lamelo ball and miles bridges
Should I trade for CJ McCollum And give up RJ Barrett miles bridges on Charlotte. Worried about CJ injury and coming back and my playoffs being 3 4 weeks away
"Have you seen Miles Bridges, dude is playing with it hanging out. I love Bridges but it does annoy me a little."
looks a lot like Miles Bridges in the face.
"Miles bridges, Anthony Edwards, Obi Toppin, Ja is who I want to see"
The Miles Bridges Quartet opening for Wayman Tisdale.
"Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, Miles Bridges for sure.  Others I'd love to see: Ja Morant, Jaylen Brown, Zach Lavine (Again)"
It‚Äôd be criminal to leave out Miles Bridges
"LeBron doesn‚Äôt belong in the dunk contest. He‚Äôs the best player in the NBA and he can posterize people but guys like DJJ Gordon or Miles Bridges are 10+ years younger than him. Even staying in great shape, I can‚Äôt come close to dunking at 26 when I could at 20-23. Knees are a bitch"
Miles Bridges are that much better because of that Hornets announcer üòÇüòÇ
No miles bridges? Biased list
"I think a lot will depend on the prospect, their life, their goals, their desires, etc.   You look at a guy like Ben Simmons. I think if he had the option back then he would have gone g-league path. A player like Miles Bridges, a five star recruit, spent 2 years at MSU and some might say would have been better off leaving after after 1.   Also, a lot of guys are gonna be 16-18 years old and a lot of people telling them what they should do. Some will ultimately make the *right* decision some will make the *wrong* decision."
fanning out masks like hundreds and having some of the nastiest dunks in the league ..... Miles Bridges the real deal!!!!
"does it bother anyone else that there is a Miles Bridges and a Mikal Bridges in the NBA and they are 2 years age difference, and they are both 6'6""?  Both first names have only a difference of 2 characters, other than that, they are the same.   It just seems like they should be brothers"
Drummond x Miles Bridges üî•üî•üî•
saw that Drummond post and it reminded me of this classic Miles Bridges gave us. him and his buddy really going bar for bar. honestly best verse from an NBA player I‚Äôve ever heard
he was listed at 6'8 for like the first month of the season then for some reason it was changed to 6'6. However he is slightly taller than Miles Bridges who is also listed at 6'6. So I'm inclined to believe 6'7.
I actually meant Miles Bridges lol but he's imo is the better rapper in the NBA
Miles Bridges only player that can claim to have an actual rap career.
"Is Zeller, Monk, and someone like Miles Bridges an overpay?"
Not sure why Miles Bridges tried to play defense from his knees and just ended up falling into Derrick White.
the hornets are must watch any time lamelo and and miles bridges are in the game
"No. Put Lamelo on the Pelicans and he‚Äôd form a young ‚ÄòBig 3‚Äô and be the facilitator star. Sort of like young Kd, Kyrie, Beard where Melo plays Beard‚Äôs role, not the highest scoring, but mad assists.  He‚Äôd have zion to throw lobs to who‚Äôs basically the star version of Miles Bridges. If Melo can make Bridges have highlights on nba.com like that, imagine him and zion.   The reason why Lonzo has no highlights with zion is because he‚Äôs not a scoring threat. Teams slack off him and double zion because he can‚Äôt score. Melo is a walking PnR with williamson. He‚Äôs a star."
"Hornets 8:  LaMelo, PJ Washington, Miles Bridges, Gordon Hayward, Malik Monk, Devonte Graham, Rozier, Zeller"
Kyle Kuzma for Miles Bridges.  Almost identical numbers.  Hornets probably say no but I'm sure Kuzma would love to play with LaMelo.
Miles Bridges

I was expecting the commentator to say ‚ÄúOH MY GOODNESS... MILES BRIDGES!!!!!‚Äù
It'd be great if he screams Miles Bridges for every dunk even when it's not Miles Bridges dunking
Miles bridges is the man for not freaking out harder about this bs call.
"It was like Miles Bridges now, but even better."
Nah. MJ/Mitch Kupchak(GM) had the bases loaded and needed a clean up hitter.   &amp;nbsp;  Draft Sleepers &amp;nbsp;  Malik Monk 2017  Miles Bridges 2018 traded draft day  Cody Zeller(Questionable addition) &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  Expensive Mercenaries(Surprisingly from the Celtics) &amp;nbsp;  Terry Rozier  Gordon Hayward
He said MBx2 bc Melo Ball/Miles Bridges but let him stick to ballin and we‚Äôll stick to making the nicknames lol
Lmao in the postgame interview the announcer actually asked him what he thought of this nickname and Lamelo said he didn't really like it.  I think he said his current nick name is MBx2 (melo ball x miles bridges) which IMO is way worse but tbf he said it was only temporary and they were still working on something
"Y'know I was cooling on Miles before this season, but he's improved a lot of his weak spots, and has all the tools to be an all star. Needless to say I'm very high on Miles Bridges now."
The way he screams Miles Bridges on every dunk is fucking hilarious. Sounds like he‚Äôs on the verge of crying from sheer joy lmao
"Was going to make this thread if it didn‚Äôt already exist.  I don‚Äôt care about the risk of hyperbole.  Check this out real quick.  This boy was really taking and hitting shots like these, making passes like these, as a freshman in high school on the best high school team in the country.  He scored 92 points one game as a sophomore.  I watched those highlights.  One of his last buckets seriously involved him being guarded by THREE PEOPLE trying to deny him the ball.  He ran and cut for his life and found space and got open and of course nailed a three.  He went to Lithuania and gained valuable hard knock experience.  He went to Spire and his height wouldn‚Äôt stop increasing and now he was regularly dunking.  He went to Australia and played against grown men as an 18 year old and really averaged 17, 7, and 7.    We should never have doubted this kid.  He has so much talent, confidence, experience, and raw physical attributes you cannot teach.    Who else saw his post-game interview?  Miles Bridges jumped on Melo‚Äôs back with this bigass grin on his face.  His teammates love him.  And then Dell dropped a line that really captured it all:  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a guy who is definitely comfortable in his own skin.‚Äù  There‚Äôs something to be said for playing under pressure and the spotlight since the age of 14.  I have no doubt he will hit many a game-winner throughout his career."
We‚Äôre incredibly lucky that LaMelo fell to us in the draft. Him &amp; Miles Bridges are gonna be our franchise players.

"O Romeo, Romeo, wherefor art thou Romeo?  -Miles Bridges, probably"
"If you don't have any affiliation with the University you root for then I can't say I'd understand why you'd watch other than for the love of the game.   I wasn't that into CBB before I went to MSU, but I attended every home game from 2016-2020 and that changed things to say the least. Pretty cool to see Miles Bridges, Jaren Jackson Jr, Xavier Tillman, and Cassius Winston up close and share a little community with my fellow students."

"Dude sucked before the warriors and he‚Äôll suck after, he‚Äôs like a dirt miles bridges with worse percentages"
Was really surprised when the clippers didnt take him. They had back to back pics so the risk/potential reward wasn't that bad.   For reference they used the picks for Miles Bridges (who was traded with 2 2nd round picks for Shai) and Jermone Robinson (was involved in a 3 team trade that got the clippers Marcus Morris)
What's miles bridges' height? Dude looks so small beside Aldridge
"the Hornets traded SGA on draft day for Miles Bridges and Devonte Graham and some other 2nd round pick  SGA was picked 11th, Bridges was 12th."
"&gt;Still the best rap song by an NBA player.  I'm guessing you haven't heard ""Steph McGrady"" by Miles Bridges"
"From a Hornets perspective, I‚Äôd trade Miles Bridges with either Terry Rozier or Gordon Hayward.   The amount of firsts and the protection on those firsts I am unsure over. I‚Äôd start with this years first and then proceed to the bargaining table."
The other funny part is that hornets let clips trade up one spot to guarantee draft shai. Smart move on clips. Then MJ passes on MPJ for miles bridges. Then clips fuck up and draft Jerome over MPJ. When I heard that live I yelled so loud! I love MPJ.
"I think both Bridges played super well.     Mikal is really long, so he has huge defensive potential.  In general i hope they are both good players for their teams.     Miles will need to start taking the leap from a handles perspective.  He could have a Julius Randle style impact if so."
Miles bridges easily then even dame
Devonte' Graham  Miles Bridges  198 other people
Yes I loved when miles bridges got fouled on the ally oop and we got side out of bounds.
"how did Miles Bridges stay in this game after throwing elbows like that? I've seen plenty of players get tossed for that, especially since there was drama leading up to it too, which usually influences refs."
That Miles Bridges dunk was nasty
"They also have PJ Washington, Miles Bridges, Terry Rozier, and Malik Monk. Not saying they have a better future, I‚Äôm just saying they‚Äôre the only team you guys have competition with for that title"
[miles bridges ](https://youtu.be/77Tz7eCPXXI) [James Harden](https://youtu.be/gRyKJVcZKPY)
"I mean hey, maybe its a 3 way trade. totally possible. If theres anyone moveable on the Hornets I'd think they'd want, it'd be Miles Bridges I think."
"I wouldn't do it as the Warriors, but what about Wiggins and the Minnesota pick for Miles Bridges, Rozier and a protected 1st (Top 8, top 6 next year, turns into 2 2nds if not conveyed)?"
"Hornets is getting good now and management is trying to make some dumb trade cool, fucking cool.  Him alongside Monk being the 6th and 7th man off the bench providing firepower with Miles Bridges will not be too bad imo"
Malik is eating a 12 game suspension though lmao. Something like 5 games KAT and DLO has played together since Dlo got traded to the wolves. Shit is actually bananas. Hornets have 3 of the top 5 players between these two rosters imo. Hornets are kind of a sneaky deep and versatile roster.   Terry-Lamelo-Monk-Grahm are all starter or borderline starter quality players. Hayward is awesome. PJ Washington and Miles Bridges are awesome. And regardless of how much shit Biyombo gets he is a servicable big.
"Well considering the Wolves have played some stupid small amount of games with their star D'Angelo Russell and KAT on the court at the same time and have had Ricky Rubio in the worst season of his career really Malik Beasley and Ant Man are the only hope outside of the two stars and no one plays defense rlly. The Hornets are so much of a better team lol, between having a healthy Hayward and the best contract in the league with Terry Rozier not to mention PJ Washington, Devonte Graham, very valuable young pieces that scream future starter in addition to Cody Zeller, Malik Monk, Miles Bridges all very valuable role players. Not to mention the Hornets have been mostly healthy for the entire year"
Miles bridges
"The funny thing about these passes is that playing with LaMelo makes other players want to do it too. In this game, Miles Bridges and PJ Washington both attempted this type of pass and they both threw it wildly out of bounds"
+ Miles Bridges
every miles bridges basketball bar is fire
Miles and Mikal Bridges always throw me for a loop when looking at their names.
"Kevin Porter Jr. and Otto Porter Jr.  Also, Wendell Carter jr, Jaren Jackson jr, and for some reason, Miles Bridges."
"Ineptitude? The Hornets were scrappy and got two steals, and Miles Bridges got blocked by 6'11 Olympic gold medalist Mason Plumlee. Just hating for no reason."
"Yeah, our comparison for ""whiffing on a pick"" is taking Frank Kaminsky instead of Devin Booker. We'll take Miles Bridges every day."
"Lowry, Harden, that one fucking guy on the Rockets who literally jumped sideways into miles bridges and got the call on a 3, CP3 all contenders"
"In my eyes in the not distant future the team that have a lot of great pieces but not a experience coach, Charlotte, Michael hired kupchak and he draft well, and have a a couple of good free agents and a couple of good trades.  And look the roster having a future ROY in melo, and another great picks, pj Washington, devonte graham and miles bridges. Having a great players in a good age bracket, Gordon Hayward and scary terry, a couple of ok role players in Biyombo and Cody Zeller. And a great thing is that the team can improve a lot with a couple of trades for a couple of veterans. Good roster and ok management. A great job for a experience coach. Maybe I‚Äôm stretching things, but I really thing Melo can become a great player."
Hornets could have two in Miles Bridges and PJ Washington
Miles bridges
"June 21, 2018: Traded Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to the Los Angeles Clippers for Miles Bridges, a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Vernon Carey Jr. was later selected) and a 2021 2nd round draft pick. (CHO's 2020 2nd-rd pick from LAC is CLE's pick.)"
"Instead of Miles Bridges he could have taken MPJ, but yeah small nitpick, considering MPJ status at the draft. Overall he's been pretty good at drafting and has hit on the big one (Lamelo)."
"3s are great because they open up spacing and make the game more free flowing. But I get it, we can do better. My 3 bad ideas that I love: No more corner there‚Äôs, a lot of guys live off those short corner 3s. Screw that. I also had dudes trying to take charges instead of blocking shots. Let‚Äôs change the restricted area to the permissive area were any contact is allowed in the air. I want more blocked shots and more dudes can destroyed in the paint by miles bridges and Anthony Edwards. Can we also get a four point line about 10‚Äô beyond the 3 point line?  Oh, and let‚Äôs keep the Elam ending."

Miles Bridges 1.0
I'm still mad about the failed Miles Bridges trade.
This is just not true.   [Some metrics show it was the worst of his career](https://hoopshype.com/lists/nba-most-improved-defenders-andrew-wiggins-miles-bridges-georges-niang-pj-dozier/)
This is how I feel towards the hornets because my player got drafted there in 2k21. Unbelievable how bad Miles Bridges and Cody Zeller are in that game
"Skill: Miles Bridges. If he had a really good handle then he‚Äôd be a killer in iso.  Athleticism: Lamelo. A more athletic Lamelo could be like Russ with a better 3-ball.  Height: Either Terry or PJ. Terry because that would make him the height of a real SG (6‚Äô4), PJ because then he‚Äôd be a better ‚Äúsmall ball center‚Äù that could hope to defend better against rim runners."
Miles bridges how do you do
"**Skill Boost**: Miles Bridges. Bridges has developed a really good jumpshot and really good defense. If he had a better handle he‚Äôd probably be a perennial All-Star.   **Athleticism Boost**: LaMelo Ball. He‚Äôs not bad athletically, but a more athletic LaMelo would be pretty similar to LeBron...  **Length Boost**: PJ Washington. He‚Äôs been our best defensive center this season, but is a little small to play the position full time. If he added a few inches in height he‚Äôd be able to play the position full time and would fix our biggest weakness.   **Other Contenders:** A 6‚Äô4‚Äù-5‚Äù Terry Rozier would be a beast. A 6‚Äô7‚Äù Malik Monk has a lot of potential. An athletic Vernon Carey Jr would be a really good rookie. If the 6‚Äô10‚Äù McDaniels had a really good handle and playmaking he‚Äôd be super interesting, especially since he‚Äôs already a good shooter."
his Miles Bridges calls are always gold
You clearly haven‚Äôt reached the videos of Malik Monk and Miles Bridges dunking yet
"LaMelo, Scary Terry, and this season possibly Miles Bridges? Or Gordon Hayward when he's not hurt"
I like Miles Bridges a lot
"&gt;LaMelo is a driving force and the best playmaker on a team going to the playoffs  So Graham,Rozier,Hayward,Miles Bridges,PJ and Malik Monk had nothing to do with your success this year it was all LaMelo?   &gt;Edwards is an inefficient chucker on a terrible team.  I mean check the stats in the past 2 months and you get a different picture."
"&gt;Devil's advocate; first half of the season also counts (Melo was a lot better pre-All-Star break), and Melo has helped a team that wasn't meant to sniff the playoffs reach that level;   This is the narrative from when he was drafted. Since then they signed Hayward. LaMelo helped a lot sure but a career year from Terry Rozier and the arrival of Hayward were bigger factors not to mention improvements from Malik Monk and Miles Bridges."
Hell yeah and any miles  bridges dunk lol
Was this the cheese Miles Bridges was referring to?
Miles bridges is üí©
"Trae, John Collins, Giannis, Embiid, Miles Bridges. This is a pretty interesting thread! I like seeing some of the lesser-known players that people like."
"Jokic, Randle, PG, Steph, Miles Bridges"
"Dammit, why us? Miles Bridges &amp; Gordon Hayward, plus maybe PJ Washington &amp; Devontae Graham are going to be out."
"Cheers bro, I hope you know the whole city of Detroit is rooting for Miles Bridges to kick serious ass in the playoffs"
Miles Bridges has been on an absolute tear during the recent games which has boosted their record without him.   Early in the season Melo was largely responsible for picking that team up and making them competitive.
Really want to see Miles Bridges try to dunk on Rudy
I want to see Miles Bridges get there
Graham and Hayward were seen as good teammates and people were really high on PJ Washington and Miles Bridges.

"As much as I don't like the Clippers bashing, it's insane how they drafted two players right before MPJ (Miles Bridges &amp; Jerome Robinson)   Obviously Bridges --&gt; Shai and Shai + others --&gt; PG13 so that isn't that bad, but just imagine they took MPJ with that second pick instead of *Jerome Robinson* (Though they did use him to get Marcus Morris Sr., but I'm sure they could've used another asset anyways)"

"I admittedly don't watch many Hornets games, but do I just happen to coincidentally look at the box score every time Miles Bridges has a big game or is he actually having a breakout season?  Feels like I see major highlights from him all the time too."
"I think your missing a bunch of players and you're criteria is off a bit. Its usually 3&amp;D wings that people are after - guard defence is much less important than wing defence. I definitely would not have pat connaughton, lonzo ball or fred van vleet, or ddv on this list unless you'd be happy sticking one of them on paul george for a qtr (i would not). You missed Miles Bridges who I think is useful, also Trevor Ariza. Porzingis and JJJ would also be included in your criteria, but again they are centers so i wouldnt put them in."
I mean I can think of two players just on the hornets that shoot 40% from 3 and are great defenders in miles bridges and pj Washington so idk how accurate his list actually is
"&gt;Team record very rarely matters for ROTY but Ball has just has just been too important to this Hornets team for it not to be a factor  They've stayed afloat without him though. PJ,Miles Bridges,Devonte is a solid supporting cast tbh."
Miles Bridges will be here soon
I love me some Brodie but Miles Bridges has been killing rims this year
If he has a nickname I won't be confusing him with Miles Bridges

Denver got lucky with MPJ. I wish the Knicks picked him or Miles Bridges.  Our previous FO decided to pick Knox solely because he won in a one-on-one game against Miles Bridges. Pathetic.
Malcolm Brogdon  Malik Beasley  Mikal Bridges  Miles Bridges  Marvin Bagley
"I started watching games again a couple of weeks ago, for the first time since 2012. The Bucks and 76ers have impressed me the most so far, but the teams that I have found most fun to watch have been Hornets, Heat, Clippers, Suns and Celtics. I'm also excited about seeing the Hawks with Trae Young when he gets back. The players who have impressed/surprised me the most so far are Jrue Holiday, Miles Bridges, Maxey, Rondo and Kemba Walker. I kinda want to pick a team as well, but I don't think I can tbh"
Or Mikal Bridges.  Or Miles Bridges.  Yeah.....
"Knox beat Miles Bridges badly in a predraft workout, so the FO fell in love with him."
The Lakers home announcers would've been hyped for the play. They enjoy themselves some good basketball regardless of whether it's the opponent team or the home team. (Although it's hard to top the hype level of Hornet's Eric Collins... that guy sounds like he's close to busting a few blood vessels in his forehead every time there's a vicious dunk... Miles Bridges must be costing him years off his life.)
"got a +10 spread for the Hornets in this game lmao, god bless Miles Bridges"
Miles bridges and Michael porter - both will probably be max contract players in the next couple of years
Edwards dunk on Watanabe is top 2 with Miles Bridges
"Who cares what OP's analysis is. Next line, he said ""A part of it has to be that he was promoted as a starter and whatever else it may be."" I'm commenting on KD's comments on Miles Bridges, in which KD was right."
"No one said KD's comments had anything to do with it. KD stated that player like Miles Bridges always wanted to get better and now that he has more shots and minutes, he's taking advantage of it, proving KD correct."

Miles Bridges leaping ability is insane
Miles Bridges is a fucking *beast*
"Am I crazy to think that he‚Äôs at the top of that list in terms of potential? Of players 23 and under, the only players I think I‚Äôd for sure take over Shai are Doncic, Zion, and Tatum.   I was so excited when the Hornets drafted him, and then found out it was part of a trade :(. Thank god Miles Bridges is such a fun player"
"I 100% agree. The rest of the field is far behind Randle, but I've been impressed by some players who are taking the leap like De'arron Fox, Jerami Grant, Michael Porter Jr., and even Miles Bridges as of late."
"Exactly, people always laugh at the Knicks for taking Knox. But in reality the more sensible move would‚Äôve been Mikal bridges or miles bridges."
"The team just has great chemistry. The swagger isn't just coming from Melo -- Miles Bridges has a whole rap career on the side with Rozier and the rest of the team making cameos in his videos, lol! These dudes have so much swag."
And dame is probably only the 3rd best rapper in the NBA  Miles Bridges &gt; Lonzo Ball &gt; Dame
"Yeah Bridges has pulled the best in the book and in the best possible ways, damn Miles."
"It's because you put the space before the period on #14 and have no space on #23 and #24, here's a fixed version   1. Luka Doncic  2. Trae Young  3. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  4. Michael Porter Jr  5.

I am loving that color and that court. Also Miles Bridges is putting up a highlight week.
"They were nice last year though, you could see the pieces coming together. PJ Washington is a great stretch 4. Miles Bridges is looking like Vince Carter. And Devonte made a huge jump as well."

"Kupchak is a fantastic drafter. He‚Äôs gone Julius Randle, dangelo Russell, Brandon Ingram, miles bridges, Devonte Graham, pj Washington and Lamelo in consecutive drafts"
"The silver lining to the huge amount of injuries is that Miles Bridges, PJ Washington, Rozier, and even Graham have stepped up and started to gel. We had 4 starters go for 20+ today.

Miles Bridges is the truth
I was slow to get on the Miles Bridges train but I'm in
Miles Bridges is sex.  I love this fucking team man.
Re-sign Lonzo and trade every other asset you have for Lamelo and Miles Bridges.   Throw lobs. Repeat.
"I have to admit, I can see it being considered top 4 all time in a decade, depending on how the guys develop, but there's a ton of talent. Besides Luka probably being a future MVP, this draft could overcome other top-heavy ones with it's depth. I think Ayton, Bagley, Luka, JJJ, Trae, Sexton, Shai, Mikal &amp; Miles Bridges, Michael Porter Jordan, DiVincenzo, Huerter, Shamet, Timelord, Gary Trent Jr., Shake Milton are the notable ones."
"because the chemistry between the two would be insane, pair that with lob threats like miles bridges and u got chino hills: nba edition"

MILES BRIDGES
miles bridges will be an all star in this league
Miles mf bridges. This guy is a stud.

"It's every other day on this sub, there has to be a highlight saying ""Miles Bridges throws it down on..."" or something along those lines"
Mi Mi Miles Bridges again!!!
Yo does Grayson think he Miles Bridges or something lol.
"You know I never thought I would see another half man, half amazing, but MILES BRIDGES is getting damn close"
"Coming into today Miles Bridges was 20th in the NBA with 66 dunks on 71 attempts. DJJ had 46 on 56 attempts. 4 minutes per game, but Bridges has 43% more dunks and half as many failed attempts."
"Thought the Knicks should have taken one of the Bridges, really thought Miles was the pick, or reached for a young high ceiling guy like Shai instead of Knox.  Miles has a highlight dunk every week."
I don‚Äôt watch a lot of hornets games is Miles Bridges actually good? I swear he has a highlight dunk every game
Is it time for me to invest in Miles Bridges stock? Is he good? Is he just another DJJ? Does he ever get nervous?
Last week I was watching and they were talking about the Miles Bridges dunk that had been on highlights everywhere for about five days and Shaq hadn‚Äôt seen or heard about it. He doesn‚Äôt even watch highlights.
"He was like a more talented version of Miles Bridges. He couldn‚Äôt shoot but he was nice and was a powerful dunker who could hit free throws. He had a few years where he was near the top of the league at getting to the line. It‚Äôs kinda a shame, the Clippers were such a joke back then and I think he did kinda prove he could play winning basketball during the 05-06 season.   He was a legitimate 2nd best player on a good team kinda player stuck perpetually on the worst rosters throughout his prime. His game was also very much reliant on his athleticism."
I sometimes got Maggette vibes from early career DeMar DeRozan but he's become more versatile over time. There isn't really a great present day comparison for him.   I'd love to see Miles Bridges adopt some of Maggette's offensive game. He gets to the line a weirdly low amount given how athletic and strong he is and he's also a damn good free throw shooter. He needs to seek out contact more.
"there might be a lot of new blood in the playoffs this year. 12 members of the Hornets were drafted (or went undrafted and picked up) by Charlotte since the last time we made the playoffs in 2016, and have never played anywhere else. We're not a lock for the playoffs now, but are a play-in team.  Malik Monk, Miles Bridges, Devonte' Graham, PJ Washington, Jalen McDaniels, Cody Martin, Caleb Martin, LaMelo Ball, Vernon Carey, Nick Richards, Grant Riller, and Nate Darling have never seen the NBA playoffs.  Hayward (Utah and Boston), Rozier (Boston), Wanamaker (Boston), Biyombo (Charlotte and Toronto), and Zeller (Charlotte) have been there before."
I still have a hard time remembering which team Mikal Bridges and Miles Bridges play on.
"it's same for us with american names, like miles and mikal bridges, michael porter jr, michael carter- williams etc etc"

Yeah I agree but this post is about miles bridges not mikal bridges
MILES BRIDGES CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF
Miles bridges is doing some nutty dunks haha
The depth of this draft can be ridiculous though as you have Luka n Trae with Ayton Shai JJJ MPJ WCJ Sexton Mikal&amp;Miles Bridges and the players that‚Äôll pop out in the future.
Keep in mind - they gave away Miles Bridges for....Zaire Smith....and drafted Fultz instead of Lonzo/Tatum/Fox
Miles bridges and it‚Äôs definitely a door lmao
I hear ya on that; I could see someone like a Bol Bol or Miles Bridges maybe.
That was so cool. Props to Miles Bridges
"Miles Bridges led them to the play in, he popped off with Hayward and Lamelo out."
lamelo‚Äôs co-stars for much of the first half of the season were miles bridges and bismack biyombo.   give lamelo d‚Äôlo and big kat and see if that team is drafting top 5 again.
"Aight, drop a diss track then.  Idk if Melo can rap but he sure has Haywizzle and Miles Bridges if he needs backup"
yeah but then LaMelo's going to throw and oop to Miles Bridges and Miles is going to dunk on Edwards like he did Capela
"DeAndre Ayton, Luka Doncic , Jaren Jackson Jr, Trae Young, Collin Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Miles Brides, Michael Porter Jr   Which one of these players is he better than?"
1. Luka 2. Trae 3. SGA 4. Ayton 5. Mikal 6. Sexton 7. MPJ  8. JJJ 9. Miles bridges 10. Jerome Robinson Etc  MPJ is the hardest one for me. He‚Äôs obviously got enormous offensive upside but (recency bias alert) he was abused soooo badly on defense by my suns. He was literally almost unplayable in a playoff series because of it. Not to mention he tweaked his back again at 22 years of age. Still a lot of questions with him.   Secondly I may be biased for mikal and his upside might be less than some of these guys but he already provides enormous value in playoffs. He would be a starter on most of the playoff teams left still at this point. Two way player who rarely makes mistakes while doing lots of things pretty well.
Vernon Carey jr. big strong guy who can shoot from range. Slightly more well known but I think miles bridges would be a strong bet to get one aswell
Miles bridges is on the hornets
"Which of the following players are you taking Bagley over?  Jaren Jackson, Wendell Carter, Collin Sexton, Kevin Knox, Mikal Bridges, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Miles Briges, Michael Porter JR"
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs the best lob threat ever let alone the best in the league currently. Having one of the best passers of all time that also demands significant defensive attention helps a lot there. Freak athletes like DJJ or Miles Bridges are better imo. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that big of a deal tho obviously he still scores inside at a good clip.       I also think you‚Äôre overrating his 3 point shooting a good amount. He‚Äôs a career 31% from deep and was down to 26% this year. He got very hot in the bubble and hasn‚Äôt shown he can sustain it since.
"2018 can be up there with any of them really. The depth of this class is just stupid.  Luka, Trae, Porter, SGA are stars for the next decade, health permitting.   Ayton, Sexton, JJJ, Mikal Bridges look like high level starters who can be ~3rd best players on a playoff team and should only continue to improve  Robert Williams, Time Lord, Miles Bridges, Trent, Miles Bridges, Graham look like 4th/5th best players on a playoff team  And then the long list of quality role players: Huerter, Brunson, Walker, Donte, Carter, Milton, Holiday, Allen, Brown, Shamet... I haven't given up on Bagley and Knox turning into good role players either, I think they could use a change of scenery."
Miles Bridges
Probably dame unless it was an abnormally stacked team. Like if you took off cj from the blazers and put ad there I‚Äôd consider that a normal level of talent for a title team.   If the team was abnormally talented elsewhere he could do it with Lavine probably. Something like Conley/Lavine/Miles Bridges/Ad/Turner with clarkson as a 6 man could get it done but that‚Äôs pushing what‚Äôs realistic.
"15-man roster:   **Guards:** Luka, Trae, SGA, Sexton, Brunson, Duncan Robinson, Trent Jr, Shamet.  **Forwards:** Mikal, MPJ, JJJ, Miles Bridges  **Centres:** Ayton, Mitch Robinson, Williams.   A lot of those guards can play the 3, so the rotation would look something like:   Trae, Luka, Mikal, MPJ, Ayton.   SGA, Sexton, Trent Jr, JJJ, Robinson.    Brunson, Robinson, Shamet, Miles, Williams."
"You could make nearly 10 NBA-viable teams out of that draft. Not necessarily in complete ranking order:  1. Trae, Luka, MPJ, JJJ, Ayton  2. SGA, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Bagley, WCJ  3. Brunson, Trent Jr, Huerter, Miles Bridges, Robinson  4. Graham, DiVincenzo, Huerter, Brown Jr, Williams  5. Nunn, Robinson, Shamet, Vanderbilt, Bamba 6. Melton, Walker, Okogie, Tate, Wagner 7. Simons, Milton, Allen, Diallo, Alize Johnson 8. Holiday, Carter, Troy Brown Jr, Svi, Eubanks 9. McLaughlin, Chiozza, Kenrich Williams, Gary Clark, Metu 10. Trier, Bates-Diop, Hutchison, Khyri Thomas, Watanabe  The last few aren't amazing, but there's some decent role-players in them, which is pretty great value considering that's 50 players listed there."
Trae/Luka/MPJ/Mikal/Ayton  SGA/Sexton/GTJ/Miles Bridges/Robert Williams  Could easily make the ECF
"Miles bridges, right?"
"Man, I just looked through the draft, it's crazy deep, too.   Devonte' Graham and Gary Trent Jr were second rounders. Miles Bridges, Divincenzo, Huerter, Lonnie Walker, Robert Williams.. the list goes on. There's probably nearly 30 guys that could legitimately have 10+ year careers assuming healthy. That's pretty wild."
"I definitely think so. A starting lineup of Luka with SGA, Mikal Bridges, JJJ and Ayton would be great defensively as well as offensively. Then have Trae Young lead the second unit with MPJ and Miles Bridges, Robinson etc... Absolutely stacked, I think that team easily makes it to conference finals. Starters and bench players can be switched depending on matchups and so forth"
"the Hornets traded SGA for Miles Bridges and a 2nd. SGA was picked 13 and Bridges was picked 14.  Bridges is not a bad player but SGA is only not a star because hes on a tanking team, dude is a star imo"
This is gonna be one of the few absurd money deals that‚Äôll probably look like a steal in a few years because the Hornets give 200 million to Miles Bridges or something
"So sick! Miles bridges, this is the example the world needs, THANK YOU! World needs people doing things for other people!"
"Everyone who loves their momma wishes they could do this. Big ups to my guy, Miles Bridges."
Miles Bridges
"To be fair Luka has GOAT potential, which automatically puts this class up a tier from a lot of other classes. Trae probably doesn't have top 10 potential but top 30 i think is where his ceiling could be. Ayton has work to do but his upside is right around where Trae's is. MPJ is below those two but will be a very very good player if he stays health. Then you consider depth and guys like SGA, JJJ, Sexton, Mikael and Miles Bridges who could all be all stars,  excellent role players like Rob Williams,  Jalen Brunson,  Devontae Graham, Mitchel Robinson, Gary Trent Jr., Anfrenee Simons, Donte Divencenzo, Landry Shamet, Lonnie Walker,Bruce Brown, Shake Milton it just goes on and on. All of these guys are either averaging double digit scoring, playing big minutes on a contender, or both.   They definately might have a case for best all time when its all said and done tbh"
"miles bridges, de'arron fox, dillon brooks"
Enjoy paying max money 2 DA (who you guys took over luka.. btw thank you for that) and miles bridges . Oh and also  paying a 45 year old point guard made of glass. But ur owner doesn‚Äôt have a history of being a cheap ass so I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs all going to work for you. I guess I‚Äôll just have to live with lebron and Anthony Davis‚Ä¶ how terrible
"I can‚Äôt name one, but I‚Äôve got a list: Clint Capela John Collins Goran Dragic Jusuf Nurkic Mikal Bridges Miles Bridges Garrison Matthews"
Bol Bol  Nah fr Miles Bridges
"2018 has just some solid ass players all around whether they in the playoffs or not right now:  Ayton, Doncic, Jackson Jr., Trae, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, SGA, Miles Bridges, MPJ, Divencenzo, Huerter, Lonnie Walker, Shamet, Gary Trent Jr., Anfernee Simons, Jalen Brunson, Grayson Allen. A lot of quality picks."
On my team - Rui  On another team - Probably Miles Bridges
"I have no idea if it‚Äôs realistic from either side, but I‚Äôd enjoy seeing Miles Bridges in Portland."
"SGA, Miles Bridges, and Sexton are all not in the playoffs..."
I mean im fine with Miles Bridges tbh. Hes gonna be a good starter for a long time.
Miles bridges is better than legit a third of the players mentioned here
"If we're mentioning SGA we should probably be mentioning Miles Bridges, just saying..."
"I‚Äôm gonna zag and say the other bridges, give me miles and his wonderful dunks"
Shai Mikal and MPJ are great players also in that lottery. Miles bridges looks a lot better too
Miles Bridges sends his regards.
"I would consider draft day trades like that, as being drafted by the team tht ultimately kept the player. We never say that Kevin Love was drafted by the Grizzlies or the Clippers drafted Miles Bridges.  I'd say Kuzma and THT are both Laker picks."
James Borrego is only 43 years old and is about the same height as Miles Bridges I think (6'6).  I thought maybe he'd be a decent option but then I looked up his college stats: https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/james-borrego-1.html  13 points and 17 rebounds.  Total.
the great part is it's basically all Miles Bridges with Malik Monk and Terry Rozier scattered in there.   PJ and Zeller can get mean occasionally but neither gets a lot of air.
Miles bridges üî•üî•
Hornets. Check out Miles Bridges you'll love him
Thank god Miles Bridges has the best hype man in the league. Eric Collins losing his shit at Bridges annihilating the rim makes the dunk that much more electric.
forgot that Miles and Mikal BRIDGES  have no relation with each other whatsoever
Prior to this year there was some discussion about who had more value: Miles or PJ Washington. Bridges' jump in production this year (especially once Hayward got hurt) seems to have ended that debate
"I think it would be crazy to see a world where it was volleyball taking the role of basketball.   Like if in all of history wherever there was basketball it was just volleyball instead. Same culture, same development, same talent pool, same profit margins.   I think it‚Äôs one of the few that matches up really closely in these parallels. And seeing someone like miles bridges or ja morant just sky into the air and try to spike a volleyball past gobert or ad. I think it would have potential"
Miles Bridges
"Agree with everything except JJJ. He wasn't a great player in college, Miles Bridges was the star on MSU and he was still clearly very raw. He had a skill set that was almost guaranteed to succeed in the NBA though and one of the highest ceilings to boot."
"That was a loaded draft: Sexton, SGA, Miles Bridges, Mikal Bridges  And then Jevon Carter, Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham ALL in the 2nd round"
"&gt; The 2018 draft just keeps on looking better and better. It was STACKED! Ayton, trae, luka, SGA, mikal and miles bridges, MPJ, JJJ, Sexton, jalen Brunson, Robert Williams, Gary Trent jr, even donte divencenzo and **Grayson Allen**."
"The 2018 draft just keeps on looking better and better. It was STACKED! Ayton, trae, luka, SGA, mikal and miles bridges, MPJ, JJJ, Sexton, jalen Brunson, Robert Williams, Gary Trent jr, even donte divencenzo and Grayson Allen.   Not to mention Marvin bagley!!! ‚Ä¶.poor kings"
Fuck you got me. Idk the bridges name lol like his game though. Miles is on Charlotte?  Edit: Mikal?
&gt;miles bridges  not knowing the player's names is exactly the type of familiarity with this team i would expect someone to have when they come in with this narrative lmao
"His eFg% went down, his scoring went down, his assists went down from last year. His minutes went up, so you‚Äôre telling me the key to making the suns better, was *less* Devin Booker? He‚Äôs the same player he‚Äôs always been with a little bit better shooting compared to his early years but worse off then last.  You can attribute the suns success this year to the growth of miles bridges on both ends, Chris Paul, and better coaching. Miss me with all of the excuses on why his team couldn‚Äôt win more than 25 games a year lol"
"As a casual, there's only two people I watch for, Curry and LeBron.   And LeBron was hurt all year, so Curry is MVP.  And LeBron is finals MVP.  Also about out Miles Bridges for his dunks."
1. Jimmer Fredette (hometown boy)  2. Kemba Walker  3. LaMelo Ball  4. Dirk Nowitzki   5. Kevin Love  6. Luka Doncic  7. Miles Bridges   8. Hakeem Olajuwon   9. Nikola Jokic    10. Devonte Graham
"Miles Bridges is one of the most explosive players ive seen. I think he probably is a perfect 6th man, but could definitely see him starting too"
&gt; Hornets went 23-42 last year  Without LaMelo Hornets still went 10-11.  They added Gordon Hayward this offseason. Miles Bridges and Jalen McDaniels both improved.  To act like he was playing with scrubs is simply wrong.
"MPJ, Miles or Mikal Bridges, Thybulle"
"My starting 5:  Giannis, Russ Westbrook, Zion, Jason Tatum, Miles Bridges"
miles bridges is gonna breakout into a star
"Dillon Brooks reminds me of Miles Bridges. Think it's crazy both guys were PF's in college and now are just 2 of the craziest 2 way, athletic SG/SFs in the league.   Btw, (Celtics fan here) can we get Jonas Valanciunas and SloMo? I've wanted him for a while, but after tonight's game, I'd settle for JJJ or Brandon Clarke."
Dillon Brooks and Miles Bridges are like the same exact guy.   Both played PF in college and now are a couple of the best young 2 way wings in the league
"you traded the pick that was sexton. you could've gotten mikael bridges, miles bridges, MPJ, or shai with that pick as well."
why? mikael bridges and miles bridges were also drafted right after. 4/6 the next picks after 8 were all great players. 2 potential superstars in shai and mpj and 2 above average starter caliber guys in both bridges. The top 15 of that draft had like 10 great players in it.  Thats just a bad take.
"Ok but signing a guy who‚Äôs not worth it gimps you cap space seriously and makes it impossible to improve the team. And you keep saying sexton but you didn‚Äôt have to draft sexton you could‚Äôve had SGA,mikael bridges,miles bridges, MPJ. 4/6 of the next picks after sexton all turned out to be fantastic player   So yeah trading for kyrie turned out to be a huge mistake. Not saying it wasn‚Äôt worth the shot but kyrie leaving absolutely fucked you guys and ended and title chances you guys have for the next few years"

fun squad good hustle   shout out miles bridges! def the best dunker of the year!
Man shoutout Miles Bridges.
Miles bridges' reaction every time Indiana score hahahahaha
Miles bridges is not good lol
"Miles Bridges has at least 2-3 freakishly high-jumping highlights per game, and he's already got like 5 today lol"
Miles Bridges is unbelievable. He's gonna be the glue guy on a Finals team one day
Miles bridges god damn
That was insane lol Miles Bridges is a freak
Yea no bro then why was miles bridges out for the same reason which isn‚Äôt the sole reason but also contributed to the hornets Losing down the stretch
It was humbling to say the least lmao  Then 3 years later my little brother had to deal with Miles Bridges in the exact same tournament. Same teams in the same tournament.
Surprised miles bridges and lamelo didn't make it to  the oops I dunked again awarf

watch Hornets games Lemelo throws amazing passes every game and you'll get at least one Miles above the rim Bridges dunk.  The highlights are everywhere still I would argue even more.
"Miles Bridges played the 4 all season, so he's a credit to the Hornets bigs instead of their Wing rotation. meanwhile, McDaniels DID play the 3, so he was a credit to the wing rotation, which you did not note."
i hate watching your team only because i'm reminded we took knox over miles bridges every time other than that you guys are (were? haven't tuned in in a while) really fun to watch too
Oh damn that‚Äôs a miles bridges yam
I‚Äôm pretty sure that both Mika and Miles Bridges are going to be all-stars at some point in their careers.
Miles Bridges didn't beat us. He clearly knew how to beat them!
"We really picked Kevin Knox before Mikal Bridges, SGA, Miles Bridges and MPJ..."
Miles Bridges is just Hulk

MILES BRIDGES
miles bridges baby!
"Aside from the obvious 23‚Ä¶  0 gives you Lillard/DiVincenzo/Miles Bridges/Tatum/Love. D‚Äôlo is also there but that defence is already pretty rough so I‚Äôd have him off the bench to slaughter worse lineups with DiVincenzo starting.  00 could give you Lonnie Walker/Devin Booker/Anthony Edwards/Zion. Centre sucks, it‚Äôd be Mike Scott by default but Zion might actually be the best option there, but you‚Äôve got guys like Malik Monk and TJ Warren and Bruce Brown to fill in the gaps."

Miles Bridges
"Miles Bridges.  He was beasting and feasting at the end of the season when guys were injured. I expect him to do the same when the whole team is healthy.  Call me crazy, but I think the Hornets can be next year's Knicks or Hawks, at least I'm terms of regular season success"
miles bridges  not the same but fultz or isaac will be comeback player of the year in our hearts
players not drafted here that should be in over some of these players  SGA  Sabonis   Christian wood  Vucevic  Miles Bridges  Kevin Love  Collin Sexton  lemelo
Miles Bridges
Who's better - Mikal Bridges or Miles BridgeS?????!?
Miles Bridges had 27 points on 15 shots   Khris ''Glorified Jr smith'' Smith and Cancun Holiday had 28 points on 37 shots
You have to know about the teams before you can talk about them. Heads just figured out we have Ayton and still think our Bridges is Miles‚Ä¶.
Is this when Miles Bridges is supposed to tweet [yawn emojis](https://twitter.com/Dloading/status/1373801200819306497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and some stupid bullshit?  [Also relevant.](https://twitter.com/DWolfsonKSTP/status/1412887039859691526?s=20)
The rim protection of ayton and miles bridges also
i wish Miles Bridges was in the finals
"Mikal ""I'm not related to Miles Bridges"" Bridges"
"&gt; in 2019 they also had Cam Johnson, Herro, and Coby White.  I said Cam Johnson already, Herro and White didn't clear the cutoff that you made.    &gt;2018 also had Miles Bridges and Doncic wasnt a good shooter by any means but was more polished in that department than a lot of guys in this class.  I said Miles Bridges already, Luka shot 28% and 33% in the two years before he got drafted, with the 28% coming the year of the draft.  &gt;compared to classes like 2016 and 2017  2017: Fultz, Ball, Jackson(low volume), Markkanen, Smith Jr., Monk, Kennard  2016: Ingram, Dunn, Hield, Murray, Prince  Those classes still only had 5-6 proven shooters."
"&gt;there are usually more than 4 solid three point shooters in the lottery lol.  Well, there are 5 this year. Let's check the past few drafts.   2020: Toppin(low volume), Smith(low volume), Vassell, Haliburton, Lewis, Nesmith.  2019: Morant, Hunter(low volume), Garland, Johnson, Washington(low volume)  2018: Young, JJJ(low volume), Bagley(low volume), WCJ(low volume), SGA(low volume), Mikal Bridges, Miles Bridges, Robinson  There are usually about 3-4 actual proven shooters in the lottery of each class, not counting guys with solid percentages that only have like 2 attempts per game.   ------------  &gt;and no chance in hell those guys guard 3 positions at an average level.  Name which one of them couldn't guard 3 or more(not counting McBride who I already said)."
"Defense is a good argument for one. Hard to win with 3 negative defensive players out there. Who‚Äôs guarding KD, Steph, and Klay? You have to put Trae on one of them.  Going 10 deep doesn‚Äôt mean much in the playoffs. And it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre going 10 deep with all-stars. Miles Bridges and Divincenzo are solid role players but right not that‚Äôs it. Maybe five 20PPG individually but certainly not collectively, same goes for 9 APG."
They barely beat the 2017 team in 7.  1. PG - De‚ÄôAaron Fox vs. Trae Young 2. SG - Donovan Mitchell vs. Shai Gilgeous Alexander 3. SF - Jayson Tatum vs.  Luka Doncic 4. PF - John Collins vs. Michael Porter Jr 5. C - Bam Adebayo vs De‚ÄôAndre Ayton 6.  Lonzo Ball vs Devonte Graham 7. Markelle Fultz vs. Collin Sexton 8. O.G. Anunoby vs. Mikal Bridges 9. Jonathan Issac vs Jaren Jackson Jr 10. Jarrett Allen vs Mitchell Robinson 11. Monte Morris vs. Jalen Brunson 12. Derrick White vs Kevin Huerter or Donte DiVincenzo 13. Josh Hart or Kyle Kuzma vs Miles Bridges 14. Lauri Markannen vs Robert Williams 15. Thomas Bryant vs Wendell Carter Jr

"We had the choice of Michael Porter, Mikal Bridges, Shai, Miles Bridges, and Kevin Knox. And we chose Kevin fucking Knox. A full time bench warmer by his 3rd season. This draft will haunt me forever."

Miles Bridges is better
MJax just call Mikal Bridges ‚ÄúMiles Bridges‚Äù or am I trippin?
Dude really just said Miles bridges‚Ä¶
When did miles bridges join these teams mark?
"Yeah he was injured this past season but he‚Äôs definitely solid and has great potential.  Right now he‚Äôs on the tier below luka and trae.. Ayton may be on their tier now but below those three it‚Äôs a toss up between SGA, JJJ, &amp; Michael Porter Jr.    Honestly 2018 was a nice class with Huerter, mikal bridges, miles bridges, and several other solid players later in round 1 &amp; even 2"
Patrick Williams and Miles Bridges üëÄ
Ayton/JJJ/MPJ/Shai/Luka  Off the bench: Timelord/Miles Bridges/Mikal Bridges/Sexton/Trae  This would be one of the greatest teams ever before these guys are in their primes
"Nader has the nastiest dunks, he‚Äôs like a discount Miles Bridges"
"[https://twitter.com/NateDuncanNBA/status/1362980387245334534](https://twitter.com/NateDuncanNBA/status/1362980387245334534)  That was his tweet, look at the time and manner he posted it.   Furthermore in the replies, even other NBA media people were giving him a hard time about it.  Its perfectly legit to criticize a players performance, but to do it right after everyone is appreciating an amazing dunk.  That's like watching derrick jones jr or Miles bridges pull of an insane dunk in the game only to choose that moment to point out their underwhelming season  or game stats."
"Doncic, Trae Young, Ayton, Mikal Bridges, JJJ, SGA, Miles Bridges, MPJ, Donte, Huerter, Lonnie Walker, Jalen Brunson, Shake Milton,... 2018 was the year the NBA gods smiled upon Draft Day. At this rate it will be one of the all time great draft years littered with MVP's, All-Stars, 6MOY's, DPOY,..."
They're good players but they aren't stars. Is Terry Rozier a star? Is Jae Crowder or Miles Bridges stars? Nah it doesn't matter what you're role is. You gotta be a top player to be a star and neither of them are stars.
"Now that the evidence is overwhelming that Bridges plays best at the 4, its really going to make us be forced to choose between PJ and Miles."
"Jordan Clarkson won 6MOY, Miles Bridges had a breakout year, Lonzo had a career year, Anthony Edwards proved to be pretty good, THT is likely to get paid by somebody, Garland had an impressive second year, Draymond at least had a bounce back year.  And don't forget about MAXEY!"
"I did. Which really adds to the point I was trying to make.  David West had a really good career. Was a 2x All Star and a big part of some of the most successful teams in New Orleans Pelicans (then Hornets) history, then was a big part of a couple runs to the ECF with Indiana, and then as an old guy still was able to contribute off the bench to two titles with GSW.  No one can guarantee me that any one of JJJ, Mikal and Miles Bridges, Robert Williams, Gary Trent JR, Shake Milton, Landry Shamet will have a better career than David West, yet he never comes up when discussing 2003, to the point that I literally forgot to mention him."
"It‚Äôs too early but it‚Äôs not crazy to think 2018 can be that caliber.  It‚Äôs not just Luka Trae Ayton it‚Äôs MPJ, JJJ, SGA, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Miles Bridges, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent, Robert Williams Kevin Huerter, even Bagley will probably still be very good. There‚Äôs also a lot of great role players as well throughout the draft that will likely have long careers.  Way too early to be comparing them to the all time great classes but they have an argument that they are on track to be in that convo"
"2018 has SGA as well  they also have a lot of depth pieces in JJJ, Mikal and Miles Bridges, Robert Williams, Gary Trent JR, Shake Milton, Landry Shamet"
"It‚Äôs insanely good. You have two superstars in Trae and Luka. Ayton right now I think is a star. There are potential/near stars in JJJ, MPJ, SGA, and Mikal Bridges (imo, though maybe a solid starter). Solid starters include Miles Bridges, Sexton, WCJ, and Huerter.   This is where it gets tricky, but the guys somewhere between solid starter and really good role player are bountiful, and a lot came in the second round: Gary Trent Jr, Mitchell Robinson, Devonte Graham, DiVincenzo, Bagley, Shamet, Lonnie Walker, Bruce Brown, Jalen Brunson, Robert Williams, and Shake Milton.  I‚Äôm probably leaving out a few guys, which is a testament to how good a draft class it is. We need more time to see longevity and how many stars arise to truly rate it though."
"2 future hofers in luka and trae already   SGA, Ayton, JJJ, Sexton, MPJ all look like future all stars  Mikal Bridges might be on a couple all defense teams   few more servicible role players too like Miles Bridges, Walker, Divincenzo, Huerter, Shamet, Milton"
Miles Bridges and Cam Johnson
Miles Bridges should‚Äôve gotten more than just two third place MIP votes in my opinion. He didn‚Äôt have the counting stats jump that most MIP candidates have but he went from a pretty inefficient player to damn near 50/40/90
Miles Bridges closed the season really strong and was a little lost in the Lamelo hype. Those two should be foundational pieces for Charlotte for many years.
Miles Bridges deserves to be on this bench
If Miles Bridges was on the Clippers he'd be getting three free throws.
Miles Bridges looking like a coach.
"If the hornets got #1 and took Cade, they could be loaded. I‚Äôd try and swap Hayward for Myles Turner + a pick. Then I‚Äôd try to swap Rozier and Biyombo for Tobias.   LaMelo/Cade/Miles Bridges/Tobias/Myles Turner would be nuts with Graham, Monk, PJ, Zeller, and the Martins off the bench"
Y‚Äôall took miles bridges over michael porter jr ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£. Miles is the definition of a bum.
"Doesn't this mean Miles Bridges gets a share, after becoming Capela's father earlier this season?"
Yeah.  Can you think of trade packages for these teams though??  I've thought about them already..   OKC - Miles Bridges/Monk/potential other assets + picks   Orlando Magic - I honestly have no fucking idea what I would want besides like Ross and an infinite amount of picks hahaha  Cavs - maybe a trade packages of Ben for sexton/assets/picks  Portland -ideally would give them every player besides Joel Maxey and thybulle and like 70% of our picks for Dame....  For McCollum would rather trade like Tobi... dont even know who would have more value since tobi is an above average defender...  Washington.... same offer as Dame tbh pretty much...  Sacramento - maybe Ben for Buddy/Assets (young players and picks)  Indians - Ben for Brogson and other assets. Maybe Lamb or LeVert and picks.   Any changes or opinions on my opinions regarding trading Ben to these teams?
"Doing it by year:   2016: no one 2017: Donovan Mitchell 2018: SGA, Miles or Mikal Bridges, MPJ and 2nd round Mitch Rob or Gary Trent Jr 2019: RJ Barrett 2020: Tyrese Haliburton, Quickley"
"Miles Bridges was in it from 5/2 to 5/14, completely punting our play-in seeding  just like CP3, it wasn't clear whether he actually tested positive and was asymptomatic or if he had simply been exposed to it."
Miles bridges might have a thing to say about that
"obviously due to the emergence of miles bridges and pj washington, hayward has once again found himself in a tough spot through an injury be interesting to see who bites because unlike kemba i think hayward still has some value"
An Miles Bridges.  Simmons/Thybulle/Bridges/Tatum/Embiid is the best defense
"""They are injured!"" -Miles Bridges probably"
"I appreciate you showing the respect owed to Gordon Hayward, Miles Bridges and Terry Rozier.   They‚Äôre definitely as good as KAT, DLo, and Beasley but I respect a T Wolves fan for saying it"

Miles Bridges on cling capela
Miles Bridges and Lonnie Walker
Gatland obi toppin all three ball brothers will improve miles Bridges. I think this year Zion and Ingram will both carry the peels to a first round exit but Zion is gonna put up record breaking numbers again this year. Also kinda hope ja and trae back up their playoff promise
find miles bridges reaction on each basket
"Just wanna register my opinion that the Bulls and Hornets will be playing playoff basketball this year, and making runs. Imma link back to this in 10 months or whatever. Miles Bridges bout to breakout"
"PJ Washington/Draymond Green/Miles Bridges/Terry Rozier/LaMelo Ball would actually be a really cool small ball starting five. If Rozier or Ball learned to defend, the switchability of that unit would be interesting.   Sub Rozier for Oubre for defense and everyone in that lineup is 6'7 except for Bridges (6'6), and you'd have 3 guys with 7'2+ wingspans.   Now I want to see that, Philly should trade us Simmons"
"The sticker price looks big but then considering it doesn‚Äôt kick in until next year it isn‚Äôt that much more than other solid starting 2 guards like Gary Trent Jr, Evan Fournier, Bogdan Bogdanvich, etc have gotten recently.   Terry was our best clutch shooter (well him and Devonte) so I‚Äôm ok with it. We weren‚Äôt going to have max cap space next year anyways since we need to sign Miles Bridges to an extension too."
2016: Pascal Siakam (wound up trading 22nd pick for Marco Belinelli- Siakam picked 27th)   2017: Donovan Mitchell (picked Monk at #11)     2018: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (actually picked him at #11 but swapped for Miles Bridges for a 2nd) / Mitchell Robinson in the 2nd (we got Devonte' and it was a great pick but Mitchell Robinson works better with the new team)       2019: PJ Washington at #12 (did well here) 2020: LaMelo Ball at #3 (no complaints in hindsight)  Would've been:  Ball/Mitchell/SGA/Siakam/Robinson with PJ Washington off the bench
"He's earned it.  I don't think it's much if an overpay especially with where the guard market could develop over the next few years.  My hope is that we are going to be able to extend Miles Bridges too, but he may be betting on himself this season."
"I‚Äôm a totally cool with Ben Simmons coming to CHA, assuming we can guarantee this:  1.	He‚Äôs willing to play the 4  2.	He wants to play in Charlotte, or at least is willing to give it a chance 3.	We don‚Äôt give up both PJ and Miles  4.	Our salary cap situation supports resigning the big rookies   My ideal trade is something like Hayward, PJ/Bridges and a first. I don‚Äôt love the idea of trading Hayward (because he‚Äôs one of the few players who chose to play in Charlotte and trading him sends a message to future FAs), but the trade doesn‚Äôt work without him. In fact, the only trades that work either include Hayward or Terry + Plumlee, and I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre willing to trade the only vet center we have on the roster.   All things considered, I don‚Äôt mind shooting for the stars as a small market team. We have to take our shot at some point and I think trading for an all star entering his prime is a good shot to take. Obviously he has his concerns, but if he can develop his finishing into Giannis-lite then I really think he can be a long term solution at the 4 or 5.  Worst case scenario, it‚Äôs a Nic Batum situation and we‚Äôre done paying him right as LaMelo is entering his prime and coming near the end of his first max contract. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a huge risk, again assuming we don‚Äôt give up too many future assets."
"They've been one of the smarter organizations in the league for about four years now, it's hard to name all the good moves.  They flipped Shai for Miles Bridges and a couple picks.  They got Gordon Hayward on a bargain contract, then flipped Kemba for draft picks and Terry Rozier (who's averaging 20ppg on high efficiency).   Even this year Bouknight and Jones both looked good in summer league and seem perfect for the run-and-gun style they like with Hayward and Lamelo as ball handlers, and I really like the Kelly Oubre signing for them too."
"Everytime I watched a Hornets game I hear that one announcer scream ""MILES BRIDGES"" after he fucking detonates on some poor center who decided to play defense."

"Miles Bridges. He was our best player in the latter half of the season. Does a bit of everything. High flyer, 50/40/87%, great chemistry with LaMelo."
"Miles Bridges. He has the ideal basketball body and crazy athleticism, solid jumpshot, and guards 1-4. His biggest weakness is the ability to create off the dribble and he saw significant improvement with that last season. If he improves on just one or two areas of his game he‚Äôll have the skill set of a superstar and he‚Äôs only 23."
Miles Bridges
"Immanuel Quickley, Jaxson Hayes, Miles Bridges"
Miles Bridges
"Miles ‚ÄúBRIDGESSSSS‚Äù Bridges. I‚Äôve thought he was gonna be amazing since Mich St days and now that he has a point guard like lamelo it seems he‚Äôs on the right path to dominating. When lamelo was out he showed he can play point forward a tiny bit improved ball handling and shooting off the dribble obviously an explosive athlete also, and I expect him to be even better this year too. Want this dude to succeed"
Miles Bridges is going to be HUGE imo
"I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a reach to say it, but I believe that Miles Bridges will be something someday. Not a superstar but multiple time all star"
Miles Bridges. His improvement year on year has been stunning. guy was just an athlete in year 1 who was a mediocre dribbler. Now he is a hyperathletic playmaking small ball 4. He reminds me of Blake Griffin and would not shock me if he a blow up this season with a more developed Lamelo getting him easier looks
"Fox, Miles Bridges, Saddiq Bey, Hunter, Precious, Myles Turner"
Let‚Äôs be real guys. It‚Äôs Miles Bridges!

Miles Bridges?
"And more‚Ä¶.  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  ‚Ä¢ Latest free agency and trade news and buzz ‚Ä¢ Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move ‚Ä¢ Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this ‚Ä¢ NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next ‚Ä¢ Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough.

He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
Miles Bridges is pretty good defensively at PF for someone who‚Äôs 6‚Äô6
"Miles Bridges could take off as a slashing option alongside Lamelo.   Didn‚Äôt see many of their full games, but he‚Äôs a walking highlight reel"
Naz Reid for Miles Bridges 1 4 1 baby
"Len, TT, or Queta/Jones should fill that backup C spot. They grabbed Harkless who was serviceable in the backup SF role at the end of last year.  The missing piece seems to be a solid starting SF/PF  which it looks like they're trying to trade for. Personally hoping they could grab Miles Bridges, PJ Washington, or Jerami Grant, but they would all come at a pretty high price"
Agreed - he and Miles Bridges are my favorite non-Kings players in the league.
I'd go with Miles Bridges for his power jams and Lavine for his effortless and instantaneous take offs. But I gotta put my guy Ant for honorable mention. https://youtu.be/1jpxdQ0cWYg  Don't know how atheist any of them are though
Miles Bridges
"In terms of in-game dunkers, I'm always fond of guys who aren't afraid to push the boundaries, put on a show, and hurt the rim. There's a lot of athletic freaks out there who just don't seem motivated to do anything special (tough to fault from a game perspective) but among the dudes I think are doing it right at the moment:   [Ja Morant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeBRMSwc8VY&amp;ab_channel=MemphisGrizzlies): He could be a super athletic basic dunker if he wanted but his willingness to do things like [add a two-hand windmill to a mid-game lob toss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrSq-z8TRyk&amp;ab_channel=HouseofHighlights) is what makes him a special dunker to me.   [Miles Bridges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clPeyxb8SVs&amp;ab_channel=NBA): Would make Kenyon Martin Sr. proud, and probably a bit jealous.   [Donovan Mitchell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt6-GUJ0hJ4&amp;ab_channel=NBArtv): Some of the best tomahawks in the league.   [Derrick Jones Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E72NkHc-gSU&amp;ab_channel=SPProductions): Lost track of him this year and I didn't watch the full highlight clip but based on what I saw from him in Miami, I imagine he's still mostly worthy (I know there was an injury or two in there that may have had an effect).   [John Collins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_H3hnqd9_E&amp;ab_channel=RookieProductions): Might be my favorite big man dunker at the moment."

"Bullshit. Kevin is 80% draft analyst and only like 20% reporter. He'll chime in occasionally on news. Though mostly he does film studies and draft guides. He has a great interview with Miles Bridges where they break down how he improved.    Find some tweets of his that proves he's always wrong and should be banned. He's not nearly in the class of guys like Stephen A, he's one of the few media members that watches games and breaks them down."
Somewhere Miles Bridges felt a disturbance in the force
"Ball/Rozier/Hayward/Bridges/Plumlee   Smith/Bouknight/Oubre/Washington/Jones  In theory, PJ could start, he's the better fit next to Plumlee but Miles is a much better talent, I think he starts"
"King Kai seems to be the frontrunner in our sub right now. A lot of people already call Miles Bridges ‚ÄúSky Miles‚Äù, so Sky Jones would unfortunately be a bit duplicative."
Miles Bridges and this guy on the same squad? Put em in primetime baby
"Smoove and Crash were both so hype back in the day. I feel like we're missing a player like that nowadays, who's even close? Miles Bridges or Aaron Gordon are closest I guess, but they're not nearly the defenders those 2 were."
i wanna say miles bridges but i dont know if hes going to have enough opportunity to up his scoring load enough.  ill say derrick white.  dudes way better than his career stats and i think with a full season under him and the spurs going full young hes going to get a lot of opportunity.  20/5/5 coming from him.
Miles Bridges
I‚Äôm too lazy to post but the greatest dunks of all time is either the Blake Griffin on Steven Adam‚Äôs where he stiff arms him or the one miles bridges dunk where the commentator shit his pants.
"Good god what a spike. I remember watching my boy Clint eat this one. Nothing but love to Miles Bridges, that‚Äôs really really my guy."
"Yeah but Bridges is more of a 4 anyways. If Hayward got hurt Kelly would probably start at the 3 with Miles at the 4, and either PJ at the 5 or off the bench"
Miles Bridges over Clint Capela is the greatest dunk in nba history.
"Miles Bridges, he is going be all NBA first team because of reasons....those reasons being blind hope and contract year."

You forgot Miles Bridges
"Welp looks like our lineup is all but set for next season  PG: Ball, Smith  SG: Rozier, Bouknight  SF: Hayward, Oubre  PF: Washington, Bridges  C: Plumlee, ?????    ---  It's definitely a worse team than last season. The only way I see us finishing top 8 (or injuries go our 6) is that a combination of some (not neccessary all) of these things to happen   -  LaMelo takes an absurd leap in his scoring ability. Like as a guy that can get 20-23 a night I guess. I don't expect that in his sophomore year though that's a difficult ask so I won't be upset if he doesn't   - JB somehow turns this on-paper bottom 10 defense to a top half defense   - One of Miles/PJ takes a leap to a borderline all-star level talent   - Hayward doesn't miss 40% of the season    ----   Ultimately I think we are on a crash course to a solid 10 seed. I don't like giving Oubre a multi-year deal.   What are the ramifications of this deal on us giving Miles and PJ extensions next offseason?"
"Between LaMelo, Miles Bridges, and Oubre we are going to see so many alley oops and crazy dunks. Hornets are going to be must watch TV."
"PJ Washington was our best defensive center last year by a wide margin (it wasn‚Äôt a super hard competition though). He‚Äôs built like Draymond Green. He‚Äôs 6‚Äô8‚Äù with a 7‚Äô2‚Äù+ wingspan. He‚Äôs got a taller standing reach and longer wingspan than Cody Zeller, Draymond Green, and PJ Tucker.   As for Miles Bridges, he is better as a 4, but can play pretty well as a 3. That means a lineup of Bridges (SF), Markkanen (PF), and Washington (C) could theoretically work for short bursts."
"It all depends cause the Hornets didn't have a capable center. Washington and Bridges optimal roles are yet up in the air and PJ can play 4/5 and Miles 3/4. I guess with Hayward being their main wing guy they would prefer to play Hayward, Bridges and Washington together."

"&gt;believe that the draft does not have to be nearly as hard as many teams will make it. I‚Äôm not interested in what the mocks say about where a guy should go. Five years will pass and when we look back at this 2018 draft, we‚Äôll see a long line of players who fail to have real careers in the NBA. In the moment, the selections will not seem ludicrous because the mocks have brainwashed us to believe that the best prospects are listed in the correct range and order. So when I hear people say, ‚ÄúThat is too high [or too low] to take [Player A],‚Äù I immediately cringe. Too high or too low according to what?  &gt;I care about one thing when it comes to the draft: getting a player who does not suck. Some of these guys will be stars, some might end up just being role players, but I am 100 percent confident none of them will fail. Enough with the small talk. Time to put my money where my mouth is. Vernodamus is here to save the day. These players will not suck (and if they do, I will absolutely blame the situation and the coaching):   * **Marvin Bagley III**   &gt;I seriously wonder if I have different eyeballs than everyone else. There is a 0 percent chance that Bagley is not awesome in the NBA. I‚Äôm not sure that he has ever played in a game in his life where he was not the best player on the floor. Coach K said the following regarding Bagley: ‚ÄúHe is not a good runner; he‚Äôs an amazing runner. And then he‚Äôs an amazing repeated jumper. In other words, he doesn‚Äôt really take time to even land, he just pops right back up. He wants to learn, he has no demons, he‚Äôs a great kid, he‚Äôs smart, and has an incredible motor. He never has a bad day. He‚Äôs a treasure, really. He‚Äôs going to be one of the great players in the NBA during his time.‚Äù Coach K also said that in his 38 years at Duke he has had only one other player like him: Kyrie Irving. I honestly have no idea how he is not the consensus first pick in the draft.  * **Luka Doncic**  &gt;I have expressed my worry that Doncic might not have the athleticism it takes to be a massive star in the NBA. That being said, he is smart, he plays hard, and he can dribble, pass, and shoot. I‚Äôm positive he is not going to be a failure. He is too good at basketball to fail. He also has a massive tiger tattoo on his forearm, which is a big plus. More than anything, I have warmed up to him more and more since the word that NBA teams have cooled on him, because that means he is probably amazing.  * **Wendell Carter Jr.**  &gt;This is a little reminiscent of when Al Horford and Joakim Noah were in the same draft in 2007. I loved both of them and thought there was no chance that either of them would fail. It was just a matter of how good they were going to be. Bagley is the best prospect in the draft in my opinion, but Carter is also a beast. His fundamentals are ridiculous, he is huge and has a massive wingspan‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand his shot looks as good as any player‚Äôs in the draft. A smart big that can run the floor, plays hard, and can shoot 3s? Those guys don‚Äôt fail.  * **Collin Sexton**  &gt;I love Sexton. He is smart, he is lightning fast, and he plays every game like it is his last game on earth. An absolute fighter who routinely plays his best against the best competition. You need guys like Sexton in the NBA playoffs. I think his ceiling is much higher than most people seem to think, and I know, no matter what, I will love having this guy on my team.  * **Miles Bridges**  &gt;He can dribble, pass, and shoot. He is a freak athlete. He is a smart kid that comes off great in all of his interviews. He is tough as nails. You can have the guys that you think are going to be good, and I‚Äôll take the one that I know will be. Miles Bridges is a perfect example of why teams and analysts miss in the NBA draft. He will absolutely be better than many players taken in front of him and you can see it from a mile away.  * **Jacob Evans**  &gt;Cincinnati won a school-record 31 games, and Evans was the best prospect on the team. His sophomore season he was a finalist for the Jerry West Award, which goes to the best shooting guard in the country, and his junior year he was a finalist for the Julius Erving Award, which goes to the best small forward in the country. Cincy coach Mick Cronin had this to say about him: ‚ÄúHe is a winner. He shoots a high percentage. He‚Äôs an elite defender. He blocks shots. He guards point guards. He rebounds. He just does so many things, and he‚Äôs a coach on the floor. He‚Äôs such a smart player.‚Äù Umm, sold.  * **Donte DiVincenzo**  &gt;At one point during this draft process, someone asked me, ‚ÄúIf we saw DiVincenzo drop 31 in the title game, be great all season, and test physically off the charts, then why in the hell is he supposed to go late first round?‚Äù Great question, anonymous guy! The answer is because that is where the mock draft consensus has him slotted, and the mock draft consensus is dumb. He‚Äôs a big-time competitor, super athlete, can shoot the cover off the ball, and in the biggest game of the season, he looked like the best player on maybe the best college team I have ever seen.  * **Rawle Alkins**  &gt;Brooklyn in the house! Alkins was a high school force of nature who won three city titles and two state championships in New York. He had a foot issue that hampered his career at Arizona, but this kid has so many attributes that I love. Unstoppable motor, built like a linebacker, good-looking shot, and do-or-die playing style. He has been projected too low since this process started. Alkins will be a fan favorite wherever he plays. You want a Marcus Smart, Tony Allen, or P.J. Tucker‚Äìtype player when you need a big play in a big game. I see that with Alkins.  * **Jevon Carter**  &gt;You do not want to be guarded by Jevon Carter. Bob Huggins called him ‚Äúthe best defensive player I have ever coached.‚Äù Whoa. Carter reminds me of the kind of guy who is playing in the park where the winner stays on the court, and you could leave for six hours and come back and his team would still be playing. He was conference defensive player of the year twice, and national defensive player of the year last year. He affects every game that he plays in. Bona fide bulldog. Every roster in the NBA could use a guy like him."
"Not totally related, but I mixed up Mikal Bridges and Miles Bridges for the longest time because they were in the same draft"
Trae - Luka - Mikal Bridges - Jaren Jackson Jr - Ayton  Sexton - SGA - MPJ - Miles Bridges - Mitchell Robinson  These two 5s are from the 2018 draft. So many great players and none of them have hit their prime yet. Imo it will go down as one of the best ever.
"That Nash trade sucked for us. The pick you're talking about eventually conveyed to the Sixers and was traded to the Suns who drafted Mikal Bridges. I believe we would have had a shot at drafting either Bridges (Mikal/Miles), MPJ, or SGA if we would have had the pick. Really hurt us."
"I think we‚Äôll be fine. Hayward is a great passer. Miles Bridges flashed some pretty good playmaking skills last season. Plumlee has always been a pretty good secondary ball mover. Bouknight should at least be able to create for himself. We‚Äôre also rumored to want re-sign Riller to a minimum contract.   Worst comes to worst, we just run like crazy in transition. LaMelo, Bridges, Lonzo, Bouknight, Rozier, and Kai should all be killer in transition."
"Miles is a very good player and a good defender, but I still think he‚Äôs a tier below Hunter. It‚Äôs a stretch to say he can‚Äôt touch him though. Hunter improved drastically this season in every metric, and developed a knockdown mid-range game. Bridges has good efficiency stats, but that‚Äôs because most of his threes come from off the catch and shoot. He can create his own shot a little bit but I haven‚Äôt seen it enough to say he can do it consistently. What separates them for me is that Hunter can create his own shot consistently and then play elite defense"
Miles Bridges and PJ can‚Äôt touch Hunter. They are on the same level of Huerter and Okongwu I‚Äôd say
"&gt;already having 1 player makes us better than most teams  Yeah I totally agree, I guess I kind of misinterpreted the point that OP was trying to make. Trae is the distinguishing factor, watching the Hawks' playoff run made that pretty clear. You can't consider your young core on par with theirs until you have a superstar at that level.  That being said, I think the rest of the young talent on the Hornets is at least comparable to the Hawks. Miles Bridges/PJ Washington are similar tier prospects to DeAndre Hunter/Cam Reddish, John Collins is a tier above right now but tbh I have faith that Miles can reach that level of production next season. Possible we lose one of them this summer but Devonte Graham/Malik Monk is a similar level to Kevin Huerter. We're kind of just banking on LaMelo having Trae Young-type progression through his 2nd/3rd season to try and be as competitive as they were but obviously there's no guarantee in that happening."
"If the deal isn't good enough for sactown you add more assets. They were trying to trade barnes at the deadline, it's not gonna take a kings ransom. How is hield not a win? He's not a star I understand, but a quality roleplayer. If klay's athleticism takes a step back, you can start klay at the 3 and buddy at the 2. And barnes is a good enough approximation of wiggins. You go from 1 quality player to 2 quality players.  It's just one idea. Another one, wiggins + assets for miles bridges + rozier. Maybe go all in on wiseman + wiggins + a boatload of picks for siakam and vanvleet. These are completely random ideas off the top of my head. It all depends on what teams are open to making a deal.  &gt; Lacob point blank said they aren‚Äôt making moves of that caliber.   That's literally the problem IMO. I can't guarantee that they would find a deal worth making, but the fact that they're not even looking for non-star deals involving wiggins to make them better is very worrying to me."
"We were literally 4th in the East and right at .500 until:  Gordon Hayward gets hurt.  LaMelo gets hurt.  Devonte Graham hurts his hip.  Miles Bridges gets Covid.  Cody Zeller gets hurt and misses some time.   We're not nearly as bad as most people want to think we are. Kai Jones is raw, yes, but he could easily be an excellent player down the road. Obviously hard to tell right now, so it's foolish to think--today--that whoever the Knicks *might* get will be better than Kai.   Lot of NY copium in this thread."
"*deep sigh*  It‚Äôs not just missing out on Mikal, it‚Äôs also picking Knox over SGA, Miles Bridges, and Michael Porter Jr."
detroit scene even embraced Miles Bridges
"LaMelo Ball, Terry Rozier, Gordon Hayward, Miles Bridges, Mason Plumlee.   Jason Preston, Malik Monk, Jalen McDaniels, PJ Washington, Kai Jones."
"Give me Dray at C, Miles Bridges at PF, Mikal at SF, Shai at SG, LaMelo at PG"
"I went to MSU. I‚Äôll just name a few.  Brynn Forbes(transfer from Cleveland state): championship w bucks  Denzel Valentine: chillin on the bulls roster I think lol  Gary Harris: solid player.  Draymond Green: I saw his penis once. Oh yeah, he‚Äôs won a championship or two or three  Miles Bridges: probably my favorite  Jaren Jackson jr: injured all the time but really good."
"I don't think pure talent evaluation in terms of drafting is the issue. Like a lot of these are just mid-1sts and 2nds underwhelming or washing out, that happens to pretty much every team.   I do think the Bucks have left a lot on the table in terms of value/roster-building and these are the main points:  1) Getting nothing out of their #2 pick. Out of everything you listed this is the most damaging one. There was never really a great time to trade Jabari that fans would have accepted, but he still had value even after the 1st ACL tear. Never really made an impact on the court in a meaningful way then ended up walking to the Bulls.  2) They made a shrewd move by selling high on Brandon Knight, then fucked it up by taking back MCW instead of the Lakers 1st that went out in the same exact trade and became Mikal Bridges with Shai and Miles Bridges on the board as well. MCW became Tony Snell.  3) The Bledsoe/Brogdon crossroads. I think Brogdon is one of the most overrated players in the NBA and was never going to be the PG on a team next to Giannis that wins a ring, but as an asset had way more value which really came to a head this past offseason when they had Bledsoe as a boat anchor and a thin backcourt.  These things plus some mediocre drafting is all what culminated in a roster around Giannis that has been thin on assets at times when stars/better help may have been available.  That said, Horst of course deserves a ton of credit for the things he did do right especially since they culminated in a championship. The Bucks had the raw ingredients to win a title the past two years, they weren't considered contenders for nothing. A combination of bad luck, inexperience, suspect coaching, and certain players actively weighing them down in the postseason is what doomed them. He was exactly as reactionary as he needed to be after the bubble last year and it paid off."

Many NBA players (both active and retired) gave him props:  * [NBA PLAYERS REACT TO GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO WINNING FINALS MVP 2021 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9yOhfBKHwM) * [NBA PLAYERS REACT TO MILWAUKEE BUCKS WINNING NBA CHAMPIONSHIP 2021 | GIANNIS REACTIONS (LeBron etc) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqGBut87sqw)  Some examples from these two videos: Lebron, Jaylen Brown, CJ, Draymond Green, Pau Gasol, Andre Iguodala, Miles Bridges, Christian Wood, Larry Nance Jr, Magic, Isiah Thomas, Donovan Mitchell, Jordan Clarkson, Ja Morant, Dejounte Murray, Covington, McGee, Haliburton, Gobert, and others."
"We could have had so many guys who weren‚Äôt Knox. Both Mikal and Miles Bridges, MPJ, and Shai all went within 5 picks after him.  Pain."
And both want to be Miles Bridges.
Every NBA rapper tryna be Lil Baby and Miles Bridges out here sounding like ShittyBoyz  I fucking love it lmao
Yo Miles Bridges one of my favorite players now cus of this lol üòÜ Terry's part was definitely uh creative
They both prob get extended before the deadline. But there hasn‚Äôt been many extensions given out from other teams too like JJJ MPJ Sexton Miles Bridges all haven‚Äôt received a new contract yet so I‚Äôm not worried
Miles Bridges &gt; Ant
Miles Bridges‚Äô dunk on Capela
"Ant and Miles Bridges probably had the best, but [Cam on Tucker in the finals](https://youtu.be/2fSlVQFNZN8) came out of nowhere and was awesome"
Ant‚Äôs was a certified poster but holy hell Miles Bridges is in the all time top 10 for me personally. That cock back was VIOLENT
anthony edwards dunk was a guards wet dream. miles bridges was a forwards
"1: Curry (super)/Dejounte Murray (non)/Tyrese Maxey (non)  2: Klay (all)/Terrance Mann (non)/Shai-GA (non)  3: Jayson Tatum (all)/Dort (non)/ Miles Bridges (non)  4: Draymond (non)/John Collins (non)/Patrick Williams (non)  5: Embiid (super)/Mitchell Robinson (non)/Marc Gasol (non)   Explanation: Starting 5 is pretty easy to explain. What you see is what is it, which is the warriors starters w/ Tatum replacing Wiggins to give us more consistent firepower at the position and w/ Embiid, who slides in the warriors core as a dominant post player which the warriors have never truly had before in their runs. Embiid and Tatum also provide spacing on the perimeter with their ability to knockdown 3's for this team, and both can play defense."
Sampson was the ROY measuring 7-4 and averaging 21/11 in 84. He was even an All-Star as a rookie. Drexler wasn't even starting for Portland and was a late lottery pick. It would be like in 2019 trading Doncic for Miles Bridges and the 2nd pick in the 2019 draft.  It's a huge hindsight is 20/20 trade where everything went wrong for the Rockets and everything right for Drexler and Jordan (although they didn't select Jordan).
"Aside from the Superstars and all-stars, MPJ is my pick. He‚Äôll be the second option on offense this year which is a step in maximizing his potential. Also, I like to see D-Fox build on his great year last year. Also, the Hornets‚Äô young guns are entertaining to watch along with their play-by-play guy. ‚ÄúHum diddly dee‚Äù ‚ÄúMILES BRIDGES OHHHHHH!‚Äù And the like lol.  I‚Äôm also excited for the Sixers to shit the bed this year because Sixers fans are annoying as hell. ‚ÄúMuh Matisse Thybulle‚Äù ‚ÄúMuh Tyrese Maxey‚Äù even tho I like them both as players."
"He has to be the favorite for MIP right?  I could also see Wendell Carter, Spencer Dinwiddie, Miles Bridges, and Cam Reddish winning."
What does Miles Bridges do other than dunk?
Miles Bridges is definitely a 2k myplayer I invented at some point
Mikal and Miles agents have to be looking at that and saying yeah you better pay up. Nate Duncan just ran  through his rookie contract scale extension podcast  and the numbers he came up with for Miles was 4/60 and Mikal I think was 4/84 maybe it was 88. Mikal is more valuable than Gordon and Bridges is maybe a slight rung less valuable but also is 2 years younger. Miles should be asking for at least what Gordon got and Mikal 4/100+
Miles Bridges  If he can get a consistent jumpshot with his athleticism he's going to be a problem for Charlotte.
Shit I'm worried about Miles Bridges getting that money
Miles Bridges agent screenshotting this and sending it to Jordan ASAP
"This really not that serious... comments about how this is a lawsuit or getting sonned, I can tell yall never played sports.      MJ didn't even ""slap"" him hard it was more in a joking matter, you can see Miles Bridges laughing as he walks out the frame. Everyones had this happen to them where you make a boneheaded ass play and coach gives you the ""whats the hells the matter with you"" look."
Pj Washington and Miles Bridges
"I love that guy so much lmaooooo, the way he says miles bridges name KILLS me üò≠"
"is it the only thing you're gonna do in the US? Are you just going for the game and flying back? Then yeah take in a Lakers/Hornets game, watch LeBron shit on us and LaMelo throw lobs to Miles Bridges  If you're trying to do other shit, go to New York or something. Charlotte's alright but it's not a travel destination by any stretch of the imagination. We're like 3 hours from the beach or 2 hours from the mo"
"Mitchell and Taytum aren't super athletic dunkers specifically, that's all. It's actually not that common for top tier players to also be top 0.1% athletes. There's a reason we remember them all. But there's plenty of insane dunkers in the NBA right now, it's just that a majority of them aren't getting 28 minutes a night, or if they do they're playing on the rockets or whatever. Or they're Miles Bridges."
"Miles Bridges does cool dunks, LaMelo makes cool passes, Eric Collins is the most hype commentator ever. Come be a Hornets fan if you like great highlights on a perennial 39- win team."
The Miles Bridges slander is REAL.  Dude is easy top 3 if not 1
LeBron can‚Äôt even remember the words to songs he raps but they‚Äôve got him here and not a guy with actual bars in Miles Bridges.  Trash.
where‚Äôs miles bridges at?
Miles Bridges top 3
"2018 is much deeper. Luka, Ayton, Trae, JJJ, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Shai, Miles Bridges, MPJ, Donte DiVincenzo, Kevin Huerter, Anfernee Simons, Robert Williams, Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent, and Shake Milton. All of them are at the minimum rotation level guys. There‚Äôs a lot of starting caliber players in there too and the top of the draft has some true stars."
Miles Bridges dunk on Clint capela
Lamelo is the obvious answer for me but I would also put Miles Bridges up pretty high.
"He was a good player, but his ratio of highlights to overall production was super high. Modern guys with a similarly highlight-heavy game might be like Caruso or Miles Bridges, if that makes sense.  A better example before your time might be Stromile Swift: check out his highlights and you might think he was an All-Star"
Lamelo ballü•∫  terry rozierüò±  Kelly(üòçüòç)Oubre  Miles bridgesüòò  Random filler center
"Morey doesn't like Westbrook that's for sure however with pressure from ownership anything can happen. And Westbrook, 2 firsts and 2 picks swaps would be miles better than what Minnesota can put together (or what many other teams like Sacramento or Toronto seem to be willing to give up ATM). Also the latest news that Rich Paul wants Maxey to be included would make much more sense for salary matching purposes. As an agent that has dozens of clients why would he want to burn bridges altogether with an organization? I swear if they pull this heist the league should intervene."
"I mean, is he though.  The list of players I'd rather have than Wiggins is pretty big.  Lebron, KD, Kawhi, PG, Butler, Tatum, Derozan, Middleton, Hayward, Ingram, MPJ, Jerami Grant, Mikal Bridges, Powell, OG.  And then it's arguable for Bogdanovic, Barnes, Slo-mo, THJ, Harris, Hunter, Miles Bridges, Morris, Ant, Bey.  I know some of these guys can slide to SG/PF depending on teammates, but that's a lot of guys that can be a SF on a team where it'd be at the very best, Wiggins competing for the starting job.  That's not a good outlook to be paid 30m when 25 guys are at least competing with him or outright better."
Miles Bridges is the only Hornet who has played with Kemba Walker in Charlotte.
"Basically everyone on the Hornets is a wildcard. I think we know what Rozier and Plumlee are going to give us, but essentially everyone else has a fairly wide range of outcomes.   - Does Hayward play 70 or 35 games?   - Does LaMelo blow up into an all-star, stagnate as a quality starter, or does he have a sophomore slump?   - Does Miles Bridges pick up where he left off last season and continue giving us 17-20 points on ridiculous efficiency, or does he go back to underwhelming us when Hayward is healthy?   - Is Ish Smith good enough to be a quality 20+ min PG or is our bench going to be a disaster with no quality guards?   - Can Oubre be the aggressive 3&amp;D wing we've been missing for years or is he an underachiever like he was in GS?   - Are rookies Bouknight and Jones immediate contributors off the bench, or raw prospects that will hurt us in their minutes on the floor?   - Can PJ Washington make the jump from decent utility guy to legitimate starter, or is he just going to stay ""just a guy""?  --  It's really hard to pick one. I'm going to say Miles Bridges. imo, if you don't have an all-star on the team and you're trying to compete, you need 4-5 guys that can consistently give you 15-20 a night. Hayward, Terry, and LaMelo can when healthy, Miles becoming that 4th guy would be absolutely huge for us."
"Speaking of, why hasn‚Äôt Miles Bridges been invited to the dunk contest yet? I feel like there‚Äôs highlights of him dunking every week."
Miles Bridges?
Miles bridges
Miles Bridges?
Miles Bridges
i‚Äôll just drop miles bridges in here for future reference
Miles Bridges is the only current Hornet who played with Kemba in Charlotte  Quite a few teams have seen complete roster turnover the last 2-4 years
"idk about that these are just the top 14 behind LeBron  2. Anthony Davis ‚Äì Los Angeles Lakers, PF/C  3. Ben Simmons ‚Äì Philadelphia 76ers, PG  4. Trae Young ‚Äì Atlanta Hawks, PG  5.

Blake Griffin -&gt; miles bridges-&gt; Aaron Gordon. Unfortunately Blake devolved :/
He isn‚Äôt better than Miles Bridges (I‚Äôm dead serious)
"Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe, Anthony Edwards, Draymond Green, Miles Bridges, Markieff Morris, Dejounte Murray, Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Cory Joseph, Darius Bazley, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Darius Garland, Montrezl Harrell, Talen Horton-Tucker, Ben McLemore, Jusuf Nurkic, Mitchell Robinson, Tyrese Maxey, Moses Moody, Gary Trent Jr.  I'd say they're doing okay."
"Not totally related, but I confused Miles Bridges and Mikal Bridges for the longest time  Also back in the day I always confused between Sean May, Randy Foye, and Rudy Gay"
Surprised no miles bridges considering he seems to have set himself up gor a 20 point 50/40/90 season.
Yeah Miles Bridges is my pick too. Some of the really deep youngish teams (Atlanta and Charlotte are the two off the top of my head) are going to have a few potential candidates
I was thinking Miles Bridges.
Miles Bridges makes it
"Miles Bridges would deserve to make it, which would be funny considering there's 3 other more well-known players on his team"
At least OG I was also surprised no Miles Bridges
Miles Bridges if he can keep it up is a for sure in.
Who would have guessed Miles Bridges would be the front runner for MIP
"We are the real fucking deal baby, Miles Bridges MIP and MVP. Everybody is walking around Charlotte like they‚Äôve got a foot long sandwiched in their pants."

Gordon Hayward and miles bridges fried us last night.
"I'm kidding. Miles Bridges probably gets it since it's a bigger ""leap"", though its much easier to improve at a younger age."
miles bridges is honestly so good to watch. MIP incoming
"OG AnuGOATby might not get MIP (Miles Bridges), but I think him and Scottie Barnes are the two most important players for the Raptors, both for the current season and the future"
"Honestly if it wasn't for Miles Bridges, is it possible Harrison Barnes wins MIP in his 10th season?"
Miles Bridges is the goat.
"I'm literally shocked by his play this year and also miles bridges, I wonder if this just a good run for them or if they're actually gonna keep it up lol"
*frantically typing ‚ÄúMiles Bridges MIP odds‚Äù into google*
This was a tough game because both teams played well overall but miles bridges scored 31 lol what can you do?
Miles Bridges is also the greatest rapper/player of all time
Yo how much wheaties did Miles Bridges eat in the off-season to be the cracked
Miles bridges is my favorite college player of all time. Edges valentine by a little.

"You had 3 guards and miles bridges due for a pay check in 2 years and a near sure thing future all star guard already under contract. You where only going to keep one of him terry and devonte, most fans wanted Malik, but hornets picked terry, and you can‚Äôt say it was a bad choice."
I have a new religion and it's called Miles Bridges.

"Miles Bridges is something else man.  Also, we created 7 steals in the 4th quarter, huge factor in us winning tonight."
Miles Bridges is a monster! Side note: Ish that was disrespectful.

Miles Bridges&gt;&gt;
"&gt;;Things do get murkier when you get to a 3-4 range like the 2017 of Tatum and Josh Jackson. Or in your case mention of DSJ draft year  .. but the point remains the same that it was applicable to the draft of Tatum and Bridges    That is exactly it tho. I dont think Mike Schmidt is doing an analysis of everyone's pick. Just a few that he considers worthwhile. If Jackson ended up being great and not Tatum, folks would be pretending he was the consensus third pick. Still I could give you that one. Def can't give you bridges though. I remember he was one of the surest shooters in the draft but there were questions if he could defend at an nba level since he was so skinny. Miles, MPJ could definitely be argued to be consensus higher picks. Especially MPJ. Dude could have gone 1"
"Hornets, because I love terry rozier and miles bridges is fun af to watch"
"KP defense looks good this season, if his offense looks like last season, i think there's a chance hornets will call, only real nba center in that roster is plumdog lmao, and they need to get PO with Melon-Miles looks good. hayward can be on the move with rise of Bridges, PJ can take his minutes, and they have enough ballhandlers (Ish, Scary Terry, development of Bouk). Like KP for Hayward + Plumdog. later we call Pels for Jonas, if they need young guys to develop again (lmao), we can send Moses Brown + Josh Green (+Powell expiring) + other filler  Luka - Bullock - DFS - Hayward - Jonas, bench : JB - THJ - S.Brown - Maxi - WCS are not too bad"
Miles of bridges
It depends on the context. If you‚Äôre really outmatched you are risking a 3 point play by contesting. If you‚Äôre Miles Bridges and it‚Äôs Jaylen Brown you should contest.   There‚Äôs actually an episode in Slam Dunk (basketball anime) where a player starts to contest a dunk and then at the last second pulls his hand back lets the other guy dunk it to tie it up and send the game to overtime. He avoids risking the three point play and his team wins in overtime. It‚Äôs a viable strategy in that context because he was outmatched by the dunker.
"Miles Bridges will be an All Star this season or next season, also the best rapper currently in the NBA right now"
Jaylen Brown EMASCULATES Miles Bridges with the jam!!
Miles bridges is finally living up to his potential and he has looked incredible so far. He's like a great 3&amp;D guy who has a complete offensive game. The hornets are exciting to watch.
"It is a privilege to make millions of bucks for posterization. As Richard Jefferson said, do you know how good a player you need to be just to suck in NBA? And Miles Bridges has proven that he will spend a lot time in NBA, as an above average starter.  Maybe people still think of Frederic Weis whose career was COLLAPSED after a posterization. But Bridges has more talent than Weis ever had."
Miles Bridges betta
"Miles Bridges is the truth, folks. The guy has worked his butt off and is improving so much. His ceiling has been raised."
Jamal Murray   OG Anunoby  Shai Gilgeous Alexander   Miles Bridges  Deandre Ayton
"Lamelo, CJ, OG, Miles Bridges, Ayton"
"Miles is the better bridges bro, dont @ me"
"Well you framed it as top 10 based off preformancsz. If you made it a top 10 under the raider or top 10 underrated then it would make more sense. Also by that logic why is Steph still first which I agree he should be but if you‚Äôre doing ones that aren‚Äôt being brought up a lot, that doesn‚Äôt make sense to have him first when his performance is one we see a lot instead of like Miles Bridges who has been killing it"
Man your a bum then. Miles bridges was obviously a top 10 player of the week and that ain‚Äôt even me being biased. It‚Äôs facts
"Tough loss for us, kinda snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.  Very surprising Hayward made such a poor inbounds pass at the end of regulation, not something you expect from a veterarn, but nobody's perfect.  A number of positive takeaways.  We were missing two starters and could have easily won this one.  Ball continues to impress, the form on his jumper is a little better and the damn thing just goes in a lot.  Bridges seems to have taken a big step forward.  Hayward continues to be solid, but health is always a concern.  OTOH, our bigs situation is really no better.  Miles got shoved around and missed a bunch of opportunities.  Richards was just OK at best.  PJ can always come in as a small-ball 5 if healthy, but he can't bang away with the big guys.  We've known this is an issue for a long time, and I hope we get it fixed for next year."

Jaylen Brown said congrats to Miles Bridges the best way possible.
what does this mean for miles bridges' verse on babytron's upcoming album
Then I will admit Miles Bridges is better both rn and all time
What's Miles real position? SF or PF? But yeah either trash way he's a stud. Both Bridges in the NBA are elite two-way studs

"Giannis ain't a hooper, he never been called a hooper. One of the biggest criticisms of Giannis was that he ain't a hooper, the whole run and dunk thing. Miles played off the bench last year, so let's look at the 19 games he started. 18.6 PPG. Not 20. OG averaged 18.3PPG in his last 20 games played. Literally a 0.3 difference.  Essay? I asked for your eye test and you said ""one hooper, other no hooper"". I gave you my eye test for Miles Bridges, specifically some flaws in his game.  You can personally take Bridges and it is your opinion. But remember, opinions can be wrong especially when they are based on ""one is a hooper, even though they played the same role last year even as a starter""."
i just want miles to get traded to Toronto so he can be km bridges
"But is he the best? No. Becuase being a hooper doesn't mean you are better at the actual sport of basketball than someone who isn't a ""hooper"". Meanwhile non hooper Giannis is without a doubt better than Kyrie. Melo is a hoopers hooper, and even at the peak of his powers he was not ever in that upper echelon tier of NBA athletes. Being a hooper doesn't matter when it comes to the NBA, this ain't an LA Fitness run.  OG Anunoby averaged more PPG than Miles Bridges last season with similar offensive responsibility and role including a ramp up in the second half of the season. And you do realize that just like OG, Miles Bridges also primarily played off ball as a spot up shooter, cutting off of primary action and secondary play action? Just like OG. And that it wasn't until the second half of the season that Bridges got a bump in offensive responsibility as a ball handler, which OG also got. Bridges isn't a do it all wing (yet) as he can't do it all. He still shows clear struggles passing on the move especially going to the left and showcases tunnel vision missing clear kickout opportunities on the drive and in the mid post. He also is at best a decent defender who has shown struggles staying off a ball handlers hip which he should be able to with his athleticism and getting around screens which I think has to do with his centre of gravity being kept so low with his wide base, which also partly explains the getting stuck on the hip thing.  You can't build around Miles Bridges until he shows that these **three** games will be his standard going forward. We'll see, but saying OG is a 3nD wing when Miles Bridges was literally a 3nD wing last season as well is saying a lot about your eye test and how good it is."
Miles Bridges got FTs for taking the ball up strong while attacking the basket. Harden didn't get FTs for flailing.  Fucking justice.
"Being better at basketball &gt; being a hooper. The NBA is 5v5, not 1v1.  Eye test you say? Ok then, give us a breakdown of OG and Miles Bridges based on just the eye test then. Cause I've watched a lot of OG (obviously) and Miles Bridges as a fan of his game going back to his rookie season."
"Eye test bro. OG is a basketball player, Bridges is a certified hooper - in a 1 v 1 Miles whoopin that ass  Bonus points goes to Bridges cause he‚Äôs the best rapper in the league"
"Jalen, Ja, Ant, Miles Bridges? Probably forgetting someone."

Miles Bridges is that guy
"Poole, Miles Bridges, Herro and Ja"
"Man. Idk. I feel like it‚Äôs too early too makes any predictions. Guys cool off quick once the games start adding up.  Imma make my prediction at around 50 games  And usually he media and analyst always go for the ‚Äúhottest‚Äù name at the time. Whoever‚Äôs trending.  So if Ja ends slow, but Miles bridges ends hot, then Bridges gets it."
Miles Bridges
"Bridges is a baller, but if OG doesn't often put up big numbers then it's not looking good for Bridges as their season averages OG put up ""bigger"" numbers. 15.9/5.5/2.2/1.5/0.7 on 48/39.8/78.4 with 60.5%TS vs 12.7/6.0/2.2/0.7/0.8 on 50.3/40.0/86.7 with 62.5%TS. And even if you look at the second half of the season where Miles took a big step forward, so did OG. In their last 20 games played, OG was at 18.3/5.3/2.8/1.5/0.8 on 48/40.1/81.6 with 60.3%TS and Miles at 19.8/6.8/2.8/0.8/1.0 on 51.1/43.5/83.9 with 64.4%TS.  The gap offensively especially in terms of that efficiency in that 20 games to close out the season is not bigger than the gap on defense, where OG is one of the best wing defenders and a legit 1-5 defender while Miles is not a slouch but he ain't that guy on D. Being better at ball &gt; being a baller.  And what other team would have a 24 year old 6'7 232lb 7'3 wingspan wing who can and does guard 1-5, elite in isolation, elite as a help defender, literally the most versatile defender in the league two years running + the most versatile defender in the past 10 seasons according to Defensive Versatility, on top of being a 40% shooter from three on volume and put up 16PPG last season + 18PPG towards the end of the season and not value them highly? Every team wishes they had an OG Anunoby even if he never progresses beyond last seasons form. If Masai wouldn't even entertain putting him in the Kawhi trade, then that says a lot."
Miles bridges or herro maybe
Miles Bridges baby. Murray‚Äôs been pretty nice but he‚Äôs at sub 50% ts rn.
Miles Bridges
I‚Äôd say Miles Bridges or maybe even Ja Morant
Miles Bridges
Miles bridges currently imo.

John ‚Äúthe baptist‚Äù Collins.  Also tbh I hope he is an all star but I‚Äôm not sure if he will be but I like what Miles Bridges is doing.
"Miles Bridges in the 11th deserves a shout too lol, but yeah he‚Äôs been unreal. Valanciunas always been underrated imo, he‚Äôs killed my Suns more than a few times"
"Sure if you‚Äôre trying to be all smart and moneyball analytics, go for Mikal.   But you know you‚Äôre heart says MILES BRIDGES HOW DO YOU DO!!!  https://youtu.be/c8beWTSft8o"
"That‚Äôs a tough question. My first instinct is Mikal because his midrange jumper along with all of his other skills gives him superstar potential in my eyes.  But Miles Bridges isolation game has become really good.  Lastly, people shouldn‚Äôt forget how good Mikal is as a finisher around the hoop."
Considering that he just add on to the team I will take miles Bridges I am a Warriors fan . I believe with miles it would help us at the small forward position it would take more stress off Steph but his brother will not be bad either cuz he could fill the defensive roll
"If my team needs defense I want Mikal.   If I want the one with more potential, Miles.   But overall I never wanna burn any bridges in my life."
"Why would you say that about Lamelo that way?  He's a 2nd year player who took ROY his first season and is currently averaging around 20/8/8/2.  He's arguably the best player on his team already, as Hayward has taken a back seat to the young guns.  Miles Bridges had a hot start, but at this point is at 20/7/3/1 comparatively.  I think it's more likely Bridges stays near these numbers versus returning to his higher scoring volume in the early season.  The Hornets are 13-9 atm, which is pretty darn good for a team being built around a barely 20 year old Lamelo."
That's pretty crazy because I think Miles Bridges hasn't missed a game due to injury yet either... His only absences are a couple DNP-CDs as a rookie and 5-6 games missed due to COVID protocols right at the end of last season which sunk our playoff chances ...
Miles Bridges - 20/7/3 getting paid 5 million.   Andrew Wiggins - 19/4/2 getting paid 31 million.  Not really fair since Miles is on his rookie contract and should get a huge bag this off season.
"[Clip Request] Miles Bridges gets a forearm in his side and the call gets challenged and confirmed as a foul, moments after the refs showed willingness to correct calls and overturned a challenged foul."
\[Clip Request\] Miles Bridges flops and gets the call literally 5 seconds before this play to keep the Hornets in the game
Eric Collins. But the correct association is Miles Bridges
"We gotta pry away Miles Bridges from Charlotte, bring him home"
"Honestly man, unless we can get a guy like Miles Bridges, Weaver should just use it to absorb bad contracts for picks."
Is Miles Bridges a better  defender than Dort?
"Pat Connaughton ftw. Doubled his PPG and doing absolutely everything.   Unbiased take, probably Miles Bridges. Admittedly haven't been following the rest of the league super xlosely"
"Ok bro. Next time there is a Miles Bridges MIP chat you go mention how you think Dejounte should be MIP and see how that goes over. The reality of Reddit is commenting something like I did in a dejounte murray thread will get me shit on because it‚Äôs a bunch of Murray fans reading it, but it‚Äôs 100% factual and any unbiased person knows it.  I know it‚Äôs not just pure stats, but the spurs fucking suck."
"I mean yeah, I agree. IMO it should be Bridges as of now, but I was just stating that he deserves more recognition.  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: but apart from Miles, those are sophomores players and they are rarely considered for those awards."
"Ok. Compared to last year he is:  +2.7 ppg, +1.1 rebounds, +2.8 assists  Miles Bridges is:  +7.5 ppg, +1.5 rebounds, +1.1 assists  Tyrese Maxey is:  +10.7 ppg, +1.8 rebounds, +1.8 assists  Cole Anthony is:  +7.3 ppg, +1.9 rebounds, +1.8 assists  I‚Äôm sorry but Dejounte isn‚Äôt even close to the improvement those 3 have."
"Ok. Compared to last year he is:  +2.7 ppg, +1.1 rebounds, +2.8 assists  You seriously think that is MIP numbers, or are you trolling?   Miles Bridges is:  +7.5 ppg, +1.5 rebounds, +1.1 assists  And his team is much better. There really isn‚Äôt even a discussion to be had."
Ja Morant and Miles Bridges are miles ahead
He‚Äôs good but miles bridges tho üëÄ
The most surprising thing about this game is that Miles Bridges and Anthony Edwards combined for zero dunks.
Miles Bridges going off
Miles Bridges
"Miles Bridges and Melon would be one of the most dominant offensive duos in the NBA.   So far, so good."
Miles Bridges had a windmill alley oop just after the buzzer.   https://youtu.be/zWw6r0rqh2Q
Luka   Lamelo     Trae   JA   Zion(when healthy)   Then it gets tough but I got   6. Ant   7. Ayton   8.  Tatum   9. Miles Bridges   10. Scotty Brooks
And Miles Bridges.. He has proper hops and seems to float like Ja does as well..
"And Jarrett Allen, and Giannis, and Miles Bridges, etc.  There are actually quite a few guys who contest dunks regularly"
"Hindsight is always 20-20. There are a handful of potential Miles Bridges types in every draft but MPJ's combination of size, shooting and offensive skill is always pretty rare. Sometimes a player can be coaxed to exert more effort on defense (e.g. Wiggins in Golden State) and for a bit there it looked like MPJ was going to get healthy (enough to be signed to a lucrative extension).  It didn't work out but the MPJ pick was a pretty good mid-late lottery *bet*. The extension is something that we could probably be more critical of and perhaps as well as the lack of development in other aspects of the game. Charlotte deserves a bit of credit for the growth in Miles' game and expansion of his role in the offense."
"Charlotte has been ""missing"" for a number of drafts but haven't exactly been ""swinging"". This analogy of swinging for the fences applies to instances wherein the team goes for a prospect with a higher potential ceiling (home run) over the ""proven"" product (single). A lot of times Charlotte has gone to the prospect who was productive, or came from an established program, or had his ""one shining moment"", or ""ready to play"" (or from North Carolina).  Swinging is going for small-school Dame over the ""winner"" MKG, or Giannis over Cody Zeller. Even if Dame or Giannis didn't pan out, it's better to have taken a chance at someone with the potential to be quite special instead of ""NBA-ready"" prospects with low ass ceilings. Given Charlotte's roster in all that time, they seemed to be drafting for a veteran team that was a solid bench contributor away from Finals contention when they should've rather crashed and burned with a Trey Lyles pick than go with a Frank Kaminsky.  I know that Miles was picked earlier but, now that they have LaMelo, this is actually the time go for the Bridges types over MPJ as you now have someone to build around. No one is saying that results don't matter - just that the ideal approach *at that time* called for more risk tolerance."
Check out miles Bridges stretch on bball reference game logs when LaMelo went out with the broken hand. Bridges was given the keys to the offense a six week stretch right before ball came back and that‚Äôs where the numbers blow up.
"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14. De'Aaron Fox   Honourable mentions (not ranked in order): Deandre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Tyler Herro, Scottie Barnes, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Gary Trent Jr., Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, RJ Barrett, Tyrese Haliburton  It'll be fun to look back on this thread in 5 years"
"Ja, Trae, Ant, Luka, Tatum, Miles Bridges, Ayton, SGA LaMelo, Scottie Barnes."
I know a lot of analytics folks predicted Miles Bridges to break out this year. The signs were there in the second half of last season.
"&gt;Miles Bridges has all star potential   &gt;   &gt;Josh Giddey at pick 6 was a good move  Certifiably hot takes. I still remember the ""So what is Giddey good at other than passing??!"" tweet lmao."
I thought Miles Bridges would have something of a breakout season and it looks like it's happening
Miles Bridges has all star potential   Josh Giddey at pick 6 was a good move  westbrook was a bad acquisition and fit
Fun fact: Miles Bridges is the only current Hornet that played with Kemba Walker in Charlotte.
John Collins is better than Miles Bridges man

Love Miles Bridges. But you must not have watched Vince as a kid.
I put money on M Bridges for ROY and only realised half way into the season I'd put it on Mikal and not Miles. RIP
"&gt;‚Äî Miles Bridges (20.8 PPG)  idk if anyone else has noticed but since those first 5 games Bridges has been averaging like 19.8 PPG on 42/29/69 splits, and playing 37 MPG to get those numbers. He's obviously made a leap in terms of being a #1/2 scoring option but it seems like people kinda just started crowning him as an All-Star/MIP favorite after an unsustainable start. Even factoring in those first 5 games I don't think he's putting up actual All-Star production unless someone really just wants to reward the Hornets for their success with two All-Star spots."
Mi‚Äùes Bridges and Mikal Bridges I always get the names confused. Same with the Plumlees..‚Äùam I looking at mason or miles‚Äù
"Obi‚Äôs dunks/blocks/energy seem to swing a number of regular season wins for the knicks going on season 2 now, i hope he can develop into a Miles Bridges level threat"
"Don‚Äôt sleep on Miles Bridges for MIP. Ja was already incredible, he‚Äôs just better. Miles went from role player to excellent since last season."
"‚ÄúCody Zeller offensive rebound, BRIDGES, OH MY GOODNESS!!! HUM DIDDLY DEE!!! A THUNDERBOLT FROM BRIDGES!!!‚Äù - Eric Collins after Miles baptized Capela"
"&gt;CHA: Lamelo, Miles Bridges, PJ Washington &amp; a 1st  &gt;BOS: Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart &amp; Al Horford   &gt;PHX: Booker &amp; Ayton  Those are the only teams I see with good enough assets and Luka brings his winning style of basketball to these teams."
My guess is that it‚Äôs Malik Monk and he got his Hornets/ex-Hornets confused? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs Miles Bridges since Miles is having a great season and don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs Mikal Bridges since at least Malik and Miles share the Hornets connection
Miles Bridges too tbh
Miles Bridges is up there
Miles Bridges next up
Miles bridges is the better hornet. Dude has been unstoppable
"Totally agree. Miles Bridges made a huge leap this year and seems to be on the trajectory, too."
"You shouldn't be looking for a sudden jerk, Miles is moving left under the basket and LeBron pushes him further left which fucks up his landing and puts him in a dangerous position. It doesn't need to be a powerful push to put someone in a dangerous position when you're midair.   Also even if he literally doesn't touch bridges and the only contact is the leg contact that's still not a good look for LeBron, you have to give the guy space to land and instead he just stops on a dime and his leg is perfectly in place to trip Bridges in the air. Maybe guys stop like that all the time in that situation and I just never notice it because this is the rare time where it ends poorly."
"LaMelo is leading the Hornets in:  rebounds, assists, steals, turnovers, fouls, 3PM, and FT%, and is only behind Miles Bridges in scoring by 2.3ppg. He's also on top in VORP and BPM (both OBPM and DBPM!) if you're into that. It's crazy how impactful he is at 20."
Garry Trent jr and miles bridges too
"Miles Bridges, Ja and Herro are right there with him too imo"
"A Hornets mention, that's the one I was looking for. More people need to watch your games maybe, you've got some of the best ball movement in the league. Miles Bridges was especially impressive in that regard after Hayward got injured last season. Plumlee has added to it like you said, always liked that about him."
MIP is Miles Bridges
"It‚Äôs him, Jordan Poole or Miles Bridges imo"
Totally unrelated but who do you think will be better: MPJ or Miles Bridges

"Like, the next guy to come out of nowhere and win an MVP? Ja‚Äôs got MVP potential but everybody already knows that.  Maybe Tyrese Maxey. Feels like that guy‚Äôs real close to putting something special together. If not him‚Ä¶ Miles Bridges maybe? Those are two really special players who I could see making a leap and waking up as top ten players a year or two from now and coming top 3 in MVP voting. They could be superstars."
"Miles Bridges has been a monster so far this season, so maybe if he keeps it up"
Got mass downvoted yesterday for saying miles bridges has been far and away the best Hornet this year by salty ass LaMelo Stans
Miles Bridges was an absolute load in the 2nd gsw-cha game.
Miles Bridges is on a war path
Miles Bridges
"MPJ, Alperen, Miles Bridges"
"Don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre getting downvoted lmao, Poole has had a nice show of improvement even though his shot hasn‚Äôt been falling, but Miles Bridges is the clear MiP it‚Äôs not even close"
miles bridges is definitely i good piece  you don‚Äôt have to a top 10-20 player all time to win a chip  and LaMelo is probably gonna be an all star starter THIS YEAR so how is he going to a fringe all star somewhere else if he‚Äôs an all star starter here   I‚Äôm starting to think you just a lebron lover and mj hater man it‚Äôs kinda sad
 Miles Bridges
"i think if miles bridges keeps up his progress he could be in that conversation. He's stupid strong and athletic, has a nice 3 ball, he's a positive defender, and he's a walking highlight reel. he's gonna get paid next year for sure"
Miles Bridges. It's all i want
Miles Bridges since it‚Äôs already happening.  Keldon Johnson because I think he‚Äôs just getting started.
"Jordan Poole, Miles Bridges, OG, Allen"
I like this. I would probably take Barnes over Jonas now that forwards and centers are lumped in together though.  Also Miles Bridges and Shai should warrant some consideration imo.
Also miles bridges has been the standout for the hawks not lamelo
Miles Bridges
"Not only that but this knife cuts both ways. Melo is AMAZING and his talent/potential has completely changed the trajectory of the franchise, but if you read articles like [this one](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/11/1/22756535/lamelo-ball-charlotte-hornets) you'll see that Miles is just as responsible for pulling Melo along as Melo is for pulling Miles along.  &gt; After an injury to his right wrist derailed his long-range shooting at the end of last season, Ball set out to correct it by training at a pace of more than a thousand makes a day. **Bridges ‚Äúdragged‚Äù Ball with him to the weight room, until LaMelo wound up ranking in the top three among Hornets in total offseason lifts at the team facility. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna put the work in,‚Äù Bridges says, ‚Äúno matter what.‚Äù**  BUZZ FUCKING BUZZ MOTHERFUCKERS."
How bout Thad young and white and walker for miles bridges plus filler
Lmfao you just admitted you don't watch Miles Bridges.
"I dont think DeMar is at that level of an in game dunker anymore.   DJJ, Lavine, Giannis, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Ja Morant, Paul George, Anthony Edwards, Larry Nance Jr, Zion, and maybe Kawhi I'd take over him."
"Miles Bridges, John Collins &gt; gp2"
Yeah someone like dwight powell they gotta trade miles bridges for him
Yeah hes up there for me as well.. Him and Miles Bridges both seem to be aboe to just jump from anywhere and then float into massive dunks..
accurate  Hornets are not just lucky he plays for them...but he's gonna cause every free agent (who's not a PG) to consider Charlotte a possible landing destination. Dudes wanna run with him. Miles Bridges was a decent PF pre-Melo....but he wasnt THIS good.
INJECT MILES BRIDGES DUNKS STRAIGHT INTO MY MOTHER FUCKING VEINS
For some reason Miles Bridges looks like everyone in the nba combined lol.
"Its a formula it works..  Look no matter what I am going to watch the Pistons, followed by the Lakers (if I am awake, and they are decent or contending)  I am not casually tuning into a 76ers game or Mavs game unless they are a top team in the league, have a great player, or a local connection.  Case in point Charlotte Hornets, Miles Bridges is a local product.  I'll catch him 3 times a year when he plays the Pistons anyway, but if they are playing the Orlando Magic randomly on TNT I'll stop for 5-10 minutes just to see how is he looking.  Then I will keep moving to whatever else/"
"What a strange combination of players, any reason why kyle anderson is somehow inside here lol or even miles bridges."
He's just being noticed on Reddit more because he's getting more opportunities for amazing calls with Lamelo and Miles Bridges than he would have in years past with Nic Batum and Frank Kaminsky.
"Miles Bridges over Capela dunk is more impactful, but Corey Brewer's is harder. I'm taking CB's dunk."

Get rid of this stupid rule it ruined a miles bridges and 1 lob a few weeks ago because technically Chris Paul fouled him before the lob attempt shot got off

I understand if people get annoyed by Eric Collins' energy, but personally every time they score I really, really love hearing ""**MILES BRIDGES!!!**"" or ""**TERRY ROZIER! HOW DO YOU DO!!!**""  In summation I fucking love Eric Collins but understand why many don't"
"&gt;if your going to determine a young player potential on a stat that has Jordan Clarkson, kemba Walker, Danillo Galinari as is best 3 players, than I dont think you understand how player development works.  what are you talking about? what stat did i use that has that? ts% certainly does not.  and we're not talking about whether or not he can be good or has any potential, i've never claimed that he doesn't, we're comparing him to the players above him who are on the list. scoring efficiency is not the end-all be-all, but when your game is predicated mostly on only being a scorer, it's something important we need to look at.  mikal bridges is a 41% three point shooter with 64%ts, literally one of the most efficient scorers in the entire league and will probably make an all-defensive team this year  john collins scored 21 on 65% ts last season, miles and miles ahead of RJ as a scorer.   deandre ayton an elite rebounder, anchor of one of the best defenses in the league while scoring 15 per game on 62% from the floor  deandre hunter again an elite defender already with 62%ts  lonzo is a much better defender and a better distributor, while being  more efficient.  RJ giving you 17 points on 15 shots just isn't that impressive in comparison considering what else he brings. he could develop into a great player and recently has been looking much better, but you're acting like a spot on this list is owed to him when he hasn't proven anything really in comparison to guys who made it onto the list. he might have a case for an honorable mention or an argument for the last spot on the list, but to act like he's some crazy snub and deserves to be on over the guys you listed is legitimately just a stupid opinion that makes it look like you already were a fan of his and saw ppg and thought that's the only thing that matters."
He looks like Miles Bridges and Anthony Edwards

Miles Bridges played really well
"We all love trae and will stick by our guy till we die. With that being said ... obviously we missed out on luka.  I had on my pre draft board 1. Luka 2. Trae 3. D. ayton 4. J^3 5. Collin Sexton 6. Miles Bridges 7. WENDELL Carter Jr.  I'm sad we missed out on wonder boy, but I'm so fucking happy with trae. The trade also allowed us to get DeAndre Hunter w the 4th pick and allowed us to snag Reddish as a project w the 10th pick. Thats our 2nd best player and our 2 best wing defenders. Call it a rare win/win."

Miles Bridges
No one would know who miles bridges was
Miles bridges has had some sick dunks
Miles Bridges
"Fantastic stuff!      I'm worried about Williamson's future in New Orleans. I quite honestly think that losing Lonzo Ball will hurt the Pelican's future, because of Ball's chemistry with Williamson. We've seen it time and time again, an uber-athletic player just doesn't play to his potential and is shipped out to another team, only for that team to have an actual point guard and be able to utilize those athletic gifts. John Collins in Atlanta. Miles Bridges in Charlotte. Lob City's DJ. All of these guys are players who were effective before they got a point guard, but became elite because of a point guard. Case in point, I think losing Lonzo Ball's passing will hurt the Pelican's, and more importantly Zion's, offense.      That being said, I do think some of the skills are replaceable. Kira Lewis and NWA are solid and need another season's worth of evaluation, but look to be decent replacements. Ingram's scoring is there, and there's been a continuous upgrade to his half-court creation season-by-season. And Zion himself could become a better creator and finisher. But those are just what ifs. Losing Lonzo Ball's passing on the Pels isn't a what if, those lobs are on the money every time."
"Sure, but just so you know, I'm not saying ""Miles Bridges fucking sucks"", right? All I'm saying is ""Miles Bridges is not so irreplaceable and generationally talented that the Hornets could never, under any circumstance, find even one player who gives them what he gives them, and the Hornets therefore must make sure every decision that they make is done to put Miles Bridges in the best position to succeed""."
"Miles has gotten better every year he has been in the league and I am super high on his development however if some godfather trade deal were to come in and for whatever reason Miles Bridges was a sticking point, our FO would ship him out without even thinking about it. As another commenter said Melo is the only untouchable, but I hope they keep Miles and let his progression as a ball-player continue. Other than Melo he is my favorite Hornet!"
"I feel like ""build around"" is a term that is thrown around way too loosely and is applied to any young player a team isn't willing to just throw out.  I think the only player the Hornets are truly ""building around"" is LaMelo.  The success of their other young guys can help - either because they can be good players for them, or be used to trade for good players - but I don't think the Hornets are (or at least, they shouldn't be) making decisions based on ""how does (player we're evaluating) work with Miles Bridges"".  He's good, but LaMelo is really the only player on the team who is good enough to that you have to have him in mind while making basically every other roster decision."
"I don't get how you could possibly leave out Miles Bridges' dunk on Capela. And that Lamelo pass was in May, it's wildly out of order at like a minute into the video."
\&gt; I'd rather have Miles Bridges   Mikal -- just saying for clarity
Ayton is/was supposed to do that. The bucks played 5 out with Giannis at center. He just dunked on Miles Bridges 10 times a game for a championship. Ayton should have been guarding him more and should have done a better job guarding him for the Suns to win.
I need Miles Bridges in there too‚Ä¶ but i‚Äôll take any of this young new wave giving us a competitive and fun dunk contest
Miles Bridges now and going forward
Miles Bridges
Is this Miles Bridges' new cologne
nah bruh you just not seeing the vision  lamelo=KD Miles bridges=Westbrook  Cody Martin/Ish Smith= Harden
Man I knew Miles and Mills Bridges would be good players but man it‚Äôs great to see them THIS good
miles bridges is getting them
Miles bridges &gt; Kevin Durant
He could definitely be Miles Bridges one day imo
bro its miles bridges who tf is gonna stop his breakaway dunk lmao
"Saw miles bridges in person for the first time today. He is a giant wall of muscle that can step back and 360 dunk. Hornets need to max him, lamelo and him would be a really fun core."
Because miles bridges is being obviously fouled while Harden isnt
"And I ain't shitting on Miles Bridges. I love Miles Bridges, I thought he was gonna be a stud for yall going back to his rookie season. But go hype up your mans instead of crying about another fanbase hyping our guy up. Especially when OG had a better season last year than Miles Bridges even if you look at both of them upping their games in the second half of the season. If yall can't even post his first 30 point game this season, yall can't complain about Miles Bridges not getting his just dues."
"Miles Bridges is in that Luka, Trae, Tyler Herro tier"
If miles bridges gets whistles when he‚Äôs fouled why can‚Äôt harden lol
"It never was, it was Mikal Bridges vs OG more than it ever was Miles. Atleast until /u/johnjoe201 was crying about how Miles Bridges never got no posts on /r/nba but OG was in the thread about his 23 point game vs the Mavs, even though Bridges already had a 30+ point game and not a single Hornets fan a thread about it.  Miles Bridges has had a fantastic three games so far this season and I find it funny that Hornets fans would rather come talk about OG than how fucking great Miles Bridges has been this season. Atleast post some of his tracks, best rapper in the NBA easy."
Miles bridges shot 11 free throws
"KD last got fts, Miles Bridges got a lot of free throws. I mean i get Harden foulbaits but a lot of legit fouls weren't called for freethrows."
When did this become a OG vs Miles Bridges thing. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm here for it LOL
Miles Bridges = Giannis?
"I dig the Hornets, Miles Bridges is easily one of my favorite young players in the league.  So exciting to watch."
"The draft order of Knox, Mikal Bridges, Shai GA, Miles Bridges ... Michael Porter Jr. was a trajedy."
"Unironically tho. He may have gotten to involved on bball decisions early on, but reviving the history and brand has been amazing. Bringing in Kupchak was genius. And now we have Lamelo Ball and Miles Bridges"
"I honestly think we can go 82-0. I mean, would you look at this team? Let's start with the backcourt. You've got LaMelo ""Lamelon Baller"" Ball staring down Terry ""Scarence Terrence"" Rozier, slicing and dicing NBA defenses. Ish ""Prodigal Son of Charlotte"" Smith, locked in and ready to make defenders cry with his veteran smarts. James ""Bonknight"" Bouknight. Gordon ""Hair Jordan"" Hayward. When was the last time you saw a backcourt like that? And then the frontcourt. My god, it makes me weep tears of pure joy to read off these names. Miles ""Sky Miles"" Bridges. PJ ""The Capitol"" Washington. Mason ""Plumdog Millionaire"" Plumlee. Vernon ""Mount Vernon"" Carey.  And then the bench. Every time I look at this list I have to change my pants. I'm running out of pants. I'm going broke. Cody ""Which Martin is that?"" Martin. Kelly ""T$unami Papi"" Oubre. Thor. McDaniels. Jones. I'm running out of nicknames. Actually I had to go change my pants again. Lakers? They can go to the nursing home. The Hawks can fly off to the glue factory. Orlando has a team? This team doesn't follow the rules. It makes the rules. And they exercise the rule of law over the Eastern Conference. Read my lips, 82-0."
Miles Bridges had more today than Harden all season. Weird.
"Lamelo playing ZERO MINUTES in the 4th quarter despite a great game is a testament to how well Ish Smith and Cody Martin played tonight.  That sequence Cody Martin had where he generated 2 charges and hit all his shots pretty much ended the game too.  Miles Bridges scoring 32 after dropping 30 last game, sheesh we got a good one."
Miles Bridges MIP Ish Smith MVP
Miles Bridges is balling the fuck out

Miles bridges is the player Toronto fans think OG is
"Miles gonna earn himself a max contract  2018 class wildin'   Luka, Trae, Ayton, Shai, JJJ, MPJ, Mikal and Miles Bridges, Sexton   also plenty of really good role players like Donte, Huerter, Rob Williams, Brunson, Gary Trent, Shamet, Graham, Bruce Brown...  also some guys that had trouble with injuries like Bagley, Bamba, Wendell who can still get better and some guys like Grayson Allen and Lonnie that can still improve and become very good role players"
Miles Bridges and Ish Smith couldn't seem to miss in that 4th quarter.
Ish Smith Cody Martin and Miles Bridges the new Big 3
"Harden getting absolutely no calls and in foul trouble, miles bridges 32 pts ish smith Stephen curry"
"2018  Luka, Trae, Ayton, Shai, JJJ, MPJ, Mikal and Miles Bridges, Sexton  also plenty of really good role players like Donte, Huerter, Rob Williams, Brunson, Gary Trent, Shamet, Graham, Bruce Brown..."

Miles Bridges so good
Mobley RotY Miles Bridges MIP
Miles bridges would be in the conversation aswell I would think. And yes that is biased but he has played very well in our two game s
"Klay Thompson vs Kemba Walker 2018-2019 Regular season  Klay - 21.5 ppg / 3.8 rebounds / 2.4 assists on 57.1% true shooting, 25.6% usage. 78 games played.  Kemba - 25.6 ppg / 4.4 rebounds / 5.9 assists on 55.8% ts, **31.5% usage**. **82 games played**.  Klay - 16.6 PER / 5.3 Win Shares / **-0.3 BPM** / 1.2 VORP  Kemba - 21.7 PER / 7.4 Win Shares / 4.2 BPM / 4.4 VORP  Klay was the third option on a team with 2 top 5 players. Kemba was the minutes leader on a team he dragged to 39 wins. Here was his supporting cast, in descending minutes played -    Nic Batum, in the totally checked-out part of his career   Jeremy Lamb   A 32 year old Marvin Williams   A rookie Miles Bridges   Sophomore Malik Monk   A sometimes healthy Cody Zeller   And to close it out, 8th man, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist.  You swap Klay and Kemba that season, what do you think happens? I think Kemba gets a ring, and those Hornets don't come anywhere close to 39 wins.  The only thing that's wild to me is that in 2021 people would question this all-nba selection."
"Oh, you must have forgotten OG finished with 32 points, 7 rebounds, 3 assists with 7 steals on 12/16 from the field, 3-6 from three, 5-5 from the line and 87.9% True Shooting. All while defending Jamal Murray through to Nikola Jokic. When Miles Bridges has a season better than OG's last season, then we can talk.  They are both basically splitting it so far. FVV is the primary ballhandler but in terms of shots against the Celtics it was 18 for OG vs 10 for FVV, against the Wizards it was 17 vs 20 and tonight against the Mavs 17 vs 15. Pretty much even, and that comes with FVV chucking up a couple of shots that he shouldn't such as trying to lay it in through two defenders of a drive or getting the ball off an offensive rebound and immediately throwing up a deep three with a defender in his face."
"So make a Miles Bridges post then. He had a great game against Cleveland yesterday but yall didn't post nothing, that ain't our fault."
OG is the first option right now. When Miles Bridges has the offensive load OG has then we can talk
Miles bridges has been playing better this year and last year  but you never see this sub sucking him off as much as they do for og
"Miles Bridges MIP finalist. Dude lit it up when starting last year, and was almost 50/40/90. Not incredible first game, but was in g2. Starting all year this year, hes gonna turn some serious heads"

"Miles ""max me you cowards"" Bridges MIP campaign"
Miles Bridges mip campaign starts now
"I agree that the league has seen him like that I just disagree with the assessment. He‚Äôs an elite perimeter defender and a great transition passer but that‚Äôs about it. He‚Äôs like the pass and d instead of 3 and d but I think his potential got him overrated by a lot. I felt this was since like his second season. I legitimately think he‚Äôs closer to someone like Miles Bridges in terms of his contribution to winning than he is to Jimmy Butler. Also generally perimeter defense is overrated as a skill that contributes to winning but Ben is probably the best in the league at it so I think he gets extra props bc of it.   Being a non-shooting non-center is such a handicap for 90% of teams, Lakers are going to see it with Russ this season and he‚Äôs better than Ben at everything on offense and a way better shooter.   The fact that I you have to move the best post scorer in the league away from the basket to help Ben play well is pretty damning for him. Part of why it‚Äôs so hard to trade him is that in a league that values versatility and flexibility, he essentially forces your team to be less versatile bc you have to play him with 4 shooters. I don‚Äôt think you could say that about any other top 30 guy."
Miles Bridges is Zion on weight watchers
Hey Michael Jordan has Lamelo and Miles Bridges they actually look kinda promising these days lol
"sure, Simmons/Bridges/Hayward/Rozier/Ball would be a disgusting smallball lineup. Could even go bigger with Simmons/PJ/Miles/Hayward/Ball. We don't have the pieces to make a deal work though."
"Miles Bridges? Fake fan. Pay attention to your zoom class, these middle school years are formative for you"
I'm making Miles Bridges 6'10 and PJ Washington 6'9 so that they can actually start in the frontcourt together.
"it‚Äôs honestly just way too early to tell. he‚Äôs still only 22 and has shown some serious potential at times, but he‚Äôs pretty inconsistent and stotts seemed convinced that he‚Äôs a playmaking point guard when he‚Äôs a combo guard if not an outright 2. he shot .426 from 3 last year and i can definitely see him having that classic microwave scorer 6moty career arc averaging 20 at some point on great efficiency, but he needs someone else to be a primary ballhandler and always looked a lot better with dame or cj on the court. even now i‚Äôd still take him over allen, shamet, tate, and nunn for sure, probably graham too, maybe duncan but that one‚Äôs entirely dependent on situation, in a vacuum i‚Äôd take duncan right now but he‚Äôs 5 years older than simons. in a few years we could be thinking it‚Äôs crazy to have him lower than donte, or huerter, or miles bridges, or that he shouldn‚Äôt have even been a first rounder. he‚Äôs way too young to really compare with guys like brunson, graham, or nunn who are pretty much known products at this point"

"The Hornets are very unlikely to have enough cap space to offer Ayton a max offer sheet next year.  They would need to gut their team to get there... I'm talking like salary dump one of Hayward or Rozier and then make Miles Bridges an URFA (renounce his cap hold). And that's all just to have the chance to sign Ayton, which would require PHX not to match. Match or not, that $30 million is held up for a several days in the beginning of free agency. It only frees up after PHX matches or declines by which time all the other FA moves have happened. Basically if CHA is smart they never even try to offer the max to Ayton."

"Charlotte hornets would without hesistation trade oubre and plumlee to free up space to try and sign ayton. If they fail to sign him, they can just use that space to resign miles bridges and whoever else is available at the time"
Last year of the CP3's extension is non guaranteed I believe  The thing I find more puzzling is giving Bridges all that money and not giving an extra 10 mil for Ayton cause Ayton is miles better than Bridges
Why don‚Äôt this fool sign for miles bridges money already
Miles Bridges is 100% gonna get a fat bag too tbh
Miles Bridges deal looks better now
"I agree $20 Million per year seems like a lot, but I just can‚Äôt see it being any less. Potential is expensive, and $20 Million is just about the going rate for an average starter. I‚Äôm not even basing this on his improved play at the end of the season. I‚Äôm basing it on his overall season stats.   ## Here are some comps from this off-season:   ### Jarrett Allen  Jarrett Allen just got $20 Million per year, and Miles plays a more valuable position, defends better than him, and shoots 40% from 3.   ### Lonzo Ball   Miles matches up pretty well with Lonzo, who also got  $20 Million per year. Lonzo is the better playmaker, but Miles is the more versatile defender and *much* better at finishing around the rim. Miles shot a better percentage from 3, but Lonzo shoots more 3‚Äôs per game, so that‚Äôs a bit of a wash.   ### Duncan Robinson  The deal Robinson signed this off-season averages $18 Million per year. Robinson is obviously a better shooter than Bridges, but Bridges is better at every other NBA skill, and still a good shooter. Bridges is also 4 years younger than Robinson, which is why he‚Äôd get at least $2 more per year.   ### Mikal Bridges  Mikal Bridges just signed a 4 year $90 Million dollar deal (~$22 per year). Miles put up basically the same numbers as Mikal last season. Mikal scored slightly less than a point more than Miles. He did it on a little better efficiency too, but he also has the better supporting cast. They‚Äôre both good defenders, but in my opinion, Miles flashed a little more offensive creation than Mikal. Miles is also 2 years younger than Mikal, which is worth a decent amount.   $20 Million may seem like a lot, but it‚Äôs basically the going rate. NBA fans just aren‚Äôt used to the new Cap numbers yet. What‚Äôs wild is that the cap is gonna explode even more in a few years, when the new TV deal gets negotiated. Being an NBA player is so much more lucrative than being an NFL player since there are only 5 guys on the court at a time."
Miles Bridges: Has walked over a bridge before
"I would also suggest Kyrie Irving, Westbrook, Miles Bridges, Steve Nash, Jason Kidd, Baron Davis, Pistol Pete Maravich, Reggie Miller in the playoffs were unreal too. Blake Griffin, Shawn Kemp."
Lamelo will be a superstar within the next 3 seasons and become an mvp candidate in those seasons.   Miles bridges will be an all star within the next 4 seasons.   Hornets will make it to the conference finals in the next 3 or 4 years  Also Zion is fat lol
"Miles Bridges was four shots from 50/40/90 season during a time when we got absolutely destroyed by injuries last year (literally missing 90% of our entire offense at times).   He was the constant that kept us afloat. Once he went down with health and safety, that‚Äôs when we became a play-in team and went on a bad losing streak to end the season."
"I‚Äôm sure i‚Äôll get accused of coping here, and that‚Äôs okay. I probably am. but people who would be considered starter quality on our team (miles bridges, lamelo ball, mason plumlee, pj washington, and i‚Äôm counting bouknight only because hayward, rozier, and kelly oubre were all out) accounted for a total of 82/240 possible minutes on the court. Our leading player in minutes in this game, jalen mcdaniels, is probably our 7th or 8th option on the team right now if not lower. we should have done better for sure, one of the worst games in NBA history is never excusable, but it‚Äôs not like this was the hornets best lineup getting destroyed. I‚Äôm sad bc it seems like nobody is taking that into account and just jumping straight to thinking we‚Äôre gonna be the worst team in the league in a year where a lot of hornets fans, myself included, have been excited to see what the team can do. I know it‚Äôs not that serious, but it has definitely been deflating for me personally."

If everything goes right, they probably top out around .500, and you know what, I don't care, because Ball is going to toss alley-oops to Miles Bridges, and Bridges is going to detonate and Michael Jordan will be grinning while wearing some hat that is a little bit funny if you are being honest with yourself."""
Aren't they really high on Miles Bridges? And they'd want Lamelo to have the ball in his hands.   Or would you think they'd move Gordon Hayward for Ben? Hayward actually fits really well next to Harris/Embiid imo
"Depends on the pick, I think Scottie can be good, but I've seen him go wayyyy too high around the 90-100 range. When Pascal comes back it's going to push Scottie to the bench or starting small ball against specific teams which hurts his value a lot. He's fine in the 120+ pick range but when you're taking him over guys like PJ Washington, Miles Bridges and Mobley, you're kneecapping his value."
"Back when I went to Michigan State, I let Miles Bridges back into the dorms because I was about to go outside and smoke a joint."

"I couldn‚Äôt disagree more. Mitch has done really well in the draft and free agency. R/NBA shit all over him for the first Rozier contract, but that same contract ended up being a bargain in hindsight. The Gordon Hayward contract was risky, but still has a ton of potential to work out. He‚Äôs by far the best free agent that Charlotte has ever signed, when healthy.   &gt;	literally zero players from the Swarm have developed into rotational players a la Miami or Toronto  Devante Graham developed into a MIP candidate on the Swarm. Jalen McDaniels seems to improving quite a bit too.   &gt;	Our scouting department is perhaps the worst in the entire league according to a few sources I‚Äôve heard. And our player development is just awful  How can our drafts be good if our scouting *and* development is terrible. All of Kupchaks first round draft picks, PJ Washington, Miles Bridges, and LaMelo, have been pretty good so far. Bouknight looks like a really solid selection as well.   Mitch Kupchak hasn‚Äôt been perfect, but he‚Äôs been solidly good and leagues better than the Rich Cho era."
"Miles Bridges may be a dark horse candidate for MIP. He improved vastly last year, but the surface level ppg doesn't show it. This year, I think the ppg will reflect just how much of an improvement he's made."
1. Edwards - finished the 2nd half of last season strong and has a coach that can utilise him properly  2. Tyler Herro - he had a down year last year after all the bubble hype and will have a bounce back year playing with his new teammate Kyle Lowry  3. SGA - has the green light on a poor Thunder roster   4. Mo Bamba - has showed a lot of promise in the preseason so far   5. Miles Bridges - will take another step and get great looks playing with Lamelo  6. Michael Porter Jr - he showed what he can do after Murray went down and he became the second option behind Jokic
Edwards  Garland  Ingram  Bamba  Miles Bridges  MPJ
he‚Äôll struggle to move tatum but will be fine against miles bridges   Hope we see og really impose himself
Just gonna sneak in Seth Curry and Miles Bridges like that
"Harry Giles, Jarred Vanderbilt, Miles Bridges, Wendell Carter Jr., Gary Trent Jr. and Malik Monk"
I'd say the Miles Bridges + Devonte Graham (2nd Round) draft was a hit as well.     PJ Washington isn't bad either and is coming into the big 3rd season where players tend to develop most.     Last draft we did draft two awful Centers though.  Like almost unusable.  So that sucks.
Miles Bridges has the best catch game in the league. dude can catch an alley from everywhere when he's near the rim.  Meanwhile most big men just stumbles whenever they catch a good PnR pass.     Props to Bridges. Underrated
Bruh that's mikal bridges money not miles bridges
This dude is something special!  Such a shame they didn't get more Nat'l tv games this year. They have one of the best young up and coming squads in the league. Miles Bridges the best dunker in the NBA.

Miles bridges
"Miles Bridges is bound to break his career high soon- he had 33 in a game last year, and has had 30, 32, 31, and 32 this season. Good thing we play the Knicks on Friday."
"Miles Bridges, Cole Anthony and Poole are the top 3 in my book so far."

"""Lol he's averaging 17 ppg. everyone here gives you 20+ a lot more stuff""  I'm saying the ppg part is completely untrue. Because he's equally good as a scorer, probably better and more efficient. As for the ""a lot more stuff part"" I agree that's the case for now. Miles bridges is the only arguable one  Oh, and he isnt playing against the second unit. And he does get doubled sometimes"
These and miles bridges
"Miles Bridges, Tyler Herro (didn't expect him to be this good)  Gary Trent Jr as well, look better on defense.  Many star players arent playing as well as I thought except KD, Jokic and Giannis.  GPII, OPJ and Bjelica looks really good in Warriors system.  Team wise: Warriors and Wizards surpassed expectstions"
"So far, Player wise: Miles Bridges. Team wise: The Warriors and 76ers, both leading their respective conferences, without their 2nd best players is impressive."
"Miles ""How do you do"" Bridges"
"Bridges has had like 10 games this season. He averaged 13/8/3 last season on 46% shooting. You're right, me saying Lamelo is miles ahead is disingenuous but I'm still sticking by the fact Shai and Fox are much much better players than Bridges."
It‚Äôs not crazy to say Lamelo is better than bridges even though I disagree heavily but it is crazy to say he is miles ahead of bridges. Bridges is the much better defender and is a better scorer while Lamelo is the better facilitator
It‚Äôs not crazy to say Lamelo is better than bridges even though I disagree heavily but it is crazy to say he is miles ahead of bridges. Bridges is the much better defender and is a better scorer while Lamelo is the better facilitator
"SGA, Melo, and Fox are miles ahead of Poole and Bridges lol"
I thought hayward was the glue guy that kept your season together last year and when he got injured is when things fell apart for you  I guess things are different now and miles bridges breaking out changes the math a bit
they had no ball movement anymore and they just took turns ISO'ing and shooting 3s  that miles bridges airball really seemed like it took the wind out of their sails
Miles bridges has more of a shot I think
Miles Bridges is who Aaron Gordon thinks he is
"What is Miles Bridges player comparison now?   He‚Äôs just a versatile 3-4, maybe can play 5 small ball..  I heard some Shawn Marion comp between motor, athleticism and iq and overall versatility  Such a great fit with Lamelo"
Miles Bridges?
Miles Bridges
Gotta be Miles Bridges right now.
Miles Bridges or Tyler Herro
"Rj is currently averaging around 19ppg, last season he averaged 17ppg. However he started off the first couple games slow and his offense has drastically improves since then. Over his last five games I think he's averaging around 25ppg on good efficiency. I don't think he can sustain 25ppg but if he averages around 20, I think he can be considered for most improved especially since he's improved defender as well. As of right now though Miles Bridges is the front runner for the award."
Bridges is also slated to be a starter all season who will continue to get better. JP 28‚Äù‚Äù ultimately ended up coming off the bench for a good amount of games in the second half the season. So miles is surely set up better to win it imo
Miles bridges is definitely #1
Harrison Barnes and Miles Bridges are all nba so far.
"Besides miles bridges, Moe Bamba afrenne Simmons (Portland Trailblazers) and og are worthy for some MIP consideration"
there's other players closer to Miles Bridges than Jordan Poole rn
Seth Curry   Nah it‚Äôs Miles Bridges right now of course but gotta shout out the local Curry
Miles Bridges with Tyler Herro and Jordan poole behind him.
"Jordan Poole is in the running, but it‚Äôs definitely Miles Bridges rn. Jordan started the season pretty rough and just recently started to find his footing again. Miles has been great all season."
Miles bridges and it‚Äôs not even a contest. Literally every part of his game has improved from last year
1. Jordan Poole  2. Miles Bridges  3. OG Anunoby  4. Tyler Herro  5. RJ Barrett
It's easily Miles Bridges rn
Miles Bridges and it‚Äôs not that close
Miles Bridges
facts normally you see this with guys that shoot lefty and do everything else with their right hand. guys like miles bridges and ben simmons
"He along with Miles Bridges were my MIP picks. Back when people thought Dame would ask out, I had Simons as a big time candidate getting to gun up shots as a starter. Saw him potentially going from 8 right to 20ppg"
I think Miles Bridges deserves that one if he keeps doing his thing.
Miles Bridges after the Brooklyn game
Miles Bridges took the Wilson ball and became a beast   Dame took the Wilson ball and sucks now   If your success is dependent on what basketball you use are you really a good basketball player in the first placeü§îü§îü§îü§î
"Miles Bridges getting schemed hard on defense, his numbers are dropping (still looks nice though). Poole might be MIP because defenses have too many to scheme against to focus on him."
"Poole, Miles Bridges, who else you think?"
Miles bridges was 6 made free throws away from getting it last year
He was actually -16 u must be looking at miles bridges. Nice try tho
Is anyone even close to Miles Bridges for MIP?
Miles bridges
"He had no choice on the Morris twins, it's a rule that Phoenix has to draft at least one, if not both twins who are in a draft.  I'm pretty certain Bridges was drafted just because they thought Miles was his brother."
"We‚Äôre talking about this season so maybe he should be dropped. But at least it made sense to list him given his body of work, unlike your boy. And Dame will bounce back. Btw ZERO winshares in 8 games. Can take out Kawhi too whom I hesitated including to begin with.   But then add Ja, DeMar, Brown, Miles Bridges, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Allen, John Collins, McCollum, Herro, Sabonis, Dejounte Murray, OG, Valenciunas, Brogdon, Richaun Holmes, Myles Turner, Draymond, Tobias Harris, Lowry, Randle, Seth, Montrezl Harrel, Al Horford, SGA, Ayton, Christian Wood - all winning players btw  Top 45 maybe"
Wait i saw someone else say this. Did miles Bridges fuck PJ Washingtons girlfriend/ex
Miles bridges
"This is the opposite, but *not* signing Miles Bridges is looking to be an expensive move for the Hornets."
They can still trade him lol  Miles Bridges was a sleeper MIP pick and balled out last year toward the end but no one could have predicted he'll be this good
"I do believe we approached this offseason all wrong. I'd have happily traded Rozier and assets for a good big and retained Monk+Graham. Once we gave away Monk+Graham for nothing, we had absolutely no choice but to keep Rozier, because who else was even going to play guard for us to LaMelo (and you bet Rozier's agent knew that and used it in extension negotiations).  Miles Bridges doesn't even factor into that equation, as he plays the 4, Rozier plays the 2, and we need multiple scorers. It looks like we're going to have 4 guys average high 10s/low 20s per game this year and that's the way to do it when you don't have a top 30 player or a center.  But Terry deserves more than 4 games to conclude that this his extension was a mistake... he's playing through not one but two sprained ankles (one in the preseason, the other in the second game of the regular season) and is clearly not 100%. Last night was easily one of his 10 worst performances in a Hornets jersey, if you're using that as a barometer."
"I feel like every guy on our team can contribute positive minutes. We feel so deep all of a sudden. It's awesome.   Steph didn't look right and it later came out that he was under the weather. Makes sense. Hope he rests up, maybe even sit out the NOLA game. Get ready for Atlanta.   Payton was of course a revelation. Hopefully he can keep it up!  Wiggins had a terrible game but we still managed to pull through in large part due to defense. Makes sense we're the #1 defense in the league. Rozier and Lamelo couldn't do anything.   I thought Hayward wasn't doing anything all game and then I saw he had 23/11/2. Such a stud.   You know who's even more of a stud? Miles Bridges. What an absolute beast he is. He looks like the real deal."
"It's Miles Bridges, and I don't think it's especially close so far."
As of right now Miles Bridges deserves to be here
Miles Bridges &gt; OG &gt; Herro &gt; Horford (LOL)
"Love how they put LaMelo on the cover everytime, even when he had a bad game and Miles Bridges has 32 points ü§®"
&gt;#####A new season means new players stepping to the forefront. Here are a handful who look like they could make a leap two weeks into 2021-22.  --- Included players:  &gt;* Miles Bridges {CHA} * Ja Morant {MEM} * Tyler Herro {MIA} * OG Anunoby {TOR} * Cole Anthony {ORL} * Harrison Barnes {SAC} * Desmond Bane {MEM} * Jakob Poeltl {SAS} * Cam Reddish {ATL} * Mo Bamba {ORL}
I'd say Miles Bridges
Miles Bridges not really close
Miles Bridges (Michigan State) vs Jordan Poole (Michigan). Their alma maters are rivals.
I got Top 3.   Miles Bridges   Tyler Herro   Jonas Valencunis   Harrison Barnes nd Lonzo Next Up
- Harrison Barnes has increased his PPG by 7pts from last year  - Tyler Herro has increased his PPG by 7pts from last year  - Miles Bridges has increased his PPG by **12pts** from last year  These are some of the largest jumps in terms of PPG over last year. So I'd give it to Miles Bridges.

"Have fun with the formatting:  LAMELO BALL HAS¬†has already seen the future.  Two seconds earlier, he watched¬†[Cavaliers](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers)¬†center¬†[Jarrett Allen](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066328/jarrett-allen)¬†vault over¬†[Mason Plumlee](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2488653/mason-plumlee)¬†to tomahawk a ferocious slam to give the Cavaliers a nine-point lead three minutes into the second quarter. He saw the Cleveland reserves on the bench rise in exaltation, scream hysterically, flicking their white towels. He heard the Quicken Loans Arena crowd roar its approval.  ADVERTISEMENT  Still, optimism flows from the eyes of Ball. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees it:¬†[Miles Bridges](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066383/miles-bridges)¬†sprinting down the middle of the floor.  Before the Cavs' reserves can even sit down, Ball¬†[hurls the ball 80 feet down the court](https://youtu.be/a1Fjk_s52Sc?t=171)¬†over all five Cavaliers and directly into the hands of Bridges. It's a Sunday afternoon pass on a Friday night, one that's thrown in what seems like a different time and space.  Less than four seconds¬†after Allen picks himself up off the floor following his throwdown, Bridges drops the ball through the opposite hoop with a reverse dunk.

A 20-year-old with nothing more than an abbreviated NBA season on his r√©sum√© has the audacity to stunt the opponent's momentum with a pass that couldn't possibly have a success rate leaguewide of greater than 10%. Tracking platforms with probability scores -- eat your heart out. For the second consecutive game to start the season, the Hornets are behind early to a middling opponent. And for the second consecutive game, Ball is poised to drag the Hornets by the scruff of their necks back into the contest.

If the NBA wisely decides to clamp down on the plague of ""take fouls"" that halt fast breaks, it could just call it the LaMelo Ball Rule.  Asked how many possessions he'd like to play in transition in a 100-possession game, Ball responds, ""A hundred.""  ""It's fun being out there on the floor with him because he's not afraid,"" says Hornets forward¬†[Gordon Hayward](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4249/gordon-hayward). ""If you cut and get open, he'll throw it to you. He's not afraid of that turnover. A lot of players hold back on those kinds of plays -- a baseball throw, an underhanded pass, threading the needle. He doesn't.""  Ball isn't defensive about anything -- it's simply not in his nature. But he's well aware of the question, one posed internally by a Hornets front office that nabbed him No. 3 overall, about his capacity to organize the brand of pick-and-roll offense that commands today's half-court game, especially in high-stakes situations.  ""I feel like you get that from just hooping,"" he says. ""You learn when to pick your spots -- knowing when to stay in the play, knowing when to break the play. You just play basketball. I feel confident coming off any ball screen. Any action like that? I'm solid.""  For the Hornets, Ball represents their best chance ever to have as the face of their franchise a high wattage talent who can truly change the fortunes of the organization -- a player who can maximize the potential of his teammates and draw national attention to what remains among the NBA's most anonymous franchises, and one of its most futile.  But this is the NBA's highest of high-wire acts. Everything that could go right with its prized new franchise cornerstone; Charlotte could get a full, healthy season from Hayward -- their multipurpose star free agent who came in with Ball during the past offseason; young contributors like Bridges and¬†[P.J. Washington](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278078/pj-washington)¬†could make jumps and add to production provided by¬†[Terry Rozier](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3074752/terry-rozier), who has been a revelation since arriving from¬†[Boston](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics)¬†a year before Hayward. Ish Smith could pace a fun second unit, and coach James Borrego could fully Spurs-ify the operation.  And yet, still, the experiment might fail.  ÔøºThrough the Hornets' first eight games, the 20-year-old Ball is averaging 20.1 points, 6.1 rebounds, 6.1 assists and 1.6 steals per game -- and shooting a ridiculous 44% from 3.¬†Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports  THERE'S A CERTAIN¬†flavor of anticipation that imbues an organization a season or two into a rebuild if its armed with a player of Ball's caliber -- provided he's the real thing.  Ball's potential is the single most important variable in determining the Hornets' ceiling. Become an All-NBA point guard, and Charlotte should be a regular tour stop on the playoff circuit for years. But if he's merely very good, it will be difficult to break out of a suddenly crowded East, where in addition to the current powerhouses planted atop the standings, teams like¬†[Atlanta](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-hawks),¬†[Detroit](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/det/detroit-pistons)¬†and¬†[Orlando](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/orl/orlando-magic)¬†all share the same belief that a young, dynamic high-lottery guard can elevate them to relevance.  What Ball has shown the Hornets from his first hours as a Hornet has inspired them. Borrego recalls the first night after the draft last November when Ball arrived in Charlotte. The team's brass took him and a group that included his trainer and agent to Morton's The Steakhouse. Ball pounded his steak, then looked up at the table and said, ""Let's get to a gym.""  ""It's almost 11 [p.m.], he's just hammered his steak and he wanted to get his work in,"" Borrego says. ""By the time he and his team get to the facility, it's almost midnight. The next day, we looked at the cameras from the gym -- he was there until about 2 [a.m.] He hasn't been in town for a day, and that's where his focus was. His care factor about his craft is off the charts.""  From the moment he slides their team cap onto his smiling head on draft night, that team has about seven years to persuade him to stay -- and every team faces a different degree of difficulty in making the sale, because some elite young stars are looking for any reason to stay, while others are looking for any reason to leave.

Throughout the late afternoon, the shimmy fest escalates to levels of benevolent absurdity. Something that those who delight in amusement when they hear about the pro baller not pulling punches in the sweetest exhibitions against the most adoring minors can never understand: There's no such thing as¬†turning it off.  Once the afternoon Carolina heat thickened to a stew, LaMelo, his brother LiAngelo -- Gelo to everyone present that afternoon -- and a friend jumped into the Borregos' pool, where they continued hooping with the Borrego kids under rules modified for water.  On the surface, there's nothing odd about the scene -- a confident LaMelo and his brother playing backyard camp counselor. But Ball is a budding NBA superstar, one whose fame predates his arrival into the league. Drafted by a small market 2,000 miles away from hi"
I mean obviously the qualifier the guy made above is if he plays this well all season. Which is not the same as past miles bridges so I don‚Äôt think it would be that killer
I just tuned in and jordan poole and miles bridges are the leading scores. Crazy. The future is here
ah yes Jordan Poole vs Miles Bridges. The duel we all expected tonight
Blank Mode Bridges &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sky Miles
Just like we all expected miles bridges vs Jordan Poole
Who TF is Miles Bridges?
not to overreact but is miles bridges the best player in the world?!?!?
miles bridges gonna get the bag
*Miles Bridges hotter than fish grease!*  What great call lmao
miles bridges
Miles Bridges is REAL my word
"For anyone wondering, Miles Bridges is averaging 23 this season.."
"Its only been 8 games, and even then 3 years ago we had 2018. You know, the draft with two top 15 players already, the 3rd best player in a finals team and thats still leaving out Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Michael Porter Jr, Colin Sexton, Miles Bridges, Mikal Bridges, Gary Trent Jr., Donte Divincenzo, Devonte Graham, Jaren Jackson Jr, Jalen Brunson, Grayson Allen, Kevin Huerter, Hamidou Diallo, Lonnie Walker IV, Landry Shamet, and Mitchell Robinson. Also Kendrick Nunn and Duncan Robinson as undrafted players."
"That, plus voters will want to spread the love. Doubt he wins MIP if he wins 6th man unless there's no other good candidate, and right now there's a couple really good candidates: Morant and Miles Bridges"
Miles bridges has been the beat Hornet bar none this year lol
Miles Bridges is top 15 lmao
Would be a lock for MIP if Miles Bridges didn't explode out of nowhere
"yeah MIP is usually between one guy who goes from star to superstar, and one that goes from role player to star. That‚Äôs Ja Morant vs Miles Bridges this year"
It‚Äôs him vs. Miles Bridges at the moment.
am I homer if I say Miles Bridges has been much better than Julius Randle?
"PF is extremely shallow, not even sure who else is missing. Someone else mentioned Miles Bridges but I still wouldn't put him over Mobley"
"MILES BRIDGES HOW DO YOU DO?!?!?  Love Eric, that man can get you hyped for a Cody Martin two handed quick dunk. He‚Äôs also very quick witted he‚Äôs always got some folksy saying or joke."
Miles Bridges will have a better season than Mikal.
"Pg. Deaaron fox, ja morant,  Russell westbrook.   Sg. Jalen green,  Zach lavine , anfernee simmons, Anthony edwards   Sf. Lebron James, Paul George, miles bridges, Jayson Tatum   Pf. Giannas antekounmpo. Aaron Gordon. John Collins. Pascal siakam  C. Karl Anthony towns. Jarret Allen.  DeAndre ayton"
"The actual headline of the article: Hollinger: Nikola Jokic is that dude, Miles Bridges is getting paid (somewhere) and 4 other early trends to believe  John Hollinger"
"I am concerned that Miles Bridges is having a negative impact on Eric‚Äôs health, the JAMS every night have gotten Collins too hyped for his own good."
yeah Morey's not trading for Miles Bridges because Miles Bridges isn't available
"It's too early to tell but Miles Bridges could really be something special.  If people haven't been paying attention, he's the clear favorite for MIP right now. It's like watching Siakam break out again."
Yeah he's not trading for Miles Bridges or Dejountae Murray. Let's be real
"Didnt realize that both Wagner brothers were on the magic, thats pretty awesome! Michigan always develops great talent, heck even Michigan State too, with Miles Bridges doing work!"
"No Caruso, Barton or Miles Bridges? You've earned my downvote."
"Hes kind of being overshadowed by Miles Bridges, but yea LaMelo is playing great. My concern is he gets into foul trouble because of lazy rookie mistakes and poor defense. Inability to stay on the court always hurts your chances."
Miles Bridges.
I think LaMelo honestly. Miles Bridges has improved a whole load but the way LaMelo impacts the game I gotta go with him.
Miles Bridges
I was so wrong about Miles Bridges. He's much more than just a dunker. Charlotte is spooky
Miles Bridges!!!
I honestly don‚Äôt see anyone else getting MIP than Miles Bridges
Just for fun I've thought about what Michgan State's team would be:  G: Bryn Forbes  G: Denzel Valentine  F: Miles Bridges  F: Draymond Green  C: Jaren Jackson Jr.
Miles Bridges
I will not stand for Miles Bridges erasure
wtf it's like Miles Bridges has wheels on his feet
I've watched like 4 hornets games that were really close. Miles Bridges is slowly turning into my favourite player not on the team i support
I saw him box out and just move Miles Bridges a few feet as if he was not even remotely the same size.   That gif is on Twitter as well if someone wants to see that. It‚Äôs crazy! The guy looks huge but he seems stronger than he looks if that makes sense. .

Miles Bridges balling was to hard to not be the favorite so far
Not sure why Miles Bridges get no love like LaMelo this game
"Miles Bridges is not on a MIP level right now, man is an All-Star."
"I'm gonna be pissed did the Hornets don't pay MB. Even moreso than when they let Kemba go. If we're to win a championship someday, it'll be with Melo and Bridges as our best guys.  That said, I think our front office is pretty smart to let Miles go."
Miles bridges for MIP
Miles Bridges: You better fucking pay me!
"Damn, Miles Bridges is a strong dude."
"Miles Bridges playing a lot of minutes tonight, Hornets really want this one"
miles bridges using him as a vaulting horse should somehow count as two fouls
Miles bridges is so good
Someone post miles bridges doing his best Carmelo impression
"It's okay Kuminga baby they iced you, you still got us back to a tie instead of trailing.  Good job flinging the shot up  Miles Bridges... the fuck were you thinking"
What an idiotic play by Miles Bridges there.
"At least 3 or 4 guys in the list arent even close to playing 4 years in the league &amp; they are the top candidates? Players that win the MIP should be guys that are mostly DNPs, comes from the g league or end of the bench players that barely hangs in the NBA but surprises everybody when he balls out in the season. Ja Morant? Miles Bridges? All these guys on the list play regular minutes each season since they were drafted."
miles bridges and jordan poole have basically the same TS% at .552 and .551 man... have u watched the games miles has been struggling until last game.

He has the biggest scoring jump (outside of Bridges) and other than Herro, is the only other candidate who has improve his efficiency while doing so. Considering how hugely different the counting stats are, I still give an edge to Miles Bridges, but Ja is second to me, with Herro and Poole right there."

Miles Bridges answering Toppin's windmill dunk with one of his own is the best thing I've watched this season so far.
Miles Bridges really pulled it together in the 4th. That spin layup on Randle was fucking DIRTY
"Said it in the Hornets sub but I‚Äôll say it here..  Just something a little poetic about Melo &amp; Bridges burning Kemba on the game changing basket‚Ä¶   Walker turning down the Hornets is possible the best thing to happen to this franchise (Bobcats-Hornets era) It finally was the rock bottom for this team and they had to rebuild, Miles looks amazing, LaMelo is a star, Rozier is still here.

"MIP‚Äôs gotta be miles Bridges   All star is solid but Shai and Barnes&gt; one of the suns guards, Demar &gt; Beal as a starter"
Miles Bridges would be the All-star from the Hornets if we got one
"I've been open to trading either of Turner or Sabonis for ages - the issue is though that if we traded either, we'd be looking for a defensive-minded stretch-4 back and those players are about as rare as someone with Turner's skillset. We got close apparently with the Gordon Hayward S&amp;T.  Here's a list of forwards I'd think be a great fit next to Sabonis - pretty much none of them are available:  Johnathan Issac, Marcus Morris, OG Anunoby, Dorian Finney-Smith, Aaron Gordon, Robert Covington  PJ Washington is about the only player I could see a realistic trade for.  We'd have to be high on PJ (I am, I don't know if many others are). For what it's worth, Miles Bridges erupting to start the season has made him more expendable. Apparently Charlotte's tried a few times to offer PJ and a 1st for Turner and I think that's a realistic return.  I'd also like Harrison Barnes, but he's on a hot-streak right now."
"With your team, it'd probably be a combination of PJ Washington and Kelly Oubre.   Apparently Charlotte offered PJ, Zeller and a 1st and I didn't think that was a bad package honestly. PJ's looking redundant next to Miles Bridges."

"True, but Miles Bridges is having a breakout that not many players have after his start"
It's too early to say that Barnes will be better than Suggs.  Think about where a guy like Miles Bridges was in the 2018 re-draft this time last year and where he is now.
"Melo being the best player on the Lakers rn is uh, concerning to say the least  WB continues to play like ASS, turnstile on defense, braindead on offense, got that sweet Triple Double though, why on earth did the Lakers trade for him?  FO needs to come under some heat for this roster construction, the lack of wings is confusing  Hornets starters are legit but that bench is sus AF, need to upgrade via trade, definitely need a competent backup C  Miles Bridges is legit but he needs to work on his defense  Why does AD keep trying to play like hes KD on offense?  Your a center not a wing, play like one   Do the Lakers have an offensive system?  Genuinely curious cuz from what i can tell they spam iso's and PnR almost at random  Lakers perimeter D is offensively bad, each dude out their just gets broken down so easily it doesnt matter who the rim protector is, if they're constantly hung out to dry theyll give up buckets.    Hornets are on the back half of a B2B on the road and have more energy than the rest Lakers."

"MIP and All-star, miles bridges"
MILES BRIDGES IS MY DADDY
Miles Bridges has been one of my favorite 5 players to watch this season
"Nah, miles bridges and Lebron for example get paid in a similar way. I remember because iirc the klutch guys had to give some money back during one of the shortened seasons recently"
"Cause typically, you‚Äôre getting huge chunks of money vs smaller but still huge chunks. I know miles bridges is paid similarly, as well as bron and I think Ad and draymond as well. But those are basically the big 5 or so guys"
Pretty sure Miles Bridges too.
Miles bridges must feel betrayed now lol  https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/pydv2l/miles_bridges_commenting_on_andrew_wiggins_ig_we/
"Definitely a homer take but I believe our small ball lineup of Lamelo, Terry Rozier, Hayward, Miles Bridges, and PJ Washington will be our most effective lineup offensively and defensively. I hope we choose to just close most games with that group because they all complement each other so well."
A realistic team base off salary cap.   Ben   Seth curry   Harrison Barnes / miles bridges   Kristaps/   Kat/ brook Lopez
"Miles Turner, Mikal Bridges, Klay Thompson , Lonzo? Not sure about point guard . Maybe a bogdanovic"
Fav. Miles Bridges  Least. Carmelo Anthony
"I know it's just in the context of the current anti vacc opinion he appears to have, but Miles Bridges is still a better player than Mikal Bridges.  Just fewer people have actually seen him play.   Yeah Mikal is the ideal 3 &amp; D wing for the modern era, but Miles is an ascending 2-way scorer that's beginning to become an elite shooter and finisher. Once his handles get as good as the rest of his offensive game (and it's coming) he could be a 20+ ppg guy."
Ted Cruz and Miles Bridges stand with Wiggins
"Yup, MILES BRIDGES HOW DO YOU DO!!! is burned into my brain at this point lmao"
Miles Bridges is garbage üöÆ
"My favourite way of remembering this is to remember that Mikal Bridges plays for the Suns, and Miles Bridges plays for the Hornets."
Let the Witch Hunt continue!   ****MY GOLLY MISS MOLLY!!!! MILES BRIDGES IS A DUMMY!!!****
"* Tatum, both are very good but I expect Brown to be who he was last year while Tatum becomes more consistent and improves on the playmaking flashes he's shown.  * Don't see any of them really improving, more playing in the same role they had. I'll go Nunn, because I think he's a more consistent and less ball-dominant player than Monk, and I think that off-ball scoring will be very valuable to the Lakers.  * Maxey, I think Thybulle is who he is- great defender but offensive nonfactor. Maxey is much more of a young, developmental prospect, and he'll likely see more minutes as a PG/playmaker with Ben out.  * Brooks, I think Clarke is buried in the rotation and Brooks really stepped it up (particularly defensively) last season.  * Huerter, played a big role in a playoff series and he'll likely split minutes with Bogi and LouWill- the only two players on the Hawks who are really SGs, and I expect Lou/Cooper to avoid sharing the floor with Trae for defensive purposes. Reddish has shown a lot less and is competing with Hunter/Gallo/Collins/Bogi for a spot as a SF/PF.  * Miles took a huge leap last with Hayward out, and his efficiency was through the roof last year, but I'm going with PJ. He experienced the classic sophomore slump on offensive, but his defense was still very good. I think he'll follow the trend of players who re-find their footing in their third year, after they're accustomed to the league a bit.  * Bones, he'll be a legit rotation guy and showed out in college and Summer League. Bol still doesn't have a defined role or NBA skillset and he's buried in the rotation.  * Hayes. I loved Hayes coming out of the draft but he's been an appalling NBA player who is good at basically nothing. That means he basically has nowhere to go but up, even if Bey is still the better player. He'll probably get better with a whole season and no injuries, but I think he's gonna be a four to five year project kind of guy if he even sticks in the league. I think Bey's minutes are gonna be eaten into with Cade/Grant occupying a similar role, and I think Hayes almost has to get better, while Bey will slowly refine the things he's already good at- I think he'll develop like his Villanova peer Mikal Bridges, pretty good as a rookie and slowly refining that 3&amp;D skillset until he becomes really good within that niche.  * KPJ, I think Wood is who is and won't take much of a leap. This was KPJ's first year as a PG and he looked promising, I expect him to be a better at playmaking with some experience. Wood is probably still the better play, but with less change in his game.  * Herro, another guy who I think had a sophomore slump but is still a valuable player, even last year he was a solid off-ball guy and actually averaged a higher PPG than Duncan, albeit on much worse efficiency. Herro is also a better playmaker than Duncan, and much younger. Duncan could still be the better player, but I doubt he changes much in his age-27 season, while Herro has a bit more room to grow.  * Both made a big jump last year, and I think this year will be becoming slightly better versions of themselves, instead of another big jump. RJ's shot has really dramatically improved, and I think he'll get slightly better in that area even if he experiences a dip in raw numbers (for example, going from 40% three-point shooting to 38%, but doing so on more attempts per game). I'll go RJ because of the leap from rookie to sophomore, and I think he has a higher defensive ceiling than Randle. I also expect some of Randle's heavy usage to be eaten into by Kemba/Rose, hurting his raw numbers even if he's just as valuable.  * Mann, Winslow has basically taken a Klay Thompson-length break from basketball.  * Walker, I'm very low on Hayes and his fit beside Zion is questionable, plus he has JV ahead of him. The Pelicans backcourt is seemingly an open race, and NAW seems the most likely guy to take that SG spot.  * Pat, I think Lonzo is who he is (which is a very valuable player) but I don't see him developing into a star. Pat looked like a man amongst boys in Summer League and I think he increases his three-point volume; he shot efficiently last year, but on very few attempts. And, on a roster with Lavine/Demar/Vooch, PatWill is gonna be expected to be a go-to defensive stopper, another area he's shown promise in- clearly the Bulls trust him to reach that promise.  * I'll stand with Ant here. I'm not sure what role D'Lo has on the Wolves; he's a poor defender, has below-average efficiency, and is fairly ball-dominant. He's not an astoundingly great playmaker either. I think he's actually better suited to a sixth man role, and he did play in that role some last season. I don't think Edwards back-half a season was a fluke, guy was legitimately great with Finch coaching and KAT alongside him, plus he should take the rookie to sophomore defensive jump; he's a hard worker and has all the physical attributes of a great defender."
"Brown since Tatum's already bordering superstardom  Malik Monk  Tyrese Maxey  Brandon Clarke  Kevin Huerter  Miles Bridges  Bol Bol  Killian Hayes since he had an awful first year, and there's nowhere to go but up  Kevin Porter Jr., he turned a corner since arriving in Houston and is still super young compared to Wood  Tyler Herro since Duncan Robinson already looks polished and at his peak  RJ Barrett since Randle is already an All-NBA player  Terrance Mann since Winslow's injuries have hampered him too much  Nickeil Alexander-Walker  Patrick Williams  Anthony Edwards, a 20 year-old who came off of near ROY can really only get better."
He has basically the exact same measurements as Miles Bridges if he's really north of 6'6. He should be able to physically defend some 4s if he works on that... Makes him a much more versatile weapon.
"I really like Ben Simmons as a point-forward-center on the Hornets where he splits point guard duties with LaMelo, big man duties with PJ Washington, Miles Bridges, and Mason Plumlee and transforms our defense. I just don't think we have the assets to pull off a trade unless Philly is enamored with Hayward, and also we cratered our guard rotation and shooting from the bench unit in the offseason so the fit isn't as good as it would've been a few months ago.   Idk if he'd necessarily be the #1 option Rozier, Ball, or Hayward would likely take more shots, but any combo of 3 of them could easily be in the 17-20 ppg range."
Miles bridges. I feel like he has a lot of untapped offensive potential so I‚Äôm always checking up on him
"Lonzo is not a real point guard and he won't make the Bulls better as much as people think. DeMar will wind up being the main facilitator on that team.  Ja Morant will be better than Westbrook and Wall ever were.  OG Anunoby is the 2nd best one on one defender in the league.  Mikal Bridges is not as good of a 3pt shooter as people think and once he's no longer sharing the court with Chris Paul, this will become very evident. Miles is better.  SGA is the second best guard under 25 and the 2nd best player from the 2018 draft."
"I feel like it shouldn't be controversial, but it seems to be in a lot of circles - Fox is better than Ja Morant.  Co-sign the guy itt on Miles Bridges. As a starter was giving you like 20/7/3 on 65%TS, making massive strides in his game.   I find it very odd we had posts picking on Westbrook for getting uncontested rebounds, when Westbrook averages more contested rebounds than Luka. People go crazy over Luka's triple doubles and games where he'll have 15 boards but it's obvious the team is just handing them to him. I don't inherently think this is a bad thing actually, just that it's weird it's only a problem when Russ does it  Similarly, I also don't find the gap between Luka and Trae to be too wide. While I think Luka is better, looking at their stat lines they're really close over the last two years. Per-100 Luka averages a few more points, Trae averages slightly more assists. Considering again how the team force feeds Luka rebounds, the rebounding margin really doesn't mean much to me. People say how Luka is great because he's efficient from everywhere on the floor - that argument doesn't go too far with me when Trae actually scores at a higher TS%. I also take into account that while Trae has a better supporting cast, they're not better in terms of helping his own individual stats. While they'll help him win games, Trae does not have the insane spacing around him Luka gets from the Mavs, and if he did I think his points, assists, and TS% would all be even higher. This last part I could totally be wrong about, but I feel like Trae's mentality is a little ahead of Luka's right now, I think he's a little better equipped to lead a team, but I think Luka will figure this out in time and that'll become a wash."
"Miles Bridges is still being slept on. At 23, he's one of the more promising young forwards in the league but he gets constantly overlooked. Love the attention LaMelo has gotten, and Rozier to a lesser extent w/ his new extension, but Bridges has been improving his game really quietly. Almost 50/40/90 last season."
"Miles Bridges, maybe?"
"I think if you add Rozier in there it's a pretty great deal for the Sixers.   Rozier/Seth/Hayward/Tobias/Embiid is a really good lineup imo and I like it better than what they'd probably get in a Portland or Kings trade.  For Charlotte they get younger and bring their timeline closer to LaMelo, and you have:  LaMelo/Bouknight/Oubre/Ben/PJ  Which is a great lineup imo. Ben can be the backup PG which will free up forward minutes for Miles Bridges.   They'd have to trade Danny to make the money work though, which could be a problem."
"As a moderate Celtics fan i feel like i shifted towards being a Hornets fan the more i watched around the league.  - Love Mike Gorman, but Scal makes games tough to listen to.  Charlotte's announcer hypes up everything.  - Rozier/Hayward and the greenish blue jerseys make it feel like what the Celtics could have been.   - I felt bad for Kemba in Boston and feel i owe it to him  - i have Miles Bridges and LaMelo in fantasy bball and those two make every game fantastic to watch"
"For current players  LaMelo, Kyrie, PG, Miles Bridges, Embiid"
"I was thinking MIP too but maybe people would give it to SGA or Ja Morant for the stats (but they started from a higher floor). Miles Bridges, Cole Anthony, some young Knicks could be contenders vs Herro. The Jordan Poole hype hasn't been rewarded quite yet. MPJ has an opportunity but he's squandering it for now."
MILES BRIDGES HOW DO YOU DO
Miles bridges has been cold this year
Miles Bridges
Miles Bridges if he keeps this pace might be in the discussion.
RIP Miles Bridges  A very promising young player taken too soon
Miles bridges is ahead of both of them in the MIP
"There is a big difference between his rookie year numbers and this year  Rookie Season: 14/4/2 on 55% TS in 27 minutes per game.  This season: 22/7/5 on 57% TS in 31 minutes per game  No matter how you look at it, there is a massive improvement. There could definitely be people who deserve it more though by end of the season. At this specific moment, I'd say Miles Bridges has to be the favorite."
Miles Bridges has to be the front runner for MIP right? I know it's early but that guy has taken a leap this year.
Miles Bridges for MVP stop the cap
Idk about Miles Bridges chances of actually making it.
"east all stars right now: starters - Zach Lavine, Lamelo Ball, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Durant, Giannis bench - Demar Derozan, Julius Randle, Trae Young, Brad Beal, Miles Bridges, Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid  after that there‚Äôs still guys like OG, Harden, Middleton, etc... who‚Äôll be in the running. Depending on injuries I can maybe see Brown making it."

this game hurts miles bridges‚Äô MVP case
&gt;6 games he's been ass this season are what he will be forever  Are you telling me Miles Bridges *isn't* winning MVP?
OG Anunoby or Miles Bridges? Difficult!
"I never ever want to play the Hornets. They just **never** go away.   If it's not LaMelo it's Scary Terry. If you manage to get them both off the court you've got Gordon Hayward, Kelly Oubre and Miles Bridges stretching the floor.  Sheesh.  Finishing the road trip from hell 3-2 is nothing short of amazing. I'm not going to get ahead of myself and proclaim the Cavs to be a ""good"" team but I don't think finishing close to .500 is out of the realm of possibility.   GG Hornets"
"I also came to say Tyler herro, although miles bridges has also been ballin"
"Fucking right!? The hornets are my league Pass team this year, and damn! Miles Bridges looks like a top 30 player at this point"
Gonna come down to Miles Bridges vs Mikal Bridges
"Last year, Terry Rozier lead the team in shots per game and points per game.  When Rozier comes back from his ankle injury &amp; returns to from, Miles Bridges‚Äô shots per game (17.7) might decrease as well as his scoring average."
I Got It as Steph. Giannis. Jokic. Ja Morant. KD so far. Miles Bridges and Jimmy Butler next up
"It's so early that players like Rudy Gobert and Miles Bridges are legitimate talking points, which means its way too early."
"It's futile but I also really like trying to predict MIP, because despite often the winner being completely out of the blue there's a set of guidelines that *feel* very intuitive;  * The player will be in at least their third season (second-years rarely win) though likely fourth or later * The player will be in a position where they have a new, or bigger, role (just moved teams, a significant teammate has left, a new coach has come in, etc) * The player will not be older than 30 * The player will already have some ability to score * The player will not have been averaging more than 20ppg  And, to me at least, all of those seem about right and if you follow those steps you tend to come up with a surprisingly small list of names who usually appear high on the betting odds and show up in the MIP candidates throughout the season - see Jerami Grant last season, for example. And I do all that and feel really smart when Jerami Grant is in the conversation, but it's always a case of Julius Randle being like 'Hey I shoot the three really good now', or Miles Bridges is now suddenly taking twice as many shots as he did last season despite the roster being largely unchanged except actually they *added* a lottery pick and their nominal star player returned from injury."
1. Miles bridges  Big gap   2. Jimmy 3. Steph  Everyone else
"Nobody is talking about Miles Bridges, but he's straight up dominating this season. He's looking like a high caliber all-star. I'm not sure what happened, butt he came out the gates scorching and it doesn't look like a fluke."
"RemindMe! November 3, 2021 ‚Äúmiles bridges is playing‚Äù"
Miles Bridges scared away the competition
Meanwhile miles bridges is an MVP candidate
Miles Bridges
Steph Curry Jimmy Butler Kevin Durant Giannis Antetokounmpo Nikola Jokic  Ja Morant Paul George Miles Bridges Karl-Anthony Towns Joel Embiid  Lonzo Ball Derrick Rose John Collins Montrezl Harrell Rudy Gobert
no miles bridges = bad list
"Miles Bridges over one of LeBron/AD for the third team, I think."
He‚Äôs a free agent this off-season. I wonder if he‚Äôs actually gonna be expensive to re-sign lol. He‚Äôs been legitimately good.   MJ is already gonna have to shell out the big bucks for a Miles Bridges Max Contract.
"Mitch Kupchak is one of the better drafters in the league. He very rarely draft outright busts. I‚Äôm not sure how great the Lakers drafting has been since he left though. It‚Äôa a bit early to judge their more recent picks.   Since he‚Äôs been with the Hornets he‚Äôs drafted LaMelo, Miles Bridges, and PJ Washington in the first round. All of those picks have turned out. Devonte‚Äô Graham was a steal in the second round, and his other 2nd round picks have shown potential too. Jalen McDaniels and Cody Martin have been pretty important players for the Hornets this season.   When he was with the Lakers he drafted Marc Gasol, Andrew Bynum, Julius Randle, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Larry Nance Jr, Ivica Zubac, Jordan Clarkson, and Brandon Ingram. Those are all pretty good players comparative to where they were drafted."
"LaMelo is definitely the better playmaker and passer, and is probably the better shooter. I can‚Äôt agree that he has more talent as a defender though. Ant has been a defensive force this season, and he‚Äôs just got flat out better athleticism/strength. That‚Äôs not a knock on LaMelo either. Edwards is just one of the best athletes in the entire league. They‚Äôre both basically the same height now too, since Ant grew 2 inches this summer. Plus, Edwards is a league above LaMelo at finishing around the rim. He‚Äôs closer to Miles Bridges as a finisher than he is to LaMelo, partly because he‚Äôs just so freaking strong.   Overall, I‚Äôd rate LaMelo as the better player, because the ability to run an offense is so valuable, but it‚Äôs surprisingly close. Ant and LaMelo are both incredible."

Miles bridges
" So question, what is Miles Bridges? Is the Charlottes best player? Can he be an all star? What‚Äôs his potential"
Miles Bridges
Miles bridges would like a word
"I'd say Miles Bridges, but Poole has impressed."
&gt;  I still believe a healthy Gordon Hayward is a top 15 player in the league  No. Gordo is not an all-nba caliber player.  &gt; it's definitely the best player on the Hornets currently.  No that would player of the week Miles Bridges
Miles and Mikael Bridges‚Ä¶  Jalen and Jaden McDaniels‚Ä¶  Franz and Moritz Wagner‚Ä¶.  Shit‚Äôs getting confusing.
"the current frontrunner is probably miles bridges tbh  also, jordan poole hasnt made much noise since preseason ended"
"I know that he shot well in college but he wasn‚Äôt aggressive with it and all of those attempts came on wide open shots that were created because of high ball screen and pops.   Because Cassius Winston was such a good collegiate player with miles bridges taking a lot of the heat from the defense opposing teams were pretty much fine with JJJ shooting those since he was hesitant to ball hog a lot.  Like I said the potential for him to take off in the nba was always there, but there just wasn‚Äôt a big sample size since he was a reluctant shooter which is why he got benched in the March madness tourney. (Even though that was a bad decision haha!)"
Harrisom Barnes 2nd and Miles Bridges 3rd.
"Pretty torn on the Curry odds. On the one hand, good record. On the other, he's not needing to carry the team. Definitely selling him as ppg leader.  Buying Scottie Barnes and Miles Bridges."
"Hornets are gonna be wild, but Miles Bridges' rise would put them in playoffs.  They were already better than Raptors with Lowry last season. 2nd season Melo + Rozier coming back would easily put them ahead (tho they already are 4-2). Raptors gave Lowry."

Miles bridges but you give us khris aswell
"His stats look like shit, but that's largely because  A) he's mainly just creating tons of chaos on the offensive end through touchdown passes that end up being hockey assists once more pieces come up-court  B) defensive stats (aside from BPG/SPG) aren't really found in the box score  There's something to be said about how Miami's starting 5 defensive scheme can now reliably switch **everything** because of how good Lowry is on defense. Not like, Jrue Holiday good, but he's able to keep up on the perimeter, guard guards in the post (he even guarded Miles Bridges in the post tonight on multiple occasions and was a reliable defender there) and has the IQ to communicate with our other 3 defensive stalwarts in Jimmy/Bam/PJ.   He's also somehow managed to, in short order, impart wisdom onto Tyler Herro and turn him into a reliable bench playmaker of sorts. It's **wizardry**. If 3yr/$75m is what it costs to get this much value and nearly nothing in the box score, I'm completely for it."
"I like the Heat's rotations. Start a defensive lineup and put in Herro as a sixth man to change the pace.  The Miles Bridges breakout is real. However, the Hornets will only go as far as LaMelo will take them."
"Yo Miles Bridges is unironically their best player, and he looks like an All-Star."
GG Hornets. Miles Bridges is soooooo fucking good
Miles Bridges is so good man
Miles bridges is a better rapper than dame
Hornets. Specifically Miles Bridges
"Hornets look much better than I thought they would be. That period where everyone was healthy and LaMelo was playing great wasn't long enough for me personally to accept it as the normal going forward. But LaMelo right now looks much closer to that mid-season form than his return from injury form, I didn't see Miles Bridges making that leap coming at all, and none of that has cost Hayward who has still looked great."
"Miles Bridges, Lamelo Ball, Gordan Heyward, Terry Rozier, and PJ Washington at the 5"
Stfu gundy. Miles bridges fmvp top 75
"As a Hornets fan, I was not happy about getting Kupchak as GM. But, the guy has proved to be great overall and especially at drafting. PJ Washington, Miles Bridges, LaMelo, Martin twins, Devonte Graham. Rookies this year are buried by depth, but I think they will be serviceable when their names are called. Griz have been solid as well. Hawks, Suns, and Heat also come to mind."
"I don't mind it tbh.  A guy like Miles Bridges is NEVER going to get any consideration for MVP, but this is a good way to recognize him."
Yeah but they have Hobert as no.1 and Harrell above Ja and miles bridges so that list is just so bummy
Hey hey relax. Randle deserves to be there but I doubt he will be in the conversation unless there is huge jump from his numbers from last year and tbh he hasn‚Äôt played the best against Orlando. I think the miles bridges is fair considering his week . But yeah he won‚Äôt last in the conversation for long
"I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs going to be MVP, but isn‚Äôt it disrespectful to not at least acknowledge him when they‚Äôre currently tied for the second best record in the league? Especially when you got fucking Miles Bridges on that list, like don‚Äôt get me wrong Bridges is BALLING but he isn‚Äôt winning MVP as well"
Where is embiid? We would legit be 0-5 without him  Also Miles Bridges TF????
1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Ja Morant 5. Nikola Jokic 6. Rudy Gobert 7. Anthony Davis 8. Miles Bridges 9. Jayson Tatum 10. Trae Young
"Knicks - picking up where they left off last season and upgraded their point guard; Kemba looks healthier too.  Bulls - DeBallZach fitting together better than expected, Caruso probably a top 10 offseason acquisition.  Hornets - LaMelo looks great, Miles Bridges looks likw he's made a leap.  Wizards - Wes Unseld Jr is legit. The Westbrook haul are doing solid work."
The hornets are honestly my favourite team to watch this year. Also if miles bridges keeps this up he‚Äôs going to blow the MIP award out of the water.
"Melo is down right ridiculous...he makes everyone around him better, doesn't take a play off defensively,  now he's shooting the 3.  Miles Bridges is a *nice* player...but lets be real...Melo has turned him into a highlight reel all star.  Melo is gonna attract good FA's..they all wanna run w/ him."
Miles Bridges sure has an NBA body. He's been insane this year.
üò≠üò≠üò≠  Some mf in the fantasy bball sub was hesitant on accepting Harden for Miles Bridges bruh
"Miles Bridges, Andrew Wiggins."
Based solely on the numbers I have to say Harrison Barnes and Miles Bridges will be the captains.  It's just math.
We couldn‚Äôt rebound to save our lives and Miles Bridges is too good
Lamelo and Miles Bridges will both be All-Stars this season.
