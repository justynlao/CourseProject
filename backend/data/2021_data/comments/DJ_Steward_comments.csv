DJ Steward
"The problem is all the multi year guys are surrounded by OADs and the Duke culture and leave early anyway. Frank Jackson, Trevon Duval, Wendell Carter and most recently DJ Steward are all dudes that were accounted for future teams but left early and left Duke scrambling. And there are a few examples of these players almost every year"
Ngl the other dude kinda stopped lol. Steward is big boy but dj also beast
"They’re probably going to their g league team, but DJ Steward should’ve stayed in college"
DJ Steward Pacers bound please
