"Imagine being Blake Griffin.    You're drafted by one of the worst organizations in the history of the NBA. A racist owner, horrible team management, team players themselves hating everything about organization, the whole 9 yards. You're Blake Griffin, however, and you do your best to put this organization on the map.    Griffin redshirts his 1st season due to injury, and in his 1st official season in the NBA, he wins ROTY and gets into the All-Star game as a rookie. You've turned this franchise around in just your first real season playing. The next season, the team capitalizes on your success and acquires Chris ""Point God"" Paul, and you and the team continue to have arguably successful season after successful season. Consistent playoff berths for one of the worst NBA organizations of all time for the better half of a decade. Their biggest downfall was just not making serious headway in the playoffs, with consistent First/Second round exits. That being said, you can't say those weren't successful seasons for the LA Clippers, considering their storied history.    At the end of the 2017 season, Blake Griffin had been expecting some sort of contract extension. He was, afterall, the face of the franchise for the better half of a decade. Blake Griffin wasn't expecting the biggest extension, heck he realized his own position at that point in his career, and was willing to work with the Clippers and compromise on a contract. When he walked into the extension, the Clippers had set up their room with various global icons, implying that Griffin would be an icon for the Clippers. Clippers employees wore custom made shirts featuring Griffin's face along with historic icons such as Obama, MLK, Gandhi, and Mandela. He was told that, as difficult as the times have been, the LA Clippers were committed to Griffin's future to the team. So according to Griffin, this was his team of the future. He was the face of the franchise, and he was offered a max contract from the get go. Of course, you accept a max contract, no matter who it is.   Just the next season after, approximately 6 months after the extension, the LA Clippers trade Blake Griffin to the Detroit Pistons for Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanovic, a future 1st and a future 2nd. Talk about getting your back stabbed by one of the worst franchises in NBA history. Not to say that the Clippers did the wrong thing, we have all seen how Griffin has declined since his 1st Detroit Pistons season, but it's how they did it that makes them the bad guy. The LA Clippers didn't have to lie to Griffin like that. Sorry Blake, you deserve better."
Just wait till you hear about Blake Griffin
Mitch Richmond was a better player than Blake Griffin @ me
Moving a shooter that makes 16 million is not some herculean task. And adding Blake Griffin to the current team does what? Hell at least go for Drummond. But really what they need is some guys who can and will actually defend. Plus they should probably get a new coach. There is no all in move for them right now.
Blake Griffin is the guy who started the resurgence of the Clippers franchise
Delon Wright and Blake Griffin helped too
Finally Lamelo has met his goal of surpassing Blake Griffin
"Blake Griffin, go hang out with Goff."
"Blake Griffin, head back on up"
"Blake Griffin, come on down"
"I was looking for our last one and was shocked to find that Ben McLemore won it in November 2013. Then I saw that the other Western Conference winners for that season were Trey Burke (3x), Nick Calathes, and Gorgui Dieng and that kind of explains things.  Prior to that was Tyreke Evans (2x) in 2009. Boogie didn't win any the next year because Blake Griffin swept all the months. And that's it for Sacramento Kings winners."
Pretty interesting words coming from someone who’s highest calling was getting murdered by Dwayne Wade and Blake Griffin
Sometimes i misspell Blake Griffin as Washed.
Andrew Wiggins below Blake griffin is a travesty
Blake Griffin
Lmao the ol blake griffin flying elbow
"Pleasant: Isaiah Stewart  When we drafted him I didn’t know who he was since I don’t watch college ball. Seemed like he could be real solid for us and so far on the defensive end he’s done so much better than I thought he would. It also seems like he annoys the fuck out of whoever he’s guarding and I couldn’t ask more from a rookie. Even offensively he’s shown he may have some range in the future, form looks nice so far.  Unpleasant: Blake Griffin  It just hurts seeing him play now, his body has more or less given up on him. He locks himself up on offense and he can’t even really move on defense. End of that warriors game the other day you can see him limping off the court. Love what he did for us two years ago, and I absolutely love the attitude and professionalism he’s brought, but he’s definitely not the same player he was"
I want to do the Blake Griffin on Pau Gasol dunk on someone
Yes they will trade him for Blake Griffin
People on this sub were telling me he had regressed worse than Blake Griffin lol
"I said i doubt detroit does the trade at the end of the post but a good reason being it fills out their roster more while they rebuild for the future. With more people coming back from Acl injuries relatively the same they would have a high level point guard that the roster is missing and a guy who can stretch the floor with his three point shooting, Dinwiddie is also nearing his prime so they could get 4/5 good years out of him and Harris while being slightly older he has the benefit on the 3 point specialist playstyle that could allow him to last as long as guys like JJ, ray allen, kyle korver have done recently. The pistons currently have the problem where they severely lack shooting besides Grant and an inconsistent blake griffin and this trade would fix that some."
&gt; Back to back 2nd night game  Pistons also played on a back to back  &gt; No AD  Are the Lakers worse than the Pistons without AD?  &gt; He was still the best player on the court  And he didn't play like it  &gt; Everyone apart from Kuzma n THT played below their level  LeBron included  &gt; Blake Griffin got hot he's been trash every other game  lol  &gt; Lebron was coming off scoring 80 in his last 2 games  So that's why he scored 2 pts in the 2nd half. Got it.  &gt; Lebron didn't allow them to score 150  lol
Back to back 2nd night game  No AD  He was still the best player on the court  Everyone apart from Kuzma n THT played below their level  Blake Griffin got hot he's been trash every other game  Lebron was coming off scoring 80 in his last 2 games  Lebron didn't allow the worst team in the league to score 150
I didn’t buy into it bc I’m a hater I bought into it bc I saw the same shit happen to Blake Griffin over the last two years.
KD just lost to a park car today though. Nets need to trade KD for Blake Griffin straight up if they want to get past the Washington Parked Cars
"Eh, it's definitely arguable, but I can't name 20 definitively better when healthy, due to the reasons I listed.   He may be declining quick, but the injury is exacerbating it and if he rested up and got better he could perform on a Top 20 level, maybe even Top 15. On the other hand, the injuries could continue to sink him and his athleticism-reliant game to the point where guys like Blake Griffin are now"
"Yeah, looked like a pregnant ankle. Horrible. But who knows... maybe looks worse than actually it is. Maybe the very opposite. Im hoping is nothing too serious, it would be sad to see AG going the same path as Blake griffin."
Not any more than we owed Blake Griffin one after he looked great against the Lakers.  Both need to do it more consistently before the consensus on them was wrong.
The Blake Griffin special
"We’re 18 games in... from what I recall the only players to have shown to be “generational” so early  in the past decade have been Blake Griffin, Kyrie, Zion, and Simmons.  As soon as Lamelo gets consistent 35+ min a game you’ll see it. As soon as Wiseman adjusts enough to the NBA and plays 30m+ you’ll see it. Not sure about Edwards though."
He is a real potential hall of famer not guys like Blake Griffin and Kevin Love who lose and miss the playoffs every year.
"I agree that he is a lock.  However, Blake Griffin is a 6x All Star and 5x All NBA and most people don’t see him getting in.  What makes Dame a lock now over Griffin?"
Klay probably will have 2 years left in league and will look similar to blake griffin does now or westbrook or kevin love...like 50% of their former abilities.  Mcgruder I dunno he could be out of league some day too but klay's time is not far away.
Blake Griffin on the Clippers
"Guillermo, put it on the poll...  Is Black Griffin a better or worse basketball player than Blake Griffin?"
"Hi LAPD, this is Blake Griffin, Chris Paul about to beat me up!"
Well he’s not Blake Superior no more so Black Griffin it is
"He’s only 20, has only played basketball for like seven years, and is behind Blake Griffin and Jerami Grant for minutes at the 4. I’m not starting to worry unless he’s looking bad or not earning minutes after Blake is gone."
"I’ve read about Blake Griffin coasting, but that’s the first time I’ve watched it. Dude looked inconvenienced to be out there."
Blake Shelton can give the Pistons better mins than Blake Griffin at this point.
That is almost definitely just shaq not practicing freethrows along with bigs not focusing on guard skills back then. Nowadays as the game has become more positonless you got bigs like embiid and AD who have not only learned elite post skills but have also developed great guard footwork and deep range. You also have someone like Blake griffin who is also a forward and has actually changed his game more than bron
Is this somewhat similar to what happened to Blake Griffin?
This is common sense. Look at Blake Griffin.
"Keltner List time.  1.Was he ever regarded as the best player in basketball?  No.  2. Was he the best player on his team?  You could probably make a case, but I think most people would agree Chris Paul was better.  3. Was he the best player in basketball at his position?  Well, there's Kevin Durant, who won the MVP in what I'd consider Griffin's best year - 2013-14, where he put up a 24/9/4. I doubt you'd find many people who would have taken Blake over KD in any given year.  4. Did he have an impact on a number of playoff runs?  Yeah, until the team fell apart every year. And, aside from the 2014-15 playoffs, when he averaged 25.5/12.7/6.1, he was generally worse when it mattered. Still, those Clippers teams don't even get a chance to fail spectacularly without him, so let's say yes.  5. Was he a good enough player that he could continue to play regularly after passing his prime?  Sure isn't looking like it. Unlike a Chris Webber or Grant Hill-type, it seems like he's not going to be able to compensate for the loss of athleticism that was a huge part of his game by becoming a more savvy player. It's not that he doesn't have a great basketball IQ, but all the injuries have really left him lacking in a lot of ways, especially on defense.  6. Is he the very best player in basketball history who is not in the Hall of Fame?   Looking ahead, I doubt anyone will be making that claim, aside from a few Clippers homers.  7. Are most players who have comparable career statistics in the Hall of Fame?  Most silimar players by career arc: George McGinnis, Jimmy Butler, Peja, Harry Gallatin, Billy Cunningham, Marques Johnson, Lou Hudson, James Worthy, and Kiki Vandeweghe. So, there's a few, but not really.  8. Do the players numbers meet Hall of Fame standards?  Like OP said, BBRef gives him about a 50/50 shot, so he's not completely lacking statistically, but his long history of injuries really cut into his prime, and is definitely going to stop him from padding his stats with a graceful second half of a career.  9. Is there evidence to suggest that the player was significantly better or worse than is suggested by his statistics?  Nothing really jumps out at me, but if you have an argument, please add it.  10. Is he the best player *at his position* who is eligible for the Hall of Fame but not in?  I take Chris Webber over Blake. Some people might even put Rasheed Wallace or even Shawn Kemp (a great comp for Griffin's career arc, if you sub ""injury-prone"" for ""coke and Twinkies""), but Griffin probably won't end up the best 4 outside of the Hall.  11. How many MVP-type seasons did he have? Did he ever win an MVP award? If not, how many times was he close?  No MVP wins. Three seasons in the top 10 for MVP votes, with a high of 3rd in 2013-14.   12. How many All-Star-type seasons did he have? How many All-Star games did he play in? Did most of the other players who played in this many go into the Hall of Fame?  Only six. Again, the injuries are the culprit here, since Blake was nothing but popular throughout his career in LA.  13. If this man were the best player on his team, would it be likely that the team could win a conference final?   LOL no.   14. What impact did the player have on basketball history? Was he responsible for any rule changes? Did he introduce any new equipment? Did he change the game in any way?  I mean, he (kind of, sort of) dunked over a Kia? He's probably top 10 for basketball players turned actors?   15. Did the player uphold the standards of sportsmanship and character that the Hall of Fame, in its written guidelines, instructs us to consider?  Well, duh. Not everyone gets compared to Gandhi AND Ali.  &amp;#x200B;  So, nice career, short peak, no rings. If he gets in, it won't be the most egregious thing I've ever seen, but it'd be some weak bullshit for sure."
Lmao Simmons will never be a shooter. He’s already way too behind in development. Blake griffin didn’t become a competent shooter until like his late 20s and he actually put the work in and showed improvement/development every year. Simmons is at the same place since his rookie year.  Also the sixers are actually trying to legitimately compete this year and so every Simmons shot is a wasted possession and a huge negative against the other true contenders. He should have started earlier when there was more room to make mistakes.
"KG isn’t prototypical IMHO, he was a 7 foot SF that shifted to PF.  He’s in that hybrid section.  He just slowed down later in his career and went to a PF/C.   Blake Griffin is prototypical, as is Duncan, Stoudamire, Pau Gasol....  Guys who can both play high and low and rebound.  Al Horford might actually be one."
"I mean Bosh had 2 full seasons on blake griffin, griffin is in year 11 and Bosh was in year 13 at 31.   Griffin was the better player, Bosh just played 2 more seasons and was mostly healthy compared to blake"
Blake Griffin has better counting stats than Bosh and played in 53 playoff games  I think he'll be okay
You don’t need to be an nba exec or director of scouting to realize Westbrook was all athleticism.  Same thing with Blake griffin. And it’ll be the same case with Zion.
If Michael Jordan made it in to the HOF Blake griffin should make it in without a doubt
Zion and ben simmons punching the air rn while blake griffin cries in the corner
"So he will have to change his game, right?   And I haven't seen anything to indicate that Zion has the same toolkit Lebron ever had. Aldridge was pretty much always a midrange demon.   Blake is the only analogous player you listed, and Kings Cwebb is a much bigger compliment than Pistons Griffin but you wouldn't know anything about that, carry on neff'"
"Today I learned I could be an NBA executive.  But for real, anyone who who thinks an athletic reliant player will have a good back end career is a fool.  Please see how that turned out for drose, Dwight, Blake griffin, John wall...Russell Westbrook to name a few.  All these players were phenomenal but without having the basic fundamentals of the game, you’re bound to burn in a flame. These players are simply not meant to last."
I’m sure a team with Chris Paul and Blake Griffin was very humble
"I literally read your comment and legitimately laughed out loud. You clearly don’t watch Hawks basketball. If you actually believe Steph is closer to Klay on defense than Trae, I’ve heard everything I needed to. Enjoy the lottery and a washed Blake Griffin on $35 million a year."
I hate seeing it. Westbrook when he's on was so much fun to watch. Seeing both he and Blake Griffin regressing sucks.
"All-NBA should not be by position, just the best 15 players. It boggles the mind that peak Blake Griffin never made the 1st team but DeAndre Jordan did."
"The NBA’s rookie rules are so dumb, if you apply baseball or hockey rookie rules to basketball (basically both require that a player can’t have more than ~1/4 of big league experience from the previous season, though it’s def more complicated than that), Keldon should 100% be considered a rookie this season.   You’re telling me that Julius Randle, who got injured in his first 12 minutes of game time and missed the rest of his first year, isn’t a rookie anymore but Blake Griffin and Ben Simmons are? Some whack ass shit."
"In the past year the owner has stepped back from meddling and actually allowed the new GM (Troy Weaver who was an assistant GM with the Thunder) do an actual full rebuild. The Gores meddling is part of the reason the team had been so bad. He had a playoffs or bust mentality and forced a lot of the bad moves the team made without taking the blame.   Gores told Dumars he had to get stars when he first arrived which led to us signing Josh Smith (because realistically what legit star is coming to Detroit in free agency) and forced the Brandon Knight Kris Middleton for Brandon Jennings trade (Dumars was very high on Middleton and thought he had the chance to be good but playoffs and win now takes precedent right). After he fired Dumars instead of hiring a coach and GM that might develop a young core (Drummond, Dinwiddie, and KCP all looked promising at the time) he hired Stan Van Gundie to be the Coach/GM and told him we where a win now team.   Obviously a lot of stuff happened over the Van Gundy years but I think the most obvious ways Gores win now directive hurt us where the Stanley Johnson pick, Blake Griffin trade, and Luke Kennard pick. Long story short Johnson was picked over better players because he played NBA level defense and was considered the best option to help the team immediately (tbf he looked decent in that playoff series his 1st year). Kennard was picked over Donovan Mitchell because Kennard shot well and would help the team immediately. Where as Mitchell was seen by the franchise as someone that would take sometime to develop. While Blake Griffin was traded for because Gores told Van Gundy playoffs or bust and he was trying to save his job. Gores meddling has hurt the team for years and was a major reason we couldn't rebuild.  Recently though Gores has stepped back and has allowed to Troy Weaver to start a full rebuild which is refreshing to see. Also Weaver got Sadiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart in his 1st draft who both look to be good. Hayes looks bad right now but he was supposed to be project so I'm not worried yet. Last year the Pistons got Doumbouya who has potential. Also n free agency Weaver signed Josh Jackson who was showing flashes of a breakout with us before his injury. As well as Jerami Grant who is showing that he can be a legitimately great player. This is honestly the most excited I've been about the Pistons in years.  Also the Pistons are managing to tank while being super competitive in the games they've played. They had 3 bad losses to Milwaukee but other than that everyone game has come down to the wire. I know Pistons fans keep saying this but they're not nearly as bad as their record indicates and looking at net ratings shows that [bbref](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_ratings.html). They're 17th in the leauge in adjusted Net Rating and they're 22nd if you use [NBA.com's](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=-1) unadjusted Net rating. Basically we get to watch competitive basketball while the team is tanking and I'm really happy about that. I also like the moves Weaver has made and think he is a good GM. So I'm happy about the future."
"Yeah, Zbo used to do it to Blake Griffin all the time"
"The Pistons haven't been relative since 2009. One win against the Lakers and all of a sudden that changes? That's not how that works.   Their acquisition of Blake Griffin a few years ago was suppose to be a changing factor and unfortunately that didn't work either.  Detroit, like Orlando, Washington, and Charlotte, have been stuck in the middle of the pack for so long. They aren't good enough to be a contender but also not bad enough that they aren't fighting for a playoff spot. They're kind of stuck in purgatory."
Blake Griffin
The black Blake Griffin
"its just 1 game dude. we've been down by 20 some games, Westbrook  currently has 41% eFG for the season which is among the worst in the league. and a whopping negative win shares. to say hes washed is actually sugar coating it. Blake Griffin is washed but hes not negative."
Blake Griffin
"The worst argument is 2011 for sure. Fun fact about that year btw, Dwight Howard received twice as many combined 1st and 2nd place votes as Lebron.         |Player|Points|1st Place Votes|2nd Place Votes|3rd Place Votes|4th Place Votes|5th Place Votes| :--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Derrick Rose (Chi)|1182|113|6|2|0|0| |Dwight Howard (Orl)|643|3|57|31|16|11| |LeBron James (Mia)|522|4|26|39|31|12| |Kobe Bryant (LAL)|428|1|18|32|40|12| |Kevin Durant (OKC)|190|0|6|10|20|38| |Dirk Nowitzki (Dal) |113|0|5|3|11|30| |Dwyane Wade (Mia)|24|0|1|1|2|6| |Manu Ginobili (SA)|20|0|2|0|0|6| |Amare Stoudemire (NY)|9|0|0|1|0|4| |Blake Griffin (LAC)|5|0|0|1|0|0| |Rajon Rondo (Bos)|5|0|0|1|0|0| |Tony Parker (SA)|3|0|0|0|1|0| |Chris Paul (NO)|2|0|0|0|0|2|"
How has no one said Blake Griffin? He fell off a cliff.
Blake Griffin always seems to show out against the Lakers
"I think Aaron Gordon has the athleticism to be a perennial all-star. He was a 4th pick, insane vertical, 6'8 240lbs with crazy strenght. But he never got to where I thought he would... I thought he would get to a prime Blake Griffin level of play, a bit smaller but more athletic... and he never got even close."
It’s not an *opinion* that Blake Griffin put 24&amp;13 on Tim Duncan for 7 games you fuckin dip
"Yeah not everone can be LeBron James/Karl Malone and have MVP seasons in their late 30's. Actually those two are the only ones I can think of. It's unfortunate watching guys in their early 30' like Blake Griffin slowing down, but it happens."
"The 2 guys I had in mind immediately  stopped playing after 2019, they are 32 and 30 years old respectively and had great talent with some legendary showings. I'm talking about Michael Beasley and Lance Stephenson. Both are still NBA calibre players easily imo in terms of skill but their character is just too tough to deal with along with questionable work ethic. Especially Beasley at times looked like the greatest player in the NBA when he decided to go all out and have a good day at the same time.  Currently in the league I'd say Lonzo Ball, Andrew Wiggins. Andrew Wiggins showed many Superstar-level performances at this point of his career but those games are far inbetween. Lonzo imo shows great athleticism, defense and amazing passing ability as well as general BBIQ. When he goes hard on a drive he's showing glimpses of great finishing qualities and his physique is primed to bully small guard on both ends. His mentality holds him back though. Kind of low-hanging fruit to add to this would be Markelle Fultz lol   Some lower tier ones may be Kristaps and Lauri Makkanen, they look like Dirk on good games but injuries or mental troubles kept them away from having a breakout season into All-Star level (Lauri) or Superstardom (Kristaps). I'll also add Gallinari to the mix as he's an ultra skilled guy but always suffered bad injuries when he finally looked like he figured the NBA out. And a guy that was a Superstar but still never quite reached his peak would be Blake Griffin. Injuries once again held him back from having his best season. If some things went different he'd have a good chance to be a top 10 player, Blake could do it all and had great work ethic."
"Blake Griffin doesn't shoot 43% when he takes 8 threes a game, he takes 8 threes a game when 43% of them are going in."

Can't blame us for having LeBron when yall have the greatest 6'9 player of all time in Blake Griffin
shaq and chuck talking about chris paul and blake griffin cheer me up when i'm down
i like shaq...who can forget his exchange with chuck about chris paul trying to beat up blake griffin?
"&gt; You really think Blake Griffin is worth keeping over bringong wood back for the pistons?  literally nobody said that and that has nothing to do with the argument YOU are trying to make, you’re either an incredibly obvious troll or just don’t understand basic english lol"
Also Lamar was a drug addict so yeah not blake griffin at all
"don't forget blake griffin, zach lavine, aaron gordon and pretty much all nba dunk champion"
"Blake griffin is 31, he's equvalent to none of those players trajectories."
"I have to say I like the adventures of Blake Griffin, Stretch Four"
Let that sink in. Russ and Blake griffin can no longer bang out like they used to. Two of the most explosive players of our generation are fading before our eyes. We’re getting old boys.
Blake Griffin is just a 6'9 JR Smith  LeBron punching the air rn
Is it real that Blake Griffin hasnt dunked yet this season?
Imagine telling someone from 2010 that Blake Griffin would transform into an elite stretch big....
"lol idk bcs westbrook is washed, but not as washed as blake griffin. I think russ can make it to an all star team if he plays great."
Chris Paul is so much more likeable since he left the Clippers.  So are Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan.  Just how much of an asshole is Doc Rivers?
Make Blake Griffin Again
can confirm. I don't think we're ever in a position to win most close games because the team just isn't good enough. I've said we're 1 non-washed Blake Griffin away from being too good for our own future.
Blake Griffin on his way
Lakers fans so insecure and thin-skinned LOL. this guy really came in here crying about a chip after losing to Mason plumlee and the corpse of Blake griffin 😂
"Blake Griffin is shooting 43% from three when he's shooting at least 8 threes a game. He's left open on the perimeter a lot, he can't attack the basket anymore, his legs are done.   #TURN BLAKE GRIFFIN INTO PRIME JR SMITH"
Blake Griffin only takes 8 or more threes in a game when his shot is falling. Which it often hasn’t been this season
Blake 'Danny Curry Green Steph' Griffin
"Blake griffin, sniper first class"
Lakers really let a washed up Blake Griffin look great again
LAKERS: *exist*  BLAKE GRIFFIN: ...and I took that personally
"He really is though. People will shit on Blake Griffin all day but if the offer had come to that respective individuals team, they would take him. I definitely wouldn't mind him on the Warriors."
Hey we're at least trying to win.   You guys are trading away Rose and buying out Blake Griffin.
I knew Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan are still friends. People made it seem they aren't friends anymore since they don't publicize their friendship anymore
But the Nets got Blake Griffin
"ehhh I think this is pushing it. Who on the Nets is tight with Blake? Deandre? Deandre is not calling the shots in this organization lol.  if this was another case of the players strong-arming the organization into making a signing (which absolutely was the case with Deandre) with no chance of cutting him, I think they would've at least used one of their exceptions so that from a financial perspective it's not as easy to just dump Griffin if he's not producing.  also remember with Deandre they literally had to sign him to get KD/Kyrie to agree to come here. What leverage do the stars have in this case lol? You think they are just gonna stop playing unless the Nets sign Blake Griffin? As dramatic as these guys can get, I don't see that happening lol  all that being said, this is still a pointless signing that will almost certainly not help the team"
Blake Griffin doesn’t even help a local YMCA team right now.
"You're clearly not getting it. Yes, the Pistons can say ""Hey, we don't want you on this team any more. We'd like to develop some young guys."" Blake says ""Ok. I'll just collect $75Million over the next two years unless you buy me out.""  He then gets bought out to become a FREE AGENT in charge of wherever he wants to go AND he got paid $62Million to do it.  The only leverage the Pistons have over Blake is that they can sit him out. That's it. And they'd have to pay Blake his entire remaining contract to NOT PLAY. I'm really not sure what about ""Griffin has all the leverage"" you're not understanding."
"The sub doesn't hate Blake Griffin. If you've watched any Pistons games in the last few months (I don't suggest watching us) though, you'd know how past it he is."
"Why are you adding Blake and Jordan when they are way past their prime? To prop Lebron up?. A team of KD/ Harden/ Kyrie is comparable to Lebron/AD. Its not like its a huge difference and lots of people now will still take Lakers over Nets because of defense. Stop acting like Blake ""Washed"" Griffin joining the Nets tipped the Scale in any way, If he joined the Lakers instead would this be the Narrative?"
"That's what I don't really get.   Green has been playing very well in the backup 4/small ball 5 role, the one that Griffin will allegedly play. Unless Blake plays a lot better than he has been, he's not better than Green (as crazy as it may sound).  Then there's also Claxton who can get wide open dunk after wide open dunk on offense playing with Harden and the others, and is way more mobile on defense.  I think this was way more of a players getting their friend a contract thing than it is an actual basketball thing."
"Chris Paul denies player option, signs with BKN on vet min. BKN signs Drummond to vet min, Dinwiddies returns from injury. Imagine that   James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Joe Harris  Kevin Durant  Andre Drummond  Bench mob:  CP3  Dinwiddie  Bruce Brown  Blake Griffin  Claxton     the dankest timeline"
"damn i was just listing off the roster. i get it, the sub hates blake griffin."
"I know Blake seems pretty washed but I think people are still underestimating him. He will be 4th option at best, and when your 4th option has the bball iq that Griffin does, your team will benefit. Not too dissimilar from Marc Gasol’s current role with the Lakers."
"Injuries are the main reason of concern, but for everybody.  I feel Joel is still improving a lot compared to the player he was just 1-2 years ago, so I can see him still getting better.  On the other side I feel Giannis is entering his prime because I'm skeptical about him getting much better than this.  I mean, unless he build a reliable shot this is the player we'll see at his peak and his peak will be him being like now, but more confident and smarter because of more experience.  Embiid tho really made improvements. His shot is not the same he had 1-2 years ago. He's deadly now and who knows, can even improve. That's why maybe he's not in his prime yet.  If injuries happens then it's not on the player and like in Blake Griffin case or even more in Rose's case, their prime will be a 1 year season, or even something that never existed as for Rose."
"When you've got [career earnings of over $200 mil](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/brooklyn-nets/blake-griffin-6501/cash-earnings/), I'm sure you could give up $13 million to chase a ring in Brooklyn. I know I would."
"Huh, Blake Griffin isn’t Andre Drummond... big yikes when it comes to our centre’s."
"Yeah, huge Blake Griffin fan, but I didn’t really like how he did that to a trainer."
"Imagine having Steve Nash, Steve Blake, and Blake Griffin ALL on one sideline...."
2021 blake griffin that just got bought out... the guy is in decline and i get it if he wants to win
Yeah even that.  Blake Griffin is out of the league unless he completely turns it around in New York.   He literally has no positive qualities as a basketball player at this point.
"Blake Griffin is not an MLE caliber guy.  Maybe the Nets get lucky and he rejuvenates a little bit from the spacing he'll have, but he is atrocious."
"plus he’s good friends with Kyrie, and can reunite with former Pistons Blake Griffin and Bruce Brown"
"Yes but he’s also never played with LeBron. If Kevin Love and Chris Bosh (all-nba players) needed a year to gel, Drummond can’t do it in a few months.  At least he’s succeeded with Blake Griffin so maybe that’ll translate to AD??"
Who knew that Kevin Love and Blake Griffin would both fall off the cliff at the same time?
There are 3 important numbers to know:  109 mil: “cap”  133 mil: “luxury tax line”  139 mil: “tax Apron” aka the Hard Cap.   You have the option to go as far ahead of luxury tax as you want and penalties go up- but for the most part you can only resign your own players (this is basically Something called Bird Rights). If you use an exemption to get another player (free agent and not trade) then you get restricted to the the Hard Cap aka the Tax Apron line (the Celtics used the MLE to get Tristan Thompson this year and so they are hard capped). Though if you are above the luxury tax line you can still sign veteran minimum players (Nets and Blake griffin for example). The league set it up for you to basically keep your players and if you go over (so the Warriors are about 40 mill above the tax line and are paying like 80 mill in “taxes” and so that you extra money goes towards the teams below the “luxury tax line” as a reward. Nets and Warriors and all the other expensive big baller teams are funding the rest of the financially responsible teams
I've always like Blake and respected how he has worked on his game.  I really hope he was dogging the hell out of it in Detroit (who frankly would get more long term out of him sucking than out of him pushing to be great again).  Although the idea of even 70% of Blake Griffin on the current Nets is a little bonkers.
&gt;Even the worst Blake Griffin is better than those guys.  you haven't watched blake griffin the last two years. he's on his way out of the league.
blake griffin is a bad player. this doesn't add anything to them being a super team.
"Play him at the 5 and you’re losing games, guaranteed.   Griffin was our #1 tank commander, we threw him in games we were leading &amp; he single handedly lost them. Shoutout Blake"
That's all the proof I need.   Blake Griffin hype train leaving the station *choo choo*
Blake Griffin is definitely not a good locker room presence guy. He's a certifiable asshole through and through.
"&gt; Even the worst Blake Griffin is better than those guys.  As a Pistons fan, I can confidently inform you that Jeff Green is considerably more effective at NBA basketball than Blake Griffin.   &gt; People need to realize that this team is better with Blake than without him  That remains to be seen. The Pistons are one of the worst teams in the NBA, yet they were better without him than with him."
But the situation is totally different. Diaw’s comparison for me is more like Nic Batum then Blake griffin. Griffin is derailed by injuries not motivation
"I honestly thought there wasn’t much chance of Drummond getting bought out, but after the Blake Griffin buyout....anything is possible."
"KD is getting a bit too much rest. His return from the worst injury in basketball was way better than expected, maybe a bit too good. Nobody, literally nobody returned from it whole in the modern game, something gives.  Maybe the extreme caution the Nets show is ""good sense"", or maybe that is the new normal. I.e. KD is now injury prone and every time he returns , he is a bit less than how he was before. A bit of how Blake Griffin lost his peak performance (injury, after injury, after injury).  Warriors KD is Prime KD, he was two way and dependable. This one? It remains to be seen (still).  I do agree about Kyrie and Harden though. In fact KD's condition (IMO) would be the difference maker between 2004/2013 LA vibes (stacked teams but only on paper) and 2017 Warriors (an actually stacked team)."
Imagine having a front court of Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan five years ago
the addition of Blake Griffin does not make this a super team have you seen the man play over the last couple of years? he is most likely gonna come off the bench for 15-20 mins max and be a bit contributor
"Here's my take. I don't think we're going to see the old Blake Griffin, because anyone who watched any minute of him playing saw that he had a serious decline in athleticism. What Blake mainly tried to do with the Pistons is to be passer and a playmaker, shoot the 3 and take high quality shots.   All of those abilities translate well with the Nets. Adding an extra layer of good passing, and playmaking will only make the current Nets offense even more deadly and efficient; the shooting numbers in Detroit were awful for Blake, but I do think they will improve, because he has now Durant, Harden and Irving.  What Blake doesn't bring to the Nets is defence, rebounding or any inside presence both offensively and defensively. But again, he will mainly play for 20-25 minutes a game and will take Jeff Greens, Reggie Perry and Claxton minutes. Even the worst Blake Griffin is better than those guys.  People need to realize that this team is better with Blake than without him, but anyone who expects that Blake Griffin will bring this team over the top then I have some bad news for you."
"Imagine having to be a Brooklyn fan right now, what an absolutely embarrassing group of players put together.   Kevin ""Lemme just join the best team so I can check this box"" Durant  James ""We've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas, I give up"" Harden  Kyrie ""I'm an Actual Genius"" Irving  Blake ""Detriot? More like Deez Nuts, lemme know when the game is over"" Griffin  Thank god for the people of NY the Knicks are playing well right now."
"I mean they needa start getting chemistry as a whole. KD only played like half the games, Blake griffin needs to be integrated, and if Drummond comes then him too; in only 36 games"
"no player except griffin over 6'7 has failed to try at least one dunk this season let that sink in  shooting 37%, free throw rate down to 3.1 per game, 0.1 bpg, damian lillard is averaging more, and he's listed generously at 6'2 trea young averages more too, listed at 6'1 Chris Paul, aged 35 and listed at 6'1, is averaging more. all 6'3 and 120 pounds of stephen curry is outrebounding blake   advanced stats indicate that he's below replacement level this year. safely below meaning that a random G league guy would be better than griffin atm"
"You “might” be able to slide Blake Griffin in there if he can contribute. I’m expecting more of a 15pts 5rbs type of average from him if he starts.  With that said, I don’t agree with OP."
"Eh, I think you’re over thinking it. All these guys have huge egos. Blake Griffin will know his place but Drummond won’t? The team knows Harden, Kyrie, and KD are running the offense.                                               And the worst case scenario if Drummond starts acting like a fool is that they sub him out. It would be amazing if he waited until the finals to try it though."
"Is this still true? It’s hard to believe for me, only because you figure it would have randomly happened by now.   If you told me 5 years ago that Draymond Green would still be dunking and Blake Griffin couldn’t, I bet a lot of fans would have downvoted me into the night."
Blake Griffin isn’t going to help the Nets at all
"The Golden State Warriors reportedly have interest in a trade for Victor Oladipo, according to Kevin O'Connor of The Ringer.  O'Connor noted this shows the team's plans to add another ball-handler in the mold of Andre Iguodala or Shaun Livingston, who each played key roles during the team's three NBA titles.  Oladipo has appeared in 15 games with the Houston Rockets since coming over in a January trade from the Indiana Pacers, averaging 19.9 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.7 assists with his new team.  The 28-year-old is set to become a free agent in the offseason.  Several big names have already changed teams this season, including James Harden heading to the Brooklyn Nets as part of a blockbuster four-team deal and Derrick Rose returning to the New York Knicks from the Detroit Pistons.   The Pistons are keeping Blake Griffin on the bench for the time being as they continue to explore trade opportunities for the six-time All-Star. The Cleveland Cavaliers are also holding Andre Drummond out of games in hopes of dealing him.   Teams will try to pursue other impact players such as Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine ahead of the March 25 deadline, while a young playmaker like Lonzo Ball or veteran role players like JJ Redick, George Hill and P.J. Tucker could all be on the move to help contenders.  For more NBA coverage, check out B/R's surprise landing spots for the league's top trade targets.

"I felt this way when the NBA rolled out ""The official car of the NBA"" for Blake to dunk over. Griffin didn't even deserve to be in the final round, but the judges had to push him through to get that commercial revenue.  AG and Lavine brought back real excitement for the dunk contest. Even with the butchering of last year's results, I still thought last years was great too... Sucks for AG, but Jones Jr. is a high flyer, and a fantastic dunker too.  Maybe some guys will bring that back again in the future. This year was not that year.  Just want to also throw out there: It's really hard to get hype with no fans. The dunk contest needs those reactions."
"Only for the rest of the year on a min contract. The only teams trading for him are contenders who want his bird rights to sign him when they're over the cap, but I don't see any contending team wanting to assemble a package worth 28m or whatever he's on at the moment to match salaries. I guess maybe Boston can do it a lot easier with the trade exception if they throw in some picks but I'm not even sure how the laws behind exceptions work so I might be completely off.   Any non contending team below the cap who might be interested will just wait until he's a free agent. He certainly isn't worth 28 million a year but it's not like he is Blake Griffin and his stock has just entered a completely fatal nose dive and is on the point of been out of the league next year. Drummond will still make 10 to 12 mil a year on his next contract."
BAHAHAHAHHA Pardon me I had to laugh for that now get the fuck outta here with ya washed up blake griffin  #BAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Fucking casuals thinking that Blake Griffin makes a real difference to the Net’s odds
Y’all bout to watch the dead corpse of Blake griffin do absolutely fucking nothing for the team
"Because the name ""Blake Griffin"" probably rings some bell in the mind of the most casual fans."
Because fans are incapable of understanding that a once great player can be broken past the point of no return.  This move is really only interesting because of the name involved.  Substitute any other wildly inefficient 12/5 guy who can't defend and nobody blinks.  This is a lot closer to acquiring Cedi Osman than it is to acquiring the player formerly known as Blake Griffin.
"Yeah they’re thinking it’s all star Blake griffin still, he’s a completely different player now than he was even just 2 seasons ago."
"&gt;You don't take away previous dunk contest winner accolades away when people can't dunk anymore,  Damn right! *Blake Griffin voice*"
"Blake Griffin hasn't been good for a few years lol, this sub acting like the Nets just got another God."
LMAO that guy really made a career out of catching lobs from the POINT GOD blake griffin and deandre jordan
"I hope Blake Griffin plays really well on the Nets! Unfortunately, his knees don't look healthy at this point in his career :("
Blake Griffin has a receding career line.
"what wins in a race, the Turbocharged Kia K5 or the near-amputee Blake Griffin?"
Blake Griffin bout to be having second thoughts after that lol
No. It’s honestly fine.  I think some of us are just annoyed by the reaction from a lot of fans who seemingly aren’t aware what Blake Griffin is these days
Remember when Blake Griffin jumped over a Kia? Now he needs a lift to get into the Sorento.
"Y’all got jokes? What are you, Blake Griffin?"
"Carrying a mop, now that Blake is on the team. And by mop, I mean that Blake Griffin is the mop. Old and washed."
"Giannis is setting an all star game record for point efficiency. Meanwhile, the janitors haven't seen floors so clean on account of Blake Griffin is on mop duty."
Rumor has it that Blake Griffin was invited to the ASG to mop the locker room floors.
Rumor has it that Blake Griffin is mopping locker rooms
"Im not an old head, I started watching the NBA seriously in ‘06, but fuck if I don’t have awesome memories of the Dwight Howard-Nate Robinson-Blake Griffin era of dunk contests. We need to get back to (at least!) when even when the dunks weren’t incredible the hype was supremely entertaining."
I did include accolades and history for a reason. Anthony Bennett is not nor was the equivalent of a Blake griffin(in any stage of his career). We’ve yet to see how Blake is going to play in. System where he’s not the main attraction. Don’t be surprised if we see some form of his allstar days since defensive attention will be scarce.
"Physically, he's destroyed, but the skillset remains. I'm intrigued to see point forward Blake Griffin in a team that can motivate him. If he can be relatively healthy and playing 15 or 20 minutes a game, it could be very interesting."
Brother have you seen Blake Griffin play in the last two years? He stopped playing for the Pistons of all teams and the team got better instantly lmao
Especially lame the year he “coached” Blake Griffin 🤣
Stacked? I swear before the season so many people thought it wasn't going to work because Kyrie is toxic while Harden is a choker and ball hog. Oh and KD is coming off injury.   Now Blake Griffin who most in this sub forgot he even was in the NBA is going to make this team greater.
Dunk contest was legitimately better when blake griffin was jumping over  a pt cruiser or whatever
"LeBron wins title in 2016  *Kevin Durant joins Steph, Klay, Draymond etc   LeBron wins title in 2020 *team of Kevin Durant, Kyrie, Harden, Blake Griffin forms  The other players in the league know the lengths they have to go to, to defeat this man. 18th season btw.  GOAT."
The Nets just signed Blake Griffin; there's room for you in the league.
"Best slam dunk performance I ever saw was Javale McGee that year that it was rigged for Blake Griffin  dude straight up dunked three basketballs at one point, and then brought out a whole separate basketball hoop beside the main one and dunked on them both in one jump, it was insane"
"Bring out the corpse of Blake Griffin, if he can dunk at all, give him the trophy"
I hate prop dunks. Theyve ruined the dunk contest. Dwight Howard and Blake Griffin ruined the dunk contest
This man really said Blake Griffin makes the nets a 4 headed monster smh
"I feel like Blake Griffin doesn't really move the needle much. Like, they've been amazing already but BG hasn't really shown any reason to think he'll be more than a solid role player atm"
That’s “nba superstar” Blake griffin according to EJ
What did they just say about Blake Griffin?
Blake Griffin with the nets what?!?
bruh did he just called the Nets a “four headed monster” because of Blake Griffin
"Im talking about the nets can sign another good player like drummond in the buyout market, that moves blake griffin to the pf position, and lets be honest, he is better than claxton how has never been in the playoffs and is too skinny to play pf and c , griffin is also better than jeff green  if you think blake griffin doesnt help the nets bench , you're severly mistaken"
Many years ago John Wall bounced an alley oop pass to Blake Griffin and I've always wanted to see that again.
Zion “Blake griffin” Williamson
Zion dunking like present Blake Griffin 😂
Uhhh have you watched Blake Griffin this season??
Double Cross with Blake Griffin premieres March 19 on truTV
Oh shit. Blake griffin got a show?
Blake griffin starring in the usual suspects
What a fucking world we live in that Blake Griffin is drawing comparisons to Nic Batum
He accepted a min contract... I am positive every team in the league going to the playoffs would welcome Blake Griffin on a min
"Imagine Blake Griffin taking as many charges as Ersan does, Blake would be in a wheelchair by now."
"Get me a Blake Griffin x Impractical Jokers crossover for the season finale, tru TV!"
Honestly Blake Griffin is pretty funny. His one stand-up he did was decent
"KD, Kylie, harden, AND Blake griffin. Wtf lol"
"Both outstanding players whom injuries still played a significant role in their career trajectory and left you wondering what couldve been.   Both were also unique talents, underrated and overly criticized in big markets for much of their careers. People just didnt like them, which even if people forget now was 100% true for Blake Griffin in LAC."
"KD, Kyrie, and fucking Harden on the same team is so cheesy. Legit two MVP candidates, top 5 players in the Association and a legit All-star in Irving. And then they added former all-stars in Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Alridge who have shown they still have some gas in the tank? If that team is healthy, how can anyone beat them in a seven-game series?!?"
David West  Blake Griffin  James Harden  Sam Presti (TEAM)  Devin Booker
"Kill me...  I just want to watch my team lose with young guns learning, scoring, making mistakes...  But no, all i got is Cory Joseph show, single handling stoping our choking.  Fuck man, let me lose, Fuck Blake Griffin too"
The Blake griffin meteor throw dunk  Disgusting
"In this Blake Griffin is leaning his arms forward over Zion at exactly 1 min in.  They are literally over Zion's head, and contact is made during a shot attempt. Clear blocking foul per rule of verticality.  They need to do something to enforce the rules more consistently, or change the rules so that they can be more consistent while being fair to offensive and defensive players."
"&gt; in his age 21 season which barely any players have done  Here's the list of players I found in the top 10 of the nba in their 21 year old season, this means I'll ignore players who weren't even playing at 21 like Wilt but, hey, just keeping the theme  MJ (rookie) 28/6/6 - 6th mvp voting  LeBron (year 3) 31/7/6 - 2nd in MVP voting  Duncan (rookie) 21/12/2 - 5th in MVP voting  Magic Johnson (year 2) injured during the season but he still got 11th in voting only playing 37 games so he probably would've been much higher  Kevin Durant (year 3) 30/7/3 - 2nd in MVP voting  Shaq (year 2) 29/13/2 - 4th in MVP voting  Tracy McGrady (year 4) 27/7/4 - 6th in MVP voting  Blake Griffin (rookie) 22/12/3 - tied for 10th in MVP voting  So fantastic company, really"
"I feel really bad for you guys, because Blake made it seem like he would never physically be able to dunk again. At least people knew Aldridge is still good, but Blake griffin tricked y’all"
Don’t be shocked if he starts dunking like Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin just gave up 30M. You never know.
Nets have 4 or 5 with Dinwiddie  Blake Griffin is an elite playmaker for his size and the big 3 + Dinwiddie
If you put KD on CP3’s clippers instead of Blake Griffin they would make it just as far. I’m not discrediting Russ but you can’t compare OKC to the Clippers while ignoring KD. We saw what Russ did in the playoffs when he was the #1 option
Blake ‘The Possum - get me the fuck out of Detroit’ Griffin
"Gotta feel bad for the Kings. They haven't finished a season over .500 since 2006.  For clarification, that was LeBron's first year in the playoffs.   Chris Paul, Derron Williams, and Andrew Bogut made the All-Rookie team that year.   Clifford Robinson and Kevin Willis were still kicking around.   LaMarcus Aldridge, Kyle Lowry, and J. J. Reddick weren't even in the league at that time.   Al Horford and Joakim Noah were teammates in college. Kevin Durant was a year away from declaring for the draft.   Derrick Rose was still in high school.   Blake Griffin was 5 years away from playing his first NBA game.   Antony Davis was still in GRADE school.   Luka would have been in the second grade!  LaMelo Ball would have been in pre-school.  &amp;#x200B;  THAT'S how long it has been since the Kings were over .500.   &amp;#x200B;  :-("
I see Blake Griffin is back to getting hyped for doing the bare minimum.
"I know it's Blake Griffin and he's old and hasn't done this in a while, but wild that we get this hype about a PF dunking a wide open cut  not tryna be a hater, just saying there are a lot of dudes in the league who wouldn't get this highlight just for doing this"
"Hearing Zach Lowe try to pretend like he’s not ready to call this a bad trade for the Rockets yet is hilarious. Hell, all the talking heads make their money by people being interested in the season. And they know full and well they can’t be like “Well yeah everyone of course the Nets are going to win this whole season is already over.” Because that hurts their ratings. So they all do this song and dance about one ball or Blake Griffin being totally washed. And yet nobody can beat the Nets even missing their best players. Call it what it is. This season is over. Time to look forward to the offseason."
"Say what you want about him in Detroit, but I'm really happy to see a healthy Blake Griffin dunk again"
"But he's not an all-nba player. This is no different than a ring chasing vet, you really think Blake Griffin should be payed like an all-nba player?"
"Nah. Pistons fans are likely the only folks who've watched Pistons games for the better part of the past 10 years so we understood Andre Drummond's nuanced issues while everyone else was trumpeting his points and rebounds stats and we understood Blake's travails and role differential when everyone was trumpeting his rebirth in Brooklyn.   Detroit needed Blake to be their own Kyrie/Harden/Durant. He was expected to be a playmaker and shot-maker from the high post and perimeter his entire time here. He *was* the Pistons offense. When healthy, that meant an All-NBA Third Team carry job (and only 37 dunks due to the nature of his play style). When coming off of a calendar year without NBA playing experience, that meant dude was struggling to make it through 30+ minutes a night while taking shortcuts to conserve energy (higher volume perimeter shooting, cutting corners on hustle) while *still* trying to shoulder the Pistons' offense.   The writing had been on the wall for some time. We knew All-NBA Blake was gone. The Pistons were in complete rebuild mode and Griffin wasn't a part of that future. He had no trade value on account of his contract ($35 million per year). I'd imagine the majority of Pistons fans are unmoved by his waiving and effort in limited minutes in Brooklyn."
"Call the police, Blake Griffin has robbed the Detroit Pistons"

"Yup. Even as a high volume player at full health in 2019, Griffin only had 37 dunks, because he was shouldering the Pistons' entire offense from the high post and perimeter all season (and did an incredible job, hence the All-NBA Third Team honor).   Blake couldn't play off of guys like Chris Paul, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, or Kevin Durant in Detroit. Instead, we kind of needed and expected him to be all of those dudes on his own."
Blake Griffin was the first overall pick in the nba draft. Safe to assume we live different lives with different value on money.
"Of course. He was probably protecting his body. The Pistons were very clear about developing the younger guys this year aka tanking. Blake took a lot of the younger guys under his wing and mentored them and took on a major leadership role for the team. I’m sure a buyout has been discussed light years before it was even announced to the public. So, predictably, he decided to take care of his body but still own his leadership role. Also, like you said Blake wasn’t yamming on dudes in Detroit and he’s still Blake-freaking-Griffin there’s gotta be juice in there somewhere to still throw down. Not to mention a 6-9 NBA player. It’s very typical of players of his stature to dunk, especially on wide open baskets like this instance."
Are you sure the bucks will be able to figure out how to defend Blake Griffin?
Blake Griffin can still dunk?
"I'm not a Pistons fans but the obligatory ""lol Pistons"" post on every Blake Griffin play is so annoying. I can't imagine how annoying it'd be if I was a fan.  People act like Blake Griffin isn't getting much easier looks now with the Nets. He's wide open during most of his highlights. That wasn't happening on the Pistons. He was posting up and isolating (and doing a poor job of it) on the Pistons. He's got open 3s, open cutting lanes, dump passes, etc from playing next to 2 top 5-10 and Kyrie who's at least top 20 this year. Also, Joe Harris who is one of the best shooters in the league.   Sure, Blake is playing better and harder now but it's not like he's anywhere near what he used to be because he gets a highlight or two. I'd even argue that he's probably not even a better player than before.. He's playing very well in a limited role on a contender. He played poorly as one of the primary options on a bad team."
Blake Griffin is the grandpa joe of the NBA
"Everyone knew there was potential for a Blake Griffin trade. No trade clauses exist for a reason, and Blake didn't have one for a reason."
"That's so fucked. So in a buyout, players can choose to go wherever they want? Or were there no other teams that made offers do Blake Griffin and LMA?"
"Hold on, we still had a bunch of randoms for bench/role players. The Nets have LMA still making big plays, as well as Blake Griffin dunking and making 3s ffs. You can't tell me you really think our bench during our brief run is even close to the quality of the Nets bench. And please don't tell me you think Kyrie, KD, and Harden are somehow equal or worse than Curry, Klay and Dray. I love my Warriors but even I'm not that stupid.  Plus, as other said, our big three was drafted. Nets somehow built this team through players forcing trades and buyouts, and I don't really think that's comparable to how the Warriors did jt"
"Man, I want to lol but that's literally how my pug is these days... Back legs hardly work (nerve problems, so he isn't in any pain, thankfully) but he is still trying. I hope one day he wakes up and tells me he was trolling me like Blake Griffin was the Pistons."
"I argue that it puts pressure on owners to spend money on putting out a more competitive product to keep players like Blake Griffin happy.  Blake might have not done this if he was on a semi competitive team.  And for the record, Blake signed a contract with the Clippers, not the Pistons. Dude maybe never thought in a million years he was going to be playing in Detroit.   And quite frankly, if he's still hurt and playing through pain now because he has an opportunity to win, then I think this even furthers his case. Would you potentially risk your future health and living a pain free life in retirement if you had no chance of winning a championship? Honest question. I deal with back pain on almost a daily basis, but I guarantee it isn't as bad as an athlete's pain from the wear and tear that comes from jumping, running, and landing constantly with a 6'8"" 245lb frame. If I was guaranteed my salary, I would have mailed it in to avoid the back pain I now currently have at just the age of 29. I didn't have that luxury though. So I had to work through this shit, but I wouldn't chronic pain on anyone."
When the nets acquired Blake griffin I saw a comment on this sub that said “the pistons are gonna sue his knees if he dunks the ball for them” and they honestly should.
Did Blake Griffin write this?
"This shit used to happen to young Blake Griffin, and in the end he fucking complained about every call for years and years. We don't want that shit for Joker, man."
Payton was 35 and Malone 40. They also had a 38yo Horace Grant and a 33yo Byron Russell.   LMA is 35 and Blake Griffin is 31.
“Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated” -Blake Griffin hearing about how he cannot dunk
I mean. You don’t HAVE too.... being salty has its benefits. Maybe the basketball gods will be fueled by your chants of “Fuck Blake Griffin”! And will derail the Nets this postseason. Godspeed Coltmanfraco!!!! Let the salt pour!!!
Blake Griffin trick(ed) y’all man.
"I don’t gotta respect the act. It’s not hard to keep up not dunking lmao. This dude played like shit for the Pistons and did a complete 180 and said “haha lol JK I actually could have been playing the entire time fuck you” in the literal first game he played.   This is just extra fuel lmao, fuck Blake griffin."
It feels good seeing Blake Griffin go fucking hard again. No more point forward.
"I’ll call it how it is: Blake Griffin defrauded the pistons. They  paid him huge money because they signed a deal for BLAKE GRIFFIN. Not some freakish sized Kelly Olynk, but what did they get? They got a sorry low effort Blake Griffin playing at the level of my man Kelly Buckets (don’t y’all disrespect him either-KO gets fucking *buckets*).   Blake literally conned the detroit pistons for that money and I’d be salty if I was a fan. Y’all coulda been paying that to Reggie Jackson (lol) but for real though, Blake is a bitch for this."
"I don't care to be honest.  Not sure why my fellow Pistons fans are mad.  He didn't want to be here because we suck, can't blame him.  And he never really felt comfortable since LAC betrayed him in a way.  Now he's playing for a team that will likely win it all so he's excited.  Makes sense.  Its not like we were a ""Blake Griffin"" away from a title, we have a lot of REBUILDING to do.  And the Nets were likely going to win without Blake anyway."
"""Cutter? OOOOH BLAKE GRIFFIN, OLD SCHOOL"" ""Cutter? OOOOH BLAKE GRIFFIN, OLD SCHOOL"" ""Cutter? OOOOH BLAKE GRIFFIN, OLD SCHOOL"""
Blake Griffin trick y'all
"I believe them. Every single Blake Griffin thread is filled with people pushing this belief that Pistons fans hate him. And every thread has Pistons fans replying to those comments that they don’t really care or that they’re even happy for him.   I just looked at the Pistons sub and, sure enough, that’s true. Most of them don’t hate him."
When did Blake griffin become old school or Vince carter lol.
"Man idk how you Detroit fans feel but I’d pretty much hate Blake Griffin at this point if i were in your shoes. Obviously he’s going to try harder now that he’s on a contender, but he was basically a walking corpse on the court for you guys before the trade."
"Jordan is washed, they've cut his minutes completely since Lemarcus was signed. Blake Griffin off the bench has provided the insane depth, with the 0.69 effectiveFG %"
As a Detroit fan. This is the bullshit. You ain’t never seeing Blake griffin pull off two dunks in a season with a pistons uniform on.
"Real competitors don't have that Blake Griffin type mentality. He should (and probably does) look at it as a challenge still every time he's on the court. Who cares if the team isn't good, you can still help make them better and you get paid to do it too. Be professional."
"say, this blake griffin fella aint bad."
"""I ain't Blake Griffin I don't drive no Kia"" Gucci mane 2017"
"Twice in his comment he stated emphatically that Blake Griffin has not dunked once as a Piston. It went beyond exaggeration:  &gt;I get being demoralized on the team for losing so much and protecting yourself from injury due to over-aggressive plays, but **zero dunks**?!"
"Like when Jamal Crawford  traveled when he threw that oop to Blake griffin. As the kings guy says, you don't like nba basketball if you would rather there have been a travel called here in a blowout game with no defenders near 2 players"
You clearly have no idea what his contract looked like. Nets Blake Griffin could maybe demand 10 million on the open market. To trade his contract you would 100% have to give up assets. He did them a favor because he gave back millions but it was more mutually beneficial tbh.
Blake Griffin also used to act like he couldn’t jump anymore
As if the Nets could get more unlikable. If I was a Detroit fan I would fucking hate Blake Griffin
"Normally buyouts are washed players, but this was highway robbery. Detroit was hoodwinked, bamboozled, led astray, run amuck and flat out deceived by Blake Griffin. My guy was running around with the Pistons like a 40-year old semi retired white guy and now he is dunking left and right as if he is with the Clippers.  Blake played hard the first year, but damn, didn't have to do the Pistons like that. Sucks that there's absolutely nothing the NBA can do about it."
Dwayne Casey: Jump Blake Griffin: No  Steve Nash: Jump Black Griffin: *How High*
I can’t believe Blake Griffin is on the Nets lol
He’s not even half a Lob City Blake Griffin
"Me when I realize I've been around long enough that a Blake Griffin dunk is ""Old School"""
Blake Griffin only went 19 games without a dunk for the Pistons.  Why does everyone act like it was his whole tenure?
"ah yes, that no name Blake Griffin  totally not one of the most popular players in the entire league for years"
Know when to walk away from a Blake griffin dunk
Blake Griffin used to destroy people. This isn’t a big dunk
It turns out that what Blake Griffin really needed all along was to give a shit 🤷‍♂️
"PJ tucker wasn’t making 30 mil lol, nobody is trading picks for blake on his old contract. They got griffin and aldridge for free because nobody wanted them"
I hate that we’re at the point now where you can see a video of Blake Griffin dunking and the call is “OLD SCHOOL”
Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge combine for 32 on 75% shooting: deepest team of all time
"durant was perfect from the field, didn't miss a single shot or free throw. Blake Griffin had a great game as well with 10 points, 4/6 fg, 2/4 3pt. LMA with a really efficient game too, 22pts, 8/12 fg, 2/2 3pt.  This Nets team is just an all-star roster. Kyrie, Harden, KD, Blake, LMA. With guys like Green, Brown, Harris, Claxton, Jordan to fill out the roster.   Good luck to everyone trying to beat this team. Unless they have a historic collapse, I don't see it happening, they will most likely win the title, and probably the next few titles as well."
Why do I see this stupid ass comment in ever Blake Griffin thread? Between Saddiq and Grant we are happy with our future moving forward.  Only thing most of us are pissed about is that Houston and Minnesota can't win a damn game. Somebody gonna catch this Fade for Cade
i mean as a pistons fan its not like blake griffin is setting worlds on fire lol. he is definitely a fucking shell of even his 2018/2019 pistons self. we wouldnt have been able to trade him anyway.
"Anyone who thought that Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge who were starters this season, and very recently All Stars would make no impact on the Nets as second string guys they got for free is an idiot."
Lip readers and Blake Griffin wya?
You know what would actually make me the happiest?  Blake Griffin winning FMVP.  Can you imagine the river of tears?
"Holy shit Blake Griffin straight up finessed the Pistons.  ""Oh man I can't jump anymore, you probably should just buy me out.""  ""Alrighty then Brooklyn, lemme remind you what lob city was like"""
Blake griffin getting a highlight clip tweet with a strongly worded caption to @ the pistons with as we speak
because you’re being very weird. players dont decide to go ahead and take the court even if the coach doesn’t put them in the line up. that’s what we’re talking about regarding blake griffin
"Insane how many people, pistons fans and nets fans as well, who tried to downplay the Blake Griffin signing (even the LMA signing). This is the most stacked offensive roster in history, this is a better offensive peak roster than the 2017 warriors imo.   The defense will the issue for them, but when they’re blowing every team out like this, who cares about the defense? It would have to be a shocking collapse for them to lose in the finals, or lose before getting there."

"Blake Griffin and lamarcus aldridge are not currently stars, are you okay?"
"It’s crazy that they are doing this while only having Kevin Durant, Kyrie, Blake Griffin who can suddenly play again, Aldridge, Joe Harris and other solid role guys."
"I'm truly flabbergasted, in the full sense of the word, that people are surprised that Blake Griffin can still dunk."
Tomorrow: Blake Griffin out for load management
This Blake griffin dunking saga has to be the strangest thing I’ve seen in a while
"blake griffin performed the most advanced tank of all - the self tank, where you reduce your trade value so you can get signed to a contending team that's running out of cap space"
All my homies hate Blake Griffin
Wow Blake Griffin was really doggin it in Detroit huh?
Blake griffin is literally the devil
I bet Pistons fans fucking hate the way Blake Griffin is playing after watching him play like a bum a couple months ago. I couldn’t blame them tbh.
Blake Griffin just hated Detroit and you can't blame him
Blake griffin being up there is unexpected
“Great defense by Blake Griffin.”  You mean like blatantly fouling Zion and not getting called for it?
"The traditional power forward, who did the dirty work and shot 15-18 ft jumpers with a little bit of post offense. Think Horace Grant, Dale Davis, PJ Brown, Tyrone Hill, etc. In today's league, either you are big enough that you're just a center now (Derrick Favors), you've expanded to the three point line (Blake Griffin, Paul Millsap), or both (Serge Ibaka). Or like AD, you just slide between the two positions."
"What are the additional filters picked to get it down to 200 players? Like I'm pretty sure Blake Griffin is still ahead of or near Lowry in charges drawn per game, but I don't see him in the data  Cool tool though."
(Top 20 HoF odds for current players)  1.	LeBron James	1.0000 2.	Chris Paul	1.0000 3.	Kevin Durant	1.0000 4.	James Harden	0.9997 5.	Stephen Curry	0.9996 6.	Russell Westbrook	0.9992 7.

"Two major things I think get overlooked by people who doubt the Nets.   Number One is that James Harden is an offense all by himself.. The idea there is no chemistry is a little overstated because Harden has the ability to just say I got everything and I'll get everyone their shots. And while the big 3 havent played much together, all the role players have with each guy, and there's no visible case of anyone not understanding their role, which brings me to number 2, their role players are kinda underrated.  Joe Harris you all already know and recognize what he brings  Blake Griffin is averaging 10/5/3 on 51/40/78 shooting. He serves as an additional playmaker and veteran presence that can knock down his shot.   Nicolas Claxton has been great. He's a very versatile big defensively and has really good on/off splits this season.   Bruce Brown is also a solid guy off the bench. Plays hard and solid defense and is a tremendous rebounder for a guard."
And dunked on prime Blake Griffin.
"if he can play at this level for the next 5 years, if not he's the next blake griffin :("
"Such a bullshit narrative. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving wanted to team up, and they thought they would cute in black and white. They also convinced James Harden and Blake Griffin to quit on their teams to come join the bandwagon. None of this has to do with skill on the part of the Nets' front office. As long as they were better than the Knicks, they were getting KD and Kyrie."
"They were 50 win teams because of CP3. Simple. Blake and deandre were talented. But they couldn't shoot. The lane was clogged at the end of games which in the modern NBA is just so hard to overcome in the 4th quarter. Those clippers teams were talented, but the way that roster was constructed was flawed.   If you replace Blake Griffin/DJ for Paul George for example, I think that would've solved so many problems for those clippers teams with spacing plus perimeter D."
Blake Griffin lost a step but he hustles. He’s taken more charges than any other player on the Nets since he’s got here. Constantly going to the floor for 50/50 balls. He’s been a pleasant surprise.   Claxton hasn’t played recently because he was out for over 2 weeks due to health and safety protocols (COVID).  They have been ramping up his minutes since he came back a couple of games ago. He will be a key piece in the playoff run.
Yes 6 time all star blake griffin plays decent as a 4th option on a minimum contract
Blake Griffin
Yeah that was when Blake Griffin had a season ending injury for the 2nd year in a row.  That series was CP3 + bums vs. Jazz and he still took them to 7 games by himself.
"Other than that blown 3-1 lead to the Rockets, not once can you really say CP3 lost a series his team was supposed to win. Also had to deal with himself or key teammates like Blake Griffin going down to injury. Individually, he is one of the most exceptional playoff performers of his generation as far as guards go."
"It's when you think / talk of / about someone / something non-stop, and there's a reason for that. Can be a crush. Can be hatred. There are feelings involved anyway.  It's not coincidental. **They're in your head.**  People think and talk about the Nets because they're the best NBA team right now. That doesn't mean they like or dislike them, it has nothing to do with their feelings. They just recognize that they're favorites to win the championship.  As I said, Blake Griffin = rent-free in my head. I fucking hate him. I see him smiling after a made 3 and I wanna punch the wall. The moment I hear the word ""Pistons"" I think of Blake Fuck That Flopper Griffin and he doesn't even play for the Pistons anymore. I read ""Chris Paul"" and I immediately make the connection to him throwing lobs for Blake in LA. In short, Blake lives rent-free in my head. I consider him to be a bad basketball player (in 2021) and I don't think he's a threat to my team. I just fucking hate him. I found out he leads the league in charges drawn yesterday and started hating him even more. Fuck Blake Griffin.  That's rent-free. People saying the Nets are gonna win or MJ is the GOAT are just stating facts."
"*Blake ""Clipper for Life"" Griffin has entered the chat*"
"I responded to the next comment of yours saying  &gt;I browse various team subreddits and they're always in the daily discussion threads  like this proves that they ""live rent-free..."", which is not the reason fans talk about them, as I already explained. Me being a Bucks fan has nothing to do with that. I even told you Blake Griffin lives rent-free in my head, hoping you're gonna understand the difference, but you failed again.  Oh and if you're gonna talk about fanbases gEtTiNg aNgRy, flair the fuck up. Peace!"
"&gt;they live rent free in a lot of people's heads  implies other stuff. For example, Blake Griffin does live rent free in my head - I fucking hate his flopping ass and I can't stand him, every time he's on the floor I just wanna see him fail.  The Nets as a team? Nah, I just realize they're gonna win a ring this year and I'm gonna mention that when discussing the playoffs / the Bucks' chances at a ring."
Players like Blake Griffin is a testament to the sad state of the NBA. Where an otherwise talented player is purposefully under-achieving in order to leave and join a super team because winning games alone is hard to do.
Blake Griffin is the hardest working player in the NBA.
"I think he was top 3 from 1992-93 until 1995-96. While MVP voting is sometimes good for judging the best few guys in the league, you shouldn’t take it as gospel. For example, Blake Griffin wasn’t a top 3 player in 2013-14, even though he finished third in voting that year. Same with Kawhi in 2015-16 when he finished second."
Did you see those Blake Griffin dunks last night? Lol
He has 5 more bad calls against him than for him. So do Blake Griffin and Wendell Carter.
&gt;Blake Griffin is a legend for this.   Saying this after a player wears McLovin themed kicks is the most Reddit shit ever
"Then take JJ’s words to heart. He even said he was naive. 3 years now, 2 contracts, he’s chased the bag. He’s 36, a buyout candidate. Why would teams give up something for him? It happened to Drummond. No one wanted to actually give up an asset to get him, he’s a buyout candidate. Same thing Blake Griffin.  He wanted to be traded to a preference? He didn’t hold up his side of the deal, he played like ass this season and killed his value. The Pels got an offer and took it and there’s nothing else to it. It’s a business. I’d want them to do that 10/10.   Any of this, oh look at how they treat their players, is stupid. Holiday was taken care of. Take RJ’s words - what has JJ done for the Pels that they should prioritize him over their own team?  JJ wants to be angry he should look at his own play dropping off a cliff."
"Blake Griffin made $34million this year with 170 made baskets. Around $200,000 per bucket"
If he was on the buyout market all the title contenders would have wanted him... I guess that makes Blake Griffin and Drummond not good also according to you. I’m guessing you only think star players are good at basketball.
"&gt;The Nets are built around Harden being their main playmaker, of course Harden would look much better when he is playing.  The only player they've added since trading for james harden is blake griffin. Meanwhile they've had KD/Kyrie under contract last two years. What makes you think the team is ""built around"" harden?  He jut figured it out there on the fly"
"People do mental gymnastics all the time to come up with the takes they want. It’s like think of their conclusion and then work backwards to justify it.   Yes Blake Griffin when he’s not a first option, playing limited minutes, with significantly improved facilitating and spacing will look a LOT better. That doesn’t mean dude was throwing for the Pistons."

"Currently, no NBA player who has ever won MVP has not been inducted into the Hall of Fame or been a basically guaranteed inductee once they become eligible (although Derrick Rose could be the first). With this list, that number would grow to at least four: Red Kerr, Terry Cummings, Penny Hardaway, and Jermaine O'Neal, in addition to the still-active Rose and maybe Blake Griffin."
I didn't watch the NBA in 2014. Was Blake Griffin really that good?
Yes considerably   6 years in LA together   Cp3 18.8 ppg 4.2 rpg 9.8 apg 2.2 spg   3x All-NBA 1st   5x All-NBA   6x Allstar   6x all-defensive 1st   2 top 5 MVP finishes   2x assists leader   3x steals leader   Blake Griffin   21.3 ppg 8.8 rpg 4.2 apg 1 spg   4x All-NBA   5x allstar   1 top 3 MVP finish   Deandre Jordan   10.6 ppg 12 rpg .8 apg 2 bpg   1x allstar   3x All-NBA   1x All-NBA 1st   2x All-Defense   2x Rebound leader    Only  jokic is going to make it close i don't see a scenario where Jamal Murray or MPJ are any where close to Griffin or Jordan
"Blake Griffin seems, after first glance, to be the only one that wouldnt feel right as an MVP"
"Nets are starting: Mike James, Landry Shamet, KD, Bruce Brown, Blake Griffin.    1st of all, ew   2nd of all... 6MOTY HARDEN IS BACK"
Blake griffin
Can't believe the Pistons bailed the Clippers out of that Blake Griffin contract when they clearly needed to tear it all down and tank.
"Blake Griffin and Tony Parker MVP, would look weird"
blake griffin? ugh....i like the old list better...
Blake Griffin in 2014 is very borderline as well
"2013	Carmelo Anthony   2014	Blake Griffin  That would be, in retrospect, a pretty sad run of MVPs. It would certainly vastly change the narrative of either player if they had won one, though. Blake especially, I think."
Blake Griffin and the damn injuries man 😭
I remember seeing Blake Griffin on one of those tonight show style shows and was amazed by how skinny he looked. These guys are so tall that even the Blake Griffins look skinny next to normal people.
"Tied with Blake Griffin and Wendell Carter, yes"
Yeah they can play some amazing offense when they are playing regular season defenses and don’t care they give up 130 points a game and relying on busted ass Blake Griffin and DJ for boards (if they even go for them).  We will see how all that goes on the playoffs when shots don’t fall as easy (even for the greats). And a first year coach. When fouls aren’t called and all that finesse ball stops working.  LOTS of questions fam. This ain’t the 2017 Warriors
That is a terrible argument. Hakeem is a hall of fame player. Blake Griffin is likely a hall of fame player. Andrew Wiggins is not. That is a very bad comparison to make.
They did something similar for Andre Miller when he ended his game streak trucking Blake Griffin.
"I've told this story here before, but I got a bootleg Blake Griffin jersey in 2014 and I never left this team since."
Duncan and especially Malone were very athletic when they came in the league. Not Blake Griffin athletic but still above average.
Blake Griffin   Leading the league in charges drawn this year and is the first one to dive on the ground always
youre Blake Griffin.......
No one talkin about that blake griffin shot hahah
Older brother was a LeBron fan. Watched some highlights with him and saw Blake Griffin dunking on fools during his rookie year. And then Lob City happened? Sheesh. EU btw
"This is actually really amazing. Check out the list from 10 years ago (2010-11 season):  1) Kevin Love: 15.2 (USA)  2) Dwight Howard: 14.1 (USA)  3) Zach Randolph: 12.2 (USA)  4) Blake Griffin: 12.1 (USA)  5) Kris Humphries: 10.4 (USA)  6) Pau Gasol: 10.2 (Spain)  7) David Lee: 9.8 (USA)  8) Al Jefferson: 9.7 (USA)  9) Emeka Okafor: 9.5 (USA)  10) Tyson Chandler: 9.4 (USA)  Okafor's parents are from Nigeria but he was born and raised in the USA and is an American citizen  Humphries only played 44 games, though—11th place w/ 77 GP was Al Horford, who is Dominican"
"kevin love, blake griffin, horford, millsap"
I saw blake griffin killing people on Youtube
"&gt;but Blake Griffin will fade into obscurity shortly after he hangs it up.  His highlight reel is too great for him to be forgotten, he's up there with Vince Carter as the goat in game dunker."
Blake Griffin
Not a current star but Blake Griffin will fade into obscurity shortly after he hangs it up.
2014 Blake Griffin but with more finesse and less bully-ball. Great faceup player that you could run your whole offense through
Find the opposite to be true. Athletic players tend to over-rely on that trait and don’t develop the fundamental abilities that carry them into old age with grace. Tim Duncan &amp; Karl Malone vs Blake Griffin or Dwight Howard.
"you'd be naive to think Klay Thompson, the second greatest shooter in the history of the NBA is not gonna be able to shoot anymore. sure his defense might be not be great anymore, but he's gonna be a dangerous shooter. look at KD who came back from an achilles this year and he's having his greatest shooting season yet. Klay will be fine, his game wasn't built around athleticism like a Blake Griffin or Derek Rose.   second, simple man, you're assuming the rookies are gonna be 19 years old. they could draft seniors for all you know or the 19 year olds could be ready to make an impact like Lonzo Ball. that's besides the point because the Warriors wont be giving the rookies anything more than 10-15 mins a game and even less in the playoffs. they're just gonna be providing some depth on the bench.   not too mention this is the first year playing together for the majority of these guys without an offseason to practice. they're gonna have way more chemistry next year and be a lot more comfortable in the system.   you're naive as a banana brain if you think the Warriors are gonna be an 8th seed again next year. you're gonna be the first one who says it's not fair that the Warriors are getting a lotto pick because they're team has too much talent when the Wolves pick conveys lol.  stupid lebron stan."
Blake Griffin couldn't (wouldn't) dunk in Detroit
I wouldn't say great but Blake Griffin looked like absolute trash in Detroit to at least being able to earn minutes in Brooklyn.
He played with Harden for 2 years (and had an insane record on the court together)  The rest of those guys should never be compared in the same sentence.  Like dude you’re genuinely comparing Paul George and Bradley Beal to Crawford and Stojakovic? Or 8 years of KD to Blake Griffin?  Im done here. You’re outta your mind
"He played with Harden, deandre Jordan, Blake griffin,  Crawford and Stojakavic. He's never elevated his play in the postseason and turned it over a bunch at the end of some of those playoff games"
"Maxi Kleber is stupid hot. Kelly Oubre and Ricky Rubio are really pretty. Kyle Lowry has that butt. Blake Griffin, I can't unassociate from his scene in Broad City."
"Right, David Lee is an even match for prime Blake Griffin"
"Yeah but this is a problem in basketball discourse, most talented player isn't necessarily best player.   KD was absolutely the most talented player on those Warriors teams, but that doesn't mean he was the best player.  The best player on a team is the most important player, the one that the team can't stomach their loss or they drastically suffer in terms of W/L record, the player that impacts winning the most. There was never a point in time where DeMar DeRozan was better than Kyle Lowry despite being more talented and putting up superior stats. There was never a point in time where Blake Griffin was better than Chris Paul despite being more talented and putting up superior stats, similar story with Devin Booker this year. Donovan Mitchell is not better than Mike Conley this season, despite being more talented and putting up superior stats.   KD has never impacted wins/losses as much as his reputation has suggested he has, the reason why nobody ever talks about it, is his most glaring weakness (playmaking and creating for others on offense) has been covered up by the fact that he's played with an MVP point guard for the entirety of his career who has fulfilled that role."
"LeBron is able to get healthy just in time for playoffs because his bones are infused with vibranium.  Harden on the other hand is because the Fountain of Youth is in Brooklyn, the same one that Blake Griffin used to revitalize his body when he first got there."
"Dude elbowed Blake Griffin in the head in 2013 and got ejected and had many other instances after that, well before his 2016 nut shots lol what a weird hill to die on.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk1fa17NQBY"
"Ben simmons was a rookie.. just like blake Griffin was when he won. A redshirt rookie, but that doesn't matter in the NBA. A rookie is a rookie."
"Eh. I’ll explain why I’m going smart. From the various warriors games I’ve watched, Drays playmaking is unquestionably some of, if not the best we’ve seen from a big (besides jokic), however his best playmaking trait is unequivocally his ability penalize teams for over commuting and doubling a teams star. As we’ve seen this year in games where Steph doesn’t play, Dray struggles to get going because the majority of his offense is predicated around exploiting the defense for overreacting to various action initiated by Steph, whether Steph is on or off ball (ex: warriors run their inverted floppy action where Steph sets a back screen for a player, defense overreacts and both jump to Steph so Dray hits a now open Wiggins or whoever Steph screens for). In the halfcourt with no star, drays playmaking is a bit more comparable to like prime Blake griffin, which is still good and far above league average for the position, but it isn’t really worth running the offense through aside from some designed spots here and there.   Smart suffers from the same issue. His playmaking is decent for a guard, but it isn’t anything of note.   Then it goes to shooting where smart is clearly the better asset than Dray currently is. While smart doesn’t shoot a great percentage, he isn’t afraid to take them in the flow of the offense and on occasion will get hot and shoot like 7/10 form deep. This means the defense has to stay honest when defending him whereas they openly disregard Dray (where again, his flaws are hidden a bit by having Stephen Curry to pass to, who can make extraordinarily tough shots).   And then defense. I don’t think this should shock anyone who watches games but Dray just isn’t the defender he once was. He’ll still get a ton of work done on that end because his defensive iq is off the charts, and he can even predict where the ball will end up on a good number of positions, allowing him to pre-rotate and get steals/blocks. Now I think Dray is currently a more valuable defender than smart is, due to his advantage in size and versatility, but atm I don’t see the gap as large enough over smart that it would change the outcome of playoff series from a pure defensive standpoint alone.   So if I have an abstract team, where I have no clue what the roster construction is, I feel like smart is the smarter choice simply because he can provide you with offense whereas Dray is gonna struggle a bit more if he doesn’t have a real star that defenses have to key in on and the gap in their defense currently isn’t large enough to win or lose a playoff series (which is the end goal)."
"I said this last time, but remember when Blake griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge and Andre Drummond all got bought out and signed with big teams and everyone acted like they were top 10 players? I got so much shit on this sub for saying that non of those guys will have a big impact, and look at them now lol."
Blake Griffin has a below average penis for his size dont ask me how I know but I know
"Honestly, Blake Griffin was the key factor in that comeback."
Blake Wardell Griffin
"""Blake Griffin sucks""  Bucks fans 🤝Nuggets fans"
Probably the best blake griffin game for the nets
"Blake griffin is like the 5th or 6th option on this team, if he is playing even 60% of his old all star self like he did tonight, there is no chance any team beats the Nets in the playoffs.   This Nets team is beyond stacked. Kyrie, Durant, Harden, Blake, Green, etc. How are you gonna beat that team."
blake griffin is fouling him like crazy. in playoffs though he needs to learn to shoot through the fouls
SHOUTOUT to WASHED OUT Blake Griffin!
What if I told you Blake Griffin is a 3rd option a championship team
Blake Griffin woke up and decided he was Steph
Blake Griffin woke up and decided he was Steph
Blake Griffin woke up and decided he was Steph
Blake Griffin needs to stop flopping. That was a beautiful pass by KD but got wasted cause of the flop.
Blake Griffin having 20 points on 10 shots is why the Nuggets won’t win a chip with Jokic at center.
have we started talking about Vintage Blake Griffin TM yet?
that Blake griffin 3 hit the side of the backboard?
Rooting for another shit game by Blake Griffin   Peace 🙏
"His play style also turned out to be pretty different from what we expected. The media thought he was basically the second coming of Blake Griffin with his hops and crazy highlight dunks, but it turns out point Zion is something we weren't really expecting to get"
I'll never forget Andre Miller losing his consecutive games played streak by getting suspended for running over Blake Griffin in retaliation for repeatedly shoving him in the back.
There are a ton of outcomes that would make me jump for joy.  The thing I want most is for the Knicks to win it all and for D Rose to get a chip. Probably not happening. Suns winning it all and CP3 getting his own. Maybe happening. Giannis winning it all because he just seems like a good dude. Probably not happening with coach Bud (feel free to prove me wrong!).  But then there is the little troll in the back of my head that wants some toxic shit like nets win and Blake Griffin gets fmvp so we can see a river of tears.
I think it’s cuz he doesn’t dunk like he can which is actually smarter long term for his career. Blake griffin probably had 3 more good years if he would’ve stopped dunking so much
"&gt;The Jazz defense is great and they have a better team defensive system, but typically when Rudy Gobert leaves the key, bad things happen. If you've watched the Sixers this year, Embiid doesn't leave the paint. Again, he has the lucky advantage of very switchable teammates with length and athleticism.  You dont really seem to get that Danny Green cant guard Harden and if Thybulle is on the floor their offense is gonna be bad. Tobias Harris and Seth Curry will also have to play big minutes. Its not gonna be like you are thinking at all. Embid is gonna have to sometimes. Also you keep ignoring that they are going to get burned in Drop coverage heavy.  &gt;'m more and more getting the impression that you don't watch the Sixers. Harris isn't DPOY caliber in his minutes like Simmons, Thybulle, and Embiid when he tries, but Harris is an excellent and versatile defender. If you'd watched Sixers basketball, what you're describing is not how they've defended the pick and roll at all. You're generalizing with a vague idea of the strengths and weaknesses of the roster. Also, you seem to be basing this idea that Claxton will get playoff minutes on nothing. The starting lineup contains DAJ and will for the playoffs, they've already said that. That doesn't exclude the possibility of him playing light minutes to start with Claxton off the bench, but what they've been experimenting with more is KD going down to the 4 and Blake at the 5. All bad defensive setups. Claxton is only slightly better on offense or defense, and the politics are keeping his minutes to a minimum. If LMA were still playing Claxton would never take off his warmups anymore.  Harris has never been known as a good defender in his career ever. He will get roasted by any of the big three...like any of them, same with Seth Curry. I'm basing this on the reality of what they are. Okay so you know nothing about the Nets basically and are talking about things you dont know.  They have not said that. They have been trying to move away from Jordan for awhile. Claxton has been called their best defender by Nash. He's much better on defense than Griffin, you do not know what you are talking about.   They are benching DJ right now for Griffin too and as Claxton ramps up he will get more minutes. They wanted to bench DJ when Aldridge was there too. Which is why Claxton got minutes the very first day Aldridge got there and DJ got a DNP.  Every single metric shows DeAndre as a poor player, they are not gonna play him good minutes in the playoffs. Claxton will get minutes. That is flat out false lol. Nash literally called him their best defender. DJ literally was a DNP last game. They may experiment with BG at the 5 but once Harden comes back its gonna be clear Claxton needs to be the center.  Nic Claxton has also been on Covid protocol for awhile and Nash has been ramping up his minutes as he only got back two games ago.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;No, that's not what spacing is. Spacing is the result of something, not literally someone just sniping. And any decent NBA defender can recover to a stationary turret to contest a shot. If there is no off ball movement, the spacing suffers. You're pointing to one playoff victory over Gobert when he was younger as proof of your erroneous point, but you're really just highlighting the exception to the rule. Not only that, but Harden's efficiency really suffered that series and the Rockets won because they were clearly a far superior overall team. Good luck replicating that on current Rudy or Embiid, especially with no off ball movement and a far worse defense than in Houston.  Spacing is the result of having good shooters on the floor you cant leave, you arent getting it. The Rockets had no off ball movement at all. All Harden/KD/Kyrie has to do is get by his initial defender and the others already have an advantage. Houston had stationary shooters for years and their offense was great, LOL now those stationary shooters are KD/Kyrie/Shamet/Harris, you do not know what you are talking about.  You are reaching hard.  Younger Gobert? Lol it was 2-3 years ago when Gobert was still a defensive force in the league and it happend 2 years in a row. Embid is not a better defender than Gobert. Harden destroyed them the first two-three games in both series. It took them 2 games to adjust. By then Cp3 could kill them when they ran drop coverage lol, what do you think Kyrie and KD are going to do Embid. And the only reason Harden did poorly in those last couple of games was because they were sitting on his left forcing him right, something that DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE. They built their whole offense around stopping Harden, good luck doing that with KD and Kyrie on the team.  The thing is....Philly is actually only marginally better on offense than those Utah teams as well. To boost their offense you would need to play Curry and he's gonna get reamed on defense.   &gt;It's not a lazy take. The Warriors moved heaven and Earth to fit KD into their offense. We fundamentally changed our offense to work him into it. Steph had just led the league in scoring while shooting 50/45/90 and he took 2 fewer shots per game. We also made all of our triangle sets feature KD in scoring position, which gave Steph a lower quality shot selection and lowered his efficiency. This obviously isn't a bad idea, the man is the best pure scorer in the NBA. But Steph/Klay/Dray all had to be selfless in order to integrate Kevin Durant. And Kevin Durant is a hyperefficient scorer whose only goal was to win. Granted he phoned it in the next two years and refused to run our offense, but our stars sacrificed for him. Kyrie and Harden simply are not as selfless as Steph and Klay. Harden and KD both think they are ""the guy"" and there is eventually going to be friction. Just like there was with Shaq and Kobe. Just like there was initially with LBJ and DWade. Steph was our guy and stepped back for KD, and he didn't care who ""the guy"" was. The difference to your current setup is there is a third star with a history of problems in this exact area and locker room drama and this ""big 3"" has only played 2 games together.   &gt;   &gt;You are grasping at straws and I think you are really emotionally invested in Harden getting a championship here. I'm not rooting against them, I personally visually love Kyrie's game and KD is fascinating to watch, and Harden is who the other team has to game plan around. But I just do not see this as a good fit. I see the same perfect storm around each team like last year's Clips who get hype because of the talent before people take the rose colored goggles off and notice their flaws.  Mhmm..narrative nonsense.   You are grasping at straws. You have an idealistic view that off ball-movement based offense is best and only the players who fit that mold will win.   Harden and KD is one of the best fits in the league and Harden and Kyrie literally went like 16-3 together."
"You can't go from literal non shooter to even below average like Green in 4 seasons.   It takes absolutely tons of work, especially when starting from a base like Simmons. How long did it take Brook Lopez or Blake Griffin to become a decent 3 point shooters? And those guys started at least with an OK baseline level. It took Michael Jordan years to become the jump shooter he was, and he's freaking Michael Jordan.   Keep in mind too, the amount of time spent on working on shooting is time away from other aspects of his game. Fitness, strength, better halfcourt playmaking, defensive improvements, finishing at the basket, handling the ball. Is it worth taking time away from that when he's looking at maybe being a 33% shooter on 3 or 4 attempts at best?"
You mean as a the role player that ruins it for the team with bad plays and missed shots?  I thought KCP was actually decent last year.   I don't think Tucker does any hero crap to really ruin it for the Bucks.  I could see someone like Blake Griffin ruin it for the Nets. Someone that is older that just takes bad shots.

[or how about](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/myj0su/highlight_cp3_drops_blake_griffin_to_the_floor/) Blake Griffin magically losing his footing after getting bumped.  Edit: [here is another](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/myiy15/highlight_and_the_academy_award_goes_toblake/) of Griffin from the same game.
If it was written today you know Blake Griffin would be taken by the white delegation
Dallas ain't making no noise in the playoffs until they get a suitable second star. Heck even Blake Griffin is a better #2 than anyone else outside of Doncic on Mavs roster
Nah run Russ at the 4 or the 5. Let Russ play like lob city Blake griffin. He’d be all about that.
Bruh see the trend. See Blake Griffin 👀sad reacts bro
I'd trade Ben Simmons for Blake Griffin this instant. Straight up
"on subpar-average efficiency   getting guarded by guards or Blake Griffin, lol he should be killing them"
Cmon man that's just disrespectful... to Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin not dunking rest of playoffs
"I edited after but yea, to the point those guys were NOT considered hall of fame players at the time of their retirement, which is kinda the point. Braun wasn't enshrined until 30 years after his retirement and Gallatin wasn't enshrined until two years ago. I think that should contextualize how they were regarded. It's not the Knicks that had a high standard when these guys took decades to make it into the hall of fame vs. Melo who is widely considered to be a lock.   Re: contributions, I disagree. Again it's rewarding worse players for being on better teams. Each of those guys, even relative to their time period, were regarded relatively worse than Melo in his era, they just had a decent team. This isn't a critique of you specifically, I think its disingenuous for us to say the 3 all stars on the same team contributed more to a franchise that the guy who tried to do it on his own. We more or less maintain the narrative that contribution or only worthwhile if they result in a championship (a team effort), which is why stars today force their way to create super teams. VERY crude analogy, but I wouldn't argue that Anthony Davis has contributed more to the lakers than Blake griffin to the clippers, for instance."
"Why yes, I *have* been having dark, dirty fantasies about what Joel Embiid will do if he goes up against Blake Griffin playing the 5, why do you ask?"
"were not getting Ben with a jumpshot because he is ridiculously obsessed with padding efficiency numbers.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm Aussie so i root for Ben to do well year in year out but all i see is the same guy playing to round out his point guard stats. The guy is a power forward, playing as a guard. He needs to go and be the Blake Griffin-esque PF that he actually is, because although hes got great handle, he limits the team being their PG.   &amp;#x200B;  Theyre doing amazing at the moment and i do hope they win a title, but if Embiid wasnt going god mode, they'd be a second round team at best each year. He needs to get over his obsession with only taking wide open layups and accept that people take jumpshots, and its okay to miss them.  &amp;#x200B;  Were not getting an All-NBA / Lebron level guy. hes not going to get much better than he is now. the ONE flaw he has is his jumpshot and lack of want to shoot it. with that, hes a 20+ppg with 8 and 8 and elite D..... but nope.,"
"Can confirm, most people want the bucks to win. But holy shit, they arent taking advantage of all these injuries. Bruh its kd blake griffin and a quarter of harden. Take advantage of that shit"
"Nothing wrong playing with athleticism, however, it does not age well for most players. Longevity wise he will need to adapt like other before him have i.e. Blake Griffin and Vince Carter."
"The nets winning the championship being carried by Jeff Green, Blake Griffin, and Joe Harris while their big 3 are all injured would be pretty hilarious."
"Well, this is a Bill Simmons open letter to Blake Griffin with a run-down of ""cursed"" stuff happening with Clippers in their history: http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story?sportCat=nba&amp;page=simmons/090624"
"Sounds like Blake Griffin, but Bob Thate fixed that"
"I can see a future where the Nets rest both Harden and KD next game to avoid injuries, and the Bucks still lose to Joe Harris and Blake Griffin scoring 30+. That team looks like the Clippers in the East now, like they know they're out even when they're leading."
Blake Griffin winds back the clock and drops 40.
Kind of interesting that Oklahoma isn't rooting for Trae Young or Blake Griffin.  CP3 babyyyy
"Eh, honestly, not to point the heat at my own franchise, but we were banged up by the post season enough for it to be a problem with how the team was managed and run.   To me, as a fan who thought lob city would change the world, I think the staff just failed to take care of its players. Imagine how much healthier and better all time Blake griffin would be if the org took the time the pels did with Zion to train him to make adjustments to ensure his long term health instead of landing flat footed on dunks."
"Detriot brought in bums who never did anything after their Detroit stint. Monroe, Jennings, Reggie Jackson, etc. The players he actually developed KCP, Tobias, Drummond got traded or just werent resinged. This mofo made Drummond an allstar.. He dragged your sorry ass excuse of a team to the playoffs and you dare complain about him? Your team had a young core and they let them walk and traded it for Blake Griffin lmao.  Also you want Zion to take more 3s and complain about a shitty 3pt shooter having 100 attempts on 600 games."
Clippers-era Blake Griffin was a much better handler/passer/shooter than he got credit for. People act like he only got good at those things with Detroit.
"Lebron has quit on his team multiple times in the playoffs and Finals. He did it again just last week  This is a competitive sports league, right? VC still gets hate from quitting on the Raptors and Blake Griffin gets hate for taking it easy in Detriit before going to Brooklyn    That disqualifies from a spot before we even get into accomplishments"
"I never understood why people kept this joke in their bag. Blake won it 2 years removed from his first season, but people aren’t going around saying Blake griffin ROY jokes"
Id respect Ballmer a whole lot more if it wasnt for his temper and for the fact they did a mock retirement number Blake Griffin ceremony with all the promises.  https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2005/09/05/im-going-to-fking-kill-google-alleged-ballmer-temper-tantrum/  Just one example of many of his temper.  Stop idolozing Billionaires wheter its Cuban or Ballmer they still are flawed men.
"Probably Dwight, not the same comparison since its been over a decade from his Orlando prime, but they both can play bullyball until they hit a wall where they need better footwork, skill, one or two good moves to get a bucket during crunchtime. Blake Griffin had this issue too early on where he needed to expand his game otherwise he would be in the only dunker camp too."
"1989: Danny Manning tears ACL, he was the #1 overall pick, the team's franchise player  1990: Ron Harper tears ACL,  he was one of the best young players in the game at the time averaging 23ppg  2007: Shaun Livingston dislocates knee, the team's point guard of the future  2010:  Blake Griffin breaks knee cap, lost his rookie season and presaged all the injuries to come"
I’d like to think Steve Ballmer is cursed from screwing over Blake Griffin so the Clippers aren’t allowed to win too much now.
"Man, remember that bull rush he did on Griffin where he backed up to the 3 then took off?  Blake couldn't set fast enough to draw a charge and ending up giving Giannis the bucket and foul.  Stuff like that and the mini-floater he was getting on Blake early on , or free dunks coming down the baseline really made it seem like Giannis had him figured out.  Then he does stupid stuff like early clock 3 against I think Harris (which he made and got all cocky about) and the fade away against Harden.  Just why man?"
He reminds me of Blake Griffin when he played with Eric Gordon and Chris Kaman.
"Goddamn I wish I could have your optimism. I guess it is unlikely that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin go nuclear from 3 again, but the margins are so razor thing for the Bucks. Will Harden be as ineffective as he was this past game? I doubt it, so KD doesn't need to do as much.  I think it's less *that* the Bucks lost and more *how* they lost. When it came down to crunch time, the Bucks just looked lost. They panicked, didn't play any semblance of offense, couldn't figure out any way to slow KD down (though it's debatable that slowing KD was actually possible), and just looked like they had 0 BBIQ when the pressure ratcheted up. Nothing about that warrants optimism when you're faced with 2 must-win games"
"Joel Embiid is the biggest character in the nba I don't know how you don't include him  Blake Griffin is funny and a good actor, irrelevant that he is past his prime"
How are they not? Blake griffin right now better than rob williams?? Landry shamet over marcus smart?? lmaooo alright my guy
"Gotta say, the way people talk about Blake Griffin, you'd think he was 42..."
Wouldn't that make him more willing to get it. He'd be so attracted to the rim that he'd turn into Lob City Blake Griffin.
"Blake ""I didn't sign up for this"" Griffin"
"Harden at 10%, Blake Griffin and Jeff Green &gt; KLove, TT, and JR Smith"
"I used to think Blake griffin had no offense, until I saw giannis. Every time he shoots a three it looks like it’s lucky to go in. He has no post moves, he literally can only run straight and try to dunk. It’s terrible."
"I know it's beyond repetitive at this point, but when it comes to talent, the only team that can stop Brooklyn is the Nets.  Irving out? OK. Harden playing damn near the whole game and yet making one more field goal than you or I? OK. Milwaukee jumping out to a big early lead? OK.   Just didn't matter. Will KD put up another boxscore like last night? I don't think so. If he plays the entire game again, is it possible? Very. He's just that damn good. James will play better. Kyrie will return at some point. Blake suddenly looks like a different player than when he was with Detroit (I know LeBron and KD get knocked for switching teams, but gimme players leaving via free agency after giving it their all over someone phoning it in like Griffin did in Detroit, gut that's a different subject.)"
"They should give Chuck his own 'Hall of Faim' segment, just for him to rant about whom he would not feed.  The series also feels weird because it is going against what was expected. The super team has been playing with gallons of heart - KD giving it all, Harden forcing an early comeback, Blake Griffin jumping around like his vintage self and Bruce Brown being everything that people expected from PJ Tucker... And the Bucks just feel too passive/vanilla once again..."
"&gt; ""continues to play Lopez in drop coverage""  Im not even a bucks fan and I'm yelling at the tv every time I see Blake Griffin wide open for another 3. Granted he didn't make em all but dude was literally wide open.   Another thing I'm sure you know your team better than I &amp; it does seems to me that Giannis functions best as a help defender roaming the court like a free safety but being a DPOY I'd imagine he can play some 1V1 defense, with that being said why doesnt Bud put him on KD sometime?  B/C as hard as PJ fights he still gives up 5""-6"",  it was times where KD just rose up regardless of him. Id imagine having a bigger body on him would help. I'm not saying for the whole game b/c he has offensive responsibility (&amp; noone really stops KD) but when it counts or just here &amp; there to switch it up."
"He was never even close to that level or on that trajectory. Luka Doncic and Anthony Edwards are the guys most likely to dominate the league like Lebron imo.   Guys like Blake Griffin, Ben Simmons, Andrew Wiggins, and Giannis are not that."
So KD and the ghost of Blake griffin is better than the entire bucks roster? Ouuufffff
"That’s because he joined Steph and Klay and got success with those guys. What he did tonight he did with Joe Harris, hobbled James Harden, and old Blake Griffin"
If the Bucks lose this series Bud should be fired immediately and they need to make some major player moves. This series is literally being handed to them on a silver platter. Both Harden and Kyrie are hurt so all you have to do is outplay KD. You are supposed to be a defensive team but yet no one can do anything to KD and Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are still being highly productive as well. Losing this series would be like the Warriors still winning the Finals vs Kawhi and the Raptors with Klay and KD out. The Bucks HAVE to win these next 2 games.
"Joe Harris has been major cheeks. It’s been one game of Jeff Green, one game of Bruce Brown and one game of Blake Griffin"
"The Bucks couldn’t guard the perimeter that wasn’t KD or Harden.  KD did what he had to do with 40+ points. Jeff Green and Blake Griffin provided scoring and 3-point shooting.  It is infuriating to see the Bucks be awful at the perimeter shooting defense, when they should be better than what they are. Jeff Green was hot from the field, how about you guard him? Blake Griffin is hitting a high percentage of 3, why not guard him? They couldn’t even take advantage of Harris hitting bricks, because he was open on a few."
Especially when you have Blake Griffin who is out here defying basic physics. Blake somehow falls backwards when he gets hit on the side of his body. He needs more credit for figuring out how to change everything we know about energy and the way it’s exerted.
"So many things wrong with the Bucks I don't know where to start:  Jrue Bledsoe is not a very smart playmaker. I never knew he was this much of a stupid shot chucker. He was part of a lot of the boneheaded ""plays.""  Giannis once again nowhere to be found in clutch time. Add on top of that the terrible butterfingers turnover in the last minute of the game. If he had a little more patience in the paint, he could be deadly, but he's always either rushing his shot or attempting some ridiculous jumpshot because he can't find anything inside because he can't create anything himself when he's not in transition  Bud should've been fired a long time ago. That dude should never coach an NBA team again. The garbage lineups he was rolling out there in a game 5 was criminal. Plus, playing Giannis like it's a regular season game. Plus, letting KD cook Lopez over and over again. Plus not calling a timeout when the idiots on the court didn't want to close out and just let the Nets' shooters shoot wide open 3s. Get this dumpster fire out of Milwaukee.  With all that being said, KD is a monster. I just wish he could do this more often without superstars all around him (and that includes the deadliest shooters Blake Griffin and Jeff Green)."
"Here are some of his buckets tonight:   - coast to coast 8 foot floater  - pinning Blake Griffin on the baseline for a sideline out of bounds play into a dunk  - behind the back face up into 3 with Blake Griffin soft closing out  - iso size up into 18 foot pull up  - crosses harden into a wide open paint for the dunk  - crossover, hesi, then baseline drive past Griffin for the nice finger roll coming from baseline  - gets the switch defender from off the dribble, resets and hits the 3  - crossover, hard dribble into to a side step layup from edge of the paint (5+ feet), finishing over his head for the and 1  - hard dribble into other hand swim through move, finishing a heavily contested layup  I mean, why didn’t Javale McGee just do stuff like that hell? Hell, what about Marquesse Chriss... he’s a 6’9 240 (Giannis 6’11 240) dude who has a 40 inch vertical. Why isn’t he doing that kinda stuff? Maybe because it takes a shitload of skill, and it takes even more skill to do it with insane body control and good feetwork while being that massive and tall.  Just because he doesn’t literally have the handle of a point guard doesn’t mean he’s not skilled. Those moves to get buckets all take skill, there’s a good reason you’re not seeing Deandre Ayton pull those out once a game, much less 15x a game... and Ayton is still hella skilled"
He did the first half. He was taking Blake Griffin off the dribble and getting shots at the rim. Then he defaulted back to fadeaways.
Yes but I also expect Jeff Green and Blake Griffin to not hit every 3.
"Blake Griffin, Kyrie, Dinwiddie for Giannis who says no?"
Blake 'Hit the brakes on the Bucks postseason' Griffin
I rooted for both teams when I started watching basketball and then Blake Griffin dunked on everyone his rookie season and that was more fun.
"It was obviously a joke, also harden flops all the time,it's not a narrative. See the Blake Griffin arm hook foul as your example, thanks"
"Ah yes the super team of KD, 32-year Blake Griffin and 35-ear old Jeff Green.  I feel your pain dude. We went to back to back NBA finals..and lost."
Ben also has a fantastic BBIQ.  If you were to take the pros of both Ben and Giannis and combine them that would basically be...idk...Shawn Kemp?  Blake Griffin on roids?
"Easy to do that when you have harden, blake griffin, jeff green and a solid bench . fraud"
"Best player in the universe when you have harden, blake griffin , jeff green and solid role players."
"He is a classic front runner, only a team with blake griffin and KD and harden playing all minutes will these be considered some all time performance."
Blake 'Hit the brakes' Griffin
"Ah yes just as well all expected the Nets Big 3 KD, Jeff Green and Blake Griffin getting the win."
"Legendary performances by Durant and Jeff Green.  Game 1 was the best game ive ever seen Blake Griffin play.  Game 5 was the best game ive ever seen Jeff Green play.  Side note though, ive watched a lot of Nets this year, and this series has been 5 of the worst games Joe Harris has played. Hes been so bad at the rim and from 3. If Harris was on, these games would look very different."
"Fuck it, Nets new Big 3 is KD, Blake Griffin, and Jeff Green"
Thank god! Blake griffin is no longer on the verge of being eliminated in the second round after giving back $13.3 million in his buyout with the Pistons. He had $75M on his deal for this season and 2021-22.
"There is nothing super about one leg harden, Jeff green, Blake griffin and Kevin durant lol"
"93/21/13 on 70/60/85 splits   What an amazing showing from Brooklyn's Big 3 of KD, 32-year-old Blake Griffin and soon to be 35-year-old Jeff Green"
"Blake Griffin talking shit while walking away is one of the most bitch made things I’ve ever seen.    If you’re gonna talk say it to a guy’s face. If you want to walk away, then keep your mouth shut.   What a pussy."
You spelled Blake Griffin wrong
How does Blake Griffin get away with doing that? How insanely obvious can it be and still be ignored? I just can't wrap my mind around it.
"Blake Griffin was literally grappling him away from the rebound, it's an unbelievably clear foul"
Blake Griffin pulling PJ across the floor
I don't think James Harden will play this badly again but I am not sure if Jeff Green and Blake Griffin can keep shooting like that either.
Does anyone genuinely like Blake Griffin?
That is 100% a foul on Blake griffin lmao
"Damn I see why tucker was pissed, Blake Griffin is a dirty player"
Blake Griffin was simply demonstrating what a choke looks like
gRiFfIn aND tUcKeR GoT bAnGeD Up.  Shut the fuck up. Blake fouled the shit out of him.
Blake griffin has pj's arms locked but thats not a foul. Yup makes sense
"Bucks fans, ""fuck blake griffin""  Amen brother"
"Oh, what's that - Blake Griffin grabbing PJ's arm to hold him away from the rebound? Uncalled? Shocker"
Blake griffin yanking Pj tuckers arm on that rebound
That’s a foul on Blake griffin holy rigged
Blake Griffin is KDs new bodyguard lmao
Man fuck blake griffin
Blake Griffin had Tucker locked up there
Blake Griffin said hold these nuts😂😂😂😂
Box score warriors gonna look at the stats and say Giannis played well. He is a 2x MVP being guarded by Jeff Green and Blake Griffin. Averaging 40 pts should be a minimum.
People were outraged over the Blake Griffin and LMA signings meanwhile Jeff Green is on a minimum and the 2nd best player in a ECF Game 5
"Jeff green is great, Blake griffin has been playing well this series. This nets team is insane"
Nets players points total/shooting %  Jeff Green 24 points - 7/9 shooting   Blake Griffin 17 points - 7/11 shooting  Landry Shamet 7 points - 3/5 shooting   Joe Harris **5 points - 2/11 shooting**  **James Harden 3 points - 1/10 shooting**   Bruce Brown 2 points - **1/5 shooting**  KD almost has half of his teams points lmaoooooo
"Durant, Jeff Green, and Blake Griffin have stepped up so much while Harden and Irving have been banged up. Props to these guys, meeting the moment when it matters."
AND THE CORPSE OF BLAKE GRIFFIN
Coz Giannis is normally such a notoriously lethal shooter hahahahahahahahahahaha  Blake Griffin is the thermal exhaust port of this Death Star of a Net's team
69420 at a minimum.  Fuck Blake Griffin and fuck KD’s soft ass
Sick of this Blake Griffin from 3 shit.... that is not supposed to be going in lmao
"Classic game so far for the nets big three: KD, Blake Griffin and Jeff Green"
blake 'al dente' griffin
Blake Griffin flopping every single time.
Fuck u Blake griffin
"That guy unironically thinks that Giannis and Shaq are comparable, Holy crap.  Shaq went up against Tim Duncan and David Robinson at the same time and made them look like fools, he didn't play the corpse of Blake Griffin and the injured Nets or DeAndre Ayton."
Devin Booker  Jordan Clarkson Ben Simmons Blake Griffin  James Harden  Tristan Thompson Kris Humphries  You can fill the rest ;)
"Just gonna quote a comment of mine from the other day because I don’t wanna find it all again…  &gt; He put up 40/13/5 on 15/24 shooting in game 7 against the Nets, including 7 points on 3/4 in the fourth and one of the Bucks’ two made baskets in OT. Meanwhile the rest of the team shot 38% from the field with Middleton and Holiday combining for **14/49**.  &gt; He scored 31.2% of the team’s points in that series (to KD’s 33.8%), grabbed 23.6% of rebounds (to KD’s 24.4%) and created 19.8% of assists (to KD’s 25.1%), as well as being the team’s defensive anchor. And of course, he won. Despite KD’s best efforts, but it is worth noting for all the carrying he did the only game he won without Kyrie was when Jeff Green and Blake Griffin combined for 44 points on 15/26 shooting (so, the only time he got serious help).  We can look at the rosters on paper forever but in practice, a) KD had Kyrie for three and a half games and that’s where two of their three wins came from and b) Jrue couldn’t hit a layup all series and Middleton came right by the end but looked like total shit for half the series. Forbes and Portis played themselves out of the rotation and Lopez spent most of his time getting abused defensively.   For all our superiority on paper Giannis was the only guy who actually showed up with any consistency and the sheer volume of his contribution shows it pretty clearly."
Chris Paul and Blake Griffin are both are built like Mr. Glass from Unbreakable.
"Which fits in with the Clippers curse. If you think that's just relegated to only affecting Chris Paul, [you need to look at their history](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/090624&amp;sportCat=nba) and everyone else associated with them. Look at the injury issues Blake Griffin has had, which all started for him literally in his first pre-season with the Clippers and have continued after they traded him. Look at what Kawhi is dealing with right now. Look at how often Patrick Beverley gets hurt, how he missed a full season injured as a Clipper. Look at Serge Ibaka out with back injuries all year and now may miss all of next season with back surgery. Look at Zubac fucking up his knee. Look at Paul George's shoulder issues and his persistent hamstring problems. That shit is real."
"Chris Paul and Blake griffin  6”5 point guard with:  CP3’s passing, ball handling, IQ, midrange   Blake’s athleticism , finishing and strength"
"Nah no way. The Pelicans staff had incredibly strict requirements surrounding changes in Zion’s biomechanics before he could come back on the court. He plays so much safer than in high school and college. I think the extended rehab may have added years to his career. An over-zealous rehab program for 3 extra months may end up saving him months of rehab from future injuries.  Embiid and Blake Griffin both missed their rookie seasons and both are extremely skillful well developed players in spite of that. The hype will come with winning, it always does."
"It's possible Love was tanking his value with the olympic team, but honestly, he just might be cooked.  And even if Love isn't cooked, he's a player who's primary value is offensive, and would be (at best) the 4th-best offensive player on the Nets (and that's assuming her returns somewhat to a form we haven't seen in a few years). The Nets don't really need or want him on offense.   The Nets will have the taxpayer MLE, but will need to use that to re-sign guys like Bruce Brown and Blake Griffin, who will probably get offers for more than the non-bird raise the Nets can offer."
"Detroit sports fans for the most part, are pretty intelligent. They won't support or follow a team that doesn't have a sense of direction which is either competing for a championship, or engaging in a serious rebuild with the end game of building a championship foundation.   As bad as the Pistons have been, they really haven't attempted a true rebuild till recently. When Tom Gores bought the team, he thought 8th seeds and stars (Blake Griffin) would bring fans out, but Detroit fans knew that team had zero championship hopes."
"Blake griffin: hey, look at us. Who would've thought?"
"&gt;LA Clippers - Chris Paul, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Blake Griffin, Bob McAdoo  fwiw Elton Brand has a higher VORP than Blake for both their careers and Clipper tenures"
You’re not crazy but the Nets will want him more because Blake Griffin can not defend anything
"The Bucks are not deeper than the Nets. Outside of the big 3 Nets have Joe Harris, Jeff Green, Spencer Dinwiddie, Blake Griffin, Landry Shamet, Claxton, and Bruce Brown. Bucks have Brook, Divencenzo, Tucker, Portis, Forbes, Teague, and Connaughton. The Nets were 1 shot away from going up 3-0 without harden playing at all. Its not to discredit the Bucks, I had them as the 2nd best team going into the playoffs but don't discredit the Nets for not having a deep team like the Bucks."
Yeah and playoffs in 2010 and 2011 were ugly enough at the end that I wouldn’t say he didn’t have clear claim to that title until 2012 and the past few years aren’t clear since healthy KD has a pretty healthy case.  Hell I would argue KD is better than both right now.  Hard carried the Nets to OT game 7 against the Bucks with one legged Harden and the corpse of Blake Griffin.
i mean its hard to think of answers on the spot after heavy exercise. Blake Griffin did a skit about it im pretty sure.
"u/triosway and u/SlappyBagg  Basically “it will be generations before we see that happen again”  The very next year Anthony Davis, a 4 time All NBA 1st team (meaning top 5 player, 4 different years) joins Lebron and they win a title. The very next year after that, Durant joins Kyrie and then Harden a 6 time All NBA 1st team (meaning top 5 player, 6 different seasons) joins both of them!  (Oh and so did Blake Griffin after that)  Guess that was a quick generation to come around"
"&gt; only 4-time All-NBA selection not in the Hall  wait, really? but we've also got Aldridge/Blake Griffin/Amare'e/Kevin Johnson. Although, Amare'e is the only one with at least 4 all nba selections who also made 1st team at least once."
"2 of the 3 Nets played in all 7 games. It was 2-1 half way through game 4 with Bucks leading when Kyrie went down.  The Nets won the 2 seed when the 3 of them played together a total of 7 games. Without all 3 they were still a very good team with a pretty good cast with Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, etc."
We’re talking about a 7’7 Blake griffin. As in top 2 greatest dunker Blake griffin
low key nets and Blake griffin slowed him down more somehow than capela or ayton
"It really started with the Hornets moving out of NO after Katrina, folks on the business end immediately saw the Oklahoma professional sports vacuum and how easily it could be filled with an NBA team and started planning  Then Blake Griffin was pretty amazing to watch, and the Thunder had an immediate fan base even well outside of OK with an incredible 3 future MVPs on one team thanks to the absolute wizard genius that is Sam Presti and it all snowballed from there"
"One day Blake Griffin picked up a football and dunked it in on a goal post and boom, basketball came to Oklahoma."
"It's true. It's disgusting to see LeBron flop, when people are comparing him to Jordan, and he's been gifted the perfect NBA body. But it's a once in a while thing. CP3 literally can't do shit without doing gymnastics at the hint of a slight breeze. And it's even more disgusting to watch him infect his teamates.  I really dislike Blake Griffin, and there's no real good reason, except he was flopping alongside CP3 for years. Other than being on the same team as CP3, seems like a guy I'd really like."
Never say never my friend. I trust in MJ. He finally got a draft pick right. He could've easily fumbled this one too. The league is sleepin on the Hornets rn. Sometimes all you need is that one player then everything will start falling into place. For my team it was Blake Griffin. The Clippers finally got a draft pick right and it turned the whole culture around. LaMelo is something else. I hope he stays healthy and free of controversy.
"Yea them leftovers from Blake Griffin, Jordan Clarkson, and Ben Simmons lmao"
This series really showing how good of a job Blake griffin actually did on Giannis. Ayton can’t even slow him down
somehow every Suns player flops more the Blake Griffin. and the refs still fall for it
"Everyone keeps pointing to the Blake Griffin example, but nobody is coming up with any other example. I think that was a uniquely shitty situation"
"Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, PJ Tucker, Dwight Howard, and Andre Iguodala."
*Blake Griffin has entered the chat*
Love will magically regain 75% of his former powers on a contender and become Jumpshot Blake Griffin
"I mean there are still people who get cut every year in the NBA, or at least bought out. Maybe not Todd Gurley like contracts but Blake Griffin got bought out. That still doesn't negate the fact that you can be traded at pretty much anytime."
"Let’s be real. The contract is with the NBA, not an individual team. The various franchises can ship contracts around to other franchises at will. When you sign a deal, you have a guaranteed contract with the league, not with a team.   See: Griffin, Blake; Harden, James; Westbrook, Russell; etc etc etc."
"He dunked once and everyone thinks he's back to being a top 20 player.  I doubt KLove will retire, but he needs to get bought out or something, he is *not* worth his contract.  Also, Blake Griffin basically dragged the Pistons to the 8 seed in 2019 and played 35 minutes a game. I don't think Kevin Love has had a season like that in quite a while."
About to pull a Blake Griffin
Kevin Love was so good in Minnesota. It's unfortunate that injuries and age have robbed him of so much. He had a higher vertical at the combine than Blake Griffin. He was one of the few dudes who could get you 20 boards while hitting 5 3's in a game.
Bout to be Blake Griffin part two in Cleveland. Watch him go to the Nets and start dunking all over everyone and diving for loose balls and shit.
Remember when everyone said Blake Griffin was done and washed up and a scrub and a waste of roster space? /R/NBA doesn't really have a great track record when it comes to predicting anything about basketball.
"What do you expect from players? Players get traded at the drop of a hat. Look at demar derozan, isaih thomas, blake griffin. Loyalty and contracts don't mean shit to GMs, they're literally just ""pieces"" or ""assets"". Why should it be any different for the players?"
Gonna be blake griffin 2.0         I mean if love is 100% healthy he can still shoot and rebound. He’s rebounding numbers were good for how infrequently he played
"It might be because of that last paragraph, that he could be not finished just yet:      “I think I understand that probably being that number one guy, playing 35 minutes and getting 20 touches a game, is probably in my rear view,” Love said recently. “I don’t try to put a ceiling or limit on myself at all. So long as I’m feeling good, I know that I’m going to play good. I’m going to chase the game like I always have. But I do believe that if it’s asked for me to have to pivot in my career for a team to win, I’m more than I’m willing to do that.”     If he understands this, this could actually increase his trade value. He could either go the blake griffin route and join a contender while taking away nothing from cap space. Or he could also be a solid bench guy for a team needing some experience and rebounding off the bench. This is of course entirely dependant on healing up. But if he genuinely has this mindset, he could maybe get another few years with some meaningful minutes, but just not as many minutes, in a different role."
Could be another Blake Griffin. Looks completely broken until he ends up on a contender.
NO HE'S NOT DONE.  jfc have we learned nothing from Blake Griffin?
"Huh?? Forwards were absolutely stacked in the 00s. All NBA are two forward slots, not just PF.  Dirk, Duncan, LeBron, Garnett, Pau, Stoudemire, Pierce, Jermaine O'Neal, Webber, Karl Malone, Barkley, Peja Stojakovic, Wallace, Vince Carter, Shawn Marion, Tracy McGrady (Houston he was a SF and was All NBA as a Forward), Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, Carlos Boozer, Kevin Love, LaMarcus Aldridge, Blake Griffin, Paul George, Zach Randolph etc.. all competing for All NBA honors.   Forward Slots were a lot harder to attain than Guard slots in the 00s. 10s not so much, but 2000s was the era of PFs. The 5 greatest PFs of all time (Duncan, Dirk, KG, Malone, Barkley) all played at the same time, and Dirk, Duncan and KG played for nearly 15 seasons side by side.   Kobe played 2 seasons alongside peak MJ, most of his career with Wade, and missed out on almost all of Harden's prime and wasn't playing when Jerry West was active. Kobe receiving more All NBA first teams isn't so much a matter of him being better but rather his position being less stacked during his prime."
We should ask Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge what they think about it.
"KD lost to Giannis in his house. Simple.  He had Joe Harris, Blake Griffin and one of Kyrie/Harden in every game.  Giannis also had DiVincenzo out."
"I mean, his PER was still just over 20 so he was still far above average. He basically went from being a top 25 player to being a top 30 player. Not to mention he’d been dealing with injuries the last few seasons. But instead of being upfront with him, the Clippers put his goddamn face on a shirt with Martin Luther King and said he was going to be the greatest clipper ever so that he would sign a faaaaat extension that the Clippers could use to trade for assets.   I can absolutely fault the Clippers for that deal. You know both sides have to agree right? Do you think they consulted Griffin to see what he thought? They completely took away his agency. If the Clippers didn’t want him, they should’ve asked Blake where he would like to go.   What happened when Lamarcus wanted to leave the Spurs? Did they take the first offer that crossed their desk? No they tried to make a deal with one of his preferred destinations and ended up losing him for nothing because that was preferable to treating a good player like shit.  Now you might say that’s why the Clippers are in the playoffs and the Spurs aren’t but karma still seems to come for their ass doesn’t it?"
"KD had the NBA 3P% leader, a resurgent Blake Griffin and a 70% James Harden in the games that Kyrie missed.  Giannis had DiVincenzo out as well"
"And yet, LeBron was criticized for this at the time, he always has one foot out the door, how is the team supposed to build long term when the centerpiece won't commit, etc. A player can't win in these situations. Even if Dame runs down his contract and leaves as a free agent, people will complain that the team loses him for nothing. Both sides should honor their contract, sure, but if teams get to trade players at any point in their deal (remember Blake Griffin), players get to ask for a trade at any point. Not force it a la Harden, but asking for it is totally fine imo"
Probably not. Just think it would be a solution where the Blake Griffin situation (sign him to shortly after trade him) or Harden situations would be unavoidable. Not sure if either were on super max but I know Dame is. Maybe even apply it to max contracts?
"Yeah I reread your comment and I think I initially kinda misunderstood what you were saying. What the Clippers did to Blake Griffin was pretty uniquely deceptive, and a lot of other teams probably wouldn’t be *that* bad to their players. But it probably motivated players to always be aware of that possibility, and thus to push harder to be on teams and in situations that they want while they have the leverage."
I think people view it as the team having an end to hold up as well.  It seems that you view the players simply as assets but when you have teams doing what the clippers did to blake griffin that will blur the lines completely and further embolden player empowerment and i think thats what we are seeing now.   Blake didnt sign a contract with the nba. He signed it with the clippers.  He was shown his jersey in the rafters and had built his entire life around LA and chose to re-sign there long term and then was shipped out without notice within a year.  Thats gonna make people feel a certain way about what 'loyalty' in the nba actually is.  Its not a 1 way street when loyalty is used to leverage players into signing longer term deals to become better assets for teams.
"Blake Griffin got the red carpet treatment, was made to believe he’d go down as the greatest Clipper of all time, then got banished to NBA purgatory a few months later.   The old ideal of player loyalty is a preposterous concept in 2021. 9 years from Dame is more than enough loyalty. Dude was as loyal as they come, overachieved since day 1, gave the team a chance to support him, they failed, on to Philly you glorious baller."
"It’s literally how nba contracts work. They are interchangeable within the league. Say what you want but the clippers moving Blake Griffin opened a lot of eyes around the league. He was 100% committed to them and they shipped his ass out without a word. If you’re cool with that but not with a guy asking for a trade, then I got nothing for you."
Trading Kevin Love to a contender is the only way he can heal to full form IMO.      Blake Griffin style
"He was an even worse GM during his time on the Clippers. He’s a big factor in CP, Blake Griffin &amp; DeAndre Jordan not winning a ring."
"God the Blake Griffin thing with the clippers really sucks, he believed they had his back and wanted him to retire with them and then bam traded away"
"Glad that you pointed out the Blake Griffin example. Think alot of people  myself included forget how dirty the Clippers did him and nobody cared because they ended with Kawhi and PG a season later. Teams and owners fuck players all the time but fans somehow always side with the orgs instead of there supposedly ""favorite"" players."
"Because the clippers lied to Blake griffin lilliard signing a multi year contract to play in Portland doesn’t matter? Yeah, nba players are the real victims here….."
"I'm pretty sure Andre Miller broke his streak after he shoved blake griffin, right?"
Have y’all ever seen Blake Griffin act? He’s actually fantastic I would think he’s trained. He’s comedic timing is so on point and he sounds natural rather than forced.
Solid post  The Blake Griffin thing was an eye opener for sure
"Players actively tanking their value to get bought out needs to change. Blake griffin was acting like he was 2 days from retirement on the pistons then went right back to dunking and playing good defense when he got bought out.  I think the buyout market should be restructured to where after the buyout the player goes on a waiver wire starting with the worse team and working it’s way up. Each team has a chance to claim the bought out player for a percentage of his original contract for the remainder of the season (let’s say 50% for the sake of argument). And only after he has fully cleared the wire and every team starting from last to first has had a chance to sign him off the wire does he become a free agent.  This way other markets get a shot first and mid level teams get a shot at improving, and since it’s only for the remainder of the year it’s not like you’re trapping the player at a destination they don’t want to be in for an extended period of time"
Blake griffin would have been better  Or even Aaron Gordon
"The same reason anyone would. Hoping that the team was going in the right direction. Same thing with Blake Griffin. One minute the Clippers said they weren’t going to trade him and then next he’s in Detroit competing for the playoffs and the next they up and decide to go into rebuild and then decide to sit him. Shit can change real quick.  Why give effort when the other side is not doing the same. That would be like me putting forth effort at a job that I don’t want to be at anymore. I don’t know what world or universe you live in but that shit don’t happen in this world or universe. MLK had a dream too.  The motivation is not going to be there like it was in the beginning. You see it all the time regardless of how much money they make.  I don’t give a fuck what they are first and foremost, they’re human beings just like I am . They bleed just like I do which means they’re also capable of going through the same shit that I do. Them having money, being entertainers and shit don’t mean a damn thing. That shit can be gone as quickly as they got it."
"Yeah that's a good point. Media thinks it so it permeates the discussion.   It's an interesting question  * Blake Griffin made All-Star rookie year, 2nd team 2nd/3rd years * Tim Duncan made All-NBA 1st team his 1st/2nd/3rd years * Grant Hill made All-Star rookie, 2nd &amp; 1st team in 2nd/3rd years. * LeBron went 2nd &amp; 1st teams in 2nd/3rd years.   Grant Hill is an interesting analogy. 3rd pick, 6-8, 22/8/6, 23 Triple Doubles in 2 years."
"That's fair. I would probably choose Young over Lavine and Ayton over Kevin Love.  Hell, give me Julius Randle over Kevin Love.   There's actually a long list of bigs I'd take over Kevin Love. I don't actually think he's one of the top 20 big men in the league. The majority of teams have a 4 or 5 better than him. I don't think I'm crazy in thinking that Nerlens Noel would be more useful. Or Brook Lopez, Blake Griffin, Jae Crowder...literally just random roleplaying guys about 6'8"" or so."
"Blake Griffin, Shammet, Brown, Jordan.  They could bring back Dinwiddie and Green too."
"Cam reminds me of a young Blake Griffin, learning the art of the flop from the Oscar awarded Chris."
Chris Paul effect. Same happened to Blake griffin
He won't  see another finals if he doesnt win this year unless he pulls a blake griffin
Blake Griffin might have CP3 beat on the flopping and crying.
That's the CP3 effect. Happened to Blake Griffin too.
I remember when MJ kept saying he wanted Blake Griffin in another Space Jam
"[Watching Blake Griffin try hard to make the script sound good](https://youtube.com/watch?v=-VW5_45ykr0) made me realize how terrible the movie is, front to back"
"“Police this is Blake Griffin. Come quick, Chris Paul is gonna beat my ass.”"
"Blake Griffin on the Pistons organization and its fans: “I'm just blessed to have crossed paths with those guys and to know them as individuals."""
"I agree, i’ve personally never been a big Blake griffin fan, but looking back he definitely has 3 of the top 10 dunks of the decade, and probably 10 in the top 100"
"Butler, CP3, Blake Griffin, Dwight Howard, Jrue, and Brandon Ingram included"
Is Blake Griffin related to Brian Griffin?
"I disagree, if the Lakers add another consistent scorer, and it doesn't have to be a great one, the Nets will flame out praying Blake Griffin can not disintegrate.   It was cute this season but there's no way KD can hold up as a center. They need an above average big or they will die on the boards bad."
"I feel like Simmons wouldn't work on the Warriors unless his role was to come off the bench for Draymond. Those two could not share the floor together, and he's simply making way too much money for a limited minutes bench role like that to be a good value.  If the Nets go for him though and it becomes Blake Griffin 2.0 I might just stop watching basketball entirely."
They have Blake Griffin and Trae not a bad start lol
"Nets took a  gamble on Kyrie, who is always hurt, KD, who has been injured quite a bit, and Blake Griffin.  I'm not rooting for injuries, but it's not luck when they are pretty constantly hurt.  And Giannis did get hurt, and it's sucked. But he doesn't have a record for being hurt like the Nets roster does."
Ayton and Jae Crowder are definitely qualified personnel to make a wall.  The Nets were actually somewhat successful at making a wall defense with Blake Griffin and whatever other forward was on the floor when the Bucks couldn’t make a shot during the first couple games in that series.  It’s mainly big and somewhat mobile bodies. The wall can only truly be successful if the other side players can’t do anything though
"Here’s the sneaky truth that nobody talks about with the Nets, even with the injuries there’s only 2 or 3 teams that would have won that series, us, the Lakers and maybe the Clippers. Their defense was a menace, KD was unguardable, and Blake Griffin was playing the best basketball he’s played in like 5 years. Harden wasn’t scoring much but he’s still an all time great passer."
"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don’t pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot. Go all the way back to 1980 and there's only like 8 or 9 years where the #2 outperformed the #1.      |Draft|1st Overall|2nd Overall| :--|:--|:--| |2020|Anthony Edwards|James Wiseman| |2019|Zion Williamson|Ja Morant| |2018|Deandre Ayton|Marvin Bagley III| |2017|Markelle Fultz|Lonzo Ball| |2016|Ben Simmons|Brandon Ingram| |2015|Karl-Anthony Towns|D'Angelo Russell| |2014|Andrew Wiggins|Jabari Parker| |2013|Anthony Bennett|Victor Oladipo| |2012|Anthony Davis|Michael Kidd-Gilchrist| |2011|Kyrie Irving|Derrick Williams| |2010|John Wall|Evan Turner| |2009|Blake Griffin|Hasheem Thabeet| |2008|Derrick Rose|Michael Beasley| |2007|Greg Oden|Kevin Durant| |2006|Andrea Bargnani|LaMarcus Aldridge| |2005|Andrew Bogut|Marvin Williams| |2004|Dwight Howard|Emeka Okafor| |2003|LeBron James|Darko Milicic| |2002|Yao Ming|Jay Williams| |2001|Kwame Brown|Tyson Chandler| |2000|Kenyon Martin|Stromile Swift| |1999|Elton Brand|Steve Francis| |1998|Michael Olowokandi|Mike Bibby| |1997|Tim Duncan|Keith Van Horn| |1996|Allen Iverson|Marcus Camby| |1995|Joe Smith|Antonio McDyess| |1994|Glenn Robinson|Jason Kidd| |1993|Chris Webber|Shawn Bradley| |1992|Shaquille O'Neal|Alonzo Mourning| |1991|Larry Johnson|Kenny Anderson| |1990|Derrick Coleman|Gary Payton| |1989|Pervis Ellison|Danny Ferry| |1988|Danny Manning|Rik Smits| |1987|David Robinson|Armen Gilliam| |1986|Brad Daugherty|Len Bias| |1985|Patrick Ewing|Wayman Tisdale| |1984|Hakeem Olajuwon|Sam Bowie| |1983|Ralph Sampson|Steve Stipanovich| |1982|James Worthy|Terry Cummings| |1981|Mark Aguirre|Isiah Thomas| |1980|Joe Barry Carroll|Darrell Griffith| |1979|Magic Johnson|David Greenwood| |1978|Mychal Thompson|Phil Ford| |1977|Kent Benson|Otis Birdsong| |1976|John Lucas|Scott May| |1975|David Thompson|Dave Meyers| |1974|Bill Walton|Marvin Barnes| |1973|Doug Collins|Jim Brewer| |1972|Larue Martin|Bob McAdoo| |1971|Austin Carr|Sidney Wicks| |1970|Bob Lanier|Rudy Tomjanovich| |1969|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Neal Walk| |1968|Elvin Hayes|Wes Unseld| |1967|Jimmy Walker|Earl Monroe| |1966|Cazzie Russell|Dave Bing| |1965|Fred Hetzel|Rick Barry| |1964|Jim Barnes|Joe Caldwell| |1963|Art Heyman|Rod Thorn| |1962|Bill McGill|Paul Hogue| |1961|Walt Bellamy|Tom Stith| |1960|Oscar Robertson|Jerry West| |1959|Bob Boozer|Bailey Howell| |1958|Elgin Baylor|Archie Dees| |1957|Rod Hundley|Charlie Tyra| |1956|Si Green|Bill Russell| |1955|Dick Ricketts|Maurice Stokes| |1954|Frank Selvy|Bob Pettit| |1953|Ray Felix|Bob Houbregs| |1952|Mark Workman|Jim Baechtold| |1951|Gene Melchiorre|Mel Hutchins| |1950|Charlie Share|Don Rehfeldt| |1949|Howie Shannon|Alex Groza| |1948|Andy Tonkovich|George Kok| |1947|Clifton McNeeley|Glen Selbo|"
"Yes that’s by design. The owner, Gores, loved to forget about timelines and trade picks away for win-now players. See: Blake Griffin. So Weaver traded a top-16/18 protected pick to both prevent this and keep their pick in tact. They traded it for a reason, and won’t be trading #1 to get it back"
"How is stating that the biggest star in ""America's pasttime"" needing an interpreter is bad for baseball's perception in America an example of a superiority complex. When the NBA had a game in Mexico City look at the reaction Luka got speaking Spanish, compared to Blake Griffin. Japan has a limit on foreign players for the same reasons."
"Now that I think of it this could've been a terrible decision by love. Some people thought he was ""Blake Griffin""ing it and could get bought out next year and would ball out but this showed he's really done"
Many players change their routines. Blake Griffin changed his to remove the hitch at the top and improved around 10% i believe. Tristan Thompson literally changed which hand he used. There's at least a dozen more that have changed little parts of their routine and set up to improve their stroke.   These guys are shooting most days during the off-season so can get in thousands of reps on a new routine before having to hit it in a game. Therefore it's much easier for them to change something.
I love how the nets got blake griffin for free and he was one of their best players. Seems fair /s
"Without looking at numbers I want to say he’s shooting better from the free throw line this series. Also, based off of measurables(size, strength, lateral quickness) Blake Griffin matched up with Giannis much better than Jae Crowder and DeAndre Ayton"
"&gt; Every year there is a vet who doesn’t play. That’s Kevin Love.  There shouldn't ideally be one, and if there is, it shouldn't be Kevin Love, it should be someone who actually played in this year's playoffs. Even Blake Griffin would be a hella better choice."
"I mean Blake griffin was almost the face of the league, so maybe?"
"&gt; Just a floor raising job--best defenders he plays in the east are Marcus Morris, old Horford...??   As opposed the defensive stud Blake Griffin and Danilo Gallinari"
"I mean, you don't call Blake Griffin a Giannis stopper, but he did just fine with rest of the team helping out.  Our problem last night was that they left the defender on a island with Giannis, I would rather see them double or triple team Giannis once he's in the paint and everyone rotate as needed."
"I’m sorry. I gave Pietrus some serious consideration.  But I currently have him behind LeBron James, Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh, Kevin Durant, LaMarcus Aldridge, Carmelo Anthony, Derrick Rose, Joakim Noah, Blake Griffin, Chris Paul, Ron Artest, Elton Brand, Tyson Chandler, Dirk Nowitzki, Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, and JJ Barrera for the 2000’s. Maybe if I have time, I’ll do a deep dive on his film and see if he has a case for moving ahead of those guys."
"IMO there have been at least 13 PFs that were capable of winning a scoring title at some point in their career, but for various reasons they didn't:  Tim Duncan  Karl Malone  Kevin Garnett  Dirk Nowitzki  Kevin McHale  Charles Barkley  Anthony Davis  Chris Webber  Blake Griffin  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Amar'e Stoudemire  Spencer Haywood  Tom Chambers"
"What in the fuck are you spouting? James Harden was injured, the man could not even drive and played terribly. NBA 3p% leader Joe Harris? Who played terribly in the playoffs and the Bucks series? Did you watch the game, did you actually see Joe Harris play? Kyrie for 3 and a half games you mean. You say it like Blake griffin right now in his career isn't merely a role player lol"
Blake Griffin would be a good one to do
"Don't get me wrong, with the right coach, offensive system and talent around Zion, he could be a top fifty NBA player ever. His athleticism reminds me of a Young Blake Griffin with an all around game of Charles Barkley. NBA fans want Williamson to be in games that matter, including NBA playoff games. His injury history for such a young man is frustrating."
Trae young is already young   Tacko fall would be a season  Blake Griffin would be fucking insane to see
"Yes - Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Jokic, Kyrie   Yes, but he shouldn’t - Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin  No - Paul George, Kevin Love, Rudy Gobert, Andre Iguodala  Absolutely not - Kemba Walker"
Cp3 and Blake Griffin
Fun fact Kevin Love and Blake Griffin both recorded about 35 in their Max vertical leap in the combine. KLove no step vert was 29 Blake had 32 in his no step vert.
"Or he's not the high flying athletic freak that he was advertised to be. He's very good, but he's not Blake Griffin 2.0 that people were hoping for."
He got suspended for pushing that flopping bitch Blake Griffin into the ground. Was after the game too since he did it right in front of the refs who did nothing because they were seeing Griffin push Andre in the back all game.
My  favorite is when [Blake Griffin murdered him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8vbdA0wGuI).
Good assessment. I hopped on the bandwagon when Blake Griffin joined back in 2010 and I’ve been a fan ever since. I have a friend that’s been a fan since the 2000’s. Personally I’ve been rocking with the team for nearly a decade at this point so i can never see myself leaving the fandom. I go to a few games every year to show support.
Blake Griffin
"If I were the coach I would work on 3 things with the 6th man. I would make the player a 4 on offense and a 2 on defense.   1) Free throws - so he cannot be exploited by the Hack a Shaq  2) Off ball screens - To free up teammates   3) Fitness and hustle - moving continually on offense as a distraction.  When the 6th man is on the floor I would run a 2-3 zone with the 6th man hiding on the Right corner.   I think if we use the current nets roster but add one more star I think it would be enough to win eg. Kyrie, Harden, Durant, Griffin, KAT (or any other all NBA level centre)  TLDR - the average American at this point is just a 5'9"" Blake Griffin."
lmfao i just got into basketball this year so a bunch of the beefs are new to me.   all i know about blake griffin is he used to be really good (i think on the clippers) now he’s alright and on the nets
Oh boy. Why dont you sit down for a story they will shove up your ass.   TL;DR: he pulled a better version of Blake Griffin with the pistons.
"The bucks played KD 1v1 even though his teammates were down. According to holiday they were not help defending and if the net got to beat them KD should score 60 and he nearly did.    We all knew KD is an elite scorer but that serie highlighted his great passing. In the second half of game 5 when he wasn't missing the bucks decided to double him and he found the open man everytime and that led to that Jeff green monster performance.they returned to playing him 1v1 afterwards.  I think a lot of credit should be given to Jeff green . Bruce brown and Blake Griffin, nobody was expecting that of them but they stepped up big and outplayed the bucks starters outside of Giannis khris offensively.   The analyst were hyping up the bucks because that what they always do against great teams. So many teams were supposed to be a great challenge to the Heatles. The nets are a better team Top down against the bucks . better starters and better bench even without this year's addition."
D’Angelo Russell  Jordan Clarkson  Devin Booker  Kyle Kuzma  Blake Griffin
"kawhi PG clippers reached conf finals in 2 years, CP3 blake griffin and DAJ never got there in more years. Kawhi is just a superior player."

Lmao joe Harris sucked and Blake Griffin is way past his days. Giannis had way more help and barely won. 2021 bucks aren’t even a top 3 team
"Lol you aren’t even a Nets fan and I see you defending the Nets more than actual Nets fans.   Every one including bucks fans know if they were healthy we would have lost. Superteams are meant to win, that’s why they are formed. But when you have a super team you lose out on depth and even for a team like the Nets they has decent depth. Joe Harris was good during the regular season, Blake Griffin was having a pretty good year, Bruce BRown had his games where he did good, Mike James even had good games. You can discredit our run as much as you want and bitch at people who talk good about Giannis but it ain’t gonna change the fact Giannis has a ring and Harden doesn’t (which I assume is why you are always so bitchy towards anyone saying good things about Giannis)"
Blake was playing his best basketball in 6 years?  The dude was 2 years removed from arguably his best offensive season ever in Detroit.  Let’s not overrate Blake Griffin with Brooklyn.  He was a fine role player.
"After Kyrie got injured, KD could've taken over in game 4. He didn't. Score is 2-2. All KD has to do is get 2 more wins by himself with good help from Blake Griffin. He drops his best performance and gets them to a win. 3-2. Fails the next game. Fails the game after that after dropping 0/6 in overtime.     He didn't win."
I saw similar predictions when Lebron went to Miami. A washed Blake Griffin and Deandre do not offer the threat from their days at the Clippers.
"So people like Dominique Wilkins, Shawn Kemp, Lob city era Blake Griffin aren't skilled enough? Let's also add Shaq to that list aswell since he can't shoot but has massive size and crazy athleticism , in your sentence you would take somone more skilled people than these people so that means someone like Jamal Crawford over Shaq, Dom, etc since he can shoot, handles, and not just post/run/dunk"
"&gt;KD did nothing 'by himself'.  You seem to be taking things way too literally. By your logic, I could argue that Lebron didn't do anything 'by himself' when carrying the Cavs in 2018 because he needed performances from Kevin Love and other role players to win.   &gt;he needed help, he wasn't close without it.  This literally could apply to any NBA great. No one wins without *some* help. Seems like a pretty useless point to make.   I'll put it this way: KD, with barely any consistent help after Game 3, with the exception of Blake Griffin, nearly willed the Nets to a series victory over the Bucks."
"Even crazier to me was how often the Spurs relied on him repeatedly in the low post in the 2015 playoffs against the Clippers younger and spryer big men. At age 39 playing against DeAndre Jordan, Big Baby Davis, and Blake Griffin, Tim was the Spurs best offensive weapon in that series. Averaged 19-11 on 60% FG shooting."
wrong - 2024 Blake Griffin signs with the Seattle Floors
"To use an example, I'd be satisfied with Blake Griffin or John Wall with #1 picks. But the average value of the first pick is probably lower, like a Jrue Holiday, but I wouldn't happy with that at all."
"&gt;Yeah, they collapsed, but they didn’t started camped way off their man. Defenses react differently to a kick out to Middleton or Holiday than one-legged James Harden and ancient Blake Griffin.  I... I tried reading this but man, I have no clue what you're saying."
"Yeah, they collapsed, but they didn’t started camped way off their man. Defenses react differently to a kick out to Middleton or Holiday than one-legged James Harden and ancient Blake Griffin."
"This is the last time Jm saying this. Fucking a Christ. KD couldn’t shoot layups and dunks because the rest of his team were a bunch minimum, kind of okay Blake Griffin, and James Harden with one leg. Just take the fucking L.   Let’s say 2 Kevin Durants drop basically the same numbers, but one plays on that injury plagued Nets team and the other plays on the ‘17 Warriors. What performance is more impressive?"
Basically the only person on the Nets that’s a shell of their former selves that came to mind is Blake Griffin. Don’t get me wrong he’d be awesome next to the Nets big 3 but that is nowhere near as good as the Lakers roster 8 years ago plus current AD.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/10006201-report-blake-griffin-was-told-by-celtics-player-not-to-join-bos-due-to-dysfunction.amp.html  Nah just fostering a negative culture.
"Blake Griffin was nba’s darling back then, he got away with a lot of offensive fouls cuz his dunks were cool and he jumped over a Kia. For instance, both of these signature dunks on [Paul Gasol](https://youtu.be/PzxFJa6rfsg) were arguably offensive fouls. First one is debatable, second one is definitely an offensive foul + a flagrant."
 Easier teams? Lebron shit on a 73 win team while leading BOTH TEAMS in EVERYTHING  God i wish i could have seen your bitter face when he went down as the GOAT in 2016    Already a proven fact that the worst team LeGOAT faced in the finals is better than the best team Jordan faced in the d league expansion era  Shawn kemp is literaly a poor mans blake griffin and he was the best player on a team in the finals LMFAO   Blocked troll not gonna go back and forth with someone with ZERO NBA knowledge
"If you ever wanna see a player give up, watch Blake Griffin in this 4th quarter. Laziest defense you will ever see."
And Blake “2nd wind” Griffin
LOL my ass. Giannis beating up on a old blake griffin got these bucks fans bold  Giannis is never sniffing a finals again. The 2021 bucks legit weren’t even a top 3 team
"Depends on how you look at it. The Hornets sucked, so there isn’t much to be said about that part of his career. In 2012, the Clippers lost to the Spurs, who were better than them. In 2013, they lost to the Grizzlies more due to Blake Griffin underperforming than Chris Paul.  In 2014, they lost to the Thunder partly due to Paul fucking up and partly due to the Thunder being better than them. In 2015, that 3-1 choke was able to occur because CP3 missed the first two games of the series (including a loss by 6 points). They lost in 2016 and 2017 because of injuries. Then he got traded to the Rockets and got injured there in 2018 before just sucking in 2019. Then he got booted to the Thunder where most people didn’t even think he was going to make the playoffs before losing in the first round. This man lost 4 opportunities in a row at one point that could be pointed towards injuries. The only times you can really say it was CP3’s fault are 2014 and 2019. The rest of the years are either on other people or injuries."
"Lol no. It was KD and Blake Griffin against the bucks, harden and Irving make up a giant amount of third salary cap and we’re both injured  Bucks had no business winning that match up"
"Don’t know what the stat was this year but in 2020 he averaged an offensive foul a game. For some guys (notably Blake Griffin and Trevor Ariza) half their defensive plan against him is “flop hard and get the charge”, plus a bunch of other guys who don’t flop for it but still go for the charge every time he looks like driving.  Honestly if you’re brave enough to take a charge from a full speed Giannis you’ve earned the call anyway."
"&gt; the raptors only won that title because KD and Klay were hurt lol.  and KD only won any titles because he joined the team that knocked him out of the playoffs after he choked a 3-1 lead over them  &gt; Also KD literally carried a bunch of scrubs and a half legged harden to almost taking out the eventual champions by hitting big shot after big shot  how did he ""carry"" when kyrie played for 3 of those games? interesting to hear that blake griffin and league-leader in 3pt shooting joe harris are scrubs now"
"Yeah, I understand we are top heavy... but so is every other championship caliber team rn  But outside our ""top heavy team"" we have the best spot up shooter in the league, a ball handler we desperately needed last season, a young center who has some crazy fast mobility, blake griffin and bruce brown, both of whom played significant play off minutes in a seven game series to the champs.   This is just an outrageous take"
Fuck Blake Griffin
"Absolutely. One of my favorite basketball stats is that, in (I think) 2019, Ersan drew 49 charges in 1231 minutes. The next highest was Blake Griffin with 30 charges in 2622 minutes. Ridiculous."
KD and Harden together on a team? Definitely. KD and Harden together minus Kyrie's salary? That's a bit harder. They were starting Blake Griffin at center in the playoffs. They're a little thin
"The dude edited his comment, he had Blake Griffin listed twice"
Don't forget Blake Griffin
"Collins has been getting a lot of hate, but it was his first playoffs and the teams Atlanta played all had good to great veterans at the PF rotation.  He was a young guy going against Blake Griffin, Giannis, Bobby Portis, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green, and Julius Randle. That would be a tough gauntlet for any PF's first playoff run."
Lakers fuck them up lol they almost let KD and blake Griffin beat them
"The one where two Nets players are holding Brook Lopez' arms down without a whistle with barely minutes left in the game was the worst one for me. That and Blake Griffin grabbing PJ off ball, causing PJ to get his 6th foul and get sent out when he tried to get away."
Blake Griffin and CP3 turned the Clippers into Flop City.
"[Here's the list of past Summer League MVPs.](https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/summer/1/NBA-Summer-League/0/awards)  Of the first-year players who have won it (goes back to 2006), it's just Randy Foye, Jerryd Bayless, Blake Griffin, John Wall, Damian Lillard, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Clark, and now Davion Mitchell and Cam Thomas. Interesting list of players."
"Yep. By contrast on first picks overall win shares:  48, 20.8, 65.9, 242, 138.2, 50.6, 18.9, 7.3, 42.8, 77.2, 44.1  So, if the first pick gets you a 50% chance of getting: Lebron, Blake Griffin, John wall, Derrick rose, Dwight Howard, or Yao Ming   That’s a better than 50% chance at an all NBA player. The two biggest busts are Bargaini and Oden."
I thought it was Vince Carter for the longest time but it  gotta be Zach Lavine or Blake Griffin.
Prime Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin
I thought it was Blake Griffin?
Blake Griffin had 25/6/6 on 59% ts. That playoffs like what are you even talking about.
Healthy Drummond wouldve outplayed a Blake Griffin who couldnt even run or jump if Drummond wasn't a complete and utter bum.    Drummond averaged a +- of -70 ! That was twice as bad as the rest of the Pistons combined. Casey had to bench him for crying out loud. Drummond is the worst center in the league.
Blake Griffin was amazing the playoffs. I don’t think anyone is claiming Drummond is Blake Griffin.
"Drummond wasn't fine in 2019, he was downright awful and had a terrible attitude to boot. He let Blake Griffin on 1 knee outplay him in the playoffs."
"Not sure how notable it is, but I was at the game a few years back ('17, I think) where JJ Barea knocked Blake Griffin on his ass, and JJ got a standing ovation walking off the court after getting ejected.  Good times."
"Basketball Reference has Rondo at a 60.5% chance of making the hall.  And there is a lot of guys with lower odds that made it in and he is above active players like Klay and Draymond, Blake Griffin, Jimmy Butler"
Paul George. Loved him during his Pacers stint.  Blake Griffin too.
"Blake Griffin, according to reports"
"Well, Hanamichi Sakuragi actually. But if you're asking about NBA, then it's probably Blake Griffin"
Young Blake Griffin-esque
I think Blake griffin
Blake Griffin looks like a fat playground bully
John Wall then Blake Griffin.   Griffin's contract is better put into perspective when you think about the fact that he's being paid nearly $40M for a level of play worthy of a vet min deal.   Thank jebus it's ending this year.
Technically they can still trade him. Now other teams will have guaranteed years after trading for him. This happened with us and Blake Griffin and happens a lot in the league.
Ben Simmons?  Rudy Gobert?  Zach Lavine?  Blake Griffin(in DETROIT?) D'Angelo Russel? ANDRE DRUMMOND? John Wall?  Demarcus Cousins?  De'Andre Jordan?  Melo?  Isiah Thomas? Kevin Love? Demar Derozan? Lamarcus Aldridge?
“Hey this is Blake Griffin.”
"You don't fuck around in Detroit, period.   Unless you're Blake Griffin..."
Blake Griffin is getting 30M this year
I have nothing to add to this discussion but this video reminded me that Blake griffin is a [real person ](https://i.imgur.com/h0UpoAe.jpg)
Blake Griffin smiled like an evil Bond villain.
"I have Durant at 2 under Lebron. Durant is obv fantastic, but IMO is overrated right now because of one series he played really well in (and still lost despite having 2 all star teammates play for 2-3 games each and Blake Griffin). Lebron was an MVP favorite up until his ankle sprain.  Kawhi may be better than Durant actually as well, but just doesn’t have Harden. Giannis I think is very close also."
Prime Blake Griffin &gt; prime Draymond green
"Yeah I was gonna say, I just looked at Zion’s box score stats this past season relative to the league and Griffin’s relative to the league in his 2014 season. Blake was ranked higher in all of ppg/apg/rpg than Zion even though Zion’s raw numbers look better in a vacuum. And for ppg and fg% specifically, Blake was 10th in the former and 7th in the latter during his 2012 season. This past season, Zion was 10th and 8th.  I feel like I’ve seen this kind of thing a lot recently where people bring up young players’ stats today in comparison to players like Griffin or KG or Kobe or CP3 or Lebron or whoever and I just don’t think those comparisons can be meaningful without putting them in context."
"Yeah Kuminga is good, but that is not a game that ages well. That's Blake Griffin level of reckless abandon."
I’m riding with you on that crazy boat. He is a beefier more explosive Blake Griffin.
"Regular season awards mean next to nothing to me. We just saw the regular season DPOY get torched by Terrance mann, Giannis was a DPOY and they made him sit in the corner and guard Blake Griffin while KD scored 50. Beating 36 year old chris Paul and Devin booker is nothing compared to beating Steph curry, klay and dray."
"You lost me at perimeter defense being less important than paint defense, that’s just inaccurate my man. All I know is, kawhi beat Giannis is 6. We saw what happened to toronto after kawhi left. Giannis was an inch away from losing in round 2 to Kevin Durant and Blake griffin. Giannis’ lack of shooting is the biggest possible hole a player can have.  While kawhi was scoring 45 and locking luka down Giannis was forced to hide in corner because he couldn’t guard KD. Saying that Giannis bent his leg in the wrong direction and then came back like he played through a broken leg is just stupid. It was absolutely incredible that he was able to play through the injury, but there was no structural damage so that’s completely immaterial.  If the question is who do I want for a full season, the majority of people are going to say Giannis and that’s understandable, but if you want the best chance to win in the playoffs it’s kawhi without question."
Bro is pretty much today's Blake Griffin. I'm just waiting till they're gonna start fouling him hard.
"Zion’s health definitely concerns me. I feel like he’ll be similar to Blake Griffin, though prob eat better in his prime before an injury slows him down"
This thread is full of wild takes. Blake Griffin and Kyrie are like if you took NBA street Vol. 2 fictional legends and put them in real life.
Coach Nash and Blake Griffin must do some crazy shit in the locker room.
"Came here to say D-Will. The other night I saw a clip of him getting absolutely obliterated at the rim by Blake Griffin on a dunk attempt, and remembered “that’s right, he played for the Nets too!”"
Did that Blake Griffin child support story end up being debunked a few years back? I’m thinking these numbers are suuper inflated just to stir up some buzz
Blake Griffin
Miles Bridges. His improvement year on year has been stunning. guy was just an athlete in year 1 who was a mediocre dribbler. Now he is a hyperathletic playmaking small ball 4. He reminds me of Blake Griffin and would not shock me if he a blow up this season with a more developed Lamelo getting him easier looks
"Why stop there? Shooting of Klay, defense of Bill Russell, shot making of Kobe, passing of Stockton, hops of prime Blake Griffin, size of Wilt Chamberlain, dick of Wilt Chamberlain….."
"At least you stopped mentioning Boston, and realized he didn’t lose the locker room there.   “Rivers became as prominent a character in the workplace drama as pail or griffin or any other member in the lockerroom”  Ok I can agree with that. He entire team wasn’t against Doc. He was a part of the drama just like the main players on that team were. They were all a bunch of toxic individuals who couldn’t put their egos aside to win. When your leaders are Blake and cp3, the team is never gonna be lacking any drama. Cp3 isn’t easy to get along with, and we know the shit Blake has been suspended for.  Do you even know what losing the lockerroom means? He was never fired specifically cause his players didn’t want him. He never lost the entire locker room where everybody stopped listening to him.   Losing the lockerroom is what happened to David blatt. Or more recently Lloyd pierce and Nate bjorkgren from last season. Guys that had their team playing worse cause they gave up on him.   He wouldn’t even be hired again and again if he’s known for losing the locker room in every team he’s been on.  He was fired once for losing the lockerroom and that was 2020."
Blake Griffin was a star (fringe superstar?) for quite some time before Injuries and age began to zap his athleticism.   He was electric with the lob city clippers. I’m a Memphis fan and I went to a lot of the clips-grizzlies playoff series back then. Dude was awesome to watch live.   This years playoffs certainly showed that he still has a decent bit left in the tank.
"The Clippers were the red-headed step child of LA and got a lot of pity fandom from Laker die hards historically because they always sucked so much... until they got Blake Griffin &amp; CP3 and they were starting to get good.  For me I started really turning on the Clippers when I watched them play the Lakers when they started getting good around the BG &amp; CP3 era starting.  It was a playoff atmosphere, you could see by the intensity of the games that they really wanted to show Lakers and LA that they were trying to make a name for themselves and not just be in the Lakers shadow forever, as they should always be.  So around that time I started hating the Clippers.  You could tell the Lakers were having none of it too, the games were always really intense and lots of chippy plays, jawing at each other etc.  Remember this is prime CP3 with all the same bullshit he does now, so it was always incredibly frustrating to watch him do that shit against us.  Anyway, fuck the Clippers forever, I hope they leave LA one day."
"I'm a bucks fan but don't get it. There ar plenty of other things I can hate on Harden for if I want to.  At this point it's clear neither of them care. The only player I think Giannis actively really dislikes is Blake Griffin, but there has never been any talk to indicate it. Just what I see on the court"
"Blake Griffin, really hopes he gets the chip"
this is a load of fat turd. Lakers fans have been shitting on the Clippers for over a decade - even before Blake Griffin.
"Reminds me of what the Cippers said to Griffin to get him to re-sign:  ""....for Blake to stay where he belongs - in Los Angeles.""  We all know how that turned out."
Yes. Chris Paul and Blake Griffin used to get booed when they went to Dodgers games.
"&gt; His team played well.  Nah he wasn't the only reason they lost.  Also I disagree with letting GMs have all the control. There's no guarantee your favorite players will actually stay with their team. Look at how the Clippers traded Blake Griffin, how the Rators traded DeRozan. GMs will always look to shake things up. I think it's only fair that players also have a bit of a say in things.  That said, some things can probably adjusted to avoid the whole signing and extension and wanting out straight away. Maybe no-trade clauses on max extensions should apply to the first 2 years of the contract."
"&gt;So a bunch of prime of their career hall of famers in the west and a bunch of up and comers and perrenial losers in the east?  lol @ losers and up comers as **accurate** for classifying Derozan, Butler, Giannis, Melo, PG, and Lowry. And no, I did not compare them to Durant, Curry, Harden, AD , Kawhi, Westbrook, Prime Boogie, left out players like Dame, CP3, Blake Griffin, Tim Duncan, Lamarcus Aldridge, Dwight Howard, Dirk, because there is no need to do so.   I compared them only to, themselves, and the celebrated status they enjoy.   Therefore I stick my argument, that those players are comparably effective as the West stars. Plus I chose to use that year's ASG roster, because it gave the best **real time** window into who all was playing at an elite level that season when the East was so ""weak"" as some people imagined."
"So a bunch of prime of their career hall of famers in the west and a bunch of up and comers and perrenial losers in the east? Just read your own list, your comparing Derozan, Butler, young Giannis, Wall, Melo, recovering PG , Lowry, Kemba, and Milsap ..... to Durant, Curry, Harden, AD , Kawhi, Westbrook, Prime Boogie, left out players like Dame, CP3, Blake Griffin, Tim Duncan, Lamarcus Aldridge, Dwight Howard, Dirk.   In fact here is a top 100 list from 2016 , 13 of the top 16 are western conference players. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/nba/2015/08/25/top-100-nba-players-2016"
"Exactly. If it was the lakers that did IT dirty, but they still had bron recruiting, ADs dad wouldn’t have said any of that shit. They still would’ve done anything to get to the lakers.   That stuff doesn’t matter that much. It’s mostly about location and how good the team is.  You think kawhi gave a fuck about how the clippers treated Blake griffin."
"I can't describe the emotions seeing Joe Harris shoot open 3's in that series. ""NO! No wait maybe it's good! No wait it's still Joe Harris on an open three!"" and then I'd usually experience relief.  That said only *two* Bucks players shot better from 3 than Harris did that series. Jeff Green and Blake Griffin were basically stealing everyone's ability to hit 3's."
"From his standpoint of course it is understandable to want be close to home, especially with children, especially in the middle of a public health crisis. As a human that’s makes total sense.  But think about what he asked. He asked for a buy out, for the owner to pay him a years salary, half his total deal, to not play for them. A year after signing there. It’s not like he was Blake Griffin or LMA who played for years and put in a lot for the organizations that bought them out. And one of his stated reasons was they didn’t have the defenders to cover for his bad defense. Like, that’s not fair. And they traded him to a good spot basketball wise"
"Apologies then cz I misunderstood your reply to mean he felt wronged because he is a human and not for the actual reasons he gave. What do you particularly think about his gripes such as not getting a buyout when other players with much more money left on their contracts e.g. LMA, Blake Griffin  ..were able to get one. And then getting traded for a late 2nd round pick which was flipped for even less money than the Pelicans would have saved in a buyout? Or Griff promising him that if he reported to camp and gave it a month then Griff would take care of him?"
Blake Griffin and Brook Lopez are on two teams
"Haha, yeah, i don't know why he used all three Antetokounmpos and then reused guys like Cory Joseph and Blake Griffin. What surprised me even more was when i scrolled up to see he DIDN'T have a Clippers flair."
"Lol, rondo has super long arms, blake griffin is around average, it's not the other way around"
Blake Griffin ain't even top 100 lmao
yeah what Blake Griffin is white and also he’s black
"My guess is Yes, if they really put the effort into being a good General Manager + President of Basketball Operations. Also, having bad ownership might hold them back.  I'll give you an example. In 2009, the Timberwolves drafted Ricky Rubio #5 and Jonny Flynn at #6. The GSW take Steph Curry at #7. Blake Griffin, Hasheem Thabeet, James Harden, and Tyreke Evans were also taken ahead of Curry. I think the average hardcore NBA fan goes with Curry, a super good shooter and son of an NBA player over Flynn.  https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/stephen-curry-scouting-report-davidson-2009-nba-draft-warriors/odgsfr1n0zs517flvxfb3lg5m"
Zion is closer to Blake Griffin than Batkley imo
"In regards to legacy talk, I’m not blowing All-Star selections off because they mean a lot for guys like Joe Johnson or Blake Griffin.  But for GOAT talk.. I think it’s one aspect people don’t really look at.. there’s no real difference in 5 or 7.. or 9 or 12.. it’s kind of a useless measurement the higher up the echelon we go. I’ll look at All-NBA, DPOY, MVP’s etc and those bold way more weight than an All-Star selection."
Blake Griffin
"You're a) lying, b) really underrating the rest of the Bucks, or c) think Kyrie is way better than he is or that this is 2014 Blake Griffin"
"I know I’m not super old or anything but those Lob City Clippers were the most talented team I’ve seen not even make it to the Finals.   Prime Blake Griffin, Chris Paul, Deandre Jordan, JJ reddick? That team was stacked."
Blake Griffin
"Giannis was being guarded by astute defender Blake griffin while Kd was getting pj tucker, because he was cooking giannis every time they switched tbh"
Who is the black Blake Griffin?
Blake Griffin isn’t even white lol
"I don’t think it’s single digit percentage at all. You won’t always get the same caliber of a player but I’m pretty sure I can name one or two star players that were available on the market for the last 5. Last year, Harden and Vucevic became available. The year before D’angelo Russell became available. The year before that Kawhi Leonard, Kristaps Porzingis, Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris became available. Year before that it was an all-star level Blake Griffin. You see where I’m going with this? Literally every player I just named when added to this roster would keep them contending at a high level if they received them at the level they played at the time to today (other than maybe Vucevic since he plays the same position as Embiid). These happen far more often than you think and in recent times, rather than being a single digit percent chance of happening on a season by season basis, over the last 5 years it has happened 100% of the time."
Hijacking this to ask- during JJ's pod with Blake Griffin they referred to David Griffin as Blake's uncle...is this true or was that just a joke?
"I wonder if they could put a penalty on trades happening early in a contract. Prevents players wanting out early, and also prevents a Blake Griffin with the Clippers situation."
"No, pretty much 55/60 rookies priority is already fit (propably an even bigger percentage for internationals) and when it comes down to those elite 5 talents, I think it isn't that easy. I doubt Zion (as an example) would have gone to the Lakers being a 2nd unit guy behind LBJ and Davis, but I do think Charlotte would have had a good chance. Derrick Rose would have ended up in Chicago for sure and OKC would have had a good chance to get Blake Griffin or Trae Young. Back in 2013 OKC would have been the team that could have snatched some elite rookie, in the 2000s San Antonio and Detroit could have delivered great opportunities. I think this 'big market doomsday scenario' isn't really realistic. They all have billionaires funding the whole thing, there are enough options convincing a young player of yourself, especially those who just want to ball. If a Luka Doncic is ballsy enough to step into the spotlight right away, then I'm also cool with it."
"I don't know about *keeping* star players in smaller markets, but it's for sure *getting* them there.   Drafting aside, it still feels like every year a handful of small market teams still have some of the best talent in the league signed to long, expensive contracts. I'm no expert, but I imagine that the teams all understand that rising 3rd, 4th contract players are mostly looking to play in big markets.   Without this implicit deal structure, I don't think Blake Griffin plays in Detroit, I don't think Giannis signs his huge extension, Dame doesn't sign his extension... other examples."
CP3/PG13/Kawhi/Wilkins/Malone  6 man: Blake Griffin
"No, because if you are using two different shooting forms, you are doubling the amount of time it will take you to expand your range. Look at Blake Griffin, he was a terrible FT shooter, imagine if he spent a lot of hours working on two different shooting strokes instead of working on one that will allow him to now shoot 3s."
Clippers   PG: Chris Paul  SG: Paul George  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Blake Griffin C: Bob McAdoo
Exactly. The Clippers didn't offer Blake Griffin a No Trade Clause.  Was that contract signed in good faith?
"Dont you think it goes both ways? stars sign long contracts with the belief they’ll stay with the organization yet many of them get shipped out (blake griffin, DeRozan) now that players can force a trade all of a sudden there’s something wrong"
Ben Simmons will get traded to the Nets for Blake Griffin and another player.
Blake Griffin saying maybe that isn't the best route sometimes lmao
I get:  1. LeBron 2. Kareem 3. Russ 4. Hakeem 5. Wilt 6. MJ 7. Vucevic 8. Bill Russell 9. Drummond 10. Brook Lopez 11. Valanciunas 12. DeMarcus Cousins 13. Tim Duncan 14. Kobe 15. Horford 16. Myles Turner 17. Marc Gasol 18. DeAndre Jordan 19. Steven Adams 20. Giannis 21. Pau 22. Kanter 23. Nurkic 24. Robin Lopez 25. LaMarcus Aldridge 26. McGee 27. Rose 28. Ibaka 29. Kidd 30. Steph 31. Dwight Howard 32. Shaq 33. Blake Griffin 34. KD 35. Kevin Love 36. Kelly Olynyk 37. Dame 38. AD 39. LaVine 40. Jokic 41. CP3 42. Pippen 43. Barkley  Very big-heavy. Something like 3/4 are bigs.
Watch it be blake griffin instead of someone like kyrie like everyone thinks.
Not a single NBA player who shot like 60% from the line and didn't make 3s in college ever became a serviceble shooter apart from Blake Griffin.
"Joel doesn't deserve any hate for his comments but Doc absolutely does. ""Coddling"" when defending a player to the media isn't really a thing. If he didn't hold him accountable in practice leading up to that point, that is a failure as a coach just as much as it would be on Simmons as a player. Not sticking up for your player after the end to a series is just brutal. There is a huge difference between when coaches call out effort or issues during a regular season game, but to do it right after the season ends? Doc is a master of saving his own ass - it's ALL Ben Simmons fault that the team lost in the playoffs and has nothing to do with the terrible rotations or failure to execute down the stretch. Doc leaves path of fault behind him at every stop. Ray Allen, Blake Griffin, Montrezl Harrell, hell - he even scared Tim Duncan away from joining the Magic. And once Simmons is gone, he will need to work quickly to find the new punching bag of the team. Tobias Harris better be careful!"
"He can improve, you can improve parts of your game but not your jumper  When you are a 6'10 elite passer, defender, rebounder and a great intereior finisher you can add like a post game, be more aggressive etc   Simmons has never been a good shooter in his life, not in Australia, not in highschool, not in college and i an average /r/nba user can tell you that there has been like 1 terrible shooter in NBA history that has turned it around and that's Blake Griffin, the others all had a base like Kawhi was a good FT% shooter, Kidd was a 36% 3 point shooter in college, they were either good FT% shooers or from 3, Simmons was never either  Sixers have a huge analytics deparatament they know this, Simmons can still be an amazing player without a jumper as he has been, he is an all star and All NBA without a jumper"
"KG to the 1996 Bulls would keep them a dynasty after MJ left.  Derrick Rose to the Grizzlies would be interesting, maybe they never trade Pau to the Lakers.  D-Wade to the Bucks with Michael Redd would be a contender.   OKC might have forfeited Harden to get Blake Griffin.  Jaylen Brown on the Warriors maybe makes them still legit contenders."
"Doc is the fucking worst.  There shouldn't be a third party trying to get Doc and Simmons to talk, Doc needs to be taking the lead on this.   Even before he was the sixers coach I knew him for blowing leads in playoff series and games, playing his stars way too many minutes and now he's blasting his notably media-conscious star player and further damaging his trade value while continuing to not bring anything interesting, new or particularly effective to the table in terms of xs and os over two decades of coaching, this guy is terrible.    Twenty-two years of stars on stars on stars, T-Mac, Rondo, Pierce, Allen, KG, Griffin, Blake, CP3, Deandre, Kawhi, PG, Embiid, Simmons and what does he have? One ring and two conference championships."
Got a picture with Blake Griffin on campus corner in college.
Nets. Blake Griffin and Jeff Green were great
"Yep, Shawn kemp was literally a poor mans Blake Griffin and he made the playoffs. The expansion era was a joke"
"He, kyrie, and harden don't need to play.    Patty mills, Tyler Johnson, Joe Harris and Blake Griffin is a good lineup."
The honorable mention (#6) should just be a picture of Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan.
"I went to a few Clippers games to watch Blake Griffin in his first full year, with all due respect the atmosphere felt like I was at a glorified high school or college game. Sat a few rows behind Sterling for $40 a ticket. Was such a mind blowing experience compared to a Mavs game where Cuban puts on a major production. Very happy to see someone owning the team that actually cares."
Punking Blake Griffin?
"[IF YOU'RE WATCHING THESE HIGHLIGHTS, WATCH THIS VIDEO. This series is my favourite series of NBA basketball ever. This video captures it really well. Can't tell you how many times I've replayed this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrMky4VN924&amp;ab_channel=MaxaMillion711)  I'll never forget the anger I had due to the rebounding in this series. You can see in the fourth quarter of this game alone how many times they had 3 or 4 Offensive Rebound attempts. Spurs were an ATG team and the Clippers put up a hell of a fight.  This series really had **everything**.   - Back and forth wins by both teams, check.  - Home and Away wins for both teams, check.  - Defending champion Spurs being favourited by the media, check.  - Superstars AND role players for both teams stepping up big time, check. (Boris Diaw was insane that series)  - Blake Griffin with a key game-losing turnover  - DeAndre Jordan goaltending Blake's potential game tying/winning shot, costing us the game.  - Spurs blowing the Clippers out (From memory I think this was the franchise's biggest playoffs loss ever at the time) (27pts)  - Chris Paul, the Clippers most impactful player in the series, gets injured in Game 7.  - Chris Paul hits insane game-winner  - Shot clock fiasco at the end of Game 7 which *definitely* gave the Clippers an advantage.  This is straight out of a fairytale."
PG: De'aaron Fox SG: Bradley Beal SF: Lebron PF: Siakam  C: Giannis  Jordan Clarkson Lou Williams Joe Ingles DeAndre Jordan Blake Griffin Buddy Hield Thybulle
Yes. Part of the bucks struggle is lack of floor general to dominate mismatches and get the offense moving.  Jrue for all his positives is not a great floor general. Often in the nets series for example he’d see Giannis with kyrie or harris on him in the post and then call for a screen. Zach Lowe was even on his podcast yelling “why screen! The mismatch is already there just give him the ball!”. Chris paul isn’t someone who would make that kind of mistake. If he has a big man like Blake griffin on him he isn’t calling for a screen he’s abusing him. If he see kyrie or harden pick up Giannis he’s isolating that side of the floor and letting him work in the post
Clippers fans will never have an identity in LA. CP3 and Blake Griffin are Clippers legends but they never get brought in the conversation of LA greats.
Yeah like this one. Others ive had over the yrs.   Ben Simmons-JaDeveon Clowney  Blake Griffin--Tony Romo  Chris Paul--Phillip Rivers  Lamar Jackson--Allen Iverson  Ja Morant--Kyler Murray  Jimmy Butler--Richard Sherman  Draymond Green--Donta Hightower  Kevin Garnett--Ed Reed  Rob Gronkowski--Shaq  Kyle Lowry--Steve Smith  Dirk Nowitzki--Antonio Gates
Blake Griffin
Steph Curry  Jason Kidd  Devin Booker  Blake Griffin  Kyle Kuzma  ...or are you going by blood quantum laws or something?
Blake Griffin even shot his rookie year and following with his release being bad already on the way down and so on. Not much and at a bad clip but it's not even comparable.
Very difficult but not impossible. You have to get a lot of repetitions in with the new form to rewire the muscle memory. Blake Griffin did it.
BONUS:  “I am Gandhi”  &gt;!-[Blake Griffin](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2719332-clippers-employees-wear-shirts-likening-blake-griffin-to-iconic-pioneers.amp.html)!&lt;
Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin.
Lmao stop and be objective for a minute man. When people say he didn’t have help we mean relative to the competition. Having Kyrie half the series is not the same as having Khris Middleton for the whole series. Blake Griffin is not comparable to Jrue Holiday. Bruce Brown and fucking Jeff Green going off in one of the four games he was healthy enough to play in is not comparable to Brook or PJ lol. They were so desperate they let Harden play absolutely terribly on one leg for 4 games for crying out loud. Like try and be objective for a second. That is not a good supporting cast.
Who would have thought Blake Griffin could be a decent player again?
"&gt;Neither team has taken the easy way out the way the Warriors did.   LMFAOOOO okay. Ig signing KD, Kyrie, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, Patty Mills, and trading for James Harden ain't the easy way? I hate the Lakers more than I hate the Nets, but you're out of your mind if you have a problem with the Warriors signing KD on top of their homegrown core that they built through good drafting and development, but no problem with a bunch of superstars grouping up together in Brooklyn, literally involving the same guy you had a problem with in Golden State."
Blake Griffin 2015 3PA: 0.5 (33%)  Blake Griffin 2016 3PA: 1.9 (33.6%)  Blake Griffin 2017 3PA: 5.6 (34.5%)
Yeah I'm expecting both him and Love to be bought out at some point this season.   Blake Griffin set the precedent for buyouts with 2 years remaining
The Thunder rivalry had a lot of mutual respect.  I never hated Adams or any of the other Thunder players.  Blake Griffin and Chris Paul on the other hand...
"I started following closely in like 2008, but I thought for sure that one was Blake Griffin lol"
Blake Griffin in Detroit.
"Giannis, Jrue, Khris, Mccollum, Brook Lopez with Donte Divencenzo, Bobby Portis and Grayson Allen off the bench  Vs.  KD, Harden, Kyrie, Joe Harris, Patty Mills with Blake Griffin, Bruce Brown and Lemarcus Aldrige off the bench.  Bucks match pure talent and probably win team fit here too. Second option is much worse from Harden to Jrue but Middleton is pretty close to Kyrie because of his defense and how valuable shooting is rn, while the Bucks have a better bench and Mccollum absolutely blows Joe Harris away as a player."
Blake Griffin is actually still a super star and just sandbagged it to get out of dirty icky Detroit because he dunked a couple times on the Nets
Blake griffin chose to never show up in Detroit
"Chris Bosh. Dude has 1 All NBA nod in his entire career and got easy all star game nods for playing in the East. Don't get me wrong he's a great player, but if he plays in the West he's a 3-5x all star and in the Blake Griffin/Kevin Love tier, instead folks on here overvalue his defense, remember him as a much better shooter than he was, and put him as a top 10 PF of all time which is ridiculous. Give me Pau Gasol 10/10. Hell I'd take healthy Amar'e over Bosh."
"LMAO no he wasn't.   His best season was 2016, where he was All NBA 3rd team. Lowry in '16 was not better than: LeBron, Steph, Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Kawhi, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, DeMarcus Cousins or Anthony Davis, that's 10 right there and then you have guys like Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, LaMarcus Aldridge are all IMO better and then guys like Blake Griffin, DeRozan, Millsap, Marc Gasol, Karl Anthony Towns, Gordon Hayward were debatedly better.   Lowry at his peak was a top 20 player for sure, but top 10 is a huge stretch. ESPN had him at #18 following his 2016 All NBA season, Sport's Illustrated had him at #34, Washington Post at #14, Fadeaway World had him outside their top 20, CBS at #17. Lowry was never a consensus top 10 guy."
"I read the threat title so many times before I realized it said Steve Blake not Blake Griffin.  I have no idea what was wrong with my brain, it was like one of those 3-d picture puzzles or something."
"It’ll be similar to the Blake Griffin situation   Mid way through the season, Houston will buy him out and just pay his large salary for the rest of the season and next year"
Then I guess Kemba Walker and Blake griffin are idiots. Sometimes millionaires with a passion for basketball care more about a chip than adding more millions to the millions they have...  Blake is only a year older than wall and the last healthy season he had was better than wall. How was he towards the end of his career but wall isn’t? He had two years on his contract and agreed to a buy out to go contend in Brooklyn.   Kemba Walker had 2 years left on his deal and accepted a buyout from OKC so he could go compete in New York.
"The Pistons did that for a decade and finally decided to go all-in on the tank and so far its going well. When we traded for Blake Griffin that was the epitome of trying to ""win now"" with a roster that wasn't even good enough to win a single playoff game. Unfortunately our owner and seemingly a majority of our fans were completely against tanking until last season."
"Dunk machines like Blake age poorly, as do players who miss a lot of time, so I don't think they are crazy for having BG in the mid-teens.  Blake went on to sit the majority of games over the next six seasons, the time frame projected here.  Embiid hadn't played an NBA game.  Giannis was coming off a rookie season where he averaged 7/4.  Payton was young and this is the type of shit that happens when you rely entirely on data, as this list did.  They admit that this may be a huge overranking, adding  &gt; So we have bona fide stars like Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green, Blake Griffin … and then we have Elfrid Payton?!? Is this CARMELO’s version of PECOTA’s infamous Wily Mo Pena projection? Time will tell, but Payton logged almost 2,500 minutes as a 20-year-old rookie last year while flashing excellent passing and defensive skills.   I'm just glad they provide us with some public player projection data, while I have to admit it's far from perfect it's the only gig in town so take it or leave it."
"That isn’t just the Carmelo metric. They added some other stuff to it and tinkered and the article is actually supposed to be a projection of who might be the better player over *the next six years* from when the article was posted. So no, they didn’t say that Elfrid Payton was more valuable than prime Blake Griffin. They just projected him to be the better player over the next six years.  Still a terrible projection in hindsight tho, but if you actually read it they don’t seem to be very confident in the projection for Elfrid either. They say if he developed a shot, maybe that could be true. And if he didnt then he would be worse than ricky rubio"
"[Yup, I found it.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-53-best-franchise-players-in-the-nba/)  According to their ""CARMELO"" system, in 2015, Elfrid Payton was the 14th best player in the NBA. Blake Griffin was #15."
"Even with all those teams, 60% don't sniff the finals.  Do other sports not have stupid teams?  What about Blake Griffin, Paul Milsap, LaMarcus Aldridge?"
Blake griffin weirdly
Blake Griffin is 6-9.
Why would *we* (The Pistons) do this? We have two young PGs with superstar potential (Cade/Hayes)? Why stunt the growth of one or both by picking up a 33 year old PG that is garbage for $40m a year?  Last time we traded for a contract like that was Blake Griffin and Pistons fans should all remember how Blake went...
Didn't these guys invent a metric that said Elfrid Payton was more valuable than Prime Blake Griffin?
"With recent buyouts like Andre Drummond, Blake Griffin and now this, I wonder if teams will start to be more weary about offering those sorts of deals in the first place."
"How the hell are places like Utah going to win a ring with shit like this happening?   Because, to be honest, they could probably contend for a title if they were able to pick up like Dwight, Blake Griffin, and Kendrick Nunn/Monk."
"All of this is just silly posturing, trying to make teams think there's no urgency to trade him, and to make Wall think they're perfectly fine paying him $44 million not to play this year. But let's be real, Houston would love to move on from Wall and not have to pay that remaining $92 million for him. If Wall wants to play this year, this is trying to get him to give back Blake Griffin and Kemba Walker kind of money for a buyout. If Wall is totally on board with just sitting out the season like Luol Deng then it's probably a stalemate until next summer when he'll almost surely get bought out. Otherwise I'll be interested to see if there's some pushback from Wall to force Houston's hand."
He did a bit where Norm went undercover as Blake Griffin. I’m sure someone will post a link here
Blake Griffin on a vet min is about 80% of that
Panic move for an amateur hour franchise. Blake Griffin on a vet min gives you 80% of the same production.
"Norm Macdonald died, and the world got a little bit darker.  Here's him joking around with Blake Griffin  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhf7kO0V6aQ"
"[Blake Griffin] (https://twitter.com/blakegriffin23/status/1437872143975337985) about this  &gt;my favorite press conference moment ever  I have to agree with Blake, such a unique personality. He will be missed. RIP Norm.  &gt;rip norm mcdonald. one of my first comedy hero’s. every single time i saw him, whether in person or on tv he always surpassed any expectations of how immensely funny he was. truly one of a kind. so lucky to have known you. you will be missed"
"Agreed. Blake Griffin had been meeting with Phoenix and was considering signing a max with them, but the Clippers lured him back with their bullshit presentation to him about how he'd be a Clipper for life and compared him to Gandhi and MLK. But the truth was they simply didn't want to lose an asset to free agency, so they lied to him to get him to re-sign and then traded him at the earliest possible opportunity. Judging by how Blake ended up having to give millions back to get out of his contract in Detroit, I'm sure if he could go back he'd have preferred to just choose his destination and sign there , rather than signing up to just be a trade chip for the Clippers rebuild effort."
Blake Griffin. He could have been something special...
Luka averaged 21/7/6 as a 19-year-old with European votes and still didn't make it.  It's going to take someone extremely special to be the first rookie All-Star since Blake Griffin.
Albert Haynesworth. And to Bradys credit knowing how to mitigate injury risk is a skill and it’s one that’s hard to teach you have to pick it up yourself. That applies for every sport. For some it’s physical preparation (Lebron for example) for others it’s knowing how to position yourself to take hits (Brady) and for everyone discipline and perspective are key Fighting for an extra yard or consistently dunking when you can just as easily lay the ball up (think Blake Griffin or early D Rose) holds players back in the long run
&gt; Blake Griffin is so divisive despite giving it his all  Blake Griffin is divisive because last season he absolutely did not give it his all.
"nets seem like they don't have a lot of depth  joe harris is OK but I wouldn't feel comfortable relying on him  blake griffin only does so much these days  patty mills is hot and cold  millsap and LMA are old and play very limited minutes  They definitely don't look like the world beaters everybody was projecting.  Even if harden gets back to how he was last season they're still gonna have poor depth  They need to get the kyrie situation resolved, either get him back on the floor or get his contract off the books and bring someone else in"
Hb got some insane clutch defense. Mavs fans you remember when he ripped Blake Griffin in the clutch
Blake Griffin
The Blake Griffin buzzer beater from that stretch is burned into my skull
Blake Griffin was forced to once upon a time
How did Jimmy Butler and Kevin Durant out-rebound Bam Adebayo and Blake Griffin?
"I don‘t think these guys do it, but I’d watch a studio show with any of Jimmy Butler or Blake Griffin."
Big booty Lowry forced Blake Griffin to pass out from the post 1v1 in the first quarter and now Harden too.
"Dwayne Wade as the calm collected guy, Richard Jefferson as the hilarious guy that is also very smart, Gilbert Arenas for the outrageous takes but genius insights, Draymond as the all around personality that has won multiple rings  &amp;#x200B;  EDIT FORGOT BLAKE GRIFFIN. Dude is absolutely hilarious and super articulate"
"Patty Mills, Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Blake Griffin, LMA, and Claxton is more than good enough to win a title with KD and Harden."
-	Blake Griffin as Shaq (although I think Shaq will stick around for many years)  -	Candace Parker or Dwyane Wade as Jet (prefer Candace) -	Draymond Green as Chuck -	I don’t really know who could replace EJ. Haven’t seen any Turner Sports people that have the mix of seriousness and humor he has.
"How about the Clippers screwing themselves with Luke Kennard on this deal:  Nets receive: G Landry Shamet and draft rights to F Reggie Perry (57th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft) from Los Angeles; G Bruce Brown from Detroit  Clippers receive: G Luke Kennard, C Justin Patton and four second-round draft picks (Portland 2023, Detroit 2024, 2025 and 2026) from Detroit; draft rights to G/F Jay Scrubb (55th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft) from Brooklyn  Pistons receive: Draft rights to Saddiq Bey (19th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft), F Dzanan Musa, draft rights to G Jaylen Hands and Toronto's 2021 second-round draft pick from Brooklyn; G Rodney McGruder and cash considerations from Los Angeles  You get .. Kennard, who you proceed to extend for a crazy price of 14 mil a year,(Mavs fans even mock the clips over it  https://fansided.com/2021/06/04/mavs-fans-are-taunting-luke-kennard-contract/#:~:text=In%20December%2C%20Kennard%20inked%20a,63%20games%20played%20this%20season )  and you gave away what would have been Saddiq Bey.  Saddiq is already much better than Kennard, and has a cheap rookie contract.  Disaster for the clips, payback for dealing the Pistons Blake hah.  The blake griffin trade is worse, in retrospect.  Pistons gave up Tobias Harris, Avery Bradley, Boban Marjanovic and future first- and second-round draft picks"
"oh my, [his first show was on Feb 1 2016](https://sports.yahoo.com/news/the-vertical-podcast-with-j-j--redick--the-blake-griffin-situation-144948954.html)"
"yeah you gotta be like a superstar celeb to get bothered in NYC. even then, actual NYers don't really care. i saw rajon rondo at il mulino a few weeks ago. not a single person gave a shit. saw blake griffin at lola taverna. again, nobody cared."
"If I go to Golden Corral every day, will I be Blake Griffin?"
Blake Griffin was gonna be the next GOAT
"&gt;yeah, at this point being Blake Griffin is a nice, positive outlook on his career, just because of the weight and how often he's been hurt in the NBA. if he can drop 30-40 pounds, I think he can be a dominant 15 year guy.  I mean, Griffin shattered his knee cap before he even played a real NBA game.   That injury is far worse than anything Zion has had so far.  Going to be funny when he's fine in a few weeks and crushing the league like last year. Rinse and repeat. This sub said he was a fat bum who was gonna bust at the start of last season."
"I got a list  1. CP3 2. Embiid 3. Harden 4. John Collins  5. Kelly Olynyk  6. Blake Griffin 7. Bam  8. Herro  9. Dragic 10. Booker 11. Crowder 12. AD 13. Bradley Beal   Fully prepared to get downvoted by fans of these guys, just can’t stand watching them sometimes."
Blake Griffin
Zions upside is Blake Griffin
Zion will be a less successful Blake Griffin
"Zion will be out of the league in 5 years or less. Greg Oden 2.0  I love watching him play and want him to succeed, but his build and playing style won't give him longevity in the NBA. He's a bigger Blake Griffin. Blake was able to improve his shot, but his numbers still plummeted after he left LAC and he's been plagued by knee and back injuries. I think Zion will be on that same path of he doesn't change his build and style quickly."
So you didn’t watch the Bucks Nets series last year? KD was half an inch from sending Giannis home with Blake griffin as the second best player on his team.
No he’s literally going to slowly transform into Blake griffin thanks to current advances in genetic reconstruction.
Blake Griffin has always been dirty to me.
Which Blake Griffin?
"yeah, at this point being Blake Griffin is a nice, positive outlook on his career, just because of the weight and how often he's been hurt in the NBA. if he can drop 30-40 pounds, I think he can be a dominant 15 year guy."
"Holy shit, this.  Blake Griffin sucks. That asshole beat the shit out of a member of the clippers staff and broke his hand. Blake Griffin also simulated oral sex from another (or maybe the same) member of the clippers staff by shoving his face into his crotch while sitting on the bench on live television.  Oh and yeah he's also dirty on the court. Fuck Blake."
Zion will be Blake Griffin if he went to Golden Corral every day.
"it's great that he's stepping up in a leadership role, but to me, this is indicative of a coaching problem / lack of vision.   some teams simply aquire talent, then rely on the talent to produce value for them.   ""hey here's the basketball: produce some wins for me"".   this leads to a lot of isoball. (i'm reminded of when the Pistons had Blake Griffin and they repeatedly just dumped the ball to him and expected him to do everything.)  other teams create a **system** to best utilize the talents of their stars, and obtain role players to complement their stars and work well in the system.   ""let's create a system that empowers you to be the best player you can be"". you know the teams here; Beautiful Game Spurs, Kerr Warriors, etc."
Blake Griffin. Idk how but somehow everyone seems to overlook his dirty plays. Maybe because he was a fan favourite who gained our sympathy due to his injuries but he ain't no clean player
"Well yeah, the owners aren't the ones playing for championships. The owners aren't missing birthdays and holidays with family members to play. The owners aren't getting life changing injuries playing either. The owners also don't get bashed and ruthlessly trash talked and shitted on on social media and social platforms because they played bad in a game.  It's funny how when owners and organizations fuck players over (a la Blake Griffin for example) it's ""just business"". The NBA is a business first and foremost. But when the tables is turned and a player does it, everyone is up in arms lmao sorry but you'll never convince me the players have too much power when they're the only reason you're watching said game. They're also the reason why the teams are worth the money they're worth and even then they still don't get a fraction of what these organizations actually make off them.  Is Simmons and the 76ers going about this completely wrong? Yes, 100%. But you'll never convince me the players have too much power when organizations can just discard you like stale bag of chips the minute they decide they don't want you anymore or better yet, use you as a scapegoat to save their own jobs. Fuck that.   These billionaires have their nba team keep going up in investment. Shut the fuck up there’s a reason why nba players are paid not what their worth with the salary cap"

Have refs started making that kind of call more in recent years? I'm not used to seeing it   If Blake Griffin could dunk like he used to he'd be getting crushed by calls for using the off-arm while dunking
&gt; Don't sign a 5 year contract if you can't handle a 5 year commitment.   Funny how that doesn’t work both ways. Ask Blake Griffin.
Was Kevin love trying to pull a Blake griffin? I didn't think he could be a productive player on an NBA team anymore.  Great game out of the Cavs.
I have seen Bam and Blake Griffin get away with murder on screens 🙈… This can be probably added to the screeners coaching manual 🤷‍♂️
WTF happened to Blake Griffin??? dude cant score anymore...
"Griffin played hard when he first got there. After he got injured yet again and saw the team wasn't going anywhere, he played way safer.   If Simmons had at least been around and tried to play like Blake did, this situation would be way different. He still wouldn't be liked but the situation would be salvageable."
They all have been since they rigged Blake Griffin to win it that one year
"You're only looking at a itemized lense. These are human beings too. You are ignoring the human side, Harden was a game away from the Finals and had a team he trusted, GM he trusted, coach he trusted. Then a new owner comes in and throws that all away, trades players for cash. You signed ro WI titles and be in the city you love. Now that's gone, so you request a trade. The contract is one sided. Look at Blake Griffin too, we want your number hanging from the rafter and win titles, oh here is Detroit good luck."
"The problem with that is that it also hurts the team. The Blake Griffin trade couldn't have happened, for example."
How about siding with the fans and not signing with either the players or the owners. WE ALL PAY THESE SALARIES.  The only reason anyone in the NBA is making a dollar is because people support the league with their wallets.  Everyone on r/nba acts like fans are some passive bystander in the success/outcomes of the NBA and it's pathetic.  It's OK to think that Blake Griffin getting a guaranteed 200 million dollars and then getting traded is a dick move but in the end isn't that big of a deal.  Does anyone feel like Blake Griffin was stealing money from his team for the hundreds of games he's missed to injury over the years?  What about fans who shell out significant money to see him play but he misses games? No compensation for them. Boo hoo Griffin has enough money to set up multiple generations of his family.
I’m not sure if it was Lowe or someone else who said players should only get the Supermax while they’re on the team that gave them the supermax. If Simmons signs the supermax and then demands a trade the contract should go down to a standard max. I think that would be highly effective.   Now idk how this would work in a Blake Griffin situation where he didn’t asked to be traded from the clippers but I’m sure there’s a way to make that work. Maybe in a circumstance where the agent or player demand a trade you remove the supermax and if a player does not request a trade you keep it?   Similarly if someone had a standard max and demands a trade maybe they lose 5-10% of their pay for the rest of that contract.  Of course this would end in a lockout.
"&gt; The Sixers will get players back for Simmons so what’s the point?  If you had read what he said, he believes they may not get back value. In effect, what GM would trade for Simmons if he's not willing to put in the work?  &gt; I don’t like the fact that Barkley can criticize Ben but stay silent when the Clippers traded Blake after just signing an extension?  TIL you have to speak up about everything or shut up about everything. You realize he's being asked because he's a former Sixer, right?  &gt; I’m for fairness and transparency and no hypocritical bs.  You just seem angry that Ben's being called out, tbh. Either way, I'm not trying to convince you. You started with calling Chuck out on forcing his way out of Philly and now you're at ""well, Chuck didn't say anything about Griffin, so it's all hypocritical""."
"Irving, James Harden, Durant, Blake Griffin, Paul Millsap, Patty Mills, Aldridge. I can’t remember anyone else :/"
Don’t forget Blake Griffin pretending to be injured/washed for years until Detroit finally paid him millions just to go away and all the sudden he’s throwing down putbacks.
Blake Griffin could have easily gotten a NTC if he wanted.
"I've heard when some guys sign long term, they tell the FO if things go south I want to be traded. In that case it's s win-win really. Who knows what happens behind closed doors  All I know is that 4-5 year commitment isn't what it used to be, on either side. Look at Blake Griffin and the clips"
Blake Griffin
I’d only agree with this if Max contracts came with no trade clauses. What the Clippers did to Blake Griffin was fucked up.  I’ve seen organizations screw players over for too long to not support player agency.
Dude was ass today period. He’s Blake griffin washed
"Let’s continue this train of logic. If Giannis goes up for a slam and Blake Griffin kisses the tip of his penis, just a little peck, is that a foul?"
Blake Griffin syndrome. Start shit and then act all confused when being addressed. Although in this situation I don't think it was Dwight's fault.
"Yesterday, Blake Griffin finished with 4 points, 3 rebounds, 0 assist on 1/6 shooting and 0/5 from three. Marvelous job Blake, fuck you!"
Blake Griffin. Jumping over a car and jumping over a car hood are two different things.
"It was a weak season for roty but it was nowhere near controversial, at least not to me.  Embiid only played 31 games out of 82. He also really wasn't a rookie, he missed not only one (Blake griffin/Ben Simmons) but two seasons because of injury and everyone else in the draft class was extremely raw at that point.  Even though Joel was the better player, Brogdon was consistent and put up solid numbers for the Bucks."
"Depends on the star. Steph Curry gets mauled and rarely gets the calls. Draymond Green got smacked in the face last game and it wasn't even reviewed. Back when he was a star Blake Griffin got screwed all the time on calls, and don't even mention this stuff in the vicinity of Nuggets fans if you don't want to hear them complain for like an hour about Jokic.  But the times when the call *isn't made and should be* don't justify it going uncalled at other times when it should be called."
"I love how people think guys who dominated the 90s wouldn't have the skillsets to dominate today's league. Fuckin Brook Lopez went like 10 years attempting 6 3s total, to all of a sudden launching 6 *a game*. Same with Blake Griffin.  You guys are all crazy."
"Luka, Blake griffin, Carmelo Anthony"
Clippers to Blake Griffin for the trade to Detroit
He shoots like Blake Griffin now.  By that I mean he’s got like a pseudo-hitch/late release that I would imagine flattens his arc and takes away some power.
Blake Griffin. I can’t stand him. Especially after he [shoved a trainer’s face into his crotch](https://youtu.be/W1t1dMg7sro)
I was thinking the Blake Griffin trade.
"No good reason - carmelo Anthony, why? His fans are the most annoying bunch. Loyal to the core. But annoying.  Good reasons- harden (flopper), and blake griffin (dirty player)"
Oh boy you’re in for a doozy.     Stern had a black 20 something year old girlfriend who recorded him saying not to bring black people to games.     Then Blake griffin talks about a “white Party” he threw (where you wear all white) and basically was showing off the clippers players to wealthy elite as like specimens and making uncomfortable comments about the players.
"It didn't last long, but athletic prime Blake Griffin was the sickest in-game dunker I've ever seen."

"It's Dominique. He changed the game.  Shawn Kemp would be second.  I actually think Blake Griffin would be third, followed by VC.  But it's Dominique and then Kemp and then everyone else, really."
"Prime Blake Griffin would finish that because he'd be holding down on his opponent's arms. Or shoulder, so he can't jump at all"
This guy has been living off the boston big 3 for years now... even in clippers is underperforming.. cp3 and Blake griffin in prime with nothing to show
"Long term outlook I'm not sure who is better though. Green may be one dimensional, but plenty of guys come in as largely one dimensional and grow into something much more.   On the Raptors itself you have Siakam who was just supposed to be a defense/energy guy and OG who was supposed to just be a defense guy.  Kawhi was just a defender, Steph was just a shooter, KD was just a scorer. And even for non-legends you have guys like Wall who was just an athletic finisher with decent vision, Blake Griffin who was just an athletic scorer, DeRozan who was just an athletic slasher, etc."
That was prime Blake Griffin-esque. Dude was smart to foul because that would have been an all-timer. Sheesh.
"It was prime Blake Griffin-esque, he was gonna catch a body."
Not sure why the corpse of Blake Griffin is getting superstar treatment from these refs tonight.
blake griffin spotting up for 3s is not it nash
Never thought Blake Griffin would become a 3-and-D player
"growing up w blake griffin as an explosive rookie at lob city, then seeing his career pan out how it has is honestly really disappointing bc this guy was once the most box office guy in the league"
Blake griffin is a certified bitch
Blake Griffin is one of the most annoying players in the League right now in terms of how much of a bitch he can be
Blake Griffin when he gets contact: ☠️🏥
that's the Blake Griffin block
You might be right.  I feel like there was a short period at the end of Pau's prime after those guys had slightly declined when we all agreed that Pau was #1 at the position.  But he started declining soon after that and Blake Griffin and Kevin Love were probably the best
"From my outside perspective Nash is good at 3 things.  1. Player likability.  2. His offensive schemes in the late game are pretty good. I know some people will comment ""hur dur, KD ISO, Harden ISO"" but take a look at the Nets series against the Bucks. They set their stay players up in good positions that leave them in a one on one and it forces teams to play up to the Nets.  3. utilization of players that are way past their prime or aren't as good as people think they are. This goes two fold. For example we know Blake Griffin is good, but he was utilized very well in the Bucks series as he played numerous minutes and had key roles in slowing Giannis down in certain possessions (i'm not calling him a giannis stopper at all). Furthermore, BGs passing was used very well.  A. Nic Claxton. I like Claxton, he's fun to watch but man is he useless in a noticeable amount of possessions, especially on defense. But Nash's trust in him allows for him to perform well when KD and Harden are on the court because he does a little bit of dirty work for them AND if they need to throw up a random lob or pass out of a triple team; Claxton has them."
"“Blake Griffin.. razzle dazzle, OHHHHH next level”"
"As a Warriors fan, I'll submit a few:  [Blake Griffin hits the side of the backboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMQ3-MqDA0) (thus beginning the legend of Kent Bazemore)  [Adonal Foyle misses the backboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkoNgq-O3R4) (Jim Barnett has to explain why it's not so bad)  [Nick Young guaranteed 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JG_wClmLUh8)"
"I’m talking about the Clippers and Blake Griffin. You should look it up. It’s probably described in much more than I can remember off of the top of my head.  I mean, his coach and teammates said he wasn’t good enough to the media first (IIRC), so their considerations went out the window imo."
"What's hilarious is that people were siding with Kawhi when he sat out.  Even Tony Parker and other players came out against him and said his injury was bullshit.  But because Ben Simmons wants out he is some kind of supervillain that the NBA has never seen before.  I think the posters on this subreddit are either too young or have a poor memory.  One of the greatest of all time, Kobe (RIP), refused to go to the team that drafted him and this is not the only incident of this happening.  Look at what Vince Carter did.  Look at what Harden did - showing up out of shape and pissing all his teammates off while playing like shit during games.  Yes he signed a contract but he asked out and you should respect that.  They hung a banner for Blake Griffin and compared him to Martin Luther King Jr before trading him to the worst bottom feeder in the league in the coldest state, Detroit.  Ownership doesnt give a SHIT about their players, but when a player tries to assert himself he is villainized."
There are two players who made me watch college basketball: Steph Curry and Blake Griffin. I was so happy when we drafted Curry. It was also amazing to see Knicks fan in dismay when we took their guy.
I dont like to bring up loyalty anymore because it means nothing.  no one really needs to be loyal to anyone in this...players and teams.  how did loyalty work out for Blake griffin where they traded him almost immediately into his contract?  why should ayton be loyal when suns won't give him a max?
"2001: Pau Gasol (3rd)  2002: Yao Ming (1st)  2003: LeBron James (1st), Carmelo Anthony (3rd)  2004: Dwight Howard (1st)  2005: Deron Williams (3rd)  2006: LaMarcus Aldridge (2nd)  2007: Kevin Durant (2nd)  2008: Derrick Rose (1st)  2009: Blake Griffin (1st), James Harden (3rd)  2010: John Wall (1st)  2011: Kyrie Irving (1st)  2012: Anthony Davis (1st), Bradley Beal (3rd)  2013: nil  2014: Joel Embiid (3rd)  2015: Karl-Anthony Towns (1st)  2016: Ben Simmons (1st), Brandon Ingram (2nd), Jaylen Brown (3rd)  2017: Jayson Tatum (3rd)  2018: Luka Doncic (3rd)  2019: Ja Morant (2nd)  You could argue that some of these players aren’t “superstars” but everyone I’ve listed is all-star calibre. Now you might be correct in that the top 3 in a draft does usually have a bust, but your claim that top picks don’t result in superstars is flat out wrong."
"Superteams were still fun to watch without completely decimating the balance of the league during the Heatles era. It was when KD joined the Warriors that superteams reached a whole nother level. Sure watching the rest of the league gather up some kind of star talent was entertaining (Duke Pelicans) and somewhat helped to forget the guaranteed champs down in Golden State.   But then the Boogie Cousins *really* took superteams out of control. A player who could very well be the leading All-Star on his teams took an astronomical paycut just to get a free ring. Why? Because Golden State was the first place in Nba history where all you had to do was stay healthy and follow Kerr’s plan to win a ring.   The Brooklyn Nets are similar. Harden leaves the Rockets cuz he’s no longer happy there. And he doesn’t leave to go be the leader on another team. No, he is ok with downgrading from the No. 1 option to the No. 3 option. Why? Cuz the Nets are a favorite to win the ring. Then what happens next? Not one, but *two* Boogie Cousins emerge: Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldrige. 2 guys who could very well still play at All-star level force their way out to join the Nets. Again, because it’s the easiest and most guaranteed way to win a ring.   What makes it worse is that the fans looked to LA to stop the bullshit brewing in Brooklyn, so the Lakers started doing the same. Getting Andre Drummond, another player that may have been a fringe All-star in Cleveland, just to compete with the Nets.   This offseason just made it worse. Now, not only are washed or old All-star level players joining these teams, even high quality role players and *young* guys are taking paycuts to join them.   The rate in which these 2 teams are signing talent is just baffling. Hopefully the NBA, like what they did with foul baiting, will stop this crap cuz it’s just getting laughable."
If you want to add to the list throw Blake Griffin in too  . Although Tbf he did play great d for a series against the Greek Freak
 Blake griffin and Chris Paul sent curry on a mission to destroy the franchise
Dude really pulled a Blake Griffin on the Heat
and harden! and blake griffin!
"Facts, trade him to the Nets for Blake Griffin and a second round pick."
"Funny enough, I was already doing an analysis on something related and I modeled some of the worst snubs of the last decade or so. Note, these are statistical snubs on fairly simple metrics (so no RAPTOR/EPM/DPM/LEBRON or older ones like PIPM/RAPM), so if a player missed a bunch of the early season, slumped early, or missed getting on because they just weren't recognized by either the fans or the coaches, that's not included.  * Jimmy Butler, 2021 (missed a chunk of games) * KAT, 2017 * Rudy Gobert, 2019 (mentioned by /u/NitroXYZ) * Bradley Beal, 2020 * Trae Young, 2021 (multiple mentions) * Damian Lillard, 2016 * Chris Paul, 2018 * Al Jefferson, 2014 (/u/jknuts1377) * Josh Smith, 2012 * Nikola Jokic, 2018 * Damian Lillard, 2017 (/u/AMos050) * DeAndre Jordan, 2015 * Clint Capela, 2019 * Blake Griffin, 2017 * Andre Drummond, 2019 * Stephen Curry, 2013 (/u/dmavs11 and /u/KareemWasTheGreatest)   Methodology is similar to dribbleanalytics' here https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bcdpls/oc_using_machine_learning_to_predict_the_2019_mvp/. One of the variables that isn't refined for this particular analysis is team winning percentage. End of season winning percentage was used (because it was already available for a different analysis) rather than record at the all-star break."
Millsap doing his best blake griffin impression
"Is Blake Griffin hurt, or are these games ""DNP - sucks?""  Hard to believe he'd be worse than Millsap and James Johnson if healthy.  (And Johnson hits a 3 just as I hit enter)"
Blake Griffin gonna be driving his Kia to the unemployment office.
"""they're not even playing blake griffin"" yeah wonder why"
Blake Griffin
KD and Blake Griffin
"If you ever hear any of our young players talk about him you 1000% understand why he's there. He is critical for our development of young players and in my opinion we have the best developmental staff in the league, top 3 bare minimum. He's taken Bam under his wing from day 1 and Bam would not be the player he is today without UD. Blake Griffin last year said that UD is the most respected player in the NBA and if you do any research about the players only bubble meeting he was just as big of a voice as Lebron."
Hard to beat **that** Blake Griffin
"Hmm... The top 5 guys were   1) Blake Griffin   2) Hasheem Thabeet   3) James Harden   4) Tyreke Evans   5) Ricky Rubio  I gotta think maybe he jumps to 3, but Blake was so electric as a prospect I don't see him losing that spot."
"The Blake Griffin trade holy shit man.   Traded away Tobias Harris, filler and a first round pick that became SGA for a guy that had 1 good season, and paid not to play his last 2 years.   Pistons were below .500, clearly needed to rebuild, and so they decided to mortgage their future to barely scrape for the 8th seed and then get railed by deer on live TV. Just soooooo useless, gotta be one of the worst trades of all time.   That trade also set up the Clippers to create a contender, since they got PG with SGA and trading away Blake’s max freed up cap to sign Kawhi"
"Blake Griffin for Tobias   Tobias a few weeks earlier said he loved Detroit and wanted to stay there for his career.  Then boom we traded him for a guy everyone knew was gonna have injury issues. I appreciate Blake being a professional here during his stay, even giving us his career year and career high in points, but damn it was a bad trade."
We're the 1st seed in the East and have started Blake Griffin who has been the arguably worst offensive player in the league for most of the year   I'd trade half of our rotation for Brunson or THJ any day
"Nope, blake Griffin was pulling a ben simmons focusing on his social status and cp3 called him out and questioned his want to win. You dont know what youre talkin bout. This is all documented. Blake Griffin will never make it to the finals unless hes on the bench getting carried."
"Wall and Blake Griffin are two of my huge injury bummers. Both of those guys were so damn athletic and fun to watch, amazing passers."
"thats why we cant really play blake griffin anymore, he isnt a great shooting threat and not a lob threat."
"EWING THEORY  no not the bill simmons one  i mean the draft, too much clear evidence. I really do think that draft was 100 percent rigged  Also the Griffin slam dunk contest, apparently there was a radio station/idk what it was, but in like their schedule, they put in blake griffin wins 2011 dunk contest prior to the contest even starting  [https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2011/3/7/2035475/nba-dunk-contest-was-totally-rigged-maybe](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2011/3/7/2035475/nba-dunk-contest-was-totally-rigged-maybe) \- the link, there is a pic showing that griffin is known to win the contest  it could EASILY BE A TYPO. but it's just really funny so I'll believe this bold take"
"That wasn’t really their thing while together in Toronto, but I see what you’re trying to do.   You’re probably better off using DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin even though they already have a name, “Lob City,” from their days with the Clippers."
Deandre Jordan and Blake Griffin  Lob City
"Reminded me of the one where Blake Griffin kinda threw it into the hoop one handed. Or that Bron poster on the entire Blazers team, dope dunk KP!"
" Joe harris has missed a lot of games, don’t act like Blake Griffin isn’t cooked,LMA hoopin but he’s old Af"
"Wild how a roster of KD, James Harden, Joe Harris, LaMarcus Aldridge, Blake Griffin, and Patty Mills being the 1 seed by one game over the Wizards is considered impressive this year lol"
Lebron got into it with Stewart who has an 8 minute highlight of his altercations in his second year and everyone pointed to lebron and solely  lebron. When Blake griffin liked a tweet alluding to Stewart being dirty people then attacked Blake. This sub picks and chooses when it applies it’s morals.
Yep. You'll also get Blake Griffin after Brooklyn cuts him.
Javale Mcgee rn is better than Blake Griffin and DJ... think about that
who knew Giannis was funnier than Blake Griffin
"Aldridge is 36 years old and looked all but cooked at times last year. Harden is recovering - badly - from a hamstring injury and rules changes that hamstring his impact offensively. Blake Griffin is still earning money. All the excuses for the Lakers should rightly be applied to the Nets as well, and yet they aren't struggling to the same degree. They aren't beating good teams either, but they're putting bad teams away."
"I mean, boogie and his intensity and skill always have a place in my heart. He could be like Blake Griffin,  best bench player on your team regular season and invaluable during playoffs."
"This is it. Athleticism isn't stamina training. Curry doesn't rely on out-freaking other freak athletes, which is what Blake Griffin relied on. Nothing against Griffin, but saying Curry relies on athleticism is kind of silly. There are old people that train to run and can run. That Curry can run is not because of his athleticism, it's because of his training."
This is Blake Griffin
meanwhile blake griffin from the same draft class is completely washed and lost his starting spot on the nets.  Only generational talent keep perfoming into their 30's
Blake Griffin was like this after him basically being out with the injury bug on and off since 2013
CP0 had DJ Blake Griffin Harden Booker and still blew all the leads along with being a dirty player
This is Blake Griffin-esque. I can hear Ralph's voice in my head.
That's more of a Blake Griffin thing.
Plenty have dropped off that quick. A combination of injuries &amp; age usually remove that half step you used to have.  LA Nash. Blake Griffin went from super star to nothing really quick.
I'm talking about how r/nba acted like we were the 17 Warriors 2.0 when we got Blake Griffin and Paul Millsap lmao
Blake Griffin is cool tho?
For old times' sake: FUCK BLAKE GRIFFIN!
"Perception means a lot. Daryl Morey banned nicknames for players from his draft room when they missed on Marc Gasol in draft. Everyone referred to him as ""man boobs"".   &gt;For instance, in the 2007 draft there had been a player his model really liked: Marc Gasol. Gasol was twenty-two years old, a seven-foot-one center playing in Europe. The scouts had found a photograph of him shirtless. He was pudgy and baby-faced and had these jiggly pecs. The Rockets staff had given Marc Gasol a nickname: Man Boobs. Man Boobs this and Man Boobs that. “That was my first draft in charge and I wasn’t so brave,” said Morey. He allowed the general ridicule of Marc Gasol’s body to drown out his model’s optimism about Gasol’s basketball future, and so instead of arguing with his staff, he watched the Mem­phis Grizzlies take Gasol with the 48th pick of the draft. The odds of getting an All-Star with the 48th pick in the draft were well below one in a hundred. The 48th pick of the draft basically never even yielded a useful NBA bench player, but already Marc Gasol was proving to be a giant exception. (Gasol became a two-time All-Star in 2012 and 2015 and, by Houston’s reckoning, the third-best pick made by the entire NBA over the past decade, after Kevin Durant and Blake Griffin.) The label they’d stuck on him clearly had affected how they valued him: names mattered. “I made a new rule right then,” said Morey. “I banned nicknames.”  http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2016/12/how_daryl_morey_used_behavioral_economics_to_revolutionize_the_art_of_nba.html"
Those are Blake Griffin numbers
"Jermaine O'Neal finished 2nd for MVP voting one year. Is he better than Pippen?  Other players who finished 3rd for MVP include Paul George, Blake Griffin, Penny Hardway, Grant Hill.  It's not exactly some unprecedented peak by Scottie."
"he pushes off on every drive, that gets you hacked/fouled. Shaq did it, got hacked way more. Giannis does it, gets hacked plenty. Blake griffin used to do it and got hacked all the time too. offensive players that initiated contact are already fouling.   i appreciate that you can see why some people call him soft, cheers."
"He has always been exactly this good, he just doesn’t have prime Chris Paul and prime Blake griffin pulling 4 defenders from the rim anymore."
"He relies a lot on his athletism. Which also helps that he was playing with the Point God and Blake Griffin, both definitely no slouches in playmaking. They could feed him so many passes to dunk on.  He has literally zero moves aside from dunking very hard, no range though I do commend him on getting his FT up since leaving the Clippers.  He did get a lot of rebounds, mostly because he's designated as the defensive rebounder (Blake also gave up his numbers so DJ can get his) and he can get a few offensive boards. He never boxes out and occasionally you see opposing guards swooping in to get a rebound while he's staring at the ball bouncing off the rim.  Defensively he wasn't that bad though he died chase for blocks especially early in his career. I do think his best years defensively was under Doc Rivers.  Prime DJ was definitely not a bad player. Given he was a second round pick, he definitely worked himself into the league as a rotation player, then a starter and into an all star. Though he basically sharply declined after leaving us."
"There is being bad, and there is ""yup will play short arm 6'8 washed Blake Griffin at center and be better"" bad"
Blake Griffin did all that
"Tell that to Luka, Blake Griffin, Giannis, Dwight Howard, etc.   He can’t even pull half the shit he’s done in his very short career in China which is where he’ll end up. Bush-league ass player"
"It is a flagrant foul because it is non basketball related and warrant an ejection.  But if you look at past history  not many of these fouls will get even a single game ejection.  Go look up the game where Stewart and Blake Griffin got into it.  Elbows are flying everywhere and half of them aren’t even called.  You can’t judge how bad injury is based purely on the amount of blood spilled.  They didn’t even go through the normal concussion protocol.  Had Stewart kept his cool and went to the trainer right away they could have stop the bleeding right away but he won’t accept medical help.   It was a dirty play and LeBron got a flagrant, ejection and one game suspension and based off precedents that is enough.  Stewart is not without blame, he can’t control his own emotion and was bulldozing over his own staff and teammates.  And don’t just look at that single play watch the whole game and you can see that he and LeBron were pretty physical with each other.  They were both throwing elbows at each other and LeBron had one that landed and did some damage."
Steph has no problem guarding LeBron outside of drives:  https://streamable.com/p2s3o  https://streamable.com/sascq  https://streamable.com/asm84y  https://streamable.com/oc8jni (help defense on LeBron)  https://streamable.com/1j5wp (Curry bullying Blake Griffin and ) CP3)  https://streamable.com/jdgjzd (you sure LeBron can guard anyone?)  This sub thinks its pseudo logic is effective to see how matchups turn out.
"Oooh aren’t you such a good guy  Obviously we watch sports differently. I watch to root for my team and I don’t fuck with any disrespect.   You must have forgotten that Clippers staffers were advised to not wear any team gear while walking around Memphis.   ZBO didn’t fuck with Blake Griffin, so neither did I.   Draymond Green poked Mike Conleys broken eye, fuck him for life for that.   This one doesn’t even have to do with my team but I’ll never forget it. Fuck Kelly Olynyk for pulling Kevin Loves shoulder out.   It’s ok to dislike players that do shitty things, ya know?"
The nets had nobody to physically match Giannis lol it was old ass Blake griffin
"Why because they traded Blake and CP3?  If history shows the Clippers made those trades ended up to trading Harris to take 2 steps backwards.  They then got Kawahi and PG13 to move forward.  They have also fallen short of their goals the past 2 years as well.    Also how did the trade of Blake work out for Detroit?  Let’s see they pushed all in to make the playoffs and got bounced in the first round.  They then needed to fire their coach, went into a complete rebuild and are paying Blake Griffin to play for the Nets.  That deal didn’t seem to work out for Detroit at all and trading Fox for a win now player would be a lot more of a similar situation Detroit was in than what the Clippers were in."
Blake Griffin dunk contest in 2011.
washed blake griffin did better guarding giannis than ayton lol
Blake Griffin sucks and the Nets were total morons for picking him up off wavers.
I think it says a lot that the corpse of Blake Griffin is an upgrade defensively over Jordan
"&gt; Would that call ever be made on Blake Griffin, or any other star player for that matter? Absolutely not.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiPbAEyzgqs"
Blake Griffin played in LA. I’m not even entirely sure Adam Silver knows the Timberwolves still exist.
"I am a Timberwolves fan so of course take it with a grain of salt. That’s fine. I’ve also watched just about every single game of LeBron’s career and hundreds, if not thousands, of other NBA games over the course of my life. So, again, I feel that I am pretty qualified to make that distinction. This really isn’t me about trying to get sympathy or other people to agree with me either, I just truly don’t think the Wolves are officiated like other teams. Would that call ever be made on Blake Griffin, or any other star player for that matter? Absolutely not. DeAndre Jordan nearly killed Brandon Knight and that wasn’t a foul. I can go down the list. I know you agreed that it wasn’t a foul but these types of BS calls or non calls happen to the Wolves almost every single game."
Blake Griffin was the king of free arming on all his dunks. Literally more than half of them were 100% offensive fouls that went uncalled.
Blake had a season he finished 3rd in the MVP and has made 5 All-NBA teams even with all his injury issues. Prime Blake Griffin is significantly better than Prime Derozan
"At the start of the pandemic when the Ringer was doing their redrafts, I was bored and did my own along with them. For the top 14 I think the redraft order is:  Steph Curry James Harden Blake Griffin Jrue Holiday DeMar DeRozan Ricky Rubio Danny Green Jeff Teague Patrick Beverley Taj Gibson Wes Matthews Patty Mills Darren Collison  Tyreke Evans of course has a good argument, but so much of his post rookie career was a let down. Also maybe Ingles goes ahead of Collison now that he retired early."
"Every time Blake Griffin dunked 10,000 Kia Fortes were released into the wild. I don’t see Anthony Edwards doing the same just yet"
If only Edwards was in a bigger market. Blake Griffin made a career out of punching dudes in the face during a poster dunk and never got called for it.
Blake griffin got away with it multiple times. Refs should have let this one slide too.
They let Blake Griffin spend years using his offhand to hold people down. How they not gonna let Ant murder a guy?
How are people ranking derozan over Blake griffin? Do they know how insane prime Blake griffin was?
I'd say it absolutely is to an extent. Tons of poster dunks are offensive fouls that get ignored. Blake Griffin used to regularly stiff arm people while going for dunks and it basically never got called. Star players regularly get away with pushing off while creating a midrange shot.
The games he has played I his stats are bad and he just looks out of place. The defense was not good and the offense was horrible. I say we stick with him coming off the bench with griffin and Milsap.  LA is just much better. Honestly so is Blake.
For real those are some of the worst examples he could have gave. Only ones worse may be the dunk on Paul Gasol. Blake Griffin is the king of offensive fouls.
1. Steph Curry 2. James Harden 3. DeMar DeRozan 4. Blake Griffin 5. Jrue Holiday 6. Danny Green 7. Jeff Teague 8. Ricky Rubio 9. Patty mills
Blake Griffin used to used to throw people out of the way with his off arm on dunks.
The Warriors have those players now not back when the Wiggins trade happened.   Also the Luxury Tax is like “Player Salary x 4” so that Wiggins contract turns into yearly $100m tax for just Wiggins really quickly compared to RoCo. Wiggins is a better player but RoCo at 1/2-1/3 of the price isn’t terrible.   It’s kinda similar to  Blake Griffin on the Nets. He looked terrible on the Pistons making $30m+ but he looks awesome for the Vet Min.   Also the Warriors got a Top 10 pick from Minny because of the salary difference so it kinda washes out to a point except for the insane Luxury Tax difference between the contracts of RoCo/Wiggins.
We have Blake Griffin now?
They didn’t call it when Blake Griffin used to do this all the time
Lol remember when Blake Griffin poured water on that fan
So much better than a Blake Griffin 'throw it in the basket'dunk.
"It's not illegitimate at all, but the Bucks without Jrue, Khris, Bobby Portis and Blake Griffin are NOT the same team... That is a team that a good team should beat, even if Giannis goes off."
"If that's an offensive foul, you need to retroactively take away like 5,000 points from Blake Griffin.  That is a softer whistle than any contested Blake dunk I've ever seen.  Sours one of the plays of the year, fuck off."
"Blake Griffin ""Cool Rule"" HOF"
"Blake griffin has done the same thing numerous times and never got called for it. That dunk was clean af and it sucks the refs took it away. Doesn't matter tho, it will live on."
Blake Griffin vibes
the blake griffin special
Blake Griffin esque
Blake Griffin being washed has caused Blake Griffin's scoring decline.
Blake Griffin
"Blake Griffin on the bench, do the Nets even WANT to win?"
"Well yeah, Blake Griffin was a beast at Oklahoma and then went on to be an all-nba type player for a long time until injuries sapped his ability."
Lma finally gets the start and he turns into blake griffin from the field
Blake Griffin should not see another minute again except when its garbage time and he can regain confidence in his shot.
"That's great! Really is! Unfortunately he's almost unplayable right now! Doesn't change the fact that outside of blake griffin, lma, and patty the roster has flaws right now missing a star player."
"Celtics beat reporter wrote this in the offseason  &gt; According to multiple team sources, there was some dysfunction in the locker room, with the relationship between Stevens and Walker characterized as tension-filled.

After watching this it seems like Blake Griffin started both fight and so did Lebron.....he did rip Dwights shorts.....the rest aren't even anything.
538 also has Derrick Rose and Blake Griffin as top 5 defenders in the league. Oubre has been a huge negative in on/off stats almost every season of his career of many different situations.
that derrick rose one over dragic and the Blake griffin one over whoever that is.. (literally almost murdered him). Stoudamire and Vince carter ones as well
"Doubt it...  20 y/o 'roid boy vs. 37 y/o w/ man strength.   Chickenhead Stewart tried to shove Bron but found out that he couldn't. Then he got back-fisted, bloodied, and embarrassed. Stewart wouldn't even fight Blake Griffin when he had a chance (just stand over him.) No evidence to suggest Stewart has anything on Bron but a temper tantrum."
Blake Griffin Deandre Jordan Nick Young Jeremy Lin  All funny or have cool personalities.
"Draymond, Blake Griffin, and Seth Curry."
Dead Blake Griffin lmfao 🤣
What about Ben Simmons and Jamal Murray? Blake Griffin? Chris Paul? There are a lot of guys making the max who clearly don't/didn't want to be traded.
"I don’t agree with the way Harden went out, but I also don’t have a problem with stars forcing their way out. If a team can trade someone like Blake Griffin the first year in their contract after showing him his jersey being raised in the rafters, then why can’t a star demand a trade 1 season into their contract? Really it’s the way that you force your way out, and pulling a Vince Carter is what’s wrong, not demanding a trade."
Hahahahaa that’s true. You all have enjoyed the best decade of basketball Clipper fans have gotten to see though. Blake Griffin and CP3 turned y’all into winners. Couldn’t get out of the second round but fun season basketball. Post season was heart breaking.
Dude we get it. You got to watch an unbeatable super team for half a decade so you can’t understand how players don’t win ship after ship but Russ is very clearly in the conversation of top 5 from the 2010’s. Curry has less all star appearances than Blake Griffin lmao his longevity stats are garbage compared to the other greats of the decade. Should we remove him from consideration from top 5 of the decade since he was really only great for 5 years? Clearly not so don’t reduce a player you dislike over bias
"he's not a top 15 player or a primary ball handler in the playoffs, but more like a Blake Griffin/ Draymond type and his performance should be judged as such.    I would still take that over Kyrie who actually doesn't show up to basketball games. And I think Ben helps winning more than Kyrie, look at Boston without Kyrie and  look at how clueless  Sixers have  looked in playoffs last year."
He broke down in one playoff series with the Clippers and that was a freak accident. Blake Griffin is the one who was breaking down.
"Joe Johnson, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, Jamal Crawford, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul George, Rajon Rondo, Joakim Noah, Kyle Lowry, Tyson Chandler, DeAndre Jordan, Derrick Rose, Draymond Green"
"You're saying the Rockets didn't like the package of Sekou Deyoumba, injured Killian Hayes, and dead Blake Griffin? Although if the Pistons were dumb enough they could have had a relatively attractive collection of picks"
"It really is astounding to me that you think you’re some three dimensional chess god while Danny Ainge has no idea what he’s doing. If you were the Celtics GM, you would’ve traded Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, and multiple firsts for Blake Griffin or Jimmy Butler years ago and the team would currently be at the bottom of the league with no draft capital. It’s hard to get to the finals. It really is. Not only has Ainge shown he can consistently get to the conference finals, he’s shown he can do it with purely homegrown talent. That’s no small feat. He’s got a huge trade exception to work with this off-season and the future looks bright. Ainge is 20 times the GM the Lakers have ever had and isn’t going anywhere anytime soon"
"I don't watch enough Pistons because, ya know, I don't hate myself that much, but I watch a lot of Denver so I know what he looked like last year.   Point is, he was a talented young player who was a quality role player.  He was capable to step into a slightly larger role.  Instead, he now has the most shots on a team (and as bad as the Pistons are in general, they still have Blake Griffin whose playing as far as I'm aware).  I'm not saying Grant is the most improved player, I'm just saying his numbers are the most improved, even if it's all situation."
"Nba players and especially explosive big men peak young.  Amare, Shawn Kemp, Blake Griffin and Dwight Howard all peaked in their early to mid-twenties.  The average NBA [player peaks around 25 -27 anyway] (https://www.google.com/search?q=nba+aging+curve&amp;rlz=1C1ZCEB_enUS844US844&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=iu&amp;ictx=1&amp;fir=UYVHseMgW8Kv1M%252CjGPXmf38DGarYM%252C_&amp;vet=1&amp;usg=AI4_-kRnOMpfp27ZP4pdxMmIkIZkDA-zhA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj-iuuX2pvuAhUXFlkFHfrQBPIQ9QF6BAgOEAE&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=598#imgrc=UYVHseMgW8Kv1M), we tend to overvalue experience and undervalue youth."
Since Blake Griffin got drafted
Blake Griffin
Ooooh trade Eric Gordon for Blake Griffin and Derrick Rose   Sick squad
Blake Griffin used to be one of my favorite players to watch and it is just... tragic... how far he’s fallen in just 2 seasons.
"Forget the dunk, why the hell did Blake Griffin bite on a Giannis pump fake"
A 100 million dollar fine to Blake Griffin for jumping into a fucking Giannis pump fake  three  Take away his entire contract
Okay fine.  Blake griffin then?
"&gt; This is most blatant in the NFL when #1 drafts consistently get dropped into the worst team in the league (it being the worst team for a reason), then cannot develop and then get railroaded out of the league.  I think that's more that those guys just suck. NFL #1 picks are more likely to become all-stars than NBA #1 picks.   NFL #1 pick all-stars since 2000:   - All-stars (15): Kyler Murray, Myles Garrett, Jared Goff, Jameis Winston, Jadaveon Clowney, Eric Fisher, Andrew Luck, Cam Newton, Matt Stafford, Jake Long, Mario Williams, Alex Smith, Eli Manning, Carson Palmer, Mike Vick  - Non-all-stars (6): Joe Burrow, Baker Mayfield, Sam Bradford, Jamarcus Russell, David Carr, Courtney Brown  NBA #1 overall picks since 2000:   - All-stars (12): Ben Simmons, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, Lebron James, Yao Ming, Kenyon Martin  - Non-all-stars (9): Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, Deandre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Kwame Brown  Zion seems like a pretty sure bet to become an all-star in the future, but I could say the same for Burrow.   &gt; That's why the best NFL quarterbacks nowadays are mid-round picks and late round picks  Only 2 of them: Wilson and Brady. 4 if you wanna include ""good not great"" QBs like Kirk Cousins and Dak Prescott.   Meanwhile the 1st round QBs include: Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers, Deshaun Watson, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Phillip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Matt Ryan, Ryan Tannehill, Justin Herbert. That's already 10, not including any who were listed above as #1 overall picks.   Then you also have Drew Brees and Derek Carr as early 2nd rounders (ie, not midround picks)."
DeAndre Jordan has as much a chance of a career revival as Blake Griffin does.
Rockets need Blake Griffin to complete the hospital squad
Blake Griffin looks done if you ask me. Would just be trading someone who is not at it mentally to someone who's not at it physically.
I remember Reports saying Kyrie didn’t want the Nets to Trade for Harden..who would you want to see them trade Kyrie for if it were to happen?? Maybe Andre Drummond? Blake Griffin? I don’t see them getting another superstar for Kyrie
Not hard to go Full Kyrie.   Just stay home.   Blake Griffin could go full Kyrie and he’s playing on one leg!
They’re gonna need blake griffin to develop into the star he’s supposed to be.
Blake Griffin. He will fit perfectly with the knicks ethos.
I'm more of a spurs fan than anything else but I always thought a harden trade to Detroit would be interesting. I just figured they give up blake griffin and Jeremy Grant and maybe a pick for harden and both teams still make the playoffs this year...
"Take Kyrie and every pick the Nets have. Kyrie retires, saving the Rockets millions upon millions in cap. Now you got cap room and a horde of picks along with a pretty good supporting cast of Wall, Gordon, PJ Tucker, Wood, Nwaba and Boogie. You got the ammo to trade up for Cade Cunningham (or whoever tf they want), and the cap space to sign a someone like Oladipo, Millsap, Blake Griffin etc."
"Learn how to write maybe? You said I tried to tell you how you viewed AD, when you literally told us you thought he was top 3-5. You also said stop going off of what other people thought of AD, and then a comment later youre trying to act like you’re *opinion* right because of what Ben Taylor said.   &gt;	You act like no one in the world had this opinion. I’m showing you reputable ppl did.  Ahh maybe you should learn to read. I said the majority opinion was that he wasn’t a top 3-5 player at the timelike you said, and the minority was the group that you shared similar views with.   &gt;	You dodged my question about did lebron have the best pf  What is being best PF going into the league supposed to represent? You could be best PF or C in the league, but still not be a top 3-5 player. Unless you’re suggesting that Love was a top 3-5 player in 2015? Besides, Blake Griffin was definitely in the argument.    Also, you still have not provided who else was in your top 5 besides AD lol I wonder why you’re avoiding it."
We’ve yet to say that kind of improvement so far though. And look at a player like Blake Griffin. It took him three to four years to develop a respectable jumper. Or Giannis who has yet to find one of his own.
A better fit doesnt necessarily mean a positive asset. Kevin Love or Blake Griffin could fit much better on this Rockets team.
"No he wasn’t, he was only gonna be a starter because he was the highest paid player and seniority. Lee lost his jumper at this point which means he couldn’t have a lane into the basket, his rebounding numbers were down, he couldn’t defend anybody not named Blake Griffin. While Draymond made Curry look like a MVP player.  We were arguing on r/Warriors on who should start. Draymond was gonna start over Lee real fast regardless of injury, the org put out this narrative to make Lee look better as a bench player."
"No way. There are only about half a dozen active players who would be 1st ballot if they retired today, and Kyrie is definitely not one of them. Bron, KD, Steph, Harden, CP3, Melo, Russ, and Dwight. I think that's it.  Lowry might have an outside shot at 1st ballot if he retired today, but I wouldn't bet on it. AD, Kawhi, and probably Giannis have a good chance to be 1st ballot by the time they retire, but if they stepped down today, I don't know that they would be. PG3 is potentially in that boat too, especially if either of their teams win the finals within the next year or two. Dame has a small chance at 1st ballot if he ever wins a ring, and/or if he breaks some shooting records and racks up some more All-NBAs before he retires, but for now, he's probably in similar company to Kyrie.  Kyrie will need at least one more ring to have a shot at 1st ballot, and even then, I'm not sure he gets it. Especially after all this drama. Unless maybe it comes with an FMVP and/or 1st team All NBA, or he gets a third ring as well. For now, he's more in the company of guys like Love, Rondo, Klay, and Blake Griffin. Good players, got some accolades, but definitely not in the pinnacle tier."
Sounds like Andrew Bogut doesn’t like Mark Jackson! Jackson was probably hard to deal with but damn before he got there the warriors never had a true winning culture.   That’s the furthest from the truth. I remember Draymond playing big minutes against the clippers and giving Blake Griffin all sort of problems. How would he have been out the league? Mark Jackson developed those players.  Then Steve Kerr inherited the roster. I really haven’t seen any player truly developed under Steve Kerr. Every pick they’ve made has turned to trash under Kerr. We will see what Wiseman or Wiggins becomes. People acting like Steve Kerr is a great coach... Luke Walton went 12-0 with that roster.
He played as rhe 4 for most of that season and was guarding Blake Griffin in the playoffs. Him being a 4 was not a new idea
"omg I forgot about him. Thought he had loads of potential too. Really liked him, shame most people only know him from current Piston Blake Griffin baptizing him"
"That's because they get traded away once their huge contracts start coinciding with their twilight years (see John Wall, Dwyane Wade, Blake Griffin)"
That crossover made Blake Griffin look like Curry.
How's Blake Griffin working out?
His stats are due to hustle and being fed by a playmaker I think. Going Blake Griffin-esque
I think he just needs a playmaker to deliver him the ball to score well. Like going Blake Griffin
"I did the research and you are the one with questions. I have the answers. What are yours?   Did Blake Griffin or Anthony Davis fill in for a starter? That would be my first question to you.  edit: Demar DeRozen and Kyle Lowry deserved it more, too."
Understood. I was prepared for a response like this.   How would you defend the fact that the following players deserved it more than Goran:   * Blake Griffin * D.J. Augustin * Isaiah Thomas * DeAndre Jordan * Lance Stephenson * Anthony Davis * Gerald Green   This isn't a post about Reggie. It is about the fucked up nature of the MIP award and specifically the 2013/14 season.
You mean Blake Griffin not CP3. They were laughing at Blake calling the cops bc CP3 led Houston down the secret tunnel.
"You can believe that if you want but I have always been of the opinion that the Cavs won in spite of Kyrie. Too many people just look at raw numbers without factoring in intangibles that aren't quantified, whether it be team chemistry, mental make-up, etc. You can have all the talent in the world but still completely squander it. Being a good teammate is worth more than things like scoring 5 points more than someone else IMO.   I mean, even in that season, I would have ranked the following better than him:  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Anthony Davis 6. Damian Lillard 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Klay Thompson 9. Russell Westbrook 10. James Harden 11. John Wall 12. Chris Paul 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kyle Lowry 15. Paul George 16. Gordon Hayward 17. Blake Griffin 18. Mike Conley  So that leaves two spots remaining with Kyrie in the mix with guys like DeMar Derozen, DeMarcus Cousins, LaMarcus Aldridge, Karl-Anthony Towns, Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum, Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, etc. There are a bunch of names within the remaining players that I'd rather have on my team than Kyrie even in that season"
[**Blake Griffin &amp; 'Dr Drain' - Jordan Superfly 2**](https://streamable.com/uoxieo)  Backstory: An homage to Spike Lee's '[Mars Blackman](https://streamable.com/1o4jyj)' from some original Jordan ads. I believe this was the first commercial Blake Griffin took part in as a Jordan-brand athlete.
There were also rumors around like 2016 the Clippers inquired about a Paul George for Blake Griffin swap
"It’s great that he’s living up to the contract, but I remember when Blake Griffin balled out in Detroit and everyone shat on r/nba for saying it was a bad trade. This is a huge 3 year deal, I hope he does well, but with his injury history it seems like it will be hard for him to live up to his contract."
Blake Griffin.
Blake Griffin
"Especially the ""he was so big he *had* to stay out of shape b/c getting in shape would have injured him"" crowd.  When he first came into the league he wasn't dramatically bigger than Ewing or Mourning, for example.  If he stayed at that size - or gone back to it - his decline from ""past his prime but still good"" to ""slow oaf who looks like he's made of concrete"" would have gone a lot slower.  Remember how Duncan looked washed up in 2011 against the Grizzlies when Zack Randolph pretty much had his way with him and then he lost like 25 lbs combined over the next two offseasons and looked like a better player at age 39 than he'd been at age 35? And inded up holding his own against DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin in 2015?  Or how Malone and Barkley were basically each about as good as the other in the early-mid 90s and then Barkley turned into a spare much quicker while Malone was still a high-quality post defender at age 40? Because Malone took his conditioning seriously and Barkley didn't.  Compared to Malone, Barkley was out of shape. Obviously he's not out of shape for a rec league, but he wasn't getting paid to play in a rec league."
Nah. If I'm ranking the #1 picks from the past 20 years Blake Griffin would easily be in the top half. Being picked ahead of some guys who ended up being better than him doesn't make Griffin himself an underachiever.
Another way to look at it for the crowd that doesn’t like being honest about guys being busts is Wiggins is a big reason Minnesota is still a mess. Two no 1 picks in a row is a massive boon for a rebuilding franchise. Median level no 1 pick past 25 years is a Blake Griffin caliber player. Wiggins falling so short is a big part of why Minnesota has only had one season worth a damn since 2014/15 and that was with Jimmy Butler

"Man, Blake Griffin isn’t looking so good :,("
Kinda weird saying this    But Blake Griffin might be the least athletic piston
"r/nba and /r/rockets are big time haters and wood is a journey man that got minutes when blake griffin was injured with the pistons last year, so they gave him a lot of touches, which inflated his stats, he is a role player."
Blake griffin? Why dont you go compare his rookie year to doncic.  There's a lot of good rookies.  Griffins rookie year was definitely not worthy of an all star.  He just made super highlight dunks.  It was exciting.
"i remember him dropping [50](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25066966/blake-griffin-grateful-silence-critics-50-point-career-night-vs-sixers) on my team with straight ease like it was yesterday, and now, he's a brachiosaurus. looked like an mvp that year."
"Jerami Grant as the number option works as well as anyone could've hoped.  The fact that Blake Griffin looks like a zombie and that the rest of the roster is horrible is why the team is losing.  Not that I think Grant is that great, and yeah he's not a first option on a good team, but the Pistons losing is like 0% on him, especially because even defensively he's clearly one of the 2/3 best defenders on the team and guards a lot of tough assignements.  20+ PPG on average efficiency + good defense is nothing to sneeze at"
"Is the offense bad because Jerami Grant is our leading scorer, or is the offense bad because our other offensive options are Blake Griffin who can't move and rookies ?  It's not to say Jerami Grant SHOULD be the first option on a good team, just that our offense being awful has way more to do with basically everybody else sucking"
"I've said it a few times, but if Blake Griffin wasn't sucking hardcore or at least playing a bit closer to his 18/19 peak, the pistons would have maybe 1 or 2 losses. He's that much of a negative player right now.  The only game we had no chance of winning was against the Bucks, and that was a 15 point loss. everything else has been competitive till the very end.   I'm happy to have Tank Commander Grant showing off."
I really think of Blake Griffin as more of a commercial actor than a basketball player at this point. I keep forgetting he’s on the floor.
Blake is 31 too.. are you secretly Blake Griffin?
You like Blake Griffin hey? Pistons it is!
"Shooting is the hardest imo - if you have the touch then you usually can already shoot by the time you get to the NBA. You can improve a non-shooter into an inconsistent shooter (low 30s % from 3) but it is exceedingly rare for a non or bad shooter to become a good shooter (high 30s to 40s% from 3).  By contrast I'd say the easiest is playmaking, which funnily enough is also often mentioned in this thread as a possible hardest. IMO there have been a ton of players that have *developed* decent to great playmaking skills:  * Paul George * Kawhi Leonard * Devin Booker * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Russell Westbrook * James Harden * DeMar DeRozan * Nikola Vucevic * Kevin Love * Anthony Davis * Jimmy Butler * Kevin Durant * Karl-Anthony Towns * Blake Griffin  The list goes on and on, and what is common between these guys (with the exception of Bam) is that as their offensive responsibility increased scoring wise, they also had to develop playmaking as the next step of their evolution.   Stars in the NBA generally follow a similar path:  1. Good scorer 2. Better scorer because you learn how to get free throws 3. Better playmaker because that is the responsbility that comes with having the ball so much 4. Better defender"
Apparently Blake Griffin.
"Blake Griffin, now Westbrook 😞"
He would get posterised by Blake Griffin
Don’t forget other comparisons from that draft lol.   Joel Embiid was next Olajuwon and Aaron Gordon was the next Blake Griffin.   One of the more overhyped draft classes haha
"JE Skeet’s said the same thing, basically saying that he’s overrated in terms of highlights. We were promised prime Blake Griffin -type highlights right away but all of his memorable moments are all non-dunks (ripping the ball in summer league, hitting 4 threes, getting that one block)"

"It's funny, because they traded for almost every one of the guys you just listed.  Lou: CP3 trade  Jackson: Was waived and not many other teams were showing interest.   Kennard: Shamet and draft compensation. Shamet was from the Tobias trade and they got Tobias from Blake Griffin who they drafted and extended  Morris: Harkless (who doesn't get many minutes at this point in his career) and draft compensation. They also signed him to an extension that I think only a handful of teams would be willing to give to him  Zubac: Traded for Mike Muscala who they got from the Sixers in the Tobias trade from once again Blake Griffin."
"With Bron and AD - Lakers lose... without them, they win...   Time to package them up and trade for Blake Griffin and an air fryer"
Do you think the shell of Blake Griffin will decided to exercise his $39 mil players option next year?   Maybe he can get more as a free agent!
"The issue with his contact isn't how he's playing now, it's how he plays in years 3 and 4. Blake Griffin was fantastic for us and easily worth the money for his first two years, now he's one of the worst contracts in the league"
"I still remember the days when John was playing with Swaggy P, Andray the Filipino legend Blatche, and Javale  I also remember drafting the European Blake griffin Jan Vesely.  So no"
So does Blake Griffin but hes likely toast.
he's literally like blake griffin
Andre Drummond for Blake Griffin
They're still more moveable than a past his prime Blake Griffin.
Will any team trade for Blake Griffin is the real question
If blake griffin didn't play like a geriatric the pistons would probably have 5 wins. Its shocking how much he limits them as a team on and off the court.
so blake griffin regressed a ton but he just gets a pass cause he didn't play much last season?
blake griffin
Zero chance anyone would have a trade involving Levert and Blake griffin and Derrick rose
I'd like to see a Kevin Love for Blake Griffin swap. Not sure if it helps either team but just to shake things up.
Sad. 2018 Blake Griffin was the best thing about Pistons basketball the last 12 years and there isn’t a second place. Athletically he’s washed and he doesn’t seem interested in putting an effort in the paint for a tanking team.
Better than blake griffin rn lmfao
"Blake added so much to his game since he first came in the League, it's a shame that injuries took away from that.  Doesn't seem like Detroit will be able to get much value for him at this point, that contract is just too big and there's no team that's a Blake Griffin away from contending."
"Playoffs, something you’re not familiar with. Probably for a long time lol. I’m sure watching the corpse of Blake Griffin and D Rose is fun tho!"

"Let’s face it. In a year’s time, people gonna look at this contract and it’s effects on the available roster moves and assess it for what it really means: “how many games did Rudy Gobert win for the Jazz, and did his contract bring the org closer to its goals?” So far, regardless of his “unquantifiable” impact, he’s letting opposing bigs have big numbers and his team has lost both of those games. He should get clowned. He’ll face worse when he gets Blake Griffin status in a year or two."
"WTF is Blake Griffin doing there shaking hands, go get your rookie's back."
Ask Blake Griffin how his 30s are treating him
Holy shit the second shot is literally the Blake Griffin impression.
Pistons beat the defending champs with Blake Griffin leading in points and assists like it’s 2018.
"Excuse me Blake Griffin, *but what the fuck?.*"
The demise of Blake Griffin was greatly exaggerated.
Blake Griffin is having an outer body experience
Blake Griffin to the Moon!!!!
Blake Griffin is making $36M and will make $38M next year. He signed a $171M contact.. holy fuck
"* Blake Griffin: 2 years, $75.6M * Russell Westbrook: 3 years, $132.9M * John Wall: 3 years, $132.6M * Kevin Love: 3 years, $91.5M  I'd rather have Blake's contract than Westbrook, Wall, or Love. None of them are helping you win but at least Blake comes off the books 1 year earlier. If you're bad, you might as well be bad and get a good draft pick.  Also, I really really hope not, but Klay Thompson's 5 year, $190M definitely has the potential to be the worst contract in the league..."
Blake griffin
I can't see Mozgov without thinking of Blake Griffin. Anyone else like this?
"Blake Griffin, now that he doesn't score much, would be a shoe-in for this list if he could develop some non-scoring skills."
Fuck Blake Griffin.
"It was a slight push. But I'm of the opinion that this is overblown. It happens on dunks all the time when the defender doesn't go up for the contest, they just throw their arms out as a reaction. I know I've seen it happen to Blake Griffin back in the day when he could actually dunk. Giannis did it to him one time. But he didn't fall like this, so no one bats an eye. The reason this one ended up so bad is bc you got Gasol coming from behind and his momentum is pushing Embiid's lower half forward while Lebron's push was sending his upper half back. If you wanna give Lebron a flagrant here, then there's probably a play every game where a defender does this, it just doesn't end up with the offensive player on their back."
Washed? Nah  Past his prime? Sure.  Washed is a guy like Blake Griffin.
"Idk, there was that time Blake Griffin stepped over Giannis and Middleton looked ready to throw down."
I’m pretty sure Wizards would want a ton of picks or young talent. Not a washed up Blake griffin and Tim hardaway lmao they’d be rebuilding
"I’d be sad to see him go but in a good package for really good talent I can see it. We need a really good SF to move Hunter to the 4 spot, but those are definitely not easy to trade for. An ideal goal would be Brown, BI, Middleton or MPJ but at the same time, why would any of those teams trade those guys away? that’s why we’re at an impasse with his trade Status. The most realistic one I can think of brings us Grant and Svi/Sekou for Collins and Picks, but at the same time, do I honestly expect a rebuilding team like the pistons to give us anything close to that especially when they already have Blake Griffin (even tho JC is better, that’s a logjam at PF) JC is undervalued and the only teams I can think that would want him are the Spurs or Warriors but I know for certain I don’t care about the players on those teams."
"Great game for Sexton, he was lights out. Also, not that it's relevant but I never really processed that the Pistons can almost run a lineup of just top 5 picks when healthy between Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin, Josh Jackson, and Jahlil Okafor."
blake griffin
"Man is locker for All NBA Washed 1st Team this season, together with Blake Griffin"
"This happens all the time, just players usually don't average a triple double before.   It's the same as Dwight Howard and more- this is what happens when somebody's game is based purely on athletics and not finesse/technique.   Everybody knew when his explosiveness was gone he would have almost nothing. His shooting has always been horrendous.   The only reason why guys like Blake Griffin and Derrick Rose are still around is because they worked on their shooting and developed their overall game. Westbrook hasn't done that and will probably be out of the league within a couple years"
"I mean, washed implies that he had a heavy decline. I think what op is saying is that he wasn’t a winner at any point. Yea he got worse but he didn’t have a Blake griffin level decline. Rather, he lost a bit of efficiency and is no longer putting up ridiculous box score stats that make people forgot he doesn’t actual help his teams efficiency or point differential"

"This thread is about Russell Westbrook, not Blake Griffin."
we all know how injuries have derailed some very talented people.  let's hope he can stay healthy or maybe his career arc will follow someone like blake Griffin if he gets hurt
Blake Griffin has entered the chat
"I never said he was declining in the same vein as Blake though?  In fact, I literally say:  "" **I get that players get old and aren't as effective as they once were. You see it now with guys like Westbrook, Lowry, Redick, Melo, etc. But the drastic and sharp decline in Griffin** where people consider him untradeable, to not even two full seasons ago when he was an All-Star, is just astonishing"""
"The Lakers' title window was likely closed, but Magic wasn't individually washed by any means. He averaged 19/8/12 in the Finals.  The main factor in the window closing was James Worthy's health. He had an ankle injury in 91, then knee surgery in 92 and missed the playoffs. He was never the same afterwards. Without his quickness in slashing to the rim or spinning around post defenders, he was largely reduced to being a mediocre jumpshooter - similar to Blake Griffin. He played in constant pain for a couple years before retiring.  Though there's a solid chance that a 93 Lakers team with Magic doesn't blow a 2-0 lead (best of 5) vs PHX in the 1st round. But they definitely don't get past SEA, even if they get past SA."
This pistons would be a lot more fun to watch if they would just stop giving minutes to Mason Plumlee and Blake Griffin.
"The pistons are not trying to win, but they were very clearly avoiding the obvious looking tank. They signed a couple of young projects for cheap, and a handful of guys who are likely going to have some value to teams once the deadline comes. every game but 1 has been within 10 pts, with 3 of them going to OT.  All of their trading gave them 3 first round picks this year. One is injured but should be back at some point (hopefully he isn't starting again), and the other 2 are playing notably decently well already.   So Detroit is executing the best tank this season. They have the fewest wins, but arguably are the ""best"" of the worst. Once Blake Griffin is off the books, thats when the real upward mobility starts."
"Well yeah, obviously I'd overstate that. OP clearly hasn't watched basketball in the past 5 years, or else he'd understand why Cleveland fans don't hate Kevin Love sitting there absorbing 25% of their salary cap to not be his former all-star self. You gotta rub it in a bit for them to truly understand it.      It's different from say a Blake Griffin contract(former star who never brought his teams any glory) or an Andrew Wiggins contract(overpaid role player), he did the work and this is the organization's way of saying thank you for the championship. Tryna make KLove fans feel guilty or some shit."
"Cuz the NBA is supposedly one of the most popular, fastest growing sports in the world. Even on those two crappy teams you have Blake Griffin, D Rose, Westbrook, and Beal as 'stars'. And some guys growing into their own (Grant, Avdija, Bey, Plumlee, Hachimura, etc.)"
He did us no favors with that Blake Griffin situation. At least we have a Tank Commander that sells a lot of T-Shirts.
"Disagree, Id reserve the hall of very good for guys like LaMarcus Aldridge, Shawn Kemp, Tim Hardaway, Blake Griffin, etc. Multiple time all stars who could lead their team to a playoff run"
Blake Griffin and I have the same amount of dunks this season

and blake griffin broke his hand punching a team employee
Nets can have Blake Griffin for an old soda machine that doesnt even have to work
There’s a little more to the story than griffin just punched the guy. Griffin and the equipment manager were friends and out for dinner and the equipment manager was teasing Blake so Blake punched him.
"Give me your tears, Blake Griffin"
&gt;Insert Eric Reid comment about how washed up Blake Griffin is
"He has fast hands, 6’11 wingspan, low center of gravity, and is like 235 lbs minimum (that 220 is from his 2009 combine LOL)   Dude is a fucking tank. I remember back when Blake was in his athletic prime, the Clips were in town and they give it to Griffin and he literally could not back down Harden... and this is when James was leaner than he is right now lmao"
"Trying to imagine if they replaced him with Blake Griffin, who can do standup reasonably well... doesn't matter, it would be terrible."
Wow blake griffin really That bad now? As u can imagine I never watch pistons games
I can offer you a slightly used Blake Griffin
"No it’s a team sport, the only player single Handedly ruining a team is Blake Griffin. Kyrie is really good but he was missing a lot when it counted"
Feel like I'm revisiting Blake Griffin threads from 2010
"It's happening to Blake Griffin at this very moment. He's basically gone though Lebron's entire career progression, but starting later and finishing earlier."
"Blake Griffin did similar training years back. I remember the exact same type of stat, something like Griffin could lower his heart rate from its peak down to resting rate in 60 seconds or something like that."
"Prime Blake Griffin. Handles more than good enough to create his shot from the outside, and well...prime Blake Griffin for dunks on the inside. A dunk and 3 point champion at the same time, he’d be the face of the league over Lebron, who already has a GOAT case."
I recall Blake Griffin talking about similar training 5-6 years ago. The ability to get to a resting heat rate quickly after short bursts of intense cardio.
his ceiling is stupid high. i know he’s young still but i just hope this isn’t the final version and that he keeps adding to his game the way lebron or even blake griffin did.
"This is just poor announcing, do they not see how he is struggling to walk. I am not even a fan of Blake Griffin but give the guy a break.  The real question is why is he still in the game?"
aldridge really trying to be more washed than blake griffin jesus
Blake griffin (pistons fan btw)
"Hey, it could also be Blake Griffin. Maybe Kevin Love? The possibilities are endless."
I saw one of these when they were talking about how good our FO did turning cp3 and Blake griffin into kawhi and PG.   that was on espn and that one didn’t even make sense. This poor redditor didn’t even have a chance.
"Pistons choked so hard. Horrible shot selection in the last 3 mins and overtime. This teams half court offense consists of errant Jeremi Grant shots, Blake griffin attempting to post someone up and flailing, and Derrick rose trying to be Derrick rose of 2010 and failing horribly. Add in mason plumlee being a complete bonehead and these are your 2021 pistons. Sad."
Anyone else get really sad just seeing Blake griffin just lose the ball like that? He just looks so unathletic in his old age...
Blake Griffin is dead.
BLAKE GRIFFIN HEARD ERIC REID TALKING SHIT
"“I’ve never seen someone watch so much stand-up comedy, except maybe Blake Griffin”"
"That and i think his body is going to break down bad if he doesn’t. Look at Blake Griffin, dude can’t even run now. And Zion weighs more than Griffin. If he didn’t get in shape, i see knee and hip issues with him he still Penguin walks, and even when he stands he has increased lordosis of his spine, idk if he has tight hip flexors or what."
"I think it’s three things.  First, he has a terrible body for defense. Average length on subpar height is a terrible combination. It’s kind of like the inverse of Blake Griffin. Subpar length on average height equals bad defense too.    Second, it’s much easier to dictate than react when you’re that big. Shaq was a great example of this. Dude was so quick and so agile offensively, but awful defending in space. Imagine chasing someone in a van vs being chased in a van. It’s much easier to take a sharp turn because you can take optimum angles, etc.  Third, poor awareness. Zion missed a ton of basketball and is still getting by on taking advantage of opportunities that less explosive players would miss because they’re either too slow to get to the spot or not strong enough to not get bumped off their path."
Josh Richardson of the Mavericks is an Oklahoma guy and so is Shake Milton of the Sixers. Josh might give Blake griffin a run for his money on the “Active” section for Oklahoma. I guess if it’s all seasons considered I’d still pick Blake but in recent years I’d argue for Josh
"I totally buy that Ingram is serious about improving and that JJ's praise is legit, honestly think he'll be a perennial all-star.  That being said I gotta point out that as long as JJ has been around, he hasn't really played with guys particularly known for their hardcore commitment or study of the game. In his career the other stars he played with were Dwight, Blake Griffin and a young Joel Embiid/Ben Simmons, so when he says Ingram watches more film than any of his non-Chris Paul teammates it *might* not be such a big deal."
"Granted he lost all the athleticism that made him special through injury, but Blake griffin is a decent comp as a guy who came in as a freak athlete #1 pick, and was immediately a highlight reel 20 point scorer, but was able to develop the rest of his game over time. Shame he can barely walk up the court now tho"
Ya let’s have Zion looking like current day Blake Griffin in three years.
"The players know these are guaranteed NBA contracts, not team contracts.   If team wants to pull a Blake Griffin, they can also pull a AD/Harden if they won't get it done."
Fair enough. When I watch them I just dont see BI and Zion as as impactful as their counting stats. Both play bad defence and Zion is more of a pre 2021 randle than a Blake Griffin in that he gobbles up the free shit but his athleticism isnt fully maximized yet.
Pistons got Derrick rose and Blake griffin 😔
It might be safer to say your team sucks when you *think* Blake Griffin is a top 5 franchise player.
"From '03 to '07, no player in the league had more combined points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks than Chief Beef. I'm not sure BlakeShake has even a remote idea of what defense ever was. Bold take - only team Blake Griffin would be a top 20 franchise player for is the Magic. Blake may be the most overrated player in modern history."
"I never watch Pistons games because I don't hate myself, but when I check the box score I cant believe Blake Griffin is always posting a quadruple single with the majority of his attempts from 3..."
Oh man I thought I was still in the Blake Griffin thread and was super confused at the idea of Blake being a mobile Dirk at this point. Good thing I kept reading lol
"I'm sorry but that announcer is fucking embarrassingly wrong.   ""his game hasn't grown since he's come into the league.""  Really? Is that a fucking joke? In a game where former lob city king Blake Griffin is pulling up 3's, this fuckwad says his game hasn't grown?"
"I remember looking at ESPN player rankings a number of years back and seeing AD and Blake Griffin both in their top 5. I was shocked, I didn't even know much about AD until then."
"I remember that. DeRozan yams it on Tolliver for the and-one to put us up two, then the Pistons call a timeout with like 5 seconds left. They just give it to Blake who finds the time to post someone up and tie the game like it’s nothing. Raps won in OT but I remember being annoyed at Griffin for not allowing DeRozan’s dunk to be the game winner"
"&gt; Look at Blake Griffin now. He's 31 and a shadow of his former self, hasn't dunked once this season.  This sounded like hyperbole but damn you are correct. Not a single dunk this season from Blake Griffin."
Blake Griffin is a 120%-version of Josh Smith. Like 20% better in almost everything to Smith but that's not enough to be a leader in a competing team.
Blake griffin pistons
Dont call Blake Griffin a ham sandwhich
"&gt; dude was all about dunking but I rarely saw him post anyone up.  He had an effective post game. It wasn't pretty like Hakeem or anything, but it worked. It was pretty reliant on explosiveness though, even for non-dunks. Spin moves and drop steps don't work if you're slow, and jump hooks don't work without the ""jump"" part.   The whole ""he only dunks"" thing was from people who just watched Sportscenter instead of games.   [Blake Griffin: All I Do Is Dunk, Right?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5O0cc0I0vk)"
Blake hasn’t dunked this season??? What the FUCK? That makes me incredibly sad and also incredibly embarrassed that I didn’t even know he regressed that badly despite believing myself to be a “Blake Stan.” What is life if Blake Griffin can’t dunk over a whole car windshield?
"I actually hope I'm wrong because I like Zion, but I just don't ever see him averaging 10 rebounds a game. And unless he improves his overall game, he's going to be severely limited once he hits 30 and the athleticism starts to fade. Do you see Blake Griffin now? I can totally see that being Zion, and he's not 6'10 like Blake. You can hardly blame these kids though. Give them $100 million dollars when they're 19 then expect them to work on their game. That's why Simmons will never develop a jump shot. They can't all be created like Kobe unfortunately."
*Blake Griffin has entered the chat.*
"what ?  this is about Westbrook, not Blake. That’s not moving the goalpost, that’s you arguing something that wasn’t relevant lmao.   The likelihood of Blake Griffin being washed is 100x more likely than Westbrook being washed. One is multiple seasons removed from being elite. The other is a few months away from being elite. One has missed 14 games since injury, the other has missed nearly 60. One has suffered a lot more injuries as of late that has kept that sidelined for a lot more games. One visually looks much worse compared to their former self than the other. One has actually been reported to be playing through injuries for SHORT bursts.  If Blake has been missing games and playing through injuries for over 80 games ...  why the fuck would he get the same evaluation as Westbrook?   If you’re entire point this whole time has been “well Blakes just been hurt this whole time for a whole season and some change” then you can’t possibly be trying to compare it Russell Westbrook ... right? Right???"
"Blake Griffin just a few years ago would still eat Robinson alive in the post. Some of these ""he can actually hold up well in the post"" guys are okay down there, but this isn't about them and it isn't an accurate representation of how good they are. This is Blake being cooked for right now."
I don’t give a shit what Karl Malone says  One of Zions closest player comparisons to me is Blake Griffin. Blake at his age (only 31) cant exactly play close to a high level anymore due to all the energies he’s had over his career. It’s been sad to watch and I think this is what Zion should try to avoid.
Blake griffin the actor and standup comedian?
I think he kinda is. He’s not like Blake Griffin who’s suddenly became extra washed
"Jerami Grant (didn’t think he’d handle the higher usage)  Julius Randle (I think last year was just a down year because he looked really good in Nola, but Impressed with his consistency so far and decision making)  Blake Griffin (surprisingly terrible, the heat game tells it all)   KD (didn’t think he’d still be this good I can’t lie lmao)   DeAndre Hunter (he’s gotten comfortable and looks like a legit high level 2-way (not just 3 and D) piece for the hawks)   DeAndre Ayton ( I really though he would look All-NBA caliber this year, haven’t given up hope at all though he’s still good)"
"Got damn at first the I was kind of sad that the Clips gave this man a huge contract (even putting him on a shirt with MLK) just to ship him out. After seeing this, I think that was the best gift of appreciation the Clippers have ever given anyone. This man is racking up Superstar money these last two seasons. The Clippers had a dream that one day Blake Griffin will be washed and still get paid for all he’s done for the Clippers franchise. That dream just happened to require Blake in Detroit...."
LAPD? This is Blake Griffin! Chris Paul is tryina beat me up!
"""A lot of guys who come into the league with insane athleticism grow their game. Blake Griffin hasn't done that.""  Who is upvoting this shit?"
"My personal hot take is the Raptors should send Lowry for assets and do a ""soft rebuild"", sort of what the Celtics did in 2013-14 and 2014-15.  I wasn't high on the Raptors coming into the season, for what it's worth.  I don't know what player is reasonably available that you could acquire.  Daniel Theis?  John Collins?  Blake Griffin?"
"Something I was thinking about was how everyone says the league is downsizing, but it's not centers who are dying out, regardless of what Shaq might say. It's the traditional power forward. If you're big enough, you just slide over to center (Derrick Favors), or play both positions (Anthony Davis). If you're not big enough to play center, then you need to expand your game, most notably with a three-point shot, which Blake, Paul Millsap, and Kevin Love have done in recent years.  Griffin had the ball-handling and passing skills, but he's needed to add the 3 to make up for the changing league, and his body deteriorating.   There aren't a lot of Horace Grant, Brian Grant, Charles Oakley type PFs in today's league. Most PFs are big wings, and/or have a more perimeter-oriented skill set."
I doubt Blake Griffin would react as sensitively as you did to what were simply remarks of concern and surprise.
"Has Blake not played the Heat in recent years?  This guy just seems disappointed, he wanted to see Blake Griffin not the ghost of Blake Griffin."
"It’s clearly a vendetta. There is 2 minutes of footage of him talking about how washed he is. We all know he sucks now. His remarks provided no insight to the game at hand, besides showing us how much he hates Blake Griffin."
Andre Drummond or Blake Griffin  Edit: This is assuming they're bought out and can be acquired for cheap
lmao sammmme! i thought he got traded for Blake Griffin bc of the Griffin rumours lol
"In their era they were great. Olajuwon would just be at most a healthy Embiid in today’s era, Drexler is just a worse Derozan, Kemp would be a worse Blake Griffin and Barkley would be at most equal to rookie Zion. Today’s era is far more athletic and more talented than the 90s, any star there would not be as dominant today."
"It's crazy to think about it since people like Blake Griffin made it on his rookie year, but LeBron's numbers were good although not great (20-5-6 on inefficient shooting -42%FG and 29%3P) and the Cavs didn't have a good season. He still had people like T-Mac, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce ahead for the forward spots."
Blake Griffin
Surprised I didn't see Blake Griffin with those names
Could also be Blake Griffin
"Agreed. CJs quick af. Isn't that a form of explosiveness? He doesn't jump out the gym like guys like Zion, Ja, or a young Blake Griffin, but that doesn't mean he's not athletic.   When I think of unathletic I think of guys like Zach Randolph, not CJ McCollum."
Lol wut? Did you tell them to google 'Blake Griffin'?
I’m gonna be so upset when Manu Ginobili doesn’t make the hall of fame but Blake Griffin does
"I could see him becoming something closer to Blake Griffin. He's young, but hopefully he'll mature and realize he needs to adjust his game to not rely on his explosiveness for most buckets."
"This is entirely on JV. Either move out from under the basket after the dunk or get “teabagged”. I’ve seen Blake Griffin literally grab defenders heads and shove them into his crotch on dunks, and they don’t react like JV did"
"Oh good, Harris and Middleton are still playing fantastic.  Glad we got Blake Griffin and Brandon Jennings out of those deals, plus that first round pick we gave up that basically became Shai Gilgeous-Alexander."
Blake griffin was better after 26 though
"Blake was averaging like 25/10 as an all NBA player BEFORE CP3 was traded there.   In no way did CP3 make Blake Griffin a top player he did that all on his own, but CP3 was the one who put them as a title contender/favourite."
chance of blake griffin willingly staying in Indiana seems about zero lol
"I'm worried about him being Blake Griffin. I think these hyper athletic big guys can have different career trajectories than your average player where their prime is their early 20s before their knees turn to dust. I hope I'm wrong because Zion is a beast, but his whole game is speed and strength and that may diminish in his early 30s or even earlier"
Yeah this is the Blake Griffin story in a nutshell   Lue is closing games with Morris at the 5 a lot I’m interested to see how it looks in the playoffs   Gallo for years used to have absurd stats on ISOs and post ups he was just a really good bucket getter who now can’t move. There are also other teams that might try him as a 5 some but atl is already log jammed there
"Jeff Teague, Wannamaker, Blake Griffin, Draymond Green, Aaron Baynes."
Kyrie  Curry  Lebron (prime)  Blake Griffin (prime)  Jokic
PG Kyrie Irving  SG Kobe Bryant  SF LeBron James  PF Blake Griffin C Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
Fucking Obi Toppin plays like Blake Griffin after 15 years in the league. I don’t get it.
"Yeah a lot people insist on a player's prime having to come at ages 26-30. Some peak earlier, some later, and the length of each prime is different. Maybe Zion will have more tools at that age, but will he be just as athletic and truly at his absolute best? Not saying it can't happen, but it's definitely not set in stone. Blake Griffin is a good example for this. Sure he got better at shooting and passing as he got older but I am still taking his rawer, younger version any day. Dwight, T-Mac, Gilbert Arenas, Kevin Love, Deron Williams come to mind as well."
"While I kinda agree with him landing soft and not just obliterating people like Blake Griffin, Zion still does have enough of an injury history to cause concern"
Blake griffin that’s all he is honestly
I had forgotten how good was rookie Blake Griffin.
**70 points or higher** * Devin Booker - 70pts **60 points or higher** * Carmelo Anthony - 62pts * Steph Curry - 62pts * James Harden - 61pts * Lebron James - 61pts * Damian Lillard - 61pts * Bradley Beal - 60pts * Klay Thompson - 60pts * Kemba Walker - 60pts **50 points or higher** * Russell Westbrook - 58pts * Kyrie Irving - 57pts * LaMarcus Aldridge - 56pts * DeMarcus Cousins - 56pts * Kevin Durant - 54pts * Fred Vanvleet - 54pts * Jimmy Butler - 53pts * Anthony Davis - 53pts * TJ Warren - 53pts * Giannis Antetokounmpo - 52pts * DeMar DeRozan - 52pts * D'Angelo Russell - 52pts * Isaiah Thomas - 52pts * John Wall - 52pts * Caris LeVert - 51pts * Kevin Love - 51pts * Khris Middleton - 51pts * Terrence Ross - 51pts * Eric Gordon - 50pts * Blake Griffin - 50pts * Nikola Jokic - 50pts * CJ McCollum - 50pts * Derrick Rose - 50pts * Lou Williams - 50pts * Trae Young - 50pts
"I'll tell you what I do, I trade for Blake Griffin"
We have Blake Griffin as proof
"Chris Paul stopped flopping, pat bev stopped playing dirty, and blake griffin can still jump. They’ve been unstoppable!"
"The pressure on today's dudes to win it all is insane. Ben Simmons has been playing in the league for about 3 years when people started calling for him to be traded because they couldn't win it all the previous year. Dame and Beal have always said they want to stay with their team, yet people keep calling for them to be traded because they aren't successful in the playoffs. Blake Griffin extended his contract in the Clippers despite the team being shit. Guess what? He got traded."
"Wait. Who barely dunks? Blake Griffin? In 2020/21, yeah - his knees are busted but that wasn't always the case. I hope you don't mean Zion barely dunks, [cause he's averaging over 2 dunks a game and yammed 33 down in his first 13 games alone.](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629627/shooting/)"
"""Hello 911? Blake Griffin tryna beat me up"" lol"
Blake Griffin maybe? Hopefully Zion's knees are better though
"For Hakeem &amp; 2 rings, who’s your franchise best player again? The walking corpse of Blake Griffin lmaooo"
Blake Griffin.
"Ah yes, let's return to the golden age of the early '00s when some of the ugliest and most unwatchable basketball was played. When scoring cratered and pace ground to historic lows. Can't wait to watch 80-75 games in the playoffs again.  And why are you watching the Pistons at all? If you watch one of the 3 worst teams in any league, it's gonna be ugly. What would possibly give you the impression that the Pistons are trying to win this year? As long as they're still under the Blake Griffin contact, they're going nowhere. They have no stars. They're a collection of draft busts, role players and projects. There is no style this roster could play that would result in even .500 play (which they have no incentive to pursue)."
"Chris Bosh - programmer  Blake Griffin - stand up comedian  Giannis, Kelly Oubre Jr - male model  D'Angelo Russell - photojournalist  Damian Lillard - rapper"
"What's the precedent for that kind of improvement? I think jason kidd was able to develop a decent, if streaky, outside jump shot. Blake griffin was able to develop a mid range jumper."
"Find out how loyal Dame is without a quarter billion supermax. Blake Griffin was loyal as all get out with the Clippers and they told him everything he wanted to hear, gave him the bag and then traded him to the Pistons before the ink on the contract dried. Loyalty in professional sports is really overrated."
"Maybe they expect to play like young Blake Griffin or Amare Stoudemire. Those two attacked the rim with violence on the break consistently. Young Amare was even more vicious, even after his ACL injury he didn't slow down. He and Nash were so dynamic in the pick n roll."
"One on hand, I was expecting like 2-3 filthy posters from Zion per game, which we aren’t getting. On the other hand, now I get really excited every time he goes for a crafty layup and lands softly after seeing what has happened to Blake griffin these past couple years."
Blake Griffin Eric Bledsoe love child
Please explain how Blake Griffin is unskilled. This might be one of the most baseless tales I’ve ever read.
"Blake Griffin is unskilled, Zion has at least some level of skill"
Obadiah Toppin plays like current day Blake Griffin instead of young Blake Griffin. I don’t get it. What’s up with him?
It seems like both can do whatever the fuck they want.   If im a star player and don't like my situation. I refuse to play or dog it hard.  If im a team that feels the need to move a player we sit him until he gets a suitor or we just trade his ass a la Blake Griffin.
He's like Barkley mixed with Blake Griffin. Blake never really had the touch around the basket those two had though
Blake Griffin isn't an authority on cars and Chris Paul is not an authority on insurance but despite that incredibly savvy and well financed corporations with reams of market research find that what Blake Griffin says about cars and what Chris Paul says about insurance sways people's opinions about those things.
Blake griffin can barely move. It's sad but at this point he's not much more than a 15-20 minutes spot up shooter.
Blake Griffin will never forget him
Do you really want to compare Mo Williams to Russ at the level they were at when KD and LeBron left?  Cause if so I have an All Star front court  DeMarcus Cousins and Blake Griffin to sell you
I honestly dont see what current Blake Griffin offers on a championship team.
"LaMarcus Aldridge also has 5 All NBA teams, as does Paul George and Blake Griffin, would you also include them?"
DeMar is a good example but Blake Griffin is an even better example
Is player one Blake griffin and player two buddy hield?
"Yeah imagine Deshaun Watson just throwing little dump-off passes, throwing the ball out of bounds, and sliding if he’s even close to getting sacked. These guys in the NBA get paid guaranteed money. Blake Griffin might get $70 million just to *not play* for the Pistons. And somehow these dudes are the victims? Crazy man. The entitlement is off the charts."
I heard the pistons are open to trade six time all star Blake Griffin. I'm sure they'd take on Durant's contract as part of the rebuild. Shame Brooklyn can't add a first round pick on the deal
"Problem I have with that logic is it only really applied to great players, it's not players empowerement, it's superstar who is worth his contract empowerement.  I understand and support the stars who uses all their power, and it's great for them but it's hilarious how some people are trying to spin it as ""NBA players have too much power now"" like we haven't seen what happened to Blake Griffin for example"
Are you saying Blake Griffin is black with one black parent but cannot be considered white with one white parent?
No. They will want another big body to throw at center or a wing creator/defender. What exactly would be the purpose of them signing Blake Griffin?
"&gt; He is pointing out the hypocrisy in that teams can sign players to long-term contracts with the promise of a future together (e.g. Blake Griffin and the Clippers) but **regularly DO NOT hold up their end of the bargain.**  The team's end of the bargain is to pay the player. The player's end of the bargain is to play for the team as requested. As long as the team pays the player, the team is well within their rights to do with him as they please.  If players want some power in the contract, you put in a NTC, or at the next CBA you negotiate to have allowances such that players can request trades publicly.  Everyone sat down at a table and agreed to a set of rules and regulations in 2017. What if teams come out and start complaining that they have to pay drummond $29m when he plays like he is worth $15m?  It is like signing up for a job that says you must wear a suit and tie to work, and then publicly complaining that your job makes you wear a suit and tie to work."
"Well said and excellent points made. I see Draymond’s main point as being slightly different and everything else as noise to that point. The issue players have is that teams choose to trade players and, with rare exception, fans see that as “part of the business”. When a player asks to be traded, or chooses to leave in free agency, there is a tendency for fans to have anger and resentment towards the player. I haven’t seen any fans burning their Clippers jerseys because Blake Griffin was traded, but they sure as shit would have burnt his jersey if he asked for a trade during peak lob city.   The issue for players is having the power to choose their destiny and be empowered. Pro sports is a rare marketplace where the most talented individuals can’t always choose their workplace and coworkers. On top of ceding control of their careers to billionaire “owners” they also don’t get the same fair shake from the consumer when they aren’t happy with their workplace."
That’s barely 2 years removed from superstardom Blake Griffin! Premium asset.
But blake griffin wont
"Sure, that's not a controversial statement. But in the context of this conversation you're implying its better that we focus on the wellbeing of drunk ass Tom Gores over Blake Griffin or Dan Gilbert over Andre Drummond.  The league isn't going anywhere, the only owner who ever sold his team who didn't want to or wasn't forced to by their finances was Donald Sterling and a dispute over players demanding a trade isn't bankrupting MLSE.  There's no reason to be on the ownership's side nearly ever."
"(Besides Jokic): Curry, Kyrie, Mccollum, Derozan. I love handles and/or pretty footwork. Loved Blake Griffin in his better days as well."
i agree with this point - i’m also super sympathetic to blake griffin having to watch a mock jersey retirement then get shipped to detroit in the dead of winter with no warning.  my contention is that teams not being classy or forthright about their transactions doesn’t mean that the players are being treated unequally
"What the fuck is this clown talking about? Drummond was intentionally giving 0 effort on both ends of the court. He clearly wants to be traded out and his thought process was to be a problem in the locker room and negatively impact the team on the court. Draymond has probably watched 0 Cavs games this year so he has no credibility to speak on Drummond and the Cavs. His trade value is already trash if we play him and he gets hurt it obviously puts the chances of moving him at 0%. He also doesn't want to play because it he gets injured he's going no where.  The Pistons are sitting Blake Griffin, the Pelicans sat Anthony Davis... Same shit. Protect the asset as you look to move them. The front office and the player are 100% behind these situations."
"If a player suddenly cant play because teams want to protect their trade value, and dumb players like IT and Blake Griffin push their bodies because they want to win....  Dont get mad at Kawhii for resting and ""protecting his own value"". Shpuld be a slight rule change, maybe a 24-48 hour notice before a player can just sit."
" **It’s been 431 days since Blake Griffin dunked a basketball in an NBA basketball game. He's shooting 35% from the field, can't guard anyone, and is left alone at the three point line because he is shooting just 27% from there over the last two seasons. Still want him?**"
"He should have brought up an example and called out an owner by name. The NBA acted real fast when Donald Sterling's tapes were released and forced him to sell the team.  There are plenty of times where coaches or teams get bad reputations for things that he is mentioning. The NBA and media do not punish those teams, NBA free agents punish those teams and coaches by refusing to go there. Look at the Knicks or other mediocre franchises.  Draymond is passionately ranting but to what end... seems like he's just venting. Kind of dumb.  He should have brought up the Clippers w/ Blake Griffin as an example."
"We kinda suck, but honestly almost all of our ""bets"" are working this season, which makes it feel better, especially now that we won't have to watch the shadow of Blake Griffin (not against him, he was trying, it was just sad to watch him).  I killed Weaver all of the offseason, but I was wrong, not that it was perfect, but he did some nice things...now it could all fall apart if Hayes just isn't good, but we'll see in 1 year"
"I'm sorry but Embiid is not a great shooter. Maybe 10 year ago at his size you could call him that, but he's like 4% under the league average for his career. Would you call Blake Griffin an elite shooter for his career? Embiid is, however, the most efficient post player in the league since hes arrived. he needs to bang down low like he has all year. He isnt in the MvP talk due to his range."
"Only the best of the best NBA players have a good amount of control ovet their careers. We're talking guys like LBJ, Durant, Steph, etc.  Mid-tier vets, stars, and even some all-stars don't have that luxury. The Blake Griffin trade comes to mind for instance.   Ricky Rubio and Kelly Oubre also didn't seem too pleased that they were traded by the Suns (they came to mind first because they're on my favorite team).   Oh, and don't forget about the draft that basically connects any good young player to the team that picks team for the duration of their rookie contract and their likely extension.  The absolute superstars have a lot of power, but let's not pretend that the teams have lost control here"
Blake. Griffin.
"I don't get part of his rant.  Why is it bad if a player wants to get traded, and the team is willing to trade him, that they come out and say they'll trade him? Like what the Cavs are doing is better than working on a trade and having Drummond blow his knee out going for a rebound or Blake Griffin with the Pistons?  I don't know, maybe I'm missing something. He's mad, rightfully so, about things like Cousins finding out in an interview, but also mad when trade intentions are announced ahead of time?"
Was this written by Blake Griffin?
What's that little rascal Blake Griffin up to?
I would be curious to watch Marc Gasol and Blake Griffin play together
He was in the playoffs with a strong detroit team and all star blake griffin. He then proceeded to get booed at his own stadium for being terrible.
What use do the Lakers have for Blake Griffin?
DJ convinced them to get Blake griffin
"I now i might be wrong, but i miss when Drummond and Tobias Harrys where on detroit. Was nice to have some young prodigies, and they made a decent team, but not so clutch. Now we have only Blake Griffin, that is getting old."
Blake Griffin basically broke off his engagement to be with her too. He's not capable of a performance like that anymore tho.
"Unfortunately, Blake Griffin can no longer jump at any chances."
why do people even care about the whole RotY thing. it was 3 years ago. and It's not like it was the first time that had happened. Blake Griffin won it in a similar situation no?
Once Blake Griffin gets bought out it’s a wrap for y’all
holy shit. you are braindead lol. saying Blake Griffin has little impact on winning yet acting like this career loser Drummond has any impact on winning.
"I always thought this was such a bitch move by Blake Griffin. like turn to him and say Fuck you, or I'm not gonna shake your hand. but he literally runs away from him lmao."
Blake Griffin and I have the same number of dunks in the NBA this year is a statement I've been waiting a while to make.
[Blake Griffin](https://i.redd.it/4hzw4916kug51.png)
Blake griffin for Westbrook.  Who says no?
Blake Griffin being on it is only SLIGHTLY weirder than Michael Jackson being on it.
People be like Griffin is washed up like Nic Batum last year.  Except Blake would be an awesome 4th or 5th option on a team if his only role is to shoot 3s and make layups.   Just look at Nic now. He only looks so good as a 4th option.  Not going to sleep on Blake. But I see him joining Milwaukee or a contender as a backup big.
trade him for blake griffin
"Blake ""Prodigy"" Griffin"
Thunder doesn't need Blake Griffin. Even if Pistons attach a 1st round pick sweetener.
"Don’t the Lakers need to pick up a player after a buyout? (Blake Griffin or Andre Drummond, perhaps)? They have no salary to trade away, and few draft picks to trade. How do they trade for a quality player? Any quality player?"
"At this point in his career, I don’t see why Blake Griffin couldn’t play some stretch center."
damn that blake griffin show is looking dope
Lol Blake griffin is just pranking us for his show
How much money did Blake Griffin have to give Ernie to be referred to as a superstar?
"Alright so I'm a nets fan, and I've been one since they moved to Brooklyn so it's been 8ish years. Watching the nets play isn't very fun anymore because we seem to dominate every game, and now with our Blake Griffin signing I feel like we're taking it too far and it doesn't feel right. It sounds counter intuitive to leave a fan base everyone wants to bandwagon on but I'm not feeling it anymore, ever since the KD and Kyrie signing (which I was and still am happy about) Anyways, despite the hassle it would be (because of all my memorabilia) what team should I be a fan of? I love the Brooklyn grit where everyone plays a big role on the team and we work harder than everyone else. So should I switch teams, or stay with Brooklyn. Of course I'd love a chip, but not like this :("
"He provides playmaking and not much else really, Nets needed to add defense not the corpse of Blake Griffin"
Blake Griffin Scripted Comedy Game Hour!!!
Bad timing with all the Blake griffin news but the dude is legitimately a good comic
“NBA superstar Blake Griffin”
Yo what if blake griffin signing to the Nets was just a prank for Blake Griffin's show?
“NBA superstar Blake griffin”
Too much tuna with Blake Griffin
Is Blake griffin still a superstar?
"""NBA Superstar Blake Griffin""  Well, once upon a time"
Ernie did it: he called Blake Griffin a superstar
Does that mean Blake Griffin going to Brooklyn will just be an elaborate prank?
"select ""oh fuck i'm literally giggling with joy watching you play"", sentient basketball watching /u/BUSean era (1991 season onwards, LIST INCOMPLETE):   -jordan   -entire 1992 dream team   -hakeem (who i hated because i loved david robinson)   -ginobili   -nowitzki   -blake griffin     -curry (easy #1 on the list)   -jokic"
I can’t believe people here are overreacting to this. As a Nets fan I’m not sold on Griffin but everyone else seems to think adding him makes it totally unfair.  I think Blake is washed but I hope he proves me wrong.
Blake Griffin is just Ersan Ilyasova with a big name
Are people forgetting that Blake Griffin has been like hot garbage this year. This doesn't move the needle for the Nets that much unless he just dramatically changes from how he was playing
Lol Blake Griffin isn’t good anymore.
"&gt; can be really dangerous as the roll man  This hasn't been true for years. It wasn't true in his final two-plus seasons with the Clippers, it wasn't true during his All-NBA season with the Pistons, and it's absolutely not true now that he's further declined physically.  &gt; He's not going to be asked to be an iso scorer anymore so his efficiency will get much better  He wasn't serving as an iso scorer this season. He'd post up, as ever---without anywhere near the success he once had---but well over 50% of his shots came from the perimeter. He sank 31.4% of those. His mark on catch-and-shoots was somewhat better at 34.6%, but still poor.   He can still knock down wide-open threes at a good clip, but I'm unclear as to how a Blake Griffin who can't effectively operate from the post, can't drive to the basket, and lacks the mobility to move effectively off the ball is going to see a dramatic increase in his efficiency and be an effective offense player. Or how he'd be a plus player at all, given that he's devolved from bad to disastrous on defense.   No offense, but I'm not sure how such plainly uneducated posts of yours get upvotes."
Now that Blake Griffin is on a good team again is he going to go back to dunking?
Blake Griffin to the Nets
Blake Griffin jus joined the nets..
"Have you watched Blake Griffin play anytime in the last 2 years?? he has no lateral quickness, no finishing ability, zero vertical, and even his shooting, ball handling, and passing skills have regressed massively. he won’t add much at all"
RemindMe! 1 week “has blake griffin dunked?”
"Name recognition aside, he was also far better than Blake Griffin currently is at that point where he got bought out."
"I think the reason we're interested is bc we have 3 backend roster spots open as of today. We had 3 10-day contracts expiring this weekend.   So yes, ideally we'd love an athletic big, but the real way Sean Marks is looking at it is... would you rather have Blake Griffin or Iman Shumpert? BG or Andre Roberson? BG or Tyler Cook?   So whether he'll get minutes, will be a topic of discussion, but having him on the roster over those other 3 seems like a no brainer."
Ibaka would like to speak with you after watching blake griffin jump over the hood of a car
"Bruh you’re just in denial. I’ve been saying why they’re better this whole time. The three stars are way better, we have the best 3 point shooter in the league, we have Bruce Brown and Jeff Green playing better than any of your role players, Claxton is emerging as another great role player, we’re going to get Blake Griffin. Are you really unable to see that? Have you even watched the games? Or do you just think the Lakers are good because the won last year? News flash: Last year is irrelevant now since the Nets created a super team"
Prime Blake Griffin
"One aspect that sucks is the dunkers off-hand usually is clobbering the defender in the face or head.  Often it seems to be giving the dunker leverage as well over the defender.  Great highlights, but they should be offensive fouls in my opinion.    It's true in this case, and it was often true in the cases of the Blake Griffin highlight dunks.  The [second dunk in this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzxFJa6rfsg) comes to mind.  In both this clip and the dunk from OP, it's actually somewhat of a dangerous foul as well.  Both players get knocked out of control while in the air."
"Yeah because he is the most extreme example of this, not Andrew Wiggins, Blake Griffin, or Horford..."
"Looks like it’s either Otto Porter for Drummond plus a 2nd or something or Jerami Grant + Rodney Mcgruder or other filler for Drummond + filler.  Idk if Jerami Grant is going anywhere but other than Blake Griffin there’s no way to get the salaries to match. I would like to see Grant in a Cavs jersey, really fits this team well. Especially if we are... trading Cedi 😢😢"
Blake Griffin next question
"Jarrett Allen has this same mindset and I loved him for it. Had some amazing blocks (Lebron James, Blake Griffin, Giannis) and has been postered plenty of times (John Collins, Marquese Chriss)."
Not quite. Celtics also need to take Blake Griffin so the pistons dont have to buy him out.
Yeah you have a great point. One semi related question: i felt like the main idea with the Grant signing was getting Blake Griffin some help (in the hopes of BG returning to his 2018-19 form). Did you guys also felt that way or was it clear during the Off-Season that Blake’s body was pretty much done?
"&gt;Pistons are expected to work toward a contract buyout with forward Blake Griffin  Blake to the Nets inc.  &gt;Several teams have pursued Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie in trade talks, sources said. There is appeal in acquiring Dinwiddie via trade in order to receive his Bird rights and offer him a deal for up to five years in free agency. Dinwiddie is expected to opt out of his $12.3 million player option for next season.  What team makes the most sense for Dinwiddie?"
"Yeah it's clear Griffin did not like how they dealt him considering he ignored Steve Ballmer in their first meeting after the trade. Like Blake said, it's kind of ridiculous he didn't talk to Blake at all after the trade but still wanted to do a little handshake for the media at that game."
"Or the old breaking your hand punching your ""friend"" in the face, aka thin skinned bully Blake Griffin  www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/la-sp-clippers-griffin-fight-20160128-story.html%3f_amp=true"
"Bitch is not common on the court. It's the strongest word you can use on the court. It's the number one word players don't want to be called. Blake Griffin said if you use that toward a player during a game you have to be ready to literally fight. So, it makes sense he was T'd for it."
"David Griffin ran the team this off season like Blake Griffin is playing. if you build a team thats worth less than the sum of it's parts, that's bad."
That was a vintage Blake Griffin chuck
Blake Griffin was in 2018
Maybe Blake Griffin will jump over Klay in a wheelchair
Prime Blake Griffin would like to have a word
"Interestingly, the dunk contest has a history of catching a lot of players before their true ascent into super stardom, so it creates this perpetual cycle where it feels like there’s no stars entering each year only to look back in hindsight and realize there’s names everywhere.   Just in the last 10 years or so, all-star caliber contestants have included Dwight Howard, Zach LaVine, Victor Oladipo, Donovan Mitchell, Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Giannis Antetokounmpo, John Wall, Mason Plumlee, Damian Lillard, Paul George, Serge Ibaka, and Blake Griffin."
 Maybe the clippers are trading Kawhi for Blake Griffin
"If he wins Rookie of the Month every month for the rest of the year, it's basically assured he'll make an All-NBA team sooner rather than later.    The only players to have won every single rookie of the months are:  * Luka * KAT * Dame * Blake Griffin * Chris Paul * Lebron * Carmelo * Tim Duncan * David Robinson  Okay i know correlation does not imply causation.  It's more like a fun fact."
"I think we originally intended to compete this year, not tank.  Vincent Goodwill reported that we were in on the FVV discussions but just got priced out. This occurred AFTER we signed Grant.  So imagine Blake is back to playing like he did in 2019 (third team all NBA), Rose is playing like he did last year, and then we add in Jerami Grant, FVV, Plumlee and Delon Wright.  Is that a world beater? Of course not. But that team probably competes for the 6th spot in the East.  Griffin, Rose and Hayes being as bad as they were was a surprise and now we're mostly trying to tank (as much as Casey likes playing vets 35 mpg).  It explains why we went through the different machinations to stretch guys instead of just biting the bullet."
"""Days since Blake Griffin dunked"""
"Nah this dude is just trying to get Knicks fans hype and then nothing will happen, or the star player will be like Blake Griffin and lolknicks will ensue. I'm not falling for this."
"Eww.   I said it when he was in college, his dunks aren’t impressive to me. I don’t know what people see in them, or his game. I feel validated on his game already. And now I feel she’s gonna go ‘viral’ for the wrong reasons bc he’s gonna really underwhelm in the dunk contest.   It’s already hard to excite as a big in a dunk contest, you gotta be a rare, twitchy athlete. Ala Shawn Kemp, Blake griffin. He is no Kemp or griffin. This would be like seeing Kenyon Martin in a dunk contest."
Blake Griffin can’t dunk anymore. They have so many problems. The fact that they’ve managed to beat some good teams means they coach is putting in some work.   The teams roster is easily the least talented roster in the league.
"Kobe was much better than Wade come on. Even Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Carmelo Anthony, James Harden"
"Going -5.2% and -1.8% is not ""pretty efficient"" lmao. Go slightly over the average TS is pretty efficient. Going under literally means you are worse efficiently than your peers. And since when a 2 wings with -DBPM over their careers are ""two defensive first wings"" now?  And what about Pistons? Well they are trying to lose as well just like you said that GSW did. They just sat Blake Griffin trying to trade him and traded Rose."
"The Old Generation of in game dunkers like Dwight, Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan are dying out.  I hope the new generation brings in some new in game dunkers. Doesn't seem to be much great in game dunkers these days."
Bye Blake Griffin and Plumlee
I'd like to see him help his team win.  I enjoy watching him and I like him.  Hell either become Barkley or Blake Griffin.
Young Dwight Howard and young Blake Griffin will forever be two of the most exciting players ever to watch. It looked like the Zion highschool mixtapes but in the mf NBA.
"Charles would be a superstar in today’s game, I think the best comps are almost Zion, Blake Griffin athleticism with a Zach Randolph postgame"
"Prime Blake Griffin was the closest in terms of physicality, versatility, and rebounding in my opinion. BG never got to the heights like Chuck did where he would singlehandedly win series, but Chuck is an all time great for good reason."
I'd rather deal with 20 games of Porzingis a season than Blake Griffin. It doesn't raise the needle for this team at all. It fucking sucks to say but we're all in on KP's health and bouncing back to a high level for the next two seasons
Blake Griffin (dressed as a clown): Hey! Kids! I bet you thought I was dead!  Well... Technically you're right.
"No, and they were never going to be effective.  From 2012:  &gt; The NBA announced Wednesday it will fine players for repeated acts of flopping, and at least one player says it’s no more than the league’s brass trying to get paid.  &gt; ""It's not going to win or lose games for anybody. It's a good way for the NBA to get more money,"" Los Angeles Clippers forward Blake Griffin said. ... ""[Y]ou're telling me if it's Game 7 of the NBA Finals and a guy has a chance to make a play he's going to be like, 'Well, do I want this $10,000 or do I want a championship?'""  https://sports.yahoo.com/sports/news/nba--blake-griffin--nba-s-new-flopping-rule-is-just-a-money-grab.html  Blake was a [notorious flopper](https://youtu.be/mHgADbmFLCM) in 2012. When the target of a penalty straight-up says the penalty isn't going to deter them, then it seems kinda self-evident that it isn't going to deter others, either."
D Rose? AD? Blake Griffin?
"I heard on a podcast years ago that Blake Griffin would scream and one every time he even took a jumper, so that referees would be conditioned to it when he went to the rim.   Not totally sure the benefit. As a ref, I'm no more or less likely to call a foul just because you yell and 1"
It's okay Blake Griffin I still love you.
It’s easily Blake Griffin
"Blake Griffin, maybe Marc Gasol?"
Blake Griffin is arguably the only player in NBA history to go from an actual legitimately bad shooter to a good one so him but his knees gave out so
Blake Griffin is 100% the answer to this
Oh for sure. I wasn’t trying to make a claim for Smith as the all-time Clipper. Was mostly just trying to fill folks in on who he was. I do think he’s underrated but I do not believe he had the impact on the franchise and sustained individual stardom of Chris Paul or even Blake Griffin.
"Ok so, Clippers acceptable answers are:  Chris Paul  Danny Manning   Blake griffin   Young and Full of potential Lamar Odom    Here’s the thing, we"
"&gt;Ben's contact is the reason Powell fell like he did  Yes, I'm not denying that, it should indeed be a foul. I wouldn't even be too mad if it was called a flagrant on Ben.    My point is that ""hard fall =&gt; uneccesary contact =&gt; flagrant foul"" isn't necessarily true, and isn't how flagrant fouls are defined or called.    &gt;any hard contact that fucks how a guy is landing should be considered reckless   this is what the comment I replied to asserted. This is simply not true, even aside from this particular play in question - there's tons of examples of blocks throwing dunkers off balance and messing with their landing, none of which would be considered flagrant:  - [Shannon Brown on Mario West, called a foul, but clearly not flagrant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCosVKXcmTE)  - [Kenneth Faried on Dion Waiters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTNNtJsiZU4)  - [Blake Griffin on Deron Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t98hZOkoUIY)  - [Marquese Chriss on John Collins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2YUOWbGwQA)  - [Gordon Hayward twice on the same play against the Celtics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHuflreCWs4)   Forget Simmons / Powell, these are all examples of hard blocks messing with a guys landing. Tell me which of these are flagrant?"
"Wiggins was still second fiddle to a much better player in KAT. Who is Jerami trying to share the ball with, Saddiq Bey and the ghost of half of Blake Griffin?"
Given his salary (8th highest in the league)? Blake Griffin.
"I think the dunk contest should take a hiatus for a few years. It seems like all the dunks have been done and people are doing stuff with props or mascots and stuff. Also I miss when stars like vince Carter, blake griffin, or dwight would participate.    Maybe if the contest takes a hiatus, it can be hyped up when it returns."
"I meant that he wasn’t going to be given the time to retire as a Nugget unless Stan Kroenke suddenly stopped caring about money more than anything else in the world, but who are we to know? Blake Griffin was supposed to retire a clipper and we saw how that turned out. Once you’re disposable, a team will get rid of you. Not saying chauncey was at that time, but again, he was 33 and a “later prime” doesn’t exist for anyone in basketball other than LeBron, Kareem, or Karl Malone.  Also, his career high was in 09/10 and his shooting percentages suffered as a result of that. I’m also puzzled at you saying Mr. Colorado and him being our dude and having no idea what he means to this community as if that’s lost on me. My guy, I’m from Colorado and I’ve been a nuggets fan for longer than I can remember. And that includes multiple seasons of being garbáge before Melo got here. The fact that you’re holding a grudge for someone else is a bit much because it really isn’t that serious bro"
"So Jarrett Allen and Joe Ingles are #1&amp;2 in the league this year at about 70% &amp; this “objectively “ means they are more efficient scorers than let’s say  Lebron who is at #82 &amp; at 59.1%.  Or Blake Griffin who is ranked #188th &amp; at 49.1%. That’s objective in deciding who’s more efficient at scoring?   So if it’s “objective” then its the same measure as FT% where Chris Paul &amp; KAT are #1&amp;2 at 97.2% &amp; 94.6% The 82nd ranked player is Luguentz Dort at 74.7% How about even the 110th ranked since I can’t even look up the 188th quickly enough, Marvin Bagley at 54.5%. That’s the same equivalent?   Somehow we change a measure of efficiency by just adding up nonsense &amp; averaging out and giving it a lie for a name.  It’s not “true shooting” it’s FALSE shooting.   GTFO!! with what ever idiot taught people this trash.  People who watch and follow the game forever &amp; know what it’s about would never even look at TS% as a real stat.   It’s another nonsensical advanced statistic that doesn’t measure anything just some stupid number we can add to try to act like baseball advanced statistics."
"Picking a Buffalo Braves player for the Clippers shows a willingness to cut corners though.  Blake Griffin was the obvious choice after CP3, but even Elton Brand would've made more sense.  Although there isn't any animosity between cities, picking a Braves player is like picking a Sonics player for the Thunder.  There's virtually no continuity other than some very occasional efforts by the team to try and make a couple bucks off retro Braves gear.  We probably would've retired jerseys for McAdoo and Smith a long time ago if that wasn't the case."
"He finished 4th, Blake Griffin was 3rd. But like you said they weren't realistically in the MVP conversation, no one was actually picking them over KD or Lebron. Post-Shaq the only times a big man was legitimately in the MVP conversation through the whole season were the year Dirk won and the year Dwight was runner-up to Derrick Rose.   But since Shaq actually retired I don't think a big man has gotten a single 1st-place vote for MVP, this could be the first time in a decade."
61% because he only shoots 1 foot from the basket. Zion is just a new Blake Griffin. I know he is fun to watch but he will end up being just as impactful.
I still can’t believe y’all made that trade with us.  And I still can’t believe we made the dumbass decision to trade Tobias 2 seasons later for Blake Griffin.
"Love booker, but Zion isn’t undeserving. He’s breaking MJ, shaq, Lebron records to start a career and tied Blake griffin for fastest ever to 1000 pts. He also made a new nba record for most efficient fg% among any other players first 40 games in nba history."
"Denial of what exactly? I don't mean you specifically but for some people if you are not a star you are just plain trash. It would be nice to be convinced of how bad/overrated Porzingis is or how little his value is through an elaborate discussion instead of hot takes and recency bias.  This guy averaged 30 a game in the bubble and you could argue if he didn't get injured the Mavs had a legit chance of upsetting the Clippers in the playoffs. A couple of months and an injury go by and suddenly he's that bad. A 7ft3 guy who plays like a shooting guard and only jacks up threes? Well go and ask Carlisle about that one. Can't protect the rim? Maybe is because most big men operate from the perimeter or the high post, I don't know.  Yet a guy who has missed more games than he's played over the last two years is still giving you 20 and 8 a night and is showcasing a unique skillset at still only 25 years old. But hey no, let's put him at the level of Blake Griffin or DeMarcus Cousins."
"Can confirm. Also, watch [this postgame interview with Blake Griffin where RJax picks the worst possible time to crash it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9GXgax36BM)"
"&gt; Now, I'm biracial, black and white but look very white.  Blake Griffin is that you? 🤣  Jkjkjk. But seriously though, I'm glad you were able to keep your cool somewhat. Something like that would have me devastated, I'd probably walk out without saying anything."
The all Kendall Jenner starting 5:  PG Jordan Clarkson  SG Devin Booker  SF Ben Simmons  PF Kyle Kuzma  C Blake Griffin
Mavs fans really cant except the fact hes 7'3 and had how many knee surgeries already.....its over for him.....but they will downvote you to hell and call you in idiot even though every giant that's had knee issues never recovers. Look at Blake Griffin hes like 6'9 and his body looks like a greek god and his career is almost over idk why they think 7'3 Zingus is going to be the first to over come his knees and be lukas robin.
"Brooooo imagine Naz Reid, Blake Griffin duo!!!! Domination!"
KAT for Blake Griffin trade confirmed.
"I would prefer Drummond or Bamba or Blake Griffin or basically anyone else, but the Lakers need help rn and the Marc Gasol/LamerMorrisTwin/Trezz rotation just isn't good enough.."
Yeah but looks at lamelos  distance from the rim. His only chance was to chuck it in a la Blake griffin
Was Blake Griffin not on the supermax?
Blake griffin dunking over HOOD of the car annoyed me lol
Chris Paul/Blake Griffin would be a fun one.
"You see, I was thinking maybe someone confused him for Steve Blake and then someone thought Steve Blake was Blake Griffin."
I think Blake Griffin got him once too because Blake completely sold out on it being a fadeaway and he guessed correctly.  1:16 mark here: https://youtu.be/bsGQZ2p-XHg
"This news is a couple of days old.  He's supposed to get another scan sometime this week (don't think he's gotten it yet).   But even if he's good to go Nash makes players do a ""ramp up"" where they still need to be out for a couple of weeks to practice and get back up to speed and into shape. That's why Blake Griffin hasn't been playing even though he's medically able to."
"Cuz the Nets have an MVP candidate, and 2 all star starters, aswell a blake griffin and possibly drummond/tucker in a buyout"
Can you explain micro fracture surgeries to me. I remember it basically killed Amare and Cwebbs knees. Thought Blake Griffin got that too?
Zion needs to follow the Blake griffin trajectory
"I get what he’s trying to say. As a 31 year old who use to go all out on workouts, and now has pains everywhere it makes sense. Derrick Rose and Blake Griffin show what happens when you go balls to the wall every game. I’m also in awe at the level of play LBJ can play day in day out."
"Right now? Probably Blake Griffin, I guess?"
Blake Griffin has a TV show?
"Basketball could use a ton of work to make a better product. Superteams are bad for the league because only 2-3 teams have a chance to win the championship most years, Boooring. And then there is the buy out market where disgruntled players on bad contracts get bought out(blake griffin) and then they also hop on said superteam.   Before the season started we thought this would be the most balanced season of all time. Nope Brooklyn is now golden state 2.0 with lebron the only one standing in their way. I dont blame the players I blame the league for having a soft salary cap and giving too much power to players"
Blake Griffin
Did... did we forget Blake Griffin? Dude who’s career was effectively ended by injuries far too soon?
"I expect him to randomly pop off in his first or second game back and make /r/NBA have the biggest overreaction ever saying prime Blake Griffin is back or some stupid shite, and then the rest of the season he'll look like the washed up no knees player everyone expected."
Blake Griffin look like a black guy that jumped into a pit of Cheetos for like 10 days... and then popped up
See Blake Griffin getting traded out of LA less then a year after signing a max contract and a mock jersey retirement
"Exactly. The occasional Blake Griffin elbow to the face is nothing in comparison to Luka, Trae, and Harden making games unwatchable with all the ticky tack bullshit."
"When Blake Griffin comes he’s gonna get them too, even though he’s not that good, he’s been. A star for years and the refs know him as a star so he’s gonna get that star treatment"
"I’d probably donate most of my salary, as I don’t believe individuals should even have that much money in the first place. But let’s be real, who knows what they’d actually do in a given situation. I’m just saying what I see as the right thing to do, from a sideline perspective. And I also said I wasn’t referring to Love necessarily. Parsons and Blake Griffin types though."
"I mean bro, Lakers are a strong team, but not a super team. We don’t have three absolute stars, just two.   If you told someone that the nets would have Kevin Durant, Kylie Irving, James Harden, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan with Steve Nash fucking coaching them they wouldn’t believe it. They probably would try to send David Stern into the future to stop it."
"Hey, he’s funnier than Blake Griffin?"
"Exactly. When a dude like Parsons or Blake Griffin bags a massive deal and then doesn’t play even close to the level they’re expected to, it hurts other mid tier players as well as fans who won’t get to see their team achieve much. By all means, judge the person who gave the contract, but I also think it isn’t unreasonable to say that players with $100+million contracts who aren’t playing even close to their expected level are hurting their organizations by not renegotiating the deal. Not even talking about Love here, but the whole “business-is-business” notion bothers me. Teams with over performing stars on low contracts (like Curry back in the day) should offer the players a better contract and vice versa. Greed shouldn’t be held up as “good business” imo"
Young Blake Griffin player profile of a high flyer athletic 4 with a meh jumper is like an NFL RB. Not that useful and has a short shelf life.
"I mean with Blake Griffin it becomes 4. If Kyrie,KD,Harden and Griffin are all the floor one of them is scoring and the 3 have major gravity."
"Blake griffin has been plagued by injuries throughout his entire career, mostly in his legs. Early in his career he was known for his hops which requires a lot of jumping which broke him down even quicker.  Apart from Steph’s ankles (which the warriors have been very protective of) he’s been pretty fortunate (or smart, depending on how you look at it)  And Harden has basically been an ironman, hardly ever missing games due to injury until the last few years  Multiple injuries will shorten any professional sports player’s career"
because blake griffin does not have knees anymore..
"Theres a difference between being a fan and being a blind homer. All signs show he will sign with the nets. He is from new york, he will start for them, played with blake griffin and they can pay him more."
Blake griffin playing?
HOU should have traded him when they had the chance. Now he's probably going to be the PG version of Blake Griffin and you just saw how much DET had to eat out of his contract.
Ever seen prime Blake Griffin?
You mean Blake Griffin.
Blake Griffin promising the world that he can still dunk.... times have changed
Vince Carter once said he didn't want to dunk anymore before continuing to dunk. I wonder if Blake Griffin will be the inverse of that.
"The Nets just got Blake Griffin and they're not the Pistons or that Knicks team, when they picked up 100 PFs in one offseason.  Kevin Love would likely go to Milwaukee or Miami, something like that."
"Nets (scanning menu): ""Yeah, I'll have the, uh, #23, Blake Griffin, please""    Pistons: ""Would you like Plumlee with that?""    Nets: ""Uh, sure. Super-size me"""
Isnt ge basically a young blake griffin?
They should trade Blake Griffin for him
Blake Griffin or Serge Ibaka.
They lost Blake Griffin so they want young Blake Griffin lite?
Is he really that bad now? Like Blake griffin levels of bad?  Haven't watched more than like one spurs games this years but I have bballrefd LA and seen his stats Hella low compared 5o previous years
"I couldn't think of any, and then I remembered that old man Blake Griffin used to have a highlight or two. So you're right.   I'm still betting on Ant as the spiritual heir to Half Man Half Amazing, that dunk on Yuta is exactly what VC would do, go baseline and dunk on the help whoever it was.. Mutomobo, whoever."
I wonder if Love could get a full MLE offer to make up the difference.  I think Blake Griffin left more money on the table than he can make up.
"Nash really pushes this ""ramp up"" thing. They're doing the same thing with Blake Griffin.  Even if a player is medically cleared to play in games, they need to ""ramp up"" for like 2 weeks before they actually will play."
See a lot of blake Griffin highlights
"Just give them a questonnaire with ""What team are these players on currently?""  Would weed out so much chaff and journalists who don't actually follow recent basketball, or even that season's basketball.  You could use these players' for example:  What team are these players on currently?  D Rose  Oladipo  Blake Griffin  Javale McGee  Even 1 or 2 wrong and you're out would solve most problems"
reminds me of early blake griffin dunks
"Sure, tell that to Lebron, Giannis, Blake Griffin..."
"Blake Griffin. Completely reinvented his game after he was injured and couldn't be as explosive. Easy to root for, great guy"
Why are there cars in the background? Was blake griffin there jumping over them during halftime?
Blake Griffin
"Pretty sure this is all part of his new show, Double Cross with Blake Griffin on Tru TV. Not sure who is  getting pranked though."
"Blake Griffin was one, but not anymore"
"Blake Griffin was a year behind me at OCS in Edmond, Oklahoma growing up. Watching this, and seeing how he hasn't changed was awesome. He was willing to just roll with the show's weirdness and obscenity and not lose his cool or anything and still laugh. Blake is such a great guy!"
Euro Blake Griffin
I miss 2014 Blake Griffin.
"This guy is good looking, talented and charming. If he were a Knick or a Laker (or even a Clipper - hell, Blake Griffin isn't too easy on the eyes, and he had a shit ton of promos), this guy would be in 1/4 of all commercials, billboards and movies."
Still boggles my mind that Draymond can still dunk and Blake Griffin can’t. 2014 was a long time ago but I refuse to accept I’m old
"Best PR: Blake Griffin  His public persona is funny and quirky, but his personality on the court is angry. Very very angry."
"Blake griffin was a hs senior when I was in 7th grade (tiny private school with shared gym). I’ll never ever forget the day, that Monstar was doing weighted bench dips with 3x45lb on his lap while I tried to crank out 2 sets of 10 push-ups right next to him."
You have no concept of what Blake Griffin was good at besides dunking? You could atleast just look at some stats and get somewhat of an idea instead of asking strangers to explain obvious things to you
"I thought you could, because didn't you trade Blake Griffin a few months after giving him his extension? I know you can't trade them right away but I thought you could if you wait til the deadline"
Alley oop man like Blake griffin was in LA
Blake Griffin was an all star as a rookie.
"If I didn't know any better, I'd say Blake Griffin - but I know that dude isn't white."
"It's not even a talking point anymore, nobody cares about blake griffin on the Nets all the talk is about wtf is going on with KD"
Literally nobody is losing their minds. Why does everything have to eventually be about the Lakers ?  The only reason the Blake signing is talked about is because he’s Blake Griffin and used to be an All Star. No thinks it does anything for the Nets from a basketball perspective
Blake Griffin looks like a Greenpoint kind of guy
"lmao the nets are resting 2 people, washed blake griffin and KD who is coming of an achilles, I would personally rather have KD rest than to rush him back, have him get reinjured, and be fucked as he sits out the rest of his contract"
people fail to separate reputation with current level of play in most cases  so many people still think Oladipo is elite when he's dropped off a ton since his injuries  the overhyping of Blake Griffin is another example
"Yeah that's definitely not the case, however, he should be guarding KD when it counts, I'd like to see how KD would try and score on him, it'd be very difficult for him.   Though the Nets don't even need to run KD in any of their actions, they just pick on whomever your weakest defender is on, if that player is on Harris, then he screens and pops for an open 3, if that player is Bruce Brown (or soon to be Blake Griffin) than he short rolls and has a 4-on-3. It's really not fair."
Blake Griffin has entered the chat
"#118 in defensive WS (kyrie Irving is 124) that should speak for itself   #348 in defensive rating ( behind Blake griffin, John Collins, Devin booker, and kemba walker) 5 notoriously horrific defensive players.  While the nuggets are #16 in overall defence.  Therefore jokics is a one trick pony who does nothing on defence and does not have an impact defensively I fail to see how that’s the MVP.   I could even argue the reasoning for his offensive numbers being so good is due to his lack of impact/effort on D. Atleast with Embiid he was doing both offence and defence at a high level so I could see his case. But jokic has no REAL case hence why lebrons ahead of him in almost every MVP race right now except the one that ranks MVP standing on pure stats."
"LOL if I must.   #118 in defensive WS (kyrie Irving is 124) that should speak for itself   #348 in defensive rating ( behind Blake griffin, John Collins, Devin booker, and kemba walker) 5 notoriously horrific defensive players.  While the nuggets are #16 in overall defence.  Therefore jokics is a one trick pony who does nothing on defence and does not have an impact defensively I fail to see how that’s the MVP."
Blake Griffin would be permanently suspended due to too many flagrants.
"Harden has only missed one game since he’s been here(and they lost that one) and KD has been out about a month, possibly longer. Harden deserves a nod. He’s literally only playing with one other all star right now, unless we are still under belief that Clippers Blake Griffin is walking through that door, which he isn’t."
"But KD isnt playing, and Kyrie is missing even more games than Harden lol.  Blake isnt spacing the floor or seeing much game time to begin with. He’s one of the worst players in the league currently.   Hell, even if he does play better, Blake fucking Griffin shouldnt be a needle mover in an MVP race.  The Nets could very likely collapse if Harden were to miss any significant time. He’s the ONLY player on that team that plays every game, and performs every game.  It’s just funny seeing people dismiss his case for reasons that arent even true. The Nets big 3 have played 6 games together, and it doesnt look like thay number will increase any time soon."
"&gt; Multiple all-nba is exceeding expectations as a #1 pick.  Let's see how many #1 picks have 2 all-nba team selections or more. There are 73 #1 picks  1958 Elgin Baylor - 10  1960 Oscar Robertson - 11  1968 Elvin Hayes - 6  1969 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar - 15  1974 Bill Walton - 2  1975 David Thompson - 2  1979 Magic Johnson - 10  1982 James Worthy - 2  1984 Hakeem Olajuwon - 12  1985 Patrick Ewing - 7  1987 David Robinson - 10  Staring the 1988-1989 season, there is the introduction of a 3rd team  1990 Derrick Coleman - 2  1992 Shaq - 14  1993 Chris Webber - 5  1996 Allen Iverson - 7  1997 Tim Duncan - 15  2002 Yao Ming - 5  2003 LeBron James - 16  2004 Dwight Howard - 8  2009 Blake Griffin - 5  2011 Kyrie Irving - 2  2012 Anthony Davis - 4  So yeah, 1 of 22 #1 picks with at least 2 all-nba selections"
"Yeah, the only guy who I wanted gone admittedly was KO because he was absolutely lost out there but he's made me and a lot of others eat our words. Plus, there was nobody to really go after to replace him besides...Blake Griffin..."
"Yes, I’d say he’s pretty well-above average as far as number 1 picks go. I usually think of Blake Griffin and John Wall when I think of #1 picks who met but didn’t exceed expectations. Kyrie has definitely surpassed them by this point imo"
"Nope. He needed LeBron, flopped with the celtics, quit playing for zoom meetings, thinks the earth is flat, and is winning again with KD, harden and now blake griffin. Yawn"
Nets should trade blake griffin for pj tucker haha
"Yeah agreed. I wasn't even a Clippers, or Pistons fan but my dad and I LOVE to watch Blake Griffin play. He was such an exciting player a"
What if he does some Blake Griffin hit and takes a buyout to come off the bench.
Who even exists with Hortford type contracts anymore?  There was Blake Griffin but he's bought out. Tobias Harris is living up to his contract. Westbrook seems to be doing decent now. Wall seems to be doing decent.  I don't see many bad long-term contracts out there right now tbh.
And will be remembered forever as the centerpiece of the Blake Griffin trade
Does this mean the Nets have allstar Blake Griffin?
Dame dolla Zach lavine The Klaw Blake griffin Jokic
"Heh, you have quite the misunderstanding. clearly haven't been here for very long so let me lay it out for you.  Blake Griffin has been sandbagging ever since his injury. first score he's gonna make is 13 foot somersault lob dunk. He's gonna get at least 2 full rotations."
"I feel like if the pistons traded grant, that would be a HORRIBLE look on the franchise. Grant turned down the same money, a starting role on what would most likely be a championship contender if he stayed on the nuggets. He chose to go to Detroit because he wanted to play for the GM (OKC connection) and a black coach. If they traded him 1 year in, that would be like when the clippers traded Blake griffin, but like probably worse"
"LeStans mad that KD is a better GM than him. Got Blake Griffin for vet min,.a washed up Blake but I can't imagine getting a much better player if at all for vet min that even this version of Blake. And Brooklyn still has MLE, DPE and possibly Dinwiddie to trade."
Why are you worried about how Blake Griffin signing with the Nets impacts LeBron James?
When the fuck did Blake Griffin turn into a maker of superteams? LeBron fans say the wildest shit Jesus Christ
Hilarious that Harden and Kyrie are not the reasons KD has lost his leadership role in Shannon’s mind. It’s a 2021 ghost of blake griffin.
"Not sure they are really getting doubted much. Look at the Blake Griffin threads, the majority of the comments are complaining about the league being boring because of super teams"
Shannon came up for air off LeBron's dick to criticise KD for playing on a stacked team and the corpse of Blake Griffin was the tipping point?  What a clown
Blake griffin definitely gonna lead the nets to a chip.  blake finals mvp incoming
"Dude is averaging 28/8/9, better than LeBron's career averages, but yeah, could be Blake Griffin... Talent says nothing about his accomplishments, he is absolutely a generational TALENT, maybe not gonna be as successful but his talent with a basketball is insane"
"Sure, but it's premature to call him a generational talent until he actually proves to be a generational talent. He could just as easily fade into a Blake Griffin path."
You don't think they colluded tho? KD seems the type to always want help tho. Blake griffin didn't but for sure harden did.
"Griffin is like super washed, I would be surprised if he even plays much in the playoffs lmao. Everyone just looks at the name Blake Griffin and overreacts so bad to this signing. It’s just a depth signing at this point. He won’t be a major contributor. Maybe he’ll be a good locker room presence and can offer secondary playmaking at times, that’s about it."
"Harden and griffin should not even be mentioned in the same sentence, they could have picked up Kyle Korver and it would be as impactful as Blake griffin. Griffin just still has a star name, I doubt he’s more that a garbage time player for them."
wait so Shannon response to 2021 Blake Griffin joining the Nets was ... KD isn’t leading them anymore?   Lol.
"I'd take the Nets with Peter Griffin, let alone peak all-star Blake Griffin."
Blake Griffin taught him well in Detroit.
"Iggy wanted to be RELEASED not traded so he could get every cent of his contact AND choose where else to go ring chase. And to try to force the situation,  and be just that bit more petty and c unprofessional, he wouldn't even show up for any team related activity,  let alone playing in a game for the Grizz.  Memphis was within its rights to suspend and finds him for not honoring his contract,  but being a small market team they didn't want to damage their reputation with agents and players, so they let Iggy play hooky for the year. I'm glad though that at least they stick to their principle of not just waiving him like he wanted.   If you are an over the hill ring chaser, at least work out a buyout like Blake Griffin or LaMarcus Aldridge, but Igoudala was way too greedy to do even that."
"Ok, I'm not doing ten because that's too many, but. I can't sleep so I'll give you a starting 5.  PG: **Bugs Bunny**  This may seem like a cop out, since he [apparently](https://thewordwebzine.weebly.com/sports/analytical-breakdown-of-the-space-jam-tune-squad) played point in the original space jam, but since I've never seen the movie I think I'll still do it. I'm looking for him to be a fast moving pass-first point guard in the mold of a JJ Barea or Chris Clemons; with a quick first step and good leverage on taller players. Defenders actually have to play back a bit further than they might for a taller playmaker (which they're comfortable doing because his release point is so low), which should give him the space to make some elaborate gags... sorry, *plays* and break down defense in the halfcourt.  SG: **Alan Powers**  Iconic character from the Arthur franchise Powers, better known as The [Brain](https://arthur.fandom.com/wiki/Alan_Powers), is actually one of the few characters on this list who is confirmed to be a basketball player, and an elite one a that. In the first episode of season 14 (The Wheel Deal), we see that he is a next level shooter, apparently capable of draining hundreds of free throws in a row. In the mold of a Joe Harris or a stockier Duncan Robinson, he is a *literal* bear who can be trusted to get to his spot and make the shot. Additionally, with a confirmed IQ of ~140, I think he will be an invaluable asset as a big body who can get position and make the extra pass.  SF: **Prospero** It's been a long time since I read the play, but I'm reasonably sure that Prospero was the antagonist of Shakespeare's [The Tempest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tempest). I'm not looking for much here, he's probably by far the worst of the starters... but since he got exiled to an island I think his magical abilities present surprising upside on a *great* contract. Hopefully his proclivity for plotting and penchant for potions translate to a sort of defensive floor general role in the mold of a slightly less evil Draymond Green.  PF: **Hobbes** Although I would be interested in what the realist philosopher could bring to the table, in the power forward position I've chosen the titular tiger from Bill Watterson's ""Calvin and Hobbes."" Hobbes is a athletic freak, capable of astonishing high speed contortions and explosive acrobatics. He has unmatched straight line speed and [elite](https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/05/27) agility. In the mold of a skinny Blake Griffin or even Charles Barkley type, I'm expecting a lot of activity on the boards and a good nose for putbacks. His number one asset is his motor, which as a cat is only really bested by patches of sunlight... fortunately, no NBA arenas have windows.  C: **Mr. Hyde** The alter ego of Dr. Jekyll... it's not clear to me whether the pre-game serum he takes to transform would be banned by the league, but I can't imagine it's that different from gatorade so I'll allow it. He is described as a violent, hulking figure with a disposition towards arson trampling. This is no posh fop or dainty cartoon, he is quite literally a metaphor for evil, and I think he brings a much needed raw audacity to the group, the kind of creature to impose his will on the game and ""dominate erneh."" He's definitely going to be a bit undersized, but we've seen plenty of centers who've made that work. Look for Look for him to play a Daniel Theis type role, potentially morphing back into Dr. Jekyll when he's at the three point line for the steady hand and scientists eye.   I think they fizzle out in the conference finals tbh."
He's no Blake Griffin in that regard
"Aldridge would get destroyed every game, probably foul out in 15 minutes   Blake griffin would get destroyed on payton/malone PnRs   Fox would hold up well against KD, but KD still wins that matchup   Kyrie wouldn't get 20 on payton  Kobe/harden would be a show for the ages"
Oh no don't tell me Blake Griffin did bad things I don't know about lol
"Rodman is insane, dirty, and assaulted a camera man  Garnett is my all time least favorite player other than Pedo Malone. He was a dick to everyone, even mocking Tim Duncan's dead mother on mothers day  Lamar Odom was a criminal that would do anything to make money  Metta World Peace is insane and tried to murder James Harden   Iggy is a really good guy, no problems with him  Rondo is an arrogant bitch and a stain on the Celtics history  Jimmy Butler is fine  Magic Johnson is one of my favorite players, but also one of my team's biggest rivals   If he replaced Butler and Iggy with Karl Malone and Blake Griffin this would be my all time least favorite players list"
2009:  Steph Curry  James Harden  Demar DeRozan  Blake Griffin  Taj Gibson  6th man: Jrue Holiday
James Harden - Gojou Satoru (both cute)  Jayson Tatum - Phil from promised neverland  Damian Lillard - Roy Mustang  Blake Griffin - Kagami  Russell Westbrook - Bakugo   LeBron James - Ash Ketchum (really good but always loses when it matters)  Jerome Robinson/Kevin Knox - Brock (brock)  Ben Simmons - Rock Lee (talented)  Luka Doncic - Gaara (young prodigy)  Michael Jordan - Jiren (goated chad with hella game)  Steph Curry - Leorio
"&gt; we’re not a superteam  ""not a superteam"" yet have two superstars and a bunch of former all-stars like Marc Gasol, Andre Drummond just like the Nets. Oh wait Gasol is washed? Just like LMA and Blake Griffin lol."
"They whine about the Nets all the time, after Blake Griffin joined the Nets they collectively lost their minds."
"Organizational philosophies differ. I think part of the reason Blake was able to get a buyout is that Weaver had just arrived and wanted a fresh start with the roster. Presti traded for Horford, he's not some anvil left over from the last front office, so I don't think there's the same appetite to just buy him out rather than keeping him on the books in the hopes of turning him into something useful. In other words, Horford isn't an unwanted roster problem the same way that Griffin was for Detroit.   In the scenario I described, the incentive for Horford to give up money in a buyout is so that he could sign with a contender and ring chase. Every year counts for a guy that old. If he waits for the offseason release he misses the 2022 playoffs.   I don't think it's likely that Horford gives up a significant amount in a buyout, though, so I don't think a buyout is at all likely."
"Ben Mclemore is as useful is not more useful than Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge right now, where the outrage over this move?"
"Well, many Kuroko no Basket characters are based on or very similar to NBA players. Akashi = CP3, undersized pg that does everything, a little psycho too. Midorima = Klay, oversized sg that only shoots 3s and plays good D. Aomine is based on Kobe, the ""ball hog"", behind the backboard shots. Kise is similar to Kobe as well, his ability to copy moves but his all-roundedness is more like LBJ. Kagami = young Blake Griffin or Zion.  But I want to see something like Isaiah Thomas, last pick in the draft, MVP contender, tragic backstory."
"“Just to eek out a win” lmao this team still has Harden, KD, and Blake Griffin who didn’t even play and they can still beat top 5 seeds in the East. It’s completely unfair"
It’s that magic Brooklyn water that magically transformed Blake Griffin into dunking Blake Griffin.
Is Blake Griffin a roboto like a certain someone now.
Blake Griffin said exactly that back in 2012 when they announced the flopping fines.   https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--blake-griffin--nba-s-new-flopping-rule-is-just-a-money-grab.html
Never Forget  Clipper4Life Blake Griffin
Gonna leave this here   [Non shooting foul drawn rate by season](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/players?stat_category=foul_drawing)  2021 Jokic: 5.0% 1st in the entire NBA   2020: 4.5% again 1st in the NBA per CTG amongst guys who played &gt;1000 min  2019: 4.6% tied for 2nd in the NBA  I  dont think him never getting a call from the refs is the issue. I think he gets tons of calls when it comes to non shooting fouls. I think his lack of elevation and how he doesnt get off the ground quickly contributes to him not generating the fouls people wants on his shots. He doesnt flop to the degree an Embiid does but the guy who actually led the NBA in non shooting foul rate in 2019 was Blake Griffin. Another guy who even in 2019 it was obvious his lift was clearly not close to what it used to be. Refs also just havent liked Blake Griffin for years which may be one factor here also.
Blake griffin was the worst. Jumping over the hood of a car

"Lol Lakers are not a super team. Lebron and AD are not a super team. KD, Kyrie, Harden (and if you want, Blake Griffin and LMA) is something different."
Blake Griffin
You taking Blake Griffin over Tobias Harris too because you used to be an all star?
Looks terrible. I would have preferred Blake griffin.
"Avoiding using Anthony Edwards, who is too young to see what's going on, here is where I'd rank the ones in the post-Jordan era. He's definitely above average.   1. Lebron James 2. Dwight Howard 3. Anthony Davis 4. Zion Williamson 5. Kyrie Irving 6. Derrick Rose 7. Blake Griffin 8. Ben Simmons 9. John Wall 10. Karl-Anthony Towns 11. Deandre Ayton 12. Yao Ming 13. Elton Brand 14. Andrew Bogut 15. Kenyon Martin 16. Greg Oden 17. Kwame Brown 18. Andrew Wiggins 19. Andrea Bargnani 20. Michael Olowakandi 21. Markelle Fultz 22. Anthony Bennett  Only one I feel bad about is Greg Oden. He was a bad pick beause his one leg was longer than the other, so he never got to see his prime, but his talent was there to be one of the best ones had been built for pro play.   Derrick Rose could go lower if you're judging solely on full career (and Zion probably doesn't belong as high), but we saw what he was at his peak, and it was an MVP, so that's why he's rated above a guy like Blake Griffin that had better longevity.   The Towns-Elton Brand grouping could also be shuffled up based on personal preference. Those guys are close, and I honestly feel Ayton probably ends up the best of the bunch."
"Griffin was a top 5 MVP candidate. Way above Simmons.   Wall was 5x allstar and averaged 23 and 11 and allD 2nd team.   Simmons has more to proves to pass Blake, Wall or Rose.   He is 7th on that list of 11 players. So he is about mid-tier for a number 1 pick."
The Nets lost AND Blake Griffin was playing? Coincidence? I think not.
Blake Griffin got injured and washed Celtics fan  What a terrible rebuttal
Last three years:  Blake Griffin:   One time all star  All-NBA Third Team  Tobias Harris:  ...
"I think the Blake Griffin comparison is a little bit of stretch. Klay can realistically rely on his shooting imo even after these devastating injuries, and that’s what he’s been doing for a living."
Probably gonna be some form of a Blake Griffin situation. I suppose we'll wait and see.
"I don't think people really have an issue with teams collecting okayish assets for little to nothing. Good teams who are favorites to make a run for the chip will always attract these types of players who aren't really fitting on their current team for various reasons, but still have some ability left.   I do think something could be done with certain situations. I don't really think it's all that cool that my Team is on the hook for a crap ton of money to Blake Griffin (thanks SVG!), but that's just the way it works. Maybe the League can create a circumstance like you described where teams can apply for some salary cap relief or something similar and have it approved or denied on a case by case basis to be paid by the team that picks the player up. I don't think a 100% exchange of salary is likely, but something could be done to make the situation more equitable."
"Cause if we look at his past teams those teams end up being better with him.  Clippers were just much better with him (until Kawhi came of course), Blake Griffin wouldn’t have gotten them far and neither would Tobias Harris in that very short stint.  Rockets basically missed the finals because he got injured. They become a worse team after he’s traded for Russ  Okc is talented as always, but he had them over performing and almost beat that rockets team in just a season  And while the Suns are getting momentum from that amazing bubble performance, I don’t think they’d be 2nd seed good without Cp3 this season.  Him being there just makes good teams even better then they should be."
blake griffin
Here’s him living vicariously through KG [dunking on Blake Griffin ](https://youtu.be/o8xCDvWQ20U) at the end
"The Clippers roster weren't good in 2014 because of things happening to Redick, Griffin and Jordan in 2021 ?  Blake was litterally a top 5 player in 2015 and Deandre made all nba first team lol (yeah the center spot sucked)."
This is year one of a tank. They had a ton of bad contracts and bad draft picks thanks to Stan Van Gundy. He mortgaged they’re whole future and money to build a team around Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond.  This is a complete year down.
"The Pistons were at the top of the NBA - six straight trips to the ECF, back to back Finals appearance and one quarter away from repeating as champions in 2005 against the Spurs  After that the owner died, his wife took over, Dumars ran the team into the ground, did not rebuild properly, gave away big contracts to terrible players, drafted decently but due to the coaching carousel never developed these players and watched as players like Middleton, Dinwiddie, and others thrived once they left.  Then Davidson's wife sold the team to Tom Gores, a coke addict billionaire who despite much success in other areas of life - can not run a basketball team.  The coaching carousel continued with Ron Jeremy aka Jeff's lil bro aka Stan Van Build a fucking a Wall being hired as a Coach/GM combo. He proceeded to put the keys of the franchise in the hands of one of the best point guards of probably the last thirty years, Reggie Jackson. Then on the eve of being fired, and supposedly at the behest of said coke addict, SVG mortgaged the entire future (or whatever was left of it) in order to get Blake Griffin.  Once Blake Griffin recovered from the shock of his premature jersey retirement and traded to the D, he actually put together a really great string of games. The Pistons had a chance to do right by him and trade him to a team and get big assets, possibly more than what they traded away. But instead they chose to keep him, he got injured (again), and was just bought out.  Now we have hired Weaver, a new GM from Presti's tree in OKC, who so far has been swindled on various trades, drafted big men only to pay Plumlee 8M to start, let Christian Wood walk for nothing (when it was all but confirmed he wanted to stay in Detroit), drafted Killian Hayes (a reach).  On the bright side, we bought out Blake Griffin, the only player besides Sekou (who you really cant call an NBA player maybe G league) left over from last year.  Something to keep in mind, since 1980 the Pistons have drafted in the top 5 only THREE times - 1981 - Isiah Thomas, 1994 - Grant Hill, 2003 - Darko Milicic.  In the past 40 years, the Pistons have drafted in the top 5 - 3 times.  Not bad enough to be in the top of the draft, but not good enough to actually make some noise.  In that 40 year period only 10 franchises won a championship - Celtics, Lakers, Bulls, Sixers, Spurs, Heat, Mavericks, Cavs, Warriors, Raptors.  I know it's a grim outlook but we did have the Bad Boys Pistons two chips and the Going to Work Pistons that forced the league to change the rules and brought home a chip in 2004. And despite the hard times im still proud to be a Pistons fan and will be till the end! GO PISTONS!"
"Do athletic players careers not last as long? I always hear about this but I am not sure this really is the case. We all know about Derrick Rose who suffered an injury or someone like Cam Newton in the NFL but athletic players can afford to lose a step while borderline slow players can't. Like Kevin Love and Blake Griffin are both the same position and same age and 1 was an athletic freak while the other one was very skilled. They are both dropping off at around the same age. Zion Williamson isn't just really athletic, he also has really great BBIQ so I think he can be someone who continues to develop skills as he ages like Karl Malone and Lebron James did."
They’ve had Alridge for 1 game and Blake for 5 and even if they were there since the trade I still take Allen over Griffin for sure and probably LMA too.
"&gt;Joe Harris, LMA, Blake Griffin a superteam.  The Nets have a Big 3 that's it, don't try to make it sound like they have anything more than 3 All NBA caliber players. These guys are role players, Joe Harris will see minutes in the Playoffs, but one of LMA &amp; Blake will not."
"No one considers just harden and Kyrie a superteam....we consider Kyrie, Harden, Durant, Joe Harris, LMA, Blake Griffin a superteam."
look at blake griffin
"Imagine thinking that having injured Wade &amp; Bosh then Kyrie &amp; Love is anyway comparable to having Steph, Klay &amp; Draymond then Harden &amp; Kyrie as well as a still effective LaMarcus Aldridge &amp; Blake Griffin as 4th &amp; 5th options."
They really should a cast Blake Griffin in this somehow. His sense of humor and comedic timing would have been perfect for something like this.
"It reminds me of the trade we made to get Blake Griffin in to pair with our all star (Drummond). Unfortunately, unless they get more pieces, then their max is gonna be a first round exit. This could go down as a horrendous trade, like the Griffin one was."
Blake Griffin is Kuwabara
Blake Griffin is gonna end up playing very little when the games matter because he is also not good.
hes gonna play as much as blake griffin
"*Clock running down to 5 seconds Giannis with the ball, he crosses, he hop steps, OH MY GOD GIANNIS JUST PUT BLAKE GRIFFIN ON A POSTER AT THE BUZZER THIS IS AN ALL TIME HIGHLIGHT IN NBA HISTORY. Nets win 138-95. And now they’re saying it’s a 2*"
"“Few pieces away”... if by a few pieces you mean KD, Kyrie, James Harden, Blake Griffin and now Aldridge...  Yeah.. not exactly a few pieces there buddy... the Knicks this year are well ahead of where they were projected to be.. at the very least the Knicks didn’t have to buy their championship.  If the nets win this year 1 no one will give a shit and 2 it will have an asterisk on it forever... that’s what this season has shown..  In fact, the sheer amount of movement from guys who want rings to the nets has only served to spark conversation about change in the way buyouts, trades etc. should be handled to stop it from happening again."
"Bro, Donald Sterling got banned from the league for walking people around the locker room and telling them to look at, “all of his beautiful black bodies” and parading Blake Griffin around at public events like his prized jewel."
Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge   But seriously probably Kawhi. He needs less playmaking responsibilities and less offensive requirements. He should just go all out defensively and play good team ball.
"The Clippers didn't want to deal him, he wanted to leave.  Blake Griffin is the one who had the major injury problems, Chris knew he would never win anything relying on him."
"Refs generally are focused on enforcing two different sets of rules for ""in the post"" verse everywhere else.  The amount of physical play that is allowed in the post vs everywhere is why LMA, Blake Griffin, Dwight Howard, et.cetera are minimum contract players.  If refs enforced the same set of rules... a lot of these players would get a lot more foul calls. Imagine all of the Harden touch fouls that happen... then compare that to what post players get away with when defending big men... it makes absolutely no sense."
"24 years old, wasn't hard-core into basketball until I saw Blake Griffin in college, followed the bosh raptors kind of before then   Once Blake got drafted to the Clippers I immediately became a fan   I suspect there have been an influx of Canadian clipper fans due to Kawhi Leonard as well"
1. KD  2. Harden  3. Kyrie  4. Harris  5. Dinwiddie  6. Aldridge  7. Claxton  8. Bruce Brown  9. Blake Griffin
"He looked great last night, but of course he’s going to try to ball out during his first game with a new team.  Same with Blake Griffin on the Nets. I will be surprised if they can keep up this effort and energy for the rest of the season and playoffs."
"Yep! The KIA is the exact moment I gave up on the dunk contest.  In part because I hate Blake Griffin, and it was super obvious they were going to make him the winner...once they rolled out a fucking car for him."
"Read somewhere he wanted to jump end to end over a convertible with Baron Davis in it, but NBA+Kia made him do that wack dunk   [https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/06/blake-griffin-kia-optima-2011-nba-dunk-contest-clippers](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/06/blake-griffin-kia-optima-2011-nba-dunk-contest-clippers)"
"He didn't get robbed in 2017 when did that drone BS. That shit was so bad. Get brand integrations out of the dunk contest, that's how we got Blake Griffin dunking over a Kia.  But also, dunk contests should be ranked choice. Ratings are, and have been meaningless when you never give below a 7. Just give points based on rank. So every contestant says like Gordon's dunk was 1st, Lavines was second and they get points based on that. Do best of 3. No ties. None of that crap."
I recently got into watching the nba and I liked watching harden but after 6 month of me enjoying watching him he gets traded to the biggest power house in the league but Blake griffin who is also one of my favorite players also went there so I might just support the nets for awhile
"Honestly, there are some guys that I'm absolutely flummoxed when they get no foul calls. Jokic is one.   Blake Griffin back in the day was another. Dude legit got choked out on the floor and punched by Zbo back in the day. Honestly I feel like the refs letting dudes play hard with him led to his short peak."
So we like Blake Griffin again? He's back to being a stud after joining the Nets? Dude was playing a decade long joke to land with a super team
"Come on, Blake Griffin off the bench doesn’t mean anything. You are seriously impressed so far? I can argue the other role players coming off the bench are more effective than BG."
"&gt; Spurs fans and Piston fans are going to be biased because they watched them underperform.  He didn't really underperform, we had no expectations of him coming into the season after multiple surgeries and rehabs and everyone in our sub knew he was washed after game 3.  &gt; I strongly believe that they weren’t giving their full effort and nothings going to change that for me so of course what you watched is going to make you say their washed.  What has Griffin showed you on the Nets that shows he's not washed? His FG% is up because he's getting easy looks, just like our former Piston, Bruce Brown, but his stats are the same, his defense is the same, his passing is the same. Everything is the same, take Nets Griffin and put him back on Detroit playing 30 minutes at the point forward role and we start losing every game again.  &gt; You really trying to tell me you don’t think Blake couldn’t of gotten a SINGLE dunk if he wanted to on the Pistons  Maybe, I don't see a situation this year that he ever beats his man and doesn't get stuffed the shit out of at the rim. I remember one game it looked like he was going to dunk then he changed his mind because he was going to get mauled by the center and did some acrobatic layup that somehow went in for an and-1 earlier this year, but that's the only time I could have seen him attempt a dunk, think he attempted a putback also and missed. He barely dunked when he had arguably his best season as a pro in 2019 and frequently gets blocked driving to the rim because he has no lift so I'm not surprised that he went 25 games without dunking while having multiple rehabs/surgeries inbetween."
"I'm curious what is yalls frame of reference when you say these Blake and Aldridge weren't trying for their former teams. Have you watched more than 10 Pistons games in the past 12 years?   Just interesting to me how everyone who says this nonsense about Griffin happens to be a fan of a completely different team than the Pistons or Nets while fans who actually watch the games they play in clearly know far more than you and agree they're not a 5th of the players they used to be.   Griffin is the Nets' 8th/9th option off the bench, he's washed as fuck. That doesn't mean he's not a great pickup because he can still makes plays and plays smart, but he's still washed compared to what he was just two years ago.   &gt; these dudes clearly stopped putting in their full effort and obviously didn’t want to put in the effort to just try and get into the playoffs.  No words"
"You’re telling me guys would be down to play 2 weeks after the deaths of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Spencer Dinwiddie, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, TLC, Claxton, Alize Johnson, Bruce Brown, Chiozza, and Perry? You’re out of your goddamn mind.  And I used the Nets because they have the most stars, but the same is applicable with every team. You don’t have a mass casualty event like that and just keep playing like nothing happened. I know money talks but no league is that insensitive."
"They literally still have Blake Griffin, Harden, and KD who weren’t even playing this game lol."
"Smh only up 30 on the 4 seed in the conference midway through the second quarter with Blake Griffin, James Harden, and Kevin Durant not even playing. Wonder why people think these guys are the title favorites."
Jesus Blake griffin off the bench. And if dinwiddie was healthy too my god.
"It truly is ridiculous lol. The cap is $112M, the Nets were at $166M and they were able to acquire 2 players with a total 2021 salary of $60M on top of that. The players on their roster are making a total of $220M if you take out the money that LMA and Blake gave back in their buyouts. They played the #4 team in their conference tonight and won by 22, and Griffin, James Harden, and fucking Kevin Durant weren’t even active. What the fuck."
Do you realize that if you add up the contract of every buyout player the Bucks have got since 2015 it comes out to less than Blake Griffin’s salary alone? Getting Shabazz Muhammad off a buyout isn’t going to hurt the Bucks finances in the same way that the Nets acquiring $60M combined between Griffin and Aldridge. It’s not even close to the same lol.
My favorite part of shattered knees Blake Griffin is the HOF DPOY level defense he gives night and and night out
Blake griffin may make a late run
Nobody made Detroit trade for Blake Griffin - a trade everybody at the time thought was a terrible idea. Nobody made Detroit give Andre Drummond a shitload of money when the flaws in his game were obvious. Nobody made Cleveland *trade* for Andre Drummond when he was obviously in I Don't Give A Shit Mode for the foreseeable future.  The problem isn't that Detroit and Cleveland are small markets. The problem is that they have shitty front offices whose only solution to literally every problem they create is to whine about how better teams are better than them.
"I fully get the notion of hating on good teams. But, what the fuck? These rule changes do nothing to make shitty franchises stop being shitty. The Cavs were paying Drummond *$29 million dollars.* Blake Griffin was getting *$32 million dollars* from Detroit. Those two franchises are terrible. The Spurs got rid of Aldridge *despite being in the playoff hunt.* Good fucking god. Some people act like the Lakers got Giannis and Curry for free while the Nets got Lillard and Jokic for nothing. The players that get bought out are guys way past their peak that will be role players for their team and who may not even get any relevant playing time come postseason."
"No, I hate seeing the same thing posted in every thread   Like how every Blake Griffin dunking post has the same 5 comments"
"Zion is a beast no doubt, but even in college he wasn’t a leader. The thing about heavily hyped forwards like him is when they do succeed they post huge numbers because they dominate the paint with their athleticism, something like Davis, Towns, Blake Griffin; you get the idea.  These types of players don’t win championships without the help of that “other guy”; like Kobe and Shaq.. the big will put up the numbers, but won’t make that push. Historically, anyway.  I’m not even saying I’d take Tatum. Statistically without a doubt Zion. If I want to WIN, I take Tatum."
LaMarcus Aldridge and Blake Griffin
[Woj]: The Detroit Pistons are filing a lawsuit against the Brooklyn Nets for robbery of F Blake Griffin
You're crazy if you think a single team would pay 30m in taxed salary for washed blake griffin lol
"With the growing cap space, trades for a minimum contract are gonna be hard to do. And is there really any benefit in that case for the buyout player's original team? Instead of getting nothing, they'll just get someone like E'twaun Moore for Blake Griffin."
Blake Griffin is out as well
"5-7 minutes of a roleplayer being marginally better than an opposing roleplayer generally doesn’t make a huge difference. I would be very surprised if Blake Griffin swung a single playoff game either way, let alone an entire series."
And the one against Giannis they were missing Blake Griffin and had Thon starting at PF trying to mark him up. Drummond could have been Jesus Christ himself and he was getting swept in that series.
Blake griffin was a perennial mvp candidate
Blake Griffin is 6'9 and is still playing in the NBA...have to be pretty ignorant to think he cant dunk lol
Motivated Blake Griffin vs Motivated BJ Penn please Dana
"Ah, the good ol' Blake ""Sandbagging"" Griffin."
"The guy can dunk, but people here acting like this is proof that he's old Blake or was faking are absurd. He was a focus of defenses after a huge knee injury and an on ball player in Detroit.   On the Nets he's like the 9th option and often playing against rotation players... And still doesn't look great. He's played a lot of big minutes in his career and will no doubt help the Nets on a run... But he's not Blake Griffin of old that fleeced the Pistons. Man... He hit two threes late and otherwise would've had like 7 or 8 points."
Blake Griffin sucks... 🤣🤣🤣
"Imagine if the Nets do not win the title this year with Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan, Joe Harris, etc (assuming they're all playing). It would be an absolute embarrassment.   I'm honestly rooting for them to choke to see the backlash."
"Blake Griffin might not be a starter, but he definitely deserves to close out games."
Blake Griffin pretty much won this game. Dude was good defensively when I was watchin and had good shots.   If he can just knock down open 3s he's going to be a damn good role player :)
Blake Griffin +23. He's just trying to play winning basketball as a Net
Blake Griffin was beautiful tonight
Blake Griffin probably just damn near sealed the game with his pick on Wood and the 3.  Hilarious.
"Kobe on those garbage mid-2000's teams was amazing to watch. Then you have your obvious answers: MJ, Cavs LeBron, VC. Early Blake Griffin was bonkers paired with DeAndre Jordan. Dennis Rodman was a spectacle. I can't put a definitive top 5 together."
"Steph, White Chocolate, Prime Blake Griffin, Prime Vince, Orlando Shaq, Pre-Injury Penny, Rookie Lebron, Kobe, Prime Baron Davis.  I distinctly remember that period of time (1998 - 2000) when White Chocolate, # 8 Kobe, and Vince Carter were always in the top 10 on Sportscenter. It was all must see tv."
So did Blake Griffin and Lou Williams.
Honestly not sold on AG yet either. Hasn't shown me enough. Another Blake Griffin all athleticism no shooting skill. Maybe he will improve but not likely.
"Don't disagree with any of the names above, just wanted to remind everyone of how fun it was to watch prime Blake Griffin soaring through the air."
Fournier really cost them that game lol  Left Harris wide open and then decided to post up fucking Blake Griffin.
"Blake Griffin, Mike James, and Joe Harris with +17 or better"
Blake Griffin is the hardest working man in the NBA
I rather Lakers repeat than Blake griffin be a champ
"Blake griffin is either flailing for a call, complaining to the refs or faking not being able to dunk - I just don't think he's a trustworthy dude"
My guy trying to post up Blake Griffin
Blake fucking Griffin early in his career. Seemed like he had 4 of ESPN’s top 10 plays every other night lol
Ha - they were just talking on *The Mismatch* how Blake Griffin leads the league in charges taken per game.
Bill Walton - C Matt Bonner - PF Blake Griffin - SF Delonte West - SG Luke Ridinour - PG
Some of my favorite players Vince carter Russell westbrook Blake griffin Allen iverson
Blake Griffin definitely had his moment
"Wreckless, wow that puts it into perspective you got me thinking. Maybe other guys had the same athleticism as Blake Griffin, but mentally they wouldn't attempt something like his dunk on Kendrick Perkins for their own sake or experience with an injury."
"Washed isn't a fair categorization IMO. Blake Griffin isn't a typical bench piece, the dude can go off for 30 pts in a single playoff game and change the tide of the series if it even was remotely close.   No bench in the league has a Blake Griffin at their disposal, and even if he is ""washed"" as you say, he'll be far more productive then most teams bench pieces."
I thought he’d be just another Blake Griffin but his finishes around the rim is next level for a player his age lol he actually has really soft touch around the rim
"Fine, I’ll accept Cade to the Pistons for the loss of Blake Griffin."
I thought that the pistons weren't going to be able to get rid of rose and Blake griffin and that they would be mediocre but I was wrong. Thank goodness I was wrong
Kobe was a good shooter bro I don’t know what you’re talking about. His percentages may not reflect that because he had horrible shot selection... but he could shoot from anywhere at any time with hands in his face or not.   Were talking about a guy that made 12 3s in a game and you’re comparing him to Demar derozan lol.   And why wouldn’t his game change with today’s game? We’ve seen players like Blake Griffin who couldn’t shoot anything when he came into league become a decent shooter so why wouldn’t Kobe adjust his game...
"I know but while there's athletic and skilled players like Blake Griffin, how does terrible post scorer Andre Drummond become a lottery pick?"
"Not really, they’re just both 6’10 scoring forwards. That’s where the comparisons end. Beasley was like a 6’10 Melo/ old Blake Griffin combo he could beat guys off the dribble, take them to the post and back them down, or just shoot over them. MPJ is more like a 6’10 Klay Thompson who can just rise up and shoot over anyone. I dont see it"
Imagine having KD and Harden out and still having Kyrie and Blake griffin on the floor.
blake griffin shoots free throws like he's a center
"ah yes, the top players blake griffin and andre drummond"
&gt;Huh? Who was saying Rose was washed?  A lot of people. The media isn't exactly dying to talk about the Pistons or Minny so you get people who just don't know anything about the players on these teams. Look at how people were acting about the Blake Griffin buyout.
"Blake Griffin and Brooke Lopez are other ones that stand out.  Post is informative, but the title is a bit sensational instead of just stating the facts."
Piston’s Blake griffin
"Kevin is one to talk, 2 former MVPs on one team, one extremely good point guard in kyrie, a previous all star player in DeAndre Jordan, a washed up Blake Griffin, and a decent bench to compliment them."
"Yeah KD who couldn’t win with young Westbrook and Harden. Followed by a more mature Westbrook and great supporting cast.   Vs Curry coming off a 73-9 win season, a Draymond mental lapse away from back to back titles. And there’s literal evidence Curry got “the job done” without KD. But we haven’t seen KD get “the job done” without Curry.  Instead KD buddied himself up, again, with Kyrie, Harden, Blake Griffin, recently retired LMA. To have as much help as possible to get it done. On an already stacked Brooklyn team before he showed up.   https://youtu.be/qJUHKIxj51A KD hasn’t seen a double team in like 5+ years now."
I want Blake Griffin to win FMVP just so I can canoe down a river of tears.
"KD, Harden, Kyrie, Joe Harris?, Who the fuck else?, Blake Griffin  seems reasonable"
Blake Griffin also had crazy dunks as a rookie
police this is Blake Griffin come quick
bro they gave Blake Griffin an and-1 call after Lonzo literally left the premises and didn't even touch him. The refs have screwed over Zion and the Pels just as much as the Pels have screwed themselves.
Vintage Blake Griffin
Gonna laugh my ass off when Blake Griffin has a 20 point game in the playoffs
Blake Griffin is the hardest working player in the NBA
It's crazy that Zion makes 260 pound Blake Griffin look small.
Fuck Blake Griffin.
Blake Griffin pulled a Grandpa Joe.
This commentator is a dumbass talking about why people were mad at the Blake Griffin situation.  BLAKE GRIFFIN GETTING MAX MONEY WAS GIVING HORRIBLE PRODUCTION.  BLAKE GRIFFIN ON A MINIMUM CONTRACT IS A DIFFERENT STORY  Fucking idiot lmao
Saying that Brook Lopez and Jrue Holiday are all-stars is like saying the Lakers had all-stars Rajon Rondo and Dwight Howard last year.  By this logic DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin are all-stars for the Nets and they have 5 all-stars.
"Yes, read the comments.  Also it’s funny because no one called it “stacking” until we signed freaking Blake Griffin and Aldridge. When we traded for Harden the narrative was that the Nets had no depth, no defense and that there was only one ball."
"Blake Griffin on the max would not help any team, Blake Griffin on min is a fantastic deal.              I think Blake can be good for 10+ minutes in playoffs and he can help reduce the load on their superstars in regular season."
"These are the teams he ""Dominated""  \- Pistons without Blake Griffin   \- Magic without Johnathan Isaac and Aaron Gordon  \- Kyrie celtics with a unhealthy hayward"
"The Nets outside of their big 3 have Joe Harris (one of the top 3 poimt shooters), Landry Shamet ( slowly turning into one of the best 3 poimt shooters), Jeff Green ( very valuable role player), Blake Griffin ( still decent) and Claxton who is a very versatile defender. Who tf do the sixers have outside of their big 3? Danny Green and shake Milton? Who do the bucks have on their supporting cast? A 36 year old PJ Tucker? Lmao."
Channeling all their chakras into Blake Griffin so he can dunk over a Kia again.
"&gt; Man fuck Blake Griffin, can't believe he did that to the Pistons man. Hope y'all boo him for the rest of his career  - Kings fan"
"&gt;but how do you know this is actually true? How do you know he was putting additional stress on his body in 2018-2019?  probably because pistons fans watch pistons games, which were games overwhelmingly likely to feature Blake Griffin in 2019."
A rational Pistons fan when it comes to Blake Griffin? Wow.
Morant goes to the rim like prime Blake griffin
"Isn't Blake Griffin making less than a rookie, so he should be considered a young core?"
"Cause if Blake Griffin learned how to shoot anyone can. Well, except Ben Simmons"
"Donald Sterling was so fucking horrible. It takes a special kind of incompetence to fail despite all the advantages that merely being in Los Angeles gives you.  Thank goodness for the ping pong balls giving us Blake Griffin, also Clipper legend V. Stiviano."
No no it is not.what would we have Ariza and the corpse of Blake Griffin?
How’s Brooklyn gonna stop Embiid? With Blake Griffin?
"Honestly this is the most reasonable take here. LeBron gets hacked, refs don't call it all the time, LeBron flops because of that, etc. etc.   His complaining annoyed me but alot of athletic bigs like him and Blake Griffin constantly go in and get swatted and unless they sell it, esp. if it's a smaller player, the ref will swallow their whistle"
Blake Griffin dunking as a Net
"Bro what the fuck? We're arguing a hypothetical right now. Im not saying the Heat ARE that good, Im saying if they got a version of Oladipo that was better than his 23ppg, 37% pt shooting, 1st team all defense indiana pacers self, alongside Herro and Robinson playing the best basketball of their careers, they would be.  Did you just forget what we were talking about because you're boner for the nets was just THAT hard? Because THAT would be embarrassing.   As a side note, 2 great 3pt shooters, jeff green and the corpse of blake griffin is not an incredible supporting cast."
"Yes they do, Joe Harria and Landry shamet are two of the top 3 poimt shooters in the league. Blake Griffin and Green are valuable bench pieces who only get better when Harden and Durant are on the floor. The Heat ARE NOT THAT GOOD STOP BEING DELUSIONAL. Holy shit this is embarrassing."
"I disagree. I haven't played Madden in years and I'm WAY more of a basketball than football fan, but the game play feels so much less broken than 2K. Part of that is because 2K copy/pasted stats and tendencies to random players that are nothing alike. A Twitter user went into depth, calling out 2K with tons of screenshot examples of how they'll copy stats for Blake Griffin and randomly paste it to someone like John Stockton.   It completely turned me off to playing 2K. Why play when the players are completely inaccurate to their real life play style and stats?"
"Depends on what the Sixers lost tbh. But Harris, Harden, Embiid and if they got like Blake Griffin instead they'd be pretty sick. Not sure how Dwight would work with Harden, but i'm sure they'd be cool."
Really their best chance is to bet on JJJ and Ja developing into superstars. Saying they’re in the worst position doesn’t really acknowledge that they at least have 2 very young players who could be great. Worst position was more like that 2018-19 Pistons team with nothing but Drummond and an aging Blake Griffin.
Because your big men are the corpses of deandre jordan and blake griffin.
You and I both know that won’t happen. These are the same people freaking out because Blake Griffin threw down an open rim grazer
Underrated back and forth between Fox and Doncic between who can yell and 1 more after every basket. Doncic still the -150 favorite but don’t count Fox out. You’d think Blake Griffin used to play with either of these guys the way they’re yelling
"Allen and levert are not better than Shamet (who had 30 pts today)/Claxton (whose a lot better defensively than Allen) and brown. Remember, Bruce brown didn’t even get playing time until harden was in Brooklyn. Harden had some of the best role guys in the league like Blake griffin/Bruce brown/shamet.   Even if you filter for Durant without Levert/Harden, His team impact still trumps Hardens.   Just as an exercise I filtered for Durant without Allen and Levert &amp; in 400 minutes his net rating is +9 with a 120 offensive rating, still higher than Hardens. What’s your new excuse for Durant having higher team impact?  https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612751&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=201142,201935,1628386,1627747  Cmon Kd when healthy is the most impactful on the Nets by every metric."
Because y’all starting center is Blake Griffin
Bam has all the tools to get to ADs level he just has to take more shots. Like my guy could’ve literally gave Blake Griffin a heart attack with a 50 bomb they can’t stop him
I just think it’s all very case by case dependent. There are super raw developmental bigs that take years When I think of guys who have been the best from day 1 as rookies the past decade it’s also guys like KAT Blake Griffin and you can put in big ball handlers like Zion and Ben Simmons also.  I largely think we kind of all just do it as a rationalization for a guy who clearly is raw or sucks from day 1. It’s hard not to tbh you want these guys to be good. Sometimes we are right sometimes we aren’t but I don’t think it’s position specific
"&gt;Harden had Miami, Philly  Miami and Philadelphia were never plausible Harden destinations because he's the polar opposite of Miami's culture, and because of Morey.  &gt;Drummond situation was exactly the same as Blake and LA.  The Drummond situation was very similar to Aldridge.  Griffin was a bit different as he obviously quit on Detroit.  &gt;Don't say AD wasn't looking to go to the Lakers from the start...  I literally just quoted Davis' position on his next team, and it's contrary to your inaccurate claim."
"Here's a few more.   Isaiah Stewart is better than James Wiseman.   While Tyrese Haliburton is better currently, Killian Hayes will be better in his prime.   Duncan Robinson's season last year was a fluke. He's still an elite shooter, but hes never going to shoot 46% on 8 threes per game ever again. Probably more like 39-40% (which is still good).   Saddiq Bey is better than Blake Griffin.   If Kawhi Leonard wasn't an MVP candidate playing 78% of the games last season, Embiid shouldn't be an MVP candidate playing 68% of his games.   Donovan Mitchell is the Jazz's best player. It becomes obvious in the playoffs imo.  Curry is more valuable to the Warriors than Harden is to the Nets.   Not all players who put up good numbers on a bad team are empty stats players."
"Deandre Jordan, Bruce Brown, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet isn't insane depth if luckily 2-3 of them even get  a chance to play in the playoffs for over 5 minutes"
I got 2 words for you: Blake Griffin and Amare Stoudemire- must see TV.
Reminds me of the Blake Griffin impersonating sky hook with D.Jordan
"&gt;Everyone thought this game was going to be trash, but holy shit were we wrong. What a fucking game.    Lakers just destroyed the Nets with KD, Kyrie, Lamarcus Aldridge and Blake Griffin playing. Then destroyed the Utah Jazz, number 1 seed in the West  &gt;  All without any LeBron or AD.. Just a team of Kuzma, Caruso, KCP, Drummond and such lol  &gt;   But somehow, they lost to the fuckin Knicks.. I don't even know what to think"
Fuck Blake griffin
If the Grizzlies were in the East they'd have Blake Griffin on a vet minimum.
She got mad at Blake Griffin for not being more spiteful towards the Clippers.
"I believe he means insert almost any player in the league on a max and its bad and on a min its good. Most players aren't on a max so it can still apply with all maxes being good.    Even then a ton of max players being number 1 would be really bad. Most teams with 2nd and 3rd max players are competing for the title and pay them to have the talent. Guys like Tobias Harris, Kemba Walker, Kevin Love, Khris Middleton, Blake Griffin(idk how his contract actually works out right now), Russ, Wall, Lowry, Wiggins, KP, McCollum, and even guys a tier above that such as PG, Conley, and AD. If they are maxed and the number one option your team is wasting money unless they use these signing to attract other stars who are better."
Yeah Aldridge was amazing for them. Big body. Could stretch the floor. Could go off for 20+ on any given night. Could create his own shot.  Even Griffin is still damn solid for a minimum. Can stretch the floor. Good passer. Decent on defense. Just because Blake/Drummond aren’t worth $35 million doesn’t mean they’re bums.
"Very cool, but needs some work. Blake Griffin as 36th highest hustle player? Maybe 4 years ago. Don't get me wrong I love me some Shake &amp; Blake, dude is a very solid player, but he's solid. Slowest &amp; lowest distance travelled in like the top 50. Good defense is unfairly ranking him higher it looks like."
Andre Drummond and Blake Griffin
I mean his competition is a washed Blake Griffin that sits every other game so yea
"Pretty solid list. To add to it, looking at half decades:   PG:   * 80-85: Magic Johnson * 85-90: Magic Johnson * 90-95: John Stockton * 95-00: Gary Payton * 00-05: Jason Kidd * 05-10: Steve Nash * 10-15: Chris Paul * 15-20: Steph Curry  SG:   * 80-85: George Gervin * 85-90: Michael Jordan * 90-95: Michael Jordan * 95-00: Michael Jordan * 00-05: Tracy McGrady * 05-10: Kobe Bryant * 10-15: Kobe Bryant * 15-20: James Harden  SF:   * 80-85: Larry Bird * 85-90: Larry Bird * 90-95: Scottie Pippen * 95-00: Grant Hill * 00-05: Paul Pierce * 05-10: LeBron James * 10-15: LeBron James * 15-20: LeBron James  PF:   * 80-85: honestly real hard, all the great players were either a SF or C. I guess Kevin McHale * 85-90: Charles Barkley * 90-95: Karl Malone * 95-00: Karl Malone * 00-05: Tim Duncan * 05-10: Dirk Nowitzki * 10-15: Blake Griffin * 15-20: Anthony Davis  C:   * 80-85: Moses Malone * 85-90: Hakeem Olajuwon * 90-95: Hakeem Olajuwon * 95-00: Shaq * 00-05: Shaq * 05-10: Tim Duncan (at this point he had moved to center almost exclusively) * 10-15: Dwight Howard * 15-20: Nikola Jokic  In total, players with 3+: MJ and LeBron, players with 2: Duncan, Hakeem, Shaq, Bird, Kobe, Magic."
On some Blake Griffin 2011 rn
Blake griffin has entered the chat.
Seeing baby Trae Young with Blake Griffin does that to me because Blake still feels like he just got drafted to me .
"Here's the answer you're looking for:  You can't regularly order the jersey of every/any player in the NBA. Every team designates 1 or 2 players to make jerseys for to have sent to the big box stores (department stores, footlocker, dicks sporting goods, etc.). So for OKC, the jersey that's available to buy right this second is a SGA jersey. For LAL it would be Lebron and Davis. you get the idea.  Unfortunately for you, because CP3 was traded so late in the season, they had already allocated those premade jerseys to SGA and CP3. You'll have to order any other player's jersey from the manufacturer on the official thunder NBA shop at a slightly higher price (139.99). It's technically custom made and takes a little bit longer.  At least you're not a Detroit fan who never had interest in a Blake Griffin or Derrick Rose jersey."
"Lol calm down dude you don’t need to get that emotional about a comment that was designed to be informative. But just for you, below is a quick list of major injuries dating back to 2015. I'm not even bothering to include every single one just because that would take too much time and this is enough to illustrate the point.   &amp;#x200B;  **2015**  * Kevin Durant foot Jones fracture * Jrue Holiday fractured tibia * Carmelo Anthony knee surgery, patellar tendon * Russell Westbrook surgery broken hand * Chris Bosh blood clots * Dwight Howard knee surgery knee edema * Derrick Rose surgery torn meniscus * Jusuf Nurkic ankle sprain, missed 37 games * Brandon Jennings achilles * Wes Matthews achilles * Julius Randle broken leg * Kemba Walker torn meniscus * Jabari Parker ACL * Paul George broken leg (olympics, missed NBA season)  &amp;#x200B;  **2016**  * Anthony Davis surgery for torn labrum and knee surgery for patellar tendon * Jrue Holiday orbital fracture, surgery * Mike Conley lower back fracture and achilles tendinitis  * Marc Gasol foot fracture, surgery * Eric Bledsoe torn meniscus * Manu Ginobli TESTICULAR SURGERY due to impact * Michael Kidd-Gilchrist shoulder surgery * Blake Griffin torn quad and broken hand * Al Jefferson torn meniscus * Jarrett Jack torn ACL * TJ Warren fracture foot * Eric Gordon surgery broken finger * Joakim Noah dislocated shoulder  &amp;#x200B;  **2017**  * [Fuck it, I'm getting tired of summarizing all this - just watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9EVSvRofOk)  &amp;#x200B;  **2018**  * Hayward broken foot * Cousins achilles * John Wall achilles * Kyrie knee surgery * OG Anunoby torn ACL * Jabari torn ACL * Porzingis torn ACL * Sefolosha torn MCL * Mike Conley left heel surgery * Jeremy Lin ruptured patellar * Dion Waiters severe ankle sprain * Roberson torn patellar * Reggie Jackson severe ankle sprain  Alright I'm stopping there, this became a tired exercise and I don't have it in me to keep going. At this point this should just be a main post."
The Blake Griffin dunks are becoming a meme now
"A Blake Griffin dunk, you already know whats gonna be on the front page of this sub reddit"
"Melo makes sense, deandre and blake griffin were kinda one hit wonders"
Blake Griffin such a flopper lol
"Steph is averaging 5.5 points more than Harden on 4.4% higher TS%. That’s a massive difference.   Harden averages 6 more assists, but that has to be written off in the contexts of their seasons as Steph gets to pass to Oubre (52.8 TS%), Wiggins (56.8 TS%), Draymond (49.8 TS%), and Wiseman (55.2 TS%) while Harden gets to pass to Kyrie (61.9 TS%), Joe Harris (67.1 TS%), Jeff Green (62.2 TS%), Bruce Brown (58.5 TS%), DeAndre Jordan (75.1 TS%), Landry Shamet (57.6 TS%), and sometimes even Kevin Durant (66.5 TS%) and Blake Griffin (62.3 TS%).  Curry has easily been the best guard in the league this year."
"&gt; Blake Griffin and Westbrook were shells of their former selves  That's not really fair, Blake has actually been playing at a fraction of his former ability for a few years now."
Reddit reactions are hilarious. This sub would have you convinced that...  * Blake Griffin and Westbrook were shells of their former selves and couldn't jump/run up and down the court  * Thibs couldn't coach in the modern NBA  * JV is a bastard man   Three things off the top of my head from this season alone lol. I'll wait for a report/statement before I buy whatever people are selling in the comments.
How you gonna claim Blake Griffin is still the same 5 time all star lol
"DAJ, Blake Griffin, Mike James, Reggie Perry, and Cabarot are actual bums, and Shamet is notriously inconsistent. Claxton has been injured really often."
the way people judge Russ for no rings is so fucking dumb. just compare it to the discourse surrounding other players  Russ has 4 WCF appearances and a Finals appearance yet is viewed as “not a winning basketball player”. CP3 has 1 WCF and multiple playoff chokes yet is viewed as a “proven winner” because he “plays the game the right way”. it’s fucking ridiculous   and yes i know Russ finals appearance was playing with KD. CP3 spent years with prime MVP candidate Blake Griffin and MVP James Harden and only has one WCF appearance in his career to show for it  we acknowledge CP3 is a HOF PG and a winning player. why can’t we do the same for russ??
"I mean let’s be honest, how many of us, if we had the same financial security as Blake Griffin, also wouldn’t show up to a shit a job and if I did not give a fuck about it"
"No, he doesn’t.  Very few people are capable of fitting into any offensive system.  Harden IS the system.  He’s not running a motion offense, he’s not running triangle sets.  He’s running pick and rolls and hunting for mismatches.  If he gives up the ball it’s for an immediate shot/layup/dunk or because he got stuck.  When it’s not his “turn” to run the offense he stands at the 3 point line without moving as a “spacer”, which is better than what he did with CP3 and RWB in Houston where he routinely didn’t make it past half court for those possessions and let them play 4v5.  Kevin Durant can fit into any system because he’s capable of moving off ball, hitting set shots, playing iso ball, hitting open players when he attracts too much defensive attention, and playing elite defense.  Harden does not put in a defensive effort and does not move off ball.  If you think a player can fit into any system just because they have a high bbiq, I’ll refer you to Rondo clashing with Rick Carlisle’s system in Dallas.  Rondo is one of the 5 sharpest basketball minds in the NBA, and he was so such a bad fit that he legitimately gave up on his team, embarrassed himself and fucked over his own reputation.  Harden plays well when his floor is spaced by other shooters, especially those who move off ball well, and a good big man for pick and roll screens capable of being a heavy alley oop threat.  He has a geriatric Blake Griffin and DAJ, and the best floor spacer (Joe Harris) is who he replaced in the starting lineup when he got there.  He is not a good fit where he is and he’d be a slightly worse fit with the Warriors.  People are being tricked into thinking it’s an okay fit because, as usual, he’s winning regular season games.  The big 3 over there haven’t played together (literally two games) and they’re expected to roll over the Sixers?  Fit and matchup matter, and I’m glad the dubs didn’t get him.  I’d much rather wait a year and have Klay, who isn’t as good as Harden but a much better fit."

"Regular season.  They match up uniquely poorly against the Sixers and it’s going to be a brutal series for them.  They have also only had 2 games with Kyrie, Harden and KD sharing the court.  They also have negative floor spacing with DAJ, Blake Griffin, and Kyrie/Harden not moving off ball.  They’re going to be trading isos against a team with Simmons and Thybulle at the perimeter and Embiid guarding the rim with in/out defense from Tobias Harris.  Then they have no real defense at the other end and nobody who can stop Embiid from averaging an efficient 40 through a series.  It will be a rude awakening."
"Especially Blake Griffin, fuck him"
You're about to see a LOT of Lakers fans complaining nonstop about the buyout market now that Drummond is trash and Blake Griffin has been sort of productive... I'm sure that'll be the excuse this year
Hmmmmm special can.....lemme guess. What comes in a can that is special....beer obviously but the brewers are baseball....next best would be vienna sausages with the hot sauce that you get at the gas station but thats not an nba team (yet)......third best would be a can of whoop ass...like stone cold steve Austin....who is from Texas....which rhymes with Lexus....which is luxurious just like a Kia...which blake griffin drives BOOM FOUND THE NETS FAN CANT HIDE FROM LOGIC
If Blake Griffin played bad today im happy
Plot twist: this whole conversation was as scripted Blake Griffin winning the 2011 dunk contest
"Slightly unrelated topic, but Blake Griffin absolutely killed his set on Baldwin's roast. His roasts on Caitlyn Jenner and Nikki Glaser were really damn good, his comedic timing is stellar."
Every Blake Griffin dunk will instantly make me think of the Uncle Phil pool scene now for the rest of his career that’s just how it is lol
I literally said that. Harden takes the “others” up a notch or two but they are still effective rn. Even Blake griffin falls under that category rn and he is getting good looks from kyrie
How do I get on the Blake Griffin Join Regeneration Program (BGJRP)™️
WCS tried to finish that lob like he was Blake Griffin
Is Blake Griffin stupid?  He didn't even have control of the ball lmao
"I think he can, and will, improve his 3 point shot. I'm just sick of the narritive that it will radically change his game.   Besides Blake Griffin, no one becomes a jump shooter in a single off season."
"He's played with an MVP winner in Harden and Blake Griffin who has made All-NBA 5 times for half his career. He's been unlucky with injuries and the weird ownership situation that created the trade veto, but let's not act like he's been playing with scrubs his whole career."
[One of the funniest unintended skits that Blake Griffin did in the Mexico game with Luka Doncic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoCHrTh0FQo) Dude is a natural comedian.
"&gt;No you weren't. People don't gain that much more athleticism after their 2nd season.  Oh my lord, what.   [https://www.legitgamblingsites.com/blog/when-do-athletes-begin-to-decline-within-their-sport/](https://www.legitgamblingsites.com/blog/when-do-athletes-begin-to-decline-within-their-sport/)  [https://hoopshype.com/2018/12/31/nba-aging-curve-father-time-prime-lebron-james-decline/](https://hoopshype.com/2018/12/31/nba-aging-curve-father-time-prime-lebron-james-decline/)  Jesus, you just tried a) Denying that the word ceiling was in a sentence and b) Denying science and attempting to argue players hit their physical prime in their 2nd season and don't improve significantly after. That may be one of the most asinine takes I've ever heard. That is on par with anti vaxxing.     &gt;Again, you offered absolutely zero evidence, had no counter to Zion being able to dunk from the free throw line at 280 pounds and can't even keep your own story straight.  Again, you tried denying a literal fact. The word CEILING is in the sentence  ""I'm predicting his future/ceiling""  Jesus.  The problem with this discussion is that we can't argue who is more athletic because it's subjective. It's just unanimously agreed Lebron is more athletic. You want the proof for the unanimous agreement?

You cannot really come to an objective agreement on athleticism, you can only have an opinion. And if we want the best possible answer, we go to the most popular opinion 9 times out of 10. A single dunk does not make Zion more athletic than the guy who is the best player in the league at 36, the greatest player in longevity, perhaps the greatest mix of speed and strength with skill ever, the guy with 8 finals straight, most playoff minutes and points, ect ect. What a pathetically naïve perspective of the human body.     &gt;I can tell you don't know the basics of how to even establish or discuss a point. You're blocked and can now exit my thread.  You tried arguing that the word ceiling wasn't in a sentence containing the word ceiling, and you want to say I can't debate? I wanted to refuse this argument because it's pointless but since you tried riding on your high ground by ""blocking me"" I put some effort into this post to debunk you. I know you didn't block me, by the way, I can tell lmao."
"I'd definitely take Griffin out of that second tier. Genuinely, I would prefer Drew Timme to Blake rn"
"Here’s their likely playoff rotation:   1. KD  2. Harden  3. Kyrie  4. Joe Harris  5. Jeff Green  6. Blake Griffin  7. Claxton  8. DJ  Reserves: Shamet, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, TLC, Chiozza  That’s an all time great rotation."
"I just think the game they played in their era didnt require them to shoot 3s. For example, Brook Lopez and Blake Griffin added 3s to their game. What makes us think Duncan and Garnett wouldn’t have done the same and be successful at it if the game required them to shoot 3s? They are both all time greats."
"Not only have we barely seen the Big 3, but we've never seen the team at full strength overall.  Nicolas Claxton made his season debut after the last game that the Big 3 played together. Blake Griffin signed after that too. Both guys have become key pieces.   So we have yet to see a game where all of KD, Harden, Kyrie, Harris, Claxton, Blake, Green, Shamet, Brown, etc. play.  Like, if Harden was able to play in the last two games and Claxton was able to play more than 5 minutes in one game (coming off of COVID), I think the results may have been much different."
"&gt;you claimed blatantly false stuff and started off by saying guys who shoot 36% on 3 3's a game are ""good"" shooters lol  You: Blake Griffin is a good shooter  Also Blake Griffin: 36.7% on 3.0 attempts  &gt;started off by saying guys who shoot 36% on 3 3's a game are ""good"" shooters lol"
"Yes, 38.8% from 3 is amazing.   You literally put Blake Griffin as a shooter lmao"
"LeBron and Davis probably won’t play. Durant won’t play either if Brooklyn goes on a deep playoff run.   Bam would be great, USA needs all the quality big men they can get.  LOL at Blake Griffin and Victor Oladipo “battling”"
Oladipo in battling but Jrue in no category. Makes zero sense.  Also Blake Griffin in battling lmao.
My gut says they'll trust Blake Griffin and Jeff Green as smallball 5s -- teams love to fall back on VETS! (good or bad) in the playoffs.
And only half of Blake griffin
"3 way tie between Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Andre Drummond"
I don't know how I feel about Zion. He went in the will-be-exciting category like Blake Griffin but will they be MVP type? We'll see on Zion.
"You clearly did not watch the game lmao. Deandre Jordan was fucking awful, Blake Griffin was the one who guarded him well"
It is the best option. You can't double Giannis because he's surrounded with shooters.  Nets just put DAJ and Blake Griffin at center and gave him 10 feet of space.  It worked and he went 10/29.  So there we go. Washington Wizards don't got any Giannis DPOY stopper either. They had Russell Westbrook guarding him.  It's better to put a center and not help off the shooters.
"Nah apparently a back up big man will shore up a bottom 5 defense...   It would take Rudy gobert to cover this teams defensive problems, not washed up Blake griffin and Clax"
You really gonna depend on Blake griffin to score? Lol  No all 3 will not average 30 lmfao.
"&gt; Aside from the big 3 who on their team can they depend on to score enough to matter?  “Aside from two top 5 All-Time scorers and Kyrie, who can they depend on to score?”  You realize they have the #1 offense in the league with KD and Harden missing significant time right?   And honestly yes, there’s a real chance all 3 might average 30.  And to answer your question, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, Blake Griffin"
If Blake Griffin played bad today im happy
Blake Griffin should stick to what he’s good at.. his prank show on TruTV
Blake Griffin has become a joke of a player at this point.
FUCK BLAKE GRIFFIN
Brooklyn's entire goon squad is the corpse of Blake Griffin.  Every other player they have is 100% pure finesse.
"I mean, if you just signed in, you signed in as Blake Griffin flopped for the millionth time in his career, and Bucks fans reacted exactly the same as any fanbase does when faced with that shit.  And when it comes to players flopping against the Bucks over the past 3+ years, I don't think anyone even comes close to the number of times Blake has done it.  In our matchups with the Pistons (when he was actually playing) it was just embarrassing.  A monster of a man flopping harder than the worst of Trae Young/Harden/any other player you can think of who has a reputation for it."
"Don't be surprised (or angry, Nets fans) if you see refs do a makeup call after seeing how Blake Griffin pulled a fast one on them."
"Blake Griffin runs straight into Portis while waving his arms, doesn't get a call, tries it again, gets a call(???), then gets a tech. Bizzare sequence."
Fuck Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin was not fouled.  WTF is that?  He just flailed his arms around until the ref called something.  That's weak.
"Blake Griffin is easily the biggest bitch in the entire nba, the guy does nothing but flop and bitch"
Blake Griffin has a really punchable face and his free throws look stupid
Blake Griffin is garbage dude
The Nets need to take the corpse of Blake Griffin out to the trash
I'd enjoy this game more if the Nets took the corpse of Blake Griffin off the court.
Bobby Portis and Blake Griffin both punched someone in the face.
Blake Griffin wasn’t a Net in January when we first faced The Bucks
Blake Griffin about to go ham
Blake Griffin : am i a joke to you?
"I think he did a hell of a job, when Blake was younger. Depending on what reporting, and when, there's a lot of differing reports from that era, but it seems as Griffin solidified himself the friction grew. I think overall it was pretty well managed."
"Remember during the buyout period when everyone was flipping shit and acting like Blake griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge and Andre Drummond were insane pickups? That was funny."
"We were literally everywhere saying that, none of you fuckers listen to us. It's the same shit with Blake Griffin now where people say we're mad when we're not"
Blake Griffin calling the police on Chris Paul vibes lol
I've also heard he looks like Blake Griffin pre-super soldier serum
"CP3 made Blake Griffin a rich man, DJ too"
Oh man. There are so many things that could happen in the playoffs to make me laugh.  The salty tears I really want is a Blake Griffin FMVP.
Blake griffin reminds me of the villain from the incredibles
"That's fine, I don't care if he gets another ring, I honestly don't care who wins, I just want him to get the FMVP. I don't think they were a super team until harden joined and I don't think Blake griffin made them more of one like people were tryna say."
"Gospel. Preach!  When I first moved to L.A. during his MVP year it was basically Kobe and Rose jerseys everywhere. I probably noticed all of the Rose jerseys because I'm from Chicago, but this was before Kyrie and Steph were even All-Stars. Before Golden State was thought of being next. This was when Blake Griffin was jumping over KIAs. This was Rose hitting the game winning floater over Pau on Christmas Day game at Staples. This was when KD, Westbrook, Harden, and Ibaka were on the the Thunder. Shit, I think Reggie Jackson was still with the Thunder. This was still somewhat old Kanye.   Youngest MVP Ever. D. 🌹   Never Forget."
Blake Griffin
AD or Blake Griffin.
"I could see K Love having sort of a Blake Griffin role on Portland if he was actually in a situation where he cared.  There is absolutely no reason Portland would take on his contract however.  Two more seasons making $28m+.  Only way we do that is if we decide to tank, then he'd be miserable here too."
I'm not saying you are doing it but people here are doing that. the top comment is that his FG is 40% but when it comes to rookie shouldn't it matter how they are playing now rather than 5 months ago?  And rookies are inefficient all the time. So why is he held to an all star standard but other rookies aren't. When was the last time a rookie hit the ground running? Blake Griffin?
There’s a bunch lol:  Howard to lakers   Cousins to Pelicans   GHill to Orlando   Tmac to Houston   Blake Griffin kinda

Fuck you Blake Griffin
Suns Forsure cp3 finally getting a ring would be amazing. He’s honestly one of the best players who has never won. He’s have to get past the clippers and rondo. And then He would be winning over bother Blake griffin and Harden. Pretty badass if you ask me
"Congrats to them, honestly making 9/10 is nothing to sneeze at. Shout out to Blake Griffin for getting things rolling"
"He forreal can just never give Steph anything without it being a backhanded compliment lmao he always tries to defend his Steph takes by starting with ""I picked him NUMBER ONE over Blake Griffin"" then immediately shitting on him after"
"Blake Griffin pretended to be washed so he could get a free welfare ring, change my mind"
Oh look a blake Griffin thread. I wonder how many people are gonna say Pistons fans are gonna be mad about this when they were fucking stoked to be rid of him. The only ones mad are people on behalf of Pistons fans. Pistons fans ain’t mad
Blake Griffin blocking Dirk's fadeaway too
"I just mean that personally there was no point where I actually believed the Blake Griffin we saw in Detroit was the Blake Griffin that we’d see playing for a title favorite. Just like if Kevin Love were bought out and signed by the Lakers a month ago nobody would expect to see the same Kevin Love who misses 90% of games, slaps the ball to the other team for a free 3 pointer, and plays 25 minutes without attempting a single shot like we’ve seen with the Cavs.    Look at Rondo playing for the Mavs compared to Rondo for the Lakers in the playoffs. We’ve seen so many examples of players who truly don’t give a shit on one team and then play like stars when they’re on a playoff team."
"You getting cade, suggs, mobley or green. If you had griffin going full out you'll probably get like a low upside college dude at the 7th-14th pick. Its the other fans that think Detroit is still mad at blake."
I feel you man. I got this feeling in 2011   All under 25 players in 2011   Dwight howard   Cp3   Derrick rose   Kevin durant   Russell westbrook   Kevin love   Andrew Bynum   Rajon Rondo   Brandon Roy   Tyreke evans   Blake Griffin   These guys had me excited for the next decade    The future of the NBA is currently really bright.
[Blake Griffin upon arrival to the nets (Alternate Angle)](https://media.tenor.com/images/490a7c00f79861ad270f39a4da8abfae/tenor.gif)
Stupid question but can I only flair up on desktop? I'm a pistons fan and like to rep the squad. It's funny seeing 90% of these comments on the Blake Griffin dunk about how piston fans are salty as fuck but literally it's every other teams fans making that comment
Just solidifies Blake Griffin is a piece of shit considering he hadn't dunked for about 2 years in Detroit.
they've got to find a better plan than Blake Griffin iso
Everyone who freaked about how adding Blake Griffin broke the league failed to mention Jeff Green who is shooting nearly 40% from 3 and has been a versatile defender. Was a litmus test for who has actually been watching the nets play and who has been freaking out from just reading box scores.
it would of been kind of weird if he said harden considering his injury. More of a slight on Blake Griffin I think who he’s had a history of beefin with
"And that one turnover was (imo) a questionable charge drawn by Blake Griffin, who's made it his life's mission to flop every time he guards Giannis."
Having Blake Griffin guard Giannis is malpractice
"Having Blake griffin be your most prominent Giannis defender isn’t ideal, but the fact that the Nets fought hard despite that and without their second best player is crazy."
Blake Griffin about to be incredibly hated in the playoffs
I hate watching Blake Griffin and Pj Tucker acting like they haven’t fouled anybody in their life when they hack a guy.
Seems like nobody in this thread likes Blake Griffin lol
Yellow card for Blake Griffin
Fuck Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin almost went full Solomon Hill on that one. Simma down
You leave Bruce Brown or Blake Griffin open
"Lol what is this ridiculous comment?  Steph got to the playoffs with his best offensive teammate being Andrew Wiggins. Once Wiseman went down the Warriors had no right making the playoffs  Yet here you are bragging about Harden elevating a roster made up of Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, Joe Harris and generally a much stronger bench than what the Warriors are supporting Steph with  And some people think I'm too harsh when I say this subreddit has to have the lowest sports IQ of any subreddit on this site. This shit you said is just ignorant garbage"
Claxton should start. Blake Griffin is bringing nothing to the table.
blake griffin is so fucking trash.
"No BS. Harden, Kyrie, Durant, Blake Griffin &amp; Joe Harris is the greatest starting five I’ve ever seen. Jesus fuck this will take a miracle."
"These dudes dumb as shit. Nets defense is legitimately suspect as fuck and the Sixers have got the personnel to exploit areas of major weakness.  Celtics without their 2nd best player taking a game off the Nets despite incredible performances by KD and Harden should be an obvious indicator to anyone.  Meanwhile the Bucks just curbstomped the Heat and are looking like a total buzzsaw. I'd take Bucks over Sixers and Nets, and if I'm the Sixers I'd like my chances having my best player matched up against Deandre Jordan/ Blake Griffin than a front court of Brook Lopez &amp; Giannis."
Gave him the Blake griffin special. Ouch
"Yeahhh I am not so sure of that, but I think we exposed two things last game:  - Kyrie is a liability in PNR if they are going to switch everything. In general I think their defensive scheme is a mess/nonexistent, and if you don't turn the ball over I don't think they can stop shit.   - They have no rim protection. I don't follow the Nets closely enough to know if DeAndre Jordan is totally washed or what, but Blake Griffin and Claxton can't cut it defensively. They can grab some rebounds but neither offers much inside of the perimeter.   Tatum was god tier so it didn't really matter what they were trying to do defensively anyways, but if you can get in the paint against them I think they are kind of exposed. Clearly the issue is then keeping them in check offensively, but we got Harris in foul trouble and Kyrie is a mental midget, so Harden and KD going for 80 didn't win them the game. I think today could be interesting but the Celtics have been atrocious guarding the perimeter all year, it's really hard to be too confident."
"How about when it's Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, and Nic Claxton?"
For this season  PG Wall  SG Klay  SF Love  PF Detroit's Blake Griffin   C Al Horford
Especially considering Blake Griffin literally won off the same technicality so it was done even before Simmons.
I like Ja but he has got to stop trying these highlight dunks over people for the sake of his health. Similar players like Westbrook and Blake Griffin who just wanted to dunk on everything have been battling injuries because of it
Important to note: the last two times they played (which was only a couple weeks ago and the bucks won with no harden) brook scored 8 pts and 4 pts while being out scored by Blake Griffin. I once again state: the nets are not even thinking about Lopez
"Brook will leave him wide open like he did bam, if we get beat by Blake Griffin, so be it."
Yeah wrong guy to try that shit on. The only time I've ever seen Middlton mad is when Blake Griffin stepped over Giannis.
"&gt;Even if they don't, I'd say we've shown a decent theory vs the Nets (force iso, attack Harris, Griffin and even Irving) that teams like Milwaukee might be able to get more out of.  Yup. The Nets might be able to score their way out of the big man issue, but at some point, it'll be a factor when you're playing Blake or Claxton vs an Embiid or Giannis."
"They got this wrong but I have to say the call against Blake Griffin was pretty bad too - smart kind of undercuts him, then purposefully tumbled over him 😬"
"Everyone still talks about those guys. There’s 3 posts about CP3 complaining about refs in the last two days. Blake Griffin has been injured trash for a season and a half. Lance is out of the league. Pierce is clowned even to his analyst days on a regular basis. He’s both now out of the league and out of the spotlight. Austin Rivers has completely changed his overall media presence and has recently only preached about being humbled during his unsigned / cut periods. Pat Bev has been shit on from Houston to LA, and has never stopped. PG has been clowned in OKC for every stupid ass statement he’s said including calling Dames shot a “bad shot”. Unfortunately he brought that garbage with him to LA and has continued that general pattern of not giving opposing teams due and downplaying their game.  Seems like you face an inverted bias, smart guy. Whiny players are always clowned and hated. As an example, R/NBA hated Houston with Pat Bev, CP3, Hitler Harden. Same principle. Now that they’re gone, no one hates Houston."
"There are examples of teams doing a solid for non-stars.  Why do you think 40 year old Udonis Haslem is still on the Heat rooster?   Ex-Laker's big, Marc Gasol, gets a cushy job as Laker's ""development coach"".  I'm expecting the something similar will happen for Kevon Looney for playing through the playoffs with a broken collarbone. Which led to permanent nerve damage.  It's funny, this year they're not even trying to be subtle. They're straight up buying out contracts and letting players go where they want.  Cavs did Andre Drummond a solid. Pistons did Blake Griffin a solid. Spurs did Lamarcus Aldridge a solid."
Yea but blake griffin was a +16 so who's really better
Blake Griffin baybeeeeee
"I don’t think their roster is shallow at all. They have great roll players  Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Nick Claxton, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet  Hard to ask for more than that"
"Yeah I’ll be the first to call Smart out when he does a crazy flop, like the front flip he did over Blake Griffin, but that wasn’t a flop."
I don’t think ppl are talking about Jeff Green being out enough. Without him the Nets legitimately only have 5 players who are playable in the playoffs and one of them is Blake Griffin who was a corpse three months ago.
"FUCK KYRIE, FUCK KD, FUCK BLAKE GRIFFIN, FUCK THE REFS, AND FUCK THE HOUSTON ASTROS"
"Blake griffin, dinwiddie, Joe Harris, shamet, Jordan, Claxton - that's a good supporting cast. But okay"
Dirty ass play on blake griffin and theyre not saying a word
That Blake Griffin or Kelly Olynyk? Dirty ass move.
Blake Griffin is such a bitch.
Blake Griffin looking like Enes Kanter out there on D
The Celtics no quit mentality is really just TT playing against a team with Blake griffin at center
Never forget this sub saw Blake Griffin make a few dunks in the regular season and tried to act like he was still at a superstar level 😭
Blake Griffin just clocked KD with his forearm oof.
"""Blake Griffin can also do stuff"" lmao"
"Toppin is bizarrely hyperathletic and not athletic at all, he shuffles around like he's a 7 footer yet can dunk like he's prime Blake Griffin.  What a weird player"
Nets have blake Griffin for 1.2M.  I think that the suns have payne for 2M for 2 years. And rivers was signed ths year.  My head hurts and i cant finish typing.
Another way of saying this is Blake Griffin and Chris Paul won playoff games in Staples center more recently than Kawhi has.
"IIRC, Blake Griffin didn't become the flopper I saw at Lob City until CP3 was on the team."
Would have been Jeff Green. They might try Blake Griffin for some time to not sacrifice KD
"pack the paint with who lol, they're literally starting Blake Griffin at the 5"
As a Nets fan it’s a bit different.   Nets didn’t put their “Big 3” together until Mid-Season.   The Nets had 3 open Roster Spots created by the Harden trade they needed to fill with players that all 32 teams decided not to sign in the Offseason.   You add in Dinwiddie’s injury and the Nets essentially lost their entire 2nd Unit between Trade and Injury.   At one point the Nets roster looked really good when they had Aldridge and Griffin. Once they lost Aldridge to retirement it became Blake and 2 random guys in Alize Johnson and Mike Johnson.   This offseason Nets should have the 2yr/$7.4m Bi-Annual Exception as well as the 3y/$18m to fill out their roster.   Dinwiddie could also provide them with some Cap Space if he agrees to a Sign and Trade to create a Trade Exception similar to Hayward in Boston.   That would open up the market for Dinwiddie while also providing the Nets with a way to fill out their roster while being capped out.   If the Nets were running out this roster it would be different.   * Kyrie - Dinwiddie    * Harden - Brown   * Harris - Shamet    * Durant - Griffin   * Aldridge - Claxton
"lob city was pretty easy to hate on, cp3/blake griffin, no further explanation needed.  then the whole donald sterling shit happened.  slowed down a little bit with balmer...then you got the current situation. reasonable, really.  and any team with a semblance of relevancy gets hate. imagine being the kings."
"eh, I don't think the Nets need it. Irving and KD are solid enough playmakers. Blake Griffin is also a great passer for a PF and could fill if they needed someone to run the offense through with the second unit. plus the Nets would be getting Leonard who is pretty capable passing once teams over commit to him. Passing would not be an issue on the Nets at all.  meanwhile I think Harden would greatly improve the Clippers offense. but their defense is the problem right now anyways. maybe Paul George and the others could focus more on defense if Harden was dominating the offense."
As long as he throws off one of the big 3 that’s fine. But if we get beat because Blake Griffin scores 20/10 each game then we deserve to lose.
"\^ this exactly. Nets dont give a shif if giannis or embiid pops off, they are still gonna outscore them. They are just messing around with the celtics rn, I mean did y'all watch those blake griffin dunks."
"DeAndre Jordan is out of the rotation, Nets centers are Blake Griffin, Jeff Green (who will probably miss a good chunk of the series if not all of it), and Nic Claxton."
"Draymond Green (Shaq), Blake Griffin (Chuck), Kyle Lowry (Kenny)"
Blake griffin or CP3
"Wouldn't it be Blake Griffin? He seems to be the strongest built of everybody on that team. (In the sense of ""being able to stop Giannis from powering his way into the paint every possession"")"
Blake Griffin and Josh Smith.
"Blake Griffin, Mike Dunleavy Jr., Kelly Olynyk, Goran Dragic, Mo Wagner"
"cp3 had a prime blake Griffin along with deandre jordan, he choked in the playoffs. also had prime james harden but fell to injuries like always. PG didnt necessarily have the best team out of the 3 but he definitely played in a weak ass east"
"I want to say Blake Griffin but Elton Brand actually has higher VORP, Win Shares, and Win Shares per 48."
Are we talking the Blake Griffin incident or something else?
Maybe because some fat white 5’8 dude knows he has no chance against blake fucking griffin and has no choice but to laugh it off
"It’s is not okay, but you’re clearly using the Blake Griffin doing it in jest as an extremely false equivalent. Those situations aren’t comparable, the fan laughed at Blake doing it. Russell Westbrook wanted to put that fan in the hospital."
"They're going to be leaning much harder on Nic Claxton; DJ is catching ""DNP — CD""s, and if the plan is more minutes for Blake Griffin, I think the Bucks would be very enthusiastic about that development."
"I dunno man. It’s hit and miss in both eras. Plus that’s really just recency bias. I go down the list and know most of them cause I watched basketball then.  3s in 2000s - Harden, Horford, Derron Williams, Ben Gordon, Melo, Pau Gasol  There were a lot of misses at # 2 tho. Gotta give you that. Besides Durant it’s a lot of nothing. Same up until 2015 really. That 2 pick is fucking rough.  And some of the 1 picks flamed out. Kwame Brown, Greg Oden, Bargnani.   But the good 1 picks you still had Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Dwight Howard, Yao Ming, Lebron and Kenyon Martin wasn’t bad.   A few of the ones we think are good now from the late 2010s will inevitably get injured in the next 3-4 years and flame out too. Happens to a lot of players. Then we’ll have the same “who was that guy” posts in 2030 because they only had 3-5 decent seasons."
I suppose you also want Blake Griffin to do jail time for dumping water on a fan?
"Yeah I mean. He’s not even a top 20 flopper in my opinion. Luka, the entire Lakers team, Harden, Beal, CP3, Blake Griffin, Kemba, Lowry, probably Jokic all have him beat by a decent margin."
Blake Griffin first option as the water boy maybe
DRose 🤝 Blake Griffin    Succeeding on playoff teams in New York after leaving Detroit
Only if they charge Blake Griffin for the water thing
Dude...  Overall?  The warriors were prob better.   But there's never been an offense like this.  Period.    Steph is NOT light-years better than Harden...  That's just dumb..  And Klay/Kyrie is a tossup.  Harris is pretty amazing tho.  Plus add Blake Griffin?  Idk bro.  Stupid fucking offense
"It’s taught now, a part of the offense. Defender gets close enough, slight contact or potential contact, react, if you have the ball then attempt a nonsensical shot, and get your call. If you see Blake Griffin, he’s a master of it. Wild."
Jason Kidd is mixed technically so idk. Definitely lands white of the Blake Griffin line though.
He elbowed that one guy Blake Griffin style this season.  He does that to someone’s fav player and starts winning in the post season I could see a villain arc for Zion starting
&gt; Blake Griffin was really popular in LA during that time.  [Oh really?](https://youtu.be/Baep6_rVU9M)
"This makes no sense. If someone grew up with the 2000s Clippers or Lob city Clippers, maybe, just maybe they appreciated what they saw, became fans and chose to stay loyal to them. Everyone has there own reasons but most importantly   Everyone isn’t interested in jumping on a bandwagon just because a team is Uber successful. That’s called bandwagoners. Some people like the Under dog. I’m a fan of a little brother team myself and didn’t care about the Knicks just because they were more popular. The Nets had players and a brand of basketball I liked, so I would know.  And in case you don’t know, lob city was the only show in town for a couple of years actually. Mid 2010s Lakers/towards the end of Kobe’s career were a circus and Blake Griffin was really popular in LA during that time."
"Imagine being dumb enough to think having injured Wade &amp; Bosh is anyway comparable to having Steph, Klay &amp; Draymond then Harden &amp; Kyrie as well as a still effective Blake Griffin"
What role players? Their other two starters are fucking Joe Harris and Blake Griffin. Does anyone look out of rhythm when you watch them play? They get both those guys consistent buckets. James Harden is a near-Klay level shooter and is just significantly better at everything else on offense. Just having them in the same conversation is insulting to Harden.
"You keep missing the point  They’re a well ran organization and have had competitive teams for most of the last decade.   Them not being feared or not winning rings doesn’t change anything I’m saying. They haven’t been a joke franchise since before Blake griffin.  Warriors were seen as a joke franchise too but now they’re not. Even if they didn’t win any rings in the last 6 years, they’d still be seen as a well ran organization."
fuck lob city grit n grind for life. let’s all go watch mixtapes of zbo beating the shit out of blake griffin to heal the damage caused by that comment
Ahhh ye olde Blake Griffin extensionarooooo
"It’s not Blake Griffin, it’s the Nets’ five-out offense."
i know man! i forgot they had blake griffin and i was like dam!
Yeah imagine him playing with like a Prime Blake Griffin or something. The lobs would be insane.
"There’s a good chance, but I wouldn’t count out the Sixers beating the Bucks if the Bucks can beat the Nets.   Just matchup-wise, Embiid can guard Giannis well, but against the Nets, he’s guarding Blake Griffin who is just going to stand at the three point-line and keep him from being able to protect the rim. He’ll get it back on the other end, but 76ers offense isn’t potent enough. They need their defense to be dominant and I don’t think it’s possible against the Nets."
"&gt;The Blake Griffin acquisition is wild with how he looked in Detroit (people saying he has to retire)  I legitimately thought he was on the brink of retirement, his legs were gone, he literally couldn’t do anything offensively or defensively. Turns out he’s just Fake Griffin :)"
"For real. I they kept saying big 3. And I'm like how about big 10?! In fact Harden is so good on the offensive end he can play with any other 4 players and drain you. Oh, you adjust for Harden, well let's just sub that team out and throw in KD, KE, and a top spot up shooter. Oh. And in case you forgot they have Blake Griffin and DJ on backup."
MLK  GANDHI  THE DOS EQUIS GUY  BLAKE GRIFFIN
he is gonna be one of those players that you want to watch every game he plays because you know that kind of explosiveness is rare and doesn't last very long. Reminds me a lot of blake griffin.
The fact that a 6x NBA All Star in Blake Griffin doesn't even get mentioned in the post of how OP they are tells you how OP they are.
In an alternate universe we get along as poverty franchises but Blake Griffin and Chris Paul set us down a path of relishing in their demise.
"Yup  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ljgmob/post_game_thread_the_brooklyn_nets_1612_defeat/gnchlpb/  All the people clamoring about their defense as if it was gonna be the worst the playoffs have ever seen are idiots.  That comment was back in February and they only played a couple more games together after that. So ridiculous that people throwing out all these judgements about a team who didn't give a fuck about defense, had two injured stars taking time, and a flat-earther who kept taking personal leave  No team with 3 bona fide superstars + Blake Griffin and Joe Harris is going to be anything but frightening as fuck in the playoffs, when the veteran stars turn on the intensity and are actually playing together.  The Nets are surprisingly deep. The Blake Griffin acquisition is wild with how he looked in Detroit (people saying he has to retire) compared to now. You got players like Shamet, Jeff Green, Claxton all contributing off the bench at a level you'd think would make them a starter on a ""3 superstars + trash"" type team that people were expecting. Even players like Tyler Johnson, Mike James, and Cabarrot looked good at times last year, and they're fighting to just see the court at all with how deep the Nets are."
Does that make Blake Griffin birdman?
"Poor kd went from westbrook and harden to just westbrook, ibaka and adams to curry, klay, dray, iggy to kyrie, harden, harris and blake griffin.  Has anyone played with more talent than kd? I mean holy."
"Yeah imagine being the LA franchise that's had a winning record for 10 straight seasons (the longest active streak in the league) and several All-Stars (Blake Griffin x5, Chris Paul x5, DeAndre Jordan, Kawhi Leonard x2, Paul George) and 6MOY winners (Jamal Crawford x2, Lou Williams x2, Montrezl Harrell) ...  Yet has never made it to the conference finals and sadly plays second fiddle to the other LA team that had six straight losing seasons over the same timespan.  Just brutal."
"He tried to drag Kemba down too, fuck blake griffin no.1 most punchable face in the league"
"I'll root for the nets when they're the underdog like the other year they made a run with DLo, but when you get three superstars and Blake Griffin (and even aldridge until his sudden retirement) to try to buy rings, fuck that team."
For real. People think Blake Griffin on the nets = BG on the pistons. Not true at all. dude put his body on the line to get to and in the playoffs. Hard to get a clear lane to the hoop when you are the number one option compared to the 4th/5th option.
"Blake ""Dunks"" Griffin!"
"What about DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin and Joe Harris?"
"No one in 2021 can dunk better than Blake ""Dunks"" Griffin!"
I get people love to see Blake Griffin dunking. But even his dunks are clearly a complete shell of his former self. The explosion just isn't there. He's just a 6'9 dude throwing it down at this point.
"That is basically the big story on Blake Griffin. He played a lot of games for Detroit and didn't dunk *once* for over a full season. He gave such little effort and was such a negative to the team that the Pistons bought him out of his huge contract.  Then he signed with Brooklyn and in his first or second game, he dunked. And now he dunks a decent amount and people debate if he was playing the Pistons into cutting him or if he is actually so washed that he can only dunk in certain situations.  Either way I think it's clear he did not give a signle fuck in Detroit and now he does care."
"Forget 9/11, investigate Blake Griffin"
My issue is more the trio of unlikable stars on the Nets. Throw in Blake Griffin and I almost would rather the Lakers win it than the Nets.
"Are we REALLY still doing this? Blake Griffin was not ""mailing it in"" on Detroit. There's a big difference being a bench player with great spacing and being a 30+ minute first option with no spacing and extra defensive attention that didn't let him easily get to the rim."
This is an absolutely bizarre player comparison. Who gives a shit how Blake Griffin did compared to Tatum
Blake Griffin is a baby back bitch
Fuck Blake griffin
"lmao fuck Blake Griffin, floppin ass."
Blake Griffin tries to draw charges more often than he actually plays defense
Blake Griffin always ends up on the ground
Harden really dribbled in a circle just to pass it to Blake Griffin at the 3 line with a couple seconds on the shot clock... Tf was he thinking
Anyone else see Blake Griffin fall over for no reason right before that Giannis 3?
"If you asked Blake Griffin to cut off his own hand in order to win this game, he’d ask which one."
Y’all ever seen Blake Griffin on Broad City? Dude’s a freak.
"After seeing Embiid fall all over the floor yesterday, I have zero desire to see Blake Griffin fall all over the floor tonight."
The weird thing about Blake Griffin is that when he fouls it doesn't get called
Blake Griffin is a bitch.
"Blake Griffin and Chris Paul are still killing the league, same as it ever was"
"Ah yes, the Brooklyn Nets Big 3  Jeff Green, Kevin Durant, and ~~Blake Griffin~~ Jeff Green"
I swear if the nets win because Jeff green and Blake griffin can’t miss a three I’ll be pissed
"My god Blake griffin is a shadow of his former self. So average, so boring, so impactless."
This is fucking non sense. Jeff Green and Blake Griffin think they’re Klay all of sudden. Only reason Nets are alive.
"Blake Griffin, the light skinned curry"
I bet Joe Harris is really nervous that BLAKE GRIFFIN of all people is beating him at his own job.
their best player is blake griffin lmao
Blake griffin in 2021 is just a mediocre spot up shooter. That’s just insanity lol
Me in game one: “I can live with Blake Griffin threes”  Me in game five: “NoOoO not that guy!!”
Jeff Green and Blake Griffin were the real superteam all along.
Definitely rooting for the Bucks but I love Blake Griffin. He’s the Blake of the Year! BOTY!
I've been watching this game for 30 seconds and already seen Blake griffin flop twice! Thankfully they aren't rewarding hime.
I don't give a shit about the nets but this Blake Griffin come back tour has been fun as hell to watch this year.
Kevin Durant - 50 pts  Jeff Green - 40 points  Blake Griffin  - 10 points  James Harden - 1 free throw  &amp;#x200B;  Final score: Nets 101 - 100 Bucks  Harden MVP
Blake Green- the love child of Blake Griffin and Jeff Green
"New Nets Big 3: Kevin Durant, Jeff Green, Blake Griffin"
"Who'd have thought that teaming up with Kyrie, Harden, Blake Griffin and DJ would have been the hardest road all along?"
Blake Griffin is a over delicate flower
time for every highlight account to post blake griffin diving for the ball again
Tim Duncan  Blake Griffin  Giannis  Garnet  LA  Davis
Lmao Blake griffin pretending he gets hit everytime because he has no chance of stopping Giannis
Blake Griffin tricked yall. Sorry Detroit
Wtf is wrong with Blake Griffin? Man up and take those shoves like a PF you are.
Blake Griffin complains for offensive fouls on Giannis like most players complain for defensive fouls.
Blake griffin should’ve been called for a flop there
Blake Griffin always does this thing where he seems shot by a sniper at the slightest hint of incidental contact.
Fuck Blake Griffin
I honestly don’t mind the Nets I just really don’t fucking like Blake Griffin. What a dickhead
Blake griffin didn’t even attempt to play actual defense on that last possession..immediately went to fake contact
"Blake Griffin is the biggest pussy in the NBA, change my mind."
Giannis just smoked Blake Griffin
Nets hanging around in this game primarily thanks to the reanimated corpse of Blake Griffin. Dr Frankenstein's best work yet.
"Griffin shoots his off arm out on the dunk trying to find a defender to push off on, but he couldn't quite reach... It's just not a signature Blake Griffin dunk if he doesn't push off someone's shoulder.."
"Hey Pistons fans, what yall feel when Blake Griffin dunks?"
Blake Griffin and getting booted in the second round  Tale as old as time
Blake griffin actually needs to be arrested
Blake Griffin shameless as hell taking charges on a guard instead of just trying to play defense
Blake Griffin pretending to be terrible in Detroit just to lose on a superteam brings me great joy.
Do you think the nets thought they’d be relying on Jeff Green and Blake griffin to help KD when this season started
Blake Griffin nearly poked his eye out (no foul despite all the blood) and he opted for glue and bandage rather than stitches
one of the most healthy and fit players for Nets has been..... (checks notes).....Blake Griffin.
hand down man down blake griffin
"Blake Griffin wouldn’t have made a difference? They were down by 14 with 19 minutes left when Blake went out. He was the best defender on giannis that game, he’s also a freaking starter so yeah he would make a difference. THEY WERE DOWN BY 4 HALFWAY THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER WHEN THEIR ALL STAR POINT GUARD GOT INJURED.  The fuck are you talking about lol. An all star point guard leaves the game in the second quarter with an injury when they’re down by 4 and you’re over here saying he wouldn’t have made a difference? What the fuck are you smoking"
"Alright guys, I know the Nets are down by 14 right now, but you have to remember, Chuck guaranteed a Bucks victory, so Nets are winning by 20 following 60 points by Blake Griffin"
Former nba mvp is turning down 1v1 matchups v Blake griffin to give Forbes contested mid range jumper. Fuck sake
Anyone seen Blake Griffin play clean basketball? Can't find any videos.
People really thought Blake Griffin would be a factor this series after 1 game lmao
Do Nets fans just literally not see what Blake Griffin does?  I don't understand.
Blake Griffin wasted no time going from star super athlete to crafty old guy with some bullshit in his game.
"Fuck Blake Griffin , always dirty plays"
fuck you! blake griffin is tiiight
Fuck Blake Griffin how can anyone like this guy
Blake griffin is a dirty piece of shit
Blake Griffin is such a bitch.
"It took Blake Griffin like 3 summers of constant shooting with that shooting coach to get to league average, and he was about a 70% FT shooter to begin with. Simmons shit is so busted that it's just not going to happen"
Blake Griffin fould KD and KD gets free throws?
Wow crafty little bitch Blake Griffin
Man I fucking hate Blake Griffin
I don’t like Blake Griffin
Blake griffin always pulling shit on Giannis
Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are weirdly important for this team
"I made this point earlier:   &gt;Season- or series-derailing injuries happen to multiple teams every season.   Which is what I am talking about when it comes to risk that I think you are ignoring. We've seen it happen this year, we saw it happen to the Heat in last years' Finals, we saw it happen to Golden State in 2019, the Cavs in 2015, etc. To not plan for injuries through the playoffs these days is a choice. And I agree with you that the Nets can't be expected to win through the whole playoffs with all of these injuries, but most championship teams withstand some downswings throughout 2 months of the Playoffs. Harden isn't even expected out long-term (and a healthy Kyrie was around for 3.25 games against the Bucks).  The Nets aren't being asked to win the entire NBA Playoffs down two starters. They are being asked to win one game without two starters to buy themselves some time for Kyrie or Harden to recover (and lo and behold, Harden is likely back for Game 5).  For example, GSW, Miami, and the Cavs all battled injuries to win a game or two to extend the series. It's possible to win a game to extend a series down multiple starters. Overall, though, championship-caliber teams can't just expect to get through the NBA playoffs unscathed.   The Nets chose to use a ton of assets to get Harden (agreed he provided superstar insurance against injury-concerns for Durant &amp; Kyrie). In doing so, the Nets made a trade-off towards superstars and away from depth. That's a great deal! Nothing wrong with that and I think most folks make that deal. But, as Zach Lowe has mentioned this multiple times on his podcast: it was a trade-off to ensure they would have at least 2 superstars in case of injuries (which is exactly what has occurred) at the expense of depth and other usages of their assets. But this wasn't a trade to go to 'no risk' this is literally two different forms of risk... and they are attempting to manage it. I think its useful to point out that both Levert and Allen would be playing meaningful minutes in this series. I think its also useful to point out that the Bucks are also without a starter (DiVincenzo).  Furthermore, using their assets for Harden precluded them from using those assets in other deals (what about using those draft picks/swaps to go after two high-quality starters and keeping Allen or Levert?). What if, instead of making their top-3 players the best in the league, they had tried to make their 3-7 the best in the league? Again, they chose what they chose but what I am saying is that the Nets made a choice to rely on guys like Blake Griffin or Spencer Dinwiddie, and this really reduced their ability to withstand multiple injuries to players that have known injury risks (outside of Harden).  I cannot think of a better analogy than portfolios when it comes to managing teams and risks.   &gt;It’s insane to argue otherwise.       Then clearly I am insane and no team has ever surmounted injuries to extend their playoff chances..."
This entire series has ruined what little respect I had left for Blake Griffin. Like he just seems to resort to trying to shove late or some other borderline dirty play.
Blake Griffin is the Patrick Beverly of Carmelo Anthonys
2010 Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin with a wild flop
Blake Griffin plays so dirty. Washed up hack
why does blake griffin act like that
Blake Griffin: ima drive to the basket  Steve Nash: NAW let’s not do that
"Why doesn’t he hire a track coach, didn’t Blake griffin does this a while back to help with his speed and lateral quickness. I know the injury set him back athletically but I’d think a good offseason of track short distance training would really do him good"
"Yeah, lots of shortage. Some in due in part to increased demand but a lot due to cancelled orders and production cuts at the beginning of the pandemic. Everyone made massive cuts thinking it was the end of the economy but then things picked up and we haven't caught up again.  I can't speak to the debate of ""normal demand"" vs ""shortages"" though. I just know that production issues are significant.     BTW I love the random economics sub thread in this NBA post. Blake Griffin would be proud I'm sure."
They got eliminated because of injuries and you want them to get Blake Griffin? Wut?
"They all out, even Blake Griffin is out. This is the price you pay when you become so greedy . The bb gods are disturbed."
He doesn't even need to hit jumpers. Just be like the old Blake Griffin. There's no reason why he can't be a mix between Westbrook and Griffin. Just be more aggressive.
"He'd play better than Blake Griffin, that's for sure.  Seems like he was helping facilitate the offense while being able to show flashes of his former self."
"Hi, Russell Wager from Kia here. I'd like to discuss buying the rights to your comment to alter for use in a future commercial featuring Blake Griffin and the exciting upcoming all-new Kia pickup truck, which will be the Telluride with the top back quarter chainsawed off.  Go Nets!"
"Blake Griffin was never a luxury pickup, but you know what is? The Ford F-150. I'm not getting paid to say that either.      (Contact your local Ford dealership today.)"
&gt;Why don’t people bring up the fact that the Clippers did Blake Griffin dirty?  $$$$$$$$  Also there have been a shit ton of threads after Blake got traded on this subreddit lol. They literally mentioned how LAC did him dirty.
"I don’t understand the logic right now. The nets are not in a win now situation.  They retain the following players for the next 2 seasons: - Kyrie Irving - Kevin Durant - James Harden - Joe Harris  They have the following under contract for next season: - Spencer Dinwiddie  - DeAndre Jordan - Landry Shamet - Nicholas Claxton - Alize Johnson  They potentially lose: - Blake Griffin (Starter minutes) - Bruce Brown (Bench/Starter minutes) - Jeff Green (bench/starter minutes) - Mike James (Bench Minutes) - Reggie Perry (Reserve) - Timothe LC (Reserve) - Tyler Johnson (Reserve)  Most of the expiring contracts are Minimum contracts or the MLE. The nets are in an ok spot going into next season, and they don’t need starter minutes they need decent or even meh bench minutes. They’ll be able to attract ring chasers. This is not a win or bust season. Keep James Harden healthy.  Even though I may be biased as a bucks fan it’s illogical to push someone injured to play, like a lot of nets fans are. Getting AD this season and KD from 2019 vibes."
Prime Blake Griffin was better than that version of Shaq
"Man I don't know. It looks better as in Yuta gets absolutely destroyed and lands on his back. But Edwards' dunk is a ""Blake Griffin""-dunk as in his arm goes up and he basically hits Yuta in the face.   Kawhi goes up, his left arm flexed in the elbow and hammers it over.  Both absolutely awesome though!"
"&gt;But he didn’t do so in the first year of his contract  A contract is a promise for the entire term of the contract. It's not any more of a promise in year 1/5 than it is in year 4/5.  And what PG did pales in comparison to what Blake Griffin or Vince Carter did - ie, purposely sandbagging to get away from their teams - but they don't catch anywhere near the same flak for breaking their respective contract promises."
"If Blake griffin has the best game of his career, the bucks are gonna get stomped"
This will be the first time Blake Griffin defeats the bucks in a best of 7 series?
"Has there been any word on Blake griffin? He’s been solid this series, but didn’t play to end the last game. Seemed like he might be banged up as well"
"Wardell has one of the best 2p% better than Kyrie for a midget. Go look at 2p% rank and he’s like the shortest dude in the top  Edit: career 52% at 2 points, neck-to-neck with Blake fucking Griffin"
"Yes because KD, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green and Joe Harris are irrelevant NBA players"
"&gt; 2017- ok no injuries  It would not have mattered much, but Blake Griffin was out for most of the first round series with the Jazz.  The Clippers would have made the GSW work a little harder."
"Lol fair point, I just dislike Blake Griffin and don’t think highly of him. Purely as a player though, he’s just a dude"
"I strongly dislike Blake Griffin because he’s a loser. He was a loser with the Lob City Clippers, he was a loser with the Pistons, and he’s a loser with the Nets. He’s done nothing in his career but lose"
"&gt;So what? Paul George, Jermaine O'Neal, Blake Griffin, and Alonzo Mourning all finished 3rd for MVP too.  ...and they're all better than Andre Iguodala."
Sounds like Blake Griffin in Detroit.
"So what? Paul George, Jermaine O'Neal, Blake Griffin, and Alonzo Mourning all finished 3rd for MVP too.  So in Scotties absolute best year he was basically PG-13 (although he never had a year as good as 2019 PG). He's nowhere near a top 25 all time player or on the level a lot of people put him.  The other claim of leading his team to a second round exit that year. Does no one realize that literally 8 players do that every year. Like DeMar DeRozan and Donovan Mitchell have led their teams as far as Scottie did as a first option.  It's just strange to me that when people claim Scottie is overrated nowadays, everyone retorts with this 1994 season which doesn't do anything other than prove that his absolute peak was a nothing special."
60 wins in 3 years will do that on a team not trying to win. Same situation Blake Griffin was in. Go watch Griffin on the Pistons if you want to see a player truly not give a fuck on the court.
"Harden was playing on 1.25 hamstrings and could barely play defense. The Nets 2nd best player on both ends was a washed Blake Griffin, Steph had it better than that."
"Because Blake Griffin's buyout was part of a mutual deal between Griffin and the Pistons. Griffin could have chosen to sit on the bench and taken the remainder of his contract.   On the other hand, you have a John Wall-type situation where there is no way Wall is going to ask to be released from his massive contract. So if a team is obligated to pay for a player, why shouldn't that player be obligated to play for that team."
"He would’ve quickly become a starter the season before CP3 arrived, but yeah maybe he needed someone like Granger to learn the game. That team would’ve been: Baron Davis / Bledsoe / Mo Williams Eric Gordon / Rasual Butler (RIP) PG / Ryan Gomes Blake Griffin / Craig Smith Kaman / DJ"
Just not true at all but ok. Giannis also received single coverage the entire series against Blake griffin by your logic
Think he still has all the Oklahoma high school records despite Blake griffin and trae playing there
"JC is amazing and deserves that max contract. This is a decision that will impact the years to come. He's like a combination of Prime and recent Blake Griffin, dunks amazingly and has  good shooting!"
" https://www.espn.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/10703270/los-angeles-clippers-coach-doc-rivers-says-team-needs-more-trust-espn-magazine    &gt; “I think Chris realized last year in the playoffs, holding the ball, getting double-teamed, getting down to late shot clocks every time, you’re not going to win that way,” Rivers says. “Movement, quick decisions, pulling it and swinging it and trusting the pass — that makes Chris impossible to guard. And I think he realizes it now.”  &gt; When Paul was sidelined with a shoulder injury for 18 games in January and February, Rivers urged him to consider giving up the ball even earlier, while still in the backcourt. Paul smiles thinking about the term Rivers used: the hockey assist. “Sometimes it’s about the pass that leads to the pass,” says Paul, a seven-time All-Star who was averaging 18.8 points and 10.9 assists through March 25. “It’s been fun, passing the ball ahead to Blake (Griffin), letting him push it and make plays. It’s not always about the assist.”"
Why should a player be liable to fulfill his terms of a contract if a team can Blake Griffin him?
pistons putting blake griffin w andre drummond and reggie jackson. reggie jackson never played a healthy season w the pistons after 2016 why would svg do us bold like that and put blake next to him and andre.
"I’ll never forget the first year I followed basketball. 14/15 season. I decided to be a Clipper’s fan. They went up 3-0 on the Rockets. “Harden aint shit” I said. “Clips in 4” I said.  Where I live, western conference games start late and I was having to get up early, so I couldn’t really watch the games. I would wake up and check the results, first thing. I was so excited to wake up and see that LA had won and Blake Griffin, my new best friend, would get to abuse his athleticism for yet another round of the playoffs. But it never came.  Four times I woke. Four times I wept. I didn’t know enough about the sport to know who was at fault for this and honestly I still don’t but if you told me right now to blame Doc Rivers I would write him an e-mailing detailing my disappointment."
"It has to be the pistons effect, (see Blake Griffin)"
"I don’t think many of these have a ton of predictive value for Michael Porter Jr  I also dislike using 2nd year stats. Guys who miss year 1 with an injury tend not to have the same type of developmental curves.  Just look at Simmons, Embiid and Blake Griffin. Their curves are all way flatter than any of the listed wings.  That said, he’s young, still kinda raw and very good. Just don’t think ascribing the improvement of others to him is particularly useful."
In summary: Blake Griffin is ass.
Derrick Rose  Vince Carter  Jason Kidd  Blake Griffin
"Somewhat but not based on the draft comparisons. Almost everyone is compared to someone far above their potential. Griffin had a ton more hype than Gordon, being a number one pick. Gordon had Griffin's hops (and some other skills) but Blake Griffin was a force. Gordon has more disappointed based on some of his early development. Also because he's trapped in the NBA no-man's-land of too good to just be a role player but not good enough to be a star."
I was expecting Blake Griffin level play by now. Not current Blake Griffin though.. lol
ya he was like blake griffin
No. That's because he went to Detroit. Look how Pistons legend Blake Griffin played this playoffs.
Blake Griffin died for this
"Fucking hell, ZUABC PLAYED WHILE HE'S INJURED IN GAME 4.  Blake Griffin played while he's injured in the 2019 Playoffs.  Anthony fucking Davis played while being injured in the first round.  You dumb as shit. You could absofuckinglutely play while you're injured.  Edit: Even Joel Embiid played while he's injured against the Hawks."
"Monte Morris, Christian Wood, Jeff Green, Blake Griffin (stupid), Reggie Jackson."
"Lol, also coming from a team that used to have cp3 and Blake griffin as their best player ya dummy"
blake griffin even as washed as he is
Looking like prime Nets Blake Griffin
had a teacher who i remember being so hyped when blake griffin was drafted. crazy to see the drastic shift in how those folks are treated in real life. people in california at least sort of understood why i liked the suns lol
"i agree, obviously outside of 2017 he has had a star alongside him  but let’s not act as if CP3 hasn’t had talented teammates either. sure he carried in New Orleans (where he still had guys like David West), but he had prime Blake Griffin and DeAndre, James Harden, Booker, and tons of talented role players.   Russ’s teams have all been pretty top-heavy compared to CP3’s so it’s hard to make a direct comparison by just listing out their star teammates"
They should demand Dwight Howard from the Sixers and get Wiggins back. They can bring Anthony Bennett out of ~~retirement~~ the Puerto Rican League too. And maybe they can get Blake Griffin as a free agent too.
"Well you should prepare to be disappointed, because there's no conceivable way he can make significant process in the new few months.  Blake Griffin was a bad/non shooter for years.   He was able to slowly and methodically increase his range year by year until he became a solid 3 point shooter.   That's the kind of process Ben will need to go through in order to become a reliable shooter.   The only other option is that he's already a decent shooter but can't pull the trigger in game, which is arguably worse than having no shooting skills at all."
I'm skeptical that doing blake griffin an expensive favor is going to significantly affect their likelihood of attracting high tier free agents  Cavs gave k-love a sweetheart loyalty deal and it hasn't done them any good
Lopez and whatever else for Blake Griffin
"Yeah, the Hawks don't have an answer for the Bucks' inside game right now. The Nets had Blake Griffin, who, while he is a complete shithead, is at least a solid interior defender. The Hawks just don't have that guy."
Blake Griffin liked my comment on his post a year ago. It was a surprise for sure!
"Can’t believe we traded this man for Brandon Jennings. Who then was traded for Tobias Harris, who was then traded for Blake Griffin."
"It’s really as not comical as you think. Carmelo is one of very few players ever to have that it factor naturally. He is number 10 on the all time scoring list, even after not playing for basically an entire season. A lot of people hate on Carmelo for no reason. All in all, it’s his career. It’s his life. If he wants to play for New York, he can go play in New York.  Nobody should tell him what he can and can’t do. But nobody can tell him that he isn’t one the greatest to ever do it. Sure , peak wade was more “impactful”, but mostly because in his peak had lebron fucking James and Shaquille fucking oneal on his team. Yeah, cp3 wasn’t as good as a scorer as melo but he is a top 5 pg of all time. It’s his job to facilitate the offense, to create the plays. And he was awfully good at doing that. But Melo was one of the few players ever that could just take the ball and score it. Cp3 had Blake Griffin, all be it not any Shaq but it’s still something. Lebron, in his later years had Chris, Dwyane, Kyrie, and now AD. Wade had Shaq as well. Who did Carmelo have that jumped out at you? A past his prime Chauncey? A soon to be retired AI? Sure they were still good but not on any level as any of the other threes teammates. Yes, it is his fault that he didn’t have great teammates. But it’s also the teams fault for not setting him up in those positions. He left Denver after realizing that they will never get him in the position to win a championship. He almost left NY to go to Miami and Chicago on multiple occasions, but the front office always told him lies that they’d get a star, but that never happened. Nevertheless, his career achievements have been lackluster. But there’s no denying that he is a more skilled player than D wade and Cp3."
This one is tuff.   PG: Dave Bing (or Allen Iverson)  SG: Jerry Stackhouse (or Tracy Mcgrady)  SF: Grant Hill  PF: Blake Griffin   C: Bob Lanier
"I get what you're saying, but Grant passed up on staying with a title contender to join the Pistons. Detroit's not like LA where you can piss off your free agent signings and still have people come (ex Blake Griffin scenario). The two protected FRP's probably just aren't worth the risk."
No one gonna mention Blake Griffin?  Self-proclaimed “sweaty boi”
"This was always going to be the case. Question is, will the Clippers Pony up when it's time to renegotiate contracts.  I'll take my downvotes, but I say 'maybe'. You invested a lot to get him (because he wanted George), might as well ride it out. Or, in true Clipper fashion, treat him like you did Blake Griffin. Leonard is in that oft injured category now--but you could still get quite a bit for him.   I actually like PG for this team."
Blake Griffin was more smooth: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pobn9BLy4pY
Everything changed when they tried to storm the Clippers locker room and Blake Griffin called the cops
Let's make an All-Former Pistons team for this year's playoffs.   Khris Middleton Blake Griffin Reggie Jackson Tobias Harris Marcus Morris
Blake Griffin special
"Man I wish Collins got the Blake Griffin calls, then he'd be able to dunk on everyone."
The classic Blake griffin
2020-21 Pistons Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin is 2x the defender of anybody on the Hawks
"I had never heard of the VORP before, and looking through the all-time rankings is actually super interesting. I didn't realize certain guys were as good as they were (or maybe recency bias is more pronounced). For example:  Detlef Schrempf is rated higher than Blake Griffin and only decimal places behind Kyrie Irving. Ballin'.  Rod Strickland better VORP than a bunch of bigger names (Kyrie Irving, Melo, Paul George). Don't remember him being such a stud.  Lowest-rated Hall of Famer I saw was Sabonis with a VORP of 18.44. He is sandwiched between Dale Davis and Danny Manning, with Jamal Crawford close behind.   Andrei Kirilenko just above Isaiah Thomas (!)"
Usually the team trading for the superstar immediately will get better.  Only recent exception I can think of off top would be Detroit trading for Blake Griffin. But there’s a lot of reasons that didn’t work (big one being our roster was constructed with our terrible FO).
"&gt; Before that, most Lakers fans rooted for the Blake Griffin Clippers as their second team.  I don't know about that one dude, I never gave a shit about them before that, I didn't have another team to root for when the Lakers went out, and I never saw any indication that Lakers fans ever rooted for the Clippers even as a second choice."
"&gt; They just drafted a center last year who made All-Rookie, getting Wiseman just stunts both of their development.  You don't draft for fit. Take the best player available. Particularly the Pistons have no reason at all to cater around their current roster.   &gt; \#7 and #14 are also nowhere near enough value for Cade. I don't consider him a ""generational talent"", but he is All-NBA potential.  I think of it more probabilistic. #1 pick has an some chance of turning into a franchise changing player. A #7 pick has a slightly lower chance, and #14 lower. But I don't think it's crazy that #7 + #14 + Wiseman collectively have more odds than Cade.   Let's say conservatively Wiseman is worth #15. If you look at past drafts in the 1-and-done era, around half the time #7 + #14 + #15 is better than #1:  - **2007: Yes** (Brewer + Thornton + Stuckey &gt; Oden) - **2008: No** (DRose &gt; Eric Gordon + Anthony Randolph + RoLo) - **2009: Yes** (Steph Curry + Clark + Daye &gt; Blake Griffin) - **2010: No** (Wall &gt; Monroe + 2Pat + Larry Sanders) - **2011: Yes** (Biyombo + Marcus Morris + Kawhi &gt; Kyrie) - **2012: No** (AD &gt; Barnes + Hensen + Harkless) - **2013: Yes** (McLemore + Shabazz + Giannis &gt; Bennett) - **2014: Yes** (Randle +  TJ Warren + Adreian Payne &gt; Wiggins) - **2015: No** (KAT &gt; Mudiay + Cam Payne + Oubre) - **2016: Yes** (Jamal Murray + Denzel Valentin + Juan Hernangomez &gt; Ben Simmons) - **2017: Yes** (Lauri + Bam Adebayo + Justin Jackson &gt; Fultz) - 2018 onwards: too early to tell (eg MPJ vs Ayton)  So if you look at the 11 year span from 2007 to 2017, you have 7 times (64%) where it's better to take #7 + #14 + #15."
"I mean we added Lebron but there's still time to add Melo, DRose, Blake Griffin and KD lol."
"I’m relatively certain Pistons fans still have PTSD from the last time they traded for a star in their mid-30’s (Allen Iverson). Honorable mention to fellow former Pistons Tracy McGrady, Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin, Chris Webber, and Bob McAdoo."
"Leonard? I think it edged towards hate after the CP3 trade veto and subsequent trade to the Clippers. Before that, most Lakers fans rooted for the Blake Griffin Clippers as their second team."
"Side note: I’m pretty much just talking about Clippers and Rockets. His Nola years are an odd time because the league owned the team and he got out by 25.   Do you really think Prime Blake Griffin, #1 pick, on the Clippers before Paul, thought Chris Paul was better than him back then?"
Blake Griffin
"&gt;light work of the MVP  You mean the 14th defensive ranked Denver nuggets. KD was averaging 43 with Jeff green and Blake Griffin, kyrie and harden for 3 games each.   Much different to Jokic with nothing but g league players. If the suns had played that nets team, under the circumstances-the bucks did, they loose. We’re seeing what PG by himself is doing, KD would have bounced them. Bucks are winning the chip"
"None of those guys were nearly as unlikable as the current ones. Blake Griffin is actually quite likeable and he was a great drunker, the lob jams he and DeAndre Jordan put down were a thing of beauty."
"I actually used to like the Clippers a lot with CP3, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan and Jamal Crawford. It was fun to watch them. Now it's impossible for me to like them for so many reasons  **Paul George** - dude saying so much dumb shit all the time, plus deluding the entire OKC and Indiana.  **Pat Beverly**  - I love his defense, but the guys never know when to shut the hell up, and plays very dirty, resulting in various injuries.  **Marcus Morris**  - Do I even have to say why this guy is an asshole?  **Boogie Cousins**  - Again, a complete asshole who can't keep his emotions. Should become a boxer instead of a basketball player if he likes to fight all the time.  **Patrick Patterson**  - just have bad memories of his time in Toronto. Never worked out, partied all the time, didn't care whatsoever.  **Kawhi Leonard**  - I know I should adore him for helping the Raptors get their first ring, he's not an asshole by any means, but holy fuck is that guy boring as hell. I respect that he prefers his game to speak for him, but it's hard to root for a guy who avoids any talk, and constantly looks like he just wants to go home."
Luka over Blake Griffin
"Chris Paul at his peak was undoubtedly good enough to take you there. The majority of his playoff losses came due to injury to either himself or Blake Griffin. It’s never been a question of how good he is, it’s a question of health."
I live in LA I know they have LeBron on the Lakers… but did the clippers land the MVP guy from Toronto? Legit only know the name kawaii because Toronto sucked the last years in hockey and talked basketball. Do they still have Blake griffin? That’s the only clippers I could name.
"Friend of mine told me how she used to be pretty good friends with Kandi.   Was like ""I only really kind of followed basketball when I was friends with the Clippers number one draft pick. I think he liked that I had no idea who he was and didn't really care.""  ""Blake Griffin?!"" ""Who?"" ""Oh - OH."" ""His name was-"" ""-Michael."" ""Yeah. I didn't really care about the basketball thing, but he was really nice to little kids."""
After seeing Blake Griffin start dunking again you gotta wonder wtf the Pistons are doing to their players lol
And they can't afford to keep the Cheeto blake griffin
wow how dare Blake Griffin disrespect that grown man at the beginning like that
"Joe Ingles was a missed opportunity for us, we had him and then Doc waived him before the season started. Also when we needed a small forward too. Thanks Doc.  I'd think Andre Miller would be most hated for two things, one for sucking so bad and not halfway trying when he was with us in the Elton Brand days (he was traded for Darius Miles), and then the hip check on Blake Griffin. But older fans would probably point to the first one.  Some also hated Elton Brand too, ClipsNation used to call him FElton because he convinced Baron Davis to come over while he bolted to the 76ers almost immediately afterwards."
Nov 20 2010 - Blake Griffin reaching over Mozgov and pushing his head out of the way with the other hand
So Blake Griffin retires? This is the best rule change yet!
I voted Blake Griffin for the Grizz. But I get Draymond. He hit Conley in the face after breaking his face against the Blazers in the previous series.   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/video-draymond-green-hits-mike-conley-in-the-injured-face-on-loose-ball/  Conley clearly calling a timeout and Draymond comes in grabbing at the ball and hits him in the face. It’s pretty bang-bang but lots of Grizz fans weren’t happy with how it went down.
"Yeah we don't need him to be prime Blake Griffin or anything, just enough of a threat to keep the defense honest in the pick and roll"
"The Lakers’ most hated list goes to show you how much of the vote was skewed by Gen Z fans who follow the more-recent player’s social media during the offseason. lulz  A true Lakers fan list includes names like Larry Bird, Danny Ainge, Bill Russell, Red Auerbach, Pierce, Bill Laimbeer, Kevin Johnson, Malone, Rasheed Wallace, Vlade Divac, Mike Bibby, Duncan, Garnett, CP3, Doc and Blake Griffin."
Nash managed to hold off giannis for 4 games with Blake griffin at center.  Stevens had a top 5 defense with kyrie and kemba (his first year).  Good coaches get it done.
"Played better team defense honestly, and blake griffin was a better matchup on gianiss than anyone on the hawks"
"He simply wasn't the same player as he was in Minn. Whether it was because he got injured, his weight change (cause like I said before he was pretty bad in the post unlike when he was in Minn.), or anything else, he wasn't that good. I can point out to so many series in those playoff runs in which he severely underperformed. I have no problem with calling him even a great role player because of his rebounding, but to call him a star when his scoring was so poor and his defense was straight up awful for the most part is such a reach. Is it fair to still call Blake Griffin a star? If you look at the series against Milwaukee in which he had to step up, he played about as well as Love did in many of those series. Sure, his rebounding was a bit lower but he was way better on defense and more efficient. And before you bring up his numbers against Boston, they just didn't need him to score at all when you have a healthy KD, Harden, and Kyrie."
"I mean you can nitpick the metrics but ppg is one of if not the best stat to define a scorer.  How else do you name a scoring champion?  Using your examples, I think many if not all would agree that Carmelo is a better SCORER than D.Wade (not player).  Blake Griffin was always known for his offensive prowess, i.e. scoring/dunks.  I would venture that if he has a higher ppg than Dirk (haven't checked), it's because Dirk was taking his time with his hall of famer retirement tour the last few years of his career, literally hobbling up the court. Lol.   That said, Kyrie is a great scorer and a great, creative finisher at the rim; his shooting percentages are incredible.  I just think there's a good argument that Trae is already a better scorer and a GREAT argument that he will be a better scorer based mainly on his ability to shoot the 3 ball and, ironically, his passing ability, which causes defenses to sag, a la space to shoot said 3.  He reminds me of steph curry with swag, and more advanced (and less injury prone, knock on wood) at this stage of his career.   Out of curiosity, who do you think is more similar to Trae? Steph or Kyrie?  And of Steph or Kyrie, who do you think is the better scorer?"
The Hawks have a fun brand of basketball to watch. These playoffs have actually been a lot of fun just to watch the Bucks play some impressive teams. The Heat series was rough but watching a Nets superstar team really gut out the series was awesome. Just watching Kevin Durant play at the level he did was a treat. Even Harden getting out their on one leg and being the second option for the Nets was cool. Blake Griffin even relished being a defensive answer for Giannis was a cool thing to see from a former superstar. These East playoffs are just great for everyone in my opinion.
Clippers with Blake griffin is my default way of thinking of CP3.
They just saw what the Pistons did to Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin was in 2019 imo
I mean he could. Do you honestly think current Blake Griffin couldn’t be replaced by someone else in the league who hasn’t won all star? There’s bench players who put up better numbers than him. And most would consider Blake a significantly better player than Big Z considering he has 3x the amount of all stars
"Not really. The whole 2000s team were exciting but didn’t win. They had one good season with Elton Brand playing like a MVP. Baron Davis was a big name but didn’t translate to success.  They lucked big time getting winning the Blake Griffin draft sweepstakes. And then the league gift wrapped Chris Paul which gave them lob city. Despite Donald Sterling being given wonderful gift, he couldn’t stop being a racist POS and was rightly thrown out of the league. They’ve field a competitive playoff contender for the 2010s and at least the early 2020s"
"Yeah, I do agree generally. The Bucks/Nets series were a bit of an exception, in my opinion, for this series. KD struggled passing without turnovers and really there weren't many players around him who could shoot anywhere near well enough to win it. Bruce Brown only had a floater in his bag (which the Nets did feed him), Joe Harris was *rough*, Harden couldn't hit a shot outside of one game on very limited attempts. After Game 2 the only player they had that could be a little bit consistent outside of KD was Blake Griffin - and they did give him looks.  I interpreted Pippen's comments about being the quantity of shots taken - I think every player puts up shots they probably shouldn't. I think for the series KD shooting *less* might have taken them further away from a win, even if his 30 shots involved less-than-ideal looks."
I’m hoping you guys make it out. Especially after what Blake Griffin pulled
"This is the 2nd reply to specifically single out only this part of my comment, it feels like politics where the politicians pick the smallest snippet of an overall quote and make their entire argument over that without taking the rest of the context.  So on that note, let me take that part out and say for the record that KD was being mostly guarded by Brook Lopez. Do you still agree with the rest of my previous comment that I wouldn't trust Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, and Blake Griffin to create their own shot against the rest of the Bucks? Given the situation, dropping 49 and 48 while playing the entire game is still a great game  KD is not a playmaker, so if that's the point you're trying to make, yes I agree with you. He's a pure scorer and a really really good one at that. He did a great job given the entire Nets situation, and I'm thankful for it as a Nets fan. The guy is not a perfect player in all offensive aspects but the effort was clearly there.   Things can be intersectional (for lack of a better word) and things can most definitely be situational without honing in on one specific shortcoming and then gravitating to an extreme based on that (recalling the strawman argument that politicians do). I encourage you as I did with the other reply to look at the majority of the comments and see how appreciative the fans are for Durant despite the cards the Nets were dealt with during the series"
"Literally nobody else except for Mike James can create their own shot on the Hospital-edition Nets during the Bucks series...I wouldn't trust Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, Jeff Green, or Blake Griffin dribbling the ball in their hands the way shot creators would to find their shots. The fact that KD dropped 49 and 48 while playing the entire game and being the only focus on defense for Milwaukee as well as being guarded by PJ Tucker who has been regarded as ""the KD stopper"" going back years now, yeah that's insane  At least for the Jazz, an on-and-off Conley, Jordan Clarkson, Bojan Bogdanovic, and even Joe Inglés can kinda create their own shot, the other Nets played as the beneficiaries of playmakers like Harden and him being hobbled showed consequences on the court"

"When they had literal Blake Griffin on the roster? When they had Reggie Jackson, Tobias Harris, and Andre Drummond???  Yes. Absolutely. They just were really bad at it."
"What reporting? The Blake Griffin blurb? That was more about the dysfunctional chemistry than the culture imo. Aparently Kemba and Brad where butting heads.  Stevens is out and Kembas gone, Horfords back. I think we will see much better on court chemistry this year. Id take Smart all day every day on any team"
LOL big Blake Griffin energy
Blake Griffin is nothing like James Harden
Yeah.  The league really feels bad that the Pistons lost the unstoppable superstar Blake Griffin.
"Reassess what? Passing it to an open Joe Harris for him to brick another 3? I much rather have KD playing hero ball. Jeff Green, Kyrie, Harden were all hurt. Is KD supposed to rely on Joe Harris, Landry Shamet and a washed up blake griffin?"
Reggie Jackson &amp; Blake Griffin really dragged their feet in Detroit wow
"It’s not accurate at all. Barkley is the goat Sun, where the hell is Melo. Who tf is Dale Davis and when did he become better than PG, where is Shaq, Nique is the GOAT Hawk, some rando from the 50s over AI  Edit: not to mention no Zeke or Blake Griffin"
"Well, here is Giannis ""Checks Under His Bed at Night for Jimmy Butler"" Flop-etokounmpo playoff record for everyone to see that he has never even won a legitimate playoff series before this year either:  Beginning of time to 1994: too scared of Jimmy Butler to be born  1994-2013: too scared of Jimmy Butler to come to the NBA  2014: so bad he didnt even play that much and he still cost his team 23 more games than the previous season  2015: peed his pants at the sight of Jimmy Butler's Bulls, lost in 6  2016: so scarred by his encounter with Jimmy Butler he refuses to make the playoffs  2017: Wins Most Improved Player and plays on a superteam with Rookie of the Year (better player than Joel Embiid for context) Malcolm Brogdon and Pistons legend Khris Middleton, still loses to a lowly Raptors team in 6 that got destroyed by Lebron.   2018: Lets his superteam down again to the Baby Celtics missing Hayward and Kyrie in 7 games  2019: After winning MVP because voters felt bad for him despite being on a superteam, barely squeaked by Pistons with an injured Blake Griffin (doesnt count, poor sportsmanship not to wait until Blake got better, but Giannis was scared again), beat the Baby Celtics (doesnt count because I said so), then lost in 6 to some random Canadian team led by some mute guy who hadn't played in two years. Used Brogdon as a scapegoat and Giannis cried until they let Brogdon walk (my uncle works for the Bucks, I know all the inside info and know all the players and wear all the flyest clothes and call the players by their nicknames, it's not a big deal though)  2020: Barely squeaked by Orlando without any of their good players (Doesnt count because Shaq, Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Tmac, and Dwight Howard all didnt play). Lost to the Miami Jimmy Butlers in 5 after being so scared that Giannis refused to finish the series."
"Giannis with Kyrie for 4 games and Harden for 3 games, with the NBA's 3P% leader (Joe Harris), plus Blake Griffin will f**k the league.  With Giannis, even DeAndre Jordan becomes playable, cos DJ just have to guard the paint, while Giannis scours the help defense."
I saw blake griffin kick that mans dog.
"I mean, what do you think LeBron and Giannis do  70% of the time on their way to the hoop? Or what Blake Griffin used to do? They push right through people initiating the contact, sometimes it’ll get called for an offensive foul, but the vast majority of the time they let it ride. There just aren’t very many players with both the size, athletic ability, and basketball skill to do that in an effective manner."
"🔊call more offensive fouls on Giannis we arent playing football. While you're at it retroactively call Blake Griffin for his stiff arms, since I know someone will bring that up in my discussion of Giannis being and offensive foul machine.  But seriously isnt rhat the best way to play Giannis anyways? Unless his minute total free throw routine is good for getting rest time on the court. NBA needs to handle that imo."
"Oh word, so Ben Simmons choked in the playoffs this year cause of his ex girl friend two years ago? Checks out.   Also harden, Clarkson, odom, Humphries, all had career years either after or while dating that family. Blake Griffin even had an all star season after dating Kendall Jenner despite age starting to creep up on him. Even Tristan Thompson's stats have been consistent.   This is such a sexist narrative but people think it's funny cause Kardashians. Imagine if Toby from accounting sucked at his job and everyone blamed his ex-girlfriend, but his performance was the same before and after he met/broke up"
"Iirc a couple years ago before free agency, Blake griffin  just tweeted the eyes emoji and then it was revealed to be as a bit for a podcast a couple days later"
Fuck Blake Griffin
"Same reason Blake Griffin never got called for his forearm shots when he made epic dunks. Also, the referees probably sit in amazement just as much as us"
"Hell, he was an inch away from losing to a KD whose 2nd best player was Blake Griffin. &amp; let LeBron embarass him on nat'l TV last year after the whole ""I wear the crown now"" thing."
Blake Griffin is a vet that knows to avoid fouling unlike ayton. And no one else on the suns is strong enough to guard Giannis
"I’m not throwing stones. My franchise sucks, but I’m not going to look at the fucking Nets and tell them some shit like they wish they had the Latvian Laser instead of Blake Griffin or something dumb. I’m telling Clips fans not to throw stones.  Also, correct me if I’m wrong, didn’t he give himself the nickname about guarding Donovan Mitchell?"
I remember people were calling him worse than Blake Griffin during the nets series
Blake Griffin really did a great job on Giannis.
I mean yeah it is. I'd love for the Hall of Fame to reward only all time players. Which Vince Carter is not. If you want to use Blake Griffin or Ben Wallace (since Im a Pistons fan) instead its fine by me.  But its done its not even worth the debate because it is like that and it wont change
"Chris Paul will opt out his contract to sign a max extension, maybe even a super max. If he wants out of PHO to ensure he gets more titles there are two options  Lakers sign and trade: Schroeder, Harrell, Kuzma, THT, future pick swap for CP3.   Nets sign and trade: Dinwiddie, Harris, Bruce, Shamet, Claxton,  for CP3   Lakers roll out: Chris Paul, KCP, LeBron James, AD, Drummond  or   Nets roll out: Chris Paul, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin  or Suns roll out: Schroeder, Booker, Bridges, Crowder, Ayton with Harrell off the bench  or  Dinwiddie, Booker, Bridges, Crowder, Ayton with Harris, shamet and Clax off the bench"
Him and Blake Griffin are probably gonna be remembered as Clippers.
Blake Griffin lol
"In 2010, the 3 closest west teams to having cap space for Bron were the Clips, Kings, and TWolves. It would basically be almost Cavs 2.0 West except with a young big man instead of a young PG like Kyrie  If he went to the Clips, he'd form a dynamic duo with a young Blake Griffin while having a veteran starting caliber PG in Baron Davis  If he went to the Kings, he'd form a dynamic duo with a young DeMarcus Cousins while having the reigning ROY Tyreke Evans  If he went to the TWolves, he'd again form a dynamic duo with a younger and buffer Kevin Love."
"DJ made it for the same reasons Gobert is making it now. Not a lick of offensive talent, but the engine of the entire teams defense and a good rebounder. Didn't hurt that he was also part of the hype-beast lob city team where everything Blake Griffin did got him sponsorships and national media attention for the team.  That said, he definitely shouldn't have knocked any of the more talented bigs out. KAT is a franchise player talent wise and has shown it (I don't believe in empty stats outside of very specific situations). DJ was a solid big that could make a defensive impact."
Blake Griffin didn't help win a chip in Detroit.
Blake griffin was just bought out
"&gt;	Plus 2 1sts, I forgot who they drafted. Maybe one of them was Randy Foye? Also considered like a can’t miss prospect. Just didn’t work out. Rashad McCants maybe, really can’t remember how those picks shook out.  One of them ended up being Wayne Ellington with the 28th pick. Whatever, not really an asset.   But the other pick was returning Minnesota’s 1st rounder to them, which ended up being the 6th overall pick only 3 years later. That Wolves infamously took Jonny Flynn with Steph Curry still on the board. (DeMar DeRozan was two picks after that.) And if a few ping pong balls bounced differently then that pick could have been Blake Griffin or James Harden."
"At least she admitted to it unlike literally every other ""analyst"" who just quadruple down on every bad take or decision.  ESPN used to run a commercial with Steven A saying Carmelo was better than Blake Griffin and a few years later Carmelo was out the league. STEVEN a brought it back up this year as if he was some sort of prophet and Blake wasn't an all star while Melo was out the league."
Blake Griffin has been an allstar last I remember
One time [they had to call the LAPD](https://youtu.be/uO5Ww26XHtI) because Chris Paul and Blake Griffin were trying to get into the locker room and kill the Rockets. Shit was crazy.
Even if you don’t count Harden. They still had Blake Griffin who got his jump back.
"à la the ""Blake Griffin"" multi-year buyout.   Eat the cap hit and don't give up assets. The contract is bad, but don't compound it so you can overpay someone else sooner in free agency."
KG old man dunk over Blake Griffin is also up there
"Jason Giambi, Jeremy Giambi  Blake Griffin, Taylor Griffin  Cal Ripken Jr, Billy Ripken  Jose Canseco, Ozzie Canseco  Matt Hasselbeck, Tim Hasselbeck  Some guys are just way more talented than their brother."
"I don't even know how Kendrick Perkins is still alive let alone has a job considering it's well documented that Blake Griffin killed him on January 30th, 2012."
Ehh i think it was overstated. I’ll admit no depth was an exaggeration but it was basically Blake Griffin and Joe Harris after that.
These are my favorite sleeved jerseys. Snagged a Blake Griffin jersey for a future historic throwback
The 2022 Nets are going to end up like Mr. Burn's ringer team.    James Harden: Arrested for narcotics in France  Kevin Durant: Hypnotized into believing he's a snake  Kyrie Irving: Fell off the edge of the earth  Blake Griffin: Gets into a car accident while filming a KIA commercial  Joe Harris: Refuses to shave his pubes and gets kicked off the team  DeAndre Jordan: Gets dwarfism eating a special brain and nerve pizza developed by team doctors  Jeff Green: Too buy rescuing people during a hurricane  Spencer Dinwiddie: Knocked out by local oaf over argument about who's the real NY team
thats why ring chasing vets really help the contending teams too.  They know exactly what they're capable of and where they're expected to contribute.  Blake griffin and LMA would have been great additions to brooklyn and injuries aside they were the favorites.  Batum on the clippers also comes to mind.
you think if Blake Griffin went off for a few big nights and got offered 42/3 he's leaving Brooklyn? genuine Q
"You're the one who's been misled by the Durant legacy-protecting narrative.   Nets still had the NBA 3P% leader in all those games and 6 time Allstar Blake Griffin, plus one of Kyrie or Harden.   Both teams had injuries. Both adjusted. Same way Hawks, Bucks adjusted in that series. It's part of the game. Deal with it. Stop with the excuses."
"The modern game is boring IMO  I became a fan in the early 90s, so I might be biased. It just seemed back then the play required more strategy, defense, more thought and didn’t rely so much on athleticism.  Back then, even the very best three point shooters like Drazen Petrovic would put up like 3-4 attempts from three. Now even guys like Blake Griffin will throw up 7-8 a game.  In today’s game, it’s really boring to see a game that 50% threes, 50% in the paint with no one playing defense.   I don’t have much interest watching teams other than my team. Back then, I watched nearly every national game.  It’s turned into a real life version of NBA jam."
Blake Griffin might regress to Blake Hippogriff
"Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan, so four?"
"For the record Paul tried to join Kobe once, and then joined peak Blake Griffin when that didn't work.  And when that didn't work out he leveraged his situation to join Harden.  The fact that it didn't go well doesn't exempt Chris Paul from the super team conversation."
Lebron for Blake Griffin
"He was crap in LeBron’s last Cleveland season. I don’t think this is a Blake Griffin situation where he is being clever about how he expends himself.   For a min, though, I don’t think it would be too big of a risk. But no more than that. Cavs shouldn’t have given him such a huge deal, it’s too big to be tradable."
To save millions of dollars. Lamarcus Aldridge gave up $7.25 million when the spurs didn't even want to play him anymore. Blake Griffin gave up $13.3 million. That's a ton of money to save when having the player there benefits nobody.
So you think it's cool for the Blake Griffin types to sandbag it on a bad team so they get bought out and then suddenly look 5 years younger when they sign for the minimum on a contender?
"That's fair, but he's a one-way role player.  I'm talking about guys like Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond."
"14-15 season sits with me for the false hope.  SVG came in and waived Josh Smith in like December.  Brandon Jennings then leads us to a very nice run (I think we won 7 in a row at some point). He was looking like a potential all star and the team was actually looking like we could sneak into the playoffs. Then he goes down like early-mid feb, our season basically was over.  Pretty much happened again in 16-17 when Reggie Jackson went down I think late Nov-early december. Think we were 3rd or 4th in the East and we immediately became ass again cause of injuries to other players as well.  Been a hard decade as a pistons fan. Blake Griffin carried our sorry asses to the playoffs and he had to miss all but the final game of that sweep if I remember right. Then he was never the same again as a first option"
"farmar thompson and bibby are not as ""great"" as u may believe lol look at their fathers. Also if u think they are ""great"" then j kidd, trae young, blake griffin and a few others gotta be names that should be on this list as well. Hell, anyone who is half ""great"" should in all fairness be put on this list based upon who is listed lol"
TL;DR   1. Reggie Jackson  2. John Collins   3. Blake Griffin  4. Cameron Payne  5. Austin Rivers
"really good fit. I think this is close to Blake Griffin-Detroit territory. Love has got a lot of bball left, especially in a super specialized role"
"As a Nets fan, the Bucks are the dumbest team you'll ever see play basketball IQ-wise. They didn't punish Bruce Brown/Blake Griffin/Jeff Green at center down low the whole series, the Suns will be fine"
Yes he did   https://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/nba/pistons/2019/06/04/detroit-pistons-blake-griffin-gets-last-laugh-twitter-prank/1337812001/
Blake won them games? Kevin Durant won them games not Blake Griffin tf?
Blake Griffin
"Zion is on the Blake Griffin fast track, minus the shooting development.  2.5 years.."
what all 3? I don't care what the Bucks did in the East.  And seriously dude? Acting like GORAN DRAGIC and LOU WILLIAMS and a washed up Blake Griffin were some incredible hurdles? lol the East must be softer than I thought
Blake Griffin had the oddest buyout we have seen yet. We never see someone bought out 2 years early  And then we learn he was totally dogging it in Detroit lol
He may be miserable but apparently he's not miserable enough like Blake Griffin was to take a massive buyout
Blake Fucking Griffin putting a chair in front of the door to keep Cubes out.
Somewhat unrelated but I wouldn’t be surprised if KLove ends up with another team soon and has a Nets Blake Griffin type of season. Solid role player that can stay on the damn court
Blake Griffin had a stand up bit about that haha
Giannis needs to work with the trainer that helped Blake Griffin elevate his shooting
"Unlike the rest of the kids here I actually had the pleasure of watching Stockton play and yes while I do believe he’s underrated I don’t think he’s better than the 3 players I listed before him. Isaiah had the deeper team but who on his team is even close to being a top 5 player at their position. The Pistons were a very talented deep team but in no way shape or form are they a 3 time NBA finalist, 2 time NBA champion team without him. If he’s not there the Pistons best player is probably Joe Dumars or Adrian Dantley(maybe). We are in agreement that Nash is several tiers below the other names being mentioned.   I just cant put Stockton solely over Chris because Chris never had a teammate as good as Malone. While Blake Griffin was good he’s nowhere near as good as Karl Malone was."
I heard Blake Griffin was more nervous on the Eric Andre Show than any NBA playoff game.
"I mean, look at the odds for any other single pick lmao. Draft isn't a science but you definitely have the best chance with 1.  This way of looking at it also ignores outcomes where you get a really really good player at #1 who just happens to not be the absolute best in the draft. Hakeem is the best player in almost any draft, just happened to be in the same class as MJ. AI and Kyrie were/are both excellent players that just happened to have all-timers hiding in the late lottery range. John Wall is the 2nd best career in that class and could have been argued as 1 at points. Blake Griffin was in MVP consideration at a certain point even though he was obviously not Harden/Steph. Derrick Rose won an MVP but got derailed by injuries. I think it's hard to truly feel bad about those picks."
Why? 1/3 of getting the best player is really damn solid odds  The average #1 pick is like a John Wall/Blake Griffin caliber guy
"&gt;So because I expressed my opinion that paying John Collins would be a massive overpay and I’m a Lakers fan I’m “throwing stones?”  Yes.  &gt;I’m sorry me not agreeing with the reported contract he’s asking for and whilst also cheering for another team to you means I’m talking shit. You do realize I’m not the only person who feels this way and not everybody who does is a Lakers fan correct?  Idk its just weird counting a player's cash like that. Just my take.  &gt;If what you’re saying is true then everything you say about a franchise not being historically competent would be you just talking shit, because you’re a fan of the clippers, correct?   I mean by definition of rings culture then yeah I would be throwing stones. But we've been competitive over the last 12 years and have been by all measure a different franchise since we drafted Blake Griffin back in '09. Still a valid observation.  &gt;I don’t need you to recap the situation like I’m some idiot that doesn’t understand what’s going on. I expressed my OPINION and that’s just what it is.  One of us is mad here. And it's not me lol."
**SAC:**  What if Ricky Berry never committed suicide?  Karl Malone over Joe Kleine?  Win the draft and take Blake Griffin (best odds)?  **WHAT IF CHRIS WEBBER DOESN'T COME BACK AFTER INJURY AND FUCK UP THE TEAM?**
"John Stockton dunks over a Kia, Blake Griffin becomes the steals leader"
"Remember when the All-Star Saturday night event program was leaked early and had an event where you could ""meet slam dunk contest winner Blake Griffin"" before the contest had even taken place. Then Demar DeRozan went off the side of the backboard between the legs and got a lower score than Blake Griffin who went off the side of the backboard and windmilled? But if Blake didn't get a higher score at that moment he would have been eliminated in the first round. Now try to remember how Blake was the worst of the 4 dunkers in the contest. But then later in the competition Blake would jump over the hood of a Kia and end up winning, which revealed the plan all along. That was near the beginning of the NBA/Kia partnership 🙄"
"Jermaine O'Neal, Paul George, Blake Griffin, and Carmelo Anthony have all also come 3rd (or 2nd) in MVP voting.  Like PG did just a couple years ago."
"The reason Scottie is top 50, and guys like Kemp and Johnson aren't mentioned is cause Scottie was part of a dynasty team. If he was drafted to the Hornets instead, who knows what would have happened, maybe he'd be another 90s all star on a middling team like Kevin Johnson or Tim Hardaway.  Maybe he still leads his team to the playoffs but they get bounced early. It's not like 50 wins and the second round (what Scottie did in 94) is unprecedented. About 8 players do that every year.  Like DeMar DeRozan led his team as far as Scottie did as the #1 option. As did plenty of other all stars over the years like PG, Butler, Blake Griffin, Vince Carter. Etc.  Also people never acknowledge how that Jordan-less Bulls team in 94 still had Horace Grant. Then in 95 when grant left, before Jordan came back, they were under .500. Grant was a big part of that first 3 peat before they got Harper and Rodman. Him and Scottie were rookies the same year as well. So it wasn't just Scottie that put them over the hump or helped that team win games."
"Well, most people have forgotten he existed and attribute that marriage to Blake Griffin now."
"In case you didn't know but the author based Kagami off Blake Griffin, pretty dope. Kagami does a bunch of literally one-to-one Blake highlights. Apparently, the author really likes Lob City when they were around.   To answer your question he is most similar to Kagami, but Rui kind of reminds of the power-forward version of Kawhi almost. I don't remember any players really being like him, he's pretty unique."
"&gt;This is why its always quietly amusing to me people bemoan stuff like Blake Griffin or Dwight Howard getting roped into child support payments.   I don't get it. Was it not their children? You should pay child support either way then, doesn't matter if you're rich or poor."
Ben Simmons lmao. But seriously if he gets a jumpshot like how Blake Griffin and Brook Lopez did out of nowhere he will jump into being a top 5 player just like that lol. Probably not gonna happen.
"I think you don't quite grasp it.  Dwight Howard and Blake Griffin have each made over 220 million dollars. Cash. That is enough money to buy multiple homes outright and fund kids, nieces, and grandkids all going to college, getting them started in their first cars and houses and if you were smart having 20-50 million set aside in a low cost index fund so the money is perpetually earning new money matching the current productivity rate of the stock markets.  I'd argue its approaching an immoral sum of cash"
"I hated that move so much man. Reminded me of the trade SVG made for Blake Griffin for win-now results, giving up both Tobias Harris and a 1st that ended up becoming Shai Gilgeous Alexander, and reaching a ceiling of an 8th seed and a first round sweep"
"Kevin Love most likely won't get bought out till the 2022-23 season, when he's on the last year of his contract. Blake Griffin is the exception, but normally players don't get bought out until they're on the final year of their contracts. It just doesn't make sense to buy them out ahead of time when you're guaranteeing that their full salary is gonna be on the cap for the next season after they're gone. Like look at Detroit following the Blake Griffin buyout. [This is a pretty tough pill to swallow.](https://i.imgur.com/gIG7zyj.png)"
"Vacations, expensive cars or collectibles, sometimes dinner at like a 5 star restaurant, real estate, their children.  This is why its always quietly amusing to me people bemoan stuff like Blake Griffin or Dwight Howard getting roped into child support payments. These guys are making multiple lifetime's worth of cash for 4 year contracts or what have you. These guys who have gotten a max NBA contract aren't gonna hurt for a penny unless they're wildly dumb"
tbf if there’s one thing basketball reference is historically bad at it’s HOF likelihood percentages. Giannis is at 48% and Blake Griffin is at 52. Draymond’s at 38% and John Wall is more likely to make it than Jokic.
The real winner of the Nets post season: Blake Griffin
"They DID all flock there!  Blake Griffin, LMA, the best players to get bought out wanted to go there."
It'll look like the thing Blake Griffin wore a couple years ago against the Bucks.
"Absolutely.  &gt;The veteran Blake Griffin has officially signed for the Brooklyn Nets. This mid-season trade is expected to be the hottest news as of now. However, the team is aggressively pursuing free-agents. DeAndre Jordan has finally reunited with Blake Griffin since Los Angeles Clippers’ days. Veteran Blake Griffin said that it was not DeAndre Jordan who recruited him the most to join Brooklyn Nets rather it was Kevin Durant.   &gt;   &gt;Since the trade a lot of teams including the Philadelphia 76ers have expressed their opinions. This is a clear warning that the team is making a title contending squad. Blake Griffin recently met with head coach Steve Nash. Griffin said that KD was mostly in touch with him. He said, “I talked to KD the most,” he said. “I’ve known James, KD, Kyrie, and DeAndre for a long time, so this is a familiar team for me.”  He's very good friends with Irving too. I'm assuming the Team USA had some factor into that."
It wasn't that crazy of a rookie season though. I remember it as well. Melo had the better year. But LeBron dropped 40/9/9 in the last week of the season while Melo played below average a few of those last games.  Like Luka and Blake Griffin are 2 that come to mind that had better rookie seasons than LeBron.
"Blake Griffin, Yao, Duncan, Grant Hill, and Shaq were the most recent rookie all stars.  I don’t even think Cade gets the rookie all star nod if the Pistons look like a playoff team.  The league is too stacked with talent."
Still mad about the dunk contest where Blake Griffin was handed a win cause he dunked over the hood of a Kia with a sprite logo on it... seemed like nobody cared how scripted it was...  I think a lot of NBA players can do that dunk.
David west and Blake griffin
"Pippen led his team to a 54 win record and the second round as the #1 option. On like 23/6/6 with worse efficiency than his years with MJ.  He did something that at least 8 players do every year (make it to second round). Other players who have led their team to 50 wins and the second round as a #1 option include  DeMar DeRozan, Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, John Wall, Jimmy Butler, Jermaine O'Neal, Vince Carter, Carmelo Anthony, and Blake Griffin.   Before you say how Scottie finished 3rd for MVP that year, so did Paul George, Blake Griffin, Jermaine O'Neal, and Carmelo (2nd).  Meanwhile AI actually WON the MVP and led his team to 60 wins as the #1 guy. He was also universally viewed as a top 3 player from 1999 - 2003. Whereas Scottie was always in the second tier of the top 10 after guys like MJ, Robinson, Hakeem, Shaq, and Barkley."
"He's a star.  It's hard to believe he's been in the league since 2009 - the same amount of time as Blake Griffin, Ricky Rubio and Harden, DeRozan and Steph.  Man that was a pretty solid draft class.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2009.html"
"He gave up about $13 million of the $53 million he had left. That’s about a quarter that he gave up, and that was still unprecedented and by far the largest buyout in history.   [source](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/03/05/its-official-blake-griffin-bought-out-by-detroit-will-become-free-agent/)"
"So was Lonzo, so was Blake Griffin but both of them really got better at shooting three's.  At 21, he can drastically improve.  Don't forget this was his first games under Nate, the entire team did horribly with Pierce.  Oh yeah, Russell Westbrook is 32 and again, Cam Reddish is 21 but you can believe what you want to."
Blake Griffin.
They aren't championship material though? The only reason they're here is KD was playing alone with a 1/6th of a normal James harden and Blake griffin as 3rd best player. if even harden was healthy they'd be gone already.
"It certainly did. Be proud of your achievement but it's pretty ridiculous to deny that injuries played a huge part in our series. Bucks were almost matched by KD, 1/4 of Harden, and Blake Griffin."
Couldn’t care less about Blake Griffin or Carmelo to be honest…
First Team All-“Get This Man A Ring”:  PG - Chris Paul  SG - Derrick Rose  SF - Paul George  PF - Carmelo Anthony  C - Giannis  Second Team:  PG - Russell Westbrook  SG - James Harden  SF - Jimmy Butler  PF - Blake Griffin  C - Lamarcus Aldridge
"I don’t think Blake griffin deserves to be on here, I don’t think that many people are that passionate about him"

Kevin Love and Blake Griffin just aren't the same caliber of player. You really shouldn't compare them.
He also plays on a shitty team in Cleveland. People said the exact same things about Blake Griffin.
He’d be on a minimum after a buyout. Like Blake Griffin.
Dude played with blake griffin before. He knows he ain't winning shit with the kardashian curse hovering around.
Lebron was runner up for DPOY last year?   &gt;Also why are you bringing Dwight into this?   Because you said the Lakers have 3 all-nba and all-defense guys. Who is the 3rd you're referring to if not Dwight?  This year's Nets were more stacked than the Lakers. I can do stupid shit like you too and talk about Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan's all-nba selections. Five 1st team all-nba players on the same team lmao

"It seems possible that CP3 has not in fact declined his player option, and that Shams jumped the gun. The same happened in 2017:  - **June 23, 2017**: [""The Clippers were informed Friday that both Chris Paul and Blake Griffin have declined their player options for the 2017-18 season and will become unrestricted free agents""](https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/la-sp-clippers-griffin-contract-20170623-story.html) - **June 28, 2017**: [""After Chris Paul agreed to opt-in on contract, Clippers are trading  All-Star guard to the Houston Rockets, league sources tell @TheVertical""](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/880087788242083841)"
"Shams did Tweet that he declined it, but I'm not sure that means he put pen to paper to actually decline it. In 2017, there were similar shenanigans.   - **June 23, 2017**: [""The Clippers were informed Friday that both Chris Paul and Blake Griffin have declined their player options for the 2017-18 season and will become unrestricted free agents""](https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/la-sp-clippers-griffin-contract-20170623-story.html) - **June 28th, 2017**: [""After Chris Paul agreed to opt-in on contract, Clippers are trading  All-Star guard to the Houston Rockets, league sources tell @TheVertical""](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/880087788242083841)"
"Tim Duncan, Blake Griffin, Dirk, KG, LMA, Bosh my God you're a casual. And what Klay accomplished without Steph and dray? Nothing. At least love managed to win 40 games with the worst roster I've ever seen since the 2006 Lakers. Replace him with Klay and twolves wouldn't even 15."
Kevin Love made it when the PF position was weak and the best players at that position were a bit older outside of blake griffin if you really want to go there  Love has accomplished almost nothing significant without lebron and klays +2 rings are over love's 2nd team all nba appearance on a losing Timberwolves team
people would definitely wonder in 20 years why Blake Griffin isn't HOF despite having the meanest highlights
Blake Griffin maybe?
"That's just a play on the old fanfic that Westbrook and Kevin Love would team up on the Lakers from around 2013. In that universe, Durant was a straight up trade to the Clippers for Blake Griffin (they had similar value and contracts) during the Lob City era, which made sense because Griffin had played in Oklahoma during college.  Also there was the CP3 to team up with Dwight Howard on the Hornets rumor that never panned out.  NBA is fun fanfiction."
"I find it so weird how in his final season he only got one dunk. When I read a stat like that, I assume it's a soft/tiny non-chalant tip or just him ""placing it"" into the rim. But he posterized Blake Griffin, no other way to word it"
First you have to be 7 foot 11 yamming on Blake Griffin
Watch Rose pull a Blake Griffin and just turn the clock back to 2011 and start dunking and draining 3s
"Remember how well that turned out for the likes of Blake Griffin, etc? I still don’t understand how Westbrook is going to work on the Lakers"
Blake Griffin got bought out for the same amount so who knows. Edit: Actually it was even more
Except Pau Gasol is prime Blake griffin in this go around
It's definitely not going to be Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin was the very first guest on Norm MacDonald’s Sports Show back in the day.
"If they take guys off the first top 50 list then maybe, if they don't then it's gonna get really hard for a lot of guys. Also, Blake Griffin on the just off list too either way."
"If Harrell gets play as a 6th guy in the playoffs, that’s probably a terrible. More realistically 7th and 8th after they sign Blake Griffin and Jeff Green back"
Almost any team would trade their future assets for a good chance at the title _now_. And finding depth for these teams isn't hard at all. Let's not forget that Brooklyn last year got Blake Griffin and LMA basically for free. A bunch of good vets would take a minimum deal for a shot at a title.
Brooklyn gets some size so they dont have to play Blake Griffin 35 minutes in the playoffs.
Remember guys Blake Griffin is the American Jan Vesley
blake griffin
1. KD  2. Devin Booker  3. Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin dunking on Aaron baynes 3 times in one game
I remember watching his high school tape and thinking he was gonna be Blake Griffin
I think a lot of people are thinking it’ll be a Blake Griffin on the Pistons type situation for Love. Maybe once he gets a on a better team he’ll become a contributor again. It’s just a way bigger risk than what the Nets took on Blake.
"Free agency moves fast. Let's say a big is on your wishlist as a team, and you make a play for John Collins when Free Agency starts. Hawks have 3 days to match that, and that's 3 days you can't make a play for Lauri Markkanen, Jarrett Allen, Richaun Holmes, Serge Ibaka, PJ Tucker, Paul Milsap or Blake Griffin. That's not even considering the other free agents at other positions. You're probably the man out and have to settle with your 3rd, 4th option or worse if the Hawks match.   Hawks are in a position where they can afford to match max for John Collins and still extend Trae Young for max. Going after Collins is risky. Even if you're the Spurs or Thunder and you've got the cap to extend a max offer sheet, who's to say Collins would want to leave Atlanta where they just finished a rebuild, and go to a rebuilding team again for maybe $2m more a year?"
He’d 1000% take a buyout pay cut for that just like Blake Griffin did
Blake Griffin is usually the go-to comparison with this.
He’s 28. Big men have a lot shorter shelf life in the NBA. Look at demarcus cousins. He’s only 30. Look at Blake Griffin. Look at kristaps porzingus   3 months of rest before bubble should absolutely be brought up. Vets got a ton of much needed rest. Who knows if he would have gotten injured if season wasn’t suspended. Injuries can be random. But they happen more often as a player gets older.  You keep picking and choosing which games count as injuries and which ones don’t.  Fact is he’s missed over 20% of the games he has been eligible for. You can’t change that.
It don’t matter. Most people who were pissed at Blake and Griffin don’t even know the specifics of buyouts. They were mad the Nets got more big names. Keep that same energy cause Lebron was trying to form big 3s for the past decade
"Imagine somehow we get cp3. Then it would be cp3 vs harden.   That would be such a bonkers finals.   Lebron, Durant, CP3, Westbrook, AD, Harden, Kyrie, Blake Griffin, Steve Nash (shit he might suit up based off how crazy the leagues been)"
"those views never would have been popular, usually if a guy sucks you have to figure he'd suck anyway, except Blake Griffin clearly was just pretending to suck in Detroit and dunked soon as he got to the Nets, of course that is likely a rare occurrence and not the case for Love, he just really does suck."
"Nah this same energy wasn’t kept last year. Remember when Blake Griffin was an all-NBA, All star, HoFer and all that other shit."
Blake Griffin for free in a already stacked team and WB for half the Lakers team is basically the same thing
"Nobody gives a shit *how* the Nets acquired Harden, they obviously gave up almost every 1st rounder they had to Houston  People were losing their minds because a team that had Kyrie/KD was getting James Harden  The Blake Griffin one was ridiculous as Detroit basically paid him his money and let him fuck off to join any team he wanted. Nets didn't even have to do anything to get Griffin save for opening up a roster spot."
Cos we're going to pay Russell Westbrook 47 million dollars next year.  You're paying Blake Griffin $8.32 and a pack of cigarettes.
"Because, there’s another team you might know them who have Durant harden and kyrie. Not to mention Blake griffin as well."
I saw more outrage at Brooklyn signing the likes of Blake Griffin and Aldridge than about the Lakers getting someone who made an All NBA team every year but 1 from 2011-2020
&gt;The same Westbrook that has been passed around like a hot potato for the last 3 years is now suddenly some kind of legitimate superteam member at age 33?  It's the Blake Griffin special
Blake Griffin
Bruce brown on Lebron? AD will foul out Blake Griffin (Giannis played like shit that series). And Russ is eating Harden or Kyrie.
Blake griffin did ok on Giannis. Harden on Russ for fun and probably Brown on Lebron. Idk it’s hard to judge without knowing their defensive and the lakers offensive scheme especially if Lebron goes further to playing on the perimeter
fun fact:  Terance Mann (38.5) had a higher vertical at the combine than Blake Griffin (35.5).    Both pale in comparison to Keon (48).
I'm just going to be honest with you man. Russell Westbrook pulled a Blake Griffin on you guys. Ain't no point in tearing up his body for that.  Give Russ something to play for and see how many dunks he gets on a team with no shooters.
"Yeah, if Terrance Mann jumped like Blake Griffin."
You forgot Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge for KD
"Yeah, the fact that he wasnt wracking up offensive fouls and started using his arm length and stride to get around defenders was huge. Became unstoppable. I also thought Ayton was a tad slow reacting though. Like even Blake Griffin got squared up better"
"The Nets still have a rotation even without Jeff Green and Blake Griffin. The Lakers have to fill out their entire roster with vet mins. And at this point, why ring chase with the Lakers over the Nets? Big 3 &gt; Big 2.5"
"Chris Paul and Blake Griffin would get booed if they made appearances in LA, so there definitely was animosity back then. Back when the Clippers were just awful nobody talked or cared about them. From my perspective as a Laker fan, it's not like Clipper fans are insufferable or something, because honestly I never see any. It's the team itself being so insecure about how LA is a Lakers town, and how fans of other teams use rooting for the Clippers as a way to hate on the Lakers. That's what makes Laker fans hate the Clippers. A lot of people see the Clippers as the anti-Lakers or something, so it shouldn't be surprising that Laker fans don't like them."
"Fixed Fultz, can say we developed Penny hardaway shaq, dwight, jj redick, many others i can only remember clippers developing blake griffin"
Blake Griffin was huge for us last season and really turned it on when he got to Brooklyn
Lmao it’s like the old Blake Griffin commercial.   That game? All you do is dunk.   *That’s the point.*
"Jeff Teague, Iguodala, Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan and Andre Drummond. All-star lineup."
From the State of Oklahoma you mean. Blake Griffin went to University of Oklahoma and Cade Cunningham went to Oklahoma State University
"You forget they are still paying Blake Griffin 29 million this year, they have 33.7m in dead money   they are actually at like 100m right now with that"
First #1 pick from Oklahoma State since Blake Griffin.
Don't forget 2x Blake of the Year recipient Blake Griffin.
"By my count, in his first 4 seasons he'll have played with 13 all stars: Simmons, Embiid, Butler, Kawhi, Paul George, Kyrie, Durant, Harden, Blake Griffin, Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan, Chris Paul, Booker. Even excluding the couple has-beens that's amazing"
"People said I looked like Blake Griffin, but that was before my hairline decided to dip out lol"
Blake Griffin +defense -bunnies.
"No the hell thank you (not you specifically). The Nets have plenty of skills and talent, what they need is fight. Guys like Blake Griffin showed lots of fight this year and it made a big difference. I don't think Simmons would do the same."
Andre Drummond and Blake Griffin were more important than Kennard a year ago. And if you’re talking about the best prospect than Sekou Doumbouya and Bruce Brown were better assets I’d say.
Ben doesn't play with hustle though. He doesn't abuse his physical potential to its fullest. Ben Simmons should be able to become at least as good as young Blake Griffin offensively.  He is a finesse player that can't shoot. It's absurd and it obviously can't work.
"Blake Griffin, Andre Drummond"
Any player that has been bought out for less than the rest of the contract value.  Blake Griffin did this literally last season.
"If Blake Griffin can, a 23 year old who’s never worked with million dollar trainers and an NBA org plus already has good form definitely has a chance."
[Blake Griffin - helping people get stuff off of high shelves](https://youtu.be/q1xF8Alvv7o)
This probably inspired Blake Griffin to do his KIA dunk
Giannis played 1 other top 10 player this playoffs whose second best player was Blake Griffin let’s use some context please
It's the Blake Griffin corollary
"Depends if you are talking Birmingham where Blake Griffin lived, easily $1M+, but closer to Detroit maybe ~$700K for Grosse Pointe type of area for a nice house. Granted, I am assuming they don't want a 1000sqft home built in 1920s because Detroit and the surrounding areas are very old."
"A few better players than PG here taken first, but a “vast majority” aren’t better than him.  2020: Anthony Edwards 2019: Zion Williamson 2018: Deandre Ayton 2017: Markelle Fultz 2016: Ben Simmons 2015: Karl-Anthony Towns 2014: Andrew Wiggins 2013: Anthony Bennett 2012: Anthony Davis 2011: Kyrie Irving 2010: John Wall 2009: Blake Griffin 2008: Derrick Rose 2007: Greg Oden 2006: Andrea Bargnani 2005: Andrew Bogut 2004: Dwight Howard 2003: LeBron James  Yes you’re obviously shooting for the best player, but look at how many misses are there at the first pick. If you have a guaranteed Paul George there at #1, you take him in a typical draft."
That just isn’t true at all.  If someone like Blake Griffin can get traded after signing a five year contract to a team like the Pistons then Simmons has absolutely zero leverage unless he wants to retire.   Players don’t have that much power.  If they did we wouldn’t have 90% of the trades we do.
Pretty much every Blake Griffin highlight poster from his rookie year was an offensive foul.
Blake Griffin
Poirier catching lobs like it's Blake Griffin ? When did he get this in his bag
Blake Griffin was called a more athletic Carlos Boozer
Pardon My Take got Blake Griffin to tweet the eye emojis once just to fuck with people
"I wouldn't count him out yet. I think he's still starter quality if he can just stay healthy. He's just not anywhere close to a max contract player now, and it doesn't make any sense to have him start for us when we have young guards who need the ball in his hands to develop.  I can imagine him performing really well in a Blake Griffin type role for contending teams in a few years once he gets off his monstrosity of a contract."
"I mean, if Tillman can save 5-10 mil through a buy-out. He might do it considering no one is trading for John Wall. That's if Wall is willing to give the Blake Griffin discount to go join another team."
"Just send the Brooklyn Nets and we’d probably win   Claxton and DJ are perfect bigs for the international scene, and then obviously they have the big 3 and Blake griffin"
"I know what you mean, remember when the Clippers stabbed Blake Griffin in the back and then Kawhi refused to sign with them?  C'mon, I doubt that shit matters as much as most of y'all make it."
"Lifestyle creep is real. They're buying designer clothes, luxury cars, staying in multi million dollar homes, etc. You can go broke fast if you try to keep up with teammates and other stars around the league. Most NBA players minus the most popular ones have no other long-term contracts with other brands (Blake Griffin and Kia, Chris Paul and State farm to name a couple).   Not to mention many of these players have an army of leechers to feed as well."
"I misremembered Harkless for a second. DJJ is a better shot blocker as well, and a better defender. Harkless is a slightly better shooter and ball handler, I'll give him that.  You're attributing too much of the team defense to Aminu. Nurkic is and always has been our best defender. The defense fell apart because Nurk couldn't stay out of foul trouble in the playoffs and he had a terrible regular season.  You mean the roster that got swept by the Warriors how many times? The roster that beat a Clippers team without Blake Griffin and Chris Paul? The team ran it back with that rotation for 4 seasons and that experiment should've been cut after the NOP loss."
Yes. But he's not injury prone. He's coming off two major injuries. Those are different things. CP3 is injury prone. Blake Griffin is injury prone.
"I was going to push back on this, but I looked at the last 10 #1 picks and, you're pretty much right. Wiggins is probably the third worst behind Bennett and Fultz. Ayton and Edwards haven't made all-star teams, but it's pretty reasonable to believe they will, and it's unlikely Wiggins will.  Blake Griffin, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Anthony Bennett, Andrew Wiggins, Karl-Anthony Towns, Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz, Deandre Ayton, Zion Williamson, Anthony Edwards"
didn’t the same thing happen to Blake Griffin too? promised not to trade and got traded anyway
"He was probably worried about [the infamous Curse.](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/090624&amp;sportCat=nba) Thabeet ended up being awful, but it's not like Blake Griffin escaped unscathed, as [his knee exploded in his final pre-season game](https://youtu.be/QMDvYcnNxkg?t=6s) and he's been plagued by injuries throughout his career, still never having made it out of the second round."
"Good point on the consensus type top picks. Not all drafts are created equal. LeBron James was a sure fire top pick. AD, Blake, John Wall, Zion. There was never a reasonable debate for those guys, and they were all very good players at their peak. Wall and Griffin were derailed by injury.   This year, some people say there’s 3 guys who’d qualify for the top pick in many drafts. Which as a Pistons fan makes me a little gun shy that Mobley may end up being way better than Cade."
"From 1990-2019 * Shaq * Chris Webber * AI * Tim Duncan * LeBron * Dwight Howard * Derrick Rose * Blake Griffin * Kyrie Irving * AD * 2 of KAT, Simmons, Edwards, Zion will get there  So about 12/30 = 40% chance. If you want to be more conservative and count out Kyrie and say only 1 of Zion, KAT, Simmons, Edwards will get there still 33%. Thing is though Cade is much more hyped than your average 1st overall pick. The only players that I think match the hype in the last 10 or so years are Zion, Simmons, and AD. I’d give him a 2/3 shot of being top 10 at some point in his career."
"Joe Harris, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan when KD was out"
"Fultz was seen as the consensus first overall pick. There wasn't even a question about it. His pre-draft profile was insane, and he was thought of as on the same level Blake Griffin, Anthony Davis, and Greg Oden in terms of his level of being a sure thing. Dont let hindsight cloud the perceptions of the past."
Blake Griffin
"Gotta love how you don't say anything of substance and just repeated the same thing you originally commented, just in more words while also basically ignoring everything I laid out.   Here's a specific excerpt on his Lob City days per Kevin Arnovitz at ESPN:  &gt; After Paul exited for Houston, Clippers owner Steve Ballmer reached out to his former point guard. As a relatively new owner, Ballmer wanted to learn from his organization's mistakes and invited Paul to share his thoughts about the current state of the franchise and, more pointedly, his reasons for leaving. When the two met over breakfast, league sources say, Paul stated that Rivers was one of the contributing factors  &gt; The Clippers teams with a core of Paul, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan had a reputation for locker room drama and for perhaps not liking one another.  &gt; But multiple people from the organization indicated to Arnovitz that ""Rivers became as prominent a character in the workplace drama as Paul or Griffin or any other member of the roster. And as the authority in charge of managing sensitivities and arbitrating disagreements, Rivers increasingly grew entangled with the rest of the egos.""  &gt; The piece paints Rivers as something of a locker room politician who had ""a tendency to placate a player by telling him what he wanted to hear"" or even critiquing a player behind his back to another.  &gt; While a level of politicking is normal in any locker room, many Clippers reportedly saw Rivers as somewhat fake  [Source](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2769961-chris-paul-reportedly-told-steve-ballmer-doc-rivers-contributed-to-clippers-exit)  Didn't lose his locker room ""at all,"" huh?"
Blake Griffin :(
Blake griffin maybe because of taking the vet min
Hey! Blake griffin got in a lot of trouble for this!
yeah! fuck blake griffin
"Blake Griffin is Draft Class of 09, Ben Simmons is Draft Class of 16, Embiid is Draft Class of 14"
"""I work at a wendy's and stopped showing up but Blake Griffin gets a buyout!?"""
"Exactly. Like I thought what Blake Griffin did was disgusting (and somehow Draymond thought Blake was the victim lol), but at least Blake gave the Pistons one good year on that contract. What has Love done to deserve any of this contract?"
"I believe he was 1 of 4 replacements (Kobe, Wade, AD, Blake Griffin injured). And he was the only replacement for the East."
"He hasn't been a Laker since 2018. His dead money is still on their cap, but Deng is not a Laker anymore than Kemba Walker is a member of the Thunder or Blake Griffin is a Piston. Deng was bought out and went to go play for the Wolves after that and then he retired."
"If we're speaking technically, Deng is not on the Lakers, and hasn't been for a few years now. He's not a Laker anymore than Blake Griffin is on the Pistons. Once you buy someone out, that's it, they're no longer on the team. The Lakers also are no longer paying Deng as he would have already received his money. His dead money still counts against their cap this year, but that does not mean he's still a Laker."
Buddy plus Bagley for Saddiq Bey and Blake Griffin salary?
"Hahahah jesus christ did I get one of those ___ISGOAT twitter accounts here? I don't even know where to start.    &gt; his whole team was often hurt)  Yeah damn must be tough dealing with injuries  &gt; Was down 0-2 to the Clippers until CP3 &amp; Blake Griffin got hurt, then he basically won by default.  Literally just untrue(shocker).  Won game 3 with both CP3 and Blake, then CP3 went down in the 2nd half of the next game.  Btw we were starting Mason Plumlee, Al Faroq Aminu, and Mo Harkless   &gt; Then lost to the Warriors in 5 in the 2nd round, and never beat Curry in a game where Curry played (Dame was 1-2 vs the Dubs without Curry even playing)2017 - Swept in 1st round to Warriors. Still hasn't even beaten Curry in a game.  Yes god forbid he didn't do better starting Meyers Leonard, Mo Harkless, and AL farouq Aminu vs Steph Curry Klay Thompson Draymodn Green and Andre Iguodala   &gt; Swept in 1st round by.... AD &amp; the Pelicans. As a 3rd seed vs a 6 seed. When the Pels were missing their 2nd best player.  Got destroyed by Jrue/AD traps, this was the bad one.   &gt; Won in 1st round vs OKC, even though Westbrook &amp; PG aren't very good playoff performers it still was impressive. Credit to him.  Beat Paul George and Russell Westbrook with a center rotation of Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard and dropped 50 points and a game winner to send them home.   &gt; In 2nd round he barely squeaked by the baby Nuggets with CJ outplaying him half the time.  It's really pathetic how you try to characterize everything lmao.  Dame put up 25-6 and CJ put up 26-3 on the same efficienccy.  One of those guys gets doubled and draws the best defender.  And nice of you to ignore we were starting ENES KANTER vs Nikola Jokic.    &gt; Then got swept in the WCF vs the Warriors with no KD, blowing leads in every single one of them. Still hasn't beat Curry h2h in a single game btw, I'm noting this because it's crazy to me after realizing it.  ""With no KD"".  Yeah only left Curry, Klay, and Draymond vs Dame, CJ, and Meyers Leonard.  Fair battle! [Shocker chose to ignore he separated a rib in game 2](https://youtu.be/Nr4sFo16bNk?t=22)  &gt; Went off in the bubble that allowed his team to get healthy in the playoffs when they otherwise wouldn't  Yeah god forbid he carried a team starting Carmelo Anthony and Hassan Whiteside to the playoffs in the west lmao.  Stick Anthony Davis on that team and they win 20 games.    &gt;  Lost in 6 to the Nuggets missing their 2nd best player &amp; all their defensive guards.  ""All their defensive guards""? They were missing PJ dozier.  Unless you think Jamal Murray plays defense.  And Nuggets fans kept talking about how Facu would lock him up.  **Instead Lillard puts up 34 and 10 on 67% TS and 2 turnovers a game.  Read that again.  He outscored the MVP on better efficiency while doubling his assets and with less turnovers.**  All your list does is show how consistently Dame carries AWFUl teams to playoffs in the west, then plays significantly more talented competition"
"Dame had a better team than AD considering Jrue was hurt half the time in NOLA (his whole team was often hurt) and Boogie was hurt the 2nd playoff run he had, and he lost to the Warriors every time.  Still at least as impressive as Dame in context.... All of Dame's series where he was 1st option (after LMA left, and he took a step):  2015 - Lost in 1st round in 5 to Grizz  2016 - Was down 0-2 to the Clippers until CP3 &amp; Blake Griffin got hurt, then he basically won by default.  Then lost to the Warriors in 5 in the 2nd round, and never beat Curry in a game where Curry played (Dame was 1-2 vs the Dubs without Curry even playing)  2017 - Swept in 1st round to Warriors. Still hasn't even beaten Curry in a game.  2018 - Swept in 1st round by.... AD &amp; the Pelicans. As a 3rd seed vs a 6 seed.

And Blake Griffin on the Pistons
Not my team but I used to love Bazemore. Dude used to clown Blake Griffin all the time knowing Blake couldn’t retaliate because (at the time) he was never really seeing the floor.
He's not giving up the money. Already got a ring and doesn't seem like he has the drive anymore. This ain't Blake Griffin.

Blake “ The Common Denominator “ Griffin
"&gt;I believe they really did. They took a leaf out of Brooklyn's hat on how to defend him since Blake Griffin did a commendable job on Giannis but Giannis just had a slightly below par series vs the Nets (and only in away games).  Giannis averaged 32 and 13 on 57% shooting. Dunno if i would qualify that as ""below par"" lol. Also his only bad away game was game 2, he was pretty good in 1, 5, and especially 7 imo."
"Me too! Like, the kid is *insanely* good for how much he has to add to his game.   My take is that, the same way Blake griffin expanded his game in response to his injury trouble in 2013-15 seasons(adding a jump shot, becoming a killer passer) zion has all the tools to improve that way but not lose his athleticism."
"LeBron, Bowen, Jae Crowder, Blake Griffin, Duncan  All in their primes and Blake 2019 version where he shot 37 percent from 3"

"And? KD had less help and was facing elite defenders, not just Blake Griffin."
"Also just to add to your point, let’s not act like Blake Griffin was useless that series. He played better defense on Giannis than anyone else did the entire postseason, and games 5-7 he was was averaging 15 ppg on &gt;50% from the field"
"My all time favourite is the glorious [Dwight Howard/Stan van Gundy awkwardness. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y08gvGpGCwA)  Also the [Griffin/Jackson awkwardness. ](https://twitter.com/WorldWideWob/status/1088288982730002432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1088288982730002432%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sbnation.com%2Fnba%2F2019%2F1%2F24%2F18195697%2Freggie-jackson-blake-griffin-interview-pistons) Griffin saying "" It’s nothing to be proud of man, it’s just masking our issue."" While Jackson is clowning around."
"I’m pretty sure it was Blake Griffin too, possibly signing an autograph, so the joke is him giving away his Sharpie. I feel like it’s one if those things that would have been funny in person, but out of context in a video like this it’s more like, “Oh, yeah. Funny” than it is “haha” funny."
"Nah MJ deserved it. He averaged over 3 steals with almost two blocks per game while guarding the opposing teams best wings/guards and scoring 30+ per game. His defense is always overlooked because he’s the best scorer ever. If anything MJ deserved multiple DPOY awards. Go look at the steals, blocks, and opp fg% he held guys to. MJ was a menace on both ends. He wanted to get 40+ and hold your best player under 20. They don’t make’em like MJ/Kobe anymore! The best players don’t even guard each other nowadays. In the playoffs PJ Tucker guarded KD and Blake Griffin guarded Giannis. It was kind of disappointing watching them both avg 33+ and not consistently guard each other."
"Coach: Doc Rivers  PG: John Stockton (Scored in single digits multiple games in the finals with home court advantage never scored over 35, carried by Malone)  SG: James Harden. (Record for turnovers in a playoff game/series, all percentages drop in the playoffs, doesn’t show up in the biggest moments despite superstar status)  SF: Domonique Wilkins (Similar issues as James Harden showing up in crucial moments)  PF: Blake Griffin (Couldn’t get to the rim in the playoffs like in the regular season, effectiveness was way down and he was a big reason why the lob city teams under achieved. CP3 carried.)  C: Wilt Chamberlain (This will be unpopular because of his accolades but he was 2-4 in the finals, he played on great teams and routinely choked in the finals. More focused on getting his stats then making winning plays and team basketball. His Numbers were still great because of his height/athleticism advantage but when he played against Bill Russel his numbers and efficiency dipped and usually lost. He has all the individual awards and stats but with that level of dominance he should’ve showed up and won more championships when he had the opportunities. No way you’re the most statistically dominant player and get dominated twice as much as you win in the championship)."
Blake Griffin probably has some advice for Kawhi
Is this supposed to be a positive or a negative take?  Blake Griffin was a top 10 player in his prime.
Prime prime Blake griffin is top 7 PF oat
Do you not remember Chris Paul missing time and Blake griffin shooting up the mvp rankings because he was hard carrying the clippers…
"prime blake griffin was so goddamn hype, lob city never forget"
"I don’t dispute that. I’m saying the take that Zion will be like Blake Griffin is unpopular.  People act like Zion is already their, so to say he’s going to get hurt before he actually gets their is unpopular."
"&gt;	Ok here’s one: Steve nash never made a finals. Kd did.  KD hasn’t been past the first round without an all time guard doing the ball handling and playmaking. Sure, Durant’s a better defender but his team defense is poor (which coincides with his atrocious playmaking) and he never **ever** was the primary rim protector (ibaka, draymond, blake fucking griffin lol)  &gt;	all time great shooter and probably the best 6”11+ ball handler of all time.  If by best ball handler do you mean averaging a turnover per assist and shooting below **league average efficiency**?   Seems like you just like Durant because he has a smooth jump shot. What is the fact is that he turns the ball over a shit ton when asked to create and his efficiency plummets below league average anytime he doesn’t have a hall of fame guard setting up the offense in the half court."
Blake griffin was a better dunker than zion.
"Honestly I saw this one thrown around even at the time he was being drafted and always found it so strange. Not that I vehemently disagree with it or anything but just on the fact that people said he will ""only end up like Blake"" as if that was a bad thing or something.  Everybody expects the next LeBron or MJ every draft but those guys are generational all-time greats for a reason. They dont grow on trees and you wont find one every year in  the draft even with the most hyped prospects. For every LeBron, Duncan, and MJ you have a Bennett, Olowokandi, and Kwame Brown getting drafted high and completely busting, not even getting into the ""had a decent career so hard to call them a bust but still far from what you want out of a top pick"" tier with the Boguts of the world. When you look at the possibilities you can get out of a #1 pick, ending up with ""just Blake Griffin"" as opposed to LeBron is pretty fucking good when he just as easily could end up being Kwame. Yes its a little underwhelming given the hype but I think thats more on us (fans/media) for putting unrealistic expectations on pretty much every highly touted prospect coming into the league.   Blake was a legit MVP candidate in his prime (finishing 3rd one season only to LeBron and a historic season from KD), averaged 22/9/5 over a decade, was one of the most skilled guys at his position in the league, made 5 all-nba teams (probably woulda made more if not for injury) and was the cornerstone of a perennial 50 win team. If Zion ends up with ""only"" that resume its still a pretty damn good career and we should not consider him a disappointment for not living up to the unrealistic hype/expectations we put on his shoulders."
"its crazy to think that at that time some people didnt see that comparison, and then he became a top 5 player in the NBA, hell i wasnt even paying attention to him in 09, i really thought blake griffin was gonna destroy the league"
Zion will wind up like Blake Griffin
"If you want to get even more mad, go watch literally any Blake Griffin poster ever."
"Is the basketball hall of fame easy to get in compared to the standards of the NFL or MLB? I don't think you can argue it's not. Just by their very nature the basketball HoF is happy to let in guys just off their college resume while others lean so much more heavily on professional acumen. That alone is huge to your point.  That being said, where I'm departing from others on the matter is to say: so what? I doubt any of the players you listed are just bums, even the ones I hadn't heard of before. And while I acknowledge there is some importance in having some credential or statistical basis behind a players case, the way some of these arguments end up going (ESPECIALLY in baseball) seem to me like it's somewhat missing the point.  The basketball hall of fame, the hall of fame of any sport really, is a celebration of that sport and the people who made us love it. Manu Ginobili is not just an edge case for HoF based off the combination of Spurs titles+Olympic gold, he should in because he's Manu Fucking Ginobili. Do, for instance, Derrick Rose or Blake Griffin have a weaker case for HoF based on their body or work? Probably. Is there a reason to actively dislike their being there, hypothetically? I say no.  So to me the question isn't ""is the basketball hall too easy to get into"", it's ""are the other halls too hard to get into"""
"Step 1: Suck   Step 2: Draft Blake Griffin   Step 3: Petty David Stern gets us Chris Paul   Step 4: Owner says something racist and gets banned   Step 5: Profit    It's a really simple strategy, you should try it sometime"
If you don't see that then why did you include that made up idea in your post? You're trying to spin the Clippers as some organization that just stumbled onto Kawhi through being an 8th seed team post Blake Griffin. That's just wrong.
"Scottie had 24/6/7/2.3/1.3 on 63% TS, how's that no help!? You saying you'd rather have harden on a bum leg or 31 year old Blake Griffin than Scottie??"
"Yeah, they need to put into work. You can't really know how players would turn out in their careers. I remember reading back then they were calling the 2009 NBA draft as shallow with Blake Griffin as the consensus number one pick. Look at how the 2009 NBA draft class turned out."
"A veteran presence? The Lakers are the oldest team in the league. The Nets have three future Hall of Famers in their 30s, plus guys like DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin. Same for the Warriors with Curry, Klay, and Draymond.   All of these teams have multiple veteran guys who’ve won titles and more who’ve been in the playoffs multiple times, but you think they need to bring in a guy who can’t contribute to winning a title just because he’s old?"
"Perhaps you missed this part: ""the *57 players* in the USA basketball pool (not just the final roster) were subject to drug testing:""  [Here's the full list.](https://www.usab.com/news-events/news/2021/03/m-oly-finalists.aspx) In addition to the final Olympics roster, it includes players like LeBron, AD, CP3, Steph, Dame, Kyrie, Harden, Kawhi, Paul George, Westbrook, Butler, Lowry, etc. That's pretty much a who's who of prominent American players in the latter half of their careers.  Also, you've got the next generation of superstars in Trae Young, Tatum, Zion, Donovan Mitchell; then there's the class of guys who used to be elite and might be especially tempted to juice to battle the effects of injury or general decline: Kemba, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, K-Love, John Wall, Mike Conley, Gordon Hayward, and Dwight Howard. That's a whole lot of guys signing up for DUI checkpoints."
"He jus turned 29. I do agree he's not worth much. But in the NBA, probably more than any other league, over pays for names. In my opinion, Vic is probably a solid 6th man from here out. But again its the NBA, my Pistons jus paid Blake Griffin 60 mil to go the fuck away mid season.   I pray to God the Pistons don't make that offer, and I think weaver is smart enough not to, but some one will.   But think about it, Vic turned that offer down this off-season, in this situation. You don't think he gets a better offer if he's healthy?   What I think is happening, is Don Pat brought him in wounded. He's gona take care of him, and nurse him back to health on a vet min. If Vic works out, and is healthy, he gets him at a discount. If he doesn't get healthy, it didn't really cost Don Pat anything."
No one wants to be the next Blake Griffin
It’s wild.  I was looking at top shots and Blake Griffin is selling for pennies compared to guys that will never be as good as he was
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"I cant find the link but it was originally on this very subreddit not too long ago, Lana herself was complaining about said encounter on a podcast or something but originally didn't say who it was, only that it was a Brooklyn Nets' player. Everyone in the comments was guessing Blake Griffin or KD lol it ended up being KD"
"The argument that he wanted the extra year to secure the bag and maximize his earnings is a little questionable though, because Melo absolutely cost himself a third big contract in the twilight of his career (in contrast with peers LeBron and CP3) through his diva antics - unwilling to be a team player, adopt his game, and stay in shape.     If he cared so much about maximizing his earnings, he would've developed himself and his game so that he remained effective.     Instead, it is unquestionable that his ego and attitude lead to him being a marginal role player while CP3 and Bron continue to collect the paychecks and lead their teams. It's not even bad injury luck like IT3 or Blake Griffin either. Melo had been relatively healthy and with his size and skillset he should've been useful late into his career."
"jae crowder, blake griffin, boogie"
Half of Blake Griffin too right?
"Blake Griffin has several of those dunks that look worse on the replay because he just somewhat throws the ball in. Still pure violence and the angle required to make those “no touch"" dunks still means serious hops. Griffin before injuries is one of the most explosive players ever."
"Eh people hate pat bev, they hate/hated Paul George, but then again, people hated Blake griffin and cp3 during lob city too.   At one point, people were legit mad at Blake griffin for not punching people. Like Charles Barkley legit called for him to punch dudes to show he wasn’t soft."
"Darius Miles, Joe Johnson, Derrick Williams, Blake Griffin, Emeka Okafor"
"Blake Griffin. I don't personally hate him for what he did because I wanted him off the team regardless so we could go full tank and because Dwayne Casey basically took whatever was left of his knees and ran him into the ground for an 8th seed and the biggest margin of loss I've ever seen in a playoff series. I can definitely see how what he did was shitty tho, but it didn't bother me because it worked out in the end"
These are the last 17 years of #1 overall picks:  Cade Cunningham  Anthony Edwards  Zion Williamson  DeAndre Ayton  Markelle Fultz  Ben Simmons  Karl-Anthony Towns  Andrew Wiggins  Anthony Bennett  Anthony Davis  Kyrie Irving  John Wall  Blake Griffin  Derrick Rose  Greg Oden  Andrea Bargnani  Andrew Bogut  I think you take Jaylen Brown over all but 4 of those players. When you draft #1 you hope to get someone as good as Jaylen Brown when they are his age. Number 1 picks are nowhere near surefire.  You should be nowhere near expecting a #1 option on a championship team player with your #1 overall pick. Literally none of the people on this list have done that.

"He threw it in, a la blake griffin on Kendrick Perkins"
Would you say that Blake Griffin is any less of a good playoff performer because he never had any iconic runs but rather just a bunch of very good individual series?
I’m too lazy to post but the greatest dunks of all time is either the Blake Griffin on Steven Adam’s where he stiff arms him or the one miles bridges dunk where the commentator shit his pants.
[Blake Griffin “forgetting” how gravity works](https://youtu.be/x9VSi3V4EAo)  Edit: the salty cup toss at the end especially
"Problem is there’s no winning either way. See, for Blake Griffin and this one, people will do anything to I guess devalue it by referencing the non-call.  But when it does get called, everyone goes the other way and starts complaining about the highlight being ruined, or the league being soft. [Exhibit 1](https://youtu.be/WJwRlDFQNq8). Just look at the comments  So what I mean is there’ll be an unsatisfied bunch either way/"
*Blake Griffin in shambles*
"I think that not many fans could have preficted that Blake Griffin or LaMarcus Aldridge would have been on the buy-out market last year.  There's definitely going to be some names there this season, but as you said, Lakers (and Nets) are going to receive the first ringchaser applicant forms."
"Love : Not a first ballot HOFer, but he'll make it eventually  Blake Griffin : Jersey Retirement, but no HOF appearance.  Rondo : second ballot, after alot of fan outrage after getting snubbed from first ballot.  Rose : Ever played 2k MyLeague, and have a really young player win MVP ""The Creek Freak lol"", they'll always talk about the Rose Rule, which guarantees he'll make it to canton. I dont know if this rule is real, but even if it's not, I'll think he'll get in.  Aldridge : Yes, maybe even first ballot if he's lucky."
"Blake Griffin is what? Seriously, had no idea."
The only time I've ever seen someone get called for using the off hand on on a dunk. Blake Griffin did the exact same thing to Pau Gasol and got an and-1 out of it.
Prime Blake Griffin was so fun
1.	Derrick Rose  2.	Gerald Green   3.	Michael Beasley  4.	Blake Griffin   5.	David Robinson   Just pure athleticism these the guys.
Nobody speaks the spanish language better then Blake Griffin 🤣🤣
"Ding Ding...  Its why Players if they get drafted to Detroit will mess with it. Because most the players are Black and they can get comfortable with the city. The ones that struggled here were Grant Hill, which his family was from elite Black Society, and Detroiters didn't embrace him either, Blake Griffin, played the role, but he is from OKC (culturally different from the Great Lakes and was in LA for 10 years) you can tell he wasn't keen on being here but was professional.  Rasheed Wallace was open to his trade to Detroit, because Philly was a 75 minute Flight. He stayed in the Detroit Area until him and his wife divorced."
Blake Griffin is white.  He secretly perms his hair to pass for black.
I was wrong about Blake Griffin. He turned out to play a decent piece in the Nets team.
"I severely underplayed Brooklyn’s acquisition of Blake Griffin. Based on his past few years Detroit and his period of sitting out games last season, as well as buying into the narrative surrounding him at the time, I assumed he was completely washed and was just ring chasing and wouldn’t contribute in any meaningful way. But I was wrong, as he ended up being quite handy for the Nets."
PG and Blake Griffin were top 3 in MVP votes once too
Greatest in NBA history is a stretch. Giannis literally jumped over THJ and dunked it. And that was 2 years ago. Blake Griffin murdering Brandon Knight? Idk those are just a few from recent memory that are unreal
"This isn’t arguably the greatest. It’s good, very dangerous, but take away the defender who didn’t jump and it’s a dunk. Blake Griffin has like 3-4 that are better. LeBrons dunk on KG is better. Wades dunk on Varejao. Baron Davis’ dunk. Pippen on Ewing. Kobe on Dwight. Paul Georges in game, fast break 360 windmill."
"Ricky Rubio is interesting, he’s an old school pass first point guard. It seems like those types get more value in the playoffs today. I was listening to a podcast analyzing the 2009 draft and was shocked to hear he would have assuredly been a Top 3 pick and likely the 2nd pick but teams were afraid he wouldn’t come over for a couple years. They didn’t want to draft and stash a pick that high. One of the commentators even said he was considered a candidate for the top pick until Blake Griffin started getting a lot of traction."
The Blake Griffin trade
And Steve balmer threw basically a retirement party for Blake griffin after signing a extension and then promptly shipped him to Detroit so…
"Blake Griffin. I guess he could still make it but by the end of 2014 (which was his fourth full year) he was a 4× allstar, 3× All-NBA 2nd team, 3rd place in the MVP voting, one of the best if not the best ROY ever, an overrated but still iconic slam dunk champion, the annual answer to the GM poll ""who would you rather start your franchise"" question and featuring in every major NBA related commercial...  He has never truly played a ""full"" season ever since.  If it wasn't for his short lived Detroit comeback (and the accolades that came with it) I'm sure he wouldn't make it."
Blake Griffin for me.
"It happened on and off—taking college players who had been drafted but not yet played in the NBA:  Laettner in ‘92, no one in ‘96 or 2000, Emeka Okafor in ‘04, no one in ‘08, Anthony Davis in ‘12, no one since.  And remember, Davis was only on the squad as an injury replacement for Blake Griffin"
"Blake Griffin, Kevin Love, Paul Millsap, Draymond Green, Danilo Gallinari."
"at different times I was surprised to find out thatJason Kidd, Steph curry, Blake Griffin, Klay Thompson, and Devin Booker were black.  I guess I just never really thought about it too hard until someone pointed it out"
Blake Griffin isn't even close to being a top-10 PF all time.
I was really surprised when I found out about Blake Griffin
"Timmy D, Dirk, Karl Malone, KG, Blake Griffin, Kevin McHale, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Charles Barkley, Pau.. so probably not, but undoubtedly one of the most impactful players on winning ever. His role was never to carry the scoring load. Dudes a future HOF without a doubt"
Blake Griffin?
"I don't think he goes first overall. Small, can't shoot threes. But still top 5.   Another thing nobody is mentioning is that he was a 21 year old sophomore when he got drafted. The last non-freshman to go #1 was Blake Griffin.  Teams dig young guys."
"He's as much a star at this point as Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Paul Millsap... Aja he used to be one but now isn't"
"I mean yeah the benches are roleplayers are all washed, but the big 3 for both teams are still gonna be fine.  Yeah, ad and Kyrie are injury prone, but you've still got LeBron, KD, harden, and even Westbrook (even if he isn't elite like he once was he's still very good)  Who cares if fucking Dwight Howard or Blake Griffin misses time due to injuries lol"
I agree. If he doesn't get more fit soon he's gonna fall off a lot faster than Blake Griffin.
"Blake Griffin should shake Steve Ballmer hand every chance he gets in thanks for overruling the front office and gifting Griffin a huge deal he was never likely to play up to. If Griffin wanted control over where he was going to play he should have signed a one and one. Instead he has millions more dollars now. I wish someone would ""fuck me over"" like that.   Not that I have anything against Blake personally. He was a consummate pro in Detroit and more effective than I thought he would be. And the monumental stupidity in trading for him might have been what shook our dumbass owner out of the certainty that he knew his ass from a hole in the ground and put the franchise on the road to Fade for Cade."
"It's not a weird stat. He is catching all of the blame even though Embiid shit the bed with a 4/20 shooting performance in Game 4 (and was clearly impacted by the injury - definitely not his fault), Doc was god awful all series, and Seth Curry was the only role player that really showed up for the full series. Doc is pulling his classic ""anybody but me"" routine. Guys like Ray Allen, Blake Griffin, Montrezl Harrell, and even Tim Duncan when he could have signed with the Magic are just collateral damage for him. Fuck Doc Rivers.  Simmons has a ton of faults, but he is still a plus-player by any stretch and brings a ton to the team. Morey asking for the farm in return is probably because his analytics have him as a massive boost to the team overall."
"If Ibaka is the only center in the west that Simmons can defend, then they aren't even getting to see Blake Griffin in the finals. Draymond has trouble with some centers but that translates into winning basketball still."
Those are bully ball centers who even Draymond has trouble with but if the opposing team is trotting out blake Griffin or Ibaka at centers then i don’t see how Simmons would struggle considering he spent a ton of time guarding 4s this year.   It could work depending on the matchup imo
"Love always seems to play bad against the Warriors tbf, even when not concussed. Wasnt exactly lighting them up in 2017 or 2018. I think Draymond is just a terrible matchup for him, kinda like Blake Griffin."
Certainly not overall but in the last few years Blake is a better player than Melo. Last year Melo played better but he also played a larger role. I would rather have Blake Griffin over Melo but we have Melo now and I hope I'm wrong.
"Seriously, dude won his only title in 26 games, and anyone could’ve coached that Boston team to a title. Dude went to 7 games against a Hawks team that 1, had no business being in the playoffs, 2, had a worse record than the 11th in the West Kings, and 3, only beat out 9th in the East Pacers by a game.   I get on him a lot because he is always called a great coach by the media.  He was great with those non-stars Clippers, but when he has had stars, he has done nothing since Boston. And I am not excusing the Chris Paul injury in 2015 or Blake Griffin injury in 2017. The only one I give him a pass for was 2016."
"Gonna be interesting to watch Blake Griffin, LMA, Kevin Durant guard Lebron, AD and Dwight"
The thing is they have blake griffin and millsap and LMA now. They have enough size for all playstyles. Their bench is kinda nasty with mills too.
James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Kevin Durant  Blake Griffin  LaMarcus Aldridge  Patty Mills  Joe Harris  Paul Millsap  vs  one balding boii   lmfao the audacity
"Yeah because it was super clear that Rodman's antics were both a cry to be traded and his play was due to the fact he hated being there.  It's like Blake Griffin in Detroit this last season, he just didn't give a fuck."
"Real talk though, that was huge. His ownership tenure was this weird black cloud over the league that we essentially ignored because the Clips were so bad for all of it (pre-Blake Griffin era).  Everyone in the league hated Sterling: owners, fans, players. He had a long track record of being a creepy racist. But he was stubborn and obviously being an NBA owner is a ton of clout among the super-rich circles, so he was never going to sell."
The most in their prime star studded finals.  In reality it’ll be a lot of Nets BIG 3 Joe Harris and Blake Griffin vs Lakers Big 3 plus shooters as the older guys are all bad defensive players outside of Dwight.
How much help does Blake griffin need?
Blake griffin absolutely hates the clippers for trading him away after doing that whole hanging his jersey in the rafter show.
"Seriously, it's still Westbook, Lebron, Anthony Davis, Kyrie, Harden and Durant along with Carmelo, Dwight, Rondo, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus and Paul Millsap, all in one series.   Even with a bunch of these guys as old as they are it's still a crazy matchup."
"I was talking about Patty, Blake Griffin and LMA last year. It might be more of an emotional response at this point."
this is gonna be another blake griffin situation  he's gonna look great on brooklyn
"Blake Griffin is *absolutely* underpaid, but in fairness you're right that's not plural."
"I don’t think it moves the needle much for the team. Seems like a bit of a downgrade from Green in a vacuum, but considering the roster construction it’s just a really good deep bench signing.  IMO, Blake Griffin insurance improves their playoff durability, but not necessarily title odds 🤷‍♂️"
Milsap is washed.  Did you see him last year?  This isn't a Blake Griffin situation either.  He was on a contender and tried his best he just can't play D anymore.  Age caught up with him.  I hate saying this too cause I really like him
"Ancient Zaza &amp; Dwest (who was very good for the team tbf) are not really comparable to Blake Griffin, LMA, Patty Mills, Millsap....the Nets are getting a much higher caliber of FA/buyout talent"
yea you drag detroit to the playoffs and THEN join brooklyn. the blake griffin way.
There many teams that could’ve actually used him. BKN isn’t really one. He’ll just be insurance for a blake Griffin injury as a backup playoff 5. And even if Blake gets hurt still there’ll be a lot of Claxton and Durant at 5 min in May and June anyway
shocked nobody here's said Kevin Love yet. yeah he's still on the Cavs payroll but it's obvious his heart isn't in it anymore.   but who knows? he might pull a Blake Griffin if he ever leaves cleveland.
"Pistons traded for a pretty banged up, maxed out Griffin, made an 8th seed playoff (sweep, Blake was playing injured) spot one year and then couldn't really play him any more and then waived him."
He probably would be if Love got bought out.   Love's got no incentive though compared to someone like Blake Griffin who's very clearly ring-chasing. Love's been an All-Star already and was a core part of a championship team - it's his time to collect the bag.
"Dude went toe to toe with in-his-athletic-prime Blake Griffin and came out on top more often than not. Zbo was a fucking monster, and anyone whose team played him in the playoffs was nervous"
CJ McCollum is probably your best deal to target. Simmons then has to commit to being the Clippers Blake Griffin-Esque PF for the Blazers. Cos a starting lineup of Dame/Powell/Covington/Ben/Nurk with Simons and Nance off the pine really ain’t half bad
"Doc is really good at finding other's to blame. It's actually crazy how many players get turned on when he is the head coach. Ray Allen, Blake Griffin, Montrezl Harrell, Ben Simmons.. losing Tim Duncan from joining the Magic. ""We"" against ""Them"" seems to be a locker room theme with him."
*Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin in the beginning could only dunk and do lay ups but he changed his game and can shoot. Even Ricky Rubio has a respectable jumpshot now! Simmons needs to stop playing a victim and actually work on his offense.
"That somehow  Pippen's 1994 season is a hall of fame level achievement or solidifies him as a top 20-30 player.   He averaged 22/8/6 on 48/32/66 shooting.  So wasn't exactly lighting up the stat sheet.  He led the Bulls to the second round of the playoffs. Something 8 teams do every year. Other #1 options that have led their team as far as Scottie include Donovan Mitchell, Demar DeRozan, John Wall, Joe Johnson, etc.  He was a distant 3rd in MVP voting with around 15% of votes behind David Robinson averging 30/11/5/3 and Hakeem with 27/13/4/4 on the two top teams. Other players who have come third for MVP or better include Paul George, Jermaine O'Neal, Blake Griffin,  Grant Hill, and Penny Hardway.  Basically everything adds up to Scottie being about as good as your Paul George/Jimmy Butler type of player. Which is still really really good. Yet people act like his 1994 season was one of the best individual seasons ever. As if Robinson and Hakeem were not absolutely the best players in the league those non-MJ years."
"SVG for you.  Same guy who traded away Dinwiddie for pretty much nothing, overpaid Jon Leuer, and traded for Blake Griffin giving away our first and the awesome contract Tobias Harris had."
"He's the PG version of Blake Griffin. If he gets bought out, he'd be a good value on a min, but trash on his current contract."
"I may sound lame here, but did the Rockets really try to brawl with the Clippers, or was it just an innocent prank and Blake Griffin overreacted by calling the police?"
Blake Griffin had a crazy one like that
"dawg, every summer we get pratice footage of simmons shooting threes thinking he's going to start taking them. The season comes along and he's still petrified of taking them in game. You can shoot a million threes in practice but if you don't shoot them in games, you're not going to get any better.   Blake Griffin and Giannis are perfect examples of this. Were horrible shooters, repped them in practice and shot them in games. They started shooting them in game and over time got a lot better at it."
"Blake Griffin has done it as well and it was a lot cleaner, MJ hacked the hell out of that shot. Still insane to watch in slow mo how he has time to think ""oh ok if I turn around I can just block him coming down"""
"His time with Kobe ruined his shot selection. He goes inside the perimeter to shoot uncontested 2s, and fires up contested 3s. And the shot mechanics are hard to watch. Reminds me of Blake Griffin trying to push the ball at the apex. Ugly!"
Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin probably
"I dont get it, what about KD and Blake Griffin? You clearly don't mean starter in the east since you are including Dwight Howard."
Because he's probably a lot cheaper than a superstar that didn't get posterized by Blake Griffin.
Embiid P.J. Tucker Marcus Smart Gallinari Portis Blake Griffin Jahlil Okafor Rudy Gorbert Jae Crowder Patrick Beverley KAT Draymond Green James Johnson Steven Adams Hassan Whiteside Montrezl Harrell
"Bron was able to team up with d. Wade and Bosh. He also got to recruit A. D.. Kevin Love is the only star talent outside of that and Love has always been injured or underperformed. Shaq must be mentioned too. But by the time Shaq reached Cleveland he was also on a downslope.  Kawhi played with a DYNASTY so he didn’t need to recruit. He then forced his way to play with Toronto, which was an amazing choice for him. He then recruited PG13, who is probably better than everyone not argued AD. D Wade was hobbled by the time the Heatles formed so I take PG.  Kobe was able to force pickups of Gasol, Dwight, SHAQ, Gary Payton, and Karl Malone.   KD was able to join maybe one of the best teams we’ve ever seen. He then was able to recruit Kyrie, James Harden, Blake Griffin, and Lamarcus Aldridge.  Bron has done nothing unprecedented with his recruiting. No “elite talent” wanted to go to Cleveland. If Bron played with the talent/fits that Kobe and KD have then he’d have more rings."
"They really just need their big 4 to be contenders, so getting to hang on to Blake Griffin and add Patty Mills is huge for them. I’d give them an A too"
Poor Blake Griffin.
do u know the difference between a hooper and a basketball player? tim duncan has no bag. blake griffin is a hooper. tim duncan is a basketball player. kyrie irving is a hooper. joe harris is a basketball player. this is a well established concept im not making this up
"I think Nets are one of my favourites for 'winning' the offseason. Getting Blake Griffin back on a minimum makes me extremely bitter, Patty Mills should hopefully be a strong addition, but really all they needed to do was get KD/Kyrie/Harden to sign extensions and it's looking like they have so far.  That said, Jeff Green is a bigger loss than a lot will recognise imo."
"I remember a similar story a long time where Blake Griffin's trainer was talking about how they were training him to recover as fast as possible basically, like how fast could his max elevated heart rate get back down to resting levels. [I think this was the story](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/how-clippers-uber-talent-blake-griffin-went-from-sideshow-to-superstar/). He got it down to like 45 seconds between max heart rate and resting which is crazy"
Blake Griffin Joe Harris Bruce Brown big three better imo. Offensive rating of 133 in 19 games
Nah people use the term washed when a player doesn’t really provide value or minimal value but Blake griffin has had some important and big performances for the nets.
"Good is from which perspective you're looking from. It's good from a team perspective since teams get control back, but bad from players' perspective. Like you said, the players association wouldn't agree to this.  An alternative I was thinking about is putting the limit on buyout players you are able to sign to 1. The favorable destination teams would then have to be more careful in waiting for the buyout market to develop and players would have to negotiate buyouts earlier if they want to go to a favorable destination.  For example, Nets got Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge last year. They would've only been able to get 1 in my alternative."

Blake Griffin at 4 &amp; AD @ 5.
"At least the Lakers aren’t objectively favorites to make the finals, there’s some competition. In the East it’s the nets and nobody else unless the nets get hurt.  IMO the most infuriating thing about the nets is Blake Griffin. They got a starter/6th man for nearly free because he either pretended to be injured or just didn’t care in Detroit.  I think that the league needs to at a minimum make the cap hard but allow for ways to discount players towards the cap (rookie contracts don’t add to it, extensions add 2/3rds, etc).  Stopping vets for signing the minimum with championship favorite teams would be a good addition too, making it so that if a player gets offered a contract worth say 2x the minimum, they have to take it over a minimum offer."
"Lol when you have to go back to Mike Dunleavy ouch.  He pulled Booker down, no it was not a smart play but it also wasn't as bad as CP3 pushing him mid air or Blake Griffin constantly pushing people in mid air.  Yes you box out a rebound regardless of whether a player is in mid air rofl.  You don't just give up offensive boards because a point guard has left their feet."
"See this is the thing. If the Nets win it all who gives a fuck if they formed some super team or beat halfass injured squads. Should we wait for every team to magically heal up each round before commencing the next round? Should we wait for a less stacked team to sign Blake Griffin off waiver before starting?  People who cry about their team being injured (if Kyrie/Harden weren't injured), asterix championships, blah blah like that other Nets fan are just a bunch of fucking sore losers. Yea they would probably beat the Bucks with a healthy team but they didn't. So shut the fuck up, stay healthy and beat them when it really matters instead of all these if's, but's whatever."
Blake Griffin has better handles than both
PG: Chris Paul  SG: Kyrie Irving  SF: LeBron James  PF: Blake Griffin  C: Nikola Jokic
Blake Griffin is a better ball handler than AD and Giannis at the 4 spot
1st team all-highlight Kyrie  Kobe  KD  Blake Griffin  Hakeem Olajuwon  2nd team Magic  Jamal Crawford  Dr J  Shawn Kemp  Shaq  Obviously this is my personal taste
"Shawn Kemp, Blake Griffin, Vince"
We were saying the same thing about Blake Griffin in Detroit
"Yep. Nobody wanted Blake Griffin or Andre Drummond at $35 million per year. The proof is they were put on waivers after being bought out and anyone willing and able to pay that could have just grabbed them. But people were willing to get them for just the minimum. If you make it so people getting them have to pay their full salary, then nobody will want them, so they won't agree to be bought out. Which situation is better: what OKC did with Kemba or what is going on in Cleveland with Kevin Love? Cause what everyone is proposing here will just ensure that we end up with a bunch of Kevin Love situations on teams all over the league."
"And Blake Griffin is an extremely uncommon one. He had to give up more than $10 million to make it happen, and he’s the most impactful player from the buyout market in recent memory. Most buyout guys end up being duds"
"At varying points Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Anthony Davis were all better than Love and it wasn't close at the time, though people pretended it was."
"As a Pistons fan would Detroit be better off if Blake Griffin was still there this year finishing out his max contract? Because all this stuff you guys are talking about would basically make it so players like him would never agree to a buyout as there would be no market for them once bought out. They'd all end up like Kevin Love, just taking a huge salary, not really contributing, but still having to be managed by the coaching staff because he's still on the team."
"&gt;the team that picks them up should pay their full due salary.   All that would do is mean that none of these players would get signed elsewhere, which means they'd never agree to being bought out. The buyout is there because both the team that's paying these guys and the player getting paid are unhappy with the situation and are looking for a solution that satisfies everyone.   If someone like Blake Griffin or Andre Drummond were only eligible to be signed by teams last year who could pay their full max salary then they would never have been bought out and would have just continued to rot on their old teams, because nobody wanted to pay those guys that money. If they were worth their contracts, then they'd be trade fodder. This is typically for overpaid vets on the last year of their deal who are languishing on a lottery team. Just making them have to stay there isn't beneficial to anyone involved."
None of these buyouts should elicit that reaction. The Blake Griffin type buyouts I get (or even Andre Drummond if he didn't turn out to be complete dogshit).
"I don't know which games you're referring to, but I hope you realize that Blake Griffin doesn't guard free throws lmfao. TS is a heavily FT influenced stat"
"I mean yeah he had a lot of points because he took alot of shots, 49ts%, 47ts%, 56ts% in 3 straight games against Blake Griffin is hardly impressive."
"He only played with 1 other all star in Kyrie for the first 3 games and he won 2 of them convincingly and almost won the 3rd. Harden played like 6 seconds fully healthy  While Middleton and Jrue were not all stars, they are still on that caliber and a huge upgrade over Blake Griffin or Harden on one leg"
Kawhi was the best. Giannis was struggling to score on Blake Griffin.
I will say that most of the washed players really aren’t expected to do much every game as compared to the Nets. Blake Griffin got too gassed for example because he was doing more than he could reasonably do   I think their gameplan is literally to avoid injuries to Lebron and AD during the regular season
This is one of the weakest of the weak.    I mean you don't need to be a basketball genius to know the corpse of Blake Griffin &amp; Landry Shamet (literally watched him play all last year) aren't good defenders.   Or see how the Clippers without Kawhi-Ibaka were 1 Ayton tip away from going up 3-1 to the Suns.
"Even if that's true, they're getting uncomfortable because you're bringing it up... out of nowhere... with no good reason... and looking like a dumbass while doing it.  A bi racial guy can be ugly and have it not be because of his race it's okay bud lmao  Do you think people on this sub just think every bi racial player is ugly or something?  Do you see people talking about Ben Simmons?  Shall I name some more?  Blake Griffin, Steph Curry, The Ball brothers, Michael Porter Jr, Zach Lavine, if we go a little farther back Jason Kidd and Kris Humphries.  You see anyone saying they're goofy looking or ugly?"
Oh man Nolan Smith. One of the only Dukies I ever liked.    Anyone know or remember why Blake Griffin was ranked as low as he was?
"Did you watch Milwaukee-BKN?  Milwaukee was barely and I mean barely able to run any offense against Brooklyn's backups, they had Blake Griffin on Giannis ffs, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, Joe Harris, 1 legged Harden, KD who has never been anywhere near an elite defender, dude Nick Claxton who has played 47 NBA games was their #1 defender.    Bledsoe wasn't the problem &amp; they likely still win the Finals w him, this was a down year for the NBA with injuries."
"Genuine question and not necessarily pointed at you, but I wonder if he actually have no athleticism left or is this Blake Griffin all over again."
"It's gotta be Lakers right? LeBron and Melo were very good for rookies, Dwight was already averaging a double double and 1.7 blocks, Westbrook was alright as a rookie.   But Rookie Blake Griffin with young KD and Kyrie tho 👀  I don't know who'd be the worst but in this hypothetical the Bucks would be paying $40m to a guy who averages 7 points on 41% shooting lmao"
Nets have Blake Griffin and Kyrie. They would win.
"Completely agree bro  An uber athletic scorer that can hit the midrange wouldn't do shit in the modern NBA. Oh wait, wasn't Demar Derozan all nba during his prime? Blake Griffin was an MVP candidate once right?"
"&gt;Blake Griffin is the Brooklyn Nets' starting C and spent a some of the series against the Bucks' being the second best player on the team.   Blake was the second best player on a team that lost in the second round. If the Nets had been fully healthy they probably would have won the championship, but Blake definitely would not have been the second best player on that team."
"Jesus christ, Blake Griffin."
Lmaooo soooooo Blake Griffin and Dwight Howard doesn’t exist?
The only highlight play I’d ever seen with Kendrick Perkins is the Blake Griffin dunk. That should say everything about Kendrick Perkins’ basketball career. Carry tf on…
"The cap hit is there either way, it’s about some minor cash savings, open roster spot and good will to players/agents in a year you aren’t contending anyways. Your argument could’ve applied to Blake Griffin and many other buyouts as well."
"He’s not going to play on this Cleveland team so I’m with him. 2 years from now if he’s healthy he can be Blake Griffin on the Nets, why not"
"&gt; also there is no world in which kevin love at 35+ gets 7 million  Kevin's 32 lol.  &gt;Blake would not have gotten 7 this year.  I think 5-7 was a pretty reasonable range for Blake if he hadn't wanted to go back to Brooklyn.   &gt;And he is not getting a Blake griffin type buyout, griffin took the team to a playoff berth and played injured in the playoffs themselves.  Buyouts aren't rewards lol, they're based on whether the team wants you out or not and whether you want out or not.   Blake wanted out and the team wanted him out, so they did 13.3 million, Kemba wanted out and OKC was indifferent, so he gave up 20 million. Love wants out and especially post-Markkanen, Cleveland wants Love out too, he's much closer to the Griffin end of the spectrum.  &gt;like I said before, the man has multiple people working for him, if it was easy to make that money back he would have done so  It literally just became actionable lol."
"LA just stated that they are looking to fill out the remaining roster spots with young players, kevin does not address any of their needs.   also there is no world in which kevin love at 35+ gets 7 million. Blake would not have gotten 7 this year.  And he is not getting a Blake griffin type buyout, griffin took the team to a playoff berth and played injured in the playoffs themselves. Kevin has just straight embarrassed the front office for giving him that contract.  like I said before, the man has multiple people working for him, if it was easy to make that money back he would have done so, he's obviously miserable in Cleveland.  oh yeah and he also has a tribeca home featured on AD multiple times, so if he was to leave he would be looking more at the nets."
"See Blake Griffin/Clipper fiasco and Lamar Odom/Pau gasol Laker fiasco, or the IT/celtics situation . That’s why I can’t hate on Bryce Harper when Washington gives him shit. He did it for the money, for himself and for Da Rock. Loyalty is a good trait but can also bite you In the ass"
"It’s surprising how fast all-star players can turn into role players like Blake Griffin, Kevin Love, Cousins, etc. before they even get old."
Some people are willing to give up a lot of money if it means they can compete. Look at Blake Griffin.
Blake Griffin and how the Clippers shipped him off to Detroit is a perfect example. Or how IT played his heart out for the Celtics and got fleeced at the end of it.
oh shit you're right. I thought it was one more year.   Would still be almost double the Blake Griffin buyout!
"he is owed $140 million!!! Like, the Blake Griffin buyout was obscene and this would be *twice* that!"
"This is my hottest take I guess but I don’t think KD was undoubtedly the best player on the floor, he and Giannis were roughly equal.  KD *looked* better because he was hard carrying and taking all the shots while the Bucks were still playing team ball and that’s what people focus on but the results were very similar. People also *wildly* overrate the disparity in support casts because KD was doing so much and the Bucks should have been much better on paper, but again as far as actual performance goes there wasn’t a big difference.   We had two bench players play themselves out of the rotation because they were so bad while also missing a starter, it was Lopez’ worst matchup and consequently worst series of the playoffs, Holiday played great defence but he was doing it on an injured James Harden who wasn’t doing much anyway while he put up Bledsoe-tier shooting splits, and Middleton disappeared every time we played in Brooklyn.  On paper Jrue/Middleton/PJ/Lopez/Portis/Connaughton takes the fattest shit on the cast KD had around him, but all those dudes fuckin sucked and while KD’s cast certainly didn’t turn into world beaters they played alright. And in the one game KD actually won without Kyrie he had Jeff Green and Blake Griffin absolutely turning into world beaters for the night.  Giannis carried the fuck out of the Bucks in that series, it’s no coincidence the one actually bad game he had we lost by 40. But in the modern NBA nobody gets credit for a carry job if they’re not spending half the game isoing at the top of the key and their support cast still looks ok on paper."
"Yeah, Millsap, Blake Griffin, and Patty Mills are def in their prime"
Shawn Kemp &gt; Blake Griffin
The color was great. Having Cream City written across your chest was not haha. I remember Giannis and Blake Griffin got into it a little bit. Kinda hard to be tough wearing Cream City
"You heard it here first boys :  Blake griffin, Millsap, James Johnson are in their prime!"
MVP Derrick Rose  should at least get an honorable mention and young Blake Griffin
"Zion is the next Blake Griffin, in my opinion with no fortune telling ability."
Blake Griffin and Ben Simmons were hyped even after missing their entire rookie seasons IIRC
&gt; How you gonna build hype for a player that does not play.  Blake Griffin... Joel Embiid...
Blake Griffin.  I know this number will include midrange shots but through his stint on the Clippers 94% of his total shots were two pointers. He came into the league as an ultra athletic dunker
"Blake Griffin is a former All-NBA and All-Star player, at 32 he should still be at his prime or near his prime. If it wasn't for his injuries, he would still be getting accolades at his age. He has the role 37yo former All-NBA have at age 32."
Blake Griffin probably dunked every day in practice and then he reads these comments on social media saying he can't dunk anymore and hes like wtf.  Its good to see JJ and Blake still talking after Lob City.
KD Bron Harden AD Kyrie Russ Joe Harris  Nunn  Blake griffin  Patty Mills
*[Serious] Is it time to be concerned about Blake Griffin?*
"blake griffin hasn't dunked in over 2 months, why isn't anyone talking about this?  has he given up on brooklyn?"
Blake griffin got a massive child support ruling. It was like 250k per month and the girl was already getting child support from Matt Leinart.   Girl is gonna end up worth 10s of millions for having a couple kids it insane.
"Blake Griffin was 3rd in MVP voting that year, no? He was unbelievable in his prime, such a solid all around game. Love big men who can pass and facilitate like him which nobody else on this list can do. He just didn’t have the 3 point shot quite yet."
[Blake Griffin on Perk is way up there.](https://youtu.be/d8vbdA0wGuI)
"He’s in street clothes on the bench. He was hyping up Blake griffin saying draymond can’t guard him, which lead to the comeback."
"Yeah he was talking shit from the bench from the tip-off.  Which is the part everyone misses from this: Pierce was a first ballot HOFer in his final season, and he’s being dropped from the rotation so that you get guys can get minutes.   Instead of bitching about it he’s standing up on the bench hyping up a Blake griffin free throw less than a minute into the game."
"But GSW would still have room in cap space so they would probably sign someone else, i mean not as good as KD but Jrue Holiday, Hayward, Ibaka, Gallo, Cp3, Blake Griffin... Were all free"
Hot take but I'd far rather a player request a trade on year one of their contract rather then telling the org they plan on resigning and then leaving them with nothing.   If KD had shown indication of wanting out there was a report we couldve had Blake Griffin at the trade deadline and potentially more assets. He clearly thought he couldn't win with those cats so if he had given us a heads up like PG just imagine the position we would've been in now.
"Actually, the two best examples are Blake Griffin and Karl Malone. Neither was a good midrange shooter in their rookie years. They spent seasons working on it just to be respectable. People have hope Simmons can follow the path of these two, but this can only be accomplished through actual attempts in the game. Simmons doesn’t need to be good, just willing."
"Kyrie, Ibaka, Jalen green, Blake griffin, MPJ  Trae young take is borderline egregious."
"Bro how is Lonzo's transformation just a tweak? Did he not completely change his mechanics? His arm angle changed by 90 degrees lol if that's not a major transformation then nothing is. Pre-NBA stats don't tell the story at all. His first three years in the NBA he shot 39/34/49. And a 48.5 TS%. So whatever worked for him in high school and college did not work for him whatsoever at the pro level. He didn't fix his shot with just a tweak, it was a methodical transformation. So what does a reworked Ben Simmons shot look like? His form is not as terrible as Lonzo's was. If Lonzo did it, what is stopping Ben Simmons from working to improve it? Does he not want to even try?  Blake Griffin is another good example. He slowly worked on improving his form and extended his range, year by year. Didn't take a complete transformation, it just took years of work and good shooting coaching."
I'm only suggesting this because the recent Blake Griffin podcast.
The only toxic thing about is is that it feels like most of our fans hate Blake Griffin :/
"Nah man Detroit has some of the chillest fans on r/nba. They aren't ever stressing about anything. Most like Blake Griffin for what he did, but everyone can be a little bitter when a player leaves and suddenly looks like a different player on a different team."
"the Nets have Claxton, Lamarcus Aldridge, Blake Griffin and Paul Milsap, there was just no space for him there, at least with the Lakers he can share playing time with Dwight"
Nets  _______________  PG: James Harden  SG: Paul Pierce  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Blake Griffin  C: Lamarcus Aldridge  6th man: Jason Terry
"&gt;LeBron could have just said ""No thanks, I'm committed to moving on""  I'm pretty sure that's what happened but do you think Riley would stop without actually trying to convince James?  If there was even a 0.01% chance Riley just needed to meet with James to change his mind I'm sure this is what occurred. DeAndre Jordan with CP3 and Blake Griffin stopped the Mavs trade.  I'm convinced LeBron learned from The Decision not to repeat that same mistake, I'm going to go out on a limb saying Riley probably thought to himself ""just give me 5 minutes with him, that's all I need!"". LeBron was already in Vegas wining and dining on his own dime... it's not the same where free agents travel to you for perks."
"Same reason Blake Griffin wanted out of Detroit. You don’t have to live in Cleveland in the winter, you get to play for the Lakers in LA where he went to college, and compete for a championship."
"""Alongside all-time playmakers like LeBron James, Russell Westbrook and Rajon Rondo the veteran is bound to put up more than 10 PPG off the bench. If this elevates the Lakers to having one of the best teams in the league, this can have the Nets punching the air in regret.""  Idunno man I think I'd still rather have Blake Griffin and LMA."
Yeah you’re not gonna convince anyone ever that the Mav’s problem was that Luka Doncic had the gaul to put up 37.5 ppg on 57 TS while being guarded by 2 of the best perimeter defenders of the generation.   That’s like saying KD is a problem player because he doesn’t defer to Blake Griffin enough.
I wasn't being sarcastic. He fancies himself a stand-up.   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2787684-blake-griffin-knows-what-you-think-of-his-stand-up-he-just-doesnt-care
Yeah I fucking hate Blake Griffin. It’s not even like I love Detroit or anything. Dude is a fucking slime ball and his little smug comments are so annoying. The one last year about how “everyone said I sucked now they’re mad I’m joining the Nets” made my eyes roll to the back of my head
Fuck Blake Griffin fr  Dude fucked over Detroit and then is like member that one time I dunked for y’all a couple times?
Blake Griffin is a sleeper pick for this. His knees may be shot but he still has a ton of upper body strength.
"There was the big almost thrice, each of which I think would have guaranteed a championship.   There were strong rumours of Blake Griffin joining okc, when exactly I'm forgetting.  The rumour that Al Horford would have signed if kd resigned, providing a big upgrade over Steven Adams and a lot more spacing/flexibility.  The biggest, of almost getting Klay Thompson. That trio of russ kd and Klay would have just ended games"
Luka  Jimmy Butler  LeBron  Blake griffin   Embiid
"Pat Bev for intensity, Jimmy Buckets for playfulness, Blake Griffin because he does standup, Robin Lopez because Robin Lopez, Boban because of John Wick 3"
"With respect, I'm not sure I could possibly disagree more.   I'm pretty sure the most basketball action I've ever missed due to injury is in the ballpark of six weeks (hand surgery, broken wrist, moderate to severe ankle sprains). After a month and a half off, I basically feel like I have to re-learn how the game works. And no matter how much running and strength training I try to build during rehabilitation, nothing quite matches up with getting back into live runs.   The good news: I'm a nothing basketball player mixing back in with nothing fellow basketball players.   But then I try to imagine being on the wrong side of 30 and undergoing two knee operations in the same year, rehabbing, returning, failing, re-injuring, a second operation, rehabbing, etc. And after 350 days away from basketball, I try to imagine returning to the NBA where I'm expected to still be the 1A or 1B option on a team that's been hollowed out since I went down.   Frankly, yeah, I wouldn't be too surprised that a dude playing point forward after a year off didn't have the explosion to elude his defender with a live dribble along the perimeter and slither past helpside for dunks for his first few weeks back.   For some reason, I watched those Blake Pistons games last year. And believe it or not, he didn't leave a whole lot of dunk opportunities on the table. Every team would stack the floor when he held the ball on the perimeter and dare him to settle for a J or welcome him to slowly dribble into the teeth of the defense. He wasn't LAC Blake in Detroit; he was seen as some sort of weird Chris Paul/Blake Griffin hybrid, which kind of worked when healthy but dude was toast after that year off."
"Preach.   Frankly, considering the state of our franchise in recent years, I don't think he ever belonged here. Yet, he accepted his fate from the moment he arrived on that [frigid cold tarmac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3T6Dj7Oiwk&amp;ab_channel=NBAGametime). Could have whined, could have refused to report, could have been passive aggressive.  Instead, dude said and did all the right things from the jump and produced one of the greatest individual seasons in recent Pistons history (one would be surprised where his campaign matches up, considering most great Pistons teams didn't rely upon a single star like Griffin).   Then he blew his knee out, played on it for first round Pistons glory, and spent a calendar year undergoing operations and rehabilitating. Then when he *does* come back, his legs still don't work and his team's been hollowed out as a means of going full tank.   I never quite figured out what issue people had with Blake here. If you never liked his personality, fine. Otherwise, it looked like a dude who missed a year of basketball who didn't have his legs trying to mix in with a purposely poor supporting cast in a year where losing was the whole point."
Hardly any players have a no trade clause you have to be a big time star for those. Ever heard of Blake Griffin? They showed him everything as an organization making him think he’d retire there and they traded him to Detroit. Can’t have it both ways bud but you tried.
"I totally understand him not wanting to be in Detroit, especially in 2021. They were literally a team that didn't want to compete. That's a waste of time for a veteran like Blake Griffin. That 2019 season will NEVER be forgotten"
it's either gonna be Blake Griffin after he signed with the Nets or he's gonna be DeAndre Jordan with the Nets. No in between.
"&gt;Bucks shot great in the regular season too  They were never the #1 3pt shooting team in NBA history &amp; you're totally missing the point.  The Nets didnt make the Bucks shoot bad, the Bucks shot bad because they were BAD.   Utah-DAL shot lights out because they're incredible offensive teams, Doncic-Mitchell are elite 3pt shooters, Giannis isn't, even THJ was a better 3pt shooter than Middleton.  Unlike KD Kawhi had a direct involvement in lowering their %s.   &gt;because their defense was another level.  They were doubling a shot Blake Griffin lol, that's POOR defense, terrible coaching.  I know how good dudes like Landry Shamet are I watched him all year in LA, same with how good KD is defensively, he's not that good.  I'm familiar with all these players.    Dallas shoots 50% from 3 with insane defense played on them, Milwaukee shoots 30% with shit perimeter &amp; paint defense.  That means FAR less shots back to Kawhi-LA and FAR more shots for KD-BKN.  Offense is much more difficult trying to combat a team hitting 50% of their 3s, you have to 1up them on every possession.   &gt;a better defense (and team   There's nothing to suggest that.  How are the 1st seed Jazz worse than the 3rd seed Bucks?  Even the 1st seed 76ers were headed by Doc, the biggest choking head coach in history.  The writing is on the wall my guy, it's very easy to see."
"&gt; Blake Griffin forcing a sign and trade with a year and a half left through his.  Blake didn't really force much. He was playing hard for us (not dunking but he went to the ground for every loose ball) and we actively chose to bench him to give more time/touches to the young guys. Also we didn't trade him, after 10 DNP-CDs we bought out his remaining money and he actually gave a decent chunk back to facilitate the matter.  I think Blake is a better example of a team doing the player wrong (even if it was the right decision for the franchise) than the other way around."
"The Mavs were a potent offensive team, they turned any miss into a bucket.    Milwaukee was so bad they could hardly run their offense or make 3s, that's the reason for the series being close in the first place, it's what opened up so many scoring opportunities for KD.  Blake Griffin and Tucker were on KD not Giannis, Giannis had to carry the offense.  The Mavs played out of their MINDS so was Utah, the Clippers just took it to another level.    The Bucks did no such thing they played down, WAY down to their comp.   Utah swept Memphis, they cruised to an easy W dont know what your point is there.  Again this is the East where WB-Beal &amp; Randle-Rose managed to clinch the 4th &amp; 8th seed.  It takes PG-Kawhi and Lebron-AD to do that out West.  You can't tell the difference?"
"Harden was still demanding attention, even Blake Griffin rofl, the Bucks were BAD, very poorly coached team.   KD was slowed down significantly by Tucker, who else did the Bucks have?  And he clearly should've fouled out of several games I didn't forget about that, that was blatant by the NBA.    The Mavs and Jazz are just better, there were TONS of scoring opportunities for KD because the Bucks couldn't run a basic offense.  The Mavs &amp; Jazz punished you when they made shots, you can clearly see the fluidity of their offense compared to the Bucks."
"not sure that's really unique to small markets.  Philly isn't really considered a small market.    we've basically got Kevin Love riding a stationery bike through his contract, Blake Griffin forcing a sign and trade with a year and a half left through his.  at some point the NBA just has to draw a line in the sand and hold players accountable.  maybe that means some concession to the player as well - if they're traded the last year of their deal automatically becomes a player option or something."
Chris Paul. Blake Griffin and the Clippers had to call the cops on him
"Buy outs only benefit the team, they don't do anything for the player.  But harsh reality, Blake Griffin might the only decent buy out player in decades. I never get the fuss with this one, they're usually bottom of the barrel players, if they're not only getting bought out but are signing for the vet min too they're not good.  If the buyout players had worth, they'd be getting traded."
"Blake Griffin has a better career than Vince Carter. Who many think is a lock. So yes, easily."
Shaq and Blake Griffin are my two favorite players. I think just watching someone posterize somebody is the best thing about the NBA.
"Agreed. Even in my theoretical, utopian HOF, he makes it. I just wish the bar was closer to Paul Pierce than it is to Lamarcus Aldridge or Blake Griffin lol"
"I would say no, just because injuries robbed his chance to accumulate the stats that would make his case a lock.  Blake Griffin is currently #175 all-time in scoring, currently behind David West, Jason Richardson, Rashard Lewis and plenty of others.  He's also 200th all time in total rebounds, almost 1,000 boards behind Vince Carter.  Despite having a very high peak, he probably doesn't have the total resume needed unless he plays for another 5 seasons as a valuable role player and wins a chip (or 2)."
"Well just agree to disagree ig. We’ll see how he looks defensively in Brooklyn.  What? There was a literal log Jam between he AG and Jamychal green, all players that aren’t very effective at any position but the 4. The fact that he played less against the suns just proves my point that Jamychal green was given priority due to his shooting and their need for offence, since Portland was a much worse defensive team than Phoenix was and they didn’t need to squeeze every bit of offence they needed to out of the team.   There were 4-5 teams that gave millsap interest in FA based upon reports. It’s possibly they all offered the minimum, since A- he’s old and B-  few teams had cap left, but it would also make sense for millsap at his age to settle for a minimum to compete for a chip. Guys like Blake griffin and Malik monk took pay cuts to ring chase."
It honestly reminds me of when the Pistons traded for Blake Griffin but on steroids  All of this likely won’t lead to a championship and will set you back years when it’s over so what the hell is the point
"Yup, 2 top 10 players, then you add a recent mvp who just average another triple-double over the season, and now the way they've added to their bench, the way I heard so many people just a few months ago whining and bitching about the Nets adding LaMarcus Aldridge and Blake Griffin, yeah this is definitely a super team for sure"
"&gt;With less than six minutes left in the NBA All-Star Game Sunday night, Kobe Bryant told West coach Gregg Popovich that he wanted to guard the East’s LeBron James, the consensus best player on the planet, a title Bryant, now 32, once held.The showcase of uncontested dunks and behind-the-back passes that wowed the Houston crowd was over. It was time to win the game, the time that Bryant loves the most.And so he defended James as if it were the NBA Finals, bumping and shoving, harassing the Miami Heat’s superstar at every turn. Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers held James to just one point in those closing, decisive moments. James had a turnover and two of his shots blocked by Bryant, who had no problem letting the game’s best player know it.“Just taking the challenge and settling in a little bit when the game gets close,” Bryant said. “It’s fun. I enjoy it.”   &gt;   &gt;Bryant’s West squad won, 143-138. Los Angeles Clippers point guard Chris Paul earned the MVP with 20 points and 15 assists, while Oklahoma City’s Kevin Durant had a game-high 30 points. But Bryant’s stellar defense on the player who took over from him as the top player in the world was the topic of much discussion.Bryant blocked a James top-of-the-key jump shot with 2:39 left that led to a Durant open-court dunk and a 136-126 West advantage. The West appeared to have victory in hand, but Bryant would not let up on James, who lost the ball with 53.9 seconds left, leading to a Blake Griffin dunk that pushed the West ahead further, 142-134. And for his final impressive measure, Bryant blocked another James shot out of bounds on the baseline with 40.9 seconds left.“I didn’t want him to score on me, dammit,” Bryant said.Said James of Bryant’s defense: “I’m absolutely not surprised. … It’s all in good spirit. Two guys that love to compete, love to go at it. I had a lot of fun.”Added Bryant: “The last eight minutes are usually more intense,” Bryant said. “The last eight minutes of the game are what fans really want to see. They want to see that competitive spirit. All in all, I think we gave them a pretty good show.”  [https://atlantablackstar.com/2013/02/18/kobe-bryant-shuts-down-lebron-james-in-all-star-duel/](https://atlantablackstar.com/2013/02/18/kobe-bryant-shuts-down-lebron-james-in-all-star-duel/)"
I usually just see Blake or Griffin or Blake Griffin
[Blake Griffin dunk post on Pau](https://youtu.be/Sh2ZT1aPBoE) was an offensive foul and it’s disgusting is even a highlight.
I'm not a pistons fan. I'm not super familiar with the rosters. I'm not sure if I read BG for Blake Griffin before. My first thought was Ben Gordon but the years weren't right.  Sorry it didn't come to me right away.
That was actually who I went to first for BG but then thought the years were off.  I'm not a pistons fan. I'm not super familiar with the rosters. I'm not sure if I read BG for Blake Griffin before.  Sorry it didn't come to me right away.
"Charles Barkley would easily be considered as being better than Malone, if he'd shot 35% on the obscene amount of 3's he attempted  Ben Simmons - Shooting  Trae Young - Defense (Trae's doing well for himself, but the dude would be the frontrunner for both MVP and MIP, if he magically became an average defender)  Young Rondo - Shooting (he'd be seen in the same light as CP3)  Roy Hibbert - Shooting  Carmelo Anthony - Defense  Jordan Clarkson, Lou Williams and all the other microwave guards throughout NBA history - Defense  Blake Griffin, Amar'e and all the other athletic forwards that never became true superstars - Defense and/or Shooting"
BG = Blake Griffin  Took me a little bit to get my timelines right
"While I absolutely hate Rich Paul for how he treats his less tier clients primarily Nerlens Noel.   I honestly don't have any issues with players trying to force trades to the teams they want to go to.   Like Sports teams don't have any sense of loyalty. It's hey what can you do for me now if you can't do anything for me the good bye.   While Charles Barkley complains about Ben Simmons and Anthony Davis, look at what the Kings did with DeMarcus Cousins. Look at what Clippers did Blake Griffin. Look at Boston did with Isaiah Thomas.   Isaiah Thomas was headed towards getting at least $15-25 mil per contract with how well he was doing in Boston. And his teammates liked him too. Then Danny Ainge cold heartedly shipped him off to Cleveland and dude didn't help with Cleveland and lost out on a big extension.   So yeah I don't really mind players forcing their way to their chosen team if they have the ability too."
"You play like Blake Griffin, foul the shit out of him, and hope the refs don't call it due to fatigue. Almost worked too"
"He's not getting paid by the Lakers anymore, he just has dead money on their cap sheet because they bought him out and stretched the cap hit. He got his payout a couple years ago. Stretching a buyout doesn't slow down the payments to the player, it just stretches the cap hit over a couple years. This would be like saying Blake Griffin is the highest paid player on the Pistons this year."
Zach Randolph cause he was always tryin to start shit with my ex-lord and saviour Blake Griffin
Honestly just love the idea of prime Blake Griffin and Luka.
"Ben should look at Blake Griffin as an example. When he debut he couldn’t shoot for crap! Just dunk and layup but as his career progress and sadly did the injuries, he changed his game. Now you see him shooting respectable mid rangers and 3s! Ben needs to learn to change his game!"
"Cause he’s not. He’s in a starting lineup with 2 shooting specialists, one of the better shooting combo forwards in the league and Embiid, one of the best shooting bigs in the league that takes like 8 jumpers per game. There’s maybe 3 or 4 teams in the league that would be a better fit.  Also ben has had oppurtunities without Embiid and he’s not that good. In fact his stats in the 12-15 game stretch where Embiid got injured were much worse across the board.  He also can’t really be a franchise ste cause he’s not a good scorer. He’s bad at every aspect besides finishing directly at the rim, and at the rim he’s league average, while guys like giannis or prime blake griffin were well above average. His lack of being a scoring threat also hurts his playmaking ability since he’s a liability in the half court and teams know he’s never looking to score"
Clippers Blake Griffin
"Donovan Mitchell really grew on me - I couldn’t stand him during the whole rookie of the year debacle and thought it made him look like a massive sook.   I used to think Tim Duncan was the equivalent of watching beige paint dry. Obviously I was very young then and biased because the Spurs were the Lakers’ biggest competition and have grown to appreciate his playing (also he was on a team with Patty Mills who I love).   I used to hate Blake Griffin - thought he was overrated as hell (and he was on the Clippers) and a pretty boy.  Now I’m just kind of indifferent towards him.   Who knows … maybe in 10 years I’ll come to appreciate Luka (who right now I think of as the whingy obstacle to my country’s first medal, the soft and shiny individualistic “Wonderboy” contrasting the team-focused Aussies)."
"Passing: Jason Williams, Jason Kidd, Nash  Dunks: Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, Shawn Kemp  Finishing: MJ, Kyrie  Shooting: Curry, Dame  Defense: Kawhi"
"Saying Trae was the first to lead in scoring and assists is a lot of cherry-picking and fairly meaningless. Lots of other players were very close to leading in both, or simply did not have the needed play-style or were not on a team that would allow them to do that. By pure volume on counting stats he was excellent. I said his efficiency was not otherworldly but just solid. 36% from 3 and 58 TS% with his turnover rate even on high volume is very solid but not at all eye-popping. And it makes it more concerning how good he will be when he’s so small and lacks athleticism.  And if you want to go by just pure college stats, then his advanced stats in college were again solid but not amazing. A WS/40 of 0.20 is not that great. A PER of 28 is very good but fairly typical of a 5-10 pick or even lower. He wasn’t even top 10 that year in PER.  And again his size and lack of athleticism were huge concerns. He was smaller, shorter and less athletic than all of the guys you just mentioned. Russel is 6’4” and 195lbs with awesome athleticism. How does he compare to Young? Fox is 6’3” with much better athleticism and was also the 5th pick. Oladipo is 6’4”, 215lbs and an amazing athlete. John Wall, Westbrook and Rose are all taller and much heavier than Young and were ultra-explosive freak athletes. I don’t understand any of these comparisons. If Trae had the physique of any of these guys with the stats he put up he would have gone 1 or 2. The problem was that he didn’t have that physique so he fell to 5th, which is still very high.  Steph his freshman year would not have even been a first round pick and maybe not drafted at all. Though his efficiency and advanced states were still generally better than Trae. He wasn’t drafted until 2 years later when he was way better. And again it still took him 5 years on top of that to become an All-Star. Drafting Steph that high was still a small gamble. And it took a long time to actually pay off. Just because it then paid off massively doesn’t mean it wasn’t a small risk. And if he was taken something like #1 over Blake Griffin that would have been a gigantic, insane gamble. He ended up being way better than Griffin but that doesn’t mean it would have been a reasonable pick at the time."
I’m not gonna argue ab Harden cause I agree with 2018 it wasn’t his fault  I do disagree ab KD against the Bucks tho. It was a a amazing carry job but I can’t use KD’s 2 games to override what Steph did all season. Also KD’s help that series was underrated cause Jeff Green and Blake Griffin were really good while Middleton and Jrue were cheeks in games 5 and 7 and almost shot the Bucks out of the game
"[Kyle Kuzma ""seconded"" Donovan Mitchell's tweet of Trae Young for ROTY](https://mobile.twitter.com/kylekuzma/status/1109658261349777408). So unless Rookie of the Year is no longer ""the best rookie for that season"", then that still means that there's at least one rookie better than Luka for Kuzma. lol  I only found that particular tweet because Nurkic's reply was posted on the Mavs sub after Blake Griffin has ""thirded"" the tweet already. LOL"
So Blake Griffin should've had his contract shrunk because the Clippers decided to trade him? Or John Wall? Russell Westbrook? The NBPA will never agree to it nor they should. It gives owners the chance to trade away players who get injured to reduce the wage bill and gives the players nothing. The contracts aren't designed that way right now and the player association would have to agree to make the change. Why would they agree to reduce their own power?
I mean he clearly got him on the arm lol. Blake griffin did a better version of this that was all ball.

Blake Griffin with no regard for Vinnie Del Negros family. Who pushes a head coach to the side like that with so little regard. Enter Doc Rivers.

"it's obviously below LA, but nba players seem to like it. athletes like Scottsdale, weather is ideal for nba players who aren't here in the summer generally. KD had it in his top nba cities and i think blake griffin did too. 11 probably isn't that far off though."
"I assume you’re talking the Raptors and Heat series the Nets at no point successfully walled him off, even in game 2 which was the one shitty game he had.  Are you sure you’ve seen a basketball before? You’re definitely talking about the right sport here? The Brooklyn Nets, with I guess KD, Nicholas Claxton and the corpses of Blake Griffin and LMA, are more suited to defend Giannis than the Phoenix Suns with Deandre Ayton, Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder (who was Giannis’ primary defender on the 2020 Heat, a series you clearly remember well)? This is what I’m talking about, there’s skepticism and there’s delusion."
"Not even that. Let’s look at the next years draft class.  Dwight Howard still around but a bit player.   Next draft. Bogut. retired.   Heck, 2009 6 years AFTER, Blake Griffin and 2010, John Wall, both just bit players now."
"I like Blake Griffin as much as the next guy, but calling him top 2 is a bit of a stretch."

That didn't stop the Clippers from trading Blake Griffin a few months after signing his extension against his will.

Blake griffin??
"I get the 16 &amp; 6 season was his lowest, but the point still holds, Bosh made 5 straight all star games while averaging 18 ppg and 7 rpg including seasons with just 43 and 54 games played. A lot of his stats are inflated by playing on 20-30 win teams in Toronto where he was among the league leaders in USG% a number of seasons. He has one of the largest discrepancies in All Star Games and All NBA teams in league history.   If you look at Bosh's all star years and then compare them to Dirk who averaged 18 &amp; 7 with 37% 3PT shooting a year when Bosh made the ASG averaging 19 &amp; 7 with only 53 games played, Aldridge who averaged 22 &amp; 9 and missed the ASG, Hayward who averaged 20/5/4 for 2 straight seasons and missed both, Pau Gasol averaged 21/10/4, 19/8/3, 17/10/4 and 17/10/3 and missed the ASG each season. Theres a timeline where Pau is drafted by an East team and is an All Star every year from 2002-2016, instead he was stuck int he West and has 6 total all star selections (2 during his only 2 seasons in the East) and 4 All NBA selections.   All of the aforementioned guys and likelyl more, missed the ASG despite putting up stat lines comparable or just outright better than Bosh's.  I'm not saying he is worse than Love or Boozer or West, but even if he's had a better career and peak than those three, it doesn't mean he would've unanimously gotten All Star nods over them. Using Love as an example, he'd be pretty hard pressed to get an All Star selection in 2012 or 2014 over Kevin Love who was incredible those two years. That doesn't mean Love is better than Bosh all together.   Every year from 2005 to 2015 Bosh would be competing for 5 all star forward spots against the likes of Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Stoudemire, Marion, Webber, Brand, Boozer, David West, Mehmet Okur, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Andrei Kirilenko, Kevin Garnett (until 08), Kevin Durant, Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, Zach Randolph, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love, LaMarcus Aldridge, Gordon Hayward, Anthony Davis, Josh Howard, Peja Stojakovic. Granted these guys didn't all or peak during that 10 year span, but at any given point 5+ of these players were in their prime and Bosh would've had to go up against them for one of just 5 all star spots. Unlikely he beats all of them for 10 straight years like he was able to do in the East where there was less competition.   If Bosh plays in the West he probably causes guys like Love or Boozer to miss a game or two, but at the same time, Bosh would miss out on ASG due to the plethora of talented forwards but at the same time."
Trading Blake Griffin months after signing a max extension didn’t set a bad precedent?
Well then we should also punish the Clippers for committing to Blake Griffin and trading him half a season into his extension that made him the “franchise player”. Both sides to everything.
"I always thought Blake hitting that contested 3 as time winding down over the Suns and PJ Tucker was a F U.  I'm uncertain if Tucker was giving Griffin fits all game, but they were definitely arguing back and forth all game.  As the clock was winding down, Blake has the ball, decides to not hand it off to CP3, steps back for a contested 3 with PJ in his face, and nails it.  At this stage of his career, Griffin wasnt even remotely a shooter and had no business taking the 3 (unless you really think Chris was that tightly contested.)  When he nails it, he runs towards PJ's direction but is met with his team.  At the time (and even now) I thought Griffin had even extra to say to PJ, but that was cut short."
"Do my Lob City Clippers count?  Repeated injuries from Chis Paul, Blake Griffin, JJ Redick, etc?    It also doesn't help that I think we weren't mentally prepared as we had a young Blake and a determined Chris (age and maturity differences), but ultimately if it wasn't being injury prone, punching locker room managers, or holding a WWE tournament with Zach Randolph, I always thought we may have had better chance at whatever we were trying to accomplish."
"&gt;You need to work on your reading comprehension. I'm saying the opposite. His value was in that potential, but he hasn't improved so that bubble has popped and teams are reassessing his value.....sixers need to do the same.  Lmao I understood what you said fine, it's just hilarious to me that you seriously think teams won't take a chance on his untapped potential because he hasn't hit a peak only 4 years into the league. His value is still based on his potential no matter how you try and spin it, Simmons just turned 25 and despite him not having a breakout year yet he will always be a 6'10 guard that can play 1-5 in the modern nba. If Simmons even becomes a below average shooter he is infinitely more valuable than Dame or Beal has ever been because as good as they can score their style of play isn't conducive to  winning a chip nor can they even come close to what he does on the other end.   Simmons value is dropping because he is proving to be a mental midget by refusing to even attempt to shoot in live games despite us seeing videos of him working on his shooting form every year in the offseason. Saying he isn't a shooter doesn't justify a lack of effort when I can watch guys like blake griffin and  robin lopez reinvent themselves as shooters way later in their careers."
"Question: to all those who feel this way about Simmons, how did you feel when Blake Griffin got traded to the Pistons one year after signing and being told he’d be the franchise player? To me this is literally just a mirror of that situation but with way more hurt feelings from Simmons"
"He would be a perfect fit on a YMCA or NBA2K roster, but in the league he has the chance to be a Blake griffin level star in a small market with a GM that promises a smaller city early playoff exits.   Or not much different than Philly now. As a sixers fan, I feel this is the curse for the process."
"&gt;After the Blake Griffin trade, I don't care if a guy asks out with 10 years left on his deal. Teams will promise to hang your number in the rafters and then trade you less than a year later, so its only fair for players to ask out when they aren't happy.   Wrong. Being able to trade a player's contract is an intrinsic part of how NBA contracts for, and the possibility of being traded somewhere else during the term is built into player's salary. Furthermore, there is actually something teams and players can arrange to make sure the player doesn't get traded without their consent, and it's called an NTC. Without an NTC, it is literally implied in your contract that a team has the right to trade you.   There is no corresponding right for the player; the guaranteed nature of the contract years means that the player will receive the same salary that they were promised by the original employer regardless if they are as valuable to the new employer or not. The player is paid the agreed sum, although it may be done by another organisation.   The Clippers scenario with Blake is ugly, but it's literally just a bad PR for the Clippers when it comes to free agents. What they did is completely legitimate and allowed, even if they ended up trading him after. So no, this example should have absolutely no bearing on petulant players refusing to honour their contracts when no teams have ever refused to honour their contractual obligations."
"&gt;He signed the 5 year deal, if you don't go to work you don't get paid.  After the Blake Griffin trade, I don't care if a guy asks out with 10 years left on his deal. Teams will promise to hang your number in the rafters and then trade you less than a year later, so its only fair for players to ask out when they aren't happy.   I'm sick of the way the NBA handles player movement. There should be no draft, no trades, and no max contract. It works fine for European soccer leagues."
"Look at Blake griffin. Shaky shooter his whole career, now he's shooting about league average. If you spend time with nba level coaches you can work on your game.  Instead of moping about a trade during the offseason he could have been in the gym working.  Once again I say this. Ben Simmons has zero leverage in the situation. If he wants to go out and prove to nba GMs why they should save him from Philadelphia, by all means. But until then the sixers don't owe him a thing."
Nets are the Big Brain squad. Let’s go ask Blake Griffin about Palestine. Should he will drop some bangers.
"3? Vince Carter, Michael Jordan, Dr. J, Dominique, LeBron, J-Rich, Kemp, Kobe, Blake Griffin. He's above all but two of those?"
liked blake griffin as a pre teen. years of therapy still here
"KD actually did have phoenix in his favorite NBA cities, and blake griffin did as well. and CP3 asked for the trade here. obviously LA, New York, Miami are way ahead of everyone else in terms of destination cities for players, but phoenix is in the next tier and is not close to the same as memphis."
"Maybe I'm just undervaluing him because of the current trade environment surrounding him. Perhaps that's on Morey though and not the rest of the league. I can see that he's an amazing player in the regular season but I've just never seen him play at the same level in the postseason. Admittedly though, you've most likely watched a lot more of those games then I.  As far as Ayton, if I was a Suns fan, I wouldn't be in a rush to max him right away. Yes, they made a finals run but they also ran into injured teams all the way there. I'd rather see them wait until after next season's playoffs, so they can be sure it wasn't a fluke, and handle it in restricted free agency.  That's just me though because I've been in pain, watching bad trades and cap management since 2009. Ben Gordon, Charlie Villanueva, Josh Smith, Blake Griffin, who still counts towards $30 million of our cap this year. I mean, we traded Khris Middleton as filler salary for Brandon Jennings and he was just the 2nd or 3rd best player on the championship team."
Blake Griffin is a minimum player now.
My point is that KD was being guarded one-on-one by PJ Tucker for the vast majority of the series while Giannis got some combination of Blake Griffin and zones. But you’re talking head to head matchups like it matters any more than what KD did against the Celtics vs. what Giannis did vs. the Suns. Why?
"Because sometimes a team will have someone like joel embiid, which would make driving into the lane way more difficult than driving into blake griffin"
Can Wall earn money on a new contract next season even though he would still be getting money under his old contract? I see Blake Griffin signed for the minimum over the summer and assumed that was because he can't make any more money than the Pistons are paying him this year.
&gt; The ringer did a piece on it here. Otto Porter with the 3rd overall pick is about average value. That’s a top 3 pick who at his peak was a good starter but generally a role player. So trading a top 10 pick on average isn’t worth much.  I feel like this doesn't account for power laws and the exponential value of acquiring a GOAT. The value of the picks is in the upside tail that it turns into an all time great on the level of Larry Bird or Kevin Garnett.   A #1 pick might have a ~10% chance to turn into that  A #5 pick might have like like a 5% chance.   A #10 pick might have like a 1% chance.   So a #10 pick still has serious value. I'd say a 1% chance at LeBron is worth more than a 100% chance of a Blake Griffin. So saying a typical #1 pick turns into Blake Griffin or John Wall isn't the right way to distill its value. Really the value of the pick is the small chance it turns into the GOAT.
"Bucks are very bearable. They barely beat the KD/Blake Griffin Nets last year and went to 6 against the Hawks (with Trae injured) and 6 against the Suns. It’s not like they were some unstoppable juggernaut and are always going to be vulnerable to losing to bad free throw shooting.  No one is beating a healthy Nets team, barring a complete Harden collapse, so any discussion of other teams winning comes with the asterisk of the Nets getting hurt or having a mental collapse."
Blake Griffin was top 5 MVP candidate twice and made 6 all NBA teams what are you talking about lol
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
The Blake Griffin experience
Blake Griffin.
"&gt; if Joe Harris doesn't shoot below 30% from 3, they beat the Bucks  Why is it only Joe Harris who gets to have a hypothetical bump? Bucks were the 4th best 3PT shooting team in the regular season, and didn't have a player hit from 3 better than Blake Griffin."
"Paul George likes fishing, Jokic likes horses, Blake Griffin dabbles in stand-up comedy, a bunch of guys are political activists, some other guys are conspiracy nuts"
"Stephen Curry, KD, Westbrook, and Andrew Bynum are all currently 33.  And Blake Griffin is younger than all of them."
"It's so weird having Paul Millsap, Aldridge, and Blake Griffin on the team."
"I like Blake griffin saying “I did my own research, and yeah that’s why I got the vaccine obviously.”"
At least Blake Griffin has the drive to dunk over defenders.   Ben Simmons wouldn’t even put up an open layup in a playoff game.
Athletic freak with none of the toughness as the big time players. Ben Simmons and Blake Griffin have the same mental lapse.
I imagine Blake Griffin is pretty outgoing.
"I mean, yeah pay is all relevant.  In a capped league you can't get a guy who is a solid 3-5th starter on a max deal and expect to be able to compete...   but if you get that guy for a bargain it can be a great piece.   See: Blake griffin."
"I actually predicted that this was the line of questioning you would pursue, so I was already thinking about it for a while. And......I won't be calling them out.   What? but you just said Blake Griffin was suckered! I guess in that situation, the Clippers looked him in the eyes in free agency and sold him on a vision, and just months later traded him. Guess the time frame and time of signing made the difference for me.  And essentially, I view the team I support as more important than any player on it. I supported Lebron when he was on the Cavs, and didn't follow him after he....you know. For players, in exchange for a lot of dough, they take the risk of being sent elsewhere, but for teams, if a star pouts their way out, they're essentially left holding the bag and waiting to hit on the next star on the draft."
"um no, actually I dislike your first paragraph too. If you're referring to the Blake Griffin situation, the front office did him bad.  Yes, I expect both parties in a contract to honor an arrangement. If the player is moved, I'd rather it not happen early into the contract. And Ben Simmons petulantly not showing up for a contract he signed which conditions he well knew is....very immature for me."
"08-12  Lebron, Kobe, Wade were top 3 from 08-10. Next 2 are probably Melo, Dwight, or CP3.  From 11-12 LeBron and KD are top 2. Any combo of Melo, Wade, Kobe, Blake Griffin even. But Mell was solidly around that top 5 player level for like 4 years."
"I agree. I saw him in person from the 4th row in Denver. It was New Years day 2013 and they were playing the Clippers, which was during the whole ""Lob City"" era (Blake Griffin, DJ, and CP3). I fully expected to be wowed the most by Clipper dunks and athleticism, but to my surprise, Javale McGee playing on the other side was the one who really left an impression on me. I couldn't believe -- still can't -- that a man his size not only existed, but was able to FLY. Between his pre-game dunks and his in-game dunks, I swear I left that day thinking I was watching an actual giant playing midgets on a Nerf goal."
"If ""good health"" includes mental health/emotional stability then I agree.  By the way, apart from the obvious, a good health guarantee on Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Paul Millsap would be a big deal."
Gilbert Arenas  And Blake Griffin
"You take the risk of him being a drama queen and not wanting to play on a new team or throwing games and leaving you bag holding a negative value contract.  He isn't the type of influence you want in your locker room.  He has value, but will have to trade at a big discount because of the risk of taking him on and ending uo with an albatross.  It isn't just the injury risk that relegates a promising career to bench warmer status and wreaks your cap like Blake Griffin did to the Pistons, it is now also the risk of being a drama queen and tanking the team and crushing your playoff chances for years, and making you wish you didn't tie up 30 million + in cap for the next few years."
The Blake Griffin special
"In my view they had the best championship teams, not in terms of talent compared to say the Lakers or Boston, but in regards to their teamwork and defense I think they were top tier and for me that's what basketball is all about. Not only that, the underdog and Bad Boy image were things that always appealed to me. And it's rather easy to fall in love with the '04 Pistons, that's how it started for me. Great fan of Sheed and Big Ben together.   Honestly after that, it was eerily natural for me too, even through this cold decade I always ended up watching multiple Detroit games. Never liked the Blake Griffin trade, and I was about to give up watching Pistons ball last year until Weaver made a complete 180 as a GM that I've never seen before, it's like he's playing association mode, so yea I'm hooked again and was too hyped when we got the first pick. Our young players talk about winning and don't neglect the culture they are representing, that's making me even a greater fan. Trying to get my hands on Jerami Grant jersey at the moment."
"If Holiday and Middleton can actually consistently show up on offense, I think they have a better chance than people think. The problem is that they don’t so being able to match the Nets offensive output when all 3 are healthy is very difficult. Also, if they actually called fouls on Blake Griffin like they did against Ayton, Giannis would average 15+ FT’s a game"
Grasping at straws.   Blake Griffin IS vaccinated. People were mad he didn't bash Kyrie. Same people are cool with Luka not bashing people
"I don't know how much more clear I can be. I'm not talking about the reaction Kyrie got, I'm talking about the reaction his teammates like Blake Griffin got for saying ""I got it but it is a personal choice.""   Jfc"
" PLAYER | CAP FIGURE  ---|---|---- Blake Griffin | $29,764,126| DeAndre Jordan | $7,875,533 |  Dewayne Dedmon |$2,866,667|  Cory Joseph | $2,400,000 |  Deividas Sirvydis |$1,517,981 |  Zhaire Smith| $1,068,200 |"
"According to bballrefrence their dead money is at $44.4M. Is there someone missing?   Blake Griffin - $29,784,216  DeAndre Jordan - $7,875,533  Dewayne Dedmon - $2,866,667  Cory Joseph - $2,400,000 (from his prior contract)   Deividas Sirvydis - $1,517,981  This totals $44,424,397 in dead money for Detroit, which is higher than the Thunders payroll as of right now. As OKC guarantees contracts, it's likely to bring their payroll above this though.  Side note: OKC is still paying Kyle Singler 1M/year this season and next."
When Blake Griffin dunked over the car. First time i cared about basketball
Which version of Blake Griffin are we using here? You specified that we are using the peak version of Dwight Howard for this but didn’t specify with Blake.
The Blake Griffin ™️
"A lot I’d do to Sterling. We were widely considered  the worst franchise in all of sports when we drafted Blake griffin if that tells you anything. And largely due to Sterling.    Sterling was Kinda the polar opposite to what Jerry buss was to the lakers. So instead of a historic re-defining of what basketball could be, we had a guy who re-used bandages.   But I do love my team, and I think we have one of the best comeback stories in all of sports. The history of the LA Clippers can be defined as this:   we had bill Walton, but because of his injuries, we fell hard out the gate, and then because the team was sold to Sterling, who is a historic level slumlord, we didn’t get better. Sterling just fucked the horse for about 30 years. But now we are on the up and up, and we are taking this fucked horse as far as it will take us!"
marcus smart  blake griffin  norman powell  mikal bridges  and lastly  #i want Iguodala
Blake Griffin missed his whole rookie year due to injury in the last preseason game.
"Elton Brand, Sam Cassell, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Paul George have all stood top 10 in MVP voting. And this isn't counting the San Diego years. Three 6MOTYs in Lamar Odom, Jamal Crawford, Lou Will. DPOY candidate in DeAndre Jordan.  You might want to revisit your narrative."
"I mean, he kind of already is? The next best player is probably Chris Paul or Blake Griffin, so the bar isn’t really that high. You could even argue he became the greatest player in Clippers history the moment he signed there."
Norm asked Blake Griffin the best question https://youtu.be/rhf7kO0V6aQ
Just simply watching him in warmups at the Black and Gold game before his back got really bad before the Iowa State game had me insanely hyped. Never seen a guy look like that before in college with that kind of freakish athleticism at that size. Probably Blake Griffin when OU visited but that’s it. That Mizzou team did well but I think it was probably Final Four bound with a healthy MPJ.
Reminds me of [Norm MacDonald’s question for Blake Griffin](https://youtu.be/rhf7kO0V6aQ)
i feel like this is an homage to norm asking blake griffin if he will break the rookie of the year curse and get it more than once
They’re gonna Blake Griffin him.
Blake Griffin as well.
"&gt; I doubt 95% of the population, let alone Blake Griffin, can fully understand and comprehend an actual study to know whether it is good or bad.  Eh, studies of effectiveness and safety are not that hard to understand.  We gave X people the vaccine, and it was Y effective verses the control group. We did A to monitor for side effects which were B.  Understanding the molecular chemistry of *how* vaccines work is a whole different thing."
"I wondered if Letterman almost did a ""Norm"" because of that exactly. Another user made a great point that Norm interviewed Blake Griffin previously and kinda did a very similar bit, asking a ridiculous question in a serious manner."
"Norm's press conference questions to Blake Griffin were pretty damn funny.       ""I was wondering, there's kind of a curse with Rookie of the Year, nobody's ever repeated it..."""
"Lol who the hell reads peer reviewed studies before getting vaccinated. I doubt 95% of the population, let alone Blake Griffin, can fully understand and comprehend an actual study to know whether it is good or bad.   Vaccine opinions all boil down to how much trust we place on these institutions. I got vaccinated because I have a feeling pharmaceutical companies have a huge financial incentive to deliver a safe product. I really don’t think they are driven so much by profits that they would risk the subsequent damage to their reputation if they put out a poisonous product. It’s not because I read research papers. Lol who the hell has time for that."
"Very happy to see Blake Griffin use that term. I educated myself before getting the vaccine as well, that's how I knew I should cancel my plans before the second dose and to not show up to CVS again two days after the first"
I really don’t understand what this research is that people are doing. Like Blake Griffin or any of these guys is sitting their paging through the latest medical journals and using that to inform their decision. Its a ridiculous way to frame the issue.
im not taking about those people but guessing what Blake Griffin means by doing his own research and how this time it lead to him being yup vaccines are good versus what all the other crazies are doing that leads to them saying no vaccines are bad.   What 'good' research actually is versus the fake propaganda shit the anti-vaxxers are doing which we are all familiar with at this point.
I think you can look at Blake Griffin as a best case scenario
Blake Griffin is the only one true to his name...  A sexy mythical winged beast.
This is poking fun at his teammate Blake Griffin
"&gt; An NBA where you cant act like a bitch to get out of a contract that you willingly signed because you just don't wanna be there anymore will never work.  I think it's working right now.  &gt; These are NBA players with teams investing a large amount of money in their contracts, trainers to develop their skills, medical teams to keep them fit and healthy, sports psychologists to help them with mental health issues, weight rooms and private training staff and facilities, etc. With that comes a requirement of commitment while you remain under contract, a contract that you reviewed and loved enough to sign.  This is ignoring the fact that if the team isn't happy with you they can move you whenever they see fit. Look at what happened with Blake Griffin in LA. He made the commitment just to be immediately shipped out to Detroit. The teams are the only ones who have a ""clean"" way out of a deal they don't like.  &gt; These aren't $10/hr workers looking for their next shitty $10/hr job on Indeed. Its not the same and I shouldn't have to spell that out for you.  Saying this makes you look like an elitist jerk. Just saying man.   &gt; This new meta of stars being able to re-neg on their contracts whenever they want needs to be nipped in the bud now with an example being made of Ben - an example that should have been made of Harden - an example that will discourage stars from ever going down this route in the future.  It's not going anywhere. Until the NBA drops its anti competitive stuff that favors a player staying in their current situation to maximize their earnings this is going to continue. These guys have like 15 years if they are great to try and setup as many generations of their families with great lives as possible. They are going to go for the money 9/10 times and then handle whatever else after."
"There are TONS of pros that lack work ethic. I understand your argument but if you'd like me to rattle off athletes in multiple sports that made it to pro level but had shit work ethic it would be easy.  UFC in particular has tons of examples. Sometimes people have a hobby that they are just naturally extremely talented at... And they put in time to get good at it... But they don't have the kobe or MJ mindset or ambition.  Ben is a pretty solid example from what I've seen. He makes no effort to expand his game. In his eyes, he has made it and locked up a max contract and is set for life. He is content in being a one dimensional offensive player and he can operate at a high level, but he'll always be exploitable playoff time until he tries to develop.  Ben Simmons could easily be a Blake Griffin archetype if he just tried harder.  FWIW I don't blame the guy for having a bad work ethic, if he's content with his achievements and lifestyle that's fine, but when he causes this sort of drama and acts as immature as he has, it's a huge fuck you to the fan base that has adamently stood by him for years when he got clowned by people. Turns out he was the clown."
"The non blue blood recent number 1 picks are Cunningham from OSU, Edwards from Georgia, Ayton from Arizona, Fultz from Washington, Simmons from LSU, Bennett from UNLV, Blake Griffin from Oklahoma, Rose from Memphis, and Oden from tOSU.  Zion and Kyrie are from Duke; KAT, AD, and Wall are from Kentucky; and Wiggins is from Kansas.  Seems like the former group is much more of a crap shoot"
"The last twenty (before Cade):  Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, DeAndre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Ben Simmons, Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, LeBron James, Yao Ming, Kwame Brown.   **HOF:** Yao, LeBron, Dwight, Rose are all sure things. I fully expect AD, Kyrie and Zion to get there.   **Franchise Star:** Griffin, Wall, KAT, Simmons, Ant.   **Really Good:** Bogut, Ayton.   **Meh to Complete Bust:** Brown, Bargnani, Oden, Bennett, Fultz.   Looking at it like that you're spot on - someone in that franchise star level is around the median (as opposed to mean)."
+1  He was built like a greek god and had all the tools in college except shooting form. I thought his 3 would eventually come around. I didnt think he was so stuck to the ground tho. He had his moments in detroit. I thought a fast paced offense with blake griffin as point forward and him also as kind of a ball handling wing had potential with drummond and reggie as a floor spacer.    I just watched moneyball and hes the prime example of “eye candy” prospect
"Brandon Roy, Jamal Crawford (???) Who was Barton compared to idk, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, Marc Gasol"
So the clippers would of been stuck with Blake Griffin with this rule?
I'm surprised Blake Griffin only has 4
Blake Griffin
I remember that year every sports center top ten was riddled with Blake griffin dunks
"Dude openly admitted that his legs felt good heading into training camp but they were dead by the end, which is entirely consistent with what his game looked like out there. He wasn't casually passing up looks for funsies or looking disinterested.   Instead, it looked like he was trying but just kind of sucked. He was still being used as a 1A option but he was too slow to move past anyone on the perimeter, his shot had no lift (consistent with dead legs), and he appeared gassed by the end of the first quarter.   A lot of folks seem to overlook the fact that Griffin got six weeks off in the middle of the season to continue his rehab and work himself back into proper basketball shape (this was between the end of his Pistons run and the start of his Brooklyn career). I imagine it's tough to overstate how crucial getting a month and a half off in the middle of the season probably would be for a guy still trying to complete his rehabilitation from multiple surgeries.   To top it all off, he went from playing 30+ minutes a night in Detroit on dead legs as a No. 1 option to playing 20 minutes a night in a very narrow role (i.e. fill lanes, convert wide open looks) upon his arrival with the Nets.   I get the conspiracies folks have to a degree because the Pistons are irrelevant and no one cared to watch them. But as someone we *does* monitor the Pistons very closely, it was pretty doggone clear what was going on with Blake and why things shook out the way they did."
Blake Griffin in Detroit
"&gt; There’s also a big difference between formally requesting a trade, and refusing to play or contact the team outright.  Yeah the difference is the PG trade went down almost as soon as it was requested. Morey has dragged this out the entire offseason because he cares about getting the biggest haul not trying to build a contender.     &gt;Durant left the thunder cause the warriors offered him a guaranteed ring.    Yes but if it was under current circumstances he was unlikely to have left huge money on the table to test free agency. At the time, the Thunder could off him the exact same max contract as any other team with space. This is why the supermax is good.   In terms of Simmons, this is run of the mill. John Wall wanted to stay in Washington and what happened? Blake Griffin was ready to retire a clipper and what happened? For every Simmons there's another case of teams cutting guys loose who they promised the world too.   This situation and ADs are both on the GMs. If the guy is serious about the trade request in private don't play with your food and make a move. Many teams have handled such situations without fuss."
"It's crazy that noone has come close to LeBron's hype, even if you put Zion and Blake Griffin hype together, maybe half of LeBron's hype."
"idk for sure, but i think it’s saying that there will be a player who isn’t just faking being washed. like blake griffin looked finished but he played pretty good for the nets. i think they’re saying that some players aren’t just faking"
"I think Blake Griffin is a decent Giannis defender, but he's terrible at it compared to Bam. Also, speaks to Giannis's dominance ofc."
Blake griffin and Kevin love shoulda made it but injuries spoilt them smh
"Blake Griffin to Detroit was probably the biggest one since he had at least 4 years left on his. Demar Derozan wasn’t pissed about San Antonio, but he was openly upset about being traded from the Raptors"
"This, though I'd like to also remind you (and moreso anyone else reading this deep who maybe isn't a Pistons fan) of the OT thriller where Embiid [absolutely was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au31q7KXBrk&amp;ab_channel=ESPN) getting something out of this rivalry, just taunting on Drummond and laughing at him as he got ejected. Then, against all odds, Zaza Pachulia of all people somehow played [lock down defense](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9qvgzx/zaza_with_the_clutch_d_on_embiid/) on Embiid and completely shut him down in OT, allowing Blake Griffin to win the game on a [miraculous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQCfHBERMYs&amp;ab_channel=HouseofHighlights) drive capping off a 50 point performance.  My game of the year 2019, an amazing back and forth that that rivalry definitely was present for"
The Blake Griffin cure.... it's proven
Is that the game Blake griffin broke his knee cap?
"I believe the final 25 will be:      11 Locks: Elgin Baylor, Kobe Bryant, Steph Curry, LeBron James, Jason Kidd, Kawhi Leonard, Shaquille O'Neal, Gary Payton, Dolph Schayes, Dwyane Wade, Dominique Wilkins  6 Probables: Carmelo Anthony, Billy Cunningham, Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Robert Parish, Russell Westbrook  2 Likely but on the bubble: Paul Pierce, Dennis Rodman  5 Squeaking in: Ray Allen, Dave Debusschere, Grant Hill, Bob McAdoo, Tracy McGrady  10 Biggest new omissions: Chris Bosh, Pau Gasol, Paul George, Draymond Green, Blake Griffin, Rudy Gobert, Damian Lillard, Dikembe Mutombo, Tony Parker, Ben Wallace   4 Omissions from top 50: Dave Bing, Pete Maravich, Earl Monroe, Lenny Wilkens"
"If you believe that KD is only marginally better in offense than Giannis. Imagine this, put them both in a team with no scorer, which one would shine more? KD is offense. Full stop. Giannis is stoppable. You’re taking away how the Bucks is enabling Giannis to be better, you’re going to pull out statistics of Jrue and Khris Middleton and how they have lower TS and not contributing to the offense, it’s simply because of those 2 that can generate their offense enables Giannis to be who he is. You can double or triple team KD, he will still get his because he’s that efficient in offense. Defense wise, it is also how bucks enables Giannis to be great defensively, DPOY level. KD has proved to be above average or excellent help defender in that Warriors team, who does he have in Nets to enable him to do that? Blake Griffin? You’re taking away way too much from KD to just point out KD is only “marginally” better, when it is quite significant that KD is better. KD did play more, and I believe Giannis is not at his peak yet, but as of now, yes KD is better. In 2 years? I’ll have my money on Giannis. Even if you say KD has Harden, he has a corpse of Harden in the playoff against Bucks."
"Playing with CP3 certainly helps his efficiency.  I was talking about his usage.  He went from 14.9 FGA per game in 2019-20 to 10.0 in 2020-21, and his USG% dropped from 23.7 down to 18.2.  Cody Zeller had a higher usage rate last year.  Obviously it's better for the team, but it's also pretty shocking for a #1 pick who's generally looked pretty solid.  For the sake of comparison, that's a lower USG than Blake Griffin on the Nets last year.  It's the 3rd lowest USG season by any player picked #1 in the last 15 years (ahead of Oden's stint in Miami &amp; one of Anthony Bennet's 4 seasons)."
Blake griffin is up there
"Bro I just watched the play again and kd isn’t even close to Giannis  The guy guarding him is Blake griffin 😂  Plus Gianni’s doesn’t even react and their is clearly not even a foul. How homer are you that you make shit up out of thin air   He just bricked the shot, he’s done it before and he’ll do it again that’s what makes him great. Stop getting butthurt over everything 😂"
"&gt;His fingers touched rim  Honestly, that is usually my definition too (Blake Griffin) but this one seems like it should be an addendum to that rule haha.  Anyways, fucking love to see this! Canada and Denver need this man back!"
"This isn’t peak Blake griffin tho, he doesn’t have it like he used to. He’s become a really good shooter passer and defender though. He’s made the best pivot from star to role player I’ve seen. Led the league in charges taken last season."
"I mean, I get what you’re saying but this was Blake fucking griffin. If he can’t dunk what can he do?"
"Harden is a good one. That’s the main knock on him too though. And hey, if you wanna pick Blake Griffin, Devin Booker, Jamal Murray and whoever else over KD, Harden, Beal, PG13, Ibaka, Oladipo, Adams, Melo, and potentially LeBron and AD this year be my guest. I would take the second group personally."
"CP3 played with Harden, Booker, and Blake Griffin  Harden played with KD, Russ, Kyrie, CP3, and a fuckload of quality roleplayers   Jokic has one of the best offensive rosters in the league and Jamal Murray was their best player in the 2020 postseason"
Blake Griffin not even worth league minimum.

"Yeah, that's Blake making a business decision. He's not the 23-year old ""dunk it from 8 feet out"" Blake Griffin I grew up with. Not gonna question his motive with arguably the most athletic dude in the game right behind him."
"To be fair, Blake Griffin is old and was probably tired"
"Sad- how far the mighty has fallen. Prime Griffin would try to annihilate that rim (and most likely succeed) no matter who was there- but now this. There are players who you wonder about once they pass their athletic prime. Blake is an example. Other players in this category- Zion, Westbrook, and perhaps even Giannis."
Blake Griffin
Feeling really horrible for Blake Griffin right about now
Oh yea he was apart of that Blake griffin trade. Yea he was Ass for y’all
"I feel like Nets have to make a move for a rim protector, that front court is ancient besides Claxton. 36yo Aldridge, 36yo Millsap, 34yo James Johnson, and 33yo Blake Griffin isn't going to cut it."
They aren’t upvoting Blake Griffin passing up a dunk. They are upvoting the Ben Simmons aspect of it. It’s just…dumb. Blake had Giannis at his shoulder and wasn’t prepared for him to just back down (as I’m sure most people weren’t).
"Nah, there's vastly more highlights than ever.  This sub is just not a highlight place. It has some highlights, but people largely only post and upvote the spectacular ones.  Like Blake Griffin passing up a dunk or Giannis block."
Deandre boutta be the Lakers Blake Griffin where everyone starts saying “wtf he didn’t do this when he was on the Nets”
Before 2021 no one had any respect for kris Middleton or jrue holiday. Kd has the leading 3pt percentage shooter in joe and a fantastic blake griffin and a still great assist and floor general james harden. You can say anything you want but KD wasn't good enough
"Lmao this take is so wild. You’re really just trying to use the Lakers to bring down the Clippers when your franchise (actually city) is the real poverty.   Only time your teams get big names are after they wash up in LA. Blake Griffin, Goff with his small ass hands..  There’s a reason your username is Detroit Sports Kill Me. Let’s hope that’s sooner than later."
"Joe Harris and Blake Griffin are starters. So unless Nash plans on playing only 6 guys every game, then he’s gonna have a problem (when Durant and/or Harden are not playing well)."
"Patty Mills, Blake Griffin, and Joe Harris are great role players."
Blake Griffin is not good. Change my mind.
Maybe Blake Griffin is washed 😟
"Blake ""Ben Simmons"" Griffin lmaooo"
Blake “Ben Simmons” Griffin
Blake Griffin was so scared of Giannis he passed up on a layup.
Blake “Ben Simmons” Griffin
Blake “Simmons” Griffin out there passing up an open dunk lol
Blake Griffin just pulled a Ben Simmons
Blake griffin doing a Ben Simmons I see
Blake griffin looked like Simmons there

"I swear the Blake Griffin dunking narrative is one of the most misunderstood basketball concepts I've seen in recent history. At times it feels as though there's people who honestly feel as though Blake Griffin played two full &amp; healthy seasons in Detroit and didn't dunk one time in that span.  Blake Griffin was a ball dominant point forward in Detroit. Opposing teams geared toward preventing him from getting to the rack on the dribble. He had one of the best individual seasons in franchise history (All-NBA Third Team) but due to his role, he still *only* had 37 dunks.   That was the last time he was healthy in Detroit.   He injured his knee at the end of that season, underwent an operation, came back prematurely in 2019-20 (he dunked a couple times on that bum knee during that stretch), shut it all down again, underwent a *second* operation, and ended up missing 360 consecutive days of basketball.   Then he came back as the teams' point forward again, except all of his help had been given away on account of tanking (Drummond, Jackson, Morris, etc). His body wasn't ready for that workload and he surely wasn't beating anyone off the dribble, so he ended up looking like a 32-year-old who hadn't played in a calendar year.   Finally, the Pistons cut him loose and he got six weeks off in the middle of the season to rest and finish up rehabilitation. When he came back, no one wanted him to be Point Blake anymore. They just said he could go ahead and a fraction of the minutes you were playing in Detroit and convert the open looks James, Kevin, Kyrie, and everyone else set up ya.   I just can't figure out why folks are still hung up on this strange concept of an openly tanking team (last year's Pistons) somehow being expected to be super upset with someone who inadvertently aided the tank.  **Edit:** Not directed directly at OP. More for those who've proclaimed to be serious fans and still come away thinking Griffin was a villainous mastermind here."
The corpse of Blake Griffin is presently on the floor
Blake Griffin needs to fucking retire before he hurts someone who isn't a washed bum like himself.
"Yep! 2009 class had Curry, Harden, DeRozan, Blake Griffin, etc. Harden’s the only one to pass 20K points thus far, but there’s still 10 or so people active from that class. Plenty of time to catch up"
Imma be honest Blake griffin moves kinda rough now 😬
Lying scum Blake Griffin has one dunk in one game now.  What a piece of trash
I love seeing Blake griffin enjoy basketball and smiling after all the shit he’s had to endure the last few years.
"Blake Griffin would break records that would never be matched again if they kept a power rankings of which player yells ""AND 1!"" after their baskets."
Somehow I completely forgot Blake Griffin existed.
What the hell? Blake Griffin can't dunk...
Blake Griffin is the hardest working player in the NBA
"The Union best step in and kick his ass in line leat he fucks things up by setting a precedent like this.  Next time the players association and owners have a contract, the owners are going to have a lot more power because of this kind example.  People aren't going to remember the Blake Griffin Max and trade but this isn't leaving the public consciousness or the leagues memory.  It's going to be a major bullet used by owners which hurts player power in the long run."
Oh look there’s the fraud and liar Blake Griffin
"If Blake Griffin counts as a big, I guess."
i dunno what it is but i fucking hate Blake Griffin
"There is a perfect example of this but in reverse, Blake Griffin signed a max contract with the Clippers, just to be traded to the Pistons mid season.   In terms of this in particular, I think the only one that comes close was Vince Carters exit out of Toronto, but even that was a bit different in that he still played."
Idk where else to say this but Jakob Poetl looks like if Salvador Dali painted Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin looks perfect at Akatsuki ha
Oh I'm not making excuses for him. I'm just saying overall the players will look at things like with Blake Griffin and say why not us asking out when that type of thing happens.
"Yeah, but you kind of cherry-picked a questionable contract that ended up paying off. Hindsight is 20/20. Look at the Clipper’s CP3 contract, the Clipper’s Blake Griffin contract, the John Wall contract, OKC Russ contract, etc.   So many expensive contracts given out for the sake of contention that aren’t rewarded and the teams are punished later when the money makes the player untradeable."
"&gt; They're the 2nd best team in the East but I'd put 2-3 teams in the West above them without Kyrie.  Just out of curiosity, who? Utah and Phoenix I can get behind, but I can't see anybody else.   Also, I think the Nets got better this offseason, they added Mills, Millsap, LMA, and get a full season of Blake Griffin, and a full season of playing time for Luke Walton All-Star role player Bruce Brown.   Plus their defense gets better any time you remove one of the Big 3 from the lineup."
"You can be highly skilled in a system that demands you play a specific role. Blake Griffin was highly-skilled but never got to show off the depths of his skillset because he was playing with CP3, who controls everything."
"Besides, there aren’t any players in the league comparable to prime Blake Griffin"
"&gt; Players are occasionally waived and are good on other teams  Blake Griffin, line one"
"I think right now, it's somewhere behind 2009, but has the chance to pass 09 as the players continue to develop.  Harden, Steph, DeRozan, and Blake Griffin were a really great draft class."
"Blake Griffin makes the all-star team as an injury replacement.  Even he doesn't make the all-star team, I can see him turn back time a little bit this season"
"I would also suggest Kyrie Irving, Westbrook, Miles Bridges, Steve Nash, Jason Kidd, Baron Davis, Pistol Pete Maravich, Reggie Miller in the playoffs were unreal too. Blake Griffin, Shawn Kemp."
what can kevin love do that blake griffin cant
"&gt;nobody knows why for sure  I can answer this one.   When Blake was healthy, during his All-NBA Third Team run in 2019, he had just 37 dunks despite very high usage (by comparison, he topped out at 219 in L.A.). He was very ball dominant (a point forward, essentially, by design) and subsequently, dunk opportunities dwindled.   That was *before* his first knee surgery, which occurred in the 2019 offseason. He returned partway through the 2019-20 season, where it was quickly apparent that his knee wasn't right. He dunked five times during that stretch before having to shut it all down again on Dec. 28, 2019.   He had to undergo a *second* operation at some point thereafter. He wouldn't appear in another NBA game until Dec. 23, 2020, five days shy of a full calendar year since his last NBA game. At nearly 32 years old and following multiple knee operations, Griffin was thrust back into his point-forward role, playing over 30 minutes a night but without most of the help that was there with him in 2019 (Drummond, Jackson, Morris, and more were gone).   Teams mostly just dared him to settle for jumpers knowing he had dead legs and wasn't going to be taking anyone off the dribble. And nobody on that Pistons team was going to be creating at a level that'd set Griffin up off-ball. So for 20 games, yeah, the 32-year-old dude who just took a year off to undergo two operations playing point forward didn't get many dunk opportunities and in the few moments where maybe he could have, he was was in conservation mode and opted for the easier route (layup).   Then he got six weeks off mid-season and when he came back, he was surrounded by superstar play makers who just asked him to play 20 minutes a night, fill gaps, and score a point blank bucket if they set the table for him.  TL;DR: The two years of not dunking was really about 20 games post surgery when his legs were admittedly dead and not fully rehabilitated, before the six week midseason break he got."
Ala Blake griffin
"On one hand, I can't blame you because if I weren't a Pistons fan, I wouldn't have paid attention to anything that has to do with the organization from the past 12 years either.   But on the other hand, that doesn't make anything you said correct.   &gt;Drummond: tries his best  This was actually one of the biggest sticking points of his tenure and why so many folks were ready for him to go by the time it was all said and done. He often played as though he was half asleep, he frequently skimped out on the concept of defensive rotations, and was a big fan of slumping his shoulders and not getting back on D when things didn't go his way.   &gt;statpads to try to make all-star teams  I felt his first all-star selection was pretty natural. That was when he arguably was as close to knowing his role as he ever got. Reggie Jackson was out there setting the table for him and he was poking lobs through the hoop. But the more shine he got, the more he decided he wanted to try to do out there, despite it being well outside his skill set.   &gt;is asked to do way too much on a mediocre-at-best team  The opposite is true. Coaches, particularly Stan Van Gundy, would implore this dude to stop trying to be something he wasn't. He was made to dunk lobs, clear the glass, and be a defensive presence. What they got post-'16 is someone who decided to skip making layups in lieu of spotting for threes and someone who seemingly couldn't go a day without trying to isolate off the dribble so he could get to his 14-foot contested floater spot.   &gt;is blindsided by a trade  Dude was on the trading block for years and knew it. The pattern, for years, generally went like this: Dude played hard for a stretch, then the Pistons had hope that he could be a part of a winner. Then dude would go back to playing outside himself and lumbering about and his trade value would instantly disappear. Eventually, his value dropped permanently and by then it was too late. His swap for table scraps was an inevitability.   &gt;still says good things about Detroit  That's good.   &gt;Blake: hobbles around  For the record, Blake was dealt midway through the first year of a long term contract in Los Angeles and never for a second brought any kind of disruptive attitude to Detroit along the way. Instead, dude buckled up and turned in one of the most impressive individual seasons in team history, yielding a well-deserved All-NBA Third Team honor and playing in the postseason on a knee that'd soon require surgery.   Then, he tried to come back from that injury for the following season but was never fully healthy, requiring another operation that ultimately resulted in 360 days between NBA games. *Then*, he returns and is thrust back into his A1 30+ minutes per game role on dead legs for a team actively trying to tank and, predictably, he played like a guy who hadn't played for a year.   The Pistons and Griffin mutually agreed to a buyout and Blake gets six free weeks midway through the season to continue rehabilitation and conditioning, arriving in Brooklyn with fresh legs and a limited role.   Or... what you said."
"Good luck with that. Love is still playing decently in Cleveland, I think there’s very little doubt that he’d have a Blake Griffin-style revival on a new tram. Cleveland will be able to get something serviceable for Love, not someone who might retire leaving them with nothing."
"I'm talking about Joe Harris, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Blake Griffin. Kd has had the best spacing on any superstar player ever."
"My point of view:  Blake Griffin turned in one of the best individual Pistons seasons in team history, sustained a knee injury, then played on that bad knee during a first round playoff series where the team was already clearly overmatched.   Then he underwent knee surgery and returned pre-maturely the following season, at which point he tried to tough his way through before shutting it all down again, leading to a second surgery.   *Then*, following 360 consecutive days on the injured list (five days shy of a calendar year), Griffin returned to a team that'd been hallowed out with the unspoken-but-fully-understood intent of tanking its way through the shortened 2020-21 campaign. He and Derrick Rose were asked to mentor the young guns, they obliged.   Griffin felt good in training camp, but he professed to his legs dying after said camp. Considering he was nearly 32 years old and coming off of two operations and a year off of basketball, I'm inclined to believe him. As such, he played like a guy who was 32 and coming off of two knee surgeries who hadn't played in a year.   The tanking Pistons team, knowing they were tanking, figured it might be time to do something mutually beneficial. Blake wasn't a part of their future and didn't have much trade value even when he was All-NBA Third Team (injury history, massive salary). A buyout was always going to be the most sensible option for these two, so that's what happened.   Griffin then had a month and a half between his last Pistons game and first Nets game to replenish and re-form. He joined Brooklyn in a role that saw him play a fraction of what he was playing in Detroit while shouldering virtually none of the load. His success made pretty great sense.   I've long had a feeling that the folks most upset about Griffin's departure from Detroit are those who know very little about Griffin's time in Detroit."
He leaned from Blake griffin not trade marking lob city
"His brief stint on the blazers is legendary. Just woke up one day and decided to pump and head fake his way to 50, and the time he trucked tf out of Blake Griffin with a full court head of steam was 10/10."
"I don’t think the Nets will make the finals  Many people use injuries, chemistry, and role players as a reason that teams like the Lakers, Heat, or Bucks won’t make the finals  But these things apply to the Nets, with Kyrie saying he’d retire if he’s traded his value likely isn’t high enough for the Nets to take an offer on him and theirs already some issues between him, the team and organization  Harden was injury prone last season and has underperformed during the playoffs, and I don’t think the Nets role players are as good as people say  Aldridge is old with some health issues, Blake Griffin has been injury prone throughout his career too and the rest of their role players aren’t proven  Basically the concerns that fans have for other teams apply to the Nets too and I don’t think they will make the finals"
"I think only guys that have Lowry on their teams would love him, he’s a bitch to play against   He’s the Blake Griffin of point guards"
Think of Blake Griffin dunking for the Nets but time 50
"&gt; The Athletic’s Jared Weiss on Saturday published a lengthy piece detailing dysfunction inside the Celtics locker room last season. He included multiple nuggets about Walker, including information about his iffy relationship with Brad Stevens.  &gt; And then there’s this excerpt:  &gt; Walker maintained his professionalism throughout the season but his health issues, the team’s poor performance and boos from TD Garden fans — something that particularly “pissed him off,” according to multiple sources — made him sour on his situation in Boston and had spoken privately about being willing to move to a new team. It had become clear he was not going to be in the team’s long-term plans.  &gt; The Celtics' dysfunction reached the point that Blake Griffin asked a friend on the roster if he should sign midseason &amp; was warned to stay away, sources tell @TheAthleticNBA."
Griffin was amazing that first year after getting traded there for sure averaging 25/8/6 or something and was extremely skilled and talented. The last year and a half there though he averaged 15/5/3 and was injured or checked out mentally  Drummond was there for like 8 years averaging like 17ppg and like 15 rebounds. I’m not saying he’s better than Blake but those years before Blake were rough and Andre was thier best player by far  They shouldn’t boo him
"For real. We have:   Kevin Durant, James harden, Blake Griffin, Patty Mills, Lamarcus Aldridge, and Paul Millsap. That’s insane already"
Kevin Love was nowhere near NBA level on the Cavs. Blake Griffin was All NBA not that long ago and he played better for the Nets in the playoffs last year than Kevin Love usually did on the Playoffs.
"Kevin love was all nba and Kyrie was an all star the season before Lebron came back to the cavs. Without Kyrie, Who’s the third best player on the Nets that was all nba/all star? Blake Griffin? Lamarcus Aldridge? Patty mills? Joe Harris? Lol  Duos are not superteams. KD/Harden and good role players is an even playing field with Kawhi/PG or Lebron/AD without Westbrook."
Nah their 3rd best player is like Joe Harris or Blake Griffin  They're as much of a superteam as the 2020 Lakers
The best thing for Detriot basketball was Blake griffin for 2 years. Definitely not that bum
"Not really. Since the lottery, Ewing took the Knicks to multiple conference finals and 2 finals, David Robinson took the Spurs to a conference finals and won 50 games like every year, Shaq took the Magic to the finals, Iverson took the Sixers to the finals, Duncan got the Spurs 5 rings, Lebron took the Cavs to the finals, Dwight took the Magic to the finals, Rose took the Bulls to multiple conference finals. Those are all franchise altering players. Then you’ve also got great players like Derrick Coleman, Larry Johnson, Chris Webber, Glenn Robinson, Elton Brand, Yao Ming, Blake Griffin, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, and KAT.   If you want to be relevant, then getting the number one pick is an easy way to do that. Far easier than trying to develop project players late in the draft like Giannis or getting big time free agents that only 2 franchises can actually get reliably"
"assuming i'm not an idiot and you mean kyle lowry, lowry has literally done nothing for the franchise yet, not sure why he would be on the team  as for ray allen, he was way past his prime and including him would be like adding blake griffin to the all time nets."
"**Some modern ones:**  * Jerry West convincing the Warriors NOT to trade Klay Thompson for Kevin Love.  He really didn't like Love's lack of defense * Hornets letting Kemba walk instead of offering him a max contract, not trading for Westbrook, and drafting Lamelo might prove to be a genius move * The Clippers trading Blake Griffin super early into his contract * Trading the #1 pick and presumptive first overall pick Markelle Fultz for the 3rd pick and Jayson Tatum"
Blake Griffin brought  DJ in
"Their leadership styles also seem different.  For whatever reason I get the sense that Chris Paul rubs other superstar players the wrong way. It's weird that it didn't work out with Blake Griffin or James Harden.   My best guess is that Chris Paul is a Type A control freak — the type of guy that invites people over for a party but then gives each guest specific jobs to do and dishes to bring. Or he's the type of guy that corrects other people compulsively; or is constantly trying to manipulate people into doing things his way, because he genuinely believes it will be good for everybody. That kind of leadership is perfect for a young team that craves mentorship and direction, but would annoy teammates that are more individualistic.  Lowry, con the other hand, is Lowry. Lowry can be a giant asshole; but other players play their asses off for him. He wins people over with his competitiveness and brashness; and generally stays out of other people's business."
Ask yourself this... why did the Clippers lobby Griffin so hard if they knew he would re-sign? I'm sure Griffin's agent had options ready to explore with other teams if Blake ended up wanting to go.
"PG signed a 4 year extension with OKC the year before. He was one year into the deal. One call from Kawhi and he was gone.   Blake Griffin also just signed a new deal and was bumped out the moment he could, Bledsoe signed a 4 year extension with Milwaukee and was moved a year later too. Horford signed with the sixers and they moved him a year later. Contract length hasn't been an issue ever when completing a trade."
"Yeah Blake had some hurt feelings over it, but given his career trajectory, they made the right choice.  In any case, Blake also made the right choice, because he would have made far less money if he had signed with any other team. And he was so bad, he got waived and had the pick of the litter when choosing what contender to join.  Both the Clippers &amp; Griffin are better off he signed the extension. Clippers got trade assets, Griffin got $$$ and his choice of contender to pick to join. Win-win."
"You're missing the point completely. The Clippers knew that Griffin was considering not signing back with them for the five-year deal. It was NOT a given he would re-sign by any stretch.  So the Clippers did everything they could in their pitch to him to convince him to stay. They compared him to Obama, Einstein, Martin Luther King, Michael Jackson and Ghandi, complete with Clipper jerseys made for those figures with his number on them. Employees were all walking around wearing them to impress. They even had a pretend ceremony in Staples center where his jersey was retired and hung up on the rafters.  Six months later, they traded him and five prime years were wasted in Detroit when he CLEARLY would've considered choosing to go somewhere else to compete for a ring. They did this so they could have assets to use that eventually helped them acquire superstars down the line instead of losing Blake for nothing.  Griffin was so disgusted that when Balmer tried to shake Blake's hand before a game a year later, [Blake completely snubbed him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLRMArfgFbs) Some players would always take the money regardless, but not always. You can't automatically assume that for everyone."
"I'm 100% against Simmons' antics so soon after signing a big new contract deal. But to be objective, ownership has abused this on their end as well.   If they make it tougher for a player to ask for a trade soon after they sign up for the max, shouldn't it also be made tougher for a team to trade a player for the max (except in a sign and trade deal)? I mean Blake Griffin was promised the world to convince him to re-sign a max contract with the Clippers, and they shipped him out six months later against his will."
"Blake Griffin was like ""I did my research...and yeah I got the vaccine seems like it's pretty safe"" lmao."
"Offensively Kd was that much better. He dominated in the clutch, and no one was able to guard him. He practically willed his depleted team to a win all by himself. I seriously do not see any argument for Giannis outperforming KD in that series.  If Giannis defended so well in that series, why did Kd go off? It was bc he wasn’t defending KD. So who gives a shit if he’s defending someone like Blake Griffin well, they aren’t relying on Blake’s offence. If he had defended KD and done so very well I’d agree with you, but under their scheme he wasn’t being used that way."
It always sucks when a suspension stops a streak like that.  [Andre Miller had a 632 game streak going](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2010/12/9/1866329/andre-miller-blake-griffin-nba-suspension-blazers) before he got suspended for getting into it with Blake Griffin.
"Karl Malone, Isaiah ""Beef Stew"" Stewart, Aaron Gordon, Corey Maggette or Blake Griffin"
blake griffin is the same kind of athletic freak but never had the BBIQ or injury resistance
JJ Barea. Man pushed Blake Griffin to the floor.

"Lol somehow this reminds me of [Blake Griffin laughing at Thomas Bryant after ""scuffle""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L29svzQGO_8)"
Did Nuggets call the police like Chris Paul and Blake Griffin did a few years ago.
Blake Griffin?
"I don't consider Jokic in the wrong tbh. If he didn't retaliate he would be seen as soft and other players would then take shots at him. He had to retaliate, it's similar to how Blake Griffin was seen early in his career when he didn't give any reaction when hard fouled cause opposing players didn't want to be posterized by him."
"Totally awesome. Was watching Blake griffin yesterday and I had this same feeling, he really rounded out his game and embraced being a team player."
"I think he's even a tier lower than Blake. All we have is claims from James Johnson about his record. Blake actually has quite a few documented instances where he performed standup and has made many comedic videos. Now I wouldn't call Blake Griffin a professional comedian, but I do know that he's done professional comedy work.  I'm fairly certain that James Johnson does train in combat sports, but I have no evidence that he's actually done professional work in the field."
I think about him like I think Blake Griffin and stand up comedy. He’s funnier than all nba players but he’s not that funny in that specific scene yet
"&gt;by his 18th birthday, he secured seven world karate titles, nine national crowns, and compiled a sterling 20-0 record as a kickboxer.   [Source](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/01/20/james-johnson-mma-nba-fights-blake-griffin-arron-afflalo-serge-ibaka-suspension-fine)"
"In the JJ Reddick podcast, Blake Griffin said he’s never seen anyone make so many mid-range jumpers with a hand in his face with such each. That observation was on full display tonight."
Because Harden hasn’t been all-star Harden so far this season.  That’s basically the same as complaining that KD had Blake Griffin and LMA on his team and they’re both all-stars too.
"""Hello police, Chris Paul trying to get in here and kick my ass"" - Blake Griffin"
"Actually, I think some of the marquee players DO need to do this once or twice in their careers. When you’re this talented and unstoppable, inferior skilled players will cheap shot and even try to injure you or take you out of the game.   I think this sets a bar that he ain’t taking that shit.   Example is Blake Griffin is someone who needed to set that bar once or twice in his career, but never did. Led to him getting punked on multiple occasions."
The one thing I'll takeaway from this game is Blake griffin has the flattest arc I've ever seen
Sabonis is a great player but he has that Blake Griffin arm lol.
He passes it to Bruce Brown and Blake Griffin in the clutch  I remember him doing this with Houston in the playoffs as well
[Serious] Is Blake Griffin uncircumcised?
"CP3 is a piece of shit as a player. He's not much better, but he's most of the reason I despised the Clippers. Well, that and Blake Griffin in his whiny Clipper days (I'll never forget the time that Blake hocked a loogie onto the court while staring down a referee, and the ref decided that it was better just to call over someone with a towel than T him up)."
I thoroughly believe that Blake Griffin ruined Jonny's career when Flynn sent for the charge in the national college basketball tournament when Cuse and Oklahoma met up. I think he hurt his hip pretty bad. Flynn was so fun to watch in college. So was Griffin.
And why is BLAKE GRIFFIN one of them?!

"Wtf is that play at 0:19(the three he hit at 106-96)  They could have closed him out but instead they went to cover Blake Griffin in the corner  If he shoots instead of Harden that's a win for you lol, why did they almost make Harden shoot an open 3"
"The Nets big 3: Literally Hitler, the Snek, and Antivax extraordinaire.   I’m a Nets fan btw.  Oh and some people really hate Blake Griffin."
Beef Stew and Blake Griffin
They have James Harden and Kevin Durant. Blake Griffin corner threes were the lesser evil.
"Lol before this game Blake Griffin standing by himself in the corner was MY sleep paralysis demon, he was shooting 18%. But he is around a 40% 3 pt shooter the last few seasons, and man he was incredibly open."
My sleep paralysis demon is Blake Griffin standing by himself in the corner
Is Blake Griffin....a good 3 point shooter?
He was ON FIRE in the fourth. If he can play at this level with KD it's over.  Shout out to Blake Griffin also. His transformation into the glue guy is pretty amazing given what happened in Detroit.
Blake Griffin is the hardest working player in the NBA
"He needs to realize sooner rather than later when his shots aren’t falling and let others do the scoring, like elite 3p shooter, Blake Griffin."
"Look at that Blue collar boy, Blake Griffin! Great hustle!"
blake griffin treats every game like finals game 7
"Precious really got outworked by the ghost of Blake Griffin, interesting."
Ahh Blake griffin the spot up shooter
Isiah Stewart and Blake Griffin
Chris Paul plays like he wants to murder Blake Griffin every time they match up.
"Not gonna lie, Blake Griffin, with his cruisy childhood playing in a gym his friend's dad owned and for his high school team his own dad coached before being the first overall draft pick, thinking he gets to decide on the ""blue collar""... Well, anything, really, but in particular the credentials of an Indigenous man from Canberra whose mother was one of the Stolen Generation and who barely got drafted at all and went on to become an NBA champion (not that you'd know what that's like, Blake), the third Indigenous man to represent Australia in basketball, and one of Australia's first Olympic medalists in basketball...  Fuck you actually, Blake, you soft-as ring-chasing bitch. If you were a tenth as tough as Patty Mills you might have had a prayer of winning a ring without hoping to get carried by better players than you've ever been or ever will be."
"Bruh did you watch the playoffs last year? He was unstoppable but it wasn’t like he was gonna score 60 points a game to carry the nets starting five of Blake Griffin, James Harden, Joe Harris, and Bruce Brown."
Heat announcers are generally unbiased and super professional (unless you're blake griffin)
"Harden &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Westbrook ever since 2015 (except for 2016). Harden has been 2nd in mvp voting ever since; until his last year in Houston. Harden did a better carry job alone than Westbrook ever did in his career.   And Russ was NOT better than cp3 lol stop this. It's very disrespectful to Chris. Same thing for Wade in 2013 (they crazy LeBron year). You're the one mixing up the years.  &gt;Only players without a doubt better each year were Bron and KD  You could argue Duncan and Blake Griffin were still good enough to be considered better than Russ (you could put Carmelo there and it'd be a debate). Russ was not as good as you try to put it. Lots of great players out there.   &gt;Once Steph hit his peak he joined that tier as did Kawhi.  This is not even worth mentionning lol. But Harden SHOULD be in the list. As far as RS+Playoffs success, Harden did better with a worse supporting cast (until 2015) and since 2017, he's been the better player."
Blake Griffin is washed
Nah stewert is good and gunna be better but to compare him with blake griffin is insane
"Man, around [1:14](https://youtu.be/pX4-SUf4SC4?t=74) he jumps to block a LeBron cutting layup, sees Bron dump it off to AD, and turns around mid-air to strip AD's layup attempt with his opposite hand.  Reminds me of a clip here from years ago where Blake Griffin did the same thing, but not sure this play even got half the attention that BG's play did. Draymond is unreal"
"Blake Griffin you are a millionaire, you are not ""blue collar"""
"blake's getting paid nearly $30M by detroit this year, after which they'll be done.  he had two years left and gave back about $13.3M combined, but still kept about $60M.  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/brooklyn-nets/blake-griffin-6501/  maybe you're thinking about LMA or drummond, who were both bought out in their final contract year?"
"No Kyrie, Harden playing like shit on both ends, Joe Harris still in that playoff shooting drought, having to rely on washed Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge to pick up the slack offensively to fill out numbers. Yeah.... KD irritates me but so far it's really hard to argue MVP right now. Especially when all other potential candidates are slacking behind like Luka, Trae, LeBron. Only one close to him is Steph who is playing the best defense of his career early on so far.  Edit: Forgot Jimmy Butler. He's deserving of some consideration."
"He threw because BLAKE GRIFFIN WAS PUTTING A FUCKING ARMBAR ON HIM.  He hit last year AFTER Blake Griffin hit him with two cheap shots, one early and when he did again, Stew retaliate.  Please, never root for Pistons again, this franchise doesnt deserve a shit fan like you"
"""Hello, police, beef stew is trying to beat me up""   ""Hello police, this is Blake griffin, Isaiah Stewart is trying to get in the locker room, get down here, save me"""
that was kinda bs by blake griffin. so dumb
Are we really comparing blake griffin with a no name   Lets be real
I like the tiny little mini-rivalry developing between Blake Griffin and Isaiah Stewart. I enjoyed Blake's time in Detroit and seeing him getting chippy with a former teammate makes his return more fun. The Pistons have a history of things like this ([Mahorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE2e86u3gBQ&amp;t=4s&amp;ab_channel=RyanVanDusen) and [Rodman's](https://youtu.be/6-R9oEcKM-E?t=1) returns) so it's nice to see the next gen take their turn.
Peter Griffin &gt; Blake griffin
Blake griffin deserved that 100% He was acting brand new last year when against the pistons
"To quote a great scholar of our time, "" It don't matter if you win by an inch or a mile. Winning's winning.""  Also, *""Family...""*  And Blake Griffin hits the ground and takes charges so much that I sometimes get bruises just from watching him play; dude is tough as nails.  Also, Kevin Durant is a competent peachbasket player, and I'm not afraid to say it.  *Let's Go Nets!*  **BROOKLYN!!!**"
The Blake Griffin vs Detroit saga is hilarious because it’s so petty and what is either side even mad at but it’s funny every time.
Blake Griffin fueled by pettiness leads his team with a +22 in 27 minutes.  You literally hate to see it.
"It feels like Blake Griffin resents Detroit for some reason when all they did was pay him a huge amount of money to mostly miss the playoffs, and then buy him out so he could play for a contender."

"I don't like the double T much, Blake Griffin was instigating IMO"
Isaiah Stewart just bitched Blake Griffin🤣🤣
"There's a lot of players that don't like the team that they play for.  You think Blake Griffin liked playing for Detroit? Hell no!! but he showed up. He was even selected to be an All-star  To go from sunny LA, a city he love passionately to cold ass Detroit with a garbage squad.  That's life, it's not always going to go your way, but you still have to show up.   Ben could have easily apologized for his performance and put in work at the gym. His problems seemed more mental. He has a garbage jumper and it may not ever improve but there's a lot of players in the league with garbage jumpers."
"Good point there, KD and Harden were both on yhe Thunder in thier one finals appearance and even though theyve left should still be an important part of the fams memories. Also guys who were big names like Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge are draws as well."
Even black stars are targeted by racism. Blake griffin and Chris Paul were shown off like show horses to the racist owners rich friends and he tried to make them go to his private parties and stand around like some sort of attraction for rich old white men to stare at
The players did know he was racist. Blake Griffin talked about being paraded around a party like an object with sterling before.
"Oh so not if Zion was more athletic, your saying if Zion was in better shape. There’s a difference.  And yea, you’re literally describing the psychics I mentioned, more mass with greater acceleration is more force. So a bigger more athletic player is naturally enduring more force on their joints.   And I’m not arguing with assumptions, I’m literally arguing psychics.    Davis actually didn’t say that, your reading an opinion piece. Davis said he just prefers to play the 4, and will play the 5 when it makes sense.    And how isn’t it related to his size? The reason his athleticism wore him down is because he was so big with his athleticism. Again Force is a byproduct of mass and acceleration, of which Blake Griffin was top of the NBA scales for both. He was getting injured before he even played a game in the NBA, hence why he missed his entire rookie season.    And the whole point is that bigger more athletic guys put more force on their joints. It makes sense they would have more tweaks."
"Want to source that take?   Because more weight at faster velocity equates to more force on the joints.  Jokic is also super unathletic, that hurts your point.   Again your making assumptions, tons of guards and wings get injuries because they are asked to cover much bigger areas in the court at higher velocities.    You take just doesn’t make sense. People want Zion to loose weight to reduce his injury risk, and his athleticism and play style increase his risk of injury because of how athletic he was. Look at Blake Griffin as another example."
"Im afraid for Embiid.  Everyone on r/Sixers is convinced he just needs a few games off to get healthy but as an outside observer of the team, what did you see during that game from Embiid?  I think the injuries are starting to pile up for him like they did Blake Griffin."
"We were also playing bullshit iso ball, Middleton couldn’t buy a bucket in Brooklyn and Jrue struggled to hit layups all series long. And our two best bench players against the Heat managed to play themselves out of the rotation. Blake Griffin is not the first person to sag off Giannis and the Nets were not the first team to let their centre play Giannis one-on-one (see also: Phoenix Suns, who did not hold us to 80-something points in back to back games)."
"Blake Griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge, Deandre Bembry, Patty Mills. The Nets front office is world class."
"Nuggets have been an average or better defence for 3 seasons straight.   And having a good defender at the 5 isn’t a requirement. It helps, but at the same time having MVPs and good teams around them is what wins you rings. If Brooklyn was healthy last year they win the ring because no one could match their fire power and they were playing Blake Griffin at the 5.   And there has never been a 5 as good at shooting 3’s as KAT either and we play in a 3 point era.   And the dude has played in Minnesota his whole career, which is really what you are holding against him.    And I’m saying your view is skewed. Same logic was used against “jump shooting teams” for years that jump shooting teams couldn’t win titles. KAT is easily talented enough to be on a title team, he just is stuck on a organization that routinely wasted players prime years."
"I watch like every sixers game, but I pretty much only watch sixers games, and I feel like I have a flawed view on a lot of players because of this haha. Like, based purely on what I've seen live against the Sixers, Demar and Blake Griffin and Derrick Rose are NBA 1st team but Donovan Mitchell and KAT ain't shit lol"
Blake Griffin taking charges. And really just hustling.
"UVA was repped hard tonight between Hunter and Joe Harris!   I think Hunter's number should've been called more, dude was hitting shots over Kevin Durant and easily blew by Blake Griffin, the Nets played well defensively tonight but nobody on the team had an answer on this guy"

"Blake Griffin gets jealous of every big who plays above the rim these days, and coincidentally Blake Griffin constantly commits dangerous fouls on those players while they're in the air. Total coincidence."
Does Blake Griffin ever hit a shot
"It’s not one player.   Anthony Davis quitting on the Pelicans (with blatant tampering by the Lakers, by the way), Harden quitting on the rockets. N other players can make the same threat - we’re all worried Dame could do it next.  The rules around buy-outs are also likely to be contentious, very few were happy with the Blake Griffin situation.  General circumvention of cap is interesting too - the Lakers managing to go up in cap to get Westbrook though a series of weird exceptions is a bit of a violation of the spirit of soft caps and bird rights.  It’ll be interesting."
"He was never known as a shooter. At most he was a guy who could hit a jumper every now and then to keep the defense honest, like a Clippers-era Blake Griffin. You make it sound like he was Bertans or Porzingis."
blake griffin also played in a league where 6’7 dudes didn’t frequently play center tbf

"Anyone that has made any kind of comment about Isaiah Stewart being soft or fake tough after what we've seen already have brain damage and wouldn't need him to make it any worse. Proof: Blake Griffin talking shit, Stewart would tune him like a grand piano"
Blake Griffin plays like what I imagine a fart would play like
Good. Blake Griffin hasn’t been good since he left the Clippers. Supremely overrated dunk merchant who only shined because of CP3
"George hill,Wayne Ellington, Blake griffin, joe ingles,bismack biyombo"
blake griffin looks like a muddy dog.  ugly ass
I don't care what he does Blake griffin is and always has been a certified bum.
He’s probably gonna retire early. Or he’s gonna become one of those Blake Griffin types where you can se Basketball is not really their priority anymore (except Blake’s slightly reignited in the nets).
"In all fairness we were kind of trash last year with organizational issues (worst record since 14-15, Stevens/Ainge removed from their roles, the Blake Griffin report), go ahead and throw that 2020-21 Celtics team in there too."
"Hasheem Thabeet went second overall in a draft that featured Blake Griffin, James Harden, Curry, Derozan, Brandon Jennings and Ricky Rubio within the first 10 picks.   It’s almost like teams misevaluate players constantly."
"It’s always weird to see Team USA practices with future NBA players in the background. The one video with that Blake Griffin dunk had LaVine, Booker, D Lo and a few others in the background."
i could beat blake griffin up (i weigh 110)
"lol this isn't like a Blake Griffin or Andre Drummond situation with $30 million a year  he's going to make $47 million on next years player option, unless a team is willing to pay him..maybe 40-45$ million he won't take a buyout"
"""dated""  I'm pretty sure it was about Blake Griffin but he was trying to just fuck and invited another chick with him on his date with her. 🤣"
"Stewart is a hothead. I won't be surprised if he makes the news for domestic abuse a few years from now. Weeks ago, he also wanted to fight Blake Griffin."
Luka could have been their Blake Griffin. Just sad man. That choice set back the franchise a decade at least
Does it make you feel any better to be reminded that the Pistons are still paying Blake Griffin almost $30m this year?
Ricky out rebounding Kevin Durant and Blake Griffin to this point 🤣🤣🤣
Blake Griffin out here fuckin mauling people lmao wtf
Blake Griffin and Dwight Howard...they both fit hete
It reminded me of the Clippers vs Rockets fight back in January 2018. The next match up was supposed to be so interesting but then Blake Griffin got traded and Austin Rivers ended up apologizing to Trevor Ariza over the phone Lmao
"That’s what I thought to myself after Isaiah’s first fight with Blake, but then they kept doing it. Over &amp; over &amp; over again. Although I’d hope Lebron’s more mature than baby griffin"
"Well, who would know more about fake toughness than Blake Griffin?"
Blake Griffin
"Lol starts off with notorious tough guy, Blake Griffin"
"And whose career playing time were we comparing it to — is it literally the other human central to this discussion (LeBron), and you have incredibly poor reading comprehension?  Yes, and also yes. For instance, here’s what you responded to:  “Oh and not to mention Stewart’s insanely high incidents-to-playing-time ratio — the current nephew narrative here is that LeBron is the dirty one, as if Stewart wasn’t just standing over Blake Griffin last week for no reason”  To which you replied, **in a discussion centrally involving LeBron**, that we were not in fact talking about LeBron. Smfh."
"There’s boxing out, and then there’s what Stewart was doing — Stewart was vastly into “this is beyond box out” territory  Then again what do I know, I’ve seen every Pistons game and Stewart was literally standing over Blake Griffin like last Tuesday, bc Stewart actually has an insanely high incidents-to-minutes played ratio unlike every post on this subreddit acting like that’s LeBron"
"It’s hilarious how much it’s being overlooked that Stew was literally shoving LeBron at the outset  Oh and not to mention Stewart’s insanely high incidents-to-playing-time ratio — the current nephew narrative here is that LeBron is the dirty one, as if Stewart wasn’t just standing over Blake Griffin last week for zero reason"
Lmao at the idea of Blake Griffin of all people calling anyone a studio gangsta
Blake Griffin is 10 ply
He's been getting a bit edgy this year. He went at Blake Griffin a bit a few weeks ago
Blake Griffin was a walking dunk highlight reel back in the lob city days. Great example!
R/nba circle jerk is a bit too much 😂. Now people are calling Blake griffin soft for him liking a joke on twitter.
No one cares what bitch ass Blake Griffin has to say about the situation lmfao. Just hide the equipment managers so he can't swing on defenseless employees.
Blake Griffin had an entanglement with Stewart not long ago. I’m pretty sure he has no love lost for the guy and isn’t doing this objectively.
"God that moment needed Shaq and Charles commentary, cause you know they low key be on Stewart's side.  Also, Blake Police Presence Griffin needs to take a couple seats."
"I agree not a menace just anger issues. He came after Greek freak, Blake griffin, and luka before this with enforcer type of plays. There’s history to this"
Yes liked by renowned tough guy Blake Griffin
"On a related note, IIRC there's a moment in the 2011 dunk contest featuring Javale McGee and Blake Griffin where color commentator Dwight Howard says, out of approximately nowhere, ""light-skinned brothers making a comeback!"" and none of the other commentators know what to do it. So, sort of?"
Blake Griffin is another example. Age and injuries and you can't compare his anymore with the player he used to be.
Should we add Blake Griffin to the list?
"I mean, after you have enough incidents, that should be a reflection of who you are.  He elbowed Blake Griffin, shoved Giannis straight to the ground, just threw an elbow into LeBron's ribs, and has generally been an aggressive, physical player.  Personally, I think that's totally fine.  This league needs its enforcer types.  But, if you're going to be an aggressive, physical player, you have to be ready to take it back, too."
Blake griffin was the peacemaker?
"Trust me, plenty of teams are letting blake griffin shoot"
Overlooked by this sub but him and Blake Griffin were basically wrestling a couple weeks ago on Blake's return to Detroit.
He went after Blake Griffin a few weeks ago. Guy won’t take any BS lol
"It’s understandable he’s upset, but you can’t act that way.. he’s had a couple instances with Blake Griffin as well. Never to this extent but still.. he’s a professional, he needs to be able to control his emotions. He’s only young too. That could impact his career if organizations think he’s going to be too much to handle."
"Ask Blake Griffin, you do not fuck with Beef Stew."
sophomore. yeah he's a dog. he punked out Blake Griffin in the nets game.
Blake Griffin currently has the NBA worst field goal percentage with a minimum of 300 field-goals missed per 82 team games by a player in 2022 at 31.4%.
"No, that still probably goes to the 84 class, that's why I said those two are one of the best, and I did not say the best. If you look at who was drafted in those classes it's hard to argue that they're not one of the best drafts classes . Steph Curry, James Harden, DeMar DeRozan, Blake Griffin, kyrie Irving, Klay Thompson, Kawai Leonard, Jimmy Butler all came from either the 09 or 11 draft class."
"Giannis lookin even spookier this season.  Seems like he's found a way to be more patient in his ball handling while still attacking the rim.  Previously it felt like if someone stayed in front of him on the initial burst, a defender you'd be surprised was able to ""stop"" him could thwart his drive (like Blake Griffin or some shit last playoffs).  But this year it seems like he's got something extra in his drives to the rim. Destroyed the Lakers with them, and more of the same against the Magic here."
Blake Griffin count now?
"Exactly.  Simmons could be post injury Blake Griffin for 4 whole years, except even more useless and not even contributing as a low end bench player.  If Simmons don't contribute, the Pistons will have mortgaged thier entire future for 4 years of 35 million in dead cap."
I think he’d play if he wasn’t in Cleveland. He’s just gone Albert Haynesworth mode since he got paid. Basically Blake Griffin but without the one good season
I’m not sure how many people have seen how bad Blake Griffin has been this year. The hitch in his shot has worsened. Opposing teams are encouraging him to shoot and he hasn’t made a 3 in several weeks. Outside of a few charges he’s taken he’s been horrendous. Spacing for the Nets is a nightmare.
No he isn’t. He doesn’t miss many games. Comparisons to Blake Griffin? Where😂? Literally the only similarity is they’re light skin guys who are elite dunkers. But Zach also happens to be one of the best shooters in the league
"Shawn Kemp, Blake Griffin"
"&gt;Fizzdale is a decent coach. Assistant coach with Miami during LeBron’s run. I think he could have the ear of the players more than Vogel. Vogel is a good coach but maybe this situation doesn’t demand his talents.   Fizzdale is atrocious, ask any Knicks fan. I also never said that Vogel is a bad coach but the roster clearly doesn't fit him and he's shown the inability to make the necessary adjustments to make this roster work for him.  &gt;Blake Griffin, Aldridge, weren’t bad for the Nets. We don’t need another superstar, just solid rotation players  Sure but when you look at the league there aren't any of those old ""superstar"" players left, they've either retired or been bought out a long time ago. The only guy who fit that criteria is John wall and he doesn't want to leave money on the table so he's staying with Houston."

"this is what i feel about blake griffin sometimes.  imo explosive/athleticism in the modern nba tend to not last. you have to be a shooter. same reason why ray allen stayed long, as with melo with how he migrated to become THE shooter from his transition from nuggets to the nuggets. same iggy.  and thats imo, its very likely we'll either see westbrook retire early, or goes to shit 4-5 year from now, or him signing vet min to another superteam/champion contender team."
"blake griffin hates canada, noted"
The entire reason the floater is so unguardable is that defenders can't guard it since they don't know if he's taking it straight up but mainly it looks identical to a lob   When u have Blake Griffin and LMA as his starting front court it becomes pretty fucking obvious its a floater so they can contest it
Blake Griffin with a classic 6/6/1/3/2 statline and game high +15
HELLO POLICE ITS BLAKE GRIFFIN FIVE FOOT TEN CHRIS PAUL TRYINA BEAT ME UP YO POLICE IM SCARED IM SIX TEN NBA SUPERSTAR
Blake Griffin has missed 21 3's in a row.
"Bruh, we really saw how well Harden could do with just a bunch of shooters and lob threats in Houston and then brought him to Brooklyn just so we can run him out there with DeAndre Bembry, Blake Griffin, Jevon Carter, and Bruce Brown."
Lob City Blake Griffin in person was wild. I was working for the opposing team stood up out of my seat when he got loose on a fast break.
"Blake Griffin dunks and the nonexistent Jalen Green rivalry with Cade.  Blake’s like a 4th/5th option now after sacrificing his knees for us.  Then Cade hasnt cared about Green at all. And they only face one another twice a season, hard for me to be invested in that"
Same when I see Blake Griffin rev up his trebuchet
"In Hindsight probably everyone chooses Steph. But looking at the actual picks, LAC, and  OKC, didn't mess up the pick. Sacto didn't either, Tyreke just fell off.  Steph probably doesn't become Steph at all those places either.  &amp;#x200B;  here is the picks to make it easier for everyone trying to discuss.  &amp;#x200B;  1. Blake Griffin - Los Angeles Clippers 2. Hasheem Thabeet - Memphis Grizzlies 3. James Harden - Oklahoma City Thunder 4. Tyreke Evans - Sacramento Kings 5. Ricky Rubio - Minnesota Timberwolves 6. Jonny Flynn - Minnesota Timberwolves 7. Stephen Curry - Golden State Warriors."
He looks like he want to Blake Griffin his way to the Warriors... This time Klay stays in GS.
"Y'all had us thinking Zo was a washed rookie who couldn't shoot and Randle was a diet Blake Griffin post-prime Mr. ""Wasting Good Talent"" lmao"
"look, this sub hates him, but Ben Simmons would be a better return than the hauls from these trades:   1.	Boogie  2.	Paul George 3.	Kyrie 4.	Chris Paul to LAC 5.	Harden to Houston 6.	Kevin Love 7.	Blake Griffin   he’s a 3 time all star, an all-nba talent, and he’s a top 3 best defender in the league   NBA teams always think they can coach guys up and get them right and whatnot. i guarantee there’s a coach and FO who thinks they will fix him and his value will be higher than most other options   like the Cavs keep getting mentioned in these trades and i know they can’t be offering more than like Sexton and some firsts. that would be so much worse than Simmons for every other potential star, but that’s what the other teams have   simmons won’t get moved for a nobody"
"All I know is that if Embiid suffers another serious injury(which is HIGHLY likely) the Sixers are fucked, and this will go down as a bigger contender bungle than the CP3-Blake Griffin Clippers."
The Nets already have spacing issues and that's with Joe Harris Harden KD and Patty.  But outside those guys the Nets have terrible spacing.  They cant afford another non shooter when they play Bruce Brown and Blake Griffin as well.  Unless he takes the Bruce Brown role.
"If AD is not Giannis’s primary defender and the Lakers are ok with switching someone else onto him, it’s cuz they know AD is not good enough to match up with Giannis.  AD doesn’t have the foot speed to keep up with him. If he did, they’d let him fight through screens and not give up the switch every time. The reason they do is cuz the Lakers know that there is no difference between AD guarding Giannis and THT guarding him.  So yeah not ALL 47 of his points are on AD. But that doesn’t change the fact that AD can’t guard Giannis. Giannis’s best defenders have historically been guys shorter than him but very strong. Like OG, Kawhi, Blake Griffin, etc. Since Giannis isn’t a shooter, it doesn’t matter that they’re shorter. And since they’re all quick enough to keep up with him when he drives and force a tough shot or pass out (with help of course).  So Giannis didn’t “destroy” AD cuz AD isn’t good enough to be tasked with guarding him in the first place."
"Griffin and Millsap aren't exactly great so far this season, I'll give you that. But Aldridge has literally been their best bench player, with Patty Mills not too far behind. And I should remind you that Blake was probably one of—maybe even the only—consistently positive player KD had for support on the court. Things change and this year is not last year, but still.  Harris on defense is true, he's had A LOT of yikes on that side of the ball.  Harden is hampered by the free throws, but should not and does not need them to be a superstar or the like.   Kyrie is an unfortunate blow because it gets rid of our most explosive piece of versatile offense. Mills somewhat replicates that, but he has too many cold  nights and lacks the complete arsenal. Bruce Brown is a similar story, though he can play some D to make up with it. I just wish we had even a third of the cap Kyrie is taking to just get a decent compliment shooter. I'm tired of seeing 40 ""almost"" assists a night. I'm tired of not having a second unit that can hold a lead.  But Nets gotta ride above. KD is KD and can do whatever he wants if he plays smart and to his ability. Harden gotta get straight. Those two alone should have gotten us at least one win out of those losses, but it's just not completely clicking yet, though it gets a little better every game.  A little off subject and long winded, but you are underestimating what the Nets have in their arsenal. It's not fantastic beyond KD and Harden, some could argue just beyond KD, but it's not terrible. At the same time, I get that some people outside of Nets fandom are grossly overestimating how the Nets as they are should be performing. Either way, they should be a little better than what they are now."
"Despite the headlines from last year, you can be for certain that Blake Griffin fucking sucks."
Getting cooked by Nets Blake Griffin should get you immediately cut by your team
"Ah yes, the ""no help"" consisting of James Harden, Blake Griffin, Patty Mills, LaMarcus Aldridge, Joe Harris, etc. Like if you can't at least go deep in the playoffs with that roster, you might not be as great as you think. Kyrie should be what separates them from ""Clear title favorites"" vs ""One of the most stacked teams of all time"". Anyone who even implies that KD doesn't have enough help is smoking huge amounts of crack."
"Nets offense is a big house of cards rn.  Their only interior penetration is Harden and Kyrie, one is not present, the other is not the same.   Without this, the offense is reliant on outside shotmaking, which is something that Kyrie is obviously good at, but also missing people like Joe Harris or Blake Griffin being insanely cold and the Nets needing more defensive-specialists like Carter or Bembry or Brown (through Brown has at least found other ways to be active on offense)  When all of that is failing, then it's just up to KD to hit shots. If Harden is having a bad night, and then the combination of Patty Mills and Joe Harris don't hit 6 3s combined, it's just KD left, especially against teams where Aldridge can't play because he'd be a defensive liability.  Kyrie would fix A LOT of this, by adding another + healthy interior penetrator, another outside shooter, AND another iso shotmaker. Alternatively, if Harden gets healthier he can get the offense moving more and less jump shot reliant, but that's also a bit limited since he hasn't been a consistent threat in the paint and the only Nets big that's a lob threat has been out almost the whole season"
id say blake griffin has a 50% chance
Blake Griffin. in his 2nd or 3rd season.
"Before it was, ""Look at everyone the nets are getting:  KD, Kyrie, Harden, Blake Griffin, Patty Mills, etc, etc.""    Now it's ""KD has no help."""
"How can people even argue KD has no help?  The nets have MVP and 3 time scoring champ James Harden.  LaMarcus Aldridge, Blake Griffin?  I guess don't really know who is coming off the Net's \*bench\*, but its not like KD is leading a bunch of crappy starters."
Even the crew calling the game sounded sad for Blake Griffin.  He got cooked so many times.
Blake Griffin considering becoming Ron Perlman's stunt double.
"Harden's Rockets came back from a 3-1 deficit against the CP3 Blake Griffin Clippers in 2015. Sure they're not on the same level, but it shows Harden was able to bring his team back."
"Don’t forget Blake griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge, the team is virtually the same as last year when everyone was calling them 2021 champ’s just off face value, now kyrie is afk and Durant has NO help?!?! Stephen A was one of the main people praising the team last year as well"
"Guard two players man to man and the other three defenders play a three man zone - two guys low and one at the center of free throw line.   Basically takes away driving lanes and mid range pull up for guys who are isoing or coming off a high screen.   It is hypothetically easy to counter by role players making shots, but with the Nets missing Kyrie and Harris it made them susceptible. If you’re the Warriors, you’re going to let Blake Griffin and Bembry shoot all night. Also the Warriors did a great job scrambling in general like they have all year."
"I thought Durant did a decent job passing out of it but it did take away any room for him to iso or get clean looks completely. If you’re the Warriors taking the ball out of his hands for Blake Griffin and Bembry jumpers, that’s an absolute W."
Can Blake griffin not fit that role?
Feel like Blake Griffin doesn’t get enough slander on here. Let’s make it a thing.
Blake Griffin 0-4 with 2 rebounds btw
Blake Griffin trying to chase Curry around screens lol
"Exactly. Steph was taking the more mobile, albeit not by much tbh, Blake Griffin to task the entire first quarter. Stick LMA out there and your risk Steph going completely nuclear and blowing the game open before you can get Harden or KD in a rhythm."
"They were. Blake Griffin went first, Steph went 7th."
So will Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin catching strays
"Key takeaways:  -Warriors may actually be better on defense than offense. Yikes.  -Run, hide, 3rd quarter Dubs are coming.  -If you run iso against the Warriors, you're done. The help defense and rotations are great.  -Deepest team in the league, everyone plays and we're down two starters. Another yikes.  -I need to see D Lee knock down a 3 soon or I'm going to start thinking bad thoughts.  -Durant looked slow tonight, don't know what's up there, but I'd expect a better performance next time.  -Curry on the inside track for MVP and it's not that close.  -Blake Griffin has to figure something out offensively, starting be a big liability."
Julius Randle is the player Blake Griffin thinks he still is
"I have no idea what the front office is doing, every time we get a good player we give them away for free. We are a trying to lose I think. They also could have taken obi topin and done much better drafting. I love d rose and Blake griffin, but they are injured or rest more than they play."
"Weaver also had a great rep...I think plumlee is an underrated talent...but a fit with Blake Griffin? Vs an actualshooter who showed potential, is younger, and you're not in a competing window anyways.  With all the money involved, talent, it is hard to wonder about these deccisions."
"Joe  is a great example of setting up an organization from top to bottom, He wasn’t even afraid of risk and taking a new change on kerr. More so even this year however fruitless, giving Kelly oubre so much money just out of respect when you have a generational talent and use this window while you are paying him because he ain’t going no where. You already made 100s of millions off of him and will make more later so a year or two of loses still feeds your brand.  Meanwhile that Kelly oubre is directly connected sort of with the warriors biggest western competitors. Took em to game 7, then didn’t sign ariza. Didn’t replace him, In fact even traded the minimum contract replacement James ennis for a 2nd round pick. That’s getting a saving on your savings!   Dolan is meddler seems to be a duck like Tillman , but he will spend. With the design of the tax you can only improve the team so much marginally with the constrictions that’s why warriors are paying ridiculous amount for Kelly oubre, It might give them an extra1-3 percent in the playoffs but remember kerr, Paxton, fisher, horry and the age of how many closets who might notice been worth or at least arguable on their contract yet they made vital plays.  You just have to take a shot and Thad why there are levels at this, that’s why it’s a billion dollar game. When sterling was around Blake griffin mentjoned he wouldn’t buy a recovery device that staff thought was helpful, it was sitting there when players got in after balmer came around. That’s culture of don’t worry about details you guys just focus on winning. Heck even cheap heat micky pays haslem to not even play just to be the culture.  The great org attend to details don’t cheap out on margins and staff, the players get to focus and channel tunnel Vision for the marathon of a title, even then. NO title is guaranteed"
"that's a neat take. I don't think you're right about it, but it's neat.  The Bulls could get to that rare 2x max cap space next year when porter comes off the books... given that the options kind of suck, they'll probably give Markannen the QO or re-sign him I guess, which would leave them room to go after one (Oladipo, Collins, Blake Griffin?). Trading for Wiggins, though, would blow that opportunity right up.  Would have to be a hell of a rehabilitation..."
"2k is hot garbage, half the legends from the past are literal copies of players nowadays. Not even exaggerating, Billy Cunningham was an athletic stretch big in the 60s so his entire player model is a copy of Blake Griffin down to the same tendencies and jump shot."
"If only the NBA didn’t have stupid ROY rules. Keldon played in 17 games last year and only had real PT in 13 of those games.   In baseball you have to reach 130 AB or 50 innings pitched the previous season to lose your rookie status, which for a starter (position or pitching) would be roughly 1/4 of the season.  In hockey, you can play in up to 25 games in prior seasons while maintaining rookie eligibility (there are sub-rules too but that’s the broadest baseline).  You’re telling me that Blake Griffin and Ben Simmons were rookies but Julius Randle, who played 14 minutes in one game before getting injured and missing his entire rookie season, isn’t?  TL;DR of my senior thesis: Keldon should still be a rookie this season."
While I agree with most people that it’s because the C position was weak I would also add he was a defensive monster but offensively couldn’t do anything other than dunk. So A. Offense oriented players are typically preferred by fans and B. He was the second big man to pair that contained a just as prolific dunker and more versatile but more importantly more popular player in Blake Griffin. TLDR: Blake Griffin was a better big man on the same team and significantly more popular which are key for the all star game and DJ was one of the few true centers above average in the league at the time.
"i know you probably meant this rhetorically but we can actually answer it using NBA stats' 2-man lineups tool - this wouldnt be specific to PnR defense but defense in general measured with points per 100 poss (drtg or defensive efficiency)  Melo and Kanter have played 99 mins together, if we only allow duos with equal or greater sample size we have these LINEUPS:   .D. Russell, .N. Reid  *P. Tucker, .C. Wood* (128.6 drtg)  .J. Harden, .C. Wood  .P. Tucker, .J. Harden  .D. Russell, .J. Culver  .O. Porter Jr., .W. Carter Jr.  .P. Millsap, .G. Harris  .D. DeRozan, .D. Murray  **C. Anthony, .E. Kanter** (123.8 drtg)  *N. Jokic, .M. Porter Jr.* (123.5 drtg)  *P. Millsap, .N. Jokic* (123.0 drtg)  .D. DeRozan, .L. Walker IV  *B. Griffin, .J. Grant* (122.1 drtg)   So it looks like theyre competing with Tucker/Wood (probably more on wood but no idea bc i cant watch rockets games without missing him on our team) and Porter/Carter (though Lavine is also a terrible defender which screws them over).   In the same vicinity are both Jokic/Millsap and Jokic/porter, but millsap is probably an unfortunate victim, and blake/jerami grant who are in kind of a shit situation anyway"
I hope the rumors to trade Lauri to DRose and Blake Griffin is true and would materialize.
"My first ever NBA game, Blake Griffin rookie year vs the Knicks. He dunked on Mozgov and Gallo. Been a fan ever since"
Blake Griffin
Like the Blake griffin commercial
I bet Blake Griffin and him would be hilarious together.
"For real, probably my favorite player ever is Andre Miller, he is sure as shit not the best ever. But I love the fact that he was a pg that couldn’t shoot but made it work anyway. His post up game was on point and he showed up out of shape every season. Down to earth dude from Compton that just had a great BBIQ, also gave up his iron man run to rag doll Blake Griffin.  The GOAT conversation? I think you can only have Greatest of their era or GOTE. So Russell, Kareem, Magic/Bird, MJ and LeBron are all GOTEs."
"I think they actually will do something about that 'stopping so the defender runs into you' thing that he's been doing. Similar to how they made kicking your leg out on a jump shot an offensive foul a few years ago.  Also, i feel like people need to realize the difference between foul baiting and flopping. What Trae is doing is annoying, but it's not flopping. He's exploiting the rules to make defenders foul him whereas flopping would just be acting like he got fouled when the defender didn't even make any contact. Guys like Lowry, Smart, Dillon Brooks, Blake Griffin, etc are the worst floppers in the league. Trae, Harden, Jimmy Butler, etc are the worst foul baiters in the league, but there's a big difference in that the latter are actually drawing fouls even if they're exploiting the rules to do so."
"Al Horford, Blake Griffin and Kevin Love"
Blake Griffin is the most tenured Piston
"Oh Siakam played next to Ibaka and Gasol.. it’s like he’s a PF and those other guys are centers.. wow such sharp observation!   Now you really got me thinking about Blake Griffin playing next to Deandre Jordan or Andre Drummond, and how losing both front court partners that provide so much really really turned Blake into a shell of himself.. but wait that is not how it is at all!  Or unless you’re saying Ibaka and Gasol are actually the Pascal whisper and that he can’t hit open shots without them?"
"Handles have nothing to do with being a playmaker it’s about dribbling mainly. Draymond doesn’t have a good handle and he runs golden states offense, Blake Griffin has never run his teams offense unless his point guard has been injured as well and he has great handles.  Kd is also in the convo for PF’s if not at the top"
"That team is absolutely atrocious. Not much you can do with a broken Blake Griffin, a rookie PG, and a Derrick Rose at the tail end of his career. It's very much a development season for them. They did absolutely the right thing by betting on Grant and I hope the basketball gods reward them."
"What i have found as a lifelong mavs fan is that a majority of its  true fans are silent and humble. Of course as for any fan base there is an annoying loud minority. As a whole,  though, many of us model our ideals through a spiritual embodiment of Dirks essence. And then we gather every year on December 41st and pray to Mark Cuban to draft as many 5'10 point guards as dirk wishes. And every year Blake Griffin says, no. And Chandler Parsons loses a knee."
I was really hoping for pick + Wiggins for Blake griffin
Hey be more creative  We can also trade for Blake Griffin or Westbrook or Lamarcus Aldridge or Al Horford
"CP3 is the last I would blame for the Clippers' failures. Blake Griffin was injured just as often. DJ was not the same level of player as a Bosh or Draymond Green and they even at times had to take him out at the end of games because of his FT%. Jamal Crawford almost always shot the ball like ass come playoffs. Doc Rivers deserves some blame too.  Chris Paul averaged 21/4/9 and 2 steals on 48/39/88 shooting in the playoffs during his time with the Clips. If they had a third guy who was a bit more versatile than DJ or even a bench guy like Manu/Harden instead of a one-dimensional player like Crawford I think they would 100% have done better. Again, CP3 is the last of the bunch that I would blame."
Lmao. Shawn kemp was like a poor mans blake griffin. You cant be serious
"Is this the part where I say “the league is better with a healthy Blake Griffin” and get 10,000 karma?"
"Blake shouldn't even have been on the court, but even then I have no idea why Casey would just passively switch there. Just accepting to put Griffin on an island against Tatum without even trying to keep your best defender on the guy everyone knew would look to take the final shot. Just a perplexing defensive strategy."
Blake Griffin with the killer defense
"Lmfao yeah dude please keep telling yourself that, there’s not one person on this planet who’s going to do anything but laugh in your face if you say Dwight Howard in 2013 with LAL then 2014 with Houston was better than Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Jamal, Lou Will, and Reddick in their prime   Zero nba knowledge you hate to see it"
"Neither has James Harden but all the same things they hang over Harden for not winning in the playoffs (he’s gotten to more conf finals than Chris Paul wirh worse teams) they don’t like to put on Chris Paul, who has had much more talented teams and still choked away playoff series  Edit: Blake Griffin is probably squeaking into the hof but I know what you mean"
What are the Piston’s plans though? They used up most of their cap space taking on Blake Griffin and Jerami grant for what purpose? To maybe be the 10th seed for the next few years? They need to tank and use the space to take on bad contracts for picks  Too many teams fall into this trap trying to overpay middling players to remain mediocre and it only delays the rebuild
I remember him being called the European Blake Griffin
Is Blake Griffin drunk?
"Pistons didn’t look bad at all against us. Their 3pt shooters can shoot, in Svi and Bey. Their high usage options can score, in Grant and Rose. We play a *lot* of guys who are below replacement level, the Pistons don’t play anyone who’s *super* below replacement level, which is how you really get to a 15 win season— there’s no rookie Kevin Knox on that team. (If Killian Hayes isn’t missing literally all his shots, Blake Griffin is actually looking like the worst bead on the string.)"
"Yes, you can't be a winner unless you win. That's kinda what ""winner"" means. You can say someone is a great player, an all timer, HOF, whatever descriptor you want to use, but if you say ""winner"" then they should have won. Chris Paul has been a *great* player, no question. He's a top 5-10 PG of all time, IMO. But are there some things about him which detract from his overall greatness? Sure.   For one thing he's been pretty injury prone over his career, sometimes suffering injuries which many people have felt have cost his team a chance to win a series (or even the championship, as was the case in 2018). For another thing he's got a reputation as being difficult to get along with as a teammate, as evidenced by his feuds with Blake Griffin and James Harden, and possibly Doc Rivers.  Chris Paul has all the talent, and he's been on some truly great teams, so the fact that he hasn't won should raise a few questions. Can anyone really say he played no part in some of those teams coming up short or disappointing? I think he played his part, no doubt. So it's tough for me to call him ""a winner"" when he literally has not won."
"I come out from watching the game with one lesson learned: Blake Griffin is done. Air-balled a three, short on a foul shot, can't move on defense, can't rise anywhere near his past hops, telefaxes his passes for defenses to read... how disappointing. I used too think he would help Denver or a team that needs a PF. I don't think this is the case. He might still have good games coming, and I will always love hime, but he ain't no good."
"&gt; unlike Melo he hasn't really done anything to tarnish his reputation  Right or wrong he's had some pretty well documented feuds with James Harden and Blake Griffin. Maybe that's all their fault and there's nothing he could have done different, but that's definitely a small stain on his reputation, IMO."
"*65 wins  But also, why *didn't* they beat the Warriors? Isn't it in large part because Chris Paul got hurt and was unable to finish that series? His being injury prone is a big part of what's held him back. He was also struggling with injuries the year the Clippers blew that 3-1 lead to Houston. Another part is the way he's feuded with some of his best teammates over the years, Harden among them, along with Blake Griffin. Maybe if he was easier to get along with (and I'm not saying those other guys were free from blame), those teams would have rose above and won. I don't doubt his talent, but these are very real critiques of him as a player and shouldn't just be glossed over."
Blake Griffin is a shell of him former self. Due can barely walk down the other side of the court.
"Blake Griffin played with roller-skates on, is that legal?"
"Blake Griffin costed Detroit this game tbh, some really poor shots and defense down the stretch"
Blake griffin looks disinterested all throughout the game.no effort on D and rebounds
Blake Griffin was so bad in the last four minutes
"Blake Griffin cost us that game, and I'm all for it."
Blake Griffin is the last person on the court you want to take that shot... it looked like it was a designed play for him.  What are you thinking?
"And then he blocked Blake Griffin on the other end. As a salty Pistons fan, fuck this kid. Without the salt, guy is gonna be multiple time All Star and frequent All NBA presence."
"Horrible footwork by Griffin there, trips on his own feet, wide-open shot for Tatum.   The downfall of Blake Griffin is so depressing to watch, the man is still so talented though."
Blake griffin guarding Tatum on the last shot is not ideal lol
Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin turning into Pascal Siakam
I like Dr. Doum for Sekou if he becomes good. I want something for Jerami Grant if he doesn't have anything already and I don't think Blake Griffin has a nickname either.
Mason Plumlee and Blake Griffin are two aptly named dudes.
"Basically 2018-19 Blake Griffin, plus the bubble/catching COVID"
what about JJ redick and blake griffin they both said they loved playing with him.
Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan used to get it a lot.
"PG: Westbrook, SG: Kobe Bryant, SF: Carmelo Anthony; PF: Blake Griffin; C: Nene  I think they will dunk a lot"
"Yea, people just like to complain. I actually think zion will be a pretty great passer for position in time. Might be SVG implementing a new system and likely a lack of preseason and training camp. I've just watched this dude throw too many dimes at Duke to think his playmaking is actually lacking.   He'll never be a high assists number guy, but he kinda reminds me of blake griffin in his passing. Once he has the system down, he'll turn into a guy who murders double teams."
"Plumlee isn't meant to be the draw for picks, more so that we have some sort of competent C. You mentioned how Bey looked nice, who is a late 1st rounder, so obviously late firsts do help? And you mention we need vets around our rooks, we have Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Plumlee, and Grant who are all starting quality vets, is that not exactly what OKC did? Weaver literally came from OKC and learned from Presti, I'm sure his goal is to replicate something similar."
Plumlee and Grants contracts are actually not bad value at all. Blake Griffin will be lucky to average 15 for the rest of his career. Outside of play in tournament status teams will not care at all about regular season standings and may regret it.
I was at the Blake Griffin game; it was pretty funny.  Barea got a standing ovation walking off the court.
"When we played them their shot wasn't falling... they were shooting 30-something percent, but the game was close and then they pulled ahead b/c we couldn't rebound against them to save our lives until later on in the 2nd half (and Blake Griffin not coming back for the 2nd half prob saved us)."
"99% of draft boards in 2018 had Luka-Ayton-Bagley as the top 3 picks, with people that saw Luka saying that he was No.1 for sure and people that only watched NCAA basketball having Ayton No.1. Trae was never even in consideration for a Top 3 pick.  It's easy to say now that they should've picked Trae, but that's just dumb, nobody knew at the time that Trae would be this good and after Ayton was gone at 1, Bagley and Luka were objectively the better prospects remaining, Kings just picked the wrong one.  Saying this would be the same as saying that the Clippers made a mistake picking Blake Griffin instead of James Harden in 2009. Yeah, we know now that Harden turned out to be better, but Griffin was by far the best prospect in a draft that featured Harden, Steph, DeRozan and Jrue Holiday."
The Blake Griffin one you can see the momentum and him pushing himself up. The LeBron one it just looked like he had no momentum and someone just started rewinding a footage of him falling.
"Except for Blake Griffin for a spell early in his career, no one else has ever been the finisher that Amar'e was, no one ever, not KG, not even Shaq"
That pistons team isn’t awful. They gave the hawks a late run for their money with d-rose and Blake griffin out. Hawks almost blew a 24 point lead that game
Blake Griffin did it better.
"Blake Griffin is Jim. Excels while doing the bare minimum. Completely content with his lot in life. Incredibly smart, sardonic, and painfully self-aware. Mostly because he messed up so much in the past."
Nah it was the trainer that was giving head to blake Griffin
Are you not going to use context and compare teams here? You should extend it from 2013-19. Harden is not a much worse defender. Harden is way better volume shooter from three as teams see what he does in the regular season in comparison to CP3. Defense collapse on Harden because he lacked a primary creator but with CP3 he had Blake Griffin. I can't believe Im actually debating this
Blake Griffin was better than that version of Shaq and also there's a guy called James Harden.
"As much of a non-shooter as my boi is, as soon as the other team brings the ball on our half, you are in Green's torturing chamber, in his much beloved playground. I love the way he can see every little bit of moves the offense is making. He is never ball watching, and has incredible recovery. He is small enough to keep up with guards and bulky enough to bang against most bigs. He gave Blake Griffin nightmares the last 6 seasons. I can't tell how many defensive assignments we've missed, can't count how many players thought they beat Steph, or Klay, or Iggy or Bogut, or KD; just to get a monster block, steal or deflection by Draymond: him screaming like crazy after a highlight defensive stop is just music to my ears lol. You can call him Mr. Triple Single, but he is an all time great defender."
"this  also,   NO TEAM IS TRADING DOWN FROM 1  Cade is right there with Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Kyrie Irving as far as 1st overall prospects go."
"Cade is an elite 1st overall prospect, think Kyrie Irving, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Dwight Howard  no team is trading that pick"
Tell that to Blake Griffin
"Definitely not good enough to be a Detroit Piston! Have you seen our talent?!? We have Blake “walks on one leg, but has expanded his game to the three point line” Griffin!"
"Blake Griffin? I think he doesn’t look good at all. It just makes me sad watching him play now and seeing the way he moves. He’s lost so much of his fluidity and explosiveness it’s crazy.  My list is KD, Lebron James, Brandon Ingram, Kyrie Irving, and Jayson Tatum."
If you’re gonna bully me say Blake Griffin instead :(
Blake Griffin has done something for the Heat?
Blake Griffin is the one player in BBGM that actually realistically drops 15 points when they age
&gt; if the Clippers landed a generational talent who had charisma(like Kobe) during an upswing in popularity for the sport  like say...blake griffin?    clippers were a better team for almost 10 years and hardly anyone cared out here even then.  thats more of an indictment than anything
&gt;m hindsight injury wise sure Clipps made the right choice  Injuries were the reason why they ended up trading him and using the get out of jail free card they had months after signing him to that extension. Blake's entire career is different without injuries you cant just isolate one injury and call it bad luck and say it was just hindsight that could predict it. HIs latest injury in 2019 wasnt anything significantly worse than the rest it was the final straw that broke the camel's back. This was always unfortunately going to be inevitable Blake was never going to have some career where he's balling out until 35.   A healthy Blake Griffin who never had to worry about injuries throughout his career develops into a legitimate MVP candidate. Builds off 2014 when he was 3rd in MVP voting and takes it to the next level just a different ball game.
So you'd take Blake griffin over Chris Paul? Weirdchamp
"Zion, Harden, Kat, and if these still count: Kemba, Vuchi man / Aaron Gordon, Blake Griffin"
Blake Griffin
Maybe a deal for Blake Griffin + Derrick Rose? The salaries are close and the Warriors do have some picks to throw in.
"I don't know whether Blake is injured, or he's just slow and not involved in the offense. What is the point of playing Blake Griffin for 35 minutes out there if he has such little usage rate and you're only letting him shoot like 7 times?  Might as well just sit him and develop other players if you're willing to lose anyway."
"Sure, you can call it not shitting on the Pistons... But you can't call it the truth.  ""Rebuilding teams"" wouldn't trade for Blake Griffin 3 years ago. They don't trade draft capital. Rebuilding teams don't tell their fan bases they're aiming for the playoffs. Rebuilding teams don't make the playoffs (even if they don't win when they get there). Rebuilding teams don't constantly try to trade for/sign new point guards they think give them the best chance to compete right now. Go back even further - they wouldn't have gone for Josh smith, brandon jennings, ben gordon, Villanueva if they were rebuilding. They were bad signings sure... but they were signings in attempts to win.   Troy weaver gutting the roster, getting three draft picks, going with a ton of young players, taking chances on young guys with checkered history, telling the fan base that they aim to be competitive but playoffs aren't necessarily a goal - that's what rebuilding teams do.   Pistons fans have been calling for an actual tear down and rebuild for years. It finally happened this year.  You're downvoted cause you're wrong as fuck and your flair is lakers. So it is relevant because it usually provides some kind of context. And the fact that you're not a bandwagoner and don't follow them makes less sense that they're your flair.  If and when you go to criticize a team - make sure you know what you're talking about or else you look like a fucking idiot.   Being shitty/poorly managed/irrelevant =\= rebuilding."
Seeing a hobbled Blake Griffin near the end of the game was pretty sad ngl
"can't think of anyone current  Matt Barnes all time is super good  Elton Brand, Corey Maggette, Chris Webber, Peja Stojakovic, Mike Bibby, Stephon Marbury, Jamal Crawford, Steve Francis, Penny Hardaway, David Lee, Allen Iverson, Andre Igudola, Lou Williams, Baron Davis, Monta Ellis, Stephen Jackson, Jason Richardson, Amare Stoudemire, Steve Nash, Shaquille O'Neal, Grant Hill, Jared Dudley, Gordan Dragic, Dwight Howard, Vince Carter, Rashard Lewis, Jameer Nelson, Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom, Andrew Bynum, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Caron Butler, Eric Bledsoe, Chancey Billups, Danny Granger, Antawn Jamison, Marc Gasol, Mike Conley, Zach Randolph, Demarcus Cousins, Rudy Gay, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, David West"
Yep think this list pretty much has most of the bigger names that would qualify. Only other guy I can think of that would maybe qualify is Blake Griffin.
"LMAO I love how the man coming in a distant 3rd for MVP was twisted into his head as his MVP season, to the point that we’ve started calling it his MVP season. Did Blake griffin have an MVP season in 13-14?"
for me you see how players really work to get to their spots. here’s an example remember that fake pass blake griffin did between his legs to get open for three against the lakers? he did that shit all the time that season because the pistons ran dribble hand offs a lot.
Hands too. - Blake Griffin
Lmao why is Blake griffin in this graphic
Blake Griffin vibes
Giannis?  Let's see if he can be Blake Griffin 2.0 first because I'm not sure about that either.  The OP is obsessed with Giannis (in a negative way) and has a pretty solid amount of dumb threads about him.
"I mean if you were like Sabonis maybe. “Coach, give him a rookie max and two years and he’ll start ‘expanding his game’ like Blake Griffin because it hurts to dunk”. Meanwhile Coach, I’m just gonna age like fine wine or Marc Gasol.”"
[The Clippers traded Blake Griffin 6 months after a cringeworthy free-agency pitch in which they raised his jersey to the rafters and likened him to Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi](https://www.businessinsider.com/clippers-trade-blake-griffin-after-cheesy-free-agency-pitch-2018-1)  Bitch ass move after all of that.
hopefully this dude doesn't become blake griffin 2.0.
Blake Griffin is a high ceiling for Zion.
I hope this front office is smarter than that but I can see them doing that for a “star”. Unfortunately it’ll be someone like Blake Griffin so same outcome.
"Detroit Pistons are certainly your team. They’re the closest team to Canada, as you can see Detroit from Canada. They have two all-NBA players in Blake Griffin and Derrick Rose, which there are teams out there that have never had a guy make all-NBA.  Mason Plumpee is in his 7th season, which is a known notorious time for players to really make a jump in skill, so it’s possible they have another all-NBA guy soon. Jahlil Okafor is a former top 3 pick, and he might explode into an all-star soon as well. Between Griffin, Plumlee, and Okafor they average a whopping 28 points per game! Not only that, all 3 combine for 0.8 blocks a game, so they have some real dominant rim protection!  They have a rookie named Killian Hayes, who has exploded onto the scene and is the top rookie out there right now, potentially their 4th all-NBA guy. He’s already averaging 4.6 points per game, so by the time he hits Plumlee’s experience he’ll probably be averaging 9 points per game! He shoots a blistering 28% from the field and 25% from 3 point land. This means that he hits roughly one out of every four shots he takes. Now that’s not quite Steph Curry level yet, it’s hard to envision him not getting to that level as a shooter going off of his promising start to his rookie campaign.  The fans are amazing and passionate fans. Ron Artest loved the fans in Detroit so much that he actually got a game stopped because he wanted to go socialize with the average Detroitian. They ended up fist bumping and having a great relationship even though it messed with the game.  So all in all, I don’t see a reason why not to go with the Pistons. The two already all-NBA guys are a great base, seeing Plumlee develop into one will be a treat, and I already explained how Killian Hayes may be the second coming of Steph Curry. I wouldn’t expect that much this year from them, but next year they are real candidates to break the all time wins record of 73-9, so you can hop on the bandwagon early and then when they take the league over you’ll be one proud papa peacock."
Blake Griffin . He lit up the league with his powerful dunks in LA. He’s hasn’t been a bad player since going to Detroit but he didn’t develop into the superstar I thought he would be.
Blake Griffin is a vet now. God damn I’m getting old
Blake Griffin  PJ Tucker  Aron Baynes  Ben Simmons   JJ Redick  Devonte Graham  Lonzo Ball
"blake griffin hasn’t dunked the ball much in years. that doesn’t matter. he washed cuz he can’t move at all, go back to 2018-19 and look at how he could keep the defense honest with his speed to get open and get a shot off and then he’d dominate down low. now he doesn’t have that speed and the defense should welcome him trying to dribble the ball because you can play up on him closer"
Bruh he's Blake Griffin 2.0. His best days are gone. His game was about quickness. He lost his first step it's a wrap!
It’s is a dumb take but I don’t actually think Simmons should be taking 3s personally. Some people just aren’t shooters and shouldn’t be shooters and he’s one of them imo. His ft% and inability to take pull ups even close to the basket suggests to me that trying to shoot 3s isn’t addressing the root cause of the issue. I don’t see a world where him shooting 3s actually adds value. It’s not like Blake Griffin/AD where they learned a pull up game from the elbow and extended their range over time.
"I definitely agree for the average rookie, but there some guys that come in  who’s talent is so undeniable that you have to give them the keys to the team early on, like, ironically enough, Blake Griffin, or Ja last year."
Also Blake Griffin
Blake griffin and kyrie
"Are you really saying old as fuck ray allen, fucking mike Miller, fucking shoot less than 30% Danny green, fucking don’t know the time JR are amazing? I guess regular all-stars like Blake griffin must be a god for you."
"Pisons: I got Jerami Grant, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Delon Wright, and Sekou. Outside of that I don't know anyone on that team lol."
pistons. jerami grant. killian hayes. blake griffin. uhhh mason plumlee yea it stops there
Gordons jump shot reminds me of blake griffin. He's got that hitch
"&gt; they would rather go play with zach lavine and the chicago bulls!  Yeah, at least that way they will get some shots. See: Jeremy Grant, who wanted to play with Blake Griffin."
"At this point, Zion is a worse player than Rookie Blake. Blake was an all star his rookie year and was putting up 22/12/4. At this trajectory, Zion would be lucky if he’s able to reach peak Blake griffin."
"Pels are going to be fine.  I'm wondering what happens if Zion turns out to be just Blake Griffin 2.0, so a great talent, spectacular player, able to score a lot but not good on defense.  Their whole franchise is on his shoulders and it feels, maybe I'm wrong, he's not the actual next big thing.   He's an absolute beast, and usually I prefer strong player instead of shooters, but I don't see him pushing the Pels high the way for example Luka did with Mavs as they gave him the key of the team.  So at some point they will have to decide a clear chain of command because right now Zion doesn't look like a first option, not when you got Ingram, but it seems pels are pushing to have Zion as their main scorer.  We'll see. I think Adams and Bledsoe are really good for them to help on defense, but it feels ther's nobody in charge for the team. They need to figure out who's the go-to-guy, their leader."

"Blake Griffin is a much better passer than Zion.  ""Zion is a good passer, his teammates just miss open shots"" lol ya him and literally every other player in the league can say that.  I'm sure Zion can and will improve that area of his game but Griffin has consistently been a great passer for years, especially for a big man.  Screaming ""YOU DON'T EVEN WATCH GAMES"" doesn't change his valid point."
"Honestly bro. This is what I'm talking about.  You posted this long rant claiming that people are simple minded and that wondering why people talk about him more that Kyrie, Harden and Bron. It's just absurd bias toward him. Criticism doesn't mean people hate him.  Shooting as basketball is not that hard. I know we want to make it some crazy impossible feat that Ben can't achieve for some reason. But people do not criticize him for being a bad shooter, he's criticize because he literally won't shoot for years. I swear if he took one jumpshot a game the Sixers would not fall apart, but to even suggest that just has people rushing out to defend him.  Of course Ben is a good player as is. But this whole situation is unprecedentedly weird and knowing Ben's hype and ability out of college and the fact he barely shoots outside of the paint going on 5 years later is ridiculous. So many other ""bad shooter"" have at least tried to shoot. Some even have become pretty damn good ala Blake Griffin."
To me you’re speaking out of your ass with that. Zion looks pretty good but relax with that. He has looked significantly worse than Ja in the NBA in my opinion thus far and I see Zion as more of a next generation Blake Griffin but Zion doesn’t even have the passing that Blake did    I think you’re still just judging them based on pre draft reports
Blake Griffin?
Grant Hill and Blake Griffin
fuck Blake Griffin he bitches about every call.

Some sources say he had zipties and was prepared to lead an insurrection to overthrow Blake Griffin.
detroit. watch some derrick rose and blake griffin highlights
"Hello, this is Blake Griffin, Chris Paul is trying to get in the locker room!"
Just get rid of him. He's as washed up as Blake Griffin.
"I need a shirt with Blake Griffin, Derek Rose, Jerami Grant, and Mason Plumlee on it thats says “My clip is empty.”"
"Hey this is Blake Griffin, Chris Paul tryna get in the locker room. Get down here save me!"
"Probably not but the mental image of Blake Griffin calling the cops because of being scared of Chris Paul is hilarious. This, the steam room story, and the churros are the three best Inside the NBA moments (honorary mention to Chuck trashing the Suns)."
Cool as long as the league implement a rule saying players cannot be traded without their permission then players might start to think about upholding the contract. Ask Blake Griffin about upholding his contract.
"Blake Griffin would be great on TV. I’d probably want him or Embiid, Draymond Green, and Redick"
Well....Chuck did make fun of:  \- Jamaal the Cashier  \- the female population of San Antonio  \- Blake Griffin requesting police presence cause Chris Paul wanted to beat him up
"&gt; Remember that. If this was 2017 and I told you John wall, Oladipo , and a 20 and 10 player were on a team you’d say ok that’s a 4/5 seed.  If this was 2012 and I told you that Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, and a 25/6 player were on the same team you'd say ok thats a championship team   Critical detail there is that its not, in fact, 2012"
"Thad Young is a good call, he’s been a fantastic role player for the Bulls this year. I could honestly see the Pelicans swapping Bledsoe for them, should theoretically help both teams- Bulls get some backcourt defense and Pels get a small-ball 5 who pairs well with Zion. His contract is around $16m per year IIRC, so it’d be harder for contenders to match salary.  An even harder to match salary option from the Bulls is Otto Porter. Definitely can’t play the 5 but could play the 4 in stretches. Issue is that he’s on $25m a year and is injury prone. I think he could be a buy-out candidate, since he doesn’t match the Bulls timeline and they have better forwards on the roster. Another buy-out candidate is Blake Griffin, who’s rumored to want out of Detroit. I think he’d be a great fit for y’all, even with his athleticism gone."
"If I'm a piston fan or working for the pistons, this is a non-issue.  The team is bad and will be for at least a few more years.  They should under no circumstances trade away future draft assets period, let alone to get rid of blake griffin.   Even detroit isn't stupid enough to give up draft picks to get rid of a terrible contract that is one year away from expiring."
"Yeah nothing is new here, that's my point. It's run of mill but just the most recent example of a team being ""disloyal"" for fans to latch onto.  The trade itself wasn't anticipated, but there's more context to the trade. Blake had sprained his MCL again, in November of 2017. In January of 2018, the Clippers were 25-24 barely staying above water. CP3 had been traded and they weren't a good team looking to be a top seed in the West. Blake signed that contract knowing what he was going into, and things went sideways so they had to pivot.   From 2015-2018 he got injured multiple times, and missed the 2017 playoffs with an injury. Not sure if that's what ultimately lead to the trade, I just don't think people really pay attention to this stuff and see it coming out of no where. Blake, IMO, just didn't see the real vision and bought in quickly because he loved the Clippers. His quote after signing  &gt;""We've had some great meetings with them and love the direction of the organization,"" a source close to Griffin told ESPN's Royce Young. ""Feel that the best chance to win is definitely with LAC.""  Clippers were pre-season projected for like 45 wins, in a year when the Warriors and Rockets were clearly miles ahead of anyone in the west. This ""he got done dirty"" didn't make sense to me then, and it still doesn't make sense to me now. He bought into a project that never made sense without CP3 and he should've seen the writing on the wall even if it was emotional to leave the team that drafted him. He got played, and then pushed himself for a 1st round 4-1 series. I don't think Blake is the smartest guy out there"
"If the Pistons were going to trade away, Blake Griffin, given his current salary, they would need to give up first round picks to do so. Problem is, they have 0 tradable firsts at the moment."
"Trade Blake Griffin? Dude is shooting 36% from the floor, 31% from 3, and making money like he's a top 10 player. No one is touching him with a ten foot pole."
Blake Griffin won’t be traded
"""We can't let Blake Griffin walk away without getting anything""."
"Detroit is so fucked.   This breaks my heart. I knew it was a gamble trading for him to start with, especially with his injuries in the past.   It seems like any time this franchise gets a player who should be in their prime, things just go down hill for them fast.   Josh Smith. Blake Griffin. I mean... it was a little more predictable with Griffin, but damn.   They only way this team can trade that contract is by packing up a first-round pick with it, and Detroit desperately needs those.   They'll likely structure a buy out for him, but it's going to mean spreading it out over a few years, which will strain the cap for longer than his current contract does.   I mean, they JUST got Josh Smith's contract off the books. Now they'll start on this one?   Well... here's to hoping that Blake can get healthy and have a resurgence."
"I’m assuming the Pistons would have to pay him like 70 mil for the two years. So in the end they save 10 mil-ish. But it seems ridiculous on both sides. Pistons would never pay that much for him to go away, Blake would not give up a ton of money.  Is the talk really that Griffin would void a year? Then I would say absolutely zero chance he is bought out haha."
That one Blake Griffin dunk on Pau Gasol. The one where Bynum was in the background cringing after it happened lol.
When did the Lakers lie to Lonzo? Magic never said they would hang Lonzo's Jersey up there some day. He said they expect to hang his Jersey up there someday. It is very easy to argue that Blake Griffin is the most important player in Clippers history. Pretty silly to compare him to Lonzo.
My point is that players are willing to sign with the Clippers despite the Blake Griffin trade.
They should trade him for blake griffin. Good fit for both teams
Fuck blake griffin hes a piece of garbage
"The victim stuff here is awful. This looks bad for the Clippers because of the recruitment campaign being an absolute clown show and there should be zero doubt they knew that is what it was. It looks bad when you build a guy up that much as the face of your franchise and trade him soon after. I don’t buy any of this stuff about punching a trainer or the injuries in previous years. They gave him the max deal almost purely because they felt there would be a team that they could trade him to for a good package. They didn’t need to see him get hurt again to know the deal wasn’t good, they knew that was likely to happen when they gave him the max. Painting this as a last straw situation is ridiculous. You don’t sign your max guy and get blown away by an offer you never saw coming some months later. They sold the guy on being the face of the franchise so they could secure him as an asset to trade, that’s the business, but the business can look very ugly. You don’t need to make them out to be victims of unfair criticism here.  It certainly seems like Blake bought into some of the franchise face stuff. If he knew Detroit was his destination in the first year he might’ve wanted to actually pick his destination instead of re-signing. You don’t have to love Griffin to think that sucks for him. This has nothing to do with whether Griffin is a saint or not."

"He’s almost as untradeable as Blake Griffin. No one wants to give up any assets for Drummond. Maybe he’s worth a middle first round pick, cash, and a Mark Madsen type player."
"I seriously, super duper doubt they “realized” anything about Blake. They knew his injury history, they knew how good he was. They signed that contract knowing they were going to try to get off him with probably the first good offer. It doesn’t make sense that they needed to see some games of Blake without Chris Paul on a team that was never going to contend and a team with high hopes like this was never tying themselves to Griffin at that point in his career."
"No problem for Detroit then... they're sitting Blake Griffin, who hasn't been mistaken for a healthy player in at least four years."
"Oh I know he was so good I still see Blazers fans proposing CJ for Blake trades *this* year. Give it a rest Blazers fans, Blake Griffin isn't gonna work out."

"Nets somehow get Blake and Drummond.   Starting five: Irving, Harden, Durant, Griffin, Drummond.   Unbelievably dominant in the 4 total games when all five are able to play at the same time."
"Bro I feel you. I lost so much karma over the years defending blake griffin on this sub. It's all because of the overwhelming Lakers presence on this sub. Lakers fans have despised the clippers and been nothing but toxic since the CP3 veto. They control the narratives and discussions; everything in this sub is viewed through a lakers perspective. If you pay attention you can even see narratives form in the Lakers sub then move over to this sub and spread like wildfire. Easiest example is Trezz, he went from pure hatred to quiet admiration only because he swapped his uniform. I'm pretty sure the mods themselves are lakers fans at this point, it's ridiculous."
#FREE BLAKE GRIFFIN
"Let's not forget the time Andre Miller taught Blake Griffin that bullies get bullied:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQrNYIBw3fw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQrNYIBw3fw)  For whatever reason, I really dislike Griffin. He seems nice when you hear him talk, but his actions on the court and off the court (like beating that trainer) make him look like an asshole. I know he's now apparently loved by fans, but I still can't get over my dislike of him."
Blake Griffin should be exploring retirement.
Another Pistons fan checking in. I hope for Blake's sake this is true. It's been hard watching him deal with the Pistons' bullshit. (that video when he's talking about how the team needs to take things seriously and reggie was making faces and interrupting???? https://uproxx.com/dimemag/blake-griffin-reggie-jackson-video-bomb-walk-off-interview-pistons/)  I remain hopeful that a few years from now the Pistons will be worth watching again. Sometimes things have to get worse before they get better. I wish Blake well in the rest of his career.
"I own 2 NBA jerseys as a Pistons fan.  One is Andre Drummond, the other is Blake Griffin."

"ELI5(i.e not very familiar with NBA contracts), if the goal is to tank for Detroit, then doesn't having a bad contract help with that? Or is this Blake Griffin looking to leave? Ty."
"Depending on how the Blake Griffin saga is handled, he could have a decent argument."
It feels like everyone just forgot about Blake Griffin. I guess never being on the court probably had something to with it....he’s been disgustingly bad this year.
"Will Blake Griffin give up like 10 mil to be bought out? I can’t imagine.  If somehow he’s bought out, he’s definitely going to the Lakers"
First Drummond now BLAKE Griffin. Dang
"I love Blake Griffin but given his contract, Detroit’s time frame and his level of play why on earth is he able to demand this. I guess just to keep future stars from avoiding Detroit?"
I would rather see Blake griffin on the raps than Drummond.  Zombie Blake Griffin / Siakam / OG / Fred / Kyle
I miss seeing Blake Griffin highlights man
The much anticipated Blake Griffin vs Lamarcus Aldridge matchup must wait
He has games where you win because of him. We always did just enough to pick 9th. Only after we traded him last year did we finally start to bottom out. Unfortunately the season ended before we could fully complete the tank.  Hes not the worst person for a tank but not sure hes the right commander. Blake Griffin on the other hand is perfect.
You’re talking about the Blake griffin who has played in 53 playoff games averaging 22/8; who despite already having been ravaged injuries singlehandledly dragged the pistons to their only recent playoff appearance less than 2 years ago. That guy? The one who has literally been on winning/ playoff teams almost his whole career?
We tried that with dwayne Casey and Blake griffin/derrick rose. No dice
Blake Griffin looks woeful. No thanks.
Trade him for Blake Griffin. That way everyone loses
Trade DR and SRP + salary filler for Blake Griffin?
His contract blows period. You can thank SVG for that horrible signing while Coach and GM in Detroit. I’m glad we got rid of him. Anybody interested in Blake Griffin or Derek Rose?
Blake griffin changed the rulebook. If the NBA called those they'd have erased so many of his highlights so they just don't call it if you dunk it.
I urge you to go watch some Blake Griffin highlights young one
"Nah, it's always been that way. Like when Blake Griffin absolutely demolished Pau Gasol"
&gt;KP  Better example is Blake Griffin. KP is a noodle.
nice to see DSJ playing great!  Without Blake Griffin and Derrick Rose we are so fun to watch  the ball movement was beautiful
Didn't know you were friends with Blake Griffin
"I watch every celtics game which you clearly don’t. He started off the season rough with shot selection. Lucked into that bank game winner against giannis on a stepback 3 to start the season. Tried to do the same thing against indy and couldn’t hit the game winner. Learned from that against the pistons, worked to get the switch to blake griffin, took him to the key and pulled up for signature elbow jumper for game winner. Was also struggling to draw contact early in season but that is getting better too, was 12/13 from the line 2 days ago. He’s still adapting to becoming the first option, running the offense, and drawing trap double teams nearly everytime he brings the ball up. You don’t know what you’re talking about at all, his decision making has clearly gotten better if you watched games at all you would see his playmaking ability. And that 41% 3s on over 7 attempts per game are nearly all off the dribble as the teams first option going against hedge double teams and opposing teams best defender night in and night out, not to mention he just had 2 weeks off to covid and is still adjusting back. Wiggins couldn’t hit half those shots at a 41+% clip even off wide open catch and shoots from the corner. You are literally talking out your ass..."
You need a guy who’s been a superstar in the last 2 calendar years? Blake Griffin is your man.
"We're talking about tan, freckled ginger Blake Griffin? Michelle Wolf looks blacker than he does, and she's white."
Because he's just as much Tongan as Blake griffin is black
Exactly my thoughts. Like WHY wouldn’t Steven Adams classify as white? It’s not like he us Blake Griffin.
"Ibaka, Blake Griffin, Zach Lavine, Pascal Siakam. I’m sure there are some more I’m forgetting. I think Rondo has come along way too. You can’t disrespect him and play off like people used to."
Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin + 2nd round pick for an expiring rookie (2nd round pick) contract
Blake Griffin
"With Sekou I believe the main reason he doesn't get consistent minutes is because Detroit is so deep where he'd be playing.  To put it more simply, it's another Blake Griffin-related problem."
Blake griffin is career 70% ft which isn’t spectacular but he’s jacked as hell
costco Blake Griffin
Does Blake Griffin count? Or is he loudly playing poorly at this point?  12.3 points  36.5 percent shooting  31.5 percent shooting from deep  5.2 rebounds  3.9 assists  31.3 minutes  Love that dude but it's been rough.
"I remember there was a huge push to turn Blake Griffin from a dunker into a guy that could hit jumpers. IMO it made them a worse team overall, and he’s still dealing with injuries anyway."
Andre Miller for checking Blake Griffin.
Blake Griffin: old Vince Carter and Kelly Olynyk.
"&gt;No it isn't, it completely affects your window to compete. This core still has 3-5 years of their prime left, you try to compete for at least a couple of those before moving on.  Guy...you’re simply describing what’s *going* to happen. We’re going to “try and compete” (but not really) and flame out in the first or second round.   &gt;Please tell me what an NBA GM should've done in hindsight. Seriously, whatever makes it easier for you to find an example or precedent.  The Pistons should have traded Blake Griffin before last season  The Hornets should have traded Kemba before letting him walk  The Bulls *did* trade Butler when he was **27** in order to rebuild  Ohhhhh here’s a good one! The Magic! How’d I forget them? Yeah, Vucevic should have been gone a long time ago. They’re doing nothing but treadmill in the 8-11 seed every year (which is where the Raptors will be for the foreseeable future). If they traded Vucevic they would have not only gotten assets back, but also likely have a premiere young talent that they’d currently building around. But hey, at least they’re “competing”! Yay!  Shit, even the Blazers would be better off *long term* trading Lillard. Not that he isn’t great, but the team itself is capped out with little to no way of improving.   Hmm who else? Oh yeah, the Spurs! Another team that was under the delusion they were “competing” when they traded an established super star for a 30 year old regular all star, as opposed to rebuilding like they should have. Now, they’re either going to cap out as a middling team with good, but not great young players and again, a 7-12 seed ceiling (which is exactly where they’ve been the last few years).  These are just a few examples. Let me know if you need any more!  &gt;Teams only employ that strategy once they've exhausted all other options and their core is over the hill. Again, no team actually moves on from their playoff core while they're entering their prime years. The most you'll see a competitive team do is trade their expiring veterans, which we might do with Lowry. If I'm wrong, again, find me just one example.  Guy...you’re only describing what’s *going* to happen. I’m telling you exactly what *should* happen if our goal is to win a championship.   You’re thinking like a cheerleading fan. I’m thinking like a person who understands you need elite talent to compete in the NBA. You’ve sold yourself this dream of a “young core that’s going to compete”, when the second part of that sentence is “for a first or second round exit”."
"Happens in bball man. Chris Paul, Reggie Miller, Michael Jordan, Blake Griffin, Aaron gordon come to mind. The younger brother has to grow up faster to play with their big bro/sis and thus has to develop more skills"
"Oh, ok. I didn’t know we could exclude a player’s worst seasons.  In that case, I’m not counting Michael Jordan’s Wizards days. I also won’t acknowledge Kobe’s 2013-14 and 2014-15 seasons.  I’m going to start early with Blake Griffin. Nothing after his first season with the Pistons will ever count in my books."
"I feel like the Blake Griffin team was more entertaining before they started winning, as well. I don't know if it was Doc Rivers or Blake's injuries or my imagination, but they seemed to tone down the dunks and excitement. Considering what they accomplished in the end, I wish they had just focused on being fun. Might have had the same result anyways"
"Yeah just a few seasons afterwards though. Was duped by Elton Brand who told him to join while he bolted to Philly.  Was quite unmotivated because there's really nothing to play for until Blake Griffin was drafted, but by then he was traded for Mo Williams and we gave up a pick which became Kyrie.  His most famous moment as a Clipper was probably lobbing to Blake for the car dunk in the dunk contest."
Blake Griffin will have at least one (1) dunk this season
"Yup.  Baron didn't sign until 08.  Darius was gone by 02, LO gone by 03, QRich gone by 04.  Baron got here so late, he ended up playing with Blake Griffin for half a season."
Lob City before Chris Paul and Blake Griffin gentrified it with State Farm commercials and Kias
"I think the risk for Zion is to became a sort of new Blake Griffin or KAT so a player who put impressive numbers since his early season, who can't be effective on defense and then he remains like that forever.  KAT second season at 20 years was at 25+12+3 on 55%fg and 36% from 3 and 83% ft, unreal numbers for a player so young in his 2nd season.  People thought he was just going to improve and improve but KAT just remains the same player in a team that fails every season. And at some point if you can't get wins in RS people will stop to be interested to your impressive stats.  Cousins was another one example."
"Depending on both what you would consider his prime, and what a star is, you could say there were three (not directly related to injury) careers that rose and fell.  - Al Horford - OJ Mayo - LaMarcus Aldridge  For players with injury histories, there are some notable names.  - Brandon Roy - Blake Griffin - Derrick Rose"
 Blake Griffin
blake griffin overpowering somebody for an easy two. he don’t do that no more sadly.
[The Blake Griffin special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYJ4R6CxqEM)
He's the most physically gifted athlete ever.  To be 36 and still move like that is astonishing.  Put it into perspective Blake Griffin is 31 and he hasn't dunked in a game in two years.
Or somebody like Blake Griffin?
"As they should. Dude only just turned 20 and is obviously still on his extremely cheap rookie contract.   It kinda sucks that Blake Griffin is clogging up time for him, but he'll get out there more often."
Can I interest you in one Blake Griffin?
"Some “Mavs fans” want to trade him for the likes of Capela, Drummond, or Blake Griffin cause KP couldn’t defend Zion tonight."
there’s no way you think westbrook’s contract is worse than blake griffin
"Skill is way harder to develop than body, body is mostly genetics and it takes time to reach it's peak, also working out + eating well is what almost every NBA player does so reaching that is way easier  Skills are way harder, for example shooting is almost impossible to improve at an elite level no matter how hard you try, for every Blake Griffin, Kawhi there are hundreds of bad shooters who just remained bad"
"I think it would be interesting to look at average difference in win shares between the 1st and 2nd pick in the draft. You’ve got your Shaq and Alonzo Mourning cases: transcendent player and all star quality but far away in comparison:  Your Duncan/Van Horn in a transcendent player and a quality starter but the gap is bigger  Then the Lebron/Darko case: transcendent player and bust.  Like since 1990, the best number 2 picks have been KD, Gary Payton, Jason Kidd, and Alonzo Mourning.   An MVP all timer, two all time point guards who couldn’t quite be the best player on a championship team and an all star who was never really the best at his position.  Contrast that with the 1st picks with Shaq, Chris Webber, AI, Tim Duncan, Lebron, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose, Anthony Davis, and that’s just the 1st team MVP types.  Then you’ve got Kyrie, Ben Simmons, KAT, Larry Johnson, Yao, Blake Griffin, John wall, multiple time all stars who have been the best player on a playoff team (or in the case of Simmons and KAT will obviously get there)   That’s 15 guys in 30 years who can be the best player on a 50 win team. That’s good odds"
"There's actually a strong case for him right now playing better than Derrick Rose was playing in his rookie year.  Better advanced stats across the board, more steals, better rebounder, better passer, a VASTLY better 3 point shooter.    I'm actually struggling to find a stat Derrick Rose was way better than LaMelo at.  He's actually having a better **rookie** year than Durant as crazy as that sounds.  And no, I'm not saying he'll be better than Durant, cmon.  The one rookie whom I'm pretty sure had a better rookie year than LaMelo though is Blake Griffin.  [Derrick Rose](https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=ballla01&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;player_id2=rosede01&amp;p2yrfrom=2009)   [Kevin Durant](https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=ballla01&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;p2yrfrom=2008&amp;player_id3=griffbl01&amp;p3yrfrom=2011)"
Kemba Walker's dunking + Aaron Gordon's perimeter game + Kanter's defense = Blake Griffin
"You don't think agents try to negotiate that? Teams very rarely give that clause out to anyone, because they want to be able to treat players like assets.  That's why it's laughable when fans argue when you sign a contract you have to play it out and never complain. Teams on the other hand rarely ever gives out NTC to allow them to dump them anywhere no matter the length of said contract.   There's no loyalty in this league, as seen with Blake Griffin and Clippers, Demar and the Raptors.  *edit, also I just found out you are only eligible for a no trade clause if you have at least 8 years of NBA experience and 4 years with the same team. How's that for fair and balanced."
I have been desperate for this kind of effort for years. Surely he has his limitations but it's so wonderful to watch a guy go out there and give his all every night. That's what Pistons basketball's supposed to be about. Effort &amp; going to work. It's just been way too long since we've seen it (Anthony Tolliver &amp; 2019 Blake Griffin aside).

"Well, nothing the FO has done has led to a Finals appearance in forever, so why not? Cousins is a vet, and our team is depleted at center. He would love to play with Dame and Melo. Blazers need somebody who can attack the rim and not be shit down immediately in the playoffs based off of pure height. Does that come in the form of a draft pick? Blake Griffin? Ben Simmons?"
That’s some of the worst trade ideas other than Tucker. Griffin and Cousins do not make us contenders and Tucker is a but risky IMO. Trading CJ for washed Blake Griffin is gonna reduce our chances at any title aspirations we had left
"Rodney Hood for PJ Tucker CJ McCollum for Blake Griffin Sign likely soon to be released Demarcus Cousins And if so, cut Zach Collins Throw around picks here and there."
Hakeem Olajuwon and Ralph Sampson  Steve Nash and Amare Stoudemire  Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp  Tim Hardaway and Alonzo Mourning  Blake Griffin and Chris Paul
"I've noticed a lot in his highlights that he isn't trying to sky as much as he did in college. Much more grounded game to save this dude's knees. But I think since he's laying the ball up instead of trying to pose for a poster on a lot of plays leads to ""underwhelming"" highlights. And I put underwhelming in quotes because of the obvious.   I think they're looking at Blake Griffin and his lack of knees and trying to keep Zion as healthy as possible by keeping him under the rim as much as possible.   Of course I might not know what I'm talking about. Probably."
"I see a lot of similarity with Blake Griffin, who averaged 23/12/4 his rookie year. Except Blake was playing in the second largest city in the country..."
I have one Blake Griffin
"As an honest Nets fan, I think I speak for the entire fanbase when I say that this win doesn't count. We should package Har-flop and Kyrie for an elite talent like Blake Griffin so we can start winning real games. And I'm saying this as an honest nets fan."
Lavine???? 😭😭😭😭 Blake Griffin and a second take it or leave it
You looking at probably Blake Griffin and DeMarcus Cousins already.
Hes blake Griffin 2.0
"Andre Drummonds rebounding numbers are an obvious example. Blake Griffin this season is putting up empty stats this season as well (sorry blake), just look at someone like tyrese haliburton who’s putting up basically the exact same numbers but watching the game his stats are clearly more impactful. Anthony Edwards is another example, as much as I love his game the timberwolves are a team desperate for scoring and as a rookie he’s been tasked to help with a lot of that load. The flashes are there but his scoring numbers are not to the point where they are representing a positive impact on the team yet, but he’ll get there soon.   If we want to talk about inflated stats that’s a separate conversation but there is some overlap in some cases."
Sports Illustrated had him ranked 75th in the NBA.  https://www.si.com/nba/2020/12/14/top-100-nba-players-2021-daily-cover  Players ranked ahead of Lavine:  * PJ Tucker * Aaron Gordon * Bojan Bagdanovic * Blake Griffin
That dunk is NOT gonna be forgotten. It was VICIOUS.    Prime Blake Griffin feel of hype
Let's admit it: It was an offensive foul. It was Blake Griffin type of dunk. Edwards pushed Yuta with his left hand so hard that he elevated himself in the air.
kendrick perkins got fucked by blake griffin and the memes were everywhere lol
Remember when Brandon knight got destroyed by Blake griffin?
"&gt; Shouldn't it be more disgraceful for being too scared to contest a dunk?  that's what i've always thought, especially since the derozan over tolliver dunk in detroit  tolliver took it in stride tho, but nobody appreciated that he was the only one willing to contest; blake griffin actually stepped outta the way"
"I thought Yuta was avoiding/getting hit in the face by Ant's hand? Sometimes dunkers ""cheat"" ala Blake Griffin with the arm or hand to the face dunk."
"He's grounded lately, a little Blake Griffin-ish..."
"I'm not sure at all Boogie is currently better than Devontae Cacok their 2 way player or than a journeyman like Jordan Bell.  Like trust me I don't like to say that, because it's sad, but just like Blake Griffin, I just don't see how he helps a team, unless he randomly shoots 40% from 3 for the rest of the year"
"I don't want to sound too harsh but they can give mins to their 2 way players, or sign a random G League player.  Boogie is done, especially for a contending team.  He can maybe give some mins as a post defender since he's still super strong, that's all he can give at this point, he's even more washed than Blake Griffin"
"I mean, Blake Griffin made an entire career out of doing that. No way they'll ever call it."
I must be crazy because I just don't see what's so striking about this. It doesn't seem crazier than Larry Nance over KD or Blake Griffin over Ibaka / Gasol
"Left hand offensive foul, Blake Griffin style. They won't call it though. Pretty sick dunk regardless though."
"&gt; A few deandre &gt; A few Jr Smith &gt; A few Blake griffin   Are you telling me you think JR Smith, Deandre Jordan and Blake Griffin have combined for roughly half of the best 20 dunks of all-time?! That’s preposterous."
"He’s also one of the 3-5 best dunkers of all time, and probably the 2nd best in game dunker ever.  Saying Blake Griffin did it in no way makes it less crazy, Blake Griffin’s dunks were ridiculous and way under appreciated"
He was swimming like Blake Griffin.
"While I agree with you, we have definitely seen a lot less of it lately--and Blake Griffin is *quite* a bit taller than Edwards."
"Here's my attempt. I put slashes where I thought there was some debate or was uncertain:   * Thunder: CP3, Harden, PG, KD, Adams/Ibaka.  * Hornets: Kemba, Dell Curry, Glen Rice, Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning.  * Pacers: Reggie Miller, PG, Danny Granger, Jermaine O'Neal, Roy Hibbert/Rik Smits.  * Jazz: John Stockton, Donovan Mitchell/Deron Williams, Adrian Dantley, Karl Malone, Rudy Gobert.  * Clippers: CP3, World B. Free/Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Blake Griffin, Bob McAdoo.  * Pelicans: CP3, Jrue Holiday, Brandon Ingram, Anthony Davis, David West.  * Nets: Jason Kidd/Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Vince Carter/Drazen Petrovic, Kevin Durant, Brook Lopez.  * Suns: Steve Nash, Devin Booker, Shawn Marion, Charles Barkley, Amar'e Stoudemire. * Nuggets: Fat Lever/Chauncey Billups, David Thompson, Alex English, Carmelo Anthony, Nikola Jokic/Dan Issel.  * Magic: Penny Hardaway, Tracy McGrady, Rashard Lewis, Hedo Turkoglu, Shaq.  * Timberwolves: Stephon Marbury, Sam Cassell, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Garnett, Karl-Anthony Towns. * Grizzlies: Mike Conley, Tony Allen, Shane Battier/Rudy Gay, Zach Randolph, Marc Gasol"
"Clippers:  Cp3, PG, Kawhi, Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan."
Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin literally did the exact same thing to Pau Gasol.  Fans don't let things like rules dampen the hype.
Marcus Morris truly is greater Morris.  We used to call him that in Detroit when people thought Markief was the better twin.  We shouldn’t have traded him for Avery Bradley because that led to the Blake Griffin trade which was nothing good
The Blake Griffin special
Man has the same finesse and power as Blake Griffin
"&gt;Kyrie makes it a thing and now we got to talk about it.  It's been [talked](https://twitter.com/ByJayKing/status/995772597395771395) [about](https://twitter.com/NateDuncanNBA/status/990665814201188354) [many times](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/5/17/17362892/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-technical-free-throws) [over the years](http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/page/presents19409872/fifteen-feet-trouble) precisely because it's not normal for bad free throw shooters to routinely take tech free throws.  Shaq, Webber, Blake Griffin, Giannis, and Cousins didn't take tech free throws."
"Blake Griffin is essentially #2 (sorry, Jabari) in charges drawn per game, right behind Lowry. He was trying."
I would take the Nets with current Blake griffin over this team.
"Seeing as we were fine with trading DRose who was playing hard, he could have just asked us. I don't believe anyone is competitive enough to make it to the NBA, and then just not try for half a season. Like Blake didn't show once this season that he has the athleticism he had in 2019 this season. He was definitely coasting, but in that case you could usually see on occasion what they can do.  Marcus Smart literally said we target Blake Griffin because we know he's washed, and Blake still couldn't keep up. No way he's taking that smack and still not trying."
"Blake Griffin hasn’t even played with the Nets yet, and he’s extremely washed.  Joe Harris is a solid role player. He’s not a superstar or a star so there’s no point bringing him up.  He’s hardly played alongside KD as well. While I don’t think Harden is the frontrunner, you can’t argue that he doesn’t belong in the conversation."
Anyone who brings up Blake griffin and/or DJ as examples of Brooklyn’s star power is admitting they don’t watch basketball
"KD has been out for like the whole time that Harden has been a Net basically, and will continue to be for the next couple of weeks at the very least  and lol Blake Griffin..."
"He Has kd,kyrie,Blake griffin and joe Harris as teammates cmon now y’all"
"Not much worth noting since the potential roster is a whole bunch of players right now. [Zion did get to that list recently, though. ](https://abc7ny.com/sports/new-orleans-pelicans-zion-williamson-among-15-names-added-to-team-usas-prospective-roster/10407164/)  Probably a safe bet that Blake Griffin won’t make the final cuts."
I dont know about hearing but first time i saw an nba game on the tv i saw young blake griffin just FLYINY over dudes and dunking. Like he legit jumped over them I was like damn
"Blake griffin on the nets   If hes half his former self and they'rere is no horrific injuries they will laugh their way to a chip at worst conference finals   Even if its not the nets how many teams make you think "" they could win it "" Heres my list  Lakers  Clippers Jazz Whomever happens to be 2nd in the east Bucks?? Suns Nuggets Heat  I havent looked at the standings because before blake griffin to the nets i already knew it was nets,lakers,clippers and (insert random team that might make it to the finals but wont win), team that the bucks choked to, and the bucks.   if 6-8 are the only ones that shouldn't be blatantly tanking.  Whats the point? my team is one of the 20+ teams that shouldn't be trying because it would negatively effect them.  what's the point?  them winning 29 games getting best case scenario gentlemen swept by the nets? Why would i watch? I was saying this during warriors vs cavs 3 AS A CAVS FAN!!!!!  legit sports betting on the nba must be the best job ever   This shit yardsales a league"
"Nets with a Literal Big 3 of Andre Drummond, Blake Griffin, and PJ Tucker. Maybe even DeMarcus Cousins.     On top of the original Big 3 of Durant, Harden and Kyrie. And that's doing the glue guy Joe Harris dirty."
Kevin Durant   James Harden   Kyrie Irving   Blake Griffin   PJ Tucker   LaMarcus Aldridge   Andre Drummond   DeMarcus Cousins   DeAndre Jordan   Joe Harris   Jeff Green   Landry Shamet   Bruce Brown   Iman Shumpert   Nicolas Claxton   Tyler Johnson
Blake Griffin made a career out of dunking like that.
Blake Griffin is stand-up funny. Idk how he is conversationally though
Nets punching the air rn once they realize they gave their back up 4/5 spot of mf BLAKE GRIFFIN LMAOO
"I would imagine that adding James Harden and Blake Griffin to my team already having KD and Kyrie on the roster would relieve my stress level a bit. Nash is hopefully going to have a long career as an NBA coach, he's a good dude."
He's not worse than Blake Griffin
"What’s stopping them from just dealing him? Like someone else said, he’s not a guy you’re going to get a ton for because of his age, mutually part ways and let him start his next chapter  Drawing this shit out and just sitting him helps no one. Even Detroit reached a buyout with Blake Griffin, sometimes you just have to let the guy go if he wants out"
"People are acting that this guy will be huge help to some contender  He's done, even his defense and 3s have gone to shit, 31% from three and Houston are literally 10 points better on defense when he's on the bench  I'd rather have Blake Griffin with no knees not a 36 year old who is undersized and really not good anymore"
Aldridge fucking sucks. He’s worse than Blake Griffin.
 Zion is not even that bad for offensive fouls (this dunk obviously is). He had two questionable no calls against the Jazz and every Jazz fan thinks he is young Blake Griffin lol
"Who on the Nets can guard Lebron or Ad efficiently because it ain’t Kyrie, Kd, or especially Harden. The Lakers can’t really stop any of those 3 but at least they have the defensive scheme and the right guards for the job. Everyone on the Nets roster is bbq chicken against Lebron and Ad excluding a extremely healthy Kd. Blake Griffin is no help either on defense."
"Blake Griffin ain't even starting, relax"
Yea he's the fourth option with Blake griffin coming to lay everything up
"What I don't get is that when Harden got traded to the Nets, everyone was still saying the Lakers where the favorites and how the Nets had no defense, when did that Stance change? Was it when the Nets went on their winning streak or because LA hasn't really been that good without AD, like when AD come back will people start saying the Lakers are better? Or was it Blake Griffin signing that broke Lakers fans back"
Blake Griffin still a good passer
Can Blake griffin really help this team? As bill simmons asked: “is Blake better than Jeff green?”
The scary thing is that the Nets are going to get Kevin Durant back &amp; have Blake Griffin coming off of the bench. And this current squad w/out them is playing this well.   That's going to be scary in the playoffs.
"Tatum, Zion is literally Blake Griffin"
blake griffin special
"I kinda want to see a team of dudes above 30 make a run at the Gold. If that's 12, that would be:  F LeBron James  F Draymond Green  F Jimmy Butler  F Gordon Hayward (he'll be 30 in a few days)  F Kevin Durant   G Chris Paul  G James Harden  G Russell Westbrook  G Stephen Curry  G Mike Conley  C DeAndre Jordan  F/C Blake Griffin  that'd be cool"
I still can't understand the justification for cutting blake griffin.  Smaller contracts totally make sense to me but a contract this large just cutting your losses rather than holding out for at least SOMETHING is strange.    Is it more about just building some good will with future free agents?  Sign with us and if it doesn't work out we'll treat you well just like we did blake griffin.
starting Blake Griffin or DeAndre Jordan in 2021 is not a good thing
I like the fit with DWade. It’s a fitting passing of the torch from Kenny. The question is who takes Chuck’s spot when/if he retires. I’m thinking someone like Blake Griffin maybe?
Depends what kind of Blake Griffin they are getting. The effort he was putting up in Detroit this year had me asking why he was even in the league still.
PG: Jrue Holiday/Kyle Lowry   SG: FVV/Duncan Robinson/Derrick White   SF: Joe Harris/Kyle Kuzma   PF:  Kevin Love/Blake Griffin   C: DeAndre Jordan/Andre Drummond/JaVale McGree  Is this the worst possible team you could assemble out of that finalists?     Edit. I am not sure about Point Guards
Guess that means Blake Griffin is terrified of the constitution.  He put up 50 against us a few years ago
the Joe Harris disrespect is out of this world.. Joe Harris is definitely starting over Blake Griffin.
"On a sort of related but mostly unrelated note, the most trending player right now is Meyers Leonard above guys like LeBron, with Blake Griffin being second.  I know obviously with what is going on he would be up there, but I didn’t expect him to be #1."
just lob it to blake griffin every play
"You’re just going by PER then? So we can agree that Robert Williams III is a top 10 player? Thanasis Antetokounmpo has a higher PER than Blake Griffin this year, so we can agree that he’s the superior player right? Blindly comparing PER doesn’t mean a thing, it’s an incredibly situational stat.   To answer your questions...  1) Very questionable going forward. 2) The gap between the two on offense is pretty minor; the gap between the two on defense is **astronomical.** It’s also much harder to be one of the best defenders in the league and still produce the offense Jrue does - offense only players like Kemba are much more common and historically don’t end up as the last ones standing.  3) No, it doesn’t. Jrue is better in that role.  I’d argue you’re also forgetting about the major thing - Jrue has proven that he steps up to an elite level in the postseason. Kemba shrunk under the pressure. Playoff performance is what really matters for teams like Boston and Milwaukee, and it’s a huge difference in their resumes that you’re trying to conveniently ignore with your 3 questions."
Quincy Acy could shoot it dude.  Probably was better than Blake Griffin today.
Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan being there is such bullshit. Ja is probably the biggest snub
Where luka and Blake griffin talked? Or actually luka spoke Spanish and griffin was like “hola y gracias”
Oh I agree. But players like Blake Griffin/Jordan are on it even though they’re is below average. Plus I think Hunter &gt; Gordon/Wall/Plumlee
Blake Griffin??????  Lol.
I’m sorry but Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan don’t deserve to be there
"They added Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan to this list in 2021, on purpose. Like they actually discussed it and decided that those two players could be Olympic caliber players."
"Kendrick Perkins on getting dunked on by Blake Griffin. You know the one.  &gt;If I was in the same position, in the same rotation, I’m going to jump again and again and again. I don’t care. A lot of people are afraid of humiliation or don’t know how to handle embarrassment or would even get embarrassed. I don’t care.  &gt;I’m the same Perk you’re going to see. I’m still going to sign autographs the same way. I ain’t going to change. The people that move out the way and stuff are the people who have insecurity problems.  &gt;That’s my job. How will my teammates look at me if next time I just back out the way and just let him dunk when I’m supposed to be defensive-minded, a shot-blocker? That would be a coward move on me. He’d just have to dunk on me again."
"Jazz are really really good and no one cares, Lebron is old and very good, Embiid and Jokic are historically dominant, Blake Griffin sad and bad, LaMelo is going to be an all-star for a decade but not allowed to be melo, Trae Young is a pansy, Knicks are an NBA team now, west good east sucks, Westbrook still loses games but everyone likes him now, Nets are the Monstars and KD is still KD, Chef Curry is fucking the sky, Lillard is shooting 42% from the opposite free throw line, Oubre is sexy and can’t shoot, Zion is an all-star, Kyrie is asshole why Lebron hate?"
Those too. He got posterised by everyone in the league lol. Blake Griffin particularly had ownership on him
"Yes and no. He's averaging double for his previous career high in PPG, which is pretty impressive even if he's kind of inefficient. Also, washed former all star Blake Griffin averaging like 10 ppg less with worse efficiency on the same team makes it kind of more impressive, right?? Idk man"
NGL I would fucking LAUGH if deandre jordan AND blake griffin get a ring and chris paul doesn't.
Blake Griffin was never really seen as the second coming of lebron Or a white harden  Everyone knew gruff was just a good player who got made better from Chris Paul
"I haven’t watched any spurs this year so you tell me, is LeMarcus done to the level he’s one step from being Blake Griffin, or does his play style just not fit how you guys want to run things but he could still be a starter for a decent team?"
*r/nba : Blake is washed and he doesn’t add anything to the Nets.*  *also r/nba : Does KD want everybody !? What happened to competition. How dare he get Dunk Contest Champion Blake Griffin on his team. So unfair!!*  Y’all some clowns fr
Blake Griffin does nothing to change that.  It stopped being a “duos” league the minute Nets got Harden.
Is anybody rating Blake Griffin right now?  Like at all
"I'm wondering how Zion will perform when defenses will adjust to his game and force him to create a jump shot.  Weirdly I can imagine him more into building a 3pt shot rather than any sort of mid-range.  Before him Lebron then Giannis were forced to do this and Giannis still today, after 2 MVP seasons, can be put into serious trouble if you can pack the paint.   Simmons is a whole different offensive player in playoffs because of his lack of shooting.  For similar reasons plus the injuries also Blake Griffin was forced to build a solid mid-range and then also an outside shoot."
"I'll raise you a Blake Griffin, and patiently await your synopsis on how he was most, or more pivotal for a teams success. Other than slam dunk hard. I think we can come up with more candidates"
Lol I don’t think this argument holds weight only because there is basically no one like Zion athletically. He’s like a mixture of young LeBron and young Blake Griffin. Not necessarily a template for other players
Da fuq is he gonna do there? Play 3rd stringer to Blake Griffin?
Zion is like prime Blake griffin with way more size and speed. His ball handling is actually great and he has great passing vision.
We never rushed him. He's a snake who complained about his chronic pain. He was never honest to our teams medical staff and disrespected everyone who cared about him. All he had to do was talk to us. Instead he refuses to say a word and hides behind his uncle like he some boy.  Also our team isn't stupid enough to draft Darko Milicic with the 2nd pick in 2003s NBA Draft. Dont let me get started on your team mate. Im from Saginaw and despite our team isn't the best now. We didn't stop cheering for them while your team was the most empty for quite a few years once your team started playing like crap. But that's what you get when Joe Dumars is your GM. At least he isn't anymore.  Also how the fuck did you mess up with Blake Griffin? Ouch.
"If Blake Griffin signed with literally any other team yall wouldn't be acting like the Nets just signed Prime Micheal Jordan   Its 2021 Blake Griffin, please keep your emotions in check"
"I remember when LaMarcus Aldridge, Kevin Love and Blake Griffin were the best power forwards of the game."
"Lol it wasn’t Blake it was Harden, Idrc about Blake griffin to the nets.   The “issue” isn’t that KD wants to be on stacked teams, I was making a point more so as to how sensitive he is about that perception. He does it and simulataneously feels attacked when anyone mentions it: hence the burner, numerous times arguing with fans over insta about it, his comment on sharpe’s insta. If you’re going to do it and not take the Dame/Giannis/Beal route at least be confident about it"
"[Blake Griffin will not make his debut for Brooklyn against the Celtics on Thursday. He is out for left knee injury maintenance, the team says.](https://twitter.com/malika_andrews/status/1369802261350735878?s=21)"
Lakers fans are trash man. They’re salivating over a possible Blake griffin injury too
"His rotations are sus but i think a lot of them are out of his control. Like how he starts Wayne Ellington / Blake Griffin - clearly being instructed to do so in order to facilitate a trade.   He’s also improved his in game adjustments, often times we would randomly switch everything or go into a zone and confuse the opposition &amp; get a comeback.   I feel like he gets unnecessary stick from you guys. Like, he met prime Lebron every single time in the playoffs - you werent beating him. Maybe you wouldn’t get swept with Nurse instead of Casey, but you still would’ve lost. Casey still developed your core, Nurse just had Kawhi added to it  I don’t want him at the helm when we’re back competing for a chip, but for now he’s great at development."
“Is there locker room issues with the Blake Griffin signing already??”
"So Blake Griffin now makes the Nets Stacked? Lol. Y'all were calling him washed a few days ago, the double standard is unreal.. You think Lebron didn't help in recruiting 2 6MOY and a DPOY to his team? but when KD gets washed Blake to his team its getting 'too' stacked."
"Blake Griffin was part of KD and the Nets players workouts in LA this last offseason.  Sure KD got to see what Griffin could and could not do anymore, but still thought it was worth playing together in Brooklyn."
AHHHHHHHHH. YES YES YES.     So happy we missed out on the Blake Griffin sweepstakes now.
"No. He isn’t washed. He’s just not the player he used to be. I’d rather have LMA than Blake Griffin, TBH."
6 years ago damn. He was arguably the best PF in the league at the time (AD and Blake Griffin too)
"Blake Griffin: Will I get playing time over there?   Deandre Jordan: Look at me. I'm getting 23 mpg. Have you seen my knees lately?   Blake Griffin: Say no more   Deandre Jordan: Seriously look at my knees, something's wrong. I need some medical advice   Blake Griffin: Shut up before I change my mind"
"Lonzo is clearly an extraterrestrial who escaped Area 51 to crash land on earth and steal the rookie scoring title.  Now, to be fair, Young has taken a couple bad shots that have missed the rim. But for the most part he's been virtually unstoppable this season, and has the third highest field goal percentage in the country at 48.5% behind only Jalen Brunson and Trae. They also haven't won a game since they lost Chris Paul and made Blake Griffin the sacrificial lamb."
What's immature? I know for a fact that you haven't watched Blake Griffin play in any significant way in the past 2 years.  Tell me. Why are you watching Pistons games?
"Blake Griffin hasn't dunked since December 2019, the inverse is far more likely"
"&gt; Ainge isn't doing much to get Boston over the ECF hump  Most of the time there's just not much you can do. You can't predict Kawhi and Ibaka going to the Raptors, or Kyrie, Durant and Harden on the Nets. You can't predict Morey on the Sixers and sometimes free agents you want just don't pan out. I'm sure we were going for Randle, for example, but you can't bet New York's offer if you're, well, any team in the league.   C's are always gonna be up there in talent, like a perennial playoff team, but it takes a lot of luck your way to get to be a contender.   And honestly, for all the flack Danny gets, he didn't trade Tatum and Brown away for Kawhi, Paul George, Harden, AD, Westbrook, Blake Griffin. Guys who would have fallen off or left after a year."
"Look, in general I agree, but let's not pretend the NBA is like any normal corporate environment.  Blake Griffin broke his hand punching a coworker at a public dinner because he was drunk and took offense to a joke the guy made.  In any other industry he would have been fired instantly. Not so in pro sports. If Lebron/Kawhi/Harden/KD used an anti-semetic slur do you think the team would ditch them? 0%."
Just ask Blake Griffin
So more like if Aaron Gordon played the role that the Nets are hoping Blake Griffin can play.
"If Blake griffin starts blowing by people with ease and dunking again when he hasn’t since 2019, I promise you the investigation will be started before half time."
Blake griffin.   He's been capable of running the offense and has become a much better passer
no one talking about how blake finally got his guy jeff green  [https://www.radio.com/971theticket/articles/blake-griffin-says-he-whiffed-free-agent-recruiter-pistons-i-was-0-3-year](https://www.radio.com/971theticket/articles/blake-griffin-says-he-whiffed-free-agent-recruiter-pistons-i-was-0-3-year)
Honestly thought the Nets would've made a move for Drummond. Could've swore I heard the Cavs were planning to do a buy out and that's how the Nets were planning to acquire him but I guess not. Prior to picking up Blake Griffin it would've made sense for them to go for him as they needed another big man.
"Knicks Sixers or the Nets if you wanna stay close to home. All 3 teams right now are playoff contenders. Knicks are young and still developing, but watching the young guys is exciting. Sixers are tough, competitive and Embiid and Simmons are an allstar duo. The Nets are in the conversation for the title, anchored by 3 superstars in Durant, Harden and Kyrie (with a recently added Blake Griffin).   I am biased towards the Knicks. They were really bad for a while, but the future is bright. Plus, if the Knicks ever win another Chip, New York would explode. We went above .500 the other day and there was a mini block party outside MSG. Imagine the party if they win it all."
Throw prime Blake Griffin in there and the lobs would be insane. Some sort of... city of lobs.
I thought you were being sarcastic until I got to the end. Lmao at Blake fucking Griffin joining the Nets being “unfair” to LeBron.
Im not sure how Blake Griffin would stop them with dunking
"players ""improve"" when they get more shots and a chance to handle the ball enough to get better. when you're on lebron's team, you have a great chance to win a title, but you aren't given much leash in the sense that if you don't play well, you won't get minutes. lebron's teams don't have the time or priority to develop young guys. kyle kuzma is an okay player, but i think he would definitely see the ""stats boost"" that those other young guys saw if he went to a shitty team like DLO, Lonzo, Randle, or Ingram. this is why people will be shocked to see blake griffin average 7 ppg and 3 rpg on the nets"
"No but seriously, glad they are giving Blake Griffin his damn respect"
"Bro you dont even need Middelton, Jrue and Murray, Jokic and Giannis with 3 half decent spot up shooters would destroy the Nets. Who could guard them? Deandre Jordan? A washed Blake Griffin?"
"clarkson but she has denied that. blake griffin, ben simmons next."
"Why is KD so high? Dude isn't a fringe top 10 player, he hasn't done shit except build super teams and now he has 6x All Star Blake Griffin on his team with superstar Kyrie and Harden, if he wins this year its just gonna be unfair to Lebron. KD hasn't done shit except join GSW where he wasn't even the best player, you just can't justify having him over someone like Dirk, Malone, Barkley, Garnett, Dr j. KD is like 26 in my rankings, I can give you my full list if you like."
Its not because of Blake griffin
"&gt;BG  Stop adding Big name players that are way past their prime to beef up your point. That's all I have to say. KD/ Kyrie/ Harden are still just as good as the other contending teams in the league, its not like adding Blake Griffin suddenly tipped the scale lol. Lots of people still had the Lakers winning even after Harden joined as they are an all offense team but now that Griffin is there its suddenly over?"
Why was the narrative of blake griffin being good suddenly reemerged this weekend when he was bought out? Dude was dogwater all season for the pistons
"Nets didn't draft any of KD, Kyrie, Harden, DJ, Lamarcus, Blake Griffin or even have any of them on their team long term. Same thing to a slightly lesser extent with the Lakers and Clippers.  Weird and wrong direction that the NBA is headed in imo"
"If the Lakers lose its to be expected, if they win it's the underdog story of the ages. All because of Blake Griffin and lamar Aldriges corpses"
For real. Imagine having Blake Griffin and LMA as your BENCH bigs.
"But also imagine telling them that in 5 years Blake Griffin will be basically a 6th man who was so overpaid he couldn’t get traded and  who can barely move, Kevin Durant plays 20 games over the course of 2 years because of injuries and Lamarcus Aldridge still won’t shoot 3s."
"They act like the championship is a foregone conclusion because they signed the ghosts of Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge lol. It’s like a weird form of posturing where if the Nets win the title they’ll act like it was inevitable and therefore not impressive, but then if the nets lose (to a really good sixers team or whatever really good west team makes it to the finals) they’ll act like it’s a monumental collapse."
“Uhhh but they have no bigs”  *Signs Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge*
"People act like LMA is this crazy add, he’s a starting caliber player. Jeff Green is probably better, and maybe Blake Griffin.  Now, all of the Nets players in their prime? 😳"
"In the past 3 seasons the nba franchises in Los Angeles and New York have gotten Lebron, AD, Kawhi, Paul George, KD, Kyrie, Harden, Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge. And likely Andre Drummond. This isn't healthy for the league."
Sorry which of those players are you taking out for 2021 Blake Griffin ~~or 2021 LaMarcus Aldridge~~ ?
"What superstar free agents signed with the Nets? 35 year old LaMarcus Aldridge? Blake Griffin with no knees? Brooklyn was such a joke two-three years ago that even Knicks fans were like ""lol nobody cares about the nets"". Name one superstar free agent besides Kyrie Irving that signed with either Brooklyn or New Jersey.  I'll wait."
AD on da way again!!! Now we have enough to vanquish the blake griffin/ lamarcus aldridge nets!
"Exactly. Brooklyn is tough because they have KD, Kyrie, and Harden. *Current* star players.  LMA and Blake Griffin aren't shifting the balance of power lol. This shit happens every time a washed-up, former All-Star joins a contender.  Claxton, Brown, and Green are legitimately better players at this point than those two."
Contracts are guaranteed so teams are paying the players already. It's a sunk cost that doesn't factor into the decision about whether the team is better off with the player on the roster or not. And teams can lower the amount yet to be paid. The Pistons saved over ten million dollars by agreeing to release Blake Griffin. And denying established players a chance to go to a contender when their team obviously doesn't need them any more might make free agents more reluctant to sign with the team.
"I 100% agree.  If the Knicks changed ownership and managed the equivalent of Chris Paul and Blake Griffin, people would be lining up to go back there in no time. Whereas teams like the Jazz and the Pacers have had at least Nets-equivalent cores for decades, and they've never sniffed a top-10 free agent. I don't want to hate on the Nets, because they did put together a nice little team to attract Kyrie/Durant, but, lets be honest, there are a dozen franchises who could have matched that core."
"From the data Brooklyn has the best offence of all time and now their defence has improved. Claxton is ending games, he and Durant will be nightmares together. They’ve added Blake Griffin and LMA. Their depth is better than any other team."
You're still here? Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and James Harden and Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge want to play for the Brooklyn Nets. That is all I'm going to respond to you from here on out. Continue to bash your head against Brooklyn brownstone if you'd like.
"Jeez. Relax. A week go, everyone was calling Blake Griffin and LA washed.  Now they are all stars again."
"If they get Drummond then their bench rotation will be some shit like Andre Drummond, Lamarcus Aldridge, Deandre Jordan, Claxton and Blake Griffin. They would destroy most bench units even if they're washed up lmao."
Making an argument that AD is a top 4 player in the league is a lot more credible than making an argument that Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge shift the title favorite odds lol
"This comes after blake griffin got out of detroit after comment sof ""hasn't dunked since 2019"". Then went on to the nets where he showed he dunked with ease. Buy out player getting paid max by former team to ring chase yet bailing on his own team."
And I still don't care. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and James Harden and Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge are playing for the team based in my hometown.
Still better than current LMA and Blake Griffin.
Probably bucks/sixers bc their biggest issue is interior defense. Hard to build a wall with blake griffin and lma. But i still doubt any team's ability to outscore the nets over a 7 game series
"Harden, Kyrie Irving, kevin durant, Blake griffin, deandre Jordan, Lamarcus Aldridge, Jeff Green, Claxston, shamet, Bruce brown, Joe Harris, spencer dinwiddie. They have enough talent to create 2 playoff caliber starting lineups. Seems fair /s"
The only weird buyout as blake griffin. Who to my knowledge had two years left on his deal
"Yea, sure, I’m the casual for thinking that prime kyrie and harden, along with joe Harris, Blake griffin, and lamarcus Aldridge have a 0% chance of winning a title. Yup, very dumb of me to think that the team running through the league right now has any chance win the title.   You’re a fool, harden and kyrie make the nets simply unstoppable on the offensive end. They can beat any team on any given night because of that. I’m not even saying they’re favorites, but the way they’re playing right now shows they would have a good shot without KD."
"Bro there is a difference between getting JR Smith Markieff Morris Dion Waiters in buyout and adding Blake Griffin LMA. Idc if blake and aldridge are washed, they are not as washed as lakers buyout trio. Nets buyout adventure is at least twice more disgusting."
Yup. Would rather have him than Aldridge and Blake Griffin tbh...
"Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge want to play ball with Brooklyn on their chest. I'm so proud of my hometown, and the work that Sean Marks has done."
"Blake Griffin didn't dunk for a whole year with the pistons, the second he got traded he out here catching lobs and shit. I feel LMA will definitely play a lot better when he has KD, Harden and Kyrie opening up the floor."
"I think what makes it even worse is that they are literally the only superteam in the league. We had a great year of duos and now they added James harden, Blake griffin, and a future LMA. Like them winning a ring now isn’t even going to be impressive anymore."
now everyone's acting like Blake Griffin and LMA are all-stars.   this fake outrage is hilarious.
"It took one dunk for everyone to whiplash on Blake Griffin, now he’s a star again"
"Yeah I agree, it definitely doesn't hurt. My main point is that this isn't really a blockbuster move, neither was the Griffin signing. It's just that they're big names.   I'd even say that rather than having both LMA and Blake it'd be better to have one and Otto Porter Jr (if he's bought out). That's just not as sexy of a headline because OPJ has never been a star."
"And Lamarcus Aldridge and Blake griffin were even worse than Ray Allen was in 2013 lol. And Bosh was not terrible lol, Lebron stans always shitting on lebrons teammates."
"&gt;Oh I didn’t realise you were being so pedantic  I used a whopping two numbers.  If that was beyond your capacity to grasp, that's your issue.  &gt;Just take the L man  That's not the way it works.  You have to say something correct first.  &gt;Blake Griffin going to the Nets did not “turn the clock back 5 years”  Griffin wrecked his knee for the first time twelve years ago, and has missed substantial games in: 2010, 2012, 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2020.  Griffin hasn't been much of a high-flyer for years.  Whoever put together this ""official"" [2016-17 Griffin highlight reel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nukpxh-zw0g&amp;ab_channel=theAIRJORDANblitz) could only find one or maybe two such dunks from an entire season.  So yeah, he does.  And for the record, I said ""maybe not 5 years"" but you apparently didn't understand that, either."
"4 years ago, Aldrich, Griffin, and Deandre Jordan would've made the team stacked. Now though, they're just bodies on the bench to provide depth. Either way, Blake and LMA are soft for this."
"Blake was an underrated passer and ball handler. Even with all that, I still say Zion is more gifted. I already saw players like Griffin, Amare Stoudemire was just as explosive with better hands, but didn't have the passing or ball skills of Griffin. Zion at times moves like a guard out there and his physique is just different from all those guys. The only similarities are Larry Johnson and Anthony Mason. Both those guys were not as quick, agile or as explosive as Zion."
"He's averaging 14 and 4 this season on nearly 26 minutes. He's going to get shredded by any gaurd while Claxton can take on any gaurd in the league and clamp him. This isn't a Blake Griffin scenario where he wasn't trying because the team was really bad, the spurs are a playoff team and Aldridge looked washed while playing significant minutes."
"This Nets team is beyond ridiculous, if they don't win the title this year, it would easily be the biggest embarrassment in league history imo.  The other ones that come to mind are 2011 Heat, 2015 Clips, 2016 Thunder, 2016 Warriors, 2020 Clippers, etc.   But this is just insanely ridiculous. Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, TLC, Shamet, Tyler Johnson, Claxton, etc   I cannot even envision this team losing the title this year, so I would be shocked."
"Griffin and LMA in smaller roles means they can afford to go all out in their limited minutes (not that Blake will be jumping over people or anything, but), they don’t have to be relied on anymore."
"When Blake griffin, joe Harris, and LMA get played off the floor in the playoffs we’ll revisit"
Why are people pretending that Blake Griffin being able to jump over a phonebook again is prime Blake Griffin?
"Don’t include LMA and Griffin if you’re not including Joe Harris. Joe Harris &gt;&gt; LMA , Blake"
How good do you think LMA and Blake Griffin are? 2017 Warriors still hold the Most Stacked team title.
I said the same thing about Blake Griffin but they’re all going to put the foot on the gas for the easy eing
Because typically as you get further down a team’s depth chart there are less and less players who have been all stars in the last 3 years  This is not the case with Brooklyn lol  They’re so clearly already above the rest of the East without KD even playing and they’ve got Lamarcus Aldridge and Blake Griffin chillin on the bench playing spot minutes  Come on bruh
"When you’re the 7th option on a team with Durant, Harden, Kyrie, Blake Griffin, and even Joe Harris you’re gonna be in a much easier place than the first option on a rebuilding roster lol"
"Imagine if 5 years ago someone told you Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge would team up to play on the freakin Nets"
"Honestly they don’t deserve it. This has gotta be the fastest a team has ever stacked a team in NBA history right? From having nobody to having Kyrie, KD, Harden, Blake Griffin, and Aldridge all in like 15 months? Wtf lol"
When was the last time they got a buyout as good as Lamarcus Aldridge or Blake Griffin? What did they even get last year? Markieff Morris? lmao
"Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, TLC, Shamet, Tyler Johnson, Claxton, etc  This is a finals lock, it would be an absolute embarrassment if they do not win the title this year."
I ashamed for all the lakers fans who are worried about nets adding blake griffin/aldridge...
"Imagine being told 5 years ago that Kyrie, Harden, KD, Blake Griffin, Aldridge, and Deandre Jordan would all be on one team and it wouldn't be team USA or an all star team"
"Oh I didn’t realise you were being so pedantic  Just take the L man  Blake Griffin going to the Nets did not “turn the clock back 5 years”  He’s just playing on a better team in a much easier role next to James Harden, pretty simple  If you think he looks like pre injury Blake Griffin idk what to tell you"
"and gobert has 149  How many zion dunks end up on the front page? Been like 2 all year  He isn't pulling a prime blake griffin, so ESPN and such got bored."
"You're overstating things significantly. Zion either learns how to shoot threes, or he's Blake Griffin until his body breaks down. And his body will break down. He's already overweight and injury prone, and someone with his body type is going to pick up injuries left and right, especially with the way he plays."
"Ideally you would want to hold down the paint first and foremost. Next, I would play hard defense on James harden like the lakers did last year and run the three pointers off the line. I’ll live with James Harden floaters all day knowing that Lebron or Ad can easily get a bucket inside to match that. I would relentlessly attack KD, and Kyrie in isolation on offense. Kyrie/KD can’t contain bron I’m not even sure they can contain Schroeder. Kyrie/KD would be gassed trying to hold it down on both ends.   Later on In the game, Jeff Green/Blake griffin is another weak link on offense to abuse. If it got into a point into the game where harden or Kyrie are getting to the rim at will I would be more than comfortable letting Jeff fucking green being the one that beats us.   I think it ultimately comes down to limiting the three’s and staying out of foul trouble. You need to attack them at their weaknesses defensively and limit three point opportunities."
Blake Griffin made a couple big threes this quarter
"You can't play like shit, then complain your way out of town to a situation you want.  That's just not how sports work.  AD and Jrue got to where they wanted because they are all stars.    Ok, he misses his family, completely understandable.  So does over half the league because of the Covid rules.    It's not the teams fault no northeast teams were jumping in for a $13m below average player.  If the Pistons could have traded Blake Griffin, they would have.  If the Cavs could have traded Andre Drummond, they would have"
"Since 2011, the Jazz, Nuggets, and Blazers draft picks have combined for 13 all star appearances (Lillard 6, Jokic 3, Gobert 2, Mitchell 2). These 3 teams are considered by most to be in the range of ""fringe contenders"" to ""playoff lock but nothing more"". Notable acquisitions via free agency in recent years (please let me know if I missed any notables. This was weirdly difficult to dig up.) :  * Evan Turner * Derrick Jones Jr. * Carmelo Anthony * Paul Millsap * Bojan Bogdanovic    Since 2011, the Lakers, Clippers, and Nets draft picks have combined for 3 all star appearances (D'Lo '19, Ingram '20, Randle '21), yet all 3 teams are championship contenders. Notable acquisitions via free agency in recent years:  * LeBron * Kawhi * KD * Kyrie * Blake Griffin * LaMarcus Aldridge * Serge Ibaka"
I felt the same way about Blake Griffin
"Wall's problem is he hasn't even slightly changed how he plays the game despite a loss in athleticism, which hopefully isn't still true come next season. If he develops his jump shot in the second half of his career the way Blake Griffin and others have done then he can still be a productive guard, especially if he is able to be close to an elite defender again."
"They also added Hitler to the roster and Blake ""I punch my staff members in the face"" Griffin. Really a modern twitter dream team."
"Tom Tolbert - he's pure entertainment.  Blake Griffin - he's hilarious. https://streamable.com/mdq7m  Jeremy Lin - also a funny guy, and bring some cultural perspectives."
"The Clippers gave that contract to Blake Griffin, not the Pistons.   As for the Wood thing, it's basically a wash after bringing in Grant, who has excelled with Detroit.    The Josh Smith &amp; Ben Gordon contracts were far more egregious."
the pistons giving blake griffin a contract does not rank on the worst decisions they've made in the last decade
"I definately remember that yeah, especially the Thabeet talk. But Rubio's contract situation was a major concern, it was really scaring off a lot of teams. Even then Harden was known for his ballhandling skill and playmaking ability, I'm sure they didn't just envision him as a pure scoring 2 guard. He was the best guard in college basketball, and the most sure thing guy in the draft behind Blake Griffin. They might have taken Thabeet if he fell to them, but other than that Harden was pretty much a no brainer."
"People are acting like here it's clear cut and acting old like Griffin played in the 90s  Blake was a great player, but superstar is a very debatable thing because people have different definitions  Imo he was never a superstar, he was never the best and most important player on the team either, never first all NBA Team either  but he was super popular and flashy   He was just on the cusp, he was improving his game, he added a jumper and his passing was getting better and better but his knees got fucked, no injuries no nothing he becomes a sure fire superstar for sure"
Literally they paraded around saying Blake Griffin Chris Paul and Deandre Jordan could win a championship
"But you can't judge a player based off of when he's past his prime or at the end of his prime. That's what you're doing.  That's like saying Blake Griffin can't dunk, I just started watching basketball in 2019. Nobody would take you serious if you said that."
"Man fat Klove was as good a rebounder as Drummond and probably Dwight. He averaged 15 rebounds a game one season in addition to being able to operate on the perimeter, unlike any of those other guys. If klove didn't have a shot and an ability to play on the perimeter you would have seen a lot more seasons of around 15 boards.   Love wasn't just relying on hope for his rebounds. He had an amazing ability to track the ball and to know where to position himself to grab boards.  Also, KLove recorded a higher vertical at the combine than Blake Griffin despite being ""fat"""
Especially the Blake Griffin Clippers. Makes no sense
"I respect Dame for his approach to his career  I also respect others for their approach to their careers, excluding Latrell Spreewell, as i have no issue with a person doing what is in their own best interest personally or from a career standpoint  For every Dame, there is a Lue Wiliams, Lamar Odom, Blake Griffin, Norman Powell, Isaiah Thomas, Andrew Wiggins, D'Angelo Russell, even Andre Drummond was bench to avoid hurting his value, and so on.   Loyalty is great but for most guys it's definitely a one-way street. Once Dame's game slows down the real question will be if he ends up the trading block for his replacement.   If a player wants to put themselves in the best position to achieve a dream they've been chasing since they were kids, I'm all for it."
Joe Harris is likable and Blake Griffin is half likable
Kuzma Ben Simmons Blake Griffin Jordan Clarkson
blake griffin or delonte west
"They want stars in major markets. This entire league is run by nothing but greedy money-grubbing douchelords who would really rather just see New York vs LA every night if the ratings were high and the precious international market dgaf about the middle of the country  Notice how nobody was trying to push anyone towards Cleveland when we were the champs, it was all about where they should put LeBron next. They couldn’t get KD and Harden out of Oklahoma and into Houston or San Fran fast enough, and basically told Blake Griffin to shut it down so they could put him in NYC. Who was the last superstar Free Agent to sign in San Antonio? They were a DYNASTY and every single star they had from David Robinson to Kawhi Leonard was drafted. How about Dallas? OKC? For a team like Denver, Utah, Minnesota, Milwaukee, Portland, etc to be successful they either to hit in the draft or just get really lucky with putting together the right mix of guys nobody else wanted...and hit in the draft. Look at the last champions who did it through FA, LA, Miami, Boston, San Fran in the KD years (Cleveland runs riot without him there), LA again in the Shaq and Kobe era not to mention guys like Dwight Howard, and Ron “Meta World Peace” Artest. I guarantee if they took away profit sharing, we would find out some real shady shit from the smaller market guys. Keep owners paid, and they are happy. The draft lottery is rigged as hush money as well. Bet"
"&gt; It's very clearly a flaw in the system that allows the rich to get richer at no cost.      I mean, technically by your logic the rich aren't getting richer because they are signing for the vet minimum.      You can create a new system all you want, teams will find out a way to get around it. In these instances, the teams are not being forced to keep the player for the remainder of the season, it makes them look better because players will see that the team takes their situations into consideration. And it's not like it's Nikola Vucevic forcing the Magic to buy him out and then him trotting over to LA or Brooklyn. These are over the hill vets who want a shot at the championship. Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge are the 4th or 5th option **at best** respectively as a scoring option on the floor with Durant/Harden/Irving. Then you need to take into account, arguably, the best 3 pt shooter in the league in Joe Harris, if he's on the floor, those guys are below him IMO.      Just admit you're upset because it's not *your* team like the memes above."
Adding current LMA and Blake Griffin is far from stacked.
"The Big 3 on the Nets will win or lose whatever playoff series the Nets play in. Blake Griffin and LMA are fantastic veteran pieces, but acting like they will be taking over games is a little silly. There are better players in front of them that the Nets already had (BB, Clax) so I don't think you can say we won't learn anything about the Big 3. It's Kyrie, Harden and KD's team.  I guess you could also make the argument that if the Laker's win this year it shouldn't mean anything because they added more talent to a team that barely faced opposition in last year's playoffs. Winning a Finals will always mean winning a Finals."
"Guys, Blake Griffin probably never did a no-look pass on the Pistons. Someone tell Adam Silver."
"I don't know about you guys but to me they need to win something before they can be labeled as villains. This isn't the warriors team who were already champions adding KD. Adding Blake griffin and Aldridge didn't make them any better, there's a reason every other team passed on them in waivers. They probably wont even play when it comes to the condensed playoff rosters and lineups. Stay healthy. Win something. Then lets talk villains."
"Game 7, final possession, full court, 23 seconds left in a tie, Schroeder has picked up Kyrie to at least pester his dribbling, runs into a man he think must be Blake Griffin setting a screen, but it’s actually Drummond going “I GOT THIS!”"
There are 3 important numbers to know:  109 mil: “cap”  133 mil: “luxury tax line”  139 mil: “tax Apron” aka the Hard Cap.  You have the option to go as far ahead of luxury tax as you want and penalties go up- but for the most part you can only resign your own players (this is basically Something called Bird Rights). If you use an exemption to get another player (free agent and not trade for his bird rights) then you get restricted to the the Hard Cap aka the Tax Apron line (the Celtics used the MLE to get Tristan Thompson this year and so they are hard capped). Though if you are above the luxury tax line you can still sign veteran minimum players (Nets and Blake griffin for example). The league set it up for you to basically keep your players and if you go over (so the Warriors are about 40 mill above the tax line and are paying like 80 mill in “taxes” and so that you extra money goes towards the teams below the “luxury tax line” as a reward. Nets and Warriors and all the other expensive big baller teams are funding the rest of the financially responsible teams.   If you are in luxury tax the deeper you go you pay more per dollar over the limit and if you are in luxury tax for 3 out of the past 4 years the. You get put into the repeater tax category and all the luxury tax fines increase and you lose some exemptions
Your still not answering my question about the Nets and Clippers and when I think about it the Magic to.  U literally named role players lol. Like honestly every team signs solid role players. What are u doing this isn’t a argument. Then u brought up players that weren’t even free agents and was drafted to the lakers. Then u had the audacity to say Karl Malone and Gary Payton. These guys were ring chasers like Blake griffin and Aldridge.   The only legitimate argument is Shaq. I feel like your trolling me now. U don’t expect teams sign decent free agents? Not even star players that will change the league just decent role players. Oh I get it’s only a problem if the Lakers get role players 😅
"&gt; I mean, I'm not a collosal fucking moron   That statement is not consistent with your posts and general behavior.  &gt; so I'd be hype as hell that we got Blake Griffin off the buyout market for the vet min.  But would you still be crying like a little bitch if you were a fan of another team and the Jazz - with the best record in the league - picked up Blake and LMA for dirt cheap on the buyout market?  Nobody would care because nobody, apparently including you, think the Jazz have any real shot anyway. That’s much more an indictment of your team than anything else, I’m afraid. Have some more self-respect.   &gt;Blake Griffin, even playing like he did in Detroit, is a dozen times more playable than the player you typically get on a vet min deal.   No, he was a net negative on that team. The Pistons would have been better off literally not playing him at all. Your scrub who averages 2 mpg or whatever isn’t actively hurting your team because he doesn’t have the opportunity to. This is what you consistently fail to understand, and what Pistons fans have to drill into your thick skull (and of course you ignore them).  &gt; Blake is the 38th lowest paid player in the entire league, meaning that he's paid less than all first round and most second round draft picks from last year.  Yeah, and he isn’t worth much more than that at all.   &gt; A vet min guy averaging 9/3 isn't bad, that's a fucking ridiculous success.  No, that’s ridiculous hyperbole. He can barely stay on the floor even when we want to give him more PT because he’s a foul machine. He’s going to be absolutely abused in the playoffs if we let it. Especially after KD comes back he’s not going to be on the floor for longer than 10 or so minutes, especially in the playoffs. He may even sit out some of those games entirely.   &gt; Signing Blake and LMA, both of them at least as good or better than most team's backup bigs, for a combined salary less than the 27th draft pick gets in his rookie year covers up their biggest weakness and pushes them from ""Super team but..."" to just ""Super team"".  See, that’s the hilarious part. You think signing the corpses of LMA and Blake really moves the needle that much. The single biggest criticism facing the Nets all season long is how they’re going to do *defensively* in the playoffs. Having two big bodies there helps give very slight rest to the guys who are actually good. That’s all they are there for.   The incessant mantra early in the season was that no team has ever won a title without a top 10 defense. Remember that? You were probably spamming it yourself like everyone else here. According to you, the guy who is definitely “not a colossal moron,” LMA and Blake change this completely. Now the Nets are not a defensive sieve, no, not a “super team but... (no defense?)”, they’re a genuine super team! All weaknesses fixed and holes shored."
"Kd, Lamarcus aldridge, blake griffin, nicholas claxton, bruce brown, Jeff green. I think our front office is smart enough to know we can beat the best bigs 1:1 on defense. But with enough front court depth, we can replenish stamina in shorter minutes and keep em on their toes."
"Blake Griffin literally said KD recruited him lmao. R u serious rn, or do you not even know your own team?"
"Blake Griffin is still trash though... His loss of talent is overshadowed by star players around him, something he couldn't do in Detroit.   I don't understand why there is so much talk about how ""unfair"" this is? Both Aldridge and Griffin are past their prime and can only offer so much. They are like the slightly better versions of David West when he signed with the Warriors."
"Yeah, exactly.  Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge as a 1 or 2 option...ehh not very great at this point in their careers.  As bench players, they're awesome, and that's the frustration when they go there for basically nothing."
"I mean, I'm not a collosal fucking moron so I'd be hype as hell that we got Blake Griffin off the buyout market for the vet min.  We are paying a guy named Matt Thomas more than you are paying Blake. Matt Thomas averages 7 minutes and 2 points a game. We also pay more to Illyasova, who has played 3.7 minutes a game and was waived by two teams and traded for a 2nd round pick.  Blake Griffin, even playing like he did in Detroit, is a dozen times more playable than the player you typically get on a vet min deal. Blake is the 38th lowest paid player in the entire league, meaning that he's paid less than all first round and most second round draft picks from last year.  A vet min guy averaging 9/3 isn't bad, that's a fucking ridiculous success. A team that was 50 million dollars over the cap managed to sign two solid role players. Are you actually too dumb to realise how insane and ridiculous that is? I don't think any team ever has had that happen. Like, people laughed in the face of a Lakers content creator who said that they might get Blake in a vet min deal this year. Dwight was considered a ridiculously cheap pickup for a washed up player and he got paid twice what Blake does and signed in free agency with a team that had cap room."
Yeah but why would Blake Griffin or LA play for a non-playoff team when they are already on one and not playing or would rather just sit out games?
Yet you’re sitting here calling Blake Griffin who has played 4 games and averaged 9-4-0 and LMA who is 35 and has yet to play a game ‘unfair’ and a ‘super team’   You see how this completely contradicts  your entire argument here right?
Blake Griffin with highest +/- so unfair
We’re a Blake griffin away from winning it all.
Pass.  His passing game is underrated.  Post up game was underrated as well because he didn't have a gorgeous post up move but somehow always fell in.    Interesting thinking back on how Blake Griffin developed from his rookie season.
"Player | Salary ---|--- Blake Griffin | $1,229,676 Duncan Robinson | $1,663,861 Carmelo Anthony | $2,564,753 Demarcus Cousins| $2,331,593 Devonte Graham | $1,663,861 Paul Milsap | $10,000,000"
"This has been happening in the NBA for a very long time. But it doesn't often translate into championships. Gary paton/karl malone Lakers? People lost their minds.   It's not like your getting some hot young player that will grow into an amazing superstar and will do everything he can to mesh with his new team. Your getting old entitled, mostly washed up stars who are set in their ways and are tagging along to chase a ring.   No question they are upgrades. But they don't take a team from the 7 seed to the 1 seed. They take a 5 seed and make them a 4 seed.   Plus it doesn't often work. Old superstar players don't like to learn new things. They butt heads and are stuck in their ways. Blake Griffin was a terrible locker room presence in LA. He gonna say 1 wrong thing to KD and Durant will be on his burner reddit accounts flaming Blake. Or blake will get mad at kyrie for missing him on a dunk play and he will show Kyrie a globe and how the earth is round then the entire nets team will explode.   Blake Griffin doesn't have a superstar skill set anymore and I don't know that he is worth the trouble I promise you he will cause before he is benched or released.  So before we anoint the new NBA champs let's give mister lob city a chance to disrupt the locker room and destroy the team. My money isn't on the nets."
blake griffin is acting quite defensive. his detractors point out it's more defense than they've seen from him in years.
Ummmm...he would be in the top 0.01% if he does. Zion is gonna be rich mans Blake Griffin.
"The Nets may have KD, Harden, Kyrie, Blake Griffin, and LMA, but only the Timberwolves have the meats."
Someone please post the clip of blake griffin shouting an open three into an airball
"I wasn't targeting you with that comment - figured you'd get that it was just a comparison by bringing up an entirely different player.  My point is that - when people say ""Blake Griffin sucks now"" they don't say shit like ""Blake Griffin sucks for his contract"" they just say ""he sucks.""  Nuance is lost when it comes to social media reaction to players, so Blake is always just hearing how ""Blake lost it"" or ""Blake doesn't have it anymore"" shit like that.  It seems like both sides of this conversation on Reddit are almost purposely missing each other's points."
I don't know how you can watch this game and think blake griffin isn't the worst player on the floor
"Man I think I would rather see a chimera of Karl Malone, Danny Ainge, Derrick Fisher, and Matt Barnes win a ring than see Blake Griffin win one in Brooklyn."
I think young Blake Griffin is the best comparison to Zion. Elite athleticism that lives under the rim. Zion has better touch but Blake is the better passer
Did Blake Griffin Already get Injured??
LMAO Blake Griffin is not better than Bosh
"his offense is terrible because he was getting touches he didnt deserve both in Detroit and even in Cleveland  LeBron/AD and the way the Lakers offense moves is good for at least 6-10 pts off easy double teams/lobs from those two guys.  Drummond should get at least another 6-10 points off misses considering the Lakers do take their fair share of 3 pointers.  That means with no plays ran for him Drummond should be good for 10-12 pts and at least 10 rebounds - while actually being able to run up and down the court unlike Gasol.  People on this subreddit claiming that those hyping Drummond up dont watch the game and only read the box score when in reality they are doing just that.  Drummond's best PG was Reggie Jackson. Let that sink for a second.  His best teammate was Blake Griffin when he had that stretch of good games for half a season on Detroit.  He has played for losing teams, with losing cultures, no quality veteran presence that demanded respect like AD/LeBron  When he was on Detroit, I hated the dude. He definitely has a overvalued sense of self worth but what multi-millionaire 20+ something year old doesnt. But he has talent, he is deceptively fast and has decent handles for a big man. People are gonna be shocked once he gets going with the Lakers"
"We have a waiver system. It just doesn’t work at all.   First of all... almost zero teams are under the cap AND competing.   The closest was the Knicks who have $13M under the cap to claim Blake Griffin.  If they used that on another Power Forward I’m pretty sure you’d cause at least one Knick fan to have an actual aneurism.   But essentially we should have something like triple the vet min OR half the salary, whatever is greater AFTER the player agrees to their buyout. Otherwise they have to wait until next season to get a vet min.  New team pays the new salary (make it an exception to the cap if necessary for hard capped teams, but do not except it from taxes)  Whatever total amount the new team pays, the old team deducts.  So let’s say Blake was signed for 2-years 100M.  He wants out and nobody will trade with that awful deal.  * He gives up $50M * His new team must pay for $25M minimum over two years * New team pays taxes let’s say it’s like $.50 per $1 if they’re in the luxury.  * So in year 1, Pistons get a check from the Nets for $18.75 Million (12.5M of year 1 plus year 1 taxes).  Remaining years should be Player Options.   For guys like Westbrook or Blake Griffin, this makes a ton of sense.  For a guy who’s really not *that* valuable and was on a low contract, just tripling the Vet Min to like $6M plus lux taxes makes it so it’s actually worth it to trade for these guys.  Although, to be honest, I think Luxury Taxes make all of this much more complicated and should be removed altogether.  For the most part Luxury taxes seem to be doing things fans actually hate:  * Breaking up home grown “cores” * Breaking up championship teams that could become historic dynasties   Big stars take discounts in big markets. And the big markets can afford luxury taxes no matter how the roster gets created.   Meanwhile small teams can draft perfectly, but If development takes a little long, you’ll have 3/4 guys all being paid more than their worth and at a certain point you’re forced to gut the team. E.g. OKC and the developing NOP."
wonder if teams will start giving Zion the 2013 Blake Griffin treatment (or can you not do that anymore?). Just play super physical with him and foul every time he goes to the rack.
"Blake griffin couldn’t even start for a tanking team. Well, he could, but they’re tanking for a reason."
Could Blake Griffin still start for a contender?  I wonder if Kyrie/Levert/KD/Griffin/Allen would be good enough to make the Finals.
"Anyone who is upset about the nets doing buy outs look at blake griffin, he's not good. Older stars who are past their prime are fun to have on contenders.   Dwight howard and rondo being on the lakers last year was fun."
Blake Griffin falls down on every play
"Nets were winning it all when they acquired Harden. Only hope anyone else had was that KD or Harden get injured. Now it’s just unfair. I think Blake Griffin is washed and won’t make a difference, but it’s unfair adding Aldridge. As a Laker fan, I am not confident we get out of the stacked West, but even if we do, I don’t think anyone can score with this Nets team. Not fair"
Blake Griffin has been throwing himself all over the place
People don't think Blake Griffin is bad at basketball. They were just saying he's not worth the contract
Pistons fan here: Fuck Blake Griffin
Blake “Aaron Rodgers” Griffin
Blake Griffin didn't force his way out. He just didn't want to use up what little he has left in the tank for a tanking team and the Pistons wanted more playing time for younger players and to get a discount on what's left of Griffin's massive contract. It was a mutually beneficial move. Griffin signing with a superteam doesn't hurt the Pistons at all. Griffin will be retired by the time they become legitimate contenders.   That's not to say that the Pistons might not be better off overall if buyouts were eliminated. But there certainly is some good with the bad.
"Blake was scoring like 40% of his career avg on the same squad Jeremi Grant is putting up career numbers. Blake is washed AF. You are right, this is different from the Melo situation, at least he can still play the game. Griffin is stealing money from teams right now."
"Talking to complete morons will make you a little annoyed. Which is why you are so calm right now, and I am not.  No your point was you thought Howard was a rebounding monster, and still worthless  and then I proved to you he hasn’t been a rebounding monster for a long time, so the whole premise of that statement was wrong. I would quote it back to you, but I am confident in your ability to scroll two comments up.  The point you are making there is entirely different and I have no idea what it has to do with Drummond being a severely underpaid minimum pickup. If everyone thought Howard was bad and he turned out to be good, then how is that an argument for Drummond being bad and worthless if you think they are similar? Are you drunk maybe?  The entire reason why a guy like Drummond and Blake is available isn’t because they aren’t worth paying but because the Cavs and Piston can save a combined  $20 million by cutting them loose, and since they are actively tanking they want to get rid of their good players so they lose more games. So by dumping Drummond and Griffin they both save money and win fewer games. See how that works? Drummond and Griffin had multiple offers from contending teams, they were highly sought after.  I have literally never heard someone understand so little about a basic situation, maybe you should look into a little further before commenting on it."
"That's the question, all right. As a Pistons fan I'm glad they had the option for Blake Griffin but that doesn't mean that they are a good thing overall. I'm not sure what the effects on the league would be from eliminating buyouts."
"I'm sorry but Blake Griffin is a bitch. I have zero allegiance to the Pistons, but what he did to them is wrong. You can't quit on a team like that and still be the ""good guy."" Same with Harden."
"Yes, that’s exactly what I said... picking the super team is capitalist.  But it’s an unpopular move in US sports culture. We want a more “equal” model where every team gets a superstar.  Putting aside your strange comment at the end.   What you say makes sense, but what I’m saying is that it means way less in 5 years when people are struggling to remember Diengs name.   The nice thing for him is that at least nothing will really be said against him cause it wasn’t expected for him to win. But players like Blake or Harden will be the guy who was good but not quite good enough without a ring.   I do really agree that what you said makes sense for a Young player who needs to try and lead a team and grow as a number 1 or 2 option. Why settle for a team that he’s just going to coast on. But if all you care about is achievements and not money, it doesn’t really make sense for a Blake Griffin as he is now or a role player who has passed their prime and is looking for accolades."
Ohh yeah I see now. Yeah honestly if you didn't think Blake griffin could dunk on a fast break or a cut to the basket where there's no defender you're insane. This is Blake griffin lmao
Blake Griffin. RIP Timofey Mozgov
I’m joking around. I did not think Blake griffin and Lamarcus would cause all of this chaos among nba fandom. I tried to apply context to the situation but people were really freaking out over this.
There's literally a quote about him talking to Blake repeatedly  &gt;Blake Griffin said Kevin Durant was the player who recruited him most heavily to Brooklyn.
"&gt;""It's just kind of crazy how it all comes together,"" Griffin said. ""In the beginning of the season, if you'd said that James and LaMarcus and I would end up with the Nets -- everybody's betting against that.""   Uh.... no they wouldn't.  The biggest reason the Nets were doubted after that trade was just the lack of size and depth they had after the Harden trade.   If you told people they'd pickup Blake Griffin and LMA on vet mins to pad out the roster then those people would say ""well shit that fixes the one clear problem they have""."
"There's no penalty to the team executing the buyout if you do this. You'd be punishing the new receiving team exclusively for the poor FO decisions of the team that initially signed the player in question. The only way to truly be fair in all of this is to have some kind of arbitration that would determine the value of Blake, Aldridge etc  at the time of their release to determine what the cap hit would look like to a receiving team.   This is honestly a non-issue. These guys are only difference makers on true contenders. Some middle of the road team isn't going to get over the hump because they signed Blake Griffin on the wrong end of his career."
"Yes, this! Nobody would care or talk about how bad Blake Griffin was if he wasn’t making $35 million a year. At $1.2 million he’s a fantastic contract. Plus you know he’s trying again."
"that's not quite the point I was trying to make, but yes I would agree. And that includes the Melo signing.  My point was in response to this:   &gt;not sure why the corpses of Blake and LMA are causing people to lose their shit about the Nets when everybody seemed to just shrug off the trade for James Harden.  The trade for Harden should be viewed in a very different light because the team had to give up several valuable assets and players - that's why it's a *trade*, because you have to give something up.   It's a much more legitimate transaction than the buyouts - in the case of Griffin and Aldridge, the Nets had to do absolutely nothing except just exist. They were able to get them for free just by virtue of them already being a good team in a big market. Textbook example of the rich getting richer, which is why people (including myself) have a bigger problem with it than the Harden trade."
Why? They got Blake Griffin.
Same shit as Blake Griffin lmao bro didn’t even get traded and he’s death staring the Pistons 💀
"Yes, for sure, Andre Drummond, LaMarcus Aldridge, Blake Griffin, Jeff Teague, all equally good. You definitely get it."
"I’m not sure how helpful either of them legitimately are considering the Nets did not lack playmaking and already had lob threats. Blake I can see for attacking those 3 on 2 situations. On the other hand, both of these guys could be giving back a lot on defense and if this team needed anything, it’s that. Between Harden, Griffin and Kyrie, there’s a lot of turnstiles out there. I’m sure they’ll be fine, but I’m not expecting these guys to be that meaningful, maybe just okay."
Did Blake Griffin just admit to being bad?
"No, he postulated that it *might* be Griffin’s effort, but that he was still awful and didn’t belong on the team even on a minimum contract. He literally replied “I absolutely disagree” to a guy saying he’s a steal on the vet minimum. The entire debate here is about contracts. That was the consensus on Blake Griffin. What if the Jazz had gotten him? Would you be crying about the buyout market? You’d probably be pissed because the Jazz picked up Blake Griffin.  He’s now played a total of 3 games for the Nets where he’s averaging 9/3/0 and somehow that narrative flips on its head. Now he’s suddenly a great danger to the rest of the league. Gobert lives in absolute fear of this guy.   The funniest part about your comment is you’re talking about Nets fans being chill or whatever but you’re the only one foaming at the mouth. The sheer lack of self-awareness is really something else."
Blake Griffin will quietly lead the Nets through the playoffs
People acting like they weren't just calling Griffin and LMA washed a couple weeks ago.  Now they're on the Nets everyone acting like it's Lob City Blake and Portland LMA.
"So, this is a testament to both the Pistons' ineptitude and Andre's but it was basically, ""Anyone but Andre"".   In the 2017 postseason, it was Reggie Jackson (who actually had a great season that year, with some all-star buzz even), then a mix of Tobias Harris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Marcus Morris.  In 2019, Blake Griffin still played half of that series, so he was still the No. 1 option, even with a bum leg. For the rest of the series, it was Reggie Jackson then whoever else could run off a screen - Luke Kennard, Ish Smith, Langston Gallaway, etc.   Looking at Andre's field goal attempts can be odd when trying to find out where he stood as an option because a number of those shots were from offensive rebounds and put-back attempts. Without those putbacks, he was generally shooting 10 times a game or less, with many of *those* shots coming via pick &amp; roll lob and the others often coming from Andre trying to iso off the dribble or attempt one his awful hooks (or god forbid, a 3-pointer)."
"No I understand his point, but my point is more so that the Pistons don’t actually gain anything from having Blake Griffin play. Even if he did want to stay he just doesn’t provide any on court value for them at this stage in his career.   They’re obviously not a win now team, and he’s an older player. If anything it hurts them by having Blake take away minutes from young players like Sekou who need development.   A buyout is also beneficial for the team because they don’t have to pay the entirety of the remainder of the contract. Blake gave back $13 million. It’s not much, but it’s not nothing either and it’s cap space they can spend on other players."
"Last playoff two years ago before suffering another major injury. That playoff killed the last of his athleticism. Anyone who ain’t a complete scrub will shoot what he will shoot playing with these guys.   Exum got money for being an athletic freak and being young. Also becomes an easily trade able piece at that price. No one is trading for Blake griffin, even after his arrival, even as fucking contract filler at 8 million."
I meant by 6th man 6th option not Trez that is on bench and then goes in after 3 mins and plays 30 mins last year Zubac 'starting center was playing something like 18 mins and rest went to Trez. Griffin is pf he is there to play instead of KD and with in small ball line ups. He will have 50% fg cause he will not tank like in Detroit and also based on Blakes last playoff he can be decent. And plenty players in range 8 to 14 are not better than Griffin would you have Dante Exum for 8m or Griffin or at same position 8m Bjelica even Galinari 20m he literally cant move on defense? I mean we will see but im sure that Blake at Jerred Dudley contract is steal
"Blake Griffin doesnt get it that teams doesnt like him coz of his contract.  Ifyou said you are willing to be paid $1.2M/yr, all teams would want to sign you up"
"&gt; Player still has to agree to it.  So if the player doesn't want to go where he's sent, then he simply won't. Blake Griffin ain't going to the motherfucking Timberwolves."
"You’re being ridiculous. 13 million for 32 year old broken Blake griffin. I could see LMA on a 5 mil legacy deal on the blazers or spurs or something, but he’s a minimum player. I actually can’t believe you just said Blake griffin is better than any sixth man in the nba. I’d rather have trezz, Jordan Clarkson, bobby fucking Portis, or goran for Blake griffin. For the money he’s on is slightly better than a fair deal. Not some unfair robbing of the league"
"A little bit different when you’ve got a guy like Griffin who had nothing left to play for in Detroit, just doesn’t wanna get hurt again. Just wants to preserve his energy and his body to be able to sign another contract with a contender and not be totally washed.   Now that he goes to a championship caliber contender and gets to play impact minutes vs. starters minutes, he’s dunking again and is more willing to expend energy to win games because they’ll matter.   That’s what’s kind of whack about it. It’s not ‘fair’ because the effort he was giving in Detroit isn’t reflective of what he still has left in the tank. He’s not all-star lob city Griffin but he’s still one of the best 32 year old power forwards in the league.   And they’re paying him like he’s a guy fighting fighting for a bench spot. It’s just an ugly looking situation from a sportsmanship standpoint but I’m happy for Blake. And Aldridge and Drummond. If these elite players need to chase a championship ring to reinvigorate their effort, it’ll make for some more entertaining basketball."
"Because the players you’re referencing are nowhere near as good today as they were at the time of signing their contracts. The contracts you’re referring to where teams “have to” overpay their guys are generally only marginal overpays and somewhat justifiable at the time of signing the contract. They’re generally not worth the totality of their contracts but most of the time they’re worth something like 80-90% of it. It Blake Griffin was playing at a level where you’d feel comfortable paying him something close to the $34 million he was making, he wouldn’t have been bought out. It’s only because he’s so far from being that player that the Pistons even considered letting him go for nothing.  Like, Rudy Gobert is a slight overpay. There is 0 chance he gets bought out."
"Because most teams would love to have Blake Griffin for the Vet Minimum to have as their 4th/6th guy (roster depending). Someone that you can run the offense through for a few possessions, and can create a few shots each game for himself or others. Someone you can plug in for 10 quality minutes, then can play more *okay* quality minutes. That's invauable to have.  The outrage comes from the fact that each team *couldn't* have Blake at the Vet minimum. They could trade for him at the 30m+ point, but couldn't get him for 1m. Instead the Nets get him for free, giving up no assets.  I felt that Drummond was far worse and deserved more outrage. Same concept"
Nobody wants to mention Blake Griffin.
Who wants to be the guard that throws up the lob and have Blake Griffin fuck up his leg permanently.
"Wait I’m sorry... *who* exactly was saying Blake griffin was “bad?” That’s fucking news to me bro lol all I’ve heard is “Blake griffin just keeps getting better and better, it’s too bad he’s stuck with the pistons.”  Has that *not* been the narrative? He’s developed a pretty good jumper, and he plays his heart out. Meanwhile he’s still got some classic Blake stuff (dunking/slashing) in the tank. I haven’t heard one peep about him being “bad.”  Shut the hell up Blake griffin and enjoy your trophy. I hope your championship ring says “Team USA 2021” on it instead of “Brooklyn Nets.”"
"Igoudala has 12 mill(11% of cap, Dany Green has 15 mill 14% of cap) Blake has veteran thats like 2m, and Drummond 800k for the rest of season, so if you had LMA, Griffin and Drummond at same time it would take 6% of your cap space. And considering that base max is 25% 30% or 35% of cap if you had 2 stars on young team it is 55% 60% of cap, and on expirienced team it is 70%. On nets big 3 takes up 100% of cap space. So it is not the same like Rondo, Jeff Green, Ingles or Iggy signing."
"While I get that people are annoyed because the buyout market was super impactful this season.... but in reality? How often is it that the buyout market has players that even as good as a washed up Blake Griffin, LMA, and Andre Brick20shotsattheRim Drummond.   Most years the best player you're going to get on the buyout market is Joakim Noah who hasn't played in a year and a half."
I think this is really hard to say with how he plays. He’s in his athletic prime right now. Really hard to say how he will age and how his body will hold up. He could peak at 28-32 but I’d bet we see his best year by 26. Blake griffin peaked at 24 for example
"Blake Griffin is currently at $8,568 per minute played in the NBA (regular season)."
"what does your response even mean. blake griffin is arguably a top 100 player in the history of the game, and that's not more than ""good"" to you? your perspective is bad."
And prime Blake griffin
"Bruh we dont give a shit, of course we hate them but dont lie to me when literally most of the fanbases were literally shitting on the nets. Now yall acting like we're the only ones doing that? Talk about washing your own hands or maybe this sub really has the memory of a goldfish. The blake griffin acquisition? The LMA acquisition, i saw tons of flairs acting like its broken, not just laker fans buddy"
"we really have to re-evaluate how we reflect on players' careers if Blake Griffin, who will have a decent chance at the hall of fame, is thought of as a disappointment."
"I wonder if an MVP will ever be younger than the ROY. Derrick Rose and Blake Griffin came close on 2011.  It happened in baseball In 2015 Bryce Harper won the NL MVP, the NL ROY was Kris Bryant who is 9 months older than Harper.   An Even more extreme one is Luke Kuechly, who won DPOY in 2013, is a month younger than Khalil Mack, who was drafted in 2014 and went on to win Defensive ROY."
Chris Paul and Blake Griffin.
Bro but in that universe Blake Griffin is still making mad dunks.
"Yeah we can agree to disagree. Because there’s zero chance washed up LMA is helping the Grizzlies stay in the playoffs/win the play-in game. I didn’t say you did, but that was the common narrative when the Nets signed LMA. It was ridiculous, he’s not good anymore that’s why he was bought out in the first place. Ironically, the one player who was actually good that was bought out, the Lakers got. But nobody says anything about that for some reason.   Again, if you want to argue the buyout market is unfair or whatever, I’m not here for that. I never said anything about it. I just laughed at the idea that the Nets “bought” a championship because they bought out washed up Blake Griffin, and LMA (LMA literally just retired lmao). It’s a ridiculous notion that I feel like is to emotionally hedge the narrative. If the Nets win it will be “they had to have a super team to win!!”, where as if they lose everyone will laugh at them. They aren’t any much better than the Lakers, Clippers, or 76ers. All of those teams have a legitimate shot at winning.  Again, this post is about how the Nets “bought” a championship. The only guy on their roster who they bought out was Blake Griffin who won’t have a meaningful impact in the playoffs. Blake Griffin isn’t even better than Drummond, not even close but you don’t hear anyone say “the Lakers bought a championship”."
"Well people were mad the Nets signed him and Blake Griffin but uh, not seeing why it was an issue now."
"Idk why teams never get the memo. Win now = win never.   This trade reminds me of our horrific trade to get Blake Griffin, where we gave up players like Tobias Harris &amp; a first round pick that ended up being SGA"
Clearly the Nets strategy is for 76ers not to gain familiarity with their team even if it means sacrifice of victory. The Nets could have played Durant and Blake Griffin against the 76ers and rest them the day before against TWolves (and still won).
"Reminds me of our trade to get Blake Griffin, just awful.   Win now = win never"
"Top buyout candidates? Blake Griffin has failed to make a single field goal in his last 3 games and LMA made Drummond look like the real AD, you guys are overexaggerating these 'top buyout' candidates, The Nets are a super team regardless of Blake &amp; LMA"
"blake griffin, kevin love, lamarcus aldridge, and Z-Bo were in the same tier  i think griffin and love were actually clearly better than Bosh personally"
"Yes, I am too? Why would you think I wasn't?  Did you miss when the basketball player Kevin Durant, the basketball player Kyrie Irving and the basketball player James Harden, as well as the basketball players LaMarcus Aldridge and Blake Griffin all chose to sign with the basketball team in Brooklyn, a Burrough if New York City, the Brooklyn Nets?"
Bro wait for the corpse of Blake Griffin smh
"He will be and we’re overdue for it, Blake Griffin was the last Drafted rookie (That we didn’t trade) who became a starter"
"He probably would've been first team in 2013-2014 if voters didn't prefer to put 1 point guard and 1 shooting guard; especially at that time. It's gotten a lot more positionless since then.  2014 guard spots were a toss up between CP3 Harden and Curry; Curry was significantly ahead of all the other 2nd team players in voting  &gt;First team  &gt;F: Kevin Durant (625 points, 125 first-team votes)  &gt;F: LeBron James (623, 124)  &gt;C: Joakim Noah (551, 101)  &gt;G: Chris Paul (540, 86)  &gt;G: James Harden (502, 73)  &gt;Second team  &gt;G: Stephen Curry (489, 65)  &gt;G: Tony Parker (210, 14)  &gt;F: Blake Griffin (350, 5)  &gt;F: Kevin Love (237, 2)  &gt;C: Dwight Howard (226, 9)  He was only 13 points behind Harden for 1st team all-nba, and had 65 first team votes to harden's 73; while being 279 points above the other 2nd team guard Parker"
Blake Griffin his last two years in detroit at PF  Richaun Holmes at C
PG: Steph Curry  SG: Tyler Johnson  SF: Klay Thompson  PF: Blake Griffin  Don’t know about center  /s
KD just came off from injury and is still on a minutes restriction. Harden is injured. Aldridge is sick. Blake Griffin has bad knees. How much more explicit does Adam Silver want it?
1. Chris Paul  2. James Harden  3. Vince Carter  4. Tracy McGrady  5. Hakeem Olajuwon  6. Kevin Garnett   7. Dennis Rodman  8. Michael Jordan  9. Blake Griffin   10. Shaq
These rankings are just for clicks. It’s a toss up between Ben Simmons or Blake Griffin.
"It’s not just the Finals appearance. It’s the All-Star appearances, All-NBA teams, All-Defensive teams, plus the Finals appearances. Lol at using basketball reference for Hof probability. They have Rondo over Klay Thompson, Blake Griffin and Giannis."
My boy Blake Griffin Jr
"The clippers dogged Blake Griffin  Kawahi dogged the Spurs   PG dogged the pacers and the thunder   Pat Bev dogged Westbrook’s knee   Last years playoff performance and trash talking and antics.   The clippers are pretty unlikeable because of these things, add in the fact that the team is really good and you have a recipe for other fans disliking your team"
"He was a rookie.  The criteria for being a rookie in the NBA is crystal clear and it is more restrictive than MLB     In the NHL, you can be a rookie even if you played 25 games in prior seasons.    In MLB, you can be a rookie if you had no more the 130 at bats or 50 innings pitched in prior seasons.    Simmons had never played an NBA game and was clearly a rookie.   Also, the idea that rehabbing a broken foot is better training for the NBA than playing college basketball is pretty absurd.  Also, Simmons is only 49 days older than Mitchell.   Just 7 years earlier, Blake Griffin was unanimously voted ROY under the same circumstances."
"Does kd use twitter during the playoffs?  he's got to remember he's the big dog of the locker room. One tweet and he starts going off, kyrie takes off for 2 weeks, harden heads to Atlantic City. Blake griffin forgets how to dunk, these playoffs sure are goin to be interesting. This team in a way is mentally volatile."
Blake Griffin doesn’t need no help!
Blake Griffin thinks he is Edge with that spear.
Fuck Blake Griffin man
[blake Griffin upon arrival to the nets](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=teRzkaURkeo)
I was told Blake griffin can’t jump off the ground anymore
I just can't imagine Blake Griffin playing consistent playoff minutes
"Nothing irrational about it, Durant is basically taking the easiest way to multiple rings, Kyrie has been a PR nightmare for years and Harder is ...Harden.   Don't forget about cheap shot , flop master, cry baby, Blake Griffin either. What's not to hate?"
KD and Blake Griffin I presume?
Ope! Don’t forget about Blake Griffin!
Giannis blatantly helping off Blake Griffin and dating a 35-36% 3 point shooter to shoot but can’t tell himself taking pull up 3s with 19 on the clock every night is a bad idea
Blake Griffin hall of fame? What is Mark smoking?
"Blake Griffin does a voice in that *Mitchells v. The Machines* Netflix animated movie that came out Friday, btw.  It's a fun, light movie."
"The Nets haven’t won a damn thing yet and Blake griffin was a washed afterthought until he went to the Nets ans this sub decided he was an all-star in hiding. Even for the sake of argument, let’s pretend the championship-less Nets are favored over the defending Champion Lakers. That makes the Lakers what.. the second best team in the league? Boo fucking hoo. It can’t only be ‘fair’ when Lebron is the clear favorite."
Against the Nets with 3 HoFs and a decent Blake Griffin?
"Ye, a wall of Blake Griffin, Jeff Green and Deandre Jordan are really gonna slow Giannis down"
"Cavs fan. All members of the title squad are pantheon for me, so I'm a Love defender. My way of looking at it is this: Kev took that extension with the caveat that he wanted to stay competitive (https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2018/10/kevin_love_needed_assurance_th.html).  *Six games* into that first season, they fire Ty Lue and go full tank. With management not prioritizing winning, Kev requested a trade two years ago that obviously never came to fruition (https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/12/09/report-kevin-love-wants-cavaliers-to-trade-him-to-contender/amp/). Since then, the Cavs have traded nearly all their vets or let them walk. I'm sure seeing the Pistons straight-up waive Blake Griffin for the remainder of his massive deal earlier this year is all the more frustrating for a guy who is clearly not in the long-term plans for this organization and has wanted out for years.  To an extent, I get that you honor your contract, and that players have to make the best of their situations and stay positive. I also get that from the Cavs' point of view, there is no net-positive way out of this situation. But I also think that to Love, that Cavs extension was made on false promises, and that he likely expected to be taken care of in the event that they could not remain competitive due to that promise, and due to his status as a pivotal piece on that championship squad.  I think everyone is in agreement that both sides have needed to move on for a while now. Kev has been working a job for a dysfunctional employer for three years and can't do anything to change it. He most likely doesn't have a ton of time left to contribute to a good team at all, and he has to spend at least the next two years playing for a team that doesn't want him. I'd bet I'd get a little pissy too, if I'm being honest with myself."

"Is he really an athletic freak? Maybe when he was younger but I honestly don’t consider him to be freakishly athletic at this point. Freak athlete to me is like young Dwight, DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin, AD, etc. Drummond isn’t anywhere near as explosive as those guys (in their primes) right now."
That’s Pistons Blake Griffin Numbers
Blake Griffin-esque dunk
"The only way he would have been a bust is if his shot was ineffective against the NBA defense. Which was low odds because of how quick his release is and how high the arc.  Injuries would be bad, and a concern of mine at the time but still, he loses that speed he can still be your floor spacer who can shoot at 40%.  The guy was such a safe bet but everyone wanted large and athletic PGs that year and it was just Blake Griffin and everyone else."
"at least you admit it. reddit was shitting on chris paul big time.  the overreaction to ""bad"" contracts whether it is westbrook, paul, or wiggins, or jamal murray or simmons or siakam or al horford or (or even blake griffin) or whoever, is totally ridiculous. they are always way easier to shed then people claim and half the time the player in question is not nearly as ""washed"" as everyone claims. plus, everyone acts like ""cap space"" is this magical thing without understaning how rare it is for genuine difference makers to ever hit the market and how much, generally, you have to overpay for them when they do."
"Blake doesn't feel right.  I'm trying to make a case for Duncan.  He only played 6 years in this decade but still had a bunch of All Stars, All NBA's, All Defenses, and a ring.  Quite frankly I think I'd consider throwing him over Griffin or maybe even Howard if we're getting loose with the Center position.  Howard wasn't much to write home about after Duncan retired anyway.  I think Kobe is in a similar boat to Duncan as well.  In fact, I'd totally give Kobe the spot over Klay.  Kobe did more in that decade than Klay.    The thing I hate about all-decade teams is careers rarely align cleanly."
"The league just allowed Harden, Kyrie, Durant, LMA, and Blake Griffin"
"Wait “caught,” did I miss something, did Blake Griffin retire or something?"
Stephen Curry  AI  Blake Griffin

"Mike James, Blake Griffin, Joe Harris are capable playmakers."
That’s true but Blake Griffin had already been named an all star in his rookie year.   After the CP3 trade everyone thought LAC would be a top team.
The Blake Griffin special
he is way better than Blake Griffin rn wtf lol
"He has 83 more blocks than Enes Kanter, and 95 more than Blake Griffin."
Blake gave up 13 million. That is significant money...  https://www.detroitbadboys.com/2021/3/5/22316161/detroit-pistons-blake-griffin-buyout-13-3-million
Definitely got the blake griffin special. So not sure this really counts. Should have been an offensive foul.
"You know, normally, 99% of the time, I fucking hate when people go full Blake Griffin and assault people with their offhand to get an unfair advantage on posters.  But in this particular case, if anything it's a defensive foul. Or rather, it seems like a blatant defensive foul to me.  AD jumps straight into him. It's not like AD is chilling there in the restricted area and establishes verticality and there's some contact. He literally just sprints at him and jumps into him and creates significant contact."
"I hope they start calling these offhand blake griffin forearm fouls more. This one didn't seem too bad, AD got caught, but they get annoying"
"To be honest, I also don’t think the team has done him any favors or put him a position to succeed. He has virtually no perimeter game - so why has been made a point guard every year he’s been in the league? Ideally he should be in the Blake Griffin/Giannis role - secondary playmaking big who can lead the break - IMO."
"I'll be interested to see his game in the long run. feels like he make have a Blake Griffin like arch, but I do see more playmaking from him already, so we'll see"
"I don't make fun of Wall for getting hurt (hell, I don't make fun of him for anything). but one thing we should make clear -- he played a game that was never going to age super well. same with D-Rose, Blake Griffin.   these guys came in and mostly dominated from day 1 on extreme, game breaking athleticism. yes they all got injured, but lots of players get injured. what really happened is that as their athleticism wained they didn't have the right skillset to maintain the same effectiveness. maybe getting injured made that happen faster, but it was going to happen either way"
"Blake Griffin, lol."
"let me clarify u/puffx0r and u/makaveli80  I watched every game Harden has played in Houston. I didn't have a team and started following them after.  I didn't say his teamates were bad. I said overall the team had below average OFFENSIVE players. Or the players were extremely one dimensional  A great example is PJ Tucker. With the spacing of D'Antoni and Harden's scoring gravity and creation he got some of the easist possible three pointers, wide open corner 3's. That is literally the only thing he is capable of doing, he is well below league average above the break, his jumper isn't fast. He has an incredibly rudimentary handle, can't pass and bc he is groundbound and slow he has to shoot a tough low percentage floater instead of a layup  How did PJ look offensively without Harden and D'antoni? 4.4 pts on 36.6% from the field and 31.6% from three. All numbers are a career low.  We saw the limitations of the role players against the best defense in the league with the Lakers. When they doubled Harden the team was in trouble. They were comfortable shooting contested threes, attacking the closeouts, passing, cutting or finishing. Same issues against the zone looks.  How many role players were clearly above average at multiple thing offensively in the las few years? Eric Gordon, Jeff Green and maybe Danuel House. Let me know if I'm forgetting someone  To be clear there have been some good offensive role players like Ryan Anderson, but they were still limited. He went defense first on his minimum salary guys  How many role players were clearly above average at multiple thing offensively in the las few years? Eric Gordon, Jeff Green and maybe Danuel House. Let me know if I'm forgetting someone  It's not just Joe Harris. Shamet, Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are all very good, and versatile role players on offense"
"LeBron isn’t non influential because of his skill. He’s not as influential because LeBron is that unique. There will never be another player with the iq of a rondo/cp3, the passing skills of a magic johnson, and the size/athleticism and size of a Blake griffin, Larry Johnson, and elite durability and longevity. You can be influenced by Jordan’s mentality, you can be influenced by currys shooting or AIs handles but you can’t be influenced by what LeBron does because it’s simply impossible"
He’s comparable to Blake Griffin at this point. Won’t give you too much but he’d be nice off the bench.
"Youre really reaching for straws now huh? Players on all teams miss some amount of time, some teams skip practice, some players work on their games in their free time, others dont.  Being in ""rhythym"" is incredibly dependent on many factors outside of nba court time.  Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, Demarcus Cousins all looked good on their first games back from injury, where was the rhythym there?"
Dude was trying to Blake Griffin his way out to Brooklyn
Dwyane Wade and Blake Griffin hosting gameshows now....
Blake Griffin in shambles
No it doesn’t because both Blake and Green can stretch the floor.  Claxton and DJ can only play 5 alongside Durant and one of Green/Griffin.  Brooklyn rarely plays all 3 at the same time.  They almost always look to stagger.
"""I never charged you for that autograph""  - Blake Griffin to Malachi Flynn, probably."
Blake Griffin is the hardest working player in the NBA
Blake Griffin 2.0?
"&gt;I mean Drummond is maybe the only recent example of an expiring not being very valuable?   Also LaMarcus Aldridge, and clearly the Pistons believed Blake Griffin was headed there as well as he was only a few months from being an expiring contract and he was bought out instead."
"It rarely works like that anymore, it's a pretty outdated idea, that someone on a huge expiring contract has value to other teams. The only teams who would want that are teams with even worse long term deals who are hoping to open up cap space to make a splash in free agency, and you don't see much of that anymore. Like for instance, this season LaMarcus Aldridge had a large expiring contract, and look what happened with him: he ended up getting bought out, rather than used as salary ballast in some blockbuster trade. Same thing with Andre Drummond and Blake Griffin.   These guys who are clearly not worth the last year of their huge contracts don't end up in some trade for another star like that anymore, they just get bought out. Odds are if the Cavs just hold onto Love till 2022-23 then he'll end up being bought out rather than traded for something that helps the Cavs."
Maybe he could be like Blake Griffin? Playing terribly until he gets traded.
I thought Blake Griffin was
KLove should do a Blake Griffin style buyout and retire man. He seems legit unhappy
" &gt;Blake Griffin flanked by two mobile, switchable 7-footers (Durant and Claxton) will defend Embiid as well as any other contender.    &gt;...  &gt;When Blake’s tired, they’ll throw DeAndre flanked by Durant and Green.   This is exactly what I'm saying though. The Nets can't play six guys at once, so if they're playing Blake and Claxton or DeAndre and Green, that means there are only three other spots on the court for their three stars plus Joe Harris (not to mention those lineups with two bigs won't have ideal spacing).  In a competitive playoff series, you want your stars getting 40+ minutes. If they're relying on two other bigs at a time to contend with Embiid, it squeezes their rotation in a way that doesn't allow them the spacing they'd otherwise like to have. They can't play three stars plus Harris plus two bigs all at once. They can stagger, but ideally their stars wouldn't be on the bench that long anyway."
"I’m biased too.  Blake Griffin flanked by two mobile, switchable 7-footers (Durant and Claxton) will defend Embiid as well as any other contender.  I expect tons of TOs from Embiid in that matchup. And Blake will get under his skin as well.  When Blake’s tired, they’ll throw DeAndre flanked by Durant and Green.  DJ did a great job on Embiid the last game. DJ will get under his skin too.  This configuration can guard both Embiid and Simmons by packing the paint, but having switchable enough defenders to cover open wings."
"How about 22 clippers teams with Blake griffin, dj, and cp3 on all 22 teams?"
He was more Jeff Green than Blake Griffin
If I was a NBA player I wouldn’t have any loyalty to the org as they are going to do what is best for them like we saw with Blake Griffin. Which is fine. But I would have loyalty to the fans
"If they were ever going to add a fifth to Inside it would probably be Blake Griffin, he probably has more late night show appearances than every other active player combined"
"Aaron Gordon, Blake Griffin, Drummond, list goes on of guys who didn’t pull this shit on bad teams"
"That is..... very interesting and I hadn't thought of that , I don't fully agree but then I look at how both Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge all of the sudden became Prime Kevin Garnett and Charles Barkley when they were added to the Nets and there and there might be a little something to this, although I think it's just more media spin than player mentality"
How are you gonna define 'lack of effort'? Blake Griffin refusing to dunk? Kawhi sitting out because of 'injury'? Harden refusing to show up to pre season games? Kyrie taking unlimited PTO?
What’s 100x worse than that is putting BLAKE GRIFFIN over any of these guys
y BLAKE GRIFFIN all caps tho
It depends on who picks first. Griffin was far and away the best player for that draft like the first 4 years. You want to win right away you probably take Blake
He's going the Blake Griffin route except being a dick along with it.  He's a mental health advocate and is constantly on the court doing shit like this.  At what point is he just a bad teammate?
I hope OG hits Blake Griffin with a Tombstone Piledriver tomorrow.
How abiut the Nets losing in the finals to Lebron after being up 3-1 and Lebron blocks KYRIE! Bonus points if he goes up for a dunk in the final 20 seconds and puts Blake Griffin on a poster.
&gt;Suns were winning before CP3 got there  You talking about that 8 game winning streak they had in the bubble?? Because a team that finished 5 games under .500 doesn't sound like a winning team to me.  &gt;The lob city clippers were always gonna be decent with Blake Griffin and the other talent they had.  They went 32-50 the year before they added Chris Paul. He's literally the reason they had that nickname lol  &gt;he's been the beneficiary of some really good luck and great timing.  What luck?
CP3 has a habit of ending up on really good teams but doing nothing with them but still getting credit. It's wild to me.  Suns were winning before CP3 got there. OKC had a hodge-podge of average to above-average players. The lob city clippers were always gonna be decent with Blake Griffin and the other talent they had. Harden was taking his teams to the playoffs before CP3 came around.  Ya'll hype the shit out of Chris. He's good but he's been the beneficiary of some really good luck and great timing. It's the exact opposite for Russ.
I swear every one of Steph’s 3s goes through the net like a prime Blake Griffin dunk lol. I’ve never seen a player who’s 3s have that extra “fuck you” factor as they go through the net.
Do Blake griffin next
"A lot of guys on the Nets honestly.   Landry Shamet, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, Jeff Green, Blake Griffin, Nicolas Claxton...  I can see any one of them stepping and making a big contribution."
CP3 Cental Roast of Blake Griffin
"Yeah he is by now means a bad player, just not the next GOAT caliber player and overpaid for what he can give you, but for less money, I think he'd do well in many teams. Basically like Blake Griffin, as long as you don't need him to be a facilitator and play 38 minutes a game, he's a solid player. His contract was the scariest part."
"You know tim Duncan was instantly a top 5 player in the NBA the season he joined. That rookie shaq, wes, Jordan were instantly amazing, way way better players than Tatum, not even close, Tatum literally a sub compared to those guys. But because Tatum LOST and conference semi finals in a weak east he was more successful? You need to get your head checked. Magic Johnson WON a championship and took charge of the team in the finals. Tatums rookie year is well outside of the top 20 maybe 30 rookie seasons. Blake griffin was better his rookie year."
"The same thing is happening with the Nets though.   People are talking about “overpowered role players” like... Jeff Green, Claxton, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, and Blake Griffin."
"If you base it mostly off of team playoff success post merger you're correct, but I think that's a little unfair to other players given that the Celtics had a really good team around Tatum and the East as a whole was really weak that year. There's no way Tatum was close to as good as rookie Bird, Magic, Jordan, Hakeem, Duncan, Ewing, Robinson, Shaq, LeBron, Blake Griffin etc"
"ya I think his playmaking ability was TOTALLY unexpected. people are shitting on Stan Van Gundy's coaching job, but hopefully he gets some credit for unlocking Zion's playmaking. If you comp Zion w/ Blake Griffin... Blake didn't really become a playmaker until midway through his career. His first few years he was literally just lobs, dunks, and rim running.   &amp;#x200B;  Zion's game has matured so fast already and he's only played like 1 full season of NBA basketball. Coach has to get some credit. If he develops a competent shot, good night NBA."
Blake Griffin is trying more than he was detroit and is solid but nowhere near his former level. Why does everything have to be hyperbole?

"Giannis is a lock, as is Russ. KD and Harden too. Blake Griffin also has a slight chance too. 100% to all of those guys, except Blake, who is probably like a 30% chance.  Embiid isn’t a HOFer yet, but an MVP or two and/or a title with a FMVP makes him a lock. Even if those things don’t happen, 5-6 *healthy* seasons around this current level of play probably locks him in. So I don’t want to say he’s a lock now, a lot can happen in half a decade, but he’s on the right trajectory.  Jimmy “Jimmy” Butler has a chance too, but he’s by no means a lock, yet, IMO.   Tatum and Trae both look like hall of famers so far, and they’re young enough that if they stay healthy they’ll accumulate a ton of stats. Both will be all stars and all-NBA players, which means they’re both on a hall trajectory as well. I’d say that they’re likely to be hall of famers, though there’s soooo much time before anyone can definitely say either is a lock, but IMO they both have &gt;50% chances imo.  LaMelo is in the same boat as those two, though with even less accolades and more to prove. Though again, I feel like if he develops as rapidly as he has been, he should make the HOF someday. As long as health doesn’t derail his career he should make it. There are players that are just so transcendent that you can see those savant level plays and flashes as rookies, and LaMelo has plenty of those. He’s well on his way to becoming a premier player, which in turn is a HOFer, but it’s still WAY too early to say it definitively, but the question is “most likely going to become a HoFer”. I’d say that there’s less than a 49% chance that injuries derail his career or he just stagnates and never improves at all, which means he has at least a 51% chance, which technically is “most likely”.  Kevin Love has a sneakier case than you’d think, and with the relatively low standards of the Basketball Hall, I can see it. That whole Cleveland big 3 kinda deserves it, so then I’d have to say Kyrie as well. If Kyrie or Love never had great seasons outside of the 2016 title comeback, they’d still make it, and they both have amazing seasons besides 2016. Both had stupid iconic plays. Love somehow locking down Steph with “The Stop”, and Kyrie’s amazing 3 to put them up for good are both iconic plays, and being the team to take out 73-9 GS in a 3-1 comeback probably gets enough clout to make the hall.  So in order of current likelihood I have 10 guys most likely to make it. In this order:  1A. Durant (100%)  1B. Harden (100%)  1C. Giannis (100%)  1D. Westbrook (100%)  5. Embiid (81%)  6. Kyrie (75%)  7. Tatum (60%)  8. Love (58%)  9. Trae (55%)  10. LaMelo (52%)"
That’s kind of the Griffin thing from back then. He beat on guys and then they’d retaliate and look like an asshole and Blake would start flopping.
"Blake Griffin: 6 all-star appearances, 5 all-NBA selections, 8 seasons averaging 20+ ppg"
"The year is 2023. The KD-is-back Warriors have broken the single season win record with 74-8 after picking up Blake Griffin for 32$/mo at the trade deadline. Steph and KD are both scoring exactly 31.2 ppg each, due to Kerr's new forced sharing policy of not letting the team's highest scorer shoot until someone else catches up. The nets subreddit is shut down in protest of their ownership trading KD for a package of now-DPOY Andrew Wiggins and James Wiseman.   After a hard fought WCF loss the year before LeBron James decided ""fuck it"" and proceeded to buy the Cleveland Cavaliers. He immediately traded Sexton, Garland, and 20 future draft picks for Himself, Chris Paul, and Carmelo Anthony. They trio meets up with Dwyane Wade in Toronto where the local LeBron fan club has custom built a giant wooden banana boat. Just as the four begin to depart Alex Caruso, who had been hiding in LeBron James' suitcase the entire time, jumps into the last seat. The team now paddles down to Ohio where they proceed to win 32 games, good for 8th seed in the east.   Oubre is now on a two way contract with the Warriors, averaging 28 seconds per game. He has demanded that the ownership ""only play him in the hype minutes"" where the score is close in the final 5 minutes. This has only happened in two games, both against the newly rebuilding lakers.    The two teams meet in the finals after historic dual 12-0 runs. LeBron, now 7'2"", is averaging 48/12/22. As the first game is about to begin, LeBron announces his retirement under the condition that Jordan fans all admit he's the goat if he wins. As the game starts the warriors reveal Kerr's latest revolutionary offensive scheme, dubbed the friendship circle. Every player on the Warriors roster scored 12 points while playing energized defense, leading to a 120-72 victory.  With all the saved energy from reducing his scoring load Blake Griffin is now averaging 12 blocks and 18 rebounds per game.The cavaliers suffer two more losses, 110-65 and 140-83. Lebron has shattered Jordan's scoring record with 70, but Skip Bayless says he is beginning to question whether LeBron has that killer instinct. Game 4 starts 70-24, LeBron heads to the locker room feeling slightly less sad than the Celtics in 2016-17. His teammates, having already given up, start to pour each other shots of Hennessey.   After a 15 minute delay, officials check the locker room only to see black smoke and pentagrams. Just as the officials are about to call the game a forfeit, LeBron James, now 11 feet tall with wings, crashes through the roof of the stadium. Two of the officials begin to question whether LeBron might be taking human growth hormone, but are both quickly fired by Adam Silver. LeBron proceeds to score 85 points over the next 19 minutes to cut the lead to 120-109. 5 minutes left.  Kelly Oubre takes off his jacket and calls on Kerr to sub him in. Kerr, desperate, agrees.   The fans, who have all but given up hope, see their former FMVP Kelly Oubre walk on stage. His energy breathes life into the Arena. With their newly energized defense they manage to hold LeBron to 74 FG%, and the additional stops raised the team's true shooting percentage by 14.8% - just enough to stay in the game. LeBron, clearly out of breath, demands his health team bring him lamb blood and wolfsbane. 150-149 warriors, 2 seconds on the clock, the warriors starting center Alen Smailagic fouls LeBron. LeBron, steps up to the line, but he knows Oubre's tricks. Oubre begins to wiggle his legs, and LeBron laughs and drains the first free throw.   However, LeBron looks back. Oubre hasn't flinched. No reaction, he continues to look straight ahead, wiggling his knees all the same. The pure matador energy radiating from this man captures the entire audience. Everyone is staring at his knees. LeBron shoots his second shot free throw and it rims out. The stadium goes berserk, people are calling Oubre the goat while analysts are saying that missing 1 free throw out of 2 is fairly common for a 70% free throw shooter. Oubre goes 1-4 in overtime but the warriors win anyways. Twitter is seeing a suspicious trend of newly created accounts near SF tweeting #KDsweptLeBronTWICE. Michael Jordan releases a documentary about how he would've won if it were him. Draymond gets FMVP for holding LeBron to 83/22/40"
/r/nba can't make up its mind about whether Blake Griffin is actually good and wasn't trying at all in Detroit or Blake Griffin is completely washed
Blake Griffin should have gotten one from today's game
KD is less of a mismatch for Ben Simmons than Embiid is for Blake Griffin.
"Blake Griffin was super hyped back then, and Curry was from that Cinderella run, so I don't think people were still wary of how Curry would fare in NBA."
"no, i'll never get over the year we should have had blake griffin and ended up with the 4th pick."
"People want to pick and choose when 73-9 means something. They lost in the finals to **the** best team that season, plus the warriors got rid of Barnes and added KD.  Y'all make it sound like he got bought out and joined the team as is with no cap hit (like Blake Griffin and the Nets). People would have cried if he joined LeBron. There's a good 3 or 4 teams he could have joined that would have won back to back still and people would have whined. He's supposed to join a losing team? People have to win "" a certain way?"" it's ridiculous.  Y'all just didn't like seeing your seasons become moot."
"Blake has really played some solid minutes since signing with the Nets.  Him being the 4th or 5th option on the floor has gotten him some very good looks where he has done well.  He’s got less than a months worth of games on the floor with the Nets and leads in charges drawn.  He’s finding ways to contribute.    If your gonna ask Nets fans if they want Blake Griffin as the 8th/9th man or TLC, he’s a solid option."
"I think he just really hates Blake Griffin, who I believe is eskimo bros w Book."
"Chris Paul: ""Stay down, final warning.""  Blake Griffin: ""I could flop like this all day.""  Zoom out to Blake and DJ fighting CP3 two on one."
"Blake Griffin is like the 8th option on this team putting up 16 points, 5 rebs, 4 asts, 6/9 fg, 2/3 3pts  Wishing the best of luck to anyone looking to beat this team in the playoffs/finals. Really hope someone does, looking very unlikely though"
Hey this is Blake Griffin . Chris Paul trying to get in the locker room ! Get down here and save me !
"This game reminded me of why I didn’t like Blake Griffin back in the day, dude sure does chirp a lot for a massive flopper. Loved to see this even after the game was over."
"Harden is the only one that forced his way out, kd and kyrie came in free agency and blake griffin is not good enough to do that."
"Blake Griffin has now has 19 dunks with the Brooklyn Nets, and 0 dunks with the Pistons to start the season"
Blake Griffin has been pretty good.
"not just you, have not heard as much senile bullshit from him. There was that one time he confused Blake Griffin with Joe Harris, but all in all a good day by his standards"
"Blake and Detroit needed to part ways one way or another. The Pistons fully embraced the tank before the 2019-20 season even ended and they only delved deeper at the start of this season. So if Blake did hold back, it’s tough to blame him since everything about the organization seemed to suggest they wanted to lose, a lot.  That said, Blake was also Detroit’s point forward. This was great pre-injury. He willed them to the postseason with amazing play all year, but after missing a calendar year with injuries and surgery, dude clearly was not in the shape necessary to run a team for 30+ min a night when he came back.   Not only was he cooked from a stamina perspective, he was also getting way worse looks in Detroit. He was very ball-centric (by design) and did the bulk of his work from the perimeter or with his back to the basket. And post-injury Blake wasn’t going to be splitting double teams off the dribble from the perimeter while a defense focused on explicitly cutting off his drive. And he didn’t have the pop to back someone down and rise with no momentum. So watching him in Detroit this year, even when engaged (say, against LA), there just weren’t a lot of dunk possibilities presenting themselves.  In contrast, defenses care as little as possible about Griffin in Brooklyn. Their focus is pretty much everyone BUT Blake, and he’s not handling the rock like he was in Detroit. All he has to do now is roam free and fill gaps in a fraction of the minutes he was getting in Detroit. It’s the perfect role for him right now.   TL;DR I’m glad to see Blake playing important basketball, since that wasn’t going to happen I. Detroit where he was option 1A, 1B, and 1C."
"""Ayo Harden, Im getting Lavert, Allen outta here, I'll see you soon!""- KD  ""Bet, I'll come outta shape and lazy so it's easier to trade for me""- Harden  ""I'll make the fans think i can't dunk anymore and pistons will buy me out and I'll join you guys!""- Blake Griffin  ""----------""- Kyrie Irving"
Am I really watching KD Blake Griffin and Harden in the playoffs. Like am I dreaming
In other news Blake Griffin is having career ending injury after punching a wall again.
the Celtics should simply guard the 3 all-time great scorers and one of the best shooters in NBA history and also not leave Blake griffin open. idk what theyre thinking
"Blake Griffin needed time to ask harden ""what are we?"" after he kissed him"
His offense isn't good either... Im saying he's not better than Jeff green. I would legitimately have Jeff green over Blake Griffin as a Nets fan (and a guy that watched Jeff green last year).
Blake Griffin pulled a Bernie Madoff on the Pistons
"Which team is going to beat the nets? When kyrie, harden and KD are all healthy its very difficult. When joe Harris and blake griffin are hitting also, then its downright impossible"
Celtics are discombobulating... A Blake Griffin dunkfest is really too much for anyone to bear...
"BROOKLYN, THIS IS FOR YOUUUUUUUU  - Blake Griffin"
Blake Griffin looking vintage out there. But also looks like his old ass might get hurt out there if he keeps it up.
Lmao. Local feed.  Sarah “Blake Griffin just caught a body.”  RJ: “I love when Blake catches a body.”
Blake Griffin does not like the rim
BLAKE GRIFFIN
BLAKE GRIFFIN is destroying the Celtics

BLAKE GRIFFIN WOW
Oh wow Blake Griffin has legs after all :)
Blake Griffin looks 21 again
2013 Blake Griffin would've turned that into a vintage poster  For 2021 Blake that's a dangerous play lol
Every 15 seconds someone new gets called Blake Griffin by Marv Albert
"Imagine telling someone a few years ago that one day James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and Blake Griffin would all be in the same line-up... and Joe Harris would outplay them all."
that should automatically put Blake Griffin in the 60 day IL.
"I just want people to realize that Blake Griffin, even as a shade of his former self, can still go play point forward and pick your team apart fairly well."
Watching Blake Griffin is painful. He moves like Ozzy Ozborne out there
"The Nets are like the 2017 Cavs but with fucking Joe Harris instead of 95 year old Korver, Blake Griffin instead of TT, and Harden instead of Love. What in the FUCK."
"You have to love what you're seeing from Blake Griffin, short bursts of minutes and making a meaningful impact!"
"Here lies Griffin, Blake 1989-2021"
Blake Griffin is coming off their bench. This is the most talent ever put on a team .
"It's a joke about how ridiculously stacked the Nets offense is. I know you can't double three players at the same time.... And Kyrie's last name is Irving.. the defense I suggested would leave Griffin, Blake open"
Blake Griffin on skates oof
Feel like I hear this with Blake (Griffin) too.
BWAHAAHA my man you aren’t getting out of the east with your fake dynasty NBA2k casual bandwagon roster. Bucks or Philly gonna dice y’all up and what you gonna look to Blake Griffin to stop Giannis bwahahahahaahha. These fucking front runner fans I tell yeah. Just like the Clipps last year you gonna get exposed.  I’m chilling with a 2020 banner we good homie and bet on that talk about the Lakers see ya in a few hours.
"Trying it right now, right off the top of the head  Dallas: Luka; Denver: Jokic: Houston: Harden: Clippers: Blake Griffin; Lakers: LeBron; Memphis: Ja Morant; Minnesota: KAT; New Orleans: Anthony Davis; OKC: Kevin Durant; Phoenix: Devin Booker; Portland; CJ McCollum; Sacramento: DeMarcus Cousins; Spurs: Tim Duncan; Utah: Donovan Mitchell  Atlanta: Trae Young; Boston: Jayson Tatum; Brooklyn: Kyrie Irving; Charlotte: Gordon Hayward; Chicago: Derrick Rose; Cleveland: LeBron James; Detroit: Ben Gordon; Indiana: CJ Miles; Miami: LeBron James; Milwaukee: Giannis Antetokounmpo; New York: Carmelo Anthiny; Orlando: Mo Bamba; Philadelphia: Ben Simmons; Toronto: Kyle Lowry: Washington: John Wall"

"Blake Griffin and CP3 are the only reasons the Clippers are relevant. Doc is easily the most overrated coach, and pulled a ring out of relying on the first modern super team of the era.  &gt; People forget how much of a role Dic had to play to get Kawhi &amp; PG there in the first place.  Doc also played a role in both of their 3-1 losses, and for some reason, despite being a ""players' coach"" ended both eras of the Lob City and this new iteration with locker room problems."
"definately, him, Blake Griffin and Ilyasova are great at that."
I remember him doing the same thing to Blake Griffin 2 years ago in the playoffs.  Love how Khash always has Giannis’s back
"I mean, neither is Blake.  Nobody in the league is afraid of Blake Griffin."
At least there was some logic to it by hoping A 23 year old Brandon Jennings could reach another level.   Opposite of the Tobias Harris for Blake Griffin trade the Pistons made a few years later.
Do you not remember the Blake Griffin beef he had last year? https://youtu.be/K-w_nEHGmqo
At least u have Blake Griffin coming back healthy    Wait
"Not at all. I think Jokic first, then Melo.  For example, the University of Oklahoma had two really great #23s. First was Tisdale then years and years later, Blake Griffin. Retired them both.  It is not disrespectful in any way to have two players retired under the same number.   Not at all."
"Most of them should be pretty star studded. If you go through the past few years, you have:  * 2020 - Beal, Luka, Dame, Ja, and Booker * 2019 - Blake Griffin, LeBron * 2018 - Giannis, Wall, Beal, Blake Griffin, Wade, Butler, Towns, and Jokic * 2017 - PG, Butler, Wade, Playoff Rondo, Dame, Jokic, and AD * 2016 - PG, Butler, Rose, Beal, Wall, Harden, and Gobert"
"Blake Griffin might. Rondo didn’t get bought out but he took the vets minimum, showcased his skills as he won a ring with the lakers then went got a 2yr/15mil deal."
"He shot sixty against a league built to stop him, with multiple 280 pound behemoths on each roster, and multiple players in the lane at all times.  Today, he'd be going against Christian Wood, and Blake Griffin, and Chris Boucher, and company."
"I'd love to see it.  But IDK what to make of Drummonds' play during Cavs' games because wasn't he completely checked out?  Whereas when he's doing it as a Laker, he's just stupid.  Look at Blake Griffin with Detroit versus Brooklyn.  You know he was mentally checked out while playing with Detroit.  He's giving the Nets a borderline all-star for 12-15 minutes a game these days."
I still can’t believe we traded our first round pick that year (which was SGA) for fucking Blake Griffin. Holy man. Fuck you Stan Van Dummy
"Prime Blake griffin and Deandre Jordan were a wee bit better than DJJ lol. But if it means watching the Brandon Knight murder be re enacted with another player, I’m all for it"
Zion dunks and gets injured. He's a smaller prime Blake Griffin.
That was basically a baby version of Jason Smith vs Blake Griffin
I'll take blake griffin and a pair of Kyrie 7s

"Here's a few off the top of my head going into the playoffs.  Nets: Obvious favorites and the most hated team right now with KD, Harden, Kyrie, and the midseason addition of Blake Griffin.  Lakers: Can they defend the title? AD and Lebron have both been injured for significant time which caused them to drop to the 7 seed but they are back now. How healthy they are remains to be seen.  Jazz: Got the first seed in the regular season however need to prove if they're the real deal or not in the playoffs now to be taken seriously.   Knicks: Shocking turn around of a season and are now in the playoffs for the first time since 2013. Not expected to go far but exciting to watch MIP candidate Randle and the improved thibs defense.  Heat: Plagued by injuries most of the season, are now matched against the Bucks once again in the playoffs.  Clippers: Relatively quiet media presence this season after last years bust however seem to play better with veteran PG Rondo running the offense. Similar to the Jazz they have a lot to prove.   Suns: Chris Paul and the suns have been playing incredibly well and he will now ace banana boat companion Lebron James in the playoffs for the first time in their careers."
"their center rotation is nick Claxton, old Blake Griffin, and washed DAJ. I saw what fucking TT and time lord did to them. BKN has to deal with a second round matchup of Gianni's and Brook Lopez, or Bam plus miami's physicality. Then there will be Simmons plus Embiid waiting for them.  they have murderers row coming up"
"No I meant we had 6'3"" Marcus Smart guarding Blake Griffin in the post during his prime. Not a rotation, as the matchup we wanted.   He's one of the strongest guards in the league and an expert at drawing offensive fouls so trying to back him down is like walking a tightrope. If you don't put your body into him he's not moving, if you get too physical he's drawing the foul."
Blake griffin is the perfect comp to Aaron Gordon no? Obviously not present Blake
The Nets are 1-0 when Blake Griffin looks like a tomato
"If Rob Williams does that to them they should be scared of what an all star could have done.  Blake griffin is also a huge L for them, the stars will need to show up for them to outscore teams. Cause against better teams that team is a defensive mess."
Imagine being Blake Griffin and getting the chance to be surrounded by three all-nba level players and never having to take a shot. What a fucking job.
unrelated but we used to deliberately have Marcus guard Blake Griffin post ups when he was on the Clippers lol  dude is built like a wall
imagine what a dunk contest would like right now between Jabari Parker and Blake Griffin
What does Blake Griffin exactly do in that starting line up? He's not good at defense or  rebounding or setting screens or being a lob threat. He's only real strength is his passing and but that's kinda redundant with Harden Irving and Durant doing all the ball handling/ playmaking
"My turn, your turn, Kyrie’s turn. Joe Harris shoot an open 3. Blake Griffin open dunk. Uncle Jeff poster off Harden splitting the defenders. Rinse and repeat. Lol"
"Can confirm, went to a clippers game to see the lakers banners and retired jerseys. (This was around 2010-2012 when they had Blake griffin, and they didn’t block anything yet) the Blake griffin dunks were pretty good, but I still wore my laker jersey lol"
What purpose does Blake Griffin serve on the basketball court
What does Blake Griffin do on the floor
Did KD just headbutt Blake Griffin?
whoever offense on blake griffin
"The signing seemed to me like management saying to their stars “hey guys, we’re really going all in on helping you win, look!! It’s BLAKE GRIFFIN! REMEMBER HIM?!?”"
blake griffin is so unlikeable since he joined the nets
can't believe the nets were allowed to sign blake griffin to go 0-0 and 1-2 from the line while getting destroyed by tatum for a sweet -11.  it's just not fair.
Is Blake Griffin really a center now?
Blake Griffin might be worse on defense than TT
Nets are pretenders and Blake griffin is a huge pussy
Why are you jumping at a blake griffin 3 like he’s curry lol
Blake Griffin is such a bitch.
Time Lord was ready to send that Blake Griffin shot into another dimension lol
blake griffin is annoying as hell
can Blake Griffin dunk a basketball anymore?
Blake Griffin is the new JaVale Mcgee. Yikes this Nets team is stacked.
Eh.  Could be more impressive if Blake Griffin wasn't just a role player.  That being said they are still easily the title favorites.
"I really haven't followed the NBA this year. Did not realize the Nets had KD, Harden, Kyrie and Blake Griffin as starters. That is fucking insane."
Imagine telling someone 5 years ago that Blake Griffin would be the worst player in the Nets starting lineup lol.
Never thought I'd see a starting lineup where Blake Griffin is the worst player
"Nets starting lineup: Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Joe Harris and Blake Griffin  💀"
He can pull a Blake Griffin and have a resurgence.
Probably not. Their tanking but they want vets that play hard and are a good influence on the young players we also don't have the cap room (they're paying Blake Griffin on the buyout still) to take in 30 mill without sending anything out. Lastly KP's contract last a long time and he'd be hindering the team when they hope the young players are ready to play. I'm pretty sure Detroit says no to the trade in general but they'd definitely say no to it for a 2nd round pick.
Blake griffin
thats not the worst contract in the league  pistons are paying blake griffin 30 million dollars next year to win a championship on the nets
"&gt; young Blake Griffin  More like mid career Blake. Believe it or not, before Paul got there, Griffin used to get mauled all the time and was kinda stoic about it.  it's also the refs' fault. You can't reward complaining like they do. Pau, Dirk, Yao... all came to the nba behaving pretty well and ended up grunting, complaining, flopping or all of them"
"I actually respect both of their games, but Luka arguably has a worse on court attitude already.  He's like young Blake Griffin the way he complains to refs after nearly every call.  Harden's issue was looking so apathetic on defense... but he was still hated on even after he started putting in effort."
"Also to answer your question though, you guys need to stop doubling on Durant. He's too good of a playmaker and we have too many lethal shooters on our team. Shammet can get hot.. Joe Harris is the best catching shoot three-point shooter in the league, KD and Kyrie also shoot over 40 percent from 3. Also I think Uncle Jeff shot around 40% from 3 and he's due back game three. Blake Griffin has even been knocking them down."
"I agree that if KD and Kyrie play at a very high level, the Bucks probably don't win. But also Blake Griffin isn't gonna be putting up 18 and 14 a night. The strategy is to try and slow down the main 2 while also counting on the other players to not step up like they did last game. Plus if the bucks start hitting their shots more efficiently, it'll definitely be closer."
"Drive and kick, hope the shooters make more than 10% of their 3s.  And just keep pressuring the paint. If Brooklyn wants to run Blake Griffin at C and Durant at PF, pressure the paint until they have to make a switch to a better interior defender. Durant got 5 fouls last game, I wished that they kept attacking him to get him out of the game"
"the Bucks shot horribly from 3 in game 1 and Kyrie &amp; KD played damn near the whole game.  Also Blake Griffin couldn't miss, things should tip back in the Bucks favor in game 2.  As far as a general strategy, they should ruthlessly &amp; mercilessly bum hunt Kyrie on defense and see what kind of painful match-ups they can exploit there.  I would go for that, continue to pound the hell out of the offensive glass with Lopez and perhaps try deploying Giannis on KD full time to see if they can at least make things difficult for him."
"&gt;It’s not hard to find new ways to hate the Clippers when they collect trash individuals.  So do you hate CP3 and Blake as well? Because when we had them, we also got a bunch of hate.   People called CP3 dirty for his ""nut punches,"" yet did you start hating the Rockets/Thunder/Suns when they got him.  Or how about Blake ""fake tough guy"" Griffin for punching an athletic trainer in the face. Did you start hating your own team all of a sudden since the Pistons traded for him?  Because these were all the fuckin criticisms we had to hear about both of them during their time as Clippers, but now that they're gone, they're apparently A-okay?"
"I mean, they got Blake Griffin for free."
Blake Griffin Finals MVP
"Hardest to predict 😂 If harden plays Nets in 5  If harden doesn’t play Nets in 6  Clippers have a bad track record of handling individual brilliance from ball handlers/scorers  (Luka, Murray)  Luka is cold but he should NOT have been able to take them to 7   And kawhi and pg have apparently lost all their defensive ability or desire so there goes the idea that they’d make KD work. Kyrie and KD would go off and Joe Harris would kill them from 3. And what do you know Blake Griffin can actually play. Smh Hate this team so much, but yea Nets in 6 if no Harden"
I would still consider them a super team having 2 all stars with Blake griffin having a solid season coming from Detroit. Blake in himself is a good player but he fits the role well too. Not to mention good role players that are consistent. A lot of fire power on that team
"No, they got rid of some of their depth in the Harden trade, they are a dynamic duo with solid role players, despite people trying to put Blake Griffin in the MVP race when he went there , no they are not a super team"
You'll be seething when you get eliminated by an opponent that actually plays like a team and doesn't rely on one man to hard carry.   Then Kawhi and PG will opt and go to better organizations and you'll be stuck rooting for a shitty team trying to rebuild. Thats the true fear. Going back to right where you started before you even drafted Blake Griffin.
if Blake griffin is taking 9 3s on 13 shots it's kinda an indication that he's washed.
The next Blake Griffin?
"Idk why yall making this a race thing, Doc has had way better rosters than Rick. Kawhi, PG, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Embiid?"
Blake Griffin was just paying homage last night
More like   Blake Griffin randomly dropped 18/14 with good defense after averaging 5/3/2 on 55 TS% vs the Celtics. Khris Middleton had an underwhelming game and the Bucks couldn’t shoot to save their lives. Giannis hitting 33% of all Bucks threes won’t cut it either.   But Bud has to play his big guns the vast majority of the game. There is no excuse for a Kevin Durant coming back from an Achilles tear to play 5 more minutes than Giannis and Kyrie 10 more. They have got to take advantage of the games Harden misses if he misses Any more.
The Nets 6th best player is Blake Griffin
sorry “Grizzlies” does you’re pussy hurt any less now ? Trying to pretend the grizzlies and clippers are still rivals is embarrassing. Did Blake Griffin not sign you’re jersey way back when ? You hold genuine hate for an nba franchise the grizzlies haven’t been competitive with in a while this is so sad
"Also: Nets have Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan. If the Clippers play the Suns in the WCF, the franchise will have to confront Lob City to win it all."
Crazy even Blake Griffin is a better center
Reggie Jackson and Blake Griffin having strong playoff runs...  Pistons in shambles
"Not only that. Blake griffin had a great game for nets, and earlier d rose played in the Knicks series. It's like the whole of last year's pistons squad playing well rn😂😂😂"
"&gt;Bucks were literally getting open layups whenever they wanted, no resistance   Umm.. in the second half, they were contested a lot at the rim. There’s even several highlights posted on here showing KD/Claxton/Blake defensive stances inside  &gt;Bucks missing wide open shots and Bud running a pathetic offense  And they missed plenty of contested ones. You don’t choke losing 20 in a game you never really had control over to begin with. Bucks are not the first or last team to miss open shots.   Nets' offensive rating was only 112.7. KD and Kyrie only combined for 54 on 51.2% TS.  This was not some wild ceiling game for Brooklyn and while Milwaukee will shoot better, that is concerning for the Bucks. Nets weren’t perfect either and lost their most important player/playmaker.   Blake Griffin put up 14/18 on 53% shooting. Mike James put up 12/7 and the Nets don’t have Harden, Dinwiddie or Green. No excuses for the Bucks what so ever. They got washed **Period** and their defense was more suspect than the Nets  You talking about “whatever they wanted” but was losing by as much as 19 while only cutting the lead down in garbage time. More like the Nets got whatever they wanted."
"lol at choked. Nets took full control of that game from the second half on both ends. All this so called defensive issues for the Nets, yet it was the Bucks that allowed Blake fucking Griffin to light their asses on fire and Mike James. Meanwhile Nets contested shots and made use of a poor shooting performance by that team."
&gt; outlier games from their below average role players. &gt;  &gt;   Like who? Maybe Blake Griffin played better than usual but that's it.  Even without Harden the overall talent level of the two teams is similar.
"I'm not believing anyone whenever ya say somebody is washed after Batum and Blake Griffin. Yeah, they are probably gonna have bad moments, but they can for sure still contribute"
harden being hurt less than a minute into round 2.    blake griffin.
Got that Blake Griffin energy
And they cash consideration is the thrown in.  No Blake griffin was the throw in. What teams really wanted was cash considerations
"blake griffin at the 5.  bobby portis gets 18min and the team gets fucked. loses 1 in a best of 7.  ""this team is deep"""
Blake Griffin played more minutes than Giannis in the first half.
Bucks also played like shit while Blake Griffin had played his best game all season. Im happy we won but I dont think Game 1 is indicative of how the whole series will go. I think the Nets will still come out on top but it won't be easy
Blake Griffin played more minutes than Giannis in the first half
"Fine, it will be an overreaction until the Nets go up 3-0. Remember, everyone was burying the Clippers after dropping 2 at home. It is not a big deal that the Bucks lost on the road in a game where they were bricking wide open threes and getting torched by Blake Griffin and Mike James."
"It’s only one game. That said, everyone asking questions about the Nets defense need to direct those questions to the Bucks and how they let Blake Griffin tear they asses apart last night.   Some of these highlights appear as if it’s Bucks who will struggle defensively, not the Nets"
"the point you are making is pretty poor though, divac may not have the proverbial double digit accolades, but he is by far one of the most influencial euro players in history. blake griffin was pretty much good for a while and then thats it. its like saying a guy like monta ellis should be hall of fame"
"He's both, and like people have said, he's washed up because he has at least one nagging injury, likely including some degree of patella tendonitis in his knees for jumping at the highest level for a long time. One injury makes the next injury more likely, as well, and it's so hard to keep your game at the same level when you are spending time rehabilitating and constantly being pressured into playing when you're not yet 100% healthy, which he has surely done. As for his shot, because he can't jump as high, his shot is thrown off, because he is now releasing it at a lower level. Additionally, defenders come closer to blocking his shot, so he has to worry about that. Then, his confidence could be affected because he's having trouble shooting and getting his shot off, which would then make his shot even worse. Blake Griffin, this season played 31.3 MPG, had a 12.3 PPG (career-low), 36.5 FG% (2nd worst in NBA\*), 31.5 3P% (2nd worst in NBA\*), and he hadn't dunked since 2019 before he joined the Nets, which was smart of him to save his legs for a team that actually has championship ability."
"It's amazing to me that people take a bad shooting night as some kind of thing for which nothing can be done! There are entire schools of basketball (the Greek one for example) that never had good shooting and nevertheless thrived, even on bad shooting nights (even for their own shooting standards).  Here's a simple solution: the coach demands that his players stop bricking threes, especially if they are playing a team that's smaller and not particularly good at interior defense.  Otherwise, you draw plays through which your actual shooters (Middleton, Forbes) take open threes and you transfer the rest of the game in the post, either by posting your best offensive player of the night (who's also dominating the offensive boards, so your abysmal shooting doesn't hurt you THAT much), either by saying to your guards and wings to cut to the basket, not stay glued behind the three point line.  ""But Lopez is a liability on defense, he can't guard KD"". Why the hell should he guard KD, I don't even know. Let Giannis guard him. After all, Blake fucking Griffin was doing a lot of damage already by burying wide open triples. Send Lopez out, let him guard Griffin out there, Griffin is not Kyrie. And if he gets passed him, so be it. Loosing to wide open threes by Griffin and Crowder is infuriating.  Of course, none of this guarantees anything, but why not try things? It's just mind-boggling to me that the Bucks live and die by a couple of credos."
"&gt; They just played a whole game against the Bucks without Harden and won convincingly.   And a large part of that is because Griffin and  Mike James provided a lot of support to KD and Kyrie whereas Middleton and Holiday didn't to help Giannis. Will that consistently happen? I guess we will see. I'm just saying the Bucks have advantages in this series in that Brooklyn has no answer for Giannis and Lopez for that matter where as the Bucks defensively have answers for KD and Kyrie. And by answers I'm not saying they'll completely shut them down they don't need just need to stop them from dropping 35, 40+ points so other Nets players will have to step up like Griffin did. Now if this is a new resurgence of Blake Griffin and he continues to play like this well it's a different story."
"Again in a vacuum KD and Kyrie are better however in the context of this series. PJ Tucker, Middleton, Jrue, and Giannis as defenders can do enough to contain KD and Kyrie and by contain I just mean stop them from going ape shit and dropping 35, 40, etc. And that clearly happened this game. If they can keep both KD and Kyrie to 25-30 points each that's a win for them because ideally someone else on the Nets will have to step up and make shots and plays. The Nets got surprise showings from Blake Griffin and Mike James. Will that continue to happen? We will see. However the reverse is not true for the Nets. They have no one to stop Giannis or Brook Lopez for that matter. So if they can just get some decent play offensively from Middleton and Jrue they can rock the boat. I'm not making predictions on who's going to win or not, just commenting that the Bucks aren't ""easily underdogs"" in this series, there's a reason they beat them those last 2 games of the regular season where Harden ain't play."
Blake griffin is a bad influence on james harden
Blake Griffin was definitely a more electric dunker.

"thhis post is worded as if no one on here could possibly have a better gameplan lol. buds making the same exact mistakes people have called him out for for years.  &amp;#x200B;  basic improvements:   1. play your starters playoff minutes 2. If 3s arent falling, attack the paint. Giannis is one of the most dominant paint players since shaq. and hes being guarded by blake fucking griffin. plus lopez. nets dont have bigs to match  3. better rotations.  4. why the fuck are jeff teague and thanasis getting playoff minutes ?????"
Blake Griffin deserves a ring with such play.
for some teams they are. that’s pretty explicitly why detroit got blake griffin
"Giannis isn't the best in the post. He settles for too many turnaround jumpers. They need to get Giannis at the elbow, facing up before exploding to the rim.   I think Bucks need better ball movement and hit Giannis as a cutter. Giannis isolating on Blake Griffin at the top of key is needed as well since the only help defense coming from the Nets is from KD."
"I disagree. Giannis at the top of the key with the ball in his hands may not work against top defensive teams who can wall him off from the paint, but it would definitely be successful against the Nets.   Middleton and Holiday both missed open passes to Giannis when he was rolling to the basket. They need to hit those passes.   However, this isn't a series where Holiday and Middleton need to play out of their minds. If this was a series against Philly, then I understand Holiday and Middleton making more plays to keep the offense diverse and prevent defences from keying on Giannis.   Bucks can afford to keep it simple. Slow the pace down. Have Giannis isolate out top and get to the basket. Get KD and Blake Griffin in foul trouble. Stop the pull up 3s.   If Giannis is doubled, ball movement and use the handling and playmaking of Holiday and Middleton to get open shots on the perimeter or hit Giannis when cutting."
One of their role players is literally Blake griffin
bro nobody is paying blake griffin
"i got a feeling with Harden out , it wont be just one game. Blake Griffin is really good player. If he is healthy and motivated, he might just average a double double vs the Bucks."
It felt like I saw Blake Griffin on the floor more than Giannis.
"Pretty much, you have so much time to prepare for a game like this and Bucks fumble it of course, the fuck was Jeff Teague doing out there, they scored easy in the paint but you have Middleton jack up mid-range jumpshots and crappy passes and Giannis was denied driving by  Blake Griffin... Bucks have tools but if they don't use them they will lose quickly, the good thing about them is they probably will shoot better from 3pt next time but they played this game very bad game plan wise, and what was that defense Mike James lay-ups and free threes for everyone from the Nets. This game makes me doubt Budenholzer big time."
"Hard disagree.   We've heard all this talk about Bud being flexible and I think a big part of why the Bucks struggled is that they're not defending the team in front of them.   Protecting the rim doesn't matter against these Nets. Everyone wants to pull up and shoot anyway.   * When Joe Harris is coming off the DHO with the ball in his hands, Lopez shouldn't be at the rim he should be contesting the FT line jumper Harris wants to take.  * When Kyrie is in the corner, he shouldn't be left open because one of Kyrie's biggest scoring weaknesses is that he doesn't shoot enough quality 3s relative to his shooting ability. So don't encourage him to shoot more.   A lot of his misses were pull-up 3s but he's far too dangerous to let him be open off-ball.  * Yes, Blake Griffin has had a physical resurgence now he's no longer tanking his value in Detroit, but he's still old and slowed down by injuries. His continued presence in the league comes from his playmaking and newish shooting skills. Don't double him in the post and leave him wide open for 3.   The Bucks sagging off on PnRs and doubling the man in the post would work exceptionally well against Philadelphia.   The issue is they're giving up too many good looks against the Nets and Bud's one-size-fits-all approach doesn't fit the Nets.  Against Philly their defence would actually work."
"Yes, Bud knows better and, yes, Giannis plays hard. But:  1) Giannis is certainly not the only player Bud treats like that. Lopez, the best Buck on offense today, played under 30 minutes. He was the best offensive rebounder against a team that can't rebound and while his own team was bricking threes all night. And he played 28 minutes.   2) Giannis certainly does his cruising during games (see his shot contesting without jumping, rarely going for offensive boards, rarely boxes out etc)  3) He was rested before this game. If fucking Blake Griffin can play 35 minutes and hustle like that, Giannis should be able to do more.   4) If Giannis' (offensive) playstyle is too much to sustain for 40 minutes, then it's on his coach to change it. Give him easy buckets - it will not just help Giannis, it will help the team. Too much stagnant 5-out."
"I don’t think people care about pulling him early, but he only played half the second quarter when Brooklyn gained momentum. Like come on, old knees Blake griffin played 35 minutes tonight lol, Giannis can handle 42-45 minutes in your toughest series"
"Blake ""he's done"" Griffin with 18 and 14 in a playoff game, as everyone saw coming around this time last year."
Blake 'Grandpa Joe' Griffin
"There were plenty of trade rumours before the season. Teams were interested. Blake tanked his value though.   Zach Lowe:  &gt;Enough people have asked me what i’ve heard about Blake Griffin and how he’s looking. what am I hearing. This and that. That I think Detroit is going to have a market for him,” ESPN’s Zach Lowe said on a recent podcast. “I don’t think it’s going to be strong. They’re not getting two first-round picks. Or even a first round pick unless they take back something onerous too. But I’ve had enough teams ask me about Blake Griffin that I think there is still interest in what he can do to help you win.” ([source](https://sportsnaut.com/nba-rumors-blake-griffin-trade-pistons/))  Instead he’s ring chasing while we’re hit with his 40m salary for two years."
Blake griffin is gonna beat Chris Paul to get a ring and I can’t wait
Nets are sneaky deep. Even if Harden doesn't play another game I still consider them the favorite. Joe Harris and Blake Griffin could play the third wheel next to Kyrie and KD. Jeff Green coming back ..
"That would be a hard no. Neil put us in luxury tax hell in the 2016 offseason that we only got out of recently, and nobody in the FO told him it was dumb to do that. Decided us beating a Clippers team with a hurt Chris Paul and Blake Griffin was cause for paying EVERYBODY, including guys like Meyers Leonard and Allen Crabbe. Evan Turner that following offseason during free agency as well I believe. Severely hampered roster moves we were able to make for a while and put us in our current roster bind. Any ""good"" moves he's made since were only alleviating problems he himself created."
Packing the paint with... Blake Griffin and KD w/ 4 fouls. Sounds like a dream to me.
Cannot call Blake Griffin as others. That guy still good enough in scoring and still amazing defensively like his prime years and also he is one the guy in the league that can change his playstyle according to the team needs. That is definitely not others. He is a wildcard just like Howard on Lakers last year.
Cp3 vs Blake griffin finals - who wouldn't want to see that?
"As painful as it was to see Harden injured like that, this Nets team is fun as hell…I hadn’t watched a ton of Nets games before this, and it may be my bias for wanting KD to succeed, but has he actually came back from that Achilles tear better?!?! And Blake Griffin played like his damn life was on the line.  Hope y’all win it, my Dubs never stood a chance this year but all these dudes deserve a ring."
"Yeah our three of Blake Griffin, Mike James, and Joe Harris did extremely well today."
That Blake Griffin guy the Nets picked up for nothing sure didn’t play a factor
And Blake Griffin is sacrificing himself to the basketball gods.
"Blake ""Each Dunk I Lose One Year Of My Life"" Griffin"
Blake Griffin just double crossed the whole ass Pistons organization. Fifth episode is going to be a banger
"Tbf, Nets before the Harden trade didn't have Blake ""I'm a Phoenix not a"" Griffin"
"The post title should be changed to:  &gt; The Brooklyn Nets defeat the Milwaukee Bucks 115-107 behind 18 points, a career high 14 rebounds in a playoff game, 3 assists, 2 steals, and 4 of 9 from beyond the arc from Blake ""Keyser Soze"" Griffin to take a 1-0 series lead  Because Blake Griffin was the player of the game, and he tricked y'all like Keyser Soze did."
Blake “Rock Lee” Griffin
Blake Griffin drove that car from his 2011 dunk contest into the entire Antetokounnpo family

"Mike James, Blake griffin, joe Harris. Shit even Claxton had his moments drawing fouls and playing defense. Khristina Middleton showing up in his playoff form."
You telling me that Giannis can't play more than just a few seconds more than Blake Griffin lol
"This has to go down as the Blake Griffin game!   Harris, James and Brown played great but if thats how Blake is going to play the Nets aren’t going to lose 4 out of 7. I know he’s not going to give you 18p, 14r, 3a, each night but the energy a hustle was the difference.  KD and Kyrie did their thing and those guys are two of the scariest guys to go against in the playoffs.  The Nets lost Harden and didn’t seem to miss a step"
"Blake Griffin was waddling around with 50 pounds of padding wrapped around his knee and had every opposing announcer in shock about how washed he looked earlier in Detroit this season. Feels bad, man"
You really underrating Blake Griffin there.
The bucks have the size advantage but choose to brick 3s and let blake griffin look like Dennis Rodman having the game-high rebounds
Forbes was good from three the series before yea? Bucks are still clearly the more talented team with all the Nets injuries.  There just shouldn't be a world where Bucks are getting outrebounded by Blake Griffin. That seemed like an effort thing to me.
"i didn't watch too many bucks games this season but...  how are you gonna play giannis for 35m and then give bobby portis almost 18m?  forget the fact that the bucks did their best lakers round 1 impression from the 3pt line, but when you got blake griffin playing the 5, it seems like giannis should be feasting in the paint.  am i wrong here?"
Obligatory fuck Blake griffin
Nets in however long Blake Griffin wants to extend this
Blake Griffin?
It's crazy that the Bucks didn't even try to attack KD with 4 fouls and Blake Griffin at Center. Watching the Bucks taking jumpers instead of attacking the paint is so disappointing.
so blake griffin good again? or was he always good but just had couple bad seasons?
"Blake ""trick y'all"" Griffin"
"Blake ""literally the GOAT"" Griffin"
The Mike James and Blake Griffin duo made for a surprisingly solid James Harden replacement
What about Blake Griffin? Lmao I joke
"Yep, low basketball iq from the Bucks. How do you not take advantage of your size and bully Blake Griffin in the paint? Serioisly stupid stuff from the Bucks."
Imagine what this sub will look like if the Bucks somehow lose the series with Blake Griffin stepping up to average like 25 the rest of the way to help KD.
"Missing max level players absolutely matters. It'd be a different story if  Harden and Kyrie were somehow replaced by like John Wall and De'Aron Fox, but it's Nets 8 and 9th men off the bench replacing a lot of those minutes. Joe Harris and Blake Griffin need to have outstanding games, cos otherwise KD and the Nets are outgunned."
"Tbh yo, I was at the LCA in Blake’s return. We were all hella cordial, gave him a standing ovation, played a video tribute, applauded him everytime he got the ball. But when he got Beef ejected, fought with Bey, threw down the lob and chirped at the bench &amp; coaching staff, and picked a fight with literally everyone on the team other than Sekou, he was booed everytime he got the ball. In fact the arena was cheering “fuck Blake Griffin” lol. He’s def not that liked here as you make it seem, he’ll be booed on all his return games"
Yeah or Blake griffin
He won with two not a bunch and if they didn’t win those rings with Isiah they might not be. Stockton had Malone and Chris Paul had Blake Griffin and James Harden and a bunch of other all-stars and just made his first conference final 3 years ago.
"I mean if he shoots like 4-25 and Middleton lights him up on the other end, I'd maybe lose a bit of respect. The players who actually have something at stake in this Nets series if Harden/Kyrie don't return are Joe Harris and Blake Griffin. They need to step up and show they're able to at least somewhat keep up offensively with the Bucks big 3. Like Joe Harris was a starter for Team USA and has been the #2/3 option for the Nets in the past. This is his time to show up."
KD and Blake Griffin are gonna have to make miracles happen.
Blake Griffin changed the Clippers franchise forever and I will always respect him for that
"Clippers have CP3, DJ, Blake Griffin, Lue, and Gallinari out there too. (In addition to our team now, of course)"
"Very true these bucks are probably better than what lebron faced but keep in mind in that last run with Cleveland he took on all comers singlehandedly including Boston in 7. That was a solid boston team and lebron lacked any elite players, he had a washed kevin loce that you could equate to blake griffin on todays nets, definitely no elite perimeter shooter like joe harris"
Blake Griffin but it fucked up his career
Betting on Blake Griffin in street clothes too.
"Big Three: KD, the Ghost of Blake Griffin, Shamet"
"You don’t understand. He isn’t putting 30 a game on Blake Griffin, you’re citing series stats. Even the basic matchup data on the nba site isn’t necessarily that useful here, but you didn’t even bother to cite that.   You also conveniently left out efficiency but included some meaningless 3 assist number.   Instead of whining about “this sub”, you could just do better. To cite just his series stats is ridiculous."
"How should this nets team be good enough, if you neutralize giannis and KD the bucks have the 2 next best players in the series. Unless you mean to tell me Joe Harris and Blake griffin is comparable to Khriss Middleton and Jrue Holiday."
You do realize that it’s 3-4 people collapsing on Giannis. It’s not Giannis vs Blake Griffin one on one in the paint
Blake Griffin doing a good job tbh
"Yeah that's fair enough but if you can enjoy an artwork by googling a high quality digital photo of it, then it's no different to me googling Blake Griffin dunking on Brandon Knight even if someone else owns the NFT of the clip. The 'original' highlight l has even more abstract value than an original artwork.  I guess it's different for sculptures and stuff tho"
Giannis is struggling with Blake Griffin I wouldn’t be too scared if I were you
Are you talking about blake griffin back when he was playing for the clippers?
Lmaoo are you saying kds team now is even worse than that 2015 team?? They are better offensively if anything having shooter like Joe Harris and a revamped Blake Griffin are decent complementary pieces plus they aren’t going up against the warriors from 2015 either
My pushback to that is the role players on the Nets are still pretty good. Joe Harris is probably one of the most desired role players in the whole league for example. Blake Griffin still has that all-star upside.
"time for the Big 3 to step it up   KD, Blake Griffin, and Joe Harris"
"KD hasn’t been drawing the fouls tbh, the defense has been fine, you put Harden in his spot yesterday and if the bucks play him like that he’s shooting 20 FTs lol.   Bucks don’t have to worry about anyone their next highest scorer was Kyrie with 11 and after that Joe Harris,  Blake Griffin and Jeff Green with 8 each lol.   Also KD can’t really facilitate and get his teammates good looks. Nets’s best bet here IMO is going to be getting Blake Griffin to channel his 2018 self and play point lmao."
"&gt; Remember years ago when they publicly stated that egregious flopping would be fined  Blake called that out as phony from Day 1:   [Blake Griffin: Flopping rule is just a money grab](https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--blake-griffin--nba-s-new-flopping-rule-is-just-a-money-grab.html)  &gt; ""It's not going to win or lose games for anybody. It's a good way for the NBA to get more money,"" Los Angeles Clippers forward Blake Griffin said.   &gt; ... ""But now you're telling me if it's Game 7 of the NBA Finals and a guy has a chance to make a play he's going to be like, 'Well, do I want this $10,000 or do I want a championship?'"""
"&gt;you literally said lead the league in assists...is that not raw assists...  Are assists not a valuable stat anymore? It's not the whole argument, it's part of it.  &gt;you mentioned shooting splits which is also a super raw stat...(a more telling stat would be like PER, VORP, offesnive rating, net rating, ws/48)  Look at efficiency in literally any way you feel like, Nash always has a big advantage. FG%, 2P%, 3P%, eFG%, TS%. If you're trying to somehow argue efficiency isn't important, I have nothing more to say to you. I even threw some ""advanced stats"" there so that maybe they'll matter to you.  &gt;i'm not being a dick, i'm just saying your argument doesn't make any sense when every ""advanced"" stat puts CP3 higher.  So CP3 is also better than Kobe, right? Because that's what all of those stats imply. Better VORP, WS/48, OWS, OBPM, DBPM, BPM. Kobe is obviously worse than CP3 because all he has over him is phony counting stats, and lame accolades like an MVP or 2 scoring titles, right? I'm not even confident you could tell me what all of these stats mean without looking it up. The game is not played on a spreadsheet.  &gt;you can even compare their overlapping years like 05/06 to like '10 and see during that time CP3 had much better stats with worse teams (nash played with some pretty talented teams, not sure where you're getting this story that nash played with worse teams)  Nash's best teammates in his prime were Stoudemire (likely his best teammate), Shawn Marion, and guys like Barbosa, Bell, and Diaw. His late career was unfortunately hampered by injuries.   CP peaked early on the Hornets, yes, but he still had tons of prime years alongside prime Blake Griffin, DJ when he was actually good, James Harden, and David West. The Clippers and Rockets teams were both catered super well to his strengths, and he overall had better teammates than Nash.  Stoudemire was around as good as BG; Marion was good but not as good; DJ, Harden, and West were all better than Barbosa, Bell, or Diaw. Obviously Harden is also better than any teammate Nash has ever had."
"I can  Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, Landry Shamet, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Jeff Green etc"
"Yeah the supporting cast is absolutely horrific. Nets also lose the ability now to stagger Kryie and KD so now when KD is off the floor the Bucks will just feast. The Nets are built so top heavy, and now they're going to have to hope for big performances from Blake Griffin and Jeff Green to win lol and then also hope that Tyler Johnson and Mike James can score so yeah it's a pretty bad recipe for winning when you have minimal depth"
"Game 3 was the worst shooting performance the nets could possibly have and the Bucks barely beat them. I've watched all the games, the Bucks have looked horrible, like there's no rhyme or reason to their offense. Game 4 was better but ehhh...      They looked like world beaters vs the heat so it's super weird seeing Blake Griffin giving Giannis trouble"
"Which Rockets team are you talking about specifically?  The 2016-17 team was basically comprised of Harden-Pat Beverley-Trevor Ariza-Ryan Anderson-Clint Capela-Eric Gordon as its main rotation.   I don’t think a lineup of KD-Joe Harris-Bruce Brown-Blake Griffin-Nick Claxton any less talented.  Citing their PPG during a season in which they played with three guys that averaged 25+ doesn’t make much sense because of course their scoring burden was lessened. I’m talking talent and tools.  Claxton is in his second season to Clint’s third at the time, Joe Harris is the best shooter on either team, Blake’s passing out of the short role would have been huge for that Rockets team (as would Jeff Green’s ability to attack the rim or dish to shooters)."
"You wrote up a great explanation of why Giannis shouldn't put at center for 36-40 against Embiid and the Sixers. Problem is, they are playing the Nets and he's already guarding the biggest, most physical player on the opposing team.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ1xUsMet30  Pay close attention to who is on the floor for the Nets and who Giannis is matching up with. I'll let you in on a little secret: it's Blake Griffin. Brook Lopez is guarding Bruce Brown. They take Lopez out and Giannis is still guarding Griffin. Only when Giannis goes out does Lopez take that assignment. During that run with Giannis at center, he is also guarding Griffin.  The role change you are talking about is way more theoretical than actual. Gotta adjust the theory to the situation, you know?"
Hahahahaha what da fuck. One series didn’t make a player. Middleton and jrue are so much better than joe Harris and Blake griffin
"In what world is Joe harris, Jeff Green, and old Blake Griffin better than Middleton and Holiday?"
"I agree that the remaining games will be far more informative than was the part of Game 4 sans Kyrie.    That said, KD has Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green, Shamet, and probably one or two others that I'm forgetting (in addition to Mike James).  That's an infinitely better supporting offensive cast than what Curry had this season.    Wiggins TS% the year before he was traded was *sub-50*.  And he was their 2nd leading scorer this year.  You also had Stone Hands Wiseman &amp; Draymond making Ben Wallace seem like Hakeem.    We also have one good data point from Game 3 of the 2019 Finals, when Curry didn't have Klay or KD and he hung 47 on an all-time defense.    KD doesn't have to win another game, but he does need to show that he can be an unstoppable offensive force even without another superstar."
he needs to be dominating the ball with harden and kyrie out. of course its predictable. the next best player is... blake griffin? joe harris?
Does he think 13 million isnt recoverable for 32 year old Blake Griffin?  Also I think thats a small price to pay to not be in Detroit.
Bro they literally got Blake Griffin coming off the bench
he forgot no one uses the Verge anymore. Blake Griffin is on the MKBHD of losing in the second round is what I think he meant
He has the re-animated cadaver of Blake Griffin as his #2.
"Yeah, they were MUCH more talented with Kyrie also in the lineup. Houston never had a shooter near the caliber of Joe Harris. Jeff Green is the perfect small ball center for what the Rockets want to do, as evidenced by his play there last season. Claxton has played very much like a young Capela. Hell, even Blake Griffin is a secondary playmaker out of the front court that the Rockets haven’t had since Josh Smith.  I would at the very least compare it to the 2016-17 Rockets team, which went six against a 60-win team without anyone the caliber of Kyrie playing second fiddle for the two wins."
"""Ahhmmm guys, you now that  Im still here, right?"" -- Blake Griffin"
"KD has carried worst teams against better opponents?  He has always had an MVP next to him in all of his past playoff series except for 2 i think due to Russ having an injury, and they lost to Grizzlies one year and beat Houston one year that started players like Omer Asik, Chandler Parsons and Francisco Garcia with a 2013 James Harden.   If KD can win this series against Milwaukee without Kyrie and James harden this could arguably be his crowning achievement.  No ring is involved with winning this series, but carrying guys like Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, Blake Griffin, Mike James etc is way more then he had to do in the past."
"Hell No !! The Nets team is pretty well constructed even without Kyrie and Harden. Joe Harris is a legit - might’ve made the all-star team in another universe. Blake Griffin is playing like it’s 2017. Mike James, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, all solid players. This Nets team is atleast better than a few of the James Cavaliers that ran through the East Post Kyrie."
🤣🤣🤣  Joe 1-11 Harris  Blake 6 ppg Griffin
"idk man. No one can beat a fully healthy Nets team. This is the basketball gods’ way of making this year’s chip fair, by telling KD, Kyrie, Harden, and Blake Griffin that they cannot buy championships.     Appreciate what’s been laid out before everyone still left in the playoffs. Injuries are a part of the game. There is no such thing as an asterisk because of injuries."
"Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, and Joe Harris is a serious playoff core. The rest of their rotation isn't that bad as constructed. KD and Blake are both great playmakers."
PG Kevin durant  SG joe Harris  SG Landry Shamet  SG TLC C Jeff green  Second rotation PG Tyler Johnson SG TLC SG Kevin durant  SF Blake griffin C deandre Jordan
"Except this time, it’s not even much of a wall. Yea, sometimes you get two defenders in giannis’ way but a lot of this series, it’s just been Blake griffin on his lonesome stopping a barreling giannis. Giannis really has to find a reliable way to score over defenders simply just standing in his way under the paint"
Lol. Getting clamped by Blake Griffin. Foh dawg
Blake griffin is clearly the one calling
"‘Super team narrative can stop now.’   Mate you have those 3, Blake griffin who is playing really well, you had lamarcus before he had to retire and you have a 50% 3 point shooter."
Clippers: Pg: Chris Paul Sg: JJ Reddick SF: Paul Pierce PF: Blake Griffin C: DeAndre Jordan 6th man: Jamal Crawford
"First 3 games this series. You mean with Kyrie, Harris and Blake Griffin?  Not MVP level, but he’s not trotting out there with only scrubs like we’ve seen some players do."
"Cam Payne.  Luke kennard. Saric.  Grayson Allen.    Campazzo. Austin rivers.   I haven't watched much eastern ball but maybe bruce brown, shamet, blake Griffin"
"Maybe it’s just the clippers connection? People liked him on the hornets, rockets, and thunder  Honestly I despise Blake Griffin for some reason again this year, I was so happy they kept panning to him on the bench while his team was getting destroyed."
The fact that Brooklyn with Blake griffin and claxton as the main forces are defending Giannis solidly makes me really not like their chances against Philly.   Dwight is gonna foul the fuck out of him and Giannis is just gonna throw more running elbows. He’s gonna be in foul trouble the whole series.   The bucks are also just playing kinda weird against Brooklyn so maybe they’ll revert back to having a real offense consistently and will get it done but Idk.
"A buyout probably wouldn't have happened if Blake Griffin played like he has with Brooklyn, and the difference is clearly effort.  I get that some players are gonna struggle to be motivated on a tanking team. Fine - I don't like it, but I get it. But there's that and then there's sandbagging so that your team will pay out $40 million so that you can go and sign for the most ludicrously stacked team in the league on a vet minimum and be their new starting centre."
"Our team this year would be pretty insane with a prime Rondo and prime Boogie, but I'll go with 2012-13 Clippers.  PG - CP3/Bledsoe  SG - Billups/Jamal Crawford  SF - Matt Barnes/Grant Hill/Caron Butler  PF - Blake Griffin/Lamar Odom  C - DeAndre Jordan"
"If Giannis isnt having a fun time with Blake Griffin guarding him, just wait until he gets ben simmons on him with joel waiting for him. Going to be a scary sight for a playoff choker like giannis"
"AG with the role he played for the Nuggs when healthy was not overrated at all. He's only overrated if you think he is the second coming of prime Blake Griffin, even after all of these years of that clearly not being the case. AG is a role player, who was once again asked to step out of his comfort zone. This time because Nuggs were injury riddled and he was the like 2nd most dangerous guy on offense some nights.   Grant never had to deal with that since Murray and Barton always played along side him."
"Embiid is easily better, Giannis is closer to Kyrie than he is Embiid.  Nets have Blake Griffin defending Giannis and y’all act like him putting 30-12 in below average efficiency is impressive."
"Then suddenly becomes good again, ala Blake Griffin"
suns fan here. I used to hate him and blake griffin a lot
That's the Blake Griffin effect
This is a Blake Griffin highlight
Unless Joe Harris goes full Khris Middleton and Blake Griffin goes back to prime form
2018 Blake Griffin
"Steve Nash gotta start calling Blake Griffin on his ""non-basketball moves"" if he likes that phrase so much"
They’re potentially losing Blake Griffin and Jeff Green though who have been great in that role so probably a net even there
"I don't think it will happen. That being said, it's definitely *possible*. Giannis goes 1-22 from three, Joe Harris remembers how to shoot, Blake Griffin finishes with 19/12/11 and 3 wildly celebrated rim grazing ""dunks"", etc."
It’s because Giannis’ game looks like shit most of the time so even when he is effective it doesn’t look as impressive as kd. Giannis truthfully just barges in the paint and hopes for the best. It’s effective but good lord.   Also kd had that amazing fourth quarter last game while the fourth quarter is middleton time for the bucks.   Also it kinda feels like giannis could and should be doing more. He’s letting Blake griffin and claxton give him problems at times. Kd is dealing with elite defenders all night while the nets don’t have a single guy who should be able to do anything to Giannis.
"“fearful” but kd, irving and harden w a blake griffin playing possum didn’t make anyone’s spidey sense tingle?"
"The nets had no success. but it’s not like they had kyrie, harden, and Blake griffin prior to him joining."
Blake Griffin had a lot of horrible nickname ideas early in his career. *High Griffinition* and *Earthblake* come to mind.
"&gt; The big three Boston Celtics   He beat them in 2011 and 2012 when he had both Wade and Bosh... I think they're a little better than Joe Harris and 2021 Blake Griffin,   &gt; You're showing your age  Way to contradict yourself lol"
Yea Giannis ain’t a dirty player this was just unfortunate but if you want a dirty player his name is blake griffin
He is obviously turning a blind eye to Blake Griffin.
You’re literally a Redditor.   Explain to me how Kevin Durant should be expected to win 2 games against a bucks team that can devote 2 out of their 4 all nba level defenders to him when his second best player is Mike James or old Blake griffin
"How can he prove himself when he has a skeleton team around him? The Nets traded away all their assets for Harden.  Joe Harris is probably their best starter, elite 3pt shooter, not a black hole on defense. Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are decent, but average for a starter. Deandre Jordan is just ok, efficient offensively, and catches lobs but he's easily exploited on defense. Everyone else is below average or terrible.  Bruce Brown is actually decent offensively, but as a PG he's pretty shit, can't facilitate worth a damn despite playing significant minutes. Mike James is a much better facilitator as a PG, average 3pt shooter, but absolutely trash in the paint, not a threat running to the rim so defenders just guard him at the key. Claxton is too inexperienced and has no idea what's going on half the time. TLC been trash at the perimeter this season, isn't great on either end of the floor. Shamet is a good volume 3pt shooter, isn't great at the rim, shit defense, a decent player off the bench actually but not starting caliber on any team. Chiozza is like 5'9, can't shoot, gets shit on in the paint, but is a good facilitator.  With KD, Kyrie, and Harden, this is an blowout championship team, with KD and either Kyrie or Harden, this is a legitimate contender. With just KD, this is a play-in team at best lol. Wayyy too top heavy to be able to afford 2 of their 3 stars out."
"He lost against the Magic, won against a much worse 2012 Celtics team and an out of prime 2007 Pistons team with Ben Wallace having left the squad. Aside from the Magic, this Bucks team is better than all the other ones you mentioned  Edit: also the rosters LeBron had were elite defensively. Sure not a lot of recognizable names, but not a garbage roster either. The nets’ current 3rd best player might be a washed up Blake Griffin ."
"Sorry you can't be victims this time buddy, no one with a brain thinks PJ Tucker was playing ""non-basketball physical"" and Blake Griffin wasn't lmao"
It's hard to put into words how much that team fits Blake Griffin
"PJ Tucker playing physical defense on Kevin Durant: ""THATS NOT BASKETBALL""  Kevin Durant foul baiting all game, even though Nash criticized Trae for doing that: ""Good""  Joe Harris elbows Connaughton so hard he starts bleeding, no foul call: ""Good""  Blake Griffin shoving Giannis mid-air, not even going for or near the ball: ""Good""  Steve Nash really ruining the fact that I thought he was a cool dude. Hawks/Trae Young fans must feel so vindicated rn"
"Blake Griffin really just shove Giannis mid-air and clearly wasn't even going for the ball and they didn't call a foul  Sick of this grifter getting away with murder on the basketball court because he's a ""physical"", ""scrappy"" player. Never forget that 90% of his ""cool posters"" are offensive fouls that went uncalled"
"You know what did look like a dirty play, though? Blake Griffin literally shoving Giannis mid-air nowhere near a basketball play and not getting called for it"
"Injures are apart of Basketball but When you build a team like that with KD, Kyrie, Harden, Blake Griffin and have a HOF coach like Steve Nash your supposed to do nothing but Win Games and Championships no excuses."
"Ah yes, Giannis is the same level of half court scorer as Shaquille O’Neal. Great take LMAO. Giannis’ problem is not only that he can’t hit a jumper, it’s that he apparently doesn’t even know how to score on Blake Griffin despite massive physical advantages."
"They have Blake Griffin too, but I guess that won’t matter if Nash just doesn’t play him like he did in the second half today."
Everyday Blake Griffin losing a game getting bodied i smile           :)
Everyday Blake Griffin losing a game getting bodied i smile           :)
To be fair they beat a lifeless heat team and KD + Blake Griffin they didn't have a hard road and it will be especially bad if they get like swept against the Sixers.
I love when players who go to teams only to get a ring don't get rings. Lookin at you Blake Griffin.
Lmfao  Blake Griffin HAHAHAHAHAHA
Blake Griffin is as close as someone can be to being cross-eyed without actually being cross-eyed
Is Blake griffin not a star anymore???
What happened to world beater Blake Griffin why isn’t he carrying the load
"I can’t hear the sound, why isn’t Blake griffin playing?"
"Blake ""Hardest Road"" Griffin"
Blake griffin pretending to be injured so he can look up if he gets cut now if a contender can pick him up mid playoffs.
"Blake Griffin hasn't even been in the game since middle of last quarter, what even is your comment?  Weird timing."
Blake Griffin over both
Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan were adults who cared about improving. Simmons is basically a lazy high schooler.
Also the story of anonymous Celtic telling Blake Griffin *not* to come to Boston before he signed with the Nets  Blake doesn't follow many Celtics players on social media but Kemba was one of them and we know Kemba wanted out
"Kemba is definitely talking to media too, who do you think leaked the Blake Griffin story yesterday?  This happens all the time, it's not unique to Boston even though the Boston sports media is terrible. Nearly every large market is like this in every major sport."
"Well, how about in the playoff series the lack of adjustments, or failure to take advantage of your strengths over the opponent's weaknesses.  For one, Brook Lopez is a great post scorer, he has been his entire career. The Nets, throughout the series, were guarding him with either Kevin Durant, Jeff Green or Blake Griffin (Occasionally with Claxton), these players should all be food for Brook Lopez inside. To that point, if you go back and look through the games, Brook scored a lot of points whenever he caught the ball in the paint (Except very late in game  7). Why did Bud not set up some plays to take advantage of this size mismatch in the post to draw fouls &amp; score points, especially when the 3 point shooting was failing in games 1 &amp; 2?(Lopez had a great game in the paint, but none of it was from designed play)"
Wasn't Blake Griffin with her? That curse is blood. Don't fall for that thirst trap.
Well what about Clark son and Blake griffin they balled out too
"Hah, I mean, Is he even good at managing superstar egos anymore? The way some of his players on LAC and PHI act on the court wasn't exemplary of this. The emotional and sometimes ridiculous actions/reactions by Blake Griffin, CP3, Joel Embiid and Dwight Howard all come to mind."
Doc wishes he had old age Blake Griffin instead of Simmons.
Blake Griffin
My highest hope is dead. We can no longer burn r/nba to the ground with a Blake Griffin fmvp.
"This is why Blake Griffin called the cops, the Rockets were just parading CP all through Staples."
"I guess the hope should be Doc developing Simmons into a more well rounded player? Like he did with Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan? But man idk, his situation looks bleak."
simmons for bruce brown and blake griffin
"Harden played four games and averaged 10/5/6 on 49% TS, what games were you watching? Blake was KD's biggest contributor after Kyrie went down and he averaged 12/7/1. Middleton averaged 24/8/4 and Jrue provided great defense all series long, which is way more than Harden and Griffin did."
"I think it's a fairly simple if not a difficult task. They have to resign Conley and pick up a league average small ball 5 when teams play Gobert off the court. Someone like a PJ tucker, Jeff Green, Blake Griffin,  or Batum type player who could come in for spot minutes.  Their best bets:  * Resign Conley * Let Niang walk * Sign some kind of small ball 5  Losing Conley is going to set them way back because there is no other PG with his skill who's gonna sign with them.   I know Gobert is an elite 5, but Snyder has to come to his senses and adjust down when need be."
"Against a 6’9” dead knees 32 year old Blake Griffin lmao, not really comparable to PJ Tucker and Jrue Holiday while being the only source of offense. Giannis was great in the series but did basically nothing in the clutch, that was all Middleton and Jrue."
"So Sean Marks shouldn't have been close?   Traded for James Harden, Bruce Brown and Landry Shamet. Extended Joe Harris. Signed Jeff Green. Added Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge in the buyout market. Put together the most stacked coaching staff of all time in Steve Nash, Mike D'Antoni and Jacque Vaughn.  But your saying that Jones adding Chris Paul and Jae Crowder to the roster is such an incredible feat, that despite every roster move the Nets made, ""no one should've been close"" to what Jones did?"
"Lol he was physical one game but there were a number of phantom fouls, so it more than evens out.  I wouldn't expect you to understand that though considering you think Blake Griffin is like Marcus Smart."
"Tyler Johnson  Maybe Blake Griffin  Wait a second, Steph Curry"
"You ever notice how every time this conversation happens it’s always Elfrid Payton specifically that comes up, and never any other random scrub?  But hey, if we want to talk about Elfrid Payton and his consecutive triple doubles, let’s do it. It’s a lot. More than LeBron’s ever had. More than Harden. More than Giannis. More than Jokic. Or maybe you want to talk about his career total of 17, which is also a lot. More than Chris Paul. Or Kevin Durant. Or Jimmy Butler. Or Blake Griffin. Or Steph Curry. Or Trae Young.  Maybe it’s an Elfrid Payton thing and not a stat inflation thing. Not possible…"
did LeBron bring in Blake Griffin and LMA?
"What? Joe Harris never made an All-Star game, Blake Griffin is far removed from his prime (not the case for Holiday and Middleton) and James Harden is playing on one leg.  Yall just hate KD so much that you can't even put into perspective that he was playing 1 on 5, Harden could barely move and Griffin is a role player."
No talent scrub who got juiced. A complete lack of fundamentals. Offensive to the game. His athleticism will fade and he'll be Blake Griffin at best.
"Nobody believes the Bucks are legit? Hmm, interesting. Well for starters, the Bucks lost a starter, and still managed to come back from 0-2 to a team with 2 superstars to their 1, and a former star in Blake Griffin. You can only flop yourself to the line so many times. They came up 4 flops short."
Lol with people freaking out over every little Blake griffin dunk this year I’m surprised nobody’s head exploded when this happened
"I actually made a typo lol. Kevin Durant had FOUR all-stars on his team (James Harden, Blake Griffin, Kyrie Irving, and DeAndre Jordan)."
Crazy how BLake Griffin averaged 12 PPG was their second leading scorer.       KD put up 35/11/5/2/1 and averaged 45 in the last 3 games.         A Lebron like carry job
You know the nephew just got destroyed by facts and logic when he’s such a soft bitch that he has no response to the topic at hand at all so he attacks the flair like a 9 year old. Lmaooooo   By the way how did it feel to get absolutely buttfucked by Brooklyn in the playoffs this year of all teams? Remember when you fleeced them in one of the most lopsided trades in league history only for your garbage franchise to fuck off all of that up leading to Kyrie leaving…. to Brooklyn lmaooooo.  Thereby making them a significantly better team than the .500 fraud ass Celtics just a few years after that trade.  And did I mention that it’s such a shitshow down in Boston that one of the player ON THE CELTICS told Blake Griffin to steer clear of that shithole franchise only for Blake to go sign with….. you guessed it: Fucking Brooklyn LMAOOOOO.   Most overrated franchise in sports history with the most racist shithead fans in sports history. Bill Russell is the biggest legend in franchise history and hates your fans and the only ring you have since the 80s was a gift from Kevin Mchale in the form of trading KG back to his old franchise for a bunch of bullshit.    By the way Tom Thibodeau essentially kicked the door in in NY this year and schemed a rag tag group of cast-offs with the lowest payroll in basketball to a better record than the supposed-to-be contenders over there in Boston. Let that sink in lol. Daddy Thibs is worth more than your whole organization combined right now.
"Fire him, joe Harris was struggling mighty you bench him simple, Brooklyn has a good bench but he decided to burn his starters, harden didn’t give you much and you play him 50 min?? Blake griffin never known for his defense guarding the 2 time MVP for the whole series, No adjustments from Nash he was scared to make a coach decision and bench harden and Harris since they were not producing and not playing good defense"
Prime Bron would have swept this Bucks team with Blake Griffin as his 2nd best player? What the fuck are you smoking lmao. The Nets had no answer for Giannis and were getting slaughtered on the boards.
How is it not a Super team with two MVPs. 6 time all star Blake Griffin. Best 3 point shooter in the NBA Joe Harris. Just because Kyrie Irving wasn't playing in games 4 5 and 6.
"Khris Middleton is a two time all star, and neither appearance was this year.  Holiday made one All Star game in 2012.   Blake Griffin started for the Nets last night and he has double their total appearances combined."
Fuck Blake Griffin
yeah it will. we didn't hear shit about Blake Griffin until he went to the nets.
"I totally get what you’re saying —  nobody gets THAT good at *anything* without working at it.   Free throws aren’t that hard to get under control. I’m an old white dude and I could hit around 60% without practicing. I understand the geometry’s different when you’re 6’10” — and you’re using different balls on different goals with different air pressure, temperatures, and humidity levels with varying levels of rest — but MAN. 32.8% is historically BAD.   As far as the shot goes, if Blake Griffin can develop one, Ben Simmons can.   There’s one of two things going on with him: either he’s simply *not interested* in working on developing a free throw routine, or he’s developed some form of the yips (like Markelle Fultz)."
"Blake Griffin, Kevin Love and now Kemba too.  It's weird how some guys can be injury-prone without any underlying connection.   Hayward was pretty healthy all throughout his career but coming back from the big injury he couldn't go 2 months without breaking his hand or rolling his ankle or getting concussed."
"another ignorant take - Blake Griffin isn't 'washed'.  His contract made him un-tradable, the Pistons wanted to free up more playing time for their young players since they weren't going anwhere (cough tanking cough), so they came to an agreement to let him go.  He was very solid yesterday - maybe he isn't a true #1 guy on a team any longer, but he can absolutely still be a major contributor on a good team."
"Your roster wasn't paper thin though? Blake Griffin was great for you guys, Jeff Green was solid and had that huge game, Bruce Brown was solid, you guys would've had Dinwiddie if he hadn't gotten a season-ending injury at the start of the year, Aldridge retired midseason, Joe Harris randomly forgot how to shoot, Landry Shamet's a quality bench player.  You guys just got unlucky, I really don't think the answer was keeping additional bench players instead of Harden."
Yep and they relied on a Blake Griffin or Bruce Brown put-back way too much.
"Indeed its amazing, but that just make KD more of a hell of a player since he carried them. NOT saying he didnt had help (jeff green, blake Griffin) but i wouldnt say the same for Harris or even Bruce brown they were horrible at key moments"
honestly blake griffin is the most insufferable guy on that team.
Those takes also didn't account for the nets adding James Harden and Blake Griffin. Actually since the beginning of the season they've arguably gotten healthier. They started with KI and KD still recovering and they added Blake and Harden during the season. Harden wasn't 100% this series but he played so they did have 3 stars on the floor. Also people still very much thought the nets had this series in the bag after game 5
"That's fair, but they came in a more conventional way, unlike Harden who blew up his own team because he didn't want to play there, and Blake Griffin who faked being washed until he got out of Detroit and magically became talented again. (Batum did the same damn thing, it's disgusting)"
Lol kd was awesome this series. There’s only so much he can do when your second best option in the series after kyrie went down was old Blake griffin
"&gt;To add on, here are the same stats for the players who just missed the cut:  &amp;#x200B;  |Player|PPG|RPG|APG|SPG|BPG|TS%|TPG|\# of Game 7s played|Record in Game 7s| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Jamal Murray|24.3|4.3|4.5|0.5|0.0|52.02%|2.3|4|3-1| |Draymond Green|19.3|11.0|5.3|1.5|1.3|66.79%|3.0|4|2-2| |Blake Griffin|20.0|8.8|5.0|1.0|1.2|56.74%|3.0|5|3-2| |Terry Rozier|10.0|4.7|3.7|1.0|0.7|47.89%|0.7|3|2-1|  Why were these players removed from the list?   Is the sample size too small?"
Agreed it was bad. But I thought we got all the calls a couple times too. Part of home court for the nets tonight.   Still got the W. Fuck Super teams and fuck Blake Griffin.
Fuck Blake Griffin

"On the other hand if you watch how he gets fouled by dirty players (Blake Griffin/Miami Heat for example), it is WWE for him out there, just as Jordan had to toughen up to beat the Pistons."
"Hey police this is Blake Griffin, Chris Paul tryna get in the locker room. Get down here, save me"
Why would it have made sense for anyone for Blake to sign here?   We weren’t Blake Griffin away from being a contender. Our team is super young and still pretty raw. Development was harmed a bit more because of all the extra limitations on the work young guys need to get to the NBA level. Who gains from him coming here for half a season besides other teams that don’t have to see him on the Knicks?
"How was that a bad call? I'd take Jrue iso against an aging Blake Griffin, especially after he's already hit 2 shots in the last minute or so and has his confidence. Sometimes defenders just make a good play. I see nothing wrong with letting that play out at all."
Guarded by washed Blake Griffin. Anything below 30 pt is bad game in this matchup
Nets dont have great supporting cast lmao. Disrescpect to Nets is insane Bucks is goddamn lucky cause they didnt deserve shit. Shooting 3s and getting scared corpse of Blake Griffin who cant move lateral
I can see him following the same road as Blake griffin in skill development
Blake Griffin obviously duh
"Green was injured for the first 3 games, went nuclear in game 5, shot badly in game 6 and game 7 didnt have a point let alone a shot.  However yes Blake Griffin and Bruce Brown were very solid. Bruce Brown although he made that horrid play in game 3 looks like he could be a great role player, especially if he develops a 3 point shot."
Blake Griffin can't lead a team but when he's sharing the court with multiple MVPs it basically turns the clock back 10 years for him
"One of these things is not like the other. Why do people keep putting washed Blake Griffin in the same category as KD, Harden, Kyrie?"
"Dawg they had Kyrie, Harden, KD, and Blake Griffin on their roster and you’re claiming the loss of the series on some role player"
Blake Griffin is probably the fakest tough guy in the league
&gt;Nets are most stacked team maybe ever bro  Nets without healthy Harden and Kyrie are barely a playoff team. Their second best player was a washed Blake Griffin.
Fuck Blake Griffin
"Blake Griffin is funny off the court, but Harden esque on it"
"Blake Griffin went from trash to ""He has Blake Griffin!""."
"Harden couldn't drive to the basket and run for shit.    Blake Griffin has an above average game so I won't blame him for the loss.    But yes Joe Harris is straight up bum!    KD can certainly carry a team.    Think of LeBron doing all he can to win 2018 Finals game 1, only for his dumbass teammate Jr Smith to choke!"
"Harden was on the court. What about Blake Griffin, ""I ain't washed now, am I?"" What about mr. 3 point sniper Joe Harris. I thought the Nets were STACKED. scary hours. What happened?"
"Throughout the entire series they had three of KD, Blake Griffin, Kyrie and James Harden playing at all times.    How is that not a superteam"
Every Piston in the playoffs not named Blake Griffin.
"I’m glad to see Blake Griffin not get rewarded for possibly the thirstiest ring chase of all time. Dude pretty obviously quit on a team paying him 34 million a year and then made them pay him to go to Brooklyn where he was magically rejuvenated.   And yes, I know he never wanted to be in Detroit. That’s not the way to handle it though."
"That said, I would just like to say fuck Blake Griffin."
"&gt;People seriously thought the dude was significantly injured because he did not try. Sad.  To be fair, he's still clearly a shell of his formerly mega-athletic self. Even compared to 2019 Blake, he's lost a good bit. But that's what happens when you're 32, undergo multiple knee surgeries, and miss nearly two consecutive seasons of basketball. We're talking about a guy who averaged 25, 8, and 5 in 2019 who we're now lauding for averaging 9 &amp; 5 in the postseason this year.   I don't doubt the notion that he wasn't particularly enthusiastic to go 110 percent for a team that was actively tanking, but dude was indeed significantly injured too. I have a tough enough time coming back after missing three weeks with a sprained ankle; I can only imagine the reacclimation involved with coming back to the NBA following close to two years off.  I personally thought it seemed as though Griffin slowly rounded more and more into shape as the season went on, even in Brooklyn. He went from sitting every fourth game and playing 20 minute or less off the bench for the Nets in the regular season to being able to hold things down for 25 min. plus as a starter in the postseason."
"cant speak for everyone else but i had super high expectations for giannis considering this bucks team has no one that should be able to guard him. his matchup is fucking blake griffin lol. with all due respect giannis SHOULD be getting his, question was if the rest of the team would  KD had to work for it way more with tucker on his ass"
"Blake Griffin was literally a star player that dragged his team to the playoffs a couple of years ago. Obviously, he doesn't have the same ability anymore, but he looked healthy and had arguably his best game all year today."
"He had Blake Griffin also, but with one and a half legs."
Fuck Blake Griffin
"A super team Nets team needed an injured Jaylen Brown, an injured Kemba, an injured Robert Williams, and the refs in order to beat the Celtics. We can come up with hypotheticals all day long. Nets are going to probably lose Bruce Brown, Dinwiddie, and possibly Blake Griffin and Jeff Green in the off season. Also Kyrie Durant and Harden are getting up there in age and it’s no guarantee they will stay healthy. I think this was the Nets year to win it"
"Lmao. U really dont like giving Giannis credit. Even if Harden wasn’t as good as he normally is (even though he almost had a triple double but whatever), Kevin Durant was the second coming of Jesus Christ this series, and Giannis beat him.  Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday actively shit the bed as well as Bud running terrible plays like he was trying to go home. The Nets had like 4 of the best 5 performances this game and Giannis came out on top. Oh, Blake Griffin also played great defense and had some clutch buckets and PJ Tucker fouled out in OT. Giannis still wins.   Idc what happened with Harden, Giannis is a clutch player and nothing casuals say will change the fact that he showed tf up today. Yall will come up with every excuse before admitting that he proved the haters wrong today"
yeah ok https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/blake-griffin-injury-update-pistons-vet-has-surgery-on-left-knee-expected-to-miss-rest-of-season-per-report/
I’m a pretty big believer in Blake Griffin being able to be the 3rd best player on a playoff team but I feel like it might be sacrilege to say that out loud.
These guys playing 53 minutes is a great lesson in why no team can simply get together 3 max contracts + Blake Griffin and expect it to make up for a nonexistent bench.
Blake Griffin definitely does not have the clout to be referred to by his initials
Umm yes he needs his teammates to perform bruh. This isn't tennis. And as for the shooters you want to know about. Kevin love was averaging 20 ppg vs Toronto shooting near 50%. The nets second highest scorer in this series is probably blake griffin with 12 ppg. Durant just had an all time great playoff series. He deserves some respect on his name. He averages 35ppg this series. That's an all time great series compared to anyone not named michael jordan.
Nah Blake Griffin fouled out in OT. And yeah Middleton was PISSED
Seriously fuck Blake Griffin. He played dirty the whole series. Lost all of my respect for him after he turned to the dark side.   Fucking karma bit the Nets so hard in the ass. Basketball gods have spoken.
"Harden at least was able to play as a decoy, could still draw fouls and acted as a facilitator. People move the goal posts on LeBron so often that it almost underrates him.   That 06-07 Cavs team:  LeBron (22 years old) Big Z Anderson Verajao Drew Gooden Daniel Gibson Sasha Pavlovic Eric Snow Ira Newble  20-21 Brooklyn KD Harden Kyrie (yes, he played in 2.5 games) Jeff Green Blake Griffin Joe Harris Brown DeAndre Jordan (IDK why he didn’t get any run)  You can’t **possibly** tell me that these teams are in any way comparable. KD and LeBron, maybe they’re a wash, but KD is 10 years LeBron’s senior on this series. So you trade athleticism for experience.  A hurt Harden is better than anyone else on those Cavs. 2.5 games of Kyrie is better than anyone on those Cavs. Jeff Green is better and more complementary than anyone of those Cavs. Blake Griffin at this age is better than anyone of those Cavs. Joe Harris is a 48% regular season 3PT shooter. Him choking in this series has not merit on the fact that if current him was on that Cavs team, he would have been an asset.  And no disrespect to KD, he was masterful this series. But LeBron’s Cavs **won** against a team that had been the ECF champions for several consecutive seasons."
What do you think about Blake Griffin joining the Nets as well as countless other veterans minimum players joining superteams?
Was Harden not on the court? Blake Griffin? Joe Harris? Jeff Green? Weren't they getting hyped up all year? Now they're bums? Or is it just that KDisney can't do anything without 2 superstars on his team?
"Lebron is an all time great playmaker who needs shooters around him lol. Look at the players starting for the nets tonight. Bruce brown, blake griffin, Joe "" bricking every open 3"" Harris and harden with one leg. This nets is not a lebron team."
The elation in the bar I was watching this from was unmatched by any another sporting event I’ve seen. Fuck KD. Fuck Blake Griffin. Fuck Superteams.
"Yes, the biggest knock on him is his ability to score/get good shots in the playoffs. He picked his spots better and both he and his teammates got him in 1 on 1 positions where he can be successful. A prime example of that is when he got that face-up on Blake Griffin which led to Blake fouling out. I think he’s not as good with his back to basket, but if he drives and then backs into his defender he can also be really effective. Between that and his ability to get downhill in transition or off ball movement he will keep having big games in the playoffs, imo."
Couldn’t be happier for Blake Griffin to be at home realizing he gave up like 13 million dollars to go out in the 2nd round.
"As a basketball fan, I’m happy to see the Nets “superteam” eliminated. I was mildly irritated when they picked up Harden. When ring chasers like Blake Griffin joined them, I started rooting against them.  My feelings as a Sixers fan are mixed. If they can claw past the Hawks, they can’t compete with the Bucks in the East Finals. Bucks in 5. So… Go Clippers?"
Well looks like DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin won’t be appearing in the Finals
"Honestly, the only reason he looked to be out there is to put Giannis at the line, i guess due to Blake Griffin foul trouble. But at least run sets to give him looks."
Either there’s contact or there isn’t. But Tucker was getting called for bullshit all night anyway while Blake Griffin had carte blanche to do whatever he wanted. Watch PJ’s sixth foul and tell me more about how bad it is that Giannis gets 11 seconds for a FT. Or just keep crying.
Yeah why are we ignoring Blake griffin? It’s not all star Blake griffin but he’s still clearly a solid player
Blake griffin got away with tons of dirty fouls down the stretch in this series
"&gt; Harden at even 75% and KD isn't required to carry the ENTIRE load alone. Dude legit had a Lebron'ish type workload of trying to carry his team's in the East.  Are you kidding? KD had Kyrie for 4 games, a hamstrung Harden for the rest, coach Bud playing in his own poo all series, plus one of the best shooters in the league in Joe Harris and still-pretty-good Blake Griffin."
"How could have kd played smarter, Joe harris wasnt hitting anything, Harden was 50% at beat and wasnt willing to drive, his side kick that series was blake griffin/bruce brown... I dont see how he could have possibly played it better"
"Honestly once they covered up our banners with random pictures of Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan, the hatred was seared into my soul."
It was always CP3 and Blake Griffin for me.
Blake Griffin/Chris Paul/DeAndre Jordan  and  James Harden/Chris Paul/Carmelo Anthony  &amp;#x200B;  ??  Okay bud
Luka Doncic traded to the Nets for former all stars Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan.
Blake Griffin WILLED that terrible Pistons team to the playoffs in 2019 and played through injury trying to win them a game. I think him “relaxing” was a good decision instead of trying to be the Pistons savior and get injured again.
*cough* Blake Griffin
"Lol what??   There was only one team committing murder in that series.   PJ Tucker raking his fingers across the eyes of KD, and then Harden both multiple times.   Giannis throwing 1-2 hard spinning elbows every game, absolutely nailing Jeff Green, KD, Blake Griffin, and Bruce Brown in the face multiple times. That shit causes stone cold knockouts in MMA but for Giannis it's just a ""basketball play"".   Giannis undercutting and injuring Kyrie by ""boxing him out"" while he was in midair. And then doing the exact same thing to Harden in game 5, lucky for him he didn't get injured.   I cannot believe a Bucks fan is crying bloody murder. You have the most reckless, aggressive superstar the NBA has seen in decades."
Being a teammate of Blake Griffin and Russell Westbrook didn't help. I think it's changed since most people thought he was done after going to OKC and now he's leading a team to the finals.
"I think people shit on him pulling up for a transition three despite him shooting 1/16 the previous series  Nobody has said he should drive to the rim less, he shot 84% at the rim vs the Nets but shot 25% from three that's why people were angry   Blake Griffin was guarding him"
The only way to top it is to get Blake Griffin on set and convince him to call 911 and yell “**YES CHRIS PAUL IS GOING TO BEAT ME UP.**”
The Bucks barely beat a crippled Nets team and couldn't take advantage of a team playing Blake Griffin at the 5.... He may be fine for the regular season but he just isn't good enough for a team competing for a title.
"Blake Griffin, Kevin Love, Porzingy. Edit: worth the max in that they received a max"
"His last years in Phoenix he was really developing a great midrange game and an ability to put the ball on the floor a little bit too. Kind of a lite version of modern stretch 4s who can shoot. It would have been amazing to see him with those skills at his peak athleticism pre injuries.   While we’re on the subject, 23 yr old Blake Griffin with his 18-19 skill set would have averaged 35-15-5 on 62% TS lol."
"Since 03 I would say the best 2 are 09 and 11.  09 has Blake Griffin, James Harden and Stephen Curry who will make the HoF (2 of whom reached MVP level), also had multi-time All Star Demar DeRozan who honestly might get into the Hof, pls Jrue Holdiay and Jeff Teague all made at least one All Star team.  Then 2011 you have Kawhi, Kyrie, Klay, Jimmy Butler who are all probably going to make the HoF, plus two additional All Star players in Kemba and Vuc.  And as for your last statement, for this class to be better than 03, either Luka would have to basically be the GOAT, with another player being like Top 20 all time, OR, this class would to have like 3-4 guys be Top 10-15 players.  For 96, again, Luka will need to end up being one of the 10 best players ever, with Trae Young and Ayton being on the short list for consideration as Top 30 guys.  I'm sorry, I can't say ""yeah, I really see that happening""."
You put Rubio in that class like Blake Griffin and derozan don't exist
"What amazes me is that they still had some depth after the trade. Jeff green, Blake griffin, even Bruce Brown and Claxton  stepped up this playoffs. You just can’t win when 2 of your starters are injured, especially when those 2 starters are also your second and third options.  But seriously, the depth they had before the trade was insane…"
he had one game towards the end of the season where he scored 30 or something like that. i wouldnt be suprised if he does something like Blake griffin. saving his game for a shot on a real team
"Given it's still only 2021, I think it will almost certainly be looked back on as a historically good draft a \~decade from now.   Just look at 2009 for comparison (a great draft from \~10 years ago):    2009 had Steph, Harden, Blake Griffin, DeMar, Jrue   2018 had Luka, Trae, Ayton, Shai, JJJ, Sexton   Luka is Steph/Harden level or maybe even above, Trae might also have a Steph/Harden career, and at least projects to be much better than Griffin/DeMar/Jrue. And I wouldn't be surprised if at least 3 of Ayton, Shai, JJJ, and Sexton eventually became all stars at a similar level to Griffin/DeMar/Jrue"
I don’t know man.. after recent performances he might lose ROY to Blake Griffin
"Giannis was defended by Blake Griffin, Trae was defended by Jrue Holiday.  Pretty stark difference."
Tru but man Giannis was really guarded by Blake Griffin lol
"Can't help but see the parallels in interviews between Trae Young and fellow Oklahoma athletes Blake Griffin, Kyler Murray, and Baker Mayfield. You either hate or love their corny swagger but you gotta respect them at the end of the day!"

Giannis has Blake Griffin on him. Tries to blow by him to the rim.  Giannis has Trae Young on him. Tries to blow by him to the rim.

Bucks will steamroll if this is how Hawks gonna defend entire series. Blake Griffin was prime Dikembe Mutombo comparing to these.

But we had to give up Chris Kaman, so was it really worth it?  ——————————————————————————-  And it’s all been pretty downhill from there honestly"
Can we not bring Blake Griffin?
"It's crazy to realize this Hawks team is not even full strength. Missing some nice pieces. No matter what happens in this series, it's nothing but love for Atlanta fans. Fuck James Harden, Blake Griffin, and Mike Dunleavy."
"No way in hell the Nets were ""better equipped"" to handle Giannis. They start Blake Griffin at center."
I just want them to win the championship to stick it to Blake Griffin.
"If you watched the games closely, he was very limited in crunch time. They were giving him open 3s and mostly open midrange jumpers. When he drove, they were so backed off of him that the defense was already collapsed. There was no way to force a defensive reaction because the only players who really needed to move were his primary defender and help defender, who were already clogging the lane due to his limitations on the perimeter.   That doesn't work for the length of the game, but it seemed to work well in the 4th quarter, and I imagine that they will do something very similar to what the Nets did, only instead of Blake the t-rex Griffin on him, it will be good defenders, like Bridges, Craig, Johnson, and Ayton on certain switches.   My main point is that I don't think there's a true favorite in that matchup."
"But Mo Bamba is a stupid example because wasn't anyone building their franchise around him. We're talking about players that are superstars and single handedly transform a teams fortunes. Funny how you've completely ignored my Doncic example. The whole fucking conversation is me saying, yes I would rather take the chance that he busts because that chance is small, than settle on a player that's just ""good enough"" because he has potential to be much greater. Sorry, you're not changing my mind. If anything Philly fans should agree with me. Think about how ridiculous this is. According to your logic, Sixers would have been dumb to draft Embiid if they could have traded him for Blake Griffin instead. After all, he was coming off a season in which he was 3rd in MVP voting. See how stupid that is? After all, Embiid could have been a bust and Griffin was an injury prone yet established great player."
Blake Griffin was traded to the Pistons at the back end of his career after multiple knee injuries. For some reason Stan Van Gundy was in complete control of both GM and HC job for the Pistons for a few season. Pistons should have never traded for him and set the franchise back 5 years trying to build around a guy that was past his prime.  You can say Blake gave up on them or whatever but the fact of the matter is Pistons wound up paying a guy 35 mil a season and the “amazing” Blake that gave up on the Pistons averaged like 12 PPG for the nets. Even if the Pistons got the Blake that was playing for the nets do you think they would be happy paying him a max contract for that production? No team would. Blake gave up because his career is almost over and didn’t want to be part of a young rebuild with a new front office moving away from him. It’s a two way street
"This isn't how the NBA works. You don't just work for an offseason and become a ""good 3PT shooter"". Blake Griffen is far more talented than Lonzo and in his own words it took him over [4 years and 400k attempts to get a reliable shot](https://www.si.com/nba/2017/11/07/blake-griffin-clippers-chris-paul-doc-rivers-lob-city).   Lonzo's 3PT% has improved, but he isn't a ""good"" 3PT shooter. He barely attempts a single contested 3 a game and his completely wide open his 3PT% is worse than the prior year on similar attempts, and worse than league average for guards.   He has found his spots but teams are clearly letting him shoot. If he fared any amount of pressure in the playoffs his stats would not look so hot. His FT% is far more important. It has improved but not drastically, and he clearly isn't confident in it because he isn't attempting any more than he was years prior."
My sister in law ran into Blake Griffin at some random bar on Michigan Ave.   They might live out in the burbs but they still frequent downtown.
"I think they could do worse. Their interior defense was a problem. If Ben Simmons is willing to just be an interior guy on offense and a lot of the time on defense, it might be ok for the Nets. And they'll be losing Blake Griffin most likely. Kyrie got really underrated this year, he was definitely a great scorer especially in clutch, but they'll still have Harden and KD."
Detroit Pistons  Overrated: Blake Griffin  Underrated: Ben Wallace or Pre injury Grant Hill
"I've watched the Pistons quite a bit last season, as I thought their off season moves were interesting.   Unmotivated Blake Griffin was hard to watch, but I felt that while they brought their A game against elite teams, they didn't always show up against the mediocre &amp; bad teams and that's what led to a 20 win season. They were not dominated by teams, they just made dumb mistakes.  Cade is a piece but if they make other good moves this offseason, the potential is to turn things around can happen sooner than people think. Casey is a great coach for this team."
Thrusts continuously 😍  Just like Blake Griffin
"""hey this is Blake Griffin, Chris Paul tryna get in the locker room"""
"Giannis started off as a skinny SF but he's basically a PF/C at this point. He's obviously a lot more versatile than a traditional big but he's basically what a modern big is. He defends inside, possibly the best rebounder in the league, plays as the biggest or the second biggest guy on the team.  Basketball-reference.com states that he played 86% of his minutes at PF, and only 2% at SF this season. Of course, position titles are becoming more and more meaningless but I'd say his game is closer to prime Blake Griffin/Amare than to guys like Kawhi/Melo/etc and even defensively he's more like a KG in style than Kawhi/PG/LeBron etc."
"I remember being okay with the Clippers when I was a kid. They had LO, Darius Miles, Quentin Richardson, Corey Maggette, and kinda felt like a fun young team.   Then they got Blake Griffin, and Chris Paul, and started getting annoying.  Blake gave some stupid interview where he said ""they say LA's a Lakers city, but when I walk around, I see more Clippers jerseys."" Like no you don't mother fucker we live in the same city! Lol"
Blake Griffin sure did enjoy it huh?
Staying healthy is part of the game? Signing mildly injury prone Kyrie and bringing back Harden early from a hammy injury (not talking about this series) is 100% on the Nets. And we gonna act like Blake Griffin didn’t play some of the best basketball we’ve seen from him in the last 3 years or so? On a minimum contract nonetheless.
This is karma for the shit Blake Griffin pulled on them.
Where I s Blake griffin
Maybe they can trade it to Brooklyn for Blake Griffin!
Blake Griffin left 13m's to get out of Detroit. I never visited Detroit but I know people who have and they say parts of the city look like post apocalyptic.
Fuxk you Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin was the sacrifice to bring in Cade. He died for this.
Those [Pistons jerseys](https://www.detroitbadboys.com/2019/7/29/8903734/detroit-pistons-teal-horse-grant-hill-blake-griffin-ja-morant-nba-memphis-grizzlies-toronto-raptors) from the Grant Hill era were dope. Will really root for the Pistons with that plus their bright future.
"Book, Blake griffin formerly"
"It sounds made up but I’m just telling it like she told me. At first we all thought she meant Blake griffin since he actually lived in LA at the time, but she confirmed it wasn’t him."
"Dumars constructed teams that won a championship and got us to many ECFs. Almost every GM in sports gets fired eventually, even the great ones. The end of his tenure was for sure a disaster, but Gores decisions kept us mired in mediocrity instead of committing to rebuilding.   For example, The Blake Griffin trade was fun and all but it set us back"
Zion dunks and that's it. Zion is Blake Griffin 2.0. The idea that he was in any way comparable to Lebron is just plain silly.
Who? Bower? Stefanski? Stan? Gores wanted the Blake Griffin trade that mortgaged our future for a few ticket sales and first round sweeps. And the drafting under him has been putrid. One year of Weaver and we got a 1st team all rookie and 2nd team all rookie.
The Pistons sub had fuck blake griffin threads this year so idk about that. A lot of them just accept it though.
I feel like it's gonna be another Blake Griffin situation for him
"Oh please, it's not even Pistons fans that are mad about Blake Griffin. You just want to stir some shit you know nothing about."
"I’m happy for DET. There’s not many sports markets that have it as tough as MIL, but DET is definitely one of them.   And those early 2000’s teams were always so fun to watch, which also goes to show the fans will support a winner in the city. Hopefully Cade and the boys can help bring about that.  Edit: and how could I forget, fuck blake griffin"
thanks for uhh half of Blake Griffin
THANK YOU BLAKE GRIFFIN FOR NOT DUNKING - LOL
really dude really?  not even Blake Griffin?  oh wait
Blake Griffin.   Wait.... fuck.
Detroit Pistons fans when are you throwing the parade for Blake Griffin who sacrificed nothing to make this happen?
Thank Blake Griffin for his service
Blake griffin in shambles right now
Nba said fuck Blake griffin
"I think it's way more complicated than this. We're definitely in a player's market right now; if a player asks for a trade they're almost certainly going to get it. Look at how hard the Rockets got fucked.   You don't have to sit out 4-5 years to be worth trading. Look at Blake Griffin. You can play and just kinda half ass it, which I'm sure lots of players are willing to do (Kevin Love) if their team isn't attempting to be competitive but also won't accommodate their trade request. And for Zion, who every single team in the league would build a trade package to acquire, the Pels would be way better off trading him than just forcing him to stick around."
"i think people are seeing chris paul have a rennaisance and to a lesser degree blake griffin, who can still dunk. But sometimes guys just suck and going to a new team won't change that."
"Dwight Howard is a lock, Ginobili as well, Blake Griffin is borderline I know he said injuries but if he could maybe get a couple more All-Star appearances or at least be a valuable contributor to this Nets team on a championship level that could get him in         Jimmy Butler's borderline, and the NBA right now is so guard heavy, there are some damn good guards that I could see not making it just because of the competition level obviously he's injured now but look at a Jamal Murray even compared to his other peers that are 25 and younger just as an example so it's tough to say"
The fact you made it out to be as if it is even a question for Manu in this and lumped him in with Blake Griffin makes me really... disappointed?
Blake Griffin could maybe make it but Kyle Korver lmao no fucking chance
"Or Blake griffin lol, idk what this guy is on"
I’d give the  edge to the sixers support just off of Seth playing amazing. Tobi was alright. Tbf to the nets tho Blake griffin was playing pretty nice and Jeff green was big in game 6. If joe Harris looked like his normal self I feel like it’d be pretty even since the sixers supporting cast outside of Tobi and Seth didn’t do much and Danny was out
So I say I don't like Blake Griffin and one of the reason is that he holds so you tell me PJ Tucker also holds. I really don't care lol
What does Blake Griffin holding have to do with KD's freethrows?
Wasn't AD a late fill-in for an injured Blake Griffin?
Detroit resisted the tank for years — we traded for Blake Griffin! That's got to be at least top-4 worthy karma.
"Yeah agreed, CP3 definitely wasn't hated by teammates. He just didn't get along with Blake griffin and James Harden that well towards the end of their run."
"Or, unrelated but, Blake Griffin just flat out holding people. God I hate that guy lol"
"Why?  If the team doesn't want you, you should be free to play for any team you like. Blake Griffin was free to sign with any other team, but he chose to sign for the Nets for the minimum.  So did Drummond, Batum, and Gorgui Dieng with their respective new teams.  Baseball has the same rule.  If you get waived in baseball and no one claims you after a certain number of days, you are free to sign with any other team.  Usually it's the minimum, which gets deducted from the salary your previous team is playing you.    The teams don't have to waive them.  If they could have extracted any value out of the contract they would have, but they couldn't."
How can you forget Blake Griffin?
"Blake Griffin violently attacking Giannis all series, Brook Lopez's arms being yanked down on shots, etc. It's almost like no calls are a fact of the game, and they go both ways. Without even getting into the pro-Nets phantom calls balance. 👀"
"At first I thought this was just a joke, but now I'm having a minor existential crisis trying to remember good basketball players with red hair. Blake Griffin sorta but definitely not full red hair."
"Hey, this is just pure speculation but do you think a line up of James Harden, Kyrie Irving, KD, Joe Harris and Blake Griffin would work in today’s nba? Offensively they’d be a monster but I feel like opposing teams would constantly score 120+ points on them every game."
Or Blake Griffin on Detroit
giannis was expected to thrive this series lmao blake griffin was guarding him. the broad question about giannis is if he can do it against teams equipped to defend him like the 2019 raps and 2020 heat.   the question in this series specifically was whether his teammates could step up enough to beat a healthy nets team. they could not. then the question was if his teammates could step up enough to beat a nets team missing kyrie and harden playing on one leg. they could!
&gt; well-rounded supporting cast  Yeah gonna have to disagree here. Joe Harris was a walking brick all series. Bruce Brown single handedly choked game 3. Blake Griffin was alright. Jeff Green was playing on 1 leg and only played like 4/7 games. Everyone else on the team was a nobody + Harden is not built for the playoffs.
"People are heavily underrating that Nets supporting cast.  Blake Griffin, Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green along with either Kyrie or Harden is an insanely good roster next to Kevin Durant."
He gonna finessed the sixers and do a blake griffin on his new team
Blake Griffin and Brook Lopez are examples of guys that developed a shot much later in their career to change their game
Blake Griffin special
"I saw this earlier today and cackled, cuz it was a last thing I expected to be number one.  Equally hilarious was him saying that Blake Griffin stole money from the Pistons 🤣 SAS issa comedian."
Yes but Harden requested to be traded to Brooklyn.  No offense to OKC but the only time a player is gonna demand a trade to OKC is if Blake Griffin or Trae Young gets really homesick.  Don’t they have all those picks from trading away stars who wanted to leave?
"2011-2021  PG: Trae Young SG: Kyle Korver SF: Kobe Bryant PF: Blake Griffin   C: Nikola Jokic   Lobs, threes, pretty passes, and *vibes*."
"why do you actually think is easier?  honest question, why does everyone act like underhanded is gonna make people better shooters?  Blake griffin didnt start shooting underhanded free throws, and look how much he improved"
Bruh that's an insult to Blake Griffin.
How did that work out for blake griffin? Love isnt gonna get bought out. They want to move him.trade him...besides love gives u nothing on defense and thats what the nets need..
"Bucks played horrible against the nets despite the nets had Harden Kyrie both injured, and had to rely on Blake Griffin to defend the rim"
"Can't forget the 2009-10 Rookie of the Year showdown between Brandon Jennings and Tyreke Evans.  Also in that draft: Curry, Harden, Blake Griffin (injured), DeRozan"
Watching Blake Griffin coming back to life was amazing.
How is Brook Lopez more athletic than Blake Griffin???
"If Blake Griffin can get bought out while being owed 36+ million a year with a PO, literally anyone can, trust me.  Love will get bought out likely if he doesn't fully rehab his trade value with this Olympics run and some part of next season"
Kevin “LaMarcus ‘Blake Griffin’ Aldridge” Love.
A collection of 33 countries is more racially diverse than a single country? Who could’ve guessed that. The idea behind the Blake Griffin comment is that stating where the person is from (Latinos being from Latino America) should not affect your perception of their race. Here’s another example: “oh Elon Musk is South African? I thought he was full white.”
"He’s gonna get the Blake Griffin treatment if they do buy him out, just take the cap hit over the next 2 years and call it a day.  (I also don’t see any reasonable trade that makes sense for a team to send out that much salary and take back Love and improve)"
He gonna pull a Blake Griffin and all the sudden start trying when he gets to Brooklyn lol
"First Cavs run LeBron plus Miami LeBron was the best in game dunker I have ever seen, with Blake Griffin and Vince Carter right there too."
"2014 one could argue that the Heat had a cakewalk to the Finals, no Derrick rose, and the Pacers were only team capable of giving them a fight - and even they got blown out in game 6. Clippers were one of the best teams on paper - but overshadowed by the Sterling issues.  Ibaka injury early in the conference finals vs the Spurs made it less of a series. LeBron went out injured in game one of the finals - and immediately allowed an 18-2 run - putting them in a hole.  I don't think any of these are fair criticisms, just an example that you can nitpick little things here and there. Biggest one would be the Heat path to the Finals.    There were a ridiculous amount of injuries in 2013. Rose, Garnett and Rondo, the entire Lakers roster, Blake Griffin injury + the CP3 suspension vs the grizzlies, Westbrook torn Meniscus, etc."
"I know bro we had SVG for 5 years too. Except it was worse cause he was also the GM and did the stupidest shit like trading a pick that became SGA + Tobias Harris for the corpse of Blake Griffin  Alll i can say is - eventually you guys will rebuild and get out of mediocre purgatory, you’ll draft a star, and everything will be looking up in DC :)"
Or they just don't think he was aesthetically pleasing compared to other dunkers. I never thought Blake Griffin was aesthetically pleasing. He was a powerful dunker though. Shawn Kemp was both in my opinion. I'm much older than 15. I'd personally go Jason Richardson or Gerald Green. They made it look so smooth and effortless.
Surprised prime Blake Griffin isn't mentioned much here. Lob city era was just highlight dunks every night.
"No. He didn't play his first season due to injury. And I don't forget he's the only player as, for instance, Blake Griffin was in the same situation. Missed 1st season and won ROY when he really played.  David Robinson exactly the same. Missed his 1st two season and won ROY the first year he played.   Saying that a player missing a whole season due to a gruesome injury counts as having played is a joke. I don't hear people saying the same about Blake or Robinson.   He has played 4 years of NBA games no matter how you look at it"
Old school: Blake Griffin. New school: Ja Morant
"Not the exact comparison I wanted to make. Nor do I think MVP race is a good measure of how good players are as it’s mostly an award based on team success (not always and definitely not as of late).   Dwight Howard was in the top 5 four years in a row and finished 2nd to Derrick Rose in 2011. Neither of them were better than Lebron…nor Embiid talent wise.  Blake Griffin was 3rd in 2014 but doesn’t come close to Yao’s level of skills despite his absence in the top 10 in any year.  I don’t know if The MVP race (not talking about the actual award/winner) is a good measure of skills…….which is my original point — Yao had all the intangibles, although I’d still give Embiid the edge for his dribbling and overall defense. I was simply trying to point out the level of talent but the lack of availability of both players."
I much prefer Young Blake Griffin   :)
watch as he signs with the nets for a minimum deal and plays like an allstar  the blake griffin special
"[Griffin was ruled out before game 5 meaning we were about to even the series when he got hurt](http://es.pn/1SqwOyb)  We won one game with both healthy and the second with Blake mostly there, though he missed like ballpark 47 games that year. If there was any wind in their sails I'd say it was entirely out the last two games of that series. Exaggerated some? Sure, but not entirely inaccurate."
That Blake Griffin commercial is my favorite commercial of all time and it’s not even close.
The reverse Blake griffin
Lol it’s not like Blake was guarding Lopez in the post. You guys are overrating an average defender in Blake Griffin.   The Hawks got abused by Lopez inside last game cuz he actually played inside and is a huge mismatch and idk what was up with Capela.   Giannis’ scoring wasn’t much different in the Nets series than it is this series in fact he was scoring more against the Nets.
"Blake Griffin is strong as fuck, the Nets defense as a whole was severely underestimated during the regular season"
Blake griffin is not a HOF. Not even close. He’s a high flying PF who was really fun to watch (and play in 2k12). Honestly his best years were with CP3 and I think that discounts his accomplishments even more now that we’re seeing how Paul creates good teams
His %s were alot higher than I remembered looking them up around 46% for a 5 yr stretch from mid range. Elite level. Back in his playing days I wouldve assumed he was like at that 40%ish Blake Griffin type level
in fairness blake missed his whole rookie season (2009-2010)  so is more like griffin having only 79 games more in 3 extra seasons
He wasn’t better than Blake Griffin in college
&gt;Holy shit the disrespect to Blake Griffin. Did you just start watching the NBA this season? &gt;  Let's not pretend Blake is even close to a HoF player lol
"In fairness Giannis is a lock for the HOF while Griffin is a genuine coin toss.     Every single MVP has either been inducted, or is a lock to be inducted (with the possible exception of Rose).     Giannis is in rare company with 2xMVP, and has significantly better accolades than Blake even without those.  Blake was a great player but never made all nba 1st team (3x second team is still impressive, obviously).  He's probably slightly more likely than not to make the HOF.     There really isn't any chance at this point that Giannis doesn't make the HOF.  The algorithm only looks at all-star appearances (as far as accolades), so it underrates guys that have won MVPs or made 1st team appearances."
Holy shit the disrespect to Blake Griffin. Did you just start watching the NBA this season?  Why is this being upvoted?
Because people who dont watch basketball know who Blake Griffin is due to millions of ads he did especially the kia ads
how tf does Giannis have a lower HoF probability than Blake Griffin on that list
"The Los Angeles Clippers had a pretty toxic atmosphere at that time. CP3, Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan and had the head coach of the Boston boys club himself - Doc Rivers"
Lopez looks like prime Blake griffin rn
"Doc's record should be good, he coached T-mac, KG, Pierce, Rondo, Ray Allen, Chris Paul, Shaq, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, etc.   This doesn't mean he's good, a little bit of smoke and mirrors in those numbers IMO."
"I think it's important to make the distinction that, prior to this year especially, Chris Paul's ""way"" of playing basketball was no more successful than any of the stars he played with and he seems really intent on playing that way.  For all of the stuff I'm reading about others having ego problems, it's likely just as true that CP has an ego problem of his own that's just as egregious as the people y'all are talking about (Harden, Blake, etc.).  Chris Paul wanting to play Chris Paul's brand of basketball is perfectly reasonable but it's no more rational than James Harden or Blake Griffin wanting to play their brand of basketball.  He didn't have championship level experience when he played with those guys and with Harden specifically, he was just flat out worse and less successful than Harden had been up to that point."
Lol. Back during those grizzlies series when ZBo would make Blake Griffin look like a little boy.
"LeBron, KD, Curry, Dwight, Carmelo Anthony, CP3, Kawhi Leonard, Westbrook, Giannis, Harden, Anthony Davis, Blake Griffin, Paul George, Draymond Green, Kyrie Irving, Dame Lillard, Luka Doncic, Nicola Jokic, Rudy Gobert.  Guys like Ben Wallace and potentially Vince Carter have recently lowered the floor quite a bit."
The Blake griffin special
"I do not mean this as an insult, but you need to understand how the cap works in the NBA.   Hard caps are only triggered if you use the non tax payer MLE, sign and trade, or bi annual exception.   Otherwise, you can resign your own players and go over the cap. Your penalty is the luxury tax.   160m is a lot but they wouldn't even be the highest in the NBA.   Next season if the Warriors do not resign Kelly Oubre or Kent Bazemore, they are at 168m.   The Nets if they do not retain Spencer Dinwiddie, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, Blake Griffin, they are at 150m with 7 players on their roster."
harden does it less now. Chris Paul has always done it and one reason why people hated the clippers. on top of that they had Blake Griffin. i feel like he learned that shit from cp3
\&gt; CP3 played on a team based around lobbing  Neither DeAndre Jordan or Blake Griffin even in his prime has ever been a reliable a target as Karl Malone. There is also a large disparity in minutes played and general availability due to health and more rest given in the league on average.  \&gt; Tony Parker played with Duncan  Spurs style of basketball was way different. No one on the Spurs ever averaged a lot of assists during that reign because of the way they moved the ball around no one person racked them up ton. They didn't sit there and feed Duncan all game from one playmaker.
I used to be a Clippers fan until they did Blake Griffin dirty with that Pioneers Tshirt bullshit.
"Nah, people hate on flopping fake players. There’s countless clips of cp3 acting it up and just being straight up dirty to get a call. Like there’s regular flopping and crying to the ref then there’s cp3 flopping and whining to the ref.  He takes it to a whole nother level by tripping over himself, pretending to get tripped, and he even trips others but acts like he’s the victim.   He made that clippers squad unbearable to watch. That was the most bitch made team with him and Blake griffin being flopping divas crying after every play. To make things worse, he’s just so fucking fake. The clip of him pretending to share a laugh with Steve Kerr than immediately frowning when turning the other way is just disgusting. You would expect better from someone who’s the damn president of the players association.  He’s charismatic and is good with his words so people fall for his bullshit. It’s disappointing that he has to do this type of shit because as almost everyone has mentioned in these threads, he’s fucking amazingly skilled and can play and see the game at a tremendous level."
"I mean, LeBron is an “aging star,” so that’s definitely not the same as washed. I thought Blake Griffin was washed. Kevin Love is washed.  Udonis Haslem is washed. CP3 wasn’t in that list, he just seemed overpaid"
Would you rather be one of those 2 guys or that trainer who had Blake Griffin force his head in his lap to simulate a blowjob?
Weird no one has mentioned Blake Griffin yet. Man is sneaky dirty
Blake Griffin lowkey up there but not on Pat Bev level
ya what he did to blake griffin was inexcusable.
I mean it’s part of the reason why guys like Blake Griffin or Drummond went to LA and NY for way less money than they’re worth
"4 superstars plus next year’s Blake Griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge, and any other vet that wants a free ring"
Blake Griffin
"Don’t blame Paul for this, blame the shittiest refs in professional sports for how terrible they are at their jobs.  You cannot watch a single game anymore without a seeing a dozen egregious calls or missed calls made by the refs.  They are god awful! Why not flop when all it takes is for you to fall in an animated fashion and refs who you know didn’t see anything happen, to make a guess and give you a call.  I love the game, but damn, it is tough to watch and in no way do I trust the results.  Watching grown men fall like a ton of bricks when another player taps them, but yet quickly puff up their chests when they are disrespected is fucking hilarious.  The way they fall, no doubt my 5-9 190 pound self would beat the shit out of 90% of the league (bam adebayo, jimmy butler, Blake Griffin, watch your backs.  Im fucking you up when I see you lol)"
"Chris Paul will be an NBA champion before Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, and James Harden"
This loss is on doc rivers 100% for driving CP3 out of LA which led to Blake Griffin being pitched as the new Ali which caused Ballmer to realize he f'd up which caused him to ditch Tobi and Bobi which caused Butler to leave philly and go to Miami and not team up with Kawhi in LA leading to wayoff P the backup plan but hes a 2nd option Paul cause Chris is first
"I wonder how Chris Paul’s kids feel about him as a player and a father. No tattoos, great actor, and 99% of his assist totals from lobs to Tyson Chandler and Blake Griffin."
"&gt; Who would you rather have for a dunker: Prime Blake Griffin or Prime Aaron Gordon  Griffin, because he could do it better in game."
He was dating Blake Griffin in the past?
No that was Blake griffin
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
Mark Cuban (I think) driving around trying to get DeAndre Jordan's address when Chris Paul and Blake Griffin went to his house and convinced him to renew with the clippers after he'd given Dallas a verbal agreement.  At least that’s what the tweet by Broussard said
His skill set heavily relies on his athleticism.  I’d say he drops off early 30s similar to Blake Griffin.
Mark Cuban (I think) driving around trying to get DeAndre Jordan's address when Chris Paul and Blake Griffin went to his house and convinced him to renew with the clippers after he'd given Dallas a verbal agreement.
"My most unpopular opinion that granted me a lot of bad karma here is that Russell Westbrook will be out of the league in 1-2 year. Russ is proven to be only a statpadder and his teams are constantly playing bad with him. He is truly uncoachable because his skillset is so particular and hard to mesh with a normal winning rosters. His efficiency is dropping fast and as age comes he would be less and less explosive. As he enter in the last 2 years of his contract, if the Wizards are stuck in 7th or 8th seed also next season (and I think they couldn't do better with that roster) Beal will then ask a trade and playing with only Russ at 34-35 yo has zero sense for a team. That will lead to a buyout for Russ mid season or earlier, but with his skills I hardly see him playing from the bench or with a Blake Griffin kind of role. Maybe someone will try anyway but still I see more likely to see him in China in 2 years at most (or retired)."
"David Lee would literally somehow play 4x better against Blake Griffin. We put Green in and even better things happen.   Our regular season games were good and he is saying that even under Mark Jackson, we could and did beat them. No not in the 7 game series but that’s because Curry couldn’t even breathe on the person he guards."
Nets best chance was this year. Dinwiddie is a free agent. Kyrie has either been physically or psychologically unable to perform for about 4 consecutive playoffs even if this year was a freak injury. Harden and KD will be 32 and 33. Blake Griffin needs to play at 70% for his body to not implode. I don’t see it unless the other top teams all have injured superstars again
"Blake Griffin punching the athletic trainer/friend in the face, breaking his hand.  Ty Lawson and his numerous DUIs."
"Like Seth curry in the Philadelphia series got a chance to show off when others wouldn't step up, or Blake Griffin when kyrie and harden went down. Tons of role players or players we thought were done stepped up when it mattered. Unfortunately both examples here weren't enough to win but none the less they stepped up."
Didn't Blake Griffin hit a shot like that last season but it didn't count? Or am I going crazy
“I ain’t Blake Griffin I ain’t drive no KIA” - Guwop
You’re in straight denial if you refuse to believe that the competition then sucked compared to now. Blake Griffin would be dropping 30 points 17 rebounds per game if he played then at his current state
Saying he has Kevin Love is like saying Jerami Grant had Blake Griffin (for 20 games before the trade). He played 25 games and absolutely sucked.
"Not bad.  Quality over quantity.  Trae Young, Blake Griffin, and Buddy Hield."
"This is what happens when you're a sharp shooter who played with prime Dwight Howard, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, and Joel Embiid"
Could you imagine Blake griffin getting traded to Phoenix to reunite with cp3? Brooklyn is too stacked for him to wanna leave. But one could imagine.
"Nooo, My Kyrie Irving-Blake Griffin Duo~  David Stern"
"Brooklyn's biggest weakness is their lack of size, which is why they leaned heavily into their biggest strength in the playoffs, which was spreading the floor with shooters and letting their big dogs cook. Milwaukee was able to beat them because of their huge size advantage... and injuries.... Anyways, their size and versatility paid dividends against a small Brooklyn team. None of Blake Griffin, Jeff Green or KD shouldn't be playing center in the playoffs against either Brook Lopez or Giannis.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't know the exact FA pool, but I'm sure a decent center would be willing to take the MLE from Brooklyn in order to compete.  &amp;#x200B;  And yeah I agree Joe Harris sucked in game 7 especially, but he's still a great shooter, and I think he'll step it up next year. If not, the talent of KD Harden and Kyrie is still more than capable of winning it for them."
Clippers had a stud in Blake Griffin they needed to build around and had a low lottery pick by the standings (8th pick?). Getting an all star 3pt shooter for a top 10 pick isn't a bad trade.  Would be like the Pelicans trading their first round pick this year for someone like Khris Middleton.
Trae Young and Blake Griffin to OKC confirmed!
All that complaining about Blake Griffin/LMA might come back to bite us lol
If he’s 6’9 why is he so much shorter than Blake Griffin and Kevin Love
"people were dunking all over pau in the league highkey, Blake Griffin loved making him his bitch"
"I mean tbf, cp3 also had blake griffin deandre jordan and jj reddick, problem was him and blake were made of glass lol"
"Because khris middleton and jrue holiday were trash for half the series. No one on the bucks was really helping Giannis consistently, KD had games where blake griffin, Jeff Green, bruce brown stepped up on top of having 2 games of healthy kyrie. Khris and jrue were hit or miss all playoffs."
"Blake Griffin. When we traded for him, I was pissed. Why would we want such an expensive, oft-injured one dimensional player when we as a team had no identity at the time and were in no position to compete? He then went on to have one of the best individual Pistons seasons I've ever seen, and I changed my tube on him, only for him to play the way he did last season and get bought out to join a contender, where he played like a completely different guy. I hated him, he won me over and I loved him, and now I hate him again."
Jeff Green should be more of a priority than Blake Griffin for the Nets right?
"I should rephrase my opinion. I believe on the clippers Chris Paul had overall better teammates then Stockton. I believe Deandre Jordan, Blake griffin, the sixth man of the year, some great three point specialists.   The more I think of it. I am wrong because clippers never were healthy. Yeah Chris Paul is better."
Giannis was being guarded by Blake Griffin while KD was being guarded by PJ tucker playing like a football player
"Blake Griffin during the lob city days. I wanted to play NBA 2K14 with my dad and asked him what team has the players that could dunk the most. He said the clips. Then we played Clips vs Spurs every day and i was watching a bunch of Griffin highlight reels. I remember he was like 3rd or something in MVP voting it was insane. I went on to support the clips untill 2017 but i couldnt do it after they did Blake so dirty so i saw the rookie that was taking the world by storm, Spida."
"37 year old Durant, 34 year old Irving, 36 year old Harden, and 37 year old Blake Griffin, all of which *already* come with huge injury concerns, lead their team to a title? LOL"
"Blake Griffin and Lob City, was in college at the time and cardio is boring af, until I caught a Clipper game.   Watching Blake Griffin dunk on everyone was the most entertaining thing ever. Became a Clips fan then and there. Also I forget on who but Deandre Jordan dunked on someone so hard I stopped jogging and just left the gym after that. Like, it was the nastiest dunk I’ve ever seen in my life. Full cockback and just YAMMED it."
KD Kyrie and Harden for team USA with Blake Griffin off the bench
"So they should be mediocre forever? My team was in the same position as the Wizards the last decade, rejecting trade offers for all-NBA Blake Griffin &amp; all-star Drummond to make the 8 seed. Then we tanked for 1 year and got the #1 pick. Rebuilds are so much better than mediocrity. Phoenix &amp; Atlanta should be their blueprint."
[both cp3 and blake got hurt in g5 vs grizz](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1178780-chris-paul-and-blake-griffin-injured-in-game-5-loss-vs-grizzlies)  cp3 still played great in g6 somehow but yea
"yes he was injured  &gt;At the end — with **Paul slowed by a groin injury**, Caron Butler playing with a broken left hand and Blake Griffin playing with a sore knee, and then needing four stitches after one of his teeth went through his lip — the Clippers came from 12 points behind in this elimination game. They were ahead by 5 with 4 minutes 54 seconds left to play and fought to the wire, with Mo Williams unable to get off what could have been a game-tying 3-pointer.  &gt;**“He doesn’t have that extra burst that he usually has, that extra pop; you can see that,” Clippers Coach Vinny Del Negro said of the physically hampered Paul.** “But we’re not in the second round of the playoff without Chris Paul. He gives you everything he has all the time. I can’t say how much he’s brought to the team, the organization, the city.”"
3 games of healthy kyrie. 3 games of harden on one leg. Blake Griffin Is washed up lmfao. Joe Harris was ass. Why are you trying to argue this?
"5 time Allstar Blake Griffin and NBA 3P% leader Joe Harris are suddenly nobodies. Never mind Kyrie played 4 and Harden 3 in the series.  If you take away the 0-2 headstart Milwaukee give all their opponents, it was a gentleman sweep."
tbf blake Griffin added a 3 point shot late in his career
"If I had a dime for every time I got shit on for suggesting the Pistons blow it up during the SVG/Blake Griffin era, I'd have a shit ton of nickels. Now look at us."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgYTcU2BeMY  That is really sad seeing opinions such as West better at basketball at Chris Paul.   Everyone has been trained to have opinions without even looking into things. I know that none of you have taken the time to watch these games and taken the time to learn and think, so why is there a need to post before looking into things?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lnu5vMfPtbw  There are full games all over youtube from all the earlier decades. When you actually watch, all the myths you're taught by ESPN and TNT boomers are exposed, from the lack of contact to the lack of skill.  Shocker, old people who control your narrative think everything was better back in the good old days. This bias is far from limited to sports.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9KaOX93gts  No, someone who couldn't dribble with his off hand was not better at basketball than Chris Paul. Jerry West dealt with zero physicality and virtually no competition. There was not widespread international basketball players to help strengthen the competition, not even for decades later.   There is no point in watching basketball when you have this little respect for it. The players today are far better at basketball than previous generations. Chris Paul led elite all time team O Ratings in multiple teams. His team always had above Offensive Team Ratings whether he played in New Orleans, Los Angeles, Houston, Oklahoma City, or Phoenix. He was constantly a top player by Adjusted Plus-Minus stats. He often led the league in assists, ast%, and steals, and the important thing is while also leading elite team offensive ratings, regardless of who he played for. He didn't play on supersteams, he played with David West and Blake Griffin. He fit with Harden unlike Westbrook. Harden and CP3 put up O Ratings side by side with the Golden State Warriors, aka they were both putting up the vest best Offensive Team Ratings ever.   But you don't need stats, you can watch full games from Jerry West to John Stockton  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuIdO3EGVWg  Go on, come back in a few hours and let's see what you really think about how much better and more physical basketball was 30, 70 years ago, and that's not even getting into how simple-minded it is valuing individual players by championships and narrative instead of basketball ability and impact."
So much Blake Griffin on there.
Yeah as long as you have Pop and the proven FO you don't have to worry about worst case scenario drafting or trading for Blake Griffin/Signing Josh Smith as a hail mary to keep their jobs. But still making the playoffs was fun for a really brief time and right when it's over I realize how I wish we had just tanked lol
Prime Blake Griffin
"Joe Harris, the best 3 point shooter in the nba by %.  Blake Griffin &amp; Deandre Jordan, former all-nba players.  Jeff Green &amp; Landry Shamet, starters for other contenders. Bench players for the Nets."
"Hasheem Thabeet. 2nd overall pick after Blake Griffin. 7'3"" out of UCONN and went to a solid Grizzles team. Supposedly the next Mutombo  I envisioned a few All Star Appearances and a few Defensive team selections because the league didn't have many great bigs. Worst case scenario thought he would at minimum be a 10-12 year rotational player.  Played 7 seasons never averaging 4 points or 4 rebounds. He somehow managed to miss his floor. Injuries suck but he was never actually as good as advertised even when healthy."
"Well, Blake Griffin is a 6x all star, 3x All-NBA second team, and 2x All-NBA player.   Deandre Jordan is a first team All-NBA player, 2x third team and 2x all-defense.   Not to mention, multiple time sixth man Jamal Crawford, Austin Rivers, JJ Redick.   That wasn’t just “every team in the west” caliber back in say 2015. That was a stacked team. If the argument is that “CP can’t win with those cats” isn’t that more so on Chris Paul? 🤷🏻‍♂️ I don’t know"
cmon the Nets were about to sweep the Bucks if Kyrie did not go down on top of Harden. Gentleman sweep at most   KD + whatever is left of Blake Griffin + Harden on one leg were 1 inch away from eliminating the Bucks  When you lose 2 of your top 3 players you're hardly gonna win any game at the NBA level
"That was a bit hyperbole, there were a few years that like 2012 he was definitely towards the lower half of the bottom 10 for me.    Off the top of my head I rank Lebron, Durant, Westbrook, Curry, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, Dwayne Wade easily over Melo in the majority of his prime years.  Other guys I would prefer includeChris Bosh, Blake Griffin, Dirk Nowitzki, Paul George.  This tier is debatable, so I don’t really care either way."
Do you see where it says Blake Griffin -and- Deandre Jordan?
Comparing blake griffin to kahwi leonard or james harden is disrespectful
"Well, earlier in the conversation I said Griffin and Deandre Jordan. I was making the point that Chris Paul had played on extremely talented teams. Obviously i’m not saying Blake Griffin was as good as Kawhi, but Griffin was a damn good basketball player on the Clippers and the team had talent in spades"
Blake Griffin doesn't belong in the conversation with Harden or Kawhi lol. Kawhis Toronto run is better than anything Harden has done in the playoffs as well.
Are you new to basketball?   Blake Griffin had multiple seasons as a top 10 player and Harden is in pretty much everyone’s top 5. They’re on the same tier.
Yeah it’s not like Chris Paul had multiple opportunities at championships with Prime Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan or James Harden
"&gt;but that’s way too far down the line  Well to start off, we already built upon one of the picks by acquiring the right to pick swap our nets pick with miami heat next year so hopefully next year is 15-20 rather than 25-30.  I'm born and raised in this city, have a career here, and don't plan on going anywhere for decades. Being patient, as long as the process is sound, doesn't bother me. Actually, the opposite approach of desperation bothers me (like pistons going for blake griffin years ago lol).  I'm hoping some picks will bear fruit but even if they don't, I think it was a reasonable bet given the other options. I'm really optimistic about how our asset compilation is going so far. By the time nets picks could be decent, they might be traded to complement a young playoff team we already built, who knows?  Draft picks are mystery boxes but also used as currency in transactions. Rockets got some play money."
Blake Griffin sure can dunk.
MLK. Gandhi. Blake Griffin.
NBA Heels team:  -	Kevin Durant -	James Harden -	Kyrie Irving -	Blake Griffin -	Patrick Beverly
"Thats a bad argument because you could say the same about just about any star. Lebron doesn't NEED Davis. Chris Paul didn't NEED Blake Griffin. Steph Curry doesn't NEED Thompson.  But they all benefit from that complementary star's talent. Same with Zo and Zion. Zion doesn't NEED Zo. But Zion would benefit with Zo, in a way he wouldn't with a less talented passer."
"Man he took them to OT of game 7 with Joe Harris shooting terrible, washed Blake Griffin, a guy named ""Uncle Jeff"", and Harden on 1 leg. His supporting cast in that series was a bottom 5 team in the league and he still almost won it. Giannis's supporting cast beat the Hawks twice in the ECF."
Umm. No they didn’t. They had joe harris and Bruce brown and a washed up Blake Griffin. Aka 6 guys. You need more than 6 guys to win a ring dude.
"&gt;you have to realize when you get that low in the rankings the margins are a LOT smaller between who’s better than who  Indeed they do, which makes it all the more jarring to me just how much you seem to underestimate how much an injury can mess with your career. I know we like to hope that everyone can come back and dominate like KD but you don't see anyone putting Blake Griffin or Demarcus Cousins in their top 50 these days and I should think deservedly so."
"When it comes to regular season, this [Blake Griffin game winner](https://youtu.be/5pPla33x4eU) will always stick with me"
"yeah, i remember Ibaka expanding his game on the Thunder then eventually would nail 3s. Same thing with Blake Griffin, his shot looks stiff af, but he can knock down 3s."
Giannis was scoring on blake fucking Griffin. Cut the bullshit.
"Giannis wasn't ""guarded by Blake Griffin"". The Nets were running a soft wall in the paint with KD leaving the corner shooter open to clog the paint and another Nets player in there too. He was rarely 1v1 against Blake. I don't even remember how many times Bruce Brown and Harris and Green were helping off their player, while KD was right there too and Blake was his main defender.  The Bucks weren't doubling KD though, they were letting him get his. He was always going 1v1 except for some time in game 5 when they tried it and Jeff Green torched them, so they stopped.  Ayton did guard Giannis 1v1."
honestly the suns didnt seem to be trying to draw charges as much outside of that one from torrey craig that i remember. jeff green/blake griffin were more brave than most of the suns team
You forgot the best stopper kaminsky. We all gonna forget washed ass Blake griffin was giving giannis trouble?
"&gt; healthy harden  That invalidates your entire argument. The dude was playing on one leg for 3 games.  Basically, out of the 14 possible healthy games he could have got from harden/Irving combined, he got 3. And were suppose to applaud giannis for winning? He was guarded by BLAKE FUCKING GRIFFIN. Jrue and PJ Tucker took turns swarming KD and nobody could help him. Did you see what joe Harris did?"
"My point is regardless of what did happen, that Nets team STILL should have won and its BS that people think the Bucks got it easy.  That team still won the 2 seed in the east.  They still had Blake Griffin, they still had the #1 3 point shooter in the NBA.  They still had DAnny Green, who shot 7/8 in a game 5 win from 3.  People act like the Bucks beat a team compromised of KD and 6 make a wish Kids.  Injuries suck, the Bucks just won a title starting a shooting guard who literally CAN'T shoot or score in PJ Tucker because our starting shooting guard was lost early in the 2nd game of the playoffs for the season."
I think Blake Griffin would have potential once he retires
Blake Griffin is pretty funny.
"Joe Harris was missing every shot he took, it’s debatable as to whether Blake Griffin is a starting caliber player most of the time, and Harden was injured and absolutely should not have been playing. Your descriptions of them are incredibly disingenuous."
“5 time all star Blake Griffin” in 2021? What are we doing here?   “One of James harden and Kyrie Irving?” Did you even bother watching the games after harden came back? He had a torn hamstring! They almost lost to a team whose second best player could barely walk!
111-109 Nets up with 1:25 left in OT gm7   Blake griffin gets his 6th foul and fouls out   Giannis post-up KD and gets easy bucket w 1:15 left. Middleton scores the next bucket and Bucks win by 2.   I think if Aldridge is there Giannis doesn't get an easy post-up.
Oof Blake Griffin 😂
Revisionist to say cavs werent a superteam. 3 allstars teamed up together. It doesnt matter that love wasnt good the finals. He was much better than majority of the other players in the east. He also avged 26/13 before joining cavs and was always considered an allstar. Cavs win if he plays in 2015 as well. Love was considered s top 2 pf alongside blake griffin when he joined the cavs.  Edit: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2016_preseason_odds.html  Cavs were huge faves for that reason at +280 odds. Much better than whiever was 2nd
"35 points are 35 points. Giannis did it with an all time great performance and Durant did it without scoring below 30 for the entire finals. And you are again ignoring the context lol. You claim that giannis did something kd never did and lead his team to the championship. Are we going to ignore who he faced? Are we going to pretend that the  nets with blake griffin as the second best player in the series, hawks with Trae missing for half the series or the phoenix suns are anywhere close to the teams that beat durant at okc? Durant had harder challenges than giannis. The heatles and the 73 win warriors. That's the context you're ignoring."
Lol Blake griffin was giving mans trouble down low too
"No no, before the nets series started Giannis decided to press the ""harden and kyrie get injured"" button because he knew we wouldn't beat them fully healthy. Then, to bring up the value of the ring, he chose the ""let me potentially tear my ACL, MCL, and PCL"" option in the hawks series.  If Giannis truly wanted the hardest road he would've cured lamarcus aldriges heart condition and also build a time machine to get back peak clippers Blake Griffin"
"Yes Kyrie wanted to show them he is Batman.Then he went to Celtics and did worse there as the first option than IT did. Now he went to the nets and if Blake Griffin becomes 90% of his peak,you could argue Kyrie is not even the Buttler."
Tell that to Blake griffin who got promised the world and was traded 3 months later
kd and a bunch of bums..? think you're forgetting the fact they had blake griffin and the nba 3P% leader but ok
"Bro kd had peg leg Harden, Blake Griffin and Joe ""what the fuck is a 3"" Harris.."
I honestly feel like Blake Griffin would fit very well with the bucks
The Blake Griffin special.
No qhat kind of excuse is that? The Bucks were playing terrible because the Nets matched up perfectly defensively with Blake Griffin and Kd. There's no way they take 2-3 games vs a fully healthy Nets team stop the recency bias nonsense
westbrook is not an mvp caliber player  like saying blake griffin is a dunk champion caliber player.
Blake Griffin to the pistons was outta nowhere
Blake Griffin fouled Pau Gasol on those two slams in 2012
That’s because The officials in Brooklyn refused to call fouls on Blake for some reason even the announcers were saying “that’s a foul on Blake Griffin” on Giannis drives. They allowed him to be more than physical so I guess if you’re allowed to flout anyone you’ll look good defensively but overall Giannis still ate. Once he got mad he started moving him and KD out the way like babies. He’s just too strong and he officially reaches the beginning of his prime next year. It’s gonna be scary.
"He was a great GM for the Nets this season. Recruited Harden, Blake Griffin, LMA, and brought Mike James in from Siberia."
Blake Griffin actually did a pretty good job in the Nets series
"Lmao now why would the wizards buy him out. Blake griffin tanked himself in Detroit, Russ nearly pulled an all nba team out of his ass here."
Westbrook buyout incoming. A la Blake Griffin
And another one where Blake Griffin was hurt.
"Keep ignoring context buddy. No hate on the Bucks btw. They did their job. But even Giannis said KD is the best. Man was serving 50 pieces to the Bucks with the ghost of Joe Harris, missing Kyrie half the series, the corpse of Blake Griffin, and wheelchair Harden  Oh and after coming back from an Achilles tear on top of that"
"Getting beaten to the spot and bumping a guy with your body isn't good defence. Also going up vertically isn't a get out of jail card, you have to beat the offensive player to the spot and then go up straight (which Ayton didn't do).   Tbh Ayton played awful defence against Giannis consistently (he was rarely in a defensive stance and gave away juicy angles to him) and relied on his athleticism to make up for his initial mistakes. Someone like Blake Griffin defended Giannis far better because was able to stay in a defensive stance, square his body to Giannis, and beat Giannis to his spots."
"I don’t think you really understood the Nets issue. They had NO one to generate offense other than KD. That’s why he had to play 48 minutes a game. Jeff Green / Blake Griffin all having those big games can be credited to Durant’s playmaking(mostly, especially Jeff). Meanwhile, Giannis had his team of playmakers and shot creators."
Blake Griffin
"I’m not letting that 2017 series off the hook. I get it, no Blake Griffin after Game 3. But we had no Gobert in Game 1 (went out early), and Hayward was out in Game 4 for the flu, and we won both those games. They were our 2 best players at that time, plus Hill and Favors were hurt the entire year. I give the Clips and CP3 0 passes for that year.  And 2012, that was the series were Pop intentionally fouled Blake and Jordan in Game 3, right? I was surprised teams didn’t do it to those Clips teams more often (well, not Blake, but Jordan)."
"KD was far and away the best player on the nets (and in the series) and was forced to carry in terms of scoring, rebounding, playmaking, clutch shots. He’s the main reason they won game 5 and nearly 7. The contributions from 34 year old Jeff green and Blake Griffin no doubt helped but it’s laughable to compare Giannis’ help to KDs. Therefore it seems as if KD nearly single handidly beat the bucks."
Meanwhile Giannis got taken to 7 by a Nets team with no Kyrie and a one legged Harden who started BLAKE GRIFFIN at Center..
"some of those challenges were quite funny tbh, e.g. he challenged blake griffin to stay healthy, anthony davis to demand a trade and derozan to ""to rekindle a lost friendship from your youth"""
"There’s an unbelievable amount of talk about “KD nearly beat the Bucks with no help” for a guy that didn’t actually win any games without help.   Game one he still had Kyrie, who was good, and Joe Harris’ one fantastic game of the series before he disappeared into the abyss. Game two was a great all-round performance from the Nets while the Bucks (including Giannis) disappeared and it’s the one real stain on Giannis’ performance this series. Game three nobody on the Nets was any good, including KD, and a couple of ok performances from Giannis and Middleton won an ugly game. That was his best chance to actually win without help, even with Kyrie there, and he had a fairly poor game.  Game four he was straight up not good and they lost again, not helped by Kyrie’s injury of course. Game five Jeff Green and Blake Griffin caught absolute fire, it was probably the best game of KD’s career and he deserves all the plaudits he gets for it but if a combined 44 points on 26 shots from those two isn’t help I don’t know what is. Game 6 they got eaten alive on the glass (not KD’s fault) and Middleton was spectacular so they dropped the game.  Then you get to game 7. A toe away from a famous win. He got a little bit of help but not anything especially noteworthy. Brown was good, Blake was good, but they weren’t exactly playing like stars. Thing is, Giannis got exactly the same. Lopez showed up, Connaughton and Tucker hit some threes, but Jrue and Middleton were **bad**. Combined 14/49 from the field bad. They both hit some clutch shots late so it didn’t seem so bad but they were absolute garbage for the majority of the game. There was not a lot of difference between their support casts, which is why it went to OT in the first place despite Giannis being phenomenal.  Seems like people are still judging this series on paper  and ignoring the realities of the series. It wasn’t KD, lone hero against an All Star big three. It was KD and Kyrie for half the series and then for the other half of the series they occasionally had role players stepping up to one degree or another, while two of the Bucks All Star big three struggled to hit a layup for most of the series and the role players were similarly inconsistent and mostly just ok."
"They are not a ""superteam"" but they are a super TEAM as in excellent cohesion.  They play so well together and I'm not sure anyone could have beaten this resilient squad.  Do not forget that KD scored 48 and 49 points and would not have posted those numbers if the Big 3 was playing he would have taken less shots.  Do not forget Blake Griffin shot over 50 percent and scored 20 ppg after Kyrie went down.  Do not forget Jeff Green went 7/8 from 3 pointers and was as good as any big 3 member in game 5 of the 2nd round.  So if the big 3 was healthy why exactly are they a lock to win??  Maybe Nets on paper they are better but are they a TEAM? Can they actually win together?  We haven't seen any proof of that even in the regular season lmaooo  Bucks win the title this season no matter what. MAYBE the Lakers could have won but I still think it's Bucks in 6 or 7.   Donte Divicenzo was an enormous loss. PJ Tucker was not close to being as good in his replacement spot. Donte is legit 3 and D AND he can rebound extremely well for a guard one of best in the game at that."
"Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan have been all stars more recently than Jrue Holiday, so by that logic KD had two all stars as well. Jeff Green had a better game than any game Jrue had in that series. Middleton wasn't even an all star this year either. Imagine talking about Giannis 'needing' anything in comparison to the dude that's only won after joining a 73-9 team lmao stop it"
"Lol, that moment you called 32 year old Blake Griffin old ass. He the same age as KD. 😭"
I mean it's rare for players of his size to be great in the first place. But it seems early in his career his  sidekick Blake Griffin was also injury prone so it sticks out more.
Blake Griffin too.
"I'm just gonna go ahead and say Giannis is 99% healthy and avoided damage. I get that he rushed coming back and **risked a lot**, but the dude is healthy as of now.  That's a credit to his superb talent and the shape he's in as well.  As a guy with bad knees I can see how it goes. If you have bad knees, you're gonna look like Blake Griffin. No injured player is gonna do what Giannis was doing on both sides of the floor."
"As an Oklahoma and Hawks fan, the hawks must assemble the infinity gauntlet of OU players. Trae, Buddy, Spencer, Blake griffin. And throw Baker out there to grab his junk for good measure"
"&gt;Blake  Griffin is not a sure-thing for the Hall.  He has 6 All-star appearances, which isn't quite enough to guarantee that call.  Most players with 6 or more are in, but some are not, like Shawn Kemp, Amar'e Stoudemire, and Jermaine O'Neal."
Blake Griffin LAC to Detriot
Dame tanking his value this game so he can be traded to the Nets for Blake Griffin and Joe Harris.
Bet he pulls a blake griffin come playoff time and winds back the clock tho
"I mean he played the majority of his big contract with the Spurs before demanding the trade. He signed a 4 year + player option max in summer 2015, had an amazing season in 2016 when they were one of the best defenses ever, 2017 another amazing season that ended with the Zaza injury, then was out most of 2018 with the quad issue.   These days, more stars leave as they approach their first UFA than stay. Guys that left/demanded a trade with one year left: Kawhi (Spurs to Raps/Clips), AD (NOLA to Lakers), Bron (Not 1, not 2 not 3), Chris Paul (NOLA to Clips), Butler (Bulls to Twolves wow that was only two years into his contract), Paul George (Pacers to OKC), Kyrie (Cavs to Celts), KD, etc  Guys that re-signed or extended heading into their first UFA: Giannis, Steph, Lillard, Harden, Westbrook, Blake Griffin (oof)  tl;dr: it's not unusual at all these days for guys to leave at their first UFA, I don't know why so many people expect these guys to stay when that hasn't been the pattern at all"
"I’ll say it for the final time: i understand why you want to sign a guy like this long term…but you cannot sign this dude long term. And if you do, Blake Griffin him.  Jesus."

"He looks after himself.  Putting your team interest before your own is bs.  I rather be a Kawhi than Blake Griffin.  Traded to a shitshow right after you reup.  Kawhi does what is best for him and doesn’t pretend otherwise.  He doesn’t have a TV special or run an article in Sports Illustrated that generates backlash.  I told my soldiers to put their interest above the military.  The results are each making six figures in civie jobs while their peers are still unhappy in the military.

"Yeah but Deandre Jordan, Blake Griffin, KD, Harden, and Kyrie with Lamarcus Aldridge possibly off the bench or starting is incredible also."
"That is true, but it's not like Brooklyn got no size. They have KD, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, and Claxton. Claxton could see a lot of minutes if they play the Lakers."
I mean I somewhat don't blame him.  He's probably more marketable right now to non basketball people than he is basketball people.  Look what happened to Blake Griffin in Detroit.
Remember everyone crying over BLAKE GRIFFIN. .
Or the Blake Griffin no dunking in Detroit strategy.
Modern medicine and training along with him not having a game that heavily relied on his athleticism.  Even then plenty of players that did heavily rely on athleticism have changed their games up to account for loss of it if they’ve had injuries (Derrick rose and Blake Griffin for example).
Ben simmon gonna pull a Blake Griffin specialty and  forgot how to dunk until he get traded
"Forget Josh Smith, the Pistons are paying Blake Griffin over $29 million this season. He's getting almost as much from Detroit this year as Kelly Olynyk and Jerami Grant combined."
Does Giannis get Kyrie to start the series as well and go up 2-0? Cuz Khris and Jrue were very bad to start the series. I can make an argument that Blake Griffin outperformed Jrue on the offensive end. Even the one game KD was able to win 'by himself' Jeff Green dropped 27 points and went 7-8 from 3 which is all star level production.
"This is ridiculous. I agree with what Blake Griffin said awhile back, he wants to be someplace that wants him in response to being on the Pistons. Likewise, if I was in Simmons situation, if there was a team that was legitimately interested in me, why wouldn't I go there if my original team wasn't a good fit anymore? Unlike regular people who get laid off or fired, Simmons doesn't have to look for want ads and go through job interviews.. all he has to do is go from one employment situation to another and just show up."
Honestly wish the NBA would implement a minimum playtime limit for losing rookie status like hockey and baseball have. You really mean to tell me that Ben Simmons and Blake Griffin are all that different from Julius Randle because Randle played 18 minutes of basketball in the first game of the season?
Or… he got the Blake Griffin special. Watch him ball out with the Lakers.
Blake Griffin is grandpa Joe confirmed
Except Blake Griffin. He's a pro
"Aside from all the ones mentioned 2009 doesn't look too bad. Sure you get Thabeet but you get Blake Griffin and James Harden as well.  Or 2012 Anthony Davis, MKG and Brad Beal."
"&gt;Blake Griffin finished 3rd in MVP one year.  To be fair, we are talking about getting 3rd in MVP voting in 1993 when many consider the NBA at it's best. Just think about all the hall of famers and players in their prime from that era that Pippen was considered more important and impactful to the team. Consider that the Bulls won 57 games (and the championship) the year Jordan retired to play baseball and the Pippen-led Bulls went on to win 55 games the following year. If you take LeBron off the 2011-2014 Heat, no way they even dream of winning 50 games. I'm not saying that to compare Jordan to LeBron, but rather to compare the teams and coach."
Blake Griffin?
You’re leaving out jokic and half of Blake Griffin
"Nets are likely above the Lakers. Patty Mills, Bruce Brown, Nic Claxton, Blake Griffin."
"If I understand correctly, Blake Griffin gave back $13.3M of $75M owed to him between two seasons. $4.3M was applied to last year and $8.7M is applied to this season. So Kemba can have a similar deal where let's say he gives back $20M of the $74M he is owed (OKC will pay him $54M). I am guessing OKC would prefer to pay him his full salary this season and $17M next season. Then Kemba will earn $8M from the Knicks this year as well."
"The details of it will come out, they always do  He just got bought out a day ago   It doesn't matter anyway this was so pointless, my entire point was that it doesn't always mean that a player makes back the same amount, a lot of players leave a lot on the table to do  what they want and join who they want, it's worth it to them especially to the likes of Blake Griffin, Kemba etc who have literally made over 150m"
"Well if it's true according to Shams that that Blake Griffin got paid $62m out of $75m guaranteed for his buyout, then I think Kemba probably did fine in a similar situation honestly.. and unlike Blake he may go on to earn more than the minimum in his next deals.  I think everyone is underestimating how much OKC/Pistons paid in these situations. Teams used to amnesty players like Luol Deng infamously, that means they literally paid the entire amount owed to the player plus the amount to the players signed using that new cap space. With Kemba/Blake, there isn't even a cap sheet impact in the player option year and both teams are bad and can choose to spend very little in the following year if they want to recoup their loss"
"I agree it depends on the negotiation, but it doesn't mean that the salary the player will make will cover the buyout, we have many examples of players leaving way more on the table and signing for a minimum  Blake Griffin, LMA literally did that last season, they left 8m on the table to sign for a minimum"
"It doesn't work like that, players sometimes do leave money on the table because they get it back in a few years not just one or they have a lot of it and just want out of that contract to play somewhere else     Blake Griffin left 13m on the buyout from the Pistons and signed for a minimum for the Nets"
"Blake Griffin finished 3rd in MVP one year. That doesn’t mean he was close to peak Wade.   Lebron went to the heat in 2010, not 2014. It would make sense to say that Wade, on average, was as good with Lebron as Pippen was with Jordan. It wouldn’t make sense to say he wasn’t better than Pippen when Lebron first went to Miami."
"It's not about ""who's been successful"", it's about Celtics players getting offers elsewhere and Boston deciding it's too much money. You don't know what will happen with a player after signing a contract. Robert Williams could get offered $20 million a year and Boston might think that's too much and he leaves, and then he goes on and outplays that deal.   Signing players is always a risk and Boston always balks at taking those risks. The problem is that even if they're proven right, that a player wasn't worth the contract they got, Boston still loses them as an asset. If the Clippers had thought the full max was too much for Blake Griffin (which would have been proven correct), then they wouldn't have had him to flip later on. It's cool to never overpay, but look all the assets the Celtics had back in 2018 and how few they have left. It's tough to replace all that."
"1. What do you mean ""another""? 2. What were they realistically supposed to get in the trade? Spencer Dinwiddie was a UFA who everyone knew was leaving. He could've just signed with a cap space team and the Nets would have gotten nothing.  3. That completely random Capela ""rumor"" by the random fan (not even some low-level writer, but literally just a random fan) on Twitter seems to have given people completely unrealistic expectations of what was going to happen. 4. The current roster includes Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, Patty Mills, Bruce Brown, and Nicolas Claxton. I think they'll be fine."
"Blake Griffin, surprisingly enough did a decent enough job on Giannis. Now imagine Aldridge"
exactly.   Stoudemire was a very similar player to Blake Griffin.  Played great with or without an all time great point guard  Joe Johnson would later become a top swingman and was a bench player on the suns.    Shawn Marion was the most defensively versatile player in the league at that time.  He basically defended every position except for Shaq.    Barbosa was a 6moty candidate  Boris Diaw was a point centre.  Raja Bell was good for 15 points and elite defence.  &amp;#x200B;  That team was fucking STACKED and would probably play for a chip today.
"Washed players I'm talking about are Melo, Aldridge, Dwight Howard and Blake Griffin."
The Blake Griffin effect
"That was not a player made superteam. They were a super team in spite of Malone, not because of it. It was obviously because they had Shaq and Kobe. Its like the Nets signing Blake Griffin. They already had the players to make them a superteam from drafting and trading, much different than 2 top 5 players and a top 15 player taking deals to join up in the prime of their career"
Blake Griffin was bought out for an even bigger contract. I think the Pistons only ended up saving $3.8 million
Blake Griffin is good enough to meaningful crunchtime playoff minutes lol
Blake Griffin
Blake and Taylor Griffin
Just use LeBron as a suped up Blake Griffin till the playoffs arrive lol
[It would be Andre Miller vs Blake Griffin 2.0](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nQrNYIBw3fw)
"How is this fair? Like, Knicks are getting Kemba as if he was a free agent. Same thing happened w Blake Griffin last season, lol. The whole buy outs needs to be reviewed, its completely flawed."
Ok let me tell you how it typically works. Kemba is owed like 35 million per year for two years.   Okc agrees to pay him 25 million per year for two years. And then any contract he signs for those two years gets deducted from the amount okc has to pay. So if he signed for 8 million with the knicks okc would only have to pay him 17 million per year. That 10 million per year given up in the buyout is typically just gone   That’s what happened with Blake griffin and lamarcus Aldridge. It’s what has happened with every buyout I’ve seen.
Blake Griffin being an established star on the Clippers before the Chris Paul trade. Paul was traded right after Griffin's rookie season. So he basically always played with CP3. I thought he had a few years as an all star and CP3 put them over the hump from middle of the pack team to championship contenders.
"not blake griffin or drummond lol, they got the min  but for whatever reason the pistons decided to do blake a huge favor and give him his entire salary for this upcoming year  blake gave back 13m of the 75m he was owed so pistons paid him a max contract last year and this year to play for the nets"
"I'm so curious about these mega 1 guaranteed + 1 player option buyout deals.  With Blake Griffin and now with Kemba, I always found it hard to believe these guys would give up their entire player option guaranteed amount just so they could play for another team. I've always thought that Pistons/OKC actually paid a good chunk of that player option year, maybe like 50% or something, and of course in exchange the Pistons/OKC don't have to worry about them opting in. If Blake/Kemba actually gave up the entire option though, man props to them. I'd really love to know what they got."
"I mean youre going to add all sorts of qualifiers to try and defend what would have been duplicitous behaviour from your GM - I mean thats the whole point that started this comment thread....how you guys are so protective of Griffin that you will go out on a limb to protect anything he does.  If youre going to be intellectually dishonest and say (i assume) JJ didnt deserve that because he is not a former allstar like Lamarcus or Blake (keep in mind this fact makes it that he would be a much easier buy out candidate than those guys because of his smaller contract figure)...then how about all the other non former allstars e.g Anthony Tolliver, Marvin Williams, MKG whose teams bought out their contracts so they could join other teams?  I mean OKC which never buys out contracts just bought out Kemba with 73 million remaining on his deal and yall couldnt buy out Reddick with 13 million remaining on his?"
"Yeah, you got yourself a great team with total buy in from the star. Get back to me in a couple years when your team is total trash and Griffin is on the chopping block for signing Blake Griffin"
Blake griffin is an asshole in real life.
Pat bev and Blake griffin
"Being the 5th option on a championship team after years of being a star doesn't do much for your legacy. If Blake Griffin wins a championship in Brooklyn will it erase all the years of losing in LA and Detroit. I don't think the fans are the ones who kill guys for being loyal and ringless, it's the media and the media has a lot of takes fans dont agree with."
"It’s definitely gonna be fun to watch. I get that it’s not always successful (looking at Pistons experiment with Blake Griffin as an example), BUT, sports teams are competing for the fans and their city.   It’s nice to see the Bulls organization putting in a lot of work this off-season to make a difference.  Plus, I’m a little bias being a Laker fan - I want to see Zo and Caruso ball out."
"While I completely agree, you can argue what he said about the Clippers is also true after what Ballmer did to Blake Griffin."
Prime Blake Griffin could run an offense and get you 6 APG. Did y’all not watch basketball in 2014?   AD doesn’t run an offense. Blake could
"Best part is there's 3 types of comments: ones made after he went to golden state, ones made when Blake Griffin and Lamarcus were joining the nets, and ones made recently"
Blake Griffin finished 3rd in MVP voting in 2014 for a reason
"Imagine a Lakers-Nets final next year featuring LeBron, AD, Westbrook, KD, Harden, and Kyrie.   Can throw in Gasol, Melo, Blake Griffin, and Dwight Howard for name value too.   What a star-studded matchup that would be. Storylines everywhere."
How are they more complete than the nets ? Joe Harris and Blake griffin are by far the best 4th and 5th guys of any team in the league.
"I think he's pulling a Blake Griffin. Protecting himself by applying minimal effort until he gets to a team where winning is worth putting himself at risk for injury. Selfish, but smart."

"Because Blake Griffin pretended to be injured for a year to convince the Pistons to buy him out, then miraculously recovered to be effective again."
This is highkey true which is why I don’t get why everyone is so insistent that it’s such a lock for the Nets to steamroll everything. Kyrie I don’t think has ever played a full season even in college. KD has seen his body start to break down more since 2014. Harden’s hamstring injury is still lingering. Blake Griffin is bound to crumble like Dorito chips once a season &amp; the fact that he’s being counted on as a serious rotational player is baffling to me. It is not a lock by any means.
"No the Nets have Patty Mille and Blake Griffin coming off the bench, two of the premier role players in the league."
"I mean that's how he finished that season, I think it was better before voting actually happened.  Also that was the season where they traded for Blake Griffin, so his role changed at that point."
It’s hype when LeBron forms a superteam but KD recruits Harden and a washed Blake Griffin and everyone loses their minds
only way it happens is if he gets bought out and signed by the lakers for the minimum like Blake Griffin did with the Nets
How much help does Blake Griffin need?! O:
Nets aren’t really old af.  James Harden: 31 - was an mvp candidate when healthy  Kevin Durant 32 - arguably best player in the league Kyrie - 29  All are 32 or younger and aren’t coming off a season where you question if they’re past their prime.  Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan are the only 2 who really fit that bill and Jordan doesn’t play.
He really grifted the Pistons man I'm sick  I am officially the world's biggest Blake Griffin hater

Dude did you watch last season? Players like harris brown green shamet and griffin were feasting. With these three guys on the court every shot is an open shot. Look at the stats from all the role players. They have high shooting percentages. And you could clearly see how hyped they were for each other for example as blake finally dunked again. And its also a good business decision. Look at green he suddenly gets a two year deal at his age for 9 mil. Thats what you get when you perform on a higher stage.  There is literally no ego on that team. Hardens the facilitator and kyrie and KD the scorers. And both know KD is that guy who gets the ball.
1. Isiah Thomas 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Tracy McGrady 5. Paul Pierce 6. Blake Griffin 7. Chris Webber 8. Dennis Rodman 9. Dikembe Mutombo 10. Rasheed Wallace
Blake Griffin did it
If thats the case i hope he's like a Blake griffin and has just been holding bak since he's on non contender
Blake Griffin was an anomaly. You wait until Love is an expiring contract and try to trade him. If you cant then you buy him out
"Blake griffin just did this, it’s more than possible."
I think Blake Griffin defended Giannis better than Bam tbh
"Love Jeff, but realistically we only needed one of him or Blake Griffin. I guess this means Blake is the priority."
Who do the Nets have outside the big 3 that makes them considered more stacked than Lakers? Blake Griffin?
I'm gonna hold my tongue until I see a player look washed on a championship contender. Look at Batum and Blake Griffin this past year.
"Cus Spurs always have good role players. Lol pistons were terrible this past decade but so many of our ex-players contributed in the playoffs this year. Reggie Jackson, Blake griffin, Bruce brown, luke kennard, Andre Drummond (kinda), KCP, Derrick rose, Reggie bullock."
"Cus Spurs always have good role players. Lol pistons were terrible this past decade but so many of our ex-players contributed in the playoffs this year. Reggie Jackson, Blake griffin, Bruce brown, luke kennard, Andre Drummond (kinda), KCP, Derrick rose, Reggie bullock."
"Blake is still getting paid $30M from Detroit next season, so any salary he makes will be taken out of that. Unless he is looking for a multi-year deal, if he comes back, there's no reason for him to take anything but the minimum from Brooklyn.  I think OPJ for the MLE and Griffin for the vet's minimum look like good probabilities. I don't know about the Forbes rumors, they seem to have come out of nowhere. It definitely *seems* like Jeff Green is gone, but it wouldn't totally shock me if he decided to stay in BK for the minimum. I don't think it's especially likely, but I think it is a possibility."
"Washed? He averaged a triple double this season? Washed is what you would call Blake griffin at the moment, not Russ"
"And Christ Paul last year made more money ($41,358,814) than he, Blake Griffin, and Deandre Jordan made combined in their first season together on the LA Clippers ($32,170,289)"
The funniest shit of all time is Blake Griffin being the best Giannis defender in the playoffs despite Giannis facing way better team defenses and individual defenders throughout the playoffs
"1.5 + 1.5 = 3  15 - 3 = 12  Where is he making up 12 million? Don't give me 'outside sources', nobody in LA or anywhere is paying kevin love at 35 being the 12th guy off the bench big money to be in their trader joe commercials. How many blake griffin commercials have you seen? he was a bigger star then love ever was  next year he can give up that hypothetical 7.5, and only lose 3-4 mil."
Although it could be a similar situation to Blake Griffin where being on a contender brings out his best
Blake Griffin:  Willy Wonka faking injury scene
Yup. He’s not Blake Griffin
"Absolutely true I'm not saying he *should* care, and tbh I don't think he would have a Blake Griffin type impact on a team anyway. So a buyout might lead him to lose money and be unplayable on a contender."
"They definitely don't want him to take a Kemba paycut lol, Kemba was in a situation where he wanted to leave but OKC would've been perfectly fine keeping him. Blake Griffin is a more reasonable comp since that was a mutually beneficial parting and he gave back a little over 13 million."
"Blake Griffin on the Nets, but worse"
And he already has a NBA title.  He likely isn't as thirsty for a championship as some vets like Blake Griffin who went for a buy-out.
Blake Griffin   Shawn Kemp  Shaquille O’Neal   Deandre Jordan  LeBron James   Russell Westbrook   ————————  I have the more slimmer athletic guys in a different category: Jordan/David Thompson/Dominique/Vince Carter/ Dr.J   Westbrook is the only smaller guy in the first category
Blake griffin was probably one of the top 3 in-game dunkers in history. He was so fun to watch
"Without Blake Griffin, the Nets would have been blown out by the Bucks.  He started all 7 games, played 3rd most minutes in the series by a BKN player, good shooting percentages, and put up 12.5pts &amp; 8rebs.  BKN got a solid 3rd/4th option to deepen the bench for way below market value."
"What accolade does CP have tho? No MVPs? 1 finals appearance. Shawn Kemp was nothing more than an aggressive, more durable Blake Griffin. GP is an underrated scorer but the gap between them in scoring isn’t as significant as the gap they have in Defense and accolades. So what if the east was weak? He still made them. It would make him worse if he had a weak east and didn’t make the finals. Yea CP was a better scorer than J kidd. But JKidd was better in so much areas than CP. Defense, playmaking ( can go both ways). The Kyrie and CP argument, to your credit would be a good argument but I would rather take a good player with a ring than the good player with 1. The only reason I used the Scoring &gt; Passing argument with Kyrie and CP is they are both focused one one aspect only offensively. CP looks to pass first while Kyrie looks to score first. CP has the skills to be a great scorer but chooses not to, to his detriment. The Russ one, stats and accolades and durability beats the gap in scoring skills and playmaking.   Face it. CP has achieved nothing outside his recent finals run. No excuses."
"Blake Griffin is the Brooklyn Nets' starting C and spent a some of the series against the Bucks' being the second best player on the team. Andre Drummond is 28 and signing with a new team. Kevin Love is still a player most teams would want on a minimum. LaMarcus Aldridge was good, and I don't think we can treat his retirement due to heart problems as typical.  Maybe bought out player used to be a waste, but that wasn't the case last season and it wouldn't be the case with Kevin Love especially since some of his poor play so clearly comes from the level of effort."
I’d encourage you to make a list. Blake Griffin is on a very very short list
"We're forgetting Blake Griffin? LaMarcus Aldridge wasn't exactly nothing, and only wasn't their starting C because of a heart problem."
"The problem is that I think teams will still do it because it's still better for them; from a Pistons perspective, buying out Blake Griffin was the right thing to do."
"maybe he is the reason why KD left. :^)  on a serious note, shit, Blake Griffin dunks were such a treat to watch. So much upper body strength and great athleticism + leaps. I still remember that dunk he did on OKC Ibaka. Fucking vicious. I still hate his elbow to the face ""poster"" dunk on Gasol tho."
"Well considering Shawn Kemp isn't even their best player and Blake Griffin was really fucking good and the Lob City teams could've easily won a title you're not saying as much as you think you are with this comment. lol  Also Seattle had a very inventive defense back in the 90s and uber athleticism, in a weird way they are kind of ahead of their time."
"Paying a guy who hates being there, the coach, the young players and probably the FO for not trading him has 0 value really. Even if they do a Blake Griffin type buyout it's probably way better than him sitting out 2 years just for the culture."
"To my mind comes OLD Kevin Garnett in his last stint with Timberwolves, blocking a Blake Griffin jam."
That's what everyone said about Blake Griffin too 🙄
There is a cap for it i believe. Blake griffin in his prime was only paying 200k a yr
"uh injured James Harden and Blake Griffin vs Jrue Holiday Khris Middleton and tbh Brook Lopez playing better than Blake too is not ""even"""
"That's exactly right.  I'm assuming here that the Cavs think he's worth more than $4M/yr to them.  If not, it would be just like the Blake Griffin buyout.  Nets are paying him $2.6M this year.  Pistons are paying him $29M - $2.6M.  My point is that these buyouts aren't that frequent even though both teams and players would like to do it more often because of this math."
"It's called not wanting to be there. Blake Griffin is the obvious example that comes to mind, but I'm pretty sure millions of people go through something similar on a daily basis. You literally stop caring in the worse way possible."
"If they pick him up on a Vet Min (which would be typical after a buyout) I’m sure they’d only play him in matchups where his skill sets make sense (again, like Blake Griffin). They wouldn’t be paying him big money so they’d only play him in minutes where it makes sense.   He’s still a highly capable rebounder and passer with a good outside shot, and given some matchups for the lakers, that’s big"
"How would picking up a Vet backup PF/C who can stretch the floor make them worse? Clearly he’s not who he used to be, but with a title contender I’m sure he’ll have motivation to play better within a role (see current Blake Griffin)"
"I think for Love it really depends on how much passion he still has for the game. If he's kinda over it and just wants to retire, then he won't give anything back. But if he's looking for playing time or wants to be in a winning team again, then maybe it's worth it to give up some money to play again. We've seen LMA, Blake Griffin and Kemba Walker give up a bunch of money to go play elsewhere rather than stay either in a small role or on a bad team (or both). Luol Deng gave the Lakers back $7 million just so he could try to get signed by another team and play again. It just depends on what Love wants."
"Blake turned into an energy guy that actually can play some defense.   I can never see Love being that. Dude is lazy, sucks on d, and is always hurt.   Guess it wouldn’t hurt to get him, but I don’t think it’s possible he’ll be as good as griffin"
"What? The Lakers would love to have Love. He’s in the same situation Blake Griffin was. He looks bad because he’s on a rebuilding team not contending. You throw him on the Lakers with LeBron, AD, Russ and Ariza maybe and that’s a good 5. The Lakers would gain another floor spacer who can pass and stretch the floor also. Plus AD, Dwight, and LeBron can help him on defense."
"&gt;Amar'e is another  Yeah, I considered him and Blake Griffin as well. And maybe Antonio McDyess for good measure."
Blake Griffin crawling out of the Life Alert facility in Detroit and turning into Omni-Man lite in Brooklyn.
"The more important question is why do people keep thinking just because Love is physically there that our future should in anyway include him? He is here for 2 years max cause of a ""Thank you"" contract, often injured, salty attitude. It makes no sense to account for Love. Same way it wouldn't have made sense for Detroit to factor in Blake Griffin or San Antonio with Aldridge in to their future plans."
Blake Griffin?
"Nobody is gonna trade for him, they're gonna have to Blake griffin him if they want him gone."
"So we're horrible people because we got back a good return? We sent him to a better situation in Cleveland with Lebron James and on a championship contender.  It isn't like we sent him to play with the Pistons or something like the Clippers did to Blake Griffin. We weren't going to pay IT the max dollars he was asking for so why would we keep him on our team, especially when we're getting the one of the most skilled players to ever play this game in return?"
"Larry nance jr , Aaron Gordon, Blake griffin self explanatory"
I wish there was some rule against that Blake Griffin elbow on dunk attempts
"If I believed that Simmons wanted to be in SA, and be willing to learn from Pop, Chip and the other coaches - then I would be happy for the Spurs to get Ben at a ""reasonable"" cost (let's say one of White/Murray and another 1, or maybe 2, middling assets - out of Walker, Young or a protected FRP).  And for me, that ""work"" is not even about a jumpshot. Its much more realistic in the half-court to make him a weapon out of the high post.  (Some sort of mix between early Blake Griffin and Draymond).  But at this point I have massive doubts that Simmons would buy in to any of that, and not just turn around and try to force his way elsewhere. Unless PATFO are really convinced by Ben, his camp, and those that know him well (I'm sure they would have spoken to Brett Brown), I just don't think he's worth the risk of giving up anything of real value."
"Harden likely wouldn’t have played if Kyrie was still healthy, for a start.  Of course I’m making assumptions, the whole topic is nothing but assumptions. Assuming the Bucks play such garbage offence that back to back 85 point games are par for the course instead of wildly improving like they did from games 4-7. Assuming Jeff Green and Blake Griffin still combine for 44 points on 15/22 shooting while KD has arguably the best game of his career in game 5. Assuming KD still puts up the same kind of numbers when he’s got Kyrie to take more shots. Assuming Jrue still can’t score the whole time. Assuming Middleton continues playing like hot ass every time he goes to Brooklyn. And so on.  If the question is “Hey if the Nets had Kyrie and he just scored all the bad shots other guys missed instead of the good ones they hit and also the Bucks don’t play differently in any way at all do the Nets win?” then the answer is probably yes, but that’s also just not how basketball works. If we’re going to talk hypotheticals let’s talk, just going “Ah well actually all those hypotheticals in your favour are a bridge too far while the ones in their favour are definitely legit” dilutes the conversation to the point of meaninglessness."
Saw someone else say it but definitely Shawn Kemp.    Blake Griffin and Steve Francis too
Don’t forget young Blake Griffin
First KAT wouldn’t sign off on this   Second Dlo isn’t that big of an improvement over Simmons  Yeh he can shoot the ball but his intangibles and defense and most of the time effort just isn’t there   Simmons to Dame is an upgrade   Simmons to Dlo is a downgrade   Is Simmons worth less than Wiseman and Wiggins aka what DLo was traded for?   I’d say so. Some will disagree but just Bc it didn’t work in Philly doesn’t mean it won’t somewhere else   Effort matters so does the right environment even with veterans as we saw with Blake Griffin when he left Detroit for Brooklyn.
Blake Griffin -&gt; miles bridges-&gt; Aaron Gordon. Unfortunately Blake devolved :/
"Alright man, you said ‘he did not even play for months’ which is ridiculous.  So what if his minutes got replaced because the nets were able to pick up Blake griffin and LMA mid season, a lot of role players would sit for those guys too."
"If Rondo goes to the Lakers, the only active starter from the 2013 All Star game to not be on the Lakers/Nets is Chris Paul.  &amp;#x200B;  |EAST|WEST| |:-|:-| |Rajon Rondo - Lakers|**Chris Paul - Suns**| |Dwyane Wade - Retired|Kobe Bryant - Retired :(| |LeBron James - Lakers|Kevin Durant - Nets| |Carmelo Anthony - Lakers|Blake Griffin - Nets| |Kevin Garnett - Retired|Dwight Howard - Lakers|"
blake griffin imo
"Then show me a single clip of any of these 30 players doing this move.  Curry, Harden, Kyrie, Lebron, Lillard, Randle, Trae, Fox, Sexton,Ingram, Westbrook, Beal, CP3, Ja Morant, Lowry, Middleton, Rubio,Simmons, Kawhi, Lavine, Campazzo, Conley, Lonzo, Lamelo, Carmelo, McCollum, Blake Griffin, Tony Parker, Patty Mills or Rajon Rondo.  If everyone is doing it all the time then finding a single clip shouldn't be hard."
"dang. i always mention him to my friends who are casual fans. i tell them the nets have kevin durant, james harden, kyrie irving, blake griffin, *and* deandre jordan. he's the cherry on top as my friends get mindf*cked"
Blake griffin
Blake Griffin transformed quite a bit. Especially as he relied less on his athleticism and more on his jump shooting.
Blake Griffin
"I don't believe WS/Year is the best metric, and it shows at both ends of the spectrum, with Anthony Edwards, and Dwight Howard.  Who at the ends of their carrer weren't powerhouses.  You don't draft 1st  picks for them to be ""decent career long contributors"" You draft them to put you over the top.  We judge stars and busts largely based on how they were at their peak.  Your ranking drags down guys like Howard a lot simply because they are playing past their peak.  And it overvalues guys like Bogut for average play for a long time.  A guy like Ben Simmons shouldn't be ranked above Blake Griffin.  Simmons' best year would be Blake's 5th best. Simmons' 3rd best year would be Blake's 8th best year.  We still debate if Simmons is a bust.  Nobody does that with Blake.   Yeah, Simmons hasn't played as long, but his peak isn't close to Blake's.     IMO, the better measure is something like Baseball's [JAWS](https://www.mlb.com/glossary/miscellaneous/jaws) (for evaluating HOF)  Thus a simple metric might be    - Average WS of best 6 seasons   Or    - (Average WS of best 6 seasons  + TOTAL Carrer WS) / 2  Depending on how much weight *longevity* has in your mind for determining a bust."
"Not sure if Blake Griffin is an automatic HOF player, not sure he gets in either if he wins in  Brooklyn as a #6 option."
"Teams have turned Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook, and John Wall’s max contracts into positive assets… you’re going to tell me that Ben Simmons is a negative?"
I once dreamed that Blake Griffin died. I woke up and was sad as shit for like 5 mins before i realized it wasn't real
"Still got this on my copy/paste from another thread.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQrNYIBw3fw  Blake Griffin was being a dick.  Andre Miller bullet trained his ass and got suspended, breaking an NBA leading ironman streak."
&gt; Andre Miller  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQrNYIBw3fw  Never forget the time Miller lost his streak of playing 632 games in a row for bullet training Blake Griffin after he got tired of Blake's dirty shit.
"&gt; Your tanking was more blatant with Presti’s trades to stockpile picks, bench perfectly playable players like Horford, etc  … The Pistons did the exact same thing with Blake Griffin and got no hate from it from this sub just n FYI. They also benched Jerami Grant towards end the season and the Raptors benched a lot of their players to end the season as well. Weirdly, the Thunder got a lot of backlash from people for benching Horford when other teams did the same shit and no one cared.   &gt;And Kuminga was supposed to be a long term prospect but even then he already looks better than Giddey, so if you wanna develop quicker to make SGA happy you might have made some wrong choices.  Well I hope he looks better than a guy who only played 5 minutes in the SUMMER LEAGUE. Also, Kuminga flashed some nice potential in summer league but let’s not act like the dudes shooting splits weren’t 39/27/65.   &gt;Obviously nothing’s guaranteed, but you guys mortgaged everything for these picks, you couldn’t even trade up to get the best prospects in a stacked draft class you should be investing heavily in and you couldn’t even take Kuminga.  Well it takes two teams to make a trade dude lmaooo. Which team in the top 5 could the Thunder realistically make a trade with without giving up SGA? Also, Kuminga dropped out of the “consensus” top 5 for a reason. Like I said already, none of these rookies have played in the league so saying the Thunder should’ve picked Kuminga is weird when Giddey has a chance to be a better player than him."
Pistons  1. Derrick Rose  2. Blake Griffin 3. Khris Middleton  4. Tobias Harris 5. Spencer Dinwiddie   Bench: Reggie Jackson
Blake Griffin can't dunk anymore.
"I'm not sure how you could possibly call a team with two superstars a superteam. We don't want to keep diluting that term. The Heat definitely were, but Love was not a superstar on the Cavs (just look at the numbers and watch the games. He wasn't a super high impact player on most nights). AD is very obviously a superstar but nobody else on the Lakers team even sniffed that level.  It takes 3 superstars to make a superteam. The Warriors with KD and now the Nets and arguably the current Lakers are superteams. Nobody else in the league is stacked like that. In the same vein I wouldn't call the Clippers a superteam at any point either, the current iteration or the old CP3/Blake Griffin team."
"He can't guard 5s like that, in rare instances and switches sure but not all game and like for example centers used to do in the earlier eras  The 5s he's played against have not been great post up players, mostly small ball players or centers like Capela, Gobert who can't do anything offensively but lobs  Look at Draymond vs good post offensive players in the playoffs:  AD averaged 32/11 in his first series against Dray, 28/11 in his second  Blake Griffin averaged 23ppg on 50% shooting, LMA averaged 23/9 on 60% TS against him, Harrell averaged 18ppg on 74% TS againts him etc    He's versatile but he was fortunate enough that his skillset was perfect for small ball, in Dray's prime 2014-2018 defensively post up centers were rare and you had DeAndre Jordan making all NBA and Drummond"
"OP is adding up to 75. Not top 50.  With that said, Mutumbo is definitely not on that list. And I'd even argue T Mac shouldn't be on there either.  Notable players not in OPs top 25 since 1997:  - Anthony Davis - Paul George - Jimmy Butler - Paul Pierce - Kyrie Irving - Pau Gasol - Chris Bosh - Tony Parker - Manu Ginobili - Blake Griffin"
It's all fun and games until Blake Griffin drives onto the court in a Kia
"&gt; I don’t think an empty 14/5/2 in Detroit along with the DUI’s was going to get him paid again  There's no real chance he actually finishes out that contract with Detroit.  Go back and look at those teams, with Stan Van and later the acquisition of Blake Griffin.   KCP would have been included in that trade, and would be with the Clippers.   Even if he hadn't (I think he would have been prioritized more in Detroit , but still underwhelmed relative to his contract initially,) he would have been traded at some point.  After that it's too much butterfly effect.  He's earned enough over his career that $15m won't matter much, and yeah that ring will help (but not as much as Danny Green got).  Danny Green was a multiple time champion on different teams, not that far from being Finals MVP a bigger 3&amp;D player and was putting himself out to contenders for money, with short term contracts. Not everyone is getting Danny Green money  KCP is taking longer contracts for his next contract (my bet) and thus will accept less per year than if he just wanted to pimp himself out."
"If you choose to close out on someone you’re not supposed to then yes it’s gonna break down. Doubling can lead to scrambling but you don’t need to close out on every single guy open on the perimeter. You recognize the 3pt threats and stay on them.   Also In case you weren’t watching, Joe Harris found himself open plenty of times without any doubling and bricked the majority of them  But yeah don’t double the guy giving you 40 a night because you don’t want Blake griffin or Jeff green taking open 3’s lmao. They LITERALLY almost lost the series because they didn’t double. If they doubled kd wouldn’t have been able to turn and fade like that"
"If Joe Harris gets into a shooting rhythm because he's wide open off of KD doubles, Nets win the series. Blake Griffin could also feast off of the additional openings. He's still very good when healthy, and he was perfectly healthy. And KD wouldn't have been significantly slowed down by a double, he'd still get his. You're flat out wrong."
Blake Griffin went bananas in a couple of his rookie games. Think one was vs Knicks
"Cade Cunningham will be better than Michael Jordan  Luka Doncic will be better than Cade Cunningham  Anthony Davis fakes injuries during bad games so that he can get high in the locker room   Blake Griffin is a serial killer  Kawhi didn't choke against the Nuggets, his knees couldn't handle the strain and he'll never get passed the 2nd round without copious amounts of rest during the playoffs   From watching Harlem Globetrotter games in the 70s, I can tell that NBA players back then were certainly capable of being great ball handlers by today's standards, and not untalented white dudes who couldn't dribble like people on here say. Frankly, the strict rules did not allow them to do things with the ball that players are allowed to do now.   Steph Curry's foot fetish is breaking his family apart  Fox is a future superstar because he's an insanely efficient finisher for a point guard; he's just too good at the rim  When Zion plays in the 2024 Olympics, it's over. His game is absolutely made for Olympic ball. He brings the finishing and physicality that no one on Team USA had."
How was that a brilliant move? They literally almost the lost the series by a foot on the line because they wouldn’t double him. You had harden who couldn’t even run and Blake griffin and you still don’t double?   It quite literally almost cost them the series. Stupid decision
"""What if"" PJ Tucker hadn't fouled out because Blake Griffin was grappling him off ball? ""What if"" a foul had been called when Jeff Green has holding down Lopez' arms with the ball? Bucks won so it's been forgotten, but the officiating was horribly one-sided. If KD's foot had been an inch back there'd be integrity of the game conversations."
"I mean idk man it probably would have just been smarter to let harden on 1 leg and blake griffin beat you. It worked out so i guess i cant talk too much but they played rough af against the nets imo. However the suns and hawks series he coached great, especially the suns down 2-0 they kinda just crushed em. Especially the jrue defense matchups."
"No shit. But you don’t assemble a team with Kyrie Irving, KD off an Achilles tear, and Blake Griffin getting huge minutes expecting for everyone to be healthy."
Trying to convince fellow Pistons fans years ago that our core wasn't good enough to compete BEFORE we even traded a lottery pick for Blake Griffin and then the entire friggin' time we had him. No shortage of replies in my inbox telling me that I'm an idiot because I didn't think making the eighth seed was better than tanking a year for a high draft pick. It's been a good summer.
Nutmegged Blake Griffin
"Woof Blake Griffin really fell off a cliff. Also big lol at jahlil okafor even at the time what dingus saw that antiquated ass game and thought, yup future all-NBA guy right there"
"I traded Goran Dragic for TJ Warren and TJ McConnell  Then I traded Siakam and FVV for KD, Blake Griffin and a FRP   would recommend."
Clippers:  Chris Paul  Paul George  Kawhi Leonard  Blake Griffin  Chris Kaman
Blake Griffin is the strangest pick for me. His skill set was based 100% on athleticism. He’s evolved to be a serviceable role player but dang that’s too high.
"I always loved Cousins since his early days but never ever would he have been top 3. There is a difference in a player like KD and a few others on this list, such as Blake Griffin.   With Blake I thought he would decline like LMA/Millsap but that's not even the case either."
"   1. Anthony Davis. Pretty close, AD has been a solid top 10 player for a few years now.    2. Andrew Wiggins. One of the only ones where there's no injury excuse for why the player isn't as good as predicted.    3. DeMarcus Cousins. DeMarcus could be here if it wasnt for his injuries.    4. Kevin Durant. Pretty good Guess, they probably taught KD would have regressed a bit by now, which he hasn't, since he's almost consensus top 2 player right now.    5. Russell Westbrook. Wrong, but not that insane, I guess Russ would be in the 20-30 range.    6. Kyrie Irving. Pretty close, since he's considered about top 10 right, would be higher if he wasn't injured all the time.    7. Blake Griffin. Way off because of injuries.    8. Stephen Curry. Pretty close,    9. Paul George. Also really close, actually this might be spot on in my eyes.    10. James Harden. Pretty close.    11. Giannis Antetokounmpo. Kind of close.    12. Klay Thompson. I would say spot on if we assume Klay is as good as the last time we saw him.    13. Karl-Anthony Towns. Honestly, for me this is right where Kat belongs, except he's on Timberwolves. I know some people rank him like top25 which is insane to me.    14. Andre Drummond. Way off.    15. Bradley Beal. Really good guess.    16. John Wall. Could be correct if not for the injuries.    17. DeAndre Jordan. Way off    18. Jahlil Okafor. Way off.    19. Dragan Bender. Lol.    20. Jaylen Brown. Spot on Id say.      So to summarise,   Incorrect because of injuries - Demarcus, Blake, John Wall.   Spot on - KD, PG13, Klay, Kat, Bradley, Jaylen Brown.   Way off with no injury excuse - Wiggins, maybe Westbrook?, Drummond, Jordan, Okafor, Bender.   ​"
If Blake Griffin didn't get injured he could've been a 99c Kobe Bryant.
"Hayward and Kemba? Hayward left despite the Celtics wanting him to stay, but yes to be fair Kemba didn't leave on his own volition. There was stuff about Blake Griffin thinking about playing for the Celtics after his buyout, but an anonymous Celtics player advised against it. Kyrie was clearly unhappy playing in Boston, the Isaiah Thomas trade clearly put people off since AD's dad was out saying he didn't want him to play in Boston - and for the same guy AD's agent was also warning the Celtics against trading for him, since in his words; ""They can trade for him, but it'll be for one year.""  I'm not saying they *can't* get free agents, or players to stick around, but they're the Boston Celtics - they've won 17 championships. They shouldn't be this tough to sell to players."
"Jamal Murray, Ben Simmons, Blake Griffin. I’m gonna guess 25, 15/0 and 23."
"Although they became teammates, Lebron and Lance Stephenson talking about their playoff battles (unless they already talked about in LA). On a similar note, Lebron and Joakim Noah  Zach Randolph and Blake Griffin  Shaquille O'Neal and Dwight Howard  Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, and, Russell Westbrook, to get the real scoop"
"Why stop at 2? I want to see D’Lo, Jordan Clarkson, Blake Griffin, Ben Simmons, and Devin Booker mix it up in a segment all about dating Kendall Jenner.  Also, it’s funny how Blake Griffin stands out so much in that list, but he’s only 3 years older than Clarkson."
"Yeah he looked washed in the 2011 playoffs. Crazy to watch him then playing against Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol, and then to watch him in 2015 against DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin. Despite being 4 years older he was much more effective and was his team's #1 offensive weapon for half of that series plus sealed one of the wins by stuffing a Griffin dunk attempt and then stripping him of the ball."
"Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, Marc Gasol, Blake Griffin, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan and LaMarcus Aldridge (maybe) will be split among 2 teams."
"Blake Griffin is not the same player as he was at the beginning of his Detroit tenure, but he played great for Brooklyn last season and he’s signed to a vet min."
"Lol no shit, you better be winning when you got Harden and Kyrie and Blake Griffin to try and give KD the excessive help he needs to do anything. Curry won without KD. KD hasn't done shit. No more argument to be made."
"Blake Griffin is a great hustler. Rebounding like prime Dwight. Watching that series, his will was just near unmatched (other than KD of course). You need 15/15? No problem, Blake’s there. Need good defense on Giannis? No problem, Blake’s there.  That team makes me mad with how good they are."
Kemba Walker  Tacko Fall  Magic Johnson  Reggie Miller  Jason Kidd  Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin. Don’t know why but his fucking face just screamed LA. But when he evolved his game by adding a serviceable three point shot and showed a hell of a lot grit in Detroit I just couldn’t help but like him.
"As a Grizzlies fan, Blake Griffin but now I can respect his game and his old highlights/battles"
Probably Blake Griffin at this point.
"Blake Griffin  I hated Blake a lot in lob city, then loved him during his all-NBA season with us, then hated him again after that"
"Blake Griffin.  Came across as whiny, soft, one dimensional game. He gave everything for the clippers only to be betrayed. When he went to Detroit, he continued to play with heart even though their roster was bleak, his game really matured and expanded his skill set while showing strong leadership qualities. Im glad he's on a contender because hes deserving of a title."
Dude reminds me of pre Detroit Blake griffin for some reason. Idk if it's because of the perceived attitude or what
"Nets have depth too lol what  Their top 10 guys: Kyrie, Harden, Durant, Joe Harris, Patty Mills, Blake Griffin, LMA, Bruce Brown, Millsap, Claxton.   James Johnson/Jahlil/Jevon Carter at the end of the bench"
"Hell, Parker had an 8 year average of 66.5% shooting at the rim with 5.54 FGA per game at the rim. 37.7% of all his shots during that period. (558 games)  Curry, another fantastic finisher, has a similar 66.5% shooting at the rim over an 8 year period but only averaged 3.33 FGA at the rim over that period. Only 17.8% of all his shots (504 games)  A ridiculous 34.8% of all Parkers shots were at the rim. Here's that percentage compared to other guards  Curry 16.9%  Dame 27.4%  CP3 16%  Lowry 23.2%  Ginobili 29.1%  and some bigger players  LeBron 35.9%  KD 21.7%  Kawhi 22.4%  Marc Gasol 23%  Blake Griffin 35.1%  Duncan 31%"
"I always imagined  a Semi Pro 2 with Blake Griffin as Jackie's long lost brother, Saturn Moon.  but it could be Klay too"
"Lol he had like the 4th best performance in the playoffs behind Kawhi, Doncic &amp; PG.   The Knicks were the 4th seed in the East right behind the Bucks so chill with all that, Giannis could barely score against Blake Griffin and KD clearly should've fouled out in what game 6 was it?  I'm sure you remember when the refs were ignoring that shit lmao"
Blake Griffin to Lakers incoming?
Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin
"I think its not that, it's more so, Brooklyn with all d leaguers and the core three are still going to be expected to have a shot to win. Giving them actual NBA caliber depth? That's a huge plus in and of itself. George Hill or Blake Griffin signing for the minimum to Brooklyn is a big deal when another team has to pay a bit more for them. The trade off for a having a big three should be that your depth is non existent, but even guys like an over the hump Millsap or Griffin is huge."
"I don’t understand this at all.  Is it a charity move?  Which I’m fine with for a guy like L.A. But there’s no way he has literally any impact whatsoever to that team, he’s finished unfortunately.  Unless he was lying about everything like Blake Griffin, he’s got to be done"
Blake Griffin is not a “poor defensive player.”
Skip is crazy. I very vividly remember a debate he had about Blake Griffin being considered white because the league needed more white american stars or something weird like that
I think he's Blake Griffin.
"They match up better with the Nets than most people think, I don’t believe in the Nets defensive ability at all. They are nuclear offense and that’s what makes them beat people.  Here’s a more schematic breakdown of what will give most teams problems with the Lakers.    1. The Lakers have 2 floor generals in Lebron and Rondo, who are BBIQ savants at transition, PNR, and set offense. Westbrook isn’t on their level but he has the chops to run PNR and Transition offense pretty well too, he’s not the best at halfcourt offense unless he gets volume to dictate posessions, but he won’t need to do that on this team. Westbrook also has the ability to amplify the Lakers Shooters and Lob threat bigs. So defensively, teams have much more to account for as opposed to when it was JUST Lebron and Rondo orchestrating things. Which leads to point #2.  2. Lebron led teams were always vulnerable because he never had guys who can competently get easy shots for his teammates when he’s not in the game. Teams have been able to exploit this and scheme for this and he would still win at times. He now has two others to share that Burden with. That’s scary if you’re a head coach.  3. Anthony Davis - now has 3 playmakers to help him get going. He’s an elite finisher and a match up problem, even if KD/Giannis/Blake Griffin have to guard him. If you’ve played as a center before you’d know how much having a guard who can get you easy shots helps your game.  4. This is the biggest factor  most seem to miss - the Lakers run A LOT of pin downs, dribble hand offs, PNR, in their offense, every single role player they got thrives in these sets. Not only because of their skill sets,  but because you can combine them with AD, Russ, and Bron who have roll gravity due to their ability to finish in the paint/dump off passes/Lobs, or make secondary plays.  5. The Lakers depth - in addition to their skill set above some  also threats to score off of close outs -  Nunn, THT, Monk, Melo, Bazemore, which further opens up cutting lanes and extra shots. I know the advanced stats may not make them look sexy but basketball wise the talent is there.    Yes, you can factor in health, shooting etc, but schematically and fit wise they are terrifying even for the Nets who have holes of their own that the Lakers are built to exploit. Nets are a mismatch for everybody but Bucks and Lakers have strengths that they are going to have to address perhaps."
"Do it if you can. It's worth it. I've seen 2 NBA games in my day. 1 was up close in Denver (we were maybe 5 rows back). Then the other was up in the nose bleeds in San Antonio. I swear, those 2 games might as well have been 2 different leagues.   In Denver, I got to see Javale McGee, Blake Griffin, and DeAndre Jordan all in their prime, and it was nuts watching each of them jump from up close. Even the warmups were impressive.  When you're far back, it's similar to watching it on TV as far as viewing angle, so you don't notice athleticism as much. But up close is just wild. I remember seeing Javale McGee jump for an alley oop and just thinking to myself ""No man that big should be able to get up that high."" But on TV you might notice height, but you don't notice size as much, so it doesn't mess with your brain in the same way."
They're not even trying man. They need to take notes from Blake Griffin and Chris Paul during the Deandre Jordan Mavs/Clippers debacle in 2015.  They haven't even staked out his house yet. Amateurs!  https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2520413-deandre-jordan-apologizes-to-mark-cuban-mavericks-after-signing-with-clippers.amp.html
Definitely a classic Blake Griffin to end up on the Lakers. No bias.
Love is either completely trash or he's pulling a Vince Carter/Blake Griffin.
"No one, really. Maybe a young Blake Griffin?"
Blake Griffin
If you subtract 30 million from the nets salary and tax payments they are still the second highest paying team after the warriors at 276 million. Compare that to the bucks at 212 mil.  They have the biggest advantage in the world of getting the bird rights of superstars forcing their way to the team. Oh yah and not having to pay 10-15 million per year players like patty mills and Blake griffin /lma anything at all because the leagues fucked like that
"Harden had nothing to do with that lol. Blake Griffin set an illegal screen that wasn't called and then Harden's defender was reaching, which also wasn't called, and Harden just sold contact for actually getting fouled."
"The Clippers never even engaged the Spurs in any of the trade talks for Kawhi. One would think if they had believed Kawhi was wanting to come to the Clippers a full 18 months before he actually did then they might have inquired about swapping him for Blake Griffin. I can guarantee you that there was absolutely nothing out there reported by anyone that Kawhi wanted out as early as January of that year. At that point everyone believed he was just rehabbing an injury. Things didn't really start to get truly weird with him and the Spurs until later in the season.   When the Shams and Woj tweets came out after that meeting with Pop in San Diego, it was an absolute bombshell that took everyone by surprise. I think you are confusing the 2018 and the 2019 seasons. 2019 was when the Clippers mounted this full court press to go after him. There was absolutely none of that talk in 2018 when they traded Blake Griffin."
"I don't think teams should call in players and say ""listen, we're going to see if we can trade you, just FYI"" because if you can't then that's gonna cause unnecessary hurt feelings (see Ray Allen in Boston, or Lamar Odom when the Chris Paul trade to the Lakers was vetoed). However, it's not like if the player finds out there are trade talks involving them that the trade can no longer happen.   Additionally, we need to realize that any time a player's trade demands gets leaked to the press, it's because just politely asking the team in private didn't work. No star first makes their trade demands known by alerting the media. They talk to the team first, and it's only when the team is unwilling that it ends up becoming a public spectacle.   The reason that the Blake Griffin thing is shady isn't so much because the Clippers ghosted him once they were in talks to trade him. It was shady because they knew they didn't want to pay him a 5 year max, but also didn't want to just lose him for nothing in free agency. So instead they lied to get him to re-sign (rather than choosing his own preferred destination), and then they immediately traded him to the place that was best for *them* as soon as they were allowed to.   That's really no different than if a player knew they didn't want to stay with a team, but because they could get the most years/money from them signed the extension and then demanded a trade a few months later. It's blatantly screwing over the other party when you know it's going to be bad for them but good for you. It's especially shady in this case because Blake was the first player in their history to finally start turning that franchise around. They rewarded him for doing that by knifing him in the back."
"That didn't happen until after the season. During that season Kawhi was just ghosting the Spurs, he didn't even join them when they went to the playoffs. It wasn't until after the season when he finally met with Pop that he told them he wanted to be traded to LA, and his uncle alerted the media of that.   [Here was Shams' initial tweet about it](https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1007673738148630529?s=20) and then [here was Woj's follow up tweet.](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1007676505562984450?t=RfHsWpyLYlf_Pwfs-tw13w&amp;s=19) You can check the dates of both: June 15, 2018. Blake Griffin was traded by the Clippers [6 months earlier](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/958120746169053184?t=j7bF7keA9gq6PS4Gxpt9pQ&amp;s=19) so that trade had nothing to do with Kawhi. The Clippers pursuit of Kawhi started that next season, when he was in Toronto."
KD coming back Steve Nash first time as a head coach  Harden coming out of nowhere  Obviously the kyrie stuff  Blake griffin(?) Losing to the bucks by a toenail
"Am I crazy or is that not a poster? I thought it meant that they got physically dunked (like what Blake Griffin used to do a ton), not just like a side swipe thing. Genuinely asking  Not downplaying this play tho, that's hype af to watch"
"I feel like Blake Griffin is what Chris Bosh wants to be. An NBA star who is also a ""cool, accepted celebrity"" with a great sense of humor."
"This entire situation starts with one key misunderstanding.   If the sixers succeeded trading Ben Simmons for James harden, they would have fucked him over. It is a straight knife to the back to make a player sign a max and then trade him. The entire fucking point of the max contract is so players cannot leave and they cannot be easily traded. Look at the players that got fucked over   Derozan, Blake griffin, Chris Paul (to a lesser extent). The biggest offence a team can commit against a star player is to make them sign the max then trade them.   Imagine if this happens to anyone else; gainnis? Klay? Siakam? Bam?    You are all hypocrites, you cry that players don’t sign the rookie extension but don’t see it as treachery when the players are just being pumped to be traded.   Player empowerment this and that but you forget that this tanks the value of the rookie extension even more.  You don’t want super teams but you are setting the rookie extension up as a bad deal.   Why stay with idiots that got lucky with ping pong balls when you can build a team with players that fit your play style. Player built super teams have always been more successful than team built super teams.   This Ben Simmons situation sends a clear message, fuck the rookie extension, the teams aren’t loyal.    Because for all this noise Ben could have been playing on the same team with trea young, or devin booker, or steph curry. We are here because he was loyal, until they weren’t, then he wasn’t."
He should’ve won it last year for robbing the rockets blind and signing a seemingly washed Blake griffin that ended up looking like a solid player again.
Did Blake Griffin ever dunk for the Pistons?
"Not paying Wood like the other commenter said, the Blake Griffin thing, Detroit vs. Jalen beef, then Jalen looking amazing probably doesn’t make them feel better on top of that"
"Doc Rivers was brought into compete for a title with Chris Paul, DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin. He wasn't brought in to draft well and develop late first rounders and second rounders. Clippers had a legit shot at winning it all from 2012-2017 including 2 division titles, 57, 56, 56, 53 and 51 win seasons.  As an executive, he drafted Reggie Bullock at #25 (great pick), and then traded a late second rounder and Bledsoe for a package including JJ Redick who was instrumental in their 50 win seasons.  In 2014, he traded a dissapointing Dudley and a late first rounder to Milwaukee for a second rounder, Carlos Delfino an expiring was waived for cap space and Miroslav Raduljica.  Later, he selected CJ Wilcox at #28, hard to blame him for a #28 pick not panning out.Traded a late first rounder for Jeff Green, who was only 29 and played a big role on their 2016 team. Drafted Brice Johnson at #25 who didn't pan out, again, late first rounders hardly ever do.  In 2018 he traded a late first rounder for Danilo Gallinari who was coming off an all star esque season and would go on to be their best player the following season.  So in the what 8 years that your stat encompases they were competing for a title and werent focusing on developing late first rounders or second rounders, or going through a quick rebuild and contending again with Kawhi/PG, this isn't that surprising IMO."
Blake Griffin was working on that shot for a while. Was actually pretty decent at it for a little while (Pistons before he got hurt iirc?)
Kemp &gt; Blake Griffin
I saw Blake Griffin at SFO once. He had his hood on but it was pretty hard to miss a 6'10 guy that's absolutely jacked.
"Big cost of depth??? Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, Patty Mills, Paul Millsap--I think they recovered that depth just fine"
"I work at a coffee shop in Downtown Dallas that happens to be across from the hotel that all NBA teams stay at. No in-depth interactions, but little convos here and there with Joe Ingles, Blake Griffin, Rudy Gay, and we see Mavs guys a lot (Boban, KP)"
"I don’t think he can play the 5 defensively.  That requires help defense and rim protection which isn’t his specialty.  He’s a great on ball guy which is good for the Nets switching system but if teams are hunting the mismatch (Harden), then Ben is basically being wasted in terms of his talents.  Ben is great because he’s the best guy his size at getting through screens putting him in a system that doesn’t require that minimizes that one special trait he has.  It’s why him and Embiid worked so well.  Joel protected the rim and Ben fought through screens.  On offense the Nets don’t really have enough 2 way shooters to play him at the 5.  Sure in theory you can have Patty, Harden, Joe, KD, and Ben but while that works on offense for you that actually hurts your defense not being able to play a Paul Millsap or Blake Griffin as well in the situations.  Guys who can switch but also help protect the rim somewhat.  It’s one of those good on paper until you break it down moves."
"I'd say for sure. At least as a New Yorker, the good and the bad of the city is that everyone is wrapped up in their own shit and doesn't care. My friends and I were out in SoHo a couple weeks back and walked by Blake Griffin and his boys, other than them hogging the sidewalk a bit no one really paid any attention to them.  I also used to bartend at a club that a lot of Knicks and Giants went to and they usually just vibed out and did their thing without it being a huge deal. Smoked a blunt with JR Smith, but tbf I'm pretty sure everyone whose ever met him has smoked an L with JR Smith"
Eh - Hardaway was much more fringe candidate than Kyrie.  His career was more Blake Griffin like - wasn't the same after the injury and was still good but not sure it was Hall of Fame good.  The homophobia may have hurt him a bit but not sure the votes were there anyway.
Blake Griffin pulling up from the logo lol
This is Blake Griffin jersey retirement all over again Lmao. Pistons get Cade ready
"Yeah some GMs/owners are dumbasses   They didn’t pass a test to be owners lol. Our owner seems like he finally got his head out of his ass, but he forced the Blake Griffin trade so we could make the playoffs, just like the Kings would be doing  That’s just how guys who view the team as a product operate"
&gt;The good ol Blake Griffin strategy.  So bring Ben to a Sixers arena ceremony where they raise his jersey to the rafters. Foolproof plan honestly.
Convince him he is a franchise player while actively shop him. The good ol Blake Griffin strategy.
Blake Griffin 50 pts vs 76ers
Blake griffin. He is a meat head who could dunk.
"Really? What if Blake Griffin didn’t win? People would be lining up for autographs from the Dunk Contest champion that didn’t actually win?   I don’t think it’s quite the same as championship gear, because it makes sense to have shirts and hats ready if the team can legitimately win the championship that night. They need to have it ready."
"I mean if u been watching since only the 80s u never saw Wilt or Bill so u can't really speak on them. By all accounts, both of them would be athletic freaks even by todays standards. Both of them competed in track and high jump, broke and set some records too. Bill would've qualified for Olympic high jumps most likely.   Think there's a decent amount of guys that were as explosive as Giannis, it's just his ball handling, footwork and flexibility that makes the difference compared to bigs of the past. He can just drive it to the rim himself and finish it. Guys like Kemp, Xavier Mcdaniels, Larry Nance, Darryl Dawkins were older players with similar athleticism. More recently guys like Blake Griffin, Dwight, Mcgee, Amare, Deandre Jordan, Jeremy Evans even lol."
"Rubio actually started as a pro younger than Doncic did, and the professional scouts said the same thing. Including that Rubio would be a household name and was far beyond anyone else his age. So if your goal is to take the Euro prodigy who is super hyped up and you call GM's a fool for not doing so, then you would've taken Ricky Rubio over Blake Griffin in 2009 and been fired shortly afterward. Arguing that Doncic won Trophy A instead of Trophy B, or you need to use the eye test isn't strong at all. These scouts use the eye test."
"upvote this a million times if i could. the nets have enough ball-handling and 3pt shooting everywhere, they NEED a 1-5 defender like Simmons. Blake Griffin will get injured. play Simmons like Dwight friggin Howard but can handle the ball and pass better."
I think this is the year Blake Griffin finally repeats.  RIP Norm
Blake griffin dunk contest was rigged
"Dude, I deal sportscards for a living. Been at it professionally or semi-professionally since around 2004. John Wall generated very little interest in the industry from the get go. There was middling hype on the guy when he was drafted. I would rate it equal to Derrick Rose in terms of interest from the public. He was the clear top rookie in a rather weak class and that drove a decent amount of money to him as the season went on, but very little in terms of his draft issues. By and large all of the interest that year was in Blake Griffin after his injury. Compared to the hype for Simmons it's comical. The amount of money that was being poured into every Simmons release as it came on the market was record breaking at the time. Fuck, Simmons hype is responsible for the entire Prizm craze beginning. Simmons was being hyped as a 15 year old in Australia as the future #1 pick and the successor to LBJ. His commitment to LSU was front page news. I don't know how you can sit here with a straight face and tell me John fucking Wall was considered a better prospect on draft day. You want to argue Kyrie with me, fine. Argue Kyrie with me. I think you're wrong. But Simmons just makes you look dumb."
"KD+Harden is easily the best duo in the league (Can make an argument for top 5 for both of them).   Then on top of that, even an out-of-prime Blake Griffin, Aldridge, Milsap helps round out the PF (or small ball C) C position.  None of these guys can give you 40 minute of elite ball but each of them can give you about 10-15 minutes of solid ball at this stage.  Then at the guard spot you still have Patty Mills+Joe Harris who are both great shooters and both could probably start on a lot of teams.  Then at the C position you have Claxton who isn't ideal but he's still been really good and starter-caliber. He isn't really a weakness since they will play a lot of small ball and they don't really need him to do much other than set screens, get rebounds, and play average-level defense.  Then ass an insurance policy they have Bruce Bowen who looked really legit last year. They also have Cam Thomas who I think has potential to have a Jamal Crawford or Lou Williams-type career as a pure scorer (but his opportunity might not be in Brooklyn due to being back on depth chart).  James Johnson is also an x-factor. He has been ass on bad teams but on good teams, when he doesn't need to do much, he has a tendency to do a lot of important things that don't show up on the stat sheet or at the very least be an enforcer on the team to give it grit&amp;grind.  Bembry is also a great player to have on the team even if he will barely play due to the culture, effort, and intangibles he brings to the team at practices, warmups and so on (Go watch Open gym and other videos on him - Raptors staff loved him because of how smart he was and how he was able to be used to practice schemes against opponents and give the younger guys some run).  This team is elite without Kyrie. Without Kyrie, I think a healthy Nets team is still the best in the East. With Kyrie, a healthy Nets team is a guaranteed chip. Health + Kyrie will be the x-factor for this team."
"Don’t have many??? Joe Harris, Brown, Mills, Clax, Blake griffin, Aldridge, millsap that’s just off the top of my head"
I don't think LaMarcus Aldridge and Blake Griffin sell as many tickets as they used to
"They have James Harden, Kevin Durant, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Blake Griffin. Kyrie isn't going to make them lose much from ticket sales"
"1  I think he’s had the team for a decade now and we’ve been ass the majority of it. He’s allegedly why we traded for blake Griffin and he’s for sure the reason SVG was GM and coach (SVG the coach was fine, SVG the Gm was bad).  Not to mention how he’s made his fortune off the prison system, which is odd with how he always talks about giving back to his community."
"Jerry West has more scouting ability than just about anyone. For normal GM's and viewers, there was no way of knowing how good Luka would be. Ricky Rubio was playing the pro level at an even younger age in Doncic and had almost the exact same scouting report going into the NBA draft. Like, I could take quotes from both and mix them up and without checking you'd have no way of knowing which one the line was about. In 2009, the correct choice was to take the super-athletic American big man who dunked all over everyone and had incredible upside. (Blake Griffin) over the super-skilled prodigy from Euroleague, in 2018, in the same situation, the prodigy turned out to be better than the American big man. But you can't blame any normal GM for not knowing beforehand."
"I don’t disagree with your point as a whole, but people were also somewhat surprised that Lonzo was such a poor shooter his rookie year, after what he showed in college (even with a shortened line).   Ultimately, Lonzo was always a shooter, with varying success. Ben Simmons never has been, so while I agree with the general point about his lack of improvement, I’m just not sure Lonzo is the best comparison there. A lot of otherwise skilled shooters struggle shooting the ball in their early NBA years, for any number of reasons.   Funnily enough, I think Blake Griffin is a much better comparison here. Never shot threes until the league started transitioning to everyone shooting threes, and became surprisingly decent at it with pretty solid 3PA, not incredible overall but definitely what people wish they could see from Simmons."
"Blake Griffin in the 2010-2011 NBA season played 82 games averaging 23/12/4 on 50/29/64  Idk why you think Pau Gasol is decisive over LMA or those two i've mentioned.   And even if it is the case that you took those 3 off, that puts pau at #20.   I just named really good players those years, I may have even missed a couple.   Pau gasol is a barely top 20 player in the league during his tenure with the lakers.   Keep picking 3-4 players off of a list of 23 players. Until i see more than 7+ names, will I actually consider an argument for Pau being top 15, which is actually ridiculous to say. Pau gasol top 15 player lmao.   Keep being wrong, kobe hater."
"his list is dumb...blake griffin wasn't even playing in the nba during Pau's finals run lol. John wall only came into the league in 2011...  bunch of other bad additions in that list. sure all those players were really good at some point, but not the time that we're talkinga bout (Pau's 3 years during the finals run)"
lol you obviously have no idea what you'er takling about as blake griffin didn't even play 2010-2011...are you just trolling?  john wall also only started playin in 2011...so you're taking rookie john wall over prime Pau?  why are you taking LMA over Pau? also Paul pierce? joe johnson?
"Pau definitely better than a sophomore Kevin Love, a not drafted until 2010 John Wall, and a Blake Griffin who was injured his rookie season lmao"
"Lebron James,  Chris Paul,Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Dwayne Wade, Deron Williams, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Lamarcus Aldridge, Amare Stoudemire, Dirk Nowitzki,John Wall, Joe Johnson, Zach Randolph, Chris Bosh ,Paul Pierce,Steve Nash  There are 23 players here.  Pau Gasol BARELY fits into this list.  Reddit is way too biased on Tim Duncan for what i think are reasons external to the game of basketball.  And I'm fine with that, but you're absolutely wrong if you think Tim Duncan would survive on any other team not Spurs.  Spurs and Duncan is the GOAT match when it came to player + organization. No other organization + player combo will top those two. Curry + GSW comes at #2."

KAT should be above Blake Griffin
"To be fair Harden had to face KD, Steph, Draymond, and Klay  Giannis had to face KD, Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, and Bruce Brown"
"I saw a man walking down the sidewalk towards me, in my parked car, a couple months ago. I yelled “holy fuck that’s gotta be the biggest person I’ve ever seen” and my friend said “that’s either an nba player or big foot”. His calves were the size of tree trunks. He was as tall as those cartoons where 3 kids are all preciously stacked on top of each other to get into the R rated movie. As he walked past other regular people on the sidewalk, you could see a wave of heads turn and do the “looking but not looking” thing. It was Blake griffin. TV definitely distorts how absolutely massive these guys are."
"Technically it’s a dunk if it is from above the rim. Dwight Howard did it for Superman dunk and Blake Griffin did it for Kia dunk.*    *i could be wrong about one of these, its been a while since I thought about the dunk contest"
"&gt; Even since ballmer has come in they have consistently had all stars and just had kawhi and pg come because they are in la  Well Kawhi and PG are from LA and wanted to go home, rather than because they were just looking for someplace sunny or something. And whatever other All Stars the Clippers have had since Ballmer took over were already there when he bought the team, as Lob City started under Donald Sterling. The Clippers got Blake Griffin because they had the #1 overall pick in the draft, and they got Chris Paul mainly because after the NBA screwed up the CP3 to the Lakers trade and it was a huge PR fiasco, they had to work hard to orchestrate somewhere else to send him and the Clippers were the only other team with any assets to trade."
"Throwback to the infamous Blake Griffin [he ain’t even stretch doe](https://youtu.be/NCFd-e6ggbE) which features young D’Angelo Russell, Devin Booker, and Bobby Portis"
"Lol unfortunately this has been stemming for a couple of seasons. Locker rooms been a absolute mess, reports of kemba getting shit on the entire time he was on the team, Blake griffin asking a friend on the team if he should sign mid season but was told to stay away. As a Celtic fan I keep up with a lot of inside reports coming from local reporters so I knew this was coming. I’m glad it came from the bulls, they’re my favorite team to watch this season."
Blake Griffin 2.0
Blake Griffin really carried them that year. That was his last really good year statistically. Played 75 games that season as well.
"Blake Griffin hasn’t dunked in 1,008 days."
"Unless you give Zion extra points for being shorter and heavier (both negative qualities in basketball), there are quite a few athletes that have been like him. Young Blake Griffin comes to mind immediately."
Blake Griffin lmao. His pump fakes are so predictable. I feel like his shots actually look better when he doesn’t do it.
Like blake griffin was gonna choose the celtics over the nets anyway lol
We didn't want Blake Griffin anyway
"After the Blake Griffin fiasco, you can’t use “loyalty” freely in sports"
"Why do you guys even want him? He is truly washed, and I don't think it's a Blake Griffin type situation."
"That sort of arrangement is easy to come by when you're a famous baller, and a lot of players have something similar going on, [as mentioned by him](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/02/01/lou-williams-clippers-legend-blake-griffin-allen-iverson-doc-rivers). Drake just happened to rap about Lou."
When Z-Bo choked Blake Griffin and then got in his face as they were escorting him out and a whole arena full of people chanted “whoop that trick”.
"Unless he goes the Blake Griffin route.  Gets bought out, goes to a contender, tap into his younger self all of a sudden."
I loved when old man KG dunked on Blake Griffin and Kat was so hyped.
"Your caveats are useless here.   I was born in Minnesota in 1990, so I was one of the thousands and thousands of kids that started playing basketball and fell in love with it solely because of Kevin Garnett. Above all of his on court achievements like his MVP season and the WCF run, I legitimately shed tears the first time he checked into the game at the Target Center when he returned to MN at the end of his career so it has to be that moment. A close second would be old man KG yammin on Blake Griffin and getting T'ed up for howling at him. I was in the building for that one and I almost fell down into the empty seats in front of me"
"He’s literally the modern day poster boy for athletic dominance and bully ball and somehow gets a pass for it when players in the past like Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, Dwight Howard, Kenneth Faried, Lebron James in his early days in Cleveland, were all crucified for relying solely on their athleticism. It’s so nauseating how he gets a pass just because of his story or whatever else it is."
"I think Lebron's bulk for his athleticism made him more unique. At 6'9"" if you're just looking for speed, vertical, body control without the muscle mass, you'll find tons of guys like Jeremy Evans, Travis Outlaw, Darius Miles etc.  When you add the muscle to it, it gets more rare, but it's often because guys with that kind of mass usually play power forward and have a very different skillset. You'd have to look at guys like Stromile Swift, Shawn Kemp, Blake Griffin etc. If you just want any absurd combination of size, speed, vertical, coordination etc., you have to add in Jonathan Bender and Tyson Chandler. They don't have the strength but Lebron isn't 7'0""+ tall like they were. If Bender was healthy or Chandler had the basketball IQ, people would be saying that they were GOAT-levell in physical gifts. Chandler's athleticism at 7'1"" 235 was insane and was the reason he was picked #2 in the '01 draft."
Blake Griffin? He got a lot of attention for a dude that never got to the conference finals and his body would break down every year towards the end.
&gt; He'll probably just decline his player option and leave in free agency.  I just don't see anyone walking away from $47mil.  The most I've ever seen a player give back was Blake Griffin and that was $13mil.
True it's just kind of frustrating to watch at times lol  People want to see players go off for 30+ and not pass to Blake Griffin for another bricked 3 pointer
"&gt;And even then, I still might take a 5% chance at KG over a 100% chance of Blake Griffin.  5% is way too high imo. 1% Drafts are a crapshoot, it is so rare to have a generational talent like KG."
"&gt; You take rookie Zach Lavine first in every draft if you know for a fact that he'll become what he is now.  I mean maybe. But that's never a certainty.   And even then, I still might take a 5% chance at KG over a 100% chance of Blake Griffin."
Who's the last rookie to make an All-Star game? Duncan?  Edit: Blake Griffin apparently in 2011.
"&gt; 2019 PG was def MVP level  He wasn't seriously contending for the MVP that year. It was a two man race between Harden and Giannis (PG didn't receive any 1st place votes). PG got 3rd but mainly because LeBron and Kawhi missed a lot of time and KD and Steph kinda cancelled each other out because they were teammates.   PG led the Thunder to the 6th seed and a 1st round exit, so it wasn't like he dominated the league or something. PG has only received MVP votes twice in his career (2014 being the other time, when he came in 9th). PG was an MVP candidate in the same way that guys like Blake Griffin and Joakim Noah were: just one fluky year, rather than consistently being in that discussion. Tatum needs to be better than that to lead Boston to a title."
I understand why and I know it's happened in the past like with Blake Griffin. I just think it's dumb that they can be on an NBA team sitting on the sidelines for a year and still be considered a rookie.   Especially since Julius Randle only played like 20 mins and got injued his first game of the season and that was considered his rookie year.
Melo &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Blake Griffin
Nah it’s unfair. Even as a 5th option it’s cheating to have Blake Griffin on your team.
those are dame numbers... blake griffin top 75 ALL TIME.
why is comedian blake griffin playing for the nets?
"Lol, imagine being bitter at the person you didn’t pick being better than your pick.    Unrelated, to this day, Blake griffin totally better than steph."
Blake Griffin is the hardest working player in the NBA
"Yeah young dirk spin move to dunk was insane.    Historically, good centers coming out of college are actually so bouncy and athletic its insane how just like 4-6 years later the same centers develop in different ways to stay in the lineup.     Got off topic but people watching young orlando shaq would be blown away if theyve only seen heat shaq. And if we stay relevant to our era, the best examples are dwight howard(he had his athleticism a bit longer) and blake griffin to an extreme. But even someone like andre drummond used to be extremely athletic and not just hops, he was real quick as well."
Thats the Blake Griffin i know and love
Steph cannot lose against a blake griffin team. That's simple.
Literally fuck Blake Griffin
"""Blake Griffin an excellent defender""  Bro what"
Blake griffin is food rn
fuck Blake Griffin...all he does is flop
blake griffin always falls down lmao
Blake Griffin 🤡
Nets players are all flopping like Wiggins can push over Blake Griffin
Blake fuckin griffin
Love how commentary pointed out Blake Griffin just stopped trying to fw Steph entirely
who does blake griffin think he is? Lmaooo
poor blake griffin lmao
Steph want Blake Griffin on every switch
Prime Draymond Green getting no respect we are talking a guy 32-14-9-2 with 6 3s game 7 nba final type. Blake griffin wouldn’t dream of posting this stat line while playing dpoy defense.  I get it Blake can dunk and I see an argument for him getting better all around in Detroit but the fact of the matter is we watched these two go at it for years and the Warriors sonned the clippers as soon as they started integrating Draymond.
"Good question. Some that come to mind are: James Harden @ Houston, Blake Griffin @ Clippers, Mike Conley @ Grizz, Derrick Rose @ Bulls, Kevin Love @ Twolves"
"Explains a lot. I always assumed, as best player on the team, that Chris Paul was most at fault for the Clips lack of success. If you’re telling me Blake Griffin we the best player on the team I owe CP an apology."
"No he wasn’t.  First option means the guy you look to first to score. In every season except  one that he played with the Clippers, Griffin shot the ball more than anyone else per game. That one season where they didn’t look to him as the main scoring option was his rookie season where he had the second most shots behind Eric Gordon by .1 a game.   Paul never was given as many  opportunities to score as Griffin in any season they played together. Blake was always the number 1 option."
"You gotta make this more interesting. Prime Blake Griffin, but he gets with a Kardashian from day 1, or Prime Draymond Green but he’s really friendly"
Ya gotta at least have guys who make it difficult. Part of the reason the nets series went to 7 was because Blake griffin played really tough D on Giannis and claxton did a decent job protecting the rim. Bulls have nobody that can even play passable d on a big like Giannis. Look at what happened in the finals when Ayton got into foul trouble. It was over. There’s no way the bulls take the bucks to even 6 games.
"To me he wasn't a rookie because he wasn't new to the organization. I know it's an unpopular opinion and one that'll probably get downvoted.   He was receiving treatment, payment, and coaching from the 76ers for that year. He was able to see first hand the length and trials of an nba season and work with teammates. The other guys who were candidates for ROY were going through the whole thing for the first time.   Felt the same way with the Blake Griffin ROY, although I feel like it wasn't nearly as controversial or discussed as the Simmons ROY."
"Blake Griffin is a better first option, but is he good enough to win a ring as the first option? No.  Draymond isn't a first option but he's a much better compliment to other scorers."
https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2014.html  Blake Griffin finished 3rd in MVP voting in 2013-2014 only behind LeBron and KD.
"Great comment that in my reading boils down to this. Rebounds and assists have a ""quality"" aspect to them. They are all counted as ""one"", a whole number, but in reality they should be counted on a ""0-1"" scale if you are a team trying to evaluate performance of a player and team instead of a fan. Is Russell Westbrook grabbing a free throw rebound actually ""one"" rebound or ""0.1"" rebound in quality? Is Blake Griffin handing off to Kevin Durant for a 23 footer actually ""one"" assist or is that better described by Lamelo Ball threading a backdoor pass through 3 sets of arms to a cutting Hayward?  Baseball somewhat does this cutting Runs Allowed down to Earned Runs Allowed. If I was a front office analyst giving my year end Powerpoint presentation to Morey on a player's performance, i would include a ""quality of rebounds"" and ""quality of assists"" category instead of just plain aggregate numbers."
Tough one. I’m taking prime Blake Griffin but putting him on a different team. However Draymond has proved he can help you win a championship. Ai yay yay. I will answer without answering.
Blake Griffin was easily better
"Other teams at least have good defensive personnel to match up with Giannis. Nets had Blake griffin who at least played with physicality and made things a little more difficult. Hawks had capella and Collins who aren’t perfect but at least have size and toughness and athleticism. Suns had Ayton who was playing out of his mind on defense throughout the playoffs, especially against AD and Jokic. Vucevic will be bbq chicken when it counts in the playoffs, and the bucks just bully teams who don’t have size over a 7 game series. The bulls are definitely a fun team to watch right now and they’ll be a tough matchup in the playoffs, but I don’t see them taking the bucks or nets down. Could be wrong tho!"
One thing I’d never think Giannis would have was a Blake Griffin and James Harden jersey in his house hanging up. That “beef” him and harden had was a stupid narrative
I was hoping to see the screen cap of D’Lo and Booker being HS kids at the gym watching Blake Griffin do his dunks.
As amazed as I am that he has a framed Harden jersey in his house I'm probably more surprised that he has a Blake Griffin jersey down there.
Zion is Blake Griffin 2.0
"It’s like when people get drunk and order random shit on Amazon, he’s gonna get wine drunk and trade half the team.  *Wakes up*  *Reads Headline*  “Lakers pull off 10-team trade to acquire Jeff Green, Blake Griffin, (the other) Brooks, James Johnson, Tyler Herro, and Andre Drummond (again). Enough to convince DWade to come out of retirement and join the Lakers.”  “Who the fu-… Did I…?”"
"Man Clips should fuckin love the Pistons. We basically gifted you your current team!  - Took Blake Griffin off your hands, one of the worst contracts of all time, which freed up cap space to sign Kawhi   - Gifted you a first round pick in that trade, which became Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and later packaged for Paul George  - Drafted and developed Luke Kennard, gave him to you for pennies  - Developed Reggie Jackson for 5 years, bought him out so you could have him for free  - Created &amp; developed a defensive intensity within a key part of your coaching staff in your WCF run (Chauncey)    If yall win a ring the Pistons should get one too, just sayin 🤷🏾‍♂️"
"Yeah, probably even more if you replaced Kyrie Irving with Klay Thompson and Blake Griffin with Draymond Green"
"He has some game where he’s like 80% from the line and there’s game where it’s like 4-11 or something. It’s not gonna be a drastic increase over night, his movements to getting into a mid range pull up does look smoother tho. Just gotta keep at it, It took Blake Griffin years to get to an average shooter at his position."
"You don't even have to look back that far, just go back 3-4 years here and find comments about Trae Young the first half of his rookie season.   The real test is growth imo. Some guys either through experience, coaching, skill set, situation etc. start really hot. Blake Griffin could jump out of the stadium at 16 years old. Luka had been a pro for years. Other players have to figure it out. By the end of the season, if you see them improve and catch stride, that's when you can exhale. If you see them still struggling by the end of the year, you can start to panic imo."
He would be playing the role of current Blake Griffin better than Blake
I was a fan of both as a kid but the combination of seeing the Laker fans destroying shit after the 2010 repeat and meeting a rookie Blake Griffin at a charity event made me switch sides completely.
Blake Griffin
Blake griffin is going to accidentally injure someone with his falling on the floor every single play.
"he also understands his limits, which has helped his longevity. like the dude was trusted to go out and play on one and a half legs in the playoffs last year because his coach and trainers knew that he could watch out for himself well enough. like compare him to griffin these days. i love blake but like there is a clear difference. sometimes you actually CAN have too much hustle."
"Blake Griffin needs to change his release, he seems so hesitant to catch &amp; shoot that it seems like he's releasing his shot on the way down instead of going up to the peak."
"yah this isn't the same situation at all, I'm sure they'd love to trade Wall but no other team in the league wants that contract so there's no buyers.   He's still getting laid his max salary, is very involved with the team, and is getting a lot of time to work on his body and rehab, which definitely allow him to extend his career like we've seen with Al Horford &amp; Blake Griffin"
"""Blake Griffin was only a dunker.""  He had an incredible finesse post game. He had excellent handles for a big, he could have run the point forward if need be. His defense was decent and he developed a reliable jump shot.  But people only remember the dunks."
Blake Griffin had the benefit of basically learning for a season while sitting out with injury.   I think people are underrating how good KAT looked as a rookie though
Blake Griffin and Draymond Green
Blake Griffin
Well Luka should try to pass the ball to his own teammates instead of Blake Griffin.
Blake Griffin too
"Yeah I guess I only mentioned teams in the west.  But you are right. The Nets in the East will challenge them at least. If Kyrie comes back, than it's gonna be an actual battle going all the way, and it's a coin flip.   But the problem with the Nets is their bad defense, and lack of depth without Kyrie. Patty Mills and Blake Griffin will do well in the playoffs, but not much outside of that. Joe Harris vanished last time."
The Warriors have beef with every all star on the Nets. Blake Griffin was a massive rival for the Warriors during his Clipper era.
This is Blake Griffin.
"Would a better coach have somehow avoided Kyrie and Harden getting hurt?  The Nets lost because they had KD, Joe Harris, and a somewhat revitalized Blake Griffin surrounded by a several hobbled James Harden and a bunch of G-Leaguers. How do you have upvotes?"
Yeah he’s definitely capping. No way anyone in their right mind had anyone over Blake Griffin in the first few years. Curry was a project that just happened to revolutionize the game.
"Blake griffin sucks during attacks, I don't know how he constantly stays for long time in the game."
"Paul Millsap, Blake Griffin, and Aldridge are all pretty damn washed at this point"
I dont think there's a better big man for dunks. this dude's doing prime blake griffin shit
"His défense? He defended Blake Griffin, not KD. KD went off for over 35 ppg. He’s a great player but no, he’s not as good as KD."
&gt;Remind me when KD dropped 50 and 10  In the playoffs against the eventual champions with Blake Griffin as his second best player
"These are great examples. Blake Griffin dunk over the car is another one.  OPs answer is dumb. Dame’s shot is correctly rated considering all the chit chat that had been going on between Russ, PG and Dame too and I say that as a massive Russ fan."
Blake Griffin and his 6 ppg on 30% shooting make them a superteam?
"LeBron, Dominique, Shaq, Dr J, T Mac, Blake Griffin, Shawn Kemp, Stromile Swift, Tyrus Thomas, Amare, John Collins, Darryl Dawkins, Deandre Jordan……  I’m gonna respectfully disagree."
"Love how you are getting downvoted  This is a distraction to the team despite their record  All the players would much rather have a guy that can contribute than a constant media shit-storm  The fans will never accept Ben back and if somehow both parties agree to let the guy play the fans will crucify him  If the team decides he can just sit in street clothes it will also be a distraction bc the fans will harass him. No matter how much the players hate Simmons they arent going to sit by and listen to that shit.  There has been precedent for issues like this, Lakers paid Luol Deng 17M to sit at home instead of even showing up for practice.  Simmons already has 1/4 of his salary paid (8M) out of 33M  That's a pretty substantial loss from the pockets of the owners.  All this shit doesnt make sense - if the Celtics rumor is true, the Sixers need to trade him Jaylen Brown ASAP before it's too late.  Celtics string together a nice little win streak and Brad Stevens will never trade him.  As for all the people in this thread saying that the players will not have Simmons back during the next CBA - it's quite the opposite.  NBA teams can make promises and rescind them without any consequences.  Look at Blake Griffin, they hung a fake banner with his name on it and said he will be part of the franchise forever. They even compared him to MLK in a fucking video presentation.  Shortly after they sent him to one of the worst teams in the league in a city that is cold (and shitty when compared to living in LA).  Players took note of that. Yeh Blake got paid, but he signed his big deal with the expectation that he would stay in LA. Otherwise he would have chosen a different team that actually wanted him.  The Clippers ended up on top in that deal at the expense of Blake Griffin.  So players will think, why shouldnt we support Ben when owners can trade players for no reason - sometimes just to clear cap space.  To me, both parties look terrible in this situation, but Simmons asked to be traded 4+ months ago. In the history of the NBA when has this happened, maybe with Vince Carter or Alonzo Mourning, but i cant think of any other instance.  People's memories are short - they seem to forget how badly Kobe fucked over a small market team by forcing a trade from the Hornets to the Lakers.   Simmons is a piece of shit for not working on his game but not for requesting a trade - his coach and fellow superstar threw him under the bus and basically blamed the series loss on Simmons. And while Simmons lack of offense in the 4th destroyed the Sixers, he did play some pretty solid defense throughout the playoffs.  Morey needs to trade Ben, get some value back, and both parties need to move forward.  As for the whole mental health argument, it is valid. No one can quantify mental health, unlike Kawhi's injury where multiple doctors cleared him and he still refused to report - again people's memories are short. Kawhi was the team's only superstar at that point and he tried over and over to force a trade out of San Antonio.  Being forced to play in a city that hates your guts (and has some of the harshest fans in the league), being forced to play with teammates and a coach that blamed you for the loss in the playoffs (despite it being a team sport - as if he was the only one to blame for losing to an inferior team) - all those things can take a toll on someone and make them depressed.  Funny how everyone takes Love seriously when he says he is depressed despite being in one of the best roles in the league - multiple finals trips, a championship, while playing next to LeBron James. If Love can be depressed in that great situation, why cant Ben Simmons be depressed or mentally distraught when the whole city of Philadelphia, his coach, and his teammates hates his guts.  Im not even a Sixers fan or a Sixers hater, Pistons / Lakers fan here, but what they are putting Simmons thru is straight bullshit.  If Morey hadnt held off on trading his younger players, he could have gotten Harden for Simmons + youth/picks and with the way the playoffs went last year the Sixers most likely would have won a championship.  Doc Rivers and Embiid tanked his value instead of praising him for his positives - they easily could have said ""Everyone has a rough series, but Ben Simmons is a great talented player and he will come back stronger next season"" But they didnt and now his value is shit and that's on nobody but Morey and the Sixers coach/Embiid.  Trade the motherfucker and move forward.  People are right, the players will throw a fit in the next CBA meeting, but it will be in favor of Simmons. No one is going to throw a player under the bus for wanting to leave a bad situation.  Surprised so much hate and vitriole is being directed at Simmons when there have been 100s of players who collected checks for sitting at home and not even bother contributing.  Even if the Sixers are the #1 seed in the East going into the All-Star break it just doesnt make sense not to get some kind of value for Simmons. Whoever they get back will help reduce the minutes of their top players, thus saving them and their health for the playoffs.  Ill get downvoted but i dont give a fuck"
that's nothing! We're paying Blake Griffin nearly 30M!
"“Hello, police? This is Blake Griffin, John Wall is tryna get in the locker room and beat me up! Get down here and save me!”"
"Is there any precedent for a player like John who has already made stupid money, who still is technically in his prime but, at the risk of losing millions, still opts in? I understand players not taking hometown discounts and things like that, but there aren’t many players who have made as much as he has. Maybe they’ll agree to a buyout like Blake Griffin."
Blake griffin has always wanted to win another roty
"Zion Williamson, Ja Morant, Vince Carter, Brian scalabrine, Blake griffin, Shawn kemp…   Hope this helps!"
"These players don’t have to ride it out, they have full control to accept a buyout. That’s what blake griffin did for example. It’s just evident which ones prioritize the bag"
"Blake Griffin made All-NBA like three years ago, talk that shit for no reason though I guess."
"Wow, he just pulled a Blake Griffin this game. Dunk on &amp; putback dunk."
They're punking him worse than big guys would do to Blake Griffin in retaliation of his dunks.
yall still paying blake griffin?
He needs to pick up the slack when Blake griffin scores 0.
"I have a video of me making a pass from the stands to either the ref or Blake griffin at a clips lakers game and I still show it to people every once in a while, 4 years later, at 30  Cherry on top is I got a stern stare from doc because I was yelling about getting open when I passed it back in"
"Blake Griffin. He had same issues after being successful on his first team (Clippers), dropped drastically on second (Pistons). Game started improving again on 3rd team (Nets). My gut tells me OBJ will improve on his 3rd team as well, but not be what he was in New York, same as Griffin not being as good as he was on Clippers."
I only thought about it just now but Blake and LMA are on the same team. I remember those discussions back in the day who was the better PF or should be an all-star etc. I always was more of a fan of Aldridge because of the way he plays/played. He's still money at this age. I don't think Griffin would have ever aged this well either even though he developed his game compared to when he entered the league.
"Blake griffin is a player who had to overcome injuries since he entered the league, youre right but it depends. If your playstyle is athletic based like Westbrook and Griffin it often does not age well. But with griffin I see your point people forget how skilled of a player he is and how good he was at the beginning in Detroit. There are also Players like LeBron that age like fine wine but in general shooters and high iq players tend to age better and having a later prime. For example Steve Nash."
Blake Griffin has dealt with career ending injuries.
You should tell Blake Griffin your theory
Kemba Walker's dunking + Aaron Gordon's perimeter game + Kanter's defense = Blake Griffin
He thought the pistons would be good.  Actually im pretty sure they would have been good but he cant predict blake griffin basically breaking as a player the moment rose got there.  And as for signing with the wolves im pretty sure thats just a loyalty/team familiarity thing plus he had literally just made the playoffs with them the year before...
"lol they were like 1-6? when they faced us and beat us. I was like this is a classic trap game, their high usage options (Jerami and DRose) aren't any bad and the C's love playing down. we narrowly lost the game where they didn't have Blake Griffin, we narrowly won the game where they \*did\* have Blake, over him."
Boucher went all Blake Griffin on that face palm of theis
"vs Pistons was dreadful, even Blake Griffin move him on the post"
"Yo pistons fans, how do you guys tolerate Blake Griffin? I saw for like 5 straight plays Blake didn’t move at all on defense, stays away from contact under the post. He is holding the team back and plays so slow. He is moving like a 90 year old."
"Don't think Blake Griffin would get that. Jae'Sean Tate just came over from the NBL, is starting on the Rockets and only got 4m per year.  Anyways I'm not really sure what you're arguing here when you've open admitted that you haven't seen the guy play."
Huh? So you think in basketball terms Blake Griffin is more stressed than say Steph?
"When Wayne Ellington and Blake Griffin signed their contracts they were much better than they are right now. Do you think Blake would get 40m a year if he was signing today?  Larkin is 28, he's not a young player anymore."
I am hoping some one takes Blake Griffin off the Pistons and we finally learn to stop over paying over the hill players
Julius Randle:  * [x] centrifugal power   Blake Griffin:  * [   ] Centrifugal power
Blake Griffin... possibly wishful thinking.
Julius Randle:  * [x] knees   Blake Griffin:  * [   ] knees
for players that the Nets may target?  * Javale McGee * Nerlens * PJ Tucker * LaMarcus Aldridge (longshot) * Blake Griffin (prob won't opt out) * Gorgui Dieng * Robin Lopez (most likely)
Marc Gasol has more dunks than Blake Griffin this season lol
"I edited my comment but I should’ve said from the games he doesn’t play our defense clearly takes a big hit.   First game against Chicago can’t get stops until late in the game, end up winning by 2.  Detroit we let Blake Griffin look like he’s in his prime, get dominated and lose by double digits   OKC looked like they were having there way till the 4th quarter, Shai, Kenrich Williams, Diallo, Bazley, Horford all just having there way in the paint.   Him out definitely leaves a big whole in our defense. Teams don’t fear attacking the rim and get what they want"
I liked the way how he said “Blake Griffin has now three fouls...as much as he has points”
Yeah I loved seeing Blake Griffin jump over the bumper of a Kia.
"If blake griffin can change all the habits that go into his old game and come out a 3pt shooter, luka can stop whining during a game. He's still young and he's been watching other superstars like lebron and nick nurse get away with it. I know nurse isn't a player star but he's a top 5 coach and it seems like he talks to the refs more than he talks to his players sometimes lo."
A fair amount of NBA players are very mediagenic (like Blake Griffin) but Kyrie doesn't really seem that interested. Not like he's the first to not really care.
“I have as many NBA dunks as Blake Griffin has all year” is a frankly depressing sentence to say.
Saying the name Tracey McGrady and Blake Griffin in the same sentence is enough to get smacked in the mouth
No hes the next Blake Griffin
"White men can’t jump. There are tons of examples, such as Zach Lavine, Aaron Gordon, Blake Griffin, and Tyler Johnson /s"
Shaq. Giannis doesn't get that much better with Blake Griffin shooting as much as Shaq does imo.
"Hall of Fame is a definite lock for Melo. He's been super influential on the modern game. His reliance on jumpers was a twist on the iso/hero ball that had dominated the game for so long and undoubtedly helped legitimize the upside potential of great shooters (though it's worth remembering late career MJ and late career Kobe in terms of ball-dominant scorers killing you with unstoppable midrange). He's not solely responsible the way Steph is, but he's part of the shift that helped allow for someone like Steph to come along and dominate through shooting. That's more my opinion than anything, and it's worth noting that Melo in his prime was a 3 level scorer and had a reputation for being an absolute load to handle in the paint. Like he was one of those guys with the reputation of ""if you defend him for a whole game, you're walking away bruised and beat the fuck up."" Also don't sleep on his cultural impact re: a continuation of Iverson's unapologetic blackness. He played with flair, he wore cornrows, he dressed fashionably, and he never really seemed to worry that much about the criticism (though if you wanted to argue for the psychological impact of starting off compared to someone like Lebron only to see that guy not only eclipse you but completely obliterate any idea of comparison between the two, I probably couldn't really offer any reply).  As for a contemporary comparison I'd say it's really tough. He utilized such a deadly mid-range post up game that could morph into all sorts of different actions. No one really plays like he did in his prime anymore, and even then he was one of few guys that could do what he did. KD and Lebron can both do the midrange ISO game and kill teams, but that's kind of a lazy comparison. Honestly, he compares fairly well to what prime Blake Griffin could do, obviously without Blake's bounce but both guys could take you into a 15ft post up and be so effective that there was just borderline nothing a defense could do. If a help defender comes, he'll still bury it right in your eye. If the help is late or favors the high side, he'll go baseline and get at the rim; low side and he spins towards the top and can either hit that fade or kick out to someone else (and then the offense either attacks the 4 on 3 or just lets Melo reset). Prime Melo was borderline matchup proof and had the sort of floor-spacing gravity that truly great scorers generate. Like if all modern 1A scorers have a little bit of post up, a little bit of spot up, and little bit of paint scoring, Melo was tier 1 elite in all areas. He epitomized ""volume scorer"" in a way that only other truly great players could ever equal."
"I see your point, but in another comment you were comparing Melo unfavorably to CP3 and Westbrook, but those 2 players had Blake Griffin, KD, Paul George, and Harden as their teammates in their primes.   The rosters around Melo in New York were unbelievably bad - every year. If you look them up it makes Anthony Davis' teammates in New Orleans look amazing and he couldnt do much there either. There's a reason why they went 4-40 without him after he had knee surgery during the season.  It wasn't just Melo taking a lot of money. Knicks are infamous for their poor management and decisions, and even after he left they haven't been able to attract any good free agents.  Again, I see your point but CP3 and Westbrook have had way better teammates so it's apples to oranges"
"Those 2 that you are comparing Melo too also had Blake Griffin, KD, Harden (on multiple teams) in their primes. Melo’s best teammates in New York have been JR Smith and Rookie Porzingis. Anthony Davis couldn’t do anything in New Orleans either and he had way better teammates than Melo ever had"
"Griffin doesn't have that many more individual accolades compared to Rondo. Rondo is 4x All-star, 1x All-NBA 3rd team, 2 times defensive first team, and 2 times defensive second team, while leading the league in assists three separate times. Blake has 6 all-stars, 3x All-nba second team, 2x All-nba third team.   Rondo has way more post-season success when compared to Griffin as well. And it wasn't like he was there for the ride. He was a key factor in the Celtics playoff runs, and hell , was even a key factor in the Lakers recent championship win. With all this considered, I give the Rondo the edge in making the HoF over Griffin."
*Detroit has entered the chat* can we interest you in a Blake Griffin?
"Prime Blake Griffin is a Hall of Famer.  The problem is that his prime was not long enough. He could make it. I think he belongs in the Hall of Very Good, and if he ever enters the Hall of Fame, he won’t be first ballot."
"I know he’s short af for his position. That’s a big reason why he’s such a poor rebounder. If he had better size and athleticism, I’m sure he’d be a lot better in that department. Also, offensive rebounds come in much smaller numbers than defensive rebounds. If you look at the top rebounding PFs, you’ll probably notice that their defensive rebounds alone are more than Draymond’s total rebounds. Before Blake Griffin was hobbled with injured these last two years, his worst rebounding year of his career he still put up 5.7 defensive rebounds per game.   Point is, Draymond isn’t only lacking in ppg. He also has shit efficiency and poor rebounding. He’s a good passer, (very good for his position,) and a versatile defender, but with the way he gets praised on this sub you’d think he was a hybrid of Magic Johnson and Scottie Pippen.   When your best player is as great as Steph Curry is, if you had a real second star then your team should have a legit shot at contending for a title. But the Warriors don’t, because their second “star” is really just a glorified role player who is paid like a star"
"Honestly, none.  Watching Blake Griffin has always felt like balancing on a tightrope, so much fear that at any moment things can go south. He's one of the most anxiety inducing players which makes it hard for me to appreciate his play during games."
"First of all, it really isn’t among the worst. Among power forwards he’s tied with Blake Griffin for rebounding and there are many power forwards with less rebounding. Second, Draymond is short asf for his position. He’s actually the second shortest player on the starting lineup, the only player who is shorter than him is Steph Curry. At 6’ 6”, he’s boxing out 6’10” players and competing with them for rebounds. Third, his play style is much more of a point guard than a power forward/center, he’s usually at the top of the key, passing to cutters or passing to Curry. Draymond is not at the block on offense that much so that limits his rebounding numbers. So him not getting elite number of rebounds doesn’t make him pathetic bc that’s not his role. Now that he actually has to play center, we can see he is averaging more reb bc that became his role although he still plays the point at times."
"Ah yes the two stars of Grant and Plumlee with the depth of Delon, Josh Jackson, and the corpse of Blake Griffin are comparable to the Nets without KD lol"
"Maybe. But demar derozen was a free agent. So was joakim Noah.  2017 had Blake griffin, Derrick rose, Gordon Hayward, Kyle lowery...  I’m not sure who the best fit would be. None of these guys is KD. But the warriors don’t just sit around and wait for improvement in next years draft."
Blake Griffin is the perfect example of why hyper athletic stars shouldn't come into the league and try to poster everyone as much as possible. One must preserve their body starting at a young age.
Blake griffin
"Just looking at some of the oldest players still in the league that likely could be had for cheap:  Iguodala (37)  Marc Gasol (36)  Carmelo (36)  JJ Redick (36)  Ariza (35)  Dwight (35)  Lou Williams (34)  Deandre Jordan (32)  Derrick Rose (32)  Blake Griffin (31)  Boogie (30)       The question is does he realize potential primes? like for the Celtics he could bring back Kemba, but does Tacko Fall become an even larger KG? or does he even reach current Dwight Howard level? or is it based on Prime that has actually happened to this date?       Either way,  Gasol/Boogie/Derrick Rose/Blake Griffin + Time Lord would pretty much be unstoppable. And that lineup is only $49m this year (2.5+2.5+8+36m) or only $15m if you take Melo instead of Blake.  So id still have over $95m to make a roster which i could make another super team out of and even if i bench Timelord, the old fellas are still competent role players without the Time Boost"
"this is gonna sound really dumb and i hope someone smarter than me when it comes to basketball (and sports medicine) can give me an answer  rey mysterio, the wrestler, shot the shit out of his knees from like 01 to 2012 because, as everyone even slightly versed in pop culture knows, rey mysterio really likes jumping off of things and blowing his knees out  except like 2 years ago he returned with near-prime knees as a result of what i *think* he claimed was stem cell treatments. if there’s anyone out there who blew their shit out as hard as BG did, it was rey  could those potentially give us the most threatening blake griffin ever or is there a reason he’s never even thought to opt for that"
love blake griffin
Blake Griffin with his 9 points a game
"And they trade D Rose as soon as interest was shown (to a destination D Rose agreed to). If Blake Griffin weren't a corpse of himself the Pistons would trade him too, but unfortunately I don't think that's going to happen. The man looks almost completely done."
Blake Griffin
"Blake Griffin, Felicio, and the corpse of Batum’s contract in Charlotte. Could argue Klay as well."
Blake Griffin
"Nah, MJ is much more famous for other things. The ""just a dunker"" comment fits better on Vince/Blake Griffin."
"Butler was never known for his 3 pointers though, the new Blake Griffin dunks would be if Curry never shot a 3 pointer or something"
"OKC is definitely an up-and-comer. no disrespect to them or the pistons, but without blake griffin (even with him tbh) we should NOT be going to double OT"
Jimmy Butler three pointers about to be the new Blake Griffin dunks.
"Hell, compare LeBron to players from draft classes 5+ years after his own. For example, Blake Griffin looks beyond washed right now and Westbrook's fallen off hard."
"Blake Griffin will be famous for all time as the supreme metaphor of how the league's changes in the last few years affected big men. Not least because he had a rivalry with the Warriors that included the guy leading the revolution (Steph) and the new model big man (Draymond). He actually reinvented himself pretty well, all things considered. Just got left behind."
It was another level.  Blake Griffin would posterize people.  He was so hype it was nuts.
I can't imagine any team wanting the Blake Griffin that has played so far this season.
That's just wild to comprehend. When I hear Blake Griffin I can't think of anything except dunking. Like I know he doesn't do that anymore but for the longest time the dude lived in the paint
I don’t care if you love him or hate him. The nba is better to watch with Blake griffin posterizing people left and right.
"If you watched the Detroit vs Miami game, Blake Griffin was unable to back down Duncan Robinson. Duncan Robinson."
"Sad story. Blake Griffin was the reason I started watching NBA. I remembered people compared him to Dominic Wilkins aka the human highlight reel, and on one episode of ESPN SAS(?) were gave him a list of nick names including things like Blake Superior etc while good 'ole Skip Bayless stayed true to his name and predicted, during Blake's first season, that he is going to be no more than a poor man's Dennis Rodman. Little did we know that Blake's first season without injury was also the height of his career, and his basketball legacy takes the same trajectory as the popular boy who peaked in high school. Some flashy dunks and no so deep runs in the play off were all he, Chris Paul and the lob city team will be remembered for. Despite all that I would like to remember Blake as the man who single-handedly made the LA Clippers team relevant, the only person who dunked over a freaking car. FWIW I hope he'll find solace knowing that he is also Steve Ballmer's favorite Clipper of all time."
"You would need to attach young player or picks to unload Kemba's contract. Wall and Horford are easily better player than Kemba right now so you would need to attach like 2 firsts or so but you would be prefer to attach firsts for Barnes or Vuceivic. Westbrook is a better fit for Celtics than Kemba in my opinion but Westbrook's contract would hamstring more to properly build a team. You wouldn't want Blake Griffin, he's really washed. So yeah, short term trading him would make them worse but provide more flexibility in next season. I think they should getting that contract freed up is one of the best options for Celtics."
OK so this is the first full Hornets game I've seen this year. I think Bridges is my new favorite player. Just learned he's from Flint too. He's freaking fantastic. Like if peak Blake Griffin was 2 inches shorter.
blake moves like peter griffin out there.
"Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony and Derrick rose have combined for 2 dunks this season. Melo has 1 and Westbrook has 1."
"probably the biggest underlying story this year, before he entered the league people were comparing Zions leaping ability to an early Blake Griffin, that tells you a lot about what Blake Griffin was, an athletic phenom. Lob City... like think about that, and he hasn’t attempted a single dunk this season. Wow"
&gt;If you’re familiar with Blake Griffin  Crazy to think there are people on this sub that probably didn't watch prime Blake Griffin
He's also 35 pounds heavier than blake griffin and 2 inches shorter.
"Blake Griffin and the Lob city Clippers got me into the NBA, he's been my favorite player since then. It makes me sad seeing him play like this now"
Blake Griffin about to lose his spot as funniest NBA comedian.
"&gt; no other player could do what Jokic does in the halfcourt offense.  Bill Walton did. Sabonis could have if he weren't so criminally underutilized. You're right about Webber not being quite the passer, but he loved playing out of the high post and could still have been dominant in Jokic's role. He just would have done it in a slightly different way (ie more attacking the basket instead of threading the needle to cutters).  &gt; I think Webber's career has more in common with Blake Griffin.  I think Blake is a pretty solid comparison. In terms of play style, I think Webber fits somewhere between him and Jokic. End of the day all three are fairly unique and hard to find 100% perfect comps."
Kemba's contract is still tradable at his current value (if he doesn't get better over the season) with another albatross contract.   Like Westbrook/Wall/Horford/Blake Griffin/etc
Just own more thing he can be better than Blake Griffin at.........
blake griffin in shambles
"Blake Griffin.  Less likely now that he's in Siberia of the NBA, but he still has a decent shot."
"Webber was a better ball handler and rebounder than Jokic, but even as good a passer as Webber was (and he was excellent), no other player could do what Jokic does in the halfcourt offense.  I think Webber's career has more in common with Blake Griffin. Both super-explosive bigs with high-level ball skills, both careers derailed by knee injuries. Blake was more athletic, and Webber was better in the post, but there are some parallels."
"Worst contract in the league is Blake Griffin, not even close. The man looks like he's out of the league, like ready for retirement. And he's on a max deal."
"Lol calm down guys, I forgot to add “now”. I am a big Blake griffin fan as well (can show you the 2 shirts and 1 jersey I bought of his) but I feel he’s pretty average now, sharing the spotlight with Jerami Grant. He has surely moved more to a perimeter game than the paint beast he once was but he sure has lost a lot of dominance he once had in league. My point being, he will still sells seats in arena and earn nba good amount of money for what he was once capable of."
People are over hyping this Blake Griffin move lmao dude's been so bad since coming back from injury. If he stays like that it hardly moved the needle for the Nets
"Well you’re misinformed then maybe looking at too many nba memes or something cus the betting sites have Lakers as the slight favs even now with AD injured. Healthy AD means easy repeat even if Blake griffin starts playing like its 10 years ago, if Kyrie doesn’t get injured, if Harden plays playoff basketball, if Durant stays healthy, and they’re all huge Ifs lol go put your money on the Nets haha"
Seriously. Claxton needs 30 minutes. Jordan and Blake Griffin can have a reunion 15 minutes a game
"It's not a crazy take if you understand basketball. It's akin to calling Blake Griffin a good passer.   He has the metrics to back it up, compares favorably to his contemporaries, etc."
"We’re not exactly relying on KO for defense.  Him and Griffin are at worst a wash on defense, I’m assuming a motivated Blake would be better than an inconsistent KO on O and a better rebounder."
Andre Drummond and Blake Griffin
"No way Griffin should be starting for any serious title contender. He's definitely added nice rang to his game and he continues to be an underrated playmaker but he's extremely limited offensively now and a horrendous defender. Not even someone like Bam can hide him on defense. I've seen legit end of bench players make him look like a fool on defense this year. If he could indeed start for the Heat then that says more about the Heat than it does Griffin. He can definitely still be useful, especially on a team like the Nets where he will end up with wide open shots while just literally standing there parked at the 3 but even then I can't see him providing more than 20 minutes before he starts doing more harm than good. Blake is just sadly past his prime do to injuries unless he was legit doging it in Detroit this year which is possible I guess."
"Watch how the Cavs played em in both games this season. They have a lot of players who like to get to the hoop so if you can make life difficult for them down low, you can force them to be jump shooters and they are far less consistent mid to long-range. If you are playing all three of Kyrie, KD, and Harden you can practically count on winning the rebounds battle and if you can hit em on the break like SexLand you have a chance. That said, they already added Blake Griffin and if they can sign either Drummond or Boogie, their inside presence will go from a weakness to a strength"
"Otto porter, Russell Westbrook, kevin love, formerly Blake griffin, John wall, kemba walker, and Andre Drummond  would be a good place to start."
"lmao there are like a dozen teams that could beat them in the playoffs and it wouldn't be that surprising. They are so thin that in the last month they have signed Iman Shumpert, Andre Roberson, Noah Vonleh and Blake Griffin off the street. Four absolutely useless basketball players."
"I think Philly is the only team in the East with a realistic chance at beating them. When the Nets go small, they're basically unstoppable, so the only real hope is to somehow make those lineups untenable defensively because you'll never outscore them over a whole series. Against Philly, if the Nets go small, they'll be at such a huge size disadvantage that it might offset the shooting gap between them; beyond Embiid being unstoppable in the post, one of Simmons and Tobi should also have a size advantage against Bk's small lineup.   Defensively, Philly has the personnel to theoretically matchup with Bk, but it doesn't really matter because nobody actually does. Simmons-Green-Thybulle is prob one of the best sets of wing defenders in the league. I think they need to play Thybulle even if he's not shooting well because he would let them switch all those ghost screens and two-man stuff that Bk likes to do with their big 3. The best formula is probably blitz pick-and-rolls when Simmons is the tagger and trust that he'll be able to consistently nullify Brown's 4 on 3 opportunities. You could also try an aggressive drop where Embiid comes to just below the level of the screen, but I don't trust any drop coverage against Bk bc KD and Kyrie are two of the best pull-up shooters ever. A combination of blitzing PnRs and the kind of top-locking off-ball they did against Boston last year could maybe work as long as Philly can force the Nets to keep Deandre on the court.  Of course, none of this matters if Blake Griffin can be Blake Griffin again"
"i think you do something similar to what the rockets and clippers have done against the warriors in recent years. you bait durant into playing iso ball, and try to cut off everyone else and kill ball movement.   difference tho is that the warriors had two guys that were amazing off ball, whereas the nets guys are all iso scorers, so iso ball is what brooklyn wants to play. obviously not going to work all of the time, but the less ball movement you get from the nets, the less they can hurt you (especially the role players).  on the other side, obviously you need to take advantage of the nets' lack of inside presence. attack the rim, drive and kick, offensive rebounds. you want to control the possessions and keep the game at a reasonable pace.  you don't want to get into a shootout.  i'm probably in the minority, but i don't think brooklyn is the favorite in the east. i can't trust a team that is going to have to play deandre jordan, jeff green and blake griffin 20+ minutes in a playoff game"
is this all because of Blake Griffin?
"I would be surprised if all four of Harden, Kyrie, KD and Blake share the court much. A washed Griffin doesn’t really offer much that Joe Harris doesn’t do much better expect size and even then it’s not like he moves at all well anymore"
"I still think Blake griffin is gona be good on that nets squad. Id be shocked if he sucked complete turd with harden, kd, and kyrie around him. That nets team ka stacked"
"People might downvote me, but Simmons passing reminds me of that year without CP3 where Blake Griffin dominated as a transition passer. Obviously Ben is a way better defender and Blake is a way better scorer"
"And a Blake Griffin who has less dunks this season than CP3 at that lmao, If this was prime Lob City Blake fine get tilted I probably would too  But this is old man Blake with no lift lol, he's still a serviceable player but its hardly the end of the world he joined the Nets lol. Not like Blake solves the problem of the Nets having to play DeAndre Jordan 30+mins a night because they traded away Jarrett Allen."
Nephews are so dumb. Kawhi forced a trade ... crickets. AD forced a trade ... crickets. Harden forced a trade ... OMG HOW COULD HE. Blake griffin bought out and the nephews think the balance of the league has been tilted
"Why are ppl suddenly acting like bkn is unbeatable cause they added a washed Blake griffin? It’s one thing if u just thought that kd/kyrie/harden was unbeatable but if you’re freaking out cause of Blake it’s silly.  Second, i didn’t hear anyone complaining about the lakers last year running through the playoffs and beating everyone in 5 aside from Miami."
maybe by their new defensive juggernaut Blake griffin.
Its crazy how its 9th man off the bench Blake Griffin that makes people have meltdowns and not when we traded for James Harden lol
"""Blake Griffin believes both the Lakers and Clippers are not contenders"" - ESPN"
"Swear to god, I read that as ""Blake Griffin is officially a Broken Net."""
"&gt; How many times have Lakers fans tried to include Kuzma in trades? Why sign Blake Griffin when Nick Claxton is a good young player you need to discover how to fit in the system?   Because Claxton is a project that might require years to develop and the Nets want to win now?  Because Kuzma has probably reached his potential as a player and Lakers also want to continue winning?  If we could flip young Kyle Anderson and Cory Joseph back in 2014-15 say for 34 years old Pau Gasol, I'd be fucking ecstatic."
"No. The trades are fine, and expected. But trying to pounce on every single decent player that becomes available when you already have pieces that you haven’t figured out how to make work is just sad to me. How many times have Lakers fans tried to include Kuzma in trades? Why sign Blake Griffin when Nick Claxton is a good young player you need to discover how to fit in the system?"
r/nba Timeline.     Feb 2021:  Blake Griffin should just retire.  He’s washed up and can’t even play anymore.   Mar 2021:  I can’t believe the Nets signed Blake Griffin!  He’s one of the best players in the league and just made the Nets unbeatable.  I’m OUTRAGED!
What’s CP3’s excuse for playing with Blake Griffin and James Harden in their prime and still not making it past the conference finals?
"Yes I read it, I mentioned the ""one name"" because that's the name the article is centered around and is used as one of the most successful buyout players. It literally uses P.J. Brown of all people as one of the best.    You mention ""former stars"" as if they have anywhere near the production that Griffin/Drummond/Aldridge have.   Mike Bibby is on that list, did you know Mike Bibby averaged 1 ppg on 11% shooting before he was bought out by the Wizards and signed by the Heat? Derek Fisher was 38 years old, had started a total of 9 games in the past 5 seasons, and averaged 4 PPG on 30% shooting when he was involved in a buyout signing. Amare'e hadn't been a starter or played more than 20 minutes for 4 years when the Mavs signed him (And he actually played well for them after the buyout).    You're comparing that to LMA and Blake who both had 50+ point games literally in 2019 and who averaged 19/7 (LMA) and 15/5/3 (Blake) last season? Neither guy is worth a 25-35M contract but you're crazy if you don't think they're absolutely valuable at $1M. And Drummond is a consistent 18/15 guy who is 27 years old... Smh"
"It's a tough discussion because Blake Griffin on the Net's is most definitely not a minimum contract player. It puts him in a much better environment to succeed and play at a high level than on any other team. Take him as is and put him on the Timberwolves and he's going to play like a minimum contract player. But that's where it becomes ""unfair"" I think, because if he comes back at even 40% of his Clipper days, which is most likely to happen if he's on the Nets, then the best team in the league just added a very high value player for essentially nothing."
I think Blake Griffin made the choice to not be anywhere near his best in detroit and will now be a better player purely off of effort. He wanted to force Detroits hand because he was unhappy being moved from LA and decided from the get go that he was just there to get paid. When his trade value tanked (because Blake clearly didnt give a shit anymore hahah) there were only two options and Detroit had no reason to think he would help their team going forward.   Dude literally hasn't tried to dunk in 2 years because he wanted to change his game. Then magically in his first game with brookyln he's out here trying to dunk again.   Is that a coincidence?
"On that note I can’t believe how little these players leave on their current teams.   Eg. If Blake Griffin is losing half his money, he will want to recoup more and might not sign with a team who only has the minimum"
"On one hand, it's difficult to say if he should shot more threes or not. Why to pull up from distance when you can just bulldoze your way to the basket for a high % look? On the other hand, not shooting threes at all hurts his future development and his team (it becomes easier to defend them). The middle ground would be to start shooting at least 1 per game and increase steadily. He should take Blake Griffin as an example: when he was totally capable to dunk all over everybody, he started shooting threes (you can go back and read [this](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/articles/why-aint-he-dunkin) for context). Brick by brick he got to the 2017 season when he was physically on the decline, but he learned how to shoot, helping him to end up on the All-NBA team."
How when at the start of the season both Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge sucked?
Nice summation. Being the best player on a team and being criticized is one thing.  It’s another to join a team as the 4th option and know you’ve been an all star the majority of your career.  Comparing criticism between those scenarios is apples to oranges. Not comparable. No team wouldn’t want Blake Griffin as the #4 guy on the offense.
"I mean they aren't *at that level* but find me an NBA player on a 1yr/1m contract that you'd rather have than Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge or Andre Drummond."
i think there would have been teams willing to pay MLE money for the shell of blake griffin. The problem is that Blake Griffin probably doesn't care about MLE money and would rather go chasing a ring.
Why would Blake Griffin agree to a buyout? There’s no way he’ll make $39M next year or thereafter. Why give up the rest of this year ($10M+) and all of next year ($39M) to chase a ring that everyone knows you didn’t meaningfully contribute to?
Blake Griffin isn’t good anymore. Aldridge on the other hand... we’ll see
"Thats a big stretch. Super star talent has super star talent and Jeff Green isn't a super star. Now, they are both older and not able to go 100% all the time, which is why they couldn't carry teams, but Blake Griffin is going to be able to give the nets a lot more when he is the 4th option or off the bench and playing against second unit guys for reduced minutes."
"Repeating it here too.   Do you believe he’s responding to people saying “Blake is a bad first option” or do you think he’s responding to the people that are saying “Blake Griffin is a terrible basketball player”?   And a follow up, which group do you think is more numerous and thus he’s more likely to see and respond to?"
No because Blake griffin the past 2 years has avg 12 pts on 50 TS% with horrid defense  You guys don’t even keep up with the players you whine about. Blake is so so bad at this point.
So basically you're saying that Blake Griffin is just Kelly Olynyk with a prank show
"Well to be fair, Blake Griffin is bad relative to his contract and his usage.  Now ask yourself how much did the Nets sign him for and how many shots does he get per game?  Everyone understand the difference now?"
Blake griffin is literally a vet min guy. He avg 12 pts a game the past 2 years and shot under 40% from the field both years.
This is false because a lot of the criticism was how they perform relative to their contracts. Blake Griffin and Aldridge are not min-level players but that's how much they're getting paid by their new teams while their old teams foot the rest of the bill. Tell me a team who wouldn't want these guys for free.
"So if Blake Griffin signed with the Hornets you would show the same level of excitement than you are now?  Of course not.  The Nets are the flavor of the month, and Redditors love the flavor of the month.  That's what's driving the excitement, not the economics of the deal.  The Nets being in first place is what makes him a ""steal"".  If the Nets were in 8th, this would be considered a dumb move.  People are frontrunners, that's all."
My question is wtf is Blake Griffin thinking passing up all that money?  That's a gigantic sum of money.
you also said blake griffin was the final nail in the coffin for the nets lol
"They were bad as the central stars of their teams. As role players who cost next-to-nothing to sign, they are definitely a bit unfair. This team now has 5 (maybe 6) players who are all-stars or pretty recent all-stars. Blake Griffin can’t put up all-star production for 30 minutes but I bet you he can do it for 5-15 minutes."
"Simple things man, people want guys to stay loyal to franchises even though we have so many instances of franchises not giving a shit about them, either trading them or not giving them enough talent. Stockton, Barkley, Iverson etc. Never got rings, so they aren't winners. But they also clown guys like Griffin and Aldridge who are not only Trying to make up their HOF Resumé, they are also trying to win a championship. Everyone that comes into this league, comes with a goal to be a champion. Most of them try for years on Shit franchises that never give them enough talent, but then are clowned. LMA gave his career to SAS and POR. He's 35 now, winning a Chip as a first option is way out of reach, Kawhi leaving didn't help either, and SAS is in a Semi-Competitive rebuild situation. Can you really blame him for getting a buyout and potentially winning one with Nets? Blake dragged the pistons to playoffs on one leg, sacrificed whatever was left of his career, and now he's also clowned because he's excited to be in a winning situation again? I am not saying they aren't at fault somewhat for technically mailing it in, but in this top heavy league, there's only so much you can do before you realise there ain't no point trying to win differently in this League anymore, you would need literally need the Superteam to lose 2/3 of the Big three to injury to beat them (2019 raptors). The one Parity Year (2020), we were missing like 3-4 of Top 10 players to Injury, so we never even got to see that competitive of a playoffs anyways as far as lakers were concerned."
[I'm sorry what](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2614395-report-blake-griffin-traded-to-pistons-for-avery-bradley-tobias-harris-more.amp.html)
"The people who think Blake Griffin is an All-Star player are clearly wrong. Live life long enough and you’ll see they’ll be a crazy person who will justify any position. The people who also think Blake Griffin on a vet minimum contract isn’t a steal are also wrong though. He’s much better than that. Truthfully, I’m not confident this pushes the needle towards Nets Championship to the degree that other people are, but it certainly pushes it to more likely than not. I don’t think there locks but inarguably one of the best teams just got better."
"The argument I always hear is how against it the NBPA would be if LeBron just decided to sign somewhere for the vet minimum, getting paid far below his worth. I realize there's a difference between LeBron and Blake Griffin, but the idea is the same that these players are being paid below market value (what they would negotiate on an open market with teams actually bidding, not in the middle of the season).   I agree with /u/broodingdeception that there's nuance here - Blake wasn't worth $30M but he's also worth more than the vet minimum. He chose to take a contract far below his value to contend for a title."
"Ah, now we have to feel pity for poor Blake Griffin recieving a max contract he signed to play for the Pistons?  Is that the shitty situation?"
"People complained nonstop about the warriors dominance just a few years ago. Now the Nets (who are contenders for like the first time in a decade) aquire a Blake griffin on the borderline of retirement and an old LMA and it's the worst thing in the world again. People will legit complain about anything. Last time I checked MIA, PHI, and LAC are all big markets too and the fucking bucks have the most buyouts as of recent so I dont wanna hear it."
"I think people make waaaaay too much out of this. The NBA cap is and always has been a soft cap. You get to sign players for the league minimum at any time. If those players have some sort of circumstance where they feel they are available for the league minimum when they ""should"" be making more, that's on the player, not the team signing them, and in some very real ways that's an example of the cap working (because without it a Lamarcus Aldridge might command a $10M salary in addition to the money he's getting back from his old team). You don't want a player signed to a half-year rental on the cheap? Don't cut that player. Trade them if you can (of course, if you're just going to cut them if you can't find a buyer and everyone knows that, that will also lessen your trade power).  The other reason why this is a mountain being made out of a molehill is that half-year aspect. Even in the cases where these players still have value - I guess that's true for Aldridge, but I'm not sure that's at all true for Blake Griffin, for instance - there's going to be a feeling-out and ramping-up process that will take some time to complete and the team as constituted may not even be ready to go by the playoffs. And after the playoffs, a player signed to the league minimum is free to be signed by anyone; the renter doesn't even Bird rights on them (as they shouldn't).  I don't see how this is any different from, say, the Lakers in the early 2000s signing guys like Karl Malone, Gary Payton, and Glen Rice in the offseason to chase rings. If anything, that scenario is ""worse"" inasmuch as those players chose to take below-market contracts at a time when their team had literally months to figure out what to do with them. Also, Mailman/GP/Rice all had more left in their collective tanks than guys who are literally being dumped for salary reasons. And I mean, those deals weren't even all that successful in the long run, were they? I guess Malone got his ring with the Lakers, but as a rotation guy, and GP had to go off to Miami and have a whole second career as a veteran PG to pick up his.  This isn't even a ""big market"" vs. ""small market"" issue, this is a ""teams that are good and want to take a flier on an extra piece"" vs ""teams that are not good enough"" issue. You're not seeing the Chicago Bulls or Dallas Mavericks bidding for any of these players."
So nobody will have an issue if Blake Griffin signs a minimum contract with the Nets this offseason?
Yeah Lebron was gonna stop them before but now that they signed Blake Griffin and Lamarcus it's over because the 2021 nba season will be decided by 2K16 ratings
"Who would win, Lebron/AD or Blake Griffin in a wheelchair with a glock"
An injury prone Blake Griffin is not getting more than the vet min.
"My comp is Kelly Olynyk.  Kelly Olynyk is not a particularly good NBA player (enough of a mediocre player no one really cares that he was traded as salary filler on Oladipo) and has pretty similar stats this year to Griffin.  But if you told me Kelly Olynyk was the 8th or 9th best player on a team, I'd tell you that team probably has top-level depth.  That's the Nets, except Olynyk is Blake Griffin and they have 3 Superstars."
It's because of a mix of casual NBA fans and the effect of places like ESPN making graphics or headlines putting heavy emphasis on signing MULTIPLE TIME ALL STAR BLAKE GRIFFIN/LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE.
I will always hate the nets and now especially since Blake griffin is there but you got one of the good ones with Bruce Brown. I hated to see him leave Detroit but it worked out in the end because it let him go to a winner and we got saddiq bey.
"I think it's mostly a result of having a better team around him, which gets him better looks.  Teams planning for Jeremi Grant and Blake Griffin is a lot different than teams planning for James Harden, KD, Kyrie, and then Blake Griffin as a role player.  Blake is just getting better/easier scenarios to produce in.  He's really not that different even if he was mailing it in a bit."
"These buy outs can give good role players for championship teams. Look at dwight. He played a key rotation for LA, after being bought out from Memphis   These players like Aldridge and Griffin are way past their primes but can play be a key role player on a championship team.  Like Griffin on Friday was the nets 2nd best scorer. Yes it 17points but thats a decent score line for someone who was supposed to be not able to play when he was on the pistons.   It's really poorly made situation for eveyone except for the team that is getting the player.   Pistons still have to pay Blake for the rest of the year, and Blake has to cut his pay but the nets get him for a super cheap contract.  It's why the advantage is all there for a big market."
"I'm actually unsure on that front. I had originally included something about that in my comment but removed it when I realized I wasn't unsure and didn't want to muddy the waters.  For those curious, [CapFriendly](https://www.capfriendly.com/buyout-faq) explains the rules for the NHL. Basically, a buyout reduces the cap hit and the amount going to the player per years to 1/2 or 1/3 based on their age. If those rules were applied to the NBA, Blake Griffin would have counted against the Pistons cap for I think 2 more years at $19M each season. He would also be paid the full contract amount (the player gives nothing back in an NHL buyout, except potentially interest made because the money is being paid out over double the years). This leads to scenarios like Rick DiPietro who was bought out in July 2013 but will count against the Islanders cap until the 2029 season at $1.5M per season (he was just under half-way through a massive 15 year contract, so that's an extreme scenario to be fair)"
I wasnt really speaking to Blake Griffin specifically...I begrudge his move less than I do Aldridge for sure.
It’s a toss up to me but I favor the Nets in 6. It’s what makes me realize people pearl clutching about the Nets are just being lil bitches.   The Lakers pre and post Harden trade were the favorites. LMA and Blake Griffin don’t move them from being not the title favorites to the justice league. Especially when the Lakers have Drummond .
"So a shit player like Blake Griffin gets 60 million for one year? If they do that then the money has to go to the NBA charity, or to repay the previous team"
"&gt; Same with blake griffin and aldridge, sure they might help string together a few wins when all your superstars are out, but they arent significant contributors to a healthy team.  And neither of them were getting too much shit for their offense. The bigger criticim of both of them was their complete inability to defend. If they can score but end up giving up more points than they get then the Nets have gotten worse. This could still go either way and the Playoffs are an entirely different game than the regular season. How do Blake and LMA handle when they're asked to defend Giannis, Tobias or Butler for spurts? Say they make it through to the Finals; how do they do defending Lebron and AD or Jokic and Murray. Conversely we've seen that both Blake and LMA have struggled a bit with scoring; are they able to perform offensively in the playoffs against tighter defenses that might be looking for the two of them to be taking the shots?  They're very likely both great improvements to the team but there's still a good chance that they won't be all that impactful come playoffs and they definitely aren't filling any positions of need for a Nets team with one of, if not the best scoring trio's ever assembled."
"Wow, so you’re telling me well run teams with a decent chance at a ring get more out of the leagues rules than poorly run or rebuilding teams ?  Like what would a team like the Knicks get out of signing Blake griffin for a season this year ?"
"&gt; How many former all-stars get waived when they can still play well like Griffin and Aldridge?  Both Blake and LMA weren't playing well, they where playing at vet min levels."
Being the Lakers has to be dope. You signed the 2nd best big in the buyout market and nobody bitches about you. Instead you get to chill while people complain about LMA and Blake Griffin in 2021.
Blake Griffin played 3 games. With no KD or Kyrie everyone else gets more shots. With them he's also going to give you 4 points
"It's actually pretty uncommon for buyout guys to step in the playoffs (Morris is a notable exception on a champion).  However, that's probably going to change now that teams are allowing buyouts on players that never would have gotten them in the past.  Like even current Blake Griffin &amp; LMA (&amp; Drummond) are likely going to get more than a vet minimum on their next contracts.  That used to be extremely rare with buyout guys."
Exactly. They both don't add anything to the nets. Blake griffin is gonna be used for pick and rolls and nothing else. I'm a nets fan and i would take more Claxton minutes and acquiring someone like javelle Mcgee over Aldridge and griffin any day.
"I know I'm like ""who tf is that 4th person? DeAndre Jordan? I mean, hes kind of washed for being a starter on the top contender in the east, but *polarizing*??    I'm just going to guess Blake Griffin (circa 2012)"
"Ok so i agree in theory, esp if someone like jj had been bought out. Drummond and Aldridge arent really that good. Last year it was marvin williams.   We all act up when these semi-washed guys go ring chase but do they really impact the team they go to?   Drummond was trash on the cavs, look at their record. Who in the nba is more scared of the lakers with drummond?   Same with blake griffin and aldridge, sure they might help string together a few wins when all your superstars are out, but they arent significant contributors to a healthy team."
Any other team can pick up the player via waivers. If someone really wanted Blake Griffin they could have had him.
I'm also wondering why people think it's some kind of coup for the Nets to land two often injured big men in their 30s who haven't been factors for years.   Like Griffin last played most of a full season in 2018 to 2019. He's not 2014 Blake Griffin. LMA is 35. Neither of these guys are going to be what puts the Nets over the top. We don't even know what they will be able to contribute.
"Experience matters. Veteran leadership matters.   Would I rather have Blake Griffin on the end of my bench for $1.2M or Gary Clark for $1.9M?  Playoff experience:   Blake Griffin: 1870 minutes 21.2ppg   Gary Clark: 148 minutes 5.3ppg  Accolades:   Blake Griffin:    #1 Overall Pick / ROTY / 6X All-Star / 5X All-NBA / Dunk Contest winner / National College Player of the Year  Gary Clark:   AAC Player of the Year / NBA G League Champion  Neither are going to matter much come playoff time, but Blake brings more to the table than just a body on the bench. Same goes for LMA (2668 PO minutes)."
"Exactly! Don’t know why people, including Blake Griffin himself, don’t understand this."
"I thought the NBA had a salary rule that a veteran player with considerable time in the league like LMA or Griffin had a much higher minimum salary they had to be paid over a rookie? Maybe I just read poor information, but that's insane that Drummond, LMA, &amp; Blake who all had these huge $10m+/year salaries could be picked up for just a $1m or so to finish out the season."
"They see Blake Griffin dunk and all of a sudden he's 2013-2014 Blake Griffin again, apparently."
I think the nuance here is that Blake Griffin at $30m/yr sucks and Blake griffin at $1m/yr is great. Value does a lot for how a player’s talent is perceived. Am I the only one who understands this?
Is Blake Griffin bad as a first option? Yes  Is Blake Griffin bad as a fifth option with loads of spacing? No   Ok then
2021 Blake Griffin on a lottery team is useless  2021 Blake Griffin on a title contender is HUGE
That was always going to be the case especially after the Harden trade. I think it’s everyone freaking out over Blake griffin and Lamarcus that has people confused.
So Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge are no longer good players?  Then why are we all so bent out of shape they went to Brooklyn?!?
I mean yes....  Also none of these players are gonna end up mattering almost never do. If the nets win it won’t be because of the play of Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge
"Yeah but what happens when a Blake Griffin ends up at Orlando first pick off the waivers? My bet, he ain’t playing"
Blake Griffin and Aldridge are trash. Let's stop acting like the nets made good moves. These two have nothing left in the tank.
"4 years ago, a lineup of Irving/Harden/KD/Griffin/Aldridge probably would challenge Golden State for best lineup ever.  Still a monster lineup now even though Blake and LaMarcus have lost a step."
"I disagree, I think it's about relative value. Yes, those guys are past their primes. But they're still above average bench guys. Most teams run an 8 man rotation in the playoffs. That woulda left the Nets with Jeff Green as their best backup PF/C. He's been playing well this year but I'd still take a washed LMA as my backup C over a washed Jeff Green. Same with Blake Griffin and whoever the nets were planning on running as their backup at that position.   Those two guys are better than most teams' backup PF/C, so they have positive value."
"LMA and Blake Griffin are role-players at this point in their careers, who actually gives a shit about this? Genuinely curious? Nobody ever cried this much during the Cavs-Warriors era."
Blake griffin and andre drummond really about to go play in the nba finals
"This is your opinion. Crazy how you think it’s a 35 year old LMA and a Blake Griffin who has to ice after 15 minutes of game time and can’t play back to backs is the issue. Not James Harden who was an MVP runner 2 seasons ago and an MVP before that. Use your brain, look past the names and you’ll see that it’s nothing special apart from extra depth."
"I have seen Jokić play, he plays for my national team lmao   &gt;this is a braindead comp youre comparing someone with crazy athleticism but injury problems like griffin to jokic.   Someone hasn't seen 2018-2019 Blake Griffin...."
"Seriously comparing Blake Griffin and Jokic? Blake’s passing comes nowhere near the level of Jokic’s. Blake had to develop his game further because of the way the game changed and because of his injuries.   What about Jokic’s game is going to have to change as he ages? He can shoot, he can pass, he uses his size well in the post. Sure he won’t be able to drive as well but it’s not gonna drastically effect his game."
+ Prime Harden  + Prime Kyrie  + Deandre Jordan  + Blake Griffin  + LaMarcus Aldridge.   Heck half of the old Team USA.
"Lakers signed the reigning Sixth Man of the Year from the Rival LA team and Dennis Schroeder, who finished second, in the off season while also signing a prime Drummond but are having an epileptic fit over the Nets signing washed up Blake Griffin and Aldridge. The cognitive dissonance is truly stunning."
10-day contracts LMFAO. Imagine coming in trading all your picks for Blake Griffin and then just bouncing.
"I think the NBA needs to do more to prevent super teams from forming.  I think the idea of a super team like the Dream Team is cool but when used in an 82 game format, diminishes the overall product.  This has caused the ring chasing dilemma because there is no parity.  Role players sacrifice money to join a super team and can bolster their legacies with rings.   Brooklyn is the only team right now with a bona-fide big three and they are clearly favored to win it all.  The fact that the Nets could pull off landing KD, Kyrie, and Harden is incredible but should never happen.  Its cool to watch them play together but from a fan's perspective, there is no real competition.  That is not good for a professional sport where every guy on every team works hard to win.  The worst part is they know they don't have a shot at winning.  Sports are about competition and while super teams push other teams to get better, its almost like playing 2k without turning the salary cap on lol.  Of course you're going to win if three top 10 players are on the same team.  In answer to OP, championships should only be used as a way to separate players with similar careers when comparing them in GOAT or hall of fame conversations.  When Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge inevitably get a ring this year, I don't think it will bolster either of their legacies much.  Kevin Garnett and Dirk Nowitzki only had one ring but no one is saying those two had better careers than them.  However, compare them to someone on their allstar caliber level like Zach Randolph or Amare Stoudemire who never won a championship, then their rings hold some merit as to who had the better career."
One of my friends tried to tell me that he wasn't and isn't better than a young blake griffin ... clearly was bugging
"In comparison to other buyouts with his contract and just his contract in general, it is barely anything.  Andre Drummond's contract this year was for $28,751,775. Over a 72-game season, that is $399,330 per game. Given that there are 28 games remaining after the trade for the Cavaliers, they agreed to pay him for 26 of those remaining 28 games, or 92.9% of his salary. In the long-term of things, they paid him $10,382,580 to walk away while he gave back $794,534.  The other example coming up is Blake Griffin. Now Blake is a slightly different case as he had 2-years left, but he had Detroit on the books for over $62mm between this season and next. This year's contract of $32,455,565 for the 72 game-season clocks in at 450,771 per game. The agreement that BG came to was to give back $13.3mm back to the Pistons to get out of his contract -- this is the total given back between the $16,227,756 still owed this year and the $29,764,126 owed next year; or 28.9% of the $45,990,882 still owed overall. He's essentially giving back a quarter of the next two seasons as compared to Drummond giving back 1/14th of this season.  Honestly, I think the NBA is going to be hard-pressed to find a solution for this. The NBPA will clearly be trying to keep it as-is to protect the players, but the Drummond buyout of sacrificing $0 to leave a rebuilding team with nothing but a veteran-minimum contract amount back to join a stacked contender for next-to-nothing is not a good look for the NBA or Small Market Teams."
"The nets are not an “ultra team” they have 2 superstars, one of which who is a known playoff choker, 1 star and a decent role players. LMA and Blake Griffin are complete wash ups — you know it and I know it. The Lakers won the championship, and still added Dennis, Trez, Gasol, and now Drummond but I bet you didn’t think anything was wrong with that.   I think the Lakers still win it all. You give LeBron a running mate as good as AD and I’ll never bet against him. Hope you get smoked though."
"C'mon you're disrespecting the Sixers and Lakers. Nets have no answer for Embiid or AD, and the Lakers also have a loaded roster when healthy.   And it's washed LMA and Blake Griffin that makes them invincible? C'mon."
"Kd literally took part in recruiting harden, aldridge, and blake griffin. Fuck outta here."
He's never been good. He grabbed a lot of rebounds and put up a lot of points on well below league average efficiency.  Both Blake Griffin and Lamarcus aldridge are better than Drummond right now.
"Wait, did Nets Great Blake Griffin used to play for the Pistons? I hadn't heard."
"Blake griffin can just quit on the team, made ppl think he's outta his prime. Then when he's on a winning team , he can start trying and start dunking as per usual."
I don't know about that. LeBron's playmaking and high BBIQ were very apparent in his rookie year. I simply don't see anything near that with Zion. He'll be a better Blake Griffin.
Don't forget about Blake Griffin
"Oh fuck off. Nobody is exploiting multi millionaires. Players that are getting payed many millions of dollars a year to play on a bad team can fucking cry me a river. If you put in 100% effort all the time and your team doesn’t put good pieces around you, fair play. But if you clearly phone it in on your current team and you phoning it in directly results in your team having a worse record, then you don’t deserve to get to choose to go to any contender you want (looking at you Blake Griffin). Also, very fitting that a Lakers fan is defending players’ rights to go wherever they want."
Okay Rudy is a beast for years now but let's not pretend he was even close to on the same level as prime Blake Griffin
"Yeah, he’s awesome. He’s just a role player though. If Blake Griffin and LMA aren’t better than a role player I promise it’s not as big of a deal as you think it is."
Why are you comparing Gobert to Blake fucking Griffin
"He was basically washed at that point because of repeated foot injuries.  Don't try to act like he was some sort of star at that point.  He was a 33-year-old who couldn't even play 20 mpg because of lingering injuries.  It's not too dissimilar from Blake Griffin joining the Nets.  Feel free to keep arguing this with me, but I actually watched the team play.  Walton was a solid role player.  He was not ""in his prime""."
"And Derrick Rose, Tracy McGrady, Blake Griffin, Chris Webber, and Khris Middleton"
I didn’t whine once. I could care less about old man Blake griffin tough guy dunking on his former Pistons team and LaMarcus he’s still in the league? Aldridge.   The Nets are a clown team that won’t survive the eastern conference and barely hanging on to a top spot in the east cause everyone else in the conference is trash. Totally soft schedule. Receipt me.
"Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Bruce Brown, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Reggie Bullock are all in NY now"
"empty stats. andre drummond, blake griffin, and lamarcus aldridge are the 3 most overrated players in the nba at this point"
My man... it's 2021; Austin Rivers is better than Blake Griffin or LaMarcus Aldridge.
You just described Blake griffin
Oh maybe you missed when the same exact thing happened to Blake Griffin and LMA
"I disagree. Dennis Schroder, Gasol and Montrezl are not better than Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan and Lamarcus Aldridge. But if you add Andre drummond to the list, instead of Gasol. Then they’re probably equal."
1. KD 2. Harden 3. Kyrie 4. Joe Harris 5. Nicolas Claxton 6. Jeff Green 7. Bruce Brown 8. DeAndre Jordan 9. Blake Griffin 10. LMA
Just complete fucking bullshit that Blake Griffin blatantly sandbagged to get out of Detroit and then the Nets get him for free. And to think they would've had Aldridge too if he hadn't had a health condition. Nobody is beating this team in the playoffs if they're healthy. Fuck.
Blake Griffin
"Ayton, Book, and Craig played well tonight. Book bounced back from a rough stretch and finally made some threes. Craig played pretty decent defense (unfortunately Durant beats decent defense). Ayton allowed himself to get triggered by Blake Griffin which is too bad because outside of that mental lapse he had an excellent game.  CP3 was pretty bad (RIP Ast:TO ratio). Looked a bit sluggish which is unsurprising considering his age and how tough this road trip has been.  It might sound ridiculous but Jevon Carter and Cam lost us the game in the third. We were right with them all game and then they bricked 3s on a bunch of possessions in a row and the Nets did their Nets thing on the other end."
Blake Griffin bullied the Suns in the third and fourth. He was taking every advantage possible.
And Blake Griffin and Jeff green
DJ is a better matchup on Drummond. Lol at you mentioning skinny Claxton and Blake Griffin what clown shit is this. Drummond would barely play after getting abused in the PNR by Harden
Blake griffin playing the Draymond green role for this team and I’m here for it
Blake Griffin - still a flopper.
It was better when Blake Griffin was in a losing team and low profile so I wouldn't have to watch his acting on contact
"Dude he’s 6’6” and the heaviest player in the league.  He would need to make major major adjustments a la Blake Griffin, expect even better, bc he’s already had the knee and ankle injuries that prove he’s not lebron level durable. Also if he only misses 10-15 games a season over his career, combined with how much time he’s already missed and that’s 15%-20% of career games missed barring no other major injury."
"Their problem is that they really have don’t have a defensive big man. Their best players are at the 1,2 and 3. So...they can’t really stop the easy paint points.  Harden,KD and Kyrie can hit tough shots but if blake is the best defender teams will just hunt mismatches and switches.    KD and Griffin being the best defenders is an issue if their shots aren’t falling."
"I also worry about Zion relying too much on said athleticism and breaking down like Blake Griffin. But hey, if he can peak, and get his team a chip, his career is gold."
I like the idea of showing players who developed into shooters later in their career  If you told someone that Blake Griffin would be hitting 38% on 6 threes a game in year 10 they'd think he'd have won a couple MVPs
Blake Griffin missed most of that season due to injury though.
Blake Griffin
Spot the difference: Dwight Powell and prime Blake Griffin
Baron Davis &amp; Blake Griffin
Blake Griffin is still washed lol. I’d rather have Kevin.
Orange Julius so sick with it. Blake griffin 2.0
Blake griffin is washed lol. It's different. I don't care about his loyalty. That loyal boy always choke come playoff time yet no one hold him accountable lol. He always got a free pass. Then again he won't win shit that's maybe the reason why.
Fuck outta here with the Dame hate. Dude could have gone to a big market team and had an easier road like Blake Griffin. Is that what you want? He’s working through injuries and has very little help on D. He’ll bounce back for playoffs.
"For comparison, other players that finished 3rd place in MVP voting: Blake Griffin, Jermaine O’Neal, and Peja Stojakovic."
blake griffin used to have a 3 head
"More on track now than they have been in a while. I'd rather build a future around a handful of young lottery picks than Drummond, DRose, and Blake Griffin."
"He was pretty down on Blake Griffin even thought he played for HIS Oklahoma Sooners, so I would think it would be the same for LeBron. Talking about how he tried to love him, only for him to let him down over and over."
"Dinwiddie will be interesting this offseason.   Most likely he will sign elsewhere since he’s said he wants a larger role and this would be his first big potential payday. Odds are the Nets aren’t going to offer the $18-20m per year he wants since their tax situation would likely cost $1.75 for every $1 they sign FA’s with.    If Dinwiddie agrees to a Sign and Trade then Brooklyn would open up potential cap space in the form of a Trade Exception similar to what the Celtics worked out with Hayward when he went to Charlotte. It would also open up the market for teams that can sign Dinwiddie.   Nets can likely sign Mike James again or some other backup PG for much less $ than Dinwiddie should get in FA. Harden, Kyrie, and Durant do a lot of on ball so Dinwiddie would be a massive luxury.   Tsai could just pay the Tax and re sign Dinwiddie at the end of the day.    Then it comes down to can the Nets keep Blake Griffin around for the Vet Min since Detroit still paying him $29m next year. That would leave the Nets with the Tax Mid Level Exception $3y/$18m and Bi Annual Exception 2y/$7.4m to sign FA’s in the offseason. Tax MLE may be able to be split in half to sign 2 players but I’m not 100% certain.   Nets also have their 1st which is like 26/27th range to add a player or use the players rights in a trade. Dinwiddie could create another $15m+ in open cap space if he agrees to a Sign and Trade.    Nets should have at least 2-4 open roster spots depending on Blake Griffin and Mike James since James rights are still held by his Euro team who just re signed the coach who got into a fight w/ James and led to him playing for the Nets. Griffin is just a normal Unrestricted Free Agent.    Dinwiddie and TLC are 2 roster spots that are likely open. Guess it can get up to the 5 roster spot range depending on Tyler Johnson. Nets also have a Euro SG named Isaia Cordinier who they may be interested in bringing over."
"If CP3 could get to the conference finals without being behind an MVP then there wouldn't be any ifs in your argument. You're saying if this or that happened then CP3 would've had success.  Russ did have success. Russ made the finals.   You're arguing that CP3 could've if everything had gone well. Well no shit. That could go for literally any player. If kawhi didn't make the shot over philly maybe Embiid has a ring. But kawhi made the shot so embiid doesn't. If MJ didn't exist lots of guys in the 90s would have rings.   And you keep saying ""well Russ played with KD"" like ok? CP3 played with harden and blake griffin. Still didn't do shit except blow series leads consistently if he ever even got a series lead. Fuckin josh Smith lead a 3-1 series comeback on them lmao."
Blake Griffin here
"Was KD wrong to go to the Warriors? Lol, he won a ring and now Harden and Blake Griffin are doing the same thing this year with KD and Kyrie"
1. Westbrook 2. Vince Carter 3. LeBron James 4. Blake Griffin 5. James Harden 6. Allen Iverson 7. Shaq 8. Luka 9. Jokic 10. J. Cole
"One of my favorite moments of Austin's time with the Clippers was Blake Griffin impersonating him in practice by acting like he couldn't dribble, waving off screens and then throwing up a runner that missed the basket by several feet. It's crazy that the Clippers let Doc get away with trading picks to Boston for his own son just so he could stay on his rookie contract when the Celtics were reportedly going to cut him anyway. Clips could have had him for a min deal for a year and a half instead of the $4-5 million they ended up paying him because of the trade."
"  Chris Webber  (Sixers was the beginning of the end)  Allen Iverson (got bounced around Memphis, Detroit. He was just a shell of his old self. Honestly this was the most PAINFUL to watch. This might be Westbrook someday)  Currently happening: Blake Griffin."
"Coming from a Pistons fan, had Blake Griffin finished the season out with Detroit, it’s hard to imagine he wouldn’t have ended up on the list somewhere. The dude was flat out terrible in Detroit this year and caused Troy Weaver to blow the whole team up. He started 20 games averaging 31.3 minutes and shooting 36.5% FG (31.5% 3PT) and recorded 0 dunks. He basically stunk his way out of Detroit and stuffed us with his max contract and now is on a championship contender. Just a terrible scenario for fans of Detroit."
San Bowie&gt;Kenny Anderson&gt;Paul Pierce&gt;Blake Griffin&gt;Kevin Durant&gt;Steph Curry&gt;Andre Igoudala&gt;Trevor Ariza&gt;Kobe Bryant&gt;Shaquille O’Neal&gt;Steve Kerr&gt;Michael Jordan.
Yeah if I’m Russell Westbrook I want to have to play against Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons on defense instead of Kyrie Irving and Blake Griffin
"George was worse than Kawhi of course. You are missing my point. One narrative distracts from the other. Kawhi's performance in two huge games went under the radar because people were having so much fun making fun of PG.  Harrison Barnes choked a lot harder than Curry in the 2016 finals but that didn't stop Curry from getting criticized. Blake Griffin was awful in the clippers collapse against the Rockets and yet CP3 got a ton of shit even though he played well. Superstars are held to a higher standard but Kawhi kinda slips through the cracks sometimes because he's doesn't have a public personality people resonate with.  I'm not even anti-kawhi im just noting something odd that happens with the media and with NBA fans. Seriously think about the shit people say when LeBron, Harden, Curry, Giannis come up short."
I went to MSG when they were really bad against Blake Griffin Pistons and the seats I got were still around the $80 range  Granted they they really sucked ass but still a lot 🥲
"Blake Griffin. I'm not into the Nets but if they really do pull it off, Blake getting a ring would be a nice silver lining."
Not a problem when they can just get guys like Blake griffin on minimum
"Hindsight is 20/20 + Not knowing where that 2021 pick will be makes all this highly speculative until 2021 pick position has been confirmed.    Even then, I haven't been following NBA prospects last year or this, but wouldn't teams have very little data on the prospects coming in and how they fare with their competition?  So essentially a #1 or #2 pick is a wash unless Edwards had the reputation of a Blake Griffin or Zion?    So if I was the Warriors, the answer is no.  I'd take the second pick and roll the dice on the Wolves pick because the Wolves just can't win.  Because I don't think there was a must have player in the draft (or at least there wasn't enough data) I still think the Wolves would have had to ask for more to try and get their 2021 pick back.  (Because their 2021 pick has always been pretty valuable.)"
Paying market rate for a  player in Free Agency or through trades is a lot different than getting former All Stars for the vet mininum.  Blake Griffin is done as a top tier player but he will still command the mid level exception next year.  The rules should be changed. Apron teams can't sign buyout players and a limit of 1 signing will fix the issue
I will believe it if it actually happen they have been let downs for so long now dating back to the CP3 and Blake Griffin days where they blow so many chances it not even funny.
"When you got 3 bigs on the floor with the Lakers (one being the ultimate playmaker, mind you), who’s gonna guard Lebron? Ok Kd. Who’s then got Ad? An older Jeff green or older Blake griffin? Umm sure. And then who’s got Drummond? Washed-up Deandre Jordan?! Lmao.   Do you see the problem? These other teams have defensive issues when it comes to guarding the Lakers. I’m not saying the Lakers can fully guard the nets, they got firepower out the ass, but the Lakers are one of the best teams equipped to defend them.   Jokic doesn’t have Murray and if they couldn’t knock off the lakers last year, they aren’t doing this year without a Jamal Murray. So bringing up the nuggets is just dumb.   But idk why you are now bringing up other teams. You started with the suns, and sorry to say the suns are not beating the Lakers 4 out of 7."
"I mean, sure.   But no one is arguing DeRozan wouldn't be an awesome 4th scorer on a stacked team. Swap him out with Blake Griffin on Brooklyn and he's wiping the floor vs. bench guys. But he's been an understandably under-whelming high-stakes player for... his entire career now."
"As a Pistons fan I can there's definite flaws here  Detroit has Bey, Stew, and Killian who are rookie 1st rounders. Josh Jackson is a project. I also dont know if you included Blake Griffin or not  We didnt underachieve at all. We were supposed to be bad this season"
Lol. Do you watch basketball?  https://www.sportscasting.com/blake-griffin-was-just-told-hes-not-good-at-basketball-anymore-by-the-pistons-in-the-nicest-way-possible/
Blake Griffin right now is significantly better than love. Love is the slowest center in the nba who can’t even play center because he’s the worst rim protecting big in the nba
Same was said about Blake Griffin. Lol. Are you happy with him?
Love is still a solid contributor on a playoff team. He just hates losing. He has more to offer than Blake Griffin.   Only knock is that terrible contract.
" &gt;32 isn’t that old if you ask me  What if you ask DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love, or Derek Rose? They all seem pretty far from their peak. They are all 32."
"It has KD, Harden, and Jeff Green. Plus Oklahoma’s own Blake Griffin"
The one who Blake Griffin almost killed himself yes
" it's a super common term and has been for a long time. you know that the CP3/Blake Griffin clippers team was literally called ""Lob City"" as a nickname because of the oops between the two right? lmfao. this is the dumbest shit i've ever heard."
Blake Griffin in 2021
Poor mans Blake Griffin literally wouldn't sniff the playoffs
The Blake Griffin of shot blocking forwards
there's a Fuck Blake Griffin bandwagon flair?
Lmao so what do y’all want to happen to OKC for tanking for HALF A SEASON (a season where we wouldn’t have even made the playin if everyone was healthy)? You talking about double standards but that applies here too. Everyone is going crazy about OKC sitting Horford but no one had a problem when the Cavs sat Drummond or when the Pistons sat Blake Griffin. I bet The same people bitching about how OKC is tanking have watched 0 minutes of Thunder basketball this season even when SGA was playing. All of this bs is just weird to me.
LaMarcus Aldridge and Blake Griffin were both bought out this season because their contracts were untradeable.
Blake Griffin was bought out. So there is one contract.
More like a young Amare or Blake griffin imo
Wild to think that his biggest moment prior to being moved into the starting lineup in the 2014 first round was when he got himself ejected on Christmas Day to bait a second tech out of Blake Griffin lmfao
Leading towards Blake Griffin.
"Better than Blake Griffin on eye test? Yeah sure. Leading the league in charges, #2 seed"
"How did Jason Kidd (the only star for the Nets) or Steve Nash the 2x MVP of the Suns not have the same responsibility Paul had?   Kidd made two finals with Kerry Kittles and Kenyon Martin as his best players. Nash made the WCF with Amar'e injured and out for the season in 2006. He also made it three other times. Both of them were their team's star players. It's not like Nash and Kidd were coasting on another player's coattails. They were their team's clear cut best players during multiple deep playoff runs. Even Nash's first WCF run in 2003, he was Dallas' second best player behind Dirk (similar to Paul's role in 2018 with Houston), and Kidd in 2011 was Dallas' 3rd or 4th best player when Dallas won their title.   Chris Paul played alongside David West and Tyson Chandler in New Orleans, and then alongside DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin and JJ Reddick in LA, then as a second star alongside James Harden in Houston. Paul has had about the same responsibility as Kidd and Nash and same caliber of teammates too."
"""Hello Police? This is Blake Griffin, Chris Paul is trying to beat me up!"""
We’ve seen huge spikes like this before i.e. blake Griffin.   Blake went from 27% to 40% but on low attempts as has been in the 35% range
Blake Griffin i rememebr was pretty fun to watch when he was with clippers but now he plays a bit differently
"Why does Blake Griffin never get shit for winning ROY after sitting out, but Ben does? Makes no sense."
That's why we like this guy. No more scraping 40 wins to get the eight seed anymore. No Blake Griffin and Drummond weighing down our cap anymore. Just gonna fucking suck the next year or two so we can finally put together a team.
"You think Mike James ever thought he’d be part of a clip that includes KD, Blake Griffin, and Steve Nash talking about a highlight of this caliber that he was a key part of"
at whatever point it was that Blake Griffin got to would be my guess
I would replace Blake Griffin with Green. Not as good of a shooter but he’s more well rounded while still being a decent enough shooter.
"Russ is actually a 2 guard that requires as much of the ball time as a 1 guard.   Curry is a 2 guard that is forced to play 1 due to size.   And Magic is a PF who does everything a PG is required todo but he sure as hell can’t guard speedy 1s.   So it really really all depends on team composition.  I don’t think there can be a clear unanimous winner.    Steph would average 35-10 playing alongside prime  LeBron while CP3 really could have averaged 15 assists playing with KD and Klay. You also wonder if Dame had a Shaq, would that have just been a dynasty, and if this dynasty won 5 rings then would Dame be considered top 3 all time?  Same Dame, same talent level, 5 rings.   Jason Kidd or CP3 who both were really winners and leaders of their super exciting teams that just wouldn’t make the final cut. Replace Blake with AD and now that’s a championship team. If memory serves Kidd had Jason Collins at 5 and KMart at 4. I love KMart but....  he was really a lite version of Blake Griffin."
"The issue with analyzing any player is that there's 2 very distinct ways to analyze players:  1. Through the lens of how good they are innately. 2. Through the lens of how good they are in relationship to their contract / cap space they take up.  I really like Wiggins. Through (1) he is a very good player. Through (2) he's overpaid but still a good enough fit for the Warriors that it works. People hating on Wiggins were/are primarily hating on him because of (2). He's not a max contract dude. No one (I think) is going to argue that Wiggins isn't worth a vet minimum contract. His worth is somewhere in the middle.  Blake Griffin/Andre Drummond/Kevin Love are horrible in regards to (2) with max contracts but for the most part, still a steal for a vet minimum.  IMO so much confusion of a players ""value"" or ""skill"" revolves around people talking about a player through these 2 different lenses and getting into ridiculous arguments when in reality, 1 person is arguing through lens 1 (their innate value), and the other is arguing through lens 2 (their value in relationship to their contract)."
Bro Blake Griffin really fooled like 98% of nba journalists. NETS TAMPERED
"Blake is playing great though. I don't understand fans urge to downplay the fact that Blake Griffin is on that team. Not to mention having KD/Harden/Kyrie, possibly the greatest offensive roster ever constructed."
