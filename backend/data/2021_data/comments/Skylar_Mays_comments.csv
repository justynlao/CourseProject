"Not OP, but we didn't have  Bogdanovic - Starting SG  Rondo - Backup PG  Gallinari - 6th man with starter minutes  OO - Rookie big man at a very thin position for us  Dunn - 3rd String PG  If all our guys were healthy, Bruno Fernando, Skylar Mays, Nathan Knight, and Brandon Goodwin would probably be g leaguers, or at the very least like 2 of them.  Not comparable to yall, but stop acting like we're not dealing with injuries of our own. Yall got hit harder, but it can't be you're one big excuse."

Skylar Mays dunking the ball to give him a career high 20 points in a 30 point blowout loss to the spurs in mid January.
"Between Skylar Mays, Nathan Knight, Bruno Fernando, and Kris Dunn, the Hawks have 24 chances to hack Ben Simmons."
Hox in 4   A literal number was never gonna best an actual predatory bird.  Ben Simmons is a shit Skylar Mays etc. etc.
Okay we‚Äôre winning by a lot but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre winning by a Skylar Mays margin
Skylar Mays sighting.
YEAHHH Skylar Mays in a playoff game!!!
"How about the 2018 Cavs?  &gt; Traded Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat for a 2024 2nd round draft pick.

"Stephen Silas, there is a way to beat the Hawks. Please watch the Magic game. You need to stop Skylar Mays P&amp;R by having the guard go over the pick and the big man drop to prevent penetration. If Skylar stops and pulls-up mid-range, that is a win."
"2018 Cavs  &gt; Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give LeBron James and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, ‚ÄúThere you go! There you go.‚Äù Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard J.R. Smith yelled out, ‚ÄúWe got an [expletive] squad now.‚Äù And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù  &gt; ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, I like being around guys that want to win and work hard,‚Äù James said. ‚ÄúI know I demand a lot of excellence in my teammates. I demand it out of myself, too. On the road, we are going to play as well as we can and put ourselves in contention to compete for another championship. And that‚Äôs my mindset.‚Äù  After making these 3 trades on Feb 8, 2018:  * Traded Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat for a 2024 2nd round draft pick. (Pick is heavily protected and not expected to convey.)  * Traded Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas and a 2018 1st round draft pick (Moritz Wagner was later selected) to the Los Angeles Lakers for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr..  * As part of a 3-team trade, the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Jae Crowder, Derrick Rose and a 2024 2nd round draft pick to the Utah Jazz; the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Dimitrios Agravanis, Iman Shumpert, $2.1M cash and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Sacramento Kings; the Sacramento Kings traded Art≈´ras Gudaitis and George Hill to the Cleveland Cavaliers; the Utah Jazz traded Rodney Hood to the Cleveland Cavaliers; and the Utah Jazz traded Joe Johnson and $1.1M cash to the Sacramento Kings. (UTA receives right to exchange 2024 second-round pick with CLE.) (SAC receives MIA 2020 second-round pick from CLE.)"
He has to have the ball in his hands for the offense to function. The only other person on the team who can make the offense work is Skylar Mays
"The injuries with this team are unbelieveable.  We now have the worst bench in the NBA again and are down two/three starters from last year if this turns into a longterm issue.  Anyone who projects this Hawks record as a failing on Trae Young is either an idiot or is making an argument in bad faith.  Trae was just out there with Tony Snell, Skylar Mays, Okongwu, and Kevin Huerter in the early half of the 3rd quarter"
That was Skylar Mays not Trae Young
Skylar Mays for president
"Been impressed with Skylar Mays, our bench offense doesn't look completely useless and lost when he's out there"
"Lloyd Pierces time is up. Why the fuck is Kevin Huerter getting more touches than Trae in the 4th? Why isn‚Äôt Skylar Mays getting more minutes? Why aren‚Äôt you adjusting against Julius Randle? If someone is that hot, you just straight up deny him a shot. Make him pass."
Skylar Mays is nice
"Bring in the man himself: Skylar Mays, he's going to save you"
I guess Skylar Mays for the 82nd best player in the league is fair .
I'm just glad that bad man Skylar Mays can't hurt us anymore
"&gt; Skylar Mays put on a show in the fourth  Made me check the box score and:  16min, 20/1/3/1, +/- : +25  Damn, awesome game for him."
Yea I'd trade Skylar Mays for Demar Derozen and uh your next 10 1st rounders should do it.
We have the goats Skylar Mays and Brandon Knight so yea you could say they're amazing.
Skylar Mays almost singlehandedly made the box score more palatable. We were on our way to losing by 50 tonight. San Antonio couldn't miss a three most of the game.
never forget the day Skylar Mays was unleashed upon this foul earth
This is officially Skylar Mays‚Äô teamüòà
Okongwu has been injured the majority of the season so hard to tell. He‚Äôs getting more minutes as the back up now with JC out and he‚Äôs looked really good the past 3 games. His offense needs a bit of work but man his Defense already looks pretty good. I think when he actually gets to have a preseason and practice he will turn into exactly as advertised. Our 2 way rookies Skylar Mays and Nathan Knight have both been good too. Nothing spectacular but they look like they belong on an NBA court. Which is a big positive for a second rounder and an undrafted guy
"Literally just in the last 3.5 years   -  June 19, 2017: Traded a 2017 1st round draft pick (Markelle Fultz was later selected) to the Philadelphia 76ers for a 2017 1st round draft pick (Jayson Tatum was later selected) and a 2019 1st round draft pick (Romeo Langford was later selected)  - July 7, 2017: Traded Avery Bradley and a 2019 2nd round draft pick (Isaiah Roby was later selected) to the Detroit Pistons for Marcus Morris.  - August 30, 2017: Traded Jae Crowder, Isaiah Thomas, Ante ≈Ωi≈æiƒá, a 2018 1st round draft pick (Collin Sexton was later selected) and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Kyrie Irving.   - July 6, 2019: Traded Aron Baynes and Ty Jerome to the Phoenix Suns for a 2020 1st round draft pick (Desmond Bane was later selected). (top-7 protected)  - July 6, 2019: Traded Terry Rozier and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Grant Riller was later selected) to the Charlotte Hornets for Kemba Walker and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Yam Madar was later selected)."
I saw somewhere that skylar Mays was putting up numbers . This true ?
* John Collins -23 * Kevin Huerter-22 * De'Andre Hunter-23 * Cam Reddish-21 * Trae Young-22 * Onyeka Okongwu-20 * Jalen Johnson (R)-19 * Sharife Cooper (R)-20 * Skylar Mays (2-Way)-23  Hawks have 9
So do the Hawks but we're actually good   Trae: 22   Collins: 23   Hunter: 23   Cam: 21   Huerter: 22   Okongwu: 20   Sharife Cooper: 20   Jalen Johnson: 19   Skylar Mays: 23   Actually we have 9
The disrespect for Skylar Mays
Skylar Mays
"Hi, Skylar Mays here with the Atlanta Hawks"
"I hope he is healthy. I think the plan was to keep him for next year here but with Cooper being drafted, he needs a path to the spot minutes Dunn would likely pick up. We also have Skylar Mays.  I can‚Äôt even give a scouting report on what he can give now lmao everything is based off what he did in Chicago. Legit was a 0 here cuz of injury."
"Nobody has outwardly complained but one of the pluses of Hunter, Cam, Bogi, Gallo, etc. all missing time last year is that the people who took their minutes like Solomon Hill, Tony Snell, Skylar Mays etc. don‚Äôt need shots. Guys like Bogi could get 20 attempts and be in a supreme rhythm throughout the game. Now outside of Okungwu, we‚Äôre healthy. We have guys on our 3rd unit who still deserve rotation minutes but can‚Äôt get them. And rotation players who are starting level caliber. Our offense has looked weird at times because you can tell we‚Äôre trying to figure what works with who and trying to get certain players going."
"skylar mays looks kinda like a rounder, fuzzier john legend"
SKYLAR MAYS TAKING A CHARGE IN GARBAGE TIME  THE LEGEND
"Lol it‚Äôs preseason and we didn‚Äôt have Trae, Capela, Bogi, and Gallinari. We had to start Skylar Mays in the second half. Be nice"
"Damian Jones graduated with an engineering degree at Vanderbilt. I‚Äôve seen on a few sites that he also graduated with a 4.0 GPA, but I don‚Äôt know how accurate that is.  Skylar Mays also finished with a 3.93 GPA in pre-med at LSU and plans to finish med school after his NBA career is over."
Skylar Mays sounds like a pornstar name
"Oh no, I love Skylar Mays. That one week of time when he balled out and actually earned a little bit of playing time was fun. He just doesn‚Äôt play unless we are murdered with injuries or were running victory laps lol."
ATL Legend Bruno Fernando and Skylar Mays
lmao. is this serious or did you completely forget about skylar mays?
Skylar Mays 50 piece today book it
"Brandon Goodwin on Harden, Skylar Mays on Kyrie, and Nathan Knight on Durant"
The hawks theoretically have better depth. In actuality we‚Äôve been playing Nathan Knight and Skylar Mays for significant minutes for months.  Do you know them?
SKYLAR MAYS MINUTES
Our only other PGs are Skylar Mays and Kris Dunn
We‚Äôve seen enough bring in Skylar Mays
Skylar Mays
"If Skylar Mays wins the title this year, I rank him top 2,544 of all time"
Skylar Mays is on the Hawks. That is news for me

Trash talking by noted star Skylar Mays

Skylar Mays? Sounds like a name from a Key &amp; Peele sketch.
Skylar Mays looks bout 40
SKYLAR MAYS oh lawd
Holy shit Skylar Mays!! Completely forgot he existed after he balled out at LSU. miss you champ &lt;3
Skylar Mays is nice. He cooked the Knicks in one of our games
Teague. Unless he actually knows who brandon goodwin and skylar mays are
"I want to see Skylar Mays get some game time, he had some decent games and still a rookie"
It‚Äôs all good skylar Mays got us
Not sure how demoralized they'd be if you beat up on Bruno Fernando and Skylar Mays
