"Im tired of people saying the Nets have no depth after the trade as if their own team has All Stars down to the 15th man. *Here's the Clippers top 9*  Kawhi/PG/Ibaka/Lou/Beverly/Kennard/Morris/Batum/Zubac   Very impressive top nine. Id say better than the Nets. Now here's the rest of their roster. Amir Coffey/Reggie Jackson/Kabengale/Terrance Man,/Daniel OToru/Patt Patterson/Jay Scrubb Im sorry if im the only one who doesn't think any of those guys are above Average NBA players. That looks like a pretty shite back of rotation.    *Now here's the Nets top 9* KD/Kyrie/Harden/Harris/Green/Deandre/Shamet/Bruce Brown/TLC  And the rest of the roster  Dinwddie/Tyler Johnson/Nic Claxton/Reggie Perry/3 open roster spots The Nets have the bi annual exception and a disabled player exception to use to fill those open spots. As i said imo the Clippers top 9 is better than the Nets top 9 even though its close. But the Clippers ""depth"" doesn't seem better than the Nets at all. And the Nets have money to improve their depth and all their 2nd round picks to trade."
"May be biased but the Clippers announcers are very underrated imo. Always call the games really well, have knowledge of the game and are unbiased. Also have the best Amir Coffey puns."

You‚Äôll love it when Amir Coffey plays then
Luke Kennard and Amir Coffey for Rubio
"""Only 50? What a bum.""     \-Amir Coffey"
Amir Coffey will challenge him for best hair on the court
"We‚Äôre asking the same question   Since Malik Monk, Amir Coffey and some guy named Daquan Jeffries popped off against us"
Put Amir Coffey in
Clippers need Amir Coffey in
"It's a joke bro, amir coffey was cooking from 3."
"""Whats your name""     ""Amir Coffey, like the drink, but spelled different, with a Y"""
Cause the defense was ass. When Duncans on the floor its oretty much 4 on 5. And Marcus Morris and Amir Coffey shot more 3s then your entire team combined.
Amir ‚ÄúAl-Starbuck$‚Äù Coffey
Amir Coffey
and Amir Coffey
I‚Äôm shocked by the Heat. Really thought a healthy squad would be able to handle his Clips team by 7-10 pts. Then Amir Coffey happened.
Are the Heat really gonna lose to Marcus Morris and Amir Coffey?
Amir Coffey is like 4/4 for 3 and Marcus Morris is 6/7 from 3
Amir Coffey wtf
Amir coffey
Amir Coffey
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt get when people say 2nd round picks are useless in trades lol (heard that a lot when talking about clippers making trades). If your team is good at developing young talent those picks can be very valuable. Luckily we picked up Kenny Atkinson and Billups this summer and it‚Äôs done wonders for the young guys on the team. Terance Mann and Amir Coffey are much better players compared to last year. Those two would get big minutes on younger teams
Amir Coffey
"Kris Humphries was the only top 20 prospect from Minnesota for a looong time.  But since 2014, we've got:  2014 - Tyus Jones  2018 - Tre Jones  2019 - Matthew Hurt (turns out he sucks though)  2020 - Jalen Suggs  2021 - Chet Holmgren  2023 - Tasion Chatman  Then throw in some others who didn't quite crack the top 20 - Gary Trent Jr, Amir Coffey and Daniel Oturu (both on the Clippers), Zeke Nnaji (Nuggets) and Tyrell Terry all in that same time frame .    MN hoops is up and coming"
"I keep expecting someone to say ""Adebayo takes it Adebounds-o"" but that would probably require the shameless Clippers announcer who makes Amir Coffey puns."
It‚Äôll be tough for you guys to win without... *checks notes* Amir Coffey.
"Amir Coffey is starting.  I like watching the guy, he's decent. But in all the injury-plagued games this year, we've never once started Amir Coffey. This is new."
I hope Amir Coffey is ready for this
Wow Amir Coffey is in üòç
"Yeah to be fair that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs played six total minutes in three losses these playoffs.   He‚Äôs played the 223rd least minutes per game out of 230 players, beating out only Keljin Blevins, Tolliver, Amir Coffey, Rayjon Tucker, Yogi Ferrell, Frank Ntilikina, and Tacko Fall. That can kind of mess with the usage percentage - Rayjon Tucker is 8th for example"
#Amir Coffey
"Then if you look at how the seeding was, you realize it had nothing to do with seeding and everything to do with resting the last two games of the season. They played their guys against the toughest teams in the last week, they tested on a B2B same as they had all season ( they literally started Amir Coffey at one point), and by the OKC game seeding was a toss-up between Portland and Dallas (with part of that out of their hands since both were playing) so it didn't matter."
"Amir Coffey, unless we sign him to a full contract (do it, cowards!!)"
Clippers should trade Luke Kennard and Amir Coffey to New Orleans for Steven Adams. Win-win trade.
Bet we get Amir Coffey minutes today
You mean Amir Coffey
Amir Coffey
"Yeah I'd ride or die with the small ball lineup if I was the Clippers. I'd even play Amir Coffey over Zubac and Cousins if you have to. Only play Zubac when Booker isn't on the floor, because if CP3 comes back Zubac might not be able to play at all later in the series."
"I thought about it, but wanted to keep the table in the OP a little cleaner.

For sure those not aware this puts the Clippers roster at 15 already and that‚Äôs with them having no 3rd string bigs as well as not signing Amir Coffey. It‚Äôs very fair to assume a trade by the Clippers is coming. Probably a mixture of Rondo + Pat + Luke
Maybe they ought to trade for  Nicolas Batum  Patrick Beverley  Amir Coffey  DeMarcus Cousins  Yogi Ferrell  Paul George  Serge Ibaka  Reggie Jackson  Keon Johnson  Luke Kennard  Kawhi Leonard  Terance Mann  Marcus Morris Sr.  Daniel Oturu  Patrick Patterson  Jason Preston  Rajon Rondo  Jay Scrubb  Ivica Zubac
"If they don‚Äôt bring them back, then they have zero chance of bringing back:  Nicolas Batum  Patrick Beverley  Amir Coffey  DeMarcus Cousins  Yogi Ferrell  Paul George  Serge Ibaka  Reggie Jackson  Keon Johnson  Luke Kennard  Kawhi Leonard  Terance Mann  Marcus Morris Sr.  Daniel Oturu  Patrick Patterson  Jason Preston  Rajon Rondo  Jay Scrubb  Ivica Zubac"

"Yet to be determined if he'll be a Clipper this season, but Amir Coffey has been on the cusp of an nba roster for 2 years now. When he's hot, there's nothing better to warm the bench than a cup o' Coffey."
Amir Coffey for Ben Simmons ü§ù
"Cam Reddish, Alperen Sengun, Amir Coffey and Caleb Martin are getting to the line more frequently per game. Damn."
"I'm sure there are worse players than Amir Coffey, but Clippers fans are having trouble understanding how he keeps getting minutes given what a stacked team it is."
Y‚Äôall MVP struggling to beat amir coffey lol
Ty Lue playing Amir Coffey this long is some 3D shit I wasn‚Äôt expecting on our season opener. Love it
Amir Coffey is playing? Ty Lue using this game for conditioning lol
Amir Coffey***
Amir Coffey (hopkins)
"Minnesota is so starved for any sort of sporting success that we‚Äôll cheer for just about anything. But also HS Basketball is huge in Minnesota, Gary Trent Jr, Paige Bueckers, Jalen Suggs, Chet Holmgren, Tyus and Tre Jones, even Amir Coffey and JP Macura. MN HS hoops is just exciting to watch."
"When Amir Coffey is in the game, the coffee puns just keep coming."
In reference to Amir Coffey. As a dad joke and pun enthusiast I approve.
Find someone who loves you the way clips commentators love Amir Coffey
Amir Coffey
Amir Coffey out here with a +21 on 25 minutes
Grizzlies players and fans talking shit beating a team starting Amir Coffey
Amir Coffey and the Clippers announcer have now both requested trades to Miami.
I could cook Amir Coffey.. not impressive
