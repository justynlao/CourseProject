"A player you guys are gonna want to keep your eye on is daishen nix, don’t have to believe me but I played with the guy and he’s the best passer and most mature 18 year old I’ve ever been around. The prep team he played on in highschool the coach is like an abusive drill sergeant, most players can’t last there because he runs his program like a military academy. Daishen played there with him for like 3 years I believe, where ever he goes he’s going to be good"

"Alperen Sengun is a probable lotto pick no one has heard of, but he could a beast in this league. Usman Garuba could go in the lotto too, and he’s been amazing in Spain.    Daishen Nix, Jared Butler, Scottie Barnes and Chris Duarte will be the steals of this draft. But it’s filled with talent from top to bottom."

"Lmao you're not wrong Daishen Nix, Miles McBride Nah'Shon Hyland, Quentin Grimes and Mckingley Wright IV are all apparently real people."
"Jalen Green, Kuminga, Emoni bates decommitted to potentially go pro, LaMelo, Daishen Nix, RJ Hampton, Anfernee Simons, Darius Bazley"
What about Isaiah Todd who didn't go until the second round and Daishen Nix that was a 5\* recruit that wasn't drafted?  Reclassifying happens all the time. Kuminga was the No. 4 recruit last year. Why do you think him going 7 was only because of G-League and he wouldn't have gone that high if he also went to college?
Tell me about Daishen Nix then? Once considered one of the top if not the best PG in the 2020 class who went to the Ignite and ended up not being drafted.
Who the hell is Daishen Nix??
"Most people are low on Daishen Nix. Man, I love the guy. I like passers. Wish someone took a chance on him, and I was really hoping the Bucks would get him, would be a nice backup playmaker off the bench.  On the other hand, I’m not sold on Jalen Green. Might be reaaaaally unpopular, but in a few years time I could definitely see him adopt a Jabari Parker mentality of “they don’t pay me to play defense.” He’s a score first guy and… well, let’s just hope for the best lol."
didn’t we get daishen nix too
Is he any good? Wanted daishen Nix
"Man, lowkey I’m disappointed. We could’ve had Daishen Nix (I’m unreasonably high on this guy, I think he’s a fantastic playmaker off the bench plus he’s got size and I bet we can make him buy into our defensive schemes) or Joel Ayayi but we drafted a Greek guy who I’ve never heard of before this Draft. Still, I have faith in our development team: if they can develop Nwora and Diakite to serviceable bench pieces, our rookies now might be good in 2-3 years."
"I was gonna say Quentin Grimes, JT Thor, and Bones Hyland  Cool names 👌  Daishen Nix sounds like an RNB artist from the early 2000s lol"
"Daishen Nix, Matthew Hurt, and Vrenz Notevengonnatryit"
Aaron henry and daishen nix not getting picked was surprising to me oh and also ayayi
Also realized Daishen Nix wasn’t drafted
"I'd take any player picked over him, so far. And there are more I'd still take, such as Boston Jr or David Johnson, Daishen Nix, etc"
"Daishen Nix will prove all the doubters, y’all ain’t ready for him to have a reliable jumpshot + decent defense on top of his stocky build + pass first mentality. He’s gonna be really really good."
"Doubt Daishen Nix makes our final roster, rather have him"
"From what we've seen, the Ignite is pretty horrible for your draft stock unless you are one of the top top guys, and even then not great.   You play against grown men, on an NBA court (so the 3pt line is further) - your stats are gonna be significantly worse than they would be in college. Your defence will look worse because you are playing significantly better competition, and there are no zone defences or big men camping in the paint behind you like in college.  The system they played was basically 'my turn your turn' iso between Green and Kuminga, and while it didn't really matter for Green because his game is built around that, it kind of highlighted Kuminga's weaknesses, which wouldn't have been the case in college.  I think Kuminga would have been looked upon much more favourably against college competition, where his physical advantages would have been much more apparent.  Also keep in mind Kuminga was one of the *featured* players, and Bronny wouldn't be a featured player on the Ignite. The other guys on the roster basically got ignored and their draft stock plummeted from before the season. Rank 15 Isaiah Todd went 31st, and rank 21 Daishen Nix went undrafted - maybe the same would have happened in college, but they would have had a lot more opportunity to show what they could do."
&gt; Daishen Nix  That's a name right there.  Stayed up all night for this one
Tyler Bey was the 36th pick in the 2020 draft and didn't get much playing time.  Daishen Nix played on the Ignite last year.
Oh theres a name I forget about.   Emmanuel Mudiay is another.   Brandon Jennings was definitely prepared as a young rook but it certainly didnt help his career.   Daishen Nix would have definitely went higher on draft night having played for UCLA last year.   Kai Sotto is probs the next name on the list
I think Daishen Nix would have had a better chance of getting drafted if he stuck with his commitment to UCLA.
"**TLDR**: Shockingly enough the rebuilding Rox don't have an open spot for him b/c there are too many promising young guys, and entrenched starters + rotation players.  I know we're rebuilding and it feels like we should have an open sport for him, but we legitimately don't unless he wants to sign a 2-way(Bey and Lamb are the current ones but can be cut).  We're already down to 14 playable roster spots instead of 15 b/c of John Wall effectively being an assistant coach the entire year barring a miracle buyout or trade.   Plus we drafted 4 rookies in the 1st rd, 1 who's a guaranteed starter(Green), 1 who earned himself rotation minutes(Sengun) and 2 who look promising but are gonna be in RGV a lot(Christopher and Garuba). That leaves 10 roster spots to work with.  9 of those 10 roster spots are starters/rotation players on gtd contracts who aren't fighting for a roster spot: Gordon, CWood, Theis, Augustin, Nwaba, DHouse, KPJ, KMJ, and Tate.   Then we got 3 guys battling in training camp for the 14th spot: Exum who's on the weird incentive based contract built for trades, fan favorite sharpshooter Armoni Brooks who's on an Exhibit 10 but is prolly getting a 2 way spot, and Daishen Nix on an Exhibit 10 as well.  Including the two 2-way guys, that's 19 out of the 20 guys we had on our training camp roster since we cut Khyri Thomas, who was on a non-gtd contract, to do the Sekou trade.   In the grand scheme Sekou doesn't fit in that mix which is why he got waived. In spite of Sekou's theoretical potential, I just don't see a world where he makes the final 14 man roster over Exum w/his tradeable contract, or Armoni Brooks w/his elite shooting."
Daishen Nix
Yeah Daishen Nix was the other Ignite guy
"Lmfao out of all of Lebron actual skill sets u bring up the worst arguments.  Arguably better scorer? All Lebron does is put his shoulder down, drives to the basket, travels, and lays it up. His “playmaking” comes from kicking it to 3 point shooters when the defense collapses. LMAO. Go watch some kobe scoring highlights you must be new. And how can Lebron have a better playoff performances? He choked in 2011 w 8 ppg in the finals and literally got bailed out by Ray Allen and Kyrie. Furthermore, Lebron is a LAZY ASS defender he doesn’t try at all and walks back on defense like it’s 24 hr fitness. Kobe is 12x all defense. Lebron is 6x. 😂😂😂 And I’m surprised you didn’t even bring up his passing which he is def better than at. Although the bane of his existence comes from passing it in clutch moments when his teammates let him down!!   And to counter your negatives listed about Isaiah. He makes up for it cause he is simply a good basketball player! He scored 29ppg and top 5 in MVP like 3 years ago. Even if he is 75% of what he was he still is better than a lot of nobodies in the league. Like on the rockets who tf is daishen nix and Harrison Mathew. Put Isaiah in he’ll win you a couple games for sure.  Please respond back w some better arguments please. 👍 If not then it ain’t worth the discusion"
"Houston should probably be...  Lock in: Jalen Green, KPJ, Jaesean Tate, Sengun, Garuba, Josh Christopher, KJ Martin, Armoni Brooks  Move on: Wall, Eric Gordon, Danuel House, Nwaba  Uncertain: Wood, Theis, Augustin, Garrison Matthews, Daishen Nix  Only trade Wood if we get a can't miss offer that helps the rebuild. Theis and Augustin are good bench players for this year, but they are not a part of our long term plans so they're under ""Uncertain"". Nwaba could be under ""Uncertain"" too, but he's pretty average and his skills overlap heavily with Tate and KJ Martin. I'd rather just move on from him and give minutes to the younger guys."
