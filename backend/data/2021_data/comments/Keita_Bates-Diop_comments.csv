Keita Bates-Diop?
"Keita Bates-Diop, without question."
"We're missing Keldon Johnson, Derrick White, Rudy Gay, and Devin Vassell. We've been having to play Trey Lyles, Luka Samanic, and Keita Bates-Diop significant minutes and they normally don't play."
"You mean the season he had 59 game of jimmy butler or the one where he had 10?  Yeah the 2018-19 season he had a cool 48 games with roco that was fun. Jared bayless started a few games for us back then because Rose and tyus was hurt. Keita bates diop and Cam Reynalds also played a shit ton of rotational minutes for us. All this time Andrew Wiggins was his co star, the warriors are 16-15 with Wiggins as curry’s co star and way better roster talent than what ever Kat has had"
Keita bates diop 50 bomb incoming
"if their was more time left we wouldn’t be playing Keita Bates-Diop, Quinndary Weatherspoon, Trey Lyles, Lonnie Walker, and Drew Eubanks if they had a real chance to comeback lol"
He's not Keita Bates Diop
Keita Bates-Diop
Keita bates diop imo
I actually went and looked if either team had Keita Bates-Diop on their team.
"We do have Keita ""we really need to come up with a nickname for you"" Bates Diop, but he can't win with this cats"
Hyphenated last names are the new market inequality.  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Talen Horton-Tucker  Keita Bates-Diop  Nickeil Alexander-Walker  Wardell Stephen James-Curry
"I dont think they should trade Clarkson, as he proved to be basically their entire bench production several times.  However, the Jazz are pretty much tied up cap-wise. I'd say, chase long 3&amp;D wings: Keita Bates Diop and Torrey Craig types. Otto Porter would be nice but hes injured too much and will still be expensive I think."
"&gt;He was lethargic, lacked drive, made idiotic plays and was generally just a negative any time he was on the court.   So how was he better than MPJ?   &gt;Yet he managed to turn it around with the warriors, posting season high in fg% and 3PT% while playing great defense. He played smarter then he ever has, it’s not a coincidence that this is happening because of a change of team, it’s also a change of management and leadership.  He has better looks due to playing with Curry and has Draymond to guide him on defence other than that little has changed with Wiggins. Watching him brick that shot to advance into the playoffs was proof enough.  &gt;KAT lacks what it takes to be the 1st option on a winning team, the only time he was apart of one was when Butler came in as the head honcho.  Yeah man him not being able to win with Jordan Bell and Treveon Graham and Keita Bates Diop is proof that he lacks what it takes!"
"I dont think he is the biggest bust. I just dont agree with your point that being drafted by Timberwolves can affect the development. Especially during last 2 years, we did not really compete so we played a lot of young players on different positions and gave them a lot of chances. Naz Reid, McLaughlin (forgot about him btw), Keita Bates Diop, Kelan Martin came from G-League during Culver’s first season and all of them were better than him. Vanderbilt was in G League last year but finished the season as starter. I agree, sometime for a player is better to be a part of competitive team to develop. But do think that lack of playing time is more beneficial for players like Toppin or Smith (from Phoenix)?   EVERYONE from the players I mentioned has shown progress. Culver is still the same player he was out of college, but with confidence issues. Culver was given time on the court ONLY because he was 6th overall pick, and he played himself out of rotation.  Edit: McDaniels is a good example. Do you think had he stayed in Lakers he would have been better? Im pretty sure he is very happy to be in Timberwolves because he was actually given chances and used them very well, now he is a big part of the core and people dont want to trade him for Simmons."
"Dejounte Murray, Devin Vassell, Doug McDermott, Keldon Johnson, Jakob Poeltl.   Derrick White, Josh Primo, Lonnie Walker, Thad Young, Zach Collins.  Tre Jones, Da'Quan Jeffries, Keita Bates-Diop, Luka Samanic, Jock Landale"
Keita Bates-Diop means nothing to you huh?
Hyphenated last names are the new market inequality.  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Talen Horton-Tucker  Keita Bates-Diop  Nickeil Alexander-Walker  Wardell Stephen James-Curry
Keita Bates Diop is nowhere near a big enough name to have his initials as an acronym
keita bates diop by the spurs season
What really sucked was Keita Bates-Diop had an easy putback on Dejounte's missed game winner but Jakob tipped it out of his hands
"Keita Bates Diop was going to be the next KD, he can’t even be the next benchwarmer"
"BULLSHIT. Hindsight is everything. If you believe that shit I got a fucking bridge in Brooklyn you can buy from me.    Look at the guys he drafted: Kris Dunn, Josh Okogie, Keita Bates Diop, Josh Patton, the dude when given full control doesnt know shit."
i don't know man. i actually rated him highly because he have shown flashes when he was playing last season and we need a modern forward but he's getting out played by keita bates diop and fucking aminu out of all people. for a third year 19th pick that's not good enough.
Keita Bates-Diop reminds me of a worse version of Bagley
Sometimes I forgot we’re tanking but then I see Keita Bates-Diop starting and remember to trust the process
Keita Bates Diop
Are you telling me you think Keita Bates-Diop is the third best clutch player in the league?
Bruh I think we got a Keita bates diop and jock landale for free. I’d take both over bazemore.
"&gt;  jaden mcdaniels looks like the steal of the 2020 draft and was the best defensive rookie in the league as the 28th pick.  IQ was picked 3 picks before him and hes been better  desmond bane was picked 2 picks after him and outplayed him last night   &gt;naz reid was undrafted and has become one of the most underrated backup centres in the league, and he’s one of the best 3pt shooting centres too.  actually agree with all of this will always endorse naz reid would love to have him on the hornets  &gt;okogie at 20 wasnt a world beater but getting a solid rotation player there is still a win.   he's not a rotation player? more of a sporadic player, on one of the worst teams in the league. not to mention offensively non existent?  &gt;he traded roco, keita bates diop, and some scrubs (vonleh, napier, bell) for malik beasley, jarred vanderbilt, and a first round pick.   roco is the best piece in this trade if the goal is to win basketball games  &gt;youre judging a GM on win percentage? thats straight up idiotic. i guess neil olshey is a better GM than sam presti, or kleiman in memphis, or rosas just because he won more games? fuck no.  you act as if all gm situation are created equal and all of those guys traded away a first round pick the next year basically saying ""we are competing"" then won 23 games, thats remarkable incompetence  and his encore roster looks like it might win 20-25 again  and last i checked the objective was to win games and his tenure not only put the wolves nowhere near doing that, it put them farther away   that is why it is fair to judge him on win percentage when not only did he sabotage their future he managed to sabotage their present as well"
"yes youre missing everything good he did lmfao. jaden mcdaniels looks like the steal of the 2020 draft and was the best defensive rookie in the league as the 28th pick. naz reid was undrafted and has become one of the most underrated backup centres in the league, and he’s one of the best 3pt shooting centres too. okogie at 20 wasnt a world beater but getting a solid rotation player there is still a win. he traded roco, keita bates diop, and some scrubs (vonleh, napier, bell) for malik beasley, jarred vanderbilt, and a first round pick. he overpaid juancho a little bit (but $7 mil a year is certainly not horrible), but then flipped him and culver for beverly, which significantly improves guard depth, experience, and defence to replace rubio while giving up two players who barely belong in the league and no picks.   rubio trade was bad, yes. dlo in minnesota is significantly better than wiggins was in minnesota, and theres a very good chance kat wouldve already demanded a trade if dlo wasnt there. it was worth it just for keeping kat happy if nothing else.   youre judging a GM on win percentage? thats straight up idiotic. i guess neil olshey is a better GM than sam presti, or kleiman in memphis, or rosas just because he won more games? fuck no. the wolves just have had horrible injury luck the last two years, that’s no fault of the GMs and its really stupid to judge him on that."
"I would move Lonnie and Zach Collins to Uncertain and Keita Bates-Diop to lock in. Bates-Diop is under contract next year for 1.5M so no reason to move on from him when he's shown flashes of being a decent contributor. If Lonnie doesn't show significant improvement and gets a decent offer, there's a very real chance we let him walk next offseason. If Collins looks like he won't recover from his injuries well, we probably waive him since his contract is barely guaranteed after this season."
