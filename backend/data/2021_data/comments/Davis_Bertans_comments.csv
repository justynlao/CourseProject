Davis fucking Bertans and Scott fucking Brooks. That’s all I gotta say
DAVIS BERTANS IS THE SINGLE WORST DEFENSIVE PLAYER I HAVE EVER SEEN. WHY IS HE GETTING TEN FOURTH QUARTER MINUTES?
Why would Pistons fans make excuses for Davis Bertans?
"&gt; Washington lost 50 games a couple of years ago, then played to a 54-loss pace during the shortened 2019-20 season. It’s lacking immediate financial flexibility with Beal due $34 million next season, Westbrook under contract for $91 million total over the next two years and Davis Bertans in year 1 of a five-year, $80 million contract. But neither Beal nor the Wizards is at the point of a breakup as of now.   i admire beal for apparently wanting to stay, but this section shows why washington should really be shopping him rn or in the offseason. they're locked into this salary structure for the next few years, beal's playing likely the best he's ever going to, this is probably the best westbrook year they're getting in this contract, and ...they might have an outside shot at the play-in. in the east. i get that it's painful and that rebuilds suck, but if there was ever a team that needs to bit the bullet and chase the ping pong balls, it's this one."
That ended up being Davis Bertans

" Ben is a elite defender and playmaker. Even if his offense hasn't taken a significant jump, he's still good enough to be 3rd team all nba. I could also see a guy like Davis bertans working really well with Ben."
Mykhailiuk is like the white Davis Bertans. Man does not miss a 3 against the Sixers.
"$55 if the market is tight and the Heat can convince him to stay for cheap. IMO it’s likely closer to 70, but a bigger number wouldn’t surprise me.  Also, I think Bertans and Harris got paid that much because there were very few big free agents last offseason. Gordon Hayward got $120 million. Not a single All-NBA or All-Star hit free agency (Ingram was RFA and Davis was a guaranteed re-sign). There was a ton of money to throw around."

"Davis Bertans wasn't used properly (let him shoot everything), when he was on the Spurs   On the Wizards, he lets it fly  I'm saying that Duncan Robinson would only do what he is doing on a select few teams.   I'm not saying what Joe Harris would do in a Duncan R. role.   If you need a special situation for the best of you, i downgrade you.  Like Westbrook with Houston w/o a true center. That spacing doesn't exist on an average team, so i downgraded westbrook's season"
Like the Latvian Laser Davis Bertans.
"Fun fact about him, he was a teammate of Bogdan Bogdanovic and Davis Bertans in 2011."

Gotta love how I drafted Bradly Beal and Davis Bertans in fantasy and now I'm stuck with this shit.
Toppin needs to get post touches and get used as a roll man. Him being used as an athletic Davis Bertans is a waste of his skill set.

"I've been saying since last year that the Nuggets need to shake it up to really contend, and we're all seeing their deep seated issues so far this season. I think Washington needs a shake up too, they have good players but they just don't fit together well. I came up with this trade, which works on the trade machine:  Denver gets:   * Davis Bertans  * Bradley Beal  Wizards get:   * Jamal Murray  * Paul Millsap  * Bol Bol  * RJ Hampton  * 3 1sts (2021, 2024, 2026)  * 2 pick swaps (2022, 2025)  Denver runs Beal/Harris/MPJ/Bertans/Jokic, great spacing for Jokic to work with, and Beal adds consistent star power, which Denver needs to pair with Jokic, he's not enough by himself. Second unit of Morris/Campazzo/Barton/Green/Hartenstein  The Wiz get a very promising young PG in Murray, two talented projects in Bol and Hampton, Millsap is expiring financial filler who provides a veteran presence for a year, and several picks/swaps to help the rebuild."
"Watching their games this year has been fascinating and infuriating   Entirely too much Jerome Robinson and Raul Neto (although Neto has been good). Especially when Brooks plays them next to Russ. Zero spacing.   Davis Bertans has basically been this team’s 8th option when everyone is healthy. I don’t think the front office signed him to that deal for him to be cast aside.   Troy Brown has disappeared, along with Isaac Bonga."
What do you mean by one dimensional?  Do you mean a good defensive player but limited offensive player like Gobert?  Do you mean a good offensive player but limited defensive player like Kevin Love?  Do you mean a good shooter but cant attack off the dribble like Davis Bertans?  Do you mean a good slasher/finisher but can’t shoot like Giannis?
Pick him up over bertans? Last year Davis was a beast so I don’t wanna give up just yet
"Steph's peak is also much higher than Magic's peak. I don't actually care if the ball left Steph's hands as an assist, his gravity as a shooter and off-ball mover creates offense whether he touches it or not. Steph spent five years as the best player on the best five year run since the Russell Celtics--did he have help? Sure. But Klay Thompson has had a whole ass career as an all-star because he's getting to play with Steph. He's slightly better Davis Bertans who gets a bazillion open looks because teams have to show for a PnR at the logo when Steph is on the court."
So are Gerald Green and Davis Bertans
"When you take over 80% of your shots from three there are gonna be some stretches when you struggle to make a third of your shots.  I have no problem with Bertans launching, I don't see a lot of spacing on that team even with Davis shooting like a 90's grunge singer."

Trae Young  Bradley Beal  DeMar DeRozan  Davis Bertans  Karl Anthony Towns
"I'm not saying it's impossible, but 41+% on 8.5 shots a game is like Duncan Robinson/Buddy Hield/Davis Bertans level shooting. It would be one of the most impressive shooting leaps ever (Terry wasn't considered a shooter coming out of college) and Rozier isn't exactly that young (he's almost 27).    Again I wouldn't rule it out, but I would reasonably expect some level of shooting regression. I still think he's going to be a high level NBA 3 point shooter. The difference between 39% and 41% is going to be like 6 makes so it's probably not worth splitting that many hairs about it."
He got paid 3 year 58 millions. That's not that big. Davis Bertans got paid more than that.

There is no reason whatsoever for Westbrook to be taking jumpers instead of Davis Bertans lmao but keep doin it Brodie
"John Stockton, Manu Ginobili, Davis Bertans, Tim Duncan, Hakeem Olajuwon.  Interior oriented offense with great passing from the guard spots. Davis provides outside shooting. Defense is sketchy aside from the interior, so they'd probably try to funnel the opposing team to the interior so that Timmy and Hakeem can deal with them."
Davis Bertans
"Maybe not picking up a ball is misstating it but here's what he said:   &gt; ""I didn't play basketball for seven months. Now I kind of have to ease back into it playing against the top-level players in the world,"" Bertans said. ""It's definitely not easy, but that's something I've gotta do. That's what I'm here to do. Eventually, I will get there.""  https://sports.yahoo.com/davis-bertans-unlikely-play-vs-211402859.html"

"The majority of basketball fans think Davis is worse on defense than he is. It doesn’t help he’s on one of the worst defensive rosters in the league and his former team’s fans are also a majority of people thinking he’s worse on defense than he is. A lot of people actually think he’s in discussion for one of the worst defensive players in the league.  Spurs fans already overestimated how bad his defense was prior to the 2019 playoffs, but   * his weaknesses on defense being exacerbated in the 2019 Nuggets series  * implicit bias of Spurs fans wanting to think his weaknesses were even worse than they were since they incidentally gave him away to the Wizards for free  combine to form the narrative he’s worse on defense than he is. It’s a natural stage of coping for people to subconsciously re-assure themselves Bertans is worse than he is since he’s no longer on the team and they gave him away for nothing. It isn’t really fair to expect the rest of the league’s fans to then know how good or bad Bertans is on defense when almost all of them don’t watch a lot of Spurs or Wizards game and they’re just going to follow along with what they hear fans of his own team saying, so when a Spurs fans says he was unplayable in the Nuggets series because of his defense every other teams’ fans will follow along with that. It happens with tons of players and teams beyond just our own. It’s a natural part of this subreddit where everyone is one of the biggest NBA fans they know in real life so they overestimate their ability to keep up with the rest of the league’s teams and players beyond their own and talk too much about players or teams they probably watch less than 10 complete games of a season. Maybe not even 5 whole games rather than just highlights of 20-60 games thinking that comes close to bridging any disconnect of not watching complete games.  Everyone’s guilty of it to different extents. I still debate with people on Kobe or Dirk even though I didn’t watch 78+ complete regular season games each year of their prime as I do the Spurs. I’m guilty of it even though I think less so than most. We all think we do it less so than most though.  It’s worth mentioning Bertans was in a prolonged shooting slump after the all star break in 2019 and his preferred coverage of switching pick and roll wasn’t employable for the whole Spurs roster against Murray/Jokic P&amp;R and the Nuggets 4 spot was filled with Millsap and Plumlee who both had their way with Davis in the paint. It was an especially bad matchup with him unable to defend or keep either large player off the glass, not wanting to switch, and Davis in the midst of a huge slump at his overriding strength shooting. It’s not like we benched Bertans that series for a nobody or for no other alternative. Poeltl/Aldridge minutes did help defend Jokic and Rudy was certainly a better defensive matchup against Plumlee or Millsap. All that said it’s a perfectly reasonable stance to say Bertans is overpaid or for me to say I am glad the Spurs don’t have him on that contact but he isn’t near the worst defenders in the league. Most Spurs fans still think Tim Duncan was robbed of a quadruple double; fighting back against an already established narrative is pretty much impossible without a massive amount of evidence otherwise. Davis needs to do a lot to wipe off the label already put on him which is exceedingly difficult when the only other team who’s had him (Spurs) mostly all think he’s a horrible defender and are subconsciously biased towards thinking so since they gave him away for Morris who never signed with them."
Fine  u/celtics get:  Bradley Beal  Davis Bertans  Moritz Wagner  u/WashWizards get:  Kemba Walker  Tristan Thompson  Javonte Green  2021 - RD 1  2021 - RD 2  2021 - RD 2  https://tradenba.com/trades/qr\_UOhwtQ
I've never heard anyone being called rural (though if we're going there Davis Bertans looks like an amish kid on rumspringa)
"I've posted this in other threads but my fantasy woes continue....  Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, Malik Beasley, Deandre Hunter, Mitchell Robinson along with random absences like Bertans, Herro, and Hayward."
Carmelo Anthony Davis Bertans would like a word
Not as good as Marquese Chris Paul George Karl Anthony Davis Bertans
"He's able to stand and take a shot now, so it's just a matter of finding him in the corner then playing 4 on 5.  A real Davis Bertans type."
He could shoot the absolute hell out of the ball. I think he could have gotten Davis Bertans money in the modern nba.
He would be Davis Bertans probably
Davis Bertans: Nuke Solo Mid
Man davis bertans is washed rn
"""I gave him an ocular patdown, and didn't clear him for entry into the key.""   -Davis ""Mac"" Bertans"
only davis in this game gonna be bertans
"Davis Bertans ALWAYS jumps to contest and I respect the hell out of that. As a Spurs fan, I was so tired of seeing him get jammed on throughout the seasons, but he never stopped contesting.  Same with Aron Baynes!"
"2011 had Isaiah Thomas, Bojan Bogdanovic, Davis Bertans, Chandler Parsons (who was good once upon a time) and E'twaun Moore.  2003 had Jason Kapono, Kyle Korver, Luke Walton, Willie Green, Zaza Pachulia, James Jones, Mo Williams. and Keith Bogans. There's two All-Star selections and nine championships between them, in addition to long careers."
"I don’t know Davis Bertans percentages this season, but it sure as hell isn’t 50% from 3"
"Sleeping on my boy Davis Bertans, smh"
"ehem  Davis Bertans is also on Trae Young level, thankyouverymuch"
"want to talk about starting next to people who play no d.  Russ is an atrocious defender, Thomas Bryant when he played was even worse, Davis Bertans is maybe wirse that Isaiah"
fck u Davis Bertans
"Anderson’s first year in Huston was really good but you started to see him regressing that year.  bertans volume and efficiency his first year in Washington was historic, especially for a big man. I think if you saw bertans playing the four next to an star big and PG in Davis and Jrue, you’d see closer numbers to what Anderson put up."
Easily Davis Bertans
Davis Bertans going to a team where he could shoot tons helped him.
Davis Bertans really just 9/11'd on you lot from the 3pt line  &gt;  Nuggets.. Cooked
"Theoretically, if Davis Bertans was an only child, would his name be Davis Bertan?"
Davis Bertans and his brother Dairis Bertans. Dairis actually played a bit for New Orleans.
It’s actually 3. But it’s going to at least be at least 5 after Lebron has to face his kryptonite Davis Bertans.
Yeah I never wanna see Davis Bertans ever again.
Davis Bertans is a God
DAVIS BERTANS!
Davis Bertans is underpaid
Davis Bertans looks like if a parsnip came to life
Davis Bertans is a literal God
Davis Bertans
Davis Bertans
"&gt; we're taking the league's least 3 pointers at the lowest percentage.  For comparison, there are 12 players in the league who are attempting more 3s than your starting backcourt *combined* and 3 more players who are attempting the same number of 3s.  Sexland are collectively attempting 7.7 3s per game. That's the same number as Davis Bertans or Eric Gordon, who are both primarily bench players this season."
"Yeah the issue is when a team sits Drummond, the team is called “savvy” and “smart” but when a player sits while demanding a trade or to prevent injury (See: Davis Bertans prior to bubble) he is called toxic and a cancerous individual."
"Ah yes, Bertans Davis"
Davis Bertans has been one of the issues for the Wizards. Having a good game tonight.
"Davis Bertans 4/$80, shooting 34% from FG and 33% from 3 with horrible defense."
"I mean...[look at this] (https://imgur.com/a/D6aLclu)  I got it from [this site] (https://www.thehoopsgeek.com/average-nba-height/)  It's really not even close. Yes, I know there are exponentially more players in the NBA right now, but in that 1962 season when Wilt averaged 50 PPG, 25 RPG and somehow 48.5 minutes per game, there were only 2 other players over 6'10"" and they were Bill Russel and Walt Bellamy - all 3 of them HOF.   Imagine if we put every player over 6'10"" into the HOF in 2020...Davis Bertans for the Hall? Clint Capela? Wilt was a ridiculous, legendary basketball player but if you take him in his prime and put him in 2021, he's not averaging 50/25, or his career numbers of 30/23."
I've already accepted we lost this trade. Porzingis is just 7'3 davis bertans with an ego.
That bum that came in when we traded George Hill for Davis Bertans
"Shout out to Davis Bertans, who went from one of the most efficient scorers in the league to godawful efficiency in like 6 months."
I'm sorry Wizards fans. You don't deserve Scott Brooks and Davis Bertans
"Davis Bertans looks like he plays Magic the Gathering and says ""actually"" a lot"
"Davis Bertans just got $80 million from the Wizards for...reasons. Deals like that can’t happen with a lower cap. Superstars will get paid, leaving “minimum” salaries to fill the team. (Minimum is still millions of dollars a year, but my point still stands.)"
"Dude they’re garbage. They have a shit coach, Westbrick taking up like 1/3 of their cap space and they have no defense. Also Davis Bertans who they paid fat in the off-season regressed on his shooting a lot from last year.  Beal may not score 35 a night on a better team but he probably makes them win a hell of a lot more. Dude is loyal af tho"
I had people on the Celtics sub saying we should trade Gordon Hayward for him and honestly I’m glad we lost him to FA rather than get Davis Bertans lmao
It's time to be legitimately concerned about Davis Bertans
Thats a weird way to spell Davis Bertans
"I gave up watching Washington cause it's literally the saddest team in the league. I mean you have Beal who is literally leading the league in scoring on solid efficency and then you Westbrook who is once again doing his usual unicorn triple double business and the team still completely fucking sucks. Like how can you have two guys putting up HISTORICALLY GREAT levels of performance, Beal's scoring this year is as good as a year from prime Kobe, NO ONE cares though. It's so sad.   That and DC is in fucking no man's land in the saddest way. Like DC has some of the most promising young talents in the league. Deni is so good and gets used SO BADLY in DC. Rui has tons of potential but obviously he has to defer to the real stars of the team. Thomas Bryant is actually an offensive beast of a center but is injured rn.   For some reason they throw fucking Davis Bertans an $80 million contract like he's gonna be a piece for them to contend with. Like Bertans is a great shooter, he's no 3 and D guy though, he doesn't play defense well. Like for a proper 3 and D guy the money makes sense, for Bertans it's such a disgusting over pay.   You know what else made no sense? Trading Mo Wagner for Daniel Gafford. Like that trade says ""We're in rebuilding mode now"" Mo Wagner was actually really solid for DC defensively. At this point it really feels like a Beal trade is going to happen in the summer, like there's no way DC loads up on more developing talent while keeping the league leading scorer on the roster. Beal really does deserve better, DC doesn't deserve his loyalty. At least with Portland like Dame gets enough help to always keep Portland as a playoff team at worst and a dark horse at best. DC has literally none of that, there was hope that this year would be a playoff year for DC and that's completely failed.   DC needs to go all in and decide ""we're contending or rebuilding"". The franchise has been so sad since Wall signed that supermax only to get injured and it's completely ruined whatever potential there was. There might be an alternative universe where Wall never gets injured and DC continues to make noise in the East and stays comparable to the Celtic's with two great stars and a light chance of being a destination for FA's."
I call my guy Davis Bertans linguini
"Gary Trent, im pissed hes a Raptor now.     also Davis Bertans.   theres a bunch, i cant think rn"
"Do you have bigger sample of just those three?  Chris Paul, Davis Bertans and Shawn Marion had ""messed up"" hands but I know that because they are shown as good examples of messed up hands if you googling it. Maybe it's the same with Shaq, Lebron and Harden and vast majority players have perfectly fine feet?"
"Just for the record and all, those CotY and EotY awards were complete nonsense.  Bird took over a Pacer team that had won 50+ games repeatedly, but struggled to 39 for one season due to injury.  They then won 58 with the same roster, and Bird was given CotY apparently for keeping his players healthy -- no one without his reputation and name wins that.  The EotY was apparently for taking the 37-45 2010-11 Pacers and turning them into the 42-24 2011-12 Pacers.  I guess hiring Frank Vogel was smart, but other guys have done that, too, and Vogel is not exactly Phil Jackson.  He did draft Paul George at #10, but he was unremarkable until years later.  He also drafted Kawhi Leonard at #15, but traded him and Davis Bertans for George Hill -- which didn't look too terrible at the time, but is, ahem, highly questionable today.  [This](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/IND/2012_transactions.html), is Executive of the Year material?"
Davis Bertans
3rd leading scorer for the game: Davis Bertans
"Without looking at Google or the comments, can you name which player came from where?  #Wizards  * Rui Hachimura * Deni Avdija * Davis Bertans  * Robin Lopez * Raul Neto * Issac Bonga * Alex Len  #Mavs  * Luka Doncic * Tingus Pingus * Boban * Maxi Kleber * Willie Cauley-Stien * Dwight Powell * Nicolo Melli * Josh Green"
"Chose either one of those explication :  \- Russ is a stad padding demon sent to destroy teams  \- Thomas Bryant, Davis Bertans, Troy Brown and Ish Smith were their 2nd, 3rd, 4th and  th best players last year (or at least the 5 who had the more win shares I didn't watch). Bryant has been out all year, Bertans was out of shape to start the year, Troy Brown was out of the rotation all year and Ish is the worst possible fit next to Russ"
Davis Bertans bum ass
"1) Isaac Bonga (he is in the dog house)  2) Garrison Mathews  3) Jerome Robinson. Lol, he should be cut  4) Deni Avdija. Goofy looking European dandy who gets no respect from the refs and is oblivious to NBA foul drawing tricks as a rookie, and thus is much less effective than he should be    5) Raul Neto  6) Rui  ...  15) Davis Bertans"
What title you winning with Davis Bertans as your 4th best player
"Davis Bertans? No. We gave him a 5 year/60 million dollar deal and he deserves it, I think.   He's not playing well because he showed up late to the US because of visa issues, which made him miss training camp, so he had to begin the season with minimal training.   Then after Bertans was finally getting his legs back, the team gets a covid outbreak, and Bertans is forced to miss another few weeks.  Then again, it looks like Bertans is finally playing well. (Evidenced by the 9-11 3 point barrage against Denver in February). But then, he gets sidelined for 2-3 weeks thanks to a calf strain - and that's where we are now."
"Ah, okay. Similar story with Davis Bertans-- used to be vegan, but now is a dairy-free pescatarian"
I wanna say Davis Bertans every time they play the Wolves he turns into Kyle Korver drinking a Deadshot Daquiri
"Why wouldn't you put us in that group?  These are the best FAs our team has ever gotten:  1. Gilbert Arenas, who we were willing to overpay based on promise, he literally flipped a coin to decide where to sign, and he worked out. 2. Michael Jordan, who already was part owner of the team. 3. late 30s Paul Pierce, for just one season. 4. Davis Bertans on a re-sign overpay when he was already part of the team.  Basically - a literal coinflip, an inside track, an over the hill guy, and an overpay.  We're not an actual attractive location."
Thomas Bryant used to be able to do that before he got injured. Davis Bertans sometimes does that but is hampered by nagging leg injuries. It's unfortunate to see
"Sweet, now on my fantasy team the only guys I have hurt/not playing are: Embiid, Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, Malik Beasley, DeAndre Hunter, Mitchell Robinson and David Bertans."
I think you misspelled Davis Bertans.
So... Davis Bertans? Duncan Robinson?  20 mil/year
Davis Bertans... 5 years 80 mil
"I never thought it was an overpay. I mean, maybe a little bit, but nothing egregious. I think people are just inherently skeptical about playing non-star players their actual value. I think there's also just an aversion to paying someone in the $15-$20 million range. Like if you're not worth more you're not a star, and if you're not a star then in theory you can find a reasonable fascimile of your role for much cheaper. But there's no reasonable facsimile for Joe Harris, Duncan Robinson, or Davis Bertans. There are guys who can hit the 3, but these 3 are absolutely elite at what is quickly becoming the most important skill in the game."
He's not more valuable then Joe Harris or Davis Bertans and Pat Riley has to know that. He's gotta let Robinson walk if someone's throwing 20+ at him he literally just got out of bad contract purgatory like a year or 2 ago
"You’re looking at the wrong part of his game. What makes players like Bertans, Duncan, and Joe Harris so valuable isn’t that they’ll give you 20pts a night with lock down D.    What makes them valuable is their ability to perform the most sought after skill in the NBA at a level that only superstars reach.    It’s easy to look at Davis and think “He doesn’t score, rebound, or pass much. Why is he getting so much money?” Because he has a skill that very very few people in the league possess. The ability to be an offensive threat as soon as you cross mid court is an extremely valuable skill. That’s why teams are dishing out the dollars for guys that won’t even make all star games.    It opens the floor to an insane degree and let’s the star players perform at their peak."
It’s official. I’m taking Davis Bertans over Michael Jordan
"Outdated take from someone that doesn’t watch us play.    Bertans is undervalued (not in terms of pay, but in terms of how much the average person thinks he brings to the table for the Wiz). Without Davis, we have no 3 point threat (unless Garrison really develops). We are bottom 2 in 3pt attempts, makes, and overall shot frequency. Were 23rd in actual %. This is all despite him shooting 40% on 7 attempts (42% since the all star break).    Davis at least creates some gravity and has the *threat* of a 3PM on the court.   Our bread and butter is inside the arc. But if we have no reason to drag teams out to the 3pt line, they'll sag off their man in the help every time, making it harder for us to get what we want. Davis's gravity alone makes him a valuable player. Even when he isn't hitting shots, teams double him on screens and treat him like he just hit 5 in a row.   How many times did Russ hit Len for wide open layups/dunks against the lakers for that exact reason?   People look at his terrible start when he was clearly out of shape and think he’s still like that. In reality, the Wizards are:   8pts better with him on the floor, including scoring nearly 9 points per 100 possessions better. And this comes at the expense of admittedly mediocre defense, but defense that isn’t significantly worse than our starters (only about a 1 worse per 100 possessions).    Davis was getting that contract cause he had one of the best 3pt shooting seasons in the history of the NBA last year. Is he a little overpaid? Sure. But that’s because shooters like him (and Duncan Robinson) do not grow on trees. Offenses depend on guys like them."
I hope Davis Bertans makes several threes
my favorite player is john wall.  I play like davis bertans. 90% of my shots are deep 3's and I play lazy/bad defense.
"This is the answer. The Spurs lost a 7-foot shooter in Davis Bertans and need a replacement (for better or worse).  Edit: Bertans is 6'10"", you get my point."
"The team just wants the ball handler to have the ball for transition, so they have the other players box out so the transition starts with Luka, LeBron, harden, or Westbrook instead of Dwight Powell, Marc gasol, DeAndre Jordan, or Davis bertans  The uncontested rebounds are meaningless and don't add value, but getting the ball to your primary ballhandler as fast as possible does.  Some stans will argue though because they get hype about triple doubles and don't want to hear anything opposing their love of the big statline since it helps their player look better"
Daniel Gafford Davis Bertans  Raul Neto  All these guys are pretty important to why the Wizards are hot right now
"His contract is 3 years $40 million. Players who make around that: taurean prince, patty mills, Cody zeller, Davis Bertans, Rudy gay, justice Winslow, dion waiters. Kuzma has been big for us all year if you watch the games. And what are you on about we kept him over lonzo? There was no way we kept lonzo or BI in that deal."
*[Davis Bertans](https://s.hdnux.com/photos/56/65/55/12278612/3/ratio3x2_1200.jpg) has entered the game.*
"&gt; It's ESPN. Thats a very credible source when it comes to something like this.   Yeah, same “credible” source that once had CJ McCollum ranked 13th best player in the nba, Demar 20 spots behind Davis Bertans and 6 spots behind KCP coming into this year, Bam over Embiid and Lamelo over Tatum lmao"
"“Robinson is expected to earn a sizable pay raise this upcoming offseason when he’s set to become a restricted free agent. He’s on a $1.7 million salary this season, and comparable players such as Brooklyn Nets sharpshooter Joe Harris signed a four-year, $75 million contract and Washington Wizards three-point specialist Davis Bertans signed a five-year, $80 million as free agents last offseason.”"

I made a whole spreadsheet before realizing I forgot to take position into account.  Top 5 scoring teams are as follows if we're playing positionless and/or small-ball:  |*Team MB -  79.9 PPG*|*Team DB -  77.6 PPG*|*Team JH -  76.5 PPG*|*Team BB -  76.1 PPG*|*Team TH -  72.4 PPG* | |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Malcolm Brogdon - 21.2|Devin Booker - 25.4|James Harden - 25.2 |Bradley Beal - 31.3|Tobias Harris - 20| |Malik Beasley - 19.6|Dillon Brooks - 16.7|Jrue Holiday - 17.3 |Bojan Bogdanovic - 15.7|Tim Hardaway Jr. - 16| |Marvin Bagley III - 13.9|Darius Bazley - 13.4|Joe Harris - 14.5 |Bogdan Bogdanovic - 15.2|Tyler Herro - 14.9| |Mikal Bridges - 13.1|Davis Bertans - 11.4|Justin Holiday - 10.3 |Bruce Brown - 8.8|Tyrese Haliburton - 12.8| |Miles Bridges - 12.1|Dwayne Bacon - 10.7|Josh Hart - 9.2|Bismack Biyombo - 5.1|Talen Horton-Tucker - 8.7|
"&gt;Russ averaged 22 on 36% in the playoffs against Dame, while Dame had 33 on 46%  Yeah but Russ also averaged 9 rebounds and 11 assists. Him being able to get his teammates involved is why he didn't get swept, unlike Dame against the freaking Pelicans.  &gt;Or the fact that Dame ts% is 60 this season while Russ is 50%  Westbrook is shooting 43.7% on FGs this year, Lillard is shooting 43.3%. You're just cherrypicking true shooting because it favors players who jack up a bunch of 3s.  &gt;Dame 20-11 in clutch games, Russ 14-14.  Well Westbrook has to play with Raul Neto, Alex Len, and Davis Bertans as role players. Lillard gets Powell, Covington, and Nurkic as role players so obviously he's gonna have a better record."
Anthony Davis Bertans
"i meam not if you put him at the 4, right? He can't be worse than Davis Bertans and Rui is still pretty raw, so...Kev can't be bad."
"These refs are trash, but don’t let that distract you from the fact that Scott Brooks thought it would be a good idea to play DAVIS FUCKING BERTANS at the 5 for multiple key defensive possession"
Davis “little finger” Bertans
I hope Davis Bertans is a redditor!!
Fellow unbiased opinion  MVP - Bradley Beal  DPOY - What’s defense  6MOTY - Davis Bertans  MIP - Daniel Gafford  COTY - Russel Westbrook  ROTY - Anthony Gill maybe Deni Avdija
"\5. The little bumps and jabs of Robin Lopez Break up the Wiz! Washington has won eight of nine to pull ahead of the Chicago Bulls and Toronto Raptors in the slap-fight for the last Eastern Conference play-in spot. Chicago and Toronto own head-to-head tiebreakers over Washington, but the Wiz have one of the league's easiest remaining schedules. They also have two games left against the wobbling Indiana Pacers, now just two games ahead at No. 9. (Washington is 1-0 against Indiana, so a split gives them that tiebreaker.)  The Wiz look more like the team a lot of us expected before the virus upended their season. Russell Westbrook has been a net positive over the past month, and he's 36-of-63 in the last five minutes of close games. Bradley Beal is scorching after a brief injury absence. Davis Bertans found his jumper. Their defense, once laughable, has stiffened.  The Wiz are getting two-way production from their old-school three-headed center rotation of Alex Len, Robin Lopez, and Daniel Gafford. I have no idea how that's a thing in the year of our basketball gods 2021, but it is. Len is fine as token starter. Gafford has been a rim-running, shot-blocking revelation since the Wiz acquired him from Chicago in an exchange of players so random it reads like some NBA geek's trade deadline Mad Libs.  Lopez is averaging 9.7 points on 69% shooting since March 1. He has cracked 15 points in seven of his past 13 games. For a selfless bruiser, that represents an explosion. Lopez has been money with his floor-scraping, ice-cream-scoop hook shot. The Wiz have scored 1.17 points per possession when Lopez shoots from the post or passes to a teammate who launches -- sixth (!) among 80 players with at least 50 post touches, per Second Spectrum data.  Lopez remains a devoted box-out maestro, and an expert at getting teammates open. He's always nudging and jostling defenders to pry open space for Washington's shooters.  Watch the little shoulder check he lays on poor De'Anthony Melton in the left corner, unlocking a layup for Bertans: https://media.video-cdn.espn.com/gifs/mp4/Lopez_2gif.mp4  Lopez strolls in Melton's general area before veering into him. He looks like some high school punk deliberately bumping someone in the hallway to start a fight."
"&gt; I)  The subtle magic of Stephen Curry  How do you get open when all five defenders are focused on you? We know the common methods. Curry can roast his guy one-on-one, leveraging the threat of the most accurate jumper in league history. He can use a screen from Draymond Green, rumbling into open space more often now with James Wiseman injured -- and the Warriors playing more with Green at center.  Those two make such magic together. What they have is really why we follow basketball. It is what every player searches for, but few find: a hoops soulmate who amplifies your game, sees the floor through your eyes, and reads your intentions the moment you do. Some of their greatest mutual highlights are the product of improvisation -- tweaking some tried-and-true action at the last second because of something only they visualize.  But one of my favorite Steph-isms, on full brilliant display during this incandescent month, is the game of hide-and-seek Curry plays in the chaos of transition.  He seems disinterested, casual. Then he stops and turns his back to the rim. What? Is he setting a back screen? It looks that way. That's not it, though. Curry spies Alex Len loitering near the paint -- far from his man (Kevon Looney). What Curry is really doing is waiting for Looney. Once Looney arrives, Curry slips behind him.  Curry sprints diagonally, and right into Jayson Tatum. As he makes contact, Curry motions for Andrew Wiggins to pop out -- as if that's the plan. Nope. Wiggins cuts to the rim, and both defenders follow him. Green finishes the con job with a glance at Wiggins before shoveling to Curry.  Curry is one of one. The league has never seen this level of on-ball potency and off-ball relentlessness in the same player. Most churning off-ball rovers run around the way they do because they can't do much with the ball. They need to catch it at the right angle, with the right amount of space, to get their shots off. Curry can contort himself into a triple from anywhere, anytime. There are no boundaries to his creativity.  That is so calculated. Curry goes right around that first Green pick. Green is open. The pass is there. But Curry senses that by reversing course, he can drag Davis Bertans a few extra feet from Kent Bazemore -- and craft an easier shot.  Curry probably isn't winning MVP if the Warriors finish around .500, but he has planted himself in the conversation. As of now, I would guess the three names to appear on the most ballots would be Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, and Curry.  But Curry's magnificent season is more important for what it portends. He has reestablished himself as a first-team All-NBA-level player. He is already something beyond a franchise icon. Golden State owes Curry an honest effort at chasing championships over the next three seasons.  The biggest question in the league -- the one the Warriors must ask themselves each day -- is how close they are with Green, Curry, and Klay Thompson returning from two devastating injuries, and their current supporting cast. The answer depends in part on external variables: Who might rise and fall in the West? But factoring in age-related decline for all three stars and rust for Thompson, the safest assumption is the Warriors need something else to pop.  It might not have to be something huge -- the addition of another star via some megatrade that would involve one or both of Wiseman and the shiny Minnesota Timberwolves pick Golden State owns. It could be internal growth from a couple of key guys, including Wiseman making a huge leap soon.  Regardless: This Curry -- this destroyer -- demands prioritizing the immediate future."
"Wow, my guess is, that this is a troll post?  But I guess I could still write an answer anyway.  He posts up more and more this year and he slowly becomes more effeicient at it, his defense is ok and gets better with his ongoing recovery. Off all the major rotation players of the Mavs he has the best defensive rating, but he is still ways off from being a big positive factor. Centers don't need to look great against guards in space, that is not their primary function, under the basket he is already good again, except against the the skilled, tall and big bruiser types like e.g. Ayton or Vooch, who outmuscle him.  Defensive liability is a gross mischaracterisation, but with his current form he is only a good rim protector, who loses effectiveness outside of the paint. Still his foot speed is recovering somewhat nicely the last 1 1/2 months, so even that might change until the playoffs.  Bertans is far away from being KP, since Davis can't block anything, rebounds far less and is a one dimensional offensive player, while Porzingis shoots 3s, midrangers, posts up, gets a few offensive rebounds and drives to the basket again.  He is not yet worth his contract, but the moment his offball movements gets more crispy, especially if he starts rim rolling with better timing and explosiveness he will be living up to the money he earns, as long as he can play 75% of his games and is available in the playoffs, which is the real concern, that might always be the ultimate factor regarding his value."
"Kristaps’ development has been so disappointing. New York Tingus looked like he could have been an elite rim runner, rim protector, along with his offensive skills. However, he’s a liability defensively &amp; picked on by every team, and he doesn’t use his height to bang in the post ever. He’s basically a glorified Davis Bertans now"
but what does that mean for poor davis bertans 😔
"if they need an enforcer, trade for the best latvian in the league, davis bertans"
Davis Bertans is making 16 million a year just off that.
Is anyone going to pay that? Sounds like Davis Bertans 2.0
Last time it was Davis Bertans who suddenly turned into Steph Curry.
"Not disappointed but I thought Trae would be a 30ppg lock  Lauri Markannen. It's been frustrating last seasons. I blamed the HC. Not anymore.  Bledsoe. I didn't expect that much after the bad playoffs. But man, he's been horrendous.  JJ Redick. At times, it looked washed  Davis Bertans. I expected a jump, not a regression.  Siakam"
Davis Bertans and Joe Harris. Bad bad men from beyond the arc
Wizards Legend Davis Bertans😂
"They are paying Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, BY FAR their best players, 70 million dollars for the next two years and you want them to focus on player development of a player that most likely will be just a decent starter in the future?  In case you haven't noticed, the Wizards aren't rebuilding, they are bad because they have zero good shooters aside from Davis Bertans, because they have one of the worst coaches in the league and because they can't stop anyone, they aren't bad on purpose and building young talent isn't their priority when they have two All-Stars on their payroll.  The Wizards are STARTING five players that shoot below 33% from 3 and they can't guard a parking car, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know why they are 22-33. Russ and Beal are the least of their problems, if they didn't have one or the other they might've won less than 10 games this year."
Davis Bertans
"I wouldn't say that. We were just screwed by our star player completely killing his trade value and forcing his way out. Then Marcus Morris screwing us over is why we missed the playoffs last season. Just 1 more win is all we needed to probably be the 8 seed. Even if Morris never agrees to come to San Antonio, we don't trade Davis Bertans to make room for him and end up with Lyles instead."

Davis Bertans and some Swiss cheese
You forgot Davis Bertans.
KD is a big man? Davis Bertans?
He’s been pretty good. He’s effectively our 4th option with a healthy team. Play defence hit a 3 here and there and catch some lobs from Jokic. We need him tho with MPJ playing like a tan Davis Bertans.
"But by that logic if Gobert took a few threes a game he'd no longer be a traditional big, even if he played the game the same otherwise.   Embiid does everything Gobert does, just also does more on offense. It's not like he's Davis Bertans or something. Embiid is easily the second best rim probably in the league. The only other time is see so many people just avoid the rim other than when I'm watching Sixers games, is when I'm watching Jazz games. And Rudy challenges way more shots, than Embiid, who likes to pick his spots and let his reputation do a lot of the work."
"I mean there was one Serbian final series between Partizan and Red Star where Red Star played their games in some really small arena, and the fans would spit on everyone on Partizan's bench, throw lighters, coins and similar stuff at players, not to mention standard pointing lasers into the eyes. Maybe the craziest thing was shanking of the basket construction during Partizan's three throw attempts. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKVq58xwgLU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKVq58xwgLU) This is just a short video where partizan players were attacked after celebrating victory with their fans. On the other side you can see some of familiar faces wearing Partizan's jersey like Davis Bertans, Joeffrey Lauvergne (played for the Nuggets, OKC, Spurs and Bulls) and the Cavs legend himsefl- Sasha Pavlovic."
"Well, Davis Bertans was awarded this title in the first round - “Probably the worst defender I have ever seen.”  We have to chose the one winner, man. Maybe it’s actually someone else?"
He’s the western conference Davis Bertans
But you already have a Davis Bertans!
"It's unsustainable. They have to fix the buyout system, or guys aren't even going to make trade demands. Guys like Gary Harris or Davis Bertans are just going to get a contract, demand a buyout right after, and get paid by small market teams for the next 3 years to play on a minimum deal for LA or New York.   They should force the team that signs them to reimburse the buyout team for their salary. Or add it to their luxury tax total."
"# Congratulations, Khris Middleton, for winning the Davis Bertans Award for Outstanding Shooting!"
Davis Bertans 1.5
He’s more Davis Bertans than KD
It felt like he was just a giant even more overpaid Davis Bertans this playoffs
KP is Latvian Davis Bertans confirmed. Wait...
Davis Bertans
No one is arguing that he’s played like utter shit. It’s clear that he doesn’t really want to be there though. He’s basically relegated to taking shots only when Luka passes him the ball or when THJ doesn’t have the ball.  I think he’s still more offensively talented than becoming a taller Davis Bertans but it’s his lack of effort on defense and rebounding that makes it seem like he doesn’t even care.
mavs gona sign Alex Len and Davis Bertans this offseason
Davis Bertans in thick-soled sneakers
"Christ, everyone who plays in San Antonio isn't a system player getting propped up by Pop. The only thing that changed in DeMar's game in San Antonio is him improving his playmaking and shooting slightly less. Why would that not carryover to a new team?  And this narrative that players in San Antonio leaving and getting exposed elsewhere hasn't been true for a while. Kawhi, Danny Green, Bryn Forbes, Kyle Anderson, and Davis Bertans have all had success since leaving in the past few years. Take Pop off this pedestal."
"yea, ceiling is Davis Bertans Plus. With better defense."
"&gt;Washington desperately needs a five, as we saw Gafford, Lopez and Len get abused this series against Philly.   I mean, against Embiid, yeah.  So would Nurkic.  Against everyone else they were actually pretty decent defending the paint.  &gt;Wizards get: Jusif Nurkic Blazers get: Davis Bertans, Deni Advija  lol no thanks.  we just lost our only shooter and only wing.  Maybe if it's for Thomas Bryant instead, but portland probably wouldn't want that."
"That's how I feel too as a neutral who's rooting for Mavs. Kawhi has better consistency and a respectable sidekick in PG13.  Luka has no one to help him, and when he's off like tonight, it's over. KP is a $36 million/yr Davis Bertans."
KP is basically a taller more expensive Davis Bertans now
"KD is going to be good until he’s 40, at least. The washed version of him is still Davis Bertans."

"KP out here lookin like Davis Bertans, so allergic in the paint"
"Mavs might as well trade KP for Davis Bertans at this point, it wouldn't make them any worse"
Shooters will get paid. He's just as good as Davis Bertans right now.
haha davis bertans being out is a benefit for the wiz. Dude is awful
"&gt;Off the top of my head, I could see an argument for Klay, Dame, Korver, Reddick, Duncan Robinson, and Davis Bertans.   Ain't no way you slipped Bertans in the discussion for 2nd best shooter. Also, the disrespect to Joe Harris"
Give me Davis Bertans.
"Let's just say that you're right that CJ's player build is a better FIT for Miami than Butler (I don't necessarily agree but you seem convinced).  Even then, they are not even remotely close to the same tier of player. Your trade proposal would be like the 76ers trading Ben Simmons for Davis Bertans just to get more shooting."
Davis Bertans is applauding from the bench
Davis Bertans has a podcast lmao?
You guys would beat the Jazz but not because of Davis Bertans lol
Davis Bertans is freaking shit player man.

"Dumb statemenr tbh. Like dude there are mentally dumb people out there, they don't care if you Bradley Beal or Davis Bertans."

Montrezl Harrell lost at least 20M total from lockdown to the bubble. He was looking at least 2/40M offers before the bubble exposed him. Davis Bertans agent on the other hand is the GOAT for making him not play the bubble.
If only the Spurs kept that core of Bryn Forbes and Davis Bertans.
signing players purely for 3-pt shooting can either be Bryn Forbes or Davis Bertans
"He really doesn't do anything else aside from spacing the floor. You could replace him with the current version of Davis Bertans and you won't notice anything, maybe they would drop by 2-3 wins in the regular season. He commands double teams on the post by reputation, but once the Clippers figured out he's shit and they could park Reggie Jackson on him, they stopped taking the bait and now he ain't doing anything.  &amp;#x200B;  I watched every game of the Mavs this season. The current KP is shit. Don't get me wrong, I still hope he gets a proper postseason so he can work on his game. Right now we need to win a playoff series first, the way Luka is playing. We don't wanna waste it."
"He's starting a new academy called the tingus pingus academy. It consists of very tall power forwards who can't post up, rebound or play D. They can only shoot 3s.   The current members of tingus pingus academy are:-  Porzingis  Lauri Markannen  Davis bertans.   He is looking to expand the tingus pingus academy all over the globe. Rn there are only European recruits playing for his academy."
He's a taller Davis Bertans
"2003: Spurs trade the draft rights to Leandro Barbosa to Phoenix for a 2005 first-round pick  2005: San Antonio trades Malik Rose, the 2005 pick from Phoenix, and a 2006 first round pick for Nazr Mohammed and Jamison Brewer. Now, this wasn't bad, since Mohammed played a role in delivering the 2005 championship but then...  2005 NBA draft: New York Knicks draft David Lee with the #30 pick conveyed through the Malik Rose trade.  ----  2011: San Antonio trades George Hill to Indiana for the 15th pick (Kawhi Leonard) and the 42nd pick (Davis Bertans).  2018: San Antonio trades Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green to Toronto for DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Pöltl, and a 2019 first round pick (Keldon Johnson)."
Davis Bertans
I mean it’s cool to shoot jumpers even if you’re tall but that can’t be the ONLY part of your game. You can drive and attack the basket or post up and at least force some type of action for a foul call.  Or you can just shoot jumpers like Davis Bertans. Just probably don’t give him a max contract to act as a giant inflatable wavy man floor spacer.
"Porzingis is capable of making truly incredible basketball “plays”. That’s why he was nicknamed The Unicorn because he has the ability to do many different things on the court at his size.  The main issue is just because he’s able to do many things he’s not really good at anything consistently besides being tall and jacking up threes. He has the ability to sometimes protect the rim, sometimes post up, and sometimes create for himself in isolation. He’s never going to play good defense, playmake for others, or be aggressive enough consistently to be counted on for concrete offensive production. Dallas fans can you tell that no one REALLY knows what you are going to get from him on any given night.  Porzingis is really that “potential” player that a lot of teams salivate for but when you get him you realize that this isn’t as awesome as you thought it was going to be. He’s honestly slowly morphing into a taller and less efficient Davis Bertans."
Playing like 7’3 davis bertans
Nah thats Davis Bertans
KP is a glorified Davis Bertans
Davis fucking Bertans

i still love davis bertans to death but goddamn
John collins has 0 points and 5 fouls and he wants a max contract he can go fuck himself lol. He obviously heard what Davis Bertans did tonight
"Oh lord Davis “$80,000,000 man” Bertans fouls out with 0 points. Ooooof"
while currently hockey is probably the nr.1 sport of latvia i think that will turn around in a few decades  Latvian goverment is gonna build a big ass basketball hub with multiple courts inside n shit in a few years and then Davis Bertans also is opening a basketball school in their hometwon   also besides world cups i feel like there is a lot more media coverage about our basketball players because basketball has more “personality” purely because you see the players faces while in hockey players have helmets n shit
"While they are at it, they can sign the other European players as well  Goran Dragic, Luka Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nikola Vucevic, Nikola Jokic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Davis Bertans, Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert, Ricky Rubio, Evan Fournier, Danilo Gallinari, Domantas Sabonis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Dennis Schroeder"
"But at the same time Nash has also said in interviews how he thinks players today take too many ill advised three point shots. Nash was the first MVP I saw growing up and his game was a lot more inside out then I think takes like these give credit. I don’t know if Nash would ever hit that high of a three point attempt average just because he was such an adept three level score and he was also one of the smartest players from his era and I think he would certainly hit 5 3PA a game 7 feels a little too high for Nash especially since he had a good feel for the flow of a game and if he went like 0-2 or 3 he would try and attack another way. I actually see a lot of the intellect of Nash’s game in guys like Malcolm Brogdon or Devin Booker, albeit they aren’t necessarily at the level of passer that Nash was. They are hardly ever going to disrupt the flow of their offense for a bad outside shot, they get in and attack the paint and will take what you give them they got spots at all 3 levels where those guys are cash.  He also wasn’t a high-usage guy. In his mvp seasons he had I think 18 and 21% usage rates. I think even if Nash was lacing em up having grown up today he’s too smart of a guy to just jack 3s up at the rates we see guys like Duncan Robinson or Davis Bertans do. I think we’d always wring our hands a little bit asking Nash to shoot more"
"Goran Dragic, Luka Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic   Dennis Schroeder, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Davis Bertans, Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert  Ricky Rubio, Evan Fournier, Danilo Gallinari, Domantas Sabonis, Nikola Vucevic (this squad could almost be all big men)  # EURO SQUAD, ASSEMBLE"
You’ll take Davis Bertans missing an unnecessarily deep fadeaway contested 3 and you’ll like it.
What help you talking about. In OKC him and kd were exchanging injuries each year after their 2012 run. The only year were both were healthy was in 2016 and they made the finals nearly. His OKC teammates after that just was not good enough for contention except for Paul George who also disappointed in the playoffs. Houston rockets was not expected to get to the finals that year and they did not have a Big man to guard Anthony Davis that series. Wizards players except for bradley is fucking trash. Bertans cannot make a shot for his life.
Fuck Davis Bertans. All my homies hate Davis Bertans.
"DC needs more 3-point shooters. We have Davis Bertans and sorta Beale, but nobody else that can reliably shoot a 3."
I genuinely blame Davis trash bertans and the Beal and Westbrook turnovers for this loss. Bertans thinks he's Klay Thompson or something doing pull up 3s and it kills the entire rhythm they get going of scoring consecutively.
DAVIS BERTANS DIDN'T BRICK IT HOLY SHIT HEAD TO THE BUNKER THE END COULD VERY WELL BE NEAR
DAVIS FUCKING BERTANS
Davis bertans got like 70 or 80 mil Duncan is definitely getting that as well
"it's really not lol Davis Bertans is making like 18+. 15 for a much higher upside, much better athlete, is definitely worth it."

"Davis Bertans was the worst defender on a team that had Bryn Forbes and Marco Belinelli. I’m a bit naive as I didn’t watch a lot of Portland this past year, but I can’t imagine he’d be a solution for their problems"
"Cant forget class acts joe ingles,kelly onlynk and davis bertans"
***he's trash. names should exchange him. i'm thinking curry for davis bertans and a subsequent sounds like a decent arrangement***
he’s garbage. dubs should trade him. i’m thinking curry for davis bertans and a second sounds like a good plan
Not in order  1. Love 2. Bledsoe 3. Kemba 4. Gobert 5. John Wall 6. Horford 7. Buddy Hield 8. Harrison Barnes 9. Eric Gordon 10. Joe Harris 11. Steven Adams 12. Davis Bertans 13. Gary Harris 14. Rubio 15. Marcus Morris 16.Terrence Ross 17. Malik Beasley 18. KCP 19. Al-Farouq Aminu 20. DeAndre Jordan
Like lowkey he might be washed as a coach now. His team is super midrange heavy when we’ve proven thats not a good thing nowadays and he notably held back Davis Bertans.
Does anyone remember when Davis Bertans just awkwardly laid their on the floor and peoples was just playing around him earlier on the floor?
"Getting Bryant back is a big deal, but I swear the Wizards roster construction is the laziest shit I’ve seen in sports management. It’s just a smattering of random ass players that don’t mesh, and then there’s the albatross of Davis Bertans, probably easily the worst contract in the NBA. They’ll definitely win more games because they proved that they can win a little when they’re healthy. But with Westbrook and Beal, if they had a supporting cast, they would be competing for home court in the East.  Having said that, Rui is nice."
Hmmm Davis Bertans and Thomas Bryant for Kristaps Porzingis.
Dude has the exact same contract as Davis Bertans.
"Spurs have made 8 trades since the Hill/Kawhi deal.  Also worth noting that the Spurs picked up Davis Bertans in that deal as well.  Hill's first season in Indy was the last year of his rookie contract.  After that he signed a 5yr $40m deal with the Pacers.  Not exactly max money, but a very good contract at that time."
"I’m not arguing for us to pay him the max, but almost every sing criticism gets blown out of proportion. He’s a positive team defender and a good weak side shot blocker which fits with Capela’s rim protection very well. He’s an elite off ball threat that teams have to pay attention to or risk giving up a 3 or a putback. He had a very solid mid range and post game and takes advantage of size mismatches when teams switch on Trae. His gravity rolling to the rim off screens pull bigs back which opens up floaters for Trae. He has a huge impact on the team and does most of it without the ball in his hands.  People act like he literally has no skill at all and is Davis bertans without the shot."
"I don't know why you're doubling down on this.  Not being able to create his own shot and not being put in that role are two different things.  One way you can tell is by looking at his shooting stats for the last two seasons.  in '20 with the Pistons, 67% of his shots were pull-ups, floaters, or lay-ups.  in '21 with the Clips, that number fell to 54% as he was asked to spot up more.  If you want to compare that to a player who really doesn't create his own shot, Davis Bertans took less than 20% of his shots on pull-ups, floaters, or lay-ups last year."

"He also shot 32% during the regular season, which was a much larger sample size of 423 attempts. Which is kind of funny, since that 3 season would have been the 26th most just THIS season, behind Davis Bertans (who played 57 games vs. Jordan's 240)."
"Yep, not a single player left from the 2018-2019 roster.   Davis: LA  Jrue: Milwaukee   Randle and Elf: NY  Fashion Jackson and Jah: Detroit   Uncle E: Phoenix  Solo: Atlanta   Miller and Kenny Hustle: OKC  Mirotic: Euroleague   Clark, Cheick, Dairis Bertans, Tim Frazier: N/A"
"Let’s put it into perspective… Davis Bertans and Joe Harris is worth around $20m/year… the rookie max is around $25m/year.   Ask this simple question… would you rather have said player than Davis Bertans/Joe Harris? If the answer is yes, they will be maxed"
Davis Bertans has no P in his name though…
"He has single handedly won us crucial playoff games and was the 2nd/3rd best player for 3 titles, he is absolutely a star and deserved his max contract. Pre injuries any team in the league would be happy to pay him what we did.  I don’t understand why you even brought him up considering he’s making 40m a year. I was referring to Davis Bertans who signed for 5/80m last offseason."
Averages rounded down for the starters:  * Ben 14pts. * Kevin Durant 26 pts. * Davis Bertans 11pts. * Porzingus 20pts. * Rudy Gobert 14 pts.  Sum = 85pts.  It's not looking positive.
Imagine Davis Bertans being your starting shooting guard though
Would Sixers fans be interested in Davis Bertans?

"You might be paying a shooter $20m soon and given his last playoff performance I’d rather have Simmons. Straight shooters are dangerous, because it’s so variable and they don’t provide anything else. See also: Joe Harris, Davis Bertans."

american davis bertans
"He still is an iso-god, he just can't rely on raw athleticism to get him to the hoop any more. Have we been watching the same Point God this season? Off the curl/pin-down/on-ball screen, if a big switches onto him, it's a mid-range bomb in isolation after a combo or two.   Kevon Looney has, I would say, borderline elite foot speed and defensive positioning. Definitely a product of the system he plays in, but he's very capable at switching onto most wing/guard players for a possession, helps that he's undersized at 6'9'' for the position so not the best comparison I think.   I fully believe he could still blow by a traditional center, or even Davis Bertans or a 3-4-5 of that caliber."
Davis bertans
"No it wouldn't. They are a deep team. Capela is a great center that is a lob threat and good defender. Collins is a 4 that can shoot from outside and score inside. Bogdan is a versatile combo guard. Gallinari is one of the better bench players in the league and can shoot from anywhere with basically anyone guarding him. Huerter, Reddish, and Hunter all all decently good young players. Plus they picked up Lou Williams who can be useful in certain matchups.  The wizards third best player is probably Rui Hachimura or Davis Bertans. After them, their roster gets bad real quick. They're so bad that Daniel Gafford, a dude they basically picked up for free was a big game changer for them."
"When he played for San Antonio, I swear Davis Bertans wouldn't miss against OKC."
"Funny.  But if someone hasn't figured it out.   Davis Bertans.   So no, KAT isn't even the best 3-point shooting big right now.  And if you want to look at just overall shooting, Dirks volume, shot difficulty and percentages from mid-rage are just unmatched.  He probably has a case for a Center, tho. But again, high volume shooting centers are a recent trend. I would guess we gonna see a lot more in the future and there are gonna be plenty of challengers for KAT."
they wouldnt beat moochie norris cole anthony davis bertans
"IMO it's a solid contract for the Celtics.  Look how much Joe Harris, Davis Bertans and Duncan Robinson are making.  Of course Smart is not the shooter they are but he is much better on defense.  The Celtics locked their role player into a very good deal."
"i mean depends if you are KD or Davis Bertans, wide variance most aren’t worth $35M/yr."
"Davis Bertans - if he's on, then it's great for the team. If not, he provides next to nothing, though he still needs to be accounted for from 3.   The contract could prove valuable as a trade chip, if Washington keeps trying to build around Beal. Otherwise, on a hopeful playoff contender, he's signed for 4 more years, at $16M/yr. And, with their latest trade, Bertans now has to compete with Kuzma for minutes at PF, in addition to Rui"

"He really ought to have more than anyone, especially given the personal turmoil he was going through should have pulled a Davis Bertans. Was that deal on the table after the bubble? That was the romoured number pre-bubble."
"He shot 34% last year and 36% the two prior years, so I wouldn't count on him maintaining that.    More importantly, that's still a one-trick-pony, not a ""versatile"" player.  It's like calling Davis Bertans versatile.  And Bertans at least constantly moves trying to get himself open and he terrifies defenses - almost twice as many of LM's 3s were ""wide open"" this year.    On that note, Lauri's 3P% was buoyed by over 40% of his 3s being ""wide open,"" and him shooting 43% on those.    He didn't make any under ""very tight"" coverage, shot 33% on ""tight"" coverage, and shot 35% when he was ""open."""
"Dragic too old to be a core part.  But he could help some this year.  Also might be a progress stopper for Brunson if Brunson doesn't go out in trade.  I wouldn't mind adding Dragic due to the Luka connection, but not worth giving up anything of value.  Markannen has a lot of upside, but some risk.  He could be just a shooting specialist good for 15 minutes a game.   Like a Davis Bertans.  On the upside, Markannen could become a 20 point, 9 rebound, efficient scoring All Star stretch PF.  Not likely, but it is possible he could be the Mavs 3rd star."
My bad you’re right I can’t believe people aren’t talking about the one random 30 point game by a random journeyman role player on an 8 seed team in a random regular season game. Brb gonna go write up a serious effort post about Davis Bertans that I’m sure will be the talk of the sub.
Making up for us sending them davis bertans for free
"What a dumb comment. Bertans was terrible last year, Lauri in almost same amount of mins was almost better in all except Bertans shot more 3s. They are very comparable except Davis will only shoot threes and Lauri will occasionally be more versatile otherwise it's completely understandable why he looks at that contract as a basis."
Now how do they somehow bring Davis Bertans bacl as well.
"So we need shooting and we need guys who can play the 4. We get both in McDermott - who just had the best season of his career - in a market where Davis Bertans is making 16mil/year for 5 years and Duncan Robinson is making 18mil/5 years. Devonte Graham is making almost the same amount as McDermott for 4 years and he's a 5'11"" guard who has shot &lt;40% on 2s for his career.  We're only paying him for 3 years and our young guys **need** shooting around them to develop properly."
-Overpay for Lowry  -A joke of an extension for Butler who looked straight washed this postseason  -Over the hill PJ Tucker  -Kept Davis Bertans… I mean Duncan Robinson  Why are they getting praised?
"I am actually a Bertans defender for the most part I think he's still really good at what he does. But we need to find a way to cut salary and we just drafted a possible cheap replacement for Davis, if Kispert lives up to the hype"
let me know when someone like Davis Bertans gives Book credit. Then we can talk.
"So the boost in efficiency has a lot more to do with how Donovan used him. More than half his shots were from 3, and around half of those were corner threes. The previous regime (beyond being awful jerks) tried to see if a post game would develop and it didn't.   He could develop and show consistency where previously he's shown just flashes, but right now I think of players like Matt Bonner and Davis Bertans as far a role he'd thrive in. He'd be beyond a rich man's Matt Bonner (more like a Jeff Bezos' Matt Bonner), but that's how Pop has used similar offensive profiles before (though Markennen shows far more athleticism and comparative defensive chops).  Pop's also shown willingness in the past to fit an offense around his players, but with DeRozan potentially moving on, I dunno what gravity is going to draw Markanen open.  I think 4/50 would be a steal though, as the MLE is about that much, and you're probably getting about average NBA starter level net value as he is right now. If he develops and stays healthy, you'd have him on a really team friendly deal and if he sucks or is always hurt then 10 million-ish a year isn't hard to move."
"Davis Bertans, Joe Harris... If you can shoot you're getting paid.  This ain't a charity."
If they can pay Davis Bertans 5/80 anything is possible
It’s Davis bertans money
"That’s the new Davis Bertans contract, not that high per season but 5 years is a long time."
Davis Bertans vibes
Davis bertans gets destroyed when he misses 3’s. After one missed shot people just start complaining.
Davis Bertans 2.0?
Davis Bertans got out shot
HE GOT DAVIS BERTANS MONEY
White Davis Bertans
"I mean, Davis Bertans is making $16 million a year and he’s a much worse player"
Its good but not elite due to his volume   Davis Bertans also shoots 40% from 3 but he does so on more attempts per game. 7.5 for Lauris 5.8  I don't think anyone would call Julius Randle an elite 3 point shooter but he has about the same volume and accuracy as Lauri and his shots are much harder. They aren't open 3s
"Can't say I'd agree with Markkanen being a top 100 player or a solid starter. To me Lauri is just another Davis Bertans in that he's a bad defender whose only worthwhile skill is his 3 ball right now, so on any given night where that 3 ball isn't falling for him he's a legitimate net negative to his team."
"Danny Green at least attempts defense, he is a homeless mans Davis Bertans."

Fuck I thought you sneaked in Davis Bertans there
"I mean, the hope is that he becomes Davis Bertans, right?"
Faking Davis Bertans and Ish Smith. How much more help does this guy need
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
Players just get overpaid.  Davis Bertans is the most recent example. Washington wanted a haul for him at the deadline and now he's about negative value considering his contract and defensive liabilities.
"[Mayo] The Wizards asked for Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the Nos. 7 and 14 picks in tonight’s NBA draft along with two future first-rounders in exchange for Davis Bertans, according to multiple sources. The Warriors quickly turned down the offer."
On 10 shots a game against defensive stalwart Davis fucking Bertans
[omg davis bertans' contract???](https://i.chzbgr.com/full/9622534912/h8B2CBA8F/person-who-want-no-100)
"i would be genuinely curious to see if CP3 really managed to remain top 5 in on/off for a 10-year period between 2008 and 2018, or the same with RAPM, as that would be remarkable.   espn's real plus minus had cp3 12th in 2009, so he had already dropped out of the top 5 a year into this period. then he came back into the top 5 for the next 4 years (very impressive), but fell to 6th in 2016  that stat is quite weird though because fred van vleet was 3rd in 2018, with alec peters and davis bertans being 6th and 7th. i will admit though, cp3 seems to have been top 5 in espn's real plus minus for 8 out of the 10 years"
Davis Bertans.  Just sayin'.
"Miami or Philly. I feel like him and Bam complement each other’s game so well, and they Miami would have enough cap to get some good depth and S5 power around those two if they let go of guys like Jimmy Butler, Gordon Dragic, and Trevor Ariza they could even get a lot more. A starting 5 I think would push the heat up top would be this  PG-Malcom Brogdan SG-Bradley Beal SF-Davis Bertans PF-Bam Adebeyo C-Brook Lopez"
"""I have to make a decision before the draft."" - Sounds like someone who talked to Draymond about the Wiggins, Wiseman, 7th, and 14th package.   Draft picks are a lot more attractive when you're the team making the call, and the Wizards probably could even send Wiseman, 7th, and 14th to another team to move into the Top 4 to get someone they really like if they're not in love with Wiseman or the options at 7.  This trade just makes too much sense not to happen. The salaries also work out in a way that allows the Warriors to take back another player in addition to Beal, removing the depth problem that Wiggins trades present.  If the trade is executed after the Warriors make their selections, with the Warriors picking for the Wizards (as most draft trades are executed) it also opens up Golden State trading another first round pick without having to redo the protections on the pick owed to Memphis.  Final trade should be   **Wizards Trade**  * Bradley Beal * Davis Bertans  **Warriors Trade**  * Andrew Wiggins * James Wiseman * 7th pick in 2021 draft * 14th pick in 2021 draft * Unprotected 2028 first round pick  That's a heck of a package, and Golden State gets to go all in on the last years of Curry's prime."
Quality shooter followed by Joe Harris or Davis Bertans should never be muttered

"Davis Bertans got 5 yrs 80 mil, and bridges is younger, more potential, and better than him. So yeah a team will definitely throw the max at him."
"&gt;saying that player could help your nba team push towards a nba playoff berth his rookie year is quite insane too.  Is it really? We’ve seen situations like this dozens of times. This is a prospect that is touted as NBA ready, has a skill that is the single most important in basketball, and is also a skill that pelicans Badly need. Assuming a 22 year old rookie shooter who has a track record of winning and consistency with his shot will help an nba team win games isn’t far fetched. The pelicans already have a team that has the star talent to make the playoffs they just need pieces around those guys.   You as a Celtics fan should know that’s false, we saw rookie Tatum heavily contribute to the Celtics. (I’m not comparing the 2 as players, just what they can provide to a team.)  &gt;They have , Lonzo (for now), Kira Lewis and Alexander Walker, when you is he ever starting?  Neither Kira Lewis Jr, or NAW are starters, I think Kispert could come in day 1 and be a better fit next to Zion over them. That being said I already stated that this is a position-less league he will likely play anywhere from the 2 to 4 spots in the league depending on lineups, and at 10 you’re trying to get a guy that can play a role.  Kispert doesn’t have to start . A guy like Davis Bertans whose one of the best floor spacers in the league comes of the bench and still impacts the game with his floor spacing.   &gt;If you need shooting, you don’t need uncertainty from a rookie   With this logic teams should just always trade their draft picks away if their scared for uncertainty. Everyone has bust potential even LeBron had it.  &gt;go get Duncan Robinson or someone   You mean Duncan Robinson whose looking to get 15-20 million in free agency? Getting shooters isn’t easy, if it was every team would have them"
KP is also basically Davis Bertans defensively at this point.
"I was trying to give you the benefit of a doubt, but maybe your brain isn't a good asset. You saying it was ""obvious"" about the bubble a year ago is bullshit. The bubble was extremely experimental and most people thought it wouldn't be successful enough to finish the Playoffs. Compared to now,, no one knew anything about covid, and everyone was scared of the ramifications of getting it.     Bradley Beal, Davis Bertans, DeAndre Jordan, and Spencer Dinwiddie all sat out the bubble. And guess what, they're all on teams. So I have no clue where you're getting this ""people don't want him because he wasn't in the bubble"" nonsense.     **The guy isn't as good as he used to be**. That's the only reason teams need not to sign him. But its weird you seem so hellbent on making it about covid."
"$20 million a year and yeah, it's pretty close. $10 million was ~16% of the salary cap back then. So worse than Davis Bertans current contract"
"That moment you realize that Shaq, in his prime, was making 30mil a year and soon that will just be Davis Bertans money"

"Show me another big who shot 39% on 6.5 3pa per game in a season. The only other ones are KAT in 35 games in 2020, Ryan Anderson, Davis Bertans, and Rashard Lewis if you want to count him as a big."
"Chris Broussard. And bonus pick: Drew Gooden as the wiz color guy is flat out embarrassing. Messes something up every game, says something offensive every game, says something nonsensical every game. Says something literally every game where I’m sitting there like “Yo, do you have a 5th grade education?” Also the first game after Bertans signs his big deal, Drew, in DC, has the nerve to say “There’s a new Sniper in town, and his name is Davis.” What a joke"
Davis Bertans got 80mil for 5 years last year.Duncan got 90 mil for 5 years this year. So yeah inflation still applies.
"I still imagine where Mirotic would be had he not returned to Spain. At the time, there were rumors that he would sign a Davis Bertans-lite contract with Utah. He would have been phenomenal on the Wolves, too."
"Go look up davis bertans and duncan Robinson's contract and cry about it, son..."
"Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Go look up Davis Bertans' and Duncan Robinson's contracts, and cry about it.  Players who shoot 40+% from 3 get paid in the NBA.  Period.  Sorry..."
Players who shoot 40+% from 3 get paid in the NBA.  Risk?  A little?  But he wasnt going to drop far below that anywhere.  Just ask Duncan Robinson and Davis Bertans
&gt; Davis Bertans  The $$ amount isn't crazy but it is absolutely a negative value contract.
Paul George and Davis Bertans don’t belong on that list.

Maybe shooters like Duncan Robinson or Davis Bertans ?
Davis Bertans and Bogdan Bogdanovic are good friends from their time playing in Serbia which is something some fans wouldn’t know
Tempted to put Bertans there haha! We can have Terrence Davis at the 3
"Beal was out when the Wiz were fighting for a PLAY-IN spot and during those play-in games and Russ put up great performances to get that team to the playoffs.   So you're saying you put Russ on a team with fucking Lebron James and Anthony Davis, and that's the same as the team he was on last year where the best player after him and Brad was who? Rui? Bertans? Get the fuck outta here."
"I truly don't hate Lauri, he's just not going to be the player we all envisioned him to be. He is going to be a 6th man and score 15 Pts/G on 12 shots a game with poor defense and average to below average rebounding.   He was assisted on 85% of his made shots last year (per cleaning the glass). So I am not sure if better point guard play is going to increase his scoring.   He is athletic for his size, but like you said he has a history of injuries and I doubt that is going to stop and would probably only get worse if he does try to rebound at an above average rate for his position.   I do think he is a better player than my original comp of Davis Bertans, but not good enough in any other area for teams to play him differently."
Davis Bertans got paid for doing just that
"The Nuggets bench reaction is hilarious but for me it's Davis Bertans looking in utter disbelief.  Just standing there like ""whoa"""

picture him in davis bertans role
"Davis Bertans and Nikola Mirotic are two all-time shootings bigs that i’d *never* want on my team. In Mirotic’s case *again* I guess.  In fact, I’d like the Bucks to stay as far away from European bigs as possible. After Mirza, Niko, washed Pau, Dragan, old Ersan, I think I’m good.

"That's just the high volume 3 pt world we live in now. It's never been easier to get 30 points than at any point in basketball history. If you're a high efficiency 3 pt shooter and you get hot and take a high volume of shots, bam: you have 30 points and it doesn't even look difficult.  In this day and age anyone can make scoring 30 points look easy, Davis Bertans could literally do it tomorrow and I won't be surprised. That's why I chose to support guys like DeRozan and Ant: they make scoring 30 points look difficult, and that's half of the fun. I need to see the grind lol."
Who’s asked to do the least per dollar on their contract and why is it Davis Bertans
Cole Anthony is good but check this  Norris Cole Anthony Davis Bertans
Davis Bertans big ass head and small shoulders bug me

"Davis ""I think I got my swagger back"" Bertans."
"I've seen a clipp-able rim that Davis Bertans put inside his rim; also, he used 8th sized basketballs... back when he was playing in Serbia."
what is the minimum number of fingers Davis Bertans could have and still be at least an average 3 pt shooter?
Is Davis Bertans the biggest (edit:) collapse ever?
"Simmons trade idea of the day:   Sixers receive:   * Pascal Siakam  * Fred VanVleet  Wizards receive:   * Ben Simmons  Raptors receive:   * Davis Bertans  * Seth Curry  * Kyle Kuzma  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * Sixers 2023, 2027 1sts   * Sixers pick swaps every other year available  * Wizards 2025, 2027 1sts   We know that the Raptors were interested in moving on from Siakam last year (he was heavily linked to the Warriors). We know that the Wizards could use Ben Simmons. We know the Sixers are win-now and want star power.   Sixers immediately say yes to turning Simmons, Curry, Thybulle, Maxey, and picks into Siakam and VanVleet. That's two borderline all-star level players that take them, in my opinion, to the top of the Eastern Conference. VanVleet/Green/Siakam/Harris/Embiid is ridiculous. Fred and Pascal can both shoot well enough, Pascal is of course a do it all wing, Fred can run point, and both play good defense.   Wizards move a negative asset (Bertans), some second-rate youth, and some picks for Ben Simmons. A Beal/Simmons pairing works really well. Simmons can run point and play defense, Beal can play off ball and take all the shots.   Raptors move a guy they've been interested in moving (Siakam) plus a guard in his absolute prime who has limitations to his game and who doesn't quite fit their timeline (Fred). In return, they get a wealth of picks and young players, plus a PG and two forwards who can contribute immediately (Seth, Bertans, Kuzma). They can probably flip one or more of those guys for more assets or a player who fits better. Meanwhile, Matisse is a total Masai player, and Maxey is a decently promising young guard -- something the Raptors lack.    Who says no?"
"Actually I think players are worth it just for being high level shooters.  Davis Bertans and Joe Harris got around $80m and they are basically OTP's.     And regardless, Jaren doesn't stink on defense, nor does he have to play Center.  He most likely will always be a part-time wing.  Defensively he has a fouling problem, and that's pretty much the extent of it.  Many eventually great defenders had comparable foul rates when they were young (Tyson Chandler, Draymond Green, Ron Artest).  It's not reasonable to expect that to continue."
"Hot take - the basketball gods want Indiana to be good at basketball again and are doing their damndest to force them to actually pick in the lottery. Indiana has not had a lottery pick since 2015 and that pick was myles turner. Our draft position is as follows for the last 20 years. We have picked in the top ten once and that was number 10, our last top 5 pick was in 1988. The pacers refuse to be terrible and it shows, unfortunately. Hell if we kept to the picks that we have made and retained them the team would kawhi, paul George, plumlee and lavert. Fill that in with one or two free agents and that team wins multiple rings.  54  18  23  18  20- Chris Lavert  11  57  23  26 - Miles Plumlee  15 - Kawhi (davis bertans for our 2nd pick)  10 - Paul George(Lance Stephonson for our 2nd)   13  11  17  17  17  29  14  27"
"* PG: Seth Curry, Jordan Clarkson * SG: Buddy Hield, Terry Rozier * SF: Malik Beasley, Duncan Robinson * PF: Davis Bertans, Joe Harris * C: Karl Anthony-Towns, Kelly Olynyk  77% chance at playoffs (projected record of 47-35), 2% chance at a title"
"Yeah, can't forgive him for stealing the DPOY from Davis Bertans last year tho"
I'd take 6'11 or 6'7  6'10 would be good but Davis Bertans? Come on  6'3 would be good but Curry/Westbrook is probably horrible chemistry
"A lot of money will come off the books as Wiggs, Klay, and Draymonds contracts expire. Doubt we pay Wiggs with Kuminga Poole and Moody here, and Klay and Draymond will not make as much as they do right now (Esprcially Klay, cant see him making more than like Davis Bertans money)"
"I don't think there's no point, as I understand it does confer ownership of an item.  But I do think that people are spending outrageous amounts for things they think will be even more valuable later, whereas the reality is that they're paying outsized prices for things that will approach 0 as more NFTs are created or public interest moves onto the next fad.  Like if Davis Bertans hits 1000 more 3s over his career that look similar to this one, why is this moment going to hold any value?"

"significantly better than Davis ""3 point specialist"" Bertans lol"
"I think they should trade Turner for Davis Bertans and a pick or Thomas Bryant or something like that.  The Wizards have depth but desperately need rim protection, and Bertans would be a really great addition for obvious reasons. I think that trade makes both teams significantly better."
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up.

"shooters get paid, look at Davis Bertans"
Lakers   2011 Davis Bertans   2012 Tomislav Zubcic  2013 Erik Murphy  2014 no pick   2015 Jahlil Okafor   That’s a sick haul
"About a week ago someone on r/WashingtonWizards wondered if the Wizards should consider making an offer of Thomas Bryant, Aaron Holiday and Davis Bertans for Ben Simmons and someone else responded that they shouldn’t do that even if Philly was willing."
What would the cost be to get both Wood AND dump Davis Bertans to the Rockets in the same deal?
Davis bertans led the league and wasn’t invited for whatever reason
they need Davis Bertans
[Davis Bertans](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E3YktIYX0AQ_W88.jpg)
You can throw Davis Bertans on that pile
"If that’s the case I’ll do the same bullshit trades that we got offered for Beal lol  **We’ll give you Aaron Holiday, Davis Bertans and a 1st round Pick.**  *”That’s fair for both sides*"
Trade AD to the Wizards for Davis Bertans and Thomas Bryant  Ignore my flair
Would you take 1 Davis Bertans?  He’s not good at shooting 3’s but he’s tall and white and that seems to be a thing in Dallas?
Davis Bertans is god awful.
"Earl Boykins. Dude was a 5'5 microwave. Dude gets in, instant bucket. He had like 38pts vs the Ben Wallace era pistons in the mid 00's. Solid scorer too for a few years.  Probably Gerald Green &amp; Davis Bertans. Both dudes can shoot the lights out despite missing half of their ring fingers. Not to mention, both cant fully grip a basketball because of it but still got millions playing in the NBA."
**Ugly**  Deserve to sleep in the Wizards doghouse after that bum ass performance.  Speaking of “bum ass”  Anyone want a soft as butter shooter who can’t shoot? Davis Bertans is horrible.
Davis Bertans is the worst fucking player in the league
Cause his offensive stats look good in reality you got Davis bertans at sg
"Thomas Bryant, Davis Bertans and a protected 1st."
Davis Bertans and Thomas Bryant are close to returning as well
"Meanwhile the Pacers (before this year) have drafted:  Cassius Stanley (cut after 1 year)  Goga Bitadze (a Center, when we already are starting 2 Centers, barely plays)  Aaron Holiday (traded him after 3 mediocre years for a pick upgrade to get Isaiah Jackson)  Alize Johnson (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Houston)  TJ Leaf (absolute trash)  Ike Anigbogu (barely played, cut after 2 years)  Georges Niang (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Philly)  Caris LeVert (pretty good pick, but we traded him)  Myles Turner (hey, we got one right)  Joe Young (barely played, cut after 3 years)  Solomon Hill (left after 3 years, was ok)  Miles Plumlee (played 14 games here)  Kawhi Leonard (awesome pick, so obviously we traded him draft night)  Davis Bertans (another good pick we traded draft night)"
Classy Davis Bertans enjoyer spotted
"It's crazy that he was ranked 82nd by espn at one point. Robert Covington, Davis Bertans, and Eric Bledsoe are some of the players ranked significantly higher than him."
They went from having Davis Bertans be their 3rd best experienced player to being an end of the bench guy. They also upgraded coaches.
"After Duncan left i think they had 2 60 win seasons lol. And if you think Duncan was the reason they were so good from 2011 to 2017...well i hope you have Duncan in your top 5 lol   I guess it was Duncan who found Manu/Tony/Tiago/Blair/Patty Mills/Danny Green/Gary Neal, turned George Hill into Kawhi and Davis Bertans, Aaron Baynes, etc. etc."
Moochie Norris Cole Anthony Davis Bertans
"64 mil over 4 is a bargain compared to what Joe Harris, Duncan Robinson and Davis bertans got"
"At worst I would say he’s in that Duncan Robinson / Davis Bertans tier of high end role player. Even if his legs are gone and he can’t cut or defend anymore, he’s still a big strong dude with a wet shot"
new contract performance anxiety is my bet. Davis Bertans has had it too
We'll be playing with a whole lot of Davis Bertans
"For me its Davis Bertans. He is missing half of his ring finger on his shooting hand, and I am missing half of the same ring finger on my shooting hand. So its really cool for me to see him in the NBA as a 3pt specialist."
Davis Bertans&gt;Reggie Miller obviously
Davis Bertans
"His contract is a steal now. 64/4 for Kennard. 90/5 for Duncan Robinson, 80/5 for Davis Bertans, and 75/4 for Joe Harris."
"Here's an article with 22 games into season with the Wizards with 4th best offense  https://www.bulletsforever.com/2019/12/9/21001312/washington-wizards-first-quarter-nba-season-analysis-offense-defense-bradley-beal-davis-bertans  Their offensive rating prior to the bubble was 115.6 (https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/WAS/2020_games.html).  I can't tell you the relative rankings but it was elite at that point of the season.    That would have been good enough for 2nd in the NBA that season (https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_ratings.html(  Again, bubble ball without Beal and Bertans really hurt their overall offensive rating to close the season- their offensive rating in that time span was 103.85."
"Luke's contract is looking like a bargain with Duncan Robinson, Davis Bertans and Joe Harris getting 90 mil+ contracts. what great foresight to lock up Luke by the Lawrence Frank"
"Davis Bertans basically does nothing except chucking 3s and he got $18m a year  Hayward is getting at least $20m, probably closer to $25m tbh considering the skill set he brings"
I mean Robinson is the best movement shooter in the game he’s the kind of guy that warps defenses and bends game plans with his shooting gravity. But like shamet makes twice as much money and is legit bad. Davis Bertans makes 3 times as much money and is awful
"Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant, and a 2nd. Deal, Celts fans?"
He makes legit half as much money as Davis Bertans
Davis Bertans hit both of his FTs before immediately going to the locker room with an injury. A real team player on this one.
"I just woke up and read that as Young, Davis and Bertans.    Was confused and kept looking for Trae and AD in the French vid."
"Another outstanding win. I still have my reservations. Our 3-ball has been piss poor. If we were 1-4 instead of 4-1, I'm pretty sure Duncan and Lowry would be  piñata's in our sub. Dunc's is understandable, *every* team that pays their 3pt specialist will get frustrated with them on an off night(BKN - Joe Harris, WAS - Davis Bertans, etc...)   But I hope Lowry gets going eventually. He hasn't scored 10pts in a game for us yet. Kinda reminds me of Mike Conley's woeful start with Utah a few years back. At least he can contribute in other aspects.   Regardless, Bam's a rebounding machine, Herro is an electric scorer off the bench, and I love Markieff Morris."
I’d take him over Davis Bertans  He just buckles in games no one cares about !
Discount Davis Bertans maybe
KP= Davis Bertans?
Davis Bertans 2: Electric Boogaloo
"The Bucks are like Davis Bertans, they'll just shoot fuckin' anything"
He likely won't be a good defender anymore. Might be slow laterally. Will probably be a better Davis Bertans
"Lots of good ones already mentioned, I'll say davis bertans"
"We had Bryn Forbes last year, Davis Bertans, Kawhi, Danny Green, a couple years before that.  Derrick White has upped his 3pa rate, but was hurt most of the season. We still have Patty and Rudy Gay shot more 3s this year.  Pop coaches to his players strengths and by the end of the year our 2 best players in DeMar and DJ both don't shoot many 3s. Remember we started the year with LMA who had started shooting 3s a little into the 19-20 season."
Davis Bertans
Is it because it's too obvious if a choice is the reason Davis Bertans is not on this list
Davis bertans?
"Ladies and gents, Davis Bertans (The Baltic Brick) is now 0/9 from three in the play-in tournament."
davis bertans really finessed the wizards outta 80 million lmao
"Wiz fans, yal need Bertans and Len off your damn team. Rui and Bryant/Gafford are your path to salvation in the frontcourt, and you're gonna need to prepare for life after Russ and (possibly) Beal.   So how about I propose a trade?  Smart (even tho we love him) is going to be expiring after another year and hard to retain. TT is basically our Len. Grant is a much better defender and on a rookie contract for the next 2+ years with bird rights.   Bertans &amp; RoLo for Smart, Grant &amp; TT?    *Russ*, Smart, Deni, Rui, Bryant   (Ish, Garrison, Hutchison, Grant, Gafford)  This frees you up to either move Beal or (if possible) Westbrook and only have to figure out one backcourt position at a time. You add 2-3 great defenders for less than you're paying Davis.    Kemba, Brown, Fournier, Tatum, Rob   (Pritchard, Romeo, Nesmith, Bertans, RoLo)   We get a 6'10 stretch 4 we can hide on our bench and add a true C who can keep Rob fresh for the playoffs."
"There was a time when Celtics fans wanted Davis Bertans.   Now we just laugh as he chokes so hard, Nesmith has to give him a tracheotomy."
"Hence why I said they do it if it's a SERIOUS INJURY. Davis bertans' was not serious. It LOOKED serious but then he jogged back just fines for defense then fouled Tatum. Like have refs ever stopped the play when LeBron is doing one of his famous ""ouch I'm super hurt pay attention to me"" plays after every lay up?"
If Bertans was Anthony Davis they would have stopped the whole game until he felt better.
"I mean even if he didn't want to leave Rui out with 4 fouls to start the 3rd he could've rotated Hutchinson and given Gill minutes (who has the size) just so you try to get physical with Tatum, make him work harder for his points.  But then your lineup is 3 guards over whom Tatum can shoot with no trouble (I would've said if he gotten the switch on any of them but he didn't have to cus his main defender was Beal, who had to give up lots of energy on defense defending Jayson) and Bertans and Len who have the size but are nowhere near capable of defending Tatum, especially Bertans who is a total negative on the defensive end, he should've switched his minutes with Garrison Matthews or Hutchinson but then again no plays were ran for Davis so...  I am by no means an expert in basketball coaching, but somebody please explains to me Scott Brooks approach to this game"
"dude, 17 of those 32 free throws went to Tatum, it's not the refs' fault you guys were trying to defend him with Davis Bertans and an injured Brad Beal"
"[In support of the points you made..](https://twitter.com/FredKatz/status/1379262215820357632?s=20)  &gt;Russell Westbrook on the key to getting Garrison Mathews and Davis Bertans more shots throughout the game: **""I don't know…We're not running around trying to get them open shots, so whenever they get their shots, they get them and then they'll shoot them.""**"
"No chance lol, all of that is gone now with their current playstyle. Here's an actual quote regarding that exact issue:  &gt;Russell Westbrook on the key to getting Garrison Mathews and Davis Bertans more shots throughout the game: **""I don't know…We're not running around trying to get them open shots, so whenever they get their shots, they get them and then they'll shoot them.""**  [https://twitter.com/FredKatz/status/1379262215820357632](https://twitter.com/FredKatz/status/1379262215820357632)  (I am holding out hope the offense can be better next year with Thomas Bryant back as a DHO big man, and a new coach)"
"I mean, you can survive 118 if you're also going nuclear with an offense-first team like the Wizards are supposed to be, they just couldn't fucking score either.  Davis Bertans is paid $15m a year to do nothing except shoot 3s and he went 0-7 lmao."
Davis Bertans of Washington went 0-7 tonight as well
Davis Bertans tried his hardest to break it
watching davis bertans?
"Davis has never been a good post season player, I know that Duncan Robinson played in the bubble last year so his shooting might have been magnified but I don’t think their situations are 100% the same. Duncan is an even better off-ball player, and a better mover. Even with Leonard, DeRozan, and Aldridge to take pressure off Bertans pop had to bench him because he just didn’t show up."
Davis Bertans is not a basketball god.
Davis Bertans was 0-7 from three after signing a 5 year/80 million dollar contract this past offseason. His only job was to hit threes and he was 0-7. He had more personal fouls than points from three.   He can walk home. Respectfully.
"[What a night in Washington](http://i.imgur.com/QEz7W9U.jpg)  [Also, Davis Bertans bro....](https://streamable.com/us9r2)"
Davis Bertans be getting bitched in the paint every game it seem like
Davis Bertans working on a Tony Snell. Zeros across the board
Celtics injuries are really unfortunate but I just can't get over how bad Davis Bertans is
Duncan Robinson is gonna be Davis Bertans once he gets his over or near 20 million a year.
I’m gonna need Russ to stop passing the ball to that bum Davis Bertans
"I'd give Westbrook All-NBA before Beal. Beal's a great player, but I don't think it's a coincidence that the Wizards started winning when Russ got healthy and flipped the triple-double switch. To me, Russ' playmaking has done more to get the Wizards' other players involved than Beal's scoring. Players like Daniel Gafford, Davis Bertans, Robin Lopez, Garrison Matthews (when he plays) all noticeably got better with Russ playing well. Beal's the Klay Thompson of this team, but Russ is the Steph Curry."
"Imagine what Chuck Daly could've done with Aron Baynes, Davis Bertans, Tiago Splitter, Fabricio Oberto, Rasho Nesterovic, Jakob Poeltl."
"Davis Bertans I watched that game yesterday and man does nothing besides shoot 3s he literally has no skill besides that. Cant dribble, defend, rebound, nothing besides that."
Don't you know? Davis Bertans is actually mass murderer Hans Klopek
"David Bertans, Davis' evil, flagrant-foul-committing alter ego"
"RAPTOR is by far the worst stat in the NBA today that gets thrown around like it means something. There is a specific mold of player that they look for and they punish anyone who doesn’t fit into that paradigm. There is no doubt that Russ is a player who has a style that runs counter to the basketball mainstream. Same thing with Derozan. Unfortunately they are punished for it by this metric because they will rank a player like Davis Bertans, who I’m sure he would even admit is having a down year, higher than Westbrook. 538 gave it the good old fashioned try but their attempt sucks pretty bad. I’m glad I’m not the only person who thinks this about RAPTOR."
I’m a wizards fan. Die hard. But Davis Bertans 3 point shooting fouls are bullshit. I still can’t believe he’s them called
