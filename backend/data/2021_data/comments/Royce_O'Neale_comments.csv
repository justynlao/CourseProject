"Shoutout to Royce O'Neale, he's having a real solid year"
Royce O'Neale ladies and gentlemen
"Conley isn't the same player he was last year, he's much more adjusted to the offense and his role. He looks like the Mike Conley we wanted to trade for in the first place  Bogdanovic is back and finally rolling coming back from wrist surgery, which held him out in the playoffs. He was a 20 PPG scorer last year  Favors has returned and looks great, especially defensively. He's been a big reason as to why our bench unit is so much more successful than last year when we were throwing out Tony Bradley and the corpse of Ed Davis whenever Gobert was sitting or injured  Royce O'Neale keeps steadily improving  Jordan Clarkson looks even better than he did for us last season after we traded for him"
Haha Mike Conley washed  Bojan Bogdanovic? More like Bojan.. uh.. BetterStartHittingQuick lmao  Jordan Clarkson? Loser who is a loser with ugly tattoos  Joe Ingles has been jingled  Royce O'Neale wants to be Shaq so bad he changed his last name
"You can't look at just raw stats dude.  I watched those Jazz teams, shit, Stockton sent the Jazz to the NBA Finals during my High School Graduation.  The starters for the 97 team would jump out on the current team, but dude go look at the bench those Finals teams had. There's nobody there that's going to really slow down Jordan Clarkson and guys like Joe Ingles tended to exploit them (Eddie Johnson and Vernon Maxwell often would magically get hot against Utah) and Sloan's schemes tended to leave shooters open--- Snyder's system generates the most open looks in the league.  Stockton and Malone are far better than anyone on the current roster is, but Hornacek isn't better than Conley, Mitchell, Gobert, Bojan, or maybe even Clarkson. Bryon Russell would be the 90's teams 4th best player and he's about the Royce O'Neale/Ingles tier who is solid but you'd have 6-7 players from the modern team that are as good or better than the 97's 4th best guy."
Okur's best shooting season from 3 was 45% on 3 attempts per game.  Okur's closest comparison this year is Royce O'Neale (44% on 4 attempts per game)  That's kinda wild tbh.
Conley playing like everybody thought he was supposed to. Clarkson taking better shots. Royce O'Neale turning into PJ Tucker but a better rebounder and shooter.
I just wanna say Royce O'Neale is a goddamn national treasure. He's 0-4 on FG and still leads the team on +/- with 21
Anyone else think that Royce O'Neale looks like Paul George drawn with a crayon?
"I was never comparing Royce O'Neale, only taking your statement of Paul George playing exceptionally well as some indication of why the Clippers are better than Utah."
"You are aware we are comparing him to career average 5.7 PPG Royce O'Neale and not James Worthy, right?"
"That was 3 years ago and I think the Jazz consider Royce O'Neale as their wing stopper, the problem is he's 6'4"" and guys like LeBron or Kawhi can just shoot over him."
"Royce O'Neale and Bojan Bogdanovic are our forwards. Obviously, Green isn't starting over Rudy. You could, maybe, make a case to start Green over Royce, but I wouldn't do it."
"Oh he certainly has, but he isn't asked to be Royce O'Neale out there, just be solid and don't give up an easy basket, but he's going harder than that."
If Rolls Royce O'Neale scores 9 points or more beers on me!  ^^I ^^really ^^shouldn't ^^make ^^bets  ^^after  ^^5  ^^beers  ^^&gt;.&lt;
"Yeah, we can just rely on our actual superstar, Royce O'Neale"
"Utah has 4 guys who can consistently drop 20+ a game, a DPOY and good pieces like Joe Ingles, Royce O'Neale who have been shooting 40% from deep.  The Warriors have no real bench. Utah can go 7 deep with starting caliber players."
"Royce O'Neale is extremely good at stopping a fast break. Like easily the best in the league good.  The amount of times he has stopped an easy bucket, deflected the ball or straight up stole the ball is incredible."
Trade scraps for defensive players in the Stanley Johnson/Royce O'Neale/Torrey Craig mold.
Shaquille Harrison is the only Shaq I recognize. Royce O'Neale is the only O'Neal I recognize.
Great work as always. I'd love to see an exanded list. I'd bet Royce O'Neale is high on it.
"And we have Clarkson in the sixth-man spot instead of O'Neale, Ingles, or Crowder. He has a much higher scoring ceiling each night than all three. Royce is much more better in the starting lineup and Ingles is best served playmaking off the bench and getting looks for others as opposed to scoring himself"
Maybe Royce O'Neale?
"5 players are the same in both lists -  Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Derrick White.  There are precisely 3 SF's (who aren't mixed-SG/SF-wings) in each of the lists:  1. Dorian Finney-Smith, Mikal Bridges, Royce O'Neale 2. Aaron Gordon, Mikal Bridges, Trevor Ariza  Hardly a big difference, especially with half of the lists overlapping. And these are the players in 2019-20 who guarded [Lillard](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203081/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) (1.) the greatest number of minutes and who guarded [Luka](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629029/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) the greatest number of minutes (2.).  This is also far from your claim that ""he's \[Luka\] almost always got a SF on him"". Indeed no more than Dame does.  \-----------------  Looking at the reverse scenario, who Lillard and Luka guard, it's a similar story. Of their respective top-15 defensive assignments in 2019-20, Cory Joseph, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges and Will Barton -- five players -- appear on both lists, despite differences in numbers of games played against different teams and injury absences. A further four players couldn't appear on both lists as they were teammates of one of them. Both players guard a very similar profile of players - relatively weak perimeter offensive players, a number of whom spend a lot of time spotting up in the corner. That's what high-usage PGs who are not great defenders do, that's usually their assignment, because this way they don't accumulate defensive fouls (foul trouble would limit offensive production of the whole team) and it allows them to rest on defence while a more competent perimeter defender chases the opposing PG around screens.  You can read much more on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k75cyg/is_this_an_accurate_list_of_the_consensus_top_5/gep0mjf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  \----------------  In short, neither of your defence-based arguments is particularly well backed by data. And as long as [Rick Carlisle says](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28115706/how-rick-carlisle-learned-stop-worrying-love-luka-doncic) Luka's his PG, he's a PG."
When Royce O'Neale goes 6/8 from 3 you know it's your night
Royce o'neale tripping over the ref makes this highlight even better
Ref takes out Royce O'Neale
Utah:  Mitchell  Gobert  Bojan  Royce O'Neale  Ingles  Clarkson  Favors  Azubuike  Note: Conley doesn't need to be protected as he'll be a FA. They can just re-sign him after the expansion draft.
Royce O'Neale helping the Jazz save face in the 2nd.
"Royce O'Neale is such a bad defender. The Jazz always have him guard the opposing team's best player and he gets COOKED each and every game. Whenever you point this out, jazz fans (huge homers) get super offended."
"I don't think most Jazz fans would have an issue with the call if it were called evenly on both ends. Philly absolutely was allowed to play more physical defensively than the Jazz were in the 4th quarter and overtime. Embiid had a similar play where he pushed on Gobert mid-air that was a no call, Ingles and Mitchell both got called for ghost offensive fouls but Embiid and Simmons both were allowed to lower their shoulders and plow into Jazz players all night with identical contact and get away with it. Early in the 4th quarter Conley got fouled on two straight possessions that both went uncalled. Add in the attempted Royce O'Neale save the refs overturned (that should have led to a Mitchell dunk and a 6 point lead with 30 seconds left) and you can understand why the team reacted. If it were one call, the whole team wouldn't respond this way. It is because of largely imbalanced and inconsistent officiating for 17 minutes straight that caused the Jazz to boil over."
"I can only find the pool report info on the Royce O'Neale OOB (so either nobody asked about the Mitchell ejection, I can't find it, or they didn't post it), and it looks like the L2M report isn't up yet"

"royce o'neale caught a pass out of bounds and it was ruled 76ers ball after the pass hit a ref which led to an embiid game tying 3  up to that point the jazz had some crazy stat like 20 3pt makes, making every 3 they shot so we obviously ended regulation with more fts  if my memory serves me right mitchell opened up ot by jumping into a defender on a 3pt attempt, getting 3 at the line. later on in ot there was an offensive foul called on mitchell and after that embiid was fouled by gobert on a putback which led to him getting ejected"
"&gt; Royce O'Neale saving the ball from OOB, gets called for OOB, Sixers ball.

So they made the correct call by the rules.   &gt; Mitchell in the early part of OT got hooked by Simmons and tried to hit him with a spin-move into a layup to get the call (since you can't hook the arm of the guy you're defending), they called him for an offensive foul, then a T  Mitchell hooked Simmons, the replays clearly showed this.   &gt; Rudy Gobert defending Joel Embiid, Embiid puts up a shot, gets his own rebound, puts up another, gets his own rebound, then falls over and they called a push on Gobert. Gobert didn't push him. He was hardly even touching Jojo when he went up.  He's elbowing him in the side as Embiid goes up, this is a foul every day of the week and is the reason Embiid misses the dunk.   &gt; the Mitchell ejection which was the byproduct of a sequence of really bad calls on the part of the refs.  All the above called were correct, he was frustrated because Simmons locked him up and he shot his team out of this game."

"Ben Simmons, Dort, Giannis, Myles Turner, Gobert  Jrue Holiday, Royce O'Neale &amp; OG Anunoby should be on the 2nd team"
Wow fuck Royce O'Neale I guess lol he must've slept with the ref's wife or something
I mean shit look at the defensive help Rudy has. Royce O'Neale is really the only other positive defender on the court most of the times and the Jazz still have one of the best defenses in the league year in and year out
[Royce O'neale begs to differ.](https://twitter.com/DLocke09/status/1363957119892951042?s=19)
Royce O'Neale doesn't get talked about enough tbh
"literally everything is better for them this year than it was last year  in terms of what changed on paper, healthy bojan, conley has adjusted to the system, favors is our backup centre now instead of tony bradley, and players like royce o'neale and joe ingles are even more willing to to shoot the three than they were before.  you can also point to some smaller improvements like mitchell is a more willing passer (even if his assist numbers aren't noticeably higher), gobert is putting in his best season ever defensively, clarkson has cleaned up his shot selection and is an actual human torch, georges niang is not a negative on defence anymore, snyder's rotations are a lot tighter and more effective as well"
"Let's not Royce O'Neale winning Rookie of the Year. I know he's in his 4th season, but c'mon, he's got ""ROY"" right in his name!"
"i'm curious as to why you think that? no one on the jazz is significantly out-performing their career averages when it comes to shooting, which is without a doubt their greatest weapon, outside of maybe jordan clarkson and royce o'neale. compare that to someone like marcus morris for the clippers who is shooting a whopping 9% better from three than his previous best, or paul george who's shooting 7% better than at any other season"
"Royce ""6/6/6"" O'Neale"
"Gobert poses problems for Harden at the rim/in floater range, but Royce O'Neale is too small to guard KD, so both KD and Kyrie should get their shots off pretty well in the mid range era.  On the other end Gobert not being a real threat in iso allows the Nets to start small and switch everything, which forces Mitchell, Clarkson and co to create one on one, Mitchell could target Kyrie or Harden one on one (KD lenght is a problem and both Brown and Green are solid).  Actually think with Gobert on one end and the switchin on the other end this wouldn't be quite the offensive explosion that we would expect"
"Shoutout Royce O'Neale, dude was clamping tonight"
Royce O'Neale
I kind of feel like Royce O'Neale should start showing up for consideration on some of these lists. He's a load.
"We're averaging the most 3 pointers per game by any team in NBA history and our rotation players, minus the big men, just shoot an insanely efficient clip on high volume. I'll repost this table from another comment, that's accurate as of the completion of tonights game.     |Player|G|3P|3PA|3P%| :--|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Joe Ingles|27|68|147|**46.26%**| |Royce O'Neale|31|53|126|**42.06%**| |Mike Conley|25|70|170|**41.18%**| |Bojan Bogdanović|31|78|200|**39.00%**| |Donovan Mitchell|29|98|252|**38.89%**| |Jordan Clarkson|31|100|263|**38.02%**| |Georges Niang|31|37|101|**36.63%**|"
"We've got shooters everywhere that it's kinda ridiculous that Niang is only the 7th best shooter (by % this year even tho he's at 41.0% and 40.0% the last two seasons) in our rotation, apart from Gobert and Favors.      |Player|G|3P|3PA|3P%| :--|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Joe Ingles|27|68|147|**46.26%**| |Royce O'Neale|31|53|126|**42.06%**| |Mike Conley|25|70|170|**41.18%**| |Bojan Bogdanović|31|78|200|**39.00%**| |Donovan Mitchell|29|98|252|**38.89%**| |Jordan Clarkson|31|100|263|**38.02%**| |Georges Niang|31|37|101|**36.63%**|"
"Gobert, Embiid, Beverly, Royce O'Neale, Kawai"
"Royce O'Neale &gt; Greene. Don't at me, fools."
Royce O'Neale woke up feeling hot tonight.
"Supposedly Royce O'Neale called his Mom about it after a shoot around practice his first year in the league.  ""There's...uhh, immense pressure to thwart the shot.  Perform."" 😬  Lol feel bad for the guy, expected to guard wings four inches taller on the reg.  Quin don't care."
"Right now? Batum is playing really good defense and hitting 45% of his threes. (Frankly, I cannot believe how much better he looks this year)  Middleton has always been one of those guys.   Royce O'Neale is one of those guys.   KCP  Justin Holiday.   Mikal Bridges  Slowmo Anderson.   Devin Vassell is going to be that guy.  There's plenty of guys who are both a significant plus on defense that can also hit threes at a pretty solid clip.   Gary Trent's defense is not on that level yet."
Royce O'Neale has really stepped up his game this year.
"I mean partially you're right - Mitchell is having a career year from 3p range (in large part due to the fact that he's taking more catch and shoot 3s), but the real standouts for this team are   1. Our guys are more aggressively taking their shots - in the past, Bogey, O'Neale, and *especially* Ingles would inexplicably pass up wide-open 3pt shots to keep the blender running. Now that we're shooting more 3s and the chucking spirit of the Filipino Deity of Love and Vengeance has started to possess our roster, they're really letting them fly from distance.  2. Defense. Royce and Rudy are awesome, but our bench minutes with Bradley on the floor last year were *atrocious* for an NBA team on the defensive end, and now we've upgraded to Derrick Favors, arguably a top-15 center and one of the best rim-protecting bigs in basketball. Niang has also stepped up in a big way, and Conley has really gotten back into form as a premier defensive guard (or as good as you can be while only standing at about 6' tall).  3. Speaking of, Conley has had a wonderful bounceback season so far. Efficiency is way up from last year, his floater is falling, the three ball is dropping, he's running the offense, and he's clicking with Gobert. All that plus Quin's rotations have moved Mitchell to the second unit where Conley was playing a lot of his minutes last year, and now Conley is finally in a great position to succeed.  There are lots of schematic adjustments and improvements in places other than shooting where Utah has improved this year that account for the more aggressive, higher tempo team we're seeing compared to 19-20. It's not just more 3s on a better rate, although that definitely matters."
* Clarkson takes 3s instead of 2s. MF also plays defense now.  * Mitchell is a better passer and has better vision. Improved on Defense.  * Mike Conley understands the system. Better on Defense this season.  * Bojan is healthy.   * Joe Ingles is resurgent.   * Derrick Favors is the backup C instead of Tony Bradley (when Utah would hemorrhage points on the bench).  * Royce O'Neale decided he wanted to be a rebounding god and added elite rebounding to his top shelf 3&amp;D skillset.
"I've been harping on this for about three days now (and it will continue), but we are not well-equipped, personnel-wise, to deal with strong, quick, and tall dudes with passing skill. We do fairly well against Giannis, but LeBron, Simmons, Sabonis, and others consistently do well against us. Simmons backing down Bojan was BBQ chicken, despite Bojan's best efforts. Putting Gobert on them is okay, but then we get beat by their other big. Lineups with Faves and no O'Neale meant that Simmons/Howard got anything they wanted inside. Royce was easily the best defender on Simmons, sans Gobert, but Simmons was still successful fairly frequently.  Luckily, the 76er defense was sufficiently exploitable. I noticed we were going at Seth Curry and Korkmaz when we could."
"Royce O'Neale was clamping on everybody, underrated."
"The Jazz are another great example of this. They have the best record in the league and currently have 7 players averaging over 20 minutes a game. Of those 7 players, 5 of them are:  - Rudy Gobert - Drafted 27th overall - Bojan Bogdanovic - Drafted 31st overall - Jordan Clarkson - Drafted 46th overall - Joe Ingles - Undrafted - Royce O'Neale - Undrafted  The only players on the roster drafted higher than 27th overall are Conley, Favors, and Mitchell. Granted, some of those players like Bogie and Clarkson were well-established with other teams before joining the Jazz but I think it's cool to see a team doing so well that is mostly comprised of late-round/undrafted guys"
"This is what turns a team into a true contender. You need your stars of  course but you also need the role players like Royce O'Neale, Jingles or Jordan Clarkson to play well. I really hope the Jazz can keep this up come playoffs."
Hot take - It's 2021 and Royce O'Neale is a better player than Draymond Greene
I once saw Royce O'Neale at Chipotle. That's the end of the story but damn this dude is an underrated three and D glue guy.
Royce O'Neale with Kirilenko numbers.
Go look at last year how many players had career highs on us when they were being guarded by Royce O'Neale.
"Why did I say ""pump the brakes* on your ""Royce O'neale is a DPOY candidate"" take?  I legit feel like I shouldn't justify your comment with a response"
He's replacing Mike Conley!  As an outsider though Royce O'Neale would probably be the one you'd not realize starts 'over' Joe
Royce O'Neale with the 0 pts 10 reb Rodman line
You just lost to Royce O'Neale
"Bojan Bogdanovic, Joe Ingles, Royce O'Neale, and Georges Niang are all like that for Utah as well.  Mike Conley is pretty close to making it too, lol.  Still totally crazy for someone like Steph, though.  His offensive load is huge for Golden State."
"That's something that can be said about the 29 teams who don't have LeBron. Definitely not a match-up specific to the Jazz. He is simply that good.  However the least bad solution is to have a decent perimeter defender (Royce O'Neale for the Jazz) and defend collectively, which is something the Jazz is quite good at for the moment."
"Royce O'Neale, bb"
"Underrated: Rudy Gobert and Royce O'Neale.   Gobert's offensive numbers are down across the board, but he's still arguably our team MVP and the difference between him and every other player in the league defensively is as massive as it's ever been.  O'Neale is known for being a 3-and-D guy, which he is doing very well at this year. He has also added a playmaking element to his game. He's more comfortable putting the ball on the floor and making difficult passes. The next step in his game is creating his own shot, which he has shown signs of improvement on so far this season.  Overrated: Honestly, nobody. Our only rotation player that's struggling is Niang, and I don't think anyone has expectations for a 9th man. Even then, he's improved defensively."
"Royce O'neale is a bad motherfucker!  If u don't know, u better find out!"
"And something that's been mentioned but not emphasized is the effect on our rebounding. Our next best rebounder in most lineups containing Gobert is 6'4"" Royce O'Neale. Not a knock on Royce, but we've got Jingles, Bojan, and Niang as our forwards and none of them really get or fight for that many of them. Perks of having undersized guards and unathletic forwards, I guess."
"Bam Can easily guard 1/5, that only has value on a team that can switch most actions, Gobert can make an elite offense off a team that has exactly one other guy that's well above average defensively (Royce O'Neale).  That + Gobert is way better at getting out of the paint than some give him credit for is he Bam  ? No, but let's not act like he's Whiteside either"
Its kinda funny that i found multiple Royce O'Neale jerseys on fanatics.com (not sure if they are legit) but not the Schröder jersey that im looking for xD
"To be fair the ball movement was dead all game and I think Phoenix's physical defense had a lot to do with that. They didn't give our shooters any room and were excellent staying disciplined when collapsing on the drive so it wasn't easy to kick to a shooter. Royce O'Neale and Joe Ingles only had 7 total shots combined, that's a lot to do with how the Suns defended us."
Royce O'Neale until his recent slump
"Depending on the definition you are using  Not an all-star: Brodgon, CJ, Grant, T. Harris, Draymond Green  Good Starter: Lonzo,J Harris, Wiggins, Royce O'Neale, Ayton, AG  Low Level starter/6th Man:Jordan Clarkson, Fournier, Donte Divencenzo, PJ Tucker, Jonas Valancunas  I think overall this is a pretty solid list of guys who could be considered role players or not."
Royce O'Neale
Royce O'Neale needs the bootum special
"Joe Ingles was cut by the clippers and now leads the league in true shooting, and is Paul George's father. Royce O'neale was undrafted and joined the Jazz at age 26. He's now a starter."
"Online leagues are your friend, friend  I traded Bojan for Draymond and some of the lineups are juicy. I ran an Ingles, Clarkson, Matt Thomas, Royce O'Neale, Draymond lineup for some stretches and it absolutely shreds"
"Royce O'Neale: ""Speaking of clips, when I need to clip my beard, I reach for my Dollar Shave Club starter kit!"""

1. Rudy Gobert  2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Mike Conley  4. Joe Ingles  5. Jordan Clarkson  6. Bojan Bogdanovic  7. Royce O'neale  8. Georges Niang  9. Miye Oni  10. Matt Thomas or Ersan Ilyasova?
The Jazz's most legit wing is Royce O'Neale. That's a problem.
"A big part of the Jazz's success is our team chemistry. Mitchell's friendship with Royce has contributed to O'Neale becoming a better player and he's a major part of our team. Would any of those other players be just as supportive and helping as Mitchell is? Would we still have O'Neale?  Mitchell does play too much hero ball at times, but I rarely ever hear somebody complain about it when it works. He has the green light and the trust of the coaching staff and our team to be the hero."
" Just to see what the results would be, I checked this websites advanced defensive metric to see what each would score and how they stack up. (For reference Gobert is top of the league with +4.32 and Anfernee Simons is bottom of the league with -2.71)  1) Lu Dort   \-1.03  2) Dillon Brooks   \+0.57  3) Gary Harris   \-0.49  4) Mikal Bridges   \+0.39  5) Royce O'Neale   \+1.11  6) Lonzo Ball   \-0.68  7) Pat Beverley   \+1.70  8) Cam Reddish   \-0.56  9) Derrick Jones Jr.   \+0.68  10) Josh Okogie   \+0.17"
Gobert allows the Jazz to also field all shooters around him with the only great defender on the team outside him being Royce O'Neale. He also allows the Jazz to allow the least amount of 3s in the league by allowing our perimeter guys to overplay the 3. So he takes away the two best shots in basketball. There's a reason he'll be below Gobert and Simmons and probably Embiid too in the DPOY vote
"Well, that's when you it Royce O'Neale in, he could do a good job imo"
"&gt; Royce O'Neale   turns 28 this season, so maybe not quite as long as you think."
"Royce O'Neale is a great answer to this. Plays great defense, is becoming a good rebounder, has a 3 point shot, hustles his butt off. He'll be around for a long time."
"PG: Damian Lillard  SG: Royce O'Neale  SF: Mikal Bridges  PF: Ben Simmons  C: Nicola Vucevic   Is this a championship contender? It's an odd ""Big-3"" of Dame/Ben/Vooch, but Vooch provides spacing for Ben to work in the interior. Dame and Vooch aren't the best defenders but you're surrounding them with two 3&amp;D guys and one of the best defenders in the league right now."
I swear last time the Jazz were playing the sixers they put Simmons on Royce O'Neale instead of Donovan.     Makes sense.
Nah don't think I wanna see Steph deal with Royce O'Neale for 7 games
Royce O'Neale brain freeze or Steph duke step wahtevertheycallit is just fire?
"And according to the Warriors announcers, Royce O'Neale is gonna be right there bodying Steph as it happens."
"""Royce O'Neale has defended Steph better than anyone this year""  Yeah... Because the secondary defender is shading well enough to give him time to recover every time. Defending Steph is a team effort yo"
"Here's some remarks on probably the most unremarkable game of the NBA season (or NBA history, you decide). But hey, I wrote all this shit down so I figured I'd share:  * Early on when Rudy is in the action on D he's comfortable straying away from Poeltl to contest shots. First possession he alters an elbow jumper from Vassell then next possession he leaves Jake Puddle to contest Keldon Johnson's layup. This Spurs bunch doesn't have great passing so they're not looking for JP on lobs or quick interior passes to punish Gobert * CAVEAT TO THE ABOVE POINT: two straight possessions the Jazz guard the Murray/JP PnR with two guys; Gobert stunts to Murray both times and Murray finds JP for two buckets * Trent Forrest Good: puts Vassell in jail on the PnR and hits a nice floater. Trent Forrest Bad: leaves his feet contesting a pretty weak Murray pump fake (on replay Murray may have even been looking to pass?) and fouls the shit out of him. Trent Forrest Good: slips by Murray in screen-the-screener action that Quin loves and gets a wide open dunk (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""That's a big time NBA move."" Uhh, no Craig, the Spurs fucked up the coverage and were all yelling at each other after the play) * Wooofff Rudy Gay just got flat-footed by Bojan on an iso and beat to the rim. Bojan isn't De'Aaron Fox, folks. Maybe it's legs because the Spurs have had a hellacious schedule but that looked pretty bad * Spurs get a couple buckets in the first with Lonnie Walker going at Clarkson. The Jazz need JC in the playoffs but he's going to get attacked, he's dying on every screen (even small/small screens). At least JC is hitting the floater though, 5/6 early for 12 1st quarter points * Dieng is getting cooked in PnR. Like Jordan Clarkson [cooking a grilled cheese cooked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nreFpbJXt30). He gives up a wide open lane to Ingles off a Gobert screen then on a Forrest/Gobert PnR he doubles Forrest (???) and it's an easy lob to Gobert. He's -14 in 6 minutes. Jazz up 22. Cue Drew Eubanks * Oni kinda looks like a guy who can be a good on-ball defender but he's not particularly quick or long or strong or cerebral. Granted he's usually guarding some of the bigger threats. And on offense he'll hit the open corner three and get some offensive rebounds but that's basically it. If he doesn't add something to his game this summer I don't see him sticking. He's like Royce but slightly worse at everything * Pop may be throwing in the towel a bit early tonight? Poeltl hasn't been in since his first stint, logging just seven first half minutes. After going down 22 they're running with Walker/Eubanks/Tre Jones/Bates-Diop/Samanic to close the 2nd quarter. That is, uhh, not an inspiring group. But I don't blame him, the Spurs have been ahead of the game with resting players and I'm sure Pop is trying to save his guys for winnable games and the play-in * Let's talk about Joe Ingles. He's running the point when he's out there w/ Conley/Mitchell out. Everyone says he's ""crafty"" which is kinda just a bullshit lazy white-guy characterization. To me crafty means you have multiple moves, countermoves, variations on those countermoves. LaMelo Ball is crafty, Ja Morant is crafty, Luka Doncic is crafty. Joe has exactly two moves in the PnR: (1) drive left, pass fake and shoot (2) drive left and dump off pass to Gobert/Favors. He's just **really** good at those two moves. Which is hilarious because, as someone who watches the Jazz all the time, you see it coming from a mile away. But Joe times that pass or pass fake so perfectly that it works more often than not * Jazz up 24 at the half. Bojan leading the way with 19 points on 8/9 from the field and getting to the rim at ease against this not-your-father's-Spurs Defense * Addendum to Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: (3) a third defender comes over in the PnR to tag Gobert and Joe whips a lefty pass to the corner for a Bojan three * Watching Royce O'Neale is kinda hilarious because he makes like four buckets a game but he celebrates each one like a cocky eighth grader. He finishes on Poeltl with an admittedly nice lefty scoop shot and looks at his hand as he runs back, then makes a WIDE open three and points to the corner camera while backpedaling. But hey, if you play a thankless role guarding the best guys and being the fifth option on Offensive like O'Neale, go ahead and celebrate big guy * Self-Aggrandizing-Victory-Lap on Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: Joe does move (1) and gets an and-1 on Poeltl (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""CRAFTY!"") * All of the sudden the Jazz are up 36 midway through the third quarter and this game is over. Friendly reminder that there are too many games in the NBA season and to get your COVID Vaccine. Yours truly will now be tuning out and YouTubing Jordan Clarkson cooking grilled cheese"

"It's a great idea to bring up, but your criteria are too loose.  &gt; Average defender: this one is tougher to define because defense stats can be often misleading, so I'm gonna go by eye test and my general opinion while trying to be as unbiased as possible  Don't ever go by ""eye test"".  Just use Defensive RAPTOR from 538.  For my list I'll only include players with at least +1.0 rating (top 100 defensive players this year) with 500 minutes or more.  &gt; Above Average 3pt shooter: the player must be above ~35% 3pt% for the 2021 season, and attempt at least 3 3s a game on average  At least three 3s a game is good, but 35% is too low.  We're not looking for average shooters, we want good ones.  I'll use 37%.  These guys fit that criteria this year (in order of Def RAPTOR rating):  1. embiid 1. batum 1. crowder 1. christian wood 1. Gay 1. covington 1. melton 1. anunoby 1. p George 1. connaughton 1. muscala 1. randle 1. kleber 1. Green 1. jrue holiday 1. Leonard 1. royce o'neale 1. Finney-Smith 1. Korkmaz 1. Niang 1. Mikal Bridges  Considering that 5 of these players are making over $20 mil a year, it's hard to classify them as 3 and D players people would be talking of filling their roster to complete it, but theres still good names there.  Randle is the only questionable one on the list because this is the first year hes been good defensively and/or had a decent 3pt%.  But if he can turn around one, why not the other?  Christian wood is also someone people might scoff at, but this is his 2nd year in a row of a good defensive RAPTOR season and makes him 2 for 2 when he gets non-garbage minutes.  Additionally, here's a list of players who just missed the 3pt requirements (either in % or attempts):  1. campazzo (36.9%) 1. cam johnson (36%) 1. neto (2.6 attempts) 1. bazemore (2.5 attempts) 1. vanvleet (36.7%)  You're obviously still right there aren't many, but considering most people are thinking of a swingman (SG, SF, PF) for a 3nD player, it looks more like around 15 players (including those from the ""almosts"") aren't making tons of money and could be considered a swingman.  And the list would only get smaller if we limit to players with consistently good defensive seasons or 3pt numbers."

"If I'm being realistic, yeah I'm very worried. A vast majority of our wins this year have come against significantly injured teams. Bogdanovic and Clarkson have been shooting horribly for the majority of this season. Royce O'Neale has taken a step backwards on offense and defense. Rudy is great but inconsistent. Really our only bright spots are Mike's and Joe's general performance. Donovan has been decent, but inconsistent as always.  My honest take is that I'll be surprised if we get past the 2nd round. If teams are healthy, the Jazz will struggle hard."
Royce O'Neale spent more time defending All Star players in the league last year than anyone else.
"I remember Courtney Kirkland T'ing up Royce O'Neale for the little celebration he does after every single 3-pointer he hits, because he thought he was taunting an opponent. Soft af."
Royce O'Neale.  Outside of Gobert the Jazz defence is top 3 because of Royce.
"I think Royce O'Neale is better on wings than on guards actually so I'd be a bit more worried about how they handle guards, Paul and Booker for example.  I think O'Neale can do okay on Kawhi/Bron, they 'll get theirs, efficiently, but it won't be a ""hey you just have to double even if the guy is 20 feet away from the rim"", and Ingles can do okay on someone like PG.  I've seen a lot of people worried about their wing defense, IMO this is not the reason I wouldn't pick them in series against top teams"
"Royce O'Neale is a close-to-elite defender. He always defends the opposing team's best player—Giannis, Kawhi, etc. But the Jazz need 2 1-on-1 defenders to stop PG and Kawhi or LeBron and AD and they've only got the 1.  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=kawhi+leonard+vs+royce+o%27neale  Kawhi's FG% drops 8 percent (and 3P% drops almost 20%) vs Royce O'Neale/Jazz when Royce plays"

Royce O'Neale
David Locke  @DLocke09  ·  May 21  Interesting cross match up in Jazz v. Grizzlies. According to   @The_BBall_Index  Royce O'Neale guarded Tier 1 players the most of any player in the NBA   Dillion Brooks guarded Tier 1 players the 2nd most of any player in the NBA   O'Neale v. Ja Brooks v. Donovan     https://twitter.com/DLocke09/status/1395966169312415745?s=19
"Gobert is the focal piece of the Jazz defense, so you're definitely correct there.   But I would put Royce O'Neale and Mike Conley in the great to elite category, they've both been very good defensively this season. Gobert isn't the *only* defense"
So you agree with me that he wasn't on him in game 1.. sure doesn't seem wrong on that point. Ben covered him frequently in game 2. Well I didn't watch that game. So I didn't comment on that. So again how could I be blatantly wrong on something I never said? Shall we bring up Beal scoring 60? Where was this Simmons defender?   My point was Simmons doesn't always take the toughest assignment like some people like to claim. Royce O'Neale and Dillon Brooks had the most time of guarding the teams highest scorer in the nba this season. It's a shame that people don't recognize Simmons for what he is on defense. He's a very good defender capable of switching 1-5 and that makes him very versatile and he can do a lot of things that   others can't on the defensive side.   But these embellishments of him just go against him. Because it's simply not true that he guards the best scorer for most the game. And when Thybulle is in the game Ben is the 2nd best perimeter on his team. But that's not a shot at Ben. Thybulle is just really good mostly because he can focus all his energy on the defensive side of the ball.
Royce O'Neale is slept on. He had a pretty good defensive season
&gt;finals MVP  HERE COMES ROYCE O'NEALE
"Generally the Jazz starting 5 would probably be Conley/Mitchell/O'Neale/Bogdanovic/Gobert.  So yeah Royce would probably be the worst of the starters, but even then he's a very good 3&amp;D player.  No idea if he'd be the best '5th man' in the league though."
All 4: Royce O'Neale
"50 passes per game list looks like pretty good company. ""PTs created"", pushes Ben up the rankings. What makes you think assist to pass percentage a good metric? 3 of the top 4 players by that metric are score first guards that dump the ball off when double teamed. James Harden gets ranked 10th by that sorting. It seems more indicative of play style than ""goodness"".    Trae Young  Russell Westbrook  Damian Lillard  Luka Doncic  Chris Paul  Mike Conley  Ja Morant  James Harden  Jrue Holiday  Ben Simmons  LeBron James  Marcus Smart  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Derrick Rose  Tobias Harris  Nikola Jokic  Dennis Schroder  Royce O'Neale"
"Royce O'Neale, at 6'4"", is unironically our second best rebounder. (Faves would be second, but he plays fewer minutes.)"
He plays above his size and then some.  Defending against elite (Clips literally have 2/5 of the league's) and even great wings is widely considered this Jazz squads only weakness-  but you'd never guess it after how hard 6'4 Royce O'Neale hustled tonight.
Royce O'Neale has guarded Kawhi as good as anyone in the NBA these past couple of years.
Royce O'Neale is a beast all season and still found another level to get to tonight. That man knows his role and knows how to use it to win games. Bogey played like a man possessed.
"When you have a DPOY candidate and generational defensive talent as the Jazz do in Rolls Royce Da 6'4"" O'Neale, all things are possible"
"Royce O'Neale has done a great job putting Kawhi out of his waters, preventing him from receiving the ball on his usual spots and forcing him to put a lot of effort to get rid of him."
Royce O'Neale will get nothing in the stat sheet but that was a great defensive play.
If royce O'Neale does not continue to be Klay Thompson after his series against the Grizz I will be very annoyed
"Clippers would have Kawhi/Luka so probably the two best players on the floor.  Utah would then have Donovan and Gobert  Clippers would have Paul George  Name a single Clipper who is better than the following list of players  Ja Morant  Mike Conley  Bojan Bogdanovic  Joe Ingles  Jeremy Clarkson  Derrick Favors  Royce O'Neale  Maybe the Clippers 4th best player is as good as Royce, but Utah would be WAAAAAAAY deeper.  It's not bias, its just Utah has a deeper squad and we'd be adding Ja in the mix in this hypothetical."
We just ignoring Rudy Gobert/Royce O'Neale and Joe Ingles as defenders?  The Jazz bench would be super deep dude. Luka/PG/Kawhi can't play 48 minutes a game.  And why are you acting like Rondo isn't a playmaker?
"That's because Royce O'Neale isn't a non-athletic math teacher, he's an elite defender."
"_Keeping the rest of the Jazz roster constant_, I would take Gobert over Luka, Harden, Jokic, Dame. I only take AD over Gobert if he's willing to sign in blood and promise to play center, and even then I'm not sure.  The whole point of Gobert is that the other 4 guys can be Conley / Mitchell / Ingles / Bogdanovic _and the defense will still be good_. If you replace Gobert with Luka and a buyout / minimum center, the offense will be better, but the Jazz offense through one round and in the regular season was basically on par with the Nets. There's only so good an offense can be.  And then you have to figure out how to make your defense work Luka, Mitchell, Favors, Royce O'Neale, and Bogdanovic (now Ingles has to come off the bench).  Luka / LeBron types are great because they can elevate weak offensive players like KCP, Caruso, Finney-Smith. If you have Gobert the defense is good enough that you don't have to, and you can build your title contender around a Bogdanovic type instead."
Conley's hamstring is a problem. Also I'm really interested to see how Royce O'Neale does against Kawhi and gobert against batum.
"on offense. their best wing defender is 6'4 Royce O'Neale, after that, it's mitchell. they just hope fatigue catch them."

"Bad shooting selection was the reason of why the Bucks were so bad from 3 tonight. They need to stop with those early 3s and start moving the ball a little bit more to find better looks. Playing so fast is leading them to many turnovers and the Nets are a team that can willingly punish them considering how good they are in transition. So, the first thing they need to do is to slow up the tempo.  They also have to capitalize the size difference and try to put the ball at the low post more oftenly. Playing Giannis as the screener would be a nice adjustment too considering how aggressively the Nets are defending the PnR with this ""up to touch"" coverage and their continuous helping. Having a good decision maker as your roll-man will force the weak side defenders to stick to their players.  As for the defensive part, if they want to continue doing that drop coverage with Brook Lopez, they need to put players with longer wingspan like Middleton and Giannis on the perimeter to contest these off-dribble 3s. Kinda like what Utah does with Mitchell and Royce O'Neale."

"If I remember correctly, Royce O'Neale spends more minutes guarding other teams' #1 options than any other player in the league. So he's definitely experienced at it. And he usually does a pretty good job."
Yeah - the Clippers have two of the best wings in the league who will feast on both Donovan Mitchell and Royce O'Neale who are pretty undersized.

Such disrespect leaving Royce O'Neale out 😤😤
Two of the best forwards of our generation: Giannis vs Royce O'Neale. Doesn't get any better than that. This is how the NBA Finals are meant to be played.
I thought Royce O'Neale would only be a top 10 SF in the league.  I terribly underestimated his greatness
Friendly reminder Royce O'Neale went undrafted
keep in mind royce o'neale guards 1-4 and gets 1/6 of ben's bag
has Royce O'Neale ever missed a shot in his life? fuck
sixers really paying $35m for a glorified royce o'neale that can't shoot   i'd rather have the royce that can shoot for $5m
or Royce O'Neale
"Yeah, people acted like it was some blowout, because they're filthy casuals. That was with that meme-worthy 'guard Harden from behind' defense that everyone clowned on. It actually fucking worked for the majority of the series, insanely.  Houston completely controlled the series, don't get me wrong, but Utah shot like 20% on a fuckton of wide open threes. Jae Crowder, Ricky Rubio, Royce O'Neale, and even Ingles and Mitchell were essentially ice cold.   Hence the last couple years of Utah moves. All offensive based, Conley, Clarkson, Bogdanovic, and adjusting to building even more of the defensive scheme around what Rudy brings to the table.   But Rudy was never played out of a series. It's not like Clint Capela was pulling him out of the paint, or like Harden was constantly getting Rudy on a switch. Wasn't happening like that."
I like Hubie a lot but let's not pretend like he never has any flubs. Just tonight he called Royce O'Neale the wrong name after a made basket and mixed up the team's uniform colors.  Neither were a huge deal and anyone talking nonstop for three hours is gonna have some flubs.
He did make a few mistakes. He called Royce O'Neale Derrick Favors once. And I counted 3 times that he said a player had the wrong number of fouls. Like he would say it was their first foul when it was their 2nd kind of thing. Not that bad compared to other commentators though.
"I think the Jazz are actually much more well-equipped to guard Luka or Kawhi than they are to guard Brooks or Morant, as goofy as that sounds. Royce O'Neale is their best perimeter defender, and he's not exceptionally good at running behind screens and his feet aren't the best. He's strong as hell though, great at absorbing bumps, and can defend guards and forwards really well in the post. The big problem guarding Ja is that when he tears off of screens, Jazz are trying to run him off the line and he goes right at Gobert, but because he's so insanely quick he can create enough separation that Gobert has to either come up to contest the floater, or stay back to prevent the layup because Ja's man is too far behind him to provide effective coverage.   That's way less of a problem with Luka or Kawhi because they're not nearly as explosive when running off of screeens and they are much more methodical players who rely a lot more on power than quickness.  This has been a consistent issue for the Jazz all season long - their worst matchups are against guards like Kyrie, Ja, Steph, and (as seen in the bubble last year) Jamal. Compared that to the times the Jazz play against bigger and stronger wings, they are much more well-equipped at the perimeter. I think that the Jazz are actually substantially more well-equipped to match up against the Clippers or the Mavericks, and that if both teams had equal talent and experience, stylistically the Grizzlies would be favored in this series. It's only the fact that the Jazz are older, wiser, and just flat-out better than the Grizzlies that they're winning these games."
"Sorry I can't clip the game for you. But the Royce O'Neale 3 FT play was _not_ a foul. The 3FT foul on Dillon in the second quarter was bullshit. No fucking contact, even the announcers called it out and wondered if Jenkins would challenge.. Grayson also didn't fucking touch Clarkson in the second half. That's off the top of my head."
&gt;\#2. Ja's been the best player in the series  Interesting way to spell 🚨🚨***ROYCE O'NEALE*** 🚨🚨
Royce O'Neale is the X-factor again
"I'll give you Royce O'Neale, some high quality bench dude, and a slew of picks."
"Ingles and Niang are not athletic one-on-one defenders like O'Neale (which is a concern), but they're both excellent team defenders that can successfully funnel ball handlers to bad spots. We also have Miye Oni, although I don't know if he will see minutes in the playoffs going forward.  When it comes to defending smalls, Conley at this point in his career is also ""just"" a team defender. Mitchell and Clarkson are bad defenders, and Royce is better against big wings than against point guards."
"Bojan's our 4th best guy on offense: he slumped for a lot of this year (and game 1 lol)but averaged 20ppg last season.   Royce O'Neale is a very good 3&amp;d guy, who I'm hoping gets some 3rd team all-d votes.   And then there's Jingles.   Team is super deep, very experienced, and pretty well coached."
is Royce O'neale one of Shaq's illegitimate sons  is that why he's got to put an extra E
Royce O'Neale commits 3 fouls per possession and they call nothing. Touch Donovan and they blow the whistle lmao
Steph really only had one chance (tonight) to do that. Royce O'Neale and Mitchell are good enough defenders to implement a similar scheme to what we used. Plus they're just the better team so it's not like they'd be pushed to OT by the Warriors reserves floundering
"""*Layups are hard.*"" - Royce O'Neale"
"Guys like Dorian Finney-Smith, Royce O'Neale and Mikal Bridges are going to be such X-Factors during this playoffs. Fantastic 3&amp;D players that allow their teams to space their floor with their fantastic 3 ball but also make an impact on defence."
"&gt; Not to mention defense isn't properly measured by defensive statistics, advanced or otherwise, so the people have little to fall back on.  Sometimes, but Gobert has a crazy statistical footprint. With Gobert on, the Jazz allow 103.8 points per 100 possessions, well better than the league-leading Lakers' 106.8. With Gobert off, the Jazz allow 116.2 points per 100, in the neighborhood of the league-worst Kings at 116.5. Royce O'Neale is probably the second-best defender on the Jazz, but [look how good they are with Gobert and no O'Neale](https://www.nba.com/stats/lineups/advanced/?CF=GROUP_NAME*E*gobert:GROUP_NAME*NE*O%27Neale&amp;sort=MIN&amp;dir=1).  Jazz front office basically stuffed the roster with offensive players and trusted Rudy to carry the whole thing on defense, and now they're the best team in the league. Man's a beast."
Sometimes they are Anthony Davis. Sometimes they are Royce O'Neale.
"TBH some of the best 3&amp;D role players in the league have been found outta nowhere. The Jazz already found one in Royce O'Neale. There's also guys like Jae Crowder, Dorian Finney-Smith, Danny Green, Josh Hart etc."
Overrated: Joe Ingles  Underrated: Royce O'neale  Oh shit its history uh Overrated is Carlos Boozer underrated Bryon Russell
"Too many other narratives going on right now.  But yeah, there needs to be some optics on the fact that Gobert is neutralized by a stretch center and the fact that Utah doesn't have great perimeter defense (their whole starting lineup is kind of undersized relative to their positions and Royce O'Neale especially isn't a guy I expect to clampdown another team's star 3)."
"I agree, a lot is made of Gobert's defense but the real problem is on the other end where he can't punish teams for going small against him.  If he had any post moves/better touch around the rim/better passing chops that would change things a lot.  I think Utah needs more versatility in general, not just at the 5.  Some different pieces that allow them to be more multiple, and especially a more reliable wing than Royce O'Neale would be really key (preferably a wing with more size, it's not realistic but think about how well OG Anunoby would fit in there).  Anything that allows them to be better at the point of attack (hard to do when neither Conley or Mitchell are healthy, both Clarkson &amp; Ingles have their limitations) would help a lot.  The Clippers punished the Jazz by kicking to the perimeter, but that's only possible because they were able to get into the lane at will."
"Gobert had a decent game, he just couldn't protect the perimeter which is not his job after. He is not a bad perimeter defender. In Game 1 he had this highlight when he blocked Marcus Morris game tying 3 and everyone praised him exactly for that. His -24 plus/minus happened because he played the entire second half when the Clippers made the 25pts comeback. He also had 10 rebounds of which 7 offensive and made 5/6 field goals. I think he is not to blame for the poor defense, because individually he is a great defender, but team defense depends on 4 other guys and the coach. The only other good defender on this team is Royce O'Neale."
"My observations:  &amp;#x200B;  1. Gobert has to help on PG, otherwise that's an easy lay up for PG. Donovan has to switch to the corner 3. He doesn't even make an effort to close out to T Mann. That's just poor effort from Donovan. He retreats out to Batum when he should have gone to the corner spot. That would have led to a pass to Batum, at which point Bojan has to rotate to Batum, which then would have led to a pass to Morris and Conley should rotate out to Morris. Finally, Morris would probably make the open pass to Reggie but at that point, O'Neale would have to rotate out to Reggie. By this time, there's probably 8-10 secs left on the clock and the ball wouldn't be moving as much. If you're the Jazz, this is 100% the better option as opposed to leaving Mann open at the corner 3 spot. Key thing here is rotation, rotation and rotation.  2. Again, Gobert comes to help. Nothing wrong with that. However, it's not on Gobert to close out to Mann. That's on Donovan again. You kind of have to split the difference between Mann and Batum, but the way Donovan is positioned, he's more concerned about Batum. Just look at all that space when Reggie makes the pass. Pay attention to when the ball bounces on the floor on the way to Mann's shooting pocket. Again, Donovan doesn't even try to close out to the corner shooter. Poor effort yet again. Gobert is in such a bad spot. If he closes out hard, he might foul Mann in the shooting motion.  3. Good defence by Gobert to start. I feel like Donovan should have taken another step closer to Batum and not be close to Reggie the moment Reggie passes to Batum. Batum is a smart player. He probably realized Donovan wouldn't contest the shot so he lets it fly. This is not on Gobert, this is on Donovan yet again. No effort for the third straight 3 pt shot with him being the closest defender each and every time. 4. Closest defender to Mann is Ingles, not Gobert. Ingles has to split the difference here, not be that close to Morris. Pause at the very moment Mann is just about to catch the ball and when he begins his shot wind up. Ingles is walking back. What kind of defence is this? How can you pin this on Gobert? Again, if he closes out too hard, he might foul Mann. This play is on Ingles. You have to split the difference here. By doing so, this allows O'Neale to swing to the wing spot to guard/contest Morris.  5. Same thing as 4. While Ingles did a better job at splitting the difference, he should have fully committed to contesting Mann's shot. O'Neale has to rotate out to Morris. Morris probably would have passed to PG up top at which point Conley would have to rotate out to PG. This would have left about 4-6 secs left on the clock. With Conley guarding PG, you take take any day (considering there would have been 4-6 secs left) over leaving a corner 3 shooter wide open. 6. Effort more so than anything. Clarkson has to close out faster than this. Either Clarkson fully commits to contesting the 3 by swinging right by him (not this half-assed close out) or he sprints fast enough and scares/stunts on Reggie and forces the Clippers to start the play all over again. Pause at the moment Reggie is in the shooting motion with the ball right over his head (right when the shot clock resets to 14). Look at how much space Reggie has. I don't even know what to say at this point. Everything I described so far leading up to point 6 comes down to two things: rotations and effort. Let's continue. 7. Hands up O'Neale, hands up!!! Pause at 4.9 secs left on the clock. Reggie is ready to let it fly. Ball in the shooting pocket and knees bent, all signs pointing to shooting the ball.   Come on O'Neale. He has to assume that Reggie is gonna shoot. Chances are, Reggie is not gonna drive right and run in to Gobert. He's waiting to shoot. Put your hands up Royce! 8. Gobert is a split second late. He was in the paint for a split second longer than he needed to be. He's way too flat footed here. He has to properly contest this shot. Jump high and contest the shot man, come on.  9. Donovan completely lost track of the corner man. Donovan retreats out to Luke and forgets Pat Bev is in the corner. You HAVE to split the difference in these situations. If Donovan properly closes out to Pat Bev, he would have passed to Luke and Bojan would have to split the difference/rotate out to Luke. Once again, Donovan's lack of awareness is on full display.  10. I feel like for the most part, Gobert has good positioning to contest PG's shot but again, he has to jump higher and have his hands raised high. His right hand is tilted downwards when it should be pointed up high. The goal here is to disrupt PG's vision on the shot attempt. Better/stronger close out was needed. PG has way too much space to get the shot off. 11. Bojan is surveying his side of the court which is great. As soon as PG is about to make the pass, notice how his head is turned backwards/over his left shoulder towards Mann at the 17 sec mark. He probably thought Mann was going to drive/cut to the basket. Even if Mann attempts to drive/cut to the basket, Gobert is sitting in the paint. Bojan has to be two steps closer to Batum here. Gobert has to take ownership and communicate with Bojan by telling him to be closer to Batum, not Mann. 1.  This right here is a lack of awareness by Bojan and Gobert.  12. Conley starts off by splitting the difference between Mann and Batum. This is what you want. Otherwise, Mann will be left completely open. You want to force Mann into making a decision - do I shoot or pass to my guy Batum? Conley gambles here by trying to steal the ball. You can only respect the effort here. However, when the pass goes out to Mann, Conley doesn't even make an attempt at closing out. He just gave up here. Complete lack of effort to end the defensive play. Why Conley? You did so well to start. You split the difference and attempted to steal the ball. Why did you just give up at the end? 13. Heat check shot by Pat Bev really. What more can you do here? For starters, get your hands up Bojan. You're daring Pat Bev to shoot, this is what you get. 14. Same thing as point 10. Gobert has to have his right hand up higher. Look at where his right hand is. It seems like his right hand palm is at eye-level. It has to be high above your head. You got a long reach, use it! Wtf you doing with this half-assed attempt at closing out? You want to disrupt Pat Bev's vision here.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Notice a trend here? Most of these plays, there was a defensive breakdown. Rotations were missed. Effort was missing. That's on the coach and the defensive anchor Rudy to tell his guys where they need to be. You see how Draymond is always yelling out to his guys where they need to be? Yea, that's more like it. What's one player that sticks out the most in all these plays above? Donovan Mitchell. He has poor awareness, vision and effort on the defensive side. Clippers were not only trying to exploit Gobert, they were trying to exploit Donovan too."
"Because the Rockets played a bunch of minutes with Capela and didn't move to true microball until they traded him away. Harden was getting his way throughout that series, though that was partially on slow adjustments. Covering Harden worked once they figured it out and forced Harden into a bunch of bad floaters, but it took until Game 4 for the guys on the floor to defend correctly and then the offense blew it.  And yeah, the Warriors winning in 2017 should be no surprise. Curry/Klay/Dray/KD/Iggy is a cheat code of a lineup with a really strong supporting unit, and no team really has the personnel to deal with that death lineup. (Are you really pointing at the Jazz's performance against one of the best rosters in NBA history who went 16-1 in the playoffs as evidence of defensive incompetency?)  If you somehow meant the series against the Nuggets, where Jokic and Murray were on fire the whole series, Gobert gave Jokic a hard time, and Jokic still made everything. In today's NBA, good offense beats good defense, and Jokic's offense is particularly difficult to stop. (NBA stats showed that he was over 50% FG% in all but one individual big matchup during this past regular season.)  If having Gobert is such a liability, how is no one focusing on our other players' defense? Conley and Mitchell were both hurt during the series and couldn't stay in front of their men, and our wings are slow. Our only positive healthy perimeter defender is Royce O'Neale (Ingles, Bogdanovic, Niang all have slow foot speed and Mitchell was defending on one leg) and while he does a good job on most, he can only cover one guy. Reggie Jackson could literally roast at least any three of the five guys the Jazz put on the floor purely by being faster.  If anything, Gobert's lack of participation in the offense was the more concerning part."
The Clippers also exploited a massive athleticism advantage against Utah. Royce O'Neale was the only guy that could match athleticism with the Clippers players.

No more lame-ass Jingled memes haha. Royce O'Neale you clown only started talking after Kawhi went down.
"Royce ""Shaquille"" O'Neale"
Don't let Mitchell splitting the D distract you from the fact that PG nearly got his D split by Royce O'Neale.
What is wrong with Royce O'Neale?
"Mikal Bridges, Marcus Smart, Thybulle, O.G. Anouby, Bam, Gobert, Royce O'Neale, Draymond Green, Dort, AD, Paul George, Giannis, Simmons, Embiid, Isaac are some players that come to my mind right now that are currently on my favorite defensive players to watch.  I appreciate defense, especially isolation defense as you said.   Peak Kawhi, Josh Smith, Tony Allen, Marc Gasol, Tim Duncan, Bryant, KG, are some of my favorite defenders back in the days to watch.   Man, it's almost criminal to this day that Duncan's never ever won DPOY...."
are you seriously insinuating that ben simmons is better than royce o'neale?
Are you seriously saying that Royce o'neale is a better player than Ben Simmons?
Donovan Mitchell  Rudy Gobert  Jordan Clarkson  Royce O'neale
"He is, but Don, Conley, Royce O'Neale, Jingles and Clarkson are all competent from behind the arc (to varying degrees)."
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"&gt;Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said."
"YES finally   &gt;As sort of an amalgam of the last two points, I’m basically done with fake stretch bigs as topline players. By fake, I mean they aren’t really bigs. They might be tall. But if they can’t do big-man things like protect that rim and/or put smaller players in the basket with the ball if they are being guarded by some random small forward, then they are just slow, often mediocre shooting threes rather than bigs. This sort of walking one-way mismatch doesn’t cut it in modern playoffs.  There is some recency bias with this, like sorry Im not taking Jeff Green over someone like Royce O'Neale if my goal is to win the most basketball games possible next year. Devonte Graham also shouldnt have come this close to missing out is the other thing that came ot my mind."
"Oh I don't know if I'm gonna be able to keep up with someone who spent 2 whole minutes on a player bref page after hearing about him for the first time. That kinda dedication to analysis just can't be matched. I salute your analytical prowess.   Every advanced stat backs him up:   1.6 Lebron (compares to: Derozan, Ja Morant, Robert Covington, Myles Turner)   1.7 EPM (compares to: Lowry, Middleton, Sabonis)   2.0 Raptor (compares to: Ayton, Vuc, Royce O'Neale, Joe Harris, Jaylen Brown)     He started in the closeout game for a championship team. He's a fantastic guard defender, hustles for loose balls, and has great IQ.   But I can see how all of that is easy to miss when the entirety of your bball knowledge is listening to Microsoft Narrator read you bref pages since your blindness prevents you from actually watching games."
"Yup. People wanna lay the blame on Gobert, but besides him and Royce O'Neale, we're not that great a defensive team. I mean Favors had his moments, but he's not what he used to be defensively, and it's not like you were ever playing Favors alongside Gobert. The reason why a Clippers team chooses to go small ball is because Gobert makes it so hard to score in the paint, and since the Jazz have mediocre perimeter defense (at best), you might as well bombard them with perimeter shooting."
Royce O'Neale?
Feel like Royce O'Neale would be a good fit on the Warriors.
"Counterplay to 5-out is to sub-Rudy out of the game and go with your 5 best athletic defenders.  The problem with the Jazz is there a flawed team.  Outside of Royce O'neale, they don't have much athletism at the wing.  I don't see how they can ever become a real contender if Rudy doesn't get significantly better on offense.  Expecting Mitchell to play Hero ball for 4 series straight is just crazy."
"He is not a better defender than Giannis and he is also not a better defender than Draymond.   If you look at advanced defensive metrics, he's level with Royce O'Neal on DWS and with Andre Iguodala (and below Jimmy Butler) on DBPM. [source](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::dws)  I think he's a better defender than O'Neale and Butler (and Dre, obviously), for what it's worth, and that advanced statistics need to be compared with the eye test. But there's not a credible case to be made for Simmons as the best defender in the league other than media voting (which, btw, put Pat ""trick y'all"" Bev on the All-Defensive Team three times)."
Royce O'Neale is just as good
"He's a brilliant PG and a threat to score from anywhere on the court, not sure what young assets Utah has to include to sweeten the deal but I'm sure Philly would at least consider pairing him up with Harris and Embiid, especially if they can also land someone like Royce O'Neale in the deal."
"Royce O'Neale, Mike Conley, and Paul George"
"I think top 10 all-time is pretty set:  1. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  2. Bill Russell  3. Vince Carter  4. Royce O'Neale  5. Jerry West  6. Vince Carter  7. Tim Duncan  8. Eddie Jones  9. Paul Pierce  10. Vince Carter   I say Giannis is right in the convo for potentially top 10, along with Stephen Curry and Paul Arizin"
"*side eyes Bojan getting 4 RPG and 2 APG last season on 31 MPG*  The shorter (generously 6'4"") Royce O'Neale got 6.8 RPG and 2.5 APG. (Easily our second best rebounder)"
"Per basketball-reference, only ONE player in the NBA last season averaged 10.0 ppg, and that was Bryn Forbes. The rest averaged 10.1 ppg or more, or 9.9 ppg or less.     Anyways, with that said, here is my starting lineup of players who played a minimum of 35 games last season and averaged 10.0 ppg or lower...     PG: Cameron Payne   SG: Bryn Forbes   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Draymond Green   C: Nicolas Batum     Payne is a 44% 3pt shooter and Forbes is a 45% 3pt shooter. Shooting percentages may be slightly lower with more defensive pressure on them, but I doubt it would be anything more than a 5-7% dip (I would expect both to shoot in the high 30's). Backcourt would be slightly undersized, but if they are knocking down threes at a high clip, I can live with it.     Green would likely be the primarily ball handler, but Payne would take pressure off of Green to be the sole shot creator. Covington, Green, and Batum could all take turns playing center. They're versatile enough to play a bunch of different styles defensively. Rebounding will be weak unless Green averages 10+ rpg out of necessity.     Honorable mentions:     PG: Anfernee Simons / Ricky Rubio / Tomáš Satoranský / Cory Joseph   SG: Talen Horton-Tucker / Kentavious Caldwell-Pope / Luke Kennard / Landry Shamet   SF: Danny Green / Kent Bazemore   PF: Dorian Finney-Smith / Royce O'Neale   C: Jakob Poeltl / Steven Adams / Nerlens Noel / Robert Williams"
I was going to say Royce O'Neale but he averaged exactly 7.0pts last season
casual take and you're 100% wrong lmao. you think the jazz has been a top defensive team lately because of bojan bogdanovic/jordan clarkson/georges niang/arguable their second best defender royce  o'neale(who struggles against quicker smaller guards)?  tell me you don't watch basketball without telling me you don't watch basketball
"&gt;or just completely shit the bed like he did vs Houston a couple of years back  Lmao, it was his sophomore year and he was the only actual scoring threat as a significant underdog to the Rockets.   It was Mitch, Ricky Rubio, Derrick Favors, Jae Crowder, Rudy Gobert, Royce O'Neale, and Joe Ingles as the guys that played significant minutes."
"What do Mikal Bridges and Royce O'Neale have in common when it comes to their offensive role? Standing in the (weakside) corner.  Who was assigned to guard them when they played Portland? Damian Lillard.  Mikal Bridges and Royce O'Neale were also the primary defenders assigned to guarding Dame.  Who was assigned to guard Mikal and Royce when they played Dallas? Luka Doncic.  That doesn't make Lillard a SF. It doesn't make Mikal a PG. That's because Luka and Dame have the same role on defence -- *stand vaguely near the weakside corner shooter and theoretically help on drives, but ideally take a break.*   Lillard doesn't pressure opposing ball-handlers all game long. PatBev does it a lot. Rubio does it sometimes. They have very different defensive roles because they have different skills and play in different schemes.  You're idealising things to the point where they no longer real relation to reality. Fine. You do you. But as useless as positions in the NBA of today, at least on offence the PG position is as well defined as any -- bring the ball over half court, run the largest chunk of PnRs, decide where the ball goes.  At the end of the day the only person for whom it matters who plays at which position is the head coach of that team. That's why positions exists -- so the coach can more efficiently organise players into a cohesive whole. And Carlisle was adamant Luka plays PG as far as he's concerned, and he was the only one whose opinion on the matter mattered."
Royce O'Neale got Good Starter.   So......not quite sure how that compares to Dubious.
"A 32yr old Bogdanovic, Ingles, and Royce O'Neale are all decent defenders in their own right, but they're missing the true lockdown wing that can handle the apex predators like Bron, PG, Kawhi, Luka, etc."
"And still is honestly, Conley and Mitchell are small (and Don rarely plays hard on defense), Bojan is super slow, Ingles is crafty but has lost a ton of lateral quickness, Clarkson is thin. That leaves Royce O'Neale who is fine, but shouldn't be THE stopper on a real team"
"I thought Royce O'Neale was a solid wing defender, although I don't watch a ton of Jazz ball."
I wouldn't sell Royce O'Neale short.
"Cap rises are really messing with people's sense of good/bad contracts. Current cap is $112M, while some teams are paying up to $180M. $10M/y is not much at all, just barely above the full non-taxpayer MLE. Also, in a couple of years, this contract should be fairly easily tradeable, regardless of Shamet's usefulness on the court.  This is also outside of the top 100 AAV, which kind of reflects where Shamet is as a player. He provides shooting, which is at a premium in today's NBA, and makes up the backend of a rotation. Maybe they could have negotiated him down to like 4yr/$36M, but then they risk losing him.  Non-rookie contracts in this price range (+/- 1M/year, from higher to lower) include: Devonte Graham, Dillon Brooks, Richuan Holmes, Dwight Powell, Reggie Jackson, (Shamet here), THT, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, (below this are the full MLE guys)  For a career backup, this is around the range you'd expect. Probably the argument here is for Shamet to be paid more like Monte Morris 3yr/$27M, Alex Caruso 4yr/$37M, Royce O'Neale 4yr/$36M, Daniel Theis 4yr/$36M, but perhaps the Suns were worried about losing some shooting at a position they aren't super deep at (with only CP3, Booker, Cam Payne, and Elfrid Payton as the other dedicated guards)."
Royce O'Neale Is so important to our team but isn’t on many radars.
"I don't think it's that our guys are bad per se, but it's a matter of roster construction. The team knows that as a small market, it has to play on some sort of inequity in the market, and that was poor/slow defenders who are good offensive options. Rudy would cover up their mistakes and they would theoretically lead us to an amazing offense.  Problem with this was a lack of roster flexibility. By the time the Clippers series rolled around, our main rotation consisted of two hobbled lead guards (Conley/Mitchell), an amazing sixth man who was a traffic cone in iso defense (Clarkson), and slow wings (Ingles, Bojan, Niang). The only good and laterally quick defender other than Gobert at that point was Royce O'Neale. Legit no one was coming to save this rotation. Opposing guards would blow past our injured or poor-technique guards or laterally slow wings and there was no recourse. We couldn't even put out a defensive-minded lineup."
"I came in here to say Joe Ingles and I got beaten to the punch by Nitro, so I'll proffer a second name: Royce O'Neale. Multiple times last season, I saw him turn down wide open wing 3's only to pass to a guy who was covered. Frequently, it was in the middle of the extra pass action, but his defender was so far away, I was just like I get that's muscle memory, but you gotta take that shot bro, we aren't getting a better one this possesesion."

But I'm sure Mitchell and his 39 points on great efficiency were the problem."
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
"The Lakers literally have no reliable defensive player after AD. He has to cover not only his man, but cover for WB, Melo, Monk, etc. He is still a premier defensive player, and you'd be lying to yourself if you think the lakers defensive issues come because AD.   Gobert has Mike Conley, Royce O'neale. and some other defenders who may not be lockdown but are high defensive IQ players who don't let their guy get open layups the way Melo has more often than not."
"Probably:  Mitchell, Gobert, Conley, Bogdanovic, Clarkson, Royce O'Neale, Paschall and Whiteside? Honestly Ingles would be their 4th or 5th protection"
"Royce O'Neale. Before last year, I thought he was extremely overrated and didn't bring much to the team. A three now and then, and some OK defense. Last year, he really stepped up his defense, his 3 point shooting, and I completely changed my mind on him.  On Joe Ingles, I wasn't watching much when we first signed him. I didn't get the point of signing him just to keep watch over Exum. Started watching more the next year and did a 180, plus a couple back flips, a hand stand, and built a shrine to Jinglin Joe."
Gobert effect  Edit: I should also give mad props to Royce O'Neale
Mikal has definitely become one of my favorite players. He and Royce O'Neale both are weirdly underrated despite being on two of the top 3 teams in the West.
"What trades can they actually do though? They've got their 3 max guys, THT on 10m a year, and 11 guys on min contracts. All their picks are on other teams and plenty of other teams are going to have better deals for whoever the Lakers are looking at.  If this roster wanted reconstruction it had to happen in the offseason and, I know I'm harping here, not trading every asset they had left for Westbrook. This team is really stuck in right now and needs to figure out a way to win as they are; even if they do pull something off, adding a bench rotation player like Grayson Allen or Royce O'Neale isn't going to take them from .500 against bad teams to title favorite."
Yeah it's really important to remember that +/- is a lineup stat. Donovan Mitchell and Royce O'Neale have exactly the same +/-.
"""Grayson Allen lead all players in 'plus/minus' at +18.   ^(Royce O'Neale also had +18"")"
"He's so good he gets the superstar calls on screens, he throws his ass into screen every single time and they never call it. I was telling this to a friend after he set a screen and the ball handler didn't cut it close enough so he threw his ass out to disrupt the defender. Very next play, Royce O'Neale gets called for an illegal screen for doing the same thing. It's nice to be on the right side of this superstar shit now, even if it's just screens and not getting free throws."
"Also, Royce O'Neale.  (Mentioned in another comment)"
"Royce O'Neale has been balling recently, should be an All-Defensive candidate"
"Jazz injury report:  Donovan Mitchell,  Royce O'Neale  Hassan Whiteside  Rudy Gay  Jared butler   :/ feelsbadman"
"Royce O'Neale is not the problem for perimeter defense either. The problem is literally everyone except Gobert, O'Neale, and Conley."
"Royce ""HUSTLE"" O'Neale"

"You're totally right, except you and the other dude are forgetting the original comment was ""Never thought I'd see Giannis take 11 3s in a game"" (or something like that).   And u/bonerang (amazing username) commented ""Scared of Big Baguette"" under the comment about 3s. Which you usually thinks means he's scared of shooting in the paint against Gobert, and that is totally not true (as seen in the games posted by the Bucks fan).   If anything Giannis is scared of Royce O'Neale, while ""owning' might be a hyperbole, he has no issue at all dominating Gobert in the paint."
Rudy Gobert really just distracts you from the fact that Royce O'Neale is also on this team.
