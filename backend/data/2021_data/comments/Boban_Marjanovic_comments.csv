"Imagine being Blake Griffin.    You're drafted by one of the worst organizations in the history of the NBA. A racist owner, horrible team management, team players themselves hating everything about organization, the whole 9 yards. You're Blake Griffin, however, and you do your best to put this organization on the map.    Griffin redshirts his 1st season due to injury, and in his 1st official season in the NBA, he wins ROTY and gets into the All-Star game as a rookie. You've turned this franchise around in just your first real season playing. The next season, the team capitalizes on your success and acquires Chris ""Point God"" Paul, and you and the team continue to have arguably successful season after successful season. Consistent playoff berths for one of the worst NBA organizations of all time for the better half of a decade. Their biggest downfall was just not making serious headway in the playoffs, with consistent First/Second round exits. That being said, you can't say those weren't successful seasons for the LA Clippers, considering their storied history.    At the end of the 2017 season, Blake Griffin had been expecting some sort of contract extension. He was, afterall, the face of the franchise for the better half of a decade. Blake Griffin wasn't expecting the biggest extension, heck he realized his own position at that point in his career, and was willing to work with the Clippers and compromise on a contract. When he walked into the extension, the Clippers had set up their room with various global icons, implying that Griffin would be an icon for the Clippers. Clippers employees wore custom made shirts featuring Griffin's face along with historic icons such as Obama, MLK, Gandhi, and Mandela. He was told that, as difficult as the times have been, the LA Clippers were committed to Griffin's future to the team. So according to Griffin, this was his team of the future. He was the face of the franchise, and he was offered a max contract from the get go. Of course, you accept a max contract, no matter who it is.   Just the next season after, approximately 6 months after the extension, the LA Clippers trade Blake Griffin to the Detroit Pistons for Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanovic, a future 1st and a future 2nd. Talk about getting your back stabbed by one of the worst franchises in NBA history. Not to say that the Clippers did the wrong thing, we have all seen how Griffin has declined since his 1st Detroit Pistons season, but it's how they did it that makes them the bad guy. The LA Clippers didn't have to lie to Griffin like that. Sorry Blake, you deserve better."

"That 30-inch average is also a standing vert, which it sounds like you’re comparing to your max.   A lot of top prospects don’t ever do official/published max vert testing, so any average you see is probably too low anyway. In the 2019 draft, the top eight picks all sat the physical testing out. The ninth pick, Jaxson Hayes, had a 34.5-inch max vert, and he’s a 6-11 center. So his max vertical (which I’d guess is probably about league average) is about 140% of your vertical.   Also, consider the athleticism of Tacko Fall (26.5” max) and Boban Marjanovic (23” max). Your 25” estimate for your max vert is roughly in between two generally unathletic giants. Gobert, who I’d say makes both guys look like snails, “only” has a max vert of about 29”. A few extra inches in vertical max is a lot."

He’s not some sort of an odd thing.”  &gt;[…]  &gt;“He’s a hard worker and he’s a really intelligent kid and he wants it badly,” Popovich said. “I think you can get off your game when people cheer in a certain way, over the line, for no reason.”"

"As much as people shit on Brand, as he deserves, I do think the Tobias and Butler trades were good. It was wasting and not utilizing the other picks nor being able to acquire stars in free agency that was poor. Also the poor organization structure.  ""Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton to the Philadelphia 76ers for Dario Saric, Robert Covington, Jerryd Bayless and a second-round pick""  Is a steal. No offense to RoCo, but he's nowhere near worth Butler and Saric is a low end bench player due to his defense and his offense not being enough to warrant more minutes.  ""The Philadelphia 76ers acquired Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanovic and Mike Scott early Wednesday morning for Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Philadelphia's protected 2020 first-round pick, the Miami Heat's unprotected 2021 first-round pick and the Detroit Pistons' 2021 and 2023 second-round picks""  That Miami pick isn't going to be amazing, but outside of that:  Chandler is in China. Muscala was traded for Zubac, but he's not great(although he is playing better for the Lakers).  Those trades weren't bad and they traded low assets for better players, it's just filling out the rest of the team wasn't done properly until this year."

"One day while jogging in the park I ran into Boban Marjanovic and I said hello to him. He turned around, pulled me close while smiling and hugged me. His glistening body made contact with mine and I shuddered at his manliness interacting with me. He whispered a love poem in my ear while putting goldfish in my mouth by the fistful before turning around and disappearing in the tree line where Tobias Harris and Luka waited for him. The three of them locked hands and skipped away while I was passing out from pure euphoria. I awoke several hours later feeing amazing and still lathered in Boban’s sweat and I felt like a newer, more enlightened person"

 Marjanovic let all those points in last 4 possession. Even on Simmons' play. How can you let the guy to finish on your side. Marjanovic is just too slow and not threathing on d.  It just became 5 possession on a row scoring against Boban while I'm writing. And another TO from Boban...

Marjanovic clogging the lane and Celtics can easily put double-triple team on Luka’s drive. Two nice blocks for Tatum. Good strategy from Brad Stevens.  Boban is very tough to play with. Huge liability on defense and he clogs the lane on offense. Tons of turnovers.

By this metric of judging DPOY Boban Marjanovic is a better defender than Ben Simmons. I think you should re-think the way you evaluate DPOY.
"Boban Marjanovic: the man, the myth, the legend  I just breathe a sigh of relief when he checks in because at the very least, we have the most impressive human on the court."
"Ok, so my starting lineup is Marcus Smart, Andre Roberson, Jared Dudley, Draymond Green and Boban Marjanovic. My Bench is KC Jones, Dennis Rodman (at SF), and Ben Wallace / Noah as the bigs.  Boban is going to be involved in every minute of the game, probably getting a dunk on nearly every possession. The rest of the team bust their ass playing 4-on-5 defense while he jogs back and just camps under the rim."
"shades of when Boban Marjanovic nearly turned down 3y/$21m from the Pistons because he was just so fond of Pop until Pop explained to him how much money $21,000,000 was in comparison to the $3,000,000 he'd already made and convinced him to go to Detroit"

"His best game of the series was tonight. 50% FT, a big 0 from the perimeter and getting some free rebounds because of Boban's gravity. Boban. He was outplayed by Boban Marjanovic, God bless his tall and cute soul, in his best game of the series.  Porzingis is soft, is lazy, doesn't contest anything and probably thinks he is a goddamn wing or something. ""Ah but Rick asked him to"", yadayadayada. I endured this team for almost the whole season (I did slept in the 11 PM Sacramento game and in the sans-Luka loss in Chicago), KP plays like this everytime, no matter if he's the 4 or the 5. Defensively, he gets his daily rebound and gets the Pat Bev special, just standing around close to the wing, doing nothing (except if the other team has a decent wing shooter, like, let's say, MARCUS MORRIS. In this case, he'll be doing the Lebroff special, just hanging around near the logo). Offensively, he demands to be fed, but only knows tomahawk dunks (exclusively in the 1st half) and those FUCKING ANNOYING DEEP 3s WITH 15 SECONDS ON THE CLOCK. He hits one in 6 and thinks he's the taller version of Steph Curry.   He could work, yes, but playing with someone that gives him the gravity he needs to continue his delirium of being a 3-pt specialist and that controls the paint, because the Unicorn does not like actually having to work (except against San Antonio. He thinks he's Shaq against the Spurs for some reason). So, basically the Pelicans.   Ship KP and Brunson (love the guy, really do, but we'll definitely not paying him, specially after THJ playing his way into a 23mpy contract) for a Adams and S&amp;T of Lonzo, if he is adamant of getting out of NOLA. I would love Hayes, but the Pels would not eat out KP's contract and give up a guy like Hayes."

"Brunson is a good shooter, and one of the 2 players not named Luka that can create his own shot, but he is not a ball handler. Whenever we asked him to play point, our offense resorted on cheap ball movement and isos. It was worse when Rick paired him with Burke. Brunson is at his best when he has someone creating next to him, and he can focus on his pros. Now, we surely won't pay him, and he will command a 15-20m salary on the market. If a team hires him thinking he is Walmart Trae Young, it will flop big time. In the playoffs he just got cold, whereas THJ went supernova. I cannot remember a game where both him and THJ went hot at the same time, usually one of the two would be cold.   About WCS, he is the steroid version of on and off player. He was on during games 3 and 6, but entirely off during the rest of the series, and you can tell which WCS you'll get in the first minute of the guy on court. The KP/big tandem were discovered while we were being murdered by the AD/Drummond tandem, and Rick ran mostly KP/WCS. WCS just wasn't reliable for the Clippers series. Powell got the hustle and rebounding we needed when they went small, but Boban was (a) a mismatch nightmare, specially considering whenever he's playing, Luka consider his life mission to get him going (seriously, watch any Philly game. Luka force feeds Boban so much that he could make a Marjanovic Foie Gras at the end of those games) and (b) a clever way to punt a series without throwing the games away. It was clear to the brass that our roster was lacking when Rick had to give significant post season minutes to Boban, Melli and Burke. With that being said, I would've started Powell as well.   The whole problem funneled to KP. It was KP's lack of hustle that started this snowball. Sometimes it seems that Luka has more control of the paint than the 7'2 guy. We don't know if Rick put KP on the naughty corner because of his passivity, or if his passivity came because he was asked to sit on the wings, but playoff KP was the worst version of regular season KP: chugging logo 3s without any reasoning, avoiding the paint like he's injuried Steph Curry, halting any ball movement just standing there scratching his ass. Watch, if you want, the Spurs series, those games were easily the best he had. He controlled Poeltl like it was a NBA x College game, he absorbed every rebound, he ran the pick with Luka like it was the bubble, then he went ""fuck this"" again. KP is infuriating. I'm hoping that this was a feud with Rick, and Kidd can make amendments, but KP's passivity was what triggered Rick's desperate moves to zag with his big ball when Lue got us cornered. Also, this usually triggers Luka's hero ball games. This is just an eye test thing, but always felt that Luka would try to solve things alone whenever KP went his Cancun mode."

"Man, you're all sorts of wrong. Scola isn't 42, he's 41. I know that's not much of a difference but he was 39 when he ""carried"" Argentina to the finals. So it seems like two years is a huge difference in your mind. He also didn't carry the team. Deck, Campazzo and Vildoza are now in the NBA in part due to the amazing performances in the WC. That team was also comprised of well stablished players in Europe like Laprovittola (MVP of Liga Endesa in 2019), Brussino and Garino (all of whom had NBA experience as well). Since you claim to know European basketball so well I believe you should know this. Now, you gotta help me out with this, since I clearly don't know european basketball at all. Which 3 second rules are you talking about? The one by which you can't be in the paint for three seconds if you're the offensive player? Because that one's in the NBA, too. In fact, the NBA has the more restrictive rules, since you can't do that also if you're the defensive player. In FIBA, though? You can live in the paint if you're defending. Now, are you claiming that Giannis can't dominate because defensive players would just wait for him in the paint? It seems like you need to watch him play more, you seem to have the notion that he just jumps from the free throw line and stuffs it in the rim and that's how he got two MVPs. So, two times MVP Antetokoumpo can't carry Greece, but Luka Docic can carry a Slovenian team who has had absolutely no experience in Olympics nor WC. 39 yo Scola can and did, according to you, carry Argentina to a WC final. Finally, you say that all big teams were missing key players. Argentina knocked out Serbia in the quarter finals game. Their best player was Nikola Jokic. I know you claim you watch european basketball so you probably don't know who he is. He's the current MVP of the NBA. Other notable NBA players were Bogdan Bogdanovic (he played in the ECF with the Hawks), Bjelica and Boban Marjanovic. They also had Micic, which is the current MVP of the Euroleague. But you knew that already, you know a lot of european basketball.  In the Semi finals, Argentina beat France. Their best player was Rudy Gobert. As in, NBA's current DPOY. Also on that team: Fournier, De Colo, Ntilikina and Batum. So tell me again, who they were missing? Serbia didn't have 34 yo Teodosic which is a great player but far from the best. He got injured before the WC. So I guess that makes Argentina a non contender for these Olympics. The fact that you think an amazing yet young player like Doncic can carry an unproven and, to be honest, fairly mediocre, Slovenian team past Argentina tells me you know 0 about european (or latin american, for that matter) basketball."

"/u/TimathanDuncan is very disingenious with his Boban stats.  &amp;#x200B;  ""Boban once shot 90% from the line""...At first I assumed they meant the Free Throw Line, and [here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/international/players/boban-marjanovic-1.html) is his stats from International competition.  Yes, he shot 92% one season, but it was in eight games where he shot 13 free throws in the season.  So I'm going to consider that 'fluky'.   For his international career, he's at 72%.  &amp;#x200B;  ""...and is shooting 25% for his NBA career""  [Here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/marjabo01.html) are his current NBA stats.  For his career, he's at 77%, quite a bit higher than '25%'.  His last season he shot 82%.   &amp;#x200B;  Maybe they meant field goal percentage?    No, he shoots 57% from the field on his NBA career, with 51% in his most recent season.   &amp;#x200B;  Maybe they meant 3-pt comparison?  Ah, this is probably what they mean.  He shoots 25% from the 3pt line in his NBA career (on .1 attempts per game).   Which is better than his European stats (0-1 in eight seasons).   &amp;#x200B;  So they are comparing 13 free throw attempts on a season a decade ago to his current 3pt ability."

"This is one of my favorite domino effects in recent NBA history, that is partly accidental.  &amp;#x200B;  So Mikal Bridges, the 10th pick, gets traded to the Suns from the 76ers for Zhaire Smith, the 16th pick, currently in the G League, and the Miami Heat unprotected 2021 pick. That pick was considered to be a huge gem, because Dwyane Wade was going to retire soon, and the Heat did not have a lot of young talent to keep them up.   The 76ers wanted that pick badly and used it to trade for Tobias Harris. Remember, in between this they were able to get Jimmy Butler for just Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless, and a 2nd round pick.   To get Harris + Boban Marjanovic + Mike Scott, they gave up Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala (who got traded for Ivica Zubac), the Heat 2021 first, a lottery protected 76ers 2020 first, and two Detroit second rounders.   So now the plan for the 76ers was to wield a lineup for the next few years of Ben Simmons, JJ Reddick, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, and Joel Embiid, and fill the bench with their remaining picks and exception players. But Kawhi's game winner in the 2019 East semifinals resulted in Butler and Reddick's departures due to mismanagement from the part of the Elton Brand Front Office, who instead only kept Harris (likely due to the number of picks they parted with for him) and gave Al Horford an ill-advised max extension. That Horford deal led to the Danny Green-Horford swap, then the Kemba-Horford swap.  Jimmy Butler went to the Miami Heat, which made them at least a borderline playoff team, and then he took them to the finals. That made the 2021 Heat pick hardly valuable anymore, and so the Clippers were forced to part with more picks than they originally expected to when they traded for Paul George in order to sign Kawhi Leonard.   Meanwhile the Suns kept building, and eventually, got Monty Williams as their coach, who led them to an 8-0 record in the bubble, and then they were able to deal for CP3, who got traded to the Thunder from Houston for Russell Westbrook, which doesn't happen without the Paul George trade. And an underrated reason for the second seeded Suns finish this year was Mikal Bridges ability as a 3 and D wing.  So in the big brain move by Elton Brand, he let Jimmy Butler walk in order for the big asset he parted with for Tobias Harris to look like nothing, and force the Clippers to have to mortgage their entire future to get Paul George and Kawhi Leonard instead of only a few picks. Obviously so smart because Jimmy Butler has only been to \*checks notes\* the NBA finals, and the 76ers have been to \*checks notes\* the Eastern Conference Semifinals."
"I'm assuming you're a Mavs fan, so:   Offseason focus  An alignment between the front office and new head coach  The blank check approach with Luka Doncic: eligible for $200M rookie extension  Finding help for Doncic: projected $20-$35M in cap space but at the cost of Tim Hardaway Jr. and possibly Josh Richardson  The extension options for Jalen Brunson  Year 3 of Kristaps Porzingis ($90M+ left on his contract)  Draft assets  Future: The Mavericks owe New York a top-10 protected first in 2023, 2024 or 2025. The earliest that Dallas can trade a first is two years after the pick to New York is conveyed.  Cash: $4.5 million (to send) | $5.6 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  With Doncic in the last year of this rookie-scale contract, the 2021 offseason presents an opportunity for Dallas to maximize cap flexibility. By releasing the cap holds of free agents James Johnson and Hardaway, Dallas projects to have $20 million in cap space. If Richardson opts out of his $11.6 million contract and the $4.1 million team option of Willie Cauley-Stein is not exercised, the Mavericks could have up to $33.5 million. Richardson has until Aug. 1 to make a decision on whether to pick up his deal, and the Mavericks face the same Aug. 1 deadline on Cauley-Stein's team option. Additionally, the $1.8 million contract of Brunson becomes guaranteed if he is not waived by Aug. 2.  Because the cap in 2022-23 is projected to increase slightly ($112 million to $115 million), the Mavericks will have $22 million if they punt on free agency this offseason and Doncic is extended.  Porzingis and Trey Burke both have trade bonuses written into their contract. Porzingis' 5% trade kicker would get voided because it exceeds the maximum salary allowed. The Burke trade bonus is 7.5% of the value remaining on his contract (minus the player option in 2022-23).  Team needs  Shooting guard if Hardaway leaves in free agency  Wing defender off the bench  A power forward to compliment Porzingis  Extension eligible: Doncic (rookie), Brunson, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber  Free-agent status  Richardson | Player | Bird  JJ Redick | Early Bird  Hardaway | Bird  Boban Marjanovic | Early Bird  Cauley-Stein | Team | Early Bird  Nicolo Melli | Restricted | Early Bird"

A starting lineup of All-NBA players plus that depth off the bench is just staggering. The weakest position is center but Duncan played nearly 40 MPG back then and LMA and West would be capable of filling in those minutes as well."
