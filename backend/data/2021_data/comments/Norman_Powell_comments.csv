"For real. If your a guy like Norman Powell you just take the money and run. You don’t need to stay in Toronto for cheap, and it’s not like they’ll compete for anything either"
"I don't think the nuggets would do that personally. I think MPJ's ceiling is too high.  As for Harrison Barnes I think he could do a really good job on a winning team.  I think the raptors could push for a deal for him and Hassan Whiteside, maybe giving up Norman Powell Aaron Baynes Patrick McCaw and some picks? This would give the Raptors Center depth and scoring while the King's get draft assets and some expiring deals."

"Tyrese Haliburton, Jordan Clarkson, Norman Powell, Montrezl Harrell, Enes Kanter"
"Dragic’s a good choice for sure.   I’d add Jordan Clarkson, Gary Trent Jr., Nerlens Noel, Norman Powell, Joe Ingles (if he still comes off the bench, can’t remember), Shake Milton’s should get to be in this category too with some consistency. Saric has been kind of amazing in Phoenix as a bench big as well.  edit: Naz Reid"
Not above Norman Powell.
"norman powell tonight technical foul for taunting pistons bench after a made 3, like wtf lmao this game is getting the life sucked out of it."
Norman Powell is a Buck Killer so it's only fitting that the Bucks get a Powell of their own to bring balance to the universe.
I'd take Norman Powell on literally any team. He's so fkn good
"First that hard Ben Simmons foul on Norman Powell, and now this?  NBA refs are a joke."
"For the knicks we should look at Lonzo and Gary Trent even though there are RFA  For UFA, Evan Fournier, Norman Powell or Kyle Lowry would be nice"
"“Jrue Holiday, Norman Powell and Jaylen Brown are overrated”"
Who needs Kawhi when we have starter Norman Powell
Norman Powell
Na hes washed trade him for norman powell and mccaw
"I don't really understand the people bringing up, ""it was a bad question,"" as a rebuttal for why it's fine for Booker or any other player to respond this way. Where I grew up, I was taught that there was no such thing as a bad question and if you didn't know something just ask. I thought you were supposed help people not shun them.   At the end of the day the beat reporter is basically just asking what he's been doing to improve his game so much this season. Feel like regular not entitled players wouldn't take that as a slight and instead inform the interviewer what exactly that is. Like Norman Powell for our team, he's been asked similar questions throughout the season and always responds with, ""I've been putting in work in the off season, studying game tape, working on my handle and reading defenses, etc."" Even if they're generic statements it's better than making some reporter guy feel like crap for no reason."
Norman Powell...
"Here's my attempt at a few guys I've seen a lot of:  Kawhi: aaAAUUGGHH  Siakam: AAAIIIIEEEEEE  DeRozan: oouuRAAEEEE  Chris Boucher: HUUA?! (High pitched)  Norman Powell: AYY!  and my personal favourite, Embiid: OO! ... OOO!!!.... OOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! (Very high pitched and progressively higher)"
Lol I’m a Philly fan. They don’t really have better trade options. The clips don’t have a first until 2027. Sixers have Maxey and all of their future picks. Norman Powell is a better and healthier version of Kennard. Ain’t nobody taking that contract unless clips are attaching a pick to him (which they don’t have). Kennard is a liability not an asset
"Kennard is a negative asset at his contract and knee injuries. Norman Powell is a free agent and a much better player, they’re not gonna tie up $16M/year for a bench player with chronic knee problems that won’t move the needle for them."
"Loved to see my team looking aggressive and confident out there at our first game back home. On the raps, Norman Powell and Boucher were looking deadly last night but Siakam was getting into all types of foul trouble in the first half. Overall gg"
"I'd personally put Kawhi over DeMar. People look at the one year stint at the be all/end all. Kawhi did more in one year that DeMar couldn't accomplish in 9. DeRozan in the playoffs was hard to watch and people called Vince quitting bad. DeRozan going to a podium and publicly stating ""I'll pay anyone $100  to stop LeBron"" after being swept and only to be swept the next year.   He was getting benched for Norman Powell and OG as rookies in the playoffs. And his final moment as a Raptor was getting tossed for freaking clotheslining Jordan Clarkson down 30 on route to a second straight year being swept. I'll take Kawhi winning a championship in one of the most impressive individual performances in the last 30 years."
"They constantly call Lowry, anunoby, siakam and Powell by their first names. Even their go to catchphrases for OG and Norm when they do something crazy are stormin' Norman and OG-OH-MY!!"
Celtics need to blow it up well take both the Jays for a first and Norman Powell
How about Richaun Holmes or Norman Powell that you left off the list?  There are probably 30 guys from that draft class better than Payne.

It’s still 20-13 even if you take those last 2 min out. Plus that Norman Powell bullshit was another 2 potential FT’s
"He's got a 8 foot wingspan, haven't you seen him?  Real talk though, Norman Powell is 6'4 with a 6'11 wingspan. Nuts. Isn't talen horten tucker built like that too?"
"Case in point  I never said they were the same; I said that the force created by both fouls was similar and both ended in similar falls. Main difference is that Norman Powell didn't stay on the ground for an extra couple minutes, seemingly in pain  The difference in reaction from Sixers fans is FAAAR more disproportionate than the severity of the fouls between Ben here and Bron then; funny watching you guys call Powell the flopper yet refuse to acknowledge Embiid likely did in order to sell the flagrant as he's famous for it"
"Good court vision, his head is facing Danny Green so he freezes Norman Powell."
"Good court vision, his head is facing Danny Green so he freezes Norman Powell."
They called a tech on Norman Powell for complaining to the refs.
The no call on Powell is actually worse for the sixers because it activated Norman. God dammit
"I don't really get all the praise for Hardaway Jr.  I'm not saying he is bad or anything, but he is basically just Norman Powell with bad defense, which seems like a fairly average player to me."
"I just think with the amount of picks they had, their depth should be better than it is. In the post-big 3 era how many second-rounders did they have? and how many of those worked out? I know that most second rounders don't work out, but to have as many as they did and for them to basically all be bad picks is the reason they have no depth. The last two champions have had players drafted in the second round rounding out their depth: Norman Powell and Kyle Kuzma.  Like quickly scrolling through some drafts right now, in 2015 they took Jordan Mickey above Richaun Holmes and Willy Hernangómez and Marcus Thornton over Norman Powell.  In 2016 they took Demetrius Jackson when they could have taken Georges Niang.  2019: Tremont Waters over Jalen McDaniels.  The only really solid second round picks I came across, where there weren't better players taken right after, were Abdel Nader and Semi Ojeleye."
"Raptor fans want to trade Lowry for anything, even a 7th SG for our roster while sitting here all season complaining that Matt Thomas doesn't get minutes.     To avoid losing him for ""nothing"" but honestly, if you make this trade you're telling Norm he isn't being extended and you're going to lose him for nothing so we would probably have to follow up by trading Norman Powell elsewhere.     Then you just lost Kyle Lowry and Norman Powell for Tyrone Maxey.     Doubtful."
Good luck finding playing time for him once we extend Norman Powell.
"Raptors would have Norman Powell, Danny Green, Patrick McCaw, Terence Davis, Tyrese Maxey, Matt Thomas, and Malachi Flynn, and Jalen Harris all vying for minutes at the 2."
"Nope just that he wanted to win.     The ""send him home"" narrative was invented by tank world order while everyone wanted to fade for cade. dudes literally never said that even once, or even provided an inkling that he wants to be anywhere but Toronto right now. He said his joy this season has been watching the kids grow. \*The point I'm making is that these people don't want Lowry to be happy - they want the team to tank.\*      A different sizable chunk of fanbase is terrified to lose assets and not get draft picks (even though we didn't have any playing time for our current rookie this year.)  The reality is these guys are very reactionary. Right now their take is that Norman Powell is untouchable, Earlier this season these same people were suggesting trading Siakam while he struggled.      I would have assumed that 30M is the Lowry ""thank you"" deal. After that he signs cheap, or moves on. Lowry has spent most of his career losing on the Raptors I'm sure one more playoff run won't hurt him."
"4 current raptors starters (Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, Norman Powell, and Chris Boucher) all played for the Raptors 905."
It's like saying that Norman Powell is Raptors soul  Or saying that Furkan Korkmaz is 76ers team spirit  Or saying that Eric Paschall drives the warriors  Or saying that withou Dozier Nuggets ain't going anywhere  Or saying that Pat Bev makes your team chemistry  Lol
"Would you take Norman Powell, Lowry, Matt Thomas and our frp plus a future second for Vuce and Fournier?  Norm needs to start somewhere to be the highly efficient scoring guard he has been and Lowry can’t come off the bench when he’s back. Norm can be the go to Magic guard scorer (been killing it for us the last 2 weeks again), Lowry is expiring and can provide cap flexibility to be a team that can take contract dumps for picks like OKC has done. Matt Thomas is an excellent shooter to boost the offense too  If anything a 3 team trade can be done to get Lowry somewhere that can win though"
thank you norman powell
dont disrespect norman powell. he's way better than that trash can kemba lol.
I want to say yes but you coulda gave that same contract to like Norman Powell or any other half decent 3rd/4th option in the league and see them average 20+ ppg on the worst team   someone has to make shots right
You can’t spell “Norman Powell” without “Well man.. porn”
Norman Powell 17/3/1.5/1 on 48/44/88 shooting
Contract year Norman Powell hits different
Norman Powell was the only player with more than 20 points
Cleveland enjoy norman powell :)
Norman Powell
Norman Powell was the only player with more than 20 points
Norman Powell just enjoys hunting woodland animals such as deer and wolves
"Wolves, 3 made 3s in the half, 22 attempts.  Norman Powell: 5 made threes on 9 attempts."
That's some Norman Powell starter shit.
"I don't think it's been mentioned in this thread yet. But the Bucks traded the pick that was Norman Powell, plus the pick that became OG Anunoby, to us for Grievis Vasquez."
"Norman ""Fuck you for trading me for Greivis Vásquez"" Powell*"
That’s Norman “the deer hunter” Powell to you
Less athletic Norman Powell with a max contract
Daily reminder that Norman Powell and OG Annouby were chosen from Bucks picks from the Greivis Vasquez trade.  🙏
Just got home and turned in  It would appear Norman Powell: Deer Hunter is back in Milwaukee
norman powell is getting snubbed
Norman Powell is literally Jordan vs the Bucks
I am not giving up Norman powell for Drummond lmao  fuck that nope
so who needs a starting SG and can give norman powell 25mill a year for the next four years?
Norman Powell
NORMAN POWELL BUCK HUNTER
Against Norman Powell middleton is that random dude at the Y who swears he plays basketball but cant
"The Bucks and getting killed by Norman Powell, name a more iconic duo"
noted bucks killer Norman Powell at it again
"By God, those are Norman Powell numbers"
Gary Trent Jr. 🤝 Norman Powell  Only playing like ass off the bench
How's his defense? Or is he like Norman Powell for us.
Look at how on all these shots Middleton is taking out of a Giannis screen or handoff Giannis has an open lane to to cut or roll to the basket or a mismatch on Norman Powell. This is where they miss Holiday
"Let me throw out Norman Powell.  Dude is reckless, has zero vision or playmaking. Dude mostly gets by on athleticism and motor."
"Even ignoring the other players, you are trading the better yardie for a worse yardie. Just waiting for a big to come onto the buyout market would be better than trading Powell for Drummond. Reaching out to Dedmon to see if he wants to sign for the rest of season is better than trading a better player for a worse player who plays another position. When Drummond is shooting at the third worst percentage in the league at the rim (minimum 100 attempts) only ahead of Fred VanVleet and Malcolm Brogdon, he is still a bad defender and teams rebound better when he is on the bench, why would I want to trade a positive player like Norman for a negative player. Keeping Norman and just riding with Baynes, playing more OG at C or running more Yuta+Boucher together is far better than trading Norman for a player whose value was SO LOW just last season that they got traded for Brandon Knight John Henson and one 2nd round pick."
His name sounds like if you had Bells Palsy and were trying to say Norman Powell.
Norman Powell
Norman Powell
And the Raptors are about to give Norman Powell up for him...
Isn't Norman Powell pretty good? Or am I behind the times?
The Bucks traded the picks that became OG Anunoby and Norman Powell to Toronto for a year of Greives Vasquez in 2015
"Kawhi, AD,  Westbrook, PJ Tukcker, Norman Powell  GG WP!"
"Out of curiosity, what makes it so bad? Is it mostly the Norman Powell thing? If so, how do you feel about Gorgui Dieng? He's basically doing the same things as Baynes, but he actually makes his 3s (and he's coming off the bench, unlike Baynes).   A package of Baynes, McCaw, and any two bench players makes the money work, do you think that's fair value? What if you threw in a second or two? It would allow you to get off Baynes' contract a year early, and Gorgui would improve your team imo. Grizzlies have some cap flexibility for the next few years, and a logjam in the frontcourt, so I think this trade could work for both teams."
"Lowry outgoing from Toronto   Or Norman Powell, Aron Baynes, Mccaw outgoing.  Raptors need to send out 1/1.25 of Drummond's contract value at least."
It would have to include a core player or Norman Powell to match salaries. Raptors are not a trade fit
"If the Raptors give up Norman Powell for Andre Drummond that's such a damn fleece.  Just to make the salaries match you'd have to offer Powell, Baynes, McCaw and Stanley Johnson. That's still too much.  I think Lowry is going out but it'll be a 3-team trade. Lowry will go to a contender."
Nobody should be giving up real value for Andre which Norman Powell would be
KEEP NORMAN POWELL
Exactly. He’s *probably* an upgrade over Baynes but he’s in no way worth giving up Norman Powell.
You’ll get to see first hand now how Drummond isn’t actually good. Haynes may be dust but at least he’s cheap and won’t cost Norman Powell. This is still a 6-7 seed with Drummond
Isn’t norman Powell probably better than Drummond?
Norman Powell is way better than Kelly Oubre lmao
shoutout to the raptors for picking him up for 2 2nd rounders aron baynes and norman powell and probably matt thomas to make salary match and then they waive poor matt thomas
I feel insulted that you mentioned PJ Tucker in the same sentence as Norman Powell.
"Hmmm good point. We get love for development but perhaps you’re right. Derozan at 9 was solid. Of course OG and pascal. Roy hibbert and Terrence Ross were decent. PJ tucker. Mighty Mouse Damon stoudamire. But to be honest, yeah, I wouldn’t place us very high in drafting. Development and evaluation we are killing it (Terrence Davis 3, freddy, Boucher, Norman Powell all G leaguers)"
"Every time I see the name Norman Powell, Lana del Rey tunes pop into my head"
"From what I’ve seen, it looks like his ceiling is wade with a jump shot and his floor is like a Norman Powell, with oladipo probably being the in between/most likely"
PG: Kyle Lowry  SG: Norman Powell  SF: Peja Stojakovic  PF: Draymond Green  C: Yao Ming
"It just isn't possible. Curry shot 66% at the rim, 60% in floater territory and 45% from 3 (the equivalent of a 67.5% rim finisher). You'd literally have to be shooting over 70% at the rim, and over 40 whilst basically not taking any midrange shots. And Curry led the league then but with the way the game has evolved there will absolutely be a player who averages basically the same TS on like 20ppg. Norman Powell was basically doing that in Toronto (65% I think), and then just another hyper efficient star like Lavine who doesn't have quite the volume but could edge the player out in TS.  I just don't think it's realistic to expect that efficiency from a player and not expect it from someone else in the league when we are now seeing guys with 40 inch verticals come in with above average 3pt shooting. Steph and Dame barely get above the rim but by next season there will be 3 SGs Drafted in the last 3 drafts with 38-40+ inch verts and shoot like 38-40% on 3s in AE, Green and Hardy. If one of them is averaging a higher volume the other will probably beat efficiency."
"Norman Powell played small forward at 6'3"" this season."
Norman Powell and RoCo
GSW:  2015: Norman Powell  2016: Malcolm Brogdon  2018: Gary Trent jr  2019: Kelvin Johnson (need a forward)  2020: Lamelo Ball
"Look at where the Raptors were before he got there and what they’ve accomplished since. Perennial lottery team and laughing stock to averaging 50+ wins and having the best accumulative record over 7 years.   Look at his draft record. He consistently pulls premium players out of late picks and the 2nd round (Norman Powell, Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby).  Look at his eye for talent where no one else looks. Picking up undrafted players every off-season who quickly become impact players.  (Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Terence Davis)   Look at his trade history.   In Denver he traded Carmelo to the Knicks where everyone knew he was going to go anyway but got a huge haul of young players + picks including the pick that became Jamal Murray.   He gets to Toronto and unloads Andrea Bargnani  for a package that would include a top 10 pick in 2016 which would later help him to secure Kawhi Leonard.   Then he begins swindling the league  John Salmons = Lou Williams (who then won 6MOTY)   Grieves Vasquez = picks that became Norman Powell and OG Anunoby   Terence Ross + a late 1st = Serge Ibaka   Derozan, Poeltl + a late 1st = Kawhi Leonard + Danny Green + 5M in cash   Valanciunas + Delon Wright = Marc Gasol   There isn’t an executive in the league that matches Masai’s overall excellence in every aspect of front office operations."
Man fuck norman powell. Hate his ass. Always going off on us. Man didn't do shit in the sixers series than decides to pop off against us at the worst time. I'm still salty af about that double OT game 3. If that mf norman powell even just had a slightly worse game we'd be heading to the finals.  Thank god we got ours now tho. Definitely helps soothe the bad memories.
"You're focusing on the age too much imo. And my bad, I glossed over that 16mil for sure, but he is/was for sure a beast on the defensive end so I'm not surprised to see more. A 28 yr old on a new contract isn't really getting anything different than a 30 year old. Once you're 28 you usually kinda are what you are and a 3 year contract at either age isn't gonna be much different of a net gain or loss on the last year.  But you can go around most any player with stats like OP's. The 15m mark isn't really touched from what I can find (gladly be proven wrong, I haven't looked too deep or anything). It can be in specific circumstances, but it isn't the norm. Even GTJ is ""only"" getting 18m a year and his upside is pretty huge compared to this average player. Or Norman Powell whose new deal is also 18m a year. I don't think an average player (who's at the age of likely no significant improvement) deserves to be within 3m of those guys."
The Nets just need to hire the Raptors as consultants on how to murder deer. There are two very simple methods:  1. Have a child before the series.   2. Be Norman Powell.
Raptors was running a ton of it for Norman Powell and Fred Vanvleet in recent years
Norman Powell???
"Norman Powell, Tobias Harris, Jrue Holiday, Hayward, Randle, Jarrett Allen, Hield, Norman Powell, etc you gotta overpay your key rotation guys a lot of the time, even if they're not your traditional superstars / All-Stars."
"Nope, the Warriors have Klay/Iggy/Green who are far better defenders than what, Covington and nobody? Plus Klay is a much better 3rd option than 6'3 Norman Powell."
"Barns would really help you guys.  I felt bad for you when Aaron Gordon went to Denver.  He would have been a way better return for Gary Tent Jr. than Norman Powell was, but I don't think Portland had the fist round pick to offer (because you sent your 2021 pick to Houston for Covington)."
Yeah Jamal wasn't the one getting erased from playoff games by Norman Powell
"I mean Joe Harris, Jeff Green, and Shamet are pretty much better shooters than anyone left on the Warriors in 2019 after Klay got injured. Blake was also very good once he moved to Brooklyn.  Pretty much everyone outside of Draymond/Iggy were like out of rotations the very next year. Alfonzo McKinnie, Quinn Cook, Shaun Livingston, injured Boogie weren't rotation quality players. And the two guys who were in Dray/Iggy are poor shooters who defenders will happily not guard - even an injured Harden receives more defensive attention.  The 2019 Raptors were also a better team than the 2021 Bucks. Kawhi was at the height of his game and EVERY single player on the Raptors was a very good defender and a good shooter and most of them good playmakers too. FVV, Lowry, Siakam, Gasol all good passers for their position while being able to shoot and defend, and then Danny Green, Norman Powell, Ibaka all being more 3 and D (+ more for powell)."
"At this point probably Simmons, another player who is up there is wiggins due to his contract.  Lavine, SGA and Norman Powell are incredibly efficient scorers (although norm struggled in portland). I have Lavine and SGA in my top 20.  Derozan gets left out quite a lot.  Christian Wood is better than Karl-Anthony Towns  Brogdon is better than Sabonis, as is myles turner."

"Norman was expecting a big pay day, I'm sure Boucher could get traded. Idk if Boucher is expecting close to 20 million like Powell but I could be wrong."
"That was a lot more true of Norman Powell than of Boucher, and the Raptors traded him last offseason for a younger player in GTJ, so I don't think the front office is on the same page as you.  Boucher's the kind of roleplayer that has more value to a contending team than to a rebuilding team, and he's due to get paid. It doesn't make sense for our team to pay him as much in free agency as it will for other teams - we'd be locking ourselves into the current core, and the current core is not good enough to contend, so that would be a mistake.  I'm not saying throw him away either - at $7 mil, it would be easy for a contender to find room for him, and at his level of production, what they would be willing to trade for him would be worth more than what the team would get by retaining him. It's possible no deal materializes, but it just seems really likely that some team will need an upgrade and will be willing to offer a deal."

"His picks are almost always the best player available. Norman Powell with pick #46 is insane, look at the players drafted above and below him. Only real mis-step is Poeltl over Sabonis in 2016.  Also I don't think he has ever lost a trade in his time with the Raptors."
"If you move Norman Powell to the 2, you have a decent defender at the 2 and your backcourt isn't undersized and getting cooked at both positions."
Kidd was so enamored with every tall point guard to the point he gave Raps a first and a second for Vasquez that turned into Norman Powell and OG Anunoby
"Because that’s not how it works. Same way the Bucks “drafted” Norman Powell— they technically did, but only because that pick was being sent to Toronto immediately after the fact. In all ways that matter, the Raptors drafted him"
"It was assuming you consider Schroeder as a starting caliber guard. Which he was for the entire season barring the playoffs.  The rate for starting caliber guards is around 20m, see what Robinson, FVV, Brogdon, Norman Powell, all make.   Bench players however cap out around 15m or so, Jordan Clarkson money.   I agree you dodged a bullet, but that is more due to the locker room issues that Schroeder seems to have brought to the Lakers this season. The reason he didn't get that money from other teams is that this offseason there were a TON of guards on the market who were clearly better than Schroeder, at a similar price point. Guys like Derozan, Norman Powell, Lonzo Ball, Conley, Dinwiddie, GTJ. Teams spent money on those guys and that left little to no money for Schroeder from the teams that needed guards, while the teams that didn't need guards didn't go after him anyways as their money was better spent elsewhere."
"Look, Norm is an upgrade on GTJ, sure. That doesn't change the fact that a team starting Dame, CJ, and Norman Powell together has a *very* low defensive ceiling. GTJ was the only young guy on your roster who looked any good— flipping him for a better player was *fine,* Norm is good value for him, but now you guys are pretty hard locked into a core that doesn't have championship upside. Would GTJ's development have changed that? Probably not, but at least there was a *chance* he could've turned into something better. Norm is who he is. Short of the Sixers deciding that CJ plus picks is enough for Simmons, I don't see what options y'all have left."
"Sadly, they can’t do much at this point. They just resigned Norman Powell and hope for different results with a new coach."
"&gt; why did Portland sign Norman Powell and act like that was a successful offseason?  Lol show me all these portland fans saying we had a successful offseason because we signed norm.    There was excitement about signing norm for two reasons  1) the deal was very good and even if we blow it up he will be a great asset making only 18mil through his prime  and   2) if he walked for nothing we not only gave up a good asset for nothing, but we also have ZERO route at improving.  Our only real chance at getting significantly better was a CJ trade, and really you need Powell to be able to do that so he can take his spot.  Powell leaves and might as well blow it up reglardless of Dame asking for a trade."
"I mean this in THE nicest way possible Portland Fans, r/nba, why did Portland sign Norman Powell and act like that was a successful offseason? Does he really do anything to move the needle?"
They re-signed Norman Powell. That's something
Yeah I mean individually I think the only guy in their rotation that wasn't a clear cut plus/positive on defence was Norman Powell and he's no scrub either.
"Yes, Norman Powell is on a fine contract.   My point is if the initial reports or whatever were true, that they only traded GTJ because they didn't want to pay him (and stay out of luxury tax), then that was a mistake.  Folks seem to think Powell is better though so maybe that was actually why they made the trade."
"We made the same move after trading for and drafting Gary Trent Jr. We actually used our BAE to sign him to a 3 year deal which gave us full bird rights (which in turn, made him valuable enough to trade for Norman Powell who we just re-signed for 5 years, 18 million).  What I'm getting at is, deals like this can matter in a HUGE way."
"Problem is, not every team has a line of former All-Stars begging to play for them on a vet min. Lowry was off as soon as the magnificent city of Miami blessed him with the honor of living there. DeRozan was a huge overpay from the Bulls. A similar offer to us would be Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell. ""Oh, but those players are replaceable, role players, yadayada"". If you see our rotations in the Clippers series, you will see that we had to give significant minutes to Nicollo Melli, currently on a non-Euroleague team. If you see the games, you will notice how half of our possessions were wasted with Melli or a gassed DFS bricking a corner 3.  We brought defenders. We have now a rotation of wings that can switch 1-4 AND can handle their own on open shots. We could've paid DeRozan, yes, at the expense of THJ, but we could. We wouldn't, however, have any defensive depth on the wings. We would require again vet min contracts, and, unlike the almighty Los Angeles Lakers, the players that considers the vet min for us are *slightly* worse than Nunn and Monk.   Dinwiddie probably wanted to be a clear cut starting PG, considering his plan B was the Pelicans. Lonzo could've been attainable with the right price. Chicago's offer was better than the one that we could offer, but maybe we could've convinced Lonzo to force a move here. Maybe we did, but it did not work. Norman Powell signed on a steal for Portland, cheaper than THJ on production, but, again, the difference isn't that big.   Nico did what he could. He did not hinder the team going for the fences in a nutjob trade for a #2, he did not sit and waited for the Kawhi's pseudo tour while allowing every FA to walk. He took a position of deep need, signed 2 market-friendly contracts in THJ and Bullock and a steal in Sterling Brown. We still have the TPE that we can use to either add a passer (I want us to talk with the Pels for Sato) or a prolific offensive option (maybe Markkanen will accept a discount to play with Luka)."
"Kyrie’s post game is beautiful, just mindgaming defenders  Norman Powell when he’s not relegated to catch &amp; shoot 3s. Just super explosive and well rounded"
Him being in the same tier with Wiggins and Norman Powell is ridiculous.
"Norman Powell, Richaun Holmes, kevon Looney when he isn't injured, Larry Nance Jr,   Yeah the draft not only has several.multi time all stars but a lot of high quality starting level players too."
"Okay man, I hear you and I respect it. I think it’s a little brash to be so confident that Gary Trent is already as good as Norman Powell, but again I hear ya,"
"People bagging on the no moves from the blazers. Keep in mind we literally ROBBED Toronto for Norman Powell for Gary Trent, right before the playoffs last year, and we still lost to a beat up Denver team. The organization acquired norm thinking that was one of the “big moves” and people already forgot. We still have a good core and Powell is just starting to take off!"
"Maybe Kawhis in Toronto. I’ll admit there is a lil bit of bias as Kawhi is my favourite player of all time but that team was half constructed in a year. Relying on big roles to be played out by the likes of Norman Powell &amp; FVV, the later at the time really just breaking into the team. Lowry wasn’t respected as highly as he was until after that chip. 2nd round was against a very tough 76ers and only clutched it on a lucky bounce. Come from 2 down against a 60 win Bucks and their MVP.   I’m not saying it’s super favourable for this one to be the hardest road, that GSW was pretty beat up but still have it go, but I definitely think it’s an honourable mention.   For me personally tho it’s Hakeems Houston in 95. 6th seed to beat 3,2,1. Crazy odds"
"Many people believe that our chronic defensive woes are intrinsically linked to having two smallish/subpar defenders in our backcourt. It's obvious that our chip aspirations only go so far as our defense, and Dame has stated that our roster didn't look like a championship roster.  The idea is that replacing CJ is addition by subtraction -- yes, he's offensively gifted, but we already have Dame filling that role and there's only one ball, and as long as we feel compelled to run CJ at the 2 instead of someone whose size/defense/playstyle are complementary to Dame (like Norman Powell), our ceiling is real low and the same systemic defensive issues will be readily apparent as soon as the season starts... and then Dame throws up his hands and demands a trade.  I see three counter-arguments to this.  (1) What you just said above. When Dame talks about upgrading the roster, we're all interpreting that as ""well he clearly wants us to trade CJ,"" but he may not mean that at all and trading CJ will just gut any emotional connection he has to the city and franchise.  (2) Portland fans are tired of ""run it back"", deluding ourselves that we didn't get to truly see our hypothetical Big Three of Dame/CJ/Nurk because of injury issues each season. But when our team was healthy with Powell late in the season, our starters fared incredibly well while our bench was terrible. And that bore out in the playoff series we lost, too. Our starters turned up the defense to complement our historic offense, but a bench that plays significant minutes of Melo and Kanter at the same time is just gonna suck at defense, and that's where we lost our games. There's an argument that the data shows our starting 5 to actually be quite excellent, three guards and all, and that it's worth running that part of the roster back as long as we significantly upgrade our bench.   (3) As long as we've had Dame and CJ as a defensively liable backcourt, they've been coached by Terry Stotts and played under his defensive systems. Everyone's forgetting that we have a new coach now, one whose legacy is inextricably tied to defense. It's hard to know conclusively that the Dame+CJ experiment is ultimately a failure for defensive reasons until we see them operating under a new coach and under a different defensive scheme.   Where do I land?  I'm a sucker for narrative and like rooting for a team where the underdogs they draft become best friends on court and off, stick up for each other, and make it work despite what the talking heads and airmchair GMs say. So I'm optimistic about reasons 1 through 3. But I will say that if this team looks to be in depressingly familiar waters halfway through the season, it'll be clear that the addition-by-subtraction strategy needs a try."
Norman Powell
totally unbiased but norman powell earlier in the season against the hawks (88 percent free throw shooter) missed two clutch free throws that led to tony snell's game winner. totally unbiased btw
Norman Powell in shambles. Lol
Norman Powell at 90m just doesnt seem like effecient use of funds
Norman Powell wasn’t enough ? How much help does Dame need!!!!!!  /s
Or turning 26 games of Greivis Vasquez into OG Anunoby and Norman Powell
"""Who's still on the board?  Myles Turner, Devin Booker, Cam Payne, Kelly Oubre, Terry Rozier, Delon Wright, Bobby Portis, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Larry Nance, Kevin Looney, Montrezl Harrell, Richaun Holmes, Josh Richardson, and Norman Powell?  Nope - we gotta get Kaminsky!""  -Michael Jordan, 2015"
Trading greivis Vasquez for what would become Norman Powell and OG Anunoby is easily his most underrated move.
That's why i said Norman Powell. Powell is very efficient inside (60+%).  The question was more about playing style and movement. How it looks. Powell as a driver reminds me the most of Monta.
I’d just want to see Norman Powell or Robert Covington being traded in exchange for an Oubre S&amp;T just to see this sub explode.   It’s more of a pipe dream but it’d be glorious.
"Thanks for the response.  I guess when I say ""terrible supporting cast,"" I mean in comparison to championship-caliber teams.  I don't believe that Dame has ever had a championship-quality team around him, or even close to one.  Damian's Trailblazers have always just been a 'good' team, but never great (again, just my opinion).  I don't think they'll be anywhere close to great just by adding Norman Powell. They need to rebuild while they can. Get some valuable pieces for Dame, C.J., and Robert Covington, and try again. What they're doing now is just wasting his career. He's loyal, but to a fault. If he wants to win a championship, it's not going to be with the Trailblazers. That's no fault of his own; upper management is to blame for not doing enough."
"Jalen Harris became the 10th different player on the Raptors to score 30 points in a game last season. He joined: Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Kyle Lowry, Gary Trent Jr., OG Anunoby, Stanley Johnson and Paul Watson.  5 of those names are likely not returning so we have 5 now."
"Norman Powell gets $90mil, that's a mistake I rather have the blazers doing than the Lakers.  Also, you fail to mention he had 0 points against the suns on the most important game of the season. Drummond can also get 15-20 a night yet be completely useless.   I'm not saying he is unlikable garbage, I'm just rating him on the terms he set for himself, want $100 mil? Play $100.  To give more than $30 mil to him is to shoot your franchise in the foot.   Good role player who wants to be 2nd or 3rd option but doesn't have what it takes, big mouth and small actions. Funny thing I could be talking about Kelly Oubre Jr without having to change anything."
"Bruh, this is such an overreaction. He had a solid season personally despite a shitty season for the team. He wasn’t a shooter but he can put up 15-20 any night with excellent defense at the point of attack.   You also fail to mention he was a big reason Lakers won games 2 and 3 in the playoffs. AD went down and the whole team basically gave up, can’t pin that on Dennis. He’s not worth what he thinks he’s worth, but he’s not the unlikeable garbage you make him out to be. Cmon man.  With his production and comparable contracts around the league, he wasn’t being that unfair with his expectations. Norman Powell got $90 mil man."
the internet would be like who is norman powell and duncan robinson and why do i care
Pretty sure you missed the part where i said in a 2 month strech where he had to carry the load with an injured team while staying efficient at it.   I can almost guarantee I've watched the dude play way more than you have being a raptors fan and this yr was his breakout yr where he pretty much put it all together at times looked like a top 2 guard in the game literally having games scoring 25 on 10 shots. scoring 23 ppg on damn near 50 40 90 while being asked to completely carry the load isn't something your everyday starter does at the nba level.   https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/norman-powell-february-to-march  It's hard to be very effective when lillard and mccolum dominate the basketball and you're relegated to simply stand in the corner
Could have done something over the past 3 seasons. What's the biggest move yall have made? Trade for Covington? Norman Powell?
"""He probably just thought he was younger because nobody knew who he was until last year""  ""Duncan Robinson is 27, Norman Powell is 28, and this whole thing makes no fucking sense.""  Lmao are you good bro?"
"It was pretty strong to end the season, but ran into a specific issue that Denver started 2 6'10 forwards and we had to put 6'3 Norman Powell on one of them... Aaron Gordon and MPJ's stats fell significantly going from the POR series to the PHO series.    There is something to be said for trying to run it back.  Hope the team is healthy most of the year, learns to play better defense, younger guys get better, Nurk/CJ in better shape.  However we badly need a SF."
I checked out when he casually floated a D'aaron Fox trade for RJ + Obi and picks. Yes. *Picks.* Why? Because apparently NYK needed a PG that bad and were destined to get fleeced for one. But this Norman Powell take was terrible.
"Norman Powell has played over 200 more games than Duncan Robinson, so Robinson seems newer and younger with less experience, and thus more room to grow"
"Not entirely true. He was traded for the picks that ended up being OG Anunoby and Norman Powell, so at least there's that."
"I mean, Norman Powell has played 6 season to Duncan Robinsons 3..."
Duncan Robinson is a better 3 point shooter than Norman Powell. That's it
"Age matters, but Norman Powell is going into his 8th NBA season while Duncan Robinson is going into his 4th. It's not that weird to think Powell is what he is while Robinson still has room to get better."
"Nah, the Norman Powell official announcement took a couple hours after his cryptic tweet"
"With this along with the “no father figure” bullshit, it’s getting harder to not say he’s got an unconscious racial bias. He’s always overrating white players, and to say that Norman Powell has less potential than Duncan Robinson(and this is not a slight to Duncan Robinson) is a horrible, horrible take. Like, bordering on objectively wrong, as it’s clear that Powell is the more rounded basketball player *and* has more NBA experience.  I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again: I don’t understand why anyone would want to get their basketball news an analysis from this guy."
"&gt;Norman Powell  There's also an experience factor playing here. Other than winning you know a championship Powell's been in the league since 2015, Robinson since 2018. Powell is entering his prime as a NBA player(not talking age) and his productivity has increased. Duncan has not reached that point yet and there is still room for improvement. There is upside to both players and they equally deserve to get paid. At the end of the day he's out of his mind to say that someone like Powell doesn't deserve money but someone like Robinson does. Makes you think the real reasoning behind the comment."
"They were actually born **less than 11 months apart** (332 days, to be exact):  Norman Powell - born 5/25/1993  Duncan Robinson - born 4/22/1994"
Norman powell is much better than robinson lol
Norman Powell is actually only less than a year older than Duncan which makes it worse.
And he is a motherffing scorer. In today’s NBA you pay for scorers.  I know Simmons doesn’t watch a lot of basketball if it doesn’t have do with the Celtics.  Norman Powell is a bucket getter.  Edited - and he plays defence!
"Lol when I saw Norman Powell for $90m I thought ""damn he only getting Duncan Robinson money??"""
"Norman Powell has played extremely well the past 3 straight seasons and he is 27, right in his prime.  This deal is a no brainer Bill!"
Duncan Robinson will never be as good as Norman Powell
Duncan Robinson is 27 years old. Norman Powell is 28 years old. This whole take makes no fucking sense. Stupid take from Simmons.

"Here's the snippet from the ""report"" in question:  &gt;The Blazers **have shown no inkling they intend** to move on from Damian Lillard or C.J. McCollum, and have a slew of their own free agents—Norman Powell, most notably, plus guaranteeing the $12 million for the final year of Jusuf Nurkić’s contract, which Portland is expected to do—to deal with. Ex-Blazer Nicolas Batum is on Portland’s radar, per a source, with the Blazers projecting to be limited with what they can spend by their $5.3 million mid-level exception.  This is simply speculation from Mannix on what the Blazers might do based on what he had (or hadn't) heard from his or other league sources. The problem with that is that while our FO has its issues, the one thing it has been very good at is keeping roster moves under wraps until they happen. The last time anyone in the org leaked accurate news ahead of time was when LMA was leaving and that assistant got fired.  Essentially, when you hear the Blazers are involved in a trade, it's either not happening or it's already a done deal. It's when you don't hear anything that a trade comes out of nowhere."
CJ and Norman Powell for Ben Simmons confirmed.
"No, that’s Norman Powell."
"If Portland can find a way to trade DJJ for a player making 3M or less, that would open up the full MLE for him. Would love to pair him up with his old buddy Norman Powell."
I don’t think the Pelicans should have handed out any of the contracts that got handed out. Even Norman Powell got a 5 year deal. I don’t see really any that made sense for the Pels and even Lowry most people thought didn’t make sense. The Pels have no bad contracts and got a couple wings in the draft and are probably gonna make 1-2 more moves. Roster looks to be shaping up better than last year. I mean hell they replaced Bledsoe and Adams with Graham and JV that’s already a pretty good improvement. I think it’s a little over reaction to say it’s a disaster not to get any big names day 1 in FA when your star is 21 and has played 80 games.
"* NBA Free Agency big deals so far  *Alex Caruso and Lonzo Ball on the Bulls.   *Trae Young signed a 5yr 207 million dollar contract to the Atlanta Hawks.   *Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has agreed to a five-year, $172 million for the OKC Thunder.   *Spencer Dinwiddie is going to the Washington Wizards.  *Blake Griffin is staying in Brooklyn for one year.  *Norman Powell has signed a 5yr 90 million dollar deal with the Portland Trail Blazers.   *Derrick Rose is staying with the New York Knicks for 3yr, 43 million dollar contract.   *Trevor Ariza is signing a 1yr contract with the Los Angeles Lakers.  *Kyle Lowry is signing a 3yr and $90m dollar contract for the Miami Heat.   *Chris Paul is staying with the Phoenix Suns for 4yrs and 120 million dollars.   *All-Star guard Mike Conley has agreed to a three-year, $72.5M contract to stay with the Utah Jazz.   *Jarrett Allen has agreed to a five-year, $100 million contract to stay with the Cleveland Cavaliers.  *Tim Hardaway Jr.'s four-year deal with the Mavericks is worth $74M.   *Richaun Holmes has agreed to a four-year deal worth as much as $55 million to return to the Sacramento Kings.  *Devonte' Graham is signing with the Pelicans via sign-and-trade.   *Jimmy Butler is expected to agree to a maximum contract extension with the Miami Heat."
It's a lot considering the Blazers signed Norman Powell (who is a much much better player) for the same amount.
"Norman ""Norman Powell"" Powell"
You thinking 18 mil a year for Norman Powell is an overpay just tells me you don't know what you're talking about
Maybe I’m being too high on THJ but he’s definitely better than Norman Powell
We were trying for Norman Powell but you can’t force a guy to sign
Norman “not now Norman!” Powell
My favorite is Stormin’ Norman Powell
Norman Powell puts the ball in the hoop better
"If Mavs want to go aggressive this FA, they could have gone after Fournier (will probably wait it out) or Norman Powell (needs some convincing to leaver the Blazers), or they could've gone for younger guys (and probably cheaper but can still be developed) like Gary Trent Jr., Furkan Korkmaz, or Malik Monk. But Mavs wants to play it safe I guess because once bitten, twice shy. They played the waiting game too many times in the past and got nothing from it."
"Pelicans gonna sign Norman Powell, and than he gonna ride the bench when Alexander-Walker start to cook"
I have this horrifying dream that the Blazers sign-and-trade Norman Powell for Dennis Schroder as part of that deal for Westbrook and I'm really scared
"That team was so stacked now that I think about it..  Kyle Lowry  Danny Green  Kawhi Leonard  Pascal Siakam  Marc Gasol  Fred VanVleet  Norman Powell  OG Anunoby   Serge Ibaka  A solid 9 man rotation with a perfect blend of offense and defense.. and that’s not including guys like Chris Boucher, Patrick McCaw or Jeremy Lin"
Announce Norman Powell next you coward
Dude got Norman Powell and OG from Grevis Vasquez
I wouldn’t be surprised if we end up paying Norman Powell 25m a year to keep him
Depends how recent.   Trading Batum for Noah Vonleh and Gerald Henderson was a terrible move made even worse by us lacking a player with Batums exact skill set since he left  Will Barton + other stuff for Aaron Afflalo + stuff. Made sense at the time but Will Barton would have been great on the post LMA team  GTJ for Norman Powell. Powell is “better” but trading a guard for another guard when we desperately needed a forward was dumb and I also enjoyed watching GTJ more
Remember when Bill Simmons said that Duncan Robinson was worth more than Norman Powell because he's more versatile and can shoot the 3? Goes to show that Bill Simmons had probably never watched Norm play.
"Oh totally, it’s why NBA GMs/executives do what they do and we just talk about it.  It’s one thing to point out a hole in a team / thought / ideology / mechanism / whatever. It’s a whole other beast to recognize that flaw, then have the ability to remedy that weak point without creating more gaps or issues for the whole.  I can sit here and say the Suns need a player like PJ Tucker, Draymond Green as a PF (or even Bembry). Or say they need a Bogdanovic, Seth Curry, Danny Green as a SG. Or a Harrison Barnes, OG Anounoby, Norman Powell at SF. But how can they do that without giving up the things that make them good / or creating more holes?  That I don’t know."
hope norman powell is ok 🙏
"With Trent as the 2nd option you’ll never do anything significant. He’s a good third option on a team (like Norman Powell, THJ, Barnes etc.)"
"Siakam didn't develop until Casey was gone. Casey himself said that Siakam was like Bruce Brown for him. Would come in and guard and would never shoot unless it was the last option.  The time Siakam spent w Casey he was a rebounder and didn't even bring the ball up the floor and we didn't see anything that made him a menace in transition.  Casey can be credited for: developing DeRozan, JV, Norman Powell, Terrence Ross, and a few select others.  When Nurse got here we saw the development of OG, Siakam, and others.  With that said, credit for these guys should go to the 905 and not Casey."
Our franchises became friends last year after the Norman Powell / Gary Trent Jr. trade.  We are the North.
It's time we collectively acknowledge Norman Powell is a really bad defender.
I forgot how insane it is that the Raptors ended up with OG Anunoby and Norman Powell (which became Gary Trent Jr) for just Greivis Vasquez
Weren't you guys just harping praise one over the other post the Norman Powell trade?
"The 2019 Raptors had one of the most relentless defenses ever despite not having the same leeway defenses today have. They also happen to be one of the deepest benches, to the point that Norman Powell, normally a solid starter or 6th man, was only playing 16 minutes per game. That along with a great coach and a Superstar that can keep up with Steph’s caliber of play and I’m taking the 2019 Raptors."
"Shout out to Stormin' Norman Powell for his [Superman dunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVWEIZ8aV3s) with the added benefit of being late in the 4th to tie the game.  Honestly when he went up for the dunk I thought he would botch it, no way he could dunk from that far out. Leaning dunks are the coolest."
He’s not as good of a penetrator but he’s a purer shooter with an array of advanced foot work and his defense is significantly better than Norman Powell.
"Would love to see Dame make it, but wouldn’t be surprised to see him not make this year. Just leaves room to get Norman Powell in anyway"
Should've been fired for having Norman Powell at the 3 and Cj at the 2 in the west. That's BBQ chicken for players like Kawhi and LeBron.
5 year contract to Norman Powell? Wow
"I wouldn't even give Norman Powell for the dude, let alone CJ. You can't teach a good attitude."
They'd be lucky to get a Norman Powell type player at this point.
"&gt; Norman Powell isn’t even a 20 ppg scorer he’s a 17 or 18 ppg guy at best.  Literally put up 19ppg on 65% TS last year, and was actually at 20ppg over 40 games before he came here and started playing alongside Dame and CJ.    We would GLADLY give up scoring for defense.  Especially when our biggest offensive problem in teh playoffs anyway is who runs the 4v3 when Dame gets trapped, another thing Simmons would be good at."
"Nah Blazers give up too much scoring.  Covington, Nurkic, LNJ, are all their front court players that aren’t scoring much now you trade your 2nd best scorer for Ben Simmons’ 10 ppg in R2 and it’s the Dame show and you need him dropping 40+ to have a chance.  Norman Powell isn’t even a 20 ppg scorer he’s a 17 or 18 ppg guy at best."
"This is backfiring on both Ben Simmons and Daryl Morey. No way do I even endorse  trading Norman Powell for this dude, let alone CJ."
"Ya the same team that had their best player siakam injured for most of the year. Same with Norman Powell who is no longer on the team. You really think the raptors aren’t better than the magic, raptors and Pistons? If you really think Lowry was their best player last year LOL. He was injured all year too"
"Norman Powell plays SF and he is 6'3""."
That's not stopping Norman Powell is it
"Whatchu got against Norman Powell, fam"
"Defense exists, look at Norman Powell on the Blazers for reference.  Then replace him with an already bad defender."
Norman Powell
It'd probably have to be Simmons. For all of CJ's faults - he's a decent secondary ballhandler next to Dame.  It does make sense to move Norman Powell down to the 2 but he's a scoring guy not a playmaker. Ben would boost their perimeter D and work great next to Dame although spacing would be an issue.
Norman Powell -29 yikes
Lillard for Norman Powell
yeah they're major homers. they totally ignored a sick norman powell block in the first half lol
Norman Powell has never lost to the Lakers.
"Best: Norman Powell is absolutely crushing it. Worst: Well, where do you want me to start?"
Ok Norman Powell
"Now you are just biased. You can’t honestly look at “The Process” and dismiss the black eye and and skid marks on the drawls in Philly of the last few years in Philly. For Portland; playoff streak, [family oriented culture](https://www.blazersedge.com/2021/4/21/22396534/norman-powell-discusses-portland-trail-blazers-importance-of-family) (remember, we can’t all be young socialites.) Nike and Adidas headquarters, amazing food, worst case couple hour flight to LA, Seattle, Vegas. Don’t act like Oregon is the backwoods to a millionaire."
Norman Powell is an absolute blessing
He should rest.  I don't think the Blazers will drop that many games in his absence if they are willing to unleash Norman Powell.
Norman Powell underrated fr
Norman Powell is insanely underused he should 100% be getting more shots than Mccollum
Norman Powell seems to love playing us.  Great shot.
I wonder if Norman Powell and Dwight Powell are related
Lebron would be a better fit with Damian Lillard than Norman Powell
"Then....Occam's razor.     Make the G-League playoffs more prominently known.     If you're indicating that it's already in the time span, just make the g league playoffs more important in the span of the all star break.     It's unrealistic but make the G-League playoffs matter to nba fans.     I know for some teams, the G League is important. I'm looking at the 905 cause that's where Siakam, Vanvleet, Delon Wright, Poetl, Norman Powell Boucher and a few other of their guys came up. Jeremy Lin also came up there yeah?     It would be scuffed but tying some kind of incentive for the parent teams would make the G League matter more."
"How did Norman Powell, Duncan Robinson, Jarret Allen or John Collins sign a 5yr deal for 90-125 mill last summer?"
Storming Norman Powell is so damn confident on the drive
"Dude his value isn’t even enough to get Norman Powell at this point. Any team that’s considering trading for him is asking themselves:  “Does he actually have mental health issues?”  “Is he even going to play for us?”  “If he does play, how much can we rely on him to actually put in effort? He clearly doesn’t care much about winning”  “If shit goes south, is he going to fake mental health issues at the first sign of adversity”"
Norman Powell looked extra handsome tonight
Norman Powell is up there  17 a game on 65% TS%
"If Lauri was out there, the SF matchup could have been Norman Powell vs. Evan Mobley."
"Bench Mob (FVV, Delon Wright/Norman Powell, CJ Miles, Poeltl + Siakam aka Yak &amp; Skills) will always hold a special place in my heart."
"And VanVleet, Norman Powell, Siakam and Poeltl coming off the fucking bench. Nvm too absurd."
Norman Powell in the 40s in 2015 as well
GTJ &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your favourite SG… not named Norman Powell.
Went from having a deal on the table for harden last year to “Norman Powell is too good for Ben Simmons”. Norms a fine player but damn
"Norman Powell and CJ we’re not good enough to overcome the Sixers without $100 million of salary on the floor.   Good players, but Ben’s impact with a true playmaker lime Dame would be much better"
If this keeps going it will probably be CJ Elleby and picks. lol   Norman Powell or CJ McCollum is too good for just Ben Simmons at this point in time. Philly will have to throw in a pick or two if they want CJ McCollum.
"“Teams” includes the Sixers, who are just as likely to get more desperate as any other team. CJ McCollum being the best player they can get for Ben, could easily turn into Norman Powell being the best player they can get for Ben. Morey isn’t doing anything other than gambling, he could luck out and look smart, or he could end up looking like a complete fool."
"Same. I was listening to Brian Windhorst’s podcast and they were talking about it.   Some players on the committee are CP3, Lowry, and Norman Powell IIRC"
"Trade idea:   Sixers get:   * Dame Lillard  Blazers get:   * Jaylen Brown  * Marcus Smart   * Tyrese Maxey  * Two Sixers 1sts  Celtics get:   * Ben Simmons  * Norman Powell  * Seth Curry  * One Sixers 1st  Sixers get their guy, run Dame/Milton/Green/Harris/Embiid  Blazers reset and remain competitive by running Smart/McCollum/Brown/RoCo/Nurkic   Celtics revamp and remain competitive by running Curry/Powell/Simmons/Tatum/Williams"
"Fair enough lmao, this dudes comments are just so bad though. He legitimately believes Jaylen Brown is the worst starter in the league &amp; is always talking about trading Jaylen + picks for Norman Powell &amp; other players of that caliber"

me: dope game. lemme check the highlights on r/nba  r/nba : a Norman Powell and 1 and a clip of fans chanting for Dame
"Alternatively the entire 2016 ECF Raptors run. Outside of the Champonship, the 2016 run was just something else. Lowry, Demar, Biyombo, JV, Norm.  Some great moments:  [Stormin' Norman Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uao0ZZ8r52s)  [Biyombo becoming a Raptor for life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Zf5bvHAgRQ)  [Also Biyombo blocking Lebron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFQprEop9M)"
"They turn into high level starters and all-stars for the Spurs and Raptors. See Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Kelvin Johnson, Siakam, FVV, Norman Powell."
"Even right now Norm is better. He’s a prototype 3 level scoring guard with solid defense and athleticism. Trent doesn’t have the athletic upside of Norman and is a far less efficient scorer.  We made the trade to save some money and get younger. It’s not very likely Trent becomes a significantly better player than Norman Powell, but if he becomes around as good as him in his prime the trade was well worth it to match the age of the new core guys on our team"
"I'm a simple man - I see Norman Powell, I upvote."
It makes sense for the Blazers because Norman Powell gives them a better chance to win now in the Damian Lillard era
NBA Champion Norman Powell
"Norman Powell would be a good pickup cause he brings defense and shooting, but idk what they would do with J rich"
I want to trade for Norman Powell but I don't think the Raptors would want any of our expiring players.
Norman Powell is another one they might trade
"For whatever reason, the broader NBA hasn't caught onto the fact that Norman Powell is not a good defender. That was his calling card coming into the league, but that hasn't really materialized. He makes a lot of errors and gambles on the defensive end. I'd say Norm is a below average defender.   Having said that, he does have a decent track record of being a 40% 3p shooter and a pretty good finisher at the rim. With the amount of cap space out there, I could see him getting stupid money from somebody (Evan Turner/Allan Crabbe money). I think he'll have his pick of teams at the 4 year full MLE and could get close to 15 mil per year if he finds the right team."
I wonder if you guys would go after Norman Powell as a bench spark option
I also like a Norman Powell on his day.

Norman Powell setting up Yuta Watanabe... this team is something else 😂
Norman Powell must strike the same kind of fear into Bucks fans that Jeremy Lamb does to us
"Norman ""Kevin Durant"" Powell"
Norman Powell
You wouldn't really have to give up any assets aside from Norman Powell who might be looking to get paid this offseason.
"Raptors would need to trade Norman Powell, but they could match salary with Powell, Aron Baynes, Patrick McCaw, and Stanley Johnson.   All four of those guys are expiring (Powell has a player option that he'll definitely decline)."
"How are you telling me to look up results based thinking when you are the one using the results to justify the process?   You: ""Yes. We draw conclusions from results. What else would you have us draw conclusions from?""  Also you: ""If you want something to do today look up results based thinking and see if you can apply the concept to anywhere in your life.""  You draw conclusions from the process, not from the results. FVV going nuclear in the last 4 games of the Bucks series does not justify the decision to continue to play him because nobody knew that he would go nuclear at the time the decision was made. Your argument in the previous comment that   &gt; FVV also helped them win those series with some amazing shooting nights. Nurse unequivocally made the right decision with FVV there.  justifies the decision to leave him in is the *definition* of results based analysis.   Jeremy Lin was not the only alternative, Norman Powell was playing well but limited to 68 minutes in the Sixers series while FVV played 118. Your line of thinking here is like saying a wide open Curry three was a bad shot because it missed."

"It's always a gamble.  Norman Powell, Otto Porter Jr,, will Barton, Ben McLemore...etc  Of course, players that are fairly consistent like Drummond will always show up and show up even better in contract years.  Everyone kind of already drafts them already."
I would not trade Norman Powell for Lonzo Rn
And then he shoved Norman Powell after getting scored on getting a T to end his night lmao
"Despite all the comedians ITT, he's worth probably isn't as high to most contending teams, especially due to his iso heavy play style and his average defense. It works well on the Knicks and a lot of tanking teams, but probably not so well elsewhere. Also, his salary is quite hard to move, making any trade difficult.   An argument could be made for his improved passing improving his value to a contender this season, but I'd say he's probably worth a combination of raw prospects/established role players and some seconds. Off the top of my head a few trades I think would be great are:  Mavericks: James Johnson, Tyrell Terry, two 2nd rounders  Raptors: Norman Powell, Aaron Baynes, 2nd rounder  Hornets: Cody Zeller, Malik Monk, 2nd rounder  Clippers: Lou Williams, Ivica Zubac"

They really don’t have the contracts. Unless you’ll send Norman Powell for Larry Nance.

"Fine, we'll take the clippers back, but they have to trade for Norman Powell"
"Houston Rockets: James Harden, Danuel House  Toronto Raptors: Pascal Siakim, Norman Powell.   Is the trade to happen."
give norman powell the green light and harden or lukas usage and we would all be surprised at how good he would be
"Not necessarily true. Second rounders vary in contracts. Some get the same a first rounder, some get shorter deals. I remember Norman Powell got a 3 year deal. Some sign 2-ways."
What happened to Norman Powell? Dude was amazing last year.
"If you were to tell me Stanley Johnson was out here outplaying Norman Powell, I'd think we were still stuck in 2020"
Did Norman Powell regress? Stanley johnson is better than him lol
"We just dont have enough guys that can play winning basketball and those that can, have started slow. Like this is our Championship rotation players:  Kyle Lowry - Still plays at a high level  Danny Green - Went to LA  Kawhi Leonard - Went to LA  Pascal Siakam - Plays at a high level. Had a slow start and has picked it back up, but his regression is completely exaggerated because of the bubble.   Marc Gasol - Went to LA  Fred VanVleet - Still plays at a high level but is sometimes inconsistent in scoring due to his size.  Norman Powell - Has looked like a shell of himself so far and his BBIQ looks like GoDaddy curse Norm from [year 3](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/powelno01.html).  OG Anunoby - His defense is good, but his shot has been off so far. We were hoping he would take a leap in the scoring department after the bubble, but he still can't create buckets for himself.  Serge Ibaka - Went to LA  So last season, we lost Kawhi and Danny but we were still able to compete at a high level because we had 7 solid players. Our depth wasnt the best which is why Nurse would heavily rely on the likes of our 7 Championship vets. [Look at the MPG for the playoffs last season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/TOR/2020.html)  While we played well, our two biggest weaknesses were rebounding and halfcourt offense, none of which were addressed in the offseason.  We also lost Gasol and Ibaka, who while looked like they were past their primes, provided solid defense at the rim and good offense. Marc couldnt score, but his passing was phenomenal, and Ibaka was able to get buckets consistently from midrange and 3. They both also brought a veteran poise and IQ to the team.  They were replaced with Alex Len and Aron Baynes. Baynes has struggling on offense, he cant even make open layups, and Alex Len, is a bonafide scrub.  So our bench mob became our starters and our bench is thin and full of gleaguers. Terrence Davis hasnt played much and is struggling a bit. Boucher has been great but he lack size.  So were a small team and a lot of our talent has been stripped. Our key vets have had some off games early and that can be attributed to getting adjusted with a new team as well as offcourt things like having to be in Tampa and essentially every game being a road one."
Norman Powell -10
Any Raptor fans wanna tell me what happened to Norman Powell? Dude has been ass
"Also Raps fans, did you guys forget about Norman Powell? I’ve seen a ton of people clowning on him as of late, but tonight he was 6- 8 on fgm, 4-5 on 3-pt made, and got to the line 6 times. Maybe this is what he needs to get going for the season."
"Death, taxes, Norman Powell in the starting lineup."
Terrence Ross had a 50 point game. Norman Powell has had weeks averaging points in the high 20s but he won't be winning a scoring title any time soon. People never learn.
Norman Powell
Hi we need big man. We give Aron Baynes and Norman Powell.
Norman Powell
"Sure lets blame Baynes for the Raptors problems but you have Norman Powell playing like ass and playing more minutes, and anyone with basketball knowledge knew the Raptors decline was coming sooner then later"
"He’s not a direct replacement for either, but he is filling roles they played. It’s not his fault they didn’t adequately fill a void he’s never had the skills to fill. How about focusing on Norman Powell? Where’s he at?"
"What is happening with Norman Powell? I had him as a sleeper 6MOTY contender but he's been shooting horribly so far, they need those fire Norm games"
"""Pascal had 32 points!""   ""That's good!""   ""But he missed some free throws in the clutch.""   ""That's bad.""   ""The Raptors outscored the Suns in points in the paint and fast break points!""   ""That's good!""   ""But they were badly outscored from the three point line.""   ""That's bad.""   ""Four of the Raptors' starters scored in double digits and Norman Powell also got double digits off the bench!""   ""That's good!""   ""But other than Norm the bench only scored 13 points and Aron Baynes had 0 as a starter.""   ""That's bad."""
But but laker fan told me he was a rotation player so why doesn’t he play well in every single game with no variance?  Also ignore Norman Powell Chris Boucher and OG
So basically Norman Powell 2.0
"Lowry, FVV, OG, Siakam, Boucher, Norman Powell (Trade asset), Flynn (on a rookie deal)."
Raptors and SGs that can dunk. In our brief history:  1. Vince Carter 2. DeMar DeRozan 3. Terrence Ross 4. Norman Powell
"The biggest thing is that when the Raps opened the third quarter with some fight, the Celts weren't fazed by it. Lowry was doing all his usual tricks like elbowing Tatum in transition, sticking his butt out as defenders fight through traffic. Tatum did not care. Last years Celtics would have gotten irritated. This time around, they just kept trucking. It was the best the Celts played all year too.  Also, Norman Powell... what happened to him? He has really declined. The other factor is not having Serge. Feels like there is not a good big that can hit threes for the Raps."
"tb to when a raptors fan was genuinely tryna argue that Norman Powell, a player that doesn’t even start on the Raptors, is better than Ben Simmons..."
"Masai and Nurse are fine, just we lack talent and need to retool. Trade Lowry for picks, roll the dice in the lottery, and get guys like Norman Powell, Aron Baynes, etc. the fuck off this team"
Who's the best rookie on the Raps? Is it Malachi Flynn or Norman Powell?
"Ok, last year during the second half, teams figured out Siakam. It slowed him down, but he still had confidence and had some genuinely good games, so we had hope. This year it's different than the bubble, he cant take two dribbles without mishandling the ball, he makes a shot or two in the beginning, and proceeds to miss 5. He's in his head and I don't really know what he should do going forward.  OG has been bad, but he's confident and taking shots, just a slump for him. FVV is pretty much as good as before, and so is Lowry. Norman Powell is in a bit of a slump but he's showing signs of life.  Our centers are abysmal other than Boucher, Baynes is inconsistent, like this game he's legit missing layups and Len also messes up a lot.  The main focus is Siakam though, idk man its just sad to watch, Im seeing him lose his game and I don't like it."
&gt;Siakam has been terrible. OG can't hit a three...Norman Powell lost his handles and is gunning for the title of lowest BBIQ player in the league. Our centers are trash (boucher is not starter material). Nurse's timeouts and substitutions have been poor.Offense...defense...everything is bad this year. I am sad.

Pascal Siakam+Norman Powell for Buddy Hield+Marvin Bagley who says no?
Norman Powell was legit like our best scorer after that stretch.
Don't forget Norman Powell
"norman powell really slapped bi in the head on a bad double and people are saying ""refball"""
norman powell always doing some fuckery as the help defender LMAOO
Wasn’t Donovan Mitchell player comparison Norman Powell or Monte Ellis?  I think that Russ came into the league as a defensive specialist iirci  Gilbert Arenas is a good one too
All-NBA ball hog team:   PG: Kyrie   SG: Jordan Clarkson   SF: Norman Powell  PF: Julius Randle   C: Andre Drummond
Why is this like the 5th time I've seen Norman Powell unnecessarily take it to the rack on the fast break only to completely miss the rim?
how did i know norman powell wasn’t gonna pass the ball 😂
yea the other 2 were falling after the norman powell screens lol
"I'm so jealous of how the Raptors can turn late-round picks like Norman Powell and undrafted players like FVV and Chris Boucher into fringe All-Star players. The Celtics are incredibly incompetent at developing players as of late and/or the Celtics are also incredibly bad at picking good prospects. Either way, the Raptors may have one of the best head coach/GM combos in the league while the Celtics are among the worst. Really hate how things turned out because the Celtics had a ton of assets and Brad Stevens/Danny Ainge wasted them all."
Norman Powell for the Milwaukee Bucks
"I didn’t.  Rodman, Rashad Lewis, Danny Green, Ainge, Milsap, Ariza, DJ, Mo Cheeks, Kukoc, Hornacek are names who could be put up there.  Not Norman Powell lol."
Norman Powell was also a second round pick. Don't forget about him

[Norman Powell when he starts. I don't make the rules.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DtTCeXoV4AAFiDh.jpg:large)
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN NORMAN POWELL WAS #1 SCORER ON THE TEAM. CAPTAIN FALCON GET IN THERE!!!!
I love Beal so much man he reminds me of a poor man's Norman Powell with handles
Norman Powell and disturbingly low offensive BBIQ
"I haven't watched that many Raptors games over the years but man, Norman Powell has some serious star potential, is inconsistency holding him back or what are the flaws to his game?"
that is such a norman powell statline
Norman Powell and a second round pick for Andre Drummond
No thanks. We already have Norman Powell. We don't need big Norman Powell.
Everyone but Norman Powell. I swear he was either finishing strong or Turner was swatting him every time in the paint when we faced you guys.
"I like your optimism!    I think the issue will still be guarding teams with 2 bigger forwards.  With DEN rolling out Jokic - MPJ - Gordon, we were stuck having 6'3, Norman Powell (though he's pretty long) guarding a 6'10 forward.  I'm not sure there is a defensive scheme involving Dame - CJ - Powell that can solve for our guys just getting shot over.  MPJ and Gordon's stats fell significantly against Phoenix, and I think that was the difference in our series."
"That's a fair point, but I just feel with Jaren Jackson coming back that might be enough for y'all to get a pretty cozy 8th seed spot. Also Desmond Bane was getting busy in summer league so I think he's another plus for the Grizzlies along with Dillon Brooks.  I am high on Dame time, however judging from the Trailblazers off season moves...or lack thereof, I don't think they're that high on Dame time anymore. Dame and McCollum will give us what they normally do (until McCollum gets injured again), Norman Powell is good too. I also like that they added a bit more depth at the PF/C position in Larry Nance Jr and Cody Zeller since that seems to be where there injuries always tend to happen. However I feel like the Western Conference teams that are worth a damn made worthwhile moves/improvements while the Trailblazers kinda just put on a band-aid on a boo-boo that's getting infected now.  Spurs I completely forgot about them trading Derozan so yeah lemme get them outta there lmao"
"Jeez. This narrative around Blazers and Dame has to stop.   A full strength Blazers team consisting of Dame, CJ, Nurk and pretty solid role players in RoCo, Norman Powell is somehow better than Nuggets who were forced to start a backcourt of Austin fucking Rivers and an aged rookie in Facu. Give me a fucking break.   Unknown entities like Markus Howard were balling out against Portland lmao"
1. Rubio 2. Duncan Robinson probably 3. Norman Powell is pretty small for a forward  4. Giannis is pretty powerful for a forward  5. Kai Jones is almost dead center of last name in alphabetical order if you look at a list of nba players.
Remove the Timbits and toss in some chicken on the rocks from Osmow's in memory of former Raptors champion Norman Powell.  Extra Hot.  It is a rite of passage for any trade coming to the Raptors.
"Replies like this are so brain dead annoying. You're going to sit here and tell me that CJ McCollum, Norman Powell, Jusuf Nurkic, Robert Covington and Larry Nance aren't assets that would return value in a trade?"
"Suns got through this year because LeBron/ AD/ Kawhi all got hurt in the playoffs (along with Klay), obviously maybe the Suns beat them all healthy but if you asked that to any serious expert at the start of the year, they probably take an LA team  Toronto got its title in a year KD and Klay got hurt  Shit the Warriors got a title against a Cavs team that lost two All-Stars in the playoffs   Not to mention Dame and CJ made the WCF without Nurk and starting Al-Farouq Aminu and Mo Harkless at the wings with Meyers Leonard and Kanter platooning center  If they are healthy and playing in a groove, on a team that is plus Larry Nance and Norman Powell, with a bench that plays better defense than Kanter and Melo, they could easily make a legitimate run  People act like winning a title is being able to put out the best team in 2k when in reality it is finding some elite players and trying to complement them as best you can, working to become an elite team that can compete with anyone and hoping everything falls your way one year  People had the same doubts about the Mavs the year they beat the Heatles, but the team gelled, Dirk put up an all time run, and they got the ring"
"Short Summary-  Teams that were mentioned - Heat - Celtics - Mavs - Bulls - Hawks - Blazers - Warriors  Both Zach and Chris had differing opinions on how each team will either under-achieve or over-achieve. Really only agreeing that the Celtics were going to be better than what most believe.   Funny enough during the Blazer section towards the end, I mentioned the same exact stat on why I was optimistic about the upcoming season.   See [tweet. ](https://twitter.com/jwquick/status/1391430838185648135)  Since the Blazers' starting lineup has included Jusuf Nurkic and Norman Powell (24 games), Portland is 16th in defense, 2nd in offense and 5th in net rating. The only teams with better net rating: Jazz, Clippers, 76ers and Knicks"
They don’t need an all star but a dude who can get 17-18 a night easily  Will Barton or Norman Powell
"The blazers used the same logic when we signed Evan Turner to his huge contract. Now, AG is a much better player than ET ever was, so its unlikely that it turns out as badly, but it still has the potential to burn you down the road like the ET contract did for us. It might not matter in the next two years, but what about 3-4 years from now? Your roster might look entirely different, what if you could trade  for a superstar but it necessitates you taking on a couple million in salary. Suddenly the AG extension is the roadblock between the nuggets taking the step to contender. Also, the repeater tax is a thing. No team in the league can afford to just sit in the tax year after year, you might have to give up assets just to cut salary in a few years as a direct result of this deal.  It also begs the question of why give up assets for a guy whos going to get overpaid in a few months, and could you have gotten someone better or cheaper instead. As a blazers fan I am pretty happy we flipped Gary Trent Jr. for Norman Powell at 17mil per year, rather than trading GTJ plus picks for AG at nearly 24 million per year, as was rumored to be a potential deal we turned down."
"My point isn't that the Nuggets should've tried to sign Powell in the off-season, rather it's about the value of the contract. Norman Powell is in a different league than Aaron Gordon on the offensive side and is a solid defender (not better than Gordon to be fair). I think the point is that Gordon is a good fit for the nuggets, but they probably could've gotten him for a reasonably cheaper amount."
Would Norman Powell defend Lebron? Nuggets don't need any more offense my guy.
"As Net rating. See [tweet](https://twitter.com/jwquick/status/1391430838185648135).   Since the Blazers' starting lineup has included Jusuf Nurkic and Norman Powell (24 games), Portland is 16th in defense, 2nd in offense and 5th in net rating. The only teams with better net rating: Jazz, Clippers, 76ers and Knicks"
Idk man Portland signed Norman Powell for 5yrs 90 mil with no player options. I could be biased but I definitely see Norman Powell as better than Aaron Gordon. Even for a small market this seems like a huge overpay.
I could be wrong but this feels like a pretty big overpay. Duncan Robinson and Norman Powell got 5yr 90 mil and both (to me) are definitely better than Aaron Gordon. Obviously they’re different types of players but that seems like a massive deal.
"That's not the issue with switching situations, trying to compare them makes no sense because they play very different roles in different positions. Paul George has recently had a strong number 1 player on his team first with Westbrook now with Kawhi. Paul fits perfectly as a number two scoring option that can potentially carry as a leading scorer but has a couple of bad years in the playoffs that have unfairly offset his clutch years as a Pacer.  Dame is the first option on a very efficient pick and roll offense that has had issues of extremely terrible defenses over the years. McCollum has grown as a scorer but the lack of defensive abilities in their position as well as a lack of available defensive big men highlights their weaknesses. The Blazers have also dealt with a ton of injures in the past few years and despite they have always over performed in the regular season because of Dame's ability to run the offense. As a Blazer fan Dame has tremendously improved his ability as an offensive player over the years and nothing showed that more than Game 5 vs the Nuggets. The problem is Dame is a terrible defender and because of his offensive load he can be lazy, the Blazers have no guards that can be called defensively good and have never had good wing players. Aminu was never a good shooter and Gary Trent Jr. and Norman Powell are too small to guard played like Lebron and Michael Porter Jr. Our only defensive minded big man have been Covington and Nurkic. That is a ticking time bomb in the playoffs and that lack of defensive gets abused in the playoffs. Dame has gotten better at getting out of double teams but he still can't find teammates that can create plays with other players. He is not a good off-ball player so his role is diluted and his defense is magnified with McCollum."
Demar Derozan earned a 2nd team all-nba in 2017-18 with a line of 23/3.9/5.2 on exactly league average TS.  Your first instinct might be ok those are not great numbers for a 2nd team considering his awful defense. And you would be right.   You might then think but wait they won 59 games so even though Zach Lavine has put up almost identical numbers (2019-20) and NOT EVEN MADE ALL-STAR much less All-NBA that hw must have been indispensable on the court.   Wrong again. Demar had a negative on/off even this season and the NBA roster featured a whopping 10 PLAYERS who are significant rotation players even now 4 years later.  Here is the list:  OG Anunoby Demar Derozan Serge Ibaka Kyle Lowry Jakob Poeltl Norman Powell Pascal Siakam Jonas Valanciunas  Fred Vanvleet Delon Wright  Of course this team was one of the best in the NBA with a 10 man rotation like that!
"Surprised no one said the current Norman Powell. He currently is better than a role player, but isn't enough to a star"
"&gt;I feel like Miami is probably even better than Toronto  Guess you forgot that Pascal Siakam, Fred Vanvleet, OG Anunoby, Norman Powell, and Chris Boucher ever existed."
"there's much more to sports than a championship, demar loved toronto in his time there, fans loved (and still love) him  Norman Powell literally has a whole section in his goodbye letter dedicated to him"
"He's certainly better than Wiggins. For all the hype Wiggins got for his improved defense, OG is a substantially better and more versatile defender. He's also much more efficient (60.5% TS% vs. 56.8% TS%), a better shooter (39.8% from three on 6.1 attempts and 78% from line on 2.4 attempts vs. 38% from three on 5.2 attempts and 71% from the line on 3.4 attempts), and only a slightly worse scorer (15.9 ppg vs. 18.6 ppg) despite having the ball less (19.3% usage vs. 23.3% usage.) Last year was the first year Wiggins was really even a positive, OG has been an All-Defense level defender for the past two years.   I'd personally also have him over Norman Powell, who I perceive as streaky and a poor defender, but you've probably watched a lot more of him than I have, as a Raptor fan. And I think if you give OG the role Jerami Grant had in Detroit last year, he could replicate Grant's season- and when both were playing as 3&amp;D guys, OG had better numbers. Not sure how I'd rank OG and MPJ, MPJ is a negative defender and a major ball-stopper, but he's such an absolute flamethrower that it almost doesn't count against him."
"Norman Powell, Raptors &gt; Blazers. This reminds of how frustrating it is to watch my team (Raps) play against any of the red/black/white teams. Im constantly cheering for the ball to go in while it's mid -air, but then after shot, I realize that it was the opponents shooting."
yea norman powell is a fucking small forward too...
"Problem is this is the best the Blazers can do at this point. We all love Lillard and even if he forces a trade next year he'll be the greatest Blazer ever, but the current situation is partly on him. Literally until they lost to the Nugs this summer, Dame has always said how important loyalty and building something in Portland with our own home grown players is. He even said that's more important than winning a championship. And CJ is his best friend. What's the Portland FO gonna do except signing Lillard to a supermax and CJ to a regular max? The rest of the squad are actually all on reasonable contracts.   Now Lillard is demanding the team be better or he'll leave? How is Olshey suppose to dramatically improve this team when CJ is making max salary, and it is difficult to trade a near all-star undersized guard for an all-star wing? The best he can do is trade for good role players like RoCo, and mortgage young promising players like Trent for a more proven commodity like Norman Powell, and make a change in the Coaching. So now he's done all that, and probably that's the best he can do. CJ is just really hard to trade and get good value for. I'm sure if he can just swap CJ and a first in some sort of 3 team trade for Simmons or Siakam he'd do it, but that's likely not going to happen, so at least for now, looks like they'll run back the Dame CJ Powell trio and be content with getting more defensive oriented bench players like Nance instead."
"Lonzo Ball  Norman Powell   LeBron James  Kyle Anderson   Kelly Olynyk   Bench: Satoransky, Nance Jr, Garrison Matthews   I think they could beat a lot of championship teams but idk about the Warriors. If you add Embiid though, different story."
"Yup, Greivis Vasquez for the draft rights to Norman Powell and a future pick (OG)  wasn’t even there or in the league for much longer"
He should get about the same or less than Norman Powell.
Norman Powell fouling Jayson Tatum trying to get the rebound after Grant Williams missed both Free Throws in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals.
"Donovan’s comparison was Norman Powell which was still pretty accurate, just a better version."
Norman Powell
"Blazers can of course start him and slide Covington to the 3. Would work a bit better for their defense, with Nance being a bit longer than Powell. Bringing Norman off the bench was ideal anyways but they never had good enough depth at his position so they had to play him as a starter anyways.  Good guy Cleveland for trading him out. Markkanen fits the timeline better anyways. Win win."
"Unless Philly sells low and agrees to a CJ Simmons swap, I think the Blazers run back their end of the season Dame/CJ/Norm/RoCo/Nurkic starting lineup, where CJ will typically get subbed out early and replaced by a wing like Nance or Nassir Little and then CJ comes back to lead the 2nd unit and to close games.  Sample size was small at the end of the season, but when Nurkic returned, that small ball starting lineup supposedly high the highest plus minus of any lineup in the league. So if they run it back Portland would be counting on Norman Powell now fully gels with the lineup and his increased offense is made up by a now fully healthy Nurkic, and replacing no defense bench players like Melo and Kanter with better defensive role players like Nance and Zeller.  It's a big if, but if Billups really can institute good team defense strategies to try to cover for Dame/CJ/Norm in the same lineup, it might work. The amount of shooting at all three levels, spacing, and distributors on that small ball lineup is quite impressive."
"He's played in a league where teams like Curry/Klay/Durant, Lebron/AD, Lebron/kyrie/love, Durant/Kyrie/harden, harden/cp3 existed.  CJ mcCollum and norman powell is hardly enough to claim he has no excuses"
"Norman Powell was drafted by the Bucks, you he'd be the 2ns best bench guy for this team I think.  Marc Gasol is pretty damn washed now but he fits too"
"If you admit you're a simp for trae then no harm no foul.  ""I want Trae taking critical 3 point shots"" is MUCH different than ""Trae is the best 3 point shooter in the league from this spot""  The same NBA post you're referring to I believe had Norman Powell as the best at the weakside corner 3 in the game.   I fucking love Norman Powell, Norman Powell is not the best shooter of that shot in the league, that is still Steph Curry."
This is how we avoid the problem of needing to guard him with Norman Powell.  Big brain Neil Olshey.
Blazers really are lucky Dame is so loyal. What other team with their franchise superstar threatening to leave because of a poor roster could just throw a bag at Norman Powell and sign Cody Zeller and Ben Macklemore and call it a day.   I guess there could be moves yet to be played but it feels like the market is working against them w moving CJ
yes it does. cj at the time is a better player than mpj. they both suck on defense . dame and jokic are both mvp level players. i prefer jokic but dame is still good. nurkic as a third option is comparable to aaron gordon. then you go into the part that makes portland better norman powell is better than everyone else on the nuggets. the players that were missing from the nuggets drop their depth alot. robert covington is better too than most of the rest of the nuggets players. pj doizer will barton and jamal all out they trade away monte morris for gordon. pretty much had no guards left over. then you have enes a turn style on defense but can give you a good 5 minutes when jokic. on paper blazer are much better than the injured nuggets. coaching really did them a big diservice. terry stotts should have been fired years ago.
"8 man playoff rotation:   - Kawhi Leonard - Kyle Lowry - Pascal Siakam - Fred VanVleet - Norman Powell - Marc Gasol - Serge Ibaka - Danny Green  and OG Anunoby had an emergency appendectomy the eve of the playoffs and missed the entire postseason  The deepest team I've ever watched as a Raps fan. Zero defensive weak points and balanced offense across the entire roster. Shooting and scoring from all 3 levels, great playmakers and finishers, and subbing in Nick Nurse for Casey put them over the top."
Pascal and Norman Powell both played less than him. OG played as many minutes as CJ Miles.          Like I get that Miles was a good shooter but at some point you gotta do something different.
Probably not the Blazers. They have more flexibility than a lot of teams by having 3 FRPs / 4 FRP Swaps and two expiring contracts to trade if they decided to go for a star for one last push.   If they decide to blow it up: They have their picks and they could trade Dame for a haul. Nurkic and Roco are also S&amp;T options for next season where they can take back bad contracts for additional draft picks from contending teams. Norman Powell is also on a very tradeable contract.
"Ehhh, this Blazers team has generally been pretty good in the regular season.  6th seed in the West last year despite CJ and Nurk being out for like half the season.  I think Chauncey would have to be a really bad coach or a Lillard injury for this team to fall apart in the regular season.  The team has too much offense to not do fine in the regular season.    The issue is playoffs where the refs allow more contact and the teams play harder defense.  Portland just doesn't have the size to compete with teams that throw multiple 6'10 forwards out there (like Denver did).  Norman Powell shouldn't be guarding Aaron Gordon or MPJ."
"I think people will look back at the 2019 raptors once it's all said and done and realize how much talent we had.   Lowry, Danny Green, Kawhi, Pascal, and Gasol was an amazing starting line up but Danny and Gasol were older and Pascal is still developing to this day.  Ibaka was an amazing bench big for us and was imo in his prime that year.  Fred vanvleet and Norman powell were on small contracts and have both shown improvements in the past 2 years, Norm especially looked amazing last year.  Og Anunoby didn't even play in the playoffs. He's still developing and has a high ceiling.  Chris Boucher went from playing garbage time to seeking a big contract next off season.  Jeremy Lin, and Jodie Meeks had their time in the sun at one point. Patrick McCaw was decent but injury prone.  If you combine each players peak salary year once they've all retired it will be a very high figure."
"If the Blazers could build a 2011 Mavs style team around Dame it could be possible.  If you surrounded Dame with Jaylen Brown (or Jrue Holiday), Mikal Bridges, Bojan Bogdanovic and Bam Adebayo with Ingles, Norman Powell, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder and Ivica Zubac that'd be a true championship contending roster.  That squad has the size, defense &amp; versatility to cover up for Dame on defense, a playmaking big to help beat the trap on a PnR, enough secondary scoring to make teams pay for loading up on Dame and enough shooting to keep the lane open for him.   It's much harder to build a team around a small guard but not impossible."
Teams are finally understanding that it's better to let CJ McCollum or Norman Powell score than to let him score
Norman Powell
Is the Norman Powell for Gary Trent Jr a good trade for you guys?
Trent Jr. 2-14 after a game winner.  The inconsistency is Norman Powell-esque.
Best case scenario: Norman Powell
Norman Powell on steroids /s
"If you get some offensive threats into the lineup, and I mean at least Norman Powell type of threats- then it's Ben Simmons."
"Norman Powell but I guess he's not really a role player anymore.   PJ Tucker always rolled the Bucks, now he's on our team lol"
Norman Powell was pick #46 in the second round.  Has steadily improved his game and went from 5.6 pts per game in his rookie season to 19.6 pts this year and at times can flat light up the scoreboard.

"Norman ""Dame Time"" Powell"
So why trade away Norman Powell then and not just pay him and pay the tax? Don't have faith in your young studs?
Norman the doorman Powell is an upgrade over Gary Trent Jr
"It’s not dumb at all. It’s actually completely logical and anybody who knows literally anything about the sport would agree. You’re fucking wrong, sorry.  Do you think Norman Powell is a better isolation scorer than James Harden - yes or no?"
"Norman Powell is actually one of the best isolation scorers in the game, as much as that may surprise you. You’re just continuing to get further from the point as you know you’re wrong. At the end of the day, no team would rather have Dame, than Steph."
"Lol k dude. All I’m saying is that volume and efficiency both matter. Not sure why you’re being so stubborn and acting like that’s such a crazy thing to say. Patty Mills, De’Anthony Melton, Kenrich Williams, and Norman Powell all have a higher PPP than Steph, Harden and Dame. I highly doubt you’d consider any of these guys better isolation scorers than the players we’re discussing. Not even you believe that."
"Honestly it's similar to the raps in a way, there's a reason heavy motion offenses have good farm systems (or appear to), it's bc if you can teach a guy how to move in a motion offense, they'll get good shots. Siakam, FVV, Norman Powell, all had breakout sessions at 24+ after they spent a few years figuring it out.  Asking a guy who came from an NCAA offense to mesh seamlessly into one of the most complex offenses in the league is a lot; hopefully he'll figure it out soon."
Assume he’s referring to Norman Powell. Would consider him more likely than Melo to go for 30
Will all due respect to Norman Powell  Gary Trent is the future
"Jusuf Nurkic yelled, “There you go!” CJ McCollum gave a look of pleasant surprise. Norman Powell belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Damian Lillard hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
20 mil/yr is like nice starter money now.  That’s what someone like norman Powell might get lol and ik even though you’re a raps guy you don’t think Powell is close to jrue
"Lol, you do realize that they traded Trent away and now have added defensive guard Norman Powell to fill that role, don't you"
2015 is Norman Powell
Norman Powell over Trez
Each time I see a cool Norman Powell statline while browsing through the sub I go “alright man! Putting your shit together!” And then I reread.. 😔
I thought he was just Norman Powell with your mouth full
"I know Norman Powell's great and all, but I honestly prefer Trent Jr. over him. He's a better shooter, younger and is likely going to have the same sort of market this FA that Powell has, but he's also a RFA iirc. Just someone to keep going forward, I'd rather have Gary."
bucks series norman powell
Gotta keep Norman Powell happy.
"&gt;OG Anunoby played 0 playoff games, Norman Powell and FVV were bench players  Other than fvv these guys didn't have a huge effect then.  Kawhi, pg, Morris, Harrell, Lou is a great squad too"
"They definitely weren't better talent wise. Every player on that Raptors team is a starter right now. That team had insane depth at every position. OG Anunoby played 0 games, Norman Powell and FVV were bench players.   Jokic has clearly performed better in the playoffs no doubt, but the only team he's faced similar to the 2019 Raptors was the Lakers."
Norman Powell!
Norman Powell heard what you said.
Giannis made Norman Powell look like a fly on a wall didn’t even move on that swat
Because Norman Powell is better right now and the Blazers are in win now mode. It’s not like they were looking to get rid of him for just anybody
"Remove two of the top 3 players from any team along with important rotation players like Looney. And tell me. What team in the nba would stand a chance?   Seriously imagine if Kawhi, Lowry and Gasol went down. They would have a starting lineup of Vanfleet, Norman Powell, Danny Green, Pascal Siakam and Serge Ibaka. That team would get obliterated in a finals game.   Though i do agree that warriors roster construction wasn’t great especially when guys like Jeff Green or Luc Mbah amoute are signing for the vet minimum"
You got Bucks killer Norman Powell so I wouldn’t worry
Bucks gotta play their infamous killer Norman Powell 😈
Norman Powell who?
"Phew, at least we got Norman Scalabrine Powell now"
"when gary trent junior gets to 220+ pounds, grows a 6'11 wingspan and becomes a 3 level scorer like norman powell is, then we can talk. right now he shoots high volume 3's and plays with great energy and effort. he doesn't get to the rim and when he does he finishes at a below average amount. he doesn't rebound. he doesn't pass. statistically and eye test wise, he's a bad defender.  can he get better? absolutely. he probably will. but can he ever reach norm's current level? color me skeptical."
Couldn't agree more. And adding Norman Powell on top of it
"Andrea Bargnani FOR Marcus Camby, Steve Novak, Quentin Richardson, 2016 1st Round Pick, 2014 2nd Round Pick, and a 2017 2nd Round Pick  Greivis Vasquez FOR Norman Powell and a pick that turned into OG Anunoby.  Vasquez would go on to play 26 games(no starts) before washing out of the league"
Norman Powell and Lonzo Ball
"Siakam, FVV, Chris Boucher, Terence Davis, Norman Powell, these are all legit NBA players that he found in the late 1st, 2nd round or undrafted. Hired Nick Nurse too. He lucked out with Kawhi but he’s a great team builder"
"Naw, he just put up Norman Powell numbers at 22. His ceiling is a bit higher. Not trying to say he will be a top 10 player, but can see him a top 20 player by his prime in 5 years."
"Norman Powell is a better defender. It's obvious watching the games and it's supported by the stats. GTJ by comparison was statistically a terrible defender for us, like a significant net negative."
I love how Norman Powell was the catalyst to make him comment and not derozan getting stabbed in the back and traded 😂
"I don't how anyone can't call that Toronto team a super team. I get kawhi left. But they had a top 3 player in that postseason on kawhi. 2 other all-stars. Serge Ibaka who is a great defender, Marc Gasol who was all-defensive calibre. Fvv who was a 6th man of the year candidate. Norman Powell who was an efficient 10ppg. Danny Green who was still a great defender and whilst inconsistent is an experienced head. OG had great defence and good 3ot shooting.  They literally had 4 all-defensive calibre players and like 5 other high end role players. To me that is the definition of a super team.  If you look at those players now, norm and Fvv have developed into borderline all-stars. Siakim one year after was having an all-nba campaign before getting injured and covid."
"This kid is looking great right now, I think his ceiling is Norman Powell"
Norman Powell with the casual 14/3/2/3/2 on 50% shooting... loving this pickup he's such a hustle player. Hopefully the Raps are enjoying GTJ half as much as I love Powell.
Still undefeated in the Norman Powell era
Why the fuck is Carmelo Anthony getting 3 more shots than Norman Powell and 3 more minutes than DJJ.
Norman Powell went from Aron Baynes' cement hands to Nurkic lol
"Norman Powell with the ""why the fuck would you shoot like that"" shot, as he had 4 seconds left on the shot clock and decided the best course of action was to take a fadeaway jumpshot from the corner."
"I'm really out here crying rn. Looks like my next jersey gonna be a Norman Powell one. Make sure to take care of GTJ for us too, we loved him here in Rip City"
Norman Powell ! Lincoln alumni !!!
"It wouldn't surprise me to see the Blazers win convincingly tonight; they are on two days rest and are beginning to acclimate Norman Powell and re-acclimate Nurkic back into the lineup. With that being said, Detroit has been decent against the spread this year and I can't even remember the last time the Blazers won a game by 8 points."
"Norman Powell, man. Yeah."
Norman Powell is elite I don't make the rules
"Bucks gotta be my pick.  - Draft Joel Embiid in 2014 (over Jabari Parker)  - Draft Domantas Sabonis in 2016 (over Thon Maker)  - Draft Norman Powell and OG Anunoby (with the picks they traded for Greivis Vazquez)  - Hold onto Malcolm Brogdon (instead of letting him go to the Pacers)  That's a lineup of: Brogdon / Middleton / Anunoby / Antetokounmpo / Embiid, which Powell &amp; Sabonis off the bench."
NORMAN POWELL LADS
Great read. Hope Storming Norman kills it in Portland. He is the true definition of Playoff P... Playoff Powell.
My favorite thing about watching my team was Norman Powell
"Kyle Lowry yelled, “You will always be a part of this history!"" OG Anunoby gave a look of pleasant surprise. Pascal Siakam belted, “We got a fucking tank squad now.” And before Norman Powell hit the locker room door, ex-teammate Fred Vanvleet hugged him &amp; said, “Thugs cry too. It’s cool, bro.”"
He could be the top might be able to sign FA with Norman Powell in my opinion. Worth the risk. Could probably still get that offer from Lakers in the off-season if it doesn't work out
"I respect Dame for his approach to his career  I also respect others for their approach to their careers, excluding Latrell Spreewell, as i have no issue with a person doing what is in their own best interest personally or from a career standpoint  For every Dame, there is a Lue Wiliams, Lamar Odom, Blake Griffin, Norman Powell, Isaiah Thomas, Andrew Wiggins, D'Angelo Russell, even Andre Drummond was bench to avoid hurting his value, and so on.   Loyalty is great but for most guys it's definitely a one-way street. Once Dame's game slows down the real question will be if he ends up the trading block for his replacement.   If a player wants to put themselves in the best position to achieve a dream they've been chasing since they were kids, I'm all for it."
What about the bucks? They traded the picks that became norman powell and OG for Vasquez.
"We finally have 8/9 of our intended players  Notes: the 9th us Zach Collins who would have been a rotation PF/C if he hadn't gotten re-injured pre-season, he is anticipated back around the last week of RS.  It is to be seen if we try to incorporate a player so late.  GTJ had earned a rotation spot and has been replaced with Norman Powell.  Very hard to argue this isn't an upgrade once he gets up to speed    I'll say this- if we can't be league average at defense from now (i.e. intended roster) until playoffs, we will be an afterthought.  I just think our ratings up til now are a crapshoot."
"I know, he reminds of Norman Powell, bigger than most PGs smaller than most SGs he has a advantage in both"
&gt;Norman Powell staring down the Raptors bench after a fastbreak slam  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEYo7Cweg4Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEYo7Cweg4Y)
"Norman Powell, Lu Dort, Eric Gordon"
"Those are called ""wings"" and mostly play SG or small ball SF because their strength as a SF would be more useful guarding SGs considering the height difference. A good example of an undersized SF is Kawhi. Slightly shorter but he's still able to play the position because of his length and strength. Other examples of undersized SF that performed way better at guard are MJ, Kobe, VC, Wade...they all have excellent size for a SG and only good size as a SF. Besides Wade, who was often faster and stronger than his matchup, they can abuse a smaller defensive match up. I think all the most versatile guards could play SF in college. Guards like Harden, Westbrook, even prime John Wall. I think they could've played SF but are just way more effective at guard. Less popular examples are all the ""wings"" in the NBA. Guys like Norman Powell and Gary Trent Jr. There's a plethora of 2/3s in the NBA. If you're about 6'5"" and faster, youre a big guard. Stronger? Small big man. That's about it."
"look at norman powell and gary trent jr before him, you'd probably consider them gaurds but they play along side lillard and mccollum.   The Thunder also played SGA at SF last year when they ran a three guard line up with CP3 and Schroder"

It was to highlight how ridiculous it is to be sad about Norman Powell considering that I even felt silly for being sad over the departure of my team’s first ballot hall of famer and cornerstone of the franchise.
"I dont like fournier.  Even when he shoots well his presence on the court doesnt reflect his numbers.  Norman Powell on the other hand affects the game on both ends consistently, is athletic, is a champion, and has played winning basketball throughout his career."
"The people talking about “tears” and “crying” kind of crack me up. We’re talking about Norman Powell!!  When DWade left Miami after 13 years I was a little upset, but even then I felt silly to be sad about something like that."
Norman Powell has finally gotten some help.
My boy Norman Powell with a game high +15
You can take Norman Powell out of Raptors but can't take the Raptors out of Norman Powell
"You're ignoring all the shit he's done over the last decade, we only had ibaka because of him. We only had gasol because of him. We only had FVV because of him scouting undrafted talent. We got another undrafted talent in terence davis, who ended up making all rookie team which we flipped for a pick. He took norman powell from the bucks on draft day (46th pick) for vasquez.   And not to mention the major fleece he did by trading bargnani to the knicks which not only set up the raps for the remainder of the decade but also ended up contributing to us trading for Kawhi/leading to the championship. This doesn't even include the decision making to actually choose to trade for Kawhi, since that part you said was a fluke, but even being in a position to make the trade, he set that up years in advance  Stop looking at shit so superficially and with a narrow mind, it's always deeper than what you think.   His biggest short coming was going after Giannis and making the room to do that. And some ppl were saying he could've still overpaid for Ibaka and signed Giannis but that's not on him either, ownership didn't wanna pay the penalties by going over the tax cap"
Norman Powell was the greatest non-draft acquisition in Portland history.
"THT was 46th that year, both LA teams got steals.  Other notable names from recent years drafted in the 40-50+ range include Paschall, Brooks, Powell &amp; Milton.  You can get some good players around that range &amp; I believe he can be another Norman Powell (46th) caliber player.    He was chosen by Kawhi-PG to train with them &amp; of course he's got the #1 player development coach in the NBA, Atkinson."
I think Norman Powell is gonna get a really big contract and is open to joining the highest bidder
"Ok sure, me too, Norman Powell and everything....but like realistically 🤷🏼‍♂️"
That's cool with me because I wasn't ready for the Raptors to give up the GROAT anyways. Losing Norman Powell is hard enough.
"Dlo+KAT need to be surrounded by elite defenders to make it work imo.  Dlo is very streaky too so that sucks.  I'd rather have Norman Powell than Dlo this year, and that isn't even considering their contract situations."
"We had a player go through the same thing last year. If I recall correctly, Norman Powell had three unrelated injuries in the same season. It was sort of funny in a macabre way, but also incredibly painful as a fan.  Miraculously, he's been one of our healthiest players this year."
"Indie fans, you want Norman Powell for him?"
"Kevin Huerter, hawks could throw him in a package to try and get another wing like Norman Powell"
Norman Powell as a starter
Norman Powell will opt out most likely at the end of the season. You would have to trade a pick to acquire him then break the bank to keep him
"Lol you guys are delusional. Thomas isnt getting you much. He ain't gettin norman powell. That wouldn't be a TT trade, that's be a norm powell trade. And he ain't on the block."
"TT, Javonte Green, 2021 second from OKC, and our 2021 lottery protected first for Norman Powell."
Only if you throw in two first and Norman Powell

"Norman Powell for me man, always loved his heart."
"Sad to see how the Raptors play so diminished. Lowry is frustrated, but good to see Norman Powell balling out there. It was a lethargic game and I was expecting more from the Bulls.   The Raptors playing that is understandable. Given they miss a lot of players and is playing in their second b2b game."
I think it’d be a big deal for us. People don’t understand Dame is a walking top 5 offense by himself and Norman Powell taking cj’s shots is just a flat upgrade anyway. Simmons can have awful nights on offense but I think our personnel could deal with it pretty well. We have a lot more shot creators than Philly
"Probably like a vanvleet, Norman Powell, Lou Williams.   I don't think Ben Simmons is a bad player. Definitely overrated but with a change of mindset and maybe a role change I think he could be great. When he's using his athleticism and being aggressive I think he's one of the top finishers in the NBA at the rim. Good hook touches from short range as well. He's way too passive though and his lack of confidence in jump shooting hurts him"
Luis Scola Bismack Biyombo Norman Powell Demar Derozan
"not related to his playoff performance, but Norman Powell should be looking for at least a 20m/yr contract. its been rumored for awhile that multiple teams are looking to grab him"
I saw a YouTube series where they called Norman Powell “the South Pole Sniper” and I can never get that out of my head now
Nuggs need to sign Norman Powell this offseason
"Norman ""should have all that"" Powell should be the only nickname for him imo"
"I never said soley low picks. I said ""low picks and trades""  Did Kawhi, Marc Gasol, Danny Green, Serge Ibaka, Kyle Lowry, etc sign with the Toronto Raptors? They never did.  Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, and Fred VanVleet. All 3 of those guys were picked 27th, 46th, and last one was not even drafted.   The team never had a top/lottery pick drafted on their roster. They never signed a top guy in free agency. When Masai got there he didn't have a player who was considered anything but a maybe boderline all-star in Rudy Gay. That's it."
There is not a Nurkic or Norman Powell on most other teams benches. Even Covington is a stretch. They are completely stuck though with no star stuck in a bad spot to trade for to team with Dame.
"Stotts leaving was more of a good thing than most people realize. We had double digit leads in almost every WCF game in the late 3rd quarter, and we still lost. Stotts was not good at making in game adjustments. I can only see us getting better with a new coach honestly, as long as we are able to retain Norman Powell and offload CJ, but I’m not expecting him to net any stars like most delusional fans seem to think. You do have a point about Olshey. Our old owner was a lot more involved, and when he died he left the team to his sister who I feel doesn’t really care that much. Could be wrong, but I don’t have confidence in her firing Olshey"
Probably. But you can make it work if you're deep  Like one of Norman Powell or Nurkic being your 4th best player is pretty damn good
"Bruce ""Norman Powell/Bucks Killer"" Brown"
"I dont know if he really struggles in the playoffs tbh. How long is the track record on that? I just know him as the guy nobody knew much about that almost beat the heatles. Then he broke his leg in half and still came back to superstar form. Ridiculous to me if anyone thinks George isn't anything but smooth/clutch.  I still remember a raptors/pacers playoff series years ago, I think we were the 2nd seed they were 7th, they almost beat us!! It went to 7 games and nobody on our team could match Paul George. Not only did Paul George light us up, he also completely shut down our own star in Demar at the time. The only reason we came out of that series alive is because Norman Powell got in a few solid defensive possessions against George, that was enough to get past them but it was close!"
"You don't want Dame, you want Norman Powell if you are the Nuggets.  Norman Powell actually won with the Raptors."
"Top 8 for C's that year:  1) Rookie Tatum  2) Soph Brown  3) Horford  4) Smart  5) Marcus Morris  6) 3rd Year Rozier  7) Aron Baynes  8) Rookie Semi Ojeleye  Top 8 for the Raptors:  1) Kawhi  2) Kyle Lowry  3) Soph. Siakam  4) Soph. FVV  5) Ibaka  6) Gasol  7) Norman Powell  8) Danny Green  That's a ton of talent on the Raps side. If that goes beyond 5, I'd be shocked."
"Also traded for Nurk while giving up very little, Norman Powell was also a good acquisition."
"What about Nurk/RoCo/DerrickJonesJr/Norman Powell scream 29/30 in defensive rating? Stotts willingly chose to play Kanter and Melo massive minutes and refuses to hold CJ and Dame (yes, even Dame) accountable for their total lack of defensive effort. That’s a coaching problem. Not a roster problem."
What if they threw in someone like Norman Powell
My current best casual fan doesn’t give a fuck/know a fuck roster:  PG: Jamal Murray   SG: Norman Powell  SF: khris Middleton  PF: John Collins  C: Deandre ayton
"While I agree with the ""hindsight is 20/20"" point to some extent, even at the time, trading up to 10 to get Zach Collins was questionable.  It was a reach at the time.  There is a good chance he would have fallen to 15, where we could have drafted him without giving up our 20th pick.  It wasn't just that we missed the one diamond in the rough, its isn't a Draymond going last situation.  There were multiple potential picks that people were high on at the time that we missed out on.    There has further been an overall inability to evaluate forwards.  Since LMA and Batum left, Portland's only forward that you'd actually want to start on a good team has been RoCo.  Otherwise we've had Harkless, Aminu, the shitshow that was 2019-20, and DJJ this season.  We got to the point where we were starting 6'3 Norman Powell to guards Denver's 6'10 forwards."
"Portland will likely find a trade for CJ, because yeah having him at the 2 isn't ideal. But people think he's playing the 2 full-time for some reason. He's generally been the backup PG for when Dame sits. So in reality, it'd be half the time CJ at SG and the other half, a bigger defensive oriented SG (like Norman Powell).   the guy you're replying to is being very simplistic with his views on portland. nurk/roco/djj/norman/dame on paper has the potential to be a GREAT defensive team. We've played with that lineup many times this season when CJ subs out of the game and goes to the bench. And we've also played with nurk/roco/djj/norman/CJ when Dame has to sit.  Most teams stagger lineups, so it's mostly about having a top 8 players, with 3 on the bench being a big, a forward and a guard. just viewing CJ/Dame as the starting guards is very arbitrary, since the rest of the lineup has defensive players all around it and can play multiple positions."
6’3 Norman Powell defending 6’8 SFs is not ideal at all.
"Dame is not the problem in the 3 guard lineup it's that you have 6'3"" Norman Powell guarding 6'10"" Michael Porter Jr"
What about Kristaps and something else for mccollum? KP could fit well in Portland and they already have Norman Powell for the sg spot.
Might be a tough sell for the Kangz because they’d have two injury prone forwards in Bags and KP. But Kristaps does still have that big upside if he can stay healthy and Dallas needs shooters.   If they did trade KP they could go after Lauri who already expressed interest in Dallas. I think Norman Powell would be an excellent fit for the Mavs too.  Definitely some options for them this off-season.
1. Trade Porzingis 2. Resign THJ and Brunson 3. Somehow get Zach Lavine or  Bradley Beal 4. Sign Norman Powell or Evan Fournier 5. Sign more veteran centers
Need a secondary shot creator and scorer. They could go after a Goran Dragic or Norman Powell and re sign THJ.
Sign Norman Powell
"Assuming you’re talking about 2019, Kawhi had Lowry, FVV, Siakam, and Norman Powell.   Jokic has ??? MPJ maybe?  And if you’re talking about this year, Kawhi has PG13 and way better role players."
Ariana Huffington is gonna tell if where Norman Powell is staying too
TIL there is a subreddit called r/Norman lol. Too bad it isn't about Powell.
"I agree with the 2020 Heat being far from a juggernaut and MKE should've stomped them by any considerable metric. As a fan, that series was a humongous disappointment and embarrassment.  However, the 2019 Raptors were a great team, and built considerably better than the 2019 Bucks. That season Kawhi legitimately had the best playoff run since Michael Jordan. Kawhi was far and above any single player in the league the postseason, and that obviously includes Giannis. So the Raps had the best player on the floor, and then significantly more depth, as their roster was peppered with borderline stars.  Lowry &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bledsoe  Danny Green &lt;&lt; Middleton (the Bucks only real advantage in the starting lineups)  Kawhi &gt;&gt; Giannis  Siakam &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mitotic   Marc Gasol &gt; Lopez  Bench of Ibaka, VanVleet, Norman Powell &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Brogdon, Illyasova, George Hill  Us Bucks fans were hopeful in that series, especially once we were up 2-0, but that Raptors team was easily better than us on paper, and that's before accounting for Nuclear Kawhi being on a different level than Choke Giannis.  That 2019 Raptors team is somehow still underrated, despite winning a title. They were one of the most well built and deep teams the NBA has seen in a long, long time.   Kawhi, Siakam, Gasol, Ibaka is one of the best frontcourts of all-time. Combined they have 8 All-NBA teams, 9 defensive 1st teams, and 3 DPOYs.  The guard rotation of Lowry, Green, FVV, Norm was a step above MKE's Middleton, Bledsoe, Hill, Brogdon.  Nurse is a way better coach the Bud.  Toronto had every single advantage over the Bucks in that series, and again the only reason we were so disappointed is because we were up 2-0, and then game 3 was in our grasp and Giannis and Bledsoe choked harder than Boban's wife the first time she got on her knees.   So we felt like it should've been our series and we choked, but it's not like we were so much better on paper that it was flabbergasting that Toronto ended up winning, as *they* were clearly the better team on paper and on the court. Had MKE won, we would've felt like we stole that series, but not that we were heavy favorites that should've swept them."
"I loved this video. Switching principals and having the whole team locked in on the same wavelength is so goddamn underrated. I know Portland has some poor defenders but we also have some players that are individually pretty good (Nurk/Zach Collins/RoCo/Derrick Jones Jr/Norman Powell). But my god, some of the switches we do (and non-switches) is just comical. No one knows what the other defender is thinking or expects, so it just either becomes never switch or switch every single time. Never any fucking nuance or strategy."
"Norman Powell has played two series against the Bucks and if he played us every night he’d win an MVP, it makes sense his playoff numbers are amazing."
"And his playoff splits are identical to Norman Powell, so…"
I think CJ is good it’s just he’s too small and him and Dame overlap too much. You don’t need to small scoring guards when you have Dame who can take over and now Norman Powell. I think they could trade CJ for a Derozan or Spicy P for a different look and gain more size to help Dame. Derozan and Spicy P can both make plays when Dame is doubled and have the size to make more of an impact on defense.
"No kidding, Vuc is a low tier star maybe or if you hate him an amazing role player.  And Isaac being made of glass makes playing him high min impossible.  Fourniet is also a very good role player.  Aaron Gordon is a decent talent as well.  A 6th man scorer and one more scoring guard and that team is a solid 4-5seed in the east.  When those guys were still there.  I guess fultz off the bench, so maybe Norman Powell would've been a nice pickup."

This wasn’t an article about popularity, it was an article about influence. You also picked an article based on the opinions of one person. This is embarrassing.   You’re going to need to include sources, because one article is saying that average ticket price for a Raptors game is $179 (according to Yahoo Finances on November 2019) and another is barely over $101.   But yeah, the Maple Leafs franchise as a whole is more popular than the Raptors, but that has little to do with the players and more to do with the love the city has for hockey. You can make the argument that Matthews is more popular, but otherwise this  is the equivalent of saying those garbage players on the Lakers in 2015 (outside of Kobe) were more popular than Clayton Kershaw. Just a weird hill to die on.   You’re talking about trades, I’m talking about the Lakers giving him a new contract. You already said his contract was un-tradable, but the Lakers willingly gave him that new contract when they never had to. Pay attention.   Man Trez has struggled to stay on the floor for two straight postseasons.   There’s all the evidence that suggests Masai was willing to keep Lowry, even if he would walk for free in Free Agency. You can willingly ignore it and draw your own conclusions from it but it’s there. There’s no evidence of Masai just taking *any* offer just because they’re the only ones. There’s no evidence of Masai even having much interest in any of the players offered in these trades even dating back to his Nuggets days, and that includes Tyrese Maxey who they never had any sort of contact with.   And Maxey was surely in his draft range, at least more than Jalen Smith (who the Raptors met with), who was selected way higher than Maxey and their draft selection.   &gt;Caldwell-Pope has way more value that Rodney Hood, and more to the point, way more value than Kyle Lowry   Oh my God, I should’ve known I was arguing with an idiot. Aye man, just because people having been teasing the Lakers about not trading for Lowry doesn’t mean you have to say ridiculous shit to justify the move. Hope you can recover from this, have a good day,   One thing I will say is that we will revisit this when Lowry gets his money in FA, remind me."
"BOS gets: CJ McCollum, Kristaps Porzingis, Josh Richardson, POR 2023 1st, POR 2027 1st, DAL 2025 1st, CLE 2025 2nd  POR gets: Kevin Love, Jaylen Brown, Collin Sexton  DAL gets: Norman Powell, Taurean Prince, Tristan Thompson  CLE gets: Kemba Walker, POR 2025 1st, DAL 2024 2nd  It’s not realistic, nor does it make sense, but here is one."
So Norman Powell is mediocre now? Melo? Y’all funny on here lol
"My vision is that Brogdon plays the 2 next to Dame and then they work on finding a SF by S&amp;T with Powell or via trading Simons/Collins/Little/Nurkic.  I'm pretty ambivalent on Norman Powell, I think he's a nice player but perhaps not the ideal back-court mate for Dame since he's not that big and is a pure slasher/scorer, the Blazers desperately need another playmaker to share the load with Dame.  I do agree with your points, though, they're in a tight spot."
"Powell is 6'3"" and even though he has pretty long arms that's still pretty small for a guard/wing.  That's been Portland's problem for years, so why they should double down on Norman Powell, who as you say shouldn't be relied upon in a playoff series?  On another team in the NBA with size/plus defenders in the back-court/on the wing (like in Toronto), he's a fine defender.  But on one of the worst defensive teams in the NBA that desperately needs balance and ace stoppers he isn't the answer.   Also Powell is a pure slashing scorer, he doesn't bring a whole lot else to the table.  That's tough to make a huge investment in as a foundational guard, especially when the Blazers have struggled for a long time to ease the burden on Dame &amp; find playmaking elsewhere on their roster.  Powell is a fine 3rd guy, but not someone who you want to give max money to, and that's what he'll cost this offseason."
"Not gonna be as mean as the other guy, but Powell is a plus defender for sure. I'm not talking All-NBA, but as a guy you can put on your opponent's best wing and know it's the best decision available? Absolutely.   The issue to me if that if Norman Powell is making or breaking your chances in a playoff series, you never had much of a chance to speak of. Resign him or don't, but there's just not enough talent on the Blazers to ever really contend, and short of blowing the whole thing up and starting a hard rebuild, they're going to be on this mid to late seed treadmill until Lillard retires."
"I am less certain about Norman Powell staying with the Blazers, particularly after the way he caked his shorts in this playoff series.  Agree that they'll be looking for a big wing and perhaps to do something at the 5 since Nurkic is on an expiring deal and disgruntled (also he's only actually 60% as good as he thinks he is), but this is a nice start.  I like Brogdon more than Powell, so maybe you can S&amp;T Norm to his preferred destination and find a wing/big in one of those deals."
That's exactly it. Nurks health was always an excuse but this team just isn't cutting it. Dame somehow keeps getting better and the team gets worse.we had decent health and Norman Powell. Embarrassing loss.
"KOC had a good point on the Mismatch pod the other day. Trading for Norman Powell to then have to overpay him makes a ton of sense if you're planning to trade CJ. Powell is a gifted offensive player. Nowhere near the player CJ is, BUT he is WORLDS better as a defender. He actually makes more sense as a backcourt partner for Dame. Question just becomes who are they trading for."
"Agreed, but you cant blame the front office for acquiring Norman Powell. It was an upgrade over GTJ imo, especially for the playoffs, but looking now, it got them out first round so what do I know. Although I don't think hes the reason they lost, could he done better, sure.       It's pretty obvious but CJ and Nurkic had to play better. But honestly, first thing Blazers need to do is find another coach before anything else, its been long overdue as much as I like Stotts."
"Idk Lakers cap situation but I honesty think the only guys that should remain on the roster are LeBron, AD, Caruso &amp; KCP. Really want to see LA swing at guys like Gary Trent Jr., Norman Powell &amp; Duncan Robinson.  Need a quality big to soak up minutes at the 5 to preserve AD.  Lakers should come out energized &amp; healed with a proper off season after flaming out in in the 1st round. Need Vogel to get a better assistant for offense even with Bron &amp; AD healthy this team suffered a good amount of 2,3,&amp; 4 minutes scoring droughts. Simply gotta rehab, reload &amp; refocus for next season."
Terry and CJ are gone for sure. I think Olshey stays though. Biggest question mark is imo re-signing Norman Powell
Norman Powell fucking blows
Free Norman Powell
playoff powell aka stormin norman
I think it’s time we stop viewing Norman Powell as an “other”
Raptors legend Norman Powell
I'm happy Norman Powell isn't fucking my team in the ass any more
"McCollum should be traded, I feel like Norman Powell has made him redundant"
"Why are you comparing career numbers now? We said peak to peak.  Dame's peak was 8 assists and 2.9 TOs. MVP Russ was at 10.4 assists and 5.4 TOs. That's a drastically better ratio for Dame.  &gt; making his team brilliant and efficient on offense  Not really dude. Russ lead teams have been average as hell offensively.   3 years of Russ as the #1 star on the team, OKC was 17th, 7th, and 17th offensively in the league. Dude had a better player on his team (PG) than Dame has ever had in his whole career for 2/3 of those years too.  Compare that to the Blazers, who have been 4th, 2nd, and 2nd the last 3 seasons, and that's despite major injuries to our team in both of the last 2 seasons.  &gt;Dame is frequently hunted for mismatches, he is a liability - never done with Russ (who gets lost off ball like a doofus 4 times a game - different story, different form of a liability admittedly)  This just tells me you don't really watch the Blazers lol. We have essentially never switched on defense prior to getting Norman Powell, so there is no matchup hunting.   Plus dude, we saw what happened in the playoffs. Dame guarded Russ and he was trash. Russ got burned every time he was on Dame and tried to bail on guarding him as much as physically possible.  &gt;their impact on team wins is at best comparable, being charitable to Blazers last years.  Dude, this is why I can't agree though man. How many times has Russ has literally any success without an MVP on his team? Never. 3 years he was the star, and it lead to 3 straight first round exits in embarrassing fashion. Dame's gotten his team as far as pretty much anyone in the league ever has while being the only all star"
"Depends on the player. I think FVV, and Powell for instance get too much credit.   Now FVV went nuclear halfway through the Bucks series and the Warriors, but he was absolutely dogshit the first two series. Norman Powell didn’t really play that much besides the Bucks and ppl give him a lot of credit. Whereas Lowry, Ibaka, Gasol and Siakam I think are underrated for their contributions."
Kawhi already left Texas once so I don't see it. I think they'll trade Porzingus for whatever they can and try and sign a guard that can hit shots. Maybe Norman Powell.
"Seems like this is the largest concession I'm going to get on this from a Mavs fan, so kudos, but it still seems like this is some mental gymnastics to soften the blow of giving up a player who went off for 30 in a playoff game. Sure, Seth has flaws, but you can ALWAYS find a spot on the bench for a guy like that. The fact that Richardson is mostly out of the rotation means you didn't get enough back for Seth. Ergo, you lost the trade.  Don't worry, though-- every team has made this move at some point or another. Moving on from a player before they get better elsewhere. It's hard to make moves on the margins when your team is good and you're just trying to alter things to reach another level. For example, the Bucks had both Norman Powell and Christian Wood on their roster in recent years and gave up on both."
"I think they should go after Norman Powell, or Lonzo Ball. That's more realistic than Kawhi or CP3. Or even a guy like Nic Batum on a reasonable deal."
"Yeah that's my point, if there's someone who will make those shots it's dame. A few Nuggets fans here said this was the plan and he won't always make those shots... But that's like PG saying ""that's a bad shot"", I mean come on now Dame have made those for 8 seasons now, it's more likely he will make them than not.   Let CJ come up big or Norman Powell show he is Steve Kerr reincarnate. Just get the damn ball off his hands."
"it also reminded me of when the trail blazers decided to play drop coverage on steph in game 1 of the 2019 WCF. i was watching the game and yelling for them to double dame. i’d much rather have robert covington or norman powell shooting a wide open shot than damian lillard getting an iso when he’s hot, and that’s just how good damian lillard is"
Norman Powell
"- cj needs to do what he did in 2019 - nurkic needs to learn from jokic and conserve his fouls (so stotts should be on him about this) - hit open jumpers  - cj mccollum is 30% on open shots, 13% on open 3s - robert covington is 27% on open shots, 18% on opens 3s - norman powell is 33% on open 3s - carmelo is 35% on open 3s"
"I for one wouldn't ever put Dame, CJ and Norman Powell in the game at the same time at any point. Like really? 3 guards under 6'3""? Really? I already had a hard enough time understanding why they would spend the last several years with CJ and Dame on the court. And you wonder why Denver was shooting lights out from 3 point land. A rotating 6'3"" guard isn't putting no fear into anyone shooting a 3 pointer."
"Dame was 1-10 in G4, Norman Powell and CJ carried his ass and got a W. It is strange to see people forgot about it so quickly and saying Dame got no help."
Our old FO traded Norman Powell and the pick that turned into OG for 1 year of Greivis Vasquez an actual bum. Literally cost us a championship fml
"god can't save you austin, but cj mcollum robert covington norman powell can"
"I just checked and how the fuck has CJ not been an all star ever. That's crazy to me. West must be that stacked.  Anyways, it doesn't matter. CJ is still a good player that is still a threat that the defense has to focus on. It's not even debatable which sidekicks were worse. Imagine comparing someone like Kyle Macy and Dave Corzine to Robert Covington and Norman Powell. And I'm not making those first two names up. Those were two of MJ's starting teammates in the 63 point game. Macy was out of the league after the next year."
Shit they had the opportunity with the Norman Powell trade. Should’ve kept Gary Trent instead
Yeah Norman Powell became Norman Bowel this game..
Dame: has 55 points.  Stotts: Best I can do is run a play for Norman Powell!
Dames supporting piece is Norman Powell lol. Let that sink in
"Has Norman Powell even gotten the ball? Melo, CJ, and Roco for sure"
Why did that shot go to Norman Powell??
Ikr Norman Powell putting in work. Miss him on the raptors 😢
I can't say this with enough emphasis  Fuck Norman Powell
Dame Time and real Playoff P aka Norman Powell
God I love Norman Powell
"tbh I think if they could simply add butler, I think that would be enough for any team suspect of the nets. I understand why some would trade cj, but I wouldn't. Unless one thinks Norman Powell can be the starting two in lieu of cj...   To go even further.. this team as assembled now is strong enough for a deep run. But 8f they don't get it done this year, Terry has to go as it would then appear to be similar to (what I suspect) boston in that the coach is a really good coach. a smart coach. but he can't bring the best out of players emotionally. not wanting to pivot the conversation, but when I think about coaches that are capable of this, I think of Mike Tomlin (steelers, nfl I know), Mark Jackson... When I think of Brad in boston I see a wizard and high basketball IQ. Same with Terry except it Terry is definitely more of a players coach..."
Playoff Powell baby UTG!  I miss NORMGOD/Stormin Norman but glad he's being loved by the Portland fans
"&gt;  you guys couldnt even win one game against GS and KD wasnt even playing.  ...the series before we beat Denver starting Enes Kanter.  Then people are somehow shocked we don't do better playing Dame, CJ, and Enes Kanter vs Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green while Dame is playing with a separated rib.    Our center rotation that series was Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard.  We went from starting Aminu, Mo Harkless, and Enes Kanter to Norman Powell, Robert Covington, and Jusuf Nurkic."
Norman Powell.
Meanwhile we're singing happy birthday and chanting Norman Powell lmao
"Kawhi (will opt out to secure a bigger contract), CP3 (maybe he opts out his 1 yr 44mill to secure a 2 yr 50-60 mill), Derozan, Lowry, Conley, John Collins (RFA) , Lonzo Ball (RFA), Richaun Holmes, Jarett Allen (RFA), Norman Powell, Oladipo, Lauri Markannen (RFA), D Rose"
Norman Powell
Norman Powell put him in jail
"I think he’s criminally overrated if anything. He’s been our 4th or 5th best player in this series, and brings absolutely nothing to the table when his shot isn’t falling. Norman Powell is legitimately better than him imo"
Norman Powell isn’t here?
"Yes yes Aminu, harkless, and Meyers Leonard the same thing as Norman Powell, Roco, and Nurkic   Not to mention “warriors without their best player” is literally still Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green"
Anyone else think Norman Powell and Andre Drummond look like brothers?
I'm so scared that Dallas is gonna offer Norman Powell a godfather offer and steal him away from us in the offseason.

"Jeremy ""Kawhi's Little Friend"" Castleberry. As said by FVV and Norman Powell lol."
his full name is: stormin norman powell
"Powell, Norman"
Have a listen to the Norman Powell chant that went up in the arena when he left the game. Sounds pretty popular to me.😂
"You can say this about the 90s but zone defense along with lack of spacing really did make it hard on guys that depend solely on their jump shot such as Norman Powell  A lot of the iso players like Wade and Kobe were also incredible slashers, even Ray Allen was dunking on people when he was on the bucks"
2nd best shooting guard? So you think Norman Powell would be better than Dwyane fucking Wade?
"Kyle, Demar, Norman Powell, Ibaka, JV"
Shoutout Norman Powell
He also got Norman Powell a nice contract
"46th pick, just like Norman Powell, nice"
Norman Powell was also the 46th pick for the Raptors.  They have some luck with that 46th pick it seems.
"Anybody in the league that is annoying af like this for genuine reasons related to basketball is always someone you hate on other teams, but would absolutely love them on yours. For me it’s guys like Norman Powell, Jae Crowder, Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood, Derrick White, Joe Ingles, Marcus Morris, etc… fuck all those dudes, until they join my squad, then they’re my dudes lol. I realize Jamal Murray is a guy like this for people outside of Denver lol."
This. That Marc Gasol acquisition was HUGE. plus you had van fleet and norman powell stepping up at different times.
"what is this, favorite child syndrome?  norman powell and CJ are the same height and they make powell play SF."
"The Blazers as presently constructed are a 2nd round exit. We've seen multiple iterations of the Dame &amp; CJ show and it's always been the same.  Ben Simmons might not take them any higher than the 2nd round but he does cover a huge gap they have as a secondary playmaking ""wing"" that is elite on defense.  Dame/ Norm Powell/ Simmons/ RoCo/ Nurkic. 6Man: A.Simons  Is a much more complete looking rotation than a Dame &amp; CJ backcourt with Norman Powell at SF."
"Said it a while ago. I'll repeat. I don't like the Simmons for CJ trade for the blazers.   We've all seen that team in the playoffs in the Aminu/Harkless days. They don't need another non shooter making it easier to to send hard doubles to Dame and probably Norman Powell at that rate if CJ is gone. This is despite how much they'll improve defensively. Immeasurably so considering I feel like in that situation, it might allow Simmons to be in a more Giannis like role as a help defender plus how good he is already as a man defender.   Would rather Tobias Harris in addition to Dame &amp; CJ. Not that the sixers would ever do that."
"Realistically, no.   But, in theory, yes.  This line-up, if it was ever assembled, would win a ring IMO:   PG: Damian Lillard  SG: Norman Powell  SF: Khris Middleton  PF: Julius Randle  C: Bam Adebayo"
You’re going to be lucky to get Norman Powell. CJ is the most underrated player in the NBA in decades. Philly gets CJ and they get a Finals appearance. It’s that simple.
"Definitely is a troll account. They're known by most Celtic fans on this sub.   They get karma by shitting on Boston for easy upvotes and because they're always very quick to celebrate the Toronto Raptors as the best run franchise in the East there's always a steady flow of upvotes by gullible Toronto fans.  There was a point where they were arguing Jaylen Brown was one of the worst players in the NBA.  &gt;* Would trade Jaylen Brown for him. Powell is incredible.  &gt;* Norman Powell deserved All-Star selection over Jaylen Brown. The Raptors are incredible at developing players, arguably the best in the league.  &gt;* I'd trade Jaylen Brown and a decade's worth of first round picks and swaps for [Ayton]. He'd be an amazing fit next to Tatum instead of a black hole.  &gt;* Helps that Jaylen Brown was a traffic cone on defense.  &gt;* Green teamers have been working overtime trashing Tatum and Brown's supporting cast because no one wants to admit that Tatum and Brown (especially Brown) are just not that good.  &gt;* Would rather have Powell than Jaylen Brown.  &gt;* Brown is one of the worst defenders in the NBA right now because he doesn't know how to play off-ball defense. Tatum is still far and away the better player.  &gt;* Jaylen Brown for Norman Powell, God please!  &gt;* Boston lost to Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson because Spoelstra is so much better than Brad Stevens and Jaylen Brown was and still is the worst defender in the NBA. Credit to the Heat but Tatum deserved better from his team, we shouldn't have lost that series.  &gt;* Harden will make Ainge pay for not trading Jaylen Brown for him. The greatest offensive player in the history of the league was literally available and Ainge refused to trade him for Jaylen Brown, the most overrated player in the NBA.  &gt;* Brown did not deserve his All-Star selection. His defense is massively overrated considering how often he lets players cut around him, and his offense has been slumping for a month.  &gt;* [Randle's] better than Tatum and Brown combined. I'm insanely jealous of New York's future, especially considering RJ is already way better than Brown.  &gt;* The biggest problem is that Tatum and Brown are simply not good enough, especially Brown.  &gt;* Tatum, Brown, and Brad Stevens are embarrassments to the Celtics franchise.    Are you starting to see a theme here?  Because I could go on..."
"If Masai listened to the fans we would have traded Lowry for Kemba after 2015, traded JV for Andre Drummond, never traded DeMar, and built around Norman Powell"
and Gary Trent Jr is basically Norman Powell but younger and a higher ceiling we have so many pieces to develop
"For the spurs:  Malcolm Brogdon - 2016  Kawhi Leonard - 2011  Jimmy Butler - 2011  Nikola Jokic - 2014  Last spot is between Derrick White, Norman Powell, and Larry Nance Jr. I'd say."
Well not unless they trade away CJ and bump Norman Powell back to SG where he should be. I really don't understand how when for years wing defence has been your biggest problem and you want to run 2 undersized guards at the wings....
"Trade suggestion:  * **PHI gets**: Damian Lillard * **LAL gets**: CJ McCollum, Norman Powell * **POR gets**: Russell Westbrook, Talen Horton-Tucker, Tyrese Maxey, Ben Simmons, 2022 FRP (via PHI), 2024 FRP (via PHI), 2026 FRP (via PHI), 2028 FRP (via PHI), 2025 FRP (via LAL)"
"That’s why I got downvoted. I would understand if you made some major changes and it just didn’t work out. But y’all have been essentially the same team for about 6 or 7 years now. The most notable changes y’all made ever since the Dame era is getting Norman Powell, signing bench Melo, and hiring Billups. How is that not mediocrity?"
I see Donte as Norman Powell Lite edition. Except Norman was more of a slasher and shooting was more of an issue.
"Norman powell, whenever cavs played raptors in the playoffs he would always seem to make every single 3 point shot . Always got overshadowed by getting swept but it felt like he was gonna steal a game by himself"
Norman Powell. Worst part is that we traded him for fucking General Greivous Vasquez.
Norman Powell every time
Trading the picks that were Norman Powell and OG for Vasquez comes to mind.
"&gt;2 way players  &gt;played good defence  Looks like you contradicted yourself. I’m not saying Danny G wasn’t an important piece.   And the reason was because SG was the worst position for the Raptors (as I have already stated). Danny’s replacement was Norman Powell who you for some reason excluded him from the rotation.   So again, you don’t know what you are talking about. Multiple errors on your end."
"The criteria in the draft is very few busts and a good number of players who over-achieve considering where they are drafted.  So for the Raptors these are their 1st round draft picks:  Scottie Barnes  Malachi Flynn  OG Anunoby  Jakob Poetl Pascal Siakam  Delon Wright  Bruno Caboclo (bust)  Terrence Ross  Jonas Valančiūnas  So 1 bust in 10 years. Pretty fucking good resume.  All of the players on this list are legit NBA rotation players, and a few have become borderline All Stars.   Pascal was selected 27th overall and is now a #1 option who scores +20-25 ppg, made an All Star Team and was All NBA.  OG was selected 23rd overall and is now one of the most versatile defenders in the league, and avgs +17 ppg and 40% from 3 point range.  And the list goes on.  And this is not including the undrafted talent (Norman Powell, Fred VanVleet, REDACTED) that they have managed to find over the years."
Is it just me or do John Collins and Jordan Poole look like they could be related? Kind of like Norman Powell and Andre Drummond.
"Ibaka definitely wasn’t the weak link. That dude came up huge multiple moments in the playoffs.   In the 76ers series it was the Raptors perimeter shooting that went ice cold, and FVV was unplayable for big stints.   Against the Bucks Danny Green was the worst player  And the Warriors would have been Danny Green followed by Norman Powell.   With OG being injured all playoffs too, the Raptors were only running a 8 man rotation with Pat McCaw, Jodie Meeks, and Jeremy Lin all fighting for the 9th roster spot and all playing at a level where an 8 man roster was needed. But the SG position was probably the most consistent position the Raptors struggled with during their 2019 title."
"Met Jamario Moon and Anthony Parker after a Raptors/Cavs game back in 2010. I don't remember the whole conversation but they were great for sure.  Same with Alvin Williams.  One of my parents used to work for an airline so would always run into pretty well-known people. Apparently Pascal Siakam and Nick Nurse are total saints. Norman Powell was apparently pretty quiet, but nice enough  Then randomly met Masai Ujiri in Mexico a few years ago, was honestly just like talking to any random person, but in a good way. Just super approachable. He ended up leaving the same day we did, so we saw him at the airport again heading back to Canada. Helped with his family's luggage and whatnot too since we were all going the same way"
"OG post all star break had his role and responsibilites increase due to Norman Powell getting traded, getting more on ball touches. Pre-All Star break he was at 13.8PGG on shooting splits of 47.9/39.5/75.5 on 60.7%TS. Post-All Star break, that increased to 18.3PGG on shooting splits of 48.0/40.1/81.6 on 60.3%TS. That came with more on ball touches via PnR off the wing or out of the corners, hands offs going from the mid to the wing and posting up other wings taking advantage of his size and strength to bully people. And even with that spike in usage and change in role, he kept his efficiency almost exactly the same. OG was a big part of the offense last season especially in the second half and will continue to be this season as a 1st/2nd option alongside FVV until Siakam returns from injury.   RJ is younger and could be in for a really big season. But right now at this very moment, OG is better and it isn't even a debate. A couple years down the line, my answer may change depending on how RJ develops."
"I was really high on Wiggins for a while. I thought he was a future star on a bad team, then I thought Butler/Thibs were putting him in a bad role. Wasn’t until year 5-6 that i realized he will be a good rotation player, but won’t be a star.  A rookie I was high on since the start was Norman Powell. When he was drafted he had insane measurables and did really well at the combine. I had courtside tickets to a game against the Pelicans, and I got to watch him play. His frame and speed were just insane (especially for a relatively raw rookie drafted in round 2), and his ability to create was what really impressed me. He was getting around guys and getting to his spots, but just couldn’t seem to sink the easy shot he created for himself. Right away I thought that he had the tools to be an all-star and I anticipated him making jumps for multiple years. While not an All-star, I would say he definitely lived up to his potential considering he was round 2"
"OG hit multiple stepbacks after breaking down his man in isolation against the Celtics in preseason, with one of those being against Horford. He has shown flashes of having enough of a handle to be eventually become a secondary/tertiary scorer and has expanded on that in preseason so far with him actually demanding the ball to go into ISO. He can dribble, it's just not a sick handle. Rudimentary, mechanical but with his shooting touch and size it is enough to score off lesser wing defenders or slower big men. He also showed this off last season post All Star break where he averaged a bit above 18PPG thanks to increased responsibility after Norman Powell traded."
"&gt;  But CJ is your Klay. We need Steph, Klay and Draymond. And you're trading Klay for Draymond.  But we have Norman Powell.  The last year he scored 20ppg on 65% TS and was the best corner 3 point shooter in the NBA.  CJ scored 22 on 58% TS.  I'm not going to say Powell is as good a scorer, but he's a very very good replacement considering what we gain elsewhere.  He's also a better defender than CJ.    Dame is the 2nd best deep threat in the NBA, Powell was the best corner shooter in the NBA, Roco shot 38% on 5 attempts, Simons shot 43% on 5 attempts, Nance can shoot, we're stacked on shooting.  It's a super easy decision for me."
"I'll never forget an article I read once that referred to ""Toronto Raptors Star Norman Powell""."
"Well let’s just hope a better option comes up sooner for all parties.  Because if I were a 76ers fan, and I lost Ben Simmons for, idk, Norman Powell &amp; filler, or have to send Ben + 1sts for McCollum, because it was the “best available”.. I’d lose my mind"
  PG: James Harden   SG: Norman Powell  SF: Royce O’Neal    PF: John Collins  C: Nerlens Noel
Lmfao Norman Powell and Carmelo lit up the series and nurkic was finally healthy. Tell me you didn’t watch the series outside of dame highlights without telling me
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
"Here’s a brief rundown of some of the current defending champions’ moves since they drafted their franchise player -   - Traded JJ Redick for two seconds because he was going to leave.   - Traded Ish Smith for Caron Butler. Ish has been a capable backup PG ever since, Butler played half a season off the bench and dipped.   - Drafted Jabari Parker over Embiid.   - Brought in Jason Kidd as coach. Even traded two 2nds for the privilege (fun fact: one of those 2nds later became Pat Connaughton).   - Traded for Caron Butler *again*, this time giving up capable backup Ersan Ilyasova. Immediately waived him.   - Drafted Rashad Vaughn in the first round.   - Same draft, traded a just-drafted Norman Powell and a future first that became OG Anunoby for Greivis Vasquez.   - Paid Greg Monroe $34m to be mediocre for two years.   - Shipped his ass to the Suns with a first rounder attached for HOF choke artist Eric Bledsoe.   - Drafted Thon Maker in the first round.   - Handed out terrible contracts to Delly, Tony Snell, John Henson *and* Miles Plumlee all in the space of two years.   - Got out of jail by managing to shift the Plumlee contract for scraps and sending Delly back to Cleveland along with Henson as salary filler but did have to give up a first to move Snell’s deal. That first became Kevin Porter Jr.   - Drafted DJ Wilson in the first round.   - Let Christian Wood leave for nothing.   - Traded four second rounders and Thon Maker for Nikola Mirotic, who proceeded to make playoff Bledsoe look like prime LeBron then dipped to Spain.   - Traded Malcolm Brogdon for a first and second because they didn’t want to pay him $80m.   - Traded every first round pick they could to the Pelicans to get a playable guard because the one they’d just given $50m to was awful and they traded the other one away.    You’d be surprised how much you can fuck things up and still contend. We only sucked for one year through all of that and we sure as hell weren’t gaining assets for it."
"Yes but you’re forgetting about Zion’s extra long wingspan, giving him a standing reach that would match an average player that is a couple of inches taller than him.   So he basically has a 6’9” body, but his head only reaches 6’7” if that makes sense. You could pretend he just is kissing 2 inches of length off his neck (which he lowkey might be lol).   You are right about timing thing though. It would be better for his defense if he was 7ft tall, even if he had to sacrifice some athleticism, for the exact reason you mention. I guess I’m just trying to advocate for the fact that height is way too overrated and wingspan/standing reach is the much more important metric for defense.   Just look at Norman Powell. He’s shown he’s capable of being a good defender at the SF position due to his freakish 6’11” wingspan despite his 6’4” height."
We gonna pretend like they didn't trade away Westbrook to get most of those guys? Portland also signed Norman Powell who is arguably as good as Dinwiddie.
marcus smart  blake griffin  norman powell  mikal bridges  and lastly  #i want Iguodala
Norman Powell sounds like the name of my local news weatherman... so he must be pretty intelligent right?
Norman Powell
"We only barely lost because FFV and Norman Powell, Gasol and Lowry went off from 3, 76ers couldn't shoot for shit, our paint defence has been second to none since Bud got here."
Norman Powell
Blazers according to draftnet. Dame=Jarret Jack  CJ= Steph Curry!! Norman Powell=Tony Allen RoCo= no comparison so I did Nance Jr Nance=Lou amundson Nurkic=Nikola Pekovic  I think we'd lose a play-in game.  Also stoked cause everyone beat their player comp.  Well CJ didn't but keep in mind this was 2013 Steph before Steph was Steph and I think CJ might be better then that version of Steph.  I mean his other comparison was Juan Dixon Soo . .. .
"Correct, but wouldn't the sixers want Norman Powell instead of a pick tho??"
Imo Norman Powell is more than capable of increasing his volume and replacing the majority of CJ’s scoring
Norman Powell?
"Lmao ok thanks for speaking for giannis.  &gt; vintage jordan   Kawhi had luck, a stacked team, and injuries to the warriors on his side, which harden never had (18-19 Durant missed a couple of games, but Chris Paul looked terrible. Even then, it was harden and a washed cp3 against 4 HOFers).   As far as Kawhi in Toronto...Siakam, lowry, FVV, ibaka, Norman Powell would've reached the ECF without him and probably would've beat that depleted warriors team without Kawhi."
"Offense:   Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Norman Powell, Carmelo Anthony, Jusuf Nurkic  Defense:   Norman Powell, Derrick Jones Jr, Robert Covington, Rondae Hollis Jefferson, Jusuf Nurkic."
Giannis and who?   Brogdon literally was favor to his agent. They had no intention of drafting him. They didn't care about the 46 pick so they just used if for a favor for an agent. One reason Brogdon was never really happy with the organization and wanted to leave.  Norman powell not our pick. kevin porter jr. also not our pick.  Thon Maker major miss. Rashad Vaughn miss. D.J. Wilson miss. Jabari Parker major miss.   Donte was a solid pick at 17.  Our contracts in the early Giannis area were more terrible however.
"I'm sorry, I'm probably just being whooshed. But the Bucks aren't good at drafting? They've drafted 2 first ballot hall of famers in the last 25 years. Also, aside from that, they drafted malcolm brogdon recently, who turned out to be a very good player. Also, as for just functional nba players, they drafted kevin porter jr., norman powell, and donte divincenzo since giannis got drafted. All three were drafted after the 16th pick of the draft. I would say they've done a great job drafting. That said, the trade makes complete sense and I really hope they win the championship."
They got Covington and Norman Powell for example.  If what he wanted was stars not role players then he should've let Portland trade CJ before signing the Supermax and completely hard cap the team.
Norman Powell is a champion??? Fuck Dame for this bullshit
"You and I both. Norman Powell and Roco is an upgrade, I thought they did a great job. I don’t know how much more improving they can actually do besides trading CJ"
I'll still wear my Norman Powell x Powell's Books shirt it's too dope not to lol
"Jaren Jackson, D'Angelo Russell, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Morris, Austin Rivers and Norman Powell(somewhat) were some that came to mind for me."
"You have Norman Powell and CJ McCollum in case you are well defended, speaking of defense you have Zach Collins Robert Covington AND Derrick Jones Jr defending. And a great Center in Nurkic and an excellent rebounder in Enes the Big Penis Kanter."
"&gt; Basically we need to package CJ and whatever picks it takes to bring in someone (or multiple players) that can potentially get us over the hump  What does a package like that look like? As in who would a good target be for the Blazers? Of course there's the Ben Simmons trade but how far does that move the needle for you guys?   I'm also assuming Norman Powell doesn't pick up his player option, so there's also having to pay him which is going to be close to or at around 20m?"
What is Norman Powell going to do in Free Agency?  Got to think he'll seek a bag elsewhere.
"CJ for Simmons is basically our only option, doesn’t help that we traded our most intriguing asset for like 3 months of underwhelming play from Norman Powell"
Portland handing out Gary Trent Jr 18m+ per year and him turning into an Evan Turner/Allen Crabbe pumpkin for 4 more years would've sank us. Trading him for a better player who was a UFA was the way smarter move. It only looks bad if we don't re-sign Norman Powell. I don't expect we'll let him walk.  There's absolutely no way anyone can criticize Portland for that trade... Unless they think Portland has been TOO AGGRESSIVE and needs to play things safer... Which would be dumb.
And you left out two guys better than Melo in Covington and Norman Powell
"Jamal Murray, MPJ, Will Barton for Dame, RoCo  Then Aaron Gordon for Norman Powell Sign and Trade"
I watched every single Raptors game and I can tell you for a fact that the lineups that were being run after the covid meltdown were some of the most fucked up ive ever seen and I lived thru the Andrea Baragnani days.   Lowry was playing games for 2 weeks with Norman Powell and 5 g league players through covid. The winning percentage this year is not on him.

"Raptors and it’s not close, you have Kawhi, Lowry, Siakam, OG, Gasol, Ibaka, FVV, and Norman Powell. That was Prime Kawhi in that 2019 Raptors squad."
The Bucks traded picks that ended up becoming Norman Powell and OG for Toronto for Grevis Vazquez who was out of the league in 2 years.
"To this day, I still don't understand how Masai turned an expiring Greivis Vazquez into Norman Powell and OG Anunoby."
"Thank and Let go CP3 this summer ,  Sign dinwiddie and norman powell for 15 each and pay cameron 10   Now you have a long term contender"
Grevis Vasquez for a 2nd round pick  and a future Clippers first.  Turned into Norman Powell and OG Anunoby lol
Wiggins and Norman Powell have the same value. Norm ain't no filler
I’m nearing ready to go in a completely different direction and trade Dame for Simmons/Curry/first round pick and let CJ average 30ppg with Simmons as PG and Nurkic in a high-screen game.   Simmons CJ Covington ??? Nurkic  Simons as 6th Man  I don’t thing Norman Powell will sign here unless CJ is traded and the short line-up last year woth Dame/CJ/Powell got wrecked by Austin Rovers and other bench players in the first round. It doesn’t work.
"Tbh FVV was a pretty bad roster fit for us coming into the league, we had a ton of guard depth that he was buried behind.  It's a testament to his hard work that he eventually beat out more ""talented"" guards like Delon Wright, Cory Joseph, Norman Powell, etc."
I’m gonna be really interested to see where Norman Powell lands and if he produces as much
if Oubre is getting 20 milly then I'm scared of what Norman Powell is gonna want from us.
They could get Norman Powell for less than that (annually)
This dude is a very poor man's Norman Powell.  1.3 ast / 1.3 to's a game is a disaster.  15 points on attrocious efficiency. Guy shot under 70% from the FT line.  Dude will be lucky to get the MLE
"I wanna make a team just for fun lol  Stockton, Wiggins, MWP, Rodman, Ayton   Norman Powell, Chris Boucher, Ariza are the next three up. Not much point to fill out the rest."
"DRose, Elfrid, and Frank are all FAs, they could let them all walk to sign Conley, him + Quickley is a solid PG tandem (even though DRose is a fan favorite). The only 3&amp;D wing worth a payday is Norman Powell anyways"
"If the blazers don’t re-sign Norman Powell this could be an epic mistake. You need to replicate that scoring if CJ leaves. I’m not sure where that narrative that Portland is only missing defense. Uh, no, they also couldn’t keep up with teams that had more offense threats"
"Nets: The big three with prime Blake, DJ, Aldridge, healthy Spencer Dinwiddie, prime Jeff Green, Joe Harris Heat Tyler Johnson, Knicks Shumpert(if not waived), Thunder Andre Roberson(if not waived).  Clippers: Kawhi, PG, Boogie, Rondo, Ibaka, Batum, Reggie Jackson, Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, Zubac, Pistons Kennard, Mavericks Yogi Ferrell.  Lakers: LeBron, Pelicans AD, Marc Gasol, Drummond, Harrell, Wesley Matthews, Schroder, Kuzma, Suns Markieff Morris, Pistons KCP, Suns Jared Dudley, Kings Ben McLemore.  76ers: Prime Dwight, Embiid, Simmons, Tobias, Spurs Danny Green, Pacers George Hill, Milton, Warriors Anthony Tolliver.  Suns: Prime CP3, Booker, Ayton, Crowder, Bridges, 76ers Saric, Hornets Kaminsky, Pelicans E'Twaun Moore.  Warriors: Steph, Klay, Draymond, T-Wolves Wiggins, Hawks Bazemore, Wizards Kelly Oubre, Damion Lee, Paschall.

Bucks: Giannis, Lopez, Holiday, Middleton, Teague, Portis, Tucker, Forbes.  Knicks: MVP Rose, Randle, Barrett, Taj Gibson, Elfrid Payton, Nerlens Noel, Pistons Reggie Bullock, Alec Burks, Quickley."
Even when he gets some value in the 2nd round he just gives those dudes away  Trading GTJ for 8 weeks or whatever or Norman Powell is an insane decision  And yet some of our fan base think 99% of our problems have been solved by firing Terry Stotts  The Nurk trade wasn’t even intentional. He just didn’t want to pay Plumlee
"Overall in history? Vince Carter.  Still playing today? Gonna zag on ya and say Norman Powell. Maybe I'm biased as a Raptors fan, but watching a 6'4 guard with a 6'10 wingspan yam it over and over every game is super entertaining."
"You’re correct that Ingram mostly shoots 3s above the break both this year and last.  But Ingram took 1.5 more catch and shoot 3s per game than pull up 3s and shot 43.2% on them. And while he attempted less than he had the previous year, he was still making only .4 per game fewer than last year.   He averages more made catch and shoot 3s than Huerter, Gallinari, Ingles, Reggie Jackson and Seth Curry and the same as Gary Trent Jr, Mikal Bridges, and Norman Powell."
" * Coach Nate McMillan leaves for House Hawks and is on the brink of being eliminated from the Eastern Finals.  * House Suns wins the West for the first time since 1993.  * New fevers spread across the west.  The Reggie Jackson fever and the Deandre Ayton fever.  Khwai fever hasn't been cured.  * House pistons win the Lottery.   * The blazers house chapter:   Blazers obtain Norman Powell at the cost of Rodney Hood and Gary Trent Jr.  House Blazers gets eliminated and Coach Stotts gets banished after a long tenure.  Chauncey Billups of house Clippers takes Stotts place as a controversial hire.   Zach Collins reinjured his ankle and is still unable to contribute to the team.  Teams are in belief that Blazers might not be far away from blowing up and are sending messengers.  House Blazers are getting messages from house 76ers, and house Celtics about blowing up the team (Dame, CJ, Norman Powell)."
"Ok now why would the Knicks sign Norman Powell or Reggie Jackson? We'd save more money resigning Burks to play Powell's role, and Jackson's a massive waste of time."
And fuck Norman Powell apparently
Norman Powell
"Demar, JV, Norman Powell"
"Alright so the top from the rest of the pack.  Rozier, Booker, Oubre, Turner, Harrell, Delon Wright, Richaun Holmes, Larry Nance Junior, Norman Powell.  Thats leaving out Osman, Jason Richardson, Tyus Jones, and Portis."
"Hmm then it might not be the worst thing. It would all be dependent on Norman Powell re signing I think, but I don’t think that’s all that likely"
Casey is not a good coach. He continually buried Norman Powell’s and JV’s confidence by benching them whenever they made mistakes. Even when Powell saved us in the playoffs he then relegated him back to minimal playing time the next round. He didn’t adjust in the playoffs. He was like coach Bud. Nurse worked with the bench in the final year and our bench mob was almost as good as the starters
"You are speaking facts, friend. People don’t realize he was by far and away our worst defender vs the clippers. Replacing him with Norman Powell would be a huge win."
Here I’ll do it with out including a player being paid more than 20 mil AAV besides Ben and no rookies sound fair?   PG: Dejounte Murray - 16 Mil AAV  SG: Norman Powell - 10.4 AAV  SF: TJ Warren - 11.7 AAV  PF: Christian Wood - 13.6 AAV  C: Ben Simmons  6th Man: Jordan Clarkson - 12.8 AAV  Backup Center for Point Simmons: Serge Ibaka - 9.4 AAV
"While I like Norman Powell, I don’t think he’s such a huge difference maker that the trade makes a huge amount of sense. It feels like the teams swapped relatively equal players when neither made a significant impact on their fortunes."
"I have a feeling Norm Powell for Gary Trent Jr. will be like this. The Blazers didn’t want to pay Gary Trent Jr., so they traded him for Norman Powell . . . who has a very similar game to Gary Trent Jr., but is five years older AND Powell is a free agent who’ll likely command as much, if not more, than Trent."
"I think he peaks as a Norman Powell type player, maybe better vision, both guys play downhill who are strong for their position with kind of funky looking shots, but can definitely hit open ones.   THT needs to learn how to pick his spots and slow down sometimes, something Norm has struggled with his whole career"
Norman Powell is most definitely opting out.
"As an honest Jaylen Brown fan I must admit that he deserves to be traded for Norman Powell. If we must, we should throw in a pick as well. Not only that but Jaylen is worthless and his 40 point games are all flukes. If Tatum and Jaylen are stars, why aren’t the Celtics winn- oh shit they are- the Celtics are only winning because of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown is doing nothing. The Green Teamers will disagree but you know it’s true, Jaylen is not a good player. Remember, all this is coming from an honest fan. Me, u/devic3."

"I think a championship contender was an ambitious ask honestly. After Kyrie left they were due for a youth movement imho. Getting to another conference finals after he left was nothing short of astounding  Usually teams that need space can trade their crap money with picks to tanking teams and the Celtics were really clear candidates for that with 2 stars under 25. They didnt have a plan for their draft picks and they were a step slow in assessing if they could really win a title, which is entirely fine but with some of the older guys on the roster you wonder if they could have been in the market for some more young rotation level giards/wings that they were really hurting for this year like Gary Harris, Norman Powell, Bryn Forbes, Duncan Robinson. Those type of guys could have really helped realign the franchise on Tatum/Brown's timeline. And they really didn't have a clue what they wanted with their picks anyways."

Kawhi - superstar obviously but I feel like he'll just stay home  DeMar - definitely had a career resurgence but I think a huge part of that has been him moving to the 4. If this is a point you'd want to debate though I'd be happy to listen because there definitely is an argument.  Doug McDermott - see above   Otto Porter Jr - high on the guy but extremely injury prone   Norman Powell / Will Barton / Josh Hart - undersized for the 3  Batum - Potentially an option but he's getting up there in years and I think he'll only be motivated on a true contender   Oubre / Fournier - solid players but flawed and really don't get teams like the Blazers over the hump  Iggy / Ariza - Old
Norman Powell
"Lonzo almost certainly wouldn't be involved because he's a RFA. It's possible, but complicated.   The real question is if BI goes or not.   If BI stays, a starting lineup of Dame, Lonzo, BI, Zion and Adams or Jaxson Hayes will put up record breaking offense and the only question will be defense and depth.   They can use Bledsoe and remaining picks to grab defense and depth though, targeting guys like Hield, Barnes, Duncan Robinson, Norman Powell, OG Anunoby and maybe PJ Tucker.  Regardless of whl they get to fill out the roster, that's definitely a top 3 seed if healthy.   If BI goes, that'll likely leave the Pelicans with 5ish tradable 1st round picks along with 5ish swaps and at least one promising young player. Basically what the Clippers gave up for PG.   They could use those to go for the 3rd star, along with salary from Bledsoe or Adams to go after a guy like Jeremi Grant, Jaylen Brown, Siakam, Sabonis, Donovan Mitchell, PG, SGA or KAT, depending on who becomes available."
"Did they try and tank this season? I thought they were just bad and dealt with a lot of injuries. Trading Norman Powell for Rodney Hood and Trent Jr.  was a weird move, I do agree that is a bit of tanking.   Now they have to overpay for a one-dimensional shooter in Trent Jr. who managed to lose his spot in the rotation at the end of the season or that trade is a disaster. Trent Jr. shot less than 40% for the Raptors 35% from 3, and had a 50% TS. That’s a concern, isn’t it?"
"u/devic3: As an honest Jaylen Brown fan I must admit that he deserves to be traded for Norman Powell. If we must, we should throw in a pick as well.

"(Nuggets fan btw)  **PERFECT:** The Kroenkes hold true to Tim Connelly's statement of being willing to go deep into the luxury tax, and we pick up somebody like Norman Powell, while Barton declines his player option. MPJ Extension gets done, and he develops his ball handling skills and defensive ability.  Jamychal Green opts in to his contract. Sign some backup center who can rim protect. Murray comes back healthy mid-season and returns to form by the start of the postseason.  **REALISTIC:** Will Barton either picks up his contract or declines and returns on a \~15M APY deal. We give MPJ the max. Re-sign Austin Rivers to a relatively inexpensive deal. Sign a backup 5 like Tony Bradley. Otherwise, run it back with current squad. Murray returns by the postseason, but won't return to his pre-injury form until the 22-23 season.  **WORST:** Will Barton and Jamychal Green decline their player options and leave for another team, while the front office doesn't do much to find replacements. MPJ declines any contract offer we put on the table this offseason forcing him to enter RFA in 2022. Murray never returns next season at all."
"The guy your responding to is a real life meme.

"I haven't watch enough games of Norman Powell but from the few games I watched, I don't think he can be relied on to be Dame's 2nd option. Thoughts?"
"While I don't disagree, I'm curious what your thoughts are regarding a Dame and Norman Powell set of guards. What I'm getting at is, is it the size or the lack of defense you think is a bigger problem?"
Norman Powell and Fred Vanvleet. Sorry couldn't help myself. Go get that chip Bucks!
"Olshey should have been fired anyways.  Nothing personal against the guy, he and his team are very good at evaluating guards and he's made some good trades, but the dude doesn't know what a forward is.  We were putting 6'3 Norman Powell on Denver's 6'10 forwards."
"If we're talking ceiling, Mann could do the same. I don't think it's likely he hits it, but given the where their careers are/were Mann's potential is much higher than Norman Powell."
Norman Powell/Bogdan Bogdanovic type of player
I don't see this comp at all. CJ has a midrange/floater game and tends to avoid contact. I think he plays way more like Norman Powell.
A Norman Powell type.
"In this season's roster, we're saturated at guard.  Dame, CJ, Norman Powell, Anfernee Simons.  But Powell is a FA with no guarantees he will return, and CJ is more than likely to be traded.  Even if we retain Norman Powell, if CJ is gone I'd like to have THJ over Gallo."
I once thought Norman Powell was the next Russell Westbrook and a future all star
Gary Trent is now in Toronto. Norman Powell is in Portland.
They traded Gary Trent for Norman Powell on an expiring.
"Bucks aren't really a draft and development team. Giannis is the only starter at the moment (with Divincenzo out) that they drafted. The second best player they drafted (Brogdon) is now on the Pacers. Other excellent players they found were given up on too early (Norman Powell and Christian Wood). However they definitely developed the hell out of Middleton after acquiring him to become what he is, they rehabilitated George Hill and Lopez, and they have developed guys like Connaughton, Portis, etc to be excellent bench players.   A lot of it has to do with Giannis-- he's so good that all these shooters around him get a chance to build their game without as much defense pestering their shots. It's done wonders for a lot of guys. You see Portis have a great shooting season and it makes you think that a lot of players could show up on the Bucks next year and have career years in order to get paid elsewhere."
"&gt; I’ve qualified nothing other than if Norm Powell is your second best scorer, there will be many first round exits in the future.  Which I just showed you is stupid...because Norman Powell is a better scorer than the second best scorer on multiple teams that are past the 1st round lol.  I'm confused what you're not understanding.  He's clearly good enough to be the 2nd best scorer on very good teams."
"How do you guys not see it? Portland can go into the luxury tax for Dames last 3 years. Resign Norman and run out a line up of Dame,Powell,Simmons,Robert and Nurk. That line up will score enough and the defense will be light-years better, especially if Covington and Nurk stay healthy."

"I disagree with all of that. Nurkic is the only one that might be a starter. CJ, Norman, Powell etc might be good bench pieces. Melo shouldn't even be in the league."
"He has CJ/Norman Powell/ Melo who can all score very well and somewhat initiate the offence if Dame wants to play offball. Nurkic is a good big, just very injury prone. Robert Covington is a good wing defender who can knock down some 3s. Anfernee Simons is a great spark off the bench and is a very good shooter, he is only scratching his potential. Zach Collins was good, no idea what he's like now after the injuries.   All in all, Portland have a good roster. It's just very unbalanced because of their lack of defensive stoppers. They would literally need maybe 2/3 trades and their team, on paper anyway, can be 1-4th seed in the west."
"It's not really the same situation, because Portland needs defensive help, while Philly could use McCollum's shooting and crafty play.  Also, for Portland's offence, Norman Powell is a great shooter and slasher. And Nurkic has a decent shot.  I thought even last week that Simmons-McCollum trade would be a win-win... but yeah, after this recent playoff run by Simmons, it's debatable now.  They would definitely need him to become at least a 60% free throw shooter, and be more aggressive in driving and in the open court.  But I could still see it working.  McCollum is too redundant and similarly-sized to Lillard, so Portland needs to trade him."
ahead of norman powell and the rest ? nah
It balances out Portland if we resign Norman Powell.  Playing Norman at SF was a big mistake.  Lillard/Norm/Covington/Ben/Nurkic is better than Lillard/CJ/Norm/Covington/Nurkic.
"The thing with the blazers is that they do have Norman Powell, and if he is willing to resign, he can totally slot into CJ's starting spot. He would be cheaper,  play better defense, and be better driving to the hoop,  even if he does not have CJ's elite midrange handles.   The ideal situation would be to trade CJ for a good wing player with size,  defense, and playmaking. More the question would be is Ben Simmons the best wing we can fetch for CJ? Simmons certainly has the size,  defense, and playmaking, but his shooting is perhaps irrevocably broken and he doesn't appear to care to try to fix his game.   Still this still might be the best the blazers can get to try to make a final run in Dame's prime. It's not like we can turn CJ into Jaylen Brown or Paul George or Kris Middleton."
"I get the vibe that it’s not so much CJ is unhappy, rather it’s the fans want to see some drastic change because Dame isn’t getting any younger and they can’t get over the hump. If I’m a portland fan I wouldn’t mind seeing Dame, CJ, and Norman Powell (if he re-signs) run it back for a full season with a new coach"
"I was baffled at that one while it happened, Bridges seemed like a polished 3&amp;D guy already, and Zhaire Smith seemed like a project David Nwaba with a Norman Powell ceiling. I didn't understand it."
"Nah any trade with Ben Simmons that doesnt include him going to Shanghai is gonna be downvoted and a ""hell no"" for these teams lol.  Also, pairing Ben and Dame would be extremely interesting. This is interesting though, instead of seeing Nurkic/Kanter guard an opposing big man like Jokic or AD, you have Ben do that. I dont think it'll work unless Portland resigns Norman Powell bc they do need a secondary scoring option next to Dame.  I dont think Indiana doesnt take it because I dont think McCollum &gt; Brogdon and Levert, maybe TJ Warren instead of Levert.  Doc would love Brogdon though, would be a great improvement of spacing and shooting for that team."
"He will commit to that. Think about Philly's roster. Who the hell is playing point guard if not Simmons, they don't have a playmaker. This series does not change his past 4 years as a player. He's been the same dude, and he will fit well with Dame. The key in this scenario is Norman Powell being able to keep up how he played in Toronto this season."
The hope is that Norman Powell will resign. Melo and Anfernee Simons are also good shooters and ball handlers. And you would have to try to find another capable shot creator who could come off the bench.
"Any CJ trade is predicated on retaining Norman Powell, who's a better fit next to Dame and can reasonably be expected to score more with more touches, based on what we saw this season and what all the Raps fans have been saying about him. Other than that it might get a little dicey if Roco is cold and we lose Melo to free agency but I still think it puts us in a better spot. We've got wildcards in Zach Collins' return, Ant Simons probably coming back, and the possibility of Nurk getting better at the rim, he's an offensive powerhouse if he works on his finish."
"Dame will have to drop 50 points a game lol. can you imagine how much he has to score with Simmons on the floor.   especially when like everyone else on that team besides Norman ""Nobody should have all that"" Powell can score"
Bring Norman Powell back and move him to SG. Then have Simmons at SF. He's a better fit than CJ.
"I don't know about 1 and 3 but legit, everyone can name that one role player to watch out for when he's playing. Norman Powell is decent but he smoked the pistons this year. He's at least a know commodity, until this year I was convinced Kelly Oubre was good because he lit up the pistons regularly and, frankly, how many other suns games was I watching."
"The Raptors used small ball this season due to aroma baynes being subpar. Wity the addition of Gillespie and birch, I'm not sure if they will continue it or not. They used it when they beat the bucks in the regular season.  [source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/ca.nba.com/amp/news/toronto-raptors-pros-and-cons-of-playing-small-ball-og-anunoby-norman-powell-vanvleet-lowry-siakam/1t6hiefoqjucw1ocwbi6nlpirj)"
I hope the trade CJ and Norman fucking Powell becomes the second option just to show you how dumb your take is.  The problem in Portland has nothing to do with the backcourt.
"Norman Powell is not and will never be the second option on a real team.  If he is, you in trouble   CJ is a perfect compliment to dame so I don’t see why they would trade him"
Raptors' top 15 players not in this postseason:  |1|Pascal Siakam| --:|:--| |2|Fred VanVleet| |3|Norman Powell| |4|Kyle Lowry| |5|OG Anunoby| |6|Chris Boucher| |7|Malachi Flynn| |8|Terence Davis| |9|Aron Baynes| |10|DeAndre' Bembry| |11|Freddie Gillespie| |12|Stanley Johnson| |13|Yuta Watanabe| |14|Paul Watson| |15|Matt Thomas|
"At least Norman Powell is out west now, that dude was a Milwaukee killer"
We have one of the most deadly offensive player in our league. Plus i think the core is to retain Norman Powell
That’s because Portland has a terrible defense and their backcourt plus Norman Powell is still giving up 6 inches. Let’s not pretend like he had an amazing Portland series. I watched every single Nuggets game this year and he was exposed tremendously by playoffs
Norman Powell
"Assuming full fitness and like 95% appearances.  Curry, PG13, LeBron, KD, Gobert/Bam/AD could probably do it.  You'd still need a stacked bench but something like  Van Vleet, Mikal Bridges, Covington, Crowder, Claxton/Allen should be enough shooting and defence.  I didn't go for Kawhi - because of appearances even when fit.  And I prefer PG13 compared to harden with a LeBron ball team.  Aside from that the teams only major weakness is a lack of high Volume efficient 3pt shooting off the bench aside from Van Vleet. So someone like Norman Powell could work.  I also think you could probably get it to work on a reasonable salary total say 165 mil for nets and warriors totals. You'd have had to draft amazingly for it to work but: Zion, Doncic, Bam, Tatum are all on rookie deals this season. So that is like 40 mil for 4 all-stars. Add in 40 mil for lebron and 45 mil for steph to take it to 125 mil. You then have like 40 mil for 7 guys.  Crowder 10 mil  Bridges 5 mil  Brunson 3 mil.  Then you have 22 mil for a centre another good wing defender, an elite 3pt shooter and probably another great defender."
Loved how Norman Powell acted truly innocent when you can clearly see his hand push Book’s shooting arm
Well you should go find Norman Powell and tell him to play legal defense.
Shoutout Norman Powell
Refs fucking hate Norman Powell
Ben Simmons?  PG: Ben Simmons / Malcolm Brogdon Marcus Smart  SG: Terry Rozier / Alec Burks / Buddy Hield  SF. Mikal Bridges / Norman Powell / Gary Trent Jr  PF: OG Anunoby / Jerami Grant / Marcus Morris  C: Myles Turner / Nikola Vucevic / Jakob Poeltl
Yeah worked really well when we had aminu and harkless as our forwards. Now it’s Norman Powell and roco shooting those shots. Not to mention dame has just gotten better
"Was foolproof a few years ago, but you can’t say he hasn’t improved since then. And now with CJ playing better than ever and Norman Powell on the roster they’re super dangerous offensively"
I legit think Norman Powell is as good as him. Maybe better.   But you have to say if CJ is cooking when things are tight it’s truly special. Can get a good look( for him) whenever he wants
"Even Blazer fans are mixed. Some think he’s a top 25 player, truly all star level. Others think he’s a glorified Lou Williams at worst. I’m somewhere in the middle and think he’s a good iso scorer, decent ball handler but nothing much else. I think our new guy Norman Powell is a more complete, impactful player"
"We have Norman Powell, so I don't see a reason to worry."
"One the idea that CJ is some playoff killer is just not remotely rooted in fact. Even the Denver series where people always repeat CJ carried Dame:  CJ 26ppg and 3 assists on 53%TS   Dame 25ppg and 7 assists on 53%TS  CJ's last playoff series: 53%TS, 52%TS, 61%TS, 51%TS, 51%TS  He only brings scoring to the table, and his scoring just completely goes as his jumpshot goes.  There's no consistency cause he doesn't get to the line and takes tons of really hard shots.    Two we now have Norman Powell.  Seems pretty damn obvious that we should move CJ for a wing"
"Norman Powell is still in the nba, so probably not"
"We’ll be rooting for (in some shape or form)  - RJ Barrett and the Knicks - Norman Powell and the Trail Blazers - Jonas Valanciunas, Dhillon Brooks and the Grizzlies - Steve Nash and the Nets (I know a few Canadian Suns fans that were still riding the 7SOL version of the team) - DeMar DeRozan and the Spurs"
"Don't trade anybody for a PG.   There's a lot of promising PGs in this draft that could slip to them, Lowry and Conley are on the market this summer. Also get Norman Powell."
"Norman Powell has never lost to the lakers in his whole career, easy win for Portland"
"The Pelicans already have a pretty good offense, they've been top 10 all season. I don't think they need to start a stretch big . Their defense is trash though  If we were giving the Pels lineup a makeover you'd want a better guard to replace Bledsoe (a player like Malcolm Brogdon, lets say.. or maybe NAW turns into that guy) and a more consistent 3&amp;D player to replace Lonzo (think Norman Powell). With Zion developing so quickly they aren't far off, but they can't stand pat with their current set up."
Hindsight is 20/20 this sub was ripping the Raps apart for not trading a  1st and Norman Powell for Drummond... Drummond still may be better than Bayne  though?
"Suns: CP3 has been my favourite non-raptor for a very long time, and it’d be cool to see him finally win a ring. (Suns fans have had it really rough, especially these last few years so it’d also be cool to see them celebrate)  Nuggets: Even with Murray out they’ve been amazing, and they’ve properly built their team from the ground up so they’re easy to cheer for.   Portland: They have Norman Powell, I am legally required to root for them."
"Fwiw, the Blazers have the 6th best Net Rating in the league since Nurk returned and Norman Powell premiered (they did this on the same day).  Oddly enough, we have a worse record over that stretch than we do earlier in the year, but a wayyyyyy better margin of victory.   It looks like we started to suck in the 2nd half (and we had our moments), but overall we've actually improved quite a bit with Norm/Nurk and of course CJ.  Our starting lineup of Dame/CJ/Norm/RoCo/Nurk also has a net rating of like 13.5+ which I think is #1 for starting lineups in the league."
Norman Powell
"Oh absolutely no argument that we're poorly constructed. That's actually exactly my point. When we lose two of our best 3 players, the next best guy we are putting on the floor is...Enes Kanter? Norman Powell just showed up, but hasn't been here most of the season. The schedule has been grueling for every team, these guys bodies can't take it. It's messed up. But I guess what I was trying to say was that when the Lakers didn't have AD, they had Bron. When you didn't have PG, you had Kawhi. And vice versa. We had 2 of our 3 best players out for most of the season. At the same time. And Damian got us where we are, effectively single handedly.  And Patrick Beverley is trash, you guys not being able to play him does the entire league a service."
I don't think the Norman Powell takes were serious but the fact that two people said it is interesting.
A massive part of it is how genuinely awful Bledsoe was. He was our third option and a borderline all star in the regular season so when he goes completely ice cold it’s a big loss and he became a liability to even have on the floor. Another big part of it is how hot Miami and Toronto’s shooters got. Fred VanVleet and Norman Powell were absolutely unguardable in our series. Same with Tyler Herro and even Jae Crowder in the Miami series. I’m just saying you have to look at things with context because a lot of things that caused us to lose are not the norm whatsoever
"Right. Are they better than the clippers, lakers, jazz, nuggets and Suns now?  Do they have a brighter future than the Nuggets, Mavs, jazz, and even pelicans?  Hell, I would rather be GM of the Suns right now than the blazers. I don’t know if I’d move Dame because he is the franchise. But It’s a tough situation. Your best player is a point guard who isn’t Steph curry. Your second best player is an undersized shooting guard who doesn’t defend well, and next year they have $120 million committed even when Norman Powell opts out. And you can’t trade Gary Trent and then let Powell, who’s good walk away. Nurkic isn’t fully guaranteed but I doubt they don’t guarantee him, and when they do, they’re likely at $136 million with powell, maybe even $140 million, and that’s with 9 players.  In 2024, dame and CJ will combine for 85 million. Oof. I don’t see a scenario where you can compete and pay your backcourt that are both well over 30 $85 million"
pretty terrible. Lonzo Ball and Norman Powell best players avaulable
Norman Powell can be a great signing.
Norman Powell is better than him tho?
Blazers got finessed by Toronto with the Norman Powell trade..
Norman Powell
There is this guy called Norman Powell...
"Lol Norman Powell = PF, RoCo =  SF; wtf?"
I mean it’s just weird if you compare this foul on Dwight Powell that was a flagrant; and the foul on Norman Powell when knockout that Boston player today (Smart if I’m not mistaken). That was a common foul lol.
Norman Powell
n Norman Powell elbowed smart in the head
"If MPJ truly breaks out, then he might be second option even when Murray returns. In the meantime, Nuggs can probably get by next season just signing an above average SG, Norman Powell would be ideal. I think he can fill in the Murray role."
Norman Powell
I like the idea of picking up Norman Powell in FA
"holy shit norman powell lost 10% off his 3 point shooting since he got there, yikes"
We’re in a pretty bad position to make a significant trade tbh. Gary Trent Jr was probably our most intriguing trade asset and we traded him for a few months of Norman Powell
"Norman Powell who kept playing behind other SGs and SFs, but once he got starter minutes for a few weeks/ months last year he started to really drastically improve his game"
Norman Powell or Jusuf Nurkic for sure.
Norman powell is not bad as a second option and he is a free agent this off season
"So you don’t think teams have different defensive game plans from a generic 29 ppg scorer on 60% TS and a generic 35 ppg scorer on 58% TS? Because of course they do, I mean they even started gameplanning Harden different when his scoring first increased to that next level in 2017 and didn’t stop until 2019.   Role players hitting an additional 58% TS from corner 3s. This isn’t them not hitting shots then all of a sudden hitting 8 shots. This is those role players getting an additional 8 shots on top of what they are already getting.   But Harden doesn’t just have an advantage from playmaking, he also clearly has an advantage from scoring. The difference in 2018 scoring (36 ppg on 61.6% TS vs 28 ppg on 64.4% TS) is equivalent to the difference between Devin Booker (25.5 ppg on 58.5% TS) and Norman Powell (18.6 ppg on 62% TS) this season. I would love to see you make this exact same argument, that Norman Powell is on the same level scoring as Devin Booker, as you are making for Harden and Giannis. Little bit tougher to see the legitimacy of the argument when you remove the bias behind Harden’s name."
"This doesn't tell you if it's a drive, an offensive rebound, a cut, etc. Based on the eye test of watching 90% of Blazers games, it's very rare I see DJJ take a guy off the dribble, or take off with the ball on a fast break. That's not the offensive scheme either. Norman Powell is a ferocious slasher. Even Al Faruq-Aminu used to stumble down the court and take it to the rack for us. (He had way too much leash with the ball)  Likewise with Simons, he seems to be afraid of contact at the hoop despite being extremely athletic. If he can add that to his game, he will be a potent offensive player. He's already a positive in OBPM for us."
"I will never figure out why they didn't trade Lowry this year and try to get something for him. You're clearly not going anywhere and traded Norman Powell so you were already punting the season a little. Could have helped jump start to the next era of Raptors basketball.   I think the Siakam contract looks rough but if they can get a true #1 guy in there he's a great second fiddle, he's just miscast as having to be ""the dude."" Elsewhere there are some nice pieces like Anunoby still has room to grow and is already an elite defender. Guys like Boucher and Trent are solid young players who can contribute on a winning team. Malachi Flynn has show plenty of flashes in the past few weeks too.   I really don't think Toronto is too far off they have plenty of guys who can be great role players and a guy who can be the 2nd best player on at least a conference finals team. It's really just about trying to land a true superstar to complement all of that. Of course that's way easier said than done but if they can I don't hate a lot of pieces on this roster.   Oh and playing in their actual city will help too."
"Wut? Starter Bogdan is averaging 4 assists per game, starter Powell barely averages 2 assists per game. Norman is a straight shooter, he has 0 playmaking in his arsenal."

"No, Kawhi was not the biggest reason - it was the fact that once klay was down, the raptors pretty much had better players from 2-8  Steph Kawhi is close, Lowry was better than dray (and better than klay too imo), and from there it's iggy, looney, cousins, mckinnie, bogut vs ibaka, vanvleet, siakam, gasol, danny green, norman powell"
"Instead of trying to rebuild, how about we finally just try a different head coach for once? We've had the same guy for 9 fucking years.   Also lets switch to Norman Powell as the starting 2 guard (an excellent 2 guard defender) and trade CJ for something else.  Seems way more logical than selling the farm. There's great pieces on this team, it's not time to give up."
I love the narration  “Taps the backboard... ok Little... man down... bye bye norman Powell... take 3”
Assuming Norman opts out then they will be at roughly 120 million and can only retain Norman Powell if they keep his 13 million cap hold which would put them at 133 million and over the luxury tax assuming Norman gets something like 18+ million a year then they would be paying the luxury tax for a team that likely wont even make it past round 1 or 2
"A shooter, Ideally Norman Powell or Gary Trent, tho I don’t think either is leaving their new teams"
Norman Powell is open on a lot of plays.
"Decent, a couple bench pieces switched for Norman Powell and Dame is out of his mind. But as always the health factor is a play. If you guys have luck,with bron out and not at 100% you can make a deep run"
Norman Powell does aswell
"Norman freaking Powell. He threw a Harry Potter Theme Gender Reveal for his sister. Like he was on Etsy and Amazon for weeks to throw this huge party. Plus, he brushed up on his ASL skills and hopes to communicate with a crowd in Phoenix after COVID. And he still sits on his mother lap. I encourage everyone to read Jason Quick recent piece on Norm, literally shed a tear"
"His minutes were going down this since march, and then Norman Powell came to town. Bridge’s has had consistent solid minutes in Jim’s rotation.   Anyway just the amount of dunks you’d see game in and game out because Miles is a lot more involved in general i’m always expecting a highlight"
"Dwight ""Norman"" Powell"
Man now we gotta watch more norman powell
Excuse me - you just got a superstar win in Norman Powell.
"Between last year and this year Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka left town (and their age was showing anyway).  Kyle Lowry turned 35 and his age is showing.   Paskal Siakam, last year's break out star, suddenly can't hit threes. And they traded Norman Powell, who wasn't a star but was a solid player."
not to mention norman powell playing the 3
Norman Powell should be the first option with Dame out and not CJ
I love Norman Powell
We all know Kawhi isn't playing tonight because he didn't want to go up against Norman Powell again
Norman Powell
Paul Millsap as a late show band leader!  Norman Powell as Franciscan Friar!  Wow this is fun
Superstars attract more viewers = more money. I don't think names like Norman Powell or Joe Ingles will attract viewership.
We can trade CJ this offseason now that we have Norman Powell.  Norm is the perfect 2/3 guard to have starting next to Dame IMO.
"We're more down on Terry Stotts than any individual player right now. I'd probably have a better opinion of Melo and Kanter if we had a coach that would limit them to the match-up dependent role players that they are instead of making them a featured part of our rotation.   I've never been a trade CJ guy (unless a great trade comes along obviously) but now that we've acquired Norman Powell, it just doesn't make sense to have CJ anymore. Re-sign Norman for 20-25M per year next season (CJ for reference makes fucking 30M+), and trade CJ for something else. Whether it's a Tobias Harris/Harrison Barnes swap, or a young dude (Deandre Hunter would be a dream) + expiring's/draft picks, it just doesn't make sense to have him anymore now that we have Norm (who has plus plus measurables as a defensive 2).  In an ideal world we trade CJ for some kind of a forward, fire Terry, let Melo/Kanter expire into the sunset, Zach Collins accepts his QO, DJJ opts into his 2nd year and we re-sign Norman Powell to a 4 year 20-ish million dollar long term deal."
Trade for Norman Powell
Also in r/nba: “We should trade Jaylen Brown for Norman Powell.”  I think everyone in this sub can guess who said it.
Norman Powell.
"?  Do we have the worst winning percentage in American professional sports?  We have double the playoff series wins as your franchise despite the fact that we left the city, then came back as an expansion?  We are poverty but y'all take it to a disgraceful level. Like not owning your draft pick with a capped out roster that ended up with the worst record in the league disgraceful. We've done stupid shit but y'all constantly are just lowering the bar.   Maybe if we subvert the cap to sign Norman Powell to an under-the-table deal, then we can be on your level."
Norman Powell been solid for us. A win-win for both Blazers and Raptors
"Would Norman Powell be next, you think?"
"u/devic3: As an honest Jaylen Brown fan I must admit that he deserves to be traded for Norman Powell. If we must, we should throw in a pick as well. Not only that but Jaylen is worthless and his 40 pt game was a fluke. If Tatum and Jaylen are stars, why aren’t the Celtics winn- oh shit they are- the Celtics are only winning because of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown is doing nothing. The Green Teamers will disagree but you know it’s true, Jaylen is not a good player. Remember, all this is coming from an honest fan. Me, u/devic3."
norman powell and robert covington appreciation comment
Robert Covington and Norman Powell.. two corporate names
"Michael Porter Jr., Buddy Hield, and Norman Powell."
"Really miss all those Raptors squads. 2010s post Sacremento trade was really a special era built up to the ring with Kawhi and the Raptors. It brings a small tear to my eyes thinking about all those playoff moments, shortcomings, successes we had, and the individual players involved. Every year, and every playoff was special.  The whole F Brooklyn thing, losing a close 7 game series to Brooklyn on a missed layup by Lowry, getting swept by the Wizards the following year (Vasquez shimmy moment), beating Paul George and the Pacers (the beginnings of the real Playoff P Norman Powell), beating Wade and the heat, beating Giannis and the bucks, getting beat by LeBron year after year. There's just so much history and moments.  Seeing players getting traded was always tough too. Seeing JV come back to Toronto to watch our playoff games after he got traded to Memphis was rough.  Sometimes it really sucks to be a fan of a sports team, it can be such an emotional rollercoaster it can be heartbreaking at times, but for the Raptors it's worth it."
"Hope Norman Powell gets paid, great guy"
"Nah because as a celtics guy, I've feared Powell.. You can say all you want about when Smart blocked that shot in the playoffs, but Norman scares me because of those playoffs."
THAT'S WHY YOU TRADE FOR NORMAN POWELL
Where is Norman Powell?
Damn I missed that.   Norman Powell seems available. Dunno if $14M is enough for him.
"Masai just on the Raptors  (discounting the Melo trade in Denver that was amazing and the Kawhi trade because we all know):  - Traded Bargnani's awful contract for a lottery pick    used to select Jakob Poeltl.   - Traded Greivis Vasquez to the Bucks for 2 picks that turned into OG Anunoby and Norman Powell.   - Signed Fred VanVleet to an undrafted deal.   - Traded Valanciunas, Wright and picks for an old Marc Gasol so we could win. Morey refused to do this for Lowry and that's why Sixers couldn't go further.    - Traded Terrence Ross and a second for Serge Ibaka.     - Drafted Pascal Siakam #27 when few had heard of him.    - Fired Casey and hired a largely unknown Nick Nurse.     Masai is a tier above Morey. He has had elite moves i  trades, drafts and coaching hires. They shouldn't be discussed in the same breath."
"Dallas needs to bring back THJ and offer Norman Powell a max and try to lure him from Portland. Then call the Cavs and try to swap KP for Jarrett Allen. In my opinion, this would be the best option for Dallas. But it's not gonna happen."
"That’s two seasons ago and it gets targeted in the playoffs on mismatches. Teams with bigger guards/wings will always dominate them in the playoffs. Dame drops 50+ and can’t beat a nuggets team without Murray. They struggled against MPJ, Austin Rivers, Gordon, and Campazzo. Jokic is gonna dominate he’s the mvp but their defense is bad and undersized. A 6’4 “small forward” Norman Powell doesn’t help either. That’s why Nurcic was always in foul trouble. Dame, CJ, &amp; Powell are all under 6’5 playing 1-3 letting people get right by them and the bigs have to foul or worry about Jokic. It’s a recipe for continuing mediocrity."
"Yeah. I agree. As a Raps fan, I think this deal is really about potential. This is not all that different from the Norman Powell deal. When we signed Powell, it was 4/42. At the time, some criticized the deal. But Norm developed nicely and helped us win a chip. So hes due a big payday. Hopefully, Trent is at least along that path."
"Are you serious?  GTJ: 6'6 with a 6'8 wingspan, 204 lbs.   Norman Powell: 6'4 with a 6'11 wingspan, 215 lbs.  If anything Norm is better suited to guard forward"
No he can’t. You’re not putting Norman Powell on Lebron even for short stretches. You can with Gary
So can Norman Powell
I would love to bring in Norman Powell but I doubt that happens
"Blazers are really going to sign Norman Powell $20mil AND keep McCollum huh? AND keep Nurkic instead of trying to get a young center who isn't an emotional pussy via trade. THE PLAN HASN'T WORKED AFTER SEVERAL YEARS, BLAZERS FO, SO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT!"
"If Norman Powell leaves Portland, Dame is GONE"
"You can’t sit here and say well among PG I have him as 17th in the whole league and out of the other side of the mouth say he should play next to someone who can be more on the ball in the half court. If you look at just guards there are so many, so many guards you’d rather have. You don’t have Booker on your list? You don’t have Jamal Murray? Donovan Mitchell? Beal? Lavine? Irving? Harden? Brown? McCollum?   Like who did he have a better season than last year? Was he better than terry rozier? Was be better than FVV? Tim Hardaway and Norman Powell are both coming off two very strong seasons in a row, both FA, both 28, was Lonzo better than either of them? Let’s just be honest."
"Miami just picked up his option but still likely Dragic gets moved. Tim Hardaway could be on the move. Evan Fournier could be on the move. Norman Powell is out there coming off 2 really really solid seasons. Patty Mills can shoot the shit out of the ball. Dinwiddie is a name but I think he might end up getting paid.   That’s a few, and I know there’s a couple other names that’ll get much less but still be good for a team."
"For 20M we can sign Norman Powell, Lonzo or DeRozan. All 3 will be big time contributors until our window really opens (my guess is 2023). Dragic on 7-9M would be perfect for the 2nd unit. Dragic for 19M? No, but thank you."
Norman Powell makes an all-star team.
"If he worth 80 mil, Norman Powell is worth 100 mil and Dennis Schroeder worth 60. All over 4 years."
"I would not believe Raptors will just give away their main guy who is 27. But they already traded away Norman Powell for guys who are younger and maybe one day will be as good but for now they just made the team worse, so I guess that's the new plan."
"If Dallas strikes out on all their more likely targets (Lowry, Conley, DeRozan, Ball, Norman Powell, maybe Fournier), there might be some interest from the Mavs."
"Meanwhile Neil Olshey thought it would be a good idea to make 6'3"" Norman Powell a full time 3 next to an already undersized back court"
he tried to say GTJ had a better wingspan and DWS than Norman Powell and was wrong on both accounts lol.
"Neil Olshey is a moron but upgrading from GTJ to Norman Powell who both need new contracts this offseason was very smart, especially if GTJ ends up getting a contract similar to Norm (Norm is the better player in every single facet of the game)."
"Harkless didn't even play SF or start at SF. He was the bench PF behind Aminu... Having him start at SF over Norman Powell wouldn't have changed the outcome. Besides DJJ does everything that Harkless does but better.  Aminu is... ok. That's it He really isn't all that different from Covington, who was also disappointing this season seeing as how we gave up picks for him. Aminu just has zero offense whatsoever. If his trebuchet shot isn't landing (and in his best season it was average at best), then it's 4 on 5 in offense.  Blazers fans have some serious rose colored lenses when it comes to role players. Aminu, Harkless, Turner all of these guys were terrible. Even though this season was a complete failure, it's way better to roll the dice on new players because our old rotation failed 4 years in a row."
I'd rather see Norman Powell play undersized SF than Moe Harkless. And I'd rather see Melo or any of our other forwards over Aminu.
"I don't think even a fully healthy Norman Powell gets near injury replacement for the All Star game.  A ""third to fourth option on a team"" is the All Star team comprised of only 5 teams' players?  If you're the ""third to fourth option on a team"" then you're not an All Star unless you're like Klay Thompson on a dynasty Warriors team or a member of that weird 60-win Hawks team in a wet paper bag Eastern Conference.    And, no, 18-19 ppg (in the 2020s!), when scoring is by far your most valuable contribution, is not fringe All Star worthy.  Like at all.  He's starter quality at SG, sure, and that's fine, but I'd rather have a starter level big wing like Barnes 100 days out of 100."
"I'd rather have Harrison Barnes, primarily due to his size.  Powell should be defending shooting guards, while Barnes can guard wings.  That's just inherently more valuable.  And calling Norman Powell a fringe all-star quality player is really stretching the definition of fringe all-star quality player to levels not seen even in the early 2000s east."
"I'm not the GM making the trade, so I don't know what criteria Monte McNair would use to quantify this. So I'll caveman attempt a response:  Norman Powell  He'd be a direct upgrade at the small forward position that could be attained at that cost and for the past two seasons has been an under-the-radar fringe all-star quality player when healthy."
"I honestly wouldn't worry too much about the 30m ask. 3 years is relatively short plus expirings always have value so it's really just year 2 (fwiw I don't think there'd be a severe decline in play in year 2, his game is way more IQ based than anything else) and injuries that are the worries.  Beyond that, when you look at the going rate for contracts, it's pretty worth it when you consider a Kyle Kuzma getting 13m or Norman Powell/Gary Trent looking for the 18-25 range.  With Lowry you get a ton of desirable skills in a player (shooting, defending, playmaking) as well as a guy who's shown he can carry any random collection of bench guys to great advanced stats and a vocal leader on offense and defense who brings a ton of intangibles."
"Now, I know this is nonsense, but it *could* work for Philly. They dump Simmons for free to Toronto and out of a sudden they have a max slot available. They could pay, let's say, Lonzo and Norman Powell without any complains. Lonzo/Seth/Powell/Tobias/Embiid would be a surefire lockdown starting 5."
Norman Powell
Thats Norman Powell
Norman Powell has a ring
How about Norman Powell?
"Lets look at the stats of Damian Lillard and his teammates  Dame: 55/6/10 on 17/24 shooting 12/17 from 3, led the team in blocks and just 1 TO  CJ: 18/7/7 on 7/22 shooting 2/8 from 3 and fouled out  Nurk: 13/11 with 5/12 shooting, 6 turnovers as a big man, and fouled out. Only played 24 minutes due to foul trouble  Norman Powell: 13/0/3 on 5/14 shooting and 0/3 from 3  Melo: 8/4/3 on 3/11 shooting 2/9 from 3  Roco played well 19/11 on 5/10 shooting but he played only 43 minutes and fouled out too  Meanwhile every since Nugget except Facu and Millsap shot atleast 40% and MPJ went 26/12 on 10/13 shooting"
Norman Powell
"1.	Kawhi 2.	Pascal 3.	KLow 4.	Danny Green 5.	Serge/Fred based on matchup 6.	Marc Gasol 7.	Norman Powell 8.	Rest of bench  OG would’ve had great rotational minutes in there too, crazy that we were quietly one of the deepest teams in NBA history"
Norman Powell could do it
Norman Powell is on the trailblazers
"Sixers don't trade Ben simmons, but instead move Tobias Harris for CJ MCCollum, and make McCollum the starting PG and move Ben to PF and treat him like a point forward.   McCollum fits way better with Embiid and Simmons (compared to harris), and this is the team's final hurrah in making the Simmons/Embiid pairing work.   Creates a big question mark at SG for the sixers, as they can't responsibly start mccollum and curry together as the backcourt, but i could see this being the move and gives them a point guard that can shoot the 3 ball, spread the floor, and create for others.  For, the blazers, it gives Dame a skilled forward to work with (harris excels at scoring in the paint - where the sixers already have embiid and simmons who both score in the paint), allows them to pay Norman Powell and slot him in at SG. Harris is also a pretty solid rebounder.   Harris/McCollum are both fringe all stars that are similarly overpaid and a swap could benefit sixers and blazers (potentially).     The real hot take here is that the sixers don't trade simmons, but this is the rationale around it."
Their best iso defender in their starting lineup is Norman Powell. And he’s 6’4 playing their SF 😂
Oh it wasn’t? Thought it was short for Norman Powell
1.get new coach  2. check out norman powell  3. introduce new alternate jersey  4. win championship
Norman Powell to Knicks is a great move.  Blazers losing Gary Trent JR AND Powell for nothing is gonna be crazy.  People say they need to go all in to convince Lillard to stay but they already kinda did  Traded two firsts for Covington   Then traded their best young player for Powell.  They NEED to retain him
Only way Portland can compete is if they can fleece a trade or hit a out of the park home run in the draft.   Blazers are already over the cap and that’s without Norman Powell.   And no one is taking a massive pay cut to play I. Portland
Sign Norman Powell
I read that as Norman Powell lol
"And we would hopefully re-sign Norman Powell in this situation who is an excellent 3 point shooter. RoCo is an underrated 3 point shooter, so we'd got shooting on the perimeter. My worry would be the bench, because the 6ers could ask for Simons who is an excellent 3 point shooter too"
Norman Powell.
"Hell no. Westbrook is terrible for them. They need shooters and there's no way Westbrook is helping him in the halfcourt when he provides no spacing and will take way too many shots. CP3 way better for them, but I'd still like to see them go for a Norman Powell kinda guy (would require a lot of work)"
"Other guys stepped up though  Bobby Portis, KCP had some good games in the Finals, Norman Powell stepped up for the Raps"
I feel like they have one player to retain that’s slightly more important than Norman Powell.
"Their story is hella amazing. Rivalries aside, you absolutely cannot hate this team. Organic chips are just so much better than other chips. As the Great Norman Powell says *Understand the Grind.*"
Translation: “I haven’t watched a single minute of Norman Powell”  He’s been insanely consistent for the last two seasons.
"Just curious about your opinion and if it is based on something that might be an outliar that most are not aware of? Raptor fans have watched him grow from a quiet individual, into a drunken loveable guy. His [Player's Tribune](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/contributors/norman-powell) was good enough to tell me that he's not socially inept."
THJ or Norman Powell? They seem to be the closest related contracts. 20-25mil for 4 years
Wait why do people value Norman powell over cj? I mean isn’t powell just a worse cj
"I know this post is a few days old but when I say build around Dame what I mean is stuff like:  A) Wasting time and money on old bums like Carmelo Anthony to ""win now"" instead of developing.. anyone else.  B) Signing CJ to a long, big contract extension shortly after Damian Lillard signed his supermax.  This one is very damaging.  This extension is just now kicking in, despite being signed shortly after Dame signed his supermax.  If Dame forces his way out this summer, they will be left with CJ's extension kicking in and they'll have to find a way to unload him now, possibly giving up assets just to do it because moving contracts like that isn't easy, despite him being a good player.  So not only will it be work to get rid of him they were also robbed of actually getting assets for him a year or so ago.  C) In a ""win now"" move, traded 22 year old rookie contract Gary Trent Jr for Norman Powell who just opted out and is now a FA.  What happens if Dame leaves?  Worst case they just RIP'd an asset, best they sign Norman to a big new deal and try to move him in the future.   We could rattle off examples for days, like how they don't have a 2021 draft pick because they traded it for Robert Covington.  So to respond to your initial statement, which offers a valid point but imo comes to the wrong conclusion.  They indeed did build around Dame, they just didn't do it very well.  It's also worth noting, given CJ's extension following shortly after Dame's that Dame himself very well may have been a vocal factor in this move.  As he was in wasting time on washed up Melo.  It's not something we haven't seen before, if franchises completely give in and essentially make their star the GM of the team it can backfire in the future (ie lebron with cleveland, and I see you with that lakers icon, if they aren't careful them too).  At least with LeBron he might leave your franchise desolate but you get a ring out of it so can't complain too much."
"Depends on the money too right, this is likely going to be the biggest contract Norman Powell ever gets unless he somehow turns into an all star at this age.   If Portland is only willing to throw 15-20 at him, with a three year deal And another team will give him 4 years and like 17-22 it’s a legit consideration"
Norman powell
goodbye norman powell n lowry. just tank for the season
"Norman Powell (44.3%) and Chris Boucher (44.1%) on 9.9 combined 3PA per game, tampa splash bros"
Hopefully norman powell and a first
I really hope Toronto give Norman Powell 20m a year.
I want Norman Powell &amp; Lonzo but we'll probably have to wait until the off-season
"He’s averaging 23/4/2 on 54/47/90 with a 68TS% in 24 games this season as a starter. Norman Powell, what a fucking scrub amirite"
Raptors fans saying that Norman Powell and him were the same
&gt;It’s relevant when you’re playing alongside Embiid and he regularly misses games. Over the last 21 games that Tobias has played without Embiid he is averaging 23 PPG and the Sixers are 11-10 in those games. Simmons also didn’t play in 6 of those games.  Yeah...and Norm has put up virtually the exact same numbers over a similar timespan as a starter. [Here’s a source for you](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/norman-powell-stats-as-a-starter-2021). In 24 games as a starter he’s averaging 22.6 ppg on 53/46.5/90.5 shooting splits. Surely if Tobias was as good a scorer as you’re saying it would translate to some sort of tangible difference in production?  &gt;That is why the ability to create his own shot makes him more valuable then Powel as a scorer. Then factor in rebounding and defense as well.  You can factor in rebounding but there isn’t really evidence of Tobias being a better defender than Norm.
Tobias Harris beats Norman Powell in just about every advanced stats category.  Tobias Harris:   2.3 OWS 1.5 DWS 3.8 WS 2.7 OBPM 0.1 DBPM 2.9 BPM 7.5 NETRTG  Norman Powell:  2.0 OWS 0.7 DWS 2.7 WS 1.5 OBPM -0.5 DBPM 1.0 BPM 2.4 NETRTG

"0/0/0 Tony Snell hitting the game winner to send Toronto into fire sale mood thus netting the Bucks the final piece to a legit Championship run in Norman Powell, who should of been a Buck in the 1st place would be the sweetest kind of symmetry."
"That's I'm fcking talking about, ice trae with the perfect pass to snell for the game winner 🤩   Norman Powell is a scary, scary man. Natural born bucket getter hes fun to watch even as an opposing fan."
"It's a business. We are a playoff team, and will remain a playoff team. Kyle Lowry is on our team, and him leaving weakens us.  We will play the Sixers at some point, and we'd rather do that without Lowry against us. For this, Sixers gotta pay a premium.  Furthermore, we need a C. Without that hole being fixed there's little use in tying up money just to make Sixer fans happy.  Highly doubt we tie up a good chunk of our free cap space without even fixing the one glaring hole on the roster we have.     We aren't moving on from Norman Powell and Terence Davis for Maxey lol"
"Terence Davis thinks he's Norman Powell, but he's actually Terence Davis."
So Norman Powell is an elite shooter? That’s basically what you’re saying because he’s ahead of Trae in 3 pointers made too
"To remind everyone of his Lakers drafting wins when rebuilding:  2016: Brandon Ingram (2) + Ivica Zubac (32)  2015: D'Angelo Russell (2) + Larry Nance Jr. (27)  2014: Julius Randle (7) + Jordan Clarkson (46)  Obviously, top picks should yield good/great players, pending development, but he drafted three (currently one-time) all-stars, avoiding relative busts like Jahlil Okafor (2015), the minefield known as the 2016 draft (lottery had great players like Simmons/Ingram/Brown/Murray/Sabonis mixed in with picks ranging from pedestrian to disastrous like Bender/Chriss/Maker/Papagiannis), and picked the best available player in the 2014 draft after Wiggins/Embiid came off the board. Obviously, LaVine and Jokic were picked later in the 2014 draft, but Jokic was passed on 40 times for a reason.  And his late first- &amp; second-round selections were stellar, relatively speaking. Clarkson was by far the best remaining player at the 46th pick, with the only notable players picked near him being Dwight Powell (45), Jokic (41), Jerami Grant (39), and Dinwiddie (38). The end of the 2015 NBA draft was a stash/reach fest, with only 7 of the last 22 picks seeing even one NBA game (including Norman Powell at 46). Outside of Montrezl Harrell and Powell, the 2015 draft was really bad after the lottery (and not even that good in the lottery). 2015 may be one of the worst draft years ever. In 2016, the really only quality player picked after Zubac was Brogdon at 36, who was really unfairly maligned for being a 4-year college player and for being a relatively unathletic point guard."
His face looks like a mashup of Oladipo and Norman Powell.
You’re absolutely spot on. Middleton is being paid like a superstar and he ain’t even that much better than Norman Powell.
But you could have 30 games of Norman Powell!
Is it blasphemous to say Norman Powell or even Schroeder might be a more sought after FA
Norman Powell anyone?
"Yeah youre right, I must just never watch my own team play, good point, you guys have totally figured it out. I'm sure Norman Powell will shoot 80% for the rest of the series while the Nuggets collectively shoot 40%, this game was clearly the new normal and not a statistical anomaly."
Man not even asking about a superstar he asking about mfing Norman Powell 💀
"Come out of nowhere to carry you to a series win? The Norman special. He'll go 4-8 in the next game, but that's just how it goes. Playoff Powell always lurking."

May 29th 2021 will be known in the NBA world as the “Norman Powell Game”
Norman Powell wtf ? This dude is getting PAID this year. Can Blazers even afford him ?

You guys ever notice that Norman Powell is bow-legged?
Norman Powell being the guy the Blazers were hoping for this game

Norman Powell game
God I love when Norman Powell is hot
"That might get them to finals, but they would still need to add Norman Powell and Danny Green to win it all."
"His lack of adjustments usually are the thing we have a problem with.  Many times, he sticks with the ""usual"" and doesn't try new things when that's clearly not working or a bad fit.  For instance, playing Enes Kanter minutes when Jokic is on the floor, or keeping Jones Jr, RHJ and Nassir Little glued to the bench when they'd do better at defending Denver's squad than undersized Norman Powell or CJ.   Especially if we're just going to be hero ball on offense where one player basically isos all game, whether it's dame, cj, melo, whoever - it won't matter whether some of these dudes can space the floor or not, if we won't pass to them anyway."
"he went to Toronto with Gary Trent JR for Norman Powell, but didn't log many minutes with them"
Norman Powell and RoCo were atrocious in this game in every aspect. So many lazy and mental mistakes
Why has Norman Powell always been severely underrated?
Norman Powell has been shit since the trade
"Stop letting Bjelitza (that’s my best attempt) gain confidence. I still have PTSD from when we routed Toronto in game 3 in 2017, but it gave birth to Norman Powell being insane against us."
Norman Powell is a big upgrade over Gary Trent Jr but we don’t give him enough touches imo.    If we let him be more of a secondary ball handler like he could be then I think we would be seeing his name more in this thread
"You'd hope so. I don't know how they came into this game two, after looking so ready in game one, with such a lack of give a fuck.   Frankly, if we got moderate production from ANYONE outside of Dame this game would have been competitive. But Norman Powell is playing like trash, CJ kept coughing up the ball, Nurk was taken out of the game mentally by the refs long before he was physically taken out by the refs. The list goes on.   Just an all around dogshit performance for everyone not named Damian Lillard."
Norman Powell is an all nba buck killer
Norman Powell just shaking his head dismissively at this heat team
Norman powell
"Norman Powell also had two thunderous highlight dunks. He must have been the second best player on the floor tonight. You know, because the highlights."
They tried adding Roco and Norman powell. Portland bigs are offensive bigs and slow at defense. And you have CJ and dame who are offensive juggernauts but liability on defense as well. So it’s really hard.
But why does Norman Powell look like a smaller version of Andre Drummond?
"You should be able to kind of hide them though with guys like Roco and Nurkic, and don’t get me wrong the front office is to blame too. There’s not nearly enough defensive minded role players on this team. A guy like Gary Harris would have been a better fit for this team than Norman Powell imo"
Norman Powell loving his tenure with the Blazers
Blazer fans thought Norman Powell was the one huh. Raptors fooled yall
Norman Powell sipping on dog water right now
Some highlights: 1. Covington's 0/0/2 stat line. 2. Norman Powell -23 in 16 minutes. 3. 37 fouls in 34 minutes.
norman powell is trash
Norman Powell with -22 sums up his time in Portland tbh
"woooo, let’s go Norman Powell and CJ McCollum. they coming in clutch for us rn"
"I've been flipping through all the NHL/NBA tonight. That being said, how did Norman Powell get to a +/- of -22 in 9:17 on the court?   I'm just curious how that went down."
Blazers because of Dame and former Raptor Norman Powell. Mavs as well because they're so fun to watch
"I would have still preferred AG over Norman Powell for his size and defense,  but having Dame CJ and Norm playing together is indeed very potent offensively, and what Portland used to close out the season strong.   We can just about get away with it on the defensive side with Nurkic in the middle and Powell being a surprising scrappy defender for his size backed up by RoCo.   Alternatively Nurk surrounded by Dame, CJ, and Norm on the perimeter, then you can add Melo for max offense,  which would mean all 4 players on the perimeter can both shoot 3s AND create their own shot in iso."
"Norman Powell with championship experience leading the way, showing Melo Dame Cj how to get it done!"
"Man if Simons keeps up his confidence in shooting the ball, the 4 guard lineup of Lillard/CJ/Simons/Norman Powell is going to be a HANDFUL to defend.  Simons actually has a really quick first step too, perhaps even faster than Dame, along with huge hops as we saw in the slam dunk contest. He just isn't experienced or strong enough to take it to the paint. If he ever figures that part of his game out he would be an absolute explosive weapon on offense."
"Am I the only one that feels like the Blazers may be seriously underrated? I know they have had defensive issues, but Dame is a top 8 player in the world and the most clutch player in the NBA, CJ McCollum is a top 30 player, RoCo is one of the best team defender 3 and D guys around, and Nurk will forever be underrated. Plus Simons hitting 3s, Norman Powell being efficient as a scorer and Carmelo creating shots and roasting bench players. Plus a ton of playoff experience and solid coaching. I really like this team...."
Norman Powell is not better.
"I can imagine the conversations:  Lillard: What does it take to win a championship, Norman?  Powell: Just your opponent's two best players suffering year-ending  injuries. You only had one. &lt;taps head&gt;"
"Norman Powell with championship experience presence, he finna show Dame and CJ how it’s done 😤😤"
"That Raptors team had Kawhi added to a quad consistenting of: elite defenders from 1-5 on the starting lineup, a bench of Serge Ibaka, Fred Van Vleet, OG Anunoby and Norman Powell, and a great coach in Nurse.  Kawhi iso was how the Raps broke through and got points against good defensive schemes but otherwise Kawhi was easily plugged into an offence Lowry and FVV were extremely comfortable already running, on top of Siakam making a huge leap that year and presenting as a viable 2nd option on offence. Kawhi didn’t have to elevate anything like LeBron or Luka would, he was a finishing touch to get an extremely competitive team over the hump.  Tbh hypothetically you could plug a lot of superstars into that roster and expect similar results, but Kawhi being the 2-way monster he is was a big part of shutting Milwaukee down, always fun to wonder how that series would go if it was someone like KD tasked with matching Giannis at halfcourt and corralling him into Gasol/Siakam down low.  That said idk if there’s a diminished return to adding Luka/Harden’s playmaking to that roster vs someone you could give the ball to anytime you needed points + could defend the opposing best player. Kawhi could very possibly have been the exact fit the Raps needed in that situation, besides LBJ who can be trusted to do everything lol"
who do raptors fans cheer for. norman powell or murray's team
He was part of the Norman Powell trade
"At the risk of sounding biased, I agree with the assessment of the Blazers. They are much better than their seeding indicates. We added norm Powell at the deadline, and we got Nurk and CJ back from injury. Melo has finally settled into his 6th man role, he is way less likely to take stupid shots than when we had less firepower. The “eye test” tells me that this team is at least as good as the team that when to the Western Conference Finals a couple years ago, and probably better. We have a healthy Nurk and Stormin’ Norman!"
1. Demar Derozan 2. Pascal Siakam 3. Kyle Lowry 4. Kawhi Leonard 5. Steve Nash 6. Jamal Murray 7. RJ Barrett  8. Jeremy Lin 9. Norman Powell  10. Jayson Tatum
"Hot take: I think Neil purposefully signed Hood to his contract knowing we could use him as cap filler in a trade. It's a 2 year contract with a team option after year 1, basically if Hood played well we'd have a cheap player for 2 years, if he played bad he's essentially 10 mil in cap space this offseason for any team interested. The fact we used his contract to facilitate the Norman Powell trade just proves that it worked."
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
"It's not a great FA class coming up though. Maybe throw a bag at Spencer Dinwiddie and another at Norman Powell?  Spurs don't generally attract big name free agents, I think LMA was an exception, so it might be worthwhile overpaying to get competitive while maintaining long-term flexibility."
"Isn’t PPP purely an iso stat though with how it’s tracked? This year’s PPP leaders were Austin Rivers, Norman Powell, and De’Anthony Melton. Or are you talking about like adjusted points/100? Because that doesn’t even really account for efficiency in the way you’re thinking it does. You can have a higher adjusted points/100 and a lower ORTG at the same time depending on your actual shooting percentages."
"&gt; ""I think Norman Powell is gonna get 20-plus easily,"" said the personnel evaluator. ""He's just a guy that can play with anybody. He doesn't need the ball in his hands to be effective. He's a good defender, he's a great athlete, he gets to the rim. You can play him at the 3, you can play him at the 2. He's a great character guy.""   [x] The city of Toronto liked this."
"wow yeah, i wonder if there's a section of the article with the header ""Norman Powell"" discussing Norman Powell. that would be crazy, man!"
"And to really drive the point home, here is a picture of Norman Powell"
"Well, that's were Nurk and Norman Powell come in, I guess."
"Someone is paying attention. There was also the dislocated finger on Anthony Davis' heel bone. This is probably the first post season where every critical player is healthy and the team has consistent, reliable role players who can also shoot the three. The team hasn't even been bad defensively over the last twelve games, and has the highest ranked offense heading into the post season as well. Norman Powell has been an excellent scoring and defensive option and strangely, Melo has career percentages this season, on less volume obviously, but he's not hurting the team. Nurkic just makes all of those pieces better, and Kanter is so damn good at offensive rebounding it hurts. The team is not perfect by any means, butby comparison to previous seasons in the Dame era, this team is rounding into form at just the right time, and is clearly more talented overall."

"This Norman Powell steal and dunk against Indy in the playoffs. It doesn’t look as great in the replay but the timing of it, the intensity of the game, and the ferocity of the dunk was amazing.   https://youtu.be/uao0ZZ8r52s"
"To be fair to Dame though, he only played 2 out of the 3 games versus LAC this year for one, and they were blitzing and trapping him from the start of both games. The clippers have good length for traps on a smaller player like Dame.  To compensate for the traps in those games, CJ and Norman Powell both went off but that's what you can concede when you decide to trap Dame.  I don't think the reg season matchups fully represent what the Blazers can do, especially once the coaching staff has some time to make some adjustments to beat the traps."
Norman Powell isn't on the team anymore and Lowry is likely walking this offseason. Siakam played 56 games this season. Only 21 of those were wins
"I was watching the Lebron buzzer beater game the other day and it is remarkable how many good players the Raptors had that year. Derozan, Lowry, Valanciunas, Ibaka, and a young OG anunoby was a very good starting 5 if that’s what they would choose to run. They also had (albeit before any of their primes) Fred Van Vleet, Norman Powell, Pascal Siakam, and Jakob Poeltl. One of the deepest rosters I’ve seen, set for the present and the future."
"What's the best draft class currently in the NBA? 2003 always good until Lebron retires - ridiculous (Melo not doing anything noteworthy anymore).  Only Howard left from 2004 and CP3 from 2005.   2006 - Reddick, Rondo, LMA, Lowry, Gay  2007 - Durant, Horford, Conley, Thad Young, Gasol  2008 - Rose, Westbrook, Love, Lopezes, Dragic, Batum, Hill, Ibaka (starting to see more players around, only going to list stars and very good starters now)  2009 - Harden, Curry, Derozan,  JRue, Danny Green, Mills  2010 - Hayward, PG (rest are low level starts, pretty weak draft)  2011- Kyrie, Tobias, Marcus Morris, Kawhi, Vuvecic, Corey Joseph, Jimmy Buckets,   2012 - AD, Beal, Lillard, Barnes, Terrence Ross, (does Drummond count as a good starter?), Fournier, Middleton, Barton  2013 - Oladipo, KCP, McCollum, Adams, Giannis, Schroeder, Hardaway  2014 - See OP  2015 - KAT, DLo, Turner, Oubre, Booker, Rozier, Norman Powell  2016 - Simmons, Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Murray, Hield, Sabonis, Beasley, Levert, Siakam, Brogdon, (Surprisingly strong year)  All the rest are too early to judge.  Talent is really spread out by age right now.  I'd say 2009 or 2012 or 2014 are the best left maybe?  Hard to judge  2003 still going to get that title though, haha."
"Trade Bledsoe or relegate him to playing off the bench.   Sign one of Duncan Robinson, Furkan Korkmaz.   S&amp;T Zo to Toronto for Gary Trent Jr or to Portland for Norman Powell.   Or re-sign Zo for no more than $15mil/year.   Re-sign Hart, Uncle JJ and guarantee Wenyen Gabriel’s contract for next year.   Cap space is a conspiracy theory.   Lock Zion and BI in a gym with Kevin Garnett and Gary Payton."
Never realized until now how similar Norman Powell and Andre Drummond look.
Hopefully he helps replace the scoring of Norman Powell who replaced the scoring of Terrance Ross
"Norman powell gets tapped and his head flies back its crazy lol. I would get dizzy doing that, hats off to em"
If he goes to the Celtics I'll start saying that Norman Powell is better than Jayson Tatum
