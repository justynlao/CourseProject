How has Josh Jackson been?
"In the Josh Jackson/Kyrie trade, sure.  The proposed one this thread? We wouldn't even pick up the phone."
&gt;I didn't want Kyrie for Josh Jackson  Nets hang up first though lol
"I didn't want Kyrie for Josh Jackson, and I certainly don't want him for CP3 and Ayton."
Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if the Suns drafted this guy instead of Josh Jackson..

"No matter how bad a team is, they will get at least 90 points and 40 rebounds a game. Somebody has to get those points. Josh Jackson post all star break his rookie year the Suns were basically tanking and played him a lot and was putting up almost 19/6/2.5."
Well there is 5 starters and 5*30 is 150 which leaves 100 then you get your good bench players out of the way (a lot of these guys being mentioned are in my 175-200 range which is above average considering the whole league)then the next tier will get you to most average.  I’ll mention some other guys I have in the same range  Josh Jackson Langston Galloway Troy Brown Jr Grayson Allen Cole Anthony Jordan McLaughlin Onyeka Okongwu Naz Reid Brad Wanamaker  Prob take Cole and Onyeka our due to potential but any of those other guys could make a case
"In the past year the owner has stepped back from meddling and actually allowed the new GM (Troy Weaver who was an assistant GM with the Thunder) do an actual full rebuild. The Gores meddling is part of the reason the team had been so bad. He had a playoffs or bust mentality and forced a lot of the bad moves the team made without taking the blame.   Gores told Dumars he had to get stars when he first arrived which led to us signing Josh Smith (because realistically what legit star is coming to Detroit in free agency) and forced the Brandon Knight Kris Middleton for Brandon Jennings trade (Dumars was very high on Middleton and thought he had the chance to be good but playoffs and win now takes precedent right). After he fired Dumars instead of hiring a coach and GM that might develop a young core (Drummond, Dinwiddie, and KCP all looked promising at the time) he hired Stan Van Gundie to be the Coach/GM and told him we where a win now team.   Obviously a lot of stuff happened over the Van Gundy years but I think the most obvious ways Gores win now directive hurt us where the Stanley Johnson pick, Blake Griffin trade, and Luke Kennard pick. Long story short Johnson was picked over better players because he played NBA level defense and was considered the best option to help the team immediately (tbf he looked decent in that playoff series his 1st year). Kennard was picked over Donovan Mitchell because Kennard shot well and would help the team immediately. Where as Mitchell was seen by the franchise as someone that would take sometime to develop. While Blake Griffin was traded for because Gores told Van Gundy playoffs or bust and he was trying to save his job. Gores meddling has hurt the team for years and was a major reason we couldn't rebuild.  Recently though Gores has stepped back and has allowed to Troy Weaver to start a full rebuild which is refreshing to see. Also Weaver got Sadiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart in his 1st draft who both look to be good. Hayes looks bad right now but he was supposed to be project so I'm not worried yet. Last year the Pistons got Doumbouya who has potential. Also n free agency Weaver signed Josh Jackson who was showing flashes of a breakout with us before his injury. As well as Jerami Grant who is showing that he can be a legitimately great player. This is honestly the most excited I've been about the Pistons in years.  Also the Pistons are managing to tank while being super competitive in the games they've played. They had 3 bad losses to Milwaukee but other than that everyone game has come down to the wire. I know Pistons fans keep saying this but they're not nearly as bad as their record indicates and looking at net ratings shows that [bbref](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_ratings.html). They're 17th in the leauge in adjusted Net Rating and they're 22nd if you use [NBA.com's](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=-1) unadjusted Net rating. Basically we get to watch competitive basketball while the team is tanking and I'm really happy about that. I also like the moves Weaver has made and think he is a good GM. So I'm happy about the future."
Josh Jackson is also under Casey now who's an extremely good development coach.
Did Josh Jackson roll a car with guns and weed in it?
Hopefully he turns out similar to how Josh Jackson turned out when he was in Memphis. He seems to be doing much better in Detroit
josh jackson
Josh Jackson may be one of the worst NBA players I've seen
"Great game for Sexton, he was lights out. Also, not that it's relevant but I never really processed that the Pistons can almost run a lineup of just top 5 picks when healthy between Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin, Josh Jackson, and Jahlil Okafor."
"Reddish is a really interesting case. His potential is through the roof, and he shows just enough glimpses of the player that people hoped he would become to keep them invested in his development. He's young, and there's no reason that he shouldn't get better with time, but right now his production is so mediocre that it's hard to believe that he was ever considered a lock to go in the top 3.  He's a guy who could legitimately either develop into a two-way star, or could be struggling to stick as a deep bench player by his second contract. It's rare to see players with that range of *realistic* possibility. Kind of like Josh Jackson without the attitude issues."
josh jackson looks a lot better than I remember
I remember there being reports that they wanted Josh Jackson and Eric Bledsoe from the Suns and got turned down. And thank god they turned us down.
His fan base used his improved splits post all star break as reason for optimism and ignored how bad he was before that. In this case the latter part of his rookie year ended up being predictive many times it isnt people did stuff like this with Josh Jackson and many others also. Fans are the ones who are grading rookies on curves
"I'm specifically talking about trading up to draft Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman, all players who were undervalued draft day but have turned into instant contributers. Esp Clarke who was All-Rookie and Bane who is shooting 45+% from 3 on 4 attempts per game when Grizz needed a shooter   As well as smart trade acquisitions such as getting De'Anthony Melton (6th man and analytics darling last year) and Josh Jackson in a salary dump from Suns and getting Igudola from Warriors then flipping him for Justise Winslow. And their trade for Mike Conley resulted in Grayson Allen, Jae Crowder (also flipped for Winslow) and two 1sts, one of whom tuned into Clarke.  People really don't understand how much work this FO has done to remake the roster into smart young players that all fit together. Yes they got very lucky with Ja and JJJ but to get to this point only 3 years removed from Grit n Grind playoff teams is incredible."
lamar jackson is also MVP he must be better than josh allen and deshaun watson
"Yeah but if you undo the trade we get the following- 3rd pick in the 2017 NBA draft (Lonzo or Josh Jackson) and the 14th pick in the 2019 draft. Not actually that impressive.  I guess I’d rather have Lonzo over Roco, but it’s pretty close. I made my decision on the actual assets that would be on the team, not how it would have changed the team’s decision making."
"Nice you got a Josh Jackson, enjoy they’re always fun to have"
"What a weird draft class that was  1. Fultz   2. Ball  3. Tatum  4. Josh Jackson  Hilariously it's looking like Fultz is the second best player out of the top4, which is wild considering he just forgot how to play basketball for 2 years."
"If soccer-style youth teams replaced the draft it would be good imho.  Pro-teams would invest in young players from a younger age, we'd have a more skilled league.  Example:  Josh Jackson was never taught how to shoot by Kansas because they knew he was a one-and-done."
So did josh Jackson. I think ainge wanted him and he chose not to work out with us.
Tatum was being mocked 4th. Fultz and Lonzo were obviously top 2 but people really thought Josh Jackson would be Boston pick until he spurred them and wouldn't workout for them. Tatum kind of came as a surprise to everyone except Boston.
Yea true. Draft is a crap shoot. In an alternate world we end up with Josh Jackson + Langford which is worse than whatever Fultz turned out to be
That’s a statline that would make Josh Jackson blush.
"&gt;They are the exception not the rule  Hitting on a ""one and done"" is basically an exception if you aren't in the Top 5. There are sooo many flops.  You're basically playing a lottery with one and done players. Yea they could be great. They could also be average. But the greatest chance is them being flops.  With an older guy, you're much more likely to get something out of him. You'll at least know what you're getting. On the opposite side, you have players like Josh Jackson."
Josh Jackson with that -27 +-
Hope he can get his career back on track and go the Josh Jackson route.  Kids so talented
"Fuck it  Kyrie Harden KD DeAndre Whiteside  With a bench of Dion Waiters, Kevin porter jr, Josh Jackson, and cousins. Ty Lue as coach."
"Look at whats happening to Josh Jackson right now in Detroit. Had issues for a while and many suspected he was done. Hes now in Detroit and revitalizing his career. I think their is hope for KPJ, but its really up to him"
Pistons took Josh Jackson and he even looks fairly decent
"&gt; Seems like it worked for Josh Jackson  did it really though?  He was a backup on one of the worst teams in the league in Phoenix, and is still a backup on one of the worst teams in the league but now he's in Detroit.  What changed?"
"idk about trading for him, but as a Grizzlies fan, I wouldn't mind if they picked him up, stuck him in the G-League and tried to help him fix his mentality. Seems like it worked for Josh Jackson."
Get him on the Josh Jackson plan. Seemed to work for him
Josh Jackson 2.0?
"Josh Jackson. Wanted the sixers to take him at 3 in 2017. Still holding out hope, but it hasn't been pretty"
"Melton is to some extent similar, although we didn’t draft him, when we traded for Josh Jackson, rumor was he was the guy we were really after"
"Idk if it’ll get me killed currently but a while back, when we first drafted Zo, I was talking about how Zo wasn’t really that good and everyone “fell for the hype” so to say to get him drafted #2 and that we should’ve kept dlo and drafted one of 1) Tatum 2) Mitchell 3) josh jackson based on college games that I had watched and got tore apart for it.   Obviously I was wrong about Jackson, but looking back it now, it’s funny how I was right about 2/3 of the picks and years later, Zo still isn’t better than Dlo"
Is Josh Allen a racist white dude because he destroyed Lamar Jackson in a football game?
my own take of saying the Pistons will be the 6th seed in the east just because I irrationally like Josh Jackson
Dude somehow named Plumlee but not D rose  Josh Jackson?
"Zion already proved that he is not a bust. Yes, he has played only 35 games or so, but he has shown a lot of talent and potential.  On the other hand, I think that if a player hasn’t progressed a bit by his 4th year, we can start to consider him as a bust. Like a lot of people has started to call Lonzo a bust since the start of this season.  Josh Jackson looks like a bust. Fultz has just been unlucky, idk if we should include him in that category.  Marvin Bagley is seemingly approaching that road as well, but it’s still early to tell.  So I think a player has got 3 years to prove he’s not a bust."

imagine drafting josh Jackson over this dude lmaoooo
"for boston in 2017, they were fairly certain because fultz and ball were largely considered the top 2 prospects, and tatum was considered more like 5th. even hipsters would typically pick someone like josh jackson at 2 before tatum. someone else already mentioned nuggets missing og, and i don’t think there are any other big examples"
"Even with the trajectory Josh Jackson took with us, I have no regrets about this."
Cleveland wanted Josh Jackson but the Suns said no
"You're just making things up.  &gt;The Cleveland Cavaliers reportedly were in talks to trade Kyrie Irving to the Phoenix Suns in a three-team deal in June, according to Jackie MacMullan of ESPN:  &gt;""In mid-June, shortly before [former general manager David] Griffin left, team and league sources confirm, the Cavs explored a three-way deal with Phoenix and Indiana that would have shipped Irving and [Channing] Frye to the Suns and brought Eric Bledsoe and Paul George to Cleveland. The Suns resisted, unwilling to part with their No. 4 pick, which they planned to use to draft Josh Jackson.""  &gt;**That trade came a month before Irving requested one out of Cleveland**  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2752210-report-kyrie-irving-trade-for-paul-george-eric-bledsoe-was-explored-by-cavs  The whole reason Kyrie requested a trade in the first place is because he was included in trade talks."
I see the Pistons fans replying to you have reached the “rooting for Josh Jackson” stage of denial. That’s fun.
"He build the roster so young players (all 3 first round picks from this draft) as well as gambles like Josh Jackson is getting big minutes, while setting us up for the 2021 and 2022 draft. At the same time we almost never get blown out, so our rookies don't have to endure losing by 30 every game and can learn from competitive games.  I like the strategy. We want to be bad, Pistons fans have asked for this for a long time.  Also the way Grant is playing right now, 20 million per year is a straight up steal. Like legit one of the best deals in the league. You don't get an efficient 24 ppg with good defense for less than 38 million usually these days. I hope he can keep it up."
"Lol at you   https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/21941260/nba-playing-lebron-winning-nba-title-kyrie-irving-decided-move-question-why  In mid-June, shortly before Griffin left, team and league sources confirm, the Cavs explored a three-way deal with Phoenix and Indiana that would have shipped Irving and [Channing] Frye to the Suns and brought Eric Bledsoe and Paul George to Cleveland. The Suns resisted, unwilling to part with their No. 4 pick, which they planned to use to draft Josh Jackson. No formal offer was made by any of the teams, but news of this potential transaction stung Irving, who, sources close to him say, became convinced that LeBron's camp, which also represents Bledsoe, orchestrated the trade talks.      Team and league sources refute that, saying that it was Griffin who initiated the trade talks with Phoenix. Griffin, who is close with Irving, sensed both his unhappiness and his restlessness and was preparing for the possibility that Irving would request a trade. But once Griffin was no longer employed by the team, the conversations stalled. Cleveland then engaged in talks with Indiana and Denver, according to league sources."
"You forgot about Mason Plumlee, Josh Jackson and Delon Wright in Detroit."
Got 3 rookies and signed Josh Jackson for cheap who look decent  Also grant seems like a good player and maybe is a steal despite what was said before the season. Also weaver has us in place to be a bottom team which is what we needed for a while
"We’ve got rookies that look good (Hayes was gonna be raw we knew that but hopefully he’ll look good when he’s healthy), our team is hella young outside of a few guys, some nice signings in Grant and josh Jackson that have been playing amazing, Plumlee is a great veteran signing to take minutes off our young guys, and we’re staying pretty competitive in games  We were one of the worst teams in the league last year too this isn’t much different, but now we’ve got some young guys with promise. It’s not a one year turnaround"
"&gt; it’s just way harder to evaluate talent in the NFL than it is in the NBA.  Is it, though? The NBA has lots of busts every draft too. For every Josh Rosen there's a Mo Bamba, for every Dwayne Haskins there's a Justin Jackson."
"How is that any different than Anthony Bennett, Jarrett Culver, Mo Bamba, Josh Jackson, Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn, Jahlil Okafor, Mario Hezonja, Dante Exum, Alex Len, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, or Thomas Robinson being set up to fail, or failed by their teams?"
"&gt; This is most blatant in the NFL when #1 drafts consistently get dropped into the worst team in the league (it being the worst team for a reason), then cannot develop and then get railroaded out of the league.  I think that's more that those guys just suck. NFL #1 picks are more likely to become all-stars than NBA #1 picks.   NFL #1 pick all-stars since 2000:   - All-stars (15): Kyler Murray, Myles Garrett, Jared Goff, Jameis Winston, Jadaveon Clowney, Eric Fisher, Andrew Luck, Cam Newton, Matt Stafford, Jake Long, Mario Williams, Alex Smith, Eli Manning, Carson Palmer, Mike Vick  - Non-all-stars (6): Joe Burrow, Baker Mayfield, Sam Bradford, Jamarcus Russell, David Carr, Courtney Brown  NBA #1 overall picks since 2000:   - All-stars (12): Ben Simmons, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, Lebron James, Yao Ming, Kenyon Martin  - Non-all-stars (9): Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, Deandre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Kwame Brown  Zion seems like a pretty sure bet to become an all-star in the future, but I could say the same for Burrow.   &gt; That's why the best NFL quarterbacks nowadays are mid-round picks and late round picks  Only 2 of them: Wilson and Brady. 4 if you wanna include ""good not great"" QBs like Kirk Cousins and Dak Prescott.   Meanwhile the 1st round QBs include: Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers, Deshaun Watson, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Phillip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Matt Ryan, Ryan Tannehill, Justin Herbert. That's already 10, not including any who were listed above as #1 overall picks.   Then you also have Drew Brees and Derek Carr as early 2nd rounders (ie, not midround picks)."
"I wasn't born for the first 2. But I feel really proud that the 2004 Pistons are ALWAYS the team that we talked about in the ""didn't have a superstar but won"" (even tho Chauncey and Ben were superstars for me) type of talk.  The tought of that is what made me survived years of Ben Gordon, Rodney Stuckey, Charlie Villanueva, Josh Smth and Reggie Jackson"
Cade to the pistons would truly bring back 2012 basketball   Cade Josh Jackson  Grant  Blake  Plumlee
Also Josh Jackson was looking like he may actually be a solid NBA player but then got injured
Josh Jackson who was pretty much out of league for a year (and with a reason) is dropping 14 per game
looks like Josh Jackson is back to being the player we thought he was
I thought Josh Selby from Kansas was gonna be like Baron Davis 2.0 lol  &amp;#x200B;  I was also really high on Josh Jackson and Stanley Johnson becoming Kawhi Leonard-lites.
I'm rooting for you guys because of Josh Jackson.
Mikal about to put Josh Jackson in jail.
"Not really I don’t think tbh. The signings aren’t generally that weird when you look at our games so far.   We just needed some veteran* guys so we weren’t playing first and second year guys 40 minutes a night with a short off-season and pre season prep.   Plumlee’s been playing well and done fine taking a big chunk of the starting center minutes, josh Jackson been playing great and still young, Grant has been the best player on the team so far and he’s a guy who wanted to play here so I don’t think he’ll be leaving soon, and Ellington is serviceable esp with Killian going down a while   Jah’s been  whatever but it’s a short and cheap deal we signed for him and Stewart has been getting his minutes lately so it’s not like okafor is hogging playing time from rookies  We *could* trade some but I don’t think it was primary intention really"
"Yeah. At first I thought he was going to be a Josh Jackson type, where he is athletic but wasn’t anything special at the NBA level.   Then I saw the sports science that said we was like top 1-2% in both acceleration and deceleration and figured I didn’t know shit"
I mean Josh Jackson looks pretty good too. I believe Killian Hayes has potential too but we'll have to see. He has to come back from injury and adjust to the nba game.
"A whole lot MJs game was predicated on off ball movement, coming off screens and being able to catch and shoot. He was an elite tier shooter, an elite tier athlete, and an elite tier open court player.  Most teams don't get the choice of having a Michael Jordan. They have to decide between a Joe Harris or Josh Jackson"
"Are you really trying to compare Josh Hart playing a video game to guys like Bo Jackson, Danny Ainge, and Deion Sanders? Deion played two pro sports on the same day I’m pretty sure, that’s impressive. I’m not sure Josh Hart logging onto Twitch after an NBA game is near the same thing as being a two sport pro athlete."
"I’ve been saying this for awhile now, Josh Jackson is the new Michael Beasley. All the talent in the world, some off court problems, and ultimately can’t put it all together but always being given a chance because of the potential."
"OP was asking about his play on the court, we already know Josh Jackson [is a bit of a dumbass](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2836018-suns-josh-jackson-arrested-after-trying-to-enter-vip-area-at-music-festival) off it"
"Josh Jackson could always play, he just was a knucklehead. If he has his head right, he’ll be fine"
Griffin/Grant/Rose/Josh Jackson/Sekou/Hayes/Bey/Plumlee
"Dante is on the Cavs and just got Injured. Jahlil Okafor is on the bench as a Piston. Emmanuel Mudiay is out of the league now. Stanley Johnson is on the Raptors but little playing time. Justise Winslow has been injured a long time but he is o the Grizzlies. Kris Dunn is an ok player  who plays for the Hawks now and is a very good defender. Thon Maker is on the Cavs basically almost out of the league. Skal is almost out of the league also. Josh Jackson is making a comeback this year on the Pistons. Frank Ntilikina is still on the Knicks. DSJ is still on the knicks. TJ Leaf  is a free agent I believe. Dwayne Bacon is on the Magic right now. Marvin Bagley is still doing well on the Kings but is injured a lot. Mo Bamba is trash on the Magic, Zhaire Smith is out of the league almost. Mo Wagner is ok on the Wizards now."
"Exum - Plays on the Cavs; Jazz traded him for Jordan Clarkson. Rotation player at best.  Jahlil - Third stringer on the Pistons; only good in very situational matchups. Could be out of the league soon.  Mudiay - Currently not playing in the NBA. Struggled in Utah although I think Utah should've kept him because they really don't have a backup point guard right now.  Stanley Johnson - Somehow got a player option on the Raptors; good wing defender but zero offensive presence. Raptors may need a guy with a skillset like him or he could be out of the league.  Justise Winslow - Has been injured for what seems like a year now on the Grizzlies. Hopefully he'll get a chance in their starting lineup but he's starting to look like a bust.  Dragan Bender - Bust, out of the league  Kriss Dunn - Third stringer on the Hawks now. Injured, but may see time for his defensive skills.  Thon Maker - Third stringer on the Cavs, may be out of the league soon.  Skal - Out of the league currently, wish somebody would give him a chance as a rotation center though.  Josh Jackson - Had a small resurgence in Memphis but signed with Detroit I believe. Could continue to develop as a rotation wing there.  TJ Leaf - Got salary dumped to OKC and then waived. Good riddance.  Okay I'm done."
That didn’t work as well for us with josh Jackson lol and the irony is we might’ve picked him before y’all this draft
Thon Maker - Bought into the hype that he’d develop into a shooting Giannis  Josh Jackson - Thought he was a better pick than Tatum  Harry Giles - Was a #1 prospect out of high school and underestimated his injury
I really thought Josh Jackson would develop into a star with us.
when Josh Jackson is back they'll pretend like they never talked crap
Yeah I think I’ll do that and reinvest in Josh Jackson since he’s on the rise
He does look like Josh Jackson who is definitely not that smart.

Like how Josh jackson revived his career
I was a pretty big Josh Jackson stan last season so glad to hear
Josh Jackson and Jerami Grant
"Fultz, Wiggins, josh Jackson"
"Haha back then, I was in the majority. Curry’s injury problems were too concerning and Monta seemed to have that “Kobe gene”.  Turns out that was about as dumb an opinion as Knicks fans booing the Porzingod pick or me cheering on the Josh Jackson and Dragan Bender picks. Turns out I have a lot of bad takes lmao (though I have also predicted things like Fultz being a bust and Kendall Marshall not deserving to be in the NBA let alone a lottery pick.)"
"Pistons fans: When did Josh Jackson become the starter? I knew he looked decent in the preseason and in the first few games, but the Pistons decide that a Rose/Hayes backcourt wasn't working out?"
"Lonzo was the obvious choice. Sure, his shot was very weird and had legit concerns, but his passing and IQ was incredibly high — too high to pass on. He was great on defense too. Plus, he actually shot it well from deep in college in terms of percentage and volume. Obviously college 3 doesnt directly translate to NBA 3, and there were legit concerns about his form, but many people were expecting him to be a 35% shooter from deep.  In hindsight, yeah, Tatum is better than Zo by a mile. But, Tatum was much more of a “project” at the time than Zo was. He wasnt actually a very efficient shooter in college and there were questions about his shot selection. People were also unclear about his defensive IQ because even though he racked up steals and blocks, there was doubt that it would translate completely against more athletic NBA opponents. Tatum obviously erased all of those doubts, but at the time, they were legit concerns. In fact, people were actually thinking that the Celts might pick Josh Jackson over Tatum. The Celtics knew they were taking Tatum, but media analysts were saying it was a toss up. No one really expected Tatum and Jackson to have the kind of careers they have had. Same goes for Zo — Lonzo did not pan out as we thought he would, but he was the clear #2 pick.   As far as DLo, again, there was really no way of knowing how he would pan out. Looking at the lottery, the only players that actually wouldve been better picks were Porzingis and Booker (everyone else basically busted except for Myles Turner).  Booker was never going to go #2 or top 10 for that matter. As far as Porzingis, DLo was definitely the safer choice at the time because there were concerns about Porzingis and how he would fare in the NBA. Heck, Knicks fans didnt like the Porzingis pick — imagine if the Lakers passed on DLo for Porzingis. The optics are better for DLo too. If DLo busts, oh well. If Porzingis busts, they would get flamed. So picking DLo was, again, the best choice at the time.  The Lakers scouted DLo and Zo well — they judt didnt pan out. That could be an issue of our player development, but the scouting did no wrong in drafting DLo and Zo."
Legitimately was. Obviously would love to have the Jays but it's probably more likely we take Josh Jackson and Dragan Bender if we had the old FO and didn't have a major culture overhaul by Marks lol
Yeah I think Josh Jackson scored a 59 pointer to open the second half
"Bey and Stewart seem like solid pieces with higher floors than killian. For his ceiling I am really high on killian as he has shown great passing ability finding open guys.   Stewart plays with so much energy reminds me of that one Charles Barkley vs Dennis Rodman rebounding clip.   I’m still high on Sekou but seems like he has a long way to go, especially because he’s not seeing too much Tim on the floor behind grant and Blake.   Also Josh Jackson is our new Christian wood."
We’re made up of a ton of young guys and a few veterans like rose griffin and Plummlee. Signed grant and Josh Jackson who have both been a great surprise and exceeded expectations. Depending on our draft pick this year/next year and how our young guys develop I think the future is much brighter than it’s been in a long long time
"There's a difference between using cannabis while working on your craft and doing the Josh Jackson "" hey random bro wanna smoke!?""  A big difference"
Cough up your Jerami Grant then bud you just said we needed him why you gotta be so selfish like damn. But more seriously I think a Josh Jackson type of player to round out the wing spot in an 8 man rotation would go a long way so what would you want back for him?
"Just because you don't have three half of famers don't mean your team is trash. Like jesus, you have a team with a bunch a good wing players, Draymond and the second overall pick. T-wolves are starting guys like Josh Okogie, Naz Ried and  old Rubio. It ain't comparable. Detroits second best player is Josh Jackson. Even without Curry you are not that bad."
"Why settle with 1 good SF when you can roll through 20 Small Forwards?        Here is a list I made a while ago, highlighting starters  &amp;#x200B;  1. **Ryan Gomes** 2. **Caron Butler** 3. Bobby Simmons 4. **Matt Barnes** 5. Grant Hill 6. Lamar Odom 7. **Jared Dudley** 8. Danny Granger 9. Antawn Jamison 10. Stephen Jackson 11. Hedo Turkoglu 12. Reggie Bullock 13. Dahntay Jones 14. Jordan Hamilton 15. **Paul Pierce** 16. Lance Stephenson 17. **Jeff Green** 18. **Wesley Johnson** 19. Josh Smith 20. **Luc Mbah a Moute**"
"Absolutely not lol. The Pistons are a team that competes very hard. They are just so young and untalented. After grant and Wright, they are heavily relying on DSJ, Josh Jackson, Saben Lee, Saddiq Bey, and Isaiah Stewart. 2 of those guys were busts and the other 3 are rookies. And that’s after losing Blake to a buy out and Rose to a trade. No coach is winning with a roster like that.   Compare that with their neighbors in the standings like the Magic, Timberwolves, Kings, Pelicans, Wizards, Rockets, etc who in my opinion who have much more talented rosters but are performing worse based on their expectations."
"If I were a rookie I'd rather go play for the warriors than the Timberwolves..... you get to learn from veterans like Steph and get yelled at by Draymond.  I feel bad for rookies who go to franchises that force them into 30 minute roles without development, and after a year or two of suffering they are basically out of the league.  Examples: \*Dennis Smith Jr, \*Josh Jackson (Ironically both are finding a new career in Detroit)"
"Josh Jackson  From Detroit and playing for them, definitely a dog. Needs work but he might reel it in"
"Hey we're missing 3 of our best defenders too. Josh Jackson, Jerami, Delon"
original comment was Dragan Bender over Murray (his exact kentucky statline)  mine was Josh Jackson over DeAaron Fox
"2017: Took Josh Jackson over De'Aaron Fox, Jonathan Isaac, Donovan Mitchell and Bam Adebayo.   2016: Took Dragan Bender over Jamal Murrayand Buddy Hield, and then proceeded to also take Marquese Chriss over Domantas Sabonis."
"Players that are no longer on the team from 2 years ago (not gonna name EVERYONE, just the notables):  Qunicy Acy, Ryan Anderson, Trevor Ariza, Dragen Bender, Isiah Canaan. Tyson Chandler. Jamal Crawford. Troy Daniels, Jimmer Freddette, Richaun Holmes, Josh Jackson, Tyler Johnson, TJ Warren  Players that remained on the team:  Deandre Ayton, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges  Players they have acquired since then that are on the team this year:  Cameron Johnson, Chris Paul, Jaw Crowder, Jalen Smith, Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky, Cameron Payne, E'Twuan Moore  I dont know about Monty but James Jones deserves a ton of credit."
"Still feels like a fever dream lol I can't believe we once were putting our future hopes in the hands of Bender, Chriss, Josh Jackson, Trevor Ariza, g league guards, and Earl Watson. No wonder we were winning 19 games a year. Scratch that, how did we even win 19 games"
Josh Jackson is absolutely trash. His off court issues just make him easy to hate
"I feel kinda triggered you’re comparing Josh Jackson to those bums tbh. He was good besides his off court shoes, no?"
We needed to get rid of Josh Jackson
Gave up 2 seconds and Melton to get rid of Josh Jackson and acquire Jevon. Great deal for Kleiman and the Grizz to accept in an extraordinary off-season.
Wasnt that more about them wanting to get rid of Josh Jackson?
"Yup. Totally the defense. The supporting cast of Isaiah Canaan, Mike James, Ryan Anderson, Jimmer Fredette, Tyler Ulis, Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss, Josh Jackson, Brandon Knight, and Elie Okobo all did what they could. Earl Watson and Igor Kokoskov coached their tails off... but Book's defense was just too bad 😔"
He pushed off of Josh Jackson
"Score was 106-104.  Hield scored a spectacular putback and was fouled by Josh Jackson to put Sacramento up 108-104.  The Pistons challenged and it was judged that Hield actually fouled Jackson on the rebound, thus the score was put back to 106-104 and Jackson got two free throws because the Kings were over the limit."
"Detroit Pistons reviving careers, Christian Wood, Josh Jackson, now hopefully DSJ"
"They were trying to lose last year. Wiggins isn’t amazing but he is by all accounts a plus defender and is pretty efficient this year, ditto Oubre. No one is saying that GSW has a ton of talent, but to say they are the worst team in the league when Detroit’s two best players are probably Jerami Grant and Josh Jackson/Plumlee is pretty laughable."
"Stanley Johnson, Jaylen Brown, Josh Jackson, Mikal Bridges, Rui Hachimura, DeAndre Hunter, Patrick Williams, Issac Okoro"
"Mavs fans are fucking toxic. It's gotten to the point whre Porziņģis and Rick Carlisle and now Josh Richardson (formerly Tim Hardaway Jr.) get hate and are diminished in their value/impact as a means of propping Luka up.   Luka is incredible. Very likely he goes down as the Mavs GOAT if he stays here long enough. He for sure has the skillset. But you don't need to blame everyone else to make him look better. That sub has just basically become a Luka hivemind and then a ""no we shouldn't fire Rick Carlisle, or trade Kristaps Porziņģis and a first round pick for Andre Drummond"" minority.   The amount of hate Kristaps gets on there is unreal. He's our 3rd player to average 20+ ppg since Michael Finley in 2002, but you'd think he was Erick Dampier the way folks complain about him. He's barely removed from knee surgery and is still averaging 21 &amp; 8 on 47/36/84. Jaren Jackson Jr. had the same surgery 2 months before him and still isn't even back on the court.   It's just super reactionary over there."
"Kansas  PG: Devonte’ Graham  SG: Oubre Jr, Ben McLemore  SF: Wiggins, Josh Jackson, Svi  PF: The Morris Twins  C: Embiid  The starters look good, but the bench would be awful. There are also 2 Kansas rookies this year that play PG and Center so they could fill out the roster there, but they’ve mostly just sat on the bench all year."
Lavine and josh Jackson
"In theory, you’re right, but that wasn’t going to happen. The Sixers didn’t have interest in Tatum. They had telegraphed that they were in love with Fultz and that the trade was essentially for Fultz. Ainge does not make that trade unless he has a high degree of certainty that Tatum will not be picked by the Sixers or the Lakers. If anyone, the Sixers would have picked Lonzo Ball or Josh Jackson over Tatum."
I feel like that one wouldn’t have been too bad considering the Kyrie trade went down the season where Josh Jackson was drafted top 5.
"Let me explain my perspective.   For years, Suns fans were holding on to hope that Bender, Chriss, and Jackson would all develop into something really good. Ya, i know it seems like i am joking, but i am not.   The whole tank for a high pick, and punt on another season for a high pick. And selling your fans on the idea of the timeline was SCAMMING.   Ryan McDonugh built a losing culture in the process or trying to hit the lotto, this was AWFUL for team morale.   Then.    James Jones came in, and changed the CULTURE by bringing in vets like Rubio, Dario, and Baynes and hiring someone with high character and high leadership.    None of that young players getting gifted minutes to develop.  You had to earn your minutes.   And James Jones doesn't put up with bad character players.  That's actually the main reason, he got rid of Josh Jackson.  Only high character guys on the Suns.   And James Jones makes sure he is on the same page with Devin Booker, but the final decision is all James Jones.   Booker wanted D'Lo, James Jones said no, because he wasn't a fan of the fit long term (probably).    James Jones and Monty Willams are on the same page, and james Jones is a 3 time Champ and knows CULTURE   And that is one think that Finch and Rosas will benefit from.   I say they should clean house with their roster, because KAT deserves better"
Suns fans were against trading Marqueese Chriss and Josh Jackson for Kyrie couple of years ago lol

Josh Jackson is playing pretty well in Detroit though
"I'm starting to think that any player drafted for athleticism is an almost sure early warning sign for a bust. DSJ, Marquese Chriss, Josh Jackson, Mudiay, MKG, even going back to Tyrus Thomas or Stromile Swift. It's the the basketball equivalent of brawn and no brain."
"Josh Jackson actually looks quite a bit better, and I have to say Saddiq seems pretty impressive."
"Are we gonna talk about Josh Jackson? I know he’s kind of crazy, but holy shit dude is balling right now."
Josh Jackson is a fucking baller man
"Maybe the Pelicans should sign Dragan Bender, Tyler Ulis, Isaiah Canaan, Josh Jackson, and Tyson Chandler if they're having trouble getting to .500"
I thought Josh Jackson would be a lot better than Jayson Tatum
I thought the Celtics should’ve drafted Josh Jackson over Tatum. I was a dumbass
Josh Jackson
Don't be slandering Josh Jackson   Man just needed a change of scenery and to grow up a little. Hoping Casey can unlock him with another year of development  Stanley was a bust from the jump
Who was saying that? That's such a hot take lol. He at least showed something unlike guys like Stanley Johnson and Josh Jackson
"Oh definitely.  It's like how Phoenix was a few years ago where they managed to draft back to back busts with the 4th pick (Josh Jackson is putting it back together, but you get the point)."

"Yep or when Zach Lavine got raked on the neck by Josh Jackson, spoke to jackson, jackson swiped the ball from Lavine on a deadball situation and it was a double technical..."
Josh Jackson got this treatment earlier this year
"We somehow convinced ourselves that Josh Jackson, Marquese Chriss, and Dragan Bender are the future. Remember when Earl Watson said he wanted to run Bender at the point and we all got hyped for some reason..."
Yeah pretty sure that's the scratch from Josh Jackson
"I've seen possessions where Zion never touches the ball and fucking Jackson Hayes gets a play set up for him by Josh Hart, I see 0 reasons by Reddick shouldn't be given more shots if they wanna fuck around like that"
"You're stalking all my comments? That's legitimately sad. I now understand why you reacted so hard regarding Josh Jackson, you're just like him, trash fanbase thinking they're anywhere near average. Imagine defending a legitimate bust lol."
&gt; You sucked and still made it cause the East is so bad lmao  Which is not tanking   &gt;Which is the only reason Josh Jackson looks somewhat competent  No one is calling him a super star or anything. God damn all of you embarrassing as fuck.
"&gt; it means we didn't look like a tanking team, Einstein  You sucked and still made it cause the East is so bad lmao  &gt; .. because we're tanking  Which is the only reason Josh Jackson looks somewhat competent"
You're right. Let's add Garrison Matthews to the list of people Josh Jackson could beat up.
Low key he's live of dirty. Look up his shit he did to Rubio when he was on Utah. Pretty sure fucking Josh Jackson was involved too.
"Josh Jackson and doubling down on looking like a bitch, what a combo!"
"Prime Rose, Blake, Jerami Grant, Josh Jackson, rookie Jahlil Okafor, Mason Plumlee, Wayne Ellington. The Pistons would go from the worst team in the East to a playoff team, but I don't think they would have been title contenders."
Didn't see what happened but I thought for a second that Josh Jackson had a podcast called dustup.
"Josh Jackson might have the record for starting the most shit against players that he would definitely get bodied by in real fights.   I remember he called Ben Simmons a bitch and at that moment I remember thinking if I was the refs I would pause the game and say ""ok let's go you two, two minutes. Everyone else out of the way."" I can't think of one NBA player that I would pick Jackson in a fight over."
Josh Jackson talks shit all the time. Lavine prob had enough of it and told him what's up.
Josh Jackson will lock you in his car.
Didn’t see what happened but Josh Jackson is a douche I have to say
Pistons came in bringing their bad boy shit again. Hacking Zach on every drive but the refs don't respect him at all. Josh Jackson scratched his neck during this play
Josh Jackson has already entered the late stage Jared Dudley phase of his career where he’s an “enforcer” because he can’t do anything else
"Josh Jackson is straight up dogshit. Dude manages to string together 5 decent games a month and fans think he ""figured it out""."
We don't trash talk Josh Jackson
josh Jackson is so annoying. talks a lot of shit for being ass
"Suns  2011: 13 markieff Morris  2012: 13 Kendall Marshall  2013: 5 Alex Len  2014: 14 tj warren, 18 James ennis   2015: 13 Devin booker  2016 4 dragon bender, 13 Georgia’s papagiannis  + 2nd round pick bogdon bogdanovic traded for 8 marquess chriss  2017 4 josh Jackson  2018: 1 Deandre ayton, 16 zhaire smith  2019: 6 Jarrett culver traded for saric + 11 cam johnson   2020: 10 Jalen smith"
The suns had to dump Josh Jackson because nobody wanted him and the Grizzlies let him walk because they wanted to sign John Konchar.  If i'm the pistons I would just hold him and let him play. Might turn good.
"Josh Jackson and Mason plumlee are not getting traded, and delon wright shouldn't and probably won't. Idk why but everyone has an obsession with selling everyone that isn't young, it's ok to have some vets and rotational pieces. Also next year is Blake's last year of his contract, waiting it out isn't really that bad"
"&gt; I don't think he'll ever be a star as befitting his draft position, but he has a spot in the league if he keeps this up  Slow/rough starts aren't the career killers that r/nba instantly likes to make them out as.  It will limit your upside though, as these are years where future superstars start learning advanced skills - like Tatum learning to play PG this season.  Meanwhile guys like Josh Jackson are still focusing on the basics.    But he's only 24 and still has the same size/athleticism that made him a terrific prospect - he can definitely be a respectable player in this league.  Maybe that's only more of a 6th man type, but nothing wrong with that."
Where was this comment when Josh Jackson called him a bitch? That’s more disrespectful than this
"He’s earned a few starts that Casey definitely made him work for. With Blake out of the rotation, Bey moves into the starting role for good. These Pistons have been an absolute blast to watch. Grant slotting into the four really opens up a few more options for guys that have earned minutes. Josh Jackson is definitely going to go for 40 at some point this season. Stewart has the Ben Ben motor. Plumlee, Ellington, and Wright have all played well. And Dennis Smith is looking like he’ll fit right in. Front office has its shit together. Weaver’s going to Empty the Clip!"
I feel bad about not drafting Fox instead of Josh Jackson or Tyrese Haliburton instead of Jalen Smith. Ayton is an excellent player and Luka is overrated.
He definitely has Josh Jackson potential
"You're taking with hindsight. It absolutely was not considered an awful move at the time. And the jurys still 100% out on Hayes. Anyways, drafting Bey and Stewart, signing the MIP to a very solid deal, and getting a reclamation project in Josh Jackson who has been balling out were all fantastic moves.   You were somehow bothered enough with Weavers moves to make this post, and you were wrong about nearly all of them. Buncha Pistons fans in here just poking some fun but youre digging down deeper lol"
"Winning culture has everything to do with drafting and signing guys who want to be there and will bond with the other guys. How good the players are isn’t the most important thing.  Take the Suns for example, they hired Monty Williams in 2019 and the first thing he said was “we’re gonna make sure we establish a winning culture before anything else.” The Suns made moves for positive energy guys. They got rid of Josh Jackson and TJ Warren, guys who have tunnel vision or might cause the locker room morale to go down.  Suns were mediocre but guys were really close and the bench was always active. They’d celebrate after EVERY play. Then the bubble came and Phoenix became even more attractive.   Every new guy who came to Phoenix last offseason mentioned Phoenix’s culture as a reason to come here. It’s about having good guys who work hard, play hard and are willing to listen and learn. They want to win together."
"The Pistons are in development mode so makes sense to me. Griffin has no future with this team, and the minutes he plays could be better spent on further developing young guys like Josh Jackson or Saddiq Bey."
“ROTY contender Saddiq Bey”   “Absolute stud Isaiah Stewart”  “Josh Jackson has been incredible”
Troy Weaver won’t get it because the pistons are bad but he’s been unbelievable given what he inherited:   - Drafted ROTY candidate Saddiq Bey  - Drafted absolute stud Isaiah Stewart   - Signed Jerami Grant to a moderate deal who’s now taken the leap to All Star level   - Signed Delon Wright who’s now viewed as an asset  - Signed Mason Plumlee who’s now viewed as an asset   - Signed Josh Jackson who has been incredible  - Traded an expiring Derrick Rose for a second and Dennis Smith Jr who continues to look better by the game   and none of this is including the drafting of Killian Hayes who we have no idea what he can become
"That’s the whole point dumbass, we’re tanking. You said “anyone on this sub can do better than Weaver” while the draft picks Weaver’s gotten, Stewart and Bey, were some of the biggest steals of the draft. Bey just put up 30 points. Jerami Grant is the MIP favourite and borderline all-star; Plumlee put up a triple-double last night.  Pinning Wood on Weaver is a brain dead move considering Weaver said signing Wood was the priority, he wanted to leave. Brown wouldn’t have done anything for us, Josh Jackson is much better for us . Every FA player has increased their value exponentially with us, and will prove to be great assets. Plus, we’re in the race to get Cade next year."
"&gt; freak   seems like things are trending in the right direction. Bey looks like a stud and they got him at 19, Stewart looks like he could develop into a nice big with some edge and some range, Hayes I don't like but too early to say. Grant looks like an All Star and Weaver saw it in him when no one else did, Plumlee lookin like a steal at 8mill per, Josh Jackson lookin like a 6th man of the year type...problem is all the dead weight from the past like you mentioned."
"I honestly thought Josh Jackson was going to be a superstar after the Suns drafted him. Crazy athleticism along with parts of an complete all-around player. His rookie year with the Suns he showed flashes of crazy dunks and strong drives, could get hot from 3, flashes of great passing and court vision, and the ability to get blocks and steals on the defensive end and be a 2-way player. Jackson ultimately struggled in his rookie year, but with some insane flashes of how good he could be. I thought if he put all of the pieces of his skillset together he would dominate. But it didn't happen, and his off-court actions with the Suns certainly didn't help.   I'm sure Pistons and maybe to a lesser extent Grizzlies fans have seen glimpses of Jackson looking unstoppable if he just put all of his talents together consistently and just played smarter basketball."
"Trading him for a player as good as Collins is hating? Get your head out of your ass, Barrett is just another Josh Jackson."
"There's not anybody ahead of Sekou other than Blake right?  I mean as long as Bey, Sekou and to a lesser degree Svi/Josh Jackson are getting consistent bench minutes there's no reason to sound the alarm."

"Low key, you guys are super fun to watch.   Josh Jackson has looked amazing ."
Josh Jackson been lookin legit for them lately as well and he’s really fun to watch when he’s playing well
Josh Jackson??
"Josh Jackson reviving his career is fun, even DSJ did something positive today"
Plumdog Triple-aire and Josh Jackson dropping great games. If these are NBA rejects we need more
"Why limit to ‘outside the top 10’ unless you want to manipulate this shit. DA got Smart at 6 with the Cs own pick but he got Brown and Tatum through trades that HE MADE. Brown was considered a reach by most people across the league and now is the best player from that draft class. The Fultz for Tatum trade was considered stupid by most, and Tatum at 3 was also highly debated as many though Josh fucking Jackson or Fox should have been third. DA got the best player in that draft too.   Eliminating three excellent selections and then saying he is a shit or average drafter is asisine.   You can do this selective arguing about anything but it’s always bullshit. If you take away Michael Jordan’s jump shot, his endurance, killer mentality, clutch performances, and incredible defence then he was just an average player."
Idk but they are probably the best trap team we ever faced. Josh jackson just turned into an all star against us
Josh jackson will be an all star
04? We have nightmares of the current pistons. Josh jackson fucking torched us
"saddiq, beef stew, killian, sekou, josh jackson, grant, svi,...delon wright maybe"
"Bay had 45 threes this season, 14 of them are against us in 3 games, which is fucking hilarious considering the Nesmith pick.  The offense was just terrible, Pritchard finally had a bad game, but even with the Jays scoring 60 it was just plain bad. But hey, Kemba should be benched amirite?   Not that it’d have mattered, but I have no idea how the Josh Jackson foul on Jaylen wasn’t a Flagrant 1."
"Surprisingly enough, it's Josh Jackson, if I'm not mistaken"
"Yeah I mean I’m a die hard warriors fan, so I actually hope I’m wrong on pool. Its just not looking great because the dubs in years past management wise tend to pull the trigger on a player around year 3, which is creeping up on Poole. They did it with Mccaw, they did it with Evans, they did it with Jones. Other teams tend to as well, looking at even lottery picks such as fultz, lonzo, Justin Jackson, Josh Jackson, etc. So realistically he has about one year to prove he belongs"

"Josh Jackson was actually pretty good for the Memphis Hustle. So good we called him up during the middle of last season. He was a hustler for us on defense and scored 20+ pts a few times before the pandemic put the pause on the season. Sadly, he wasn't so good on the bubble and he was on an expiring I believe. Treat him well; Grizzlies fans like him."
"2017 draft on the other was pretty bad tho lol Lonzo, Fultz, Josh Jackson, Ntilikina, DSJ, Zach Collins, Malik Monk, Luke Kennard, all didn't pan out. Imagine if I told you that that you your team has a 57% chance at drafting a disappointment"
"The Pistons are one of the worst offensive teams in the NBA - so I'd say a F.  The team's only pure shooters are Wayne Ellington (a vet who needs other to get him shots) Saddiq Bey (a rookie who is still inconsistent) &amp; Frank Jackson (a 2-way player who is shooting well form 3 for the first time in his career).  On top of that, the only offensive creators on the team are Jerami Grant (who is not yet a good passer), Hamidou Diallo (who only recently arrived in Detroit) and Josh Jackson (who is very inefficient).   On a bright side - the Pistons actually have a solid defensive team."
Pistons got DSJ and Josh Jackson too.
It could stand to reason though that having attention taken away from you by Steph Curry/Jerami Grant could result in a fairly different outcome statistically than Damion Lee/Josh Jackson
"I think it is mostly luck and basically a crapshoot. For example the Suns drafted Booker at the 13th pick but he was mocked around there and the Suns would have likely picked Mario Hezonja or Stanley Johnson instead if they fell. Similarly the draft class they got Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss was seen as an amazing draft class but ended up sucking. Kelly Olynyk was drafted by the Celtics who are seen as a great drafting team and I remember during the GM/front office survey he was seen as the biggest steal of the draft and not Giannis who was drafted two picks after him.  Also, another talking point people talk about is ""well, he was drafted by the right team and developed him is the reason he busted."" This may be the case were one team brings up the best of a player more than another to a certain extant but I think this is severely overrated as well for true busts. If this was case we would see a lot more busts who sucked on one team all of a sudden blossom on another that unlocks their potential. For example Josh Jackson was still only 22 years old when the Suns gave up on him and still was extremely young. If he had the super high potential that was hidden away and not developed because of the Suns he would have turned into the next Kawhi lite or w/e when he switched teams. The last time I can think of this sort of happening when one player is seen like a bust and then blossoms on other team is Tobias Harris but even he doesn't entirely fit the scenario."
"Yeah having Book, Ayton, Mikal, and Cam as a young core is light years better than anything we've seen during the decade of suck prior to this year. This isn't Marquese Chriss, Bender, Josh Jackson, etc. anymore. We have real guys to build around after CP3 is gone."
"&gt;  I could probably argue Wiggins and Josh Jackson  The fact that you think you could argue this says everything about your knowledge of RJ's defense.   Half of those aren't even playing SG and aren't even better since you just basically listed reputation, not actual play this season.  ""Whichever guy the Pacers are starting at the 2"", wtf? Basically it doesn't matter who, but he's clearly better? Ok man.  But let's just agree to disagree, in the end I don't really care that much. Time will prove it."
"Fine, call him a 2.   Jrue. FVV. Jaylen. Jimmy. Danny Green. Whichever guy the Pacers are starting at the 2--is it Holiday now? Josh Richardson. Will Barton. Rozier. Derrick White. Lonzo. That's 13.   Sterling Brown, if you count him as the Rockets 2. I could probably argue Wiggins and Josh Jackson, too.   Depending on which guy you consider a team's 2, the list changes. If you want to go just ""wings"" in general, it's even harder for me to consider him in that top-24 (because so many of the worst defenders in the league are starting 2s)"
"You aren’t familiar with the elite tier spacing that Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Josh Jackson, Delon Wright, Killian Hayes, and Jahlil Okafor were providing Blake early this season so that nobody was clogging the lane defensively?"
"Eh, it’s not rude to say that about a team that basically nobody other than devoted fans keeps track of. Well, for one Saddiq Bey is easily one of the top-5 rookies in this year’s draft class and is arguably the second best three point shooter in it after Haliburton, so that’s something pretty much every Pistons fan is excited about. Isaiah Stewart has been pretty exciting to watch for us as well because of his defensive-minded and aggressive style of play, which is pretty much the definition of Pistons basketball, he also shown flashes of outside shooting which would make him a really nice building block moving forward, oh and he’s 19 years old so he’ll have plenty of time to develop here. Hayes doesn’t look like much just yet, but he’s also nineteen, is already a decent playmaker, has good size and plenty of potential. We also have a bunch of young players who have a good chance to help the team in long term, like Diallo, Saben Lee and Josh Jackson(who is a Detroit native and has been playing his heart out for us) and a bunch of cheap guys that we took a flyer on who try their best to prove their worth as NBA players(DSJ, Cook, Okafor, also Josh Jackson is in this category as well), never mind Grant proving himself as an All-Star candidate level of player. Also for the first time since 2003 we have a good chance of getting a high pick in the next draft which already looks quite promising. Obviously it’s not the same as having Sexland and Allen as far as young cores and concerned, but Garland and Sexton weren’t exactly spectacular their first year either, were they? So yeah, for the first time in forever Pistons have a clear direction and a definitive young group of players to build with and it’s quite nice to watch for the franchise that’s been suffering through mediocrity for the last 13 years. We’re in a rebuild right now, but I’d argue watching this team has been the most fun I’ve had as a Pistons fan since what feels like forever."
They playing monkey in the middle with Josh Jackson.
We believed that it would be a huge mistake to trade josh Jackson for Kyrie years ago
Josh Jackson actually guarded the play pretty well. There was just no defensive rotation.
"Or it doesn’t. See: Wiggins, Exum, Josh Jackson, etc"
To be fair he did look more like Josh Jackson in the second game against the suns on 4/18 shooting and 11 points.
Anthony Edwards is a force of nature figuring it out.  Where is the Suns fan arguing with me that Edwards is the next Josh Jackson the night before he put up 42 points?
Ant is on pace to have a worse rookie season than Josh Jackson and Ben McLemore and y'all are proclaiming him DWade 2.0.
"It's like if Marcus Smart and Josh Jackson had a child, and only taught it to flop."

Bulls (Markkanen, Wendell, Coby)  Knicks (Knox, Ntilikina, Toppin)  Magic (Gordon, Hezonja, Isaac, Bamba)  Suns (Bender, Josh Jackson, Chriss)  All those teams got good picks for years but, kept struggling most of the time you really need the #1-3 overall pick to turn around your franchise and for that you need to give yourself the best chance and lose as much as you can"
"Everyone treats Haliburton like he's an elder rookie, it's bizarre to me. Like he's a low ceiling kind of guy coming out of 4 years at college. He was basically dead average in terms of age of rookies drafted, but the 1st round skews a little younger.  People always bring up Malcolm Brogdon which *kind of* makes sense in play style, but there's always an ""old rookie"" subtext to it. Haliburton at his debut was over 3 years younger than Brodgon at his debut.   Some previous rookies who were treated as young guys with high potential that were actually older than Haliburton when they were drafted: PJ Washington, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Josh Jackson, Robert Williams"

"Think about it this way.  Ben Simmons was a consensus #1 pick.  The likelihood that any of those picks ends up being #1, let alone #1 in a year where there's a clear frontrunner, is pretty low.  Yeah, you could get lucky like the Celtics did and pull off multiple top 3 picks, but that trade looks way better in hindsight and could have easily been 3 top 10-15 picks.   I'm not saying it was a bad decision necessarily, but it is true that the likelihood of any of those picks being better than Ben Simmons as a prospect is low. That doesn't even count savvy/lucky drafting on the Celtics part.  Tatum could have easily been Fultz or Lonzo (or Josh Jackson), and the next two picks after Jaylen Brown was Dragan Bender and Kris Dunn.  Just saying, 4 picks and 4 swaps isn't a guarantee of anything."
"A good young known player is always way better than unknown draft picks.  Everyone gets drunk on the idea of picks but man looking back drafting is still such a shit show.  And now the tanking odds are worst than ever.    Here are some of the top five picks from the last 5 years. 2016, 4th Pick - Dragon Bender, 5th Pick Kris Dunn  2017 1st Pick - Fultz, 4th Pick Josh Jackson  2018 2nd Pick Marvin Bagley    those are just the strait busts.  Luka is prob the only guy that would be definitively taken before Ben."
"Warren and Melton hurt, but in the end it was for cap space that got us Rubio, and that helped get us CP3 so I really can't complain.  I was so pissed when we had to let Melton go. We had to trade Melton just to get rid of Josh Jackson, and even though it's worked out I miss Melton. Him and Bridges would be a ridiculous defensive duo right now"
We better start playing Josh Jackson or we're gonna fuck around and end up outside the bottom 5.
Just like josh Jackson lmao

Where did    Josh Jackson  disappeared
"Josh Jackson is shooting nearly 40% from 3 on over 7 attempts? Jackson is on his way to play in China, and Trent is gonna get several offer sheets in RFA. Really makes you think if efficiency is the best way to compare these 2 players."
"My man, GTJ is shooting on nearly same efficiency as Josh Jackson"
"I just had a thought? Who’s even the best player Drummond has ever played with?  Old and broken Klove? “Prime” Greg Monroe? Josh Smith? Corpse of Brandon Jennings? Reggie Jackson before we knew he sucked?  I mean legit it’s a really fucking ugly list, idk how people can hold not winning against this guy when the list of the best players he’s played with might not make a g league roster"
That one where Omri Casspi cooked Josh Jackson so hard the basketball gods had to take out his knees
Josh Jackson under DSJ?
I’ll try for our team:  • Jerami Grant • Mason Plumlee • Saddiq Bey • Isaiah Stewart • Wayne Ellington • Dennis Smith Jr. • Saben Lee • Josh Jackson • Frank Jackson • Rodney Mcgruder
"Currently as they are they will have about $1 to $2 million only. But they can free up $15 million because Corey Joseph only has $2 million of his $12 million dollar salary guaranteed and Rodney McGruder has $5 million non-guaranteed. Not guaranteeing both frees up $15 million. They also have Josh Jackson and Okafor who add up to $7 million in expiring contracts that could be easily moved if they needed more. If they really wanted him, they wouldn't have a tough time creating the cap space."
"If you look at the last 20 years of 4th picks, you'd probably take 17/5/3 and 40% on threes - basically Miller's first 10 years - over half of them?  Patrick Williams Deandre Hunter Jaren Jackson Jr Josh Jackson Dragan Bender Kristaps Porzingis Aaron Gordon Cody Zeller Dion Waiters Tristan Thompson Wesley Johnson Tyrese Evans Mike Conley Russell Westbrook Tyrus Thomas Chris Paul Shaun Livingston Chris Bosh Drew Gooden Eddy Curry"
"Let’s see the picks that surrounded them. Tatum was chosen over the consensus first overall pick Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, and Josh Jackson.   Jaylen was drafted over Dragan Bender and Kriss Dunn.   Marcus Smart was drafted next to Nik Stauskas, Noah Vonleh, Dante Exum, and Jabari Bird.  At what point are we gonna dispel the idea that just because you are drafting high means that the pick is going to work out. It’s absolutely crazy to not reward GM’s for making the correct pick, even high in the draft.   Jayson is the best player out of everybody in his draft class. Jaylen is the best player in his as well (I personally think he’s better than Simmons because Simmons can just get schemed out in the playoffs and has been in the past).   I seriously don’t know why people use this as an argument."
I used to be so thankful that Josh Jackson was straight up rejecting over teams to do workouts bc he wanted to be in phx for the absolute freedom on the court. lmao

Suns could have drafted   * Jamal Murray  * Domantas Sabonis  * Donavan Mitchell  * Luka Doncic  Instead of :  * Dragan Bender  * Marquese Chriss  * Josh Jackson  * DeAndre Ayton  to pair with Booker since. This game can be played with pretty much every team in the lottery.
"For sure, I made a false equivalency with very little knowledge of the personality of Josh Jackson for example and equated that to Anthony Edwards. There was very little information there, but the little information that I had correlated them...  But turns out that I was wrong. Anthony Edwards despite having those similarities with Josh Jackson is actually willing to put in the work. I wish only the best for him and am glad he has Ricky to mentor him (but #FreeRicky anyways lol)"
Dinwiddie and Grant are 27. Jackson is nothing— every team has a Josh Jackson. Hayes is at best a question Mark.  That’s not a core and I wouldn’t call it nice.

"Those guys fight for their NBA future, those 2 specifically could've been out of the league next year.  Now Kenrich might even not be a minimum guy anymore he's been that good.  Thanks for Hami a bit scared that he's very redundant with Josh Jackson."
"Dragan Bender, Josh Jackson, and Marquese Chriss all lived up to their potential ehh?!"
Josh Jackson is such a bust lol
Kuminga stock has dropped significantly. Looks like the next Josh Jackson. Can’t shoot at all and just too weak to finish around NBA caliber bigs. He’s a tier below Jalen Green
"I'll add Rod Strickland, Andre Miller, Marcus Camby, Josh Smith, Stephen Jackson and Monta Ellis to your list."
"Our entire last draft has looked incredible so far. Haven’t seen enough of Killian Hayes yet but Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, and Saben Lee have been fantastic all year and will hopefully be key pieces as we go along. Josh Jackson and Mason Plumlee have been great too but I’m not sure how they factor into the future. Hopefully we can get one of the top guys in the draft like Cade, Suggs, or Green who can make a huge impact immediately. I trust Weaver in FA and the draft and we’ve played a lot better than our record so I’m optimistic for the first time in a long time."
"Danuel House broke covid rules and compromised the bubble, but he still has a place in the league. Jason Kidd was arrested for hitting his wife, Josh Jackson was arrested for getting his infant son high, plenty of other players have done much worse things. I’m not defending Meyers Leonard, but I doubt saying a fairly uncommon slur on twitch is going to end his career. If he can still play decently off the bench, then he’ll still get another contract. If not, he was out of the league anyways"
"Mason Plumlee  Saddiq Bey  Josh Jackson  Saban Lee  Actually committing to a rebuild instead of perpetually drafting 12th  Delon Wright(grabbed them a few seconds)  Derrick Rose (grabbed them a young prospect and a second)  Isaiah Stewart   They have been shitty but competitive, one of the most enjoyble rebuilds in the league rn"
The josh Jackson effect....
"&gt;Recent #4 picks have been Patrick Williams, Hunter, JJJ, Josh Jackson, Dragan, Kristnaps, Aaron Gordon, Zeller, Waiters, Tristan, Wesley Johnson.  Yes I'll take one of those, thanks."
"&gt; Also, if the Minny picks conveys this year, the Dubs should be charged with robbery as a result of this trade.  Injuries to Russell and KAT have drastically changed the perspective people have regarding this trade. Here is the [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ezw6ph/wojnarowski_golden_state_has_agreed_to_trade/)from when it happened.  In the end, I truly believe there is no way to view the trade as a robbery because:  1) Wiggins clearly wasn't able to be maximized by the Wolves organization  2) The theoretical benefit of keeping KAT happy cannot be measured (he wanted to play with D-Lo)  3) At worst the pick conveys this year at 4th overall (or in theory next years draft at #1 overall). Although lottery picks are always valuable, it's really the 1 or 2 pick that usually provide immediate value. Recent #4 picks have been Patrick Williams, Hunter, JJJ, Josh Jackson, Dragan, **Kristnaps**, Aaron Gordon, Zeller, Waiters, Tristan, Wesley Johnson. Obviously different organizations can be better at drafting but that's 11 drafts in a row where the #4 pick (outside Porzingis) hasn't produced all-star level talent.  4) On top of all that, the Wolves do not need more young, developing talent. If the pick conveys this year at 4 (in what is supposed to be a strong draft) we miss out on that asset but with KAT on the team we should be trying to compete for a playoff spot.  Looking back at the thread, many people predicted a Wiggins renaissance. Clearly the Warriors saw that potential and I'm assuming our front office did as well. But it was definitely the right move for the Wolves to make, even looking at it now."
iinm Josh Jackson was their GM that year
JOSH JACKSON BAYBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
He’s already back in the league but I think Josh Jackson is on his way to a very solid career after being stuck off and on the G-League early in his career.

"Lol is he wrong? Grant wasn't really ""trash"" per say, but Frank Jackson and Josh Jackson most definitely were. DSJ looked solid too but he's been injured for a while."
J is being slept on heavy here. Take out Josh Jackson and put in Cameron Johnson.  Also would have Dort instead of Dante for D.  For L take out Love and add Lowry. Make Leonard PF.
"Basically our entire team this year. Diallo, Grant, Josh Jackson, Frank Jackson"
"Tatum wasn't even #3 on most boards though. If the Lakers were smoke screening it would have been for Josh Jackson.   Tatum is only #3 on later boards because Boston now had the #3 pick and it was clear they had been keen on him for a while (and Jackson had skipped out on his Boston workouts last minute).  But if you're looking at the natural draft board, before all the politics and team-linking took place:  * Fultz - Consensus #1 * Ball - Consensus #2  * Jackson - Consensus #3 but was seen to have #1 potential  * Tatum - Solid #4 but closer to Fox at #5 than Jackson at #3  Tatum wasn't even a tier below Ball, he was a tier below Jackson."
For the sake of this question I think the Celtics take Josh Jackson instead of Ball.
"You have a lot of faith in guys who haven’t really accomplished anything. And you’re hoping to get a good pick so you can have a good young core? Most bad teams already have a good young core and they’re still bad. With another top 3-4 pick you would have that pick, hayes, Bey, Stewart, josh Jackson, and Sekou...... I don’t see that even as like a top 15 young core in the nba unless you get like the next superstar with that pick next year."
Josh Jackson last few seasons on the suns always popped off the last 20 games
In a weird way that 2017 pick swap kinda helped save us from ourselves cause we were really high on Josh Jackson but ended up with Fox after Jackson got taken.
"ABSOLUTELY ZERO, first preseason game, I think RJ airballed like 3 threes and I just thought to myself, o my fuck, he's the second coming of JOSH JACKSON, but boy was I wrong, everyone is talking about randle, but I think the true building piece here is RJ, I can really see him becoming like a Jimmy butler esque player, tough as hell, crafty, great defender, everything u would want from a wing basically"
Josh Jackson and Hamidou Diallo's tankinf abilities were just too much for the Magic to overcome
And Josh Jackson.
That fourth quarter by Detroit was crazy.  They kept switching on defense for no reason.  Casey didn’t take Josh Jackson out after he was so bad.  We weren’t any better it just so happens that the people we pick up from the scrap heap are bottom tier NBA players and top end g leaguers.
This game was wild.  Josh Jackson just doing awful things.  Diallo down six dribbling the clock down with thirty seconds left and bricking a long two.  Detroit switching into defense when they don’t have the players for the scheme.  Constantly picking and popping with bad shooters.  Bravo Pistons.
is josh jackson the worst non-rookie player in the whole nba? after watching this game i'd say so.
Tatum and brown weren’t easy picks... Brown was projected at 7. Kris Dunn and Dragan Bender were expected to be picked at 3. The consensus number 1 pick in 2017 was Fultz. He took a bold risk and traded down to 3 and found the best player in the draft. Tatum wasn’t even considered the third best prospect. Josh Jackson was.
probably stewart or maybe josh jackson

I'd say even 5M is probably generous, since thats what josh jackson is making in detroit despite being 4 years younger with comparable numbers and double the ppg (albeit less efficiently). but who knows these days."
"Alex Len, Josh Jackson, Marquise Chris. I have to believe McDonough just got lucky with Booker and Warren."
Josh Jackson
Yeah luckily we have Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder this year instead of Josh Jackson and Dragan Bender.
"[Pistons youth movement is genuinely exciting](https://twitter.com/RedAlternates/status/1387929113252405248?s=20):  - They have a bonafide interior threat big who covers a crazy amount of space on defense and is showing some 3pt shooting chopps in Stewart (19yo)  - They have a sharpshooting wing with great awareness and on ball D who is showing some ability to take the ball to the hoop and use his strength to finish in Bey (22yo)  - They have a stellar passing PG with incredible vision and great on-ball and help D in Killian (19yo)  - They have a raw project with Siakim-esque upside in Sekou (20yo)  - They have an athletic, sharpshooting bench sparkplug with HoF tier hair in Frank Jackson (22yo)  - And they have two athletic, multi-tool bench wings who play hard nosed defense in Josh Jackson (24yo) and Hamidou Diallo (22yo)  That's 6 players 22 or younger who could have lasting roles in Weaver's restoration (4 of whom are more or less locks) without counting Saben Lee or our 2021 pick. For context, before the moratorium lifted last fall, the only player on the team under 22yo was Sekou. Just an insane transformation in only 6 months."
"Josh Jackson has been alright in Detroit, but probably on the same level of impact as Frank."
Suns were worse with   2016 3rd overall dragan bender  2017 4th overall josh jackson
"I don’t defend josh Jackson. But I believe the baby was asleep in the crib and he was in another side of the house smoking. Not saying he’s not worthy of criticism, but it wasn’t like he was trying to get the baby high or puffing in the baby’s face"
[One addition](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/02/james-jones-suns-josh-jackson-signing-beer) that I feel was one of the lowest points:  &gt; Josh Jackson ditching a community outreach event at Fry’s to go to a friend’s birthday party a few miles away and forcing interim GM James Jones to show up to break the news and buy beer for the fans waiting.
"Goran Dragic requesting a trade. Eric Bledsoe not wanting to be here. Kieff fighting Hornacek on the bench. Drafting Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss, and Josh Jackson. Getting robbed by Trevor Ariza for $15 million. Watching Tyson Chandler rot away. Seeing Alex Len drop another pass. Yoga and layup lines with Earl Watson. Bringing 38 year old Jamal Crawford off the bench. Starting point guards Tyler Ulis, Mike James, Elfrid Payton, Tyler Johnson, Isaiah Canaan, and rookies Elie Okobo and De'Anthony Melton.    And here we are."
WHERE MY JOSH JACKSON DRAGAN BENDER MARQUISE CHRISS FELLOW SUFFERERS AT?!!! WE MADE IT TO DA PLAYOFFS BABY!!!!!!!
"Not necessarily.  Josh Jackson is a bust and he's still in the league .  Marvin Bagley , Jarrett culver, etc.  Lots of guys"
"They werent taking tatum, they were going to take josh jackson"
"That was not the opinion at the time. Jayson Tatum was the prize and the Celtics had Jaylen Brown too. Especially since Julius Randle left in free agency and was not on the team Lebron joined.  But there were many other teams. For example the Suns, who had Devin Booker and Josh Jackson. The Jazz with Donovan Mitchell and Dante Exum. The Sixers with Simmons and Fultz. Heck he could have gone to the Timberwolves and flipped KAT for Ad."
"Not until Josh Jackson skipped out on his workouts with Boston and it was clear Boston already had their eye on Tatum.  Then right before the draft people swapped Jackson and Tatum.  The original consensus order was Fultz, Ball, Jackson, Tatum. With Tatum being closer to the next tier down (eg. Fox) than #3.  You can actually see it on the draft night interviews, half of Jackson's questions were about him being skipped over by Boston."
"It's because you put the space before the period on #14 and have no space on #23 and #24, here's a fixed version   1. Luka Doncic  2. Trae Young  3. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  4. Michael Porter Jr  5. Jaren Jackson Jr  6. Colin Sexton  7. DeAndre Ayton  8. Mikal Bridges  8. DeVonte Graham  9. Gary Trent Jr  10. Mitchell Robinson  11. Miles Bridges  12. Robert Williams  13. Jalen Brunson  14.

"I see your Reggie Jackson and raise you Josh Smith.   Jackson at least had some hero moments. Smith, meanwhile, [had this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZhrwS5W2Xk&amp;ab_channel=BadBoysRewind)."
&gt;	RJ made a second-year leap  Totally possible for any of the Pistons rookies to take a similar leap.  &gt;	other guys maximizing talents  Pistons have one of the best benches in the NBA and guys like Josh Jackson and Diallo are playing better than they did in their previous spots.  I’m not saying it’s likely but it is pretty similar at the surface.
Plumlee was at a pretty decent value at 8 mil/year. Grant was 26 and entering his prime and 20 mil for that signing at this point looks like a great deal. Weaver also lowered the age of the team by signing and trading for young guys like josh Jackson and diallo  Blake was looking pretty meh last year so Blake being bad wasn’t really a shock  Also lol Killian has looked much better after coming back from injury.
"It’s possible we could make the playoffs next season but it definitely would be no higher than an 8th seed.  Weaver himself has said he’s looking at a 3yr plan, which seems like a much more likely case.  Current rookies would have another season of experience down and likely make improvements.  Jerami and, hopefully, Josh Jackson can improve their efficiency.  Multiple contracts would expire by the start of that season, we wouldn’t be paying Blake anymore either so we have more cap to work with.  It’s looking more like the 2022/2023 season is when we’d really be a solid team. It’s possible in 21/22 but a lot less a likely"
"He was who I preferred taking the year we took Fultz. He’s a streaky shooter but he does play hard on both ends and he can put the ball on the floor. I think he has the shot to eventually become a consistent shooter. He could definitely become a real solid late bloomer, he still has star upside IMO.   The main downside with Josh Jackson is he’s a knucklehead but sometimes guys wired like that mature alittle bit and become serious serious competitors, sometimes they burn out though. Could go either way at this point but I think he’s going to keep getting better."
"Bro actually watch Grant more than 4 times this season before saying he's a chucker. The man is surrounded by rookies and Josh Jackson is the second best player, teams can key on him way more."
No one is better than post asb Rookie season Josh Jackson
Post-ASB Josh Jackson is a legend lol

"Josh Jackson had Sexton cross his whole field of vision running up the court and still chose to stay fixed to Kevin Love at halfcourt, only turning as the ball passed him.  Love was already pointing up court and Jackson still didn't even turn around."
Didn't Josh Jackson get a black? It's not being counted.

"I looked up the roster changes just out of curiosity (roughly organized by minutes played)  -  **Atlanta Hawks:**  * Out: DeAndre Bembry, Damian Jones, Vince Carter, Jabari Parker, Alex Len, Allen Crabbe, Jeff Teague (not a roster subtraction but Hunter/Reddish have played less time this season due to injuries)  * In: Clint Capela, Solomon Hill, Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Tony Snell, Rondo/Lou  -  **Mavericks:**  * Out: Seth Curry, Delon Wright, Justin Jackson, JJ Barea, Courtney Lee  * In: Josh Richardson, James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, Nicolo Melli, a pu pu platter of bad rookies (Green, Bey, Terry, Hinton)  -  Amazing how the Hawks basically replaced 7 bums with ~6 genuine rotation players ranging from solid to great. The Mavs definitely downgraded, and Josh Richardson gets worse every day he's away from Miami."
"Josh Jackson  He’s from Detroit playing for Detroit, he may be a dumbass, but he’s *my* dumbass"
Josh Jackson is the missing piece
Lmao nice one  All I’m saying is those picks could be Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum or they could be Dragan Bender and Josh Jackson but right now they are nothing. You disagree?
"Unpopular opinion for most teams  Atlanta: You have to swallow your losses and pay Collins the max if you want to win anything with Trae in the foreseeable future  Boston: Both of the Jays are overrated players.  Brooklyn: KD is no longer a top 3 player, nor a top 5 player. He’s closer to Kyrie than he is to Harden.  Charlotte: even with Ball out, you should’ve traded Graham on the deadline and you made a massive mistake not trading him. The only thing that could be worse is if you resign him  Chicago: the Vucevic trade was a bad deal for you. The most unforgivable thing is that you didn’t trade Lauri. That was a chance to improve your team even more in the foreseeable future and you messed up it. AK doesn’t seem like a great GM  Cavaliers: if you get the first pick, there’s no reason to get Cade. You should trade down, and get more assets and a slightly lower pick.  Mavericks: KP has to go. A lot of other pieces have to go too. This current team will never contend around Luka until you get a reliable 2 as an all star  Nuggets: Murray should’ve been traded for Harden. You missed your opportunity, and I don’t see you winning anything.   Pistons: not much to say here, but the Diallo trade was bad. I think Josh Jackson is better and it’s not like he’s too old for your timeline at all.  Warriors: your window is up. Trade Curry, Klay, and Dray before it’s too late.  Rockets: the Harden trade was almost as bad as the first Harden trade where you got him. Your current GM seems like a massive failure so far and it’s surprising how bad he dug your team down.  Pacers: Turner needed to go tomorrow. His shot blocking doesn’t make up for his lack of an offensive game. Trade him instead of Sabonis.  Lakers: Trading for Schroeder was an awful move. Awful, awful move. Pelinka is a very overrated GM.  Grizzlies: you have a deep team, but you gotta let some of those guys go if you want to contend in the foreseeable future. The scary thing is though, I don’t believe you have a future superstar.  Heat: Pat Riley is not a good GM. Butler signing was solid but his moves since the LeBron era came and gone has solidified him at the bottom 5 of the current GMs in the league right now.  Bucks: Giannis and Middleton isn’t a good fit. Middleton’s full potential will never be capitalized at Milwaukee and that’s the truth.  Timberwolves: trade KAT, he’s gonna ask to go anyway, and your team looks worse than it did when it first came in. Build around Ant, and see how your future goes   Knicks: RJ can’t be the 2nd, or even 3rd best player on a contending team. I’m not saying let him go, but you don’t put your hopes in him.  Thunder: Poku is a scrub. He won’t be anything more than a role player for any good team  Magic: Good job on trading Vuc. Your team will bottom out for the next 5 years, and it will be a while before you guys get good again. A while.  76ers: Ben Simmons has to go. Even if it’s for a fringe all star, if you want to contend, he can’t be kept.  Suns: they’re having a solid season, but do you have a future plan after Chris Paul suffers from Father Time? Paying Ayton would be a colossally bad move  Kings: your GM sucks. Fox will ask for a trade, and your playoff drought will continue. Hali won’t start for a playoff team.  Raptors: You made a massive mistake keeping Lowry. I’ll be SHOCKED if he plays another season in a Raptors jersey after this one.  Jazz: this season distracted us, but that Gobert deal was still awful. You can’t give 42M to a player with no offensive game.  Wizards: Russ is better than Beal.  Ready for the downvotes"
"&gt;s he looked amazing but that was disregarded because “low sample size”  Because this happens every single year in the NBA all the time. Fans overreact to cherry picked sample sizes, overrate their own young prospects, are convinced ""their guy is making the leap and if you disagree it means you dont watch the games"" etc. Im not referring to you specifically just in general. People are still bringing up Cam Reddish's 20 game splits late last year as proof he'll be some kind of stud. People did this type of stuff with Andrew Wiggins everytime he had a good 3 week stretch for years. Hell even saw some of it with Josh Jackson. It's all just motivated reasoning.   &gt;He wasn’t going to be successful on a Lebron team because he’s more of a ball dominant player.   He was a very popular preseason most improved player pick for that season. Even by Lakers fans. This is hindsight bias.   &gt;for how we have something wrong with our development.  Lonzo, Ingram, Randle, Nance all these guys have magically become substantially better 3 point shooters, nonetheless players once they left LA. Even Russell from a player perspective. If it were just one example I wouldnt bring it up as anything but it's not some arbitrary isolated coincidence."

josh jackson
Really happy to see Josh Jackson balling out for you guys if only because as a secondary Grizzlies fan I really wanted Memphis to re-sign him. Also because he was pretty polarizing over in r/MemphisGrizzlies and honestly I just wanna be able to tell the doubters who didn't want him back despite the clear need for a big scoring wing who could also play defense next to Ja and JJJ that I told them so.
"If we wanted a reclamation project with upside I wish we'd gone after Josh Jackson last offseason, but no use crying over spilt milk."
I believe in josh jackson
I know it was college but at Kansas josh Jackson impressed me way more then Wiggins did and we know how much hype Wiggins had... glad to see him putting it together dudes a dog
"*Sees Pistons won*  Me (in my head): *Alright, how much did Sadiq Bey drop*  Surprisingly (suprising to me) Josh Jackson was the leading scorer"
Josh Jackson is balling
"they better, I want to buy another Suns jersey but last one I bought Josh Jackson, he was traded 6 months later. Ayton should be a Suns player for life... Arizona college player.. Suns Number 1 pick... he is a story book waiting to happen... should retire as a Sun."
"For the Pistons: Killian Hayes, Josh Jackson, Saddiq Bey, Sekou Doumbouya and Isaiah Stewart"
"&gt;while the Lakers performed some black magic to trade Pau Gasol for Kwame Brown  No, they drafted Marc Gasol in the second round, and traded him for his brother.  Any team could have done the same.  They also added a promising guard and two first round picks.  Only morons think they traded Brown for Pau.  &gt;Even before that trade, they had Andrew Bynum and Lamar Odom, who were better than anyone on the Cavs.   Los Angeles drafted Bynum at #10.  The previous year, Cleveland had the #10 pick but selected Luke Jackson -- and passed on; Al Jefferson, Josh Smith, Jameer Nelson and others.  Vive la difference."
"Can’t be an r/nba thread without at least one dumb comment. Didn’t know that we were expecting 20 year olds to drag lineups made up of Tyler Ulis, Josh Jackson, Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss, Tyson Chandler’s corpse, washed Jamal Crawford, and Mike James to the playoffs. Crazy what happens when you finally put a team of NBA players around him."
The draft gods saved Vlade from his own incompetence in 2017.  I don’t even think he would’ve drafted Fox if we kept the #3 spot.  Fultz/Josh Jackson could’ve been our franchise player.
You may find this amusing:  https://valleyofthesuns.com/2018/02/24/josh-jackson-has-already-surpassed-jayson-tatum/
"That is so bad. I really did not like Jackson, so glad we avoided that mess. I wanted Tatum so bad before the draft after I watched this [dumb video of him in armour. ](https://youtu.be/t9xwxoLcKZs)  Serious about that, I loved that he wasn’t too cool to do a dumb goofy stunt. Like he wasn’t trying to be this big Duke badass. Josh Jackson seemed like the opposite of that attitude, he was just too aggro to do a dumb thing like this.   Also, videos [like this also helped my early fandom. ](https://youtu.be/gjyN-aGHr2o)"
Fun fact: current Piston Josh Jackson was actually at the Malice at the Palace when he was 7 and he threw a water bottle at the Pacers
People were expecting us to draft Kris Dunn in 2016 and Josh Jackson in 2017. Imagine if we'd actually done that... yikes.
I feel worse about passing on Fox for Josh Jackson or even Haliburton for Jalen Smith. I think Ayton is really good and going to be even better.
the Josh Jackson stan has logged on
Josh Jackson 🤦🏿‍♂️ I just KNEW he was gonna be a star lol
Josh Jackson
"Mikal is so dope. I was always a 20 year old raw player &gt; experienced college guy but after seeing how impactful Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson have been from day 1 compared to Jalen Smith, Josh Jackson and Dragan Bender, I’m definitely going to value experience a lot more."
"A lot of Arizona fans followed him in high school including me so I can understand the hype. Before he reclassed to the 2018 draft class he was the number 1 prospect in the 2019 NBA class ahead of Zion and RJ Barret. I know this is high school but this just demonstrates a little bit how dominant he was in high school. He then went to Duke and put up 21/11 season as a freshmen with 65% TS. I thought he would be the JJ Watt of the NBA in that he was really athletic and had a freak motor. But then again, I thought the same thing about Josh Jackson."
"Because there were other players with much better stats. Only two QBs are named to All-Pro teams, and when you have the likes of Rodgers, Mahomes, Brady, Jackson, and Josh Allen among others, making the team is pretty hard. It’s a shitty metric to compare. If Josh Allen were a rookie, are you saying he shouldn’t have won ROY over Justin Jefferson because he wasn’t All-Pro?"
I'm sorry you drafted Josh Jackson.  Keep your bias out of it.
Josh Jackson tanked his relationship with the Celtics to go to Phoenix. We coulda had Tatum 😭
"The draft gods saved us from ourselves if you ask me. At #3 we probably would’ve drafted Fultz or Josh Jackson rather than Fox.  Imagine Fultz, Buddy, Bagley, WCS and random vet as our core while having a #2 and #3 pick."
"Yeah and it only took him five years and a WCF berth to prove that maybe his talent was worth evaluating in a vacuum and not holding Ulis/Jordan Mickey/Canaan/Mike Jones/Dragan Bender/Jordan McCrae/Jimmer Fredette/Marquese Chriss/Jamal Crawford/Alan Williams/Alec Peters/Josh Jackson/Elie Okobo/Sonny Weems/Davon Reed/Jarel Eddie/Eric Moreland and dozens more of other's limitations against him.  Props for coming around, I guess."
[Here’s the allegation.](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2019/06/20/josh-jackson-phoenix-suns-accused-getting-infant-high/1512377001/) I also thought it was interesting the baby mama is 43 years old
"I will maintain to the day I die that anyone who had Booker as an empty stats guy in 2019 is a joke and should not be listened to about anything NBA.   He put up 27/5/7 on 62% True Shooting with a rotating cast of starters, featuring such stars as: TJ Warren, De'Anthony Melton, Josh Jackson, Dragan Bender, Elie Okobo, Isaiah Cannon, Tyler Johnson, and Kelly Oubre; each of those guys all started more than 10 games that season. Outside of Booker the only other consistent starters were a Rookie Ayton and Rookie Mikal. Warren and Oubre are probably the only two on that list who had any business being on an NBA team.  Booker saw the most double and triple teams out of anyone in the league and was cooking them with ease. Scoring that much, that efficiently is made so much harder when you have no other players on your team."
"Josh Jackson.  The guy has crazy skills, especially offensively, but plays like a fucking trainwreck."
"Suns draft josh Jackson, Alex Len and dragon bender top 5, finally make the playoffs and don’t know how to act"
&gt;Josh Jackson stranded on a Detroit Piston bench somewhere.  FTFY
Josh Jackson in shambles... on a bench somewhere.
josh jackson could find a role imo
Josh Jackson during the end of rookie season after the Suns sat out everyone else and were taking. He was averaging 18.7/2.5/4.4 with 1.6 steals a game post all star break.
"The thing is, with Booker, is that I don't think he *saw* the flow of the offense. There would be good ways to move the ball, and good reasons not to attack, and he'd just put his head down anyway.   Yes, his situation has improved. But I think if you transplanted three-years-ago Booker on to this team, he wouldn't be as effective. His head is up much more, now, he's more responsive to what the defense is doing.   ""He had to dominate every possession otherwise it's Josh Jackson taking 10 3s a game"" is a straw man. The choice isn't between ""Player A dominates the ball or player B shoots whenever he wants and dominates the ball himself."" A guy like Josh Jackson is likely to be much more effective when part of a functioning, fluid offense."
"&gt;There are guys who put up great numbers in a way that has much lower impact than you'd like. I'd say like, Booker, three years ago, was a great example of that. He just had his head down all the time, totally dominated the ball. He still occasionally goes through stretches like that but his willingness to get points through the flow of the offense makes the points he scores contribute more towards winning.  I mean, he had to do that 3 years ago. Look at the guys he was playing with. If he tried to go through the flow of the offense back then it would mean Josh Jackson taking 10 3's a game."
"Plumlee, Josh Jackson, and two 2nds probably gets it done"

"Welcome to r/nba. I love when people speak with hindsight 20/202 lens. For what it's worth.  I had: 1. Fultz  2. Josh Jackson 3. Ball  4. Fox 5. Tatum 6. Monk 7. DSJ 8. Og/Bam 9. BAM/Og 10. Don  Don &amp; Bam were close to where I thought they should be but when OG dropped to us at 23, I was shocked (even given his injury concerns). I never understood the hype around Frank because his shooting worried me in what I saw of him online."
"Yeah how dare Booker not win championships with Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss and Josh Jackson as three of his starters  What a bum"
"This is a great point. It makes me wonder about other guys who fit this mold; pretty good at everything, but not great at anything. Never an all star, but in his prime, had the potential to be one. A few that come to mind-    - Josh Smith  - [The L Train] (https://youtu.be/ecdAAdNfwyo)  - Nic Batum  - Boris Diaw, I suppose  - Mychal Thompson  - Rudy Gay  - Jim Jackson managed to be that guy for like half the teams in the league.   - Maybe Larry Hughes and Kendall Gill too.   I refuse to include Lamar Odom on this list because he 100% deserved to be an all star. He was a decade ahead of his time and was the greatest ever at everything. Forever."
"Yeah, for example over the past few years anytime Booker was out, the game simply wasn't worth watching imo...though it's kinda hilarious that now I remember this actually not being the case at one point, because I was excited to watch *Josh Jackson* play."
"I can't stand paul, crowder, or booker but i'm happy for Sun fans. Anyone that lived through players like Josh Jackson deserve it lol.   then again, id be happy for Nugget fans too."
So watching Josh Jackson and Dragan bender was worth it
Source on this? I can’t believe a world where a GM thought Josh Jackson was going to be better than Tatum after his rookie year. Or am I misinterpreting?
Whatever happened to Josh Jackson?
Wasn't Josh Jackson supposed to go to a workout for the Celtics and then no-showed there as well? Something like that.
Remember when Josh Jackson got his baby daughter high on marihuana? yeah those times
To be fair Josh Jackson convinced even the GMs of the league. The GM survey coming into his 2nd year had him as the best player in his draft class in 5 years.
Dragan Bender and Josh Jackson were both selected 4th overall in 2016 and 2017. That’s about all I remember them for lol.
Josh Jackson and Dragan Bender. Those are names I haven't heard in years.
Two and a half years ago he was buying beers for fans after Josh Jackson was a no show for a meet and greet. Now his team is a game away from the WCF after a 10 year drought. He deserves it.
Yo wtf. Where is Josh Jackson now? He was a top 5 pick right?
Man I had convinced myself Josh Jackson was the guy. I thought he was going to be what Mikal actually is. Depressing days that make this year all the sweeter.
"This feeling is what I watched all those minutes of Dragan Bender, Tyler Ulis, and Josh Jackson for."
"Wow so much to say  1) The most vibrant outfit is Devonte Graham dressed all in black wearing a bright  puffy vest...how is that the most vibrant outfit in the NBA? I see fucking middle aged suburban women rocking that shit daily  2) The freshest pregame outfit is Blake Griffin in a pair of sweat shorts with a black long sleve shirt and some Joradans on. Meanwhile Deni Avdija's worst outfit is...shorts and a t-shirt with a pair of white sneakers. So apparently the voters in this poll are both impressed and offended by the most basic shit you can wear pregame? Talk about schizophrenic.  3) Meanwhile one of the hardest to pull off outfits is...Deandre Ayton in...a denim jacket and jeans with a black shirt. Dudes come on that shit is so basic how can you not pull that off.  Or Cedi Osman in...a white jacket with a hoodie and skinny jeans. Like what?  4) Apparently LeBron James wearing a denim jacket and black jeans is...edgy? Ummm ok. Seems pretty basic to me.   5) Back to vibrancy. Josh Jackson is the most vibrant in the NBA rocking....a flannel shirt, beanie, black tee and black skinny jeans. Have these people ever been to Portland or Seattle or Brooklyn? Or like..any rural area? Jeans, tee, flannel and beanie isn't vibrant it's fucking basic fall clothing. Also apparently just wearing a bright hoodie with black pants makes you vibrant?   I gotta stop now but this shit is wack dudes."
I think Josh Jackson has a similar BBIQ to Giannis tbh
"I'm not so sure. The Suns didn't seem inclined to invest very heavily into Stixx this year. Saric was injured a good deal this year and he still played more than 5 times as many minutes as Stixx (Jalen Smith had the third fewest minutes logged out of anyone on the team and was healthy all season).   It seems like the Suns are trying to avoid the mistakes of previous Suns teams in how we heavily invested in our first round draft picks despite poor play: Dragan Bender, Marquis Chriss, Alex Len, Josh Jackson. Since Monty and James Jones have taken over they've prioritized the current value of a player over their potential as a lot of time has been wasted hoping for players to develop.   I could be wrong, It's entirely possible the organization sees Stixx growing into a productive player but he hasn't shown much thus far."
"This city will be diehards if our teams are even 8 seeds. We are realistic though. The Josh Jackson, Alex Len Suns didn’t give us much to cheer about outside of Booker. This is a Suns town, they just need to give us something to look forward to."
"Josh Jackson. It's kinda sad that everyone being mentioned,  except Marcus Morris, were suns 1st round picks.  Bender, Chriss,  Len, Jackson , Markieff Morris. All first rounders"
"So if a player can't win championships with Marquese Chriss, Dragan Bender and Josh Jackson as three of his starters he sucks?  I guess MJ isn't great either because he never won with a team that terrible"
"My friend was a valet at a really nice steakhouse in phoenix, Josh Jackson rolled up in a pimped out car that reeked of marijuana and didn't leave a tip lol."
Remember when the Suns drafted Josh Jackson?
"Josh Jackson, for parts of the season, looks legit. His efficiency is poor for the most part but he puts up solid numbers when given a run."
"I’m a big KU fan, so I love watching their alumni in the NBA—Embiid, Josh Jackson, Graham, etc"
"I saw a lot of trade down options but even those were going to be rough. I saw a lot of a lower pick and Trey Lyes, Frank Kaminsky, Josh Jackson, and Markennen (hind sight this would of been okay).   Signed Lamar Odom..... WHO WAS ON CRACK.   Traded away Jr Smith, Shumpert, and Tyson Chandler for peanuts. We did not get any value in return, only the tank commander Lance Thomas. Tyson went on to have a resurgent year while Jr and shump were key parts to the Cavs championship win.  Drafted Frank: I love and support Frank but after 4 seasons, he’s failed to live up to any expectations. I still think he needs more opportunity as he showed flashes but the general consensus is that he was a bad pick.   Hired Derrick Fisher and Hornacek while forcing them to implement the Triangle offense. I don’t think I need this mess.   Signed Joahkim Noah and Courtney Lee to 4 year deals: Lee was an average role player getting big money and Noah was a corpse of himself. We are still paying Noah....  Ruined Melo’s last years: this is more the organization as a whole but Melo stayed committed to NY but they still failed to bring him any real change of winning after the 2013 season."

"I can't agree with this more.   I'll use Detroit as an example since that's one of the two teams I follow closest.   Between 2008 and 2015, we literally had seven different coaches.   That's an average of one per year.  That was the end of the 'contending' phase and the first five year of the rebuild.  Since the rebuild began, we had a lot of solid young talent come in and brought in some free agents. We had Chris Middleton, and Greg Monroe, and Andre Drummond and Josh Smith. Brandon Jennings. Tobias Harris. Morris. Caldwell-Pope. Reggie Jackson. Kennard.  Ilyasova.    I'm certainly not making a case that any combination of those guys was going to be winning a championship.  But when young guys like Middleton, Harris, Drummond, and Monroe come in, and show some real potential, but then they get jerked around form one coach to another. One coach has Monroe run plays (effectively) out of the post, the next give Jennings the ball without (big mistake), it just established this turnstile of losing.  Young guys just trying to get there to get a pay day. No cohesion.   That's why I appreciate that teams like the Sixers, even though they got rid of Brett Brown, took the time to bring a player development guy in and just gave him 5 or 6 years without question."
Josh Jackson needs help🤔
"It's silly that Detroit fans here like him, but Detroit fans are stupidly optimistic about every dirty penny we pick up.    He wasn't actually good for us, just like Josh Jackson wasn't particularly good for us.  He had a few good moments.  He also had a bunch of bad ones.  And people think his defense was good because he would get a bunch of steals, but he was getting steals because he played risky defense and gambled a ton.    He was starting to slip from the lineup even before he got injured, but as I said, Pistons fans become hyper focused on every dirty penny we pick up and think it might be a silver dollar."
"There are 4 types of mavs fans in our sub : old head mavs fans, new mavs fans coz we lookin good rn, Luka stans, and KP stans  Can be split up by questioning about Josh Howard, Charlie Villanueva, Yogi Ferrell, AJ Hammons, and Pierre Jackson"
"It may not be horrible but it isn't necessarily good either. No matter how bad a team is, they are going to get at least 90 points and 40 rebounds so those volume stats gotta go to someone. Remember Josh Jackson's rookie year where Suns pretty much rested everyone else, Jackson put up 18.7/2.5/5.9 with 1.6 steals?"
"THJ, Richardson, Powell, Kleber, Brunson, Burke (KP too?)  Batum, Jackson, Mann, Kennard, Marcus Morris  **Clippers had 5 different rotation players that played better than ANY of those six Mavs rotation players**.   Shit, you could argue KP as well, but I don't know, not what you want from a 2nd option, but I'm not sure you can put him in that list. He played 42 minutes, efficient 16/11, played some decent D and had some nice steals.  The Mavs 2nd best player was DFS or Boban.  Is anything I said untrue? If not, what the fuck man. This Mavs team is such a disaster. What a waste of one of the better series we've seen a star play.  Kawhi stepped up to combat Luka's carry-job, but just wow. The Mavs are straight trash outside of Luka.   The Josh Richardson trade is a joke. People said it's a ""downgrade"", but that undersells it. A downgrade would be a slightly worse 3pt shooter. He's not a downgrade, he's a straight-up useless roster spot. Sucks a big cock on offense and not even that good on defense.  Sucks that we don't get to watch Luka, but the playoffs this year has some great 2nd round series. Suns vs Nugs, Clips vs Jazz, Nets vs Bucks, 76ers vs Hawks. Maybe the best set of conference semifinals from top to bottom in my 20-25 years watching, at least that I can remember."
"Ngl, there was no hope for me with that pick. Josh Jackson tho 😫"
I LIVED THROUGH JOSH JACKSON AND DRAGON BENDER FOR THIS SHIT
"He was just as efficient during the bad years, especially the last couple. He also averaged 7 assists with a team who’s best shooter on any given night was probably Josh Jackson outside of Booker. It was just really, really ugly team building."
Portland would hang up immediately at the thought of Josh Jackson lmfao
Kyle Kuzma = Josh Jackson
"The signing and use of DJJ is still confusing.  We're paying in 9 million and gave him a player option to not use him for more than 10 minutes these playoffs.  Barely used him leading up to the playoffs.  We shoulda gone after Josh Jackson or anybody else really, wasted the whole MLE on the guy."
"He’s a tough guy to trade since he’s not consistent. He’s shown flashes but he doesn’t really have player identity. There’s a small market for him since he’s still young and other lakers have thrived on new teams. I could see kuzma for Malik monk, josh Jackson, reddish."
The hopeful feeling I got when the GM survey indicated that Josh Jackson is who they believed would be the best player in his draft class in 5 years.
I'll give you a lightly used Josh Jackson
And you'd do the same for Josh Jackson so pipe down loser
Forgot Josh Jackson there haha
"If I think a player is going to be good it's pretty certain they're going to be terrible lol. I was all in on Josh Jackson, Bagley, and I thought Gordon would be an all-star. Gordon isn't terrible but he didn't quite become the player I thought he would."
Josh Allen Lamar Jackson? Those guys are the opposite of boring and will probably be stars in the league for the next decade
"He a good guy, will never see him as a villain. Villains are Draymond, Pat Bev, Butler, Ariza, Josh Jackson.. these dudes just use the term villain just to look cool, fr."
Remember when everyone was losing their minds they didn't take Josh Jackson lol
"Fultz was the consensus number 1 at the time and most people had Josh Jackson over Tatum on their draft boards as well. Most people had Lonzo in their top 3 but Magic didn't even try to hide that they were picking him at 2. From what I understand Phoenix had Josh Jackson over Tatum too so we could have traded down even farther possibly and still gotten him.  No less than 20 teams would have taken Fultz if they had the first pick, probably closer to 25."
The beginning of 2017-2018. We just picked josh Jackson who looked like he was going to be a stud in the nba. Booker was really getting better. We had hopes of getting better after years of high lottery picks.  We lost the first game of the year to Portland AT HOME by 50. Lost our second game. And the third game we lost by over 40. We fired our coach 3 games into the season and ended up with a worst record than the year before

"I think it is mostly on the player. It is super rare where a player busts on one team and then goes to another team who was able to unlock their hidden potential that the previous team wasn't able. Many of these draft busts are let go even when they are in their early 20's or even like 21 years old so they have plenty of time to develop with other teams. Dragan Bender, Josh Jackson, Derrick Williams, Anthony Bennett, Jahlil Okafor, etc these guys were all young when they switched teams and the new team wasn't able to get much more of them. The fact that is just so rare that this happens and the best examples people can come up with are Josh Jackson putting up slightly better numbers than his rookie year and unable to start on the worst team in the east, or Wiggins shooting better when he is with the insane gravity of Curry. It is so rare infact, I can't even think of a single example where a player is determined to be a bust, switches team, then lives up anywhere close to their predraft hype. Only example that kind of fits is Tobias Harris, and he was a middle of the first round draft pick and just got more minutes on a new team."
"If they hadn't made that trade they could've kept Josh Jackson, who was coming into his own off the bench and provided some much needed scoring pop and athleticism on the wing"
"Man he would've been perfect. Also, trading for Justise meant the Grizzlies had to let go of Josh Jackson, who also would have been perfect for them this season"
"I respect your opinion but definitely disagree. Sure it would be better for college hoops if A-list players still wanted to play 4 years, but I think the sport is still intriguing and fun to watch even with a couple of the big powers (Duke and Kentucky primarily) being 1&amp;Done factories. I would certainly disagree that the NCAA hasn’t been “relevant” in decades, I’d say as recently as 2019 with Zion the NCAA was immensely relevant. Duke was all over SportsCenter and everywhere else. Plenty of good college teams are still built on the backs of numerous 4-year players. This year’s champ, Baylor, was an absolutely incredible squad that shot over 40% from deep *as a team* and featured 6 upperclassmen among their most prominent ~8 players, and no freshmen. I personally am a Kansas fan and though we’ve sent some 1&amp;Dones to the league (Josh Selby, Xavier Henry, Ben McLemore, Andrew Wiggins, Joel Embiid, Kelly Oubre, Josh Jackson come to mind), most of our actual best players over that time frame have been 3-4 year guys like Sherron Collins, Cole Aldrich, Thomas Robinson, Tyshawn Taylor, Perry Ellis, Devonte’ Graham, and Frank Mason. Idk, it probably helps that I grew up a fan of a blue blood, but I love college hoops. I think if anything, what threatens the quality of the sport long-term is the newly relaxed transfer rules. I also have a hard time knocking them though because the kids deserve flexibility, but that will definitely threaten team continuity more than the 1&amp;Done trend."
"If they hold onto him and he doesn't look any better next season, his trade value will Josh Jackson and Marquese Chriss level"
"&gt;He can still bring something in return because of his age and draft position, but it won't be anywhere near the value of the #2 pick itself.  Yeah, though I don't think it'll be *that* much lower.  His season has been disappointing, but he's shown good potential and he's still just 19.  I'm sure there are a couple front offices out there who think he can be moulded into a cornerstone.    Point is I do think he'd still bring in positive trade value.    &gt;The NBA is full of high draft picks who are still riding off potential (Josh Jackson, Bagley, Chriss)  No need to tell me that, I'm a Jazz fan who rode the Exum hype train til we traded the guy lol"
"He can still bring something in return because of his age and draft position, but it won't be anywhere near the value of the #2 pick itself. The NBA is full of high draft picks who are still riding off potential (Josh Jackson, Bagley, Chriss), though it seems like teams have been quicker to cut ties and just accept that it didn't work out. A Bamba or Bagley seems like comparable value to Wiseman at this point."
"You're comparing him to Josh Jackson? Yes, of course he's gonna look a lot better. As of Re-engaging the fanbase - what if I told you that fans have absolutely no effect on how the team performs? Did the Suns have fans in the bubble or for most of this season? Oubre Jr is a low IQ, tunnel-vision, flash-no-substance type of player. Did he get along with the locker-room? Yes, he did. Did that translate to more wins while he was on the floor? I don't think so."
"I disagree, man. I don't think it's all so cut and dry. Obviously, we're a better team with Mikal and Cam taking over at the wing and the CP3 trade was a no-brainer in hindsight, but Kelly absolutely established himself early on during his time in Phoenix. As someone who has directly interfaced with him and other former Suns like Josh Jackson, I can tell you that the difference was palpable.   Re-engaging the fanbase is a part of helping to establish a winning culture and that's exactly what Oubre did during his time in Phoenix."
Josh Jackson was having tooth surgery man... cmon. I think that’s an acceptable reason to sit.
Suns fans said the exact same things about Josh Jackson through 2 years. He similarly had an amazing stretch to close his rookie year.
"Are we pretending that Presti isn’t about to do the same thing next season? He’s set up for at least a few years of tanking with those picks.   This is about market size. It always has been. The league needed our revenue and the optics of a major team like us doing it pissed other owners off.   And if we are talking equal outcome, the Wolves are shit literally every year. What’s the difference? We broke no rules.   And frankly in a year where multiple teams blatantly sat healthy players and made up fake injuries (Josh Jackson — Tooth) we never sat anyone. And our tank was extended in part because we drafted injured players (Embiid) and players who immediately got injured (Simmons).   People forget all this started after a time where we did try to go for it. We had Jrue, Turner, Young and had just acquired Bynum.   But then bowling. People forget the circumstances."
"here's our on/off stats for some reason, we actually get better when [CamJohnson is off the floor](https://www.nba.com/stats/team/1610612756/onoffcourt-traditional)  many on our sub overrates CamJo, most even think [CamJohnson&gt;DuncanRobinson](https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=johnsca02&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;player_id2=robindu01&amp;p2yrfrom=2021)   it's not as if he is a really amazing shooter he is 34.9 on 3pt% , just on a slump? even when you compare the previous season Duncan still comes on top as a shooter.  he's ok but out of the people that is an odd man out when time comes we need a player to add in a trade to acquire someone, he's going to be one unless you wanted it to be crowder instead.  a mix of 2-4 players on the tradable list would be enough to get us a bigman for our bench, which we still really need.  Let's be real Jalen Smith will not develop unless we actually use him, and we don't use him at all, how can he develop if we won't even play him, he even struggled in g-league. Just because he was picked 10th you'll get something in return. Josh Jackson was 4th, it wasn't for an all-star trade outright."
Ja - jaren - Jonas - josh Jackson - jae
"As a Pistons fan I can there's definite flaws here  Detroit has Bey, Stew, and Killian who are rookie 1st rounders. Josh Jackson is a project. I also dont know if you included Blake Griffin or not  We didnt underachieve at all. We were supposed to be bad this season"
"Josh Jackson, Kris Dunn, Dennis Smith Jr  Maybe not superstars but I thought they’d all be at least all star level"
"Ouch, we already calling Josh Jackson washed up?"
Josh Jackson
"Pistons is being totally skewed by us bringing in “washed-up” guys who had been drafted high (Josh Jackson, Okafor, DSJr) plus our 3 first round rookies."
When did Josh Jackson ever have a half season stretch where he puts up 24 a game on 57% true shooting.  Or anything close to that
"Josh Jackson was who I wanted in that draft, there's a reason we're not running NBA teams"
I remember when we convinced ourselves we would rather have josh Jackson anyways. RIP suns fans
"True. I was screaming for us to take Murray though. Suns fans at the time were like ""BuT wE aLrEaDy HaVe BoOkEr!""  Suns have been notorious for being fair weather but we definitely have some serious homers. I did nothing but talk shit about Chriss, Bender, Len, Josh Jackson, et al., and was always surprised at how many of our fans would get upset with me and argue in their defense.  Same shit is happening now with Jalen Smith, even though the dude looks like a scrub pick just like most of our other picks. Whenever I complain and wish we drafted Haliburton or Saddiq Bey, they jump down my throat and say, ""GiVE hIm TiMe!""  Because lots of guys that sucks as much ass as he has this year, turned their careers around and became good players? He has put up historically terrible stats, he sucks."
Josh Jackson: Am i a joke to you?
"fwiw, Josh Jackson is ok now. Not  #4 pick worthy, but decent."
"The draft is a crapshoot but he shot over 45% from 3 and over 85% from FT his last two college seasons. If you're talking about his volume not being high enough, I think you need to look at the context. He was always among the top 2/3 in 3pa on his team and never far behind their 3pt specialist Ethan Wragge. Also, not many teams in college basketball would be shooting that many 3s. It was, and still is, pretty rare to see a player shooting over 6 or 7 a game.  He's obviously not elite but he's definitely a 3pt specialist in the NBA. He's shot around 40 for pretty much his whole career. His biggest problem has always been his defense since he's small and slow and not strong.  Then you got Josh Jackson. He was a top 5 lock because of he was a top prep prospect who performed well in college. The biggest thing scouts were looking at was his potential. You can't teach his size and elite athleticism. He also showed some ball handling potential and passing potential as a wing slasher. Those are skills that they were thinking would translate. No one thought he could shoot. He shot 35% from 3 in college which isn't bad but on 2 attempts and shot an abysmal from the FT line. Scouts were thinking he had Iguodala jack of all trades 2 way potential, while hoping for more. They're not looking at his raw stats or production. They're looking at skills that they think will translate"

"Suns had a bunch of top five picks but only hit on one of them (Ayton). Huge misses on Bender (4) and Josh Jackson (4).  Also Chriss (8)  Booker, Cam Johnson, and Bridges all came outside the top 10."
"I fucking love Monty, DA, and Mikal. Torrey Craig is one of my new loves, too.  Book is a fucking great guy too, even though I know he gets on a lot of people's nerves on the court. He does so much for the community and is a huge advocate for kids on the spectrum.  CP3 is also a pretty standup guy though I know he certainly also irks people on the court also, but he does a lot of excellent charity work whether it be gathering events where all proceeds go to charity, his involvement with the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs across America, build courts throughout poorer parts of New Orleans, and recently working towards the Social Change foundation to tear down discriminatory barriers.  I love this team. It's a longshot from our recent years between Josh Jackson and the Morris brothers."
"Same reason guys like okoro, hunter, josh Jackson and Tatum go so high, everyone is looking for a great 2-way wing and they are willing to take chances on high upside guys early on the draft"
"Some pretty good takes  &gt; Raptors don't do a complete rebuild from year three, but they do a retool and successfully pull off a trade for a super star.  &gt; Jerry West successfully gets the Clippers to the Western Conference finals.   &gt; Paul George left OKC.  &gt; The Timberwolves and Suns are the two favorites in the West.   Well that was half right.  &gt; The Nets are a major contender in year four and five of this timeline.  &gt; Clippers make the WCF without CP3  &gt; Rudy Gobert wins 3 DPOYs  But also some really bad takes....  &gt; Embiid isn't a starter, always injured.  &gt; Seattle has an NBA basketball team again.   &gt; The best rookie will be Josh Jackson.  &gt; Wolves win a title  &gt; lonzo considered top 10 player in league."
"If it makes you feel any better, the Suns drafted Dragan Bender (4), Marquese Chriss (8), Josh Jackson (4) in back-to-back drafts just 4-5 years ago."
"Delon Wright was traded at the deadline,  the likely starting lineup will be  Hayes Cunningham Bey Grant Stewart   with a mix off the bench of: mason plumlee, saben lee, josh/frank jackson, and a likely late first rounder as the pistons will probably try to trade back up with their 3 seconds"
That's a nice core around Josh Jackson you mean
"Being a fan of a tanking team lets you collect a lot of shit takes about your young talent due to cope.  I had way too much faith in Josh Jackson/Marquese Chriss/Tyler Ulis/Elie Okobo/Alec Fucking Peters.  I also believed that a lineup of Isiah Canaan/Booker/Ariza/Ryan Anderson/Rookie Ayton would be a semi competitive lineup that was more enjoyable than lineups from previous years.  I was wrong, I would rather watch Dragan Bender put up 5 points on 2-6 versus Isiah Canaan and Ryan Anderson trying to play basketball in 2018."
That I can agree to. But your saying that luka is just like every other talented guard. Plus they drafted other talented big men that haven’t worked out. I am sure bender and Chriss were fit picks because they already drafted booker. They drafted josh Jackson because he was projected to be a great fit with booker.   Sometimes fit doesn’t work as well.
"Yeah I remember too, we would have given up Josh Jackson for Irving if I remember correctly"

"They definitely won’t make it within the next season or two, but they can (obviously) make some decisions to help themselves in the long term.   - Fire Luke Walton and look into a young assistant that will let Fox and Hali play faster   - Keep that backcourt together by any means possible  - Get an athletic rim-running center (In the Capela mold) if Holmes doesn’t come back  - Look into trading Barnes, Hield, and Bagley. Barnes, although a very solid player, doesn’t really fit the timeline. Hield is already 28 and might stunt Halliburton’s growth. And Bagley is toxic and should be traded just for the locker-room’s sake.   - Take Corey Kispert at 9. Might be looked at as a reach, but he’s a Joe Harris type of player that will provide elite spacing for those guards to operate.   - Take fliers on young players similar to Detroit with Josh Jackson and DSJ last year. There’s nothing to lose, and they might find a diamond in the rough."
"That doesn’t really explain much, we hit on Fox and Haliburton and the Suns spent the 4th and 8th picks on Dargan Bender and Marquese Chriss in 2016, and then the 4th pick on Josh Jackson in 2017. The real difference is that since then, the Suns drafted Ayton and Bridges in 2018, then Cam Johnson in 2019, and then signed Cam Payne to a small deal and he is way exceeding his expectations. They took a risk on their young core, including the non-star level young guys, being enough to pair with CP3 and some role playing vets at the right time, and it’s paid off massively. They are deeper and have a mix of all stars, young role players and vet role players, all possible because of patience making sure not to muddy the contract situation so that they could trade for CP3.    The Kings have some steps toward that core, but we are stuck in the mud with our contract situation. We had to let Bogi walk because we have so much money wrapped up in Buddy and Barnes, so our previous gm put our current gm in a situation in which we need to unload guys before we can really take significant steps forward. Moving Buddy and a few other guys that don’t fit will be our next big steps, but it likely won’t feel successful either. We are some years behind where we need to be in order to have an opportunity like the Suns."
"Ehh. The first that Philly gave up ended up not being as valuable as it could've been (#14 is a pretty shitty outcome for a barely-protected pick from the friggin' *Kings*), and there's no guarantee the Sixers would have picked Tatum at #3— there's a decent chance the Celtics still would have taken Tatum #1, and even if they hadn't, the Sixers easily could have picked Josh Jackson over him as well."
*Josh Jackson has entered the chat
"What are you struggling with bro? Ingram came into the league being compared to KD, Tatum came into the league with question marks…Ingram’s only real question mark was if he could fill out his body more. Shit, there were people that thought Josh Jackson was a better prospect than Tatum and 4 years later that opinion by *scouts* looks atrocious."
"No you wouldn’t.  And guys in the G-League have routinely been in and out of the NBA. They are all NCAA All-Stars. Way higher level of competition.   Yeah, so if his question mark is his team defence, than it makes sense considering his team also was poor with their defensive ability/IQ.   Well he is at best the 5th pick, so the consensus on him is more that he is in the 5-8 range.   And he definitely would have been, NCAA is a weak league. It’s easy to shine there, look at Josh Jackson who is basically a less athletic version of Kuminga."
I wouldn’t put lack of progression as a main point of contention.   He had a 2 month season? How much do you think a player can improve in 2 months?   But yeah he could become a Josh Jackson type. I’m surprised Jackson hasn’t carved out a role on a bad team yet:
"I think a lot of my worries for him is that his ability did not get better as the season went along. He peaked in his first two games, and then progressively got worse as the season went along, and had a lot kid trouble generating easy shots off the dribble, at the rim or anywhere else. He does have a lot of Jeff green on him, and also a more above the rim josh Jackson, both good ball handlers"
I remembered tatum was project near 5 behind josh jackson and fox
"Context matters.   Ingram’s team had Zion as the leading scorer with 27PPG to Ingram’s 23.8.  The next leading scorer on the Pistons after Grant’s 22.3 was Derrick Rose with 14.2 before he left, and then Josh Jackson with 13.4."
"14-15 season sits with me for the false hope.  SVG came in and waived Josh Smith in like December.  Brandon Jennings then leads us to a very nice run (I think we won 7 in a row at some point). He was looking like a potential all star and the team was actually looking like we could sneak into the playoffs. Then he goes down like early-mid feb, our season basically was over.  Pretty much happened again in 16-17 when Reggie Jackson went down I think late Nov-early december. Think we were 3rd or 4th in the East and we immediately became ass again cause of injuries to other players as well.  Been a hard decade as a pistons fan. Blake Griffin carried our sorry asses to the playoffs and he had to miss all but the final game of that sweep if I remember right. Then he was never the same again as a first option"
He always had random head injuries he could never heal from. He was always a beast offensively but his off ball defense was so abysmal he'd give up just as much as he scored. Once we got rid of PJ Tucker we were in a tough pickle on replacing his wing defense production and tried to draft Josh Jackson and sign Trevor Ariza and trade for Kelly Oubre to plug that hole and nothing really worked until we gave Mikal Bridges the minutes he deserved.
"Suns drafting has been horrible lol fym  Ever heard of Josh Jackson, Dragan Bender, or Marquesse Chriss?  The only one they got right was Booker and Bridges.  Ayton was the consensus number 1 pick."
"Props to /u/thomki for seeing past the jokes and memes.   &gt;I mean, meme the suns all you want but Saric is at least he is an established nba player who can score in the paint, shoot, and get boards.  &gt;Johnson can make 3s at a high clip and defend.  &gt;The suns are so freaking bad cuz they kept taking project type players like Josh Jackson and Bender high in the draft. They need solid role players around booker to start winning games, not more 19 year old projects  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c33uwo/2019_nba_draft_11_pick_cameron_johnson_north/eropejk/"
"Yeah but they had to miss on several guys to get there like Josh Jackson, Dragan Bender, and Marquess Chriss among others."
Dragan Bender and Josh Jackson died for this.
"- What if the refs call the foul on Reggie Jackson, which wouldn't have led to a crucial Matt Barnes turnover (2014 vs OKC) ? - What if Josh Smith &amp; Corey Brewer don't go berserk for 3 with Harden on the bench? (2015 vs Rockets)"
"Man, I really wish that Josh Jackson panned out for us. Think he has a world of talent and just doesn’t know how to put it together. You guys have a few good pieces and moving on from Blake was critical. Now to hopefully find 1 or 2 more players. Suns didn’t really change until we changed our GM. James Jones changed our culture drastically. No longer trying to take flyers on potential high ceiling low floor guys and bringing in people who are willing to grind."
Good post OP. Crazy to see it like this.   It makes me feel a lot better about the Josh Jackson debacle😂
"There definitely was more than that. Stewart, Killian Hayes, Frank Jackson, Saben Lee, Hamidou Diallo, and Josh Jackson all showed reasons to be excited."

"Allen was and is one of the most successful projects in the NFL in an extremely long time. His accuracy coming out of college was something like 56%. There hasn’t been a successful QB with numbers like that in a really long time. If Allen doesn’t end up in Buffalo with Scott McDermott, I don’t know if he ever would have become the QB he is today. Even in his first season he was a scramble guy throwing 55%. Now put that on a roster with Hue Jackson and then Freddie Kitchens and I don’t imagine Cleveland waits around to see what they have in him. And I don’t imagine stefanski chooses to go to the franchise without a stable QB. Baker is and always was the answer. Josh Allen is more talented and physically gifted, but he would not have survived in the hellish dumpster fire that was the browns."
"regular season H2H is pretty meaningless and when you are talking about 6 matchups between east &amp; west teams then it spans multiple years and makes it even less significant.   Several of the games your referencing are when the Bucks had Brogdon, Bledsoe, and Niko, while the Suns had Warren, Josh Jackson, Holmes. You really think regular season games from 2018 with significantly different rosters could be indicative of what to expect in the 2021 finals?"

"Eventually you have to pay guys you hit on. I think if Hinkie stays aboard the team is Embiid, Simmons, and MPJ/SGA with picks that he keeps on flipping to use in role players. He definitely doesn’t move up to take Fultz and they either grab him at 3 or take like Josh Jackson. Then in 2018 he takes one of two guys mentioned above with Lakers picks knowing his draft history.   He also gets better value for Nerlens, Jah, and Kings pick. He also might not get Reddick in free agency due to his poor rep with agents but maybe still does the Jimmy trade"
"Between picks 21-30 seems like you have maybe a 35% chance on hitting at least a rotation player, and then maybe 10-15% on getting a really legitimate piece.   1/3 might not seem super high, but that’s also at a very low salary that you have a ton of control over.   **2011**  Mirotic (23rd)  Reggie Jackson (24th)  Cory Joseph (29th)  Butler (30th)  **2012**  *no one notable*  **2013**  THJ (24th)  Reggie Bullock (25th)  Roberson (26th)  Gobert (27th)   **2014**  Capela (25th)  Bogdan Bogdanovic (27th)  Kyle Anderson (30th)  **2015**  Bobby Portis (22nd)  RHJ (23rd)  Tyus Jones (24th)  Nance (27th)  Looney (30th)  **2016**  Korkmaz (26th)  Siakam (27th)  Dejounte Murray (30th)  **2017**  Jarrett Allen (22nd)  OG (23rd)  Kuzma (27th)  Derrick White (29th)  Josh Hart (30th)  **2018**  Grayson Allen (21st)  Aaron Holiday (23rd)  Simons (24th)  Shamet (26th)  Robert Williams (27th)  **2019**  Clarke (21st)  Bazley (23rd)  Keldon Johnson (29th)  KPJ (30th)  **2020**  Maxey (21st)  Nnaji (22nd)  Hampton (24th)  Quickley (25th)  Printchard (26th)  Bane (30th)"
"True, but at the time all my patience was chewed up and spit out by dragan bender and josh jackson"
"Honestly, I think the McD reign really deserves like it's own mini 30 for 30.   • He was a Danny Ainge disciple  • An average drafter (Bender, Chriss, and Len were bad but he also drafted Booker, Warren, Ayton, and made the trade for Shai but Sarver overruled him for Bridges)  • Pretty decent at trades and accumulating picks (the worst trade being the Knight trade but the Bledsoe and Dragic trades were phenomenal)  • He was arrogant af which led to a ton of flip flopping strategies. Do we tank? Do we try and change the NBA by starting 3 point guards? Do we put all the chips in the middle and go for Aldridge?  • Then you have to goat story, Bledsoe drama, Josh Jackson bailing on the Celtics interview and hotboxing his 5 month old daughter  It was an emotional rollercoaster. I'm glad it's over with but I'm surprised he doesn't have another front office job even if it's not the head role. He wasn't great by any means but I feel like the league has seen a lot worse"
"He was absolutely garbage at drafting. TJ Warren, Devin Booker &amp; DeAndre Ayton are the only ones he hit on  Len is very meh for a top-5 pick, but tbh the 2013 draft was a shitshow for most of the lottery anyway.  Then he drafted Dragan Bender with the 4th pick in 2016, as if that wasn't enough went and took Papagiannis &amp; Labissiere as well. So thats 3 useless 7-foot bums in 1 draft. He then packaged Bogdanovic/Papagiannis/Labissiere for Chriss  Blew top another top-5 pick in 2017, this time for Josh Jackson who was the prototypical uber-athletic knucklehead wing. Jackson lasted only 2 years before he was dumped to Memphis  And I'm pretty sure the only good trades he ever made was trading Scola for Gerald Green (who was a valuable part of that 48-win team in 2014) &amp; trading Zhaire Smith for Mikal Bridges"
"Drafting Booker probably the only good move that McDonough really deserves credit for.  Ayton was the consensus pick and in hindsight it wasn't even the best choice (as good as he's been, I'd rather have Luka). So while he shouldn't be penalized here, he shouldn't be rewarded either.  For everything else, the team culture was a disaster under McDonough (remember all of the Josh Jackson shenanigans? That was his draft pick btw) and he had a long string of draft busts. I don't think it's reasonable for him to claim credit for the work that Jones and Monty have done to clean up his mess."
He’s really come up from the time he had to buy fans beer on the house at a team event where Josh Jackson didn’t show up.
"Wait, this isn’t r/suns I didn’t know everyone paid attention to the Suns when we were bad, I still remember thinking Josh Jackson would be good. McD made so many bad picks, I’m surprised it took so long for him to get fired."
"Sorta.  Booker was a late lottery pick and Ayton was the only early pick that they hit on.   Whiffed badly on Dragan Bender, Marquise Chriss, Josh Jackson.     If Ayton had flopped, I'm not sure Booker would be sticking around."
"Yall tanked and your gm made stupid decisions with the picks yall ended up with, that isn't a contradiction that is the truth.   Josh jackson, Alex Len, dragon bender, marquess chriss  And don't get me started on the coaching hires, earl Watson, Igor kokoskov.  McDonough was an idiot, be glad Sarver finally decided to clear house and become more hands off"
Don't forget Josh Jackson also with the 4th overall pick. Or Marquise Chriss or Alex Len or... Well you get the point
"“I drafted Dragan Bender, Marquise Chriss, and Josh Jackson as decoys to confuse the NBA”"
"We’re not the best team left, anyone who says otherwise is fucking stupid.  But you know what else is stupid? These little fuck-fuck games y’all are playing trying to discredit the runs that the Suns are on.  We haven’t made the playoffs in a decade.  We've been arguably the worst team in the NBA over the same span.  We drafted Dragan fucking Bender and Josh Jackson.  It’s been fucking miserable being a Suns fan, and this season has been fucking awesome. So honestly? I don’t really give a fuck what you and others have to say about this season and this playoff run. Shits been fun for once, so yeah luck over bEtTeR tEAm all day."
I always thought Josh Jackson was going to be a superstar.
"Previous Suns core of Booker, Josh Jackson, Dragan Bender, and TJ Warren"
"Book and Josh Jackson (at the time he was still considered a potential piece) were young, they fit the timeline, Steph is 33, there’s no time to wait for Big Jim to develop ( I always thought he was a reach at 2 and that the college suspension saved his stock, he wasn’t ready to make an impact at the college level let alone the NBA)."
I second Josh Jackson.
Josh Jackson
"Im glad y’all got Luka if only for karma coming back the other way after DSJ. I guess Ayton is good karma for Josh Jackson.   Fuck, both teams whiffed that draft 😂"
"My thing is that he was off the Suns so quickly, and then Milwaukee and Golden State gave him a chance, I just think he got enough chances to improve but never really did. Chriss improved after leaving, Josh Jackson improved too, Bender not really"
That’s literally the only reason I’m glad I close a Josh Jackson jersey over a Devin Booker jersey 3 years ago 😭
Josh  Jackson was doing this very thing in Phoenix fyi
Josh Jackson would be a legend on the hot tar since he has no desire of playing organized ball and likes to drive head down into a crowd of defenders without any hint of considering a pass.
"Yes, it's happened many times in for many reasons. Harden begrudgingly worked out for Memphis but intentionally tanked his workout so they didn't draft him. JJJ didn't send his medical info to Memphis so they wouldn't draft him, they learnt their lesson this time round and still took him. Josh Jackson didn't workout for Boston because he wasn't sure he would get game time or shots if we took him. You've probably heard the Kobe story about not wanting to go to Charlotte or anywhere else except the Lakers."
Like you I thought Josh Jackson would be the next Kawhi.  He has disappointed me so much……..
Me and you both .... I thought Celtics should have taken Josh Jackson at #1 lmao.
"Lol I had Markelle Fultz and Josh Jackson as the best players from that class, my bad"
I thought Josh Jackson was going to be a superstar and the best player in the 2017 draft. I found it ridiculous that the Celtics picked JT over him at the time.   Shows how much I know...
Bruh I felt so bad for Suns back then ..... Dragan Bender and Josh Jackson in back to back years with a 4th pick .... that's rough.  Rooting for you guys in the playoffs though! I'd like to see CP3 get a ring.
mine is the same as yours but from the other side of it. i was low on tatum and fist pumped when the celtics took him because i knew that meant we were getting josh jackson. could have worked out better.
Josh Jackson strikes again!
"Good point, just like how no one knew the Celtics wanted Tatum when they had the #1 pick. Even after trading down, the majority thought Josh Jackson was the pick."
"Post-lotto mock draft. I'm pretty much going BPA in my opinion, with some subjective considerations, particularly whether I think the team is going for high potential or high floor, and in some cases where multiple players are about the same talent tier, best fit.  1 - Detroit - Cade Cunningham   2 - Houston - Evan Mobley   3 - Cleveland - Jalen Green   4 - Toronto - Jalen Suggs   5 - Orlando - Jon Kuminga   6 - Oklahoma City - Scottie Barnes   7 - Golden State - Moses Moody   8 - Orlando - James Bouknight   9 - Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  10 - New Orleans - Davion Mitchell   11 - Charlotte -  Franz Wagner   12 - San Antonio - Alperen Sengun   13 - Indiana - Josh Giddey   14 - Golden State - Corey Kispert   15 - Washington - Keon Johnson   16 - Oklahoma City - Usman Garuba   17 - Memphis - Ziaire Williams   18 - Oklahoma City - Kai Jones  19 - New York - Cam Thomas  20 - Atlanta - Isaiah Jackson   21 - New York - Sharife Cooper  22 - Los Angeles Lakers - Chris Duarte  23 - Houston - Trey Murphy  24 - Houston - Tre Mann  25 - Los Angeles Clippers - Jaden Springer  26 - Denver - Greg Brown  27 - Brooklyn - Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  28 - Philadelphia - Miles McBride  29 - Phoenix - Day'Ron Sharpe  30 - Ayo Dosunmu"
"Oh yeah I was only mentioning newly drafted guys, grant is a given! Even plumee can be an elite backup c. 10/10 guy with like 4 assists. Josh Jackson also showed some good signs"
Nahhhh Fultz was like consensus #1  And a lot of people even said Josh Jackson &gt; Tatum so obviously scouts flubbed that one
"Maybe I'm just in too deep but I actually really like the Plumlee signing. I'm assuming Weaver already knew that they were going to try to trade Rose/Blake/Ellington and we still need veterans on the team to teach the young guys. Plumlee is a smart guy and can be a good teacher for Stewart. He's also kind of a borderline starter/backup at this stage in his career so he shouldn't be upset getting benched for Stewart. He also seems to be on a very tradeable contract now. Teams nowadays seem to put priority on getting guards and wings in the offseason and wait to get cheap Centers or wait for buyouts, see Brooklyn/LAL. We might be able to trade him for another reclamation young guy like Dennis Smith/Josh Jackson/Hamdiou."
Josh Jackson is still young too.
Ay now Josh Jackson turned out alright!  *cough* After quite a few seasons *cough*
"Sure, but that’s not what the other guy said.  He said that the Suns were a trash organization until CP3 got there.  The bubble run showed that Phoenix’s culture had changed. People look at Monty Williams and they see a dude who won’t cuss, not a guy who led this team and created a system and scheme for these players. They see the roster created by James Jones, and they forget that it was betting on Marquese Chriss and Josh Jackson and Dragan Bender before he started reshaping it.  What I’m saying is that CP3 had a huge effect, but that he wasn’t the only person who made a difference, and that the big culture shift began before he got there."
"Wood was already gone, the Pistons signed Plumlee after it was already obvious that Wood was gone.   This Pistons management also got Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart with 16th and 19th pick (two all rookie guys), a breakout ""borderline"" all star in Jerami Grant, Hamidou Diallo by giving up Svi Mkhyaluak (idk how to spell it), Josh Jackson for only 5 million (averaged 14 and 4), and Saben Lee in the second round (averaged 6 and 4 in low minutes off the bench).   I'd say they've done fine."
"Come on now, I know Josh Jackson has rehabilitated his imagine since his days in Phoenix, but I don't even think he's a starter, much less 1/2 of a ""nightmare"" backcourt."
Cade &amp; Josh Jackson as a starting backcourt would be an nightmare for any team.
"if Hayes is half the prospect he was supposed to be, should be able get out in front of Josh Jackson or Diallo and play alongside Cade in the backcourt. If not, then at least a decent 6th man?"
"Detroit's 2 best players last season (Jerami Grant &amp; Saddiqq Bey) are their starting forwards. They had Wayne Ellington starting for a while but Josh Jackson &amp; Hamidou Diallo will likely fight that spot this season.   Like, just like your team has set things up for Markelle Fultz to be ""The Man"", Cunningham will definitely be the lead guard for the Pistons."
"Detroit going to have some insane talent. Hayes (not sure on him just yet he’s a work in progress), Cade, BEY, grant, Stewart   Solid line up of literally 1-2 year players with Grant. Also have josh jackson, seku, lee, off the bench. They still won’t do that well this upcoming season but man the future looks bright"
"what about dragan bender, marquiss chriss, tyler ulis and josh jackson?"
Pretty sure this happens a lot. Like Josh Jackson refused to work out for the Celtics. Kristaps Porzingis refused to workout or be interviewed by the Sixers. Luka refused to give medical records to the Kings. Mo Bamba told the Grizzlies not to draft him. Jahlil Okafor told the Sixers not to draft him. Jabari Parker allegedly 'tanked' his workout with the Cavs so they wouldn't draft him.  Hell Steph Curry refused to workout for any team except the Knicks. Kobe Bryant was telling every team in the league he would only play for the Lakers all the way back in 1996.   Long story short it happens all the time. Sometimes the player gets what they want. Sometimes they don't.
"Cade Cunningham, Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee  Corey Joseph, Josh Jackson, Hami Diallo, Sekou Doumbouya, Isaiah Stewart  Is this likely what you guys will look like? Or do you think a few players might be moved? Ala Plumlee and Joseph."
"Mason, CoJo, and Josh Jackson for Simmons. 2/3 can dunk on trae young and at least 2 can hit 3 pt shots sometimes"
"Disagree with Pistons. The young guys were fun to watch this year. Jeremi Grant was a MIP candidate, Bey and Stewart were All Rookie team, Killian Hayes played well towards the end of the season. And guys like Josh Jackson filled role player spots. And now they have the number one pick"
Nobody is that dumb.  It's a 5 person draft with the 5th person being Kuminga who is the biggest boom or bust guy.  The top 4 are sure things Kuminga is a high upside guy who may be a bust.  He's either gonna be Kawhi Leonard or Josh Jackson.  He has no medium outcome.  We gotta take Davion Mitchell because he's an older rookie with upside.
Deeeeeeetroit finally going to get Josh Jackson some help 🤡

Reddish is already a way better defender than Josh Jackson ever was
"Nah I don’t see that comparison. Josh Jackson had/has a slew of off-the-court issues, but got plenty of playing time in Phoenix. Reddish has dealt with some injuries but seems like a good dude, he is just far down in the depth chart since Atlanta has a lot of good wings."
Reddish looking like the next Josh Jackson
same applies for josh jackson/lebron?
"Jerami Grant is a realistic option  Wiseman, #6, Wiggins for Grant, Plumlee, Josh Jackson, Sekou  Take it or leave it you wont get a better offer  Grant shits on Wiggins, is on a very cap friendly deal, and just had the best season of his career - confidence is sky high  Plumlee is the perfect center for Golden State - put up 10/9/4 assists in 26 minutes last year and is only paid 8M  Josh Jackson is another cheap wing off the bench, Sekou can be tossed in as well - they can be used to add another player as they only amount to roughly 8M in expiring contracts  Golden State also would save around 4M in this deal as well"
"First off, I doubt suns trade up for mikal if they draft luka. So they still would be trying to use josh Jackson (gross) and crowder this past offseason legit passed up a chance to make more money and play with luka in Dallas just so he could join the suns and Chris Paul. He's not joining the suns without Chris Paul there."
Playing with elite players like Josh Jackson and Dragan Bender
"Markelle Fultz is not a bust. Dude is an above average player in the league right now. The only reason people don’t know that is because he plays in Orlando, and most people stopped paying attention to him after he got traded.  Josh Jackson(sort of) and DSJ are the two busts from that draft. You could argue Frank Ntilikina too, just because he’s still unplayable in some matchups due to spacing problems."
"Josh Jackson bailed on a fan event, not a charity event. But he also happens to be a piece of shit"
I’m in the camp of thinking Fultz isn’t a bust. I know for a #1 pick he’s been underwhelming but I feel his situation has been an enigma and something we haven’t ever seen. Think he’ll age better and showcase his potential as he did these past few seasons. I’d go more for Josh Jackson
Alex Caruso  Malik Beasley  Josh Jackson  Rodions Kurucs  Richaun Holmes
"Cade, Grant, Bey, Killian, Isaiah Stewart, Kelly Olynk, Josh Jackson, Hamidou Diallo, Jahlil Okafor, Saben Lee, Cory Joseph, Sekou Dombouya"
Looking at their depth chart:  PG: Killian Hayes / CoJo / Saben Lee  SG: Cade / Frank Jackson / Josh Jackson  SF: Jerami Grant / Hamidou / Josh Jackson  PF: Saddiq Bey / Trey Lyles / Sekou  C: Olynyk / Beef Stew  I mean yeah I think he's firmly in the third string right now. I could see him fighting for second-string minutes against either Jackson or Hamidou.  I'm still rooting for the guy and I think even if Detroit lets him go some team will take a flier on him. Kind of surprised Memphis got rid of him in the first place.
I really don’t see anywhere he’d be in our rotation. Frank Jackson and Diallo are much better options and will likely be the backup 2 and 3. Wouldn’t be surprised if they traded Josh or if not I guess he’d just fall out of the rotation. He’s not great tbh a lot of us would take a 2nd for him in a heartbeat lol
man i actually like josh jackson
PG: Jerome Robinson SG: Elfrid Payton SF: Josh Jackson PF: Bertans C: Baynes
"I was about to say, there's no way Diallo has worse tunnel vision than Josh Jackson, then realized they're both our SGs haha"
Josh Jackson
Josh Jackson and Hamiduo Diallo are the NYC and Chicago subways systems
"Right, that's why we throw in Okafor. Then Garzilla can be the PF that never plays and Bol Bol can be emergency C behind Beef Stew and Kelly O.   I agree though, you're not coming out enough ahead. How about throwing in Josh Jackson (he was actually pretty decent last year) in place of Lyles?"
"The 2018-19 Phoenix Suns if you removed DBook, Mikal, and Ayton.   Trevor Ariza  Tyler Johnson  Isaiah Canaan  Josh Jackson  Jamal Crawford  Ryan Anderson  Elie Okobo  Dragan Bender   with sharpshooters Troy Daniels and Jimmer Fredette"
Not gonna go too far back but take Fox instead of Josh Jackson in 2017 or take Haliburton instead of Jalen Smith.
Coangelo would’ve drafted Josh Jackson I swear
"I'm gonna have to disagree with this. He did draft Booker but it's a fucking miracle that 1) Booker's skillset grew as well as it did despite having an awful team and a string of 4-5 different head coaches and 2) Booker stayed in Phoenix and never demanded a trade. That 2018 draft is interesting because it was pretty clear that Ayton was our pick. We had a hole at the Center position for forever. The Bridges trade was facilitated by Sarver who apparently wanted Bridges so bad that he pushed for the trade.    McD made some okay moves and lucky for the Suns, hit on Booker and Ayton but let's not ignore the picks of Bender, Chriss, Josh Jackson, Len, and many others. Also the coaching merry-go-round we had as well. That dude drove us into the ground and again, it's a MIRACLE that we were able to rectify that as soon as James Jones took over."
"&gt;Josh Jackson is a pretty good defender and has scoring potential, character issues was his issue  After two years he was an awful defensive player and the dumbest offensive player I've ever watch play basketball"
"Fultz was pretty solid in Orlando and showed flashes in injury but had big confidence and injury issues which seems like it’s figuring itself out  Bamba at the very least performed at a solid level after Vuce left  Bagley has struggled but he’s still a guy that get a double double every night offensively  Josh Jackson is a pretty good defender and has scoring potential, character issues was his issue  Bender isn’t good but the 2016 draft was extremely weak  Dunn is a good defender and has shown much more than Culver  Exum had potential but injuries doomed him  Hezonja just wasn’t good but at the very least played in the rotation which Culver failed at doing midway through year 2"
"He’s still young and he was in a shitty franchise. There’s lots of other top 6 picks who had awful first two years.  Fultz, Bagley, Bamba, Fultz, Josh Jackson, Bender, Dunn, Hezonja, Exum. I could go on  There’s guys like this every year. The wolves also have a shit ton of young players and a bunch of guards"
Davion Mitchell is who Josh Jackson was supposed to pan out
"You're down the bottom, but you probably have the most realistic expectation. If you get an All-Star in the top 5 picks you're hitting above average, but a good starter seems about right.  Since 2010, All-Stars: Wall, Boogie, Kyrie, AD, Beal, Dipo, Embiid, KAT, Russell, Zinger, Simmons, Ingram, Brown, Tatum, Trae, Luka, Zion  Not All-Stars: Turner, Favors, Wes Johnson, Derrick Williams, Kanter, Tristan, Valanciunas, MKG, Waiters, Thomas Robinson, Bennett, Otto, Cody Zeller, Len, Wiggins, Jabari, Gordon, Exum, Okafor, Hezonja, Bender, Dunn, Fultz, Lonzo, Josh Jackson, Fox, Ayton, Bagley, JJJ, Ja, RJ, Hunter, Garland"
"assuming we're using last season rosters since our rookies haven't played yet, would I give up Jerami Grant and Josh Jackson for KAT and Anthony Edwards? Hell yeah I would."
"Well Jalen hasn’t played a second of NBA basketball so he very well could be a bum  Also Josh Jackson is an average bench player,far from a bum"
Josh Jackson is literally a bum Jalen will wash him 😂😂
"Come on man — I’m not a Luka fanboy by any means, but this is an awful take. It’s just as bad as all the people who always told us Book is empty stats because he can’t drag a starting backcourt partner like Canaan, Mike James, Tyler Ulis, or Josh Jackson to the playoffs."
Josh Jackson reporting for duty to kick some ass.  He is a Detroit player...you aren't going to fuck around in Detroit when he is on the roster.
Cannot wait for Josh Jackson to check into the game and defend this kid.
Josh Jackson
A few names I would have said have been said so I'll go with my biggest reach.  Josh Jackson
 I really thought josh Jackson was going to be an instant two way player and perennial all star.
Cade  Hayes Bey Grant Stewart   I am guessing that’s our starters. The bench is still being decided I feel. Josh Jackson and Kelly O are locks. Other good players like Saban Lee and Diallo as well will be in the mix.
I really thought Josh Jackson would be a superstar. He was supposed to be the next Kawhi lol
Didn't Josh Jackson have a ton of mental issues where he was just a menace and derailed his career off the court?
"&gt; Josh Jackson  in 2017 SL  Jackson put up 17.4 points,  9.2 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 1.2 steals, and 1 block in 35 mins per game   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWVrTCBXCac  Its summer league calm down. Although you guys should have taken him, it was really weird to me to pass on that upside."
I've been saying this kid is the real deal for a while but it was unpopular to be high on him. The consensus was that he would be Josh Jackson 2.0 for a while. I still think Giddey will be solid though
"We will have to cut Pistons Legend Okafor/Josh Jackson, for this"
I envy you I wish I could have my time back watching the Ben Gordon Charlie villaNueva Brandon Jennings Josh Smith Greg Monroe Reggie Jackson Drummond Pistons
Kuminga give me Josh Jackson vibes
"Markelle Fultz, Josh Jackson, and Jonathan Issac were all picked before Ntilikina. If it was so obvious that Mitchell was going to be good, how did 12 teams miss it? Take away the Celtics if you want because they got Tatum."
"Lol. He can't dribble, has no moves, no vision, has the dribble package of a 70's power forward, is slow ect. I can go on an on but his main weaknesses is basketball.  He's garbage. He makes Josh Jackson look like Tracy McGrady."
"Yeah dude no point in even conversing with you if you’re delusional enough to say the Lakers have made “2 decades of awful personnel moves and would be the worst franchise in history if it didn’t happen to be located near Hollywood”.   I guess that hiring Phil Jackson, trading for Pau, drafting and building the 09-10 championship teams, consistently hitting on draft picks and G-League signings (Randle, Lonzo, BI, Kuz, Josh Hart, Thomas Bryant, Caruso) which allowed us to even have a chance at AD (and now Westbrook) hiring Vogel, and hiring Pelinka just to name a few key, successful moves over the “past 20 years” is classified as “consistently awful”. Not to mention, the Lakers wouldn’t have even been in that drought in the 10’s had Stern and the NBA not completely fucked them over (funny enough New Orleans would’ve been much better off with our package in hindsight).  It’s clear you just have a lot of hatred for the Lakers which is fine, just try not to make it delusional."
This tells you how high Porzingis's value and hype was back then and it makes this [all the more lol](https://www.brightsideofthesun.com/2019/2/1/18206889/woj-report-kristaps-porzingis-josh-jackson-trade-swap-2017)
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"I'm not loving Killian as the main ball handler and playing Cade off ball but he's at least got some juice and will be fun to watch.   D Rose, Wright, Cory Joseph, Frank Jackson, and Josh Jackson does not sound a fun combo of guards to watch.    Respect for watching all those games tho, I can't say I suffered through all the Thunder games during the 2nd half tank job of last season."
"Our backcourt was a mess. Easily the worst backcourt in the league. Revolving door of players. Some Killian, some D Rose, some Delon Wright, some Cory Joseph, some Saben Lee, some Frank Jackson, some Josh Jackson, some Diallo, and even a little McGruder.     If I had to guess, I would say that Wright got the most starts at PG, and Josh Jackson got the most starts at SG. I could totally be wrong, but I watched literally every game, and I'm not sure without looking it up. So, I fault absolutely no one for not being up on all that mess.  Cade solidifies one of the positions, but we're still looking for someone to step up and claim the other guard spot. Beef Stew (or maybe Olynyk) will fill out the C position now that Plumlee was moved."
Better than Josh Jackson
"Always has been, the face of our franchise has been white like 90% of our existence:   * 1980-1990: Brad Davis is our longest tenured player, gets his jersey retired, fan favorite and our first good player.  * 1982-1992: Rolando Blackman: not white * 1984-1997: Derek Harper: Also not white * 1994-1997: Jason Kidd, he's mixed race, but white passing, most people I've met learned he was mixed rather than knowing off the bat.  * 1998-2004: Steve Nash: Nash, Finley and Dirk were synonymous with the Mavericks in the early 00s, but Nash and Dirk were the All NBA selections and made 2 all star games together.  * 1998-2019: Dirk * 2018-PRESENT: Luka Dončić * 2019-PRESENT: Kristaps Porziņģis   There's been other stars but I would argue none of which are ""faces of the franchise"" like these guys were. Josh Howard was great but that was still clearly Dirk's team. Same with guys Jim Jackson and Mashburn who were only here a few seasons, and didn't quite get the hype that Jason Kidd got.   On top of that, a lot of our big signings have been white. Chandler Parsons was probably our largest signing in the '10s. Shawn Bradley was a huge trade piece, Kiki Vandeweghe was a major draft pick for us, and Detlef Schrempf was solid for us. Our all time team is actually super white, especially for a 1980+ team.   C: Kristaps Porziņģis / Tyson Chandler / Shawn Bradley  PF: Dirk Nowitzki / Roy Tarpley / Sam Perkins  SF: Mark Aguirre / Rolando Blackman / Josh Howard  SG: Luka Dončić / Michael Finley / Jason Terry  PG: Steve Nash / Jason Kidd / Brad Davis  7/15 players are white. I'd be willing to bet every other 1980+ team is probably 2 or 3 / 15 white players."
"God I miss him at Kansas. One of my all time favorite who should have been known as maybe the best big at KU since Manning and up there with him in achievements. He did everything right. He stayed and worked his ass off to fix his body and perimeter defense and became the best big in the nation. He missed 2 tourneys from wrist injuries on separate wrists, and entered 2020 anchoring the best team(by far imo) in the nation. We made a final four in the only tourney he fully played in. That team the year before with him instead of landen Lucas in the lineup also wins it all and I feel strongly about that. Frank mason, devontae graham, josh Jackson, svi mykhailuk and udoka azubuike. God damn"
He literally got Summer League MVP and was putting up almost a triple-double. Kris Dunn and Josh Jackson are some other top pick Summer League to regular NBA flops.
Not a ton of players I know so   Norm Powell  Josh Jackson  Jared Dudley  Luke Walton  Bill Walton   6th man- Chase Budinger
So is Josh Jackson lol and he wasn’t taken above Luka Trae JJJ Shai or MPJ
"Because hes not bad enough as these guys to be top 14, even if you think hes a bust do you think he belongs with guys like Josh Jackson or Dennis Smith Jr? Hes still a talented player capable of putting up 14/10 any given night."
"Josh Jackson averages 14 ppg and 4 rpg on like 42% from the field. Now, that obviously isnt great, but far from bust numbers.   I watched a lot of him in Detroit and he had good energy on defense and is a pure scorer, the problem is he has tunnel vision and questionable shot selection."
Not Josh Jackson
I don’t know about josh Jackson
Fultz is gonna be a stud next year. Also Jordan Poole and Ant and Keldon Johnson and Josh Jackson
I was so sure about Josh Jackson being great man. Maybe not HOF level but he's been such a disappointment
"I think the pistons have a case. We were number one in bench scoring last year and we added kelly O  Saben, josh jackson, sekou, kelly O  And potentially hami and frank jackson (if we retain them)"
"I don't really see how this is relevant. My point is that at his prime he was good enough to be a starter in weaker team if given the minutes and a slot to do so. Obviously that's not what happened, but given that he's performed similarly or better to some of the weaker NBA starters when playing against or even with them I don't really see  how it's that he ""absolutely"" wouldn't have been good enough rather than that situations/fit didn't align in time.  Even if we are discussing whether or not he could have been starter at the time he played in the league, we'd have the issue that he never really went to a weak team.   I mean how much better do you think players like Delon Wright, Josh Jackson, Jae'Sean Tate, Dwayne Bacon, or Cole Anthony for example are than what Nando DeColo is now or at his best?  Or you can take those guys I mentioned, do you think they would have started in Spurs or Toronto at that time? Hell, I'm not even sure if someone like Rubio or Bledsoe would have."
"&gt;I don't think I was on that point of discussion.  You're responding to my points, which are on the topic I quoted. Did the OP not say ""LeBron's teams were too good to pick that high""?  &gt; Jordan went 30-52 (5 games worse than Lebron's worst team record).  Jordan didn't go 30-52, he missed all but 18 games that season with a broken foot. That's 64 games he missed! Bulls management held him back on a minutes restriction and wouldn't let him start even after it healed because additional injury could've been career ending. There's no question the Bulls would've had a better record if he hadn't gotten hurt.  &gt;Bulls had a #11 pick the year after Jordan, a #9 pick the year after that, a #8 pick AND a #10 pick the year after that, a #11 pick the year after that, a #6 and #18 and #20 pick the year after that. It wasn't until 1990 did the Bulls fail to not have a #20 pick or better.  7 lottery picks were added after 1987. The Bulls weren't picking in the lottery. If you don't make the playoffs, you pick in the lottery.  The Cavs had a lottery pick with LeBron, and they used it on Luke Jackson instead of Al Jefferson, J.R. Smith, Josh Smith, or literally anyone other than Luke Jackson... They would've had a lottery pick in LeBron's second year as well, but they obviously traded it away."
"&gt;Look at the Bulls now. They had an 11th in 85, 9 in 86, 9 and 11 in 87.  Well there were fewer teams prior to the expansion drafts in 1988 and 1989, which added 4 more teams to the league - Hornets, Heat, Timberwolves, and Magic. Another expansion draft in '95 added the Grizzlies and the Raptors. Then the Bobcats were added in 2004 to round the number of teams at 30. We've added 7 lottery picks since '87...  &gt;I'm not saying LeBron teams were better so they couldn't draft high. I'm saying the FO wasn't even close to what Krause and the Bulls did.   That's fine. But the original post certainly **DID** say ""LeBron's teams didn't pick that high because they were too good"". There were other reasons they weren't picking that high, it wasn't because they were ""too good"". And they could've selected Al Jefferson, Josh Smith, or J.R. Smith over Luke Jackson - or any other player in that draft, frankly. He was terrible. I didn't even remember him until I just looked at it. Hell, I looked at him, and I still don't remember him. He played 73 games in the NBA, apparently."
"Josh Jackson was voted by GM’s to be most likely to have the nicest career of the lottery picks. Talent and potential wasn’t the issue, his personality was."
"In short, the reality of the offseason is much better than the perception, but the perception is also pretty bad and it will take the Pelicans being able to take advantage of the considerable flexibility they've afforded themselves to change the minds of many.  After making good moves by recognizing the mistakes of last offseason, overhauling the coaching staff, and clearing the decks with the Memphis trade, they took a shot at the top veteran point guards on the market, made big offers to Lowry and then Paul, and they were turned down. Then they went after guys like THJ and Powell to add more shooting and a solid veteran starter to the lineup and they both chose to stay with their current teams. After doing so, they seem to be set on operating as an above the cap team, which is why they’ve been bringing in guys by sign and trade. Thus it is highly unlikely the book has been written on the Pelicans offseason, but if you stopped the story right now the first few chapters might give you cause for concern.  But, I'm fairly confident they will add several more players with the flexibility that their moves has afforded them, and when the totality of moves are made, things will look far better even if the general consensus of fans has been crystallized by  what has happened solely in the past few days.   That is the gist, but if curious, what follows if much more detailed:  I can understand the disappointment and frustration of many Pelicans fans, and skepticism of fans around the league. I also get the criticism in the media, both the valid and hyperbolic, especially when the media (particularly the hot take variety) has a bias towards larger markets, a desire to see young superstars on “name” teams, as well as the with Pelicans/Hornets past failures to build winners around CP3/AD, and given the mistakes of last offseason and what it cost to undo them this year. It also does not help that their primary target was also the top (reasonably gettable) guy on the market this year, fans got their hopes up, and when they took a big swing for the home run and missed, then followed that up with not matching Lonzo, and then Pels fans only see backups from Chicago and Charlotte coming in and are critical or worried. And If this were the sum total of the Pelicans offseason, I would probably agree with them, especially if there were no more moves made (there will be several). But as it stands now they are in position to be a better performing team this year than last, and have much improved finances/books, hold no bad contracts, and have a ton of flexibility to fill several more spots for this years team.   On Lonzo, they seem to have decided (correctly imo) that he was not worth the price Chicago paid, though even if it were marginally lower they probably don’t match and force Ball to stay. I completely understand the reasoning of why many would disagree and say just match, and I think it was a closer call than the front office did, but ultimately at that number and given Lonzo’s preference to leave (along with the terrible experience of forcing Eric Gordon to stay and underperform years ago) I agree with letting him go. They felt that Lonzo was not the answer at point, and that he’s really more of a 3/D guard and that they could find either a star level veteran floor leader, or a cheaper option that could actually run the half court, drive the ball, and wasn’t afraid to draw fouls. They struck out on the veteran, but were able to acquire Graham on a good deal. There was not a big return on the Lonzo trade because the pelicans were not going to match, Lonzo wanted out, and Chicago had other things cooking with the other players who may have been potentially included, and they were not going give up a first for the right to sign and trade for Ball like they did DeRozan (they also included that FRP to dump Aminu’s contract). Would I have preferred a better return for Lonzo, yes, but I don’t think we were getting a 1st or White, and would have liked Young over Sato, but that’s only marginally better.  Ultimately the value of return in a sign and trade is not equal to the player, but to the relative willingness for the team with RFA rights to match the number. The Pelicans had less desire to match, thus the lower return. This same logic is also why I think giving up the 1st to Charlotte was a slight overpay for Graham, as they have Ball and Rozier, just drafted Bouknight, so were probably less intent to match to prevent the logjam, but given the low number on Graham they may have matched without the 1st, and of course there is also the added value for the Pels of staying in position to operate over the cap.   We also need to keep in mind that with all the space the Pelicans created, including trade exceptions from disparity of incoming/outgoing contracts, and how they have chosen to operate in the transactions they have made, it is clear that there are several more moves coming, likely also by trade, via MLE/BAE, et al. So any grade on this offseason far is very much incomplete. There are probably at least 2, possibly 3 players who will be in the Pels' rotation this fall that are not currently on the roster.   At this point we should take a look at that new roster, because most of the Pelicans' moves have been made via trade, and involve many players, picks, and coaches I think it is important to consider all of what is coming in, going out, and where they currently are situated.   Outgoing: Coach SVG, Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams and their bad contracts, Lonzo Ball, Pelicans’ Lottery protected 2022 1st, Top 10 protected Lakers 22’ 1st, Ziare Williams  Incoming: Willie Green, Mike D’Antoni, Jonas Valanciunas, Devonte Graham, Trey Murphy, Tomas Satoransky, Garrett Temple, 2 second round picks, (Re-signed Didi Louzada)  Unused/TBD: Open cap space, Trade exception, Josh Hart Bird Rights, non-tax MLE, BAE  &amp;#x200B;  Even if there were no further moves (there will be) and they just kept/matched Josh Hart, you can argue that they will be a better team with this roster and coaching staff. I would say the roster is slightly less talented as of now with Lonzo out, but it’s not just Graham replacing Lonzo, it will be what the sign and trade for Graham and not overpaying Lonzo gives you, which is the ability to operate as an over the cap team, preserve and utilize exceptions, and extra space with which to operate, along with Hart’s rights and possibly Sato as a small piece/contract to deal. If they are unable to take advantage of this flexibility, or the open space they have, I would fully agree that this offseason has been if not a failure, but a disappointment and a big missed opportunity. But I fully expect them to take advantage of said flexibility.   By operating as an over the cap team, they can bring in a decent sized salary (20-25M) in a trade from a team looking to avoid the tax, save money, or retool their roster. Obvious examples, but of course not limited these guys are Ingles or Bojan from the Jazz, Barnes or Buddy from the Kings. Then of course you can take on salary in conjunction with assets to recoup some of what you sent out, like maybe Washington pays to dump Bertans and you add more shooting to the rotation as well. These are just a few examples that have been thrown out by those that follow the Pelicans closely, but this type player is what I would expect to add.   You also still have space, as well as the MLE and BAE to add guys still on the market that could either start or provide decent depth along the lines of Reggie Jackson, Paul Millsap, Lauri Markkanen, Kelly Oubre, Schroder, Avery Bradley, etc.  They may also choose to keep Josh Hart, or do a sign and trade with him somewhere for another rotation guy or asset.   Then of all the players they acquired, Satoransky could be on the move, as he’s expendable, has some value, is a nice sized number to work into a trade, and keeping him might block the minutes/development of the young guards they like on the roster (who SVG puzzlingly backburnered in favor of an uninterested and underperforming Bledsoe last year). I like Satoransky as depth, but I can see him being moved for something as well.  So, as we can see, there is likely a good bit more to come, so the grade is incomplete. But if they don’t do anything else, or they don’t have a plan of how to utilize their flexibility I would say that they deserve much of the criticism they’ve received, even if this year’s team outperforms last year’s. "
Josh Smith coulda been their Scottie. Instead they got Luke Jackson.
"Really anything but Rafael Araujo probably would have been an upgrade.  I wasn't super big on tracking the Raptors' mock picks at the time but after some quick searches for mocks from the period, here's who I saw mocked at No. 8 for Toronto that year: Josh Smith, Luke Jackson, Andris Biedrins.   I guess it was kind of a toss-up at No. 8, which makes sense because there's a lot of toss-up players sitting out there in the early teens that year.  I will say, Araujo seemed to mock six to eight slots lower than where he was picked, typically slotted to Utah at 14 or 16.   But then again, Toronto was under new management who, from what I gathered from the outside (I could be wrong), didn't really seem to be on the ball and played a solid role in Vince Carter's disenfranchisement with the team."

We'll see. But I've been telling people for weeks that Kuminga won't be this super raw rookie getting no buckets. He'll be solid and will adjust. People were talking about this kid like he's the next Josh Jackson
Josh Jackson was there as a little kid and threw a water bottle at the Pacers. Lol.
"No you weren’t lol  https://www.bloggersodear.com/2017/7/18/15989216/john-collins-nba-summer-league-first-team-lonzo-ball-josh-jackson-dennis-smith-caleb-swanigan  &gt; His mind numbing dunks have also caught the attention of Sportscenter, as well the Twittersphere, and Hawks Reddit, who has coined him “John the Baptist” (I can’t believe we didn’t come up with this quite frankly given Wake’s former Baptist affiliation)."
"I think he'd be a great add to the Pistons or Pelicans, who could use some help still, can take a risk, and still pay him alright at least.   Pistons obviously aren't using him over Cade but rn their other options are Josh Jackson (better fit as an SF imo), Hamidou Diallo (better fit as an SF imo), and Cory Joseph (better fit as a PG imo). I guess they could technically slide DSJ over but again, fit thing. Just as a 3rd/4th guard he adds a decent amount.  Pels wise he's better than Satoransky, I think NAW and Graham are both actually great and will impress this year, but again, could use a little bench depth at G rn and Nunn is better than your average 3rd/4th guy, especially at the budget it looks like he'll be available at."

"Between Griffin's dead money opening up and the contracts for Josh Jackson and Jahlil Okafor ending, you still got $35 mil opening up next year. And even if we add a $20 mil player this year and re-sign guys like Frank Jackson and Saban Lee, we would still have $50+ mil left under the luxury tax next year. There's room to make moves with Grant being the highest paid at $20 mil and a whole lot of young players on cheap contracts. If the contracts signed this year become some kind of hindrance there's always ways around it, be it sign and trade or dumping salary like we just did with Plumlee. If a player wants to come, you can make it work. I'm just not a fan of sitting on this ability to make yourself better when you don't know what happens next year. For all you know Beal or whoever could sign an extension and you miss out both this year and next year."
But [Josh Jackson has already surpassed Jayson Tatum!](https://valleyofthesuns.com/2018/02/24/josh-jackson-has-already-surpassed-jayson-tatum/)
Our options kind of in order of what I selfishly prefer   Lowry  Powell  Match offer on Lonzo:  -Keep Zo  -S&amp;T to Boston for Smart  -Chicago has nothing other than Thad Young that I’d want back so   Duncan Robinson   Reggie Jackson or Kelly Olynyck or Furkan Korkmaz or JaMychal Green  Dragic  Dinwiddie (meh)  Kemba (kill me)    Most of (except Lowry in the universe where the tempering police veto Lowry to Miami) — if not all — of these can be done while also re-signing Josh Hart and using the MLE.
Don’t forget Josh Jackson
"People forget that the sixers had the Lakers top 3 protected pick and the lakers were so bad it didn't convey 2 years in a row. Lakers had the 4th worst record and got the 2nd pick in the lottery.   If it was the 4th pick, it wouldve conveyed to the sixers  We would've gotten Fultz AND Josh Jackson - league fucked"
You did draft josh Jackson third overall. I'm not giving y'all the benefit of the doubt yet
"Our SGs are Josh and Frank Jackson and Diallo (someone is gone if Powell signs), so whomever of those 3 ends up staying could greatly benefit from having Norm to learn from."
"Jordan Poole, JJJ, Josh Jackson, Malik Monk, hopefully Wiseman, Killian Hayes"
Josh Jackson.. haha I’m kinda joking
"I'd go with Josh Jackson. I still genuinely believe there's a good player in there, and I think DET is doing a good job of slowly getting him back in the right direction.  When healthy last season he was a pretty good inside scorer, made some nice passes, and from what I saw of him he played solid defense as well. His big swing skill is still his 3 ball, but he did have streaks where he shot over 40% from deep for a few weeks, and it's not like he's a horrible FT shooter at 73%, so I'm still hopeful that eventually comes around for him."
Still think Josh Jackson will be good. Watched a couple piston games and liked what I saw
"&gt; Seems to talk a little too much for a rook.   Oh yeah im real interested to see how it goes with him. I actually think he's fine I dont think he's bad or anything. But like 18 months from now people will either look at him as a good and reputable or just a buffoon no real in between.   Nothing he's said I dont find plausible really(again plausible being the key word). But there's a reason guys like Woj and Shams arent reporting or mentioning those things themselves; either they cant get anybody they trust to tell them that or they know better. Woj types only ever say a small fraction of what they know they sit on tons of info. I remember for ex like 2 yrs after the 2017 draft Woj saying on his podcast ""the Suns couldve traded Josh Jackson on draft night for Porzingis"". You think he only found that out 2 yrs later....in most cases no he knew then. There's a reason he didnt let it get out there publicly back then though neither franchise wanted him to."
"yeah i don't get the reddish thing either. you can say it's injuries, but all he has shown has been flashes his entire career since highschool, injuries or not. TS the last three years going back to college is 50%, 49%, 50%. never shot over 33% from three. his defense might be solid, but he is not nearly good enough on that end to justify being a big net negative on offense, he's never been able to score consistently.  reminds me of thinking that josh jackson would put it all together some day."
He definitely would have taken Josh Jackson.
"Oh, yeah, it could have been much worse. That pick swap could have easily turned into Josh Jackson or some other scrub.  Malachi turned out to be a scrub at 22, which was unfortunate (I'm a 'Cuse fan, so I loved that kid) considering Siakam, Dejounte, and Brogon were all on the board."
The reason why Tatum was projected at 3 is because Josh Jackson refused to work out for the Celtics allegedly because he didn't want to go to a team that he wouldn't start on.  Most experts had Josh as the third best player in the draft. A lot projected him as the second best player in the draft actually but the Lakers didn't even try to hide that they were taking Lonzo since Fultz was a lock to go first.
"Celtics were going to take Tatum if they stayed at #1. And Lonzo was pretty much locked in for the Lakers. Ryan McDonough's evaluation was crap, but we never had a chance at Tatum. What hurt way more is taking Josh Jackson over Fox cause that was something actually in our control. Glad McD is long gone"
But he has playmaking and defensive ability so he's more like an Andrei Kirilenko or Boris Diaw than a Stanley Johnson or Josh Jackson.
"Yeah, I remember considering him more of a risky pick with high offensive potential; he’s obviously ended up being that and then some lol, but I would have never played the situation how Ainge did even if Tatum is the type of player you love your team to take a risk on.   At the time I think we were thinking we’d get Josh Jackson who I didn’t love and I guess that’s my little prize from that awful draft 🤣"
Stanley Johnson has been in the league for over five years and Josh Jackson is going into his 5th.
"Scottie Barnes will be in the league for 5 years tops.  I actually have no idea but so far the mold of players with his scouting profile (long and athletic with a bad shot) have often not worked out.  Everyone thinks they’re getting Jaylen Brown/Kawhi Leonard, but just as often you get Stanley Johnson/Josh Jackson"
"It wasn't like Suggs, who was the consensus #4. It was Fultz as consensus #1, and then Lonzo, Tatum and Josh Jackson were all p much tied."
"The Lakers *could* have offered Markieff the same contract that Richaun Holmes got from Sacramento, or even what Reggie Jackson got from the Clippers (they had early Bird rights on him, just like with those other guys and their teams), but instead they just passed on him. He seems like he has the same bitterness that Josh Hart had when the Lakers traded him. Some of these guys must really hate it when the chance to be a Laker is taken away from them. I mean, [just look how happy he was to be a part of the team.](https://youtu.be/EdSRV0D-yiE)"
"We’ve been a lot closer than people realize, even last year up until the last few games we were in the play-in conversation (albeit as a long shot)  But yeah we’ve been 9th/10th seed much more than we’ve been 14th/15th - a lot of our fans would call it purgatory. Too good to get a top draft pick, barring some luck, but too bad to make the playoffs.  And when we did get lucky and move up, well.. t-Rob at 5, Bagley at 2.. not a good track record of high lottery picks. Got Fox at 5 though, which is great cause someone reminded me once that when we were projecting around #3 that year we were probably going to pick Josh Jackson"
But there's also a  universe where they get Jabari Parker/Okafor/Bender/Josh Jackson
"If not that haul from the Nets then the Cs were going to sell KG and Pierce elsewhere as it was time to blow it up. They might not have gotten four super high 1st but they would have still got value.   Cs go hard into tank mode and still draft Brown, but like at 8 rather than 3. Danny then packages other firsts to move up to 5 to draft Tatum after Fultz, Ball, Josh Jackson, and Fox who many had higher than Tatum.   The best thing? Danny doesn’t waste a good pick on James fucking Young. That dude straight up fucking sucked.  This is all facts by the way, I ran the numbers. All checks out."
"Neither was solidly 3. If Josh Jackson worked out for whoever was picking 3rd, they might have taken him."
The Celtics themselves really liked Josh Jackson until he refused to work out for them. Tatum absolutely could’ve slid one more spot.
"A competent front office wouldn't have ditched Boozer or blown it on every draft pick and most trades.   Hell, in 04 they had a top 10 pick in a loaded draft and chose one of the few players in the top 30 to not pan out.  How different would that team have looked with young LeBron, Boozer and someone like Josh Smith, Al Jefferson, Tony Allen, Kevin Martin or Trevor Ariza instead of Luke fucking Jackson.   Add a good coach and that team looks totally different.   Plus, a good GM and coach can make unattractive teams more attractive, particularly when it becomes obvious that they have an all time talent on the come up."
"Maybe Dan Marino and Reggie Miller. Both very respected, but just played in eras before the real value of how to best utilize their skillset was realized.   Adrian Peterson and Russell Westbrook. Work ethic, extreme physicality, great teammates, MVP seasons around a rare statistical feat (2000 yard season, triple-double season). AP's catching out of the backfield = Westbrook's jumpshooting.  Josh Allen and Kawhi Leonard. Kawhi's jumpshooting = Allen's accuracy. Once both figured those out, they were superduperstars.  Aaron Rodgers and Kevin Durant. Both respected more by purists of their respective sports than by national media, it seems like. Both misused earlier in their career (KD at SG and Rodgers on the bench.) Both have pretty fundamentally unmimic-able games. Both have been MVP and best players on championship teams. Both overshadowed by having one of the best all-time players in the sport playing at their position during their career. Both can seem bored during games, and can quietly have unbelievable statistical games. And most importantly, both are pretty emo dudes.  Lamar Jackson and Giannis. Extremely unusual physical tools, really unlimited potential for improvement. Perennial playoff contenders in small cities where they're by far the most famous athlete.    Jalen Ramsey and Anthony Davis. Both cried their way out of bad teams to get to LA so that they didn't have to have the responsibility of being the best player on a team."
"Idk man josh Jackson has superstar potential, and Tatum is too young, only 19"
"Maybe because of the draft? Suns got stuck with Josh Jackson at 4 instead of Tatum at 3, imagine what the current team looks like with Tatum instead."
&gt;Josh Jackson &gt; Giannis Antetokounmpo  -Mattoosie
"Joe Johnson is the base, not Josh Jackson  Actually it's Tyler Johnson that is the most common name in sports lol"
"I agree. On the Josh Jackson &gt; Giannis Antetokounmpo scale, Paul George is sitting comfortably in the 15-20% range."
"It doesn't. Literally the only way to make the salaries match is to include Jerami Grant in the trade. The Pistons can't trade all the free agents they just signed (including Lee, Frank Jackson, and Joseph) until December 15th so in order to make the salaries work without giving up Cunningham they have to trade everyone else they *can* trade: Grant, Hayes, Stewart, Bey, and Josh Jackson for John Wall. Nope."
"I mean how many times have we seen really athletic young players who have sky high potential end up never taking it to the next level? Josh Jackson, Justice Winslow, Mudiay, etc. so I don’t blame you. heck, I wasn’t expecting Lavine to be the star that he is today."
"Totally forgot about Josh Jackson. He’s pretty much a young, short armed Kawhi"
"&gt; For 12 straight years you could throw a random assortment of players around him (and they did, he almost never played with a fellow all-star caliber player) and you'd win 50+ games and go to the playoffs and be competitive. This is something that KG couldn't do. KG was an incredible individual player, but he just didn't affect his teams performance as much as Dirk did.  Except, during that 11 year run of 50+ wins every year, Dirk did have multiple fellow all star players - Michael Finley, Steve Nash, Josh Howard, Jason Kidd. In those 11 years, he had a fellow all star teammate in 5.5 of them. And that's not counting the multiple all star caliber players who played there in that stretch but didn't make an all star team (mostly because of reduced role) like Antwan Jamison, Antoine Walker, Caron Butler, Jason Terry and maybe Shawn Marion. Meanwhile KG had a 5 year stretch of 47+ wins (4 50+) with only 2 all star teammates, and maybe 1 more all star caliber teammate. Calling KG not a ""offensive hub"" is disingenuous.  But beyond that look at the teams. Here's that 11 year run with the top 5 players minus Dirk (in terms of MP) and their VORP.  Year | Player 1 | Player 2 | Player 3 | Player 4 | total --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 00/01 | Finley (3.4) | Eisley (1.2) | Nash (2.9) | Bradley (1.8) | 9.3 01/02 | Nash (3.6) | Finley (2.1) | Howard (0.1) | Griffin (1.1) | 6.9 02/03 | Nash (4.5) | Finley (2.4) | Van Exel (1.1) | Bradley (2.0) | 10.0 03/04 | Walker (1.8) | Finley (2.7) | Nash (3.0) | Jamison (2.2) | 9.7 04/05 | Howard (2.0) | Terry (3.2) | Finley (1.3) | Stackhouse (0.8) | 7.3 05/06 | Terry (3.7) | Dampier (0.2) | Howard (2.0) | Daniels (1.1) | 7.0 06/07 | Terry (4.3) | Howard (3.2) | Harris (1.7) | Dampier (1.1) | 10.3 07/08 | Howard (2.2) | Terry (3.3) | Dampier (1.4) | Bass (0.6) | 7.5 08/09 | Kidd (4.0) | Terry (3.1) | Dampier (1.2) | Howard (0.8) | 9.1 09/10 | Kidd (4.5) | Terry (2.2) | Marion (0.9) | Barea (0.3) | 7.9 10/11 | Kidd (3.3) | Terry (1.9) | Marion (1.3) | Chandler (1.8) | 8.3  And here's KG's first 12 years in MIN  Year | Player 1 | Player 2 | Player 3 | Player 4 | total --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 95/96 | Gugliotta (2.1) | Rider (0.7) | Mitchell (-0.1) | Porter (1.2) | 3.9 96/97 | Gugliotta (2.9) | Marbury (1.2) | Mitchell (-0.9) | West (-0.8) | 2.4 97/98 | Marbury (1.5) | Mitchell (0.8) | Porter (2.0) | Parks (-0.1) | 4.2 98/99 | Smith (0.6) | Mitchell (0.4) | Garrett (0.3) | Jackson (0.4) | 1.7 99/00 | Brandon (4.1) | Sealy (1.0) | Szczerbiak (1.6) | Peeler (0.8) | 7.5 00/01 | Szczerbiak (1.7) | Brandon (3.6) | Peeler (0.7) | Ellis (0.4) | 6.4 01/02 | Szczerbiak (2.7) | Billups (2.7) | Nesterovic (0.2) | Peeler (1.0) | 6.6 02/03 | Hudson (1.1) | Nesterovic (1.1) | Peeler (0.7) | Gill (-0.4) | 2.5 03/04 | Sprewell (1.3) | Cassell (4.6) | Hassell (0.4) | Hoiberg (1.8) | 8.1 04/05 | Szczerbiak (1.8) | Sprewell (-0.3) | Hassell (-0.4) | Hudson (-0.2) | 0.9 05/06 | Hassell (-0.7) | Jaric (0.7) | Szczerbiak (1.5) | Davis (0.6) | 2.1 06/07 | Davis (1.8) | Blount (-0.7) | Hassell (0.0) | James (0.2) | 1.3  KG had 2 teams in 12 years that were as good as any that Dirk had in that 11 year run, and neither was even close to Dirk's top 5 supporting casts in that stretch. I think Dirk has a good argument over KG, and they belong in the same tier. But your points about KG not being able to elevate the team around him is just wrong (he just had a much lower baseline than Dirk because his teams sucked so much more) and implying that Dirk had poor teams is just disingenuous, especially when compared to KG."
Josh Jackson. I thought he could be the next Iggy.
"As a Raptors fan in 2017, I remember being so happy the Celtics missed out on Josh Jackson and instead got mediocre Jayson Tatum.   I was very wrong."
Josh Jackson I thought that man was gonna be a key to our future
"No one but the most diehard Suns and Pelicans fans who were watching [this meaningless game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lmmI9wI35s&amp;feature=onebox) at the end of the regular season will remember this. The Suns were the worst team in the league, and the Pelicans were playing AD 20 mins a game after he’d tried to force his way out to LA. The game itself was pretty entertaining, and went to OT. During OT while the Pelicans were up 3, coach Alvin Gentry calls NO’s last timeout with 7 seconds to go. Pelicans go to inbound, struggle to get the ball in, and Gentry calls timeout. The Suns go crazy, screaming that the Pelicans don’t have any timeouts left, however Gentry is saved from his own mistake by the refs calling a 5 second violation first. It’s Suns ball, but at least they don’t get to shoot technical FT’s as well.  So the Suns have the ball now, and miraculously Josh Jackson hits an off balance 3 to tie the game at 136-136 with a second left on the clock, seemingly sending the game to 2OT . . . until Alvin Gentry calls a timeout. The refs blow their whistles, call a technical foul on the Pelicans, and Book steps up to hit the game winning FTs with the New Orleans crowd in disbelief. The Suns get the inbound, get the ball in, and the Suns win. It was so egregious at the time I thought Gentry did it on purpose to tank."
"That's great in theory, except that Dallas won't have cap space either. The article makes the point that it doesn't look like anybody really will:  &gt; On Aug. 15, HoopsHype's [Yossi Gozlan](https://twitter.com/YossiGozlan/status/1426990210735173637?s=19) projected that seven teams would have cap space next offseason. Since then, four of those teams have cut into that space significantly. Boston extended several players, Charlotte extended Terry Rozier and signed Kelly Oubre, New Orleans re-signed Josh Hart and Detroit acquired and waived DeAndre Jordan. The remaining three all have meaningful players whose possible extensions could and likely will cut into their space as well: Memphis has Jaren Jackson, San Antonio has Lonnie Walker and Orlando has Mo Bamba and Wendell Carter.   Now it's always possible some teams could shuffle things around to try to open up space for Beal or LaVine, but until that happens it's not much of a bluff on their part to say ""trade me or I'll walk."""
"Jabari Parker, Josh Jackson, to name a few"
"That’s also due to them not drafting well and terrible asset management. They had the 10th pick in the 2004 draft, they could’ve traded that pick plus some players and moved up to get a player drafted before the 10th pick (Igudola could’ve been his Scottie in Cleveland) or they could’ve picked Josh Smith, JR Smith or Jameer Nelson instead of Luke Jackson. Could’ve drafted Paul Millsap in 06."
LeBron KD Kawhi/PG Tatum/Brown Middleton Ingram are all definitely better imo. And I would take Derozan and likely MPJ over him too but MPJ depends on the roster construction.  Like I’ve said Wiggins is far from a bad player he’s not Kwame Brown he’s not Josh Jackson but at this point he is who he is he’s an above average 2 way player boarder line top 10 at his position. A letdown from his expectations and underwhelming as a #1 pick. You don’t take someone #1 hoping for just a solid player
"He was the top prospect for his class for a while, but then hit a snag with back to back injuries.  I just looked his HS class and it looks like a bunch of people in his class had lackluster careers.   1 - Josh Jackson  2 - Harry Giles  3 - Lonzo Ball  4 - Jayson Tayum  (obviously good)    5 - Markelle Fultz"
"&gt; Assuming we consider the top 5 a high pick, darko, Morrison, josh Jackson, Anthony Bennett dragon bender, kris dunn, jahlil okafor Mari hezonja etc were all far worse,  Yo he was a #1 pick, he was trash and in the level of all those other dudes you just mentioned. He was a big reason you guys sucked for a long time, theres a lot of draft busts that wander around the league for years because front offices want to take chances on them. Yall had one of the worst front offices that actually gave him contracts after that pick even."
Not the same as having a broken shot like some of these other guys do like Josh Jackson
That was one of the highest graded Suns pick in a long time. Was seen as a slam dunk no brainer pick unanimously by analysts. Similarly to the Josh Jackson pick.
And Josh Jackson
"One of the worst high picks of the last 20 years? I’m not even a fan of bargs but holy overstatement   Assuming we consider the top 5 a high pick, darko, Morrison, josh Jackson, Anthony Bennett dragon bender, kris dunn, jahlil okafor Mari hezonja etc were all far worse, bargs was a solid player for quite a few years, just not ever first overall pick good"
"I can’t argue against that because the Spurs definitely have a “type” of player that they go for. But it definitely seems like pop is someone whose high on Simmons simply based on a quote he had from last season;   &gt; “It would enhance his game, obviously. That can’t be argued with. But all of his physical skills, basketball skills, the way he understands the game, as unselfish as he is — he’s so elite already, who gives a damn if he can’t shoot.”  I would be straight up lying to you if I said Simmons was a perfect Spurs type player, but at the same time there have been players in that organization and guys they’ve gone after that weren’t exactly that either. Some notable guys being Stephen Jackson, Bruce Bowen, and Richard Jefferson. When talking about guys they tried to get they almost signed Marcus Morris like a year ago, they tried to trade for Kyrie when he was in CLE and almost signed Jason Kidd back in the 2000’s. This is kind of nitpicking but you could even argue guys Parker, Murray and DeRozan don’t fit that to a tee based on their past or off court actions. I think at the end of the day assuming Ben isn’t some James Harden level party animal with a Stephen Jackson level egotistical mindset he could be in a Spurs jersey because talent and on-court play fixes everything.   On top of that I think it’s pretty well documented that San Antonio isn’t afraid to do weird shit or take on Project players it was on display this offseason with them taking Josh Primo in the lottery and paying Zach Collins despite his injuries"
Was it him that had the character issues similar to josh jackson?  I thought I remembered Chriss being a bit of a hothead when he was on the Suns.  I could be wrong but I thought he was an above the rim big with a passable handle on the short roll.
I might put Josh Jackson over Zach Collins cuz he actually plays but that's not saying much
The odds of him becoming an impact player are really low.  Pistons gave him a lot of minutes near the end of the year and he really didn’t show much.    He’s behind Grant and Bey at the 3 and behind Olynk and Lyles at the 4.  Also have Josh Jackson floating around as well.  Just not enough minutes to go around on a guy that’s pretty far behind other guys on the roster.
"Would he have taken Ball? Shit, he might have taken Josh Jackson. Who knows what the madman would have done at the time…?"
Josh Jackson
Josh Allen was at least as good as Brady last year throwing the ball and he can add plays with his legs. Jackson might be a bit of a stretch at the moment but he also doesn’t have the receivers the others do. It’s also worth throwing Russell Wilson in the conversation for QBs who are better than Brady currently.
Best take:mario hezonja and noah vonleh being busts Worst take: jabari parker and josh jackson being stars
"Lmao youre joking with that one. Fuckin Josh Allen and a runningback over Brady??? Bruh Jackson cant even beat the Chiefs in the regular season, how's he supposed to be better than Brady?"
Josh jackson
"Probably from 2015 or maybe 2016 until 2020.  The 2011-2013 years were pretty damn bad but 2016-2019 was an all time low outside of Booker, legitimately our only highlight of 3+ years was an 18 year old find his rhythm. From Sarver, to Mcdonough to the players he drafted. The alex len years, the josh jackson years, the dragan bender years...   2019 we got bridges+ayton and Igor who wasn't the best coach but he was definitely a step up and a step in the right direction from the revolving door of coaches we had before."
dragan fucking Bender  That and having an entire team of guards  That and drafting Josh Jackson over DEARON FOX - WHEN WE NEEDED A PG
"How dense are you? Grizz were a below the cap team, with a majority of rookie and mid level contracts, so they had a lot of cap room and could afford to absorb some of these salaries in order to complete trades. The top 5 players in minutes last season combined for $47M which is almost as much as Curry/Russ/Harden are making this season alone. They don't have any players signed to large contracts yet so the FO has the flexibility to make trades like this and absorb dead contracts, unlike say, the Lakers/Nets would.   There were literally no tax implications and the only thing it did was limit FA signings, which as both a small market that doesn't traditionally attract FAs and as a young roster that wasn't set to compete right away, the Grizzlies realistic targets in FA were very small and the FO decided rather than overspending on mediocre targets they would focus on trading/drafting as their talent acquisition vehicles and have stated as much in interviews. Yes, they have had misses (Winslow, Josh Jackson) but they also have a lot of hits (Melton, Bane, Tillman, Clarke)  Iguodala was actually a fucking heist from our FO. They literally took on Iguodala and a basically unprotected 2024 1st rounder so the Warriors could S&amp;T for Russell and parted with no assets to do that. We insisted on trading Igudola because he refused to join the team in any capacity so they didn't get to work him out or anything, and there was still a trade market for him, as evidenced by Miami trading for him.  Winslow is really unfortunate but cost the Grizzlies nothing but expiring contracts (Iggy, Crowder, Hill) to acquire, so it was a no risk no reward play for a player everyone acknowledges is extremely talented. He was fully healthy and was literally going to make his season debut the day that Covid shut down the NBA. And then the practice before the Bubble started, he dislocated his hip. It sucks but the Grizz took a chance on him and it failed, but cost them no long term assets.  Dieng was an extremely solid backup big for the Grizzlies in 19/20, but in 20/21 we had drafted Tillman who was getting all of his minutes, so he requested to go to another team, so they did him a solid and waived him so he could pursue more playing time elsewhere.  Next time learn the context of moves before just listing salaries and laughing about them. It's a testament to the Grizzlies FO that they were able to field such a competitive team in the West without any major contracts and their highest paid player being Dieng. All while having the 2nd youngest roster in the NBA, their longest tenured player being Dillon Brooks with 4 seasons and retaining all of their future 1sts and acquiring 3 extra 1sts along the way."
"I do wonder if our definition of what's neutral or good is different. To be clear I'm talking about his impact and fact he is a center generally helps that.  I can see your point as well though. While Jokic grades as slight positive on most defensive impact metrics LA-DRAPM does have him as slight negative.  In any case overall I guess it comes down to what you consider neutral defense for example. If you compare him to other anchor big's you could say he's below average, however most anchor big's tend to be above average.  On D-LEBRON his last season (0.61) grades him as around top 75 defender out of 247 players that played over 1000mins that season. This would put him among players like KAT, Jayson Tatum, Maxi Kleber, Montrezl Harrell and Pascal Siakam.   For me I would consider most guys in this 0.3 - 1.0 range to be slight positives on defense. Usually these are players that have at least few notable issues or limitations that stop them from being clear positive, but who also have some strong points and do enough to where you can be fairly certain that at least they aren't hurting their teams on that end. I think alongside of Jokic KAT and Josh Jackson are really good examples of this."
"Hell nah. I don't think we'd do this package for Simmons and I hope we don't make a trade for Simmons. He has a bad attitude and our FO hates that. Yes, we were able to work on Josh Jackson but he was young and willing to work hard for us."
"An underrated misstep was fucking up the 2004 draft.  They had the 10th pick in a loaded draft and they came out of it with Luke Jackson who was a bust.  The 7th pick was Luol Deng, the 9th pick was Andre Iguodala, the Cavs could have tried to move up in the draft.  The 7th pick was the Suns and they basically sold it for cash and a future pick.  It was available.  There was a lot of value in the second half of the first round too.  Josh Smith was the 17th pick.  JR Smith was 18.  Tony Allen and Kevin Martin were in the 20s."
"Buddy’s the biggest stretch to me, maybe you could start like Josh Jackson and use ‘Giddy’ for one and ‘Joshing’ for the other.  That feels kinda cheap though"
"&gt;;Things do get murkier when you get to a 3-4 range like the 2017 of Tatum and Josh Jackson. Or in your case mention of DSJ draft year  .. but the point remains the same that it was applicable to the draft of Tatum and Bridges    That is exactly it tho. I dont think Mike Schmidt is doing an analysis of everyone's pick. Just a few that he considers worthwhile. If Jackson ended up being great and not Tatum, folks would be pretending he was the consensus third pick. Still I could give you that one. Def can't give you bridges though. I remember he was one of the surest shooters in the draft but there were questions if he could defend at an nba level since he was so skinny. Miles, MPJ could definitely be argued to be consensus higher picks. Especially MPJ. Dude could have gone 1"
"Majority of Mocks draft are the general consensus here, and these things are pretty clear when it comes to the lottery guys and top of the draft.   Exhibit A: best player available of 2016 on draft night was Simmons, not Ingram not Brown  Things do get murkier when you get to a 3-4 range like the 2017 of Tatum and Josh Jackson. Or in your case mention of DSJ draft year  .. but the point remains the same that it was applicable to the draft of Tatum and Mikal Bridges.. Even on draft night they always had the best prospect available right before the selection and the little table of 4 people would talk about who should go where and usually it’s Mike Schmidt with the intel and that represents the consensus."
"If you're saying pick the consensus guy at #3, we would've ended up with Josh Jackson lmao"
"SN Nation and majority of mocks had Tatum at 3rd tho. Use r/nbadraft as reference and check the other mocks.  Basketball insiders, bleacher reports all had Tatum at 3rd. It was splitting hair between Tatum and Josh Jackson at 3rd best player of the draft"
"The BPA at 3 in 2017 was Josh Jackson, not Tatum"
"Everyone talks about that trade though.  The first round pick ended up being 14th overall, and the pick swap landed us Fox instead of Josh Jackson"
"I believed in Fultz so much, I was LIVID when we traded that pick. And I really thought they were gonna pick Josh Jackson, who I did not have faith in. The Josh Jackson bit was correct at least."
josh jackson was gonma get all star in 2019
"i thought frank ntilikina would be taller, better passing pat bev and josh jackson a better shooting iguodala"
"A few things:  First, it's hard to know whether Detroit wins their championships without Rodman, but I feel quite comfortable saying Chicago wins with a more traditional All Star type power forward because they did exactly that with Horace Grant. Obviously Rodman replacing Grant wasn't the only difference there. Rodman as a third star may have played a large part in lifting the team to their 72-10 heights, but I don't think he was the difference between a 3peat and zero titles. We're talking about a deep squad with MJ/Pippen/Kukoc here, the GOAT and a top 5-10 player of his era surrounded by great role players.  Furthermore, if the hypothesis is that Rodman's rebounding was his big impact skill, it doesn't really apply to Rodman while Detroit was making the Finals. During their 3 year run, Rodman never even averaged 10 rpg. He didn't have game breaking rebounding numbers really until the 91-92 season when Detroit was a first round out, their run effectively over. That squad was, again, extremely deep and I just don't believe Rodman with his good but not game breaking numbers was the difference between a near 3peat (had IT remained healthy) and no titles at all.  And again, at the peak of his video game rebounding numbers, Rodman was helping San Antonio implode in the playoffs. A first round out in 94, and the embarrassing 95 upset to the 6th seed Rockets. It's popular to pin that on Robinson, or attribute it to Hakeem putting in one of the all time playoff performances, but if Rodman is supposedly this all time impact guy, the Spurs should have had more than enough to at least push that series to 7 games.  I want to take a second to bring up another all time rebounder with an otherwise limited skillset: Andre Drummond. Here is a guy who hasn't \*quite\* rivaled Rodman's numbers, but has come pretty close. His peak of 16 rpg with 5 orpg is not far off Rodman's numbers, but it is very easy to see that Drummond really \*negatively\* impacts winning. Even as a role player in LA last season where you'd expect this central theme of The Case to be applied, it was clear that Drummond was not having any sort of positive impact. And LA eventually lost in the first round.  As for the whole ""in the modern game he'd have the team psychiatrist..."" thing, that's maybe true. But maybe not. It's pretty speculative, and in my view it sort of reduces Rodman's personality to something that can be ""fixed"". That's also ignoring the fact that guys still have issues in the locker room, and still quit on their teams sometimes. We've seen this with guys like Josh Jackson, Kevin Porter, and even with the Ben Simmons situation. Rodman's issues were incredibly deep rooted.  I think Rodman is extremely interesting as a player. He had a very unique impact. But I also think it's easy to misjudge impact simply because he is so unique and interesting. The fact is that Rodman really only ever played on great teams with pantheon level star players. It's tempting to give him a lot of credit for that, but to me that's almost akin to crediting Robert Horry for his 7 championships when really he just played with Hakeem, Shaq, and Tim Duncan."
"Eh. Then you risk of Boston taking Fultz and trying to auction him off to someone else. There’s something to be said about getting your guy, and just looking at the prospects it was evident Fultz was the guy for the Sixers. I don’t know if you remember but we were trying to talk ourselves into Josh Jackson before that point. We were really happy with the trade at the time. And trading away a draft pick isn’t the worst thing in the world to ensure you get your guy"
Josh Jackson got suspended for this as a rookie or sophomore. Doubt Franklin gets anything more than a fine
Josh Jackson got fined $35000 for doing it from a distance to a fan. Rondo should definitely be fined.
That would be Josh Jackson who pointed finger guns at a fan in 2017. It all comes full circle for Suns fans.
Literally no one talks about Josh Jackson
"Couldn't really think of all-time, but for right now, maybe:   Devonte' Graham  Gary Harris  Josh Jackson  Marvin Bagley III  Andre Drummond"
"Exactly, i didn’t get it at all. At least have him struggle. Lavine is capable of taking games over all by himself, and that’s exactly what he did because Casey let him. So so strange. Grant, Josh Jackson, Saddiq Bey, even Killian would’ve done better.   Instead Casey had our best perimeter defender in Grant guard Patrick Williams all game, as if he’s any sort of offensive threat. Smh."
I haven't watched him play much. Has Josh Jackson always been Dikembe Mutombo's son and heir?
Previously had not noticed that Josh Jackson is kind of adorbs
josh jackson goated
Has Josh Jackson arrived?
"if you listen to McDonough every good pick was McDonough's idea and every bust was Sarver's idea. He's quick to point out that he drafted Booker and Ayton but is pretty quiet about Alex Len, Tyler Ennis, Dragan Bender, trading up with Bogdan Bogdanovic for Marquese Chriss, Tyler Ulis, Josh Jackson, and Elie Okobo. McD was even sniping the Mikal Bridges pick saying he wanted to get Sahi instead when bridges had his shooting hitch but now is suddenly all in on Mikal now that hes proven to be one of the best 2 way wings in the league. You cant trust anything this guy says about the suns  His tenure oversaw the absolute worst period of history for a franchise that had never been a bottom dweller but if you listen to the guy on twitter youd think hes a genius. Its pretty damning that the team was turned into a finals contender two years after he was fired with 80% roster turnover."
"What we should be asking is, ""Is Josh Jackson lying?""   What Ben Simmons could or should be doing is beside the point.   Right now, he is a bitch and he should STFU."

"I’m going to go with just a promising year. Also, a surprise leap from Josh Jackson."
"Yup. Most of the really good defensive guards have a crazy wingspan. Makes contesting shots and getting deflections that much easier.   Josh Okogie has a 7'0 wingspan, but is only 6'4. Reggie Jackson is 6'3 with a 7'0 wingspan. Jrue Holiday is 6'3 with a 6'7 wingspan. Etc."
"Cade is going to be as good as he was advertised pre-draft. Somehow, as soon as the draft ended and Cade became a Piston, everyone became a hot take artist that Jalen Green is better and Mobley will also be better. About 1/4 of the way into the season, he will start running point full-time and we will move Hayes to the bench for josh Jackson or diallo."
"&gt;  finishing between Josh Jackson and Isaac Okoro.  and also tied with Domantas Sabonis. I think this is a bit disingenuous, bad players can shoot free throws well, good players can shoot them poorly."
"It's not full-blown bad, but it is below league average (77.8% in 20/21 and no lower than 76.6% the past five seasons). And he dropped to 72.8% while shooting more FTs last season, which isn't a good look.  It's fair to ask a star guard to improve their below average FT shooting after a season in which they were the NBA's 89th best FT shooter, finishing between Josh Jackson and Isaac Okoro."
The grizzlies got Josh Jackson paid and usable. They def have the infrastructure to develop some talent. Hopefully it pans out
Josh Jackson for the Pistons.
"I mean.. I saw some scouting reports that had him going like 7th or whatever, but.. the more respected sites for mock drafts and such always had him in the top 4 at least. Idk about universally, it wasn't really a stretch that Boston took him. He deff had some question marks, but there weren't mental red flags and people praised his intellect on and off the court. Unlike other athletic wings who couldn't shoot like Josh Jackson in recent years."
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
"I think fans are too hard on the Sixers front office since Hinkie just because it hasn't all clicked - they could've maybe done better but it wasn't the disaster some make it out to be.    Jimmy Butler and Harris were both acquired for extremely little, especially in retrospect.  They fucked up not keeping Butler, but it doesn't even seem like that was their fault so much as Butler's choice to go to Miami.  And Harris was getting maxed by somebody - letting him walk assuming someone else came through was no sure thing.  &gt; I don't think you can assume anything about Hinkie taking Fultz.  It's a *much* better assumption than the alternative.  Fultz was widely considered the #1 prospect and the only other guy in that range would've been Josh Jackson, who looks even worse.  Maybe Hinkie doesn't pull the dumb trade, but that extra pick was only #14."
"&gt; the process worked great, but it ended with Hinkie resignation.  That's just not a fair statement.  You can say the process was abandoned, or incomplete, or whatever.  But it sure as hell didn't prove that it worked yet.    Hinkie's draft picks weren't exactly great (Noel, MCW, Okafor).  And even the two that hit (Embiid, Simmons) have not exactly been flawless victories - Embiid can't play a full season and is a ticking injury timebomb in this league, while we all know about Simmons warts.  Realistically Hinkie ends up drafting Fultz anyway.  In that parallel universe the Celtics take Tatum 1, Ball 2.  Then it's either Fultz or Josh Jackson for the Sixers at 3.  So there's another likely bust of a pick.  Then who is to say what moves he makes in trades or free agency and how those all play out.  Bottom line - it's WAY too easy to just say ""the process worked until they got rid of Hinkie"", because what Hinkie did was the easy part.  The hard part was turning all those picks into a winning team."
"Focus on the Ignite players that will get drafted, but let the other teams submit vids on their 2 ways and other interesting guys. Like Josh Jackson a couple years ago on the Grizz-Hustle.  But create interest in the drama and uncertainty of the players that have a chance in the NBA, and best on court highlights.  Over time maybe that builds interest in actual games."

"Lol fair. Yeah I loved LaMelo but was lukewarm on Luka. This stuff is hard af to predict. Like I thought Luka would be good but anyone saying they knew he would be this good this quick is just lying. I think missing on Luka made me overcorrect to love Melo.   I still think if we went back to draft night the arguments for Ayton vs. Luka are valid. With hindsight it's more black and white (for now at least, injuries and development could still change their trajectories.) But on draft night there was valid uncertainty. Also Ayton was the much safer pick. 7 footer with no injury history and athletically blessed. Luka was just such a wildcard, similar to James Harden and.. LaMelo. I don't really know what point I'm trying to make other than I don't think it's fair to hammer GMs over picks like Ayton over Luka cause Ayton is still good.   That same GM picked Josh Jackson over Fox and would've picked him over Tatum I think, which is much more atrocious to me but never gets mentioned. Imagine a Fox/Booker/Ayton/Bridges core."
No Josh Jackson slander will be tolerated.   For real though he's been solid for us.
I’m looking forward to the next article someone writes about “saving” or “reinventing” Josh Jackson.  Some fringe NBA guys just don’t understand they can ball in Europe and still make 100k+. That’s a pretty sweet gig if you’re okay living internationally.
"Sad about Josh Jackson. He looked very promising defensively, had all the tools to become an elite defensive player."
"Too early but I’m liking our bench of   Cory Joseph  Josh jackson Hamidou Diallo Trey Lyles Kelly Olynyk  3 of these guys shoot the three at a solid % while Cojo is good at running the unit along with both Josh and Hami being good cutters and defenders. Not to mention Cojo, Lyles and KO got good synergy being they played for the Canadian National team."
I was damn high on Alex Ken and Josh Jackson
"Blake before he left asked for the ball too much despite not being in good enough condition.  After that it’s a tie for Saddiq, Jerami, and Josh Jackson since they all had periods of time where they were looking for theirs. Expected of a bad team though"
"Jayhawk fans in shambles.  Good thing we landed star wings like: Andrew Wiggens, Kelly Oubre Jr. and Josh Jackson instead.       /s"
"Many players shoot 50% from 2. I’ll use the lineup for the Pistons which were the worst team in the league last year.  Mason Plumlee: 63% 2pt / 0% 3pt  Jerami Grant: 47% 2pt / 35% 3pt  Saddiq Bey: 45% 2pt / 38% 3pt  Wayne Ellington: 52% 2pt/ 42% 3pt  Delon Wright: 52% 2pt/ 35% 3pt  Josh Jackson: 49% 2pt/ 30% 3pt  From the Pistons, we see that half the starting lineup shot 50% for 2 pointers. When you factor in drawing fouls, 50% 2 pointers is worth more than 33% 3 pointers as well."
"I just want Detroit to swing a deal for a dependable big man who is a tough rebounder. Easier said than done, I know.  I think at the moment we're projecting a bench power forward combination of Josh Jackson and Trey Lyles. Yikes. Today's game against San Antonio was good but there were more than a few plays where boards went begging because of a lack of hustle."
The sub is a circlejerk and anything anti-Ben Simmons will be eaten up by the same groups of people looking to farm karma off their “Ben Simmons wouldn’t even dunk on trae young lolol” take. Even a 7 month old clip of fucking josh Jackson calling Simmons a bitch got upvoted to the front page: if that doesn’t tell you this entire sub is a circlejerk idk what will
"Kawhi is a once in a generation talent, you dont just find one.  Think of all the misses of so called ""Next Kawhi""  Stanley Johnson, Josh Jackson, and more.  We might not ever see another Kawhi type player"
[Shades of Josh Jackson](https://streamable.com/kx1g1)
Brady is 100% better than Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson and his knowledge of the game makes up for his lack of athleticism at his age. He is easily up there with the three you listed. I used PFF to show that advanced stats say he’s the best quarterback this year just to further the point that he is still top tier.

Josh Jackson just cause
"Detroit seems very unlikely to be a trade partner as well. We aren't moving Cade Cunningham and do we really wanna give up Grant, Hayes, and Josh Jackson for a max salary nonshooter?"
Josh Jackson one of the biggest busts of the last 10 years lmao.

I'll take the bitch over Josh Jackson still.
Who is josh jackson lol
Josh Jackson with no respect for a young socialite smh
I love Josh Jackson
Wtf I love josh Jackson now
TL:DR - OP is a Josh Jackson dicksucker and sees him as a saint.
"Josh Jackson will take any shot anytime. Therefore Jackson &gt; Simmons. You miss 100% of the shots you never take, Ben."
Josh Jackson
"Would josh jackson dunk on trae? If yes, then josh jackson &gt; Ben Simmons."
Detroit Pistons version of Josh Jackson on this Sixers team with a true PG goes to the ECF? No doubt no doubt no doubt. At least the motherfucker will let it fly and get hot once in a while.
josh nobody jackson shouldnt be saying anything lmao
Wait this video is the reason why “fuck Josh Jackson”? It should be something else
Now I’m a josh Jackson fan
"Josh Jackson is better than Ben Simmons, and it’s not even close"
[fuck josh jackson](https://youtu.be/3arGL2zN8E0)  he also scratched the hell out of Zachs neck and he had a mark for the next 3 months
Suddenly i'm a Josh Jackson fan
See no lies here. Josh Jackson &gt; Ben Simmons.
Josh Jackson to Philly. Morey is just gonna ask for Cade+Grant+4 FRP swap at least.
Josh Jackson is a true philosopher
Lol Josh Jackson did that last year: https://youtu.be/JnkM476p_5g
Had to look up Josh “drafted 1 spot after Tatum” Jackson to see if he was still in the league. Still clinging on!
Josh Jackson..the actor
"maybe to you. I am actually surprised bc the suns just became good overnight. To me, he and DA make the past 10 years worth it. The morris brothers felony assault, josh jackson, dragan bender and marquese chriss, the corpse of tyson chandler, etc."
"I’m not here to say we aren’t the worst, but I would like to throw in consideration for the 2016 and 2017 drafts for the Phoenix Suns. With two top 10 picks in 2016, they drafted Dragan Bender at 4 (in front of Jamal Murray and Buddy Hield) and Marquese Chriss at 8 (in front of Sabonis). In 2017, with the 4th pick, they selected Josh Jackson in front of DeAaron Fox,  Bam Adebayo and many other players that have been more notable. Those Kings picks in 2011 and 2012 are still worse IMO because the talent in each drafted was better than 2016, though blowing two top 10 picks in one draft and then missing on Jackson in 2017 is a very rough go."
"Lonzo, Fultz, Josh Jackson I think will all be better in their later years"
2016 - Jaylen Brown for Dragan Bender  2017 - Jayson Tatum for Josh Jackson  2018 - Robert Williams for Jacob Evans   Fucking yikes.
Josh Jackson
"SEVENTEEN. WINS. IN. A. ROW. IGNORE US NOW!!!! Ties the Suns franchise record for longest win streak. 17th highest win streak in NBA history, 6th longest since 2010.   Mikal and Ayton did a damn amazing job on Curry all night, holy shit. Ayton deserves at least 2nd team all defense, but Mikal deserves to be in the top 3 for DPOY at the LEAST. Dude is coming off locking up Harden, and turns around and makes Steph’s night hell. He’s legitimately become one of the 3 best perimeter defenders in the league, at absolute worst… while also being an absurdly efficient ~14 points a night guy.  Ayton played like a star all night, how fucking wonderful having 3 legitimate star level players is. The days of Josh Jackson 3rd options are far, far behind us. I have 0 doubt Ayton can do this against 90% of the front courts in the league consistently… we just rarely need him to, like we did tonight.   Booker, take my hamstrings😭 Please be okay.   I will have nightmares of first quarter Jordan Poole tonight, wtaf"
"2 draft years of Josh Jackson, Dragan Bender got redeemed with 1 year of Drafting Ayton and Bridges"
"they just need to relocate at this point. they've been doing shit like this ever since lebron was drafted. they let boozer walk away for nothing while being a rfa. they signed larry hughes over ray allen or michael redd. didn't want to trade jj hickson for prime amare stoudemire or iguodala. didn't want to trade kevin love for paul george in 2018 or they could have traded kyrie for middleton and bledsoe instead of getting isaiah thomas and  a bunch of make a wish kids. not to mention drafting luke jackson infront of josh smith and kevin martin. drafted dajaun wagner over amare stoudemire and caron butler. also drafting dasagna diop over joe johnson, zach randolph, richard jefferson and gilbert arenas. traded jamal crawford for chis mihm. drafting anthony bennett. the whole franchise is a joke"
"I'm a long time Mavs fan, Reunion Arena, pre-Cuban, Three Js era (Jamal Mashburn, Jason Kidd (young Jason Kidd), Jim Jackson). I'm not of the belief we haven't tried... but every move we've made has been bad. KP is a better player than he gets credit for, but, of course, is injury prone. Josh Richardson forgot basketball. Bullock has forgotten basketball. Rick, while a great coach, has always been stubborn. And it blew up.  We suck at drafting. Before the Luka/Brunson draft, the last rotation quality player we drafted AND kept was Josh Howard... in 2003. I want Luka to succeed and succeed with us. But this is year four and we seem to only be going backwards. If we put Luka up for trade, we might get one of the most insane halls in NBA history - assuming anyone can actually give us something that could pan out. You'll never win a trade where you give up a superstar, but we've seen recently many teams get some pretty good deals.  I just don't see a way you fix this with Luka and KP on maxes and Jalen about to be a FA. Fellow Mavs fans will hate me saying it, but it is something to really talk about."
"they had LaVine and also just drafted Markkanen as hot prospect  Grant got signed into a team that had washed up Griffin, rookie Bey and Josh Jackson as best players + Rose who got traded soon"
"Josh Smith, Monta Ellis, Al Jefferson, Richard Jefferson, Stephen Jackson, Al Harrington, Kevin Martin"
It's literally his name. Does Josh Giddey need to be Joshua Giddey cause there's already a Josh Jackson in the league? Lol
"Yeeaahhhh he’s bad.   Josh Jackson is one too, but he’s more frustrating than anything. All within the span of one minute he’ll play great D, force a bad shot, rebound, run the floor…and then miss a wide open dunk. He’s always one step forward, two steps back. Anytime Jackson has a good play, I just wait for the inevitable terrible one coming up."
"Duh, everyone knows the best way to develop young talent is to be one of the worst teams of all time with zero veteran leadership and poor coaching. That's why so many of the Sun's young players from 2015 to 2018 developed into All-stars.  You know, those household names Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss, Tyler Ullis, Josh Jackson, Alan Williams, and plenty of others that run the league to this day."
"Mental health is a serious thing, especially for someone who is still so young.  I've definitely done some career limiting thing to my boss at his age, and I am doing just fine now. Just hope someone give him a chance and he can turn it around. We did it for Josh Jackson, he will never reach his potential, but he is having a career in the league."
Ready for Detroit to trade for him. Josh Jackson or diallo and trey lyles maybe a second rounder. We need more young size to go with our young guards
"Tyler Ulis, Isaiah Canaan, Okobo, Rookie and 2nd year versions of Josh Jackson, Chriss and Bender with the corpse of Tyson Chandler out there.  The team was disgusting, if not for Book we'd have been competing for the worst record in league history."
"1. Cade  2. Grant  3. Bey  4. Stewart  5. Killian  6. Dialo  7. Josh Jackson  8. Kelly Olynk  Saben Lee, could take Josh's spot. I'm undecided there"
"13 straight!!!!! This one…. whew. Why is it always the Spurs??? Lets get back to blowing teams out, plz  Having Deandre Ayton, someone who can be the best player of a game on any given night, be the 3rd best player on your team… whew. The days of 3rd option Josh Jackson are far, far behind us now. Love the aggression of DA tonight, fantastic back to back games out of the big fella.  When Booker is hitting his 3s like he did tonight and playing defense like he did tonight, he’s a top 10 player. It’s really that simple.  The individual players on this team have been so damn inconsistent this year, yet we have consistently gotten 4-5 good performances every single game, which is all you can ask for. Mikal was an absolute nothing all game until the 4th, glad he finally woke up. This was one of CP3’s worst games of the season imo, when he’s not distributing well while not looking to score in the first 3 quarters, he becomes a negative. Luckily that won’t happen much. Cam J shot poorly, but he’s been on fire recently and played good d, so he gets a pass.   Cam Payne is finally starting to find his groove, and oh boy is that nice. As reliable and safe feeling as the starting lineup is, I love the run and gun style we play with Cam at point. Feel like it’s perfect for how many amazing off ball threats we have, and when Cam is hitting his jumpshots it’s as formidable as any starting lineup.   The additions of McGee and Shamet continue to show themselves to be legit. Another off ball threat and a rim running finisher, couldn’t have asked for much else… other than a small ball 5 please and thank you."
Josh Jackson tells otherwise
"Isaiah just lost it and fired a 5 lb. plate at Lebron. He missed way high and hit veteran center Trey Lyles in the back of the head. He had no idea what hit him. Isaiah actually felt pretty bad about it; Jerami Grant thought it was hysterical. Lyles was out cold and we had no idea what to do. Corey [Joseph], Saddiq, and Josh Jackson carried him to a massage table and laid him face down so anyone who saw him would just think he was waiting to get a massage. I had about 20 or 25 extra headbands in my locker so I just started wrapping those around Trey’s head to try to stop the bleeding."
"I mean we're tanking so fine, but this loss is squarely on Casey. He let the Lakers come back from down 13 without any of our best players on the court. Of course fucking Cory Joseph and Josh Jackson are going to blow that lead, and Casey wanted it to happen. No serious coaching attempt would let that lineup stay out there without even calling a timeout."
You can't convince me Casey didn't try to lose this game. That horrible CoJo/Josh Jackson lineup let the Lakers go like +10 before Casey decided to do something.
"More informed speculation can be offered if we knew if he wanted to come back? What kind of shape is he in? Were or are there any conditions his side is placing on coming back? Would he accept the Josh Jackson treatment (going to a team to rebuild his reputation by being willing to play in the G League)? Would he go to any team?  The more conditions his side is refusing, the less likely he will have a come back."
Is josh jackson not enough?? If i recall he’s your first option before drafting cade
"From what I know definitely not, for a few reasons:  - Pistons organization views Jerami Grant as a centrepiece - rejected three first round picks last deadline  - Pistons also view Saddiq Bey as a centrepiece, calling him part of the “Core 4”  - Pistons can’t trade any firsts as its currently owed to OKC  - Theyre trying to tank this year, and they’re angling to free up cap space for 2023/2024 off-seasons  - Organization keeps speaking about “character” and how talent doesn’t matter if their character isn’t what they’re looking for   - Theyre building around Cade Cunningham as the franchise star   But I’ll say, Weaver hasn’t been afraid to make moves (traded literally everyone on the roster, Killian’s the longest tenured Piston) and he loves taking chances on highly drafted players that need fresh starts (Okafor, Josh Jackson, Trey Lyles, Dennis Smith Jr, rumors of Bagley).   He also makes calls to every team about everything so even if this “interest” was true he was prolly doing due diligence."
"Zo was a top 3 pick in that draft, y’all just made it easier for Celtics to choose the leftover.  Josh Jackson and Fox was 4 and 5 respectively"
I feel so bad for that kid wearing the Josh Jackson Suns jersey
"Reddish runs really hot and cold.   If you catch him on a good night, you can easily see the Paul George potential comparison. If you catch him on a bad night, he looks like a Josh Jackson or RHJ.  Honestly he takes the offense out of rhythm too frequently for my liking."
"There’s the end to end speed and there’s explosive first step of quick burst of speed I’m not gonna dive deep into who has what too much but   PG: it used to be Rose, Westbrook and Wall. Now its def Morant at the fastest guy, Dearon Fox even if he looks slower this year, Shroder, Ish Smith  SG: Lavine and Jalen Green, Anthony Edward built different  SF: I guess it’s still LeBron, Kuminga kinda looks like he has that quick burst too although we haven’t seen too much of that yet. Josh Jackson was projected to be that type of athlete and elite slasher but he never seems to put it together.  PF: Giannis and his long limb and long strides are just ridiculous  Zion quick burst of first step, he’s not the fastest over the full court length but within like 2-3 of space he can move lightning quick   Pascal Siakam is fluidly fast as well in open court, Draymond has pretty good speed leading fast break and quick burst on his short roll  C: AD, Embiid, Bam.. although AD and Embiid are unicorns just fluidly smooth and fast at their size and weights."
Only if we get Josh Jackson back.  /s
"More impressive considering at one point in this game, he was out there with Luka Garza, Frank Jackson, Trey Lyles, and Josh Jackson. None of those guys should be in a 9 man NBA rotation."
"Good: Bey, Cunningham playing great, CoJo barely playing.  Bad: Jeremi fucking Grant, Hayes, Isaiah missing a lot of wide open layups, zero effort on D and Josh Jackson.  On to next!  Fuck Casey for benching Diallo, trying to ""teach him a lesson""."
Josh Jackson out here finally proving he's the GOAT
Scottie Barnes/Patrick Williams/Deandre Hunter/JJJ/Josh Jackson   Franz Wagner/Obi Toppin/Jaxson Hayes/Collin Sexton/Frank Ntilikina
Redemption city.  Yeah that’s us.   Some of these busts are just young. Josh Jackson has been nice for us
If Josh Jackson could learn to hit 3's he'd immediately become a $17 mill a year level player. As is though he's still very good value for a big wing defender who can score and pass it a bit.
Josh Jackson looked like an athletic freak in college but so undersized in the NBA.
Please do it I want bagel man. Take Josh Jackson
"For real tho. Weaver’s acquired Dennis Smith Jr, Josh Jackson, Jahlil Okafor, Trey Lyles, now Bagley - give me ALL the busts"
"They also have Josh Jackson, who did the same"
"Looking at their roster, not even sure what the kings would want that Detroit would be willing to part with. Maybe Josh Jackson?"
Best aspect is the defense looks solid snd the guys seem to like each other a good bit. Cade's also been living up to the hype since the teams clearly better when he's on the court.  Worst aspect is our bench defense being terrible  outside of Josh Jackson and we've been shooting historically bad even though we aren't even taking bad shots.
"I thought Josh Jackson was going to be the next Andre Iguodala. Was never too excited about Bender. I also thought Tyler Ulis could be a very solid backup and spot starter in this league, that was silly af of me to think that."
"The fact that Book was able to lead a team that had Josh Jackson, Tyler Ulis, Dragan Bender, and Marquise Chriss to a 20 win season is quite the accomplishment."
"Search threads on Dennis Smith Jr, Josh Jackson and Frank Ntkilina"
"patty mills, maybe andrew bogut at some point.  josh jackson, josh hart, josh richardson, etc etc.."
"If Josh Jackson could swap his brain with anyone on Earth 20 minutes before game time,  he would be a 10 time league MVP… he unfortunately  cannot and has Josh Jackson’s brain permanently (for now)"
"If Josh Jackson could swap his brain with anyone on Earth 20 minutes before game time,  he would be a 10 time league MVP… he unfortunately  cannot and has Josh Jackson’s brain permanently (for now)"
This guy comes across as a super bitch. Team him up with Josh Jackson and see how they go together.
"I watched Kansas games night in night out at the time because I like college basketball and because I am a phoenix suns fan and my team was awful at the time so I watched all the ""top"" prospects a lot. I understand it might feel like hindsight but like I said on draft night I knew we waisted the pick when we took him. I remember swearing up a storm with my friends I was watch the draft with that year. I wanted fox, Lonzo or OG Anunoby that year, Particularly OG. As I said at the time OG is what people think josh Jackson is. Before he was injured his sophomore year OG moved up as high as 7th on draft boards and if he hadn't tore his ACL he would have went top 5 instead of falling to 23rd or whatever it was.  and I knew OG was likely not gonna play most if not all his rookie year so we would have gotten a quality player and been able to tank again for luka. Sadly enough we got the 2018 #1 pick and didn't take luka. I'm not some amazing draft expert who is right all the time. Like everyone I get some things right and somethings wrong. But I was 100% right on pretty much everything in that 2017 draft class. It was probably my best draft year and thats unlikely to change anytime soon. I wasn't a believer in Markell though I thought he would be better than he is. I did believe in Tatum though I didn't think he was gonna be quite as good as he is. The only real thing in that class I didn't have the right read on was that I wasn't a Donovan Mitchell believer. Thought he would be a ok rotation guy.   And now that I basically put out all of my best draft takes ever here are some of my wrong takes so you know I am not just doing hindsight stuff. I believed Dragan bender was gonna be a star. I thought Jalen Brown was an awful pick at 3. I thought buddy hield was too old (that one taught me a good lesson). I thought Bamba was better than ayton. That one might still end up being true long term with how bamba has looked to start the year but its extremely unlikely if we are being honest about it. I fell too in love with sexton after the 3 on 5 game and had him over Trae. I wasn't a lemelo ball believer.   As for your point on the break. I believe Jackson is a better athlete then MacLemore and was in college. I am not arguing that he wasn't a monster on the break. He was at his best when he was borderline playing out of control. Which is how the fast break is played. its fast and there is space to make plays because there aren't 10 players at 1 end of the floor. The issue isn't nba schemes its that he can't be out of control and be successful in the nba because guys will take a charge or in the half court he will turn it over. I unfortunately have watch Jackson play in too many nba games than I wish to have seen him play in and his problem (at least when he was with the suns) isn't that he's overthinking. its that he isn't thinking at all. He is always trying to be that borderline out of control guy when the ball is in his hands. he almost wants to create controlled chaos. But he can't do that in the half court because teams are too smart, too athletic, and too disciplined for him to really let him create that kind of problem for them. And while he isn't the worst defender or even really a bad defender at all he can't consistently create enough turnovers to make his fast break skills a consistent asset for him. not to mention as the clip shows, he is a sub par finisher around the rim for nba standards"
Y’all’s hate for Harden has clouded your vision. Josh Jackson is hand checking Harden. It’s a foul.
Unpopular opinion - Josh Jackson has his hand on Hardens chest/shoulder trying to slow him down which is a foul. Harden going up for a shot and hooking the defenders arm is the only way to draw attention to him getting fouled.
"Killian is shooting 40% from 3 this year, if he played and started over Josh Jackson, they might well have won. He shoots a lot better off the ball, and his passing was always his bread and butter"
That’s Phx suns legend Josh Jackson….wait
Thats the Josh Jackson I know
Wtf Josh Jackson reached in first lol. Y’all really hate harden.
That’s the Josh Jackson we know and love here in Phoenix!
how is that not a foul on josh jackson
"A rookie coming off one of the longest basketball-less stretches of his life starts off cold playing with Josh Jackson, Trey Lyles, and Frank the Tank 3.0? BUST, I TELL YOU, BUST!"
Trying his best to one up the Josh Jackson play
"I argued that Josh Richardson would give the Sixers ~75% of what Jimmy Butler gave them on the day of the sign and trade that brought Richardson to Philly.   That was up there with ""Josh Jackson is the best prospect in the 2017 draft"" and ""The RW/PG13/Melo Thunder are comparable to the 2016 Thunder on paper"" in my personal Hall of Bad Takes."
Josh Jackson
Did not want to go up against Josh Jackson juggernaut.
I love Josh Jackson jumping up off the bench here!
Lol Josh Jackson
Wiseman the bust? Kuminga who is a huge gamble and could be another Josh Jackson? They've been trying for the past 2 years to create a package for a star and nobody wants their shit
Ngl I was burned by Josh Jackson being a bust and Cam Reddish being in that archetype spooked me. Hope he does end up being really good.
"The scottie barnes shooting 22% from three? That scottie barnes? His middy has been falling, but i wouldn't say he can shoot yet lol  Scottie's good even tho he can't shoot tho, other guys like Josh Jackson, Stanley Johnson... not so much. I'd say guys like OG and siakam are better examples from the raps alone, even tho siakam isn't a wing"
I like how we run plays for Frank Jackson and Josh Jackson but not Cade.
Why are the commentators bigging up Josh Jackson as a threat lol
Always wondered what happened to Josh Jackson. Now I know
Come on now a lot of mock drafts had Lonzo at 2 and some Josh Jackson over Taum at 3 too
I first started actually following basketball the year Josh Jackson was drafted. Went to my first game ever and had a choice between a Josh Jackson shirt and a Booker shirt. I was young and naive
"I always think that you need to evaluate a pick relative to the players who could have been picked in that spot. There's always going to be someone better taken way deeper in the draft, but the point is usually that NOBODY saw that guy coming.  Most of the time teams are, in practice, choosing between 3-5 players. So the question is, was the guy taken better than the next 3-5 guys taken?  So with Kendall Marshall, both John Henson and Mo Harkless had better careers, and they were the next two picks. That makes it a clear bad pick. (IN fact, four of the next five picks had better careers. Oof.)  On the other hand, Alex Len - you look at the next few picks, and they're not clearly better than Alex Len by a large margin until you get to CJ McColumn. So you say he wasn't worthy of the #5 pick but that's actually fairly typical return for a #5 pick: solid rotation guy, nothing special. So that's not a bad pick.   TJ Warren went two picks ahead of Nurkic, but was better than the other guys around there. Solid pick.  Devin Booker was picked ahead of a bunch of other decent players, which makes that pick look ever better. Lots of plausible picks and they got the best one!  Dragan Bender, OTOH, is an awful pick. The guys taken after him (Dunn, Hield, Murray, Chriss, Poetl) are all better.   And Josh Jackson is more borderline than I think you're giving them credit for. D'Aaron Fox, Johnathan Issac, Lauri Markinnen, Frank Nkitolina, Dennis Smith, Jr? Josh is neither the best nor the worst of those players. Going to the G-league as a rookie isn't a bit deal for a young guy. He look to have the makings of a serviceable backup big.  2018 obviously they should have taken Luka.   2019 since they must have drafted for the trade, hard to evaluate based on thee quality of the player.   And with Smith they could have had Haliburton ... and now they declined his option? Wow. Yeah. Huge mistake.  So there are a couple of howlers there, but also some of those picks aren't as bad as they look."
"That face when Alex Len is 100x more valuable than the 4 other top-10 picks (Jalen Smith \[10\], Josh Jackson \[4\], Dragan Bender \[4\], Marquese Chriss \[7\]) in the past 15 years the Suns have had combined.  Apparently the Suns just need to draft in the low-teens from now on.  * Cam Johnson -- 11th pick 2019 * Devin Booker -- 13th pick 2015 * TJ Warren -- 14th pick 2014 * Kendall Marshall -- 13th pick 2012  (Fucking eww, never knew why we did this) * Markieff Morris -- 13th pick 2011 (Even with him being a dickhead, he's still a serviceable NBA player) * Earl Clark -- 14th pick 2009 (We held out hope for so long on him) * Robin Lopez -- 15th pick 2008 (We bitched about him so much until we lost him and had Len as a starter, who we bitched about until we lost him and had continuous garbage as starters until Ayton)"
My buddy always told me he was the real asset of that trade for Josh Jackson. He was right

You can tell which guys will improve when they’re like Barnes with elite athletic measurables combined with IQ and passing. It’s lazy to think everyone is the next Josh Jackson. Those guys have 0 vision and their 2 way potential and athleticism was always overrated.
Barnes has unprecedented size and athleticism combined with IQ and passing at his position. The fake “next Kawhi” guys that don’t pan out are usually guys who are one dimensional and have no vision like Josh Jackson. I could tell that Barnes would be effective in the league when i scouted him before the draft. Some guys just aren’t good at college ball but can thrive in the nba.
"Josh Jackson might never live up to being a #4 pick but he has been a good contributor for us and makes a lot of smart, quick decisions. He has definitely been working to improve his playmaking and consistency, and he’s been in the top 10 plays twice already this season with big time blocks."
Seeing good Josh Jackson on this run
Classic josh Jackson string of events
Yes he did draw a technical foul on Embiid by getting taunted after getting dunked on though.   Could have been huge if Embiid got another T when Josh Jackson grabbed his jersey and slapped his face twice.
I still love Josh Jackson.
"Josh Jackson is gonna be out the league in a few seasons, again"
jo got a tech for talking to the crowd josh jackson got in two fouls in 2 seconds and thats the same
I love Josh Jackson.
Josh Jackson a bitch
Larry Nance is another sleeper. Gonna need more consistency from Josh Jackson but dudes looking like a fantasy stud as well.
Josh Jackson is REALLY nice though
"This just shows how much /r/NBA watches us lol. Grant has looked really, really good, and Plumlee looks like a starting C. Only thing I can maybe blame Weaver on so far is stretching Dedmon, but that's so minor. He also signed Josh Jackson who looks really good, and our rookies look pretty good."
I’m super jealous of Fox if that helps. We took Josh Jackson over him.
Forgot that Josh Jackson was selected ahead of Fox lol
"Funny story...my college made the Big Dance for the first time ever in school history and they played Kansas in the first round. After the game, Josh Jackson asked my buddy on the team if they wanted to smoke DURING THE NCAA TOURNAMENT saying that they don’t really drug test players. I am definitely not shocked by how Josh Jackson can’t seem to elevate his game after getting drafted. I knew he was a huge red flag prospect when he got drafted after hearing that story."
"yep me too, dude is the player Josh Jackson was supposed to be."
"I'm the last person whose gonna apologize for Weavers mistakes. I'm in the camp of, he's great for the draft...but probably bad at everything else. I mean you seen the contracts he was dishing out (Grant at 20mill &amp; Mason at 8mill) when he could have kept Wood (even if we overpaid) and still kept Josh Jackson as well (to fill in for the Grant role). You saw the trades he made (bringing in Delon Wright and trading four 2nds and Kennard for Bey) and now we see the results of his moves...which is more taking. But it feels more like accidental tanking, that purposefully."
Plus I think the Pistons wanted Josh Jackson more than Wood.
"Can't be too critical, draft is always hard. Murray and Johnson both on 29th picks is a pretty good haul, even if Samanic is a miss.  Phoenix picked in top 5 two years in a row and they got Josh Jackson and Dragan Bender."
"I totally forgot about the Josh Jackson thing, I will make that statue if they don’t"
Josh Jackson is looking nice too. Many people had written him off but he's playing well with his new opportunity. Maybe he'll have a Christian Wood-esque revival in Detroit too.
"Dude if we're 3 then I want a statue of James Jones outside of the arena, carrying around cases of Dos Equis like he had to when Josh Jackson no-showed a meet and greet. I think the playoffs will happen but holy shit I would be ecstatic."
"It's really not that bad? We've been losing by blowing 4th Q leads, we aren't non-competitive. 2 of the 3 first Rounders showing up, Josh Jackson &amp; Grant doing well with their extended roles. Plumlee's bleh and Blake can't move anymore but other than that I don't hate seeing anyone on the floor like I have with previous teams"
"We had so many good looks but just couldn't hit anything, the whole team was tired in the last three mins. GG Pistons, glad to see Josh Jackson playing well."
In b4 Josh Jackson puts up 30
"Also Shai as well, that draft class was stacked. I feel your pain though, having taken Josh Jackson who was sandwiched between Tatum and Fox/Isaac was brutal, the draft can be a bastard"
Stew and Josh Jackson😤
"Probably was with the knicks. Josh Jackson suddenly looked like an nba player in a pistons uniform, maybe they're hoping for the same from DSJ"
The Pistons now have Josh Jackson and Dennis Smith Jr Detroit definitely won the 2017 draft.
Josh Jackson
"Ah yes the two stars of Grant and Plumlee with the depth of Delon, Josh Jackson, and the corpse of Blake Griffin are comparable to the Nets without KD lol"
I’ll have nightmares of Josh Jackson and Jerami Grant for a long time
"he still has his bad shooting nights, but I expect his 3pt % to stabilize at 33% by seasons end... at 4+ attempts... so can be better... but fits todays game.  Its his energy, defense and willingness to pass that will help him get a nice contract. Casey needs to show Jackson videos of Jimmy Butler... and ask Josh to do his best to model his game on Jimmy. Jimmy Butler was 24 years old when he started playing well as a defender slasher for Bulls... and Josh is not 24 yet"
"Yup. Same dude who got in trouble for getting his infant baby high from second hand smoke. Same dude who got arrested for trying to sneak into the VIP section at a music festival. Same dude who straight up no-showed a fan meetup/autograph signing event at a grocery store that was planned well in advance, and GM James Jones had to go to the meetup and meet/take pictures with everyone instead, and bought everyone that showed up beer(or iirc soda if they didn't drink booze) to try to help make up for it. Same dude who was the #1 player I was the most hyped over drafting of all time when they announced the draft pick of getting him I got out of my seat and yelled ""LETS FUCKIN GOOO"" and was hype af, then he turned out to be one of the biggest busts in Suns history and one of the dumbest boneheads on the court that I've ever had the displeasure of watching in my life. Dude's BBIQ number was below 0 for us. People like to talk about ""200 IQ"" this and that, well Josh Jackson was -200 IQ most of the time.  That said, if he's turning his basketball career around and becoming a solid player, then good for him. If he's turning his off-court life around and becoming a mature respectable adult human being, then that's even more important. I hope he learned his lessons."
And Josh Jackson. Our pistons are fun to watch even when we lose!
"I've always taken the approach that younger players need to *learn* winning and be part of that culture.  Unless you're a star, a younger player isn't going to create a winning environment on his own.  A team with Derozan as its best player won't be making deep playoff runs in the West.  But he does create a higher floor, which makes for a more competitive team night-in and night-out.   It's important for guys like Keldon, Lonnie, Vassell, Poeltl, and Dejounte to be a part of that.  The 7-game series against Denver and the great run in last year's bubble don't happen without Derozan, and I think the other players are better for those experiences.  I think of a few guys on perennially uncompetitive teams that have their growth stunted, lose confidence, or develop bad habits from not being around winning (say, Wendell Carter, Josh Jackson, or Lonzo Ball come to mind)."
"Our guy ended with 5 fucking fouls against the Pistons, 4 of them offensive, including that one you called out where Josh Jackson runs through his calf and brings his leg up. Book’s kick out against the Cavs last night on the 4pt play was way worse and called his way. There’s no consistency at all."
"Bruce brown unfortunately didn’t really have a place on our team. We had drose, and just drafted killian at the 1 so we wanted to give him plenty of minutes to develop. Our other guards are Josh Jackson (whose def an improvement of Bruce brown), svi who is intriguing and I believe still has room to develop, saddiq bey who we just drafted whose been playing minutes at multiple positions, and Wayne Ellington who is a great veteran to have and has been killing it this season. We had too many players at that position and while he was good on defense Bruce’s scoring did not have the same ceiling as the other guys. His playmaking is good, but seems like there just wasn’t enough for weaver to want to keep him as a point guard after drafting hayes"
"We’re competitive tanking. Sure our goal this season isn’t to win games but if you watched our games you can’t say our guys don’t fight hard to win each night.   We’ve competed with the lakers, Celtics, sixers and suns. And the rest of the games we lost we were never out of the game besides the bucks and jazz.  As for our offseason moves, grant and Josh Jackson have both outperformed, and our rookies have as well. (Besides killian who got injured early). In weaver we trust."
"It’s so crazy looking back at what could have been with DSJ. Even after tearing his ACL as a senior he was a top 10 recruit in high school, up with De’Aaron Fox, London Ball, Josh Jackson, Bam Adebayo, Markelle Fultz, Jonathan Isaac and Jayson Tatum. He then goes to NC State and had a good season, ends up getting drafted 9th overall up there with basically the same stars from his HS class.  People learn how to play defense or shoot 3s later in their career so maybe he could do it. I see the best case for DSJ is to become Lou Williams. The first scoring option off the bench for the 2nd unit, a slasher who also shoots ~35% from 3. Worst case is he ends up being a perpetual 3rd point guard on a team making the minimum."
"Josh Jackson was a lost cause in the NBA and he's been playing well for them. Never say never, but Josh is a good defender with a much more diverse skillset. His problem has always been decision making and his maturity level."
"I think something to consider is Raptor shows impacts and involves on-off figures, so in perspective Grant on the Nuggets didn’t impact them too much whales counterpart was Paul Millsap or Barton compared to on the Pistons who’s next player at the moment is something like Josh Jackson and Saddiq  It showed last year whiteside was a defensive monster because Blazers had no other option."
"&gt;I think there's also an element of (very) poor player development. Guys like Bender or Chriss were extremely raw, but had a couple of potentially interesting skills.  If that was truly the case, why didn't any of these draft busts switch teams and other teams unlock their unlocked potential? How old was Chriss, Dragan Bender, and Josh Jackson when they got cut/released/traded? Early 20's? Surely they were still extremely young. The amount of times that a player gets cut that was deemed a true bust, switches teams, and comes anywhere near their predraft hype is pretty much zero. Last time I can think of that sorta happening was with Julius Randle and that was because the Lakers wanted the cap space to sign Lebron James. Last time it kinda happened with the Bucks was with Tobias Harris in 2013 but it wasn't like he was a top 5 draft pick and just didn't get a lot of minutes. If Bender turns into anything remotely like Porzingis and Josh Jackson turns into an all NBA defender like everyone thought he could then I would blame the player development more but this just happens so rarely in the NBA."
Yeah. That’s why there are tons of guys who were nuts in college and trash? Because scouting right.  Jimmer Fredette? Josh Jackson? Doug McDermott? Tyler Hansbrough?  The NCAA is trash tier basketball. Better off playing overseas IMO
"Suns only had 4 top-5 picks over the last decade.  2013: Alex Len (5) 2016: Dragan Bender (4) 2017: Josh Jackson (4) 2018: Deandre Ayton (1)  The Suns have actually had a lot more draft hits in the back half of the lottery than the front half: Booker (13), Bridges (10), Cam Johnson (12), and even TJ Warren (14)."
"Ehh they also got Booker at 13 which was fantastic, Bridges at 10 was also really good, Cam Johnson has been decent as well.  If you include guys no longer on the roster there’s TJ Warren, Markieff Morris, and although he wasn’t good for them Josh Jackson looks decent enough on Detroit.  Len was in a really weak draft, and Chriss was the 8th pick in what was considered an 8 man draft at the time. Bender is the most disappointing pick but even then the only real huge miss not counting the diamonds in the rough later in the draft was Jamal Murray.  So not amazing or anything, but far from the worst drafting team of the last decade"
Josh Jackson
Josh Jackson did it in the game against OKC.
"Surprises for me were Josh Jackson, Malik Beasley, and Caris Levert (filling in his role so quickly in IND)."

Josh Jackson/Cory Joseph
"I guarantee you Cade or Green don't get you at least the 8th seed. If y'all draft one of them I'd bet you my house and life savings that doesn't happen.  I highly doubt the Pistons with Cade or Green become better than 7 teams currently ahead of them. Sure they'll be better, but better than the Hornets, Wizards, Pacers, Bulls, and Raptors? Even if they're better than some of those teams, they won't be better than all of them.   With that being said, I actually think the Pistons have a bright future if they can get one of those top guys in this draft. Grant looks great, Hayes as well as Bey look promising, Josh Jackson is turning his career around. Casey with all his flaws is still a great developmental coach and not a terrible coach like some people seem to think. The future in Detroit is brighter than people think.   But I can guarantee you Cade or Green would not get you at least the 8th seed next season."
"Hornets and Spurs looks the most solid right now, but I think OKC have the biggest upside if poku lives up to his potential and I would pick theo over bazley, right now baze looks like josh jackson on detroit"

Don’t be so hard on yourself. You also had Greg Monroe. And Josh Smith. And Reggie Jackson.
"If they didn't trade up, they would have taken Fox or Josh Jackson though."
Honestly the only one I think that I would like to redo is draft De'Aaron Fox over Josh Jackson. Jamal Murray over Dragan Bender but ideally I think Fox &gt; Murray.
that draft was pretty tricky even *with* hindsight. lot of smokescreens being played but I still think you should never trade for Fultz in that draft.   there were a few ways it could have went:  1.	LA still picks Lonzo so either Fultz or Tatum are on the table.  2.	Boston and LA pick both Fultz and Tatum so Philly picks someone passable like Lonzo or Fox  3.	Boston and LA pick both Fultz and Tatum and Philly is stupid and picks Josh Jackson or DSJ or something like that  But at least Philly retains that extra pick.
"This pretty much adds to what you say.   Two highest scorers on Devin Booker's teams (Besides Booker himself).  2016 - Eric Bledsoe (20.4 PPG and only played 31 games). Brandon Knight (19.6 PPG and only played 52 games).  2017 - Eric Bledsoe (21.1 PPG) and TJ Warren (14.4 PPG)  2018 - TJ Warren (19.6 PPG) and Josh Jackson (13.1 PPG).  2019 - TJ Warren (18 PPG) and Kelly Oubre (16.9 PPG).  2020 - Kelly Oubre (18.7 PPG) and Deandre Ayton (18.2 PPG)  Needless to say, Booker hasn't had a lot of offensive help besides Eric Bledsoe and TJ Warren. And if these guys are your primary scorers, I wouldn't like your chances of succeeding as much as I love TJ."
"In my defense, he had dragan bender, josh jackson, marquise chriss, 50 year old jamal crawford, tyler ulis, deanthony melton…..  it was basically the phoenix fucking globetrotters.  It was hard to tell if it was all the talent around him elevating him or he was actually good."
Suns went from picking Josh Jackson to being the best team in the league
Jesus Christ! Now I’m happy the Suns are doing great because “there’s a guy in Europe who became a Suns fan because of Josh Jackson” is an existential dread I cannot process.
"Got into basketball and the NBA via my brother, who was an OKC fan, a couple of years back, during the 17/18 season. I was on semester break and bored so I thought ""hey, might aswell watch a couple of games in the middle of the night, let's just give it a shot"". I watched like 3 or 4 OKC games, until that one faithful one against the Suns. It was a (/the?) game after the ASB and I just vividly remember Josh Jackson pulling the sickest fucking spin-move off on PG and dunking it. I was like ""ight, guess I'm a Suns fan now"". And I was, I got Leaguepass ever season since and watched 90% of games since then. It's just special to be able to watch them play live from time to time, and not just on demand."
Josh Jackson
"Need to take a chance on reclamation projects like Josh Jackson. His shooting is still terrible 4/5 nights, but he defends well. What's Stanley Johnson up to?"
Mann and Jackson going nuts is like the good karma from the Josh Smith and Corey Brewer game.
"Terrance ""Josh Smith"" Mann and Reggie ""Corey Brewer"" Jackson"
"It's not. And I didn't say it's bad. As I said I like Moses.   However, YOUR point is that the 16th pick is essentially useless.   Yet the guy you use went undrafted in 2019.   In 2019 could've taken guys like Thybulle, keldon Johnson, KPJ, Moses, etc    In 2020 could've gotten you the likes of Precious, Saddiq, Isaiah Stewart, Maxey, McDaniels,     2021 mocks could have the 16 potentially land the likes of Kai Jones, Isaiah Jackson, Zaire Williams, Josh Giddey, Garuba    Hardly a pick with no value lol"
"Not all first round picks are created equal, the average pick outside of the top 5 is rarely going to yield a superstar. If you're getting 18 #1-5 picks, I'd agree with you, but most of those picks are not very good;     2021- #4 position, #16 &amp; #18 (or #5 if the Rockets get insanely unlucky).    2022- Their own first rounder, Clippers 1st rounder (unlikely to be very good), Sunds first rounder (unlikely to be very good).   2023 - Pick swap with Clippers (TBD), Lottery protected heat pick, Lottery protected Nuggets Pick   2024 - Their own pick, Clippers pick (TBD), Rockets (top 4 protected)   2025 - Basically a Clippers pick swap (TBD), 76'ers (top 6 protected)   2026 - Their own pick, Clippers pick (TBD), Rockets (top 4 protected)   2027 - Their own first rounder  Once you look at those protections, you're not going to get 18 guys like Jaylen Brown (#3 overall) or SGA (#11 overall), you're going to get a lot of guys like Josh Jackson, Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Mario Hezonja, &amp; Emmanuel Mudiay. If you're lucky, you'll get 2-3 like Jaylen or SGA, which is not worth Luka or Zion."
"KD was for sure, but Westbrook and Harden definitely weren't no brainers. I specifically remember people saying the Thunder reached for Westbrook and there were other guys in Harden's class getting mocked to the Thunder (Rubio, Steph, Tyreke).  Other notable picks besides Ibaka:  -Reggie Jackson at 24   -Steven Adams at 12 was a great pick considering how trash the '13 class was   -Sabonis at 11 (he basically made the pick for the Magic in that trade)  -Cam Payne at 14 is now looking like it was a solid pick   -Maledon at 34    Presti has whiffed on some late first round guys like Josh Huestis, Perry Jones, and Mitch McGary, but has shown he's pretty solid at evaluating talent when he actually has picks to use imo."
He's ahead of Lamar Jackson for sure. Definitely closer to Mahomes than Jackson in terms of expected talent level imo.   Also I'm a little biased but Josh Allen is also ahead of Jackson. But Jackson is #4.
Here's a mock draft from the NBA website that had Josh Jackson going 3rd overall two days before the draft  [Link] (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nba.com/news/2017-mock-draft-third-edition%3famp=1)  Edit: I guess I have no idea how to embed a link into text. If anyone could help me out I'd appreciate it lol
[Here's a mock draft from the NBA website two days before the draft that had Josh Jackson going 3rd] (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nba.com/news/2017-mock-draft-third-edition%3famp=1)
"&gt;Nearly every draft expert had the top 3 picks being Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball and Josh Jackson in that order.     I call bullshit here. Fultz 1, Lonzo 2 and Tatum 3 was locked the fuck in a month before the draft."
"some people on this sub actually try to act like Markelle Fultz wasn't the consensus top pick but he absolutely was. It was only a few years ago and they already forgot.  Tatum at 3 was considered a bit of a reach at the time too, a lot of mock drafts had him in the 4-6 range. Nearly every draft expert had the top 3 picks being Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball and Josh Jackson in that order."
He did but he was seriously considering Fultz and Josh Jackson as well. It wasn’t until post workouts that he was all in on Tatum. (Jackson made it difficult to even schedule and Fultz shit the bed. Tatum was perfect.)
Isnt it a great feeling? We have a young group as well  PG: Cade Cunningham - 19  SG: Killian Hayes - 20  SF: Saddiq Bey - 22  PF: Jerami Grant - 27 (our old man in the lineup)  C: Isaiah Steward - 20  With some young dudes off the bench as well in Josh Jackson and Diallo
"&gt; Just waiting once for the team who leaks yrs later ""We were fucking dying to try to trade up for Josh Jackson  Well there is the stuff about Ainge trying to trade 4 picks for Winslow lol"
Preview of the rest of the lakers target list for this summer:  Markelle Fultz   Bismack biyombo  Dwight Howard  Elfrid payton  Josh jackson  Tony Allen  Ricky rubio
"Who was the last KU “star” to actually live up to their hype? I’m actually curious. Josh Jackson, Andrew Wiggins, Oubre, McLemore….  E: Nvm. It’s Embiid. Forgot about him. He lived up to the hype."
"other stars are like kawhi, giannis while busts are stanley johnson and josh jackson"
Josh “literally Scottie Pippen” Jackson
Oh wtf.   Fuck josh Jackson
What happened to Josh Jackson . I see he's only 24    I only know about him not really caring .
"Jaylen Brown, Josh Jackson  That’s pretty much best and worst case scenario right there ^"

"Supposedly, we were seriously considering Josh Jackson over Tatum, if that makes you feel worse.  Sometimes even good execs fall in love."
"Every year, we pretend that we know for sure which players are going to be good and which aren't. Every year there's guys we think are meaningless who turn out to be really solid. Every year, there's guys we thing are going to be really solid at the top of the draft that *totally* blow.   Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker in 2014 were really underwhelming for their hype. Dante Exum and Nik Stauskas straight up were terrible NBA players. They were the 5th and 8th picks.   But that's just one year, you might say...  2015: Jahlil Okafor, pick 3...had a lot of hype as a potential #1 overall guy a few months before the draft. Total bust. Mario Hezonja, pick 5? Worthless. Mudiay and Stanley Johnson, picks 7 and 8? Total crap.  2016: Dragan Bender and Kris Dunn in the top 5. Marquese Chriss and Thon Maker in the top-10.   2017: Fultz was a bust at 1. Josh Jackson was a bust at 4. Guys 8-11 were all crap.   You give each draft a few years, and you see that there are really good players drafted in the 20s each year, and some crap picked in the top-10."
Don't forget about Doumbouya being the next Caboclo and both Josh and Frank Jackson playing their best ball of their careers last year either.

Stanley Johnson/Josh Jackson vibes to me
"Star: Cade and Mobley. I know, not exactly a blazing take but I really do think both guys can be top players at their respective position, and I think that anybody who has Green over Mobley is going to look really foolish.  Bust: I don’t see Kuminga being all that good. He’s a big wing with B+ athleticism and subpar skills. We’ve seen this movie before with Josh Jackson and Stanley Johnson."
"""What do you mean Dedmon, Ish Smith and Josh Jackson isnt a fair deal for Jokic?"""
"Our offer is 4 top 50 protected picks, 2022, 2024, and 2026 2nd round pick swaps, and Josh Jackson or Jahlil Okafor"
"Josh Jackson is an idiot and can’t keep his cool anywhere, much say on a basketball court. any similar prospect who’s calm and humble shouldn’t be compared to him."
So does a guy like Bouknight. Kuminga just as easily will be the next Josh Jackson.
"It means that the prospect is ready to contribute as a rookie. Most rookies these days aren’t considered NBA ready because they still have have a big weakness or big weaknesses in their game that can create havoc for them early on. Many rookie these days only have one season of college basketball experience or never had college basketball experience. I don’t have the data in front of me but it feels like more highly touted prospects end up busting nowadays than ever before because they were not ready for the league. (Ex: Mudiay, Dante Exum, Dennis Smith Jr., and Josh Jackson, even though he was actually a contributor with the Pistons this past season)."
"Are you suggesting my roster of;   PG - Cole Anthony  SG - Cam Reddish  SF - Josh Jackson  PF - Marvin Bagley  C - Skal Labissiere  Isn’t going to win 5 straight titles?   But yeah in all reality, so many guys that are just athletic 6’7 or taller guys are dominant high school players because no one can match their size/speed. Once they play higher level and everyone is that fast/big it’s more based on their skills, so how good they were compared to other 16-17 year olds doesn’t matter."
"The Suns are pretty bad outside of Booker.  Josh Jackson, Alex Len, Dragan Bender, etc  Could've taken Luka over Ayton too."

"**Fox Sports:**  Fuiltz 1: ""The Sixers made a no-brainer trade for the first pick, and now they'll make the no-brainer choice with the selection.""  Tatum 3: ""Taking the Duke forward with the first pick would have been a reach. Trading down to No. 3 allows Ainge to take the guy he wants without facing a ton of criticism (and while adding another asset down the line).""  **Sports Illustrated**  Fuiltz 1: Mocking this one is like getting extra credit for spelling your name correctly.   Tatum 3: This could be Josh Jackson (who may have greater value in a deal), but the better fit for Boston would be Tatum, thanks to his potential to space the floor, play some power forward and become a go-to scorer down the line.  **Bleacher Report:**  Fuiltz 1: ""Markelle Fultz remains the favorite to go No. 1, even if the Boston Celtics trade the pick.""  Tatum 5: ""The Sacramento Kings won't be happy to see the Phoenix Suns grab De'Aaron Fox. But Fox going top four means Jayson Tatum slips to No. 5, where he stands out as a strong candidate for best player available.""  **Chad Ford:**  Fuiltz 1: ""That all-around style of play would be a welcomed addition alongside Ben Simmons and the 76ers' numerous young big men to help round out the roster and start the organization's ascent up the standings in the Eastern Conference.""  Tatum: 3: ""It will likely come down to the Celtics then picking Jackson sight unseen or going with Tatum, who might wind up fitting better in the long term.""  **CBS Sports:**  Fuiltz 1: ""Is Fultz ""can't-miss""? He's as close as there is to can't-miss as there is in this draft""  Tatum 3: ""It may prove to be the smart decision, seeing that the Celtics have plenty of flexibility in the near future. (If things break the right way, there's a chance the Celtics could have high lottery picks from the Nets and Lakers next season.) ""  Many of these were saying that the biggest issue with Tatum over Jackson was that Jackson refused to meet with the Celtics. It's likely they would have had Jackson over Tatum, if that didn't happen.  When people are saying Fuiltz is ""as close as there is to 'can't-miss'"", ""Sixers will make a no-brainer choice"", and ""Remains the favorite even if Boston trades the pick"" implies that the majority of people and analysts thought Fuiltz was clearly the better talent.  When they are trying to figure out if the C's should take Tatum over Jackson, when Jackson refused to workout with them, then you know the perceived talent disparity between Fuiltz/Tatum is more then the draft positions of 1-3, rather then the opposite argument which you are making.  Just because Ainge Zigged when everyone else Zagged doesn't change that 95% of the people thought Fuiltz had more talent."
"Zeke Nnaji, and PJ obviously  Other teams - Patrick Williams, Malik Monk, Josh Jackson, Saddiq Bey, Desmond Bane"
"How does me saying Tatum was consensus 3-6 mean I have an agenda when it’s true lol.  [here is your link, it’s a “consensus mock draft”](https://www.nba.com/news/2017-consensus-mock-draft)  This consensus mock draft has Tatum #3, which falls into the category of consensus 3-6. Also in this consensus mock draft, Fultz goes #1.  Let’s look at [another consensus mock draft](https://www.basketballinsiders.com/2017-nba-consensus-mock-draft-final/)  In here it is the exact same. Markelle at #1, Tatum within the 3-6 range.  How about [1 more consensus mock](https://www.slcdunk.com/nba-draft/2017/6/22/15852100/nba-draft-2017-final-consensus-mock-draft)  Here, once again we see Markelle go #1, but Tatum goes at number 4 behind Josh Jackson, which falls into the consensus 3-6 range.  These were the first 3 results when googling 2017 consensus mocks, completely randomly selected. In these we see a trend, Markelle at #1, Lonzo #2, and Jayson Tatum going in the 3-6 range.  That’s what consensus is. These are mocks by many draft experts who examine the NBA Draft for a living. You’re not gonna try and say they are “random people”, right?  I don’t know what more you want. It is clear that Markelle was the consensus number 1 overall pick, while Tatum fell within the 3-6 range.  I don’t know what else to say. This argument is stupid. You are calling people who provide for their families by analyzing the draft “random people on the internet” when they have platforms read by hundreds of thousands of NBA Fans who search “NBA Mock Draft”.   There were multiple mocks you can find that have Tatum behind Markelle, Lonzo, Jackson, Fox, and Dennis Smith Jr. that you can find. I do admit those are more rare, but they absolutely do exist.  I literally don’t know what else to say. The fact that this is even a discussion baffles me."
Fultz was also mocked at #1 in every mock draft when the Celtics had the #1 pick even though they already had an All-Star point guard.  It wasn't even a conversation.  It also wasn't like Ball and Tatum were the obvious next two prospects.  Many people had Josh Jackson ahead of Tatum and/or Ball.

"BPA isn't clear cut. Kuminga is extremely raw with atrocious shooting splits in the G League and could easily be a Josh Jackson type bust where his shooting/scoring skill just isn't good enough for the NBA. Bouknight's ceiling is still insanely high as an athletic 3 level scorer like a Lavine/Booker type player. He's underrated because he was carrying a Uconn team that was dogshit on offense with terrible spacing, shooting, and no other consistent shot creators and was forced into playing hero ball whole coming off an elbow injury."
"Are you serious? What's the point of having a player that is arguably the best perimeter defender in the league, can push the pace and get his teammates involved? The fit with Embiid isn't perfect but we've seen glimpses of Ben by himself that prove he is still a ridiculous talent.  This is a history of the number 4 pick in the draft. You want to roll the dice at this spot over getting a proven guy like Ben Simmons? Yes he has weaknesses in his game but to say he's worth less than the 4th pick is an insane take.  2020 Patrick Williams - Chicago Bulls  2019 De’Andre Hunter – Atlanta Hawks  2018 Jaren Jackson Jr., Michigan State – Memphis Grizzlies  2017 Josh Jackson, Kansas – Phoenix Suns  2016 Dragan Bender, Israel – Phoenix Suns  2015 Kristaps Porzingis, Baloncesta Sevilla – New York Knicks  2014 Aaron Gordon, Arizona – Orlando Magic  2013 Cody Zeller, Indiana – Charlotte Bobcats  2012 Dion Waiters, Syracuse – Cleveland Cavaliers  2011 Tristan Thompson, Texas – Cleveland Cavaliers  2010 Wesley Johnson, Syracuse – Minnesota Timberwolves"
"How am I dodging your question? I said no. I think Simmons has a higher value right now. I think 29 teams have probably expressed interest in Simmons. NBA GMs aren't 17-year-old redditors. Regarding 1 or 2, idk. Maybe.   &amp;#x200B;  Bledsoe, at the time, would have been seen as a highly serviceable replacement and the four could have been flipped again for another vet. They wouldn't have wanted the rookie. The main piece in that trade, however, would have been Paul George. And to my original point, look how Josh Jackson has turned out. A true star."
"&gt;Ben is likely going to be tiers better than anyone drafted at that spot.   We are having separate conversations then cz mine is the 4th pick has more value than Ben Simmons right now. Do you disagree with that?  Edit: here is the Kyrie no4 pick stuff i was talking about  https://www.si.com/nba/2018/01/03/kyrie-irving-lebron-james-cavaliers-suns-trade-talks   ""In mid-June, shortly before Griffin left, team and league sources confirm, the Cavs explored a three-way deal with Phoenix and Indiana that would have shipped Irving and Frye to the Suns and brought Eric Bledsoe and Paul George to Cleveland. The Suns resisted, unwilling to part with their No. 4 pick, which they planned to use to draft Josh Jackson."""
2020 - Patrick Williams - Bulls   2019 De’Andre Hunter – Hawks   2018 Jaren Jackson Jr - Grizzlies   2017 Josh Jackson  – Suns   2016 Dragan Bender - Suns   2015 Kristaps Porzingis - Knicks   2014 Aaron Gordon  – Magic   2013 Cody Zeller - Bobcats   2012 Dion Waiters - Cavaliers   2011 Tristan Thompson - Cavaliers   2010 Wesley Johnson - Timberwolves   I wouldn’t trade Ben for a decade of number four picks now that the unicorn has vanished.
"From 2010-2019, the number 4 picks have been deandre hunter, jaren Jackson, josh Jackson, dragan bender, KP, Aaron Gordon, Cody zeller, dion waiters, Tristan Thompson, and Wesley Johnson. How many all star appearances do those guys have between them, 1 (KP in 2018)? The draft is a massive crapshoot, prob bigger than people think Edit: JJJ and hunter are obviously good young players, but the median player in that list is probably Tristan Thompson"
"The time is perfect for this to happen. Plenty of Alums from KU, KState, and Mizz that would draw interest if we were able to get one or two on a team. Imagine if we got Joel, Wiggins,Morris twins, Svi, Josh Jackson, Devonte Graham, Mason, MPJ and his brother...the fan base is already built in here. We have a fantastic arena that we have proven at a national level that can support and host major events (NCAA Tournament rounds, Big 12 Tournament ECT) The Power and Light District across the street from the arena for an all around great experience when going to a game. Yes we have 3 professional sports teams in our market...but remember this isn't the 90s/ 00s anymore. We have EXPLODED in growth since then. And when we had the Kings her last, Kansas City wasn't built to support them. But our city has become great over time and we have gotten the chance to show that we do support our teams passionately. Two World Series appearances and two Superbowl appearances while wining one of each as well as MLS Championship Cup...all of this has happened within the last decade or so? I think it's the perfect time to bring an NBA team into our market if done correctly. Look at OKC, I don't think they had any idea an NBA team would be a success there until The Hornets and CP3 came and made the city their temporary home after Katrina hit New Orleans. It's, different for KC I believe. There isn't much guess work on wether or not there would be support and interest for a team when you look at the success the NCAA has had here. Those players that we watched grow up in college eventually become household names in the league,"
"Fwiw, some stats from recent years:  2020 draft   * Edwards: 19.3/4.7/2.9 on 41.7/32.9/77.6 splits * Wiseman: 11.5/5.8/0.7 on 51.9/32.6/62.8 * Lamelo: 15.7/5.9/6.1 on 43.6/35.2/75.8 * Patrick Williams: 9.2/4.6/1.4 on 48.3/39.1/72.8  2019  * Zion: 22.5/6.3/2.1 on 58.3/42.8/64 splits  * Ja: 17.8/3.9/7.3 on 47.7/33.5/77.6  * RJ: 14.3/5/2.6 on 40.2/32/61.4 * Hunter: 12.3/4.5/1.8 on 41/35.5/76.4  2018 (doing 5 here to get Luka and Trae)  * Ayton: 16.3/10.3/1.8 on 58.5/no 3s/74.6 * Bagley: 14.9/7.6/1 on 50.4/31.3/69.1 * Doncic: 21.2/7.8/6 on 42.7/32.7/71.3 * JJJ: 13.8/4.7/1.1 on 50.6/35.9/76.6 * Trae: 19.1/3.7/8.1 on 41.8/32.4/82.9  2017 (note Fultz played only 14 games)  * Fultz: 7.1/3.1/3.8 on 40.5/no 3s/47.6 * Lonzo: 10.2/6.9/7.2 on 36/30.5/45.1 * Tatum: 13.9/5/1.6 on 47.5/43.4/82.6 * Josh Jackson: 13.1/4.6/1.5 on 41.7/26.3/63.4  Couple things that stand out to me. Top 4 picks have historically not been great free throw shooters out of the gate. Only Trae (who isn’t technically a top 4 pick) and Tatum shot at least 80% from the line of the 17 guys mentioned and neither of them made 83%. Since the 2010 draft, the only top 4 draft picks who’ve hit that mark were Kyrie and Porzingis.   Also theres a trade off with volume and efficiency. Zion shot 14 total attempts from 3 so leaving him out. Only Tatum and Patrick Williams shot at least 37% from 3 and they scored 13.9 and 9.2 ppg. And of the guys above with at least 18 ppg, their 3pt%s ranged from 32.4 - 32.9%."
Josh Jackson ffs
Josh Jackson
Josh Jackson.  I really really didn't want the Suns to get Tatum and was so happy when the Celts got him and we got JJ.  Im honestly still a fan and hope he can carve out an NBA career.

"Philly got really lucky that the majority of the ""Superstar"" players weren't quite all that. If you go look at that draft from the perspective of someone just after the 2017 finals they'd tell you there are 9 can't miss prospects up for grabs. Looking at that same draft today, it goes Tatum and Fox as stars and Smith Jr., OG, Kuzma and Jarett Allen as reasonable starters or rotation players who went later in the draft, and a spattering of of players who might make a 2nd contract depending on what teams need what.  If Lonzo, Josh Jackson, Issac, Markannen and all the other guys who were projected to be franchise centerpieces lived up to their hype then that trade to get Fultz would look a whole hell of a lot worse than it already does."
Josh Jackson for me. I was sure he was going to be a stud
2 2nds this year plus Josh Jackson or they can have olympic hero Jahlil Okafor
What young guys we trading? I’m not giving up Sekou for the 24th pick. Sekou has the exact same potential Kuminga does  Our only trade pieces are Josh Jackson &amp; Mason Plumlee. We ain’t getting shit with them lol
They let one walk in Carlos Boozer . They had a chance to do so in the 04 draft (the one where they went with Luke Jackson) . JR Smith was still on the table as was Josh Smith and more notably Kevin Martin.
"If by well defined top 4, you mean top 4 prospects, I don’t think that was the case in 2017. People’s opinions on Tatum were all over the place.  3 writers’ had big boards for the Ringer. Tatum was 2nd on KOC’s after Fultz (highest I’ve seen him) followed by Lonzo, Fox, Isaac, Jackson in that order. Both other guys (Chau and Tjarks) had Tatum at 9th lol: Chau’s order was Fultz, Ball, Josh, Isaac, Fox, DSJ, OG, Frank, JT. Tjarks had Fultz, Ball, Isaac, OG, Josh, DSJ, Fox, Monk, JT.  Sports Illustrated’s final big board had him at 5th though they did say he “should be in the mix as high as No. 3 to the Celtics” and had an “elite tier” ordered like Fultz, Fox, Jackson, Lonzo, Tatum. Bleacher Report’s final 1 had him at 6th after Fultz, Ball, JJ, Isaac, Fox.   Even in Nba.com’s mock draft 2 days prior, they had us taking Jackson after Fultz and Lonzo got picked then had Fox going at 4 and Tatum at 5 to the Kings."
"The amazing thing about the Suns is that they have done this after having some serious boneheads drafts of late:  Chriss, Bender, Josh Jackson, all top ten picks, Bender and Jackson top four.  Just think if they had done reasonably well with those picks."
"Yeah, there's a pretty well defined Top 4 in this draft and one would think that's the straightforward pick.  Of course, last time we had a well defined Top 4 it was Fultz, Ball, Tatum, and Josh Jackson.  4 years in, only one has really sniffed what you hope for out of a Top 3 caliber pick."
"This sucks. It sucks a lot. It felt like we had so much going for us as far as a sort of Cinderella story: The amazing character and story of Monty Williams, the great comeback of Cam Payne from washout China player to key role player, Book's whole career of slander as an ""empty stats guy"", CP3's whole career of being great and coming up short. It felt like destiny and it really sucks that we didn't get a storybook ending. I'm glad Monty is going to be the guy talking to our guys after this one because this one hurts for me as a fan and gotta be killer for our guys in that locker room.     However there's a lot of hope for us:   **Big rotation minute guys for us:**     Devin Booker: 24 Y/O   Mikal Bridges: 24 Y/O   Deandre Ayton: 22 Y/O   Cam Johnson: 25 Y/O   Cam Payne: 26 Y/O     **Consensus top 3 players of all time:**     MJ when he won his first title: 27 Y/O   LeBron when he won his first title: 27 Y/O   Kareem when he won his first title: 23 Y/O (didn't win another till he was 32)   I wanted to win this one bad. But this is the first time we've made the playoffs in over a decade and we were pretty damn close to winning it all. Even the greatest players ever took some time to win the dance.       **We were a laughingstock just a couple years ago:**     We had 6 coaches in a 5 year span until we got Monty.   I thought Josh Jackson was gonna be part of our big 3 just a few years ago.    We started Tyler Ulis for an entire year at point guard in 17-18.     We have a ton of talent, they're young, and they got some incredible playoff experience off one run that tons of guys don't get in 3 playoff trips.     Round 1 people were saying we weren't going anywhere because it wasn't our time yet. The best thing about that statement is that it acknowledges we have a ton of time left. I look forward to cheering our guys on next year."
The 4th pick in the last loaded draft was Josh Jackson
