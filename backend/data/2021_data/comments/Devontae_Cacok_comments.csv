"Because being the better player is not a guarantee of being more likely to win a championship? There's a billion contextual factors involved.  Who's more likely to win a championship, Devontae Cacok or CP3? Does that mean Cacok is better?"
"Shaq has found yet another big man to pile on. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if he mouths off on Devontae Cacok at some point."
"""The most value in the package was young big man Devontae Cacok""   Yes, let's trade our sought after 3+D player for a man who gets 2.5 minutes a game"
"I'm not sure at all Boogie is currently better than Devontae Cacok their 2 way player or than a journeyman like Jordan Bell.  Like trust me I don't like to say that, because it's sad, but just like Blake Griffin, I just don't see how he helps a team, unless he randomly shoots 40% from 3 for the rest of the year"
"&gt;I worry about LeBron having to pack on minutes to carry that load since we assumed he'd be coasting until the postseason  I'm not that worried. The Lakers have a fairly deep roster. Guys like Harrell and Schröder are hungry for more minutes and possessions as they are looking to sign new contracts fairly soon. Kuzma, along with Schröder and Harrell, provide ample scoring. Defensively, we will miss AD a lot, but I'm betting that Frank and the staff can figure something between the guys I think would be absorbing AD's minutes; Kuzma, Morris, Harrell, and Gasol (and possibly Devontae Cacok in some games)."
No we benched lebron and AD so THT and devontae cacok could get the minutes they deserve
"Lol, even when both Anthony Davis and Marc Gasol were out with injury a few games ago, Montrezl still came off the bench behind G-Leaguer DeVontae Cacok."
Devontae Cacok-Dwight Howard
"This is really bad logic. Devontae Cacok (who I never heard of) was +4. He must be much better than Steph.  1 game +/- stats are garbage, especially when your team gets blown out."
ESPN: LeBron openly disavows any belief in Devontae Cacok and Kostas Antetokounmpo
Why did Devontae Cacok play for 4 mins?
"I think Drummond's preference would have been to get traded to a team that wanted to re-sign him, but since that didn't happen his choices were either stay on the bench behind Allen in Cleveland and miss the playoffs, sign with Brooklyn who at the time had DAJ, Claxton, LMA and Blake to play center minutes, or go to the Lakers who were missing Gasol due to Covid, who didn't have AD playing and were looking for a starting center (having recently started 10 day player Damian Jones and G-League player Devontae Cacok). It was probably an easy choice for Drummond.   It was an easy choice for the Lakers as well, as they needed a short time starting big while AD and Gasol were out, and if Drummond played great and became the clear starter, then that's a bonus. If not then eventually they'd have Gasol and AD back. So for a prorated minimum Drummond was a guy with more potential upside than Damian Jones.   Where do you think Drummond should have gone? There wasn't some magical situation out there for him where he'd get a lot of playing time and exposure to showcase himself for free agency. This was pretty much it."
Devontae Cacok
"The core players are Dudley, Kostas, THT, McLemore, McKinnie, Wes Matthews and Devontae Cacok."
"The guys who were taunting Crowder in game 3 were like Kostas, Devontae Cacok, Dudley, Drummond etc so yeah it's not really that far off"
"&gt;those young players  4 youngest players in that team are:  - THT - 20 years old - Kostas Antetokounmpo - 23 - Cacok - 24 - Kuzma - 25  Everybody else on this team is 27+.  And I wouldn't count Kostas and Devontae as part of this team from purely basketball point of view for obvious reasons.   ""those young players"", seriously?"
"Also Pacquiao's team was and is involved in some of the worst shenanigans the league has ever seen. They conduct trades that are the equivalent of trading Zion Williamson for Jared Dudley, Kostas Antetokounmpo, and Devontae Cacok."
Bro Kostas just isn’t an NBA player. I have more hope in devontae cacok than Kostas
"Offseason focus  What is the pecking order in free agency? Half of those on the roster are free agents  Creativity in the offseason with limited options outside of their own players  What is the final cost of this roster?  Draft assets  First: 22  Future: The Lakers owe New Orleans an unprotected first in 2022. In addition, the Pelicans have the right to swap in 2023 plus an unprotected first via Los Angeles in 2024. The Pelicans have the right to defer the 2024 first-rounder until 2025. The Lakers can trade their 2021 first-round pick after making the selection. They are also allowed to trade first-round picks in 2027 or 2028 (but not both of them).  Cash: $5.6 million (to send) | $5 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  The Lakers have four players -- LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope -- who will combine to earn $102M in 2021-22. Along with the $9.7 million player option of Montrezl Harrell and their own first-round pick, the Lakers will enter the offseason $14.5 million below the luxury tax, but with eight open roster spots to fill.  If they elect to bring back their own free agents, including Dennis Schroder, Alex Caruso and Talen Horton-Tucker, they will be in the luxury tax for a second consecutive season. The total cost of salaries and luxury tax could reach close to $275 million.  If Los Angeles balks at the price of each player, it will have only the $9.5 million midlevel exception along with the veteran minimum exception available to use. However, the Lakers would be hard capped if they use more than $5.9 million of the midlevel. The biannual exception was used last offseason on Wesley Matthews and is not available.  The hard cap restriction still applies (the Lakers are $509K below) and will get lifted on Aug. 3. The poison pill restriction for Kyle Kuzma also gets lifted on that same day. Harrell has until Aug. 1 to opt in to his contract. There is no offseason guaranteed date on the $1.8 million contract of Alfonzo McKinnie.  Team needs  Starting and backup point guard  Bench depth at every position  Extension eligible: Alfonzo McKinnie  Free-agent status  Dennis Schroder | Bird  Montrezl Harrell | Player | Non Bird  Wesley Matthews | Non Bird  Alex Caruso | Bird  Ben McLemore | Non Bird  Andre Drummond | Non Bird  Talen Horton-Tucker | Restricted | Early Bird  Markieff Morris | Early Bird  Jared Dudley | Early Bird  Devontae Cacok | Restricted | Early Bird  Kostas Antetokounmpo Restricted | Early Bird"
