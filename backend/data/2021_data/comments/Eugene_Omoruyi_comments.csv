"And then at the end of the clip, it's a former Oregon Duck (Louis King) holding back Metu from punching another former Oregon Duck (Eugene Omoruyi). Although they were never teammates."
This dude tried to kill Eugene Omoruyi soon after
Nah fam  MVP: Luka  DPOY: KP  MIP: Josh Green  ROY: Eugene Omoruyi  6MOY: Jalen Brunson  COTY: Jason Kidd
96 Bulls doesn't have 2021/22 ROY Eugene Omoruyi
I've seen takes that he should be cut in favor of our 24-year old Eugene Omoruyi.
Eugene Omoruyi
The disrespect to future All-Rookie Eugene Omoruyi

Chimeze Metu this year in the summer league. He landed one on Eugene Omoruyi after Omoruyi pushed him in the back after going to the basket. Metu aint taking shit after Jonas Valanciunas broke his wrist last year.
"I  checked this out on bball ref, and it's unfortunately a little messy to analyze from their platform. Filtering out non-qualifiers leaves out some key guys like Anthony Davis because of injuries either last year or this, but opening it up to all and doing per 36 brings absolute legends such as Nathan Knight and Eugene Omoruyi to the top of the list. So I'm doing some filtering in Excel and will bring any good findings back."
"He played super great for that Oregon Ducks team that was so good. His last season he was lighting it up, lead the team in minutes, scoring (tied w/Eugene Omoruyi) and had shooting splits of 53/42/81.   The 2021 draft was as loaded as promised and I think a lot of these names will be talked about for years to come."
