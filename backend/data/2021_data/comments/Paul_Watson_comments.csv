"Overrating Thybulle and underrating Lowry. We have too many guards in the first place, and certainly dont need another bottom of the rotation 3nD guard. We already got OG who fills the archetype low volume 3nD already as well as McCaw who is a Nick Nurse favourite, Stanley Johnson, Bembry and Paul Watson."
"Paul Watson Jr, Second of His Name, legend of that one bubble game where he looked more like Siakam than Siakam did at the time"

"Paul Watson being played in the third quarter, we threw the towel I guess"
Pretty much shows our bench needs a serious retooling. Players like Matt Thomas and Paul Watson ain't cutting it.
"Raptors Paul Watson is surprisingly skilled, he'd be a great player if he had a way better BBIQ. His decision making is his biggest flaw"
"Lowry/Bembry/Norm/Boucher/Baynes  TD/Matt Thomas/Stanley Johnson/Paul Watson/Donte Hall  Strong lineup, Raps win."
How have we not traded a second rounder and Paul Watson for Cousins yet?
It was Terence Davis. Paul Watson even had to get up lol.
Who tf is Paul Watson
Paul Watson 6 points in 2 minutes. Tacko fall best big in the league.
"Paul Watson should have played today, we needed some size and had so much foul trouble"
Paul Watson you love to see it
"Fuck it, play Paul Watson at the 5"
"Malachi Flynn, Paul Watson, STANIMAL, Yuta Watanabe, Aaron Baynes"
"Second from the left, Paul Watson, the only guy still on our team.  Davis is in sac, Matt Thomas is in Utah."
Uhh  If 6th is Boucher and 7th is Bembry I guess 8th is Paul Watson and 9th is Stanley Johnson  We are not a deep team this year.
"Paul Watson, Deandre Bembry"
"Shades of the 2015ish Pacers with Paul George, George Hill, Solomon Hill, Jordan Hill, CJ Watson, CJ Miles, Myles Turner, practically had to use every players full name"
"Good players like Stanley Johnson, Aron Baynes, Matt Thomas and Paul Watson?  You drop him into any bottom dwelling team and he'd look like freaking Bradley Beal."
Paul Watson also fucking torched us tonight. Dudes a fucking flamethrower
"Could add like Matt Thomas or Paul Watson so it's 4 for 2, then cut someone from the roster"
"Raptors lost to a buzzer beating having missing 3 starters, not a bad game given paul watson played 20+ minutes but sloppy game from both teams still."
no one is really G league material except Paul Watson lol
"How are the raptors winning with no Fred VanVleet, OG, and Siakam? LMAO  Winning with Paul Watson putting in 20 minutes and losing 3 out of our top 4 guys wow..."
"That‚Äôs not true at all. You get rid of Langford, we still have the most days missed in the league. Get rid of everyone that doesn‚Äôt play significant minutes in our rotation and we‚Äôre still at 110 days which would be fourth. Then to be fair, you‚Äôd have to at least subtract the days missed by KZ and Haslem from the Heat plus the ones from Paul Watson from the Raptors. At most, we‚Äôd have the second most missed.  And your point about the win later trades also ignores the fact that the Celtics also have been making win later moves including focusing on younger players and trading an important player in Theis away to get under the tax and give more time to Robert Williams. Both the full roster and the rotation of the pelicans have an average age within point three of each other."
We tried then fucking paul watson and yuta combined for 60
"Lol come on man. Resting 4/5ths of the starting lineup, when most of those guys have played very little to not at all recently, is straight up tanking.   It's great that Yuta, Boucher, and Paul Watson are playing out of their minds, but we're trying to lose these games."

The league doesn‚Äôt wanna see Paul Watson Jr. ball.

question 1: Who the fuck is Paul Watson
"I'll give you the skinny chief since not everyone will google him.  4 year player undrafted out of Fresno State. Average G league player for 2 years on Westchester Knicks. Raps 905 head coach Jama Mahlalela went to some sort of g league elite type event that Paul also attended and raved about Paul to the front office.  Fall 2019 Raps 905 traded some guy and a G league draft pick to the Westchester Knicks for Paul Watson Jr. Things seemed to come together for Watson, on the Raps 905 as he massively improved his shooting on higher usage. He Signed a two year 2 way contract January 2020, had one notable 22 pts game vs Denver in the bubble.   Watson earned an NBA contract in training camp coming into this season. He mostly played garbage minutes and was deep in the rotation and didn't look great. After some trades he got more playing time and was looking okay before he got covid and missed about 3 weeks. This was his 2nd game coming back."
"""The Raptors have announced that they have waived Paul Watson and Yuta Watanabe for screwing with the tank, and have signed Moritz Wagner in their place"""
We just watched a man named Paul Watson Jr. drop 30 nba points in one game. 20 in a quarter.
Paul Watson Jr.
Well one is Pandemic P and one is uh... Paul Watson needs a real nickname
Paul George  37 pts L  Paul Watson 30 pts W  I rest my case.
Paul Watson Jr and Yuta Watanabe!
Who the hell is Paul Watson
Paul Watson and Yuta about to be out from a mysterious ‚Äúsore ankle‚Äù real soon
"Paul Watson &amp; Yuta Watanabe combine for 51 points, both individual career highs, just like we all predicted! LUL"
"Bro fr. Most raptors shit ever, super actively tryna tank and fkn Paul Watson pops off out of nowhere to get us a win in a game we needed to lose.  *Sigh* I guess if we make the playoffs at least our guys will be rested"
"Magic just got beat by Paul ""Im secretly John Salmons making a come back"" Watson."
Paul Watson (DNP) [Turned into Prime Michael Jordan]
"This just in, Paul Watson and Yuta Watanabe will be resting and unavailable next game."
Next game:  Paul Watson OUT - Rest  Yuta Watanabe OUT - Rest
[Woj] Breaking: The Toronto Raptors have waived Paul Watson
Who the hell is Paul Watson?
Paul Watson Jr said fuck the tank
Magic fans bitching about the Raps resting players to then get blown out by Paul Watson and Yuta is pretty funny.
Starter Paul Watson is something different
Is Paul Watson literally God?
"Paul Watson is the living embodiment of  ""being on fire!"" right now. 12 pts in a row, 4 threes...."
So we gotta rest Paul Watson now too?
Paul Watson said fuck a tank.
imagine not having paul watson in your roster
What the absolute fuck?!?!?! Paul Watson killing it.
"Imagine thinking we were tanking without ""resting"" Paul Watson"
"This is Paul Watson coming back from COVID?!  He's fucking up the tank, but I'm still happy for him"
"WTF, Paul Watson !?! Doesn't he know we're tanking? LUL"
Paul Watson doesn't know how to tank
Deshaun Watson  Paul George  They all look the same I guess‚Ä¶  /s
that‚Äôs a powerful accusation to make especially when you wrong. you know damn well you ain‚Äôt get paul george and deshaun watson mixed up
"He'll be an UFA so if they had no intention to re-sign him, might as well get something in return. Same thing for Matt Thomas.  They have FVV and Gary Trent Jr as their guards of the future and two promising rookies in Malachi Flynn and Jalen Harris, two players who will be cheaper. They also have Paul Watson.   Overall the Raptors made 3 good trades at the deadline. We'll see what the Kings do with Davis, but if they end up re-signing him without overpaying him it'll be a good trade for them too.   My nomination for the worst trade of recent years is the Lakers trading Zubac for Muscala. Just, why?"
Jalen Harris? Paul Watson? Stanley Johnson? WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE
Damn I have no idea who Jalen Harris and Paul Watson are üò¨
"Just some incredible names on that list, but Stanley Johnson stands out. Paul Watson and Jalen Harris probably have outside fans confused too. Now we just need Malachi Flynn and Khem Birch to join the party."
Paul Watson is Ball God descended from the heavens as a blessing for your championship
Paul Watson G league legend Jalen Harris 59th pick 2020 draft
Who the fuck is Paul Watson and Jalen Harris
"I think they want players back instead of picks, maybe a Paul Watson or a Delon Wright if they can find salaries to dump/match."
"Half the league does this. Lowry, CP3, LeBron.. there was a play this year where Paul Watson Jr two-hand shoved someone trying to offensive rebound into Chris Boucher, Boucher fell over, Lowry and Nurse went all complain-y and Tim Duncan face. Like come on guys."
"He works real hard at slandering young black men for the people that pay him. That‚Äôs for sure. Praised Kevin Love for talking about depression then insults Paul George because he said he was depressed in the bubble. Caruso caught with Weed compared to Josh Gordon. Deshaun Watson Allegations vs Trevor Bauer Allegations. Theres a bigger picture a lot of people aren‚Äôt seeing. S.A.S is just the puppet for Disney, but nobody wants to talk about that or the narrative they are setting."
"Paul George getting mad in the post game interview and calling out CJ Watson for taking the last shot even thought he passed it to CJ and then did nothing to get open, IIRC"
Raptors' top 15 players not in this postseason:  |1|Pascal Siakam| --:|:--| |2|Fred VanVleet| |3|Norman Powell| |4|Kyle Lowry| |5|OG Anunoby| |6|Chris Boucher| |7|Malachi Flynn| |8|Terence Davis| |9|Aron Baynes| |10|DeAndre' Bembry| |11|Freddie Gillespie| |12|Stanley Johnson| |13|Yuta Watanabe| |14|Paul Watson| |15|Matt Thomas|
"Paul Watson Jr. is who I would cast as the super good bssketball villain at some movie. In real life, he was recently cut from the Raptors tho."
"Yeah and that's how it should be, going into a season expecting one of your 2nd round rookies or Paul Watson to be one of your 2 main guards off the bench is silly especially considering all it takes is 1 injury and now your main bench guard is a rookie who might not be NBA ready."
"Jalen Harris became the 10th different player on the Raptors to score 30 points in a game last season. He joined: Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Kyle Lowry, Gary Trent Jr., OG Anunoby, Stanley Johnson and Paul Watson.  5 of those names are likely not returning so we have 5 now."
"Paul Watson Jr. has seriously potential.   The guy has a great frame for the NBA, is a decent athlete and has a good shooting stroke. Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me to see him carve out a role on his next team."
NOT PAUL WATSON JR
"Pacers always have guys with similar names:  Paul George, George Hill, Solomon Hill, Jordan Hill.   CJ Watson,  CJ Fair, CJ Miles, Myles Turner  Both Hansbrough brothers.  2 Holiday brothers.  TJ McConnell, TJ Warren, TJ Leaf  Thad Young and Joseph Young  Solomon Jones Dhantey Jones  Jeff Foster and Jeff Ayers  Since 09 the Pacers have had at least 2 players with the same first or last name on the roster at the same time.  Edit: spelling"
"That‚Äôs also extremely inaccurate. Jalen Harris only got 2 starts and that was Game 70 and 71 out of 72.   Stanimal didn‚Äôt get regular starts until the final 7 games.   Paul Watson on the other hand, he didn‚Äôt play one minute from games 59-72 and had 2 starts all year  You suck at this man"
"it's like we started jalen harris, paul watson and stanley johnson"
sign Paul Watson Jr too for all vibes bench team
They are both really competing to get the rights to he called the new Paul Watson
"Hear me out, Paul Watson Jr"
"We waived this guy to clear a roster spot for Paul Watson, who we also waived."
Jordan was on AZ sports radio  Said an instance of Sarver being a terrible human is that he threatened to fire Earl Watson if Watson didnt fire Rich Paul because he didnt like being told what to do by powerfful black men.
"‚ÄúSarver forced Deshaun Watson to massage him. Watson was uncomfortable the entire time, especially when Sarver started yelling, ‚ÄòI AM THE SUN KING.‚Äô Sarver then removed his penis, and placed Watson‚Äôs hand on it, saying, ‚ÄòI‚Äôve had Chris Paul, you know.‚Äô Sarver denies all allegations saying, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not sure who this Deshaun Watson lady is, but I rarely bring out my penis during massages.‚Äô‚Äù"
The disrespect to Paul Watson Jr.
Paul Watson with 0 points but has a +6 net rating. Imagine what happens when he starts scoring
"best? unclear.  probably the most high-profile at this time, because they are relatively new and Rich Paul is not afraid to be aggressive for his clients and be disruptive when he thinks it is advantageous. Sometimes that works great for their clients, and other times they can get burned.  I will say as a Suns fan, the whole Bledsoe drama in 2014 and then in 2017 with Bledsoe and Earl Watson put Klutch in a pretty negative light."
"We were starting Malachi Flynn, Jalen Harris, Stanley Johnson and Paul Watson Jr  didn‚Äôt really miss them if we weren‚Äôt trying to make them"
"Sounds like a douchebag and a potentially shitty place to work but none of the stuff ive read is particularly shocking or abhorrent. The N word stuff is he said she said. The rest just sounds like a rich frat boy is in charge of an NBA franchise, lewd jokes are banned now? The shit about him giving an ultimatum to watson because he was represented by Rich Paul being framed as a racial issue is particularly stupid, he obviously wanted it to happen cause Paul basically insulted him to his face and it hurt his fragile ego. This piece is conversely making me see Watson as a bit of a weasel."
"yea, this isn't comparable to sterling.   and there's plenty in the article IMO that just feels like ""ok this is racist how?""  especially with how he wanted to fire watson after an argument with Rich paul unless Watson left the klutch group."
"Lot of this coming from Watson and Rich Paul (ew).this doesn‚Äôt come close to Sterling, he‚Äôs keeping his team"
Also Watson pointed out Rich Paul isn't his agent. His agency is Klutch but he has a different agent. Maybe Paul did offend Sarver but it's pretty unprofessional to try and force someone to cut ties for that.
Lol no it flat out wasn‚Äôt the issue. Sarver was pissed Rich Paul took a shot at him and wanted Watson to leave his agency.
"I totally agree with you here. The writer is grasping at straws a few times. I also think this inclusion is sorta stupid  &gt;Watson said he explained to Sarver the optics of a white owner asking a Black coach to fire an agency led by a Black agent, Paul.  Sarver was insulted by Paul and had already wanted Paul and Watson to break up due to conflict of interest, which makes sense.  Seems like race should be irrelevant here and they just brought it up to gaslight him"
"&gt; Through legal representation, Sarver said his issue with Klutch was solely due to a conflict of interest -- that a coach and a player could not be represented by the same agent. Sarver denied that the conversation had anything to do with race. Watson, when told of Sarver's response, said: ""Rich [Paul] was never my agent."" Watson was represented by Klutch Sports, which is owned by Paul.  &gt; ""Guess who did my contract when I got hired to be a head coach [with the Suns]? Klutch,"" Watson said. ""If Klutch did my contract, wouldn't [the Suns] have just told me, 'We can't sign you because it's a conflict of interest?' They did my interim contract, and they did my other contract. They did two contracts for me.""  Jfc Sarver can't even get his stories straight. Also, I seriously better not see a single scumbag in this thread bitching about cancel culture. This shit is abhorrent, so keep your dumbass thoughts to yourself."
I don't think Paul Watson is the guy to push us over the top this year.
"I‚Äôm not sure fully but in addition to that, Sarver apparently told Watson he needed to fire Rich Paul because of the Eric Bledsoe extension or something with that and Watson said no because Klutch was his agency when he signed on initially as an interim then when he got promoted to head coach klutch did the paperwork. So he refused to fire klutch, so apparently Sarver fired him for that as well"
"If you read the story, Watson kind of suggested to Sarver he would make it a race thing if Sarver wanted him to get rid of Rich Paul. He also says what Sarvers problem is with Rich Paul, and it has nothing to do with race at all. Like, not even close.     James Jones is also quoted as saying Watson was toxic and saying shit that didn't represent the suns value on more than one occasion.      Like Watson certainly sounds like he has an axe to grind and had threatened him with this."
"""Blatant racism""  isn't slamming papers on a desk dude.      The allegations of him saying the N word are coming from Earl Watson, who they fired for being toxic. Who is quoted in this article as having suggested to Sarver that he would make it a race issue if he wanted him to get rid of Rich Paul. It wasn't a race issue, considering they also said he was mad at Rich Paul for telling him he didn't know anything about basketball. He was just pissed Rich Paul insulted him. Nothing to do with race.      I'm not speaking on what is or isn't offensive, but this report isn't nearly the bombshell it was made out to be."
"I'm confused how firing Watson would hurt either Watson or Paul, aren't coaches contracts fully guanteed the moment it is signed? The only thing I can think of is if Sarver knew Watson wouldn't get another job in the NBA again, but if you have a coach no one else wants do you even want that coach?"
"A lot of the allegations of explicitly racist stuff that weren't him being out of touch and quoting someone saying the n-word like 15 years ago seem to be sourced from Earl Watson, but a lot of the Watson anecdotes seem to not make very much sense to me.   &gt;""I don't like diversity,"" Sarver replied, according to Watson and a basketball operations staffer with knowledge of the interaction.  Racist or not, this just seems unlikely to me given the other quotes in the article and Sarver's philanthropic projects.  &gt;""Yeah, I will f---ing fire you,"" Sarver told Watson. ""You have 10 days to think about it. Don't wait too long.""  &gt;Watson said he explained to Sarver the optics of a white owner asking a Black coach to fire an agency led by a Black agent, Paul.  &gt;""Yeah, I understand what race you two are,"" Sarver replied, according to Watson. ""So I'm asking you, How bad do you want your job?""  The whole article was really bad, especially the misogyny and clear violations of basic consent, but I had higher expectations for far more clear cut and well substantiated hateful racism given what was leaked. This article makes it seem more like he's a massive asshole and just somewhat insensitive of language around race. I wonder if the person who leaked this was coming out was trying to soften the blow for Sarver."
"I mean, it is easy to pile on in these cases, but some of this doesn't really make a lot of sense.   -- It talks about how Sarver hired Lindsay Hunter and Earl Watson because they were black. There is the issue that they say he was using the n-word, but looking at the hires themselves, the article seems to be implying that hiring black coaches was somehow racist in and of itself. It seems like the writer is trying to have it both ways.   -- Meanwhile, it says Sarver said he hates diversity, but how can we reconcile that with the fact that the Suns employ a Black GM, black coach, and have had several previous black coaches in recent years?  -- There is this whole discussion of Watson and Rich Paul, where somehow Watson concludes he felt a whole ""ownership thing"" by Sarver, but none of the story -- whoever's version you believe -- seems to suggest there was a racism thing. One side suggested he was insulted by Paul and that's why Watson was told to fire him, and the other that there was a conflict of interest. To be honest, Watson's response to the conflict thing was really weak -- Rich paul wasn't ever his agent? What? He *own's* the whole agency. Anyway, this whole anecdote doesn't really suggest Sarver was particularly bad about anything in my mind. Yeah, maybe a jerk, but that's about it.  -- There is this story about Watson saying Sarver called him F-ing Toxic, but even Watson said *he* called Sarver toxic first. So how is this only on Sarver?  -- The story starts with this anecdote about him quoting the n-word. Okay, but then has the current Suns GM, President, the NBA spkesperson, and the NBAPA president all say they haven't heard any stories like this. How could this guy be a rampant racist and there have been *no* reports to the NBA or player's association from players??  -- There is a story about he shared a picture of his wife in a suns bikini, as if this is some sort of sexism. Really? To be honest, it sounds more sexist to say a picture of a woman in a swimsuit is somehow wrong than the other way around.  Anyway.... I'm not even gonna keep ready this. Maybe he is racist and sexist, but I find this article to be pretty unconvincing. The only person really saying anything is Watson, and that means something, but the guy could be a disgruntled person trying to get back at a guy he feels mistreated him. It wouldn't be the first time."
"&gt; In the case of the Oct. 30, 2016, game versus the Warriors, Sarver and his lawyers wrote that Sarver did not have that conversation with Watson but had one with a Suns player who had received a technical foul for what they said was using the N-word during the game. Sarver said he encouraged the player to appeal the technical foul because Green had used the word in the game -- the technical foul was later rescinded by the league.  &gt; Sarver denied Watson's characterization of the incident: ""This is absolutely untrue. I remember the game and topic clearly. I of course never used the word myself. During this conversation, I said 'N-word' without saying the full word. The word itself never crossed my lips.  I don't get this. So he denies having that conversation with Watson, but then in the next paragraph says Watson's characterization is incorrect, meaning there *was* a conversation? Unless he's saying a similar conversation took place, but it wasn't with Watson and Watson also misremembered.  &gt; Paul responded to Sarver's remarks by saying that he knew basketball and that they ""weren't talking about tennis,"" Sarver's childhood sport.  This was a dick move by Paul though lol."
"&gt; Contract talks eventually led Bledsoe's Klutch Sports agent, Rich Paul, to communicate directly with Sarver -- the Suns owner didn't want to extend Bledsoe's contract in part due to concerns about Bledsoe's durability, plus concerns that the team had performed poorly with him as the starting point guard, according to sources at the time. Paul responded to Sarver's remarks by saying that he knew basketball and that they ""weren't talking about tennis,"" Sarver's childhood sport.  &gt;Sarver erupted at the dig, according to two people with knowledge of the interaction, telling Paul he was going to fire Watson as the team's head coach if Watson didn't sever ties with Klutch, which had been representing Watson, within 10 days - just after the start of the season.  &gt;Watson said that Sarver's ultimatum quickly reached him. He asked Sarver if he was serious.  &gt;""Yeah, I will f---ing fire you,"" Sarver told Watson. ""You have 10 days to think about it. Don't wait too long.""  What the hell."
"Judging by how much Sarver and Earl Watson were beefing over Klutch, I'm going to guess Rich Paul."
