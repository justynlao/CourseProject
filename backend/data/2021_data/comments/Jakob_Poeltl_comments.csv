"Defense for the spurs comes down to whether or not Lamarcus is on the floor   Line ups with Poeltl- especially the Murray/Vassell/Gay arrangement, are among the best in the league defensively if not the best by some metrics.  Pop has started giving Jakob the end of the third and almost the entire 4th to match him with the other teams starting unit. By playoff time he will be for all intents and purposes our starting center."
"A lot of Spurs fans agree with you, LMA is way too old and slow and his defence has been horrible for the most part.  But we still need him to play at least 20-25min a game because we only have two NBA level centers. Without LMA our centre rotation is crap and we get blown apart.  Another thing is that our backup center (Jakob Poeltl) has no shooting, so his offensive production is almost zero. So we need LMA to play and spread the floor for 25min or so."

"Yet Poeltl was drafted before Domas who went 11th behind Dragon Bender, Marquese Chriss , Jakob  Poeltl and Thon Maker among others. The Bucks could have teamed Domas with Giannis but instead took Maker."

Jakob Poeltl. Seems like once a game he gets called for a moving screen that's just a normal NBA moving screen and he picks up a lot of fouls.
I thought Jakob Poeltl was a solid paint protector? What happened?
GG bro. I was very impressed with Jakob Poeltl. He neutralized Eric Paschall who was coming of a couple of great games.
"And Jakob Poeltl, because who doesn't love Jak"
how is Jakob Poeltl? i watched 1 other spurs game this season and it seemed like he was feasting
"Knicks Receive: Andrea Bargnani  Raptors Receive: Marcus Camby, Steve Novak, Quentin Richardson, 2016 1st, 2014 2nd, 2017 2nd  - Camby waived  - Richardson waived  - Novak packaged with 2017 2nd and moved for Dionte Garrett (waived)  - 2014 2nd became Xavier Thames, traded to Nets for cash  - 2016 1st became 9th overal, Jakob Poeltl, who was later part of the package that acquired Kawhi Leonard"
"They have 4 intriguing young players + White and Poeltl who look like solid role players.   Dejounte Murray - Primary Ball Handler, Point of Attack  Lonnie Walker - Secondary Ball Handler, Helper  Devin Vassell - Stationary Shooter, Wing Stopper  Keldon Johnson - Athletic Finisher, Helper  Jakob Poeltl - Roll + Cut Big, Anchor Big  Derrick White - Primary Ball Handler, Point of Attack  Murray, Vassell, Johnson, and Poeltl look like surefire starters. The question then becomes between Lonnie Walker or Derrick White as a starter and whether you want to use Walker off the bench as a bucket gettor like Tim Hardaway has been at times or Will Barton is for the Nuggets, or you want to use Derrick White off the bench to run your offense like Marcus Smart does for the Celtics.   Johnson is intriguing from the standpoint that he might be able to play some small-ball 5 in the future with how strong he is ala a PJ Tucker. Poeltl is really good for a center, but drop coverage becomes untenable in the playoffs, and you have to be able to switch 1-5. That's why it's not crazy that in the future they could close with Murray-White-Walker-Vassell-Johnson."

"Good mental wont fix his shot. He just didn't focus on shooting and he doesn't have the reps that most NBA players got. Even if he works his ass off and has a clear mind it's going to be a while to see results if we ever would.   The only history I can think of of a non-shooter becoming a respect-worthy one is Brook Lopez and he was already a good FT shooter so he had the basic skills already.    It's unfair to expect Simmons to develop a shot just like it is for Dwight, or Capela, or Jakob Poeltl, or Drummond, or Gobert."
Jakob Poeltl with the first ever ‘fine’ game of the season!!
&gt;[Post Game Thread] The San Antonio Spurs (7-6) defeat the Houston Rockets (4-7) by a score of 103-91 behind 13 points from Jakob Poeltl  I think this is more impactful
We paid Jakob more than Boucher got lol. Poeltl is awful on offense compared to him.

"Which celebrity is this? Dan-Knee-Dove-Eat-Toe  That’s how a mad gab should be done!  For example, Yak-of-Port-Hole would be a better example for Jakob Poeltl"
"Could probably benefit from the services of Keldon Johnson and Jakob Poeltl, too.  WELP"
I always knew Jakob Poeltl was the king of LA
"As of today, A Russell Westbrook 3-pointer (22.7%) is more likely to go in than a Jakob Poeltl free throw (12.5%)"
"You seriously don’t think the Spurs would offer DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl and a 1st round pick for Harden?  Clearly he can get a better return than the Kawhi trade."
Oh yeah? Well Jakob Poeltl has missed 13 free throws in a row. Try to beat that!
"Did you actually watch the game yesterday? Because this comment pretty much confirms you didn't. DeMar didn't guard Davis, like at all. Keldon Johnson, Derrick White, Jakob Poeltl and Drew Eubanks were the primary defenders for him for the entirety of the game.   I'm not disagreeing that DeMar is a bad defender but you sure as hell didn't come to that conclusion by watching the game..."
"RAPTOR is a dumb measurement, don’t think too much about it. No measurement that has Jakob Poeltl as the 18th best player in the league should be taken seriously. Anyone who says to “ignore the outliers” is wrong, you can’t ignore that their formula arrives at outright bad conclusions. It’s a core flaw and having Jokic at the top (which every advanced stat has) doesn’t make it legitimate. VORP and LEBRON are for the most part fine except LEBRON overrates Fred Van Vleet a ton so it has its own quirks. Overall, I don’t like these wholistic stats all that much because they are developed with subjective ideas of a hierarchy of value. As far as Westbrook goes though in VORP and LEBRON he’s a fringe 3rd team All-NBA which is pretty reflective of his season this year (although I think he shouldn’t be fringe All-NBA, he should be a 3rd team lock)."

The thing is giving up assets to extend him for 17M/year was an awful deal. You could've signed Jakob Poeltl for like 13M/year outright and he's better than Adams or gone after Christian Wood.
"I can’t find the specific numbers so this may be wrong, but I know demar derozan’s on/off splits have been better since Jakob Poeltl got inserted into the starting lineup and Lamarcus Aldridge got bought out, do the numbers back me up?"
ah so you don't watch games he's been a world class defender all year.  &gt;Comparing individual defensive FG% to team defensive FG% Jakob Poeltl is the #1 defender in the @NBA when he's on the floor. Jakob limits opponets to 38.2% shooting vs. the Spurs overall 47.4%:

"&gt; And of those players, my opinion is that Jakob is better than Sabonis and Ayton.   This is such a bad take. I like Poeltl but he's not as good as Ayton or Sabonis. Like, at all. That being said, the question was top 5 centers. Even if you think he's better than those two, which he's not, that makes him #6 or #7 at best. So why are you even in here talking about Jakob Poeltl lol. This is homerism on some next level"
"“Dylan Carter covered in-depth just how underrated Jakob actually is on both ends. Carter also tweeted some staggering stats, chief among them is how Jakob’s defensive field goal percentage was tied with Rudy Gobert at the time at a blistering 42.8 percent (now 42.2).”  https://airalamo.com/2021/04/23/jakob-poeltl-underrated-where-ranks-among-nba-centers/  “With Poeltl off the court this season, San Antonio has a defensive rating of 113.5, which ranks 22nd in the league. When he plays, that number drops all the way down to 106.7, a figure that would be the best in the NBA. More importantly, Cleaning the Glass omits “garbage time” from these stats, so Poeltl isn’t just helping the Spurs put up empty numbers when games have already been decided.  Of course, it’s worth mentioning that these are team stats rather than individual ones, but Poeltl still ranks in the 89th percentile among all players when it comes to on/off defensive rating. His impact is evident in other metrics too, such as FiveThirtyEight’s overall defensive RAPTOR and ESPN’s Defensive Regularized Plus-Minus (DRPM), where he ranks 1st and 8th, respectively.”  https://www.poundingtherock.com/2021/3/26/22349444/jakob-poeltl-san-antonio-overall-impact   What I said is not controversial. It’s an opinion that I have that is based on games I watch and articles I read."

"We had 4 starters out. Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, DeMar DeRozan, and Jakob Poeltl. I'd say they're our 4 most important players too"
"Neither is inherently more beneficial, it just depends on the degree of “good” each centre is offensively or defensively  For instance, Jokic &gt; Gobert &gt; KAT &gt; Bam &gt; Wood &gt; Jakob Poeltl is a perfectly reasonable ranking that alternates between offence and defence minded centres."

"Underrated by analysts: demar derozan. Analysts act like it’s just straight up impossible to build a good team with him on it but I just don’t see why. Yes he’s not an ideal spacer or defender, but he’s an above average playmaker, takes care of the ball, is a very good scorer, and honestly it’s not like defenses treat him like Ben Simmons.  Underrated by counting stats: Jakob Poeltl (homer take but I do believe this), Dorian finney smith, Zubac  Underrated by casuals: Paul George. He does say some things that make him unlikable at times but casuals also treat him like he isn’t a top 15 player at worst.   Underrated season: Terry Rozier, Paul George again, Robert Williams (I think he’s shown promise as a long term starting center), kinda TJ McConnell."
Nah Jakob Poeltl is the most underrated at this moment.

Different position granted, but that's a double standard. Why should some players be able to play significantly less and make the all-NBA team? Yes, LeBron and Embiid are beasts when they play, but Harden's still an amazing player, even if he doesn't need to score as much anymore.*  Kyrie (1585), CP3 (1872), PG13 (1548), Randle (2251!), Gobert (1833)  *Randle currently leads the league in minutes, which Jokic just behind.

Currently listed as week-to-week.*  Best unmentioned players by RAPTOR: Clint Capela, Mike Conley, FVV, Jrue Holiday, Jamal Murray, Draymond Green, Jakob Poeltl, Joe Harris, Joe Ingles, and Thaddeus Young. Anthony Davis (800) and Kevin Durant (812) played too few minutes, but have been effective in their limited time."
"He was a highly regarded center prospect drafted #2 overall in the draft. Who should I compare him to, jakob poeltl? As far as his job being harder... How? Dude is playing next to Draymond Green who is a phenomenal defender capable of covering up mistakes and helping him on the court. He's playing on a great offense that can feed him easy looks. I think he's in a pretty good situation, one that has made plenty of other guys look great who weren't great. On his own team he's playing far far far worse than Kevon Looney. I would expect the #2 pick in the draft and #1 center taken to be at least as good as a replacement level big."

I for one find the lack of Jakob Poeltl in this list offensive
It's definitely a bad contract but it's not terrible. The real head scratcher is that the pelicans gave up assets to have the opportunity to give Adams 17M/year in an offseason where guys like Christian Wood signed for less and Jakob Poeltl and Chris Boucher signed for like half the amount per year.
"*banned from Twitch*  Fuck Sampson  Also allow me to simp for Jakob ""100% FT"" Poeltl"
"Disagree, Jakob Poeltl 😤"
"Well, I dunno man ... pretty sure Jakob Poeltl scored the winning basket there"
Jakob Poeltl over two all stars in Vuc and Sabonis. Anybody seen these guys in some clown cars lately?
Jakob Poeltl jealous rn
I heard Dannt say Jakob Poeltl is his DPOY or some shit

Thr unsung hero of the Spurs - Jakob Poeltl
Jakob Poeltl for sure. Recently the team has looked much worse when Dejounte isn't playing.
"The pelicans are an awful defensive team, it's not like he's that great. Giving up assets to pay him 17M/year in an offseason where Jakob Poeltl signed for 9M/year and Christian Wood signed for 14M/year was obviously a mistake."
Show some respect to Jakob lol. At least our Poeltl knows how to improve his FT shooting
I'd say so. His offense is not what you want out of a max level player. His outside shooting and free throws are basically on the level of Jakob Poeltl.  Also I think it's time to give up on him ever becoming even okay at shooting from outside. This is his fourth year of playing and fifth year in the NBA. He almost refuses to shoot from more than like 12 ft from the rim.
This thread is looking better than [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ms2ady/duncd_on_podcast_center_rankins/) after Nate Duncan ranked Ayton 12th in the league 2 months ago behind players like Porzingis and Jakob Poeltl.
"He's the only reason they weren't a lottery team this year, the playmaking advantages alone far outweigh the defensive limitations. It's not close either.  Would you rather have Jakob Poeltl or Trae Young? Elite scoring and playmaking matters WAY more than individual defense, even elite rim protection, in the modern NBA because the rules really limit defense in general."
The man put Jakob Poeltl over Sabonis and Vucevic. That’s all you need to know about it
"Some guys I was REALLY high on at recent Celtics draft positions:  -  * 2020, Pick #26: **Tyrell Terry** – got Payton Pritchard instead  * 2019, Pick #14: **Sekou Doumbouya or Goga Bitadze** – I'd still take either over Romeo Langford but none are really blowing up the league  * 2017, Pick #1: **Markelle Fultz** – got Jayson Tatum instead  * 2016, Pick #3: Take **Dragan Bender** or trade down and get **Jakob Poeltl** – got Jaylen Brown instead  * 2014, Pick #6: I thought **Noah Vonleh** was the new Chris Bosh – got Marcus Smart instead"
Jakob Poeltl is seriously better than Porzingis I'm crying
I've tried telling him that and even said that the whole Warriors team had reduced raw totals to play winning basketball. He insisted that KD is LITERALLY wide open all the time because of his teammates and even in OKC teams were looking to contain Westbrook more.   Oh and btw he also said that Jonas Valanciunas can stop prime Olajuwon because today's players are that much better  Edit: I made a mistake. He actually said Jakob Poeltl can stop Hakeem.
Spurs really traded this man for a late 1st DeMar Derozan and Jakob fucking poeltl lmao
so you think Jakob Poeltl is a better defender than Embiid?
"And all the Clippers get in return is Demar Derozan, Jakob Poeltl, and no draft compensation lol?"
Ben is as good of a shooter as guys like Jakob Poeltl and Jarrett Allen
Rondo and Caruso are way better shooters than Simmons. Simmons has the same level of shooting as a guy like Jakob Poeltl or Clint Capela
Jakob Poeltl but he gets caught twice a game at least :(
"looking at it now. Clint Capela #10, Fred VanVleet #17 (above Beal), Mikal Bridges #19 (the highest Sun), Jakob Poeltl #21 (one above CP3)... needs some work"
"I don’t want to make this a “rim protector vs perimeter defender” argument, but a “What can Rudy do defensively vs what can Ben Simmons do Defensively” argument. Even if you have Gobert as the best rim protector in the league, you can ask Jakob Poeltl, Myles Turner, Joel Embiid, and some other rim protecting bigs to do what Gobert does and they would be able to do a good enough job doing it (not on the level that Gobert can). My point is that centers that protect the paint, play in drop coverage and contest shots at the rim are more common than guys that can guard all 5 positions like Ben Simmons can. There isn’t anything that guys like him and Draymond can’t do defensively and that defensive profile is extremely rare"
how do you go 9-20 from the FT line without Andre Drummond/Deandre Jordan/Jakob Poeltl
"Ah yes, the Jakob Poeltl syndrome"
EXCUSE ME SIR JAKOB POELTL IS VERY REAL  He just can't box out :(
"Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, Jakob Poeltl, Lonnie Walker, Luka Samanic, Tre Jones. I feel like Eubanks would certainly be taken from us. He is a decent backup 5 on a minimum for two more years."
"Imagine what Chuck Daly could've done with Aron Baynes, Davis Bertans, Tiago Splitter, Fabricio Oberto, Rasho Nesterovic, Jakob Poeltl."

"I was watching the Lebron buzzer beater game the other day and it is remarkable how many good players the Raptors had that year. Derozan, Lowry, Valanciunas, Ibaka, and a young OG anunoby was a very good starting 5 if that’s what they would choose to run. They also had (albeit before any of their primes) Fred Van Vleet, Norman Powell, Pascal Siakam, and Jakob Poeltl. One of the deepest rosters I’ve seen, set for the present and the future."
he could’ve had he traded w the lakers and actually got talent back instead of jakob poeltl
It's Jakob Poeltl!!
"We got Big Body and Jakob ""80% of Rudy Gobert for 20% of the price"" Poeltl in that trade babyyyyyy"
How do you get Jakob Poeltl instead of OG or Pascal
"Last offseason: Derrick Favors making 9.7m  Jakob Poeltl making 8.7m  Ibaka making 9.5m  Robin Lopez making 7.3m  The only thing Olynyk has over these guys is opportunity because *someone* had to score baskets for a tanking Houston that ended up worse than Detroit or Orlando.  The market for older role-playing only Cs with middy skillsets is a lot less robust than you think.  if you want to present me a genuine counterfactual, im not above changing my opinion."
Jakob Poeltl?
"The crazy thing about Robert Williams aside from being an advanced stats darling, or his stellar passing especially throwing lobs to others, ability to change the trajectory of almost anyone's shot, and change the time continuum. He's consistently one of the best shot blockers in the game.  He's ranked 9th in the league with 91 blocks per game.  This was something I'm always in awe of, because I was looking at his statistics on BBall-Reference two days ago, and he's ahead of players like Embiid, Giannis, and Jarrett Allen. All players well known for their defensive capabilities/weakside or shot blocking help.  And he's done this in 985 minutes.  |1. Rudy Gobert|2187 MPG|190 blocks| |:-|:-|:-| |2. Myles Turner|1455 MPG|159 blocks| |3. Nerlens Noel|1547 MPG|141 blocks| |4. Clint Capela|1898 MPG|129 blocks| |5. Jakob Poeltl|1845 MPG|123 blocks| |6. Chris Boucher|1453 MPG|111 blocks| |7. Brook Lopez|1902 MPG|103 blocks| |8. Richaun Holmes|1782 MPG|96 blocks| |9. Robert Williams|985 MPG|91 blocks| |18. Giannis Antetokounmpo|2013 MPG|73 blocks| |21. Joel Embiid|1585 MPG|69 Blocks|  What a freakin' beast. If the dude could just stay healthy, he makes us that much better as a team for real."
"Not with Jakob ""Literally Bill Russell"" Poeltl leading us 😏"
"Honestly I wouldn't feel that bad about it, even kinda positive about it tbh. We recently talked about it our sub so I'll leave you down here my thoughts!  I like it, really. What we mainly need is a PF that can play for a couple of years while our prospects at this position (Samanic+Future Picks) develop. Kuzma is good for this! He has a 2+PO Contract; he earns 13M, not that much and in case really tradable; relatively young; played under not that great circumstances; Pop and our development stuff can fix some stuff, Lakers' one is not great and it showed with other young players they traded away. I mean, defintely let's not consider him as a cornerstone of the franchise, he is not, but he can be a great rotational piece for us while better prospects develop! Also, I highly doubt the trade would be just Kuzma, but other stuff will be included. The 22th Pick alone would be awesome, imagine attached to Kuzma too! Also maybe another filler that we can maybe flip for a couple of 2nds, we don't have one in 2022 so...  We are not that trash. With guys like DJ, Derrick, Keldon... we ain't doing what OKC did, we will still try to win games. For example Samanic could start next year, but he is just not ready for that role yet, also we tend to develop prospects slowly in roder to avoid major issues in the future. Also, if we somehow these projects show they deserve more, then just bench Kuz or even trade him, he has a nice contract (13M, 2yrs+PO).  Yeah, I mean, you kinda know my ideas on this team and that I'm really high on basically anyone and I think they all gonna make a major if not a solid jump next year if we finally decide to part away with all our vets. DeMar, as much as I love him, really, I just think that wasn't THAT important on our team if we had Derrick. I mean, we will prolly be a bit worse, but not that much in my opinion. Consider also that defense and size was a big problem last year and without DeMar this will go away, not fully, but still a bit.  Now lemme be the GM for the sake of doing it, you know I like it lmao. So, we will now assume that the [trade](https://imgur.com/qxd8AUj) goes through. LAL get: DeMar DeRozan / SAS get: Kyle Kuzma + Montrezl Harrell + 22th Pick. We then decide to trade Harrell to the Hornets and we get the 57th Pick (via Nets) and the 2022 2nd Round Pick (via Raptors). We do this because we will get a big in the draft and we will play him. We know have the 12th Pick, the 22nd Pick, the 41st Pick, the 57th Pick. (sadly for you lmao) I assume that the player I will choose are available so in order we draft: Alperen Sengun, Ziaire Williams, Isaiah Todd, Ibou Badji. Sengun will immediately play off the bench behind Jakob. I would be surprised tho if Drew played over him at the beginning of the season and they shared minutes. Ziaire Williams had a really inefficient season with Stanford and has ton of things to work on so I wouldn't be surprised if he spent most of his time in the G-League and I'm a fan of it, it went really good for us! Isaiah Todd most definitely will play with Austin, he has things to work on too. Ibou Badji then is my favourite prospect in this draft (I even made [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/od6bo9/ibou_dianko_badji_15_every_highlights_13p_8r_7b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)/[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/odv548/ibou_dianko_badji_15_green_jersey_highlights_23p/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Highlights for the U19 World Cup), he has a crazy high potential for me and taking a gamble with such a low pick is the real deal, all assuming he doesn't withdraw and he is available. He would be a Draft and Stash in Barcelona. If he does withdraw, then idk, maybe ask something else instead to Charlotte or maybe just select someone else.  At the end, as you know I love lmao, here is the final table! I would be kinda excited tbh.  |*Starters*|*Bench Unit*|*Third String*| |:-|:-|:-| |Dejounte Murray|Tre Jones|*Brad Wanamaker*| |Derrick White|Lonnie Walker IV|Wayne Ellington| |Keldon Johnson|Devin Vassell|Ziaire Williams| |Kyle Kuzma|Luka Samanic|Isaiah Todd| |Jakob Poeltl|Alperen Sengun|Drew Eubanks ^(+Ibou Badji (Draft&amp;Stash))|  For minutes I would say the same things I said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)."
"Derrick White is at least as good as Dejounte. Our bench is above average - Rudy Gay is one of the best backup 4s in the whole league. Patty Mills was on fire the first half of the season. Trey Lyles who is an okay backup 4 lost all his minutes because our depth was good. Also Jakob Poeltl was literally one of the best rim protectors in the entire league this season based on stats, similar percentages as Rudy Gobert on less volume.  Our defense constantly looked disorganized this season, giving up a lot of easy transition buckets for no reason and our fast breaks on offense looked terrible.  There was absolutely no way we would end up with a similar record as the injured rockets, blatantly tanking thunder, injured wolves, pistons with a jobbing Griffin, injured magic, or the cavs who were basically paying 30M for nothing without significant injuries."
Idk just spitballing but:  Luka Doncic  Dirk Nowitzki  Brian Scalabrine  Tyler Herro  Alex Caruso  Duncan Robinson  Larry Bird  John Stockton  Bob Cousy  Bob Pettit  Mark Eaton  John Havlicek  Mike Bibby  Maxi Kleber  Jordan Farmar  Zach Collins  Jusuf Nurkic  Nikola Jokic  Frank Kaminsky  Dario Saric  Joe Ingles  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Bojan Bogdanovic  Klay Thompson  Alen Smailagic  Svi Mykhailuk  David Lee  Arvydas Sabonis  Domantas Sabonis  Pau Gasol  Marc Gasol  Luke Kennard  Dragan Bender  Alex Len  Ricky Rubio  Cole Aldrich  Cedi Osman  Mike Dunleavy  Mike Miller  Bill Laimbeer  Tommy Heinsohn  Kelly Olynyk  Kevin Love  Ryan Anderson  Grayson Allen  Zydrunas Ilgauskas  Nikola Vucevic  Mario Hezonja  Boban Marjanovic  Davis Bertans  Gordon Hayward  Matt Thomas  Chase Budinger  Steve Kerr  Luc Longley  Jeff Hornacek  Brian Cardinal  Chris Kaman  Steve Blake  Tomas Satoransky  Jakob Poeltl  Manu Ginobili  Luke Babbitt  Kevin Huerter  JJ Barea  Dan Majerle  Tom Chambers  Tyler Zeller  Cody Zeller  Mason Plumlee  Tyler Hansbrough  Sam Merrill  Nico Mannion  Peja Stojakovic  Pete Maravich  Those are just my top 75 idk they all have something about them that makes them great
"They have 3 actual contracts left on the team at this point.   Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, and Jakob Poeltl.   What free agents are looking at that and going ""Yeah this is where we want to spend the next portion of our careers""?  Not to mention Pop is going to be 73 heading into next season.   The only free agent they've ever really gotten was Aldridge, and he went when they had Kawhi, Duncan, the rest of their amazing supporting cast, and fresh off of a 55 win seasons (two seasons removed from a championship).   You can have an infinite amount of cap space but if you're not primed to win then it's not going to get you anywhere."
Jakob Poeltl is the Wilt Chamberlain of this era in terms of him being tall and using both hands to catch rebounds. Without his hands and his height he probably wouldn't be an NBA player.
Excuse me but I think you forgot about Keldon Johnson and Jakob Poeltl
"Yeah, because they traded Jakob Poeltl as part of the Kawhi trade and once Gasol left they had no centers. If Jak wasn't included they have a replacement and they don't need to go after Baynes"
"Not our problem anymore, we have future finals mvp Jakob Poeltl now"
"He's not really a stuff-the-stat-box guy, but he's good. While they are different types, he reminds me of Jakob Poeltl in that way. His value isn't immediately apparent if you just read the box. Gotta watch him. I'd be happy if he played for my team."
"glad to see some positive takes on the comment section here!  i'll answer op tho. no, we definitely not. i gotta say that we really went undercover this season, i really doubt ppl saw spurs games outside of when their favourite team played us, maybe even not. we are currently seen as a trash team, it's easy to see everyone calling us out to ""click the rebuilding button"" but the situation here is way different from the common understading of us. i even made a extremely long [**post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) if you wanna give it a try! ^(i don't wanna  pass for a spammer lmoa, but that's my complete point of view, just if you want) . Anyway, what ppl mainly do not realize IMO is our core. It seems crazy to me how much even spurs fans undervalue the potential of our young guns, and also that we have ton of them. My main counterpoint is this: OP falls into the same trap kinda everyone fall into: not give them enough time. (it's not a dissing, chill out, sorry if i ever offend you in any way, not my intention) There have ton of bad coincidences in our development route and if you don't follow the Spurs with attention it's easy to miss them. We don't do the same things other teams do, rookies do not get playing time, vets eat young players' playing time. I'll go player by player: Keldon Johnson just finished his sophomore season, but in his rookie year he only played in the bubble for us, he did'nt even played three digits games in the NBA! And he was played out of his position too, guarding crazy opponets like Zion, AD, LBJ, literally always the best forward on the opposing team. DJ spent his rookie season in the G-League, then got a solid amount of minutes in the second season, he torn his ACL in preaseaon headed to his 3rd season, he came back after this devastating injury and already Spurs fans wanted to give up on him because he did not perform that well, and last season he was clearly our briightest young player. Oh, he was in the 2nd Defensive Team according to bball-index. Derrick White again spent his rookie season in the G-League, then got solid minutes because of DJ's injury, in the third season then played ok, but in the Bubble showed a crazy improvement (check out his stats there) and was clearly our best player, even arguably better than DeMar; this season tho he injured his foot twice, his toe twice, got COVID, injured his ankle, could stay healthy; he did need time to get back to his bubble form and when he did man he was amazing, just again clearly our best player. Assuming he stays healthy, dude is a baller, cannot wait till he get recognized. Devin Vassell, our rookie, our 4th lottery pick ever, seems like everyoen forgot about him, which is crazy. Dude is arugably one of the best defender in the team and even his rookie class, jsut amazing. He got COVID and then he couldn't buy a shot. Also, he didn't get those many minutes, again, for the reason I explained before, we tend to overplay the vets. Definitely a bright future. Lonnie Walker is a polarizing player in the sub, but probalby got asked to do too much, but he absolutely he didn't play that well, but now let's not act like he was complete garbage. Obviously he needs to work a lot this offseason, especially on defense and BBIQ plays, but he really stepped up in terms of offense, he polished his jumpshot and his ability to finish at the rim. He came to the league as a raw talent, spent his first year in Austin, second one barely got minutes because of Forbes, Belinelli, COVID. Last season he finally got minutes and he did ok, maybe not as much as everyone expected, himself included. Next season I gonna be really important for Lonnie! I think that he could be able to have good defensive player with him on the court that can help him and cover his weaknesses. Also, he will come off the bench and won't start. So playing against weaker opponents, being probably the go-to-guy oon offense off the bench, without DeRozan who is not a good defender and instead have Tre and Devin, extremely valid defender, will help him. If he still struggle a lot, decisions have to be taken, definitely. I'm still a huge believer. Then Jakob Poeltl stepped up this season and has been a really good player for us, an underrated defender, i think the best one in terms of contesting the shots under the rim in the whole league, he got into the 3rd defensive team for bbal-index too! Consider also dudes like Tre Jones and Luka Samanic who have a solid chance to be good role players for us too.  I also gotta admit the we didn't rightly used our resources yeah. DeMar clearly do not fit us and we should have traded him before and the deadline was our last chance, unless we pull an extension-and-trade, we will lose him for nothing, we could have gotten at least a Pick around 20s. Also we misplayed many players that damaged our young guys fit in the team. for example by playing bad defenders like forbes and demar, dj had had a tough time that season, and this was mad clear, white should have played alongside dj like we do now. in the bubble jakob showed how aldridge wasn't good for us anymore and we should have traded him immediately, we did not and lost him for nothing. also this season, lonnie and demar were bad defensibily, it was clear also that keldon was playing outside of his natural position. i do not wanna sound like an homer lmao, even thoon my inside i know i am at least a little bit, but this is my point of view.  TLDR: so yeah, it comes down to ajust these things and finally move on and leave the keys to the young guys even if it means lose more. i think tho he ready to at least compete for the 8th seed, these guys are really mad hungry and have the right mentality to get to the next level one day, we just need to give them time and the right playing time! cannot wait for next season! also, we have ton of cap space. oh, i urge you again to watch my full post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)"
They do enforce it! Just on Jakob Poeltl tho...
Jakob Poeltl is an all-defense player at 8m a year
Turner would have been perfect for the Spurs if Jakob Poeltl didn't take the DPOY step this season.
embiid for jakob poeltl  thats how stupid your trade sounds
"That's because we don't have anyone who is worth building around. Dejounte is a nice player, but he still can't consistently shoot the ball and he'll be 25 at the start of the season. He's not going to morph into an All-NBA guard at this point.  Derrick White looks like he's best suited to be a 3rd guard, has trouble staying healthy, and he'll be 27 in a couple of weeks. This might just be who he is. The ceiling for that backcourt isn't a title. Then what do we have? Lonnie Walker is one of the worst rotation players in the NBA on both ends.  Keldon Johnson gets lost on defense and can't shoot yet. Devin Vassel looks like a role player.  Jakob Poeltl is a 25 MPG defensive center who can't do shit on offense.   I have never been high on Ben Simmons, but he's better than anybody on our roster."
"We already have great value Gobert in Jakob Poeltl, so I guess it's more or less the same result"
Like any credible NBA journalists will tell you that defensive metrics are bullshit. According those analytics Jakob Poeltl is the second best defender in the league. But hey it's whats going to help them cope with the realization that they really paid this dude 205 million over 5 years.
Probably something like this ignoring injuries:  Jaylen Brown  Jamal Murray  Ben Simmons  Brandon Ingram  Pascal Siakam  Domantas Sabonis  Malcolm Brogdon  Dejounte Murray  Caris LeVert  Buddy Hield  Malik Beasley  Jakob Poeltl  Ivica Zubac  The rest
Atrocious? That draft has a few allstars and multiple starters- high level starters in it. It’s one of the better drafts we’ve seen in the last decade.   Ben Simmons   Brandon Ingram   Jaylen Brown   Jamal Murray   Pascal Siakam   Domontas Sabonis   Malcolm Brogdon   Dejounte Murray   Caris Levert   Jakob Poeltl   Buddy Hield
"Honestly I think you are sleeping on Jakob Poeltl's dynamite defensive season in San Antonio  Capela's been really good too, though, I think he's probably having like a top-6 defensive center season (Gobert, Turner, Poeltl, Embiid, Capela, Ayton)"
"His skill set is the same as before. Roll guy who can get some offensive rebounds. He's just converting at a higher rate. It's probably a rhythm thing, and more importantly, when you saw him, he wasn't with guys who could set him up like our starters can. But he's still a net negative offensively. Not by a lot, but still.   Compare that to Capela who's obviously a lot more important offensively with Trae, and it seems like it should easily be Capela. But they're two different archetypes. The mistake is thinking they've been on a similar level defensively, and that's something you're not going to get if you haven't been watching.     Capela is a good defender, solid enough to play starter level minutes because of his awesome offensive play. Poeltl has been good enough to play starter level minutes despite his offense, and he's been an elite defender. Before he was a regular starter for us, we were 17th in defense, and since then we're 9th. Our team record is worse, but we were outperforming our net rating before, which has since improved with him as a regular starter.     I'd understand someone picking the more proven Capela, due to questions about sample size and all that. I don't think their impact is that far off. That being said, I'm still going with Jakob because a defensive anchor sounds cooler to me lol"
"Just want to shout out Jakob Poeltl and Capela for this, 115 to 109 is a really impressive mark for him Jakob and 117 to 110 is nice for Capela. Really goes to show that despite all the punditry about how important perimeter defense is rim protectors are still clearly the most important part of defense."

Are you Jakob Poeltl by any chance
*banned from Twitch*  I also want to Simp for Jakob Poeltl
jakob poeltl is a excellent defender that i think is underrated because he doesn't get the props he deserves
"Holy shit, this article is so poorly written.  It's actually funny. While I can understand guys like Dray and Bam not making the top five while their teams wallow in mediocrity (I am looking at you though Pacers), the fact that the **next** five on their list hidden at the bottom are Matisse Thybulle, Fred VanVleet, Chris Paul, Jakob Poeltl, and Josh Hart leads me to believe whoever wrote this doesn't know a basketball from a hockey puck."
"No Jakob Poeltl, this is a fraud"
"The thing that Spurs fans need to recognize (along with the org) is that you don't do anything meaningful with role players. You need a lead dog. DeRozan will be 32 at the start of next season...he ain't it. We can't build around a declining player who isn't even a surefire allstar.   So then what? Jakob Poeltl is a one-way five who will be 26 at the start of next sesason. He is who he is.   Patty Mills will be 33 at the start of next season, and is honestly a 3rd/4th guard. He's also not under contract.  DeJounte, while a nice player, is a 1-guard who can't shoot. You're not winning a playoff series if he's the engine of your offense.   Derrick White can't stay healthy and will be 27 at the start of next year. He is who he is, and that's not a lead dog.   So now we're talking ourselves into Devin Vassell and his 5.3 PPG, or Lonnie Walker (one of the worst players in the NBA according to the advanced analytics), or Luka Samanic who has been pretty bad for two years now, or Keldon Johnson, who...maybe? He can't really defend or shoot, though.  I like plenty of those guys, but they're a supporting cast."

Jakob Poeltl
"While we would very much have preferred to pull at least a second roud pick out of someone, hoping teams like Brooklyn, Miami, and Boston would be in enough competition with each other to force one to pony up, it wasn't going to happen. That said, LMA on the current Spurs team was a negative. He wasn't happy and him on the court didn't raise our ceiling enough to help. Unloading him opens the floor up, give more minutes to offensively limited but beastly on defense Jakob Poeltl, and saves us a few bucks.   Its a shit situation but we have benefitted before in season's past."
"&gt;Do GMs really have to purposely underplay their hand and selectively not win trades too much to not alienate their peers ?  Spurs traded Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green for DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl and the Raptors’ 2018 1st round pick"
"Vuc gives up 20 and 9 on 8 of 9 shooting to Jakob Poeltl in a blowout loss.  There is a reason that none of the playoff team, in desperate need of a big man made a serious play for him."

LMA couldn't start over Jakob Poeltl I don't think it'd be a good idea to start him
"I can't lie I'm laughing so fucking hard seeing people talk about LMA, the basketball community's been saying he's on the way down for 3 years and agreed he's washed this year but now he makes the Nets this unfair basketball machine. He can still contribute to playoff teams but he got benched for Jakob Poeltl."
14ppg on 46% and 36% from 3 dude isn’t washed the Spurs just took away all his iso and post touches then gave them to Murray and Co. + the fact that Jakob poeltl is a damn near DPOY level defender skewed his on/off
I didn't get that trade for Adams. Jakob Poeltl and Mason Plumlee signed for like half of what they extended Adams for. They gave up a good backup point guard for the chance to overpay Steven Adams

"Personally, I can't say, but many have said that Gasol wasn't the best defender that year. It would be kind of like Jakob Poeltl winning this season. The advanced stats say that the Spurs are crazy good defensively when Poeltl is playing, but no one would argue that he's been the absolute best.   But did Gasol deserve it? Sure, why not."
*hides Jakob Poeltl*
"That makes sense. Jakob Poeltl has the #1 defensive rating for all centers, would you say that he is generational defensive center?"
That's a weird way of saying Jakob Poeltl
"Offensively, sure   Jakob Poeltl carries our defense at times though and this year it’s kinda been when we can get stops we get wins   Maybe we could just run on everyone and dominate in the half court. Im pretty well sold on the thought that you have to pair derozan with an elite rim protector though.   Just my read as a guy who has watched every minute of spurs basketball possible for the last 10 years or more. If derozan is the salary in the trade package it would surprise me but immediately the fit looks better."
"Not the conversation to be had   Does adding Vucevic make our team as a whole better considering the fit and the fact that Jakob Poeltl has been statistically one of the best defensive big men in basketball. In my opinion one of the more important factors in our first half success.   What does it cost to add Vucevic? Salary, a prospect, and draft capital? No from me, dog."
No. Most people thought the spurs were a surefire playoff team when we traded for DeRozan considering the trade was basically Danny Green for Jakob Poeltl and DeRozan since Kawhi didn't even play the year before.

"Replacing LMA with analytics darling/one of the best rim protectors in the league, Jakob Poeltl in the starting lineup was a huge part of this as well. Helps the offense as well when you can get a stop then let young athletic perimeter dudes like Murray, White, Johnson, and Walker fly in the open floor."
I'm here to simp for Jakob Poeltl (and Luka now)
"Using the Westbrook case alone to discredit BPM/VORP is dumb.  RPM and Raptor definitely have more noise at the top end than BPM, and if you don't believe me just check out how wonky the top 20ish look for the former two vs BPM. One is completely non-controversial while the other two are propping All-NBA cases for Lonzo and Jakob Poeltl lol."
Jakob Poeltl is a bigger snub than Embiid this season tbh
I think Demar Derozan and Jakob Poeltl have both been better than people bought they were at the time which is why I said it looks better now than then. It's just that it also looked like an awful return at the time.
"As a corollary, the return the Spurs got for Kawhi leonard of Demar Derozan, Jakob Poeltl, and Keldon Johnson looks horrible by comparison even if it looks better than it did at the time of the trade."

"It’s been apparent since the bubble that Jakob Poeltl is an upgrade over Lamarcus Aldridge   There’s more factors at play, sure. Patty is a lightning bolt off the bench. Rudy is solid on both ends, DV looks to be the next glue guy all basketball nerds love. Dejounte is really good and has gotten better as the year has progressed.   But it really comes down to Jakob anchoring the defense with capable perimeter defenders around him."
"The spurs have played 3 less games than the pelicans. No idea why people are acting like the spurs haven't played this whole month.   Keldon and Lonnie are both negative defenders right now. Derrick White has played 8 games all year and missed training camp because of injuries. I would say he's the spurs best perimeter defender. Dejounte has been better this year on defense than last year but still gambles too much imo, he's definitely a plus defender though. Patty Mills works hard to stay in front of guys but if his man gets the ball it's bad. Rudy Gay mostly plays 4 now and struggles to keep up with wings. Devin Vassell has been great for a rookie, definitely an above average defender already. The main reason our defense isn't bottom 10 is because of Jakob Poeltl, Devin, and Dejounte.  The pelicans do not have a bad roster at all, especially defensively. Eric Bledsoe was all defense last year and has been a good driving threat most of his career. Sure his defense probably didn't warrant that selection but he's a good defender. Lonzo Ball is a good spot up shooter and defender. Josh Hart is a great defender. Steven Adams is a reliable center. I'd say in terms of wing defense, the pels and spurs have been pretty similar.  Conley could definitely see a spot. He's been very impactful to the jazz and it shows in their lineup stats. His basic stats are basically worse across the board compared to DeMar's though so I think either of them deserve it over Zion."
"If we go by that stat, Jakob Poeltl, Clint Capela, Joe Harris all deserves an all star selection. It's a bit of an overrated stat imo"
I honestly think Jakob Poeltl deserves to be on this list.
The Raptors made a mistake keeping Pascal Siakam instead of Jakob Poeltl in the Kawhi trade.
"also for everyone reading, if you look closely at KAT’s WAR, or wins above replacement, he played the lowest minutes of anyone in the top 75 players, and still had 5.6-5.8 WAR. The next lowest player was Jakob Poeltl of the Spurs at place 77 (on the raptor rating as they give places and lebron rating doesn’t). He literally played almost half of what other people were playing and still was putting up 5.6 WAR. If you double his minutes, his WAR would be around 11.6 which would be tied with Lebron in the 2019-2020 season"
"We drafted Devin Vassell at 11 this year. Rudy Gay was drafted 8th, Jakob Poeltl was drafted 9th and Trey Lyles was drafted 12th"
"He also drafted Kris Dunn over Buddy Hield, Jamal Murray, Jakob Poeltl and Sabonis (though he was taken 11th so he would've been a bit of a reach)"
I haven't been following the spurs too closely. I was checking [this](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/) out and was wondering how Jakob Poeltl had the best defensive rating.
"RAPTOR is the only good stat, and I'm just saying that because Jakob Poeltl is the RAPTOR god."
"Defensively he’s about as well rounded as you can be as a center   Timing and instincts in protecting the rim are elite. If he doesn’t get a hand on a shot within 3 feet, there’s a good chance he has at least greatly changed the shot and intimated the offensive player into a miss   Way more mobile than a dude his size has any business being, I’m not going to say he’s a perimeter stopper or anything, but it’s not an automatic bucket if he gets switched onto the perimeter. Can recover from pick and roll coverage near the perimeter to challenge shots at the rim or even block the shot from behind- rarely quits on a play and hustles his ass off.   Strong, strong rebounder both offensively and defensively. Great positioning and lower body strength means he’s always in the right spot to get his hands on the ball and his wing span and hands allow him to corral rebounds in traffic very effectively. He can also clear out bigs with a box out and allow our lengthy guards and Keldon Johnson to fight for contested rebounds against smaller players.   I fucking love Jakob Poeltl."
"I knew before I opened this thread Jakob Poeltl would come up   Yes, he’s been that good for us. If it wasn’t for Rudy Gobert this dude would be the focus of every defense loving basketball nerd."
"Rim protection he gets like a 2   General mobility and one on one situations he isn’t bad and I’d say he’s even above average compared to others at his position  Overall 5-6 out of 10, average. He’s not Jakob Poeltl but he’s also not Lamarcus Aldridge."
Jakob Poeltl [leads the NBA in opponent FG% at the rim](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-lt6/?CF=GP*GE*10:FGA_LT_06*GE*4&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=LT_06_PCT&amp;dir=-1). Big fan of his game. If only he could make free throws.
Man made a filter to specifically fade out Jakob poeltl lmao
*Jakob Poeltl smiling in the distance*
"We drafted Jakob Poeltl, when Sabonis was available. And I really wanted Sabonis.   One of the few drafts that Masai didn't knock out of the park. And even still, Jakob was a solid player that we were able to use for the Kawhi trade."

Objection: Jakob Poeltl
"the worst thing a ref can be is indecisive and look out of control   that being said. great showing by the  spurs tonight, derrick white finding his form and jakob poeltl once  again asserting himself as one of the most fearsome interior presences in basketball."
"&gt;I'm not a guy who just started watching basketball, I've been watching 20+ years.   I appreciate that, and your username was a hint to that effect.  I still maintain that you are wrong.  &gt;There isn't nearly the amount of ""plugs"" in the nba now. You don't see low skilled 7 footers get any meaningful play time when just 10 years ago it wasnt uncommon and even more so 20 years ago.    There are different types of skill.  Playing defense and rebounding are skills, and the necessity of those two skills 20 years ago led to those players getting minutes -- because there were skilled seven footers on many teams that needed to be stopped.  That said, is Rudy Gobert more ""skilled"" than centers of twenty years ago?  What skills does Mitchell Robinson possess that were not commonplace twenty years ago?  What about DeAndre Jordan?  Alex Len?  Steven Adams?  Hassan Whiteside?  Andre Drummond?  Jarret Allen?  Mason Plumlee?  Enes Kanter?  Ivica Zubac?  Jakob Poeltl?  Robin Lopez?  Willie Cauley-Stein?    None of those players would have been at all remarkable for their skills at any point in NBA history.  The difference is that now you have a few teams like Toronto and Boston who don't play any traditional bigs, and who can get away with that because the skill level of bigs in today's game is generally way down from its historical level -- a few players like Embiid, and Jokic, aside."
Jakob Poeltl is the most disrespected star in the league
"I still don't get what the pels were thinking giving assets for Steven Adams when guys like Jakob Poeltl, Derrick Favors, Christian Wood, and other centers were signing for cheaper than the extension they gave Adams in free agency"
"Spurs as a team haven’t been good enough defensively for other reasons to give him a look but Jakob Poeltl is quietly one of the best defensive bigs in basketball   He’s leading the league in defensive raptor, it’s not even close, and is second in drpm according to ESPN by a pretty thin margin to Rudy.   It’s time he gets some credit. He’s really good."

"I don't think the Raptors 2016 Jakob Poeltl pick should count as coming from tanking within the past 5 years. We traded for that pick from the Knicks for Bargnani who was a 1st overall pick but before the 5 year window that is being measured.  I'm sure some other picks are in the same boat, lottery picks that were traded for shouldn't really be counted as a lottery pick gained from tanking. OKC has a good chance to get a lottery pick next year from the Rockets but I wouldn't say they tanked for their pick."
I like the Jakob Poeltl mini chasedown block where he recovers from pick and roll coverage near the perimeter to block the ball handler at the rim from behind
Better than Jakob Poeltl at least lol
Jakob Poeltl is closer than people realize to Embiid and Gobert as well defensively
 i think old tim duncan might still be better than Jakob Poeltl lol

And Jakob Poeltl is a top 25 player and better than Harden
"Some paragraphs I wrote about as season recap. I hope they are helpful.  * **DEJOUNTE MURRAY**  Here HE is. What an amazing dude DJ is man. From being passed up in the Draft because of his background and tearing his ACL in his third year to be the true leader of the youngins in his 4th season. I'm might be a homer about DJ lmao, but I really think he's that dude, the one that ok may not be your go-to-guy on offense, but definitely the one you always want in your team, pushing everyone to their best. He made major improvement, he can finish at the rim with ease, his mid-range is so beautiful and kinda already almost automatic, his defense got back to the level when know and we gotta consider that he still had to play with DeMar and also, for the vast majority of the season, with Lonnie, both not great perimeter defender, with possibly DW and Keldon it would go even better than he already is. He's mentally at the next level, so I can see him develop more and more, sky's the limit. What I would focus on this offseason is trying to optimize the three pointer with more confidence and maybe some other small stuff like building up more muscles and bring playmaking to another level, handles too. Gotta love DJ tho!  * **DERRICK WHITE**  Sadly Derrick missed ton of games this season, he just could stay healthy. First he injured his foot in the Bubble, he came back at the beginning of 2021, he immediately injured his toe, before coming back he re-injured it, he came back, few games and he got COVID, he came back, played well for few games and again injured himself, this time his ankle. Man, it was tough to see our boy down. It showed that we really need him, he's so essential for our team. He's the most complete player in the team, he really can do it all. Next to DJ he's just perfect, they complement each other so well. I just hope DW, I mean everyone, stays healthy so we can watch him play all season long with DJ!  * **KELDON JOHNSON**  **BIG BODY.**  Man, I love this dude lmao. He has played so well this season and didn't even play triple digits games in the NBA, he gained all Pop's trust so quickly, it's crazy to me, it's hella difficult to do so! Our roster honestly wasn't prepared for such a breakout player like Keldon so we had to adapt and we played him at the 4, defintely not his ideal position. He had to guard the opponent's best player kinda each night, he's that versatile on defense, from Zion to JJJ to Doncic, and somehow he manages to do nice enough. The point is that yeah he coudl slide sometimes, but he's a 3 and like this he would play much better in every single way. His main strenght on offense is driving to the basket so having a smaller and thinner player on him would help him a lot than having AD or Zion, defintely. On defense too, I still remember that ""viral"" clip of him locking Doncic up in the last game before COVID in 2020, against smaller opponents he manages to stay with his man both in the arc and inside. Another aspect to not forget it's rebounding, at SF he would actually be able to help even more and box out smaller players. In terms of working out I would defintely work on the shooting, especially the three pointer, he made 1 a game, I would like to see him hitting at least 2 a game next season. He already showed improvement with the season going on, especially from the mid-range with him acutally creating his own shot, it was beautiful to watch. The way he developed since entering the NBA is crazy to many, I really do not know what to expect from this dude, he's has been amazing!  * **JAKOB POELTL**  Jak started teh season really poorly. With LMA still being around, he just could find the right fit, but once LMA went away, he finally stepped up BIG. After that awful FT slump, he somehow fixed it and went crazy, really couldn't miss anymore lmao, but he still needs to be consistent and especially confident with his shooting mechanics from the FT. His defense is statistically one of the best among big men in the entire league, dude is realyl good at it. On offense he does the small things well. Now tho he knows his role and what he needs to do, he just needs to master these things, not add much more. For example, his main problem is aggressiviness, man he needs to freaking dunk that ball, acutally get up and put it back in with ferocity, here he should imitate Drew effort! On defense kinda the same, sometimes he randomly get lazy and the opponent scores on him with ease. Also, on offense I would work more and those small hook/floaters from near the rim, mastering them would be amazing! I think that now that he knows his role Jak can have a solid offseason of work!  * **LONNIE WALKER IV**  My boy Lonnie, prolly one of the most controversial, according to this sub, player in this roster. Let's start with this season. All the times Derrick was out he started. He did not played amazing, but let's analyze. He was the last guy considered on offense, but let's be honest, it's all his fault. He's too passive, he needs to be more aggressive an take resposabilites and ask for the ball more, definitely. On defense? He was below average, but he wasn't that bad as advanced stats tell. I mean, he defintely lacks some fundamentals especially as team defense, but at least you can see he tries and on 1v1 he's acutally nice and sometimes he even makes nice defensive plays, but defense it's definitely his main weakness (along with passiviness I would say). Anyway, I personally love Lonnie both as a player and a person. He seems to be such a genuine guy, emotional one, care about everything, players and himself, hard-worker, we wanna prove he has value and that he can hide his weaknesses by working out on them. He (at least for me) has shown he truly has ton of potential but still needs A LOT work, that's a fact. He did an amazing offseason of work last summer, He's polished his finishing and his jumpshot became pure, while also building up muscles. I expect him to work on other things this summer, maybe keep working with Jrue Holiday might help him in terms of defense and positioning, Jrue excels at these things, Lonnie doesn't. TO defend Lonnie from criticism I would also add that he's 22yrs player in his 3rd season in the league, he spent his first season in the G-League, the second one half on the bench because of Marco-Bryn, half for just 10mins, i his 3rd one he finally got solid minutes and averaged 11ppg in 25mins. Does Lonnie need to work like hell this summer in things that are related with defense? ABSOLUTELY, he needs to do so. He also has to work on much more other stuff, like know where to be, be less passive, work on hands and dribbling, do not take bad shots just because he feels hot.. he definetely need to workout. Now, he has a really solid work ethic, just look at his shot and finishing, he improved a lot, really. Also, his muscles, him being spending a whole summer with Jrue Holiday, a proven baller and a defensive master who could teach him stuff this summer. He will improve. But do not get me wrong, he really showed flashes of the POTENTIAL of being an amazing player. Will he become James Harden? Oh, hell no. Has Lonnie the potential to become an All-Star or at least a fring one? Definitely. Does this mean he will absolutely will? NO. What if instead we get a Jordan Clarkson type of guy? Y'all would really give up on him?  I mean, do whatever you want, y'all are rightly free to think whatever you want, but I'm just saying, I saw these type of criticism, maybe even worse one, against a Spur last season, his name is Dejounte, you know the end of the story.  * **DEVIN VASSELL**  Our rookie! Under various circumstances, Devin was able to get minutes from Pop by Day One. Also, what he brings to the table is so imporant and key in today's NBA that he could sit tbh. He's a 3&amp;D guy and he already showed really interesting flashes like that driven and small step back from like the free throw line, I love that, it shows he can develop his own shot creation too! Yeah, he still needs ton of work but for a rookie it was fine. He needs to work on not missing open looks and be more focused in order to drain them easy looks and most important thing he needs to spend most of his time this offseason in the gym. Boy is too skinny to play the 3, position I think suits him better since he's tall enough and at 2 it's not that flashy to play it, so he needs to put up muscles to play it, I think this is why he still played most of his minutes at the 2 this season. Most of our youngins that came in the Spurs environment grew in terms of muscles so I think it won't be that difficult for Devin to do so if he follows our development staff. Let's see how he behaves next season  * **DREW EUBANKS**  Drew started to play solid minutes once LMA was gone and when he was hurt. He was not amazing, yeah, but I gotta be honest that he always brings that energy that is needed. He plays good and does the things he need to to at an average level, really good for a minimun guy. I love Drew and he's such a cool dude to have around the guys here!"

"You call an entire third of a season a hot streak huh?  Poole averaged under 10 for the first third and almost 18 for the final third and around his average for the middle of the season.  You’re not seeing a pattern of improvement?  Also, Jakob Poeltl and Gorgui Dieng are excellent defenders, emphasis on Poeltl.  It’s the only reason they still get contracts.  If you don’t like advanced stats then literally just go watch Wiggins play a game.  Or look at more basic things like opponent fg% where he held the SF to its lowest fg% of any defender in the NBA.  Seriously, just watch him defend in literally any game.  Then you’ll stop spouting nonsense.  He literally earned the nickname two way Wigs for his defense this year and you’re clueless."
See that's how I know you know nothing. Shooting percentages fluctuate during the season it's called being on a hot streak. Advanced stats mean nothing for defense. Unless you want to call Jakob Poeltl and Gorgui Deng top defenders in the league. Also I don't know how the fuck you think Myles Turner is making 2.38. [That was his salary during his rookie year. He made 18 million last year and is going to make the same this year.](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/indiana-pacers/myles-turner-17839/cash-earnings/)
The two best players are clearly Derrick White and Dejounte Murray. No clue why he used Jakob Poeltl.

Jakob poeltl
"Hasan Whitesides height has some controversy as he listed as 6'10.5"" inches at the combine (which you rounded down to make Sengun look worse) but in on nba.com he is listed as 7'0"" which supposebly measures barefoot now and on the court he looks like a 7 footer with the eye test.   Sengun has numbers floating around online that he has a 7'0.5"" inch wingspan. This is solid, Jakob Poeltl and Joakim Noah both have a wingspan of 7'1"" and have been great NBA defenders.  &gt;I don't see a high ceiling vs the other larger centers.  The same game was played with Luka. After he had a great summerleague ""I don't see him being quick enough for the athletes that are in the NBA"". It took a couple years too long for people to Admit how good Jokic really is."
"Since it's really really difficult to judge defense I often rely on advanced stats. Obviously for me watching game is still the best way to judge something, but stats nowadays are extremely good.

"The bonus of SA is that you can usually go unnoticed, people usually leave you alone. I saw Jakob Poeltl trundling his tall ass around the farmers market here and no one bothered him, despite sticking out over a sea of 5'6"" Latinos."
"Dejounte Murray, Devin Vassell, Doug McDermott, Keldon Johnson, Jakob Poeltl.   Derrick White, Josh Primo, Lonnie Walker, Thad Young, Zach Collins.  Tre Jones, Da'Quan Jeffries, Keita Bates-Diop, Luka Samanic, Jock Landale"
"It's crazy all that's left from the Kawhi trade is Jakob Poeltl and that kid who broke up the KD and Bam playground fight.  Edit: Wow you guys are really protective of Johnson and for the record I have been following you guys since the Kawhi trade seeing Demar with those spinning layups, appreciating Jak getting his chance this past season and so I definitely know who Kevin Johnson is.  Sheesh."
"i mean, we only had luka samanic and jakob poeltl at 4/5 and we again drafted guards so yeah, we needed them like bread."
"Masai just on the Raptors  (discounting the Melo trade in Denver that was amazing and the Kawhi trade because we all know):  - Traded Bargnani's awful contract for a lottery pick    used to select Jakob Poeltl.   - Traded Greivis Vasquez to the Bucks for 2 picks that turned into OG Anunoby and Norman Powell.   - Signed Fred VanVleet to an undrafted deal.   - Traded Valanciunas, Wright and picks for an old Marc Gasol so we could win. Morey refused to do this for Lowry and that's why Sixers couldn't go further.    - Traded Terrence Ross and a second for Serge Ibaka.     - Drafted Pascal Siakam #27 when few had heard of him.    - Fired Casey and hired a largely unknown Nick Nurse.     Masai is a tier above Morey. He has had elite moves i  trades, drafts and coaching hires. They shouldn't be discussed in the same breath."
I'm not sure Allen is better then Jakob Poeltl and the latter is on a 3 year 27 million deal in comparison.
Kawhi for DeMar + Jakob Poeltl /s
This is Jakob Poeltl ignoring :(
"Right but if you *do* trust your development, the upside here is Kawhi Leonard. A franchise-defining player.  I'm not saying the Raptors have flawless drafting and development. They drafted Bruno Caboclo, Delon Wright and Jakob Poeltl with three straight first round picks. They get a lot of credit on the Anunoby pick but Anunoby was projected to go way higher before his injury so it wasn't really some galaxy brain draft decision to pick him up where he slid to.  I know Wright and Poeltl weren't total busts and, along with Caboclo, were picked late enough in the draft that it's easy to miss on your picks, but the Raptors do get maybe more than their share of the benefit of the doubt due to the success and development of players like Powell, Siakam and Van Vleet.  I'm always going to be nervous about them passing on Suggs until we know how good both Barnes and Suggs turn out to be. I'm just hoping they made the right decision here."
"This is a list of literally all our bigs: Luka Samanic, Jakob Poeltl, Drew Eubanks  Favors is a good backup 5 and while I like Eubanks, he'll never be more than a third stringer. We're clearly in rebuild mode after drafting an 18 year old with the 12th pick so we should be trying to get as many picks as we can"
"Ouch, Jakob Poeltl doesn't even get to be called a C."
Rudy Gay &gt; Jakob Poeltl
Jakob Poeltl to Dallas?
"Also in the Carmelo Anthony trade to the Knicks 3 draft picks involved in the trade are recognizable players today. The picks used to select Dario Saric, Jamal Murray, and Jakob Poeltl we’re all traded in that one transaction."
"Well seemingly we didn't because Kswhi went out of his way to tank his trade value. Knowing that and with the power of hindsight getting DeMar, Keldon Johnson and Jakob Poeltl in that trade wasn't that bad"

Jakob Poeltl. Dude is basically Rudy Gobert lite in terms of rim protection and defensive impact
"Per basketball-reference, only ONE player in the NBA last season averaged 10.0 ppg, and that was Bryn Forbes. The rest averaged 10.1 ppg or more, or 9.9 ppg or less.     Anyways, with that said, here is my starting lineup of players who played a minimum of 35 games last season and averaged 10.0 ppg or lower...     PG: Cameron Payne   SG: Bryn Forbes   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Draymond Green   C: Nicolas Batum     Payne is a 44% 3pt shooter and Forbes is a 45% 3pt shooter. Shooting percentages may be slightly lower with more defensive pressure on them, but I doubt it would be anything more than a 5-7% dip (I would expect both to shoot in the high 30's). Backcourt would be slightly undersized, but if they are knocking down threes at a high clip, I can live with it.     Green would likely be the primarily ball handler, but Payne would take pressure off of Green to be the sole shot creator. Covington, Green, and Batum could all take turns playing center. They're versatile enough to play a bunch of different styles defensively. Rebounding will be weak unless Green averages 10+ rpg out of necessity.     Honorable mentions:     PG: Anfernee Simons / Ricky Rubio / Tomáš Satoranský / Cory Joseph   SG: Talen Horton-Tucker / Kentavious Caldwell-Pope / Luke Kennard / Landry Shamet   SF: Danny Green / Kent Bazemore   PF: Dorian Finney-Smith / Royce O'Neale   C: Jakob Poeltl / Steven Adams / Nerlens Noel / Robert Williams"
Jakob Poeltl is also listed as a borderline all star. Is that a typo?
Jakob Poeltl if you meant averaging less than 7 ppg for their career
"EPM produces some results that do not pass the eye test. I personally would not say that Fred VanVleet is the best shooting guard in the league, or that Jakob Poeltl has a more positive impact on his team that Anthony Davis or Donovan Mitchell."
"Judging based on previous performance pretty clearly Derrick White and Jakob Poeltl. Dejounte did close the gap this last season however.   Dejounte graded out much better in ESPN’s RPM and bballlindex’s LEBRON than he had in previous seasons which aligns with how much better he played last year and improved as a facilitator and mid range scorer. He was on almost dead equal footing with Derrick in both of those measures last season, but Derrick struggled to stay healthy and Dejounte wasn’t rated as highly by 538’s RAPTOR. RAPTOR favors Derrick and Jakob pretty clearly. For clarity’s sake I prefer LEBRON to RAPTOR, and prefer watching basketball to any statistic no matter how they’re derived. I wouldn’t trust a measure that deviates far from what I see from watching games, but in this case these 3 measures all align closely with my opinion of them. A 2 season sample size would be preferred for all 3 players. After all Derrick was hurt a lot this year making his sample size even smaller, but including 2019-20 will also obviously hurt Murray’s statistical argument as he was demonstrably worse that season than 20-21 where he can seriously rest his laurels on maybe being their best player.  These quantifiable measures are much quicker to digest and easier to stand on than anything else given most people probably don’t see 95% of Spurs minutes. An amount which is probably necessitated given all the oversights we make without re-watching film of previous games where you catch a lot of things you miss watching live. In any case, Dejounte is the only player (based on previous performance) who could be argued in as impactful as Derrick and Jakob.  Going forward? Given many players young age/inexperience in the NBA, or someone like Dejounte’s continued improvement every season, it’s anyone’s guess who’ll be the best this year. I would take the safest bet with Derrick for now.  It really wouldn’t surprise me if any 1 of 6 guys was their best player after this season but only using past performance you’d probably pick Derrick and give Jakob and Dejounte serious consideration. Their past performance obviously doesn’t restrain them from becoming the Spurs best player this season but I wouldn’t go so far to make big predicted growth until we see some signs of it."

"Not sure about other teams, but 2016 was pretty big for the Raptors.  - 9th overall: Jakob Poeltl (traded for Kawhi Leonard)  - 27th overall: Pascal Siakam  - Undrafted: Fred VanVleet"
"not really, unless you think not including jakob poeltl was a legitimate dealbreaker lmao"
Demar Derozan earned a 2nd team all-nba in 2017-18 with a line of 23/3.9/5.2 on exactly league average TS.  Your first instinct might be ok those are not great numbers for a 2nd team considering his awful defense. And you would be right.   You might then think but wait they won 59 games so even though Zach Lavine has put up almost identical numbers (2019-20) and NOT EVEN MADE ALL-STAR much less All-NBA that hw must have been indispensable on the court.   Wrong again. Demar had a negative on/off even this season and the NBA roster featured a whopping 10 PLAYERS who are significant rotation players even now 4 years later.  Here is the list:  OG Anunoby Demar Derozan Serge Ibaka Kyle Lowry Jakob Poeltl Norman Powell Pascal Siakam Jonas Valanciunas  Fred Vanvleet Delon Wright  Of course this team was one of the best in the NBA with a 10 man rotation like that!
"I cannot find the original source of what I said about McDermott, sadly, but there was one, really. It's not casual that I remember the Number 9.  If you are talking about the last true young core the Lakers had, I guess tit turned out well: Ingram signed a Max Contract and was an All-Star and Lonzo Ball jsut signed a solid contract with the Bulls and is ready for a solid season with a nice team. Josh Hart is a solid rotational player, same for Kuzma.  I get that everyone overhype their talent, but I'm not talking crazy tbh.  For example Dejounte Murray and Jakob Poeltl are top defender in their position as Ball Index says. HERE is a comment where I talk about this. DJ is a Top 4 Defensive Guard and Jakob a Top 3 Defensive Center. About Keldon, he went to the Olympics and brought the energy and played really good during the exhibition games where he played. He also had a 20-20 game this season. Derrick White sadly missed this season, but if you saw the Bubble, he was exceptioanlly good and played even better than DeMar. Also that 36pts game in the Playoffs against Denver two year ago was fire.  **ABOUT DEJOUNTE MURRAY**  Let's bring to the table the mid-range shot then.  Dejounte Murray shot better from the midrange than KAWHI LEONARD while attempting more shots. I highly doubt Kawhi is criticized for his mid-range abilities, instead he's called as someone who never misses from there, considered as one of the best ones in the league. And rightly lemme say because Kawhi is an extremely good mid-range shooter, but have you ever seen someone saying that DJ is at his level.  Actually, only considering the ones that shot more than 210 mid-range shots, DJ is ranked 8th. Better than him, in order, we find: CP3 (382), Jokic (235), Embiid (285), Booker (346), Ingram (354), Beal (333), DeRozan (331). DJ shot an amazing 45.4% with 302 attempts!  Behind him you can find the rightly considered Mid-Range Master Khris Middleton (just 20 more attempts and 0.3% worse). Also Kawhi, Dame, Curry...  (Worth mentioning Nikola Vucevic: less than 1% worse than DJ but with like 70 more shots. Also Irving and KD are excluded because they didn't shoot much because they didn't play much)  And we gotta say that DJ came to the league as a complete terrible shooter, really, he couldn't shoot at all. So he slowly developed one and he is progressing with the range.  Also let's add the fact that he was injuried for a full season and also played his rookie year mainly in the G-League.  Ja Morant played a total of 4127 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 3rd Season. Dejounte Murray played a total of 5891 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 5th Season. Their age difference is just 2 years too.  So I'm not saying DJ is the shooting maestro, but he's crazy underrated in everything and especially his shooting abilities!"
"I agree, as like a lottery pick at best it would have looked decent enough of a selection, he had an ok career ended very quickly and didn't look like he would fall off a cliff that quickly.  As a first overall pick absolutely terrible, especially when LMA was the 2nd pick.  Now the trade to get rid of him to the Knicks on the other hand still looks like a heist, specially with Jakob Poeltl then being traded for Kawhi."
"No. Kawhi had killed his value at that point. Danny was not worth a pick, he was an aging replaceable 3 and D guy on a one year deal.   And the return was solid. Demar who had his best individual seasons as a spur. The pick that became keldon Johnson. Jakob Poeltl, one of the best defensive bigs in the league. And then Demar was traded for a 1st, some 2nds, and Thaddeus Young who could net a young player or a 1st rounder"
"Jakob Poeltl = Bordeline All-Star  Jak=KD   I would even add a 1st for the swap, I'm generous!"
you literally described jakob poeltl. dude came from a family of volleyball players
Ben Simmons and Lonzo Ball are ahead of Booker. So this is crap   edit: Also Jakob Poeltl is ahead of Bam. So yeah. . . .
Man I knew Jakob Poeltl was adored by advanced stats guys but him being 36th on this list is still really surprising
Pascal Siakam and Jakob Poeltl
Jakob Poeltl
"Myles just put up 3.4 blocks/game and didn't make All-Defense. People are getting wiser to defensive impact beyond splash stats like steals and blocks.   With guys like Gobert, Embiid, Adebayo, Capela, Turner, and Davis all in the midst of their primes, it's a very competitive list. Not to mention under the radar guys like Jakob Poeltl, and promising upcoming guys like Ayton and Mobley.  I'm not saying it's impossible, just that it would be pretty surprising to see him break in."
"Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green for Demar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl, a first, and cash considerations has to be one of them."

"Winning a championship in Milwaukee is a lot easier when your first season as GM you have Giannis scoring 27PPG and Middleton at 20PGG. Masai came into a team where our franchise record win total was 47, and then every single season up until the Fuck Tampa Bay Season we beat that. The franchise ""centrepiece"" was Rudy ""Not This Guy"" Gay.  Is it an accomplishment? Yeah, it is. Winning any championship is a major accomplishment. But when you just walk into a team that already has your franchise centerpiece and his second guy on the team, that is the two most difficult things to build a championship team already done for you, all you gotta do is just build around them. Which he did, which is more than many other execs can say. Masai had to trade Melo during his first season as the Nuggets GM, then two seasons later had a team that won 57 games which is more than any Nuggets Melo season, then came to Toronto where our franchise centerpiece was Rudy ""Not This Guy"" Gay and our team never won more than 47 games. We then beat that 47 game mark for the next six seasons, flipped Rudy Gay for bench pieces that helped spark the team into making the playoffs, exceeded all expectations in the mid to late first round + second round drafting players such as Siakam+OG+Northman Powell, kawal the Knicks into giving up a first round pick for Primo Pasta Bargnani which became the 9th pick Jakob Poeltl who was then traded for Kawhi, build up our scouting + player development staff into arguably the best in the league which has given us players like undrafted free agent Fred VanVleet + developing players like Siakam, OG, Northman Powell, etc. I think that in its totality is more impressive than what Horst has done so far.  And Masai isn't the GM he is our team president. He was promoted to Team President in 2016, then Jeff Weltman was GM for one season then left to become the Orlando Magic GM then Bobby Webster was promoted from Assistant GM to GM which he holds to now. Toronto Raptors General Manager Bobby Webster won a championship at the tender age of 34 years old."
"And 3.5 times more than Jakob Poeltl (total contract - double per year)  And not only did you overpay Allen, but you then drafted Mobley (absolutely right move), and then also overpaid Lauri and gave up Nance to do it.  I really dont understand the thinking on either the Allen contract or the Lauri move."
"While still true, Poeltl is probably the most underrated defensive big in the NBA, so he actually makes a huge impact on a team. He's definitely a top 6 center on defense imo.   https://www.poundingtherock.com/2021/3/26/22349444/jakob-poeltl-san-antonio-overall-impact  https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/lt90o8/jakob_poeltl_is_the_best_rim_protector_in_the_nba"
You can have one Jakob poeltl. It’s a fair trade since yalls owner sux.
"I'm with you  This guy was basically just the Suns' Clint Capela for a playoff run and people are talking like he just had a 2018-Jokic-type playoffs.  So why would the Thunder max Ayton when they can just wait a year and make a run at Capela or Myles Turner in UFA? Granted those guys are older but the thing is if you need to trade for this type of guy you can (see: Atlanta trading for Capela when they were ready to push their chips in), so you can always cycle another guy in with your million late firsts as whoever you bring in ages out.  To me it makes to keep drafting, see if you find the second guy you want to max, and, if that guy is not a center, then you start trying to bring via FA or trade a guy on that Jakob Poeltl (low-end) / Capela (mid-tier) / Ayton (high-tier) quality spectrum."
"what pride has to do with it. going out there and try to do the best and win is simply the coach's job, whether you team is bad or a contender. we won't be very good this season, as you said, but pop literally doing his job and not tank, so intentionally lose, has nothing to do with pride.   also add the other comment over pop and our fo laughing at us for taking that offer because it was a ""win-now"" move when the offers on the table weren't much better and we do not even know what was behind. kawhi tanked his value like crazy and nobody offered much. we got a solid package considering the situation. you would come out with that brandon ingram and first package aren't you. yeah, it might have been better, maybe not. we got ourself jakob poeltl that is a top 3/5 defensive big man, we got gold medalist keldon johnson (pick given by the raptors, maybe the lakers one would have been the 30th instead of the 29th and maybe we couldn't have picked keldon) and he showed ton of potential, and we turned derozan into thaddeus young and 1 1st and 1 2nd and thad can maybe be traded for another 1st. might not be the best ,but it's definitely fine and not intended as ""win-now"" mode."

Jakob Poeltl
"I mentioned it in another comment but I watched how Demar thoroughly tanked the spurs defense despite being backed up by Dejounte Murray and Jakob poeltl, two of the best defenders in the league. I think he’s going to cause huge problems without a rim protector cleaning up for him. But maybe I’m not giving the bench enough credit for what they’ll be able to do"
"Jakob Poeltl is an awesome interior defender, they'll be fine in there."
"That pick turned into Jakob Poeltl, who then became part of the trade for Danny Green and Kawhi Leonard."
I was upset the Raps took Jakob Poeltl over him. I have never questioned or got emotional over draft picks since as I have no clue and that just proved it. I was also mad that Marquese Chriss went off the board just before as well.

Jakob Poeltl?
"deandre jordan, jakob poeltl who the other one who hasnt taken a 3 pointer this year?"
That's Borderline All-Star Jakob Poeltl according to 538
"Not sure you can trust defensive RAPTOR when it’s got Chris Paul at 200, Jakob Poeltl at 222, and OG Anunoby at 227. Last year with a much bigger data set JV ranked 7th of 86 centers in DRPM, and although DRPM is flawed too, he was a 0.0 in on/off def ratg. He’s not a bad defender any more. Not good, but not bad."

"I would guess yes, but I could see the Spurs or Kings stealing that final spot from the Wolves. The Wolves have the most talent out of those three teams, but the Kings could potentially improve with Alvin Gentry at the helm, (Luke Walton might just be a bad coach). And I wouldn't say the Spurs are tanking necessarily...they're just not great. And they've been struggling recently as Jakob Poeltl has been out, but prior to his injury they had a surprisingly good net rating."
"DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl and a first used to be the going rate for superstars  Damn inflation ^^/s"
Jakob Poeltl for Steph Curry: Who says no?
I expect us to bounce back a ton next season. This roster was clearly built with tanking in mind with us taking a bad contract back for a pick and signing Zach Collins who will miss half the season. We're super reliant on Jakob Poeltl because he's literally the only rim protector on the whole roster other than Collins.
Jakob Poeltl
"Defense might be 50% of the game but that doesn't mean the two are of equal value. Great offense always beats great defense, and offensive is a much more difficult skill in the NBA than defense--which is largely effort and scheme.   Not saying Draymond isn't uniquely special at defense, because he is, but he is not that much better of a defender than AD and AD makes Draymond look like a high school kid on offense comparatively.   That's why guys like Tony Allen and Bruce Bowen didn't get supermaxed despite being incredible defenders. Or put on All-NBA teams. It's why Draymond wouldn't sniff an All-NBA 1st team, won't be an All-Star again, and got the All-NBA teams he did because his skills were showcased on the Warriors. It's why Jakob Poeltl and Mitch Robinson aren't gonna get 20m contracts any time soon.   I'm no fan of AD but be real. Would you rather have the 5th best offensive &amp; 5th best defensive player in the league, or the 150th best offensive player in the league and 1st or 2nd best defensive player in the league?  As far as the championships go, Draymond could have 10 championships and he wouldn't be better than AD. AD could have 10 championships and it wouldn't make him better than he is compared to Draymond now. That's a team award, a team accomplishment, not an individual one.   Plus as far as ""can't win games without his #1"" I'd like to put out without his #1 Draymond was 14-46 in 19-20. There is a 0% chance that Draymond is going to be better without Steph than AD is without LeBron or anyone else, come on now."
Jakob Poeltl doesn't deserve that.
"Don't know what game you watched. They doubled Davis plenty and it cost them at the perimeter.  Their #1 problem was no Jakob Poeltl, who advanced stats paint as the 2nd best defensive big man in the league. Guarding AD with Drew Eubanks is not bueno.  &gt;noticed how they changed super late and saw results?  The only thing that changed is Davis started to cough it up instead of making the right pass. Spurs were maybe a little more aggressive going down the stretch but that was out of necessity."
What having 4 6’5 players and no Jakob Poeltl does to a mf
"After a quick Google, he is, in fact, second to Jakob Poeltl."
Jakob Poeltl got Covid a little over a week ago and Pop said to not expect him back this week. So Vucevic might miss like 8 games or so because of this.
He's good but he's not Jakob Poeltl
What about Jakob Poeltl who's averaging 5.1 OREBs a game? (He has missed 3 games though)
Jakob Poeltl from health and safety protocols.  Best big man in Spurs history.
"I love Jokic but I was annoyed as hell as a Spurs fan back when we had our playoff series against the Nuggets in 2019 and Nuggets fans kept posting about how our center, Jakob Poeltl, was playing dirty against Jokic... as if Jokic isn't constantly playing dirty/physical to make up for his lack of speed and poor defense. And it's even funnier when Jak has been criticized for most of his Spurs tenure for being soft but now he's apparently out for blood (he gets a really shit whistle now). Like I said, love the guy and I get that I shouldn't be letting the posts of irrational fans get to me, especially during the playoffs, but still lol."
Jakob Poeltl dropped from 50% to 38% ft shooting
&gt;#####A new season means new players stepping to the forefront. Here are a handful who look like they could make a leap two weeks into 2021-22.  --- Included players:  &gt;* Miles Bridges {CHA} * Ja Morant {MEM} * Tyler Herro {MIA} * OG Anunoby {TOR} * Cole Anthony {ORL} * Harrison Barnes {SAC} * Desmond Bane {MEM} * Jakob Poeltl {SAS} * Cam Reddish {ATL} * Mo Bamba {ORL}
Wiseman and a 1st for Jakob Poeltl
"This is complete rubbish. Leonard asked for a trade from the Spurs, he was telling people he had a leg injury that made him miss a season. That injury was described by the Spurs as degenerative tendonitis. The Spurs still got a huge haul in DeRozen, Jakob Poeltl, and the pick that became Keldon Johnson. And supposedly the Spurs lost that trade.  Simmons has more value than Leonard had."
**2021:** Scottie Barnes (4) and Dalano Banton (46).   **2020:** Malachi Flynn (29).   **2017:** OG Anunoby (23).   **2016:** Pascal Siakam (27) and Jakob Poeltl (9).   **2015:** Delon Wright (20).   He's barely missed. The two who have left have shown to be really tidy players too.
"Is there any universe where this goes through?   Warriors get:  * Dejounte Murray   * Jakob Poeltl   Spurs get:  * Jordan Poole  * James Wiseman  * Jon Kuminga   * Moses Moody  The Warriors get two fantastic players for their youth. Spurs get an injection of young talent. I know the Spurs want to try to compete while Pop is around, but is this a good trade on paper in your opinion?"
"Lol that's not true at all. Tons of guys would've gotten the spurs more wins than DeRozan did. And our roster was not that bad. We basically swapped Kyle Anderson, Manu Ginobili, and Danny Green for DeMar DeRozan and Jakob Poeltl and weren't any better. Then we were significantly worse the next two seasons. There's a lot of revisionist history going on in this thread about DeRozan."
Jakob Poeltl was a tank last season and is averaging 14 and 10 this year
"I thought Spurs were doomed with such limited minutes from Jakob Poeltl, who is one of our two most important guys. (Key facilitator of offense, criminally underrated on defense.)  Luckily we got some great minutes from Thaddeus Young, finally. He and NBA Champion  Bryn Forbes kept us in it heading into the third, putting DJ and the starters in good position to close it out late."

Is Jakob Poeltl better than David Robinson &amp; Tim Duncan combined?
