"Nurkic had a game with 28 points, 20 rebounds, 8 assists, and 6 blocks a few years ago, which hadn’t been seen in 30+ years.   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/blazers-jusuf-nurkic-does-something-we-havent-seen-since-charles-barkley/"
"Who would win:   CJ McCollum, Jusuf Nurkic, Derrick Jones Jr, Zach Collins, Nassir Little  vs.   Dame, GTJ, Hood(?), Covington, Kanter  With how CJ was playing, I honestly think that top team would win. Lol."
"Blazers hospital team:   CJ McCollum, Jusuf Nurkic, Derrick Jones Jr, Zach Collins, Nassir Little  Luckily Roco is back from his concussion!"
Based on more than half the teams having a center who is clearly better defensively...  1) Nikola Jokić - Denver Nuggets  2) Joel Embiid - Philadelphia 76ers  3) Rudy Gobert - Utah Jazz  4) Jusuf Nurkic - Portland Trail Blazers  5) Nikola Vučević - Orlando Magic  6) DeAndre Ayton - Phoenix Suns  7) Jonas Valančiūnas - Memphis Grizzlies  8) Steven Adams - New Orleans Pelicans  9) Myles Turner - Indiana Pacers  10) Clint Capela - Atlanta Hawks  11) Jarrett Allen - Cleveland Cavaliers  12) Mitchell Robinson - New York Knicks  13) Karl Anthony Towns - Minnesota Timberwolves  14) Al Horford - Oklahoma City Thunder  15) Tristan Thompson - Boston Celtics
CJ will be re evaluated in about 2.5 weeks. Nurk will be reevaluated in about 4.5 weeks. The 4 and 6 week thing is about 10 days old.   [Source](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/cj-mccollum-jusuf-nurkic-injury-timeline-return-updates-trail-blazers/1dd8fd229s0u314tmiht6i8526)
"I think there's a better chance we do than we don't.    I swear his beard makes people age him more than what is the reality.  Guy is only 26, and won't turn 27 until just before *next* season.  In reality we haven't yet seen prime Nurk, as least based on when bigs traditionally hit their prime.  And Gordon Hayward this year is what gives me hope for a still full prime from Nurkic.  And his injury history isn't crazy or repetitive, with the wrist this year being another freak injury to a completely different part of his body.    Looking at his history, there's nothing repetitive or degenerative: https://www.foxsports.com/nba/jusuf-nurkic-player-injuries  Maybe thinking he'd be back full strength beginning of this season this was foolish, given how gruesome the leg break was in 2019, but like I said, Hayward gives me hope that by the end of this/beginning of next, he's playing up to 100% of his potential.  Bones and muscles *can* heal fully.  Or maybe Portland really is cursed, and next year his spleen explodes or something."
I was a die hard bulls fan from when I started following basketball at five years old in 1998 to 2014 when they made the trade of Jusuf Nurkic and Gary Harris for Doug McDermott. It epitomized our stupid front office philosophy and I couldn't handle it any more. I stopped rooting until last year when they fired Forman and demoted Paxson.
"Why stop there? Trade KP for Jusuf Nurkic, get Bojan Bogdanovic from Utah and then Bogdan Bogdanovic as well from Atlanta.  Then we rename Dallas Mavericks to The Yugo Slavs and we all jointly convert to communism comrade."
"IMO you can still be content but be disappointed that they didn't pan out and live up to expectations of a #1 pick.   It also depends on your team. If you're a shitty team in the gutter, you wouldn't be content with a top quality role player, but a contender might be since it gives them another quality piece to the team.   --------------  Like take the Warriors. If Wiseman never turns into a superstar, I'm sure they'll be disappointed. But if he turns into say like a Jusuf Nurkic-level player or someone that isn't in the top tier, but can play at times at the tier below, then I think they'd be content with it while they still have Steph and Klay cause he can still contribute to the team."
"That’s cool and all but idrc when it’s not even a quality post. Rank these players for me jusuf nurkic, Emoni baites, snoop dogg, Kevin hart, lebron James, and isiah Thomas?? You see how dumb these posts look"
The only 20/20 5x5 in NBA history? Jusuf Nurkic courtesy of the Kings... thanks Willie Cauley Stein!
"Rodney Hood, Jusuf Nurkic, Derrick Jones Jr, Zach Collins, all the draft picks for Harden.  Dame/CJ/Harden + RoCo and Kanter/Giles starting and backing up the 5."
"Jusuf Nurkic had his leg fucking snap in half, and was hopped up on painkillers and god knows what other meds and the leg in a cast, but when he saw his team down in a playoff game, still made his GF drive him to the arena so he can support the team from the bench.   It wasn't even a elimination game. It was the game 5 against OKC when the Blazers were up 3-1 in the series."
Kemba Walker  Jrue Holiday  Bojan Bogdanovic  Christian Wood  Jusuf Nurkic

"if that was called for every player, jusuf nurkic and damian lillard would get somebody ejected every single game"
thanks! fixed it! It's Jusuf Nurkic.
"The specificity of the stats is kind of silly, but I'm always impressed by a 5-5-5-5 statline. For me it has always been a great representation of a well-rounded game.  For anyone curious about the players who have done this in NBA history:  Hakeem Olajuwon (x6)  Andrei Kirilenko (x3)  Dr. J (x2)  George T.

Jusuf Nurkic is up there too! he makes 12 mil a year.
"I wanted to argue because Ayton or Holiday as the best 3rd option seems crazy but then I looked and it's probably true. I think I'd personally go with Holiday as the best 3rd option or Brown in Boston behind Tatum and Kemba or even Gallinari in Atlanta behind Young/Collins, with Klay injured there are very few teams with an all star caliber 3rd option. If Wall returns to 80% of his 2018 form, then him or Christian Wood could be the best 3rd option out there.   Other candidates are:   * Mike Conley/Bojan Bogdanovic (Utah) * Jusuf Nurkic/RoCo (Portland) * Josh Richardson (Dallas) * Tobias Harris (Philly) * Eric Bledsoe (New Orleans) * Anthony Edwards/Ricky Rubio (Minny) * Jonas Valanciunas (Memphis) * Myles Turner/Warren/Brogdan (Indiana) * Millsap/MPJ (Denver)"
"Warriors fans now have to perform mental gymnastics to claim their older teams were garbage all along as if Steph’s 2nd best player was Jerebko  Klay, Dray, Iggy, Livingston and Looney, even if they weren’t 100%, is better than anything prime Dame has ever gotten in his career. You don’t even have to mention KD.   Prime Dame’s best teammate is a black hole on D in McCollum, and his 2nd best is Jusuf Nurkic"

"2014 draft Chicago receives McDermott, along with Anthony Randolph, a 6-11, 225-pound forward with six years of NBA experience, in exchange for its two first round selections—Jusuf Nurkic and Gary Harris, taken 16th and 19th, respectively—and the lesser of the Bulls’ two 2015 second round picks (Chicago’s and Portland’s)."
We also traded 2 draft picks that ended up being Jusuf Nurkic and Gary Harris for Doug McDermott.
"Do you know who Denver’s center was when we got Jokic? It was Jusuf Nurkic, who outside of Gary Harris, was our best prospect on the team. Hell there was a time he was considered our best player by some fans. We didn’t just hand Jokic minutes to be the guy, especially over someone who was considered our actual future. He earned ever minute he got as a low 2nd round pick until we literally had controversy to get him to start. True we were still bad so we could afford the experiment but it’s not like we didn’t make him earn every bit of time he got. He was even benched for a bit for his own piss poor defense.  +/- isn’t a great stat over one game but over a four game span it can still show trends. And blocks are what make the dude appear on the front page of this sub. He’ll get a block here or there in garbage time of the game and while they are good. They’re against deep back ups and a lot of them are coming from him being out of position, another bad habit he still hasn’t fixed"

Jusuf Nurkic. He's so bad at finishing at the rim &amp; he fouls at the stupidest moments. Frustrating af to watch.
"I have many. cam payne, jae crowder, jordan poole, jusuf nurkic, jj barea, pat bev, deandre jordan, james harden, kyle kuzma, raja bell, &amp; dahntay jones."
"Jusuf Nurkic was never considered a top 20-30 player in his era which are usually the most marketable, famous, and skilled players for their own respective era. Obviously there’s role players in this era better than most players in the 50s but there’s a difference between keeping George Milan in the top 75 all time over Nurkic than leaving out Carmelo Anthony for Dave DeBusschere"

Yeah and jokic really took it to all defense enes kanter and jusuf “27 fouls per 36” Nurkic. I would hardly say jokic even outplayed dame: 33/10/4 w/ 62 TS% versus 34/4/10 w/ 66 TS%. That blazers offense WAS dame and his teammates sold

All of these players are either on the Nuggets roster or still in the NBA:  2014 Gary Harris (I know he was technically traded for, but that's because that's how draft day trades work in the NBA, Denver drafted him as far as I'm concerned) Jusuf Nurkic (same situation as Harris) Nikola Jokic  2016 Jamal Murray (the very last pick acquired from the Knicks in the Carmelo Anthony trade from 2011) Malik Beasley  Juancho Hernangomez (movie star Juancho)  2017 Vladko Cançar Monte Morris  2018 Michael Porter, Jr.  2019 Bol Bol  2020 Zeke Nnaji  2021  Bones Hyland  7 of these guys are on their active roster still. The ones that were traded returned guys like Aaron Gordon and Mason Plumlee, who have been big contributers currently and formerly in Denver).  Not to mention after draft signings in recent years like Facu Campazzo, PJ Dozier and Torrey Craig.    Denver has one of the best run front offices in the NBA."
"Completely disagree. The inebriation between alcohol and cannabis are nowhere near the same type of impairment.   Weed has properties that are medicinal. Alcohol does not. Why are we assuming players are only smoking weed for recreational purposes?   Lets say Jusuf Nurkic is coming back from injury (so fucking help me if he gets injured again) finds that smoking weed helps him push a little bit more while rehabbing, then goes to a game being played on rescricted minutes, should he be compared to a player that drove drunk to the stadium? GTFO HERE"
Why does that guys look like jusuf nurkic?
"Larry nance jr, Jusuf nurkic, Jimmy Butler, Giannis, sabonis.   You have to be an above average defender in order to count as a hack of all trades, those are the rules. I didn’t make them so don’t get mad eat me."
Jusuf Nurkic

Jusuf Nurkic.   He’s done a lot of complaining about not being happy with his situation last year and how much Billups is going to be better for him. He needs to prove he can be a consistent contributor and not let one bad play/situation snowball into multiple bad plays that end up costing the team.  It’s also a contract year for him and he’s probably going to be looking for 20+ million which could be a bad contract if he can’t iron out the inconsistency
Steven Adams or Jusuf Nurkic get the most blows to the head and are lunch pail type old school bigs.
The Jusuf nurkic special.
Also drafted Jusuf Nurkic

Jusuf Nurkic likes this idea.
"That's true, but Schroder is also entering free agency as a point guard in a market which will be flooded with good available point guards. Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills and even Kemba Walker (who could easily be had if a team has the cap space to absorb him). Are there really going to be teams out there lining up to throw tons of money at Dennis Schroder after the lackluster season he just had?  The flip side to you pointing out how guys like Deng and Mozgov got way overpaid is to look at guys like Jusuf Nurkic and how [he got way underpaid](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1015432798138662912?s=19) just because [he entered free agency at the wrong time.](http://es.pn/2ny4aRs) Schroder wants a ton of money but I have serious doubts that the market is going to be there for him."
"&gt; ""After 17 days, she survived the COVID,"" Nurkic says. ""Then on Day 19, she had a heart attack. It was unbelievable.""  &gt; Nurkic got the news as he was on a bus to a game.  &gt; ""At that point, I wished I could just **take a plane to go to the funeral**,"" he says. ""Probably, if I could do it again, I would do that. It's difficult when you're really far away.""

Looks good to me. Or it’s an amazing fake which I doubt. And you wouldn’t get a crazy amount of money for Nurkic’s signature. https://www.pristineauction.com/a1716112-Jusuf-Nurkic-Signed-Nuggets-Jersey-Beckett-COA this one sold for 70 USD. I found others that were like 190 USD. So you’re looking at 70-190 USD. and they have authentication. Id frame it if i was you.
"saying ""kareem is better than ayton"" is not a take that needs to be justified. it's like saying shaq was better than jusuf nurkic, of fucking course he was."
Remember when people thought the 35-39 Blazers could beat LeBron because Jusuf Nurkic was coming back
"&gt; If the Blazers are a believer, the Lakers could have some traction. Horton-Tucker can earn up to about $33-$46 million over three or four years via sign-and-trade. Portland would have a team salary limit at roughly $143 million for the 2021-22 season, which should not be an issue. &gt;  &gt; The Lakers would need to include additional salary, starting with Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Kyle Kuzma. Others, like Montrezl Harrell (if he opts into his final year at $9.7 million) and Alfonzo McKinnie ($1.9 million, some of which would need to be guaranteed) could round out a deal, especially if the Blazers were willing to include center Jusuf Nurkic, who notably told a Bosnian media outlet if Lillard is out, he's out. &gt;  &gt; The Lakers also have the No. 22 pick, which can be dealt in August when Horton-Tucker is eligible for a sign-and-trade (legally, Los Angeles would not be able to select a player at Portland's direction). The Lakers can also send one of their 2027 or 2028 first-rounders and five of their next seven second-rounders (through 2028).  Imagine trading Dame and Nurkic for pricy rotation players, the 22nd pick, and a future 1st.  That's basically what the Raptors were requesting for a couple months of Lowry."
SI is quoting Nurk saying management won’t be making trades.  https://www.si.com/nba/trailblazers/news/jusuf-nurkic-i-was-told-no-one-would-be-traded-from-blazers

"I was about to go on a rant about Bosnia being Europe and stuff: but when you take a look at Nurkic Senior, it's absolutely imaginable there wasn't much Burek left for little Jusuf."
https://www.opencourt-basketball.com/jusuf-nurkic-discovered-dad-7ft-400-pound-cop-beat-14-people-fight/  Allegedly ahahaha
"The tale of how Nurk was discovered:   &gt;Jusuf Nurkic's dad is a policeman in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina. One day a Bosnian sports agent Enes Trnovcevic was reading a newspaper where he read: ""Bosnian policeman, Hariz Nurkic has beaten 14 people in a fight."" He knew what to do instantly! Next day he went to Tuzla and met with Nurkic's father. The only thing he asked him was: ""Do you have a son?"" Jusuf Nurkic was at that time a 14 years old boy and never trained basketball. Enes Trnovcevic took him to Slovenia and gave him an opportunity he accepted and used"
What major injuries benefitted us? Jusuf Nurkic and Goran Dragic aren't exactly my idea of playoff-altering injuries
It’d be nice if he could teach Jusuf Nurkic how to properly execute a point blank layup
Jusuf Nurkic
Jusuf Nurkic don't @ me
"Yeah, Jusuf Nurkic and Lebron James go wayyyyyy back. Best friends in Bosnia."
"You forgot Jusuf Nurkic, whose various lower body injuries have cost the Blazers like 2 playoff series over the years"
"Jokic ended his season with a tantrum ejection, and he frequently misses plays because he’s complaining (very often justified!), but I’m a go with Jusuf Nurkic—he gets in his feels just about every game."
https://www.si.com/nba/2019/02/23/ben-simmons-curses-out-jusuf-nurkic-during-sixers-trail-blazers-video
"The real question is what if every NBA player with the surname ending in “ic” just formed an Eastern European basketball squad go play against an iteration of Team USA.  You’d have Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Nikola Vucevic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Boban Marjanovich, Jusuf Nurkic, and Goran Dragic.  That in and of itself of NBA players is a ridiculously good team and would probably require the BEST American NBA players to commit to beat."
"the disrespect to jusuf ""40% from 3"" nurkic"
"PG: Doncic, SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic, SF: Bojan Bogdanovic, PF: Vucevic, C: Jokic  Bench: Dragic, Pokusevski, Mirotic, Zubac, Bjelica, Boban, Dario Saric, Jusuf Nurkic, Luka Samanic...  2 All NBA players and 3 stars (Vucevic was an all star) in starting lineup. Crazy stacked bench.   This team would crush everyone except USA, and it would be on even levels with USA considering they have MVP and a Luka ""2 All NBA First teams in first 3 seasons in the league"" Doncic."
"Here's a good chunk of them hanging out during the bubble.   &gt;[Among the group was his Trail Blazers teammate Mario Hezonja, Goran Dragic of Miami Heat, Nikola Jokic and Vlatko Cancar of the Denver Nuggets, Luka Doncic and Boban Marjanovic of the Dallas Mavericks, Nikola Vucevic of the Orlando Magic and Ivica Zubac of the Los Angeles Clippers.](https://sports.yahoo.com/jusuf-nurkic-mario-hezonja-break-163547634.html)  &gt;[Nurkic is from Bosnia, Zubac and Hezonja are from Croatia, Vucevic resides from Montenegro, Dragic, Doncic, Cancar all hail from Slovenia, and Marjanovic and Jokic grew up in Serbia.](https://sports.yahoo.com/jusuf-nurkic-mario-hezonja-break-163547634.html)"
"&gt; EDIT: Like what do you call Malcolm Brogdon, Terry Rozier, Goran Dragic, FVV, Dejounte Murray, Jusuf Nurkic, Clint Capela  those are all role players lol, you can make an arbitrary separation between ""role player"" and ""role player who starts and has a bigger role"" if you want, but by all accounts they are still role players. Other than Dragic is there one allstar on that list?  By your definition, someone like Lou Dort stopped being a role player once he started and got the green light to take more than 9-10 shots a game. OG Anunoby isn't a role player because he starts and plays multiple roles on the court? A 3&amp;D player is basically the most sought after role player and that's a guy who can pass decently, drive decently, shoot very good, play defense very good. That's a multi-faceted player (Covington, Beverly, etc.) yet still a role player."
"[Wojnarowski] Portland has agreed to trade star guard Damian Lillard to the Trailblazers for CJ McCollum, Robert Covington, Jusuf Nurkic, and 3 first round picks."
"We also acquired Gary Harris (who used to be good, I promise), Jusuf Nurkic and Nikola Jokic in the same draft.   We traded McDermott for Harris and Nurkic"
Denver drafted   * Jusuf Nurkic * Rudy Gobert * Nikola Jokic * Jamal Murray * Michael Porter Jr.  * Garry Harris  this front office is so fuckin good
"Like a comparable or slightly better Jusuf Nurkic/Nikola Jokic ""Twin Towers"" duo.   Or to say another way: meh"
What can the FO do? What are CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic getting on the trade market that makes the Blazers any better? They just got beat by an unhealthy Denver squad in 6 games. Their run is coming to an end.
Nothing is better than Nurkic showing up to game 5 against the Thunder with a Westbrick got bricks shirt.  Edit: [link to see](https://bigboze.com/product/jusuf-nurkic-got-bricks-next-question-t-shirt/)
"  DeAndre Jordan , George Hill , Jusuf Nurkic, Serge Ibaka, Pat Beverly, Montrezl Harrell ,  Steven Adams, Ricky Rubio, TJ Warren , Jeremy Lamb, Kevin Love, Thad Young,, Al Farouq Aminu, Tomas Satoransky, Gary Harris, Terrace Ross, Danillo Gallinari, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Terry Rozier, Harrison Barnes, Al Horford."
Lots of jabs against former team he was salty he got benched for Jokic was unhappy so got traded.  He also said have a happy summer ( https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/3/29/15104832/jusuf-nurkic-happy-summer-nuggets-blazers-gmib) when Nuggets were eliminated from playoffs as 9th seed and said even more after Blazers eliminated us in 2019
"Finally a realistic post by an actual basketball fan. You’re not going to win a championship with jusuf nurkic and a counterfeit steph curry. This was never a championship caliber team, it was a 500 team that stotts made into a playoff team. They need to fire the GM not the coach."
"I can’t name one, but I’ve got a list: Clint Capela John Collins Goran Dragic Jusuf Nurkic Mikal Bridges Miles Bridges Garrison Matthews"
"Steven Adams, Lonzo Ball, Kira Lewis, Naji Marshall, and some picks for Damian Lillard and Jusuf Nurkic?  Pelicans Starting 5: Dame, NAW, BI, Zion, Nurk  Blazers Starting 5: Lonzo, CJ, Cov, Naji, Aquaman"
This is fake. Jusuf Nurkic is white.
"&gt; Do you think Jusuf Nurkic is Lakers bound?  Nurk's gonna want a big payday, and dude deserves it.  Lakers won't really have significant cap space.    I'm sure Rich Paul would finesse it if he could, but I don't see it happening.  S&amp;T for Kuzma &amp; KCP + picks would be an interesting idea though."
"Dame and CJ get cooked on defense, and they are not that great shot creators to overcompensate their none defense in playoffs against certain match ups. Which put a lot of responsibilities for Jusuf Nurkic to protect the paint, drop coverage, hedge, or switch depending on the situation. It is awesome to see this Blazer team play, but they are mostly a 1st round exit or if everything goes right they can reach conference finals like in 2019 playoffs."
Jusuf Nurkic w 0 PF.. I am in disbelief.
He has a name. Its Jusuf Nurkic.
"Christian Wood,Brook Lopez,Markelle Fultz,Robert Covington,Jusuf Nurkic,Jordan Clarkson,TJ Warren,Spencer Dinwiddie,Seth Curry,Joe Ingles and Jae Crowder  All these players make the same or less amount of money as Kuzma next year"
"&gt;  you guys couldnt even win one game against GS and KD wasnt even playing.  ...the series before we beat Denver starting Enes Kanter.  Then people are somehow shocked we don't do better playing Dame, CJ, and Enes Kanter vs Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green while Dame is playing with a separated rib.    Our center rotation that series was Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard.  We went from starting Aminu, Mo Harkless, and Enes Kanter to Norman Powell, Robert Covington, and Jusuf Nurkic."
"Just 4-5 years ago this team would've killed  C: Rudy Gobert / DeAndre Jordan / Clint Capella / Jusuf Nurkic  PF: Kevin Love / Serge Ibaka / Zach Randolph  SF: Jae Crowder / Tim Hardaway Jr. / Khris Middleton  SG: Klay Thompson / Buddy Hield / Gary Harris  PG: Jrue Holiday / Tony Parker  Love, Holiday, Klay and Gobert were all all star level players in '16-18"
I might be biased.... and he might be polarizing... but god damn do I love Jusuf Nurkic
"Literally everything depends on Jusuf Nurkic, and Jokic has been very clever in getting him in foul trouble the last few games."

"This game really was the ultimate 2021 Portland Trailblazers experience.     \- Damian Lillard splitting the defense to hit wide open wings who proceed to throw up bricks     \- Jusuf Nurkic, knowing his team's only chance of staying in the game is with him on the floor, removing himself from the game by committing a pointless boneheaded foul with five minutes left      \- Terry Stotts deciding the best way to handle Jokic over the final five minutes is by bodying him up with Carmelo Anthony and Robert Covington (!)     \- CJ repeatedly sagging off of Austin Rivers as he drills open three after open three"
"Text from the article:  As the bus carrying the melancholy Denver Nuggets rolled down Highway 101 toward San Francisco International Airport on that Tuesday morning in April, Jamal Murray sat in a seat with his left leg propped up, wiping tears from his eyes.  Across the aisle was his head coach, Michael Malone, and an impromptu therapy session began.  The night before, Murray's left knee had buckled after he'd planted on a drive toward the basket. Malone was at his side on the ground within seconds, waving for help from the medical staff. Later, inside the locker room at Chase Center, Malone was there when the Golden State Warriors team doctors informed him of their diagnosis: torn ACL.  ""Jamal was grasping the enormity of the situation and was asking himself all those questions. Will he recover? Will he ever be the same?"" Malone says. ""What I've learned in my years in basketball and what I've tried to bring to our team for the last six years is that when you face adversity, you cannot run.""  Malone has become known for a few things during what is now a two-decade-long NBA career. One is for his intensity, whether it is dealing with officials, opponents or even his own team when it's time to demand accountability. Google ""Michael Malone rant"" and there are plenty of results from meltdowns about his players' defense to the NBA's rules on letting families into the bubble last year to the LeBron James-Michael Jordan debate.  Though he has a good sense of humor and a New Yorker's sensibility and sarcasm, when Malone is upset, he sets his jaw and digs in emotionally and with his work ethic. When things aren't going right, he has been known to barricade himself in his hotel room or office and plow through the process to figure it out.  Malone's tenure in Denver has been marked by his ability to do just that. Like what he did on the bus that day in San Francisco. And what he did at the first team meeting after Murray's injury was confirmed by an MRI: leading his team through turmoil, something the now veteran coach is making a trademark.  ""I came into the meeting with Jamal's stats and I read them off. All the points, assists, 3-pointers. I wanted everyone to know exactly what we were going to be missing,"" Malone says. ""That 24 hours was very emotional for all of us. But I needed to let the guys know that none of them were expected to be Jamal. They didn't have to play outside themselves. But what they had to do was be positive. To have good body language. To believe in themselves and their teammates. That is what good teams do.""   It was the same type of resilience the Nuggets displayed last year in Orlando, Florida, where they twice came back from a 3-1 series deficit to win and reach the West finals.  ""This team's resiliency is a direct reflection of Mo,"" Nuggets team president Tim Connelly says, calling Malone by his nickname. ""We've haven't had many losing streaks in the last six years. We've responded well to tough times. A lot of credit goes to him.""  Malone is at it again, trying to chart a path for the Nuggets to get through their opening-round series with the Portland Trail Blazers. The injuries in the backcourt -- in addition to Murray, the Nuggets were down Monte Morris (who has since returned), Will Barton and PJ Dozier -- have left him starting 30-year-old rookie Facundo Campazzo and Austin Rivers, who just a few weeks ago was signed by the team on a 10-day contract.  ""Stay positive,"" Malone says, almost as an instruction to himself. ""We are consistent with that. We do that every day no matter who is out there.""  Malone is quick to credit his players, especially Jokic, for the team's ability to follow that mantra over the past two seasons. But while Malone hasn't gotten the attention as other successful coaches have -- the Nuggets have a .625 winning percentage over the past four seasons and are trying to advance in the playoffs for the third consecutive season -- his team has developed a reputation that he has spearheaded.  His career has been highlighted by working with superstars early in their careers. Malone was with LeBron James in Cleveland for five years as an assistant and was part of the effort that transformed James into a willing defensive player. He was the lead assistant in Golden State when Stephen Curry took the leap between 2011 and 2013, overcoming ankle injuries to morph into one of the league's greatest offensive weapons of all time.  And he has been with Jokic since day one, overseeing his development into what will likely be the third MVP whom Malone has impacted.  ""When Nikola was at his first summer league with us, there wasn't one person in our group who thought he'd be an NBA starter,"" Malone says. ""But with LeBron and Steph, you see they have great basketball IQ and they have a great work ethic. Their IQ is off the charts. That's what you also see with Nikola.""  Malone acutely remembers flying home from Dallas after getting blown out in early in the 2016-17 season and talking himself into building the team around Jokic, whom he had been trying to shoehorn into the lineup next to fellow big man Jusuf Nurkic. Within weeks, Nurkic was traded and the team's turnaround began.   Four years later, the turnaround looked to be nearing its apex. After a March trade for Aaron Gordon gave Malone defensive versatility he hadn't had in the past and unlocked a leap for Michael Porter Jr. on offense, the Nuggets promptly went on an eight-game winning streak, looking every bit like bona fide title contenders.  But the Murray injury lowered their ceiling and possibly set that dream back -- and not just this season, as Murray is likely to miss much of next year. And with just one year left on Gordon's contract, it's unclear when or even if the Nuggets will ever get to see what that collection of players could become.  ""No excuses -- that's what we believe,"" Malone says. ""And that's why I'm so proud of this team."""

"I don't remember any incidents from Blazers fans from 2019 like I do for Denver [fans](https://denver.cbslocal.com/2019/05/02/enes-kanter-nuggets-fans-turkey-criticizes-hurtful-denver-recep-tayyip-erdogan-trail-blazers/) and [commentators](https://sports.yahoo.com/damian-lillard-jusuf-nurkic-blazers-nuggets-radio-021533406.html). However, if there were, please enlighten me -- I know we get into our little walled gardens and might not see them, or they might just get downvoted to oblivion in our own subs.  (I don't really count Reddit interactions in this because Reddit is just toxic all around on both sides.)"
"I hear that. But when you have comments like [this](https://denver.cbslocal.com/2019/05/02/enes-kanter-nuggets-fans-turkey-criticizes-hurtful-denver-recep-tayyip-erdogan-trail-blazers/) and [this](https://sports.yahoo.com/damian-lillard-jusuf-nurkic-blazers-nuggets-radio-021533406.html) from 2019 when we have those same two guys on the squad, it's a little hard to just let bygones be bygones this time around.  That said, I don't think the teams themselves have animosity between each other like that, so that's good."
"Individual rebounding doesn't matter as much as team rebounding. Box outs, hustles for loose balls, rebounding numbers don't track those. Prime example would be Enes Kanter vs Jusuf Nurkic. Nurkic's rebound numbers are a lot less flashy, but the Blazers rebound better when he's on the floor because he boxes out, bats out rebounds to guards, and the blazers get scored on a lot less when not playing the worst defensive center in basketball, leading to more rebound chances"
"&gt;a traditional big with some rim running that scored everything at the basket.  He has a lot of modern game in him in that he is an excellent passer and has ""wow"" passes and racks up a bunch of assists. He actually averaged more assists per min than Jokic did at the same age and the Adriatic league is very comparable to the Turkish League in terms of level of play. In addition, for better or for worse, Sengun is really good at getting to the line which usually translates to the NBA. He hasn't developed a 3 point shot yet but he would have to shoot the 3 from 46% to make it the same efficiency that he is already scoring at with super high volume. With his 80% ft percentage there is reason to think he can develop it. In terms of defense, he was number 2 at getting blocks in his league and also has the most steals for a PF/C. I know defensive stats don't always translate but fwiw an international scout Kuzey Kilic said he was the second best rim protector in his league already that contains 2 Euroleague teams and is a top 3 domestic league in europe.  Just look at the chart on this [article](https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/30503246/nba-draft-stock-watch-scouting-international-stars-no-1-pick-contender) that compares Alperen to other euro bigmen at the same age including Porzingis, Jokic, Marc Gasol, and Jusuf Nurkic. Alperen actually improved his assists/blocks/steals considerably since then."
"Looking into this:   Lakers would probably pick lebron, gasol or harrell, maybe the morris twin.     Portland takes Jusuf Nurkic or Enes Kanter.      Harrell and Morris look like they have a lot of anger issues, Gasol has daddy strenght, lebron is strong. I do not think lebron has mental strenght to fight, gasol won't care enough to risk his life. That leaves us with Morris twin and Harrell.     Both Enes and Nurkic know they would easily win with Harrell or Morris, so they both can fight.     Portland wins."

"Jusuf Nurkic and CJ McCollum have missed the exact same amount of games as AD and Lebron, and while Dame only missed 6 games, he was playing while busted up and only playing to keep us afloat. During that time he played 11 games and was averaging 21 points at low efficiency. Zach Collins one of Blazer's best defensive players has been injured for the last two seasons. Please don't complain to a Blazers fan about injuries"
That’s why they call the greatest QB of all time Tom “Jusuf Nurkic” Brady
"*SNF music plays*  Jusuf Nurkic, Quarterback...Portland"
Jusuf “Grant Hill” Nurkic
"Jusuf ""QB1"" Nurkic"
"Jusuf ""Tom Brady"" Nurkic"
"Centers that are definitely better than Ayton right now:   - Embiid  - Jokic  - KAT  - Gobert  - Bam   - AD   - Vucevic   - Capela   - Sabonis     Centers that are arguably as good when healthy:   - Christian Wood   - Jusuf Nurkic   - Kristaps Porzingis   - Jonas Valančiūnas      So at best Ayton is what, the 10th best center in the NBA? It's definitely debatable if he's top 10 or not. I'd say probably 10th or 11th."
Now: Jusuf Nurkic    All-Time: Terry Porter
"Seeing Dame's 0.9 against Houston in the arena. That was worth it.  Being up until 3am depressed that Jusuf Nurkic destroyed his leg in a game against a tanking Nets team, and I guess just watching injuries every single year."

This is why more Filipino players should try their luck abroad.  It would be better for Kai to be a poor man's Jusuf Nurkic than a rich man's Junemar Fajardo.
Hassan Whiteside averaged 16 10 and 3 blocks for Portland last year. He still sucks and was moved out of the rotation when Jusuf Nurkic came back. Box score savants like you are so clueless
Literally none of the guys you listed have won rings without substantial help.   None of those guys are winning rings with their 2nd and 3rd best players being CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic.
Jusuf Nurkic pre injury was a steal at only 12 mil idk about rn tho
"Lol calm down dude you don’t need to get that emotional about a comment that was designed to be informative. But just for you, below is a quick list of major injuries dating back to 2015. I'm not even bothering to include every single one just because that would take too much time and this is enough to illustrate the point.   &amp;#x200B;  **2015**  * Kevin Durant foot Jones fracture * Jrue Holiday fractured tibia * Carmelo Anthony knee surgery, patellar tendon * Russell Westbrook surgery broken hand * Chris Bosh blood clots * Dwight Howard knee surgery knee edema * Derrick Rose surgery torn meniscus * Jusuf Nurkic ankle sprain, missed 37 games * Brandon Jennings achilles * Wes Matthews achilles * Julius Randle broken leg * Kemba Walker torn meniscus * Jabari Parker ACL * Paul George broken leg (olympics, missed NBA season)  &amp;#x200B;  **2016**  * Anthony Davis surgery for torn labrum and knee surgery for patellar tendon * Jrue Holiday orbital fracture, surgery * Mike Conley lower back fracture and achilles tendinitis  * Marc Gasol foot fracture, surgery * Eric Bledsoe torn meniscus * Manu Ginobli TESTICULAR SURGERY due to impact * Michael Kidd-Gilchrist shoulder surgery * Blake Griffin torn quad and broken hand * Al Jefferson torn meniscus * Jarrett Jack torn ACL * TJ Warren fracture foot * Eric Gordon surgery broken finger * Joakim Noah dislocated shoulder  &amp;#x200B;  **2017**  * [Fuck it, I'm getting tired of summarizing all this - just watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9EVSvRofOk)  &amp;#x200B;  **2018**  * Hayward broken foot * Cousins achilles * John Wall achilles * Kyrie knee surgery * OG Anunoby torn ACL * Jabari torn ACL * Porzingis torn ACL * Sefolosha torn MCL * Mike Conley left heel surgery * Jeremy Lin ruptured patellar * Dion Waiters severe ankle sprain * Roberson torn patellar * Reggie Jackson severe ankle sprain  Alright I'm stopping there, this became a tired exercise and I don't have it in me to keep going. At this point this should just be a main post."
1. Nikola Jokic 2. Joel Embiid 3. Rudy Gobert 4. Karl Anthony Towns 5. Bam Adebayo 6. Kristaps Porzingis 7. Domantas Sabonis 8. Nikola Vucevic 9. Clint Capela 10. Jusuf Nurkic 11. Myles Turner 12. Christian Wood 13. Jonas Valanciunas 14. Brook Lopez 15. DeAndre Ayton
Jusuf Nurkic is really good
"I appreciated Lowes description:  &gt;“Dame, Terry Stotts, it’s just like duct tape over there. Duct tape over the crack in the wall, duct tape over the cupboards falling off, the hinges, duct tape, duct tape, duct tape, we snuck out another win.”  &gt;“One every three games Melo gives you 20 off the bench. And Kanter gives you 14 and 15, they just find ways. People want to shit on the Blazers because “oh they are another mid-rung playoff run … two small guards.”  &gt;“The Blazers just endure, and they are currently enduring and if you count them out of the playoffs when CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic got hurt, I got news for you, they’re not out of the playoffs right now. They just endure and Dame, he’s so good that it’s just, it’s crazy how good he is, he’s just so so good, he’s a show every single night. He singlehandedly gives them a chance to win every game.”   Yet half our fanbase is upset at Stotts because the Blazers aren't *better* than 20-14 with all the injuries. Craziness. He's closer to a COTY candidate than someone getting fired."
Jusuf Nurkic. He had a 5x5 in 2019 - 24/23/7/5/5
"Yup, it’s why Denver has a long list of players leaving for more minutes/bigger roles.   Jusuf Nurkic Evan Fournier Trey Lyles Malik Beasley Jerami Grant Mason Plumlee  Will Barton will definitely be next."
"LeBron James, Draymond Green, Chris Paul, CJ McCollum, Ricky Rubio, Jusuf Nurkic, Jared Dudley, DeMarre Carroll, Jamal Crawford, Reggie Miller and other NBA/former NBA players disagree with you"
The blazers by far have the best team  Pg Damian Lillard Sg Brandon Roy Sf Clyde Drexler Pf Carmelo Anthony C Lamarcus Aldridge 6 Cj Mcollum 7 Gary Trent Jr 8 Robert Covington 9 Derick Jones Jr 10 Jusuf Nurkic 11 Enes Kanter 12 Anfornee Simmons  This team is OP literally there 6th man is an all star level player. The Pg through C are all players who were top 10 in the league in their prime also. This is by far the best team
Jusuf Nurkic
Jusuf Nurkic
"While listening to it again my mind just completed ""He made jusuf nurkic his bitch"""
HE MADE JUSUF NURKIC A SCREENSAVER   man I remember this shit like it was yesterday. One of the best looking posters he's done + perfect reaction from their legendary Cavs duo. RIP Fred
Kanter would have a solid team  **G:** Russell Westbrook  **G:** Dame Lillard   **F:** Jaylen Brown  **F:** Jayson Tatum  **C:** Kevin Durant  **Bench:** Marcus Smart / CJ McCollum / Carmelo Anthony / Serge Ibaka / Kristaps Porzingis / Jusuf Nurkic
"There aren’t any good free agents next season and the cap is increasing, so there’s actually a chance that some team would throw more money at him.   Here’s the top 2021 unrestricted free agents:   1.	James Harden 2.	Bradley Beal 3.	Kyrie Irving  4.	Zach LaVine  -	Terrry Rozier -	Aaron Gordon -	Jusuf Nurkic -	TJ Warren -	Gary Harris -	Collin Sexton (He’s a RFA though, so you’d likely have to offer a max or figure out a sign and trade)   It’s pretty darn likely that Harden, Irving, and LaVine all re-sign with their current teams. As a result, Terry Rozier is arguably one of the best UFA’s available next season. His only real competition is Beal (obviously better), Aaron Gordon, Jusuf Nurkic, TJ Warren, and Gary Harris. I might pick Rozier over almost all of those dude other than Beal."
Top 100 is just boring in the NBA. I don't really care where Clint Capela falls versus Jusuf Nurkic.   Top 25 is juicy.

Might be a bad example cause my memory is hazy but it'll basically be like modern day trading Jusuf Nurkic for an even younger Josh Primo (youngest person in 2021 draft)
Jusuf “you talk a lot of shit for being ass” Nurkic?
"Since it's really really difficult to judge defense I often rely on advanced stats. Obviously for me watching game is still the best way to judge something, but stats nowadays are extremely good. My favourite ""firm"" that operate in this particular sector of the game is ""The Ball Index"" ([twitter](https://twitter.com/The_BBall_Index)).

"&gt;Yet, Portland’s analytics team believes the Blazers’ starting lineup of Lillard, McCollum, Powell, Covington and Jusuf Nurkic ranks among the league’s best  Offensively, maybe. Defensively, not so much."
"&gt; Portland’s analytics team believes the Blazers’ starting lineup of Lillard, McCollum, Powell, Covington and Jusuf Nurkic ranks among the league’s best...  Portland needs a new analytics team then. 3 guard staring lineup will get abused in the playoffs"
All this to overpay for Jusuf Nurkic in 22
"What free agent class?  f Brooklyn's big three extends this off-season, Zach Lavine will be the only top tier free agent available and Chicago can offer more money, a better market and a comparable winning situation.  The next tier sucks. It's pretty much Aaron Gordon, TJ Warren, Jusuf Nurkic and Marcus Smart with Michael Porter Jr, Colin Sexton and Jaren Jackson Jr. as restricted free agents that would almost certainly get matched."

"March 25, 2019. The Brooklyn Nets are playing at the Portland Trail Blazers. It's a tough game all game long, and is the game most remembered for Portland Center, Jusuf Nurkic, suffering a gruesome compound fracture in overtime.  When it happened, every Brooklyn Nets big man had fouled out. Jared Dudley was playing center, and Nurkic was feasting. As Nurkic dominated the glass, he must've pushed himself to the point of exhaustion, and when he came done partially on someone else's foot, his weight came down wrong and his leg shattered. He would be out for for the better part of the next two years, and when he returned he was nowhere near his peak form.   But it didn't have to happen... Near the end of regulation, down one point, Seth Curry with the Blazers was fouled. Two shots. He missed one, but made the other... And right there, overtime could've been prevented. Nurkic could've walked away healthy, had Curry not split the pair. He could've made em both and won, or missed em both and lost, a fair trade for any blazers fan of it had meant keep Nurkic in one piece.  Had he not been injured... The Blazers could've given the Warriors a real test in the WCF, which resulted in a sweep, but only after blowing leads in 3 of the 4 games. This is the same team that beat the warriors twice in the regular season, waved goodbye to OKC, and beat the Nuggets in 7 games on the backs of CJ, ET, and Enes Kanter's separated shoulder. They gave the warriors a real run for their money in those games, and had Nurkic been healthy, he would've been considered a top 5 big man in the league going into those playoffs. Instead, with Nurkic out indefinitely, the Blazers had a giant hole to fill at the 5. Had Nurk been healthy, they could've beat the Warriors and potentially been to the first finals in lord knows how long, and Dame could've had a serious shot at a chip.   And that's why you gotta make your free throws."
"donovan mitchell, ban adebayo, jamal murray, pascal siakam, myles turner, devin booker, marcus smart, jusuf nurkic, clint capela, cj mccollum, rudy gobert, damian lillaird, draymond green, kemba walker, klay thompson, and jimmy butler… are all players within the last 10 years drafted after the number 5 pick.   your point still stands but it also shows that you can get some pretty damn good - truly great players if you hit on your picks."
It is strange how reference sites like bballref and wikipedia maintain that fiction with sometimes no indication that a trade happened. Like if you look up [the Bull's draft history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls_draft_history) you would think that the Bulls had a solid first round in 2014 with Jusuf Nurkic and Gary Harris.
“Who’s ass now?” - Jusuf Nurkic
"CJ McCollum, Jusuf Nurkic and 2023 top 5 protected first."
"Alright. Let’s list a 12-man roster for each team.  Team USA starters: Curry, Kawhi, Bron, KD, AD Team USA Bench: Harden, Thompson, George, Butler, Holiday, Draymond, Lopez/Turner/Allen if we really need a big body.  Team Europe Starters: Doncic, Bogdanovic, Bogdanovic, Antetokounmpo, Gobert Team Europe Bench: Jokic, Gallinari, Porzingis, Sabonis, Vucevic, Capela, Valanciunas  Now, for team USA:  - Team USA has All NBA talent written amongst all of them. Their offense is unstoppable — everyone can iso, everyone can move off the ball, open looks everywhere, and have great ball movers.   - Also, everyone can shoot. Everyone also has IQ, on both ends. Their defense can be weak at times (when no AD can anchor the defense, but Dray at the 5 or Lopez/Turner/Allen can work okay just not great) but their guard/wing defense is also unstoppable. Kawhi/Bron IQ off the charts, and these are just from the starters.   - Everyone is good/borderline elite at on ball or off ball defense. Not a single one of these guys can be hunted on the mismatch (aside from the obvious point guard being hunted for the big man, but we have Holiday who could play for Curry if he gets hunted a lot). They can’t hunt anyone on iso’s. They can switch everyone on defense. Literally there’s nothing that this team can’t do.   On the other hand, we have Team Europe.   - Your starters have elite offense, Luka-Giannis PNR would be unstoppable (but it would kind of not work because Gobert clogs up the paint).   - Giannis is also a non-shooter, and team USA can deploy the Giannis wall to stop him. And even if he makes the right read and makes the right pass, team USA’s defensive IQ + defensive personnel is enough to either close out or rotate on the open man.  - Gobert can’t run the PNR with Luka (he can only run it with Conley) but even if he can run it he can only finish lobs, so if they deny him the lob his other option would only be to pass, since he doesn’t have a post game.   - That bench lineup is also sus, they lack a ballhandling guard (could use maybe Dragic here, but if you have at least 2 of Luka/Jokic/Giannis on the floor then playmaking wouldn’t be a real issue) OR a defensive wing (OG Anunoby could be good here).  - You also have bucket getters in both the Bogies but they’re only average on defense (including Luka as well).   - Gobert’s defense can be schemed against (see Clippers vs Jazz series) and if they replace him with someone like Jokic or Vucevic their defense will very much take a hit, the USA squad will feast on it.   - Capela is also a paint clogger, and everyone else is at most average on defense (and this is me being generous lol).   - Also, you got Porzingis, who’s a spot up shooter who can’t really bang anyone on the low post despite being a 7 ft giant lol.   (Btw, this is the best European players of 2020-2021. If you wanna replace anyone here, you could replace them with the likes of Evan Fournier, Dennis Schroder, OG Anunoby, Goran Dragic, Maxi Kleber, Jusuf Nurkic, Enes Kanter, Lauri Markkanen.)   So, after doing a bit of research, I must say that the USA team has no glaring holes in them (assuming that AD plays at the 5, otherwise their biggest hole would be center, and even then I’d say that Lopez/Turner or even Allen are serviceable enough that they can, at the very least, apply pressure and slow down anyone under the rim but not outright stop them completely). Team Europe tho, their bench is really average defensively but everyone is pretty good offensively. No one is really elite here (except for Jokic, Luka, and Giannis; although 2 of these are average at defense so they’re only elite offensively). Not to mention that there are more potential superstars in the upcoming future, this isn’t to mention Zion, Morant, Mitchell, Young, Booker, Edwards, Mobley, Cunningham, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Chet Holmgren. Heck, we could even throw someone like Mikal Bridges or Trey Murphy III, who could be very very good defensively (and offensively we only need them to knock their 3s down). Europe has maybe at most a few, and even then they’re not guaranteed to be superstars (only Luka was the most recent one).  So, as of now, and in the future, Team USA &gt; Team Europe."
"Could you imagine team Yugoslavia:  Luka, Jokic , Boban, Jusuf Nurkic, bogdan Bogdanovic, dragic, Vucevic, zubac, mirotic.   That’s a fucking squad right there…"
"Porzingis as well. Although I doubt anyone thinks of him as good. Also Jusuf Nurkic, Steven Adams, the Gasol bros. Bam technically could have opted to play for Nigeria too."
"Jusuf Nurkic. I am from Bosnia. I never really watched basketball until I heard he got traded to Portland. Didnt even knew who he was. I looked into him and he looked decent. I started watching and instantly got hooked. Huge Portland fan ever since, moved on from Nurk being my favorite player to Dame tho."
"We need more people like Jusuf Nurkic who desperately wants to get his home country, Bosnia-Herzegovina, access to the vaccine that Americans like ray allen have the luxury to wait to get and then have the audacity to tell people it's their choice to pass on it."
Jusuf Nurkic is a pretty good passing big man
"The Morris brothers have already been (involved in? accused of?) a pretty nasty assault.  Jusuf Nurkic is huge and from Bosnia and has a temper.  I absolutely wouldn't fuck with Crazy Eyes Bobby Portis, though, that's for sure."
"1. 2012 - AD and D-Lil almost do it alone. But just counting the guys listed there are 22 Allstar Appearances, 5 Rings, 1 DPOY award, amongst other thigns 2. 2018 - This is early but Luka and Trae are clearly two of the stars of the future, and to some degree the present. SGA and Ayton are also only scratching the surface.  3. 2014- Probably the two best centers in the league (And top the MVP finishers this year), a Breakout candidate in Randle and two solid if underrated guys in Gordan and Lavine. This was a deep draft that also had Marcus Smart, Capela, Boddanovic, Joe (And Gary!) Harris, and Jusuf Nurkic 4. 2011 - This class has accomplished a lot. Klay is one of the best shooters ever. Kawhi is the part-robot to dominate the league. This class is full of dudes who have aged out a little (it was 10 years ago), but Kanter, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas and Iman Shumpert help teams. Tobias Harris still solid.  5. 1. 2019 - Another young but already great class. Zion and Ja bring the average up, but besides hunter and Herro already showing their value in the league, this class also has guys like RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Darius Garland and Nikiel Alexander-Walker. This class may rise as years go on 6. 2016 - This one should probably be higher, but hey, im lazy and ive already moved thigns around. Simmons gets a lot of hate, but he is a good shooting coach away from being incredible. BI continues to improve each year. As does Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Jamal Murray, Malik Beasley and Caris Levert 7. 2017 - Tatum is elite. Mitchell is on his way there. people overlook Fox because he plays for the Kings, but he is still very good. And Bam is definitely in the top centers in the league. I still belive in Lonzo Ball. Is he Jason Kidd? No. Obviously. But he might be Rondo with a shot, and that is pretty special too (Cue my whole take being thrown out for Lonzo praise) Also John Collins 8. 2015 - This class is top heavy. But its a good top. Injuries and poor team management has hurt the careers of KAT, D-Russ, and Porzingas, but they are all incredibly talented and still dont reach the gym of this class in Devin Booker. The best guy in this class not named is probably Bobby Portis. So yea 9. 2013 - Giannis alone should probably raise this. But this class was rough. ANthony Bennett, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len in the top 5. Yuck. That said Rudy is also special. This class had plenty of guys good enough to be the 3rd best player on a contender. And plenty youve never heard of 10. 2020 - This class is hurt by small sample size. Lamelo and Ant def seem like they could be great. Few other guys are solid. This class will likely rise, but until I see more theyll need to earn it"
"The author of the article believes that:  &gt; The emphasis on retaining Powell comes from data that shows the starting lineup of Lillard, McCollum, Powell, Covington and Jusuf Nurkic last season had the NBA’s fourth-best net rating among starters, behind Brooklyn, the Clippers and Philadelphia.  So they think the starting lineup is fine, but:  &gt; Although Olshey has never publicly admitted it, he knows he failed last season in not recognizing a bench centered around Carmelo Anthony and Enes Kanter was fatally flawed from a defensive standpoint.   So essentially, they want to keep the starters and rebuild the bench from scratch and hope that's enough."
"The crazy thing about that WCF against Golden State is the Blazers had at least an 11 point lead in every game including 2 into the second half and still got swept, and that’s without Jusuf Nurkic. Zach Collins was really good defensively in that series."

You gotta take big risks like this on your drafted assets  Tell me how this comment isn’t directly applicable to the Gordon Hayward RFA situation in Utah? That’s basically the exact situation the nuggets have found themselves in with all 3 of their max players coming off of their rookie deals. And in all 3 situations, they maxed the player early before they even hit RFA.  And more than just maxes, the nuggets in general just try to do right by their guys to foster goodwill around the league. It’s the same reason we traded Jusuf Nurkic to a place he could start. It’s the same reason we facilitated a s&amp;t for Gallo when he was in FA after leaving us. It’s the same reason we picked up Millsap’s 30m team option despite him clearly no longer being a 30m player that year.  Small market teams have to operate a bit differently. Building a culture and showing guys that you will do right by them rather than just cutthroat business is a legitimate angle to try to make your market more appealing. It obviously has opportunity costs associated with it though, which is that you lose the upside of ruthless cutthroat business decisions when they benefit you. But it’s a trade off worth making.  I’ve also posted elsewhere in the thread that MPJ’s issue was one with a small chance of expected recurrence based on the medical information we have available to us. I assume that’s the same info the team had when they made the decision. Even with this setback, it’s not like his career is over the way you guys are proclaiming by saying it’s the worst contract in the league."

"Literally nothing you listed implies he's one of the best defensive talents of all time. Jusuf Nurkic has a higher RAPTOR than him, are you going to say that Jusuf Nurkic is the greatest defensive player of all time? You're being completely hyperbolic. Thybulle comes off the bench and does not face the competition that the greats faced night in night out. The sample size of him against elite players is miniscule when were comparing to the GOATs."
Jusuf Nurkic without a doubt. He’s HUGE and attempts to finish like he’s 5’8 and 150 pounds  He lets one bad play/foul call snowball into like 10 minutes of awfulness

&gt;I don’t have the athletic but is it basically because he didn’t play for the national team obviously to be with his wife?  In other team sports players are never skiping national team games.Only NBA players do that.And on the balkans what you did in national team means 10x more than what you did in your [club.So](https://club.So) people become very angry when players not play.Same ih with Jusuf Nurkic here in Bosna.He has haters becouse he is not playing always for national team.There are worse players but much more popular becouse they show every time.

Jusuf Nurkic was discovered because a scout heard about a 7ft tall police officer in a small town in Bosnia sinning a bar fight against 16 other dudes. Scout rocked up out of the blue and asked if he had a son.
"Larry Nance Jr, or Jusuf Nurkic before he got injured in 2019."
"Replies like this are so brain dead annoying. You're going to sit here and tell me that CJ McCollum, Norman Powell, Jusuf Nurkic, Robert Covington and Larry Nance aren't assets that would return value in a trade?"
"Short Summary-  Teams that were mentioned - Heat - Celtics - Mavs - Bulls - Hawks - Blazers - Warriors  Both Zach and Chris had differing opinions on how each team will either under-achieve or over-achieve. Really only agreeing that the Celtics were going to be better than what most believe.   Funny enough during the Blazer section towards the end, I mentioned the same exact stat on why I was optimistic about the upcoming season.   See [tweet. ](https://twitter.com/jwquick/status/1391430838185648135)  Since the Blazers' starting lineup has included Jusuf Nurkic and Norman Powell (24 games), Portland is 16th in defense, 2nd in offense and 5th in net rating. The only teams with better net rating: Jazz, Clippers, 76ers and Knicks"
"Top 10 maybe? Seems too slow to be a great defender. He doesn’t come across as a great athlete to be a run runner. He doesn’t have a jumpshot. Just seems like a player that doesn’t have much value in today’s game, but his scoring potential puts him above most of the leagues big men.  I’d definitely put Jokic, Embiid, Gobert, KAT, Bam, Ayton, Allen and Horford above him.   He’s probably in the Brook Lopez, Jusuf Nurkic, Clint Capela range."
"As Net rating. See [tweet](https://twitter.com/jwquick/status/1391430838185648135).

Jusuf Nurkic Sr. laid waste to the entire Sacramento Kings roster smh
Holy shit at first I read this as “Jusuf Nurkic was discovered dead” and my heart sank
"Jusuf Nurkic is a solid interior scorer, despite the fact that he shoots EVERYTHING off-balance. It’s so weird.  Derrick Jones Jr. can only score by dunking."

"&gt;  but out of his class, there are 3-5 players better than him  Embiid, Smart, Randle, Lavine, Capela, Jerami Grant, Nikola Jokic, Jordan Clarkson, Jusuf Nurkic (when healthy), TJ Warren (when healthy) are all guys who I think are better than Wiggins is right now. Dude probably isn't top 10 from his own class."
"Bosnian Beast, Jusuf Nurkic"

"Jusuf Nurkic, Donovan Mitchell, and OG Anunoby  So, uh, Faustian fleece lmao"
"In the playoffs everybody not named Russell Westbrook fucks Dame up, people just like his loyalty to much to see it.  Dame has played in 11 playoff series in his career, 4 of those he shot under 40% from the field and twice he shot under 20% from 3. The argument that he gets double teamed is also so stupid it doesn't make any sense, James Harden and Steph get doubled in 99% of the possessions they play, they still don't shoot 18% from 3.  Portland fans on this sub love them some CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic until they have to defend Dame's struggles, then they hate them and say that Dame doesn't have enough help."
"lol idc about his offense in a starting lineup with damian lillard, cj mccollum, and hopefully jusuf nurkic (who knows with these injuries) he's needed for his defense.   portland was essentially matching the clippers bucket for bucket, but still down by multiple scores because they couldn't get a single stop."
"Jusuf Nurkic yelled, “There you go!” CJ McCollum gave a look of pleasant surprise. Norman Powell belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Damian Lillard hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"Nurkic was discovered because his dad (who is 7ft tall, and 400 lbs) was a cop and beat up 14 people in a bar fight. A talent scout saw the story in a newspaper and instantly contacted him to see if he had any sons. Jusuf was 14 at the time and had never trained at basketball in his life."
Jusuf Nurkic breaking his leg.

"The nuggets also drafted jusuf nurkic, gobert, and donovan mitchell in recent memory. Theyve been way on point."
Gotta go back 7 years for context but the Bulls traded picks that became Gary Harris and Jusuf Nurkic to draft Doug McDermott then traded Doug McDermott and Taj Gibson for Cameron Payne.
"I don't see it.  While they have the talent, they haven't put it together.  Theyve had the worst luck with H&amp;S protocols, but several of the teams above them in the standings haven't had a lot more luck:  Mavericks also had tons of H&amp;S protocol games and other injuries- have a better record  Blazers have missed their 2nd/3rd best players in CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic for the majority of the season- have a better record  Even the top contenders like Lakers and Nets have a lot of accumulating missed games from their stars, and they've all hold better records.    I'm not going to complain too much about them being put above the Spurs, Hornets, Knicks, Hawks, and Grizzlies.  Still, that's FIVE more teams with better current records."

"Mozgov didn't get his money due to max contracts, he got it due to that one time cap spike in the summer of 2016 (and due to the idiocy of Jim Buss and Mitch Kupchak, of course). Everyone who was a free agent that summer got a windfall of cash because of the cap spike, but that didn't last. [Look at what someone like Jusuf Nurkic got in free agency just two years later.](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2773984-report-jusuf-nurkic-trail-blazers-agree-to-4-year-48-million-contract.amp.html) Obviously a much better player, but he got $4 million less per year just because the cap space wasn't there in 2018 like it was in 2016.   The history of the max contract is that it's something the owners insisted on about 20 years ago. Before then players like Jordan, Shaq and KG were getting a third or even half of the team's cap all by themselves and the owners wanted to put a cap on what they'd have to pay these guys, so they got the max salary implemented. It was never something the players wanted. The NBAPA would be all in favor of something which allows the players to earn anything the market feels they're worth."
Fun fact: Jusuf Nurkic is the most recent NBA player to pull off the 5x5.  His statline was 24/23/7/5/5
"Alperen Sengun. He is 18 years old and putting up 19.3/9.4/2.4/1.3/1.6 on 70% TS. This in a European grown man league and he is doing it as an 18 year old. Is like number 1 or 2 in the league for points, rebounds, blocks, efficiency and is one of the highest for assists and steals for a bigman. Problem is he is listed as 6'9"" or 6'10"" and he doesn't look the part in terms of athleticism. Some places have him as top 10 in their draft board, some have him as mid second round. He reminds me of Domatas Sabonis but I don't know if that is his floor or his ceiling. At the same age, he was more productive than Jusuf Nurkic, Porzingis, Marc Gasol, and Dario Saric as compared to an [article](https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/30503246/nba-draft-stock-watch-scouting-international-stars-no-1-pick-contender) (scroll down to see a graph)."
Jusuf Nurkic  Trail Blazers can stick a corpse under basket and get at least a dozen rebounds so 20 is not out of question. Plus lots of 3 PT marksmen to dish it too.

"""A particularly troubling incident occurs in Portland, when Godzilla rips Jusuf Nurkic in half. RIP, Nurk.""  Blazers just cant seem to avoid injury problems."
"**TEAM CONTRXT**  As the training camps gets underway for Team Contrxt, many in the local media doubt their chances. Mickey Mouse looks overmatched by most power forwards, and Ron Weasley is arguably the least magical member of his own household.   But then, star center GODZILLA enters the building, and immediately gives the moribund franchise some hope of competing. Stephen A. Smith compares him to a young Wilt Chamberlain, only with a slightly smaller penis.  As the season starts, the team immediately tries to take advantage of their mismatch down low. Godzilla is smart enough to learn the ropes of the game, and breaks Wilt Chamberlain's record with 138 points in his first game out (take that for d-size!). The team roars out to an 8-0 start to the season.  Overwhelmed and unable to guard Godzilla, teams start to take a different approach: get the big man in foul trouble. He's constantly called for ""ticky tack"" fouls like slashing and biting. A particularly troubling incident occurs in Portland, when Godzilla rips Jusuf Nurkic in half. RIP, Nurk.  Commissioner Adam Silver steps in and lays the hammer down, suspending Godzilla for the rest of the season (and testing him for PEDs.)  With Godzilla out, Team Contrxt is in loads of trouble. Mickey Mouse gets abused down low. Players take even more pride in working over the Racist Dude, who huffs and puffs struggling to guard the perimeter.  Ultimately the team falls all the way down to 8-74, the worst record of all-time. However, with Godzilla slated to come back next year (off suspension), hopes remain high for the future."
"I personally think Ben is right there. Onball Kawhi is top 3 all time, Simmons may be a tier lower. But he’s more versatile (he doesn’t guard Centers because we got big boy back there, but when he does he’s solid eg. Jusuf Nurkic), he’s got better help instincts at the nail. His hands aren’t quite at that level, but that’s more than made up for in the fact that he may be legitimately the greatest Pick and Roll defender of all time at the guard position."
