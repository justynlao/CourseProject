I'm convinced Dean Wade is chandler parsons with a full beard.
"Dean Wade, Matthew Dellavedova, Collin Sexton, Darius Garland, ICE Okoro"
Cavs legend Dean Wade already branching out into broadcasting.
Lebron this lebron that ... blah blah blah. The real MVP of the league is Dean Wade
Who ever drafts him needs to pick up Flo Thamba and dean wade
"Claxton,Dean wade,Terence Davis,Isiah Roby,Terence Mann, and Eric Paschall"
"Duncan Robinson, Gary Payton II, Dean Wade, Seth Curry, Paul Millsap, George Hill, Mike Miller, Allen Crabbe, Thanasis Antetounkumpo, and...MEYERS LEONARD!"
Now they just need to find a way to get Dean Wade from the Cavs.
"Love how Dean Wade was like cover the pass, cover the pass, oh shit that's Curry"
"Sexton is extremely overrated, Garland up until the week you watched was passing too much, but he has to get assists to guys like Dean Wade, while Sexton just runs to him expecting the ball. Love just came back."
Cleveland legend Dean Wade
Can we please have a daily stickied discussion thread about Dean Wade every day. Thank you
The best answer is to play all 4 of our young guards and stagger their minutes.   Our current line up:   DG-Sexton- Okoro probably start (especially early in the season)   Then bench DG to bring in Cade: so we have Sexton- Okoro- Cade this way Cade gets some playmaking experience against the starters of opposing teams   Have DG run the bench unit with Cade: he needs some off ball experience sitting either Sexton or Okoro depending on who needs rest.   Basically just cycle the 4 players in 3 spots giving one a break.   But please note we have several young players who we are training up: Broderick Thomas- Lamar Stevens- Dean Wade - Dylan Windler
"Yes and I looked it up for you. The only D Wade in the NBA is the starting power forward for the Cleveland Cavaliers, Dean J (For Jackson not Jumper which would have been perfect) Wade. The whole of the NBA is on notice"
"Dean ""The Real"" Wade is a fookin legend. You better put some Respekt on that name!"
"Give that Dean Wade looking event staffer a raise, he's all class"
Dean 'Fuck KU' Wade
"""Dean Wade"" is the most NBA2K computer-generated-rookie-ass name i've ever heard."
"Wouldnt say it like that. If you take time just learn the base of a jumper, you could prob shoot anyone off the game tbh. That's why the likes of the Dean Wades of the world could destroy Luka on that 2k. No joke, Luka has a terrible base like Lebron but he cant slash like him so he was hard to use and wasn't good to play with.   Cant remember if Dean Wade had a easy base but he made everything unlike luka."
"lmao fair i'll tell you the context if you want to read but, the context is Dean wade hit anything if you wanted  to do an overall boost  to achieve 30-0 on Limited( All bronze lineup with someone like a goat-tier card.) Genuine Gem for bronze lineups and if used by good players. it could be used to terrorize new players on Unlimited but also people doing the same thing. Only know this cuz I watched DBG last year while Wade was going off on myteam lol"
Where does Dean Wade stand
Dont tell me you forgot about2k20 MYTEAM BRONZE GOAT Dean WADE!?!
Dean Wade- small town where you have to work hard to get your dues
Dean Wade
Dean Wade GOATED
"Allen and Dean Wade are dominating the Pacers front court, as was predicted."
Dean Wade
Thats because Dean Wade started
Dean Wade
"Almost great, but I would suggest some changes.   Remove Nance and move Love to the 3, put Dean Wade at the 2 because everyone knows D. Wade is a great SG and you are good to go, best lineup."
"A team to match us on players out in those trying times! Anyway, expected lineups for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Expected Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (10-21) | [](/ATL)Hawks (13-17) ---|---   D. Garland |   Trae Young  C.

Dean 'D-Wade' Wade
Dean Wade????
Dean Wade
Dean Wade sucks
"Well it’d probably be Delly, Dean Wade and Damyean Dotson. Delly’s an expiring and although Wade and Dotson are on multi year contracts they combine to make 3.5m/year so it’s not that much of a cap hit"
"Dean Wade, Marques Bolden and probably Delly"
Say what you will but Bronze Dean Wade with the leaner is PD steph curry
Charania?!? No I’m *checks notes* Dean Wade of course I’m Dean Wade
"Cavs say hello lol   We had a 3-4 game stretch where both Garland and Sexton were injured, then Exum went down, and Delly has been in concussion protocol since before the season started. At one point we ran:   PG: Cedi Osman (a small forward)    SG: Dean Wade (a power forward)   SF: Thon Maker (a power forward/C)   PF: McGee   C: Drummond   needless to say we didn't win that game lol. but the defense wasn't actually that bad!"
Dean Wade too
Dean Wade.   Heard it here first.
"Is this the guy who's self claimed better then D-Wade?   I mean, The Truth is aight, but Dean Wade be better the you all day bro."
"Loved Eric Reid calling Dean Wade ""The Unnamed Cavalier"" haha"
"Did Eric Reid (Heat play-by-play) just call Dean Wade ""unnamed Cavalier"" ?? LMAO"
Dean Wade still plays there lol

"Dean Wade actually had a good first half, but the Cavs were missing Allen and Nance tonight. Hartenstrjn added five fouls and three syllables to the evening."
Dean Wade showing why he is the GOAT
Imagine if that Dean Wade stat was real lol
I’m assuming you being sarcastic but it’s hard to tell bc Dwyane Wade and Dean Wade both plays in Cleveland
Lol no. Dean Wade just got dunked on by Matisse
Dean Wade with 9 points in like the last 90 seconds

"Go back and look at that roster. It wasn't nearly as bad as the Cavs this year, and even the rookies were future starters and all stars. Not sure you can say the same for Lamar Stevens, Dean Wade, Cedi, etc"
"Cavs: Garland, Sexton, Okoro, start like every game and we’re drafted by us.   Then we have Cedi OsMan (draft night sign and trade), Dylan Windler, 26th pick.   If you count undrafted players who we picked up and play for us: Mathew Dellavedova, Lamar Stevens, Broderick Thomas, Dean Wade.   Aside from Delly, all these players get decent minutes too"
"Cedi and Dean Wade might be the two worst players in the NBA get get those kind of minutes -no idea why Windler isn't getting Cedi's minutes... I want to like Garland, but he has so many 'blah' games, I'm not sold on him.  Allen needs more touches, Okoro looking strong, Sexy still battling."
This metric obviously hasn’t watched Dean Wade play basketball this year
Damn Dean Wade had actually been playing really well of late. With Nance coming back as well sadly his minutes will take a dip. Welcome back Klove tho
How much help does Dean Wade need!?
Dean Wade
Dean Wade is a cheat code. Team B and it isn’t close
Which Wade? Dean or Dwyane?
For the Cavs I’d say it’s pretty easily Dean Wade
"I agree, but in a game that was ultimately decided by 5 points, they are really impactful. And we’ll just ignore Ayton blatantly shoving dean wade in the post, and cam Johnson getting a foul call on a pull up without being literally touched on any part of his body or jersey."
I think Dean Wade is listed as a forward.
"Yeah, I think that Herro definitely got inspired to work on his game after playing against Dean Wade"
Dean Wade
"Dean Wade is a hybrid of Steph Curry, Lebron James, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and Larry Bird"
Ricky Rubio and Dean Wade busking on the street with their banjos after the game.
"First Half Takes:  - In conclusion, Cavs are back. This team is actually pretty good, doesn't look like the big boyes are a gimmick. We just need our sweet prince back and we'll be in solid running for at least a playin spot.  - Dean Wade somehow decided to become prime MJ this half on defense and I'm all for it  - Jarrett Allen is a star.  - Has anyone ever seen Darius Garland and God in the same room?"
KD is good but unfortunately Dean Wade is just the superior player in all respects
Dean Wade is prime MJ on offense and prime MJ on defense  There I said it
DEAN WADE THE DURANT STOPPER
"I've been a Dean Wade fan since his Kansas State days. I was such a fan I picked them to win the NCAA in my bracket that one year. Losing a finals would not be fun, but if Dean Wade at least plays well, it'll be better."
I love dean Wade
Okay. Well as much as I'd hate to see Steph get hurt in any capacity I'm gonna have to subscribe to this.  Can Dean Wade be the finals MVP?
Yeah.... bring attention to the issue. That's the goal. Nobody cares if Dean Wade wears Nike lmao
"Yes, a regular season game in which he torched the 9-8 Cavs led by the immortals Dean Wade, Darius Garland and co. is proof that he is better than Magic freaking Johnson.  Steph is amazing, revolutionized the game and is top 15 all-time, he is not in Magic Johnson's level. Magic never blew a 3-1 lead nor had more turnovers than assists in an NBA Finals, Magic also never missed the freaking playoffs in his prime.  Downvote me to hell, but Jesus, recency bias is a hell of a drug."
I don’t really blame cavs fan not going to this game. Dean Wade and Ed Davis in the starting lineup isn’t getting anyone hyped lol

I honestly thought they were for Dean Wade tonight.
Dean Wade kinda nice though
Yeah that is rough but really impressive amount of effort from the Cavs considering that. Like Ed Davis and dean wade on the boards? Wow.
"""Excuses"" he says, as if my point isn't completely valid. You needed a 20 point quarter from Curry to beat a team that's literally forced to play Dean Wade and Ed Davis as starters in an 8-man rotation."
Didn’t see a Dean Wade masterclass coming but here we are
i did but someone reported it because i posted them as D. Wade instead of Dean Wade and they got removed
And then Dean Wade of all people bails us out
Ok now post Dean Wade highlights
They’re not getting Dean Wade lmao
They should trade for Dean Wade if they want someone that’s not afraid to chuck 3s all game
So if you don't count Tacko Fall because the guy plays like he's never held a basketball before we had only one other player above 6'7 which was a 6'9 Dean Wade.
"When you take into account all the other injuries/illnesses we will probably drop every one of those games. Dean Wade, Denzel Valentine, and Tacko Fall are getting extended, non garbage time minutes."
"I like Dean Wade. Not for 38 minutes though. He's good when he comes off the bench to fill his role, and has been doing it ok this season, but he doesn't have the talent to start and play that many minutes. Definitely can't hate him though coming off the bench with smaller minutes."
Normally I wouldn’t mind him being missing but his replacement was Dean Wade playing 38 minutes last night and that made me wanna die.
"Have tickets to the game and was lookin forward to seeing all these guys in person.  Denzel Valentine, Dean Wade, Dylan Windler just don’t hit the same.   Tacko getting 20 minutes should be fun I guess"
"No. His defense wasn't bad at all and he spaces the floor. Would be nice if his shot would drop (can say that about a lot of guys this year), but he's a million times better than dean fucking wade, kevin love, or stevens."
"damn, going from 3 bigs starting + love off the bench to dean wade as your biggest player getting substantial minutes is quite a shift"
Here I was thinking Dean Wade doesn’t count because he’s on the roster right now. How soon I forget about Dwyane.  And technically Kyrie is not a current player…
1 point for Mobley and 0 for Dean Wade.  Still were up 88-87 on Rubio and Osman's heroics.
"Nah, no way.  Markkanen has shot terribly this year but he showed actual toughness and grit.  And there's no way that he's not better than Dean Wade, Kevin Love, or Lamar Stevens."
I'm gonna be 100% honest here.  This guy Dean Wade is so fucking bad lmao
"we are missing 3 starters, not to mention mobley for the entire fourth quarter. we gave DEAN WADE AND DENZEL VALENTINE A COMBINED 57 MINUTES dude."
&gt; When Dean Wade is the only healthy forward left on your roster you are going to have a bad time.  Isn't Cedi a forward?
Obviously we would’ve have won 100% but you guys had like 5-6 easy uncontested layups in the 4th cause dean wade was our last line of defense
Tacko Fall had 8 minutes of not garbage time play. Cavs were down 4 starters and 2 valuable bench pieces.   When Dean Wade is the only healthy forward left on your roster you are going to have a bad time.
"Dean Wade played seemingly 56 minutes in this basketball game, including the entirety of crunch time as a small-ball 5, getting dusted repeatedly by Schroeder to seal it. Hard to watch that in what was otherwise a really entertaining game."
Legit don't know what Dean Wade is in the NBA for. Was getting destroyed on defense and can't do anything on offense.
Denzel Valentine 21 minutes  Dean Wade 34 minutes  That's the summary.
Dean Wade right?
"I keep thinking the announcer is saying D Wade, but he's actually saying Dean Wade."
"I'm pretty sure cavs have more than 5. Sexton, Garland, Okoro, Cedi, Windler, Mobley, Dean Wade are all drafted by Cavs"
His usage will go down because he will take fewer shots because Markkanen and Love take more shots than Dean Wade.
"His usage won't meaningfully change unless Rubio's minutes go down. Also, he's going to lose a few minutes whenever Love and Markkanen come back.  Also also, he's going to lose usage when its Love or Markkanen playing next to him instead of 10% usage Dean Wade."
I definitely think he needs to see more than 13 minutes.  I like Dean Wade but they ought to cut his minutes in half and throw em Windlers way.   Gotta see what he has. If that 3 pt shot plays he is rotational guy for the present and future
This is a view on YOUR team but I doubt you’d know the impact sexton has as a dude who’s comfortably averaged over 20ppg on high efficiency. As well as being without Love and Markkanen. Lol. We started fucking Dean Wade.
I saw dean wade and got instantly confused lol I was like I know d wade retired
"we're going to be playing Dean Wade, Mobley and Allen together at times, guaranteed."
Cleveland starting Dean Wade just beat the starting 5 of the 6 seed in the west last year.
“Drippy” Dean Wade
"No it's really not.  The missing piece is a real small forward.  We're playing Lauri Markkanen and Dean Wade out there.  The SexLand back court has hiccups, but is decidedly not the most important roster problem if it even is a problem."
"i LOVE stuff like this, thanks OP! JB is definitely still experimenting but his rotations have been weird. For the first couple games we only played 8 or 9 games, with Cedi, Lamar, Dean Wade and Windler getting limited/no minutes."
"fr what did cedi, dylan windler and dean wade do to not warrant minutes"
I mean what are you calling dean wade?
"Hawks went out and got Bogdonavic, Capela, Gallo, Lou Williams and they already had Collins, Hunter, and Huerter.  Cavs surround Sexton with Larry Nance and Dean Wade. Not a fair comp."
"For that game, our only active bigs were Nance, Allen, and Dean Wade. Of those three, Allen’s the only true center."
"No thanks, the Cavs need him healthy for next year. Y'all can have Dean Wade instead."
"Ideal?  PG: Cade Cunningham; Darius Garland; Matthew Dellavedova  SG: Steph Curry; Colin Sexton; Dylan Windler  SF: LeBron James; Isaac Okoro; Cedi Osman  PF: Larry Nance Jr; Dean Wade;   C: Jarrett Allen; Isaiah Hartenstein;  Definitely ECF, probably winning another ring"
"It'll be a team of L. Ball, D. Wade, B. Bowen, D. Robinson, and M. Plumlee  But it's actually LiAngelo Ball, Dean Wade, Brian Bowen, Duncan Robinson, and Marshall Plumlee"
"team USA is gonna be running a lineup of Dennis Smith Jr, Jerome Robinson, Jarret Culver, Dean Wade, and Tyler Zeller at this rate"
"Bol Bol, Jeremiah Robinson Earl, Dean Wade"
"more upside than LNJ? A defensive 4 who's improving his 3pt shot currently at 36% on over 3 a game, and averaged 1.7 steals a game which would put him in at top 5 in NBA if he was healthy?  A guy who looked like a potential All NBA defensive player?  More upside than that? Hell nah. Dean Wade? tempting but not Larry Nance Jr."
"I have a lot of affection for a lot of the players on the Cavs, but in my honest opinion, Sexton, Nance, and Allen are basically the only players on our roster that I would consider to be ""good"" right now.  Garland has a ton of potential and looked great at times last season, Okoro has a ton of potential, Dean Wade and Isaiah Hartenstein are lovable memes who sometimes do fun things on the court.  But those three are the only ones I think your average team would want as starters or sixth men as they are right now.  And of the three, the only really consistent one is Sexton.  Nance is consistently good when he's healthy, but he's not a stat sheet stuffer.  And Allen was kind of hot and cold all season."
"We already have that in Larry Nance Jr and Dean Wade who shoots 3s well and respectable defender and rebounder.  Trading a 24 point efficient scorer for another PF while we have decent power forwards behind an injury prone ass Kevin Love and soon, possibly Evan Mobley since Rockets are favored to get Green, is just dumb way to trade away good production."
"What is the meaning of ""Making teammates better""? The fact that Garland gets assists?  The Cavs' bench was awful. 2nd worst scoring, worst 3pt shooting in both percentage and made per game.  With the injuries that had put them into a pretty much tanking season, and the fact that with poor spacing, Sexton still gets an efficient 24 PPG while also being 12th in NBA in FTAs/game has to say something about his offensive bag and how poorly the FO is building the roster.  Sexton showed even flashes of playmaking when there was no Garland, no Delly, no Hart, no Larry Nance jr that are good passers.  He averaged 6 assists a game in month of may with only reliable 3pt shooting threat being a washed Kevin Love and Dean Wade who was a G-leaguer developed into a solid rotational piece.  It's gonna come down to how Altman will get talent around the Sexland duo and how JB Bickerstaff can take the next step to improving this team with the 3rd overall pick to get them to even more wins."
"Tyler Herro, Joe Harris, Kevin Huerter, Gordon Hayward, Kevin Love  TJ McConnell, Luke Kennard, Duncan Robinson, Dean Wade, Mason Plumlee  Alex Caruso, Grayson Allen, Garrison Matthews, Pat Connaughton, Cody Zeller"
Our sub celebrates all of our wins with a Cedi “W” flash card or some stupid ass Dean Wade bullshit
"- traded for Allen with a late Bucks 2022 first, that we got from trading George Hill   - traded future 2nds to reach into the first round and get KPJ (it's unfortunate what happened after but the pick itself was immensely quality value)   - in addition to the first-round picks I talked about, signing potential rotation players like Dean Wade and Dylan Windler who can space the floor and defend multiple positions   - making the most out of our ""assets"" (like a 36 year old Kyle Korver, George Hill, Javale McGee) and either creating future draft capital in the form of firsts or seconds   - so yeah, when a guy as good as lebron leaves, you're not gonna be good. instead of being salty at an organization you have paid no attention to, be grateful that your team jumped up in the lotto. Enjoy Suggs"
"Perfect:   Whoever we draft becomes a possible franchise cornerstone and wins ROY. Love accepts his role as a mentor, has a healthy season, his name is tossed around for 6th MOY, is at his best place mentally.  Okuro develops a decent jump shot, improves, either dean wade or windler become the next joe Harris, sexton or garland make ""the jump"", named all star, (like young/Lillard/Booker status ) lead cavs to a 6th seed and we lose in the second round against eventual NBA champs, the nets.   Realistic: our 3rd pick averages 11.9 ppg on &lt;40 Fg%, Sexton and garland both slightly improve but it's still unclear which one we build around (both?) and how green/suggs all fit in with the guard rotation. We pay Allen 4/86 with 4th yr player option. Media focuses on sexton's contract situation all year and it's not resolved. Love plays 60 games, averages 12/6.   Worst: Cavs overpay on sexton and Allen, giving them 30+ mil/yr contracts, draft suggs who is a defensive sieve and looks awful, Kevin Porter Jr wins MIP, averages 22/3/5. Love plays 40-55 games averages 7.8ppg."
"Christian Wood has a 7’2/7’3 wingspan, is lean (can run) and can impact the game rim to rim.   Dean Wade is more in the mold of an offensive threat only."
"Yeah! That would actually be a superstar, not the faux stars they claim of being. Separately they are being outplayed by the likes of Dean Wade and Thybulle respectively"
"Y'all can have him he isn't helping the Cavs at all. Dean Wade is even more valuable than him at this point. But it's all about making salaries match up, that and picks"
I’ll throw in a complimentary dean wade for your troubles
"I see your point. They could spread em out easily to fill up those minutes but I'm concerned about the vast pf/c depth y'all got. Even if we assume Love plays 0 minutes, you'll still have to slot in Dean Wade, hartenstein, Davis, and maybe Tacko. Do you guys still have Thon Maker too?"
Have you heard of our boy Dean Wade currently on the Cavs? He’s actually one of our better players
"&gt;My guess is that Sexton can be frustrating to play with because he’s a combo guard on a team that can’t score and his first instinct is to get buckets.  He's the best scorer on the team, by far. What's he supposed to do, defer to Cedi Osman? Clear out so Dean Wade can iso?  This is like a mini-version of when people were criticizing Kobe for not passing to Smush Parker and Kwame Brown enough, or acting like Iverson should've given up shots to George Lynch and Tyrone Hill.  Sexton should be looking to get buckets, because someone's gotta score if they're gonna win a game once in a while. In Sexton's 62 games last season, he averaged 29 pts on 19 FGA when they won, and 22 pts on 16.5 FGA when they lost."
"Somewhat. Early last season for the Cavs the ball was moving really well, even if he wasn't getting assists the ball wasn't sticking in his hands. Then the injuries started to pile up and Sexton started to hold onto the ball more. It was great when in games like against Brooklyn, but a lot of the time it could be frustrating. But it's hard to blame him when the next best option behind Garland was Cedi, Dean Wade, and Damyean Dotson"
"Players averaging exactly 9.7 assists per 100 possessions this preseason: Scottie Barnes, Dean Wade, Shake Milton, and Juan Toscano-Anderson."

Yeah Cavs have gone through some interesting times but Scoochie killed it in Summer league so I really hoped he’d be out meme player for end of games   Dean Wade is also really fun to put in vs Miami for the memes too
"I guess we’d protect Sexton, Garland, Okoro, Allen, Nance, Hartenstein, Dean Wade, and Lamar Stevens. Have fun with Cedi and Kevin Love!"
Cavs have had 2 DWades on our team since Dwyane’s adventure around the Eastern conference lead him to joining up with bron for half a season. Dean Wade still the GOAT Cavs DWade tho
"sure! there's JJ Redick, Joe Harris, uh...  *checks nba.com*  Grayson Allen, Arcidiacono, Alex Caruso, Zach Collins, DiVincenzo, Ellenson, Eubanks, Kyle Guy, Hayward, Herro, Huerter, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Luke Kennard, Luke Kornet, Jake Layman, Meyers Leonard, Garrison Matthews, Dakota Mathias, TJ McConnell, Sean and Doug McDermott, Sam Merrill, Mike Muscala, Mason Plumlee, Payton Pritchard, Duncan Robinson, Matt Thomas, Dean Wade, Dylan Windler, and Cody Zeller."
"Dean Wade hasn't even hit his peak yet, all 29 other team should be scared right now..."
"I mostly follow the Cavs subreddit, and I think they genuinely love Cedi, Dean Wade, Dellavedova. There's a meme that's just a picture of Cedi holding a book that says, ""W."""
"I mean, Sexton/Garland/Allen are the best thing we got going for us right now.  There are bigger problems with the Cavs and reasons why we aren't anywhere near playoff contention:  1. We are still paying KLove to sit on the bench. If he can play and put up 60% of what he used to be worth, the Cavs are so much stronger already. 2. Our extended rotation is a meme. We have Dotson and Dean Wade taking significant minutes and even starting games. Kabengele is ok as a backup bigman but we need stronger reserves that can impact the game. 3. Okoro is still very raw, but has a lot of upside. If he figures out his role like Garland started to, he has more upside than Cedi (which I love but he's an average wing at best)  All being said, the Cavs start to the season has shown there is potentian in this team but the core is still shaky, very young and inexperienced. I think this season has been a step forward tho. Getting rid of Drummond was a great move for us. Garland has shown improvement. Getting Allen was been a big plus for the team as we lacked a reliable big for a long time.  On the bad side, I think the team relies too much on Sexton to have the ball and take shots instead of running smart plays (this could mean we are due a coaching upgrade), Okoro still needs to develop and I'm not sure Love is willing to play with this squad. But I am very optimistic about the future. Go Cavs!"
What about Lamar Stevens and Dean Wade?

smh Dean Wade is always a no show when the lights are on the brightest
why was i expecting dean wade
guy on deepest team in the league has a better +- than a guy who’s best wing is Cedi Osman and Dean Wade    sextons shots go in the basket more often than murray’s
"Like u/sercialinho said, Wade is Dean Wade, a PF out of Kansas State."
My mind is fucked I had to read it twice I thought it said Dean Wade at first 😂😂
I would definitely say that Dean Wade is the most atheist player in the league
"I think the Cavs will be a pleasant surprise.   - Jarrett Allen bout to have monster year n make Brooklyn regret doggin him out  - they got tons of young talent wth sexton, okoro, garland, mobley,   - solid depth with dude like osman, rubio and Dean Wade could b good plus Nance who may be one of the best bench players in the league   - pretty chill coach in bickerstaff  - and who knows, Kevin Love may have a resurrection   Go Cavs!!!!"
"Going with my intense bias that the Cavs will surprise this year. Garland, Okoro, and Allen all take massive jumps.  Sexton sexes, Mobley holds his own, and Dean Wade becomes the best Dwade to play the game of basketball."
"As a Kansan, I'm here for the Dean Wade love train. But also you're crazy."
Evan Mobley  Larry Nance Jr.  Kevin Love  Dean Wade  Mfiondu Kabengele
"It would be LeBron, Dean Wade (D-Wade), Cameron Payne (CP), and LaMelo Ball (Melo)."
Dean Wade Gotta Step Up 😤😤
"The list of players that scored 24+ ppg under the age of 23 is pretty small and includes names like Trae, Luka, LeBron, Melo, KD, etc.  I mean his TS% is .571 which is above league average too.  Honestly he'd be a great fit on the Knicks with Thibs playing the pre-injury Rose role.  He still needs to improve his vision/predictions to be at Rose's level but the style is there.  It was really evident in the last month of the season with Garland out and he did just that and averaged around 24/6 with the rest of the roster being like Okoro/Osman/Dean Wade/Allen.  Unfortunately the only thing the Cavs would want from the Knicks is RJ so unless the Knicks had a replacement SG that aint gonna happen."
Dean wade
"The Cavs are unlikely to trade for Siakam.  We have a logjam of bigs, specifically power forwards (Larry Nance Jr., Kevin Love, &amp; Dean Wade).  If anything, a sign &amp; trade for Garry Trent Jr. could be on the cards.  He's a tad undersized for the 3, but, like I said, we're in dire need of wings.  Garland-Sexton-Okoro-Mobley-Hartenstein, with Rubio, Trent Jr., &amp; Nance Jr. off the bench to round out an 8-man rotation could compete for the play-in tournament.  Not lofty goals by any means, but realistic for the current iteration of the team."
Nance-Rubio-cedi-Love-Dean wade off of the bench  Honestly not bad considering the oldest person in the starting lineup is 23 lol definitely excited for the future of this team
Nice try Philly.  You're not getting Dean Wade.
Why build around Shai when you can potentially build around Dean Wade
Good. Now do Dwyane Wade and Dean Wade
Larry Nance Junior - hometown hero  Dean Wade - the GOAT DWade of the NBA. His number is “32” and he is the second DWade (player who always wore 3). Most looked forward moment when we play Miami when we put him in
Dean Wade?
They don’t call him “James” Dean Wade for nothing.
Don’t sleep on Dean Wade.
Idk man Dean Wade is pretty sick
tbf in his prime Monta was better than Dean Wade
"Dean wade tweeted Giannis praise lol, narratives are powerful, no one dislikes Giannis"
why have andrew nicholson and dean wade remained silence about giannis' greatness???
&gt; like when someone uses DW for a player on the Cavs and you have to figure out if its Dylan Windler or Dean Wade  No offense bro but NO ONE who is not a Cavs fan wonders if DW stands for any of those players... At best we'd think it's referring for Dawayne Wade for some reason even though he's retired.
"I mean I have friends with it, so I recognize it. I started noticing that they use the acronym on the commercials for treating it, as well. So I guess its a little bit more widely known then like when someone uses DW for a player on the Cavs and you have to figure out if its Dylan Windler or Dean Wade"
Damn Dean Wade can’t crack the starting lineup and they only have five players
Dean Wade then
We've been missing three of our starters for most of the season.  Like half of our rotation was injured at one point and we were playing Lamar Stevens and Dean Wade 20 minutes per game.  We were running McGee/Maker/Drummond lineups lol.
"29th ranked offense didn't have Sexton, Garland, Windler, Prince, Allen, and Love but he's still missing. Bickerstaff was forced to play Dotson and Cedi at point and Dean Wade, Marques Bolden, Thon Maker, and Lamar Stevens had to play more minutes than they're supposed to. I'd be surprised if you know who those players are aside from Thon."
"A ""huge fan of the Cavs"" would know they're scoring dropped off once they lost Garland, Love, Windler, Sexton, Porter, Okoro, etc multiple games and Drummond for a game. To play heavy minutes to guys like Dean Wade, Stephenson, Thon Maker and a guy named Bolden.   The talent is there, especially when the defense is applying pressure and they are knocking down shots."
One time I got a girls number after I randomly said there’s a player named Dean Wade
Which depth though? Cedi? Or Dean Wade? “Depth” is really unspecific
"Dean Wade because every time I read ""D. Wade"" on a roster while looking up scores I get confused for half a second"
Dean Wade on the Cavs?
"We got Drummond last year for cheap and now we'll probably trade him to some center needy team. Javale was brought in for one year to play backup after TT left, he might also get traded. Love is definitely a PF and Larry Nance is his backup, although now starting because of Love's injury, playing really well too. In any ideal situation Dean Wade and Bolden wouldn't get minutes but Love is hurt and Andre just missed a game. Jarrett was brought in to be our C if the future as he is 22 and we will likely be without both of our Cs next year."
"Yeah but there's Love, Drummond, McGee, Maker, Dean Wade, and now Allen. Granted that Love plays PF mostly but yeah definitely tall ball."
"Damn not bad, Dean Wade is having a pretty good season for the cavs too"
THE Dean Wade?? I'm in.
Dean Wade
"if the league wants to take a break for a week, we'd really appreciate that.  a lineup of Yogi Ferrell, Damyean Dotson, Lamar Stevens, Dean Wade and Javale Mcgee sharing the floor in the first quarter is a thing of nightmares."
"If you played 2k20 MyTeam, you know who Dean Wade is."
He asked about DEAN Wade. Fuck Dan and his bitchass.

Thats Cavs legend Dean Wade for ya.
Dean Wade has actually been there for a couple years now
We got a few on the Cavs:  Scoochie Smith (all time top preseason player name)  Damyean Dotson  DWade ( Dean Wade )  Cedi Osman  Lamar Stevens  Iaasac Okoro   There’s honestly more but these are just a few who come to mind
2k legend Dean Wade
"Dean Wade was a beast at Kansas State when he was healthy. Really happy to see him catching on in the NBA, hope he puts together a nice career."
Anyone who played MyTeam last year knows exactly who the GOAT Dean Wade is.
"Wasn’t Dean Wade hurt for much of that run to the Elite Eight? That’s where I’m honestly shocked that Weber took them that far. He’s not a good coach, but somehow he took K-State to the Elite Eight without their best player for much of that time."
"Ugh Dean Wade is just the worst isn't he, I know"
Of course. Amethyst Dean Wade was one of my favorite cards last year he dropped like 25 per game when I played the crapfest that was unlimited. Never would have found him if it wasn’t for DBG
The 2k myteam legend Dean wade
"Dean ""the only reason Bruce Webber kept his job"" Wade"
"That's Big12 Champion, Dean Wade."
That’s K-State legend Dean Wade!

"Okoro is a monster and if he develops his raw offense, he could easily be an all-star some day. Sexton's offense is really really good and he has all the right attitude. Garland's playmaking is elite for his age and he is really turning into something special.   Mobley hasn't even played, yet, but there's a lot of potential and his style, size, and abilities align with the nba's future.   Jarrett Allen is Jarrett Allen, you know who he is and how valuable he is.   Lauri has the opportunity to turn his career around and get back on his all-star trajectory that he had early on.   And then there's the surprise sleeper, Dean Wade. Dude can actually shoot and play both sides of the floor. With some further development on his defense, some more faith in minutes, he can be a great role player for the future."
"Matisse Thybulle, Dean Wade"
Dean Wade on steroids is indeed a scary proposition.
dean wade
"Dean Wade on the Cavs. He is a streaky but overall good 3pt shooter, and can play decent to average help defense. He normally plays the 3 or 4 spot but since we are deep in the pf position he will play a lot less this year if he isn't fast enough as a sf."
Dean Wade SZN
"With PFs Stevens, Kabengele, and Dean Wade off the bench"
i truly forgot dean wade existed
"With PFs Stevens, Kabengele, and Dean Wade off the bench"
Matt Mooney  Malik Newman  J.P Macura  Marques Bolden  Ante Žižić  Tyler Cook  Dean Wade  Sir'Dominic Denzel Pointer  ————————  All of these players were on the same roster. Guess the team and year
"Mobley, Allen and Markannen are the 3 bigs on the roster that matter. Love is stuck here.   Hartenstein is a free agent. Dean Wade is 3 and d 4/3. Kabengele is barely on the roster. Stevens is a combo forward. They’re all guys that the Cavs have found that can kind of play and I think the Cavs are hoping they can develop them in to legit rotation guys.   It’s really not that confusing."
"1. the cavs currently have players like isaiah hartenstein, jeremiah martin, lamar stevens, brodric thomas, dean wade, and dylan windler on the roster. Cutting one of them is completely free and wouldn't cost first rounders. (I might've made up one of those names, you wouldn't be able to tell.)  2. You are not getting assets for kevin love, you are giving up assets to give up kevin love.  3. Better fitting pieces as in other teams crap they throw in to match salary? Again look at #2 Kevin love is a negative value, you will give not get anything worthwhile.  I'd also like to add the cavs are not over the luxury tax, they are not competing this year or the next, and that sending kevin love home for the season ala Al Horford on OKC would accomplish the same thing as your hare brained scheme and not cost them picks/actual contributing players to their future."
"Honestly he’s not a bad fit. Right now we’ve got a three big rotation of Allen, Mobley, and Markannen, all of whom can play well together. This is assuming Love doesn’t see the floor, and Dean Wade just gets spot minutes."
"this is a PF for PF trade, but not counting Love (and why would you) - three.  Mobley and Lauri (who will rotate with Allen as the 3big rotation going forward) and Dean Wade."
"Two things.   Dean Wade who I thought was very good last year, will also get at least 10-15 mpg in that 4-5 rotation next year. He was at 20 last year and probably should have played a bit more honestly.   I also think Cleveland will find Mobley closing lots of games at the 5. Very few teams are closing games with two 7 footers out there and I think Mobley has the offensive and defensive game to play small ball 5. Just think those factors plus Lauri cut into Allen, although I like him."
"They did run something like that against us one game. Maker, Dean Wade, Drummond, JaVale, and Nance due to guard injuries"
