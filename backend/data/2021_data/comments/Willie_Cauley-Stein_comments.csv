Willie Cauley Stein might get a 20/20 on Thursday if Looney doesn't play.
You should wait until you have been able to take the time to watch each team play a few times before making this big of a list for the season. Having James Johnson above Maxi Kleber and Willie Cauley-Stein above Trey Burke is unfathomable as a Mavs fan.
"Damn, is this what it’s like to be hated on by rNBA? I know not everyone can keep up with every team but context matters.   We’ve had some combination of our 2nd-6th best players, including our 3 best defenders, out for the past 10ish games, which happened to be what everyone pegged as the hardest stretch of the season even before Covid hit us. We are maybe the hardest hit team by Covid to not get any (sans 1 I think) games postponed. Several of our guys were legitimately sick and are just now starting to look like their legs are back under them. It would have been nice to have the last two weeks off to recover instead slogging our way through a meat grinder of a month but it didn’t work out that way. Our best 3 point shooter and defender only just came back tonight. I mean we’ve been starting Wes Iwundu, Willie Cauley-Stein, and Josh Green most of these games. Yeah Kristaps has started slow like usual and we still could have performed better in January but I’m not gonna throw in the towel after losing to a good Suns team on the first night all season all of our starters actually played together. This isn’t a “fall from grace”. They’ll figure it out."
"Our bigs can't rebound - even if they're uncontested. I have 0 faith that a rotation of Boban, KP, Maxi, Willie Cauley Stein, and Dwight Powell could get more than 20 rebounds altogether on a consistent basis."

"To be fair, Willie cauley Stein alone lost the mavs like 5 games"
There was like 20 good centers available in Free Agency and y'all picked Willie Cauley-Stein. Your front office have made terrible moves considering this was the year you were going to move into Championship contention.
Warriors legend and 1st Sergeant-Lieutenant- Quarter Star General Tank Commander of the 2nd battalion Willie Cauley Stein
• Willie Cauley-Stein
Um are you Willie Cauley-Stein?
"We can all agree that the best ability is availability most of the time. But Kristaps isn't really in a position where he is asked to be a regular 1st option. He has looked bad because he is coming off of yet another injury and because the Mavs are all injured or out for various reasons. It has been, as some guy on here put it, Luka, THJ and sometimes Kristaps + 3rd stringers. Kristaps definitely needs a solid team construction to work to his advantages but he is coming off an injury with Willie Cauley Stein getting starter minutes alongside him. Kristaps is not a superstar, though, but he is definitely an all star level player when he is at his regular level with the Dallas Mavericks."
"While he hasn't been hyped like most of the other players mentioned in this thread I'm going with Willie Cauley-Stein. Insanely gifted athletically, has shown occasional glimpses of what he's capable of but seems visibly disinterested, especially on defense. He's given interviews that indicated he's more concerned with his other hobbies."
better than willie cauley stein who is like 75% on dunk attempts
2 words  willie cauley stein
Giannis is just Willie Cauley-Stein with handles
&gt; ‎Willie Cauley-Stein  He seems to be getting good minutes in Dallas tho
"I was concerned about Wiggins' effort and BBIQ before he got here because of our experience with ‎Willie Cauley-Stein last year, when everything Kings fans had warned us about WCS turned out to be true. I don't know if it's from better fit, Draymond's influence, the Warriors org and coaching, or just Wiggs maturing, but he's busted ass for us and seems to be relishing that two-way role here. With his effort, coachability and wingspan I expect he'll continue to improve on D for quite a while."
"Yup, because TS truly encapsulates a player's worth. Why do we even need scouts anymore when we have bball reference? Luka has had all the spacing in the world to help increase his TS the past 5 games, with superstar talents in the starting lineup like Rookie Josh Green, end of bench piece Wes Iwundu, vet min Willie Cauley Stein, and injured Tim Hardaway with the recent addition of rehabbed Kristaps Porzingis!"
I can't believe I'm saying this.  I miss Powell....if I have to see Willie Cauley-Stein miss one more fucking dunk I'm going to lose it....
When Willie Cauley-Stein will end his NBA career he wil hold record of most mised dunks ever...
Willie Cauley-Stein
"Lol Willie cauley stein ""third most popular center in Dallas """
"Did you not watch the Nets Knicks game last Wednesday? DJ sonned Mitch (whose way better than Noel and a quality Center) and then Reggie Perry outplayed Noel... In what world is Noel better than DJ. Actual basketball reasons please.  Also if Noel was solid at all he'd be on a solid contract for a contender considering his age and how cheap he is. However, literally no team wanted him. The Mavs went with Willie Cauley Stein whose a massive head case over re-signing Noel."
Like Willie Cauley-Stein?  It all makes sense now!
"Sooooooooooooooooooo....  If Samuel Dalembert is Pizza Hands, what is Willie Cauley-Stein?"

they really cant find someone better than willie cauley stein？
KAT and Willie Cauley Stein
"big Middleton shots, lack of DFS and Kleber hurt Dal tonight with the lack of wing defender options  Willie Cauley Stein is hilarious, he gave too much respect to Giannis's shot all night playing up on him allowing for driving lanes and then the one time he shouldve actually gotten up on Giannis on that 3 Giannis hit at the end of the clock he lays off."
"Willie Cauley-Stein, Malik Monk, Immanuel Quickley, Jarred Vanderbilt..."
The only 20/20 5x5 in NBA history? Jusuf Nurkic courtesy of the Kings... thanks Willie Cauley Stein!

willie cauley stein is the biggest bum in the NBA by far
WSC made me think Willie Cauley-Stein but I had no clue what dude was talking about.
"&gt;what the hell happened to Bagley?  You answered your own question  &gt;but doesn't seem to have progressed at all  He really hasn't. At least not much. He goes left, 100% of the time. He's a defensive liability and has tunnel vision once he gets to the paint. He'll have a decent 20/10 game from time to time when it comes to box score. But doesn't play winning basketball.  Kid has all the tools and natural gifts. But he doesn't ""get"" the game yet. And I'm salty because it reminds me of Willie Cauley-Stein, who I watched for years never make the next step despite ungodly athleticism."
"Whoa. To quote Marv Albert, that was an egregious foul by willie cauley Stein"
"Surprising:  willie cauley stein. I thought he would not be a factor in the rotation, but seems Mavs actually play better with him on the floor. Happy for him.  Disappointing:  josh richardson. He's not bad, but i hope he can become even better in the games to come. Maybe also a bit more consistent on offense."
Willie Cauley Stein held him down the 1st half but then Jokic went Super Saiyan the 2nd half.

"It was so funny tonight (other than the Mavs winning, for me). They just kept putting different defenders on him and he just kept hitting in the 4th. Cauley-Stein? Nope, bring in Boban. Shit ok too slow, try kleber. Nope hit over him.  Finney Smith for no reason? Plow right through, foul. Back to willie? Tied at the buzzer.  Congrats on the win tho!"
But Willie Cauley Stein...
Shaq can’t guard me and neither can Willie Cauley-Stein
"Top 6 for the Mavs is very easy.  1. Luka  2. Porzingis 3. J-Rich 4. Tim Hardaway Jr. 5. Maxi Kleber 6. Dorian Finney-Smith  7 is difficult, because it really comes down to how you build out the rest of the roster. It's Jalen Brunson, Trey Burke, Willie Cauley-Stein, James Johnson, Boban, or Dwight Powell."
Willie Cauley-Stein. He's well known for being a disappointment.
Willie Cauley-Stein
You wanna type out Willie Cauley-Stein every time you wanna talk about him? Why should you put more effort into saying his name than he puts into basketball?
Willie Cauley-Stein
"dude you type out Willie Cauley-Stein every single time  he's WCS, cope"
Willie Cauley Stein
Sebastian Telfair  Frank Ntilikina  Julius Randle  Harrison Barnes  Nicolas Batum  Willie Cauley-Stein  Jake Layman  Darius Miles  Gary Harris  Gordon Hayward  Kelly Oubre  Jordan Clarkson
Willie cauley Stein. That one's honestly pretty easy lol
"Luka KP Jalen Brunson Tim Hardaway JR  Maxi Kleber Dorian Finny Smith Willie Cauley Stein Trey Burke  Tough leaving Boban off the list, but these are definitely the 8 most important Mavs. Not sure anyone from our team would be taken tbh. Richardson, James Johnson, Powell, and Iwundu have been underwhelming and we haven't seen much of anything from our rookies yet"
You could put willie cauley stein on the 60s Celtics and they probably get 12
"&gt; His major problem was that he had practically no offensive game whatsoever, and scouts assumed he could learn one after he was drafted.  And then when he didn't, they turned around and assumed the same things about Willie Cauley-Stein and Mo Bamba."
"more Theis to Dallas if we're hypothetically giving up KP  a big rotation of Collins, Kleber, the ghost of Dwight Powell, and Willie Cauley Stein probably isn't cutting it"
"We went 3-9 between Jan 13th and Feb 1st. 5 of our guys got sat for covid or contact tracing on Jan 12th, they came back on the 27th, and spent the next week trying to play themselves back into shape.  Luka carried us so fucking hard, but you just can't do it when you're starting next to Willie Cauley-Stein, Wes Iwundu, and Josh Green. Coincided with the media pile-on about his whining, and 3pt shooting woes. I'm glad it's not January anymore."
"prime lebron would have carried those teams to the playoffs. where the fuck were you in 2012 and 2013? lebron would have carried ME to the playoffs. those were actual nba players.   rudy gay, rondo, darren collison, omri casspi, marco bellinelli, seth curry, ben mclemore, willie cauley-stein. those are all functional nba players who can dribble basketballs and tie their shoes. some of them are actually good at basketball. lebron might have gone to the finals with them. you're underrating how absurd he was in his prime. bro he used to jump with his head above the rim and play defense during the regular season and he was just as smart as he is now. it was fucking crazy"
Boban/Willie Cauley Stein front line lets go
"&gt; In 2018-19, Harden defended 212 post-ups, also 47% more than any other player (Willie Cauley-Stein defended 144).  How on earth is this true? How can a guard defend that many more than anyone else in the league?"
I read WCS as Willie Cauley-Stein at first lol
"I love Looney. He's not flashy or athletic, but he fights hard and is smart; always in the right position to pull down a rebound, or catch the lob, and fights tooth and nail for it. Also can hit those baseline jumpers pretty well when the defense is sleeping on him.  I remember in 2019, when we had fucking Willie Cauley-Stein starting over Looney at center, that was so frustrating. WCS seems like he should be the better player, but fuck, he's out of position every time and is constantly getting out rebounded by guys 6 inches shorter than him. I'm still mad about that, haha. Give me Looney; he's not the most physically gifted, but he makes the right play every time."
Now ask him how he feels about Willie Cauley-Stein
"Ignoring salaries and what you'd give up to get him, I'd take Drummond over Willie Cauley-Stein and Dwight Powell as long as Drummond is cool with his usage going way down."
"&gt;I'm not a guy who just started watching basketball, I've been watching 20+ years.   I appreciate that, and your username was a hint to that effect.  I still maintain that you are wrong.  &gt;There isn't nearly the amount of ""plugs"" in the nba now. You don't see low skilled 7 footers get any meaningful play time when just 10 years ago it wasnt uncommon and even more so 20 years ago.    There are different types of skill.  Playing defense and rebounding are skills, and the necessity of those two skills 20 years ago led to those players getting minutes -- because there were skilled seven footers on many teams that needed to be stopped.  That said, is Rudy Gobert more ""skilled"" than centers of twenty years ago?  What skills does Mitchell Robinson possess that were not commonplace twenty years ago?  What about DeAndre Jordan?  Alex Len?  Steven Adams?  Hassan Whiteside?  Andre Drummond?  Jarret Allen?  Mason Plumlee?  Enes Kanter?  Ivica Zubac?  Jakob Poeltl?  Robin Lopez?  Willie Cauley-Stein?    None of those players would have been at all remarkable for their skills at any point in NBA history.  The difference is that now you have a few teams like Toronto and Boston who don't play any traditional bigs, and who can get away with that because the skill level of bigs in today's game is generally way down from its historical level -- a few players like Embiid, and Jokic, aside."
"It can be both, yeah they’re at Disney world but I definitely don’t want to spend a few months locked in anywhere.  “How can you be depressed, you’re playing basketball all day!” Is a lot like “how can you be sad, you have a ton of money!”  It’s not totally the same, because the players are here at-will, and most of them (looking at you willie cauley Stein) probably love eating drinking and breathing basketball. But we still shouldn’t understate the effect it could have on their mental health. Hopefully all the guys are handling it as well as KD and Adams are at least pretending to"
"&gt;QUESTION: ""Why was a foul not called on Willie Cauley-Stein when he knocked Trae Young to the ground before the inbounds pass on Hawks' final possession?""  &gt;TIVEN: ""In the game the contact between Young and Cauley-Stein was deemed incidental and therefore we didn't have a whistle on the play. After reviewing the play postgame we still feel that a no-call was the correct decision.""  That's not even what the refs said.  🤡"
"The Hawks were down one with four seconds to go, on the inbound play Trae Young set a back screen on Willie Cauley-Stein. Trae fell to the ground. After seeing Gallinari miss the shot, Trae was furious with the refs that they didn’t call a foul. He argued it should’ve been a foul because he fell. The refs reviewed it and deemed it “incidental” and even told Trae they could’ve called *him* for an illegal screen.  After the game Cauley-Stein said *""I ain't even see Trae. He's a smart kid. He was trying to get a quick, little foul to shoot free throws and ice the game. No way they was going to give him that call for the game. Good try, though. That was smooth. It was sneaky.""* ([from espn](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30877811/late-no-call-leaves-trae-young-atlanta-hawks-fuming-1-point-loss-dallas-mavericks))  I think Willie is right and the refs were right not to call a foul there."
" QUESTION: *""Why was a foul not called on Willie  Cauley-Stein when he knocked Trae Young to the ground before the inbounds pass on Hawks' final possession?""*  TIVEN: *""In the game the contact between Young and Cauley-Stein was deemed incidental and therefore we didn't have a whistle on the play.

"""Not classy enough""  Why do you guys always go that route? You realize I'm defending Willie Cauley-Stein over Trae, right? Sorry you're so mad, buddy."
No missing 5-7 guys is not the same as missing 2. Dallas starting center for a lot of games was Willie Cauley Stein for gods sakes   According to on off numbers Convington is the best player on the Blazers. You see how that is probably not true?
"Does KG see something in Willie Cauley-Stein that the rest of us don't? Or is he just saying, Willie Cauley-Stein could use some help?  &gt; **I know that since retiring, you’ve trained a few younger players. Who do you see now and think you could help his game?** A lot of big men. James Wiseman. Joel Embiid. Jokic. Willie Cauley-Stein. Marvin Bagley up in Sacramento"
People just need to watch Willie Cauley-Stein to understand that catching lobs isn’t as easy as guys like DJ and Capela make it look. WCS messes up like half of the lobs he gets thrown
"Guy that I sat next to in freshman year biology was telling me that he guarded Willie Cauley-Stein in high school, went on to say it was the worst day of his life lol"
"No, that cap space was used to resign Dwight Powell who was a UFA and the remainder was to resign bird players DFS, Kleber, and Porzingis to operate over the cap. The trade exception created from Barnes was used for Delon Wright and later on Willie Cauley-Stein at the cost of three total 2nd picks.  Out current potential cap space is mostly due to Tim Hardaway expiring and Josh Richardson who was acquired from Seth Curry who we signed while over the cap."
"Trading Seth Curry is the reason we were losing. It doesn't matter that we were starting Wes Iwundu, Josh Green, and Willie Cauley-Stein."
"I wonder whether anyone has weighted covid absences by some measure of how important a player is. The Mavs were missing 3 starters for a few weeks that absolutely had a big impact, but we’ve also had Willie Cauley-Stein out recently which has upped our numbers but isn’t a very big loss for us."
"that isn't true, he scores [less than 1 putback a game](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/putbacks/?sort=POSS&amp;dir=1) and they account for about 16% of his total points. considering he makes nearly 2 3's a game at 37%, i don't agree that he's ""always the last guy on the floor"" that they'd want taking a shot, considering at times he's probably shared the court with offensive juggernauts like boban, dwight powell, willie cauley-stein and wes iwundu"
probably dwight powell and willie cauley stein
"It is crazy to me that someone is gonna waste 6th pick on Willie Cauley-Stein but aint gonna risk it with Pokusevski, MPJ sure his back were bad but draft highlights for WCS were him doing dunks in a break and put backs, he was deemed as defensive player with very limity offense. There really were not any flashes in wcs game so imo it is better to take these type of players from 15 to 30 spot. Or Michael Kidd-Gilchrist literally no upside on offense"
willie cauley-stein hustle plays? what bizarro universe is this
"""foul by the heavily tattooed arms of Willie Cauley-Stein"""
"&gt; This current team would be just as bad as last year  Lolllll it's hilarious how disingenuous you're being instead of making the actual argument that is there for Curry. Sad.      Players that started the most games for you last year:   Glenn Robinson 48 games, Draymond Green 43 games, Willie Cauley Stein 37 games, Damion Lee 36 games, DLO 33 games, Eric Paschall 26 games  DEFINITELY the same team. Andrew Wiggins and Kelly Oubre same as Glenn Robinson and WCS, no?  Not even considering that Draymond Green literally didn't try last year."
Cousins (the Kings' franchise center at the time) asking god for strength in after the Kings traded for Papagiannis (another center) is still an all-time hilarious tweet for me  And this was 1 year after the Kings had already used a lottery pick on Willie Cauley-Stein (*another* center)
"I’m a little surprised at all the players in committed relationships who have kids but aren’t getting married. There are two Mavericks (Dorian Finney-Smith, Willie Cauley-Stein) who recently had children with their girlfriends as well. I’m not criticizing their life choices, I’m just curious why you don’t get married at that point."
So y’all could have flipped him for Willie Cauley Stein?
Who's stopping Jokić over a seven game series? Willie Cauley-stein? Dwight Powell? Boban? Jokic would feast.   Nuggets at least have a few decent wing defenders in Aaron Gordon and Will Barton who can try to slow down Luka.   I think nuggets win this in five.

Willie Cauley Stein always looks like he just stumbled out of a crack den
"IIRC, they had their sights on George Karl, which didn’t sound terrible at the time, but he was just an awful coach for us. Him and Boogie hated each other  And Malone and boogie were great together. So they really pissed off our franchise player, combined with drafting another center in the lottery like that season or the one after  Sigh.. it could’ve been devin booker and instead we got willie fuckin Cauley stein"
"Willie ""Post Malone"" Cauley-Stein is still in the league?"
"Also from last night...  Willie Cauley-Stein: 23 minutes played, +/-  of +41  Kelly Oubre Jr.: 23 minutes played, +/- of -41"
"Drafting Willie Cauley Stein, while having arguably the best center in the league...make it make sense."
That's nba all-rookie 2nd team willie cauley-stein to you
Willie 6ix9ine Cauley-Stein
Willie Cauley-Stein has to have one of the worst hands in the nba lol
Noel was only a 4/70 when guys like Mozgov were getting 4/64. And yeah most athletic centers have weaknesses especially on offense usually lacking a post game or IQ. Some aren't even good enough to get consistent minutes like Willie Cauley-Stein or Jaxson Hayes.
Luka Doncic - 1 tech per game   Kristaps Porzingis - 1 surgery per season   Willie Cauley-Stein - 1 missed alley oop per games
Ratatouille Willie Cauley Stein
Have you ever see Willie Cauley-Stein play?  I'm not sure he enjoys playing basketball.
"Kings can't even competently tank. And when they did they picked Bagley.  They picked McLemore, Stauskas, Willie Cauley Stein, and Chriss in the top 10 in 4 straight drafts ffs."
Idiots on Reddit told me a Mavs team with Boban and Willie Cauley Stein at center was a good defensive team while Kawhi spent 6 straight games putting 2K numbers on them🤣 this is what GOOD defense looks like
"Definitely Carlisle’s fault they lost game 3 and game 7. G3 KP was playing like ass he should not have been closing. G7 he stuck with the Boban KP lineup for way too long while they were being out rebounded, letting up offensive rebounds, and weren’t gaining an advantage inside on offense. Not to mention he played Willie Cauley-Stein in multiple games for seemingly no reason."
"wdym he got brunson, hardaway jr,  and Willie cauley-stein!"
"Is Willie Cauley-Stein better option?     This is their best option to deal against small-ball Clippers.     Maybe Mavs should trade KP for Horford + Poku (or other young OKC player) - I havent' t  think over that yet, probably this is stupid idea"

"they were lmao, during the offseason they held their MLE till late but settled with willie cauley stein."
"Willie Cauley-Stein, been in the league for awhile and hopped around the league for a bit before dis year"
"Any team giving burn to Willie Cauley-Stein, let alone in the playoffs, is down bad"
Willie Cauley-Stein just a skinnier Andre Drummond with fewer clothes and even worse BBIQ
Willie Cauley-Stein is a bad physical guy. How irritating is that shit to see.
"our greatest hits include tyreke evans over curry,  jimmer over klay, mclemore over giannis, willie cauley stein over booker, the selection of georgios papagiannis in general, trading the 10th pick instead of getting mitchell or bam, and bagley over JJJ and trae 🔥🔥🔥"
"That ‘15 team with KAT,Booker and Willie Cauley Stein was definitely a choke job on his part. Especially after going undefeated the entire year"
Asking again cuz no one answered:   Is Willie Cauley Stein terrible at defense?
"There's three million people here, there's gonna be some idiot that thinks Willie Cauley-Stein is better than Embiid."
"It’s not tho. Porzingis was the best option the Knicks honestly could’ve gotten at the 4th pick. The picks after Porzingis were, in order, Mario hezonja, willie cauley stein, Emmanuel mudiay, Stanley johnson, frank kaminsky, and Justise Winslow. Porzingis, despite his problems, is still a significantly better player than all of those players. For it to be a cautionary tale, it has to be a bad pick or something the team regrets. I guarantee you the Knicks do not regret drafting Porzingis over someone like Emmanuel mudiay. Honestly this draft actually disproves your point. Jahlil okafor is the typical “big man” with typical “big man skills” contrary to Porzingis. However, jahlil okafor turned out to be way worse than Porzingis. A better point would honestly be that it’s a cautionary tale to not take typical big man over unicorn big men"
Terrence Mann x willie Cauley-stein
Willie Cauley Stein got to be the silliest looking player in the nba
Everytime i see Willie cauley stein face i remember that cursed tweet about that Kentucky team beating the '96 Bulls
how many times has Willie Cauley-Stein been abused on and off the court
Willie cauley stein would be a body modification artist if it weren't for the NBA
"Willie Cauley-Stein is a name I've heard for a while, but the bbref link is still blue. Until today!"
willie cauley stein lookin like a crackhead
"Yeah but he did that against Willie Cauley-Stein, so it doesn't count"
"We have two true centers in Boban and Willie Cauley-Stein. Neither are starting options, nor do they mesh super well with our starters. Dwight Powell is a roll man that cannot space the floor or defend, he's very limited, and Maxi Kleber is undersized as a center and is more of a PF who can play spot minutes at SF or C.   Porziņģis is a 4/5, more so a PF in the regular season and a Center in the playoffs. I think pairing him with a center who can switch out on the perimeter would be smart. Having Holmes if we could get him for $15M a year would be great. He'd be a roll threat for Luka, while KP can pop on the perimter or take his man off the dribble. He's a decent rebounder too. None of our bigs are starting caliber for a contender aside from Porziņģis and maybe Kleber."
Willie Cauley Stein had +41 with 6 points 5 rebounds and 2 blocks against the Warriors a few weeks ago when the Mavs blew them out
Richards looks like discount Willie Cauley-Stein
"Clippers fans don't realize how many important Mavs role players were missing in that series.  No Jalen Brunson, Dwight Powell or Willie Cauley Stein. KP missed half the series and Luka hurt his ankle in game 3.  That's like Kawhi turning his ankle, PG going down mid series, no Lou Will, No Zubac, no Trez for any game."
"Powell, KP, Maxi, Willie Cauley-Stein, even THJ and Dorian finney-smith"
Luka's targets:  1. Dwight Powell (27) 2. Willie Cauley-Stein (21) 3. Kristaps (14) 4. DFS (7) 5. Maxi (5) 6. Josh Green &amp; THJ (3) 7. Boban (1)
So I except Willie Cauley Stein and James Wiseman to just be these defensive monsters? What happened
Willie Cauley-Stein
"Draymond missed 20 games last year. They started Damion Lee and Willie Cauley Stein for more than half their games last year.   This year they added two other serviceable starters (Wiggins and Oubre), and had a tremendously better big man rotation (Wiseman and Looney).   They added a ton of talent to their roster, even if it wasn’t super high quality talent. They were obviously tanking last season. So to credit Curry with a 30%+ rise in win percentage is disingenuous."
Willie Cauley-Stein is not even close to as fast or as strong as Giannis.
Willie Cauley-Stein is also a freakishly fast and strong 7 footer lol this is such a stupid take at this point. People acting like touch around the rim and the footwork/awareness to navigate from the perimeter to the rim in 3 steps like Giannis does are just the result of his physical attributes and not deftness and skill are just looking for reasons to take away from his greatness
"The Kings have to start drafting well and Monte is the man to start doing that. Draft a big who can run with Fox sort of like how Willie Cauley-Stein did, but better all around of course. Buddy and Marvin are cancers and should be cut out before it spreads. Trade em for a proven Vet like Suns did CP3. Unleash Woodard. Resign Terrance Davis. Tyrese is a godsend but has big city dreams. If the Kings don't start finding a way into the playoffs now, then their players will take their talents elsewhere cause Sacramento is not a place where anyone would prefer to play lets keep it real. But winning cures all."
I wonder of that would change of he needed to play 33 minutes a night instead of 20. For me: Best Case: Bam Adebayo Probably: Jarrett Allen Worst Case: Willie Cauley-Stein  You are probably right re intensity though
Team Willie Cauley Stein?
"Boogie’s starting 5:  G: Rondo  G: Darren Collison  F: Rudy Gay   F: Omri Casspi  C: Cousins  Bench: Willie Cauley Stein, Ben McLemore, Quincy Acy  Westbrook’s rosters have ALWAYS been WAYYYYY better than that.   Westbrook had Oladipo, Sabonis, Jermai Grant, Taj Gibson, Steven Adams, and other great role players in the year he “dragged” them to the playoffs. Later had Paul George."
I'm trying to wonder who WCJ could be if not Willie Cauley Stein...jein..
Liked him on the Jazz. But also here is a list of #6 picks from all drafts that currently still have an active player:  Onyeka Okongwu  Jarrett Culver  Mo Bamba  Jonathan Isaac  Buddy Hield  Willie Cauley-Stein  Marcus Smart  Nerlens Noel  Damian Lillard  Jan Vesely  Ekpe Udoh  Jonny Flynn  Danilo Gallinari  Yi Jianlian  Brandon Roy  Martell Webster  Josh Childress  Chris Kaman  Dajuan Wagner
"Suns did this exact thing with Ayton and it turned out great for them. If they draft Luka, who knows what happens.  Generally I agree with you though. BPA &gt; fit, especially when you’ve been burned year after year in the draft taking players at positions you “need” and constantly passing up better players  How many 4/5s did the kings draft to pair with Cousins in the front court that just ended up sucking.. a lot. I still get mad when I see willie cauley stein"
"So you haven't noticed that he has been unable to create for himself on even low level and couldn't punish shorter defenders?  Maybe it slipped your all seeing eye that he was absolutely useless against the Clippers when defended more tightly?  He didn't even roll to the rim this season because he clearly wasn't confident in his body after meniscus tear.  Saying that he is better offensive option than anyone on the Hawks is laughable. This season he has been glorified role player on max contract and Mavs looked better when he was out and Willie Cauley Stein was a center in the starting line up.  You can't judge player by his stats, because they are obscuring details.  Shot creation is probably the most important offensive skill for a player and Porzingis is worthless at it.  And using offensive words in a debate is proof of failure and inability to defend your arguments."
"Sacramento has had 9 top-8 picks in the last 10 years. At some point it’s not the league’s fault, but the teams poor scouting and drafting.   Here’s a list of players the Kings missed drafting in the last 10 years:  2018:  Selected Marvin Bagley.  Missed: Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgeous Alexander  2016:  Selected Marquese Chriss.  Missed: Damontas Sabonis, Caris LeVert, Pascal Siakam, Dejounte Murray  2015:  Selected Willie Cauley-Stein.  Missed: Devon Booker, Myles Turner, Terry Rozier,  2014:  Selected Nick Stauskas  Missed: Elfrid Payton, TJ Warren, Clint Capella, Bogdon Bogdonovic, Joe Harris, Nikola Jokic  At some point, there’s a reason why the teams have sucked for 20 years. The Kings have had 15 years worth of lottery picks, with only one or two nice pieces to show for it"
"The Cauley-Stein pick is defensible. As gifted as Cousins was, he was a liability on defense, so the belief was that he needed to be paired with a rim protector. Cousins could shoot from the perimeter, and Willie was supposed to be able to guard 1 - 5. The fans and media largely praised the pick.  The Papagiannis pick was super dumb."
"Nope. The lottery and the NBA for that matter is a lot like life.  It’s not fair.   When we start creating rules to allow for equal outcome rather than equal opportunity, we are opening up a can of worms that we wouldn’t be able to come back from.   You want to complain about the system? How about complain about the front offices of the Kings and Magic that can’t build a winning team after many years of top 10 picks.   It’s not the Cavs/Raptors fault that the Kings drafted Marvin Bagley, Marquese Chriss, Willie Cauley-Stein, Nik Stauskas, Ben McLemore and Thomas Robinson with top 10 picks in the recent years.  It’s also not their fault that the Magic selected Mo Bamba, Mario Hezonja and a bunch of good but not great players for them like Jonathon Issac, Aaron Gordon and Victor Oladipo all in the top 10."
"I'm assuming you're a Mavs fan, so:   Offseason focus  An alignment between the front office and new head coach  The blank check approach with Luka Doncic: eligible for $200M rookie extension  Finding help for Doncic: projected $20-$35M in cap space but at the cost of Tim Hardaway Jr. and possibly Josh Richardson  The extension options for Jalen Brunson  Year 3 of Kristaps Porzingis ($90M+ left on his contract)  Draft assets  Future: The Mavericks owe New York a top-10 protected first in 2023, 2024 or 2025. The earliest that Dallas can trade a first is two years after the pick to New York is conveyed.  Cash: $4.5 million (to send) | $5.6 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  With Doncic in the last year of this rookie-scale contract, the 2021 offseason presents an opportunity for Dallas to maximize cap flexibility. By releasing the cap holds of free agents James Johnson and Hardaway, Dallas projects to have $20 million in cap space. If Richardson opts out of his $11.6 million contract and the $4.1 million team option of Willie Cauley-Stein is not exercised, the Mavericks could have up to $33.5 million. Richardson has until Aug. 1 to make a decision on whether to pick up his deal, and the Mavericks face the same Aug. 1 deadline on Cauley-Stein's team option. Additionally, the $1.8 million contract of Brunson becomes guaranteed if he is not waived by Aug. 2.  Because the cap in 2022-23 is projected to increase slightly ($112 million to $115 million), the Mavericks will have $22 million if they punt on free agency this offseason and Doncic is extended.  Porzingis and Trey Burke both have trade bonuses written into their contract. Porzingis' 5% trade kicker would get voided because it exceeds the maximum salary allowed. The Burke trade bonus is 7.5% of the value remaining on his contract (minus the player option in 2022-23).  Team needs  Shooting guard if Hardaway leaves in free agency  Wing defender off the bench  A power forward to compliment Porzingis  Extension eligible: Doncic (rookie), Brunson, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber  Free-agent status  Richardson | Player | Bird  JJ Redick | Early Bird  Hardaway | Bird  Boban Marjanovic | Early Bird  Cauley-Stein | Team | Early Bird  Nicolo Melli | Restricted | Early Bird"
Kings First Pick past decade  2020 Pick 12 - Tyrese Haliburton  2019 Pick 40 - Justin James  2018 Pick 2 - Marvin Bagley  2017 Pick 5 - De'Aaron Fox  2016 Pick 8 - Marquese Chriss  2015 Pick 6 - Willie Cauley-Stein  2014 Pick 8 - Nik Stauskas  2013 Pick 7 - Ben McLemore  2012 Pick 5 - Thomas Robinson  2011 Pick 7 - Bismack Biyombo
"OK, let me give you some hypothetical trades to illustrate my point.   1. Who says no to a trade where Miami gives Goran Dragic and Andre Iguodala in exchange for Ben Simmons? Dragic and Iguodala both have team options, so Miami could pick them up and trade them to Philly and the Sixers would get two pretty old players on expiring contracts and just get off of Simmons' salary. Are you telling me Miami says no to that?  2. The Sixers ask the Knicks to trade them Kevin Knox for Ben Simmons. This works because the Knicks have the cap space to absorb Simmons contract, even though Knox is only on a $5 million deal. Are you telling me the Knicks turn that down?  3. The Sixers offer Ben Simmons to Dallas for Willie Cauley Stein. Same as the Knicks trade, WCS only makes $5 million, but Dallas has the cap space to absorb Simmons contract. Does Dallas say no?  Clearly these are all trades where Philly is far, far more likely to say no than the other teams are. You're delusional if you think Miami, the Knicks or Dallas tells Philly they also need to include a 1st round pick or two before agreeing to those trades."
Ik its hard to redraft this many players but Cameron Payne below Frank Kaminsky and Willie Cauley Stein? Really bro?
Better than Willie Cauley-Stein

"Went to high school with Shavon, didn’t know he was playing that well over there. So crazy a team with him and Willie Cauley-Stein didn’t win state."
"Nurk had a great game and that’s for sure. I don’t say this to take anything away from him. *A lot* of bigs destroyed Willie Cauley-Stein that year, and the next year, and …"
Same with Willie Cauley-Stein
"i think they mean Willie Cauley-Stein, i’ve never seen someone just call him Stein lol"
you mean willie cauley stein
"Luka (duh), Brunson, Hardaway, Finney-Smith, Willie Cauley-Stein surprisingly, and Sterling Brown if he continues what he did in Houston  I would put Kleber on here if it wasn’t for covid and nagging injury issues affecting his defense last season, because his shooting was the best it’s ever been."
"Willie Cauley-Stein.  I thought he was going to be a better version of DeAndre Jordan.  Instead, he was a worse Javale MacGee"
That won't get confusing with willie cauley stein or WCS
Willie Stein-Cauley
"Frank Kaminsky would also go to your college and completely destroy them. Grant Williams had 300 ways of scoring in the paint in college. Olynyk, Willie Cauley-Stein, Jahlil Okafor, Marvin Bagley…  The college frontcourt just doesn’t project well into the NBA.   It’s better for guys like Olynyk who don’t get drafted with late-playoff starter expectations (the Hornets took 22 year old Kaminsky in the high lottery, which looked pretty similar at the time to how it looks now), because a lot of the players I just named actually can compete as 8th man high-scoring centers, but just aren’t athletic enough for NBA rim protection. Garza can be something good, but it’s not because he’s an excellent college player, all the excellent 22 year old college bigs that find a role in the NBA have to change a lot and rise to the challenge of low-volume efficiency."

"Exactly. MPJ is an elite play finisher, but Murray is way ahead of him in other aspects of the game like playmaking.   MPJ had one of the worst assist percentages in the league last year at 5.2%, good for 487th in the league.  For reference, the two players immediately ahead of him are Willie Cauley-Stein and Taj Gibson, and those right below him are Lauri Markkanen and Daniel Gafford.  To compare, before the injury Murray was 111th at 19.7%. Other similar shotmaking wings also rank a lot higher, like Tatum (113th, 19.6%), PG13 (67th, 23.9%), Brandon Ingram (87th, 21.8%).  On top of that, 79.2% of his made shots were assisted on. Other elite wings can create for themselves much more reliably, which is a huge part of being a top option.   To compare again: Murray (41.8%), Tatum (40.8%), PG13 (42.9%), Ingram (48.5%)  He's gonna be elite as a shotmaker, but to really be a 1B type guy he needs to make some big, big strides in other areas of his game, like playmaking and creating his own shot vs. it being created for him."
"When he played for UK, every game the announcers brought up the fact Willie Cauley-Stein was a receiver in high school"
Don't forget Willie Cauley-Stein!
"I looked him up.  Undrafted in 2016. Played some summer leagues, got waived from the Charlotte Hornets in Preseason.  I guess he would still count as a rookie, if he comes in.  I think he is much better now than some negative comments on the bottom. He is the best rebounder at the olympics. His offense is solid.  I rate him definitly higher than javale mcgee or willie cauley stein.  Can probably have similar impact like Plumlee, Theis or Robin Lopez."
"I know I been kind of hating on the mavs lately but imo its really bad they couldn't secure neither richaun Holmes, nerlens noel, or another solid center. The mavs are so thin at that spot they can't afford to lose Willie cauley stein but they got both Reggie bullock and Hardaway Jr."
"Mavs will counter with    Boban Marjanović, Kristaps Porziņģis, Willie Cauley-Stein, Moses Brown, Dwight Powell"
Dallas has \~$33.5M and could get 4 more by renouncing Willie Cauley Stein and 3 if they traded Trey Burke into cap space. So...maybe?
Send Fox to the Mavs and Mavs need to sign Harry Giles this offseason. They already have Willie Cauley Stein!
Willie Cauley Stein was the 6th pick!
"Warriors fans need to realize that the most likely outcome for all of the guys they'd be trading out is that they are below average NBA players. Wiseman still has upside, but he's just a raw big man prospect at this point - just as likely to be Willie Cauley Stein as DeAndre Ayton. Wiggins has been a below average starter his entire career and was average during his best year last year. Looney, Poole, Paschall etc. are replacement level guys. These guys are primarily trade filler.  Beal is a 28 year old top 20 NBA player. Siakam is a 27 year old who was 2nd-team All-NBA 18 months ago. Wood is 25, already one of the best offensive big men in the league, and on one of the best contracts in the NBA.  If Warriors can get any one of them for their full package they should do it ASAP."

"The players also have a tendency to live in some totally random, but totally ordinary places/neighborhoods. Back at the old arena in Natomas, a bunch of players, especially rookies and players who just moved to the area during free agency or from a trade, would just be living in ordinary houses in these ordinary neighborhoods in Natomas since it was close to the arena. Some of the rookies even just lived in the totally plain apartment complex directly across the street (Nik Stauskus).  De'Aaron Fox first lived in Laguna West, which is very suburban and family-oriented neighborhood way at the south end of town. He moved to a much nicer/wealthier in Folsom/El Dorado Hills later on. Willie Cauley-Stein used to live in my family's neighborhood way out sort of in the middle of nowhere, just casually.   I feel like in just about any other NBA city, the players will pretty much always go for whatever wealthy/bougie/gated community is popular in the area but in Sacramento everyone just kind of spreads out into random places, despite us having those aforementioned communities."
"Thomas Robinson, Jimmer Fredette, Ben McLemore, Nik Stauskas, Willie Cauley-Stein, MARVIN BAGLEY to name a few"
that's right. Nobody walks around hating willie cauley stein
Willie Cauley-Stein
"I've got one. On draft day of the 2016 NBA draft:  Phoenix receives Sacramento's 2016 first round pick (#8)  Sacramento receives two 2016 firsts (#13 and #28), a 2020 2nd round pick, and the rights to Bogdan Bogdanovic.  It's not lopsided by any means. I think it would have been a wash if Bogdanovic never came to the league. However, the picks ended up just being a whole lot of bleh.  That 8th pick was Marquese Chriss, who has flashed potential on the Warriors fairly recently, but got pretty badly injured and hasn't played in a while.  That 13th pick was Georgios Papagiannis. We know how that one ended up.  The 28th pick was Skal Labissiere, who was almost projected for the lottery, but kept falling, and apparently for good reason. He's not on a team anymore.  The 2020 second round pick was eventually traded to Memphis on draft day 2020, and became Xavier Tillman (traded for Robert Woodard and a 2022 second rounder). Tillman's a solid rotation player.  -------------  Out of anything, the pick of Georgios Papagiannis is the biggest headscratcher out of this whole trade. Obviously, this isn't at the magnitude of picking Bagley over Luka, and that 2016 draft was kind of crap in the late lottery and mid first round. Honestly this was just a lose-lose for everyone. Both teams had been gunning to find their next solid big man. In recent history, the Suns used major draft capital to select Alex Len (2013), Dragan Bender (2016), Marquese Chriss (2016), and finally Deandre Ayton (2018), while the Kings had picked Thomas Robinson (2012), Willie Cauley-Stein (2015), Papagiannis (2016), and most recently, Marvin Bagley (2019). House SunKings indeed."
"Can't I tempt you with an irresistible offer of Josh Green, Dwight Powell and Willie Cauley-Stein?   Think about all of the *hustle*."

If it was, one of them might actually show something when they leave the Kings."
"You have to carry Willie Cauley-Stein and Ky Bowman to deserve the max in the NBA. This is a common fact that most people agree on, and I'm amazed teams are giving maxes to bums like Khris Middleton and Kyle Lowry, who could never play an important role in winning championships"

"I don't know why there is a prevailing myth of you can just sign any bargain bin free agent center for less than 10 mil and be fine defensively. People point to Golden State but Draymond is their true crunch time center, what do you think they'll be if you replace Draymond with Willie Cauley-Stein or Alex Len?   Almost every playoff series we see a big man who's getting played off the floor because either he's too slow or too small, now finally you got a guy like Ayton who's got size and elite movement skills on defense, and his team is nickle and diming him like they can just easily replace him with the WCS or Tristan Thompsons of the world."
"Turns out Vlade Divac was not a very good GM and hiring someone competent brought reasonable (expected) improvement. Hopefully, no more striking out on limited, raw, paint-anchored bigs from here on out!  2015: Picked Willie Cauley-Stein (Round 1: Pick 6) [yikes though this draft was a minefield at this point]  2016: Shipped the 8th pick (Marquese Chriss) PHX for the rights to Bogdan Bogdanovic (good move) and the 13th (Georgios Papagiannis) and 28th (Skal Labissiere) picks [good move, though lots of bleh in this trade]  2017: Picked Fox (great) but also picked Zach Collins for the Trail Blazers and shipped him to Portland for Justin Jackson (15th) and Harry Giles (20th) [debatable, lots of players that never fully panned out]  2018: Picked Bagley (2nd) ahead of Luka/JJJ/Trae and shipped out Gary Trent Jr. on draft day for future picks [biggest mistake by far]  2019: No 1st round pick because of the infamous Stauskas salary dump in 2015, almost certainly engineered by Divac. Pick was the 14th and used to pick Romeo Langford.  Divac steps down, new GM Monte McNair picks Tyrese Haliburton and Davion Mitchell in 2020 and 2021, respectively."
"2011 playoffs, I substitute Luka for Nowitzki:  Kyle Lowry (Kidd)  Derrick Jones Jr. (DeShawn Stevenson)  Luka  Luguentz Dort (Shawn Marion)  Brook Lopez (Tyson Chandler)  Bench:  Jordan Clarkson (Jason Terry)  Brunson (Barea)  Carmelo Anthony (Peja)  Willie Cauley-Stein (Brendan Haywood)  Minimum contract veterans for the spots of Cardinal, Mahinmi and Brewer."
"Saw Willie Cauley Stein walking down the sidewalk with one other dude somewhere in Manhattan. Called him by his name and asked him for a picture. “yea sure man” he said. Wished him good luck with the Kings. It was 2016  Only few hours later, I met KAT at his greet and meet in a Foot Locker store for winning his ROY. Congratulated him for winning the ROY. “Oh, thanks!” He said with a big smile. Pictures not allowed, sadly. 2016 again    Saw Demar DeRozan and Ed Davis at Canada Wonderland’s when I was maybe 13. My friend suddenly blurted out “bro! Demar is over there!” Me not looking: “yeah right lol stop.” I looked over and there they are. 4-6 people following them. Demar ignored me. His girlfriend/or wife piggybacks his back for some reason. Ed Davis dapped me and said “what’s up man.” It looked like they are leaving. That’s it. Cool guy. Early 2010s   Saw Terrence Ross and Quincy Acy with my own eyes this time at Canada Wonderland’s another time. No one follows them this time (ahh, Canadians not caring about basketball) Quincy came off kinda egotistical but I actually find it hilarious. He didn’t look annoyed or irritated. It’s just Quincy thinks he’s the shit. Terrence was very polite and took a picture with me and thanked me for saying hello. Early 2010s again    I notice calling them by their names first helped."

"Correct title: ""Willie Cauley-Stein fails to push a crowd backwards"""
"Well we need some people on our roster to put the ball on the floor. He also really isn't too bad at it. You cannot have only one guy pressuring the rim and expect to succeed. It's not gonna be Maxi Kleber/Dorian Finney Smith/Reggie Bullock/Dwight Powell/Willie Cauley Stein/Josh Green putting the ball on the floor. Luka, Brunson, Hardaway, and Porzingis need to be able to attack the rim."
"Willie Cauley Stein became our starting center... He was cut by the 20 win Warriors. Our center rotation is legitmately one of the worst I have ever seen.   Houston and Orlando can barely win games but they still have Wendell Carter, Mo Bamba or Christian Wood, Sengun, and Daniel Theis, all who are infinitely infinitely better than Powell, WCS, and Moses Brown. Boban is effective in very specific situations that come about like once every 10 games.   That being said, I think Dorian Finney-Smith definitely gets minutes off the bench for the Suns and Jalen Brunson is one of the best backup point guards in the league. Issue is Brunson is straight up our number 3 option and third best player and Finney Smith is our main perimeter and wing defender, and honestly one our more important shooters with how bad Hardaway/Bullock have been.   Hardaway and Bullock need to get it going so our shooting can at least start to cover deficiencies some games. I think both are capable of being very solid players as we saw from both of them last season."
"Meanwhile, the Dallas Mavericks just moved Willie Cauley-Stein into their starting lineup. Not considering maybe the dude that got cut by the 20 win Warriors is actually trash."
Warriors legend Willie Cauley-Stein
Willie Cauley Stein take it or leave it
"Sure but if Dray had Toni Kukoc, BJ Armstrong, Horace Grant and Luc Longley in the lineup with him instead of Ky Bowman, Glen Rob III, Eric Paschall and Willie Cauley Stein, it might be different."
"Because our center rotation is shit  KP can't play all his minutes at the 5 due to health preservation. Even then, hes a good rim protector and blocke but he isn't a strong body.  Powell has dirt on Cuban 100%. Why else would this guy still play so many minutes for us.   Oh wait, it's because next up is Willie cauley stein. when he's engaged he might be a tolerable backup. I can count the number of times I've seen him engaged on one hand. And that hand is closed in a fist.  Maxi Kleber is actually pretty legit defender. But he's coming off injury, and isn't quite big enough to stop the real bigs. He's an ideal defender against stretch/small 5's.  Boban is awesome and fun and can't really play more than 12-15min a game realistically. Usually more like 5-10. He's situational because it's easy to play him off the floor by going small.  That is not the C rotation of a contender. And it's the starting point for 90% of our defensive frustrations."
&gt; Willie Cauley-Stein frustrates our fan base to no end  All too familiar
"Trey Burke is probably the closest thing we have to this. Willie Cauley-Stein frustrates our fan base to no end, but I don’t think he’s disliked. Also - shoutout to Dwight Powell for people hating the role he gets out in (although he’s very well liked as a person)"
Giannis would solve all our problems. All.     Instead we have Willie Cauley-Stein.
"It's seriously brutal to watch such good defense go to waste. Like, the defense from the perimeter is really good, leads them to a location where a big man would usually alter the shot the extra amount to make it a miss (Serge, Gasol, etc.)... And no one is there to alter the shot. Like, give us Willie Cauley-Stein or Nerlens Noel and we'll make them look like a DPOY candidate - just someone nearing 7 feet would have given us three more wins instead of losses this year (Detroit, Portland, Chicago, and Dallas all killed us on the inside and we still kept it close)."
Willie Cauley-Stein is no longer the worst professional basketball player in America
My God Nerlens! You are looking like Willie Cauley-Stein out there.
"Warriors had a starting 5 with a salary of 7 million 2 seasons ago? The starters were Ky Bowman, Jordan Poole (as a rookie), Glenn Robinson, Eric Paschall, Willie Cauley-Stein."
"no he should definitely stay so he can play with willie cauley stein and dwight powell  you can have knox after we waive him.   you collect all the knicks players, we'll just take one from you"
willie cauley stein has the highest +/- on the mavs in this game lmao
I know this list is a joke because I don’t see Willie Cauley-Stein 😤
The GOAT Willie Cauley-Stein
"I watched us through our 19-20 season lol. And hence last season seemed like a major upgrade in all positions.  ## Fun Fact: Of the 20 players who got minutes for the Warriors that season, 11 of them are out of the league this season.     Our guards were:    * rookie Jordan Poole (who was really league worst)    * Ky Bowman * Alec Burks (who played well and got traded mid-season) * DLo (played only half the games that season)   * Damien Lee  Forwards:    * GRob3 * Paschall   * Dray    Bigs:    * Marquese Chriss   * Omari Spellman   * Willie Cauley-Stein (also traded away mid-season)"
But we have Willie Cauley-Stein so it evens out /s
I see you haven't watched Willie Cauley Stein wander aimlessly around the court.
"Willie Cauley-Stein. Utter waste of athletic ability, often completely disinterested in what’s going on around him."
Let me tell you the legend of Willie Cauley-Stein
"The Blazers were also defeated by the Golden State Warriors on [Nov 14, 2019](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201911040GSW.html) by a Warriors squad whose highest paid player was Willie Cauley-Stein making $2.2M/year.  I think the whole roster was under $10M."
"Bruh, their backup C is Willie Cauley Stein who refuses to post up against rookie guards."
"I will NEVER understand how Willie Cauley-Stein is still in the league. I don't know a single thing this dude does well.  He has awful hands, weak as fuck, gets constantly bullied down low, can't defend anything, can neither shoot or roll properly... Why is this dude playing at all?"
I thought Willie Cauley Stein would be much better. I’m not sure why probably because of Kentucky going 38-1 that season
