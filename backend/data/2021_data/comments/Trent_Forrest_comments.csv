"Bryn ""Forbs"" ...   Naz ""Reed"" ...   Trent Forrest ..."
Trent Forrest played more minutes than Derrick Favors.
Trent Forrest must be feeling awkward as the only Jazz player who didn't score tonight.
"For some perspective on just how good NBA guys are compare to college, here is what the roster of the Salt Lake City Stars, a team that is currently 2nd to last in the G-League with a 4-11 record consists of:  Tyler Bey: 1st Team All Pac-12  Trevon Bluiett: Consensus all-American, 1st team all-Big East  Jarrell Brantley: First team all-CAA  Yogi Ferrell: First team all-B1G,   Trent Forrest: 2nd team all-ACC  Romaro Gill: Big East DPOY  Elijah Hughes: 1st team all-ACC  Malcolm Miller: 2nd team all-Patriot League  Trevon Scott: 1st team all-AAC, AAC DPOY  And again, these guys have all improved since they earned these college accolades yet they combined are still the 2nd worst team in the G-League. Now imagine what the best teams in the G-League have. And now imagine what NBA teams have. No college team is coming close to beating an actual NBA team."
you can just say trent forrest
Trent Forrest also contributed to the win
Shotout Trent Forrest
"Tbh we’ve been playing trent forrest and matt thomas in the 4th quarter, i’m not too worried"
"Six minutes left in the game and down 16, and Utah had Trent Forrest and Derrick Favors in. Seemed like lineups were the biggest issue with the Jazz tonight. Starting crew didn't play much together. Forrest looks afraid to shoot. Good defense by the Jazz on Steph despite his points, but Draymond played great and everyone else took the threes instead."
"Normally that would be correct, but Trent Forrest can't make threes."
"Here's some remarks on probably the most unremarkable game of the NBA season (or NBA history, you decide). But hey, I wrote all this shit down so I figured I'd share:  * Early on when Rudy is in the action on D he's comfortable straying away from Poeltl to contest shots. First possession he alters an elbow jumper from Vassell then next possession he leaves Jake Puddle to contest Keldon Johnson's layup. This Spurs bunch doesn't have great passing so they're not looking for JP on lobs or quick interior passes to punish Gobert * CAVEAT TO THE ABOVE POINT: two straight possessions the Jazz guard the Murray/JP PnR with two guys; Gobert stunts to Murray both times and Murray finds JP for two buckets * Trent Forrest Good: puts Vassell in jail on the PnR and hits a nice floater. Trent Forrest Bad: leaves his feet contesting a pretty weak Murray pump fake (on replay Murray may have even been looking to pass?) and fouls the shit out of him. Trent Forrest Good: slips by Murray in screen-the-screener action that Quin loves and gets a wide open dunk (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""That's a big time NBA move."" Uhh, no Craig, the Spurs fucked up the coverage and were all yelling at each other after the play) * Wooofff Rudy Gay just got flat-footed by Bojan on an iso and beat to the rim. Bojan isn't De'Aaron Fox, folks. Maybe it's legs because the Spurs have had a hellacious schedule but that looked pretty bad * Spurs get a couple buckets in the first with Lonnie Walker going at Clarkson. The Jazz need JC in the playoffs but he's going to get attacked, he's dying on every screen (even small/small screens). At least JC is hitting the floater though, 5/6 early for 12 1st quarter points * Dieng is getting cooked in PnR. Like Jordan Clarkson [cooking a grilled cheese cooked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nreFpbJXt30). He gives up a wide open lane to Ingles off a Gobert screen then on a Forrest/Gobert PnR he doubles Forrest (???) and it's an easy lob to Gobert. He's -14 in 6 minutes. Jazz up 22. Cue Drew Eubanks * Oni kinda looks like a guy who can be a good on-ball defender but he's not particularly quick or long or strong or cerebral. Granted he's usually guarding some of the bigger threats. And on offense he'll hit the open corner three and get some offensive rebounds but that's basically it. If he doesn't add something to his game this summer I don't see him sticking. He's like Royce but slightly worse at everything * Pop may be throwing in the towel a bit early tonight? Poeltl hasn't been in since his first stint, logging just seven first half minutes. After going down 22 they're running with Walker/Eubanks/Tre Jones/Bates-Diop/Samanic to close the 2nd quarter. That is, uhh, not an inspiring group. But I don't blame him, the Spurs have been ahead of the game with resting players and I'm sure Pop is trying to save his guys for winnable games and the play-in * Let's talk about Joe Ingles. He's running the point when he's out there w/ Conley/Mitchell out. Everyone says he's ""crafty"" which is kinda just a bullshit lazy white-guy characterization. To me crafty means you have multiple moves, countermoves, variations on those countermoves. LaMelo Ball is crafty, Ja Morant is crafty, Luka Doncic is crafty. Joe has exactly two moves in the PnR: (1) drive left, pass fake and shoot (2) drive left and dump off pass to Gobert/Favors. He's just **really** good at those two moves. Which is hilarious because, as someone who watches the Jazz all the time, you see it coming from a mile away. But Joe times that pass or pass fake so perfectly that it works more often than not * Jazz up 24 at the half. Bojan leading the way with 19 points on 8/9 from the field and getting to the rim at ease against this not-your-father's-Spurs Defense * Addendum to Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: (3) a third defender comes over in the PnR to tag Gobert and Joe whips a lefty pass to the corner for a Bojan three * Watching Royce O'Neale is kinda hilarious because he makes like four buckets a game but he celebrates each one like a cocky eighth grader. He finishes on Poeltl with an admittedly nice lefty scoop shot and looks at his hand as he runs back, then makes a WIDE open three and points to the corner camera while backpedaling. But hey, if you play a thankless role guarding the best guys and being the fifth option on Offensive like O'Neale, go ahead and celebrate big guy * Self-Aggrandizing-Victory-Lap on Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: Joe does move (1) and gets an and-1 on Poeltl (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""CRAFTY!"") * All of the sudden the Jazz are up 36 midway through the third quarter and this game is over. Friendly reminder that there are too many games in the NBA season and to get your COVID Vaccine. Yours truly will now be tuning out and YouTubing Jordan Clarkson cooking grilled cheese"
"lmao even Trent Forrest, an undrafted rookie looks better than most of our team right now"
"Trent Forrest, too"
"I doubt it. We only have three guards on our rotation that are NBA level players, and two of them are injured. Replacing Mitchell's production is hard enough; replacing it with Trent Forrest and Matt Thomas is laughable."
wished it was closer though. trent forrest outside garbage time i knew it wasn't coming
Doesn’t wanna have to defend Trent Forrest now that Mitchell is out
1) Jordan Nwora - Bucks  2) Gorgui Dieng - Spurs  3) Ryan Arcidiacono - Bulls? (not sure if he was traded)  4) Keljin Blevins - not a clue  5) Tyrell Terry - not a clue  6) Brandon Goodwin - Hawks  7) Mo Wagner - Bulls  8) Oshae Brissett - Raptors?  9) Trent Forrest - Heat?  10) Wenyen Gabriel - Heat?
"This jam happened because he had lost confidence in his shot by missing the last two 3s he took lol.   But he would be deferential at times at FSU too. I think it's less a lack of confidence and more his first instinct which is to keep the ball moving by being a facilitator.   He played with arguably our best PG of all time in Trent Forrest (now on the Jazz), but Mann was arguably the more consistent player to let run the offense."
“That’s when I took it personally” - Trent Forrest probably
"The Jazz likely protect Mitchell, Gobert, Bogdanovic, O'Neale, Clarkson, Ingles, Favors, and Oni. Niang and Conley aren't under contract next year.  Trent Forrest has played the most minutes outside of those named. Matt Thomas is probably the best bet. Elijah Hughes has huge potential but has barely played and was hurt for part of the season, same with Azubuike."
Rusty Donovan much better than Trent Forrest
"For some perspective, this is what the roster of the Iowa Wolves, a team with the worst record in the G-league last season, consisted of:  -Zylan Cheatham- 1st team all pac 12  -Canyon Barry- SEC 6th Man of the Year  -Jordan McLaughlin- 1st team all pac 12  -Jordan Murphy- 1st team all big 10  -Allonzo Trier- 1st team all pac 12  -Isiah Briscoe- Averaged 12/5/4 while being a starter for an Elite 8 Kentucky team  Heres the Salt Lake City Stars, the 2nd worst team in the G-League last season:  -Trevon Blueitt: consensus all-American in college  -Jarrell Brantley- 1st team all-CAA  -Trent Forrest- 2nd team all-ACC  -Trevon Scott- 1st team all-AAC, AAC DPOY  -Malcolm Miller- 2nd team all-Patriot League  And these guys have all gotten better with years of training and experience since they earned these college accolades.   The top couple of guys in college are better than the top couple of guys in the G-league but top-to-bottom it just doesnt compare. You aint getting to the G-League if you arent a pretty damn good college player"
"If the Jazz had space I would love him because of the French connection, Quin’s system , and the opportunity to learn from two of the most talented guard tandems in the league. Alas the jazz have filled their roster with the last guard who has good talent, Trent Forrest, besides they will be paying the luxury tax this year anyways."
"Trent Forrest looks like a vet for Utah, highly doubt the jazz can bring him back on a 2-way"
"The Jazz have Udoka Azibuke and Trent Forrest looking like Penny and Shaq after the first two games. But the real question is if Jarrell Brantley is going to show enough to earn the last roster spot. Otherwise, its a pretty boring summer league for them."
"The only names I recognize on this Jazz roster are Chealey (G-league journeyman), Justin Patton (big fall from grace), and MaCio Teague (2021 Undrafted). I've seen Malik Newman's and Jarell Martin's names before, too. However, the likelihood any of these guys end up in the G-league, let alone the NBA, is slim.  Jazz White has some of our roster guys, including Juwan Morgan (potential stretch 5 and on our main roster), Elijah Hughes (2nd round pick in 2020 and on our main roster), Jarrell Brantley (2nd round pick in 2019 and two-way last season), Udoka Azubuike (1st round pick in 2020, was our 3rd string center but got injured), and Trent Forrest (PG on a two-way with us last season). Other names I recognize include Dakota Mathias (was on the National Team practice squad) and Jawun Evans (played for Clippers a couple years ago). These guys are definitely much closer to being on rosters than the guys on Jazz White.  FYI, the Jazz White squad is playing against the Spurs summer league team now."
"Lebron, rondo, Trent Forrest, Brandon Goodwin and Lonzo ball"
"50 players shot 90% or better but didn't shoot enough to qualify for leaderboard  Trent Forrest for example shot 19/19  Langston Gallaway shot 22/23 as did Georges Niang  https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_totals.html  uncheck the ""hide non-qualifier"" box"

"You’re getting downvoted but you’re not wrong. Tony’s a great reporter and is pretty reliable for Jazz news, but he’s just suuuuper thin-skinned. I remember during garbage time for a game last year he tweeted something like “Great chasedown block by Oni” when it was actually Trent Forrest that had done the block. I simply replied “Wasn’t that Forrest?” Checked back a few minutes later and I’m blocked lmao"
"Jazz fans after a win: ""Gobert is DPOY! Mitchell is All-NBA! We have 5 candidates for 6MOY! Snyder is a god! Even our young guys are looking good! These are the good old days, kids!""  Jazz fans after a loss: ""Gobert is trash. Mitchell is a chucker. Clarkson and Ingles are washed. Snyder never makes adjustments. Trent Forrest played too many minutes. Everyone was right, we're gonna lose in the second round again."""
Jazz would take Ben Simmons for Trent Forrest and a second-round pick. Come on Morey don't be selfish
I wanna see more Trent Forrest
And our backup PG is Trent Forrest
"As an FSU fan I can tell you he was better for us than his stats lead you to believe. Under Leonard Hamilton’s system, you can’t judge a player by their PPG. A top prospect playing at FSU will always have less eye-popping stats than players of a similar caliber at other schools because Leonard likes a rotation of 11+ guys vs 7 at other schools. He also doesn’t believe in “feeding the hot hand” and, sometimes to fan chagrin, is not above subbing the team’s best player out if he believes it’s for the good of the team. You can take a look at Jonathan Isaac and Patrick Williams’ stats as further examples of this phenomenon. I truly believe that Leonard and his staff are great at scouting and developing talent (see Trent Forrest, Terrance Mann, and Kabengele) but these recruits will never be given as much of a spotlight as they would receive at schools with shallower benches.  Scottie was the floor general for us last year as a freshman and did a pretty good job of it."
