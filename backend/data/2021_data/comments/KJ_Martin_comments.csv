1) christian wood  2) john wall  3) victor oladipo  4) eric gordon  5) PJ tucker danuel house demarcus cousins sterling brown jae'sean tate ben mclemore david nwaba mason jones kenyon 'kj' martin jr brodric thomas kevin porter jr.   6) dante exum  7) not rodions kurucs
It's too bad Rockets got like 4 guys down in the G-league. Would love to see some KJ Martin and Porter Jr.
"mason jones, kj martin, and nwaba were really important in this game too. tate and brown were ok but had slightly off nights for how they have been producing. the lineups overall looked much better than they were just a few games ago.  *man those old men young guys lineups should be used more they are more compatible."
KJ Martin with the block of the year
"bet. Rockets are -1.1 with Wood on the floor and +14 with KJ Martin. just pointing out the stats, not implying anything."
"houston got 3-5 really good pickups. tate, brown, mason jones, kj martin, nwaba, and i guess you might even be able to throw in wood in that considering how few seemed to actually notice him. despite all the people who did being high on him."
"this is the deep dive that people who are casuals need to read.  The protections in not just these picks, teh pistons, portland one means that we should be scouting middle schoolers and maybe in half a decade we can hit in the draft and when those guys hit their 7 year extension, we then have to hope tillmans money situation has changed.    Not to mention hearing houston broadcasters say they spent 5 million to buy the 52nd pick kj martin, someone not projected to even be drafted or late 2nd round.  Thats the most epensive 2nd rounder, let alone LATE 2nd rounder in the history of the nba...more like they paid for pistons to eat arizas salary then they waited for a sleeper they believed should get the same amount as a lottrey player up until the 52nd pick.    Trust the process?.... If only tillman shut up and listened ."
KJ Martin Jr yezzirrrr
"no to mention there is no debt, the owner will only take in minimum contracts...and its comical to see rockets announcers say we paid 5 million for the 52tht pick in kj martin.  Theres enver been a 2nd rounder at that price let alone wone in the late 50s for a kid who was most likey a 2nd -undrafted..... itst just more bs tillman snake oil  we paid half of arizas salary to detroit is what it was and gave up a 16th pick for a top 16 protected pick next 4 years."
"KJ Martin was the haircut case, McLemore's positive result was unrelated to the other guys"
McLemore had to isolate for testing positive but the contact tracing quarantines were from KJ Martin
no he didn't have anything to do with that. kj martin an a staff employee were the ones who tested positive. and due to contact tracing half their team had to miss games.
"6 if you count Exum and Kurucs   Yeah we have KPJ and KJ Martin that we are bringing from the g league after the all star break. They’re wings so I believe our FO is waiting for some trades cause they need minutes to play. Our team has like 10 wings on it so even with injuries, they might not get minutes right now still  The actual holes in our team being the big man spot and back up point, we have no coverage for"
"While he’s with our G-league team, KJ Martin has mad hops and I hope he participates eventually."
"Is he? KJ Martin has too, and so has Ray Spalding"
What about KJ Martin
KJ 'Giantsbane' Martin.  We need a Game of Zones crossover goddamnit!
I'd take KJ Martin Jr over him.
KJ Martin has been great for a guy who was picked at 52  Tate has been a top 4 rookie all season
"Also, a big shout out to KJ Martin Jr.  Dude is balling for a guy picked 52nd.  Only 19 and mad athleticism and pedigree...  Could be another gem."
KJ Martin   Kevin Porter Jr  Kelly Olynyk  Tate
"Who is KJ Martin? For the blind 😎, it is light 💡🔌. For the hungry 🍆, it is bread 🍞. For the sick 😷, it is the cure 🚫😃🤓. For the sad 😭, it is joy 😂. For the poor 🇺🇸, it is the treasure 💰⛏; for the debtor ✔❎💵, it is forgiveness 👭"
"He's the 4 in this scenario. He's been awesome in the few games he's been here, so it's hard to ignore that and his veteran presence.   House would be an option.   KJ Martin Jr. Is who I'd like to see starting.  But raw stats have to favor Kelly (although it's an extremely small sample).  (Btw, you may not be aware of this, but Houston is indeed tanking. Although I find it strange you have Kuminga over Mobley for frontcourt help)"
KJ Martin should've been in the dunk contest.
KJ Martin got a dunk the next possession lol they were staring each other down
How do you know where the BK picks are gonna end up? KD/Kyrie/Harden can all opt out after next year.   Saying we shouldn’t get picks because of one draft bust from 6 years ago is a new angle lol. We just got KJ Martin with the 52nd pick and he already is looking better than most people picked that late.   You have no idea what those picks will look like so how does it make sense to judge them already?
"I think it’s wrong to completely attribute Tate’s success to playing time. The dude has been a beast. Fits the Draymond archetype perfectly. He’s nothing like a rookie and there’s a reason he gets so much time.   But yeah, saying we have one of the best young cores was a little ambitious. Point was that we have a jumpstart on a rebuild. And our young guys have easy pathways to minutes to develop too.  I think your evaluations are low of our rookies, but I’m also a biased homer so I get it lol. Wood was putting up all star numbers pre-injury. KPJ is only 20 years old and is probably the most talented guy on our team. I don’t think it’s absurd to think he has all nba potential. Tate/KJ Martin probably won’t be all stars, but they look like they’d be awesome role players. KJ himself is a highlight reel and while that usually doesn’t mean much, I don’t think we should sleep on how many guys he’s posterized or blocked. He’s 6’6” and has taken Gobert, Boban, Zeller, and John Collins’ lunch already. I think it’s hard to definitively say most guys are All NBA locks or have that potential this early.   All of that plus we have a treasure trove of picks to improve."
KJ Martin Jr.
Yeah imagine a young core consisting of KPJ-KJ Martin-Christian Wood-Jarrett Allen and whoever you get in the lottery this year. That would be fantastic
Well our role players are our main guys now but guys like Tate and KJ Martin are really nice
"Cody Martin, Caleb Martin, Kelan Martin, KJ Martin, Martin Lawrence"
At the end of the day... KJ Martin will be an All NBA defender in 2-3 years.
KJ Martin &gt; KJ McDaniels
KP Jr and KJ Martin Jr are the FUTURE
"We've gotta start giving KPJ and KJ Martin more minutes, Oladipo is so damn bad"
KJ Martin is pretty good  Cousins is a lot worse than many of our guys lol
"We're not in too bad of a spot tbh. Tons of picks in the coming years with a pretty good young core of guys to move forward with and build upon in Wood, KPJ, Tate, and KJ Martin. Gets even better if we keep our top 4 pick this year."
"My guess:  House, Wall, Gordon, Wood, Olynyk  KPJ, Tate, KJ Martin as the rest of the standard rotation, I'd guess.   I really don't think KPJ stats if Rockets are healthy and trying to win."
Yeah. Tate is great but KJ Martin has showed serious potential mostly because he has been balling out against contending teams.  What separates him and Tate is 3 point shooting. KJ is shooting 41% from 3. Tate is an all around great player tho
KJ Martin and Armoni Brooks are the future
"KJ Martin is crazy athletic. He jumps so high, he could win the dunk contest."
"3 firsts this year, currently projected to be high lottery, 23 and 24, but that high lottery could become late first if we don't get a top 4 pick.  A heap of future picks and swaps  Cap space  A young core of Wood, KPJ, KJ Martin and JaeSean Tate  And I feel we have some promising players in Khyri Thomas and Armoni Brooks  Honestly I think our future looks good all things considered, especially if we get a top 4 pick. We're in a good place to make some moves in a few years to acquire another all star, and we have a lot of chances to hopefully acquire some good young talent through the draft. I think the Rockets hate is overblown right now in this sub."
"Levert wouldn’t help the Rockets, he doesn’t fit their timeline.  KPJ and Kj Martin are younger, more potential and healthier."
He’s been fair.  Signed Tate for nothing. #3 in ROTY Ladder  Got KPJ for nothing  Got KJ Martin with the 52nd pick.   Got Wood.
Too bad our entire team is hurt. Kj Martin 40 point game here we come
"Depends on the draft lottery this year. We have 3 FRPs this year but we need to stay in the top 4  We have our pick for the next two years so we can tank peacefully without worrying about protections.  We also own 7 Nets picks/pick swaps but that’s very far into future. Also own the unprotected Bucks pick in 2023 as well as the Pistons and Wizards (both protected).  KPJ, KJ Martin and Brooks have all been pretty good.  Tate and Wood are older (25) but they have high value/up side."
"Scared of KJ Martin, can't blame him."
"Scared of Kyrie, KJ Martin and Armoni Brooks"
AD and Lebron don't want to get swatted by KJ Martin lmaao
KJ Martin bout to add Lebron to his collection
"KPJ will be 25 in 2025, KJ Martin will be 24, Brooks will be 26  And they own their picks in 2022 and 2023  Still a much better situation than Detroit, Magic, and Cleveland  Also helps that they’re in a bigger market"
Talking about KJ Martin not KPJ lol
"Rockets future is somewhat underrated.  KPJ, Armoni Brooks, Wood, Tate and KJ Martin are all guys 25 or younger.  Not to mention their absolute haul of picks from Blazers/Nets/Wizards/Pistons/Bucks  If they somehow manage to keep their pick, it’s all up"
I worked with KJ Martin Jr when he was in grade school. I live in Los Angeles
really like the way our young guys have been fighting recently. Blazers offense was just way too much for one of the worst defensive teams. KJ Martin continues his scorching hot 3 point shooting. He has so much two way potential to look forward to. Excited for the future Rockets fans!
"Yeah Tate is nice. KJ Martin has been the most impressive imo. He looked like ass at the beginning of the year but has looked amazing these last 10 games. I guess thats what happens when ur 19 years old lmao. The Rockets hit a decent amount of 3s today, but does y'alls defense worry Portland fans? There is no way in hell we should've scored 129 points with THIS roster. A lot of the main dudes who were carrying us in close losses were even out (KPJ, Wall, etc) so im shocked that this many points were allowed in this game."
I love KJ martin
"Wood is a near all star caliber player, Wall is still pretty good minus the shot chucking and inconsistency, KPJ has been great and Tate is a solid rookie and glue guy along with Olynyk who has been excellent for us.  We would also have a servicable bench of Gordon, House, Nwaba, KJ Martin, and McLemore"
Man is ducking KJ Martin smh my head
"I'd also  Kelly Olynyk, Kevin Porter Jr and KJ Martin would be three od their better players."
"I like how you're avoiding the question because you know I've got you beat by your own logic lmaoo. Three straight comments I've asked you a question and you avoid it. That's how you know you're just wrong.   Answer this very simple question ok. Why is what KJ Martin did acting tough, and the clip with Ginobili is not acting tough? They are both screaming and flexing.  Go ahead I'll wait."
We prolly have one of the best scouting department in the league  Tate and KJ Martin were straight up steals.  Thomas and Brooks have been great too.  Part about a rebuild is taking a flyer on lots of prospects. Glad those guys have been playing well
"lol I have unfortunately watched the whole ass game and im mystified why hes playing so passive... the Rockets tallest player is 6'6'' and we are currently running an 8 man roster of Anthony Lamb, Jeffries, KJ Martin, House, Khyri Thomas, Jae'Sean Tate, and Armoni Brooks. Y'all should be up 30 and Gobert should easily have a 20/20 game..."
KJ Martin has been so good all season but he’s been hot as hell since being a starter
Is KJ Martin the GOAT? Think about it
"KPJ, Ja'Sean Tate, C Wood, K Olynyk, KJ Martin. I can go on"
"What a sneaky pickup KJ Martin was.  Outside the highlight blocks and dunks, his shooting is getting real"
"Let it be known that the Rockets, led by KJ Martin, Kelly Olynyk, and DaQuan Jeffries are tied with the Bucks, led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, and Jrue Holiday after the first quarter."
"You’re so clueless lmao  You might not like the Harden trade, but LeVert, even if he had a good game, is still a really inneficient scorer his whole career.  Hes also 26, so hes not going to be part of our future, but with his shot profile would take oportunities away from young guys  We took Oladipo because we thought he was the better player, and he left us flexible to start tanking next season when we own out picks. In hindsight it looks bad but back then it really didnt. When we took Oladipo they were about the same efficiency but Oladipo was a much better defender.  At the end of the day we got Olynyk, who might leave in the offseason but for this year has been a lot better than LeVert has been, at least for us, and has been an excelent veteran and is really good friends with KPJ  Now saying the FO is incompetent when they nailed the 52nd pick in KJ Martin, got Tate as an UDFA and hes a top 5 rookie, got Christian Wood for 13M a year and got Kevin Porter Jr for free is actually mind blowing lol"
KJ Martin at 52 has been great  Tate undrafted has been a top 5 rookie  Took a flier on KPJ  - Cant Scout
"This makes me super sad.  The second we used him to move Ryan Anderson, I knew it was a mistake.  But KJ Martin is my new ""hidden gem SRP"", and he and TATE ease the pain a bit."
"You want to know something funny?  His nickname is KJM, not KMJ. Because he goes by KJ, for Kenyon Jr. So now his nickname is Kenyon Jr Martin. It's so dumb but even the commentators do it."
KJ Martin
all i want from this game is for kj martin to block bol bol
I want to see KJ in a Nuggets uni so bad. We’d for sure have to bring the powder blues back so we could have the Kenyon Martin - Kenyon Martin Jr. matching set.
KJ “Giant-slayer” Martin
Kj Martin blocking yet another 7 footer.
Get kj martin jr out here
I need to see him try that on kj martin jr. sky walker vs sky walker
I know we're ass but KJ Martin Jr might be the best shot blocker under 6'7 in the NBA. He has blocked 4 7' Footers already this year in limited minutes.. Including Gobert twice this season. Usually in absolutely sensational fashion.
"i know we’re ass so people don’t know about him, but KJ martin might be the best shot blocker under 6’7 in the NBA"
"Wood, KJ Martin, KPJ, and Tate doesn't get us a Top 20 spot?"
"Yeah see my thing is he has two years left. He’s about to be 26 and doesn’t fit the timeline of KPJ, KJ Martin, and hopefully a top 4 pick this year. Also, we have full control of our pick next year so it’s probably smart to be bad again"
"Kinda off topic but can we talk about how great the Covington trade was for the Rockets (trading him out I mean):  Rockets traded RoCo and a 2027 2nd round pick and got Wood,KJ Martin, and 2 future first round picks (one of those is the 23rd pick this year)."
"Saying the Nets package is “god awful” when most of the draft assets convey after 2023 is insane. We literally know how much the NBA changes in just 2 years.  I’m not saying it was a fantastic deal by any means but  you’re doing too much. We must be watching two different Ben Simmons.   Simmons ain’t a scrub at all but he is not the generational franchise cornerstone you think he is  Its better to bottom out, then be a team stuck as a 10-13th seed for the duration of Simmons contract. He’s not getting flipped for a haul, so let’s kill that idea.  You’re also rate Maxey and Thybulle extremely high as well.  Thybulle is an elite defender but is closer to Tony Allen/Roberson than a PG type. I mean he averages 4 PPG.   Rockets have already found great talent this year dirt cheap between KJ Martin, Armoni Brooks, Tate and KPJ.   Gonna go on a limb and say I trust Rockets scouting department to get players like Maxey/Thybulle."
KJ Martin  Armoni Brooks  Lamelo  Edward’s  Bey   Stewart  Tyrese H  Bane
kJ Martin?
kj martin jr had some of the nastiest blocks i’ve ever seen and they would never even be posted to r/nba
"Less talented than the Pistons? Than the Magic? Than OKC? Than the Cavs? We were playing pretty well before the Wood injury, and then the team went through a slump, and everyone got rested and shut down for the year, while we experimented with new players and lineups to keep our record in the bottom 3. Despite that, we have Wood, KPJ, Tate, and KJ Martin, some good productive veterans, not to mention a lot of picks for the next few years including 3 in the upcoming draft.  What assets do they have to add to their core of Beal and Westbrook? Rui and Deni? How are the Wizards attracting ANY free agents, let alone fringe all-stars? They're capped out with their current roster (only 2 million under the luxury tax, and 8 million under the hard cap). They are likely picking between 15-20 for the next 3 years until Russ and Beal are gone. They're going to regret not trading Beal while his value was highest and starting the tank early."
1. Wood 2. KPJ 3. Tate 4. KJ Martin 5. Khyri Thomas 6. Armoni Brooks 7. Sterling Brown 8. Kelly Olynyk
"Wood, KPJ, Tate, KJ Martin, Olynyk, Brown, Augustin"

W for the KJ Martin respect he’s been really nice
IMO KJ Martin and Tate have been better than Mcdaniels  Mcdaniels: 7/4/1 on 55 TS%  KJ: 9/5/1 on 61 TS%  Tate: 11/5/3 on 58 TS%
Need a KJ Martin masterclass tonight
him and kj martin won me the fantasy championship
"Ben Simmons would have made us way better this year, but he also would have taken us out of contention for the first pick and likely not made us much better than a play in team. Something isn’t always better than nothing.   And Stone has actually shown a really good ability to find diamonds in the rough already. Between Wood, Kevin Porter, KJ Martin and Jae’sean Tate, he’s put together a young core that has a very clear level of potential. Add a top 3 pick to that and this is one of the more promising young cores in the league.   Considering where we started the season, there’s a reason r/rockets is pretty optimistic about the future of the team right now."
"He’s already experiencing this with KJ Martin, just hasn’t realized yet probably lol"
Lamelo-Edwards-Haliburton-Bey-Stewart for first team     Campazzo-Quickley-Anthony-Tate-KJ Martin for second team
KJ Martin for sure   Maybe Tillman and Mcdaniels
1st team:  Lamelo-Edwards-Halliburton-Tate-Bey  2nd Team:  Quickley-KJ Martin-Bane-Stewart-Okoro
"Christian Wood, Eric Gordon, Victor Oladipo (when we had him), Kelly Olynyk, Kevin Porter Jr are all well known good players.   Sterling Brown shot 43% from 3 this year on high volume. Brooks is shooting 39%, KJ Martin is shooting 40%. Not even gonna name all the other players who have done well for us this year.  Why we acting like he was playing next to 15 Anthony Bennetts? Any other PG would have made the most of what they had instead of playing without a care in the world, especially when they want to prove themselves coming off an injury."
Rockets been playing well as of late  Brooks and KJ Martin are promising
Nah they got bodied by Armoni Brooks and KJ Martin
"This isn't the answer anyone is looking for, but the young Rockets have been a freaking joy to watch. Particularly KPJ and KJ Martin, but Tate and Wood, too. Even the 2-way guys have been fun and full of promise. They don't win a lot, but they compete like hell."
"KPJ, Jalen Green or Mobley, Wood, Tate, KJ Martin 🚀 We can only go up from here."
"Speaking of Eddie Jones, Nick the Quick (Van Exel), was so flashy and fun to watch. I also miss Rod Strickland (Kyrie's godfather) when he was dismantling defenses with his handles and pivot moves from the guard position.  I'm also going to say Kenyon Martin because he was so darn athletic. He says his son in more athletic that he is (what else is he supposed to say - proud dad) but I believe it! KJ Martin is crazy and a steal as the 52nd pick that was purchased by the Rockets to draft him."
kpj/jalen green/jaesean tate/kj martin/christian wood isnt a bad core
"I don't think KJ Martin is underwhelming. He was a strong rookie relative to his draft position.  Okongwu I don't think is ever gonna make a big leap, I think he's just gonna improve incrementally every year for a long time until he ends up a very good player"
Reminds me of Bill Worrell who retired this season after calling KJ Martin Christian Wood lile 20 times while Wood was injured and Martin is like 5 inches smaller lol
"How are the Rockets not looking promising?  We have the second most FRPs in the league and have a few good high potential young guys that are showing out (Tate, KJ Martin, KPJ).  We have the #2 pick as well this year which is also pretty decent in a loaded draft.  Obviously, I can be wrong, so feel free to correct me."
"&gt;The only NBA player with an affluent background I remember of is Jose Calderon.  ? Are you not aware of the many NBA players whose fathers played in the league?  Steph, Klay, Tim Hardaway, Jalen Brunson, KJ Martin, Cole Anthony, Jae Crowder, Bol Bol, etc. List goes on and on."
"Not just outside of John Wall. Outside of Tate, PJ, Nwaba, KJ Martin  The only people he would fit well with is Wood and perhaps Eric Gordon."
We have a 50% shot at keeping our pick this year  We own our pick the next 2 years  We have KpJ who looked great  We have All Rookie first team Tate earning 2M a year  We have 9/5 with a block on 58%tS KJ Martin whos 20 years old  We have 20/10 with a steal and a block a game CWood on really good efficiency  We got the second most FRPs in the League and Houston is a tier 2 market with no state income tax  We’re not great but we definitely arent the worse
"Rudy, Turner, Giannis, AD, Robert Williams III  HM-KJ Martin"
Rockets:   - Jalen Green - Alperen Sengun - Usman Garuba - Josh Christopher - Kevin Porter JR - Christian Wood - Jae'sean Tate - KJ Martin
"Rockets Fans are Delusional  Context: I am a Rockets fan myself and I am realy frustrated about my fellow fans and here is why:  People claim Harden was not a happy fit in Houston because he wasn't happy in the halfcourt and that he only was a spot-up shooter. Meanwhile those same people want Point Al P/Point KPJ. So why does Harden have to be happy in the halfcourt when he IS USED as an spot-up shooter? Also, Harden literaly was the only above average defender in the starting line-up last year. Yes, KJ Martin sucked last year and the same counts for Tate.  Meanwhile Rockets fans are happy that Harden left and say they won the trade when they literaly got somebody who averages a worse 3p% last season on the same amount of shots who has no synergy with Al P/Jalen Green and need the ball in his hands (more then Harden). Also Harden-Al P connection was happy. After this trade Rockets decide to throw a 38m/3yr bag at Ryan Anderson who has said that he wanted out. Ryan Anderson is an awful on ball defender and is not happy but he shot 33% from 3 last year and the Rockets need shooting? So they S+T the best shooter on the team who has great chemistry with the stars for a worse shooter who has no synergy but is better in the halfcourt where he won't touch the ball more then Harden and they give 38m/3yr to one of the worst 3pt% guards they have. Sorry but this is not happy, that is delusional and stupid."
No KJ Martin🤧🤧
Kj martin
KJ Martin 100%
"Alperen Şengün yelled out, “Işte gidiyorsun! Işte gidiyorsun.” Sharpshooter Jalen Green gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Josh Christopher yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before KJ Martin hit the locker room door, NBA great Rafael Stone hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Kelly Olynyk IF they start him Kevin Porter and KJ Martin Oshae Brissett Jaden McDaniels Nic Claxton Tyrese Haliburton and Chimezu Metu Devin Vassell  Nickeil Walker Alexander Robert Williams
"Wow, I actually never realized KJ Martin was Kenyon Martin Jr. all this time.  Thought they were two different people."
"Just ignoring the 4 first round picks this year, he got...  1. Wood on a great $14mil/year contract in a sign in trade by giving up 1 first round pick 2. Signed All-Rookie 1st Team member Jae'sean Tate to a cheap 4 year deal from the NBL 3. Bought the 52nd pick last year to draft KJ Martin 4. Traded for KPJ with a Top 55 protected 2nd round pick  That's 4 solid pieces for our rebuild and we hardly gave away anything to get them all. Stone has been so good at finding talent."
KJ Martin looks great too.
KJ Martin blew this game open. The Rockets are stacked with young talent.
"Green started sloppy, but bounced back despite the double.  Sengun continues to be our MVP.  Christopher is stepping up in the absence of a Rockets' PG.  KJ Martin, Lamb, and Thomas are hitting shots.   Pretty decent showing overall."
"Tbf the rest of our squad looked pretty incompetent compared to Sengun, Josh Christopher and Kj Martin."
John Wall - KPJ - Jalen Green - KJ Martin/Sengun - Wood  Maybe something like this would be the starting five.
If KJ Martin can make it consistently from 3 he'll fit in perfectly on this roster.
KJ Martin 3 ball is for real  That’s so amazing
KJ Martin Averaged 0.9 blocks last season and Faried in his career averaged 0.8 blocks.
"Lol bro you not keeping up with what the rockets are doing.. clearly only remember the harden trade.. but he got kj martin in the second round, Brought over Tate from overseas, traded up in the draft to get sengun (so far looks good), and he has put us in a great position in this rebuild"
KJ Martin is like a Kenneth Faried but can shoot lol.
"He’ll definitely be in the G-League for most of this season, we’re stacked at guard and wing (Wall, Augustin, KPJ, Brooks, Green, KJ Martin, Tate, and still have Gordon and House under contract)"
"“OH WATCH OUT, WHAT A MOVE” Play was out of bounds, and didn’t even result in a shot.  “KJ Martin couldn’t finish” It’s Jalen fucking green"
KJ Martin.
I mean KJ Martin has blocked every 7 footer in the league  It was only a matter of time
Someone post KJ Martin blocking Mobley
KJ Martin still blocking every 7 footer on the planet lmao
"Jalen Green, KJ Martin, and Josh Christopher are going to be so fun to watch"
"Green, KJ Martin, EG,JGup are all shooting guards are they not?"
"Not exactly a stat, but seeing KJ Martin play this year and finding out later that he’s Kenyon Martin’s son did it for me."
KJ Martin is a steal
"Houston have to be the big winners so far. Next thing is to find moves for Gordon, House and somehow Wall, and then build around:   **PG:** Kevin Porter Jr, Josh Christopher.   **SG:** Jalen Green.  **SF:** Jae'Sean Tate.  **PF:** Christian Wood, KJ Martin.  **C:** Alperen Sengun, Usman Garuba."
KJ Martin
He's a top 1 player of all time man stop the 🧢. Jae'Sean Tate and KJ Martin are unlucky that he is a bball player cuz he stole the title from both of them :(
"What separates Green and Mobley from Cade in your eyes? What makes him generational above the other 2? To me, I can’t decide who I think will be the best out of this draft between the 3; this draft top 3 is insanely stacked imo. Because I view them so similarly as talents, I would prolly offer 2nd overall, 23 or 24 this year, give the Pistons FRP back to them since that pick handicaps them for the next 7 years or until it conveys, and then either a future pick (nets, bucks, etc) or a young role player (tate, kj martin)"
KJ Martin did this as a rookie
No such thing as Europe as it pertains to basketball. The best G league players are bench warmers in the Swedish league? Here are some of the players playing in the g league last year: Kevin Porter Jr.  Jalen Green   jordan Poole.  Paul Reed.  Jared Harper.  Henry Ellenson.  Jeremy Lin.  Nico Manion.  Oshae Brissett.  Kobi Simmons.  KJ Martin.  Jalen Adams.  Vernon Carey jr Antonio Blakeney.   Any of these players can play for top European clubs. Some would dominate. Some actually signed with European clubs and many more were called up to the NBA. Some were sent for development and played a good 10-15 games.
"For sure.  Their young core is way underrated. KJ Martin is an insane athlete who became a legit shooter as his rookie year went on. Josh Christopher even has some good 3&amp;D potential, too.  But that is the team of the future (hopefully, if ayer development goes as planned)... Not the present."
Starters:  Wall- KPJ- Green- Theis- Wood  Bench:  Eric Gordon/Tate/KJ Martin/House/Sengun/Augustin/Nwaba/Brooks/Khyri
Kj martin
"It's hard to say. He's been an underclassmen for the last two years and Sierra Canyon has been unbelievably stacked that whole time. BJ Boston, KJ Martin, Zaire Williams, Zaire Wade, Scottie Pippen Jr were all on the team over the last two years."
"We had kpg, kj martin, and armoni brooks in g league last season. Rockets def use the Vipers for development the right thing way."
"Sierra Canyon is stacked. They had Moses Moody, BJ Boston, KJ Martin, Zaire Williams and Scottie Pippen Jr all on the team the last few years. Essentially if you were not a future NBA player you haven’t gotten much playing time recently. That makes it hard to evaluate players like Zaire Wade and Bronny who might’ve dominated at a smaller school but didn’t get much playing time here. I believe Bronny has been an underclassmen and is now going into his junior or senior year so it’s not a big deal that he hasn’t played but it would be if he doesn’t get playing time now."
 Trade Gordon/House so Josh Christopher and KJ Martin can get more minutes
"Edwards, Haliburton, KJ Martin"
KPJ/Green/KJ Martin/Sengun/Wood  Hayes/Cade/Bey/Stewart/Olynyk  Garland/Sexton/Okoro/Mobley/Allen
I wonder how big of a leap KJ Martin will take in the upcoming season.
Tate or KJ Martin + House
"Theis being bad isn’t the issue, I think Theis is actually a pretty decent center with most teams. Issue is he doesn’t fit with what this team is trying to do. For starters, his fitment with Wood is just awful. Floor is always clogged and it’s often times hard to watch them play out of there respective roles. We don’t have a great distributor with KPJ still learning the 1 and neither Wood nor Theis can distribute the ball, often resulting in lacklustre ball movement. What makes this worse is Sengun makes the offence run smoother every time he’s on the floor. Wood can play to his strengths and Senguns ball distribution helps get us a ton of open looks.  Theis isn’t hated because he’s bad, he’s just not what this team needs. We’ve seen what we can accomplish when guys like Sengun and KJ Martin get solid minutes. There’s no reason for Theis to be playing 30 a night. I think everyone’s more frustrated with Silas’s rotations."
"Didn’t realize I awakened the KJ Martin hive lmao  I know Rockets fans aren’t used to watching a shitty team, but I have years of experience in this arena. You always think that young guy with athleticism who tries on defense and can’t shoot all that well will be able to put it all together if only the coach just gives him more minutes.  They never do."
"Lol bad rotations isn’t a vague term at all. That’s something very easy to see. Bad rotations is stubbornly continuing with a Tate+Theis+Wood front court that constantly clogs the lane and makes it nearly impossible for our young guards to attack the lane. He also refuses to play Sengun and KJ Martin more than 20 minutes a game when every advanced stat says they’re our two most productive players. He also continues to give House minutes (and even started him once) when he quite possibly looks like the worst player on a current NBA roster.  Ball movement is also something that heavily comes down from coaching philosophy. Look at the Warriors change in play from Jackson to Kerr. The 2014 Spurs ball movement came down from Pop. That’s not really an issue with the Rockets right now, but I don’t think that take makes sense either."
"YES bro. Literally more KJ minutes, same with Sengun.  I’d even take Garuba minutes too, just keep House/Nwaba on the bench   He averaged 19/8/4 as a starter last season as a 19 year old (8 games)  Rockets are +16.0 in points scored per 100 possessions with KJ Martin on the floor vs. off, 97th percentile in the league.  +13.4 for the same metric with Sengun on the floor vs. off the floor, 95th percentile in the league."
"It’s not about the wins. It’s about how are players are being used   Our young players have struggled getting minutes over random vets. We LITERALLY have no offensive sets. It’s all just do whatever you want out there. Which for guys like KPJ and Green is too much responsibility right now and they are playing awful because of it   Garuba who played in a top league in the world and paid 4m just to break his team’s contract to come here can’t even step on the court without us being down 20 points. He’s now playing great in the g league  We have the worst shooting team in the league by a mile and Armoni Brooks who is a certified sniper can’t get on the court either.   Josh Christopher our other first rounder has struggled to get on the court as well. Despite being a better passer and shot creator than most of our team.   KJ Martin just recently started getting minutes despite outplaying our entire roster.  Sengun was given 5 min a couple games ago cause Quote by Silas “Theis was playing well”  Silas is not just not winning us games. He isn’t prioritizing minutes for our young guys, nor is he setting up our players for success.   So you tell me, what is Silas actually doing well? Except for having a big old grin"
I was wishing I could throw things through my tv at Silas's face because he is so infuriating.   Sengun aside. Why is House getting a single minute if Josh Christopher or KJ Martin is healthy? We are playing this Mathews guy 20 minutes a game on a two-way as opposed to our first round pick in Christopher.  Not that I think Mathews is bad but my point still stands.
He's also known as KJ Martin
"Alec Burks was only +1 in the game.   Houston had their two best players tonight, KJ Martin JR and Alperen Sengun on the bench to close out the game.   Silas was the best player for the Knicks tonight."
Free KJ Martin and Sengun!!
"No matter how he plays I still don't get why Rockets gave Theis a 4 year contract.  And Silas is just kinda out of his depth. This team is tanking no matter what and obviously better with young/unproven players rather than vets. At least finish the fucking game with Alperen and KJ Martin, you literally have nothing else to lose."
Even with KJ Martin and Kevin porter jr??  And T Ross and Cole Anthony and Mo Bamba and Fultz??
"The big difference tonight was the improved spacing with Gordon and House in the starting lineup. Driving lanes were opened up for Green and he was able to actually use his athleticism. KPJ+Tate+Theis is a floor-spacing disaster and I feel like that puts more emphasis on Green dribbling through traffic with handles that are definitely still a work in progress.   That being said, I don't want to see House starting or getting any minutes moving forward. He's just not good anymore. If we want to go small and space the floor better at the 4, might as well go with KJ Martin."
yo what did kj martin do to him
"&gt;And if you put the ball in the vets’ hands the fans will freak out.  Nah Silas has actively prioritized winning over development for a good number of games. Benched Jalen and played Eric Gordon in close 4th quarters to try to steal wins. Plays Theis, House, and Nwaba over KJ Martin, Sengun, Christopher and Aruba. He even goes with a lineup of Gordon, Nwaba, House, Tate, Theis at times. It is what it is.  Meanwhile coach Casey benched Olynyk so they can start Killian, Cade, Bey, Grant, and Stewart but Silas isn't willing to even give our players opportunities. Seems like Silas is trying to rebuild while also playing vets to get wins and he's half assing both."
So tell me why does KJ Martin and Tate can have easy shots. Don't tell me coaches draw plays specifically for them. Tired of seeing stans like you who just blames everyone else but the player himself
"Trying to be patient with him, but he doesn't look promising at all right now.  He's trying to build a free-flowing, player-instinct based offensive system but we clearly just don't have the personnel to do that right now. Instead, we just get pure anarchy with guys setting random picks and turnovers galore. He needs to implement more sets and structure on offense, and the frustrating parts is that the plays he does draw up on occasion are actually good, but he just never uses them.  The rotations are also poor most of the time. The lineup of Gordon, Nwaba, House, Tate, and Wood was absolutely atrocious. Zero playmaking and any guy off the street could've told you that wouldn't work from the get go but we decided to use it and of course Detroit extended their lead during that stretch. He also continues to play House and Nwaba over KJ Martin when KJ is younger and clearly more productive. And on a night where Sengun was out, it makes no sense that Garuba got 0 minutes. He's a promising young player that brings great energy and defense and he should be getting minutes.  The team discipline is also just poor in general. We're losing games primarily to missed free throws, turnovers, and long offensive droughts and all of that seems to primarily point back to coaching IMO.  He's a genuinely nice guy and the players seem to like him, so I hope he succeeds but he just hasn't been great so far."
how’s kj martin doing?
KJ Martin with the block to start it all. I love that he has no fear when going for those blocks.
"Off the KJ block, team is looking so good with Sengun and Martin on the floor"
"Houston should probably be...  Lock in: Jalen Green, KPJ, Jaesean Tate, Sengun, Garuba, Josh Christopher, KJ Martin, Armoni Brooks  Move on: Wall, Eric Gordon, Danuel House, Nwaba  Uncertain: Wood, Theis, Augustin, Garrison Matthews, Daishen Nix  Only trade Wood if we get a can't miss offer that helps the rebuild. Theis and Augustin are good bench players for this year, but they are not a part of our long term plans so they're under ""Uncertain"". Nwaba could be under ""Uncertain"" too, but he's pretty average and his skills overlap heavily with Tate and KJ Martin. I'd rather just move on from him and give minutes to the younger guys."
Sengun and KJ Martin played well too
"Jalen Green, Sengun, KPJ, KJ Martin, Garuba"
"Silas rotations have been awful since last season tbh  Dude is giving Theis, Nwaba, and House consistent minutes while KJ Martin, Brooks, and Garuba can’t crack the rotation   Also noticed he didn’t stagger Green-KPJ  He was good in the 4th tho when he put Wood at the 5 and KJ at the 4"
"It’s baffling to me how little minutes KJ Martin has gotten this season so far, 12/4/1/1 on 6/8 shooting with a +8 in 16 minutes is pretty damn efficient"
Just realized Melo is playing against KJ Martin after playing with his dad Kenyon Martin
KJ Martin better be getting heavy mins moving forward.
Silas please give KJ Martin more minutes
